{"Frankie Lymon was widely accepted as a teen idol.": [{"url": "https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/teen-idol-frankie-lymon-tragic-rise-fall-tells-truth-1950s-america-180967506/", "page_content": "That voice! Those apple cheeks! Arms wide, head back, he radiates joy, even in antique black and white. That beautiful soprano flying high, talent and presence and just enough ham to sell it all. And it was a great story, too: Up from nothing! A shooting star! So when they found Frankie Lymon dead at the age of 25 one February morning in 1968, in the same apartment building where he\u2019d grown up, it was the end of something and the beginning of something, but no one was quite sure what.\n\nFrankie Lymon and the Teenagers were five kids from Washington Heights, just north of Harlem. They sang doo-wop under the streetlight on the corner of 165th and Amsterdam. They were discovered by the Valentines\u2019 lead singer Richie Barrett while the kids were rehearsing in an apartment house. A few months later their first record, \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d made it to the top of the national charts. It was 1956. Overnight, Frankie Lymon was the hottest singer in America, off on a world tour. He was 13 years old.\n\nThat made him the first black teenage pop star, a gap-toothed, baby-faced, angel-voiced paragon of show business ambition, and a camera-ready avatar of America\u2019s new postwar youth movement. He was a founding father of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll even before his voice had changed. That voice and that style influenced two generations of rock, soul and R&B giants. You heard his echoes everywhere. The high, clear countertenor, like something out of Renaissance church music, found its way from the Temptations to the Beach Boys to Earth, Wind & Fire. Even Diana Ross charted a cover of \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d 25 years after its release. Berry Gordy may not have modeled the Jackson 5 on Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, as is often said, but it sure sounded as if he had.\n\nThat\u2019s the legend, anyway. Truth is, Frankie Lymon grew up too fast in every way imaginable. \u201cI never was a child, although I was billed in every theater and auditorium where I appeared as a child star,\u201d Lymon told Art Peters, a reporter for Ebony magazine, in 1967. \u201cI was a man when I was 11 years old, doing everything that most men do. In the neighborhood where I lived, there was no time to be a child. There were five children in my family and my folks had to scuffle to make ends meet. My father was a truck driver and my mother worked as a domestic in white folks\u2019 homes. While kids my age were playing stickball and marbles, I was working in the corner grocery store carrying orders to help pay the rent.\u201d\n\nA few days before Frankie and his friends from the corner recorded the song that made them famous, Rosa Parks was pulled off a bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Less than two years later, Frankie danced with a white girl on a national television show, and the show was swiftly canceled. Another part of the legend.\n\nRace integration in pop music was never going to be simple.\n\n**********\n\nAmerica in the 1950s: postwar economy roaring, a chicken in every pot and two cars in every garage of the split-level house in Levittown, every clich\u00e9 of union-made American middle-class prosperity held to be self-evident.\n\nAnd music was a big part of that. Raucous and brawny, electrified, it felt like Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis all fell from the sky at once. Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, with their tight, upbeat harmony, were an important part of it, too. You can trace doo-wop back to the Psalms, hear it bubble up in the a cappella harmonies of Gregorian chant, or, by way of Africa and the Caribbean, from gospel quartets.\n\nIn America, beginning in the 1930s, the Mills Brothers and the Ink Spots were the popularizers of those intricate harmonies we recognize today as proto-rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. Doo-wop was among the inheritors, a thousand street-corner groups and a thousand one-hit wonders. The Spaniels and the Five Satins and the Vocaleers, the Drifters and the Fleetwoods and the Moonglows, the Coasters and the Platters and on to Frankie Valli and modernity. In the 1950s, every high school stairwell in this country was loud with four-part singing. Even today the \u201cPitch Perfect\u201d movie franchise owes its popularity to an a cappella tradition stretching back into pre-electric history.\n\n\u201cWe harmonized every night on the street corner until the neighbors would call the cops to run us away,\u201d Lymon told Ebony. But Frankie wasn\u2019t doo-wop, not really. Doo-wop was group music. \u201cFrankie Lymon was always different than that,\u201d Robert Christgau, great-granddaddy of American rock critics and historians, will tell you. \u201cHe was the star.\u201d\n\nFrankie and his record producers and managers soon agreed he\u2019d be a more profitable solo act, so off he went, leaving behind the Teenagers, and with them friendship and loyalty. He had another, lesser, hit\u2014a recording of \u201cGoody Goody,\u201d sung by Bob Crosby and Ella Fitzgerald before him\u2014before things cooled.\n\nThen came the long, slow slide.\n\nAsk any junkie and they\u2019ll tell what they\u2019re chasing is the feeling they got the first time they got high. But that first-time rush can never be recaptured, whether you\u2019re talking about heroin or cigarettes or hit records.\n\nFrankie was a heroin addict at 15 years old. He tried to kick, tried again and again and got straight for a while. Then his mother died, and he fell hard.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t alone. Heroin was everywhere in New York by then, and methadone clinics run by the city were springing up in neighborhoods all over town. The failure rate was heartbreaking.\n\n\u201cI looked twice my age,\u201d Lymon told Ebony. \u201cI was thin as a shadow and I didn\u2019t give a damn. My only concern was in getting relief. You know, an addict is the most pathetic creature on earth. He knows that every time he sticks a needle in his arm, he\u2019s gambling with death and, yet, he\u2019s got to have it. It\u2019s like playing Russian Roulette with a spike. There\u2019s always the danger that some peddler will sell him a poisoned batch\u2014some garbage.\u201d Here young Frankie knocks on wood. \u201cI was lucky. God must have been watching over me.\u201d\n\nEven now you want to believe him.\n\n**********\n\nFrankie\u2019s neighborhood, just up the bluffs from the long-gone Polo Grounds, feels mostly unchanged even 50 years later. It was poorer then, sure, like the rest of New York City, and in the age before earbuds and headphones it was surely louder. You heard music in the streets.\n\nOutside Frankie\u2019s old address, on West 165th, there\u2019s a \u201cWet Paint\u201d sign on the door this bright autumn morning, and one building over a crew is painting the ancient fire escapes. The whole block smells of solvent, sharp and clean. It\u2019s a well-kept street of five- and six-story apartment houses in a tidy neighborhood of working-class folks who greet each other on the sidewalk, black and white and brown, Latin American and Caribbean immigrants and Great Migration African-Americans and, like the rest of New York, folks from all over.\n\nYoung as he was, Lymon had three wives. He married them in quick succession, and there was plenty of confusion about the paperwork. He may have been married to more than one at a time, or not entirely married to one of the three at all. One of them may have still been married to someone else. Depends whom you ask. (In the 1980s, they all met in court, to settle Lymon\u2019s estate, such as it was, to find out who was entitled to songwriting royalties from best sellers like \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d None got much, but the third wife, Emira Eagle, received an undisclosed settlement from record producers.)\n\nIn 1966, there was a brief glimmer of hope. Fresh out of rehab at Manhattan General Hospital, Lymon appeared at a block party organized by a group of nuns at a Catholic settlement house in the Bronx. He told an audience of 2,000 teenagers, \u201cI have been born again. I\u2019m not ashamed to let the public know I took the cure. Maybe my story will keep some other kid from going wrong.\u201d\n\nOn February 27, 1968, he was booked for a recording session to mark the start of a comeback. Instead, he was found dead that morning on his grandmother\u2019s bathroom floor.\n\n**********\n\nFrankie Lymon was buried in the Bronx, at St. Raymond\u2019s Cemetery: Row 13, Grave 70. It\u2019s 15 minutes by car from the old neighborhood. His headstone is over by the highway. The grass is green and the ground is hard and uneven and on the left his stone is packed tight with the others. On the right there\u2019s a gap like a missing tooth. You can see the towers of two bridges from here, the Bronx-Whitestone and Throgs Neck, and hear the traffic rush past on the Cross Bronx Expressway. Billie Holiday is buried here, and Typhoid Mary. This is where the Lindbergh ransom exchange happened. The wind comes hard off Eastchester Bay and shakes the pagoda trees.\n\nFor years Frankie\u2019s grave was unmarked. In the mid-1980s, a New Jersey music store held a benefit to raise money for a memorial, but it never made it to the cemetery. The headstone gathered dust in the record shop, then moved at last to the backyard of a friend of the owner.\n\nEmira Eagle had the current headstone installed sometime in the late 1990s.In Loving Memory\n\nOf My Husband Frank J. Lymon Sept. 30, 1942 \u2013 Feb. 27, 1968\n\nNot much room to tell his story. And what could anyone say? That the 1950s were long over? That innocence was dead? That by 1968 one America had vanished entirely, and another had taken its place?\n\nOr maybe that Frankie Lymon\u2019s America, doo-wop America, was never simple, never sweet, but was rather an America as complex and wracked by animus and desire as any in history. It was the same America that killed Emmett Till, after all, another angel-faced kid with apple cheeks and a wide, bright smile.\n\nSeen across the gulf of years, what we now think of as the anodyne, antiseptic 1950s America is revealed as an illusion. June Cleaver vacuuming in an organdy cocktail dress and pearls is a television mirage, a national hallucination. We had the postwar world economy to ourselves because so many other industrial nations had been bombed flat. And for every Pat Boone there was a \u201cHowl,\u201d an Allen Ginsberg, a Kerouac, a Coltrane, a Krassner, a Ferlinghetti. There were underground explosions in painting and poetry and music and prose. It was a kind of invisible revolution.\n\nA telling detail of that chaste 1950s mythology: to preserve his image as a clean-cut teenager, Frankie Lymon would pass off the women he dated in different cities as his mother. It gets told and told and told\u2014in fact, he told it himself\u2014that he once got caught by a reporter who went to shows in New York and Chicago and saw that his \u201cmom\u201d was two different women, each twice Frankie\u2019s age. A story too good to fact-check.\n\nIt was in these 1950s that Ralph Ellison wrote Invisible Man, and James Baldwin published Notes of a Native Son. After Rosa Parks was pulled off that bus, Dr. King led the Montgomery bus boycott and changed the trajectory of civil rights in America. The Supreme Court decided Brown v. Board of Education, and then came Little Rock and the lunch counter sit-ins at Wichita and Oklahoma City. What you saw of the \u201950s in America was all about where you stood. And with whom.\n\nWas the short, blinding arc of Frankie Lymon\u2019s career a morality play? A rock \u2019n\u2019 roll cautionary tale? Or just another story of a young man gone too soon?\n\nMaybe it was a reminder that America changes in every instant and never changes at all. Our streets have always been filled with music and temptation; addiction has always been with us, long before \u201cus\u201d was even America, from the Lotus Eaters of The Odyssey to the opium dens of the Wild West to the crack epidemic and on to our own new opioid crisis.\n\nLooking at that headstone, you get to thinking maybe Frankie Lymon was the 1950s, man and myth, the junkie with an angel\u2019s voice, and that the stone stands as a monument to the lies we tell ourselves about America in the time before Frankie flew away.\n\nThe very night Lymon died Walter Cronkite went on the air and said of Vietnam, \u201cWe are mired in a stalemate.\u201d It was clear the center couldn\u2019t hold, and if you felt like the 1950s were five polite young men in matching letter sweaters, the rest of 1968 came at you like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The world lurched and suddenly spun too fast. Tet. My Lai. Chicago. Washington. Baltimore. Riots everywhere. Vietnam the pulse and drumbeat behind and beneath everything.\n\nSo when Frankie Lymon died that February morning you\u2019d have been forgiven for missing it. He was nearly forgotten by then, a five-paragraph item on page 50 of the New York Times, a casualty of the moment the future and the past came apart.\n\nIt was sad, but for a while, arms wide and head back, Frankie Lymon had bridged and bound all those opposing energies. That face! That voice!\n\nMan, he could sing like an angel.\n\nGet the latest History stories in your inbox?

The members were Frankie Lymon (b. Sept. 30, 1942, New York, N.Y., U.S.\u2014d. Feb. 28, 1968, New York), Herman Santiago (b. Feb. 18, 1941, New York), Jimmy Merchant (b. Feb. 10, 1940, New York), Joe Negroni (b. Sept. 9, 1940, New York\u2014d. Sept. 5, 1978, New York), and Sherman Garnes (b. June 8, 1940, New York\u2014d. Feb. 26, 1977, New York).\n\nThe broad-based success of this vocal ensemble helped signal the emergence of rock and roll as a part of mainstream teenage culture. The prepubescent soprano of 13-year-old lead singer Lymon, sounding innocent and girlish, represented one of the most appealing sounds in early rock and roll, and many later pop groups would feature a preteen male lead, most notably the Jackson 5. The Teenagers\u2019 first successful record, \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall In Love\u201d (1956), was followed by five more singles that appeared on the national survey lists of the most popular records in the United States. The Teenagers also appeared in two popular rock-and-roll movies starring disc jockey Alan Freed, Rock, Rock, Rock (1956) and Mister Rock and Roll (1957).\n\nIn 1957 Lymon left the group to launch a solo career, which failed when his changed adult voice, an unremarkable tenor, proved to have diminished commercial appeal. Long afflicted by a substance abuse problem, Lymon died in 1968 from a drug overdose. He and the group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993."}, {"url": "https://www.goldradiouk.com/features/frankie-lymon-life-death-marriages/", "page_content": "Frankie Lymon facts: Life, and tragic death of The Teenagers star and 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love' teen idol\n\nFrankie Lymon and the Teenagers in Streetlight Harmonies\n\nBy Mayer Nissim\n\nFrankie Lymon was the leader of the first all-teen hit rock 'n' roll band, but his short life spiralled into tragedy.\n\nListen to this article Loading audio...\n\nRock 'n' roll was always a teen phenomenon, but while most of the fans lapping up the new sound were that age, many of those putting out the records were well into their 20s and beyond.\n\nThat wasn't the case for Frankie Lymon & The Teenagers. Frankie was the baby of the group, just 13 when they released their debut single, and his four bandmates were all aged 15 or 16.\n\nWith their of-the-moment sound mashing up doo-wop and rock 'n' roll to their racially integrated lineup (Frankie, Jimmy Merchant and Sherman Garnes were Black, Joe Negroni and Herman Santiago were Puerto Rican), The Teenagers were groundbreaking.\n\nThey exploded on to the scene with 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love', which remained their biggest single, before the hits dried up all-too swiftly.\n\nFrankie Lymon left the group, but his solo career failed to launch. He had struggles in his personal life, and tragically died at the age of 25 after a drug overdose. Below, we mourn teen idol Frankie Lymon, while celebrating his life and legacy.\n\nWhen was Frankie Lymon born and how did he join the Teenagers?\n\nFrankie Lymon was born to truck driver dad Howard and maid mum Jeanette on September 30, 1942 in Harlem, New York\n\nSinging was very much in Frankie's blood, as both his parents sang together in gospel group The Harlemaires.\n\nFrankie and his brothers Lewis and Howie sang with Harlemaire Juniors, while Frankie worked as a grocery boy from the age of 10.\n\nWhen he was just 12 Frankie became friends with Herman Santiago, the lead singer of local doo-wop group the Coupe De Villes, having first heard them at a school talent show.\n\nHe went on to join the group that became known as The Ermines, The Premiers and eventually The Teenagers.\n\nHow did Frankie Lymon end up fronting The Teenagers?\n\nFrankie Lymon and The Teenagers. Picture: Getty Images\n\nWith his stunning boy soprano voice, it seems obvious that Frankie Lymon would be the frontman (front-boy?) of The Teenagers, but it didn't start that way.\n\nAs said, it was Santiago who was leading the group when Lymon joined, but that all changed quickly.\n\nAfter impressing The Valentines singer Richard Barrett, The Teenagers got an audition with producer George Goldner. Santiago turned up late, Lymon stepped up and said he could take his place.\n\nFrom then on, the group was effectively Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers.\n\nDid Frankie Lymon write 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love'?\n\nFrankie Lymon & The Teenagers - Why Do Fools Fall In Love (Mastered HD)\n\n'Why Do Fools Fall in Love' was the debut single from The Teenagers, their signature song, and their biggest hit.\n\nIt topped the US R&B Chart, went to number 6 on the pop chart, and incredibly went all the way to number one in the UK singles chart, too.\n\nIt's endured to this day, and has also been covered by The Diamonds in 1956, the Beach Boys in 1964 and Diana Ross in 1981.\n\nAs for who wrote the classic song, it's a little bit complicated.\n\nHerman Santiago had written the basic song called 'Why Do Birds Sing So Gay?' for the audition with producer and Gee Records boss George Goldner, basing the words on some love letters given to the group by a tenant in bassist Sherman Garnes' apartment building.\n\nGoldner suggested some tweaks to the lyrics, while Frankie improvised and tweaked the melody.\n\nSo on the first pressings, the song was attributed to Frankie Lymon, Herman Santiago, and George Goldner.\n\nAfter a while, Santiago's name was mysteriously dropped from the label. Then, after Goldner was bought out by Morris Levy his name was swapped in for the producers.\n\nA lengthy court battle saw Santiago and Jimmy Merchant being given songwriting credit in 1992, but further legal issues meant that this was overturned four years later.\n\nWhat happened to Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers after 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love'?\n\nFrankie Lymon & The Teenagers - I'm not a Juvenile Delinquent (1956) - HD\n\nFrankie Lymon and The Teenagers are best known for their stunning number one single, but they were far from one hit wonders.\n\nBefore 1956 was out they had a string of charting singles: 'I Want You to Be My Girl', 'I Promise to Remember' and 'The ABC's of Love' were all top ten R&B hits and all reached the pop Top 100 too.\n\nIn the UK, 'I'm Not a Juvenile Delinquent' went to number 12. Even into 1957, 'Out in the Cold Again' reached number 10 in the R&B charts.\n\nBy then though, the Teenagers were beginning to fall apart,\n\nWhen did Frankie Lymon leave The Teenagers and what happened to his solo career?\n\nFrankie Lymon \"Goody Goody\" on The Ed Sullivan Show\n\nAs is so often the case when one of a group has the main billing, there was pressure to push Frankie Lymon into a solo career.\n\nGoldner especially was advocating for a solo Frankie, giving the lead singer solo spots during their live show at the London Palladium and having him sing to pre-recorded backing tapes.\n\nIn fact, while it was credited to Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers, the group's last official single 'Goody Goody' (with 'Creation of Love' on the flip) was effectively a solo Frankie single with session singers.\n\nFrankie formally left the band in September 1957, and the planned Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers at the London Palladium LP was released as the solo Frankie Lymon \u2013 At The London Palladium.\n\nFrankie Lymon \"Little Bitty Pretty One\"\n\nSadly, Frankie failed to capture the magic and success of the Teenagers as a solo star.\n\nHis move to Roulette Records may not have helped, nor would an apparently \"scandalous\" incident when he danced with a white girl during his performance on Alan Freed's live ABC TV show The Big Beat on July 19, 1957, prompting protests from racist Southern TV station owners\n\nAlong with his personal troubles, the incident caused his career to stall. As the years continued he had brief record deals with 20th Century Fox Records and Columbia Records, but he failed to have a chart hit.\n\nHe even reunited with the Teenagers in 1965, but without success.\n\nWhat happened to The Teenagers after Lymon's departure?\n\nTeenagers - Why Do Fools Fall In Love\n\nAs well as Lymon's career failing to take off after he left the group, The Teenagers never really successfully replaced him.\n\nThe first replacement was Billy Lobrano, the first white member of the group. Meanwhile Sherman Garnes and Joe Negroni died in the late 1970s and were replaced by Bobby Jay and Frankie's brother Lewis Lymon.\n\nIn the 1980s the group experimented with female singers, including Pearl McKinnon and Roz Morehead, before Jimmy Castor and then Timothy Wilson took lead.\n\nCurrently touring as Frankie Lymon's Legendary Teenagers or The Legendary Teenagers, the group still plays today with the current lineup being Herman Santiago, Bobby Jay, Terry King and Terrance Farward.\n\nWas Frankie Lymon married?\n\nFrankie Lymon and DJ Murray The K Kauffman. Picture: Getty Images\n\nFrankie Lymon's personal life was complicated to say the least.\n\nHe married his first wife Elizabeth Mickey Waters in January 1964. Technically though, this marriage was never legal because she was still married to her previous husband.\n\nThey had a daughter together \u2013 Frankie's only child \u2013 but Francine tragically died just two days after being born.\n\nAfter his first \"marriage\" failed, Frankie is then said to have wed The Platters singer Zola Taylor in Mexico in 1965. To this day, no-one has found any documentation of the wedding though, and it's been claimed that the whole story was a joke or publicity stunt.\n\nThe Platters - He's Mine (1957)\n\nLymon's third and final wedding came to schoolteacher Emira Eagle. The couple married in June 1967, but it's worth noting that Frankie hadn't actually divorced either of his two wives before.\n\nThe complex swirl of legal and illegal weddings that may or may not have happened caused issues long after Lymon's death, when Diana Ross's successful cover of 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love' sparked a scramble for Frankie's royalties.\n\nHow and when did Frankie Lymon die?\n\nFrankie Lymon and the Teenagers - I Promise To Remember (1983)\n\nFrankie Lymon told Ebony magazine in 1967 that he had been introduced to heroin a woman twice his age when he was just 15, and he swiftly became addicted.\n\n\"I looked twice my age,\" Lymon said. \"I was thin as a shadow and I didn't give a damn. My only concern was in getting relief.\n\n\"You know, an addict is the most pathetic creature on earth. He knows that every time he sticks a needle in his arm, he's gambling with death and, yet, he's got to have it. It\u2019s like playing Russian Roulette with a spike.\"\n\nHis deepening dependency surely affected his performing and recording career, though he entered rehab in 1961 and attempted a comeback.\n\nLymon appeared at the Apollo as part of a revue and recorded some singles, but nothing really took off.\n\nBy 1966 he was in trouble again, being arrested on a heroin charge. Instead of going to jail, he was drafted in the US army, but after going AWOL he was discharged.\n\nFrankie Lyman - I'm Sorry - (Big Apple)\n\nThe army did the trick though, briefly. Lymon is said to have remained drug-free for two full years after being drafted.\n\nIn 1968 though, he was told a major promotion had been arranged with CHO Associates. He had a recording session booked. Lymon \"celebrated\" the news by injecting the drug while staying at his grandmother's house in Harlem.\n\nOn February 27, 1968 \u2013 the day he was meant to be in the studio Lymon was found dead on the floor of his grandmother's bathroom. He had died of a heroin overdose with a syringe by his side. He was only 25.\n\nLymon was buried at Saint Raymond's Cemetery in the Throggs Neck section of The Bronx.\n\nWhat was Frankie Lymon's legacy?\n\nJoni Mitchell - Why Do Fools Fall In Love\n\nDespite dying at such a young age and only really being an active recording artist for a few short years, Frankie Lymon had a massive impact on the emerging pop and rock 'n' roll scene.\n\nAs we already noted, both The Beach Boys and Diana Ross showed their love for Frankie with their covers of his biggest hit.\n\nOther artists who have namechecked The Teenagers include Ronnie Spector, The Temptations, The Chantels, Smokey Robinson, Billy Joel and George Clinton.\n\nThe influence of Frankie and The Teenagers on Michael Jackson and The Jackson 5 is as clear as day, as well as all of Berry Gordy's other Motown bands and stables.\n\nWhy Do Fools Fall in Love movie trailer\n\nFrankie's influence went beyond the most obvious, with Joni Mitchell covering 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love', and artists as diverse as The Fall, Everything but the Girl and The Mountain Goats, referencing Frankie in their songs 'No X-mas for John Quays', 'Boxing and Pop Music' and 'Harlem Roulette', respectively,.\n\nFrankie's legacy was cemented with the 1998 biopic called (of course) Why Do Fools Fall in Love, which starred Larenz Tate as Frankie Lymon, Halle Berry as Zola Taylor, Vivica A. Fox as Elizabeth Waters and Lela Rochon as Emira Eagle.\n\nThe Teenagers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993."}, {"url": "https://www.bunkhistory.org/resources/2063", "page_content": "\u2026\n\nAmerica in the 1950s: postwar economy roaring, a chicken in every pot and two cars in every garage of the split-level house in Levittown, every clich\u00e9 of union-made American middle-class prosperity held to be self-evident.\n\nAnd music was a big part of that.

The group's success inspired the formation of a number of youthful black vocal groups, from the Students in the late '50s to the Jackson Five in the '60s. The group's sound influenced young singers such as Ronnie Bennett and Diana Ross, and served as prototype for both the girl groups and early Motown groups of the '60s.\n\n\n\nMembers:\n\nFrankie Lymon - lead\n\nHerman Santiago - first tenor\n\nJimmy Merchant - second tenor\n\nJoe Negroni - baritone\n\nSherman Gaines - bass\n\nAfter forming several short term vocal groups, two black students from Edward D. Stitt Junior High School in the Washington Heights section of New York city, Jimmy Merchant and Sherman Garnes recruited neighborhood Puerto Ricans Herman Santiago and Joe Negroni for the group. They called themselves the Premiers and hoped some day to make a record.\n\n\n\nRichard Barrett\n\nThe Premiers were working on a song they had written called \"Why Do Birds Sing So Gay\" and needed a high tenor. Richard Barrett, a member of the Valentines, lived above the grocery store where Frankie Lymon worked part time. Through him they got together with Lymon who suggested changing the focus of the song and it's title. The song would be known as \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love\"\n\n\n\nGeorge Goldner\n\nThe Valentines were under contract to Rama Records owned by George Goldner. Barrett a talent scout for Goldner arranged an audition. Goldner was impressed. At subsequent recording sessions bandleader Jimmy Wright suggested a name change to the Teenagers to reflect the members ages.\n\nEarly February, 1956 \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\" was released. With Lymon on boyish soprano lead, the song became an instant smash on Gee Records. The song was subsequently covered by the Diamonds and Gale Storm, but unlike most songs rendered by white artists, the original proved to be the biggest hit. The Teenagers were on their way.\n\nSporting a clean-cut wholesome image, the appeal of the Teenagers was their youth. On stage they were very energetic. The group was well choreographed by Cholly Atkins who would go onto greater fame with the Temptations. The Teenagers were packaged so as not to upset middle lass American parents. They even appeared in letter sweaters.\n\nMarch, 1956 they were booked by Alan Freed in one of his rock and roll reviews at the Brooklyn Paramount. They appeared with the Platters and Bill Haley and His Comets. A second single \"I Want You To Be My Girl\" was released in April. A week later they appeared on CBS-TV's Shower of Stars. By the end of April they were touring with \"The Biggest Rock and Roll Show of 1956\"\n\n\n\nPhoto from the film Rock, Rock, Rock.\n\nIn August production was begun on a movie called Rock. Rock, Rock in which the Teenagers made a cameo appearance. In September they appeared on Alan Freed's radio show. While headlining the Apollo \"ABC's of Love\" was released. After that they went back to Hollywood to film a cameo for Don't Knock the Rock. In late September they began a tour with Bill Haley that lasted until late November. In November their fifth single \"Baby, Baby\" was released and their first album Meet the Teenagers was released in December. The Teenagers were enrolled in the School for Professionals. and on the road they took correspondence courses and had traveling tutors. However, they were falling behind in their education and the group stayed at home the first of months of 1957. During this time \"Paper Castles\" was released\n\nAfter appearing in a carnival in Panama in March they began a three month tour of England beginning at the London Palladium. While in London, the Teenagers recorded a second album Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers at the London Palladium.\n\nGeorge Goldner had been trying to convince Lymon to go solo and after the success in Great Britain he agreed to do so. On Alan Freed's weekly television show in July Lymon appeared solo. \"Goody Goody,\" his the last record with the Teenager was released in July.\n\nIn September Lymon began an 80 day tour with the Biggest Show Stars for 1957 as a solo act. His first record without the Teenagers, \"My Girl\" was released.. In November Lymon's \"Little Girl\" appeared on Roulette and the Teenagers \"Flip-Flop\" on Gee\n\nJanuary 1958 Lymon released \"Thumb, Thumb\" Lymon and the Teenagers reunited to sing \"Goody Goody\" on Dick Clark's \"American Bandstand. In June he appeared with the Coasters at the Apollo Theater.\n\n\n\nLeft to right Joe Negroni, Billy Lobrano, Sherman Garnes,\n\nJimmy Merchant, and Herman Santiago\n\nLosing his youthful soprano voice, at the age of fifteen Lymon's career was in decline. After the initial success of the first two records sales had slipped with each release. \"Goody, Goody\" was the last record by Lymon or the Teenagers to have any significant sales.\n\nLymon had experimented with drugs since 1958. On June 21, 1966 he was arrested on a heroin charge. Lymon entered the army in lieu of a jail sentence but, received a less then honorable discharge a short time later. He moved to Fort Gordon, Georgia where he married a local school teacher Emira Eagle and stayed in the Augusta area appearing at a local lounge. In mid-February he told his wife he had a weekend job in New York. On February 27, 1968 he died in the same house he had grown up in with an empty syringe by his side.\n\nAs with most young performers of the era, the Teenagers lost rights to their material. Goldner's publishing firm had handled the song, taking fifty percent off the top. Originally Frankie Lymon, Herman Santiago and George Goldner were listed as \"Why Do fools Fall In Love\" composers. Santiago's name was soon dropped and in the mid-sixties Lymon and Goldner sold off their rights to the song. Goldner allegedly to pay gambling debts and Lymon for money to buy drugs.\n\nIn 1984, on behalf of Emira Lymon, a lawyer and artist's agent sued to wrest the copyright away from the current owner. The case became confused when it looked like Lymon had a second and possibly a third widow. Elizabeth Waters claimed to have married Lymon in 1964 in Virginia. However, it turned out she had been married to someone else at the time. As Water's claim went to court, Zola Taylor ex-member of the Platters, claimed that she had been sexually active with Lymon as early as the \"Biggest Rock \"n\" Roll Show of 1956\" tour. She claimed to have married Lymon in Tijuana about 1965, but could produce no certificate. The first hearing, held in Philadelphia, was decided in favor of Miss Waters being Lymon's first wife. Emira appealed and won a reversal based on her claim that she was Lymon's last wife.\n\nHerman Santiago and Jimmy Merchant also pursued their claim to the songs rights in federal court. In December, 1992, the two singers and Emira Lymon, received complete rights to the song.\n\nBy 1980, Sherman Garnes (heart attack) and Joe Negroni (cerebral hemmrage) had both died when the remaining Teenagers decided to rebuild the group. Santiago and Merchant performed with Garnes' brother, while the high tenor parts were handled by Pearl McKinnon of the Kodiaks, and later by Frankie's brother, Lewis Lymon\n\nFrankie Lymon has been called the \"father\" of the girl group sound. He was a direct influence on Arlene Smith of the Chantels, Little Anthony and the Imperials, and the Isley Brothers, all who recorded for George Goldner.\n\nFrankie Lymon and the Teenagers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://face2faceafrica.com/article/a-junkie-with-an-angels-voice-the-tragic-tale-of-teen-idol-frankie-lymon-who-died-from-heroin-overdose12", "page_content": "Frankie Lymon was America\u2019s first black teenage pop star but by 1968, aged a mere 25 years, he was found dead from a heroin overdose in the same apartment building where he\u2019d grown up. Lymon\u2019s fate is tragic in that he was ill equipped to manage the fame that found him.\n\nLymon and the Teenagers, five kids from Washington Heights, just north of Harlem sang doo-wop under the streetlight on the corner of 165th and Amsterdam were discovered by the Valentines\u2019 lead singer Richie Barrett. Months later in 1956, their first record, \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d made it to the top of the national charts.\n\nThe Teenagers comprised three African-American members, Frankie Lymon, Jimmy Merchant, and Sherman Garnes; and two Puerto Rican members, Joe Negroni and Herman Santiago.\n\nAt 13, Frankie Lymon became the hottest singer in America overnight with a world tour to boot. Lymon by that feat was a founding father of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. His voice and style influenced two generations of rock, soul and R&B giants.\n\nThere\u2019s even talk Berry Gordy may have modeled the Jackson 5 on Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers. \u201cI never was a child, although I was billed in every theater and auditorium where I appeared as a child star,\u201d Lymon told Art Peters, a reporter for Ebony magazine, in 1967. \u201cI was a man when I was 11 years old, doing everything that most men do. In the neighborhood where I lived, there was no time to be a child. There were five children in my family and my folks had to scuffle to make ends meet. My father was a truck driver and my mother worked as a domestic in white folks\u2019 homes. While kids my age were playing stickball and marbles, I was working in the corner grocery store carrying orders to help pay the rent.\u201d\n\nInterestingly just a few days before Frankie and his friends recorded the song that made them famous, Rosa Parks was pulled off a bus in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nThe 1950s American postwar economy was booming and music was part of that. Lymon told Ebony \u201cWe harmonized every night on the street corner until the neighbors would call the cops to run us away.\u201d\n\nBut that friendship will take a hit when Lymon and his record producers agreed he\u2019d be a more profitable solo act, so the Teenagers were ditched. They landed another hit in \u201cGoody Goody,\u201d earlier done by Bob Crosby and Ella Fitzgerald. When Lymon went solo in mid-1957, both his career and that of the Teenagers fell into decline. Their union lasted for a brief 18-month period.\n\nFrom here, the tide changed. Lymon was a heroin addict at 15 years old and despite his best efforts to straighten out, he relapsed. It didn\u2019t help when his mother died.\n\n\u201cI looked twice my age,\u201d Lymon told Ebony. \u201cI was thin as a shadow and I didn\u2019t give a damn. My only concern was in getting relief. You know, an addict is the most pathetic creature on earth. He knows that every time he sticks a needle in his arm, he\u2019s gambling with death and, yet, he\u2019s got to have it. It\u2019s like playing Russian Roulette with a spike. There\u2019s always the danger that some peddler will sell him a poisoned batch\u2014some garbage.\u201d Here young Frankie knocks on wood. \u201cI was lucky. God must have been watching over me.\u201d\n\nIn 1966, fresh out of rehab at Manhattan General Hospital, Lymon appeared at a block party organized by a group of nuns at a Catholic settlement house in the Bronx. He told an audience of 2,000 teenagers, \u201cI have been born again. I\u2019m not ashamed to let the public know I took the cure. Maybe my story will keep some other kid from going wrong.\u201d\n\nOn February 27, 1968, he was booked for a recording session to mark the start of a comeback. Instead, he was found dead that morning on his grandmother\u2019s bathroom floor. He was buried in the Bronx, at St. Raymond\u2019s Cemetery but for years, Lymon\u2019s grave was unmarked until Emira Eagle, his third wife had the current headstone installed sometime in the late 1990s.\n\nFame has its gifts and young as Lymon was, he had three wives. He married them in quick succession, and there was plenty of confusion about the paperwork about who was entitled to songwriting royalties from his best sellers. None got much, but the third wife, Emira Eagle, received an undisclosed settlement from record producers.\n\nIt was also said that to preserve his image as a clean-cut teenager, Frankie Lymon would pass off the women he dated in different cities as his mother except keen observers noted different women emerged as mothers in various cities. He sang for Queen Elizabeth II at the London Palladium and performed in nightclubs and theaters worldwide. Lymon also served as an Army private at Fort Gordon.\n\nFrankie Lymon who could sing like an angel but was a troubled soul influenced Diana Ross, Smokey Robinson, Len Barry and Michael Jackson as well as a host of other singers."}, {"url": "https://news.amomama.com/278609-teen-idol-frankie-lymon-had-married-3-wo.html", "page_content": "Getty Images\n\nFormer child star Frankie Lymon became famous at a very young age, but he seemed to bite off more than he could chew.

Those apple cheeks! Arms wide, head back, he radiates joy, even in antique black and white. That beautiful soprano flying high, talent and presence and just enough ham to sell it all. And it was a great story, too: Up from nothing! A shooting star! So when they found Frankie Lymon dead at the age of 25 one February morning in 1968, in the same apartment building where he\u2019d grown up, it was the end of something and the beginning of something, but no one was quite sure what.\n\nFrankie Lymon and the Teenagers were five kids from Washington Heights, just north of Harlem. They sang doo-wop under the streetlight on the corner of 165th and Amsterdam. They were discovered by the Valentines\u2019 lead singer Richie Barrett while the kids were rehearsing in an apartment house. A few months later their first record, \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d made it to the top of the national charts. It was 1956. Overnight, Frankie Lymon was the hottest singer in America, off on a world tour. He was 13 years old.\n\nThat made him the first black teenage pop star, a gap-toothed, baby-faced, angel-voiced paragon of show business ambition, and a camera-ready avatar of America\u2019s new postwar youth movement. He was a founding father of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll even before his voice had changed. That voice and that style influenced two generations of rock, soul and R&B giants. You heard his echoes everywhere. The high, clear countertenor, like something out of Renaissance church music, found its way from the Temptations to the Beach Boys to Earth, Wind & Fire. Even Diana Ross charted a cover of \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d 25 years after its release. Berry Gordy may not have modeled the Jackson 5 on Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, as is often said, but it sure sounded as if he had.\n\nThat\u2019s the legend, anyway. Truth is, Frankie Lymon grew up too fast in every way imaginable. \u201cI never was a child, although I was billed in every theater and auditorium where I appeared as a child star,\u201d Lymon told Art Peters, a reporter for Ebony magazine, in 1967. \u201cI was a man when I was 11 years old, doing everything that most men do. In the neighborhood where I lived, there was no time to be a child. There were five children in my family and my folks had to scuffle to make ends meet. My father was a truck driver and my mother worked as a domestic in white folks\u2019 homes. While kids my age were playing stickball and marbles, I was working in the corner grocery store carrying orders to help pay the rent.\u201d\n\nA few days before Frankie and his friends from the corner recorded the song that made them famous, Rosa Parks was pulled off a bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Less than two years later, Frankie danced with a white girl on a national television show, and the show was swiftly canceled. Another part of the legend.\n\nRace integration in pop music was never going to be simple.\n\n**********\n\nAmerica in the 1950s: postwar economy roaring, a chicken in every pot and two cars in every garage of the split-level house in Levittown, every clich\u00e9 of union-made American middle-class prosperity held to be self-evident.\n\nAnd music was a big part of that. Raucous and brawny, electrified, it felt like Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis all fell from the sky at once. Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, with their tight, upbeat harmony, were an important part of it, too. You can trace doo-wop back to the Psalms, hear it bubble up in the a cappella harmonies of Gregorian chant, or, by way of Africa and the Caribbean, from gospel quartets.\n\nIn America, beginning in the 1930s, the Mills Brothers and the Ink Spots were the popularizers of those intricate harmonies we recognize today as proto-rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. Doo-wop was among the inheritors, a thousand street-corner groups and a thousand one-hit wonders. The Spaniels and the Five Satins and the Vocaleers, the Drifters and the Fleetwoods and the Moonglows, the Coasters and the Platters and on to Frankie Valli and modernity. In the 1950s, every high school stairwell in this country was loud with four-part singing. Even today the \u201cPitch Perfect\u201d movie franchise owes its popularity to an a cappella tradition stretching back into pre-electric history.\n\n\u201cWe harmonized every night on the street corner until the neighbors would call the cops to run us away,\u201d Lymon told Ebony. But Frankie wasn\u2019t doo-wop, not really. Doo-wop was group music. \u201cFrankie Lymon was always different than that,\u201d Robert Christgau, great-granddaddy of American rock critics and historians, will tell you. \u201cHe was the star.\u201d\n\nFrankie and his record producers and managers soon agreed he\u2019d be a more profitable solo act, so off he went, leaving behind the Teenagers, and with them friendship and loyalty. He had another, lesser, hit\u2014a recording of \u201cGoody Goody,\u201d sung by Bob Crosby and Ella Fitzgerald before him\u2014before things cooled.\n\nThen came the long, slow slide.\n\nAsk any junkie and they\u2019ll tell what they\u2019re chasing is the feeling they got the first time they got high. But that first-time rush can never be recaptured, whether you\u2019re talking about heroin or cigarettes or hit records.\n\nFrankie was a heroin addict at 15 years old. He tried to kick, tried again and again and got straight for a while. Then his mother died, and he fell hard.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t alone. Heroin was everywhere in New York by then, and methadone clinics run by the city were springing up in neighborhoods all over town. The failure rate was heartbreaking.\n\n\u201cI looked twice my age,\u201d Lymon told Ebony. \u201cI was thin as a shadow and I didn\u2019t give a damn. My only concern was in getting relief. You know, an addict is the most pathetic creature on earth. He knows that every time he sticks a needle in his arm, he\u2019s gambling with death and, yet, he\u2019s got to have it.

God must have been watching over me.\u201d\n\nEven now you want to believe him.\n\n**********\n\nFrankie\u2019s neighborhood, just up the bluffs from the long-gone Polo Grounds, feels mostly unchanged even 50 years later. It was poorer then, sure, like the rest of New York City, and in the age before earbuds and headphones it was surely louder. You heard music in the streets.\n\nOutside Frankie\u2019s old address, on West 165th, there\u2019s a \u201cWet Paint\u201d sign on the door this bright autumn morning, and one building over a crew is painting the ancient fire escapes. The whole block smells of solvent, sharp and clean. It\u2019s a well-kept street of five- and six-story apartment houses in a tidy neighborhood of working-class folks who greet each other on the sidewalk, black and white and brown, Latin American and Caribbean immigrants and Great Migration African-Americans and, like the rest of New York, folks from all over.\n\nYoung as he was, Lymon had three wives. He married them in quick succession, and there was plenty of confusion about the paperwork. He may have been married to more than one at a time, or not entirely married to one of the three at all. One of them may have still been married to someone else. Depends whom you ask. (In the 1980s, they all met in court, to settle Lymon\u2019s estate, such as it was, to find out who was entitled to songwriting royalties from best sellers like \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d None got much, but the third wife, Emira Eagle, received an undisclosed settlement from record producers.)"}, {"url": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/1998/08/28/frankie-lymon-one-teen-idol-three-wives/", "page_content": "It\u2019s a tribute to the mess Frankie Lymon left of his life that no filmmaker would touch it for 30 years.\n\nLymon, sometimes called the first black teen idol, overdosed in 1968 at age 25.\n\nHis death sets in motion the events that drive Why Do Fools Fall in Love, Hollywood\u2019s first try at Lymon\u2019s tangled history. Named for his best-known, most legally disputed song, Fools carries the burden of blazing that trail with a brashness Lymon himself might have admired.\n\nPlayfully biographical, Fools takes a grand, technicolor tour of the Lymon era. But it opens as a domestic farce set in a courtroom, where three widows and their lawyers battle over rights to the legacy of a husband they unknowingly shared.\n\nGlamorous singer Zola Taylor (Halle Berry), streetwise survivor Elizabeth Waters (Vivica A. Fox) and God-fearing schoolteacher Emira Eagle (Lela Rochon) each take the stand to describe her Frankie.\n\nThe movie plays for its biggest laughs in the squabbling amongst wives, which sometimes gets shrill. Berry, Fox and Rochon give strong, varied performances in roles that take them from youth to middle age. But director Gregory Nava (Selena, El Norte) indulges a little too much purse-swinging. The humor is subtler and richer when the movie explores, in less combative ways, how differently each woman experienced the same man.\n\nThere is literally a parade of witnesses: the widows; the outrageous Little Richard, as himself; Lymon\u2019s unscrupulous producer, Morris Levy (Paul Mazursky).

Musical performances make up some of this movie\u2019s most blissful moments, and actor Larenz Tate (Dead Presidents) brings Lymon the performer to life with startling clarity. It\u2019s a larger-than-life portrayal: an archetype. Every turn of Tate\u2019s head, every sharp-toed whirl and singing smile, reflects how a charming and talented kid from a broken home not only loved performing: He needed it.\n\nTate is just as convincing living out the down side \u2013 Lymon\u2019s slide into poverty, heroin abuse, deranged self-pity and, for good measure, bigamy (trigamy, as Fox, wife No. 2, tartly calls it).\n\nFools is about each woman\u2019s search for peace and, yes, a little prosperity in the wake of Lymon\u2019s death. But like the women themselves, the movie can\u2019t help but acknowledge how Lymon overpowers every narrative in which he figures.

Lymon befriended Herman Santiago, lead singer of Coupe De Villes, and joined the latter\u2019s group that became The Premieres. When the Premieres became The Teenagers, they were still in the process of creating a song called \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall In Love?\u201d It eventually became a bonafide hit in 1956 and it is still appreciated by fans of oldies music fans up to this day. When Lymon went solo, both of his and his former band\u2019s fortunes began to slide. Lymon struggled in his solo career, coupled with personal troubles and heroin addiction; he would eventually die of heroin overdose in 1968, aged just 25. The Teenagers, after Lymon\u2019s departure from the band, went several lineup changes, including hiring a white singer named Billy Lobrano. None of these moves, not even the band\u2019s brief reunion with Lymon in the mid-60s, could re-kindle their early success. However, the group soldiered on, and the new lineup are now performing as \u201cFrankie Lymon\u2019s Legendary Teenagers.\u201d\n\nMeet Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers\n\nAmerican doo wop group Frankie and the Teenagers gained commercial success with the transatlantic hit \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall In Love\u201d during the mid-50s music era. They were the first-ever racially-integrated group.\n\nFormed in 1954 in Harlem, New York, the group comprised of Jimmy Merchant, Herman Santiago (born February 18, 1941 in San Juan, Puerto Rico), Joe Negroni (b. September 9, 1940, New York City, New York), Sherman Garnes, and lead singer Frankie Lymon (born Frankie Joseph Lymon, b. September 30, 1942, Harlem, New York \u2013 d. February 27, 1968). Lymon was only 13 years old when he fronted the group.\n\nAt the age of 12, Lymon was already performing as a gospel singer in his father\u2019s group. Subsequently, he switched to secular music and became a part of the Premiers which was later called as the Teenagers.\n\nFrankie Lymon and the Teenagers in their peak years\n\nSigning to Gee Records in 1955, Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers issued the single \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d that became the group\u2019s breakthrough hit. The song made to the Billboard pop at #6 and at #1 on Billboard R&B chart in early 1956. It even became a bigger hit in the UK where the song topped its national music chart that same year. \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall In Love\u201d was the group\u2019s first and only biggest single. Lymon, being as the lead singer, became a teen idol which led to the group being billed as Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers in 1957.\n\nThe follow up single \u201cI Want You to Be My Girl\u201d was their second big hit, peaking at #13 on the pop chart while it was #3 on the R&B chart later that year. Two of their singles in 1957 became UK hits: \u201cI\u2019m Not a Juvenile Deliquent\u201d (#12) and \u201cBaby Baby\u201d (#4).\n\nLymon leaves the Teenagers and the group\u2019s later years\n\nBy 1957, Lymon was pulled out from the group by George Goldner, the owner of the group\u2019s label Gee Records. Goldner wanted to groom Lymon as a solo artist.\u201d On Roulette Records, he issued the song \u201cGoody Goody\u201d that performed well on the pop chart at #20. The Teenagers, meanwhile, recruited Billy Lobrano to replace Lymon, becoming the group\u2019s first white member\u201d. Nonetheless, having Lobrano to the group did not help their career, and Lobrano left the group in 1958.\n\nMerchant, Santiago, Garnes and Negroni tried to continue performing as a quartet and later as a quintet, adding the new lead singer Howard Kenny Bobo. However, they did not gain notable successes, and so did Lymon\u2019s solo career.\n\nOn February 28, 1968, the 25-year old Lymon died of a heroin overdose. In 1977, Garne was claimed by heart attack and a year later, Negroni succumbed to cerebral hemorrhage. Nonetheless, the group still tried to rebuild their career, replacing Negroni and Lymon by Bobby Jay and Lews Lymon, Frankie\u2019s brother. In the 1980\u2019s they also hired a female singer named Pearl McKinnon. But still, none of these formations saw notable success. In their recent years, they continued to perform as the \u201cFrankie Lymon\u2019s Legendary Teenagers.\u201d\n\nIn 1993, Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers were inducted into the Rock and Roll of Fame and in 2000, they were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame."}]}
