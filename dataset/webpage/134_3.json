Its CEO is Christopher Ruddy, a Trump friend and adviser.\n\nAs Media Matters first reported, Root used his March 11 program to downplay concerns about the coronavirus. He then addressed people who were concerned about the virus by directing them to watch an ad touting a suspect silver product. Root stated: \u201c\u2018My Doctor Suggests\u2019 message is next.

They love him like he is the second coming of God,\u201d the quote said.\n\nIt\u2019s not the only Jewish thing Root has said about Trump. Just two weeks after Trump was elected, Root sought to reassure Jewish Americans, who had voted overwhelmingly for his rival, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, about the president-elect\u2019s bona fides.\n\n\u201cI believe Donald Trump should be called \u2018America\u2019s first Jewish president,'\u201d he wrote on the Fox News website. \u201cI should know. I\u2019m an Ivy League-educated Jewish kid from New York.\u201d\n\n>> Read more: >> Trump has made it official: He is the greatest anti-Semite of our age | Opinion \u25a0 To please Trump, Netanyahu turned Omar, Tlaib and BDS into prime time news | Analysis \u25a0 Nixing Tlaib and Omar visit, Netanyahu harms Israel to assuage Trump\u2019s ego | Analysis\n\nMaybe, in the sense that Saul was a Jewish kid from Tarsus \u2014 Root is an evangelical Christian, something he did not mention in his Fox column.\n\nRoot, speaking Tuesday evening on his talk show on Newsmax, also a conservative news site, was a little more candid about where he was faith-wise.\n\n\u201cI happen to be Jewish by birth,\u201d he said.\n\nWho exactly is Wayne Allyn Root and why are he and Trump so fond of each other? Here are some answers.\n\nHe says he\u2019s Jewish and has interesting ideas about Jewish identity.\n\nIn the Fox column, the 58-year-old Root refers to his \u201cJewish butcher father, David Root.\u201d He told The Jewish Telegraphic Agency that all four grandparents are Jewish and that his DNA shows him \u201c99.5\u201d percent European Jewish.\n\nRoot, who lives in Las Vegas, says he founded the Republican Jewish Coalition chapter in Nevada. Matt Brooks, the RJC\u2019s executive director, confirmed that Root was involved in the group but says he has not been for more than a decade. (Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate who is a major funder of the RJC and Republican candidates along with Jewish causes, hired Root to write a column for the Las Vegas Review-Journal after buying the newspaper in 2015 \u2014 a move that raised eyebrows among fans of the paper\u2019s hard news tradition.)\n\nRoot told JTA he \u201ctook Jesus Christ as a savior\u201d about 30 years ago, but he still considers himself Jewish.\n\nNotably, several other Trump defenders are Jews turned Christian, including Trump\u2019s lawyer, Jay Sekulow, and the right-wing activist and lawyer Larry Klayman.\n\nThe lessons Root takes away from being born Jewish comport with hoary Jewish stereotypes \u2014 some flattering, others less so.\n\n\u201cI am a Jew and you can\u2019t take away from a person being a Jew,\u201d he said, noting that Islamist extremists and white supremacists would target him as Jewish. \u201cI\u2019ve got Jewish blood and passion and zeal.\u201d\n\n\u201cJesus Christ was a Jew, and the CEO of the Christian religion,\u201d Root said, adding that he, too, was born Jewish and was a CEO.\n\nRoot, who calls himself a \u201ccapitalist evangelist\u201d told Daniel Davis, a syndicated radio host, that his Jewish background informed his philosophy. Jews were \u201crelentless,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey like to hammer down the door till they get what they want,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the Fox column, Root said Trump \u201cis your typical Jewish parent.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald\u2019s children are all Ivy League graduates \u2014 just like my daughter who recently graduated magna cum laude from Harvard,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cDonald is handing his business over to his children. That is the goal of every Jewish businessman in history.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the column: \u201cDonald is a big success in Hollywood as a TV producer. He joins an exclusive club that is predominantly Jewish.\u201d\n\nAdd forthrightness to the list of traits Root finds Jewish.\n\n\u201cHe says whatever is on his mind, even if it offends,\u201d he wrote in the column. \u201cAll of those are traits I\u2019ve seen in my Jewish friends, relatives and business partners for my entire life.\u201d\n\nHe can be emphatically evangelical.\n\nA few months before the 2016 election, writing on another conservative website, Townhall, Root used a more Christian pitch in addressing coreligionists who were put off by Trump\u2019s brashness and viciousness.\n\n\u201cLet me repeat my message to Christians: \u2018YOU\u2019RE MISSING THE BOAT,'\u201d Root said. \u201cGod is about miracles. We don\u2019t need a \u2018nice guy\u2019 or a \u2018gentleman\u2019 right now. It\u2019s the fourth quarter and we\u2019re losing 14-0. We need a miracle. I believe Trump is our miracle.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s been on the Trump train longer than most.\n\nRoot, the Libertarian Party\u2019s vice presidential nominee in 2008, announced his support for the businessman and reality star almost as soon as Trump announced he was running in June 2015. He emceed one of the candidate\u2019s first rallies, in Las Vegas. Trump, unsurprisingly, praised Root\u2019s book \u201cAngry White Male: How the Donald Trump Phenomenon is Changing America\u201d published that year.\n\nRoot, who ran a sports gambling business, told JTA that the Republican Party has not done enough to shake Jewish voters out of their adherence to Democrats.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m one of the best salesmen in America, and I believe I can sell conservatism to Jews,\u201d he said.\n\nRoot went on to say that he would soon announce that he will head a \u201cmajor Jewish organization\u201d and planned to set up a Jews for Trump political action committee.\n\nHe\u2019s called a conspiracy theorist \u2014 he says he asks questions.\n\nLiberal outlets have long singled out Root for peddling conspiracy theories, including that the 2017 shooting massacre in Las Vegas that killed 58 concertgoers was the work of Islamist extremists. No motive has been ascribed for the attack, which was carried out by a white non-Muslim man named Stephen Paddock.\n\nRoot has also questioned whether white supremacists were behind the deadly violence at a neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, and whether there is more to the 2016 murder of Seth Rich, a Jewish Democratic Party staffer. (Police believe Rich was killed in a robbery gone bad; conspiracy theorists believe Hillary Clinton was behind the killing.)\n\nRoot told JTA that conspiracy theories proliferate on the right and the left, and that he does not necessarily endorse the theories \u2014 he asks questions. That, he said, was a very American thing to do, and that pluralities of Americans do not buy into the accepted narratives behind the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963 or the suicide of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein this month.\n\n\u201cI question everything coming out of the mouths of government officials,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re egomaniacs who lie about everything to protect themselves.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.creators.com/read/wayne-allyn-root", "page_content": "I believe I've come up with a game-changer: an idea that has the power to save America from destruction and collapse at the hands of our enemies (domestic and foreign), an idea so powerful that if former president and current presidential candidate Donald Trump adopts it as a centerpiece of his campaign, it will catapult him to reelection as the 47th president of the United States.\n\nThis idea is like kryptonite to the deep state. It threatens the power structure of the entire American political system and U.S. government.\n\nBecause it will prove virtually the entire D.C. swamp, deep state, Democrat Party, U.S. government and even large swaths of the GOP are traitors to the American people.\n\nHow do I know this idea is that good, that powerful?\n\nFirst, because I unveiled it recently at my speech in front of over 1,200 attendees at Club 47, the world's largest Trump fan club, in Palm Beach, Florida. My speech ended with a standing ovation \u2014 and this idea received the wildest ovation of the night.\n\nAfter the event, there was a one-hour line for my book signing. This was the idea everyone would not stop talking about!\n\nSecond, days ago I laid out this idea for the first time as a guest on a YouTube show aimed at military veterans. This show was INSTANTLY banned and deleted by YouTube. This has never happened in the history of this YouTube show. That's how powerful this idea is.\n\nThe idea is simple. If we want to save America, we must demand politicians and government officials take periodic, random...\n\nLIE DETECTOR TESTS.\n\nI believe our politicians and government officials have sold us out. They're on the take. They're bribed and blackmailed. They're playing for the other side. They're traitors. All the bad things happening to our country are happening because we've been sold out.\n\nI believe I know who has bought our politicians and government officials. They are owned lock, stock and barrel by either China, the CCP (Chinese Communist Party), the Mexican drug cartels, multinational corporate interests or Big Pharma.\n\nI know the game they're playing. Either they're taking cash bribes directly into offshore accounts... or it's laundered through offshore charities... or through corrupt offshore countries like Ukraine... or through illegal campaign contributions... or the bribes are doled out to family members or trusted friends of the politicians and government officials to keep them one step removed. One thing is clear: Our nation has been sold out.\n\nThere's only one way to find out: LIE DETECTOR TESTS.\n\nThe politicians will refuse. They'll say these tests are \"unreliable.\" Let's turn the tables on them. I found out recently that Navy SEALs are forced to take random lie detector tests several times a year to detect if they've shared top-secret information with spouses, family or friends. If they fail the test, they're instantly fired.\n\nIf the government accepts the results of lie detector tests as proof enough to fire Navy SEALs, then \"we the people\" accept the results to fire the corrupt politicians and bureaucrats. From now on, either take the lie detector test, or in the words of Donald Trump, \"You're fired!\"\n\nWhat questions would I ask?\n\n\u2014Are you now, or have you ever been on China's payroll? Or the CCP payroll?\n\n\u2014Are you now, or have you ever been on the payroll of the Mexican drug cartels?\n\n\u2014Are any of your family members or friends on any of these foreign payrolls?\n\n\u2014Do you have an offshore bank account? Does anyone in your family accept payoffs in an offshore account?\n\n\u2014Do you accept illegal campaign contributions from any foreign interests?\n\n\u2014Are you on the payroll of any Big Pharma company or vaccine manufacturer? Do you have family members or friends on the Big Pharma payroll or receiving stock or stock options from Big Pharma?\n\n\u2014Are you being blackmailed, or have you ever been blackmailed?\n\n\u2014Have you given government contracts to spouses, family members or friends?\n\n\u2014Have you passed inside information on public companies to family or friends, and shared in the profits?\n\n\u2014Are you 100% loyal to the interests of America and your constituents?\n\nI think that about covers it. Get the answers to those questions and we save America. We throw the bums and traitors out.\n\nSadly, I believe we'd have to replace virtually the entire House, Senate, every federal judge and every government bureaucrat.\n\nMy message to Trump...\n\nThe American people will go wild for this idea. Trust me, I've already tested it. Take this idea and run with it \u2014 literally. Please adopt this idea as a centerpiece of your presidential campaign \u2014 along with term limits.\n\nThat powerful one-two punch will catapult you back into the White House.\n\nAnd if YouTube chose to immediately ban and delete my interview, you know this idea scares the deep state to death. They don't want the American people to ever hear about this idea. They're treating it like Hunter Biden's laptop.\n\nThat's how you know this idea is a grand-slam home run!\n\nIf it's good enough for Navy SEALs, it's time for \"we the people\" to demand the politicians and bureaucrats take lie detector tests.\n\nWayne Allyn Root is known as \"the Conservative Warrior.\" Wayne's latest book is out, \"The Great Patriot BUY-cott Book.\" https://www.amazon.com/Great-Patriot-BUY-cott-Book-Conservative/dp/099173372X/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1676215826&sr=8-1.
