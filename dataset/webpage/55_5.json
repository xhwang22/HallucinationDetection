He was a VERY small part of the 1950 pennant winning Philadelphia Phillies known aka The Whiz Kids. Being a fan and player of Strat-O-Matic\u2019s past seasons, I was somewhat familiar with Ridzik\u2019s accomplishments. RIP\n\nBRADENTON \u2014 Former professional baseball player Steve Ridzik never forgot the fans who helped him fulfill his dream for more than a decade.\n\nThe former pitcher for the Philadelphia Phillies, the New York Giants and several other teams, who died Jan. 8 of heart disease at 78, helped create a players\u2019 alumni association that raises money for charity.\n\nRidzik helped organize a Bradenton golf tournament with former baseball players that raised more than $50,000 for Manatee Memorial Hospital in the early 1990s, said his wife, Nancy Ridzik of Bradenton. The ex-ballplayer had undergone open-heart surgery there for a triple bypass a couple of years earlier, she said.\n\nIn addition to taking part in several other fundraisers over the years, Ridzik also regularly granted fans\u2019 requests for autographs by signing baseball cards and blank cards that arrived by mail on almost a daily basis, his wife said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve even had baseball bats and baseballs sent here\u201d and he obliged, she said.\n\nBorn April 29, 1929, in Yonkers, N.Y., Ridzik was signed by the Phillies\u2019 in 1945 at age 16 and pitched his first major league game in 1950, the same year the Phillies went on to win the National League pennant for the first time in 35 years.\n\nNicknamed \u201cThe Whiz Kids\u201d that year because their average age was 26, the Phillies were the youngest team to ever reach the World Series, which they lost to the New York Yankees.\n\nRidzik subsequently played for the Cincinnati Redlegs, the Giants, the Cleveland Indians and the Washington Senators before retiring from baseball in 1966. He later worked for a food distributor in the Washington, D.C., area before retiring and moving to Bradenton in 1988.\n\nHe helped former Senators teammate Chuck Hinton establish the nonprofit Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association in 1982 for former players to serve as goodwill ambassadors of the sport.\n\nRidzik returned to Philadelphia in 2000 for a 50th anniversary reunion of his pennant-winning team before a crowd of 40,000 in Veterans Stadium.\n\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have missed it for the world,\u201d his wife said. \u201cI think there were 13 of the original \u2018Whiz Kids\u2019 still around back then, and now there are only about six left.\u201d\n\nIn retirement, he enjoyed golfing and watching horse and dog racing.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nRecent Stories:\n\nNOTE: My spam filter automatically deletes any TrackBacks that do not actually link and refer to this post.

In 1953, Ridzik started 12 games and relieved in 30 more going 9-6 with an earned run average of 3.77. The Phillies traded him on April 30, 1955, along with Smoky Burgess and Stan Palys, to the Cincinnati Redlegs for Andy Seminick, Glen Gorbous, and Jim Greengrass. After having his contract sold to Seattle of the Pacific Coast League that same year, the New York Giants claimed him the next month in the Rule 5 draft.\n\nRidzik pitched for the Giants from 1957 to 1958 appearing in 56 games including 5 starts. On April 8, 1958, the Giants sold his contract to the Cleveland Indians where he would pitch in six more games before his contract was sold again to the Chicago Cubs. He would not pitch a major league game with the Cubs before his contract was sold to the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League.\n\nRidzik signed with the Washington Senators three years later in 1963 after developing a knuckleball. He would appear in 132 games, mostly in relief, over the next three years for the Senators. On April 13, 1966, his contract was sold back to his original team, the Phillies. He would appear in two games with the Phillies that year before calling it a career.\n\nAfter life as a baseball player, Ridzik worked in the Washington, D.C. area for a military food distributor until moving to Florida in the late 1980s.

He attended School Seven, Longfellow Junior High school. He began his baseball career at the age of nine on the sandlots of Yonkers and played for the Glenner AC in the Yonkers Recreation League; with Saint Nicholas of Myra in the Catholic Youth Organization League; and with the Hollows AC and the Boilermakers AC in other local leagues.\n\nHe was an outstanding athlete at Saunders, starring both basketball and baseball, and here he pitched his team to three successive city championships. His coach was Alex Joyner, who he recalls as \u201cone of the finest men I ever knew.\u201d After high school he pitched in the fast Hudson Valley League where he attracted the attention of scout Fred Mathews of the Philadelphia Phillies of the National League who signed him to a contract in 1945. This began a professional baseball career that spanned twenty-two years, eleven in top minor league competition, and eleven in the major circuits. Thus, Steve Ridzik played longer in the major baseball leagues than any Yonkers athlete.\n\nOn reporting to Philadelphia he was farmed to the Wilmington Blue Rocks, who after a short trial period, transferred him up the baseball ladder to Greenboro in the Carolina State League. His minor league experiences encompassed such clubs and leagues as Schenectady in the Canadian American League; Toronto and Baltimore in the International League; Utica in the Eastern League; Wilmington in the inter-State league; Minnesota and Fort Worth in the American Association; and San Diego in the Pacific Coast League. During this time his tams won five league championships and Steve was named on five minor league all star teams.\n\nHis major league career covered five clubs-the Philadelphia Phillies, Cincinnati Reds, New York Giants, Cleveland Indians, and the Washington Senators, from which club he retired from baseball in 1966. His first year in the big leagues in 1950 was an auspicious one, as his club, the Philadelphia Phillies, won the National League crown. The Highlight of his career came in 1952 when he pitched a no hit-no run game against the Saint Louis Cardinals.\n\nSteve also played Winter League Baseball in Puerto Rico and in the Venezuelan and Dominican Republic Leagues.

To maximize the value of technology investments, practices related to budget planning, accountability, cloud, capital allocation, and benchmarks should be adjusted.\n\nAgile planning and budgeting. Belabored planning efforts, in-depth forecasts, customer preferences, and detailed task lists with strict deadlines\u2014together with requirements gathering, solution development, and testing\u2014can stretch project deployment into months or even years. By the time IT delivers the project, the world has moved on; the business may now face new headwinds, evolved customer preferences, or shifts in demand. This is where technology vanguards play the field differently.\n\nFor many technology vanguards, rapid prototyping, design and testing, and iterative development is becoming the norm. Their delivery teams\u2014including both business and technology stakeholders\u2014aim to minimize the time between the idea and execution, deliver the solution incrementally, and quickly course-correct based on customer feedback and how the solution is being used.\n\nSavvy technology leaders are shifting their investment practices to give more autonomy to cross-functional teams, enabling them to maximize the value delivered from technology investments and holding them accountable for delivering this value. They are also often more engaged in oversight, course corrections, and budget reallocation across multiple competing options.\n\nJoint ownership and accountability. Historically, the success or failure of technology implementations rested squarely on the shoulders of the CIO and IT team. However, as organizations move from siloed projects with functional ownership to cross-functional business solutions, project success and failure are also jointly owned.\n\nFor example, the CIO of a large services company fostered joint accountability and ownership by offering \u201cunlimited capacity\u201d to business leaders. Every solution in development is staffed with a collaborative team of business and technology people who are responsible not only for developing the solution but also for delivering value. Business and technology leaders are jointly responsible for overseeing the investments and the value delivered. Incentives, bonuses, and rewards depend on outcomes, not on staying within budget or meeting certain deadlines. Effective implementation in this scenario required that the organization develop competencies, agility, and a network of ecosystem partners that can flex based on demand. The CIO is also responsible for a budget category known as \u201ctech for tech,\u201d which are investments in collaboration and productivity tools and other common enterprise infrastructure. As a result of these policies, business leaders are far less likely to build or buy shadow IT solutions.10\n\nDeliberate cloud investments. The pandemic is accelerating cloud demand, with 59% of enterprises expecting cloud use to exceed plans due to COVID-19.11 Deloitte predicts that cloud revenue growth will be greater than 30% from 2021 through 2025.12 Cloud adoption can help companies realize significant cost savings, but only if CIOs have visibility into cloud usage across the organization and provide ongoing oversight and adjustments to manage costs, monitor workloads, and ensure value realization.13 Merely pushing a cloud-first approach could substantially increase costs, diminish value, and lead to unchecked usage, orphaned resources, oversized infrastructure design, redundant software subscriptions, or complex architectures. On-premise deployments may be better suited for workloads that have high resource utilization and complex integrations that can run up deployment and operational expenses.\n\nBalanced capital allocation. COVID-19 highlighted the need for organizations to be lean and resilient. Many technology leaders were asked to cut significant portions of their budgets and reallocate existing investments to build resilient technology environments and boost security, infrastructure, and collaboration tools. Such defensive investments\u2014related to the protection and preservation of the organization\u2019s business and assets\u2014are critical, but for business leadership, they\u2019re a table-stakes expectation.\n\nSavvy CIOs are also focusing on business innovation and other offensive technology investments\u2014those that create and enable new opportunities, business models, and revenue sources. Research suggests that high-performing companies disproportionately spend discretionary budget dollars on growing the business while others focus primarily on protecting the business.14\n\nUsing benchmarks as guideposts. In calibrating technology spending, some organizations solely rely on industry benchmarks to assess if they are over- or under-spending and to allocate technology budgets. As lines between industries blur, these benchmarks should be used as guideposts, not gospel.\n\nCompanies in the same industry can have vastly diverse business strategies and models, leading to very different investment profiles. Using benchmarks without context could be dangerous. It is important to align spending with the organization\u2019s corporate strategy, current and future competitive landscape, and technology ambition (figure 4). Above all, it is imperative to ensure that budget dollars can be reallocated quickly to maximize value. Proper oversight can allow technology leaders to continually monitor technology investments to ensure ongoing value delivery and enable them to ruthlessly reallocate funds if the investment is underperforming."}, {"url": "https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranked-the-most-innovative-companies-in-2021/", "page_content": "Ranked: the Top 50 Most Innovative Companies in 2021\n\nThis year has been rife with pandemic-induced changes that have shifted corporate priorities\u2014and yet, innovation has remained a top concern among corporations worldwide.\n\nUsing data from the annual ranking done by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) using a poll of 1,600 global innovation professionals, this graphic ranks the top 50 most innovative companies in 2021.\n\nWe\u2019ll dig into a few of the leading companies, along with their innovative practices, below.\n\nMost Innovative Companies: A Breakdown of the Leaderboard\n\nTo create the top 50 innovative company ranking, BCG uses four variables:\n\nGlobal \u201cMindshare\u201d : The number of votes from all innovation executives.\n\n: The number of votes from all innovation executives.

This is impressive considering that, historically, vaccine development could take up to a decade to complete.\n\nPfizer is just one of four COVID-19 vaccine producers to appear on the list this year\u2014Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and AstraZeneca also made the cut.\n\nMeanwhile, in a completely different industry, Toyota snagged the 21st spot on this year\u2019s list, up 20 places compared to the rankings in the previous year. This massive jump can be signified by the company\u2019s recent $400 million investment into a company set to build flying electric cars.\n\nWhile we often think of R&D and innovation as being synonymous, the former is just one innovation technique that\u2019s helped companies earn a spot on the list. Other companies have innovated in different ways, like streamlining processes to increase efficiency.\n\nFor instance, in 2021, Coca-Cola performed an analysis of their beverage portfolio and ended up cutting their brand list in half, from 400 to 200 global brands. This ability to pare down and pivot could be a reason behind its 20 rank increase from 2020.\n\nInnovation Creates Value\n\nAs this year\u2019s ranking indicates, innovation comes in many forms. But, while there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach, there is one fairly consistent innovation trend\u2014the link between innovation and value.\n\nIn fact, according to historical data from BCG, the correlation between value and innovation has grown even stronger over the last two decades.\n\nFor example, in 2020, a portfolio that was theoretically invested in BCG\u2019s most innovative companies would have performed 17% better than the MSCI World Index\u2014which wasn\u2019t the case back in 2005.\n\nAnd yet, despite innovation\u2019s value, many companies can\u2019t reap the benefits that innovation offers because they aren\u2019t ready to scale their innovative practices.\n\nThe Innovation Readiness Gap\n\nBCG uses several metrics to gauge a company\u2019s \u201cinnovation readiness,\u201d such as the strength of its talent and culture, its organization ecosystems, and its ability to track performance.\n\nAccording to BCG\u2019s analysis, only 20% of companies surveyed were ready to scale on innovation.\n\nWhat\u2019s holding companies back from reaching their innovation potential? The most significant gap seems to be in what BCG calls innovation practices\u2014things like project management or the ability to execute an idea that\u2019s both efficient and consistent with an overarching strategy.\n\nTo overcome this obstacle, BCG says companies need to foster a \u201cone-team mentality\u201d to increase interdepartmental collaboration and align team incentives, so everyone is working towards the same goal."}, {"url": "https://www2.deloitte.com/ce/en/pages/about-deloitte/topics/technology-fast-50.html", "page_content": "The winners list will be published on the evening of November 23rd, 2023.\n\nApplications must be completed online and are due August 31st, 2023.

Broadly, this includes chronic diseases, long-term diseases, and under resourced areas like menstrual and mental health. These are areas where public healthcare has limited budget and resources and where private healthcare can often be prohibitively expensive. In addition, even if you do receive healthcare for it, there's a social and community component that is lacking which can be highly value add from the perspective of knowledge transfer, mental well-being and peer support.

The US on the other hand has a large market with a very different, profit driven attitude towards healthcare, but the healthcare system, payment coverage and attitudes towards healthcare are quite different from the most of the world, which makes it a daunting market to conquer."}, {"url": "https://www2.deloitte.com/ce/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/2022-fast-50-edition.html", "page_content": "Impact Stars\n\nThe Impact Stars is a special classification of entities which successfully link great products/services with a positive impact on at least one of the following: society, business, innovativeness, environment and diversity.\n\n\n\nImpact Stars \u2013 Special award criterias\n\nThe Impact Stars (IS) is a special category which recognizes a company which successfully links great products/services with a positive impact on at least one of the following: society, business, innovativeness, environment and diversity.\n\nImpact Stars must:"}, {"url": "https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3901410,00.html", "page_content": "R&D Partnership Big-Tech 50, which was listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in February , is carrying on its strategy of investing in mature startups, with its Thursday announcement of three new investments in Israeli unicorns.\n\nAmong the three companies Big-Tech 50 invested in, is content recommendation platform Outbrain, in which it purchased $1.5 million worth of shares.

It's also backed less well-known startups, like satellite internet firm OneWeb, Indian ecommerce company Paytm, and farming startup Plenty. Most of the money has gone to companies in Europe, Asia, and North America.\n\nSoftBank is raising a follow-up Vision Fund II, and at one point said it had financing commitments of $108 billion.

SoftBank's Son and Adam Neumann \u2014 the company's recently ousted CEO \u2014 once had a close personal relationship, but the Japanese investor was reportedly one of the first to call for Neumann to step down when the company's IPO plans started falling apart. Layoffs of WeWork staffers began almost immediately after the takeover.\n\nSoftBank reported a steep $6.5 billion loss in November, spurred by its biggest tech bet flops like WeWork, and Uber and Lyft's disappointing debuts on the stock market.\n\nIn the wake of the WeWork debacle, several other SoftBank startups have also begun to bleed. Zume, the SoftBank-backed robotic pizza startup valued at $1 billion, lost a third of its executive team and layoffs that affected 360 out of its 500 employees. The company isn't alone \u2014 in the first full week of 2020, SoftBank-backed Oyo, Rappi, Getaround and Zume laid off a combined total of 2,600 employees. More layoffs in Oyo's US offices have also been reported by Business Insider, though it isn't immediately clear how many jobs were cut.\n\nHere's a running list of SoftBank's investments, based on how much the firm has put into in each company:"}]}
