Ross had a vision for doing that, with an emphasis on liberal arts and part-time adult education. He has remained a valuable and active faculty member since his time as president.\n\nAn officer of the Order of Canada, Ross had a long and distinguished career in the academic world, both as a professor and an administrator. In addition to his decade at the helm of York University, he was also a former vice-president of the University of Toronto. He published several books of note, including Canadian Corporate Directors on the Firing Line, New Universities in the Modern World, and The Way Must be Tried: Memoirs of a University Man. Born in Sydney, Nova Scotia, he was educated at Acadia University, University of Toronto, University of Chicago and Columbia University.

York University To Celebrate 40th Anniversary Of The Proclamation Of The York Act, March 26, 1959 TORONTO, March 24, 1999 -- Forty years ago this Friday -- March 26, 1959 -- the York Act received Royal Assent in the Ontario Legislature, bringing to life an institution whose diversity, innovation and excellence emerged with dizzying speed over four decades. From an initial class of 76 students in 1960, York University has evolved into the third largest university in Canada, attracting 40,000 students in search of top-notch teaching and research. \"In 1959, we had no faculty, no students, no buildings -- only President Murray G. Ross and grand dreams,\" said York University President Dr. Lorna Marsden. \"Forty years later: We have more than 40,000 full and part-time graduate and undergraduate students in 10 faculties on three campuses; more than 4,500 faculty and staff, many leaders in their fields; twenty research centres; 144,000 alumni worldwide, many prominent players in all sectors of society; and the completion of our largest, most successful $108 million campaign,\" said Marsden. Praising the values and vision of the University founders over those inchoate years, Marsden added that they and those who followed have helped York establish itself as an important contributor to local, provincial and national communities -- academic, social, cultural and economic -- and a leader in pioneering partnerships with community colleges. Founding York University president Murray G. Ross, President Marsden, and Chancellor Avie Bennett will be at York's Keele campus Friday afternoon to help celebrate this anniversary with members of the York community, including student leaders, alumni, and pioneers from the first class of students, the first staff of 13, the first faculty of 16, and the first physical plant workers. D. McCormack Smyth, York University Professor Emeritus and Senior Scholar, will tell the fascinating and feisty story of \"The Creation of York University\" during a lecture Wednesday, March 24, from 2 - 4 p.m. at the Harry Crowe Room in Atkinson College. Smyth will recount York's first year at U of T's Falconer Hall, its move to Glendon campus in the fall of 1961 and its early emphasis on liberal arts and part-time adult education, while remembering the personalities, the problems and the potential of the period -- when Leslie Frost was premier, and the province was scurrying to accommodate the educational needs of the baby boomers. Details on Thursday and Friday's 40th anniversary celebrations are attached, but the York community will celebrate this important milestone through to March 25, 2000 by, for example: establishing the York University Founders' Society: the first honorees will be announced Thursday and Friday; others will be announced throughout the year, at Spring and Fall convocations, Homecoming, etc.\n\npublishing a document highlighting 40 years of Research at York;\n\nproducing a York Faculty Honorary Recognition book, highlighting members of the Order of Canada, Fellows of the Royal Society, Distinguished Research Professors and others.\n\nimplementing, through the University's Quality of Life on Campus Committee, 40 improvements during the 40th anniversary year.\n\ninitiating an oral history project, capturing the early voices of York as we prepare for the publication of a 50th anniversary official history of York University. The general public, who will wake up Thursday to a special section in the Toronto Star on York's 40th anniversary, will also notice York University 40th anniversary banners flying high along streets surrounding the university's three campuses: the campus at Keele and Steeles; the Glendon campus at Bayview and Lawrence; and the Miles S. Nadal Downtown Management Centre at King and Bay. Later that day, former York vice-president Bill Small, who served as secretary at York's first Senate meeting on Nov. 14, 1960, will be honoured during the University's regular monthly meeting of Senate.

The President is appointed by the Board of Governors, after consultation with the Senate, and holds office during the pleasure of the Board. The President is Vice Chancellor and chief executive officer of the University with responsibility to supervise and direct the implementation of the educational policy and general administration of the University, including the teaching staff, officers, servants and students. The President has power to formulate and implement regulations governing the conduct of students, to recommend to the Board the appointment, promotion and removal of teaching staff, officers and employees of the University, along with power to recommend new faculties, departments, schools, institutes, programmes and projects. The President also has power to strike presidential committees and to recommend courses of action to the Board.\n\nThe establishment of York University in 1959 and the need to begin a teaching programme in 1960 meant that the Board of Governors and the President had to move quickly to establish a faculty, a programme of study and employ the necessary teachers and administrators to give life to the new institution. Murray G. Ross was named President in December of 1959 and was inaugurated in 1960. The University was affiliated with the University of Toronto at the time and Ross was able to assemble a teaching staff for September 1960 when the first seventy-five York students enrolled.\n\nThe records show that Ross was intimately involved in all facets of the University in the early years, from student activities (and discipline! ), through academic and physical plant planning, to graduation ceremonies. In addition, Ross and his successors spent a good deal of time undertaking public-speaking tours, fund-raising and establishing contacts with other universities in Canada and around the world, with associations and all levels of government.\n\nMurray G. Ross served as President of York for a decade (1960-1970), and was succeeded by David Slater. During his short tenure (1971-1973), Slater continued the course set by the Ross years.\n\nIn 1974 Ian H. Macdonald became President of the University, a post he filled for ten years. This period was as significant as the Ross tenure in the presidency. Enrollment increased by fifty per cent while faculty complements remained stable. The introduction of labour unions and collective bargaining was also a feature of the period. The Macdonald era also saw two major reforms of the administrative structure of York, undertaken in a period of fiscal restraint within the Province and the University.\n\nThe first reform took place in 1976 as part of a move to centralize planning at York, a major recommendation of the President' s Commission on Goals and Objectives (1976). Among the reforms was the introduction of the Executive Vice President. The second reform occurred in 1983, its most significant aspect being the introduction of a Provost for students at the University.\n\nYork was also the first Canadian university to appoint an Advisor on the Status of Women as a senior officer reporting to the President, and Macdonald also appointed a Sexual Harrassment Officer. In the field of research, the Centre for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, the LaMarsh Research Programme on Violence and Conflict Resolution, the Centre for Research in Experimental Space Science and several other centres were opened in the Macdonald period.\n\nMacdonald retired in 1984 and was succeeded by Harry Arthurs, a Professor at Osgoode Hall Law School. Although the period of financial restraint continued, the Arthurs presidency was also marked by progress in the University with an ambitious new building program that saw the erection of a Life Science and Environmental Studies Building, the establishment of a physical presence for Calumet College, the building of the new Student Centre, and the completion of the Fine Arts Complex. The student enrollment increase was kept at approximately twenty-five percent in Arthurs' years, while faculty complements remained stable. A new University Academic Plan, focusing on the teaching and research activity of the University, was inaugurated and the Hare Commission examined the role and utility of the non-faculty colleges within the University structure. The University continued its out-reach for students in the expanding adult education and multicultural communities of Toronto.\n\nIn 1992 Harry Arthurs retired. He was succeeded by Susan Mann."}]}
