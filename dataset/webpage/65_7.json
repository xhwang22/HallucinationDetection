After the formation of the National Women's Soccer League in late 2012, Deines played for the Seattle Reign during the league's first two seasons.

She converted two key penalty kicks, including the game winner, during an epic penalty shoot-out in a shocking upset of the No. 2 overall seed University of Portland in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.[13] The Huskies would eventually go on to the Elite Eight where they were eliminated in an overtime loss at Boston College.\n\nPlaying career\n\nClub\n\nDrafted to the Atlanta Beat, 2012\n\nDeines was selected as a fourth round pick (23rd overall) by the Atlanta Beat in the 2012 WPS Draft of college seniors on January 13, 2012; however, the league suspended operations before play began.[14][15]\n\nFrom Seattle to Iceland, 2012\n\nAfter the WPS folded in 2012, Deines signed with the Seattle Sounders Women.

The team won the Icelandic Women's Cup after a 1\u20130 win over Valur.[17] Of her time in Iceland, Deines said, \"Even though it was a spur of the moment decision to play overseas in Iceland, I believe my three month stint helped in my development as a player.

She played one season with the Boston Breakers, in which she scored seven goals and showed that she could have had a bright future in soccer. For instance, in a May 28, 2014 game she scored a hat trick against the then defending champion Portland Thorns. Reeves retired at 22 years old, however, to take a job she \u201csimply could not pass up\u201d with Amazon.\n\nA few months later, another Breaker, Courtney Jones, left the game to pursue a new business opportunity. Jones, the daughter of former NFL tight end Brent Jones, is 24. She won two national championships at the University of North Carolina and played in the first two seasons of the National Women\u2019s Soccer League.\n\nThen there was 26-year-old Nikki Washington, a former Under-20 Women\u2019s World Cup champion with the United States who retired after stints in two professional leagues.\n\nNikki Marshall, also 26 \u2014 and also a member of the U-20 team in 2008 \u2014 retired in February, less than a year after getting her first call-up to the senior United States national team.\n\nDefender CoCo Goodson hung up her boots at age 24. Goalkeeper Taylor Vancil moved on at age 23. And most recently, 25-year-old Kate Deines made the decision to stop playing.\n\nSpecific reasons for retirement vary among all of these players, but their realities do not. They play in a fringe sector of a still-growing sport, in a fledgling league looking to break the curse of its predecessors and last longer than three seasons.\n\n* * *\n\nIn 2004, then Minnesota Timberwolves swingman Latrell Sprewell offered one of sports\u2019 all-time out-of-touch moments. Sprewell was in the final year of his NBA contract, slated to pay him $14.6 million that season as a 34-year-old. But he didn\u2019t get what he deemed an acceptable offer from the team for an extension and he took to the media to voice his discontent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a family to feed,\u201d he said in frustration.\n\nSome athletes, however, are legitimately scraping by just to feed themselves.\n\nThe National Women\u2019s Soccer League kicked off in 2013, over a year after the second attempt at a professional league \u2013 Women\u2019s Professional Soccer \u2013 went under after three seasons of play.\n\nBefore the WPS, there was the WUSA, which was the first attempt at a full-fledged professional league that was born out of the hysteria of the 1999 Women\u2019s World Cup in the United States. But from 2001-2003, the WUSA burned through $100 million and closed its doors on the eve of the next Women\u2019s World Cup.\n\nWPS opened play in 2009 with what were thought to be more realistic expectations, initially implementing a salary cap of over $500,000 (the cap disappeared in later seasons). But losses there were still in the millions \u2013 even if a fraction of those of WUSA \u2013 and the league eventually lost too many owners and too much money to continue.\n\nSo this iteration, considered the most viable yet, is realistic in its financial approach. It just doesn\u2019t offer what many would deem a realistic way to live.\n\nThe minimum salary for an NWSL player is $6,842 for the course of the six-month season; the maximum is $37,800, made primarily by international-level players. The team salary cap for 20 players is $265,000, which doesn\u2019t include the top U.S., Canadian and Mexican players who play on club teams but whose salaries are paid by their respective federations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually pathetic when I think about what we make,\u201d says Deines, who played for Seattle Reign FC for the first two seasons of the NWSL.\n\nDeines played in 18 matches in 2014 for the Reign, starting half of them. The longtime Pacific Northwest inhabitant was traded to FC Kansas City in the offseason and she is exactly the type of player who is likely to have a great opportunity to take on a more prominent role this season and next as clubs deal with player absences due to the World Cup and Olympics. But Deines, who has a bachelor\u2019s degree in communications and media studies as well as a master\u2019s in continued education from the University of Washington, couldn\u2019t continue to turn down business opportunities in favor of the low-paying league.\n\nIn the increasingly expensive Seattle housing market, Deines\u2019 income level meant she lived in a five-bedroom house with three teammates and a pair of players from Major League Soccer\u2019s Seattle Sounders.\n\n\u201cIt definitely feels like an extension of college life, and it is way less glamorous than college,\u201d Deines said.\n\nThe NWSL kicks off its third season on Friday in Houston, where the Dash are owned by the same group that owns MLS\u2019 Houston Dynamo. The struggles that the NWSL faces in its early years draw parallels to those still present in MLS.\n\nMajor League Soccer signed a new collective bargaining agreement with its players union in March only days before the start of the league\u2019s 20th season. A 64 percent hike of the minimum salary to $60,000 was a small victory for players, who even a decade ago had a floor of $24,000.\n\nThese are the realities of a growing business.\n\nJeff Plush took over as commissioner of the NWSL in December. He previously worked for the Colorado Rapids in MLS and served on Major League Soccer\u2019s board, working in the thick of many of the growing pains of that league.\n\n\u201cLook, the player looking to make a career out of this who is on the lower end of the wage scale is going to have to do [additional things], whether that is coaching at a high school or club or those kind of things,\u201d Plush told NBC SportsWorld. \u201cWe are very respectful of that and we fully understand that we need to continue to build out our potential business platforms that they can tap into to help augment their salary. We have to be mindful of where we are. I\u2019m very cognizant of this \u2013 it\u2019s not all the money in the world, but where we are today is we are in the third year of a long-term strategy to have a very sustainable, robust league in this country. It\u2019s just going to take some time.\u201d\n\nPlush contends that the number of players retiring this offseason is relatively small in regards to the overall player pool.\n\nWhile the NWSL salary cap and maximum salary figure have each grown over 20 percent in two years, the minimum remains a four-digit number and is stretched out over a longer season in 2015. Players live like average Americans, not professional athletes. Off the field, it\u2019s just about getting by.\n\nGibby Wagner is living at home with her parents in Wall, N.J. As an amateur player on Sky Blue FC\u2019s reserve team, she won\u2019t be paid but she could take on a significant role in the middle of the season due to World Cup absences. Wagner left a local newspaper job in hopes of just playing in the league, even if she doesn\u2019t immediately get paid.\n\nBoston Breakers defender Julie King, 25, lives on her own now after two years of living with host families, a common arrangement that NWSL clubs set up to defray player housing costs. But living on her own in greater Boston on an NWSL salary means she needs financial support from her parents.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely chasing the dream,\u201d King says. \u201cI feel very fortunate to have parents who are willing to support me if I need them. I really did need them my first couple of years, as far as my salary went. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to survive without them.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nBecky Edwards is one of the best midfielders in the National Women\u2019s Soccer League. In 2013 she was playing for Portland Thorns FC when she was approached by then U.S. national team coach Tom Sermanni about possibly joining a future training camp.\n\nEdwards, like countless other players in the league, has long dreamed of wearing the red, white and blue. She was part of that 2008 Under-20 U.S. team, which also included the likes of national team regulars Alex Morgan and Sydney Leroux.\n\nTwo weeks after that conversation with Sermanni and before she received any formal invite to the U.S. senior team, Edwards tore her ACL. She rehabbed quickly, in time to be the 2014 cornerstone of the expansion Houston Dash, who traded her in the offseason. Now on her third team in three seasons \u2013 the Western New York Flash \u2013 and in her second professional league, Edwards still exudes positivity.\n\n\u201cThis is the life we live,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me, personally, I still wake up every day and love what I do. I don\u2019t want to have any regrets at the end of the day when I am done playing. I have the rest of my life to work or coach or whatever I decide to do, but right now, for me, it is still worth it.\u201d\n\nEdwards still hopes to make the United States\u2019 2019 World Cup team; she would be 30 years old. Representing their nation is a dream that keeps many players in the league despite the extremely low salaries. But the dream can grow tiring for some. The United States national team is one of the best in the world and those who aren\u2019t already a part of it can understandably feel it is an enigma that often proves inaccessible to those on the outside.\n\nMarshall left the NWSL to take an increased role with the Colorado branch of AvNet Technology Solutions, for whom she worked remotely year-round while playing. Constant work outside of work wasn\u2019t ideal for training to play at the international level, which Marshall was on the cusp of doing.\n\n\u201cIn order to make it to that elite level, you have to live and breathe the game,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cYou really don\u2019t have time for another job. You want to train hard during the offseason. You have to pour your life into it and you have to be extremely dedicated.\u201d\n\nBoth Marshall and Deines acknowledged that the hardest part of the low pay is the unpaid offseason, which stretches up to six months. Some players find short-term opportunities overseas, while others train or try to find coaching jobs. Unable to focus entirely on training, the gap only widens between those who have and those who don\u2019t. Being a member of the United States national team is a rare job in women\u2019s soccer that can pay six figures.\n\n\u201cThat becomes a huge part of it as well and something that women\u2019s soccer is really missing. Some of our best athletes are not getting a chance,\u201d Marshall says. \u201cMaybe they get a half-look, but these coaches are not necessarily committed to giving them a real chance. I think that will change here soon, but for now that is definitely how it is. The women who are on the (U.S.) national team now, they are making a lot of money. They are the top echelon of women\u2019s soccer and they are the only women who are making a lot of money, so they can afford to train every day during the offseason without having a second job. It\u2019s a bit of a different lifestyle. It\u2019s more of an opportunity I think.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nFixing some of these issues requires time and money, which is easier said than done.\n\nPlayers largely understand the financial constraints under which their clubs operate. They play because they love the game, an intangible passion that is uniquely unwavering across sports.\n\nAnd they play to try to pave a path for a better future in the sport \u2013 \u201claying the foundations for future generations,\u201d as King calls it. They are everyday women hoping that in some ways, they will be pioneers through their sacrifice.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to grow something here,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cWe understand the situation from the league. We understand the limitations that they have financially. I want to continue to grow this game and make it possible so that players can make a better living in the future.\u201d\n\nDeines hopes that the NWSL can progress to the point of the WNBA, which stands on solid footing thanks to the backing of the NBA. Portland and Houston are the current NWSL teams backed by MLS clubs, although several MLS clubs are interested in professional women\u2019s teams, according to Plush.\n\nMuch like it is for some of the WNBA\u2019s best players, there is money in Europe for women\u2019s soccer players. Diana Taurasi will sit out this WNBA season to play for her Russian team, U.M.M.C Yekaterinburg, for about $1.5 million, close to 15 times the maximum salary in the WNBA.\n\nUnited States national team midfielder Megan Rapinoe reportedly made $14,000 per month recently playing for Lyon in France. That is more than many NWSL players make in a season.\n\nSuch success stories in Europe vary greatly, however. The average player can get slightly more in Europe, but that may only mean between $1,000 and $2,000 per month, according to Faudlin Pierre, an agent who represents several players domestically and overseas.\n\nBut if anyone is in women\u2019s soccer for the money \u2013 well, they are going to be very disappointed.\n\n\u201cWe certainly don\u2019t play soccer because we make a lot of money or because it\u2019s glamorous,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cWe do it because we absolutely love it. I think I just got to the point where it wasn\u2019t worth the sacrifice for me anymore.\u201d\n\nIn time, the National Women\u2019s Soccer League and the United States Soccer Federation hope to make the grind more worthwhile."}, {"url": "https://www.calendarz.com/on-this-day/september/17/kate-deines", "page_content": "Birth\n\nSep, 17\n\nKate Deines\n\nKate Deines, American soccer player\n\nKathleen Ann Deines (born September 17, 1989) is an American soccer midfielder-defender.

The WPS Board of Governors voted to suspend the 2012 season on January 30 citing pending legal issues. Subsequently, she was free to sign with other teams and rejoined the Seattle Sounders Women, the organization she had previously played for from 2007 to 2009. After the formation of the National Women's Soccer League in late 2012, Deines played for the Seattle Reign during the league's first two seasons.

P\u00e9rez left the University of Washington ranked in the all-time top-10 in several categories, including third in shots (194) and games played (83).\n\nThe 27-year-old was the 37th pick overall in the College Draft in America's old Women's Professional Soccer league, selected by the Saint Louis Athletica in 2010.\n\nHaving dual nationality, she chose to play for Mexico at senior level after playing for the United States at under-23 level. The attacker would then score against the USWNT in Mexico's 2-1 victory in qualifying for the 2011 World Cup in Germany. The goal ensured Mexico reached the World Cup after 12 years of absence.\n\nPerez has previously played in Europe too. During the summer of 2012, she and her Seattle Sounders teammate - and fellow University of Washington alum - Kate Deines, played for Stjarnan, Kristj\u00e1nsd\u00f3ttir's former club, in Iceland's top division. The team won the Icelandic Women's Cup after a 1\u20130 win over Valur.\n\nAfter playing for the Western New York Flash and the Washington Spirit, clubs of the NWSL, Perez's transferred to Canberra United to play in the W-League - for whom she has three goals this season.
