{"Jerry Leger has been featured on CBC Radio, Sirius XM, and BBC Radio.": [{"url": "https://jerryleger.com/about/", "page_content": "Bio\n\nBorn in the mid-80s, singer-songwriter Jerry Leger came of age in the Upper Beaches area of Toronto. Surrounded by music from a young age, his grandfather first turned him onto Hank Williams, constantly playing the youngster a plethora of the honky tonk master\u2019s great recordings. Although Williams\u2019 voice came from another world in terms of time, geography, and class, Leger was intrigued by the ways that Williams\u2019 songs told a story and often conjured up mysterious images in his head. Other seminal influences were slowly added including John Lennon (and the Beatles), Bob Dylan, Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins, Leonard Cohen, Elvis Costello, Neil Young, the Everly Brothers, Tom Waits, and Gordon Lightfoot.\n\nIn 2005 as Leger turned nineteen he cut his first independently released album. In the sixteen years since then the multi-talented singer-songwriter has recorded nine additional studio albums as well as one live compilation under his own name. In 2014 he was signed to the Cowboy Junkies\u2019 label, Latent Recordings, releasing the critically acclaimed Early Riser that same year. His second Latent release, Nonsense and Heartache, followed in 2017. A year later the two-album set was picked up by Proper Records for distribution in the U.K and Europe, leading to extensive touring throughout the continent, in the process opening up a whole new audience for Leger\u2019s finely crafted songs. With his next Latent album, 2019\u2019s Time Out for Tomorrow, Leger began to receive positive notices in such high-profile music magazines as Uncut and Rolling Stone.\n\nA restless hungry spirit, when not performing and recording under his own name, Leger stays busy with a plethora of side projects including The Del Fi\u2019s (loose improvisatory rock and roll) and the Bop Fi\u2019s (Leger reciting his poetry over jazz accompaniment). He has also been known to work under the pseudonym Hank Holly (bonus points go to those who can figure out where that name came from!). Making the most of his time while off the road due to the pandemic, in 2020 Leger published his first book of poetry Just the Night Birds, made a film for his mailing list subscribers, The Apartment Show He Never Gave, while releasing what he terms a \u201csurprise\u201d album, Songs from the Apartment. In between all that activity, Leger also cut a handful of one-off singles. One of those tracks, \u201cHalfway \u2018Till Gone\u201d recorded with former Moby Grape member Don Stevenson, turned the Replacements\u2019 Tommy Stinson into a fan!\n\nSongs from the Apartment was a stripped-down lo-fi affair recorded in Leger\u2019s home using a cheap tape recorder with an internal microphone. Two songs from the current album, \u201cUnderground Blues\u201d and \u201cSinking In,\u201d were also recorded in Leger\u2019s home, this time using two SM58 microphones fed into his vintage 1981 Tascam 4-track tape recorder. The remaining nine tracks included on Nothing Pressing present Leger\u2019s work in two starkly contrasting soundscapes. \u201cNothing Pressing,\u201d \u201cProtector,\u201d and \u201cStill Patience,\u201d are solo acoustic recordings cut live in the studio with little embellishment save Dan Mock\u2019s overdubbed harmony vocals and, on the title track, producer Michael Timmins\u2019 ukulele. The other six tracks are prime roots rock and roll featuring his long-time band The Situation (drummer Kyle Sullivan and bass player Dan Mock). Among the latter songs, \u201cKill It With Kindness\u201d and \u201cHave You Ever Been Happy?\u201d have the kind of drive, energy and spirit that are sure to make them highlights of his future live shows.\n\nLeger often times finds himself at a loss as to explain the source of his songs. He feels his songwriting, while clearly drawing on experiences filtered through a panoply of influences, often verges on being a supernatural experience. Over the course of the eleven songs on Nothing Pressing, the songwriter\u2019s songwriter engages with questions of existence, mortality, hope, trust and heartbreak while simultaneously conjuring feelings of isolation, reflection, longing and gratitude.\n\nPaired with such evocative lyrics are wonderfully crafted melodies, soulful vocals and the spirit and energy of a mature songwriter, comfortable in his skin and growing as an artist with every release. Nothing Pressing serves a wonderfully refreshing tonic in troubling times."}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/jerry-leger/", "page_content": "Jerry Leger (born April 19, 1985 Toronto, Ontario) is a Canadian singer-songwriter. Since 2005, he has released 8 acclaimed albums (4 solo, 3 credited to Jerry Leger & The Situation and 1 with his side project, The Del Fi's) and toured extensively playing shows with acts such as Ron Sexsmith, The Sadies, Jesse Winchester, Fred Eaglesmith, Danny Michel, Jill Barber, Justin Townes Earle, Deer Tick, Skydiggers, Jim Lauderdale, Dawes, Tift Merritt, Doug Paisley, among others.\n\nJerry Leger's music has been heard on CBC Radio shows (including Q, Drive, Mainstreet, Bandwidth, Shift), NPR, WSM, BBC Radio and various campus radio stations. Videos for \"You Got Away From Me\" and \"All Over again ft. Serena Ryder\" are still in rotation on Country Music Television (CMT).\n\nHis songwriting influences include Hank Williams, Bob Dylan, Lightnin' Hopkins, Elvis Costello, Buddy Holly, Gordon Lightfoot and Leonard Cohen.\n\nRon Sexsmith has called him \"One of the best songwriters I've heard in quite some time.\"\n\nCareer\n\nLeger cut his first album when he was 19 in 2005, with frequent producer/musician, Tim Bovaconti. His sophomore record, Farewell Ghost Town, followed the next year. Produced by Don Kerr and Tim Bovaconti and featuring constant Leger supporter, Ron Sexsmith on piano and Fergus Hambleton(of The Sattalites). Farewell Ghost Town was charming not only for its strong songwriting, but also in its unassuming approach.\n\nIn 2007, Leger struck up a friendship with Skydiggers co-founder, Josh Finlayson. This resulted in the 2008 album, You, Me and The Horse, co-produced by Tim Bovaconti. You, Me and The Horse garnered rave reviews and pushed Leger's career forward with appearances on the popular CBC Radio show, Q, in-sessions on the legendary WSM Radio in Nashville and The WDVX concert series, Blue Plate Special in Knoxville, TN.\n\nThe end of 2010 saw the release of Leger's 4th record, Traveling Grey. Ron Sexsmith remarked, \"Traveling Grey is probably Jerry's best record so far and he hasn't made any bad ones.\n\nTraveling Grey is Jerry Leger's fourth album and finds him poised to indelibly add his name to the roll call that has built Toronto's international reputation as a singer/songwriter Mecca. Leger revealed in Exclaim! Magazine how the record came about \"It's the most spontaneous record since my first one, which was done in two days. This one rather from when we were touring out east most of July [2010]. When I got back, I just had this bug: I need to make a record. One song was written at four a.m. the night before the sessions.\" During this time, Jerry appeared twice on Music City Roots, hosted by singer/songwriter, Jim Lauderdale, who has called Leger a great young songwriter.\n\nIn 2011, Jerry released the digital only mini album, The Good Old Days are Back in Drag. Jason Schneider at Exclaim! said \"its seven tracks crackles with the raw energy of a Sun Records single.\" The album artwork is a sketch by Leger.\n\nSome Folks Know was released near the end of 2012, showcasing his longtime backing band, The Situation (James McKie, Dan Mock, Kyle Sullivan), Ron Sexsmith reprising his role on piano and a duet with Serena Ryder. Ben Rayner of The Toronto Star called the album \"the works of a young gifted storyteller\" and \"some folks do indeed already know what he's up to. Time, Jerry. Give it time. It's coming.\"\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Leger met up with Michael Timmins, member and main songwriter in the legendary band, Cowboy Junkies. This resulted in the 2014 album, Early Riser, produced by Timmins and released on the Junkies own label, Latent Recordings, distributed by Fontana North. All Jerry's previous albums had been released independently on his own label, Golden Rocket Records (named after the Hank Snow song). The album has received high acclaim from Exclaim!, NOW, The Toronto Star, The Globe and Mail and CBC. Zachary Houle from PopMatters called the record, \"A commanding and astounding listen\" and \"deserving of any laurels and accolades thrown its way.\" It's also noted for Daniel Romano providing the album artwork/design.\n\nWinter 2015, the album Crowd Pleaser by his side project, The Del Fi's was released. It was recorded live off the floor in 10 hours with 13 musicians who barely knew or didn't know the material at all. Leger wrote all the songs, with most of them being written very quickly before going into the studio to maintain a spontaneous and loose rock 'n' roll sound. Kerry Doole at Exclaim! wrote, \"It remains something of a mystery why roots troubadour Jerry Leger hasn't made more of a mark. He regularly releases albums of a high quality, he's an engaging performer and he has earned major peer respect.\" Adding \"The record does a fine job of capturing the vitality of his band's live show...This is a crowd-pleasing addition to a worthy discography.\" Another side project appeared in 2016 stemming from The Del Fi's called The Bop Fi's featuring poetry written and spoken by Leger with a backdrop of jazz, mainly in the bebop and cool jazz style.\n\nDiscography"}, {"url": "https://www.siriusxm.com/channels/cbc-radio-one", "page_content": "How do you want to listen?\n\nPicking a plan can be tricky and we're here to help.\n\nTell us how you want to listen to SiriusXM, and any hardware details you know.

Insiders say that the move will make it even harder for musicians and local record labels to survive in an already precarious industry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a massive blow for indie artists,\u201d Kamilah Apong, the singer for the disco-house band Tush, told the Star. \u201cA lot of us have already been reorganizing our lives to find ways to make money. This feels like the final nail in the coffin.\u201d\n\nIndependent record labels, such as the Toronto-based Telephone Explosion Records, are also fearing the worst.\n\n\u201cThe loss of this income will mean immediate negative changes (including potential employment cuts) to the music industry in this country,\u201d Telephone Explosion co-owner Jon Schouten told the Star.\n\n\u201cThis could dramatically reduce the amount of Canadian independent music created each year, and weaken a concert industry that\u2019s still reeling from COVID losses. We\u2019re looking at a potentially catastrophic situation that will have ripple effects for decades.\u201d\n\nThe decision to remove CBC Radio 3, along with CBC Country and two French-language ICI Radio-Canada stations, was made by SiriusXM.\n\n\u201cCBC/Radio-Canada was contracted to provide streams to SiriusXM for a number of years. Our contract was completed, and SiriusXM has decided to program their own channels going forward,\u201d CBC Music explained in a tweet.\n\nWhen asked to comment, SiriusXM Canada directed the Star to an online statement on its website regarding programming changes: \u201cWe remain committed to Canadian music and artists, and our Canadian lineup of programming will continue to reflect that.\u201d\n\nStreaming vs. satellite radio\n\nIn the era of music streaming, it is notoriously difficult for the majority of musicians to earn money off of their music.\n\nRecord sales \u2014 that is, the physical purchase of vinyl or CDs \u2014 have cratered over the past decade. Meanwhile, platforms like Spotify and Apple Music pay fractions of a penny per stream \u2014 according to the music publication Producer Hive, it takes 125 streams to earn a dollar on Apple Music, 314 streams to earn a dollar on Spotify, and 500 streams to earn a dollar on YouTube Music.\n\nMost independent artists, therefore, rely on \u201cneighbouring rights\u201d revenue \u2014 or royalties \u2014 generated from radio, television and commercials. In Canada, these royalties are typically collected and distributed on a quarterly basis by performance rights organizations like SOCAN and ACTRA RACS.\n\nThe most lucrative distributor of royalties in Canada, however, is SoundExchange, a non-profit organization that covers \u201cnon-interactive streaming services,\u201d including SiriusXM.\n\nCopyright law requires that SiriusXM pay 15.5 per cent of their gross revenue to Sound Exchange, which translates to about $1 billion dollars per year. For artists, that works out to around $50 per spin, divided between the artist and the owner of the songs master (typically the record label).\n\nIn other words, while a few hundreds streams on Spotify might earn an artist a single dollar, having a song on regular rotation on SiriusXM might generate thousands of dollars in quarterly revenue.\n\nNeighbouring rights are also essential for the daily operation of record labels.\n\nJean-Philippe Bourgeois is an artist manager and radio tracker with Mothland \u2014 a Montreal-based company that acts as a booking agency and record label. He told the Star that nearly all the artists Mothland represents have landed on the CBC Radio 3 rotation, generating income that is in turn used for marketing, vinyl production and third party publicists.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s expensive to market a record,\u201d he told the Star. \u201cFor independent labels that was one of the sole ways \u2014 aside from grants \u2014 that they can they recoup their investment or maybe make a bit of money.\u201d\n\nWhy CBC Radio 3 matters\n\nIf you tune into CBC Radio 3, you\u2019re almost guaranteed to hear something new.\n\nLaunched in 2000 and syndicated for satellite radio in 2005, the station plays a freeform mix of various genres, from indie rock to jazz to alternative hip hop to electronica.\n\nAccording to Max Turnbull, the bandleader for the Toronto-based pysch-jazz collective Badge \u00c9poque Ensemble, CBC Radio 3 is one of the few places that remains dedicated to platforming independent or underground artists that listeners will not hear on commercial radio stations like Indie88 or 102.2 the Edge.\n\n\u201cCBC Radio 3 is not your conventional corporate radio,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s public programming, which is not mandated by the bottom line necessarily.\u201d\n\nAs a musician and producer, Turnbull has been making and performing music in the local scene since 2008, he didn\u2019t register his catalogue with SoundExchange until 2018.\n\n\u201cI was amazed. The first (Badge \u00c9poque Ensemble) record \u2014 which I considered to be a very independent, local kind of project \u2014 started generating revenue, in large part through CBC Radio 3,\u201d he told the Star. \u201cAnd at that time, it felt like the difference literally between conceiving of myself as a professional musician or not. Before that I had never received, quarter over quarter, some thousands of dollars.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s its online statement, SiriusXM pointed out that the digital station The Verge \u201ccontinues to offer the best in new and emerging Canadian indie and alternative music, including many of the artists heard on CBC Radio 3.\u201d\n\nBut Turnbull and other insiders say that the remaining indie/alternative stations on SiriusXM, including The Verge, are guided by corporate editorial interests, and are more likely to resemble mainstream commercial radio.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m deeply skeptical that replacing a channel that was occupied by a public radio station \u2014 with its mandates for diversity, inclusion and fostering independent artists \u2014 with a SiriusXM brand will be nourishing for truly local communities,\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, replacing CBC Radio 3 on channel 162 of SiriuxsFM is Mixtape: North, a station dedicated to Canadian hip hop and R&B. An announcement by SiriusXM says that the station will play artists \u201clike Drake, the Weeknd, Tory Lanez, Jesse Reyez, Kardinal Offishall, k-os and Choclair\u201d \u2014 all established and commercially successful artists who already reside on corporate radio.\n\nDire times in the music industry\n\nUnfortunately, SiriusXM\u2019s program changes arrive at a moment when independent artists are already struggling to survive. A perfect storm of the COVID-19 pandemic, local venue shortages and record-high inflation means that touring \u2014 once a vital source of income \u2014 is for many artists a financial risk.\n\nEven established indie artists are feeling the crunch. Earlier this month, Animal Collective cancelled its European tour because they \u201ccould not make a budget for this tour that did not lose money even if everything went as well as it could.\u201d In September, Santigold cancelled her tour, noting that the last several years in a \u201crelentless industry\u201d has taken a toll on her mental and physical health.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lost touring. We\u2019ve lost direct album sales. And now, folks are losing our royalty payouts from radio,\u201d Apong told the Star. \u201cSo it\u2019s just like another blow, and so I think a lot of artists are pretty distraught.\u201d\n\nFor Turnbull, the disappearance of CBC Radio 3 from SiriusXM is part of a larger economic trend that has seen locally-sustained markets or communities absorbed by massive tech companies like Amazon or Spotify.\n\n\u201cThis really isn\u2019t an isolated problem,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis is a symptom of a deep stratification that\u2019s happening economically and culturally, where it\u2019s literally boom or bust. You\u2019re either like a millionaire off music, or it\u2019s a hobby for you. And there\u2019s increasingly a thin line between those two realities.\u201d\n\nSHARE:"}, {"url": "https://onlineradiobox.com/ca/siriusxm169/", "page_content": "Sirius XM - CBC Radio One - Channel 169 is a radio station on the Sirius XM internet radio network from Toronto, ON, Canada providing Public News, Talk, Information and Live shows.

It said it hopes programming changes will not have a negative effect on royalties to Canadian music creators.\n\nRoyalties are typically paid out quarterly or biannually by licensing companies like SOCAN and Sound Exchange in the United States. Each payout is dated eight to 12 months prior, meaning that it could take one to two years before the financial impacts are known.\n\nThe changes to SiriusXM programming became effective on Oct. 1."}, {"url": "https://www.siriusxm.com/channels/cbc-radio-one", "page_content": "How do you want to listen?\n\nPicking a plan can be tricky and we're here to help.\n\nTell us how you want to listen to SiriusXM, and any hardware details you know.
