Malcolm Brogdon was named NBA Rookie of the Year for the 2016-17 season.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Celtics acquired guard Malcolm Brogdon from the Indiana Pacers in a trade on Friday.\n\nBrogdon, who will turn 30 in December, averaged 19.1 points, 5.9 assists, and 5.1 rebounds for the Pacers last season and is signed through the 2024-25 season. He spent his first three seasons with the Milwaukee Bucks before joining the Pacers after the 2018-19 season.\n\nHere is what you need to know about the newest Celtic.\n\nHe played four years at Virginia\n\nIn what is increasingly becoming a rarity for top NBA prospects, Brogdon played four years of college basketball at Virginia. As a senior, he was named the ACC Player of the Year and was the conference\u2019s defensive player of the year two years in a row. He led the Cavaliers to the Elite Eight in the NCAA tournament before a loss to Syracuse denied them a trip to the Final Four.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nBrogdon has two degrees from Virginia \u2014 a Master\u2019s in public policy and an undergraduate degree in history.\n\nHe was named the NBA Rookie of the Year in 2016-17\n\nDespite his impressive college career, Brogdon slipped to the second round of the 2016 NBA Draft. He was finally selected by Milwaukee with the 36th pick overall, well after the Celtics picked Guerschon Yabusele (16th) and Ante Zizic (23rd), both of whom are out of the league.\n\nHe went on to average 10.2 points, 4.2 assists, and 2.8 rebounds for a Bucks team that won 42 games and was eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Toronto Raptors. The other two finalists for the award were forward Dario Saric and center Joel Embiid.\n\nHe was the first non-first-round pick to win the award in the common draft era.\n\nHe joined an exclusive club\n\nIn his third year in the league, he became the eighth player since 1987 to shoot 50 percent from the field, 40 percent from the 3-point line, and hit 90 percent of his free throws for a full season.\n\nIt\u2019s an impressive group, with Larry Bird turning the trick twice from 1986-88. Mark Price, Reggie Miller, Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Durant, and Stephen Curry also did it twice, while Steve Nash accomplished the feat four times.\n\nBrogdon joined the club in 2018-19 when he shot 50.5 percent from the floor, 42.6 percent from beyond the arc, and 92.8 percent from the line in his final season with the Bucks.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nKyrie Irving became the latest member of the group in 2020-21 with the Nets.\n\nInjuries have been a concern\n\nAfter playing 75 games in his rookie season, he missed 30 games with a partially torn left quadriceps tendon. In his third year in 2018-19, he missed the end of the regular season and the first round of the playoffs with a plantar fascia tear in his right foot.\n\nThis past season, he missed 41 games with pain in his Achilles.\n\nHe is active off the court\n\nBrogdon launched the Brogdon Family Foundation with a focus on two main initiatives: Hoops4Humanity and the JHA Education Project. Its vision, as posted on the foundation\u2019s website, \u201cseeks to create a more equitable world by empowering children, families, and communities to reach their potential and thrive.\u201d\n\nHoops4Humanity, which is modeled after former Patriots linebacker Chris Long\u2019s \u201cWaterboys\u201d initiative, is made up of NBA and WNBA players and \u201cpartners with community leaders to bring clean water and education infrastructure to improve health and educational outcomes.\u201d\n\nIn December of 2020, Brogdon was named the winner of the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award. Named after the NBA\u2019s second commissioner, the honor is presented by the Professional Basketball Writers Association to a player, coach, or athletic trainer who shows outstanding service and dedication to the community."}, {"url": "https://behindthebuckpass.com/2021/09/16/milwaukee-bucks-regrading-infamous-malcolm-brogdon-trade/", "page_content": "By this point, I\u2019m sure most Milwaukee Bucks fans are tired of hearing about the Malcolm Brogdon trade. I\u2019ll be honest, for a while, I was too! However, everyone who said the Bucks wouldn\u2019t win a championship because they let Brogdon go has an egg on their face. It\u2019s finally time we revisit this trade with open minds and open hearts because hey, the Bucks won a championship!\n\nOf course, the trade I am referring to is the Brogdon sign-and-trade deal to the Indiana Pacers from 2019, where the Bucks received three draft picks, with one being a first-round pick. Brogdon spent the first three seasons of his NBA career with the Bucks after being selected in the second round, 36th overall in the 2016 draft.\n\nBrogdon had a lot of success as a Buck, winning Rookie of the Year in 2016-17 and averaging 12.8 points, 3.5 rebounds, and 3.6 assists in 187 games (112 starts). He was one of the few hits the Bucks have gotten in the draft over the last 10 years, but he left the team as a restricted free agent to go to the Pacers.\n\nA lot was made of this trade when it happened and in the following three seasons. Brogdon has turned into a fantastic player for Indiana, as many expected he would. Personally, I don\u2019t hold any ill will towards Brogdon and I\u2019m glad he has been able to find a home with the Pacers and have a role he may not have had with the Bucks. Adam McGee did the initial grade for the deal, giving it a C letter grade, but let us go over it once again.\n\nThe financial impact of the Malcolm Brogdon trade for the Milwaukee Bucks\n\nPerhaps the biggest factor in some people\u2019s minds for the Brogdon trade was the financial aspect. Brogdon received a four-year, $85 million contract from the Pacers (well, technically the Bucks but you know what I mean) and for a lot of folks, it was seen as the Bucks being cheap and not wanting to pay Brogdon.\n\nThe Bucks did save on the luxury tax by not matching the offer that the Pacers gave Brogdon. I\u2019m sure that did play some part in why the Bucks chose not to bring him back, but as we\u2019ve seen, the Bucks have gone well into the luxury tax this offseason. I\u2019m not the person to defend owners not spending money, but they\u2019ve made it clear they\u2019ll spend into the tax.\n\nThe Bucks not bringing Brogdon back didn\u2019t create any extra space in the salary cap after they re-signed Brook Lopez that same offseason. It would have created a trade exception of around $10 million but due to some mismanagement of the cap with regards to the Lopez contract or Hill\u2019s guaranteed money, they did not get the trade exception.\n\nI still believe they should have matched the offer. The team was good enough to go into the tax for and Brogdon has proven to be worth the money, but we\u2019ll get into that now."}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/columnist/jeff-zillgitt/2017/01/05/milwaukee-bucks-malcolm-brogdon-nba-draft-virginia-acc/96214318/", "page_content": "Jeff Zillgitt\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nMalcolm Brogdon was 23 years old at the 2016 NBA draft in June, played four years at Virginia and turned 24 on December 11.\n\nHe also didn't have the wow factor, lacking the athleticism and potential NBA teams crave in the draft. Before the draft, he was red-flagged because of a foot surgery during the 2011-12 college season, scaring teams from taking him in the first round.\n\nCombine those facts, and that\u2019s why he was chosen No. 36 in the second round by the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nWow. Look at Brogdon now, producing and dunking on LeBron James and Kyrie Irving and averaging 8.5 points, 3.8 assists, 2.6 rebounds and shooting 41.3% on three-pointers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about what second-round picks usually do \u2013 whether it\u2019s D-League or whether it\u2019s not playing \u2013 but for me, I have high expectations of myself regardless of where I\u2019m picked,\u201d Brogdon said. \u201cI just wanted to have an impact for my team.\u201d\n\nFollow every game: Latest NBA Scores and Schedules\n\nWeek 9 NBA Rookie of the Year race: Bucks' Brogdon climbing\n\nJames Harden living 'a dream' in midst of magical season with Rockets\n\nFive NBA story lines to follow in 2017\n\nAmong rookies, Brogdon is first in assists per game; fourth in points per game; sixth in minutes per game (23.6), and first in three-point shooting percentage among players who play at least 15 minutes a game.\n\nWith guard Matthew Dellavedova (injured right hamstring) out, Bucks coach Jason Kidd has started Brogdon the past four games.\n\nBrogdon had 12 points, eight assists, six rebounds and no turnovers in a 105-104 victory against the New York Knicks Wednesday and became the first rookie this season to record a triple-double (15 points, 12 assists, 11 rebounds) in Saturday\u2019s 116-96 victory against the Chicago Bulls.\n\n\u201cHe just knows how to play,\u201d Kidd said. \u201cThere\u2019s no panic in his game.\u201d\n\nHe is the steal of the draft \u2013 an example of a team with a need taking the right player for the right situation and creating the perfect match for both. Though it may have cost him draft spots and money in the short term, Brogdon used his lengthy college experience to his advantage.\n\n\u201cIt helps you mature and form an identity and know who you are coming into the highest level of basketball,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t let it deter me at all or hurt my confidence. I\u2019m a guy who\u2019s always been underrated and under-ranked. This is part of my path. I take it on with an underdog mentality.\u201d\n\nBrogdon entered the league NBA-ready, capable of playing both ends of the court. He is mature, smart, willing to learn and is more veteran than rookie.\n\n\u201cYou talk about someone who wants to be good,\u201d Kidd said. \u201cHe works at his craft. You look at his basketball IQ. We trust him as a rookie offensive and defensively. He\u2019s taken the challenge to play at a high level and we\u2019re holding him accountable to that.\u201d\n\nBrogdon considered leaving Virginia after his redshirt junior season. But he was informed through diligent counsel that he might not be drafted in 2015 and was encouraged to return for his final season.\n\nWeek 9 NBA MVP race: Harden holds steady, Westbrook right behind\n\nWeek 9 NBA power rankings: Rockets, Jazz continue to rise\n\nRare is the NBA rookie with a college degree. Even rarer is the rookie with a master\u2019s degree. Brogdon has a history degree and advanced degree in public policy.\n\nHe is from a family of achievers. His mom, Jann Adams, is an associate professor of psychology and associate dean of the division of science and mathematics at Morehouse College. His father, Mitchell, and two brothers, Gino and John, have law degrees.\n\nIn interview after interview, teams were so impressed with Brogdon, they called his agent, Danielle Cantor, and told her similar versions of this:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the most impressive interview I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d and \u201cHe\u2019ll run for president someday.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew those interviews were important because these teams don\u2019t just draft off skill on the court,\u201d he said. \u201cThey draft in terms of character and how you carry yourself off the court.\u201d\n\nWhile at least one front-office exec was convinced Brogdon would go in the first round, he was available when Milwaukee picked at 36.\n\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s about placement,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about your skillset and how good you are but also who you play for and how your teammates take you under their wings.\n\n\u201cMy game from college has translated into the pros.

There were a number of misses in the rest of the lottery, but several teams struck gold with their selections later in the draft.\n\nTo name a few: Toronto getting Pascal Siakam at No. 27, San Antonio grabbing Dejounte Murray at No. 29 and Milwaukee drafting Malcolm Brogdon at No. 36. Oh, and Fred VanVleet, Gary Payton II and Alex Caruso went undrafted.\n\nSix years later, most of the players in the 2016 NBA Draft are entering their prime, which makes it an interesting time to revisit the top picks with a good old-fashioned redraft. Up to the task are TSN's Kyle Irving and Scott Rafferty, who alternated picks and made their selections based on who they think most deserves to go in the spot rather than what the team needs most.\n\nGot it? Great. Let's get to it.\n\nMORE: Yes, Ben Simmons is now the NBA's most underrated player\n\nRedrafting the 2016 NBA Draft\n\n1. Jaylen Brown, 76ers\n\nOriginal pick: Ben Simmons\n\nIf the 76ers were to take a do-over with this pick, I'd have a hard time believing they would go with anyone other than Brown. As great as Ingram, Siakam and Simmons have been, Brown just has the \"it\" factor you're looking for in a No. 1 pick.\n\nThe Celtics were originally criticized for taking Brown third overall. He was seen as a limited offensive player with a lot of improvement to be made before living up to a top-three selection. He has done nothing but grow as a player over his six seasons in the NBA, turning into one of the best two-way wings in the league.\n\nBrown has already been to four Eastern Conference Finals and, most recently, one NBA Finals. He has averaged 24.1 points, 6.1 rebounds and 3.4 assists per game over his last two seasons, developing a lethal pull-up jumper to go with his explosive athleticism.\n\nFactor in what a potential Brown and Joel Embiid pairing could look like, and I'm not sure you'd find a better suitor alongside the Sixers' All-Star center and franchise player.\n\n\u2014 Kyle Irving (@KyleIrv_)\n\n2. Brandon Ingram, Lakers\n\nOriginal pick: Brandon Ingram\n\nI don't think you can go wrong with Ingram, Siakam or Simmons here. Siakam was the second-best player on a championship team and now has two All-NBA selections. While flawed, Simmons is a perennial All-Star and one of the best defenders in the NBA.\n\nUltimately, I went with Ingram because I think he still has the most potential of the three. Already a one-time All-Star, Ingram has made real strides as a scorer and playmaker over the last couple of seasons, all of which came together in the Pelicans' first-round matchup with the Suns in the 2022 NBA Playoffs when he posted 27.0 points, 6.2 rebounds and 6.2 assists per game.\n\nIf Ingram, 25, builds on that, he could easily end up being the best player in this draft class.\n\n\u2014 Scott Rafferty (@crabdribbles)\n\n3. Pascal Siakam, Celtics\n\nOriginal pick: Jaylen Brown\n\nArguably the most accomplished player of this draft so far, Siakam was a no-brainer at No. 3 for me. Scott already mentioned he was the second-best player on a championship team, and his two All-NBA selections are the most in this class.\n\nComing off of the best season of his career, Siakam averaged 22.8 points, 8.5 rebounds and 5.3 assists en route to an All-NBA Third Team selection last season. To go from relatively unknown \u2014 selected with the No. 27 pick in the 2016 NBA Draft \u2014 to one of the best players in the NBA, Siakam has been an unlikely success story.\n\nYou could make an argument that he is one of the most improved players in the entire league since being drafted, with MVPs like Nikola Jokic and Giannis Antetokounmpo also coming to mind.\n\n\u2014 Irving\n\n4. Ben Simmons, Suns\n\nOriginal pick: Dragan Bender\n\nSure, Simmons hasn't developed like everyone hoped he would, but he's still a monstrous defender, a big-time scorer in the paint and an elite passer. As I said above, I gave him real consideration at No. 2. I don't think Simmons should fall any lower than this.\n\n\u2014 Rafferty\n\n5. Jamal Murray, Timberwolves\n\nOriginal pick: Kris Dunn\n\nDon't let Murray's year of ACL rehab in 2021-22 let you forget just how prolific the scoring guard is. The 25-year-old is one of the most talented young players in the league.\n\nHis 2019-20 playoff run was as impressive as it gets, scoring 142 points (!) over three games to help the Nuggets get past the Jazz in the first round. His two 50-point games and two 40-point games during that postseason are all you need to know about his ability to take over a contest or series.\n\nMurray will be quick to remind everyone just how electrifying he can be when he gets back on the court in 2022-23.\n\n\u2014 Irving\n\n6. Domantas Sabonis, Pelicans\n\nOriginal pick: Buddy Hield\n\nThe 2016 NBA Draft has produced seven All-Stars, two of which have earned multiple selections.\n\nThe first: Simmons. The second? Sabonis.\n\nFew players have undergone as dramatic of a transformation since entering the NBA as Sabonis. Once an inefficient stretch four, the Lithuanian is now a bruising center who has been good for 19.2 points and 12.2 rebounds per game over the last three seasons. He even shares some of the same vision as his father, making him one of the best passers at his position.\n\nThere's no question Sabonis is among the most gifted offensive players in this class, but his defensive limitations hold him back from cracking the top five in our redraft.\n\n\u2014 Rafferty\n\n7. Dejounte Murray, Nuggets\n\nOriginal pick: Jamal Murray\n\nMurray falling to No. 7 kind of feels like a steal. The 25-year-old had to overcome an ACL injury after earning an All-Defensive Team selection as a sophomore in the NBA, but he has bounced back in a big way.\n\nMurray has emerged as one of the best perimeter-defending guards in the league, and his offensive game has come along nicely. He recorded career-highs of 21.1 points, 9.2 assists, 8.3 rebounds and a league-leading 2.0 steals per game last year, making him the first player to ever average those numbers in a single season.\n\nFor perspective, Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson are the only players to ever reach the 20-8-8-2 threshold in a single season. You know you're doing something right when you're in the same sentence as those legends.\n\n\u2014 Irving\n\n8. Fred VanVleet, Kings\n\nOriginal pick: Marquese Chriss\n\nVanVleet didn't hear his name called at all in this draft. Crazy, right? He barely played in his rookie season with the Raptors, but he quickly went from one of the best sixth men in the league to an All-Star on the strength of his 3-point shooting and pesky defense. Undrafted to lottery pick is quite the jump.\n\n\u2014 Rafferty\n\n9. Buddy Hield, Raptors\n\nOriginal pick: Jakob Poeltl\n\nHield has turned into one of the best 3-point specialists in the NBA, averaging 3.0 3s per game on 39.8 percent shooting over his six-year career so far. He was the fastest player in NBA history to make 1,000 3-pointers, and no player in the league has more 3s made over the last four seasons than Hield.\n\n\u2014 Irving\n\n10. Malcolm Brogdon, Bucks\n\nOriginal pick: Thon Maker\n\nBrogdon appeared in 75 games in his rookie season. Since then, he's played over 60 games only once. The injury concerns are real, but he has proven to be a steady point guard when healthy, peaking in 2020-21 when he averaged a career-best 21.2 points per game to go along with 5.9 assists and 5.3 rebounds.\n\n\u2014 Rafferty\n\n11. Caris LeVert, Magic\n\nOriginal pick: Domantas Sabonis\n\nInjuries have derailed LeVert's career trajectory a bit, only playing 50 or more games in a season three times over his six years in the league. But when the 28-year-old is healthy, he's proved he can be a strong playmaking scorer, averaging 14.6 points and 4.0 assists per game.\n\nIf LeVert can stay healthy, he could make a run at Sixth Man of the Year for the new-look Cavaliers this upcoming season.\n\n\u2014 Irving\n\n12. Alex Caruso, Jazz\n\nOriginal pick: Taurean Prince\n\nCaruso's numbers don't jump off the page, but he's an elite perimeter defender.\n\nThis video tells you all you need to know:\n\nTwo minutes of Alex Caruso putting on the clamps when guys tried to take him one-on-one last year: pic.twitter.com/oLTXVq4tRo \u2014 Steph Noh (@StephNoh) August 22, 2022\n\n\u2014 Rafferty\n\n13. Jakob Poeltl, Suns\n\nOriginal pick: Georgios Papagiannis\n\nPoeltl isn't a flashy pick, but he has developed into one of the best rim protectors in the NBA. The only players with more blocks than Poeltl over the last two seasons are Rudy Gobert and Myles Turner. That's pretty decent company, if you ask me.\n\n\u2014 Irving\n\n14. Dorian Finney-Smith, Bulls\n\nOriginal pick: Denzel Valentine\n\nAnother star in his role, Finney-Smith had a career year in 2021-22 that saw him can 39.5 percent of his 3-point attempts and earn some All-Defensive votes.\n\n\u2014 Rafferty\n\nBest players still available: Ivica Zubac, Malik Beasley, Gary Payton II, Taurean Prince"}, {"url": "https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_2016.html", "page_content": "Click the Team for players drafted by that franchise.\n\nClick the College for players drafted from that college.\n\nClick the Pk for players drafted in that slot.\n\nMatthew Maurer of TheDraftReview is an NBA Draft historian who has researched and collected the data on the entire history of the NBA Draft.

But after nearly two months of the 2016-17 season, the rookie (from the class of 2016: non-Joel Embiid division) playing the best basketball is in fact\u2026Malcolm Brogdon?\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks selected Brogdon with the seventh pick of the second round (36th overall) after an impressive four-year career at the University of Virginia which saw him win NABC Defensive Player of the Year, ACC Player of the Year, ACC Defensive Player of the Year, and be named as a consensus All-American.\n\nEarly on this season, Brogdon has shown those accolades were bestowed upon him for a reason; he might have been a second round pick, but Brogdon can play. If there is a silver lining in Khris Middleton\u2019s long-term hamstring injury, it would be the opportunity it presented to Brogdon, who has certainly seen more action than he would have if Middleton was healthy. The 6-foot-5 Brogdon has seized that opportunity, using his size, experience, and smarts to quickly become an integral part of the Bucks\u2019 rotation.\n\nRead More: Aaron Gordon is being badly misused\n\nAt 21.1 minutes a night, Brogdon already plays the fifth most minutes on the Bucks, and of three-man lineups that have played at least 150 minutes, Brogdon is a part of the four best in terms of net rating.\n\nAfter his first 23 games, Brogdon is in the top-10 among rookies for all major categories except rebounding. And when you filter for just rookies drafted this season, Brogdon moves into the top-six of all of those categories save for rebounding. He won\u2019t win the Rookie of the Year Award, which has likely already been engraved with the name of Joel Embiid, but Brogdon has shown the potential to be a very solid 3-and-D style player (check out his rookie season per-36 numbers side by side with Shane Battier\u2019s) moving forward.\n\nStat Brogdon\u2019s Averages Rookie Rank (Class of \u201816) Minutes 21.1 9th (5th) Points 7.7 6th (4th) Assists 2.8 2nd (2nd) Rebounds 2.2 16th (13th) Shooting Percentage 40.9% 8th (6th) 3-Point Shooting Percentage 45.1% 1st (1st) (10th in league) Assist To Turnover Ratio 2.29 1st (1st) (34th in league) PER 12.29 5th (3rd)\n\nThe two main areas where Brogdon is making a difference for the Bucks this season are 3-point shooting and defense. (Though in addition he has also shown the ability to handle the ball and run the offense with limited mistakes as shown by his stellar assist to turnover ratio.) The 3-point shooting is obvious when looking at the stats (45.1 percent \u2014 first among rookies, 10th in the league); on the other end of the floor he has the fourth-best defensive rating on the Bucks (103.1) and is sixth among rookies with one steal per game, but of course stats cannot tell the whole story. Let\u2019s take a closer look at how Brogdon is helping the Bucks in these two areas this season.\n\n3-point shooting\n\nAs noted above, Brogdon is having a spectacular season shooting the ball from downtown. Brogdon was solid from downtown in college, hitting at a 36.5 percent (39.1 percent in his senior season) clip, but the uptick in his first pro season is a welcome surprise for a Bucks team that shot just 34.5 percent on 3s last year (22nd in the league) and coming into this year had no returning healthy players who shot over 30 percent one 3-pointers last season (save for Steve Novak, who rarely plays).\n\nSo far this year, the Bucks are once again struggling from downtown, shooting 34.3 percent, but it would be much worse if not for the sharp shooting of Brogdon. The rookie gets most of his 3-point looks on spot-ups, creating an outlet for his teammates (especially Giannis) should they get double-teamed or bottled up in the paint.\n\nHere\u2019s one play in particular in which Brogdon gets an open look thanks to attention Giannis draws. As Giannis controls on the wing, DeMarre Carroll shades over to provide help on Giannis.\n\nOnce the Greek Freak begins to probe, Carroll completely abandons Brogdon to shut off the driving lane.\n\nGiannis spots his open teammate, and despite Carroll\u2019s hustle to get back into the play, Brogdon is able to knock down the open look.\n\nWith Giannis playing at an All-Star level, teams are almost always going to throw an extra defender at him. So far, Brogdon has done a solid job of making teams pay when they leave him on the perimeter. Here\u2019s a sampling of him knocking down shots off kick-outs from Giannis.\n\nDefense\n\nAt 6-foot-5 (with a 6-foot-10 wingspan) and 215 pounds, Brogdon has terrific size and length at the guard position, which, coupled with his impressive quickness and footwork, allows him to guard multiple positions. Whether it\u2019s dealing with bigger guards like DeMar DeRozan, or staying with the likes of Stephen Curry and John Wall, Brogdon has shown that the defensive capabilities that led him to multiple collegiate defensive player of the year awards as a senior translate quite well to the NBA.\n\nHere is Brogdon sticking with Curry both on-ball and off.\n\nBrogdon, meeting Damian Lillard on the break, moving his feet, and contesting the shot without fouling.\n\nBrogdon, moving his feet and fighting around screens to force the ball out of Wall\u2019s hands.\n\nNow it\u2019s easy to just pick a few clips of Brogdon looking good, but they represent a larger trend. Brogdon is often dealing with great offensive players. Curry, Lillard, and Wall are all vets and among the top-13 in scoring this season. Brogdon\u2019s ability to step right in and help contain other team\u2019s top options is a big part of the Bucks having the 12th ranked defense (103.7 defensive rating) in the league this season.\n\nAfter a big win over the Chicago Bulls on TNT Thursday night, the Bucks sit at 12-12 and hold the eighth and final playoff spot. Over the next four months, Malcolm Brogdon will play a key role as the Bucks try to hold on to that spot and make their return to the postseason.\n\nStats (via ESPN, NBA.com, and Basketball Reference) current as of 12/14/16"}, {"url": "https://www.brewhoop.com/2016/6/23/12022538/milwaukee-bucks-malcolm-brogdon", "page_content": "After surprising many with their lottery selection, the Bucks went a little more conventional with the 36th pick in the second round, selecting Malcolm Brogdon out of Virginia.\n\nThe 23-year-old guard stands 6'6\" with a 6'10.5\" wingspan, making it zero percent shocking that the Bucks had interest in him. They previously had met with him at the NBA Draft Combine in Chicago.\n\nBrogdon may not possess the massive upside that a younger prospect would, but his impact was felt all over the court in his four years at Virginia. Among 2016 wing prospects, Brogdon ranked behind only Buddy Hield in pace-adjusted points per 40 minutes (23.9), led all draft prospects with an exceptional 89.7% mark from the free throw line, and connected on nearly 40 percent of his three point attempts. DraftExpress saw plenty to like from Brogdon after an impressive performance at the Chicago predraft combine:\n\nThe 23-year-old two-guard looked like the best pure basketball player among all four 5-on-5 teams as he was able to distribute as the primary ball handler, knock down open shots, and finish over length and through contact all while locking up on the defensive end.\n\n\n\nThere's not a ton of flash to Brogdon's game -\u0080\u0094 he's not an explosive athlete and he doesn't have the most beautiful shooting stroke -\u0080\u0094 but he's been a winner at every level (his team won by 40 points on Thursday) and most certainly stood out as the most NBA-ready player to play 5-on-5. At 6' 5.5\" with a 6' 10.5\" wingspan and a strong 223-pound frame, Brogdon found some success playing on the ball on Thursday, especially out of ball screens.\n\n\n\nHe doesn't exactly turn the corner in isolation situations, but he showed that he's a sound ball handler versus pressure and has the IQ to facilitate against a variety of pick and roll coverages. Brogdon may not be loaded with upside but he has a winning mentality, is a tremendous defender, can make standstill jumpers and knows how to make up for some of his athletic limitations as a half-court scorer. He's a safe pick for a team in the late first or early second round, and could very well rise with more strong performances during the pre-draft process.\n\nThe Bucks are done drafting tonight. They sold the 38th pick to the Warriors for cash. We'll have more coverage tonight and tomorrow, as Thon Maker is expected to have a press conference in the afternoon."}, {"url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/07/01/sports/malcolm-brogdon-was-2017-rookie-year-other-things-know-about-new-celtics-guard/", "page_content": "Here is what you need to know about the newest Celtic.\n\nBrogdon, who will turn 30 in December, averaged 19.1 points, 5.9 assists and 5.1 rebounds for the Pacers last season and is signed through the 2024-25 season.
