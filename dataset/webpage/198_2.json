Riccardo Tisci made shark teeth and nose ring motifs at Givenchy, the label which he designed for 12 years until January 2017. At Givenchy, Tisci took a Parisian house best known for its links with Audrey Hepburn and put smoking, burnt-out wrecks of cars on the catwalk, Kardashians in the front row, and emeralds dangling from the septums of models.\n\nBurberry champions British traditions, and dressed a smiling Duchess of Cambridge for last year\u2019s Vogue cover. Tisci is known for darkly subversive, unapologetically sexual, deeply urban, boundary-pushing fashion and talked Kanye West into wearing a black leather kilt during his 2011 Watch the Thrones tour.\n\nWhat links Riccardo Tisci to Burberry is its CEO Marco Gobbetti. It was Gobbetti who appointed Tisci, then a relatively unknown 30-year-old designer showing an own-name collection at Milan fashion week, to Givenchy in 2005. The appointment suggests that Gobbetti, who joined Burberry from Celine last summer, will not be relying on a light touch in his turnaround plan for the company, which grew from a heritage brand into a fashion powerhouse during Bailey\u2019s tenure but has struggled in recent years as the luxury market enters a slowdown phase.\n\nOne of Riccardo Tisci\u2019s creations for Givenchy. Photograph: Francois Guillot/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe announcement indicates Gobbetti intends a root and branch overhaul of Burberry\u2019s brand image. He has an impressive track record: after the re-energisation of Givenchy alongside Tisci, he moved to Celine, where he masterminded the transformation of that brand into a profitable and agenda-setting star of Paris fashion week.\n\nGobbetti has already jangled shareholder nerves at Burberry by indicating that he intends to reposition the brand to be more upmarket. \u201cBy reenergising our product and customer experience to establish our position firmly in luxury, we will play in the most rewarding, enduring section of the market,\u201d he said in a statement. The appointment of Tisci to a role where many were expecting a British appointment is a bold move, but analysts cannot fail to be impressed by Tisci and Gobbetti\u2019s joint history of commercial success at Givenchy, where stores did a brisk business in crisp modern tailoring and sleek black leather handbags during their tenure.\n\nTisci will bring a mass audience, and a youthful following, to Burberry. He was the designer of Kim Kardashian\u2019s wedding dress for her marriage to Kanye West, of the leather hot pants and thigh-high boots worn by Rihanna on her Diamonds world tour in 2013, and of Beyonce\u2019s latex gown at the 2016 Met Gala. He will be based in London, where he last lived during the 1990s as a student at Central St Martins.\n\nTraditional British brand Burberry is known for its trenchcoats and dressing the Duchess of Cambridge for a Vogue cover. Photograph: Josh Olin/PA\n\nTisci has been ahead of the curve in almost all of the most important ways fashion has shifted over the last decade. He has a longstanding love of streetwear. He pioneered the sweatshirt as a statement fashion piece during his tenure at Givenchy, and is a respected designer of trainers, partnering with Nike for a long-running collaboration.\n\nWhen Tisci began putting the Givenchy slogan onto sweatshirts, critics sniped that it was moving a storied brand downmarket, but now that streetwear brands are power players \u2013 the New York based skatewear label Supreme was recently valued at $1bn \u2013 the alignment looks impressively prescient.\n\nOne standout line from Burberry\u2019s announcement notes that Tisci\u2019s \u201cskill in blending streetwear with high fashion is highly relevant to today\u2019s luxury consumer\u201d. His spring/summer 2013 collection was one of many Givenchy shows which experimented with religious imagery, a theme which has stayed in the fashion consciousness since. In two months\u2019 time, Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination will open at the Metropolitan Museum in New York.\n\nAndrogyny and gender fluidity are also recurring themes in Tisci\u2019s collections, and he has championed the career of Lea T, who became the first transgender model to land a major beauty contract when she signed for Redken in 2014. Tisci employed Lea as an assistant and fit model, and cast her in a Givenchy advertising campaign in 2010.\n\nIn the year since Tisci left Givenchy, rumour had persistently linked him with Versace. His close friendship with Donatella, and the fierce, unapologetically sexual aesthetic which he shares with her, led many to believe he was being lined up as her successor."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/14/interview-burberry-designer-riccardo-tisci", "page_content": "On the evening I interview Burberry\u2019s chief creative officer Riccardo Tisci, London has an atmosphere close to boiling point. A stone\u2019s throw away from the brand\u2019s HQ, Boris Johnson has just entered 10 Downing Street for the first time, to jeers from protesters. Anti-Brexit demonstrators roam Parliament Square. Commuters on their way home try to manage the late July heatwave, some with ice lollies, others with pints. Some have given up entirely and are just sitting on the pavement, totally frazzled.\n\nFrazzled is not a word that gets much use at the top of Burberry Towers. The rooftop is all members\u2019 club discretion \u2013 bleached wood furniture, bowls of gigantic roses and perfectly chilled, iced sparkling water. The designer has specified this location, where some might have suggested their office, maybe, or a carefully chosen buzzy restaurant. If Burberry is a brand based on a very British weather system of cloudy with a chance of rain, Tisci is different. Born near Lake Como in Italy, he\u2019s accustomed to sunshine.\n\nThis becomes clear when he sits down and launches into his summer plans. \u201cI am going to Como to celebrate my birthday,\u201d he says. \u201cThen Mykonos\u2026 Me and all best friends who live in different countries, we meet there in August. A nice villa in the middle of nowhere\u2026 I love it. If you want to go and eat fish, you go and eat fish; if you want to sleep, you sleep; or if you want to get drunk all together \u2013 it\u2019s nice. The sea, the food, the fish, the tomatoes, everything.\u201d These words tumble out of Tisci\u2019s mouth, and he finishes with a grin, and a sip of the iced coffee he arrived with. Anyone after more of this scenario would do well to join 2.5m others and follow Tisci on Instagram. This year\u2019s destinations include a boat in Ibiza (he is pictured topless, wetsuit pulled down to his waist) and New York for Pride (surrounded by friends, all in hotpants). Or look up his 40th birthday in Ibiza \u2013 a decadent affair with Kate Moss, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner and Naomi Campbell attending.\n\n\u2018When you do well for yourself in France you get the Chanel bag, in England you get the Burberry trench\u2019. Photograph: Shaniqwa Jarvis/The Guardian\n\nToday, like most days, the gym-honed 45-year-old \u2013 \u201cI am Leo with a moon ascending Gemini\u201d \u2013 wears a black T-shirt of his own design with TB (Thomas Burberry) logo, black basketball shorts and well-worn, even slightly bobbly, black Nike socks with swoosh. He carries a Burberry bumbag with a packet of American Spirit peeking out. If you didn\u2019t know he was a designer, you might think he worked in the music industry.\n\nThis look signals that Tisci is a departure for Burberry. Google Image Christopher Bailey, the previous chief creative officer for 17 years, and you\u2019ll see what I mean. Bailey is much more a crisp shirt and occasional blazer kind of man, the uniform of the discreetly wealthy. Bailey\u2019s collections reflected this taste, too. They often came with a blue-chip British bookish reference \u2013 the Bloomsbury group, say, or David Hockney \u2013 and a BBC Radio 6 Music-approved sound: Paloma Faith, Keane, Jake Bugg. Samantha Cameron and Kate Middleton wore the clothes.\n\nAnd Bailey\u2019s Burberry was successful. Thanks to him, the brand is now Proper Fashion, with the London fashion week show a hot ticket every season. But Bailey\u2019s Burberry was not really cool. Tisci, by contrast, is one of fashion\u2019s current arbiters of that intangible quality. Previously the creative director of Givenchy for 12 years, he designed the wedding outfits for his good friends Kanye and Kim, and has a long-running collaboration with Nike. Madonna, Frank Ocean and Marina Abramovi\u0107 are part of his friendship group (he bought a house with the artist). Since Tisci joined Burberry last year, the brand has worked with MIA (even persuading the edgy musician to appear in the slightly cheesy format of a Christmas advert) and dressed Gen Z favourites Ariana Grande, Rihanna and Gigi Hadid. Such is Tisci\u2019s influence that model Freja Beha Erichsen \u2013 who is Kind of a Big Deal in fashion, with 24 Vogue covers to her name and a starring role in Burberry\u2019s autumn ad campaign \u2013 rejigged her schedule to be part of this shoot.\n\nRiccardo Tisci with his good friends Kanye West and Madonna. Photograph: Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nAt Givenchy, Tisci turned a couture relic most associated with Audrey Hepburn\u2019s LBDs into the height of millennial cool \u2013 specifically appealing to the hypebeast demographic who might also wear streetwear labels Supreme and Palace. Originally known for his gothic aesthetic, streetwear started appearing on the catwalk around 2011. Hypebeasts swiftly signed up \u2013 they loved the T-shirts with a snarling rottweiler print, the basketball vests, the plaid shirt with studs. And at around \u00a3360 for one of those T-shirts, they were within reach \u2013 more affordable than a four-figure gown, anyway. This was part of the strategy \u2013 that, and his duties as a good uncle. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go home for Christmas and have my sisters\u2019 kids say, \u2018It\u2019s beautiful, what you do, but I can\u2019t afford it,\u2019\u201d Tisci explains. \u201cThat killed me. I wanted them to come to me and say, \u2018I have been saving money to buy the Bambi T-shirt.\u2019\n\n\u201c[At first], nobody was caring about it. Slowly but slowly, it was selling, selling, getting bigger,\u201d Tisci continues. \u201c[Then] everybody wants a piece and everybody starts doing it. I don\u2019t mind it because whenever the younger generation talk about that, they always mention my name.\u201d Tisci\u2019s success meant high street brands started producing their own take. You might not know his name but he is the reason you have a statement sweatshirt, the reason the phrase \u201cposh tracksuit trousers\u201d is not an oxymoron.\n\nReworking the check. Tisci\u2019s Burberry designs bring the classic to the radar of a new generation.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that Tisci is intrigued by a part of Burberry\u2019s history that was, until now, a touchy subject: its association with \u201cchav\u201d culture. In 2002, actor Danniella Westbrook was snapped in a Burberry check skirt with matching handbag. Her daughter wore a matching kilt, and sat in a Burberry check pushchair. The label was also spotted on football terraces. By being associated with the working-classes, the luxury brand was seen as losing its way. While check had already been reintroduced by Bailey, with a 2018 collaboration with streetwear designer Gosha Rubchinskiy, Tisci has reassessed the idea of \u201cchav\u201d. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t say it, but last season it was a little bit the inspiration,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it is great because I come from the streets.\u201d The AW collection, entitled Tempest, included streetwear, sophisticated classics and that oh-so-familiar check, reworked with a darker khaki and the punchy graphics that Tisci fans flock to.\n\nDesigners from humble backgrounds are nothing new \u2013 Alexander McQueen, Vivienne Westwood, Bailey himself - but Tisci has a genuine rags to riches story. Born in 1974, he grew up the youngest child \u2013 and only boy \u2013 of nine children. He wore his sisters\u2019 pink hand-me-downs to school. His father died when Tisci was four and the siblings had to work to keep the family afloat. He has spoken before about one meal a day being the norm, how he was helping his uncle with plastering from the age of 11. It\u2019s all a long way from rooftops with a view of the Houses of Parliament.\n\nTisci\u2019s unlikely success is, he says, down to \u201cangels I have crossed in my life\u201d. The first arrived when he stopped attending primary school. \u201cThe teachers came to my house, Miss Besio and Mr Borriero. They said to my mum, \u2018Your son needs to study because he has something different to all the other children.\u2019\u201d Tisci stayed in school. This continued in London \u2013 on an internship, fellow designer Antonio Berardi saw his illustrations and sent Tisci to renowned fashion college Central Saint Martins. While there, tutor Willie Walters ensured he received a grant so he was able to study. Tisci was made creative director of Givenchy in 2005, aged 29. \u201cI am a self-made person,\u201d he says now, with a drag of an American Spirit. \u201cMy mum gave me love but that is the only thing she gave me.\u201d (Tisci is prone to these telenovela-ish soundbites, which is understandable when you find out he has a story worthy of a box set.)\n\nRihanna wears a Burberry trench on stage at a Fenty Beauty event. Photograph: Mark Ganzon/Getty\n\nTisci sees a kindred spirit in Thomas Burberry, who started the eponymous brand in 1856, at the age of 21, in the far from fashionable environs of Basingstoke. He invented gabardine, the waterproof fabric that went on to be used for the trenchcoat, in 1879. Adopted by explorers and intrepid types including Ernest Shackleton and Betty Kirby-Green, Burberry trenches were worn in the trenches in the first world war. By 1965, it\u2019s said that one in every five coats exported from the UK was made by Burberry. These days, the brand employs around 10,000 people and is the only luxury fashion brand in the FTSE 100. It also looms large in British style. In the time I have been working on this interview, I have seen Tisci-designed Burberry tote bags on the tube, the check on a woman\u2019s scarf in the supermarket, a trench, with rolled-up check sleeves, in a cocktail bar.\n\nTisci says Thomas is central to his reworking of Burberry, so much so that he changed the Burberry logo \u2013 with the help of Peter Saville \u2013 to feature the founder\u2019s initials. \u201cThe company should still be an institution but at the same time we need to have the perception of human,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a business company.\u201d That may seem a bit soppy to any board members reading this, but his nose for hits is well-known \u2013 Burberry\u2019s share price went up 5% when his appointment was announced. There\u2019s still work to do, though: even after a 4% rise in sales, analysts at the Bernstein Group downgraded Burberry to \u201cunderperform\u201d in August.\n\nTisci\u2019s track record for courting millennials suggests this is just a blip. He\u2019s started Burberry\u2019s B Series which plays into the \u201cdrop\u201d culture of streetwear \u2013 a new product is released on the 17th of each month (August\u2019s was a dog hoodie, personalisable with the lucky pooch\u2019s name), and reliably sells out in minutes. Another addition is T-shirts, scarves and bags covered in unicorns. If that sounds like a cynical ploy to appeal to fans of emojis and pool inflatables, the story has the authenticity this cohort highly prizes. A search of the archive revealed an alternative insignia from the brand\u2019s famous knight \u2013 a unicorn, designed by Burberry for his family. \u201cIn the day it was a horse, in the night it became a unicorn,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cI thought it was a very beautiful thing. In a way, it\u2019s very relatable to what happened in my life\u2026 My sisters were like Thomas Burberry. During the day, they have to be strong warriors, but in the night they would take off all this armour and be very sweet mothers to me.\u201d\n\nFamily comes first for Tisci. He remains very close to his mother, who is now 90. His formative experiences of fashion came from watching his eight sisters \u2013 who, he says, are four pairs of best friends \u2013 get ready to go out, when he was a child. \u201cThey would be in the bathroom, putting makeup on. I was sitting on the bathtub thinking, one day I can go out and meet the people around the world.\u201d\n\nTisci has said before that he took the Givenchy job so he could buy his mother a house. His break with the brand was also prompted by family \u2013 at the funeral of his brother-in-law in 2016, he realised his mother was getting older, his nieces and nephews were growing up. And he wanted in. \u201cI wanted to be the son of my mother, the brother of my sister, that I have never been really because life never gave me the opportunity,\u201d he says. He quit Givenchy the following spring. The announcement went out while he was in a desert in Algeria, with his phone switched off.\n\nSitting back. Model Freja Beha Erichsen wearing Burberry. Photograph: Shaniqwa Jarvis/The Guardian\n\nThe next year was low-key. He had, he says, \u201cno agenda\u201d. \u201cLike anyone when you are busy, you have a PA, a PR,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes you want to go to buy your toothpaste, you want to discover what is the new cream for your skin, not always have somebody going for you.\u201d He slept a lot and he travelled, going to Portugal with his family and backpacking around Costa Rica. That is, until Burberry called. Tisci was brought back to fashion by the man who brought him into it in the first place \u2013 Marco Gobbetti, now CEO of Burberry (with an annual salary of \u00a37.3m, as was recently revealed), but then at Givenchy. \u201cMarco is the person who saved my career and gave me the opportunity to be who I am today,\u201d Tisci says, with that frisson of drama. The trench was also enticing. \u201cWhen you behave well at school, in France you get the Chanel bag,\u201d he says. \u201cIn England you get the Burberry trench. It\u2019s something I discovered here. Adele told me the first thing she bought when her first single came out was a Burberry trench.\u201d Tisci\u2019s first collection for Burberry featured 20 trenches.\n\nBut will the perception of a brand \u2013 and an item \u2013 so associated with Britishness change post-Brexit? \u201cBritish is not my culture but I am representing a very important British house,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cFor me to celebrate Britishness and bring it to America, China, it\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\nI would guess Tisci was Remain \u2013 inclusivity and diversity are his MO. He championed casting people of colour well before the rest of fashion woke up to the idea. He also cast his friend Lea T, a trans woman, in an ad campaign in 2010, helping her financially and opening the door to models such as Hari Nef, Andreja Pejic and Nathan Westling. \u201cI got so much shit. You cannot imagine,\u201d he says. \u201cThank God we had people like Oprah Winfrey who said, \u2018Stop a second, he is doing something that is right.\u2019 When somebody more powerful says something, it changes.\u201d Family Tisci were a support network, too. \u201cWhen she [Lea T] decided to become a woman and her family didn\u2019t accept her, my mum took her to our house and she lived with us,\u201d he says. \u201cShe treated Lea as a daughter. Lea still says, \u2018Your mum is the first person to call me she, not he.\u2019\u201d\n\nTisci is definitely an ally to a socially aware generation (Burberry\u2019s policy of burning clothes and its use of fur ended soon after he joined). But he doesn\u2019t always get it right. There was a skirmish after the autumn show when model Liz Kennedy compared the fastening on a hoodie to a noose on social media. \u201cSuicide is not fashion,\u201d she wrote. \u201cRiccardo Tisci and everyone at Burberry it is beyond me how you could let a look resembling a noose hanging from a neck out on the runway.\u201d While other brands have seen items that cause offence reach stores \u2013 both Gucci and Prada have had scandals around designs with racist imagery \u2013 this was swiftly shut down. In a statement, Tisci said, \u201cIt does not reflect my values nor Burberry\u2019s and we have removed it from the collection.\u201d\n\nThe good ship Burberry: Tisci brings a twist to Burberry\u2019s heritage with graphic prints and a new logo. Photograph: Shaniqwa Jarvis/The Guardian\n\nWhile Tisci says he isn\u2019t a political person, he does concede he has a platform. \u201cIf it\u2019s to fight for rights, to help people, I am the first one,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it\u2019s about going to sit at a table and talk about money, numbers and power, that is, like you say here, not my cup of tea.\u201d\n\nNow back in London for over a year, Tisci lives in Mayfair (he did consider Marylebone, where his friend Madonna has a house), trains every day in a local gym and watches what he eats. Then, once in a while, he lets himself go. Tisci has gone to raves, festivals \u2013 \u201cI never thought I would be a festival person\u201d \u2013 and gigs: Rosal\u00eda, the buzzy Spanish singer, Bj\u00f6rk, Primal Scream. The evening we speak, he is having drinks with singer Dua Lipa. Next up, his birthday, celebrated quietly with family. I\u2019m not taking his word for it \u2013 it\u2019s all documented on Instagram a few days later. The designer looks content, lake in the background, Aperol spritz on the table, surrounded by his sisters and mother. Rooftops in London are all very well but for Tisci, there\u2019s still no place like home."}, {"url": "https://www.businessoffashion.com/community/people/riccardo-tisci", "page_content": "Riccardo Tisci is an Italian designer, renowned for his work at Givenchy, a French house that Tisci resurrected to its former profitable glory and his latest work at Burbery. Impressively, the designer crafted distinct brand identities for all of Givenchy\u2019s product categories across women\u2019s and men\u2019s ready-to-wear and haute couture lines. At Burberry, he lifted sales after faltering period, and revamping the company's brand identity.\n\nTisci grew up in a tight-knit, single-parent, working-class family in Italy. The designer describes his family life as hugely influential on him and remembers his childhood as one filled with love. Tisci left regular school aged 11 to enroll in art school in Milan. \u201cI wanted to express myself and I couldn't really do it through words at that point,\" he told The Daily Telegraph. The designer was selected for a scholarship by Central Saint Martins, from which he graduated in 1999. He then held design positions at Puma, Antonio Berardi and with Ruffo Research, before embarking on his own brand in 2004. As a result of his bold, powerfully-feminine designs, Tisci was announced as the creative director of Givenchy\u2019s womenswear and haute couture lines in 2005. After announcing his amicable departure from the house in February 2017 with a subsequent sabbatical, Tisci was named chief creative officer at Burberry in March 2018, succeeding Christopher Bailey .\n\nTisci\u2019s creations found willing consumers immediately; the designer\u2019s vision for Givenchy initially found traction with consumers rather than editors. In just two years Tisci had revitalised the house\u2019s couture business. He chose to stop showing couture in 2012, taking the business behind the scenes in-house once more.\n\nIn May 2008 he was appointed chief designer of menswear and menswear accessories in addition to his womenswear role. His menswear collections have received rampant critical acclaim and caused the formation of tribe-like followers, many of whom, such as Kanye West, are very much in the public eye. Tisci\u2019s marriage of streetwear influences, Parisian sensibilities and global motifs made Givenchy\u2019s printed sweatshirts a fashion staple, as well as broadening the brand\u2019s appeal exponentially.\n\nFollowing over a decade of experience at the creative helm of Givenchy, Tisci transitioned to Burberry, an announcement that sent share prices soaring by over 5 percent. Joining Marco Gobetti a second time, who also joined Burberry as its chief executive following a stint at Givenchy, Tisci took on plans to reinvigorate product and consumer experiences and expand Burberry's first venture into high end streetwear after a partnership with Gosha Rubchinsky in 2018. Under Tisci's watch, both Burberry's London flagship location and it's monogram logo underwent a revamp, the latter of which debuted with a series of international pop-up installations featuring the new Peter Saville -designed Burberry logo. Following the highly anticipated first Spring/Summer 2019 collection and logo redesign, Burberry reported a 4 percent rise in first quarter comparable store sales in 2019."}, {"url": "https://tidingsinfo.com/riccardo-tisci/", "page_content": "Who is Riccardo Tisci?\n\nRiccardo Tisci is an Italian fashion designer.

Tisci succeeds Christopher Bailey, who announced his departure in October 2017 after 17 years with the company.\n\nTisci joins the British megabrand after more than a decade as creative director at Givenchy, where he is credited with resurrecting the LVMH-owned couture house with his dark, sensual and subversive collections. The Italian designer left the brand on January 31, 2017 when his contract ended. He was replaced by Clare Waight Keller.\n\nIn his new role, Tisci will be based in London and direct all of Burberry\u2019s collections, presenting his first outing for the brand in September 2018. The announcement sent the company's share price up more than five percent.\n\n\"Riccardo is one of the most talented designers of our time. His designs have an elegance that is contemporary and his skill in blending streetwear with high fashion is highly relevant to today's luxury consumer. Riccardo's creative vision will reinforce the ambitions we have for Burberry and position the brand firmly in luxury,\u201d said Marco Gobetti, Burberry\u2019s chief executive who joined the company on July 5, 2017, from LVMH-owned C\u00e9line.\n\n\"I have an enormous respect for Burberry's British heritage and global appeal and I am excited about the potential of this exceptional brand,\u201d added Tisci. \u201cI am honoured and delighted to be joining Burberry and reuniting with Marco Gobbetti.\u201d\n\nIndeed, this is not the first time Tisci and Gobbetti have worked together. Gobetti, who was previously president and chief executive at Givenchy from 2004 to 2008, was responsible for hiring the designer, who was then relatively unknown. Tisci breathed much-needed life into Givenchy's womenswear, menswear and accessories.\n\nSince joining Burberry in 2001, Bailey worked with former chief executive Rose Marie Bravo and her successor Angela Ahrendts to save the British stalwart \u2014 best known for its classic, durable trench coats \u2014 from a period of brand dilution.\n\nDuring his tenure, Burberry became a new star of the global luxury industry. By 2011, the company was generating \u00a31.5 billion in revenue \u2014 a 27 percent increase over the previous year \u2014 with a market capitalisation of \u00a35.8 billion. That was twice the rate of growth of LVMH\u2019s revenue and market value over the same period. At the same time, Burberry gained recognition for its digital savvy. But it\u2019s no secret that in recent years Burberry has struggled to maintain its momentum, with the company\u2019s sales growth lagging its peers.\n\nTaking Burberry Upmarket\n\nLast November, Gobbetti outlined an ambitious three-pronged plan to elevate the British brand's positioning, placing the label \"firmly in the luxury segment, the most enduring and rewarding part of the industry.\" As part of the strategy, Gobbetti plans to enhance the brand's leather goods offering, bring greater newness to its collections, tighten distribution by scaling back its lower-end wholesale partnerships, refresh stores and use its reputation as a digital innovator to better communicate its new product offering.\n\n\u201cBy re-energising our product and customer experience to establish our position firmly in luxury, we will play in the most rewarding, enduring segment of the market,\u201d Gobbetti said in a statement that coincided with the announcement of first-half results for the 2017 fiscal year.\n\nBurberry is betting that Tisci's expertise in elevating casual wear to high-fashion status will increase the label's relevancy amongst luxury consumers, according to a source close to the brand. (Burberry has already entered the streetwear category with conviction, unveiling a partnership with skater-inspired label Gosha Rubchinskiy for Spring/Summer 2018.) It's a strategy with validity: High-end streetwear helped boost global sales of luxury personal goods by 5 percent this year to an estimated \u20ac263 billion, and the sector is projected to grow 5 percent through 2020, according to a report from consulting firm Bain & Co.\n\n\"The contemporary street style orientation of Riccardo Tisci is a great match to relaunch the image of Burberry,\" wrote Mario Ortelli, senior analyst of luxury goods at Stanford C. Bernstein, in a note. \"We believe that Burberry's management will try to emulate the action plan of Gucci.\" This includes the clearance of previous collections in the next two to three quarters; launching new campaigns and initiatives; presenting an impactful and bold collection at London Fashion Week in September; extend the new style to other product lines and lowering price points to reach a wider consumer base; and renewing the store network progressively.\n\nThe main questions now, said Ortelli, are whether Tisci\u2019s style will resonate among industry insiders and opinion makers, and if Burberry\u2019s management will be able to manage the pace of its new action plan. \u201cA star designer like Riccardo can have demanding requests about the new store format and the timing to deploy it,\u201d he added.\n\nFinancial analysts were tough on Gobbetti when he presented Burberry's third-quarter results in January 2018. Retail revenue was \u00a3719 million in the three months to December 31, 2017, down from \u00a3735 million in the same period in 2016. The company said retail revenue was up 1 percent on an underlying basis, while comparable store sales rose 2 percent, below analysts' expectations.\n\nComparable store sales grew by a mid-single figure percentage in Asia Pacific and mainland China, and by a low single digit in the Americas. However, they fell by a low single figure in its Europe division, hurt by a larger fall in the UK.\n\nTisci left his hometown of Taranto in southern Italy to study at Central Saint Martins in London, graduating in 1999. In September 2004, he set up an eponymous ready-to-wear label, showing his first collection in Milan for the Autumn/Winter 2005 season. The show caught the attention of Gobetti, who hired Tisci to replace Julien Macdonald as creative director of Givenchy in February 2005.\n\nBailey will step down from Burberry\u2019s board on March 31, 2018.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n[ Unpacking Burberry\u2019s New Strategy ]\n\n[ Burberry Plots Life After Bailey ]"}, {"url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/gallery/burberry-riccardo-tisci-collaborators-arca-mahmood-joan-smalls-irina-shayk-music-issue-2020", "page_content": "It\u2019s a good thing heads of state aren\u2019t the only ones who represent nations, and that music and fashion are powerful tools that can help shape national identities. When Riccardo Tisci took his post as creative director of Burberry, in 2018, two years after a hotly contested vote in which the United Kingdom chose to separate from the European Union, the Italian designer assumed responsibility for quite possibly the most iconic symbol of Britishness aside from the Queen herself. Today, the U.K.\u2014like the U.S.\u2014is mired in a righteous debate over what it means to be a citizen. Tisci, in his own way, has made an important contribution to that conversation.\n\nAnyone who has followed his career\u2014the die-hards remember him from Ruffo Research, the early-aughts design incubator, though most of us got to know him when he was appointed creative director of Givenchy, in 2005\u2014knows that it would have been out of the question for him to take Burberry back into the traditional old-Englishness from whence it first came. Instead, Tisci, who was a teenage goth and was raised with eight sisters, has invested his creative energy into claiming new social and stylistic territory for Burberry. He works the house\u2019s legacy codes adeptly, rehashing the trenchcoat six ways from Sunday, and shooting up tartans with unexpected colors and scales. A talented tailor, he\u2019s infused Burberry\u2019s considerable tranche of business clothes with edge and sensuality, and brought new urgency to his unique brand of elevated, funked-up streetwear.\n\nTisci has figured out how to bring Burberry to where people actually are, while simultaneously providing something for them to wear when they get to where they want to be. He is a designer who is invigorated by in-between spaces\u2014whether in gender identities, ethnicities, or walks of life. When we asked him to assemble a dream team of musicians and muses who represent the spirit of his vision for Burberry, we knew the result would be anything but timid. Almost all of the talent you see here comes from an immigrant background. Only a handful are even officially British, in the old-school sense of the word. If nations are ideas more than they are passports and borders, Tisci\u2019s Burberry Britain is a place that celebrates exuberance, power, diversity, and fierceness above all.\n\n1 MAHMOOD Burberry clothing and accessories (throughout).

Born Vanessa Lesnicki, Shay is a Belgian rapper of Congolese and Polish descent. Her first album, Jolie Garce, was released in 2016, and its lead single, PMW (which stands for \u201cPussy Money Weed\u201d), was a huge hit. Her second album, Antidote, was released last year; the video for its hit single, \u201cLiquide,\u201d has had more than 30 million views and counting on YouTube. \u201cI always thought high fashion was something that only spoke to elites. I\u2019m a rapper who came up in the Francophone world, and in Europe, the image of women rappers is really closed; we have a hard time being seen in the media. In France, I\u2019m literally the first woman from hip-hop to be included in the fashion conversation. I always wanted to bring a high aesthetic level to my work and make a bridge between street culture and fashion, and Riccardo was the first person in fashion to reach out to me.\u201d\n\n3 PA SALIEU Photographed by Campbell Addy.

I was sent to Gambia, where my family is from, for a few years when I was 2 because my grandmother\u2019s house burned down and my mother couldn\u2019t work in the U.K. anymore. In England there are different cultures everywhere. In the video for \u2018Frontline,\u2019 you see, like, 50 different nationalities represented.\u201d\n\n4 ARCA Fleur du Mal bra; Wolford tights.

I accompanied their playing with synth and electronics. Fashion can be a force for change\u2014it allows people to come together in fantasy.

We met at a party and have not stopped partying together since. I remember he made a little face when I walked in the door. I was like, \u2018What? What are you looking at?\u2019 And he just shook his head and started laughing. It was kind of like falling in love in a friendly way. I felt smitten, and I still feel that way after all this time. There\u2019s no bullshit with him. That night I was wearing a full Spanish look. For a year or two he thought I was Mexican, and I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him I\u2019m not!\u201d\n\n6 WILLIAM DJOKO Photographed by Campbell Addy. The Amsterdam-based DJ, who is of Ukrainian, Dutch, and Cameroonian origin, started his career in music as a singer\u2014he once fronted the house act Jason & the Argonauts. He spent his quarantine in the recording studio, building up material for his new label, Djoko. \u201cI first met Riccardo at Circoloco, the after-hours club in Ibiza, and over the years we kept connecting. We finally decided to work together last September on the soundtrack for his Spring/Summer 2020 show. He is such a visionary, very much connected to what\u2019s happening now. You can see it in city centers all over the world, people getting on the same page, even if in the countryside they aren\u2019t always so progressive. Riccardo has always had this urban, cosmopolitan perspective.\u201d\n\n7 YVES MATHIEU His own jewelry and watch. Photographed by Campbell Addy. A model and activist raised in Florida and now based in New York City, Mathieu spends his downtime volunteering in homeless and senior centers, and working on his singing career. \u201cWhen I was in elementary school, I was really into punk bands like Blink 182 and Green Day, and I\u2019d draw on my arms. There was this sticker machine in Walmart that sold fake tattoos for 50 cents. I\u2019d get as much change as I could and put all these stars and rainbows all over my neck. I got my first face tattoo when I was 16. Getting \u2018Self\u2019 and \u2018Love\u2019 on my eyelids hurt a lot, but now I love how I can be talking to someone and they catch a little glimpse. Looking the way I do, I\u2019m fully aware of stigma, and that there are spaces and conversations I\u2019m not allowed to be a part of. Riccardo facilitates representation. It\u2019s very, very hard to find people who are willing to use what they have to amplify the voices and vision of people who wouldn\u2019t necessarily get that chance on their own.\u201d\n\n8 IRINA SHAYK Photographed by Campbell Addy. The daughter of a coal miner and a kindergarten teacher, Shayk, who was born near the border between Russia and Kazakhstan, had a career working as a swimsuit model when Tisci cast her for Givenchy, in 2013. \u201cI remember so well when I went into that casting how Riccardo looked at me. He was smoking, and it was like I had known him for decades. The thing about Riccardo is, he loves different women\u2019s bodies and shapes, and he knows how to dress them all. He comes from a family with eight sisters, and he really loves women. That\u2019s special.\u201d\n\n9 M HUNCHO Photographed by Campbell Addy. He hails from northwest London, but raps from behind a custom-made mask he never removes in public, in a style heavily influenced by the sounds of the Maghreb. Huncholini the 1st, his most recent album, came out in January. \u201cMusic is something everyone can understand, no matter what language it\u2019s in. I used to just wear a balaclava, and then I felt like I was growing as an artist, so I wanted to turn it into something much more special. I went to see a guy who makes masks for the theater, like Phantom of the Opera. I said, \u2018This is my situation, bro. I\u2019m trying to be anonymous, but I\u2019m going for something creative.\u2019 \u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.gq.com/story/burberry-riccardo-tisci-debut", "page_content": "When it was announced earlier this year that Riccardo Tisci would be Burberry\u2019s new creative director, jokes about a new, \u201cgoth\u201d Burberry started pinging around Fashion Twitter. All this because the Italian designer spent the last 12 years remaking the label Givenchy in his own dark, moody image\u2014and, helpfully, reviving its fortunes along the way. A label once known for Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s was now known as one of the vanguards of the haute-streetwear movement. So the real question was: Could Tisci make lightning strike twice? And for a label with an entirely different ethos?\n\nTo raise the stakes even more, this was never sold as a mere designer changeover. After former chief creative officer Christopher Bailey left last year, Burberry CEO Marco Gobbetti was brought in to help the entire Burberry brand reposition itself as top-tier luxury powerhouse\u2014to be the kind of label that could compete to compete with French brands like Louis Vuitton and Hermes. That put a massive amount of pressure on Tisci. His job wasn't just to design a collection, but to help usher in a new era for the multi-billion dollar brand, and Britain\u2019s largest. As if to add to all that, Burberry started using the hashtag #NewEra to promote Tisci\u2019s debut.\n\nToday, in London, Tisci unveiled his complete vision for the label, following teases like a revived logo and some pricey graphic T-shirts. But instead of a throwing down of the gauntlet, today felt more like the laying down of a foundation, one on which the designer can build out a more expansive idea of what Burberry is today.\n\nModels on the catwalk during the Burberry London Fashion Week SS19 show held at The South London Mail Centre.

(Photo by Isabel Infantes/PA Images via Getty Images) Isabel Infantes - PA Images\n\nThe men\u2019s designs hewed to a smart two-prong approach, which allowed Tisci to appeal to two sorts of customer. His first round of menswear looks were heavy on tradition: tailoring was at its core (a nod, no doubt, to England\u2019s rich suiting history) layered under some impressive outerwear (Burberry\u2019s bread and butter) like paneled anoraks and bombers. Shown in a reserved palette of navy, black, gray and khaki (a nod to the brand's iconic trench coat, the looks were reserved and classic in the best possible sense, a clean, sharp, and familiar aesthetic to the Burberry fan.\n\nLater in the show (which featured more than 100 looks between men\u2019s and women\u2019s), he revealed a sort of second half of the collection, which played to Tisci\u2019s strengths. It had a distinctly streetwear vibe, with looser silhouettes, street style-worthy prints (cheetah prints, and signature Tisci graphics), a palette that included mint green and peach, and lots of workwear-meets-atheticwear pieces. This isn't necessarily for Burberry fans. Instead, this is the stuff that Tisci fans, of which there are many, will not only recognize, but will want to purchase.\n\nAnd Tisci, who has proven that he\u2019s able to intuit what people want many times before, knew that people would want the new Burberry right away. So he delivered: a \u201cdrop\u201d system has been implemented and pieces, like a mesh bomber with Burberry written across the back, are already available to purchase on Instagram."}]}
