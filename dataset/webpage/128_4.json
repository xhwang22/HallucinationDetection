A former police officer, he was elected in 2004 as a member of the UK Independence Party but later had the whip withdrawn when allegations of misuse of parliamentary expenses surfaced in The Sunday Telegraph. Following an inquiry carried out by the European Anti-Fraud Office, Wise was formally charged with false accounting and money laundering by Bedfordshire Police. After initially pleading not guilty, he admitted the charges and was sentenced in November 2009 at Southwark Crown Court to a two-year term of imprisonment. He is thought to be the first MEP to be jailed for expenses fraud. Sentencing him, the judge said that Wise had engaged in \"deliberate and blatant dishonesty\" and had set about to defraud the European Parliament almost as soon as he was elected.\n\nEarly career\n\nBorn in Bournemouth on 13 May 1948, Wise attended Bournemouth School between 1959 and 1965, before completing a Diploma in Public Speaking in 1967. He served with Dorset Police before embarking on a career in the food distribution and processing industry. He became the UK Managing Director of a German herbs and spices company. From 1981 to 1989 he was a member of the Liberal Party.\n\nPolitical career\n\nUKIP\n\nWise joined the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) in 1997. He served as office manager to Jeffrey Titford MEP, during this period he worked on the rules governing MEPs' expenses and gained an expertise in the system which he would later use to his advantage. He was the fourth-placed candidate on UKIP's candidate list in for the European Parliament elections in 1999, and also stood as the party's candidate in the 1997, 2001 and 2005 general elections for the South West Bedfordshire constituency. In the 2005 general election, he came fourth with 4.2% of the votes cast.\n\nHe was elected as an MEP for UKIP in the 2004 European elections. He was UKIP's official spokesman on the Culture, Youth, Media and Sport Committee until his suspension by the party in February 2007. In his first speech to the Committee on 4 October 2004, Wise criticised the proposed budget and drew allusions with Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. In his maiden speech to the Parliament on 16 December 2004, Wise blamed the European Union for creating unacceptable conditions for the transit of animals around Europe. Wise also spoke out against the Proposed directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions\n\nIndependent\n\nAfter losing the party whip in March 2007, Wise continued as an Independent within UKIP's Independence/Democracy parliamentary grouping pending the outcome of the fraud inquiry.\n\nDuring his time as an MEP, Wise disputed the genuine nature of the September 11th attacks. and labelled Russia-based businessman Alisher Usmanov a \"gangster and racketeer\"\n\nFollowing the decision to press criminal charges against him, Wise decided not to contest the 2009 European Parliament elections. He has however said that he wants to stand as an MP in the 2010 General Election.\n\nFraud conviction\n\nExposure\n\nOn 23 October 2005, a reporter for the Sunday Telegraph, Daniel Foggo, published an article accusing Wise of claiming \u00a336,000 a year from the European Parliament in the name of his researcher, Lindsay Jenkins, while only passing on about a sixth of that amount to her. According to now-repealed Rules governing the payment of expenses and allowances to Members of the European Parliament, MEPs could claim up to \u00a3125,000 per year for assistants' wages, but this money must be paid either directly to the employees or to a third-party agent. The rules did not allow the funds to pass directly through the hands of MEPs themselves.\n\nFoggo later reported that Wise had supplied the European Parliament's Payments Office with a \"contract\" including her name and details, which stipulated that the \u00a336,000 allowance should be paid into an account named \"Stags\". This account, held with the Co-operative Bank, was in fact Wise's own business account and its full name was \"T Wise trading as Stags\". The actual agreement between Wise and Jenkins stated that she would receive monthly \"retainer\" payments of \u00a3500 for advice and statistical research, with any extra work to be paid on top. Bank documents obtained by Foggo showed that between November 2004 and October 2005, Wise had paid \u00a339,100 to this account, out of which Jenkins received \u00a313,555. These funds were the only monies coming into the account. In another breach of the payment regulations, some of the \u00a313,555 paid to Jenkins represented work done on behalf of other UKIP members, including party leader Nigel Farage who had agreed to fund the publication of a eurosceptic pamphlet by Jenkins. A further \u00a319,000 was transferred from the account, some of which to pay off credit cards.\n\nOn 29 October, Wise admitted to breaching the rules and, to head off a scandal, agreed to repay \u00a325,230. An internal UKIP inquiry was launched after the Parliament became aware of the affair, but no action was taken and the results of the investigation were kept secret. As Daniel Foggo later reported, UKIP's former leader, Roger Knapman, halted the inquiry after it uncovered serious wrongdoing, believing that the European Parliament would clear Wise. Farage told reporter Daniel Foggo that Wise \"had committed a simple, silly error by making himself a \"paying agent\" for his own staff.\"\n\nSuspension from UKIP\n\nOn 23 February 2007, party sources at UKIP discovered that the European Parliament had passed the affair to OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office. A UKIP meeting was convened in Brussels on 28 February 2007 at which Wise formally admitted to having spent \u00a36,500 from the allowance on a dark green Peugeot 406 which he still drove, but refused to disclose how he had spent a further \u00a313,000 of the funds. After a heated discussion, a decision was taken to remove the whip; both Knapman and fellow MEP Mike Nattrass challenged the decision and threatened to reconsider their futures in the party. Farage emphasised that, if cleared by the OLAF investigation, Wise would be welcomed back into the party, adding that he thought \"there is a great deal of public sympathy for us.\" Wise was however suspended by the party.\n\nFollowing his suspension, Wise spent a further \u00a38,000 of the allowance in legal fees in contemplation of a libel case against Greg Lance-Watkins who had published claims on the Internet relating to Wise's activities. No action was ultimately brought against Lance-Watkins.\n\nNews of the World sting\n\nIn May 2008, the News of the World published details of a sting involving Tom Wise. A female reporter posing as a work experience student recorded Wise brazenly admitting in a Belgian bar that he had little idea of what his job as a Member of the European Parliament entailed, adding \"I don't know what an MEP's job is. No one's ever given me a job description. I've no idea what an MEP should or shouldn't do. So you make it up as you go along.\" He boasted of fiddling the Parliament's expenses system, stating \"Yes, I am milking the system [...] I have a simple philosophy. You and your parents are paying for me. Sorry, tough!\" The newspaper used its leading article to call for a change in the rules governing MEPs' expenses following the expos\u00e9.\n\nArrest and charges\n\nOn 20 June 2008, Wise was arrested by Bedfordshire Police's Economic Crime Unit on suspicion of making a false instrument, obtaining money by deception by transfer and converting criminal property. He was bailed until 29 October. Bedfordshire Police made the arrest after having been contacted by OLAF.\n\nOn 20 April 2009 the Crown Prosecution Service advised Bedfordshire Police to charge both Wise and Jenkins with one count each of false accounting contrary to the Theft Act 1968 and one count each of money laundering contrary to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Both were scheduled to appear before the City of Westminster Magistrates' Court on in April 2009 to face the charges. Wise indicated that he was innocent and would fight the charges which carry a maximum 14-year jail term. He is thought to be the first MEP to face criminal charges over the misuse of parliamentary funds, and the second former UKIP MEP after Ashley Mote to have faced criminal charges during a parliamentary session.\n\nTrial and conviction\n\nWise appeared in court on 27 April 2009 and spoke only to confirm his name and plead not guilty. Jenkins also denied the charges. District Judge Daphne Wickham released both on conditional bail until 8 June. The case was transferred to Southwark Crown Court and charges specified: that Wise and Jenkins \"falsified a document, namely a contract for provision of services, an application for secretarial assistance allowance and invoices\". Also, that they used funds \"received from the European Parliament intended for use as payments for secretarial services.\"\n\nThe three-week trial began on 2 November 2009. Judge Geoffrey Rivlin QC heard the prosecution argue that Wise channelled parliamentary funds into an account he secretly controlled so that he could pay credit card debts and buy fine wines. He made separate payments of \u00a32,228 and \u00a31,260 to wine importers, and maintained the deception by asking Jenkins to sign blank documents which he completed later. But for his exposure, Wise would, according to prosecutors, have claimed up to \u00a3180,000.\n\nOn the third day of the trial, just before Nigel Farage was due to give evidence against him, Wise began several hours of negotiations with his legal team after which he changed his plea to guilty and said he was entirely to blame for the fraud. This resulted in Jenkins being acquitted. He was sentenced on 10 November 2009 to two years imprisonment, the sentence having been reduced by one year on account of his guilty plea. In sentencing him, Judge Geoffrey Rivlin declared that:\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that you had hardly got your feet beneath your desk as an MEP before you were planning to defraud the parliament to which you were elected and the people you were elected to serve. This was very deliberate and blatant dishonesty. You did not fall into this offence as a result of some unfortunate combination of unforeseen circumstances which happened to suddenly present you with temptation. You knew the system of expenses inside out and this was a claim you devised and planned with some care.\n\nThe judge added that, in addition to jail, Wise would also have to pay \u00a330,000 towards the prosecution's costs.\n\nPersonal life\n\nWise is married to Janet and, until his imprisonment, lived in Linslade near Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire. He has two grown-up children.\n\nWise has a developed interest in wines, having followed courses arranged by the Wine & Spirit Education Trust and has reached \"the level just below Master of Wine\". He has spoken of having a wine cellar containing 1,000 bottles of wine."}, {"url": "https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/8020398", "page_content": "Infobox MEP\n\nhonorific-prefix =\n\nname = Tom Wise\n\nhonorific-suffix =\n\nparliament = European\n\nconstituency_MP = East of England\n\nterm_start = June 2004\n\nterm_end =\n\nmajority =\n\npredecessor =\n\nsuccessor =\n\nbirth_date =\n\nbirth_place =\n\ndeath_date =\n\ndeath_place =\n\nnationality =\n\nspouse =\n\nrelations =\n\nchildren =\n\nresidence =\n\nalma_mater =\n\noccupation =\n\nprofession =\n\nreligion =\n\n\n\n\n\nwebsite = [ http://www.tomwisemep.co.uk/ tomwisemep.co.uk ]\n\nfootnotes =\n\nTom Wise is a Member of the European Parliament for the East of England for the United Kingdom Independence Party .

In those circumstances we do not invite a trial against Mrs Jenkins and invite verdicts of not guilty against her.\"\n\nJudge Geoffrey Rivlin QC agreed, and formally ordered her acquittal on both counts, adding that her defence costs should be paid out of public funds.\n\nAfter quashing an outstanding money-laundering allegation against Wise, he told the former MEP he would be sentenced next Wednesday.\n\nHe said he could remain on bail in the meantime, but warned: \"It must, however, be fully understood that in terms of the ultimate sentence, nothing must be read into that.\"\n\nThe judge then added: \"I see Mr Wise nodding because he knows too well what the situation is.\"\n\nUkip's chairman, Paul Nuttall, said: \"Tom Wise broke faith with the UK Independence party, which is why the whip was withdrawn.

He was the son of Henry Wise and his first wife Mary Trollopp, who were married at St Aldate's Church on 29 April 1697. For more details about his parents and siblings, see the biography of his father, who was himself three times Mayor of Oxford.\n\nIn January 1722/3 when he was aged 16, Thomas was apprenticed as a mercer to his father.\n\nLeft: Portrait of Alderman Thomas Wise (wrongly dated 1738: perhaps 1758?),\n\nwhich hangs in the Council Chamber of the Town Hall\n\nIn September 1738 Thomas Wise (31) was chosen Mayor\u2019s Child by the new Mayor, William Ives\n\nOn 3 September 1738 Wise was admitted free, and he later had his own mercer\u2019s shop in Cornmarket.\n\nIn 1739 he was appointed a cloth-searcher; and in September 1741 he was elected Senior Bailiff.\n\nThomas's father Henry Wise died on 9 October 1741.\n\nAt some point Thomas Wise married a woman called Deborah, but the marriage has not been found. They do not appear to have had any children.\n\nIn July 1746 Wise was chosen as one of the eight Assistants, and in September that year he was elected Mayor of Oxford (for 1746/7), selecting John Phillips as his Child and William Cherry as his Chamberlain.\n\nOn 3 October 1755 Wise was elected an Alderman.\n\nBy 1758 Wise had moved from his Cornmarket shop: Jackson\u2019s Oxford Journal reports that a Mrs Fowler had moved into his house in Cornmarket that year, and in 1760 that Henry Smith, mercer (former apprentice of John Austin, another Mayor) had opened at the shop in Cornmarket that was formerly kept by Alderman Wise.\n\nOn 20 September 1762 Thomas Wise was elected Mayor again, but refused to accept the office, paying the City Treasurer \u00a350 as a fine for not serving.\n\nIn 1766 the City got into such debt that the council tried to sell its two parliamentary seats. As a result, the Mayor and ten councillors (including Alderman Wise) were committed to Newgate Prison in London for four days; they were discharged with a reprimand from the Speaker of the House of Commons on 10 February 1768.\n\nWise\u2019s widowed sister, Mrs Elizabeth Lowe of Headington Hill, died on 2 October 1766.\n\nIn 1771, Thomas Wise was again chosen Mayor, but again refused, paying another fine of \u00a350.\n\nBy 1772 Thomas Wise was living in a house in New Inn Hall Street. In that year a survey of every house in the city was taken in consequence of the Mileways Act of 1771, and according to H. E. Salter, the house of Alderman Wise, which had a frontage of 43 yards, 0 ft. and 10 in., occpied the site of the present 42, 44, 46, 48, and 50 New Inn Hall Street; and he also had a \u201cgarden, &c\u201d on the site of 21 New Inn Hall Street, with a frontage of 12 yards, 2 ft. and 6 in.\n\nThomas Wise died in August 1772 at the age of 65.

Bush ran for reelection against Democratic candidate Senator John Kerry (MA) and won. The campaign hinged on the candidates\u2019 performance in battleground states where the race was close. Terrorism and the war in Iraq were key campaign issues.\n\nThe Nominating Campaign\n\nIn 2003, Governor Howard Dean (VT) was the Democratic presidential candidate most vociferously opposing the Iraq War. His stance and forceful rhetoric gave his campaign unprecedented success in obtaining funds and volunteers through the web (Teachout & Streeter, 2008). This accomplishment surprised the news media, generated reams of favorable coverage for him, helped him to raise funds, and transformed him from a marginal candidate to the front runner\u2014all before a single vote was cast. But in the Iowa caucus, Governor Dean came in third behind Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina. That night, shouting over the din of his supporters, he committed to continuing his campaign and then let out a loud scream. The networks and cable news replayed the visual and shout, now described as \u201cthe scream heard around the political world,\u201d hundreds of times, but without the loud audience noise over which he was attempting to be heard. He seemed a bit unbalanced and certainly not presidential. Parodies of \u201cthe scream\u201d proliferated online.\n\nVideo Clip Howard Dean\u2019s Scream (click to see video) The media endlessly replayed Democrat Howard Dean\u2019s scream after the Iowa caucuses in 2004.\n\nAfter the Iowa caucuses the news media reported that Senator Kerry was likely to be nominated. Dean received less coverage than before, most of it negative. His support shrank by 50 percent in the polls, while Kerry\u2019s popularity in the polls grew. Kerry won New Hampshire and other primaries, locking up the nomination on Super Tuesday, March 2.\n\nThe theme of the Democratic convention and John Kerry\u2019s acceptance speech centered on Kerry\u2019s status as a Vietnam war hero with the strength and determination to be president, commander in chief, and to wage the war on terrorism. Missing from the convention were a vision and program for the future of the country. There were few attacks on President George W. Bush or his record. For these reasons, Kerry did not experience much of a postconvention bounce.\n\nThe Republicans renominated the incumbents, President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, who were unchallenged in their party\u2019s caucuses and primaries. Their convention was held in New York City around the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and within staging distance of the ground zero site. The convention portrayed President Bush as a strong and decisive leader. Convention speakers attacked Kerry as weak, a waffler, and unqualified to be president. In his acceptance speech, President Bush laid out programs and policies he would pursue if reelected, which included security and defense in order to ensure that America \u201cis safer.\u201d In polls, his postconvention bounce ranged from 4 to 11 percent.\n\nThe Iraq War was an issue that posed problems for both candidates. For Bush, it was the continued insurgency against the US occupation and the failure to find weapons of mass destruction. He tried to finesse this by equating the war in Iraq with the war on terrorism. Kerry offered few alternatives to existing policy.

A former police officer, he was elected in 2004 as a member of the UK Independence Party but later had the whip withdrawn when allegations of misuse of parliamentary expenses surfaced in The Sunday Telegraph. Following an inquiry carried out by the European Anti-Fraud Office, Wise was formally charged with false accounting and money laundering by Bedfordshire Police. After initially pleading not guilty, he admitted the charges and was sentenced in November 2009 at Southwark Crown Court to a two-year term of imprisonment. He is thought to be the first MEP to be jailed for expenses fraud. Sentencing him, the judge said that Wise had engaged in \"deliberate and blatant dishonesty\" and had set about to defraud the European Parliament almost as soon as he was elected.\n\nEarly career\n\nBorn in Bournemouth, Wise attended Bournemouth School between 1959 and 1965, before completing a Diploma in Public Speaking in 1967. He served with Dorset Police before embarking on a career in the food distribution and processing industry. He became the UK Managing Director of a German herbs and spices company. From 1981 to 1989 he was a member of the Liberal Party.\n\nUKIP\n\nWise joined the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) in 1997. He served as office manager to Jeffrey Titford MEP, during this period he worked on the rules governing MEPs' expenses and gained an expertise in the system which he would later use to his advantage. He was the fourth-placed candidate on UKIP's candidate list in for the European Parliament elections in 1999, and also stood as the party's candidate in the 1997, 2001 and 2005 general elections for the South West Bedfordshire constituency. In the 2005 general election, he came fourth with 4.2% of the votes cast.\n\nHe was elected as an MEP for UKIP in the 2004 European elections. He was UKIP's official spokesman on the Culture, Youth, Media and Sport Committee until his suspension by the party in February 2007. In his first speech to the Committee on 4 October 2004, Wise criticised the proposed budget and drew allusions with Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. In his maiden speech to the Parliament on 16 December 2004, Wise blamed the European Union for creating unacceptable conditions for the transit of animals around Europe. Wise also spoke out against the Proposed directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions\n\nIndependent\n\nAfter losing the party whip in March 2007, Wise continued as an Independent within UKIP's Independence/Democracy parliamentary grouping pending the outcome of the fraud inquiry.\n\nDuring his time as an MEP, Wise disputed the genuine nature of the September 11th attacks. and labelled Russia-based businessman Alisher Usmanov, who is a shareholder of Arsenal F.C. a \"gangster and racketeer\"\n\nFollowing the decision to press criminal charges against him, Wise decided not to contest the 2009 European Parliament elections. He has however said that he wants to stand as an MP in the 2010 General Election.\n\nExposure\n\nOn 23 October 2005, a reporter for the Sunday Telegraph, Daniel Foggo, published an article accusing Wise of claiming \u00a336,000 a year from the European Parliament in the name of his researcher, Lindsay Jenkins, while only passing on about a sixth of that amount to her. According to now-repealed Rules governing the payment of expenses and allowances to Members of the European Parliament, MEPs could claim up to \u00a3125,000 per year for assistants' wages, but this money must be paid either directly to the employees or to a third-party agent. The rules did not allow the funds to pass directly through the hands of MEPs themselves.\n\nFoggo later reported that Wise had supplied the European Parliament's Payments Office with a \"contract\" including her name and details, which stipulated that the \u00a336,000 allowance should be paid into an account named \"Stags\". This account, held with the Co-operative Bank, was in fact Wise's own business account and its full name was \"T Wise trading as Stags\". The actual agreement between Wise and Jenkins stated that she would receive monthly \"retainer\" payments of \u00a3500 for advice and statistical research, with any extra work to be paid on top. Bank documents obtained by Foggo showed that between November 2004 and October 2005, Wise had paid \u00a339,100 to this account, out of which Jenkins received \u00a313,555. These funds were the only monies coming into the account. In another breach of the payment regulations, some of the \u00a313,555 paid to Jenkins represented work done on behalf of other UKIP members, including party leader Nigel Farage who had agreed to fund the publication of a eurosceptic pamphlet by Jenkins. A further \u00a319,000 was transferred from the account, some of which to pay off credit cards.\n\nOn 29 October, Wise admitted to breaching the rules and, to head off a scandal, agreed to repay \u00a325,230. An internal UKIP inquiry was launched after the Parliament became aware of the affair, but no action was taken and the results of the investigation were kept secret. As Daniel Foggo later reported, UKIP's former leader, Roger Knapman, halted the inquiry after it uncovered serious wrongdoing, believing that the European Parliament would clear Wise. Farage told reporter Daniel Foggo that Wise \"had committed a simple, silly error by making himself a \"paying agent\" for his own staff.\"\n\nSuspension from UKIP\n\nOn 23 February 2007, party sources at UKIP discovered that the European Parliament had passed the affair to OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office. A UKIP meeting was convened in Brussels on 28 February 2007 at which Wise formally admitted to having spent \u00a36,500 from the allowance on a dark green Peugeot 406 which he still drove, but refused to disclose how he had spent a further \u00a313,000 of the funds. After a heated discussion, a decision was taken to remove the whip; both Knapman and fellow MEP Mike Nattrass challenged the decision and threatened to reconsider their futures in the party. Farage emphasised that, if cleared by the OLAF investigation, Wise would be welcomed back into the party, adding that he thought \"there is a great deal of public sympathy for us.\" Wise was however suspended by the party.\n\nFollowing his suspension, Wise spent a further \u00a38,000 of the allowance in legal fees in contemplation of a libel case against Greg Lance-Watkins who had published claims on the Internet relating to Wise's activities. No action was ultimately brought against Lance-Watkins.\n\nNews of the World sting\n\nIn May 2008, the News of the World published details of a sting involving Tom Wise. A female reporter posing as a work experience student recorded Wise brazenly admitting in a Belgian bar that he had little idea of what his job as a Member of the European Parliament entailed, adding \"I don't know what an MEP's job is. No one's ever given me a job description. I've no idea what an MEP should or shouldn't do. So you make it up as you go along.\" He boasted of fiddling the Parliament's expenses system, stating \"Yes, I am milking the system [...] I have a simple philosophy. You and your parents are paying for me. Sorry, tough!\" The newspaper used its leading article to call for a change in the rules governing MEPs' expenses following the expos\u00e9.\n\nArrest and charges\n\nOn 20 June 2008, Wise was arrested by Bedfordshire Police's Economic Crime Unit on suspicion of making a false instrument, obtaining money by deception by transfer and converting criminal property. He was bailed until 29 October. Bedfordshire Police made the arrest after having been contacted by OLAF.\n\nOn 20 April 2009 the Crown Prosecution Service advised Bedfordshire Police to charge both Wise and Jenkins with one count each of false accounting contrary to the Theft Act 1968 and one count each of money laundering contrary to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Both were scheduled to appear before the City of Westminster Magistrates' Court on in April 2009 to face the charges. Wise indicated that he was innocent and would fight the charges which carry a maximum 14-year jail term. He is thought to be the first MEP to face criminal charges over the misuse of parliamentary funds, and the second former UKIP MEP after Ashley Mote to have faced criminal charges during a parliamentary session.\n\nTrial and conviction\n\nWise appeared in court on 27 April 2009 and spoke only to confirm his name and plead not guilty. Jenkins also denied the charges. District Judge Daphne Wickham released both on conditional bail until 8 June. The case was transferred to Southwark Crown Court and charges specified: that Wise and Jenkins \"falsified a document, namely a contract for provision of services, an application for secretarial assistance allowance and invoices\". Also, that they used funds \"received from the European Parliament intended for use as payments for secretarial services.\"\n\nThe three-week trial began on 2 November 2009. Judge Geoffrey Rivlin QC heard the prosecution argue that Wise channelled parliamentary funds into an account he secretly controlled so that he could pay credit card debts and buy fine wines. He made separate payments of \u00a32,228 and \u00a31,260 to wine importers, and maintained the deception by asking Jenkins to sign blank documents which he completed later. But for his exposure, Wise would, according to prosecutors, have claimed up to \u00a3180,000.\n\nOn the third day of the trial, just before Nigel Farage was due to give evidence against him, Wise began several hours of negotiations with his legal team after which he changed his plea to guilty and said he was entirely to blame for the fraud. This resulted in Jenkins being acquitted. He was sentenced on 10 November 2009 to two years imprisonment, the sentence having been reduced by one year on account of his guilty plea. In sentencing him, Judge Geoffrey Rivlin declared that:\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that you had hardly got your feet beneath your desk as an MEP before you were planning to defraud the parliament to which you were elected and the people you were elected to serve. This was very deliberate and blatant dishonesty. You did not fall into this offence as a result of some unfortunate combination of unforeseen circumstances which happened to suddenly present you with temptation. You knew the system of expenses inside out and this was a claim you devised and planned with some care.\n\nThe judge added that, in addition to jail, Wise would also have to pay \u00a330,000 towards the prosecution's costs.\n\nPersonal life\n\nWise is married to Janet and, until his imprisonment, lived in Linslade near Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire. He has two grown-up children.\n\nWise has a developed interest in wines, having followed courses arranged by the Wine & Spirit Education Trust and has reached \"the level just below Master of Wine\". He has spoken of having a wine cellar containing 1,000 bottles of wine."}, {"url": "https://www.alreporter.com/2023/01/16/supreme-court-welcomes-justice-greg-cook-and-re-elected-justice-kelli-wise/", "page_content": "The Supreme Court of Alabama held an Investiture and Oath of Office ceremony Friday to welcome newly-elected Justice Gregory C. \u201cGreg\u201d Cook and re-elected Justice A.

These funds were the only monies coming into the account. In another breach of the payment regulations, some of the \u00a313,555 paid to Jenkins represented work done on behalf of other UKIP members, including party leader Nigel Farage who had agreed to fund the publication of a eurosceptic pamphlet by Jenkins. A further \u00a319,000 was transferred from the account, some of which to pay off credit cards.\n\nOn 29 October, Wise admitted to breaching the rules and, to head off a scandal, agreed to repay \u00a325,230. An internal UKIP inquiry was launched after the Parliament became aware of the affair, but no action was taken and the results of the investigation were kept secret. As Daniel Foggo later reported, UKIP's former leader, Roger Knapman, halted the inquiry after it uncovered serious wrongdoing, believing that the European Parliament would clear Wise. Farage told reporter Daniel Foggo that Wise \"had committed a simple, silly error by making himself a \"paying agent\" for his own staff.\"\n\nSuspension from UKIP\n\nOn 23 February 2007, party sources at UKIP discovered that the European Parliament had passed the affair to OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office. A UKIP meeting was convened in Brussels on 28 February 2007 at which Wise formally admitted to having spent \u00a36,500 from the allowance on a dark green Peugeot 406 which he still drove, but refused to disclose how he had spent a further \u00a313,000 of the funds. After a heated discussion, a decision was taken to remove the whip; both Knapman and fellow MEP Mike Nattrass challenged the decision and threatened to reconsider their futures in the party. Farage emphasised that, if cleared by the OLAF investigation, Wise would be welcomed back into the party, adding that he thought \"there is a great deal of public sympathy for us.\" Wise was however suspended by the party.\n\nFollowing his suspension, Wise spent a further \u00a38,000 of the allowance in legal fees in contemplation of a libel case against Greg Lance-Watkins who had published claims on the Internet relating to Wise's activities. No action was ultimately brought against Lance-Watkins.\n\nNews of the World sting\n\nIn May 2008, the News of the World published details of a sting involving Tom Wise. A female reporter posing as a work experience student recorded Wise brazenly admitting in a Belgian bar that he had little idea of what his job as a Member of the European Parliament entailed, adding \"I don't know what an MEP's job is. No one's ever given me a job description. I've no idea what an MEP should or shouldn't do. So you make it up as you go along.\" He boasted of fiddling the Parliament's expenses system, stating \"Yes, I am milking the system [...] I have a simple philosophy. You and your parents are paying for me. Sorry, tough!\" The newspaper used its leading article to call for a change in the rules governing MEPs' expenses following the expos\u00e9.\n\nArrest and charges\n\nOn 20 June 2008, Wise was arrested by Bedfordshire Police's Economic Crime Unit on suspicion of making a false instrument, obtaining money by deception by transfer and converting criminal property. He was bailed until 29 October. Bedfordshire Police made the arrest after having been contacted by OLAF.\n\nOn 20 April 2009 the Crown Prosecution Service advised Bedfordshire Police to charge both Wise and Jenkins with one count each of false accounting contrary to the Theft Act 1968 and one count each of money laundering contrary to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Both were scheduled to appear before the City of Westminster Magistrates' Court on in April 2009 to face the charges. Wise indicated that he was innocent and would fight the charges which carry a maximum 14-year jail term. He is thought to be the first MEP to face criminal charges over the misuse of parliamentary funds, and the second former UKIP MEP after Ashley Mote to have faced criminal charges during a parliamentary session.\n\nTrial and conviction\n\nWise appeared in court on 27 April 2009 and spoke only to confirm his name and plead not guilty. Jenkins also denied the charges. District Judge Daphne Wickham released both on conditional bail until 8 June. The case was transferred to Southwark Crown Court and charges specified: that Wise and Jenkins \"falsified a document, namely a contract for provision of services, an application for secretarial assistance allowance and invoices\". Also, that they used funds \"received from the European Parliament intended for use as payments for secretarial services.\"\n\nThe three-week trial began on 2 November 2009. Judge Geoffrey Rivlin QC heard the prosecution argue that Wise channelled parliamentary funds into an account he secretly controlled so that he could pay credit card debts and buy fine wines. He made separate payments of \u00a32,228 and \u00a31,260 to wine importers, and maintained the deception by asking Jenkins to sign blank documents which he completed later. But for his exposure, Wise would, according to prosecutors, have claimed up to \u00a3180,000.\n\nOn the third day of the trial, just before Nigel Farage was due to give evidence against him, Wise began several hours of negotiations with his legal team after which he changed his plea to guilty and said he was entirely to blame for the fraud. This resulted in Jenkins being acquitted. He was sentenced on 10 November 2009 to two years imprisonment, the sentence having been reduced by one year on account of his guilty plea. In sentencing him, Judge Geoffrey Rivlin declared that:\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that you had hardly got your feet beneath your desk as an MEP before you were planning to defraud the parliament to which you were elected and the people you were elected to serve. This was very deliberate and blatant dishonesty. You did not fall into this offence as a result of some unfortunate combination of unforeseen circumstances which happened to suddenly present you with temptation. You knew the system of expenses inside out and this was a claim you devised and planned with some care.\n\nThe judge added that, in addition to jail, Wise would also have to pay \u00a330,000 towards the prosecution's costs.\n\nPersonal life\n\nWise is married to Janet and, until his imprisonment, lived in Linslade near Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire. He has two grown-up children.\n\nWise has a developed interest in wines, having followed courses arranged by the Wine & Spirit Education Trust and has reached \"the level just below Master of Wine\". He has spoken of having a wine cellar containing 1,000 bottles of wine."}]}
