The expansion Lakers who already had a solid roster with forward Jim Pollard and playmaker Herm Schaefer added Center George Mikan, who quickly became the most dominant player in the sport. With Mikan leading the way, the first-year Lakers Coached by John Kundla easily won their division by 13 games with a 43-17 record. In the playoffs, the Lakers continued to roll beating the Oshkosh All-Stars 3 games to 1. The Lakers would go to sweep the Tri-cities Blackhawks in 2 straight to reach the Finals. In the finals, the Lakers continued their dominance beating the Rochester Royals 3 games to 1. Following the season, the Lakers would move to the BAA as the two rival leagues began a merger that would form the NBA.\n\n1948/49: The Lakers move to the BAA was a success as they finished in 2nd place in the Western Division with a 44-16 record, as George Mikan led the league with 28.3 ppg. In the playoffs, the Lakers continued their dominance sweeping the Chicago Stags and Rochester Royals in consecutive two-game series to make the Finals. In the Finals, the Lakers would jump out to a 3-0 lead before beating the Washington in Capitols to win the BAA Championship.\n\n1949/50: With the NBL\u2019s last teams joining the BAA, the league changes its name to the more familiar NBA, and the Lakers continued to roll, finishing tied for 1st place in the Central Division with a 51-17 record. Once again, the Lakers breezed through the playoffs sweeping the Chicago Stags, Fort Wayne Pistons, and Anderson Packers in 2 games series. In the first-ever NBA Finals, the Lakers would win their 3rd straight Championship by beating the Syracuse Nationals in 6 games.\n\n1950/51: With the NBA reducing to 11 teams, the Lakers continued to dominate winning the Western Division with a 44-24 record. In the playoffs, the Lakers need a full three games to squeeze past the Indianapolis Olympians in the first round. In the Western Finals, the Lakers took Game 1 but had their reign ended when the Rochester Royals came back to win the next three games.\n\n1951/52: The NBA widened the foul lane before the season in an attempt to slow George Mikan, but the rule change had a minimal effect, as he still averaged 23.ppg, finishing 2nd in scoring. The Lakers would also finish in 2nd with a 40-26 record. In the playoffs, the Lakers would beat the Indianapolis Olympians in 2 straight to earn a rematch with Rochester Royals. In a reversal of last year, the Lakers lost Game 1 before coming back to win the next 3 to reach their 4th final in 5 years. In the Finals, the Lakers and New York Knickerbockers would alternate wins with the Lakers emerging victorious in 7 games.\n\n1952/53: The Lakers continued to be the dominant force in the league as they win the Western Division with a 48-22 record. In the playoffs, the Lakers would sweep the Indianapolis Olympians in 2 straight. Moving on to the Western Finals, the Lakers would take their first two at home but were pushed to a 5th game when the Pistons won two straight games in Fort Wayne. The series returned to Minneapolis, where the Lakers won the decisive 5th game 74-58. In the Finals, the Lakers dropped Game 1 but won the nest 4 to beat the New York Knickerbockers for their 2nd straight Championship.\n\n1953/54: Bad knees began to take a toll on Center George Mikan as he scored only 18.1 ppg. However, the Lakers signed a promising rookie named Clyde Lovellette, who was more than capable of spelling Mikan, as the Lakers won the Western Division with a 46-26 record. In a first-round, robin the Lakers won 3 straight to face the Rochester Royals in the Western Finals. The Lakers would go on to beat the Royals in a three-game series. In the finals, the Lakers and Syracuse Nationals alternate wins, with Lakers emerging with their 3rd straight title with an 87-80 win in Game 7. Following the season, Mikan would announce his retirement.\n\n1954/55: The NBA instituted two revolutionary rule changes; the 24-second shot clock was introduced, as was a limit of 6 team fouls per quarter. The new rules accomplished two things: they helped quicken the pace of the action on the court, and they took away the tactical advantage of fouling a player who has possession of the ball late in a game. Despite the rule changes, the Lakers still make the playoffs with a 40-32 record. In the first round, the Lakers would beat the Rochester Royals in 3 games to advance to the Western Finals. However, in the finals, the Lakers would fall to the Fort Wayne Pistons 3 games to 1.\n\n1955/56: With Jim Pollard retiring, the Lakers were just a shell of themselves, as they struggled all season. In the middle of the season, the desperate Lakers even asked George Mikan to come out of retirement. Despite the struggle, the Lakers still sneak into the playoffs despite a 33-39 record. In the playoffs, the Lakers would be bounced in the first round losing a three-game series to the St. Louis Hawks.\n\n19556/57: Despite a 34-38 record, the Lakers managed to finish in a tie for the Division Title, but after losing a one-game playoff lost home court and their first-round bye. The Lakers would recover to beat Fort Wayne Piston in 2 straight, but in the Western Finals, they would be swept in 3 straight by the St. Louis Hawks.\n\n1957/58: George Mikan assumes the coaching duties as the Lakers endure a terrible season finishing in last place with a league-worst 19-53 record. Mikan would not even last the year as he quit midway through the season as John Kundla reassumed the coaching duties.\n\n1958/59: The Lakers fortunes would quickly turn as they drafted Forward Elgin Baylor with the top draft pick. Baylor would dominate the NBA in his 1st season, winning the Rookie of the Year with 24.9 ppg. Led by Baylor, the Lakers would finish in 2nd place with a 33-39 record. In the playoffs, the Lakers would beat the Detroit Pistons in 3 games to reach the Western Finals, where they would stun St. Louis Hawks in 6 games. However, in the Finals, the Lakers would be swept in their first playoff series against the Boston Celtics.\n\n1959/60: After an 11-25 start, new Coach John Castellani is fired, and replaced by Jim Pollard. Under Pollard, the Lakers still struggled to make the playoffs despite a 25-50 record. Despite the team\u2019s struggles, Elgin Baylor would shine posting 29.6 ppg good for 3rd in the NBA. In the playoffs, the Lakers would suddenly put it together, beating the Detroit Pistons in 2 straight and holding a 3-2 series lead over the St. Louis Hawks. However, the Hawks would rally to win the next two games to end the Lakers Championship dreams. Following the season, the Lakers who had seen attendance dip since George Mikan\u2019s retirement decided to move to Los Angeles, becoming the NBA\u2019s first West Coast franchise. The NBA would not return to Minnesota for another 30 years while the Lakers became one of professional sports\u2019 most successful franchises in Los Angeles."}, {"url": "https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/birth-cities/42/St-Louis-MO-United-States", "page_content": "League: All NBA NCAA G League International AAU National High School\n\nCountry: Afghanistan Albania Algeria Andorra Angola Antigua and Barbuda Argentina Armenia Aruba Australia Austria Azerbaijan Bahamas Bahrain Barbados Belarus Belgium Belize Benin Bolivia Bosnia and Herzegovina Botswana Brazil British Virgin Islands Bulgaria Burkina Faso Burundi Cameroon Canada Cape Verde Central African Republic Chad Chile China Colombia Comoros Costa Rica Croatia Cuba Cyprus Czech Republic Democratic Republic of the Congo Denmark Dominica Dominican Republic Ecuador Egypt El Salvador England Equatorial Guinea Eritrea Estonia Ethiopia Fiji Finland France French Polynesia Gabon Gambia Georgia Germany Ghana Gibraltar Greece Grenada Guatemala Guinea Guinea-Bissau Guyana Haiti Honduras Hong Kong Hungary Iceland India Indonesia Iran Iraq Ireland Israel Italy Ivory Coast Jamaica Japan Jordan Kazakhstan Kenya Kosovo Kuwait Kyrgyzstan Latvia Lebanon Liberia Libya Lithuania Luxembourg Madagascar Malawi Malaysia Mali Malta Mauritius Mexico Moldova Monaco Mongolia Montenegro Morocco Mozambique Namibia Netherlands New Zealand Nicaragua Niger Nigeria North Macedonia Northern Ireland Norway Pakistan Palestine Panama Papua New Guinea Paraguay Peru Philippines Poland Portugal Puerto Rico Qatar Republic of Suriname Republic of the Congo Romania Russia Rwanda Saint Kitts and Nevis Saint Lucia Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Samoa San Marino Saudi Arabia Scotland Senegal Serbia Seychelles Sierra Leone Singapore Slovakia Slovenia Somalia South Africa South Korea South Sudan Spain Sri Lanka St. Martin Swaziland Sweden Switzerland Syria Taiwan Tajikistan Tanzania Thailand The Gambia Togo Trinidad and Tobago Tunisia Turkey Turkmenistan Turks and Caicos Islands Uganda Ukraine United Arab Emirates United States Uruguay Uzbekistan Venezuela Wales Zambia Zimbabwe\n\nState: Alabama Alaska American Samoa Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware District of Columbia Florida Georgia Guam Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Puerto Rico Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas U.S. Virgin Islands Utah Vermont Virginia Washington West Virginia Wisconsin Wyoming"}, {"url": "https://www.stltoday.com/sports/other/the-day-the-hawks-made-their-st-louis-debut-and-an-nba-legend-emerged/article_04ee3304-1f6a-11eb-9bcd-53d371eb3b20.html", "page_content": "St. Louis has lost major league teams before. After the 1953 season, the American League Browns departed for Baltimore. For those who loved little pinch-hitters (Eddie Gaedel), promotions like \u201cGrandstand Manager's Day\u201d and the \"Streetcar Series\" of 1944, it was tough to swallow.\n\nAfter the 1987 season, the NFL St. Louis Cardinals split for Phoenix. For those who watched Hall of Famers like Larry Wilson, Dan Dierdorf, Roger Wehrli and Jackie Smith, who lived and died with Don Coryell's \u201cCardiac Cards,\u201d it was sad. The Rams moved here from Los Angeles and filled the NFL void from 1995-2015, when Stan Kroenke moved the team back to LA, spitting upon St. Louis on his way out.\n\nAnd after just one season (1934-35), the NHL St. Louis Eagles disappeared - who can forget Fido Purpur and Syd Howe?\n\nBut those departures have a postscript. The Browns are a memory, but major league baseball remained and has flourished with the National League Cardinals. The Eagles were short-lived, but the NHL Blues have been back since 1967-68. The Football Cardinals never hosted a playoff game here, but they were replaced by the Rams who won Super Bowl XXXIV.\n\nNo, the wound that hurts the most is one that never healed. From 1955-56 to 1967-68, St. Louis was a vibrant piece of the emerging NBA. The Hawks played in the NBA Finals four times from '57 to '61, winning the title in 1958. Their star, Bob Pettit, is among the handful of greatest sports figures in the city's history. And eight other NBA Hall of Famers played for the St. Louis Hawks.\n\nBut after the 1967-68 season - the best record (56-26) in franchise history, owner Ben Kerner sold the team and it moved to Atlanta. Forty-five years later, it seems likely there will be a Starbucks on the moon before there is another NBA team in St. Louis.\n\nThe ABA Spirits (1974-75) brought professional hoops back briefly, but all that survives is their play-by-play announcer, Bob Costas. Oh, and a Post-Dispatch sportswriter who covered the Spirits but made his name writing about a different sport \u2014 Baseball Hall of Famer Rick Hummel."}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/3070018/2022/01/19/nba-75-at-no-23-elgin-baylor-used-his-strength-and-grace-to-create-magic-above-the-rim/", "page_content": "(Editor\u2019s note: Welcome back to The Athletic NBA 75. We\u2019re re-running our top 40 players to count down every day from Sept. 8-Oct. 17, the day before the opening of the 2022-23 NBA season. This piece was first published on Jan. 19, 2022.)\n\nIt was a maneuver that would hardly stand up to the scrutiny of modern tampering rules. But some five decades before that term entered the NBA lexicon, Bob Short needed some luck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, the new owner of the woeful Minneapolis Lakers created his own.\n\nIn March 1958, Short traveled to Washington, D.C., to the childhood home of Elgin Baylor, who was visiting his parents over spring break from Seattle University. Short showed up at the front door armed with an offer. If Baylor would forego his last year of college eligibility to enter the NBA Draft, the Lakers would not only make him the No. 1 overall pick but also give him a contract worth more than any team had ever paid a rookie: $25,000.\n\n\u201cI know the choice seems obvious,\u201d Baylor would later write in his autobiography, \u201cbut \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 it (was) not a slam dunk.\u201d\n\nIt was a recruiting trip that would alter the trajectory of basketball.\n\nBaylor, No. 23 on The Athletic\u2019s countdown of the 75 greatest players in NBA history, eventually agreed and, in the process, became the patriarch of a legacy of high-flyers in the decades to come. From Julius Erving to Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant to Giannis Antetokounmpo, they all can be traced to Baylor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve stolen so many of your moves, it\u2019s not even funny,\u201d Bryant said at the unveiling of Baylor\u2019s statue in front of the then-Staples Center in 2018.\n\nBaylor, who died in 2021, broke the NBA\u2019s single-game scoring record \u2014 twice \u2014 and his 61 points in an NBA Finals game against Boston in 1962 is a Finals mark that still has remained untouched 50 years later. He averaged a career-high 38.4 points in 1962 despite only playing when he was on weekend leave from the Army Reserves. He once sat out a game in Charleston, W.V., to protest a hotel that refused to give rooms to him and his two Black teammates.\n\nWhile in the Army Reserves during the 1961-62 season, Baylor played during his weekend leave and averaged 38.3 points in 48 games. (Bettmann / Getty Images)\n\nOn the court, he soared to new heights with a style previously unseen in the NBA. Columnist Jim Murray once wrote that \u201cwatching Elgin Baylor on a basketball court was like watching Gene Kelly in the rain.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe brought a high-flying blend of finesse and strength. He was a pioneer of spinning shots off the glass to finish at the rim and a savvy rebounder who players of his era compare to modern stars, Charles Barkley and Karl Malone.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019d get in trouble going to the basket in the air,\u201d said Hall of Famer Gail Goodrich, \u201che would just throw it against the backboard before it came down, and then go get it and then put it up. That\u2019s how smart he was.\u201d\n\nJerry West, Baylor\u2019s close friend and teammate for that first decade in Los Angeles, put it best.\n\n\u201cHe was kind of a glimpse to the future,\u201d West recently told The Athletic.\n\nA glimpse to the future whose greatness, in the eyes of some, has been lost to the past.\n\n\u201cHe gets lost a little bit when they talk about great forwards,\u201d said Goodrich, who played with Baylor on the Lakers for four seasons. \u201cEverybody wants to talk about (Larry) Bird or Julius Erving, or now the Greek Freak (Giannis Antetokounmpo). You talk about those guys because everybody\u2019s seen them play recently.\n\n\u201cHow many people saw Elgin play and are still living today and know basketball? Probably not a lot.\u201d\n\nIn 1958, all of that was still ahead of Baylor. And the very fate of the Lakers, a team that might have otherwise been lost to history like the Indianapolis Olympians or the Anderson Packers, rested on whether he accepted Short\u2019s offer that day in Washington.\n\n\u201cIf Elgin had turned me down,\u201d Short famously said, \u201cI\u2019d have gone out of business.\u201d\n\nShort\u2019s Lakers were no longer the dynasty of the early 1950s that had won five championships in six seasons. George Mikan and Jim Pollard and Slater Martin were all gone, and the Lakers were bleeding money. Fans had lost interest. In 1957-58, Short\u2019s first year after purchasing the team, the Lakers won just 19 times in a 72-game season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBaylor became the vehicle for Short to move the Lakers from Minneapolis to Los Angeles in 1960 after emerging as the game\u2019s most exciting star in his first two seasons. He averaged 24.9 points and 15 rebounds per game as a rookie, leading the Lakers, who went 33-39 in the regular season, to a surprise NBA Finals bid against the team that would repeatedly foil Baylor\u2019s championship dreams: the Boston Celtics.\n\nBaylor would come up short in the NBA Finals an astonishing eight times, and his notoriously bad knees forced him into retirement nine games into the 1971-72 season, (famously one game before the Lakers went on their historic 33-game winning streak), the season the Lakers finally won an NBA title in Los Angeles.\n\nOf those eight NBA Finals losses, 1959 was the first of seven to come against the Celtics and Baylor\u2019s longtime friend \u2014 and rival \u2014 Bill Russell. The two first met in 1956 at an NCAA Tournament Regional in Corvallis, Ore., when, Baylor wrote in his 2018 autobiography, \u201cHang Time,\u201d a hotel desk clerk gave him Russell\u2019s room number after a bellhop recognized him from magazine covers and asked for Baylor\u2019s autograph in exchange.\n\nAs a rookie, Baylor joined Russell on an All-NBA First Team that also included Bill Sharman and Bob Cousy of the Celtics and St. Louis Hawks star Bob Pettit.\n\n\u201cHe was the franchise, without question,\u201d said Goodrich, who as a teenager listened to Baylor\u2019s games on the radio and became his teammate with the Lakers in 1965.\n\n\u201cThe top forwards at that time were Elgin and Bob Pettit,\u201d Goodrich continued. \u201cPettit was old-school, 6-foot-9. A great, great player, but he was old-school. A big guy in and around the basket. Elgin, at 6-5, put the ball on the court and created, you know, from the true forward position and could rebound like hell.\u201d\n\nIn 1960, Short saw the potential of a move to Los Angeles after the Lakers played the Philadelphia Warriors and their star Wilt Chamberlain at the then-new L.A. Sports Arena. In those early days of the NBA, teams often traveled beyond their home markets to showcase the game. And after the Lakers and Warriors drew more than 10,000 fans in L.A., Short became convinced it was time to leave Minneapolis, where sometimes less than a tenth of that number wandered through the turnstiles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only vote against the relocation came from the president of the New York Knicks, who hoped the Lakers would lose enough money that Short would be forced to sell Baylor\u2019s rights to New York.\n\nAnd with that overwhelming majority, Baylor became the first Los Angeles Lakers superstar.\n\n\u201cIt was Elgin and Chick Hearn that sold NBA basketball to the city of Los Angeles,\u201d Goodrich said.\n\nJerry West was a rookie that first season in Los Angeles and said that Baylor stood out in a league in which many players, he acknowledged, were \u201cslow and ponderous.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was just about that time that the game started to change,\u201d West said. \u201cIn the sense, we had many more accomplished athletes.\u201d\n\nFuture Hall of Famer Dave Bing recognized the rise in the number of Black stars in the growing NBA.\n\n\u201cYou had Wilt, you had Russ (Bill Russell), you had Oscar (Robertson) and you had Elgin,\u201d Bing told The Athletic.\n\nThe difference within that group?\n\n\u201cElgin was the only one that had flair,\u201d said Bing, another member of the NBA\u2019s official 75th-anniversary team. \u201cHe could hang in the air, he could switch the ball from one hand to the other while he was up in the air. I mean, there was no weakness in his game. He could do everything.\u201d\n\nBing grew up in the same northeast D.C. neighborhood as Baylor and was fluent in his predecessor\u2019s legend.\n\n\u201cI played on the playground with guys who played with Elgin when he was in high school,\u201d Bing said. \u201cAnd all of the stories that they would tell us was that there was nobody like this, ever.\u201d\n\nBing saw it for himself, firsthand, when the neighborhood hero returned home for a series of five-on-five playground scrimmages against Chamberlain in 1957.\n\n\u201cI beat Wilt\u2019s team every time,\u201d Baylor wrote in his autobiography.\n\nBing clutched the fence and watched those two future NBA superstars square off. Baylor became his hero. He wore Baylor\u2019s No. 22 as an homage through high school and college at Syracuse until he reached the NBA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe reason I didn\u2019t wear No. 22 as a pro was because David DeBusschere, who was coach of Detroit, had 22,\u201d Bing said. \u201cNo way in hell am I gonna tell my coach, \u2018I want that number.\u2019 So I had to change my number to 21.\u201d\n\nBaylor speaks at his statue dedication ceremony in 2018 in Los Angeles. (Photo by Andrew D. Bernstein / NBAE via Getty Images)\n\nBaylor was an 11-time All-Star and made 10 All-NBA teams in his 13 seasons, although in the last two he played in just a total of 11 games as his knees finally gave out. Before that, however, he had been an unstoppable force.\n\nRichie Guerin of the New York Knicks once said Baylor \u201chas either got three hands or two basketballs out there. It\u2019s like guarding a flood.\u201d\n\nGuerin, a Hall of Famer, was on the court as an opponent for Baylor\u2019s then-record 71 points at Madison Square Garden on Nov. 15, 1960, and then, a season later, for Chamberlain\u2019s 100.\n\n\u201cBy far, Elgin\u2019s was the better performance,\u201d Guerin said in Terry Pluto\u2019s 1992 book, \u201cTall Tales: The Glory Years of the NBA.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat 71-point game remains the greatest individual effort I have ever seen. In Wilt\u2019s game, they set out to get him the record. There was nothing artificial about Elgin\u2019s 71. He got all the points in a natural flow.\u201d\n\nHearn, the Hall of Fame Lakers broadcaster, said: \u201cPeople ask me how good was Elgin. \u2026 Well, he may have been the greatest player ever.\u201d\n\nBaylor retired from the Lakers and, after a stint as a coach, went on to a lengthy career as the general manager of the Clippers, starting in 1986. That position likely created some distance between the original Lakers player and the franchise he helped bring to Los Angeles. West, who was the top basketball executive with the Lakers for much of Baylor\u2019s tenure, said he and Baylor remained close, even if their roles set them up to be rivals.\n\n\u201cWe talked all the time, and I tried to maintain a friendship with him,\u201d said West, who now serves as an executive with the Clippers. \u201cBut after I would hang up with him, honestly, I felt so bad. It\u2019s hard to even describe because I think of how he was treated there.\u201d\n\nWest continued: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t allowed to make any decisions. I felt he wasn\u2019t treated with dignity or class at all. That was painful for me to see.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, Baylor sued then-Clippers owner Donald Sterling, claiming he had been fired as a result of age and racial discrimination. According to the Los Angeles Times, Baylor later dropped the race accusations, and in 2011, a jury ruled in favor of Sterling.\n\nNine years later, however, when Baylor was honored with a statue, joining the likes of West, Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Shaquille O\u2019Neal in bronze, it was his Lakers legacy that was celebrated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m humbled,\u201d Baylor said that sunny April day. \u201cThankful for this recognition to be honored with other Lakers greats.\u201d\n\nThe very fact that four other Lakers legends received statues before Baylor speaks to the complexity of his legacy. Bing, who grew up idolizing Baylor before becoming a legend, said, \u201cElgin was an afterthought because he played before basketball became what it is today.\u201d\n\nBut without Baylor, would basketball have even become what it is today?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad that we forget that kind of history,\u201d Bing said, \u201cbecause, boy, did he make a lot of history. All we have to do is go back, and if there is film of games that he played in and fans today could just watch him for a moment, they would see true greatness.\u201d\n\nCareer stats: G: 846, Pts.: 27.4, Reb.: 13.5, Ast.: 4.3, FG%: 43.1, FT%: 78.0, Win Shares: 104.2, PER: 22.7\n\nThe Athletic NBA 75 Panel points: 799 | Hollinger GOAT Points: 213.5\n\nAchievements: Rookie of the Year (\u201959), 10-time All-NBA, 11-time All-Star, Hall of Fame (\u201977), NBA 35th Anniversary Team (\u201981), NBA at 50 (\u201996), NBA 75th Anniversary team (\u201921)\n\n(Illustration: Wes McCabe / The Athletic; Photo: Bettmann / Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/sports/basketball/NBA-championship", "page_content": "NBA championship The table provides a chronological list of winners of the NBA championship.

In 1976 the NBA absorbed four teams from the American Basketball Association (ABA), which disbanded that year.\n\nLeague growth and membership\n\nBy the early 1980s the NBA was plagued by money-losing franchises, low attendance, declining television ratings, and limited national appeal. The league soon rebounded under the leadership of David Stern, NBA commissioner from 1984, who helped transform it into an international entertainment company. Aggressive marketing highlighted star players such as Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and, especially, Michael Jordan. Other innovations included league limits on player salaries, lucrative broadcast rights for network and cable television, and expanded All-Star Game festivities.\n\nThe NBA membership was divided into two conferences, each with three divisions. There were 30 teams, aligned as follows:\n\nEastern Conference\n\nWestern Conference\n\nThe top-ranking teams at the end of each season engage in a playoff to determine the NBA champion, which claims the title of world champion. Probably the most dominant team in NBA history was the Boston Celtics, which, led by centre Bill Russell, won 11 of 13 titles from 1956\u201357 to 1968\u201369; however, the league in those years contained only 8 to 14 teams, and team owners widely avoided signing African American players at the time. Other outstanding clubs were the Minneapolis (later Los Angeles) Lakers in the 1950s, the Los Angeles Lakers in the \u201980s, and the Chicago Bulls in the \u201990s."}]}
