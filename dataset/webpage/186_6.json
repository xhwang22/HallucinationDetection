Featuring the evocative vocals of Caroline Lavelle and the masterful guitar work of Brian Hughes, Secret Sky weaves together a tapestry of Pop and World music with exotic textures of the Middle Eastern Oud, Puerto Rican Cuatro, and the hypnotic Greek Lyra played by a contemporary master of the Lyra, Sokratis Sinopoulos. Opium takes the listener on a remarkable musical journey accompanied by an All-Star cast of musicians. Caroline Lavelle and Brian Hughes have performed together for over 20 years when Caroline joined Brian as a member of Loreena McKennitt\u2019s recording and touring ensemble. The idea for Secret Sky was born on a shuttle ride from their hotel to the Sao Paulo airport at the end of a South American tour with Loreena in 2013. After sending numerous songs and recordings back and forth via the internet, Caroline from Cornwall, UK and Brian from Los Angeles the result was their 2016 self-titled debut album Secret Sky. Guitarist, Composer, and Producer Brian Hughes has been honored with the SOCAN / BMI Jazz & Instrumental Composer of the Year award seven times from 1997 to 2011 for his eight contemporary jazz recordings while his 36-year parallel career with Loreena McKennitt led to him receiving a Juno (Canadian Grammy) nomination as Producer of the Year for his work on her platinum-selling album, The Visit. Brian and Caroline\u2019s skills as musicians are in the foreground on Loreena\u2019s 2019 release \"Live at the Royal Albert Hall\" and on her 2012 Grammy-nominated trio recording \u201cTroubadours on the Rhine\u201d. McKennitt has sold over 15 million albums worldwide and Hughes along with Secret Sky bandmate Lavelle continue to appear together on numerous tours and recordings with Loreena. Caroline Lavelle\u2019s first foray as a vocalist was with Massive Attack, which brought her to the attention of William Orbit, who produced her first CD Spirit which garnered critical and popular acclaim. Among others, she has sung and / or played with Radiohead, Peter Gabriel, Vangelis, De Dannan, The Chieftains, Muse and The Indigo Girls. Her two other solo CDs (Brilliant Midnight and A Distant Bell) have produced songs since used on film & TV soundtracks including Six Feet Under, Joyride (John Dahl), The Eye of the Beholder (Ewan McGregor & Ashley Judd). Caroline Lavelle, vocals, cello Brian Hughes, guitar Special guests: Hugh Marsh, violin Tal Bergman, drums, percussion Tim Landers, bass Sokratis Sinopoulos, Lyra Matt Rohde, Hammond B3 organ Clare Kenny, bass (track 8) Produced by Brian Hughes\n\n\n\nCaroline Lavelle\n\nis a British cellist, composer, and singer / songwriter. She has released three solo albums, collaborated with numerous international musicians, and is currently a member of the trio Secret Sky.\n\nHer career as a cello player started by chance: as a child, she\u2019d been desperate to play the violin. On the day instruments were distributed, she was at the back of the queue. As luck would have it, when it was her turn, only a bassoon and a cello were left. Choosing the latter, she went on to study at the prestigious Royal College of Music in London. After graduating, she opted out of the orchestral route, preferring to perform her own compositions. \u201cThe creativity involved in writing one\u2019s own music and having to marry lyrics and arrangements is much more challenging for me. My greatest love is writing.\u201d\n\nCaroline Lavelle in the 1980sIn the early 80\u2019s Caroline recorded with acts such as Siouxie And The Banshees and Fun Boy Three, and busked in London with a group called Humoresque, together with Anne Stephenson and Gini Ball. Frankie Gavin from De Dannan spotted her busking, leading to a stint with the band for several years until the early \u201990s. From this period onwards, Caroline worked with a wide variety of acts (Radiohead, The Cranberries, Peter Gabriel, Nigel Kennedy, Ryuichi Sakamoto, among others), and provided vocals for artists such as Vangelis and Hector Zazou. Her vocal contribution to Massive Attack\u2019s song Home Of The Whale in 1992 led to her work on the soundtrack to the film The Eye Of The Beholder.\n\nIt was Home Of The Whale that also brought her to the attention of William Orbit, who asked her to work on an album. The resulting album (Spirit, 1995) featured a mix of traditional songs and original material written by Caroline, featuring William Orbit\u2019s trademark production. It garnered critical and popular acclaim and The Times reported that it had inspired Madonna\u2019s Ray of Light album.\n\nIn 2001 she released Brilliant Midnight, an album focusing more on Caroline\u2019s skills as a songwriter and producer of her own material, organically blending her own classically inspired instrumentation with electronic arrangements. A year later, Caroline set up her own record label Ringing Tree Records, re-releasing Brilliant Midnight in a revised edition, reflecting the vision she initially had for that album.\n\nA Distant Bell followed in 2004, and was met with positive reviews. The pastoral A Distant Bell could be described as Chamber Folk, and featured original material, traditional songs, and Caroline\u2019s musical settings of Brian Patten\u2019s poetry.\n\nTogether with Justin Elswick and Israel Curtis she has released several tracks for a project entitled Spythriller. A full-length album is in the works. In 2015 Caroline formed the band Secret Sky with Brian Hughes and Hugh Marsh. Having met 20 years earlier in 1995, the three have been playing as a part of Loreena McKennitt\u2019s band ever since. Their self-titled debut album was released in 2016. The band is currently working on a follow up album.\n\nBrian Hughes\n\nLos Angeles resident Brian Hughes has carved out an impressive career in the contemporary jazz arena. His first two albums, Between Dusk and Dreaming and Under One Sky, firmly established him as one of the foremost guitarists and composers in the genre, perfectly blending his fluid and emotive guitar style into an exciting, melodic mix of Latin, Jazz and World Music compositions. After being picked as a winner in JAZZIZ Magazine's \"Guitars On Fire\" competition his subsequent recordings Straight To You, One 2 One, Shakin\u2019 Not Stirred, Along the Way, Live and Fast Train To A Quiet Place have received critical acclaim and major radio air play from coast to coast. With his sizzling fret work and infectious compositions the media are accurate in saying: \"Both a great artist and an accessible one. His passion is so obvious, intense and contagious, that his audience shares it.\u201d Brian has received the SOCAN / BMI \"Jazz & Instrumental Composer of the Year\" award seven times from 1997 to 2011 and the title track from \u201cShakin\u2019 Not Stirred\u201d was featured on an episode of HBO\u2019s \u201cSex and the City\u201d.\n\nHughes is well known for his 35 year parallel career recording and touring with world renowned vocalist Loreena McKennitt (The Mummer\u2019s Dance). Brian\u2019s skills as a musician (guitars, oud, bouzouki) are in the foreground on her 2019 release \"Live at the Royal Albert Hall\" and his production & mixing talents are evident on her 2012 Grammy nominated recording \u201cTroubadours on the Rhine\u201d. McKennitt has sold over 15 million albums worldwide and Brian has toured the world several times with her, appearing on the \"Late Show\" with David Letterman and receiving a Juno (Canadian Grammy) nomination as \"Producer of the Year\u201d for his work on her platinum selling, Juno award winning album \u201cThe Visit\u201d.\n\nBrians' new side project Secret Sky brings together three of the most exciting and creative forces in Celtic/World music; Brian Hughes (guitars, oud & bouzouki), Caroline Lavelle (cello & vocals), and Hugh Marsh (fiddle). The three met over 20 years ago and have played together in Loreena McKennitt\u2019s band since. Their eponymous debut album is produced by Brian Hughes, and is an exciting collaboration that brings thrilling power and emotional depth to both traditional and self-penned songs.\n\nHughes has also accompanied Celtic music legends, The Chieftains, on several tours and has Produced and Mixed several international platinum selling albums for Greek recording artists Alkistas Protopsalti, Evanthia Reboutsika, Yannis Kotsiras and Panayotis Kalantzopoulos, including the soundtrack for A Touch of Spice the top grossing film in Greek cinema history.\n\nBrian's new project Secret Sky brings together three of the most exciting and creative forces in Celtic/World music, Brian Hughes, (guitars, bouzouki and oud), Hugh Marsh, (fiddle), and cellist and singer Caroline Lavelle. The three met over 20 years ago and have recorded and toured together in Loreena McKennitt\u2019s band since. Their soon to be released debut CD \"Secret Sky\", produced by Brian Hughes is an exciting collaboration, bringing thrilling power and emotional depth to both traditional and self-penned songs. Brian Hughes and Hugh Marsh are electrifying live improvisers as anyone who has been at a Loreena McKennitt concert will testify, and this album has allowed them the freedom and space to achieve the passionate feel reminiscent of some of the expansive, filmic albums of the 70s. Caroline Lavelle\u2019s trademark sultry voice occupies a greater range than she has used to date, ranging from the intimately delicate to a powerful folk rock persona, with her emotional cello playing making up a formidable range of talents across the trio. The other player's on the CD are drummer Tal Bergman (Loreena McKennitt, Joe Bonamassa, Rod Stewart, Simple Minds, Billy Idol) and bassist Tim Landers (Loreena McKennitt, Stevie Nicks, Tori Amos, Jethro Tull, BB King).\n\n"}, {"url": "https://bhsylvanhouse.bandcamp.com/album/straight-to-you", "page_content": "Digital Album Streaming + Download\n\nIncludes unlimited streaming via the free Bandcamp app, plus high-quality download in MP3, FLAC and more.\n\nPurchasable with gift card"}, {"url": "https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brian-hughes-mn0000620614/discography", "page_content": "Discography Brian Hughes Follow Artist +\n\nA versatile guitarist with a sound of his own, Brian Hughes creates unclassifiable music that is both accessible and at times adventuruous.

Espace Musique, Radio-Canada's Music Radio Network has managed to capture the very essence of Brian Hughes in concert. BRIAN HUGHES LIVE is one of the best live recordings I\u2019ve ever come across. The sonic quality glistens\u2026 it\u2019s stellar; the expression of Brian\u2019s guitar playing is nothing less than brilliant, the band is on and the audience, truly appreciative.... -Sandy Shore\n\n\n\nYou could call it aconcert hangover. The way you feel for a few days after experiencing an incredible live performance. You want to recapture the experience and share it with your friends, family, co-workers and even strangers you pass on the street. You load up your player with their music but the studio songs sound too polished, tweaked and restrained and live albums tend to rely more on delivering a series of hits than replicating a live performance. Brian Hughes has bypassed all that and captured an incredible live performance intact on his new self-released live CD. Simply titled Brian Hughes Live, it is a chance for fans to hear him in a completely natural setting where he can cut loose and show all the facets of his artistry. It is also a chance for those who aren't fans yet to catch up on one of the best and most unheralded guitarists in out there. An added benefit - play this for anyone who believes that smooth jazz is grandfather music or that jazz in general is too technical, pristine and academic and it will shake those preconceptions away in the span of any given solo. Recorded in Montreal by Espace Musique, Radio-Canada's music radio network in 2005, this CD is packed with moments of brilliance and genre-shifting depth. There are blistering rock guitar solos, pulse raising percussion jams, speedy flamenco runs, thumpin' bass breaks, keyboard solos that veer from atmospheric to fired up fusion. Through it all there are a group of innovative, seasoned musicians playing real instruments in a live setting. Hughes' guitar is upfront but this is an ensemble project. Every member of this tight-knit group gets their chance to stretch out and show what they can do, and what they can do is play with a wide range of nuance and style, seamlessly shifting from subtle to fiery to flashy and back often within the course of a even the briefest passage. The program is beautifully paced. The energized tracks and power solos are bridged by songs that are more meditative and nuanced. There are so many amazing moments and thrilling solos on this CD that I actually did start writing them down at one point. It was tempting to list them here in the spirit of you've gotta hear this..go to 4 minutes into track X! Especially since they are such good reference points for people who roll their eyes when you use the words jazz, instrumental, or smooth, or adult oriented. The list got long and ended up encompassing about 71 of the 72 minutes of music here so the best thing to do is just start anywhere on any track and prepare to be blown away. Three of these songs clock in at over 11 minutes and the rest hover in the eight minute range but there is never a moment when any song drags or becomes overindulgent. As a matter of fact there is so much going on that it actually seems to run shorter than it really is. One thing for sure, you'll return to these songs time and time again and probably dig in and replay some of the solos repeatedly too. It's quite a package and quite a gift he has given us. Real live music with nothing filtered out by some gatekeeper that feels like they have to underestimate the listeners and stay in an artificial safety zone. Hughes does not underestimate us at all. Hopefully the reward will be substantial sales driven by word of mouth buzz. Theres no way to be quiet about this one after you hear it. That's how music gets out there these days. Buy it, listen, then spread the word. -Shannon West --Shannon West Smoothviews\n\ncredits\n\nreleased August 26, 2011\n\nlicense\n\nall rights reserved"}, {"url": "https://www.guitarsite.com/newsletters/021216/3.shtml", "page_content": "Contact | Contents | Privacy Policy | Forum\n\nCopyright \u00a9 1999 - 2023 , All Rights Reserved.\n\nAffiliate Notice: As an Amazon Associate we earn from qualifying purchases."}, {"url": "https://www.folkandhoney.co.uk/all-our-uk-gigs/brian-hughes-a3697/", "page_content": "Edit Artist\n\nFolk Bands and Artists\n\nBrian Hughes\n\nBrian Hughes began playing traditional Irish music at a very young age, in his home town of Athy Co Kildare. By the age of 14 yrs, Brian had made TV appearances and had won County, Provisional, and All Ireland Titles on Tin Whistle and Flute. It was around this time that Brian developed a keen interest in the art of Uilleann Piping, and he attended classes in the Pipers Club in Dublin for many years.\n\n\n\nOver the following years, Brian became a well-known name in the world of traditional Irish music, and in 1997 he recorded and released his debut solo album, Whistle Stop, on the Gael Linn label.\n\n\n\nBrian has also recorded on the Clo Iar Connachta label and to date has recorded 5 albums, including a beautiful Airs project with the multi-instrumentalist Garry O Briain, and also a major musical suite for Uilleann Pipes, Whistle and orchestra, which Brian composed to celebrate the 100 anniversary of Ernest Shackleton\u2019s famous Endurance voyage.\n\n\n\nBrian Hughes has recorded with the very best in traditional Irish music over the last 20 years. He has produced the greatest body of whistle music ever recorded, and he is widely regarded as being one of the finest whistle players of his generation.\n\n\n\nBrian has been teaching for many years, both privately and at the many Summer Schools across the country each Summer.\n\n\n\nIt is now 20 yrs since Brian recorded his debut album in 1997, and to celebrate this he will release a new album this October, which will contain some of the recording highlights over this time. Tracks from all 5 albums will be included, and it should produce a definitive insight into the many styles, sounds and arrangements which were used on the different recordings, and the amazing musicians who have been involved along the way.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://bhsylvanhouse.bandcamp.com/album/fast-train-to-a-quiet-place", "page_content": "Digital Album Streaming + Download\n\nIncludes unlimited streaming via the free Bandcamp app, plus high-quality download in MP3, FLAC and more.\n\nPurchasable with gift card"}, {"url": "https://brianhughes1.bandcamp.com/releases", "page_content": "Digital Album Streaming + Download\n\nIncludes unlimited streaming via the free Bandcamp app, plus high-quality download in MP3, FLAC and more.\n\nPurchasable with gift card"}, {"url": "https://bhsylvanhouse.bandcamp.com/album/along-the-way", "page_content": "Digital Album Streaming + Download Includes unlimited streaming via the free Bandcamp app, plus high-quality download in MP3, FLAC and more.

Showcasing his most exciting melodies and guitar performances to date, the collection reflects on his cross country move from Toronto to Los Angeles and features guest performances from contemporary jazz stars, saxophonist Eric Marienthal and trumpet sensation Chris Botti.\n\n\n\n\"There is definitely a travel theme to Along The Way\", says Hughes, \"inspired partly by my move to Southern California and also by my extensive touring with (multi-platinum selling vocalist/recording artist) Loreena McKennitt \" (a 16 year relationship of recording and performing that continues to this day). \"In a way the new CD is a kind of loosely knit collection of musical postcards from my travels and the title serves as a metaphor for my musical journey.\"\n\n\n\n\"The move to Los Angeles has been very inspirational and the fantastic musicians who performed on Along The Way and make up my touring group, (bassist Tim Landers, well known for his work with guitarists Al Di Meola & Lee Ritenour, Neil Wilkinson, a top British session drummer who has worked with Paul McCartney, Van Morrison & Gil Evans to name a few, percussionist Jason Hann, who tours with Isaac Hayes & Rickie Lee Jones and longtime band member pianist Les Portelli), really take the music to new heights.\"\n\n\n\nThe musical chemistry is evident on Along The Way and Brian and the band have electrified audiences at festival and concert dates across the country. With his sizzling fret work and infectious compositions the media are accurate in saying: \"Both a great artist and an accessible one. His passion is so obvious, intense and contagious, that his audience shares it.\"\n\ncredits\n\nreleased July 8, 2003\n\nlicense\n\nall rights reserved"}]}
