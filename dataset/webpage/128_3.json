A former police officer, he was elected in 2004 as a member of the UK Independence Party but later had the whip withdrawn when allegations of misuse of parliamentary expenses surfaced in The Sunday Telegraph. Following an inquiry carried out by the European Anti-Fraud Office, Wise was formally charged with false accounting and money laundering by Bedfordshire Police. After initially pleading not guilty, he admitted the charges and was sentenced in November 2009 at Southwark Crown Court to a two-year term of imprisonment. He is thought to be the first MEP to be jailed for expenses fraud. Sentencing him, the judge said that Wise had engaged in \"deliberate and blatant dishonesty\" and had set about to defraud the European Parliament almost as soon as he was elected.\n\nEarly career\n\nBorn in Bournemouth, Wise attended Bournemouth School between 1959 and 1965, before completing a Diploma in Public Speaking in 1967. He served with Dorset Police before embarking on a career in the food distribution and processing industry. He became the UK Managing Director of a German herbs and spices company. From 1981 to 1989 he was a member of the Liberal Party.\n\nUKIP\n\nWise joined the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) in 1997. He served as office manager to Jeffrey Titford MEP, during this period he worked on the rules governing MEPs' expenses and gained an expertise in the system which he would later use to his advantage. He was the fourth-placed candidate on UKIP's candidate list in for the European Parliament elections in 1999, and also stood as the party's candidate in the 1997, 2001 and 2005 general elections for the South West Bedfordshire constituency. In the 2005 general election, he came fourth with 4.2% of the votes cast.\n\nHe was elected as an MEP for UKIP in the 2004 European elections. He was UKIP's official spokesman on the Culture, Youth, Media and Sport Committee until his suspension by the party in February 2007. In his first speech to the Committee on 4 October 2004, Wise criticised the proposed budget and drew allusions with Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. In his maiden speech to the Parliament on 16 December 2004, Wise blamed the European Union for creating unacceptable conditions for the transit of animals around Europe. Wise also spoke out against the Proposed directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions\n\nIndependent\n\nAfter losing the party whip in March 2007, Wise continued as an Independent within UKIP's Independence/Democracy parliamentary grouping pending the outcome of the fraud inquiry.\n\nDuring his time as an MEP, Wise disputed the genuine nature of the September 11th attacks. and labelled Russia-based businessman Alisher Usmanov, who is a shareholder of Arsenal F.C. a \"gangster and racketeer\"\n\nFollowing the decision to press criminal charges against him, Wise decided not to contest the 2009 European Parliament elections. He has however said that he wants to stand as an MP in the 2010 General Election.\n\nExposure\n\nOn 23 October 2005, a reporter for the Sunday Telegraph, Daniel Foggo, published an article accusing Wise of claiming \u00a336,000 a year from the European Parliament in the name of his researcher, Lindsay Jenkins, while only passing on about a sixth of that amount to her. According to now-repealed Rules governing the payment of expenses and allowances to Members of the European Parliament, MEPs could claim up to \u00a3125,000 per year for assistants' wages, but this money must be paid either directly to the employees or to a third-party agent. The rules did not allow the funds to pass directly through the hands of MEPs themselves.\n\nFoggo later reported that Wise had supplied the European Parliament's Payments Office with a \"contract\" including her name and details, which stipulated that the \u00a336,000 allowance should be paid into an account named \"Stags\". This account, held with the Co-operative Bank, was in fact Wise's own business account and its full name was \"T Wise trading as Stags\". The actual agreement between Wise and Jenkins stated that she would receive monthly \"retainer\" payments of \u00a3500 for advice and statistical research, with any extra work to be paid on top. Bank documents obtained by Foggo showed that between November 2004 and October 2005, Wise had paid \u00a339,100 to this account, out of which Jenkins received \u00a313,555. These funds were the only monies coming into the account. In another breach of the payment regulations, some of the \u00a313,555 paid to Jenkins represented work done on behalf of other UKIP members, including party leader Nigel Farage who had agreed to fund the publication of a eurosceptic pamphlet by Jenkins. A further \u00a319,000 was transferred from the account, some of which to pay off credit cards.\n\nOn 29 October, Wise admitted to breaching the rules and, to head off a scandal, agreed to repay \u00a325,230. An internal UKIP inquiry was launched after the Parliament became aware of the affair, but no action was taken and the results of the investigation were kept secret. As Daniel Foggo later reported, UKIP's former leader, Roger Knapman, halted the inquiry after it uncovered serious wrongdoing, believing that the European Parliament would clear Wise. Farage told reporter Daniel Foggo that Wise \"had committed a simple, silly error by making himself a \"paying agent\" for his own staff.\"\n\nSuspension from UKIP\n\nOn 23 February 2007, party sources at UKIP discovered that the European Parliament had passed the affair to OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office. A UKIP meeting was convened in Brussels on 28 February 2007 at which Wise formally admitted to having spent \u00a36,500 from the allowance on a dark green Peugeot 406 which he still drove, but refused to disclose how he had spent a further \u00a313,000 of the funds. After a heated discussion, a decision was taken to remove the whip; both Knapman and fellow MEP Mike Nattrass challenged the decision and threatened to reconsider their futures in the party. Farage emphasised that, if cleared by the OLAF investigation, Wise would be welcomed back into the party, adding that he thought \"there is a great deal of public sympathy for us.\" Wise was however suspended by the party.\n\nFollowing his suspension, Wise spent a further \u00a38,000 of the allowance in legal fees in contemplation of a libel case against Greg Lance-Watkins who had published claims on the Internet relating to Wise's activities. No action was ultimately brought against Lance-Watkins.\n\nNews of the World sting\n\nIn May 2008, the News of the World published details of a sting involving Tom Wise. A female reporter posing as a work experience student recorded Wise brazenly admitting in a Belgian bar that he had little idea of what his job as a Member of the European Parliament entailed, adding \"I don't know what an MEP's job is. No one's ever given me a job description. I've no idea what an MEP should or shouldn't do. So you make it up as you go along.\" He boasted of fiddling the Parliament's expenses system, stating \"Yes, I am milking the system [...] I have a simple philosophy. You and your parents are paying for me. Sorry, tough!\" The newspaper used its leading article to call for a change in the rules governing MEPs' expenses following the expos\u00e9.\n\nArrest and charges\n\nOn 20 June 2008, Wise was arrested by Bedfordshire Police's Economic Crime Unit on suspicion of making a false instrument, obtaining money by deception by transfer and converting criminal property. He was bailed until 29 October. Bedfordshire Police made the arrest after having been contacted by OLAF.\n\nOn 20 April 2009 the Crown Prosecution Service advised Bedfordshire Police to charge both Wise and Jenkins with one count each of false accounting contrary to the Theft Act 1968 and one count each of money laundering contrary to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Both were scheduled to appear before the City of Westminster Magistrates' Court on in April 2009 to face the charges. Wise indicated that he was innocent and would fight the charges which carry a maximum 14-year jail term. He is thought to be the first MEP to face criminal charges over the misuse of parliamentary funds, and the second former UKIP MEP after Ashley Mote to have faced criminal charges during a parliamentary session.\n\nTrial and conviction\n\nWise appeared in court on 27 April 2009 and spoke only to confirm his name and plead not guilty. Jenkins also denied the charges. District Judge Daphne Wickham released both on conditional bail until 8 June. The case was transferred to Southwark Crown Court and charges specified: that Wise and Jenkins \"falsified a document, namely a contract for provision of services, an application for secretarial assistance allowance and invoices\". Also, that they used funds \"received from the European Parliament intended for use as payments for secretarial services.\"\n\nThe three-week trial began on 2 November 2009. Judge Geoffrey Rivlin QC heard the prosecution argue that Wise channelled parliamentary funds into an account he secretly controlled so that he could pay credit card debts and buy fine wines. He made separate payments of \u00a32,228 and \u00a31,260 to wine importers, and maintained the deception by asking Jenkins to sign blank documents which he completed later. But for his exposure, Wise would, according to prosecutors, have claimed up to \u00a3180,000.\n\nOn the third day of the trial, just before Nigel Farage was due to give evidence against him, Wise began several hours of negotiations with his legal team after which he changed his plea to guilty and said he was entirely to blame for the fraud. This resulted in Jenkins being acquitted. He was sentenced on 10 November 2009 to two years imprisonment, the sentence having been reduced by one year on account of his guilty plea. In sentencing him, Judge Geoffrey Rivlin declared that:\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that you had hardly got your feet beneath your desk as an MEP before you were planning to defraud the parliament to which you were elected and the people you were elected to serve. This was very deliberate and blatant dishonesty. You did not fall into this offence as a result of some unfortunate combination of unforeseen circumstances which happened to suddenly present you with temptation. You knew the system of expenses inside out and this was a claim you devised and planned with some care.\n\nThe judge added that, in addition to jail, Wise would also have to pay \u00a330,000 towards the prosecution's costs.\n\nPersonal life\n\nWise is married to Janet and, until his imprisonment, lived in Linslade near Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire. He has two grown-up children.\n\nWise has a developed interest in wines, having followed courses arranged by the Wine & Spirit Education Trust and has reached \"the level just below Master of Wine\". He has spoken of having a wine cellar containing 1,000 bottles of wine."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15348166", "page_content": "Click on the pictures to read profiles of David Cameron's Conservative-Lib Dem coalition cabinet:\n\nPRIME MINISTER - DAVID CAMERON\n\nConservative David Cameron was virtually unknown outside Westminster when he was elected Tory leader in December 2005 at the age of 39.\n\nThe Old Etonian had dazzled that year's party conference with his youthful dynamism and charisma, reportedly telling journalists he was the \"heir to Blair\".\n\nHe has sought to match the former PM by putting the Conservatives at the centre ground of British politics.\n\nBefore becoming leader, he was the Conservatives' campaign co-ordinator at the 2005 general election and shadow education secretary.\n\nHe was special adviser to Home Secretary Michael Howard and Chancellor Norman Lamont in the 1990s before spending seven years as a public relations executive with commercial broadcaster Carlton.\n\nDEPUTY PRIME MINISTER - NICK CLEGG\n\nIn just five years, Liberal Democrat Nick Clegg, at 43 the same age as Mr Cameron, has gone from political obscurity to the absolute front line of British politics.\n\nAfter becoming MP for Sheffield Hallam at the 2005 election, he was promoted to Europe spokesman, before moving on to the home affairs role.\n\nWhen Sir Menzies Campbell resigned as leader in 2007, he entered the race to succeed him, in the end narrowly beating Chris Huhne.\n\nHe has campaigned against the government over civil liberties and opposed the Conservatives' spending cuts plans, attempting to create a distance between the Lib Dems and what he calls the \"old parties\".\n\nBut he really came to prominence during the televised debates ahead of the general elections, being judged in polls to have been the big winner of the first one.\n\nHowever, this appeared to do little to help the Lib Dems when they actually lost seats on 6 May. The party, though, retained enough MPs to become the vital players in the hung parliament.\n\nFOREIGN SECRETARY - WILLIAM HAGUE\n\nSince he returned to the shadow cabinet in 2005, Conservative William Hague has become a key adviser to David Cameron, and was seen as de facto deputy party leader.\n\nThe new foreign secretary has plenty of experience to call upon, having been Tory leader himself from 1997 to 2001 and shadow foreign secretary until the election.\n\nA witty and engaging Commons performer who is popular with grassroots Tory members, Mr Hague entered Parliament in 1989 having been special adviser to Chancellor Sir Geoffrey Howe. He was soon promoted to be a social security minister and in 1995 entered the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Wales.\n\nIn addition to his duties as shadow foreign secretary, Mr Cameron put Mr Hague in charge of rebuilding the party in the North of England, as chairman of its Northern Board.\n\nMr Hague has said that as foreign secretary, he is determined to put in place a \"distinctive British foreign policy\" and the situation in Afghanistan is a priority.\n\nMinister of State (Europe) - David Lidington (Conservative) Once a special adviser to Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and a parliamentary aide to William Hague, he is regarded as being less eurosceptic than those who occupied this important role when the Tories were in opposition\n\nMinister of State - Jeremy Browne (Liberal Democrat) A former Lib Dem press chief, he has been MP for Taunton since 2005.

The two have emulated them by becoming prime minister and chancellor, but will want to avoid the spats.\n\nBefore entering Parliament, he was a special adviser in the agriculture department when the Tories were in government and later served as political secretary to William Hague.\n\nThe BBC understands that as chancellor, Mr Osborne, along with the Treasury will retain responsibility for overseeing banks and financial regulation.\n\nMr Osborne said the coalition government was planning to change the tax system \"to make it fairer for people on low and middle incomes\", and undertake \"long-term structural reform\" of the banking sector, education and the welfare state.\n\nFinancial Secretary - Mark Hoban (Conservative) A chartered accountant, he first stood for Parliament in 1997 before being elected in 2001.\n\nExchequer Secretary - David Gauke (Conservative)\n\nCommercial Secretary - Sir James Sassoon (Conservative) Not an MP. To be given peerage\n\nHOME SECRETARY AND MINISTER FOR WOMEN AND EQUALITY - THERESA MAY\n\nTheresa May is the biggest winner so far in jobs allocated in the new cabinet, becoming only the second woman to hold the post of Home Secretary.\n\nShe was the first woman to become Conservative Party chairman, under the leadership of Iain Duncan Smith.\n\nShe then took up the culture and family portfolios before being made shadow Commons leader by David Cameron.\n\nShe has been a keen advocate of positive action to recruit more women Tories to winnable seats and was a key architect of the \"A list\" of preferred candidates.\n\nA passionate moderniser she famously ruffled feathers when she told Tory activists they were seen as members of the \"nasty party\".\n\nMs May was the shadow work and pensions minister ahead of the election.\n\nImmigration Minister - Damian Green (Conservative)\n\nThe 54-year-old rattled the previous government over immigration and sparked a cause celebre after being arrested by police investigating leaks - from his new government department.\n\nSecurity Minister - Baroness Pauline Neville-Jones (Conservative)\n\nThe baroness, 70, is a former governor of the BBC and was the first woman to chair the UK's Joint Intelligence Committee.

He also backed Michael Portillo's 2001 leadership bid.\n\nIn summer 2002, he went to shadow the now defunct Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and local government department before being made shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, at the age of 51, in the July 2007 reshuffle.\n\nHe became Transport Secretary after David Cameron's coalition took power after the 2010 election, building on his reputation there as an effective performer before being shifted into the defence brief after the resignation of Liam Fox from the job in October 2011.\n\nArmed Forces Minister - Nick Harvey (Liberal Democrat)\n\nThe 48-year-old MP for North Devon was his party's shadow defence secretary from 2006.\n\nJunior Defence Minister - Gerald Howarth (Conservative)\n\nGerald Howarth was the shadow defence minister from 2002, with responsibility for procurement and the air force.\n\nJunior Defence Minister - Andrew Robathan (Conservative)\n\nLORD CHANCELLOR AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR JUSTICE - KEN CLARKE\n\nMr Cameron has previously said that Mr Clarke was a \"big figure\" with \"great experience\". He was the last chancellor to lead the UK out of recession - during the John Major government of the 1990s.\n\nHis return to the Tory frontbench last year was seen as somewhat of a gamble for Mr Cameron given that Mr Clarke - who held a host of ministerial jobs in the Thatcher and Major governments - had staunchly pro-European views.\n\nThese views were widely seen to be the reason for his failure to win the three party leadership contests he entered - but Mr Cameron decided that Mr Clarke's experience was worth the risk of reopening party splits.\n\nMr Clarke was president of the union at Cambridge, became a QC in 1980 and after a succession of junior ministerial jobs he served as health, education and home secretaries before becoming chancellor from 1993 to 1997.\n\nMinister of State - Lord McNally (Liberal Democrat)\n\nTom McNally is the Lib Dem Leader in the House of Lords.

However, he later faced criticism for his central role in the disastrous 2001 poll campaign.\n\nHe returned to the shadow cabinet in 2003 under Michael Howard as shadow health secretary, the role he continues to hold under David Cameron.\n\nMr Cameron had long guaranteed Mr Lansley - who has played a key role in convincing people that the NHS is a high priority for the Conservatives - the role of health secretary in a government led by him.\n\nMinister of State - Paul Burstow (Liberal Democrat) Former Liberal Democrat chief whip, he is regarded as an expert on care for the elderly\n\nMinister of State - Simon Burns (Conservative)\n\nJunior Health Minister - Anne Milton (Conservative)\n\nJunior Health Minister - Earl Howe (Conservative) One of about ninety remaining hereditary peers in the House of Lords, the former banker held a number of ministerial positions in the Major government.

The former Times journalist is a key member of David Cameron's inner circle who helps write many of his speeches.\n\nAs the Tories' housing spokesman, Mr Gove made a name for himself as an effective Commons performer in attacks on the government's home information packs.\n\nHe was drafted into the shadow cabinet, as children, schools and families spokesman, at the age of 39 when his leader split the education brief in two to reflect Gordon Brown's Whitehall changes.\n\nMr Gove headed the Policy Exchange think tank for three years before landing the safe seat of Surrey Heath.\n\nHe had previously said he was prepared to give up a post in the new Cabinet to ensure the deal with the Lib Dems went ahead, but he sticks with the education brief in government.\n\nSchools Minister - Nick Gibb (Conservative)\n\nBorn in 1960, Nick Gibb was a shadow education and skills minister under Michael Howard in 2001, and then from May 2005 was shadow education minister and shadow schools minister.

They\u2019ve been spotted at Commons drinks receptions, parliamentary Labour Party gatherings, European Research Group meetings and snapping photos in Westminster Hall.\n\nHere are 20 fresh-faced parliamentarians who could sooner or later become big names.\n\n1. Siobhan Baillie, who won the key swing seat of Stroud off Labour, has quickly been marked out as a rising star and is tipped to get promoted quickly. Her backstory \u2014 she was born in Yorkshire, left home at 15 and worked her way into the legal profession at 17 without having attended university \u2014 makes her a prime example of the kind of person the Conservatives want to be seen as bringing forward.\n\nParty: Conservative\n\n2. Florence Eshalomi beat competition from Momentum to win the fiercely contested selection in Vauxhall \u2014 having fought off a similar challenge when she was a member of the London Assembly. Her maiden speech, in which she warned that Londoners risked becoming \u201cdesensitized\u201d to knife crime, was widely praised and got covered by the Evening Standard. She has also been applauded for speaking about caring for her mother, who suffered from sickle cell anemia.\n\nParty: Labour\n\n3. Laura Trott is a familiar face in Westminster, having worked for years as a political adviser before becoming director of strategic communications for David Cameron.

She has already made an impression among members of the parliamentary party as being quietly competent. She beat Bonnie Craven \u2014 who was understood to be the Labour leadership\u2019s preferred candidate \u2014 to get selected for the seat, and has now backed Keir Starmer and Rosena Allin-Khan in the party\u2019s leadership contest.

In her maiden speech, she spoke about supporting the NHS and championing diversity.\n\nParty: Labour\n\n9.

Saqib Bhatti beat Nick Timothy \u2014 Theresa May\u2019s former chief of staff \u2014 to get selected as the Tory candidate for Meriden. A chartered accountant, he has spoken about being influenced by his father, who moved from Pakistan to the U.K. in search of better opportunities.

Zarah Sultana caught attention with her combative maiden speech, which decried \u201cforty years of Thatcherism\u201d and sparked a fierce debate about the achievements of the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown governments. Elected in the narrow marginal of Coventry South, she introduced Rebecca Long-Bailey at the launch of her leadership campaign, and is now beefing up her social media presence. She can expect to benefit if Long-Bailey wins.\n\nParty: Labour\n\n13. Miriam Cates, who won Penistone and Stocksbridge off Labour, is a key face of the Conservative Party\u2019s drive to get more women elected (a campaign still in its infancy, given that only a quarter of its MPs are women). Before becoming an MP, she ran a small software company with her husband, and is one of a number of northern Tory women who could rise up the ranks.\n\nParty: Conservative\n\n14. Danny Kruger is one of several former advisers in the new intake, and has made the move from Downing Street \u2014 where he worked briefly as an aide to Boris Johnson \u2014 to parliament, where he was elected for the safe seat of Devizes. He previously was a speechwriter for David Cameron, and is the son of celebrity chef Prue Leith.\n\nParty: Conservative\n\n15. Alicia Kearns, the new MP for Rutland and Melton, is a former civil servant who has worked on defense and foreign policy and has vowed to focus on counterterrorism and national security as an MP. Together with a colleague, Theo Clarke, she has been working to coordinate the 2019 Conservative intake into a slate to vote for select committee chairs.\n\nParty: Conservative\n\n16. Nadia Whittome is Britain\u2019s youngest MP at 23, representing Nottingham East. She captured headlines when she announced she would keep just \u00a335,000 of her \u00a379,000 salary and give the rest to charities, and has become a fixture of broadcast media rounds as well. On election night, she vowed to be a \u201cnew kind of MP, inspired by radical women of color across the world\u201d and champion the same politics as Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nParty: Labour\n\n17. Amy Callaghan narrowly beat Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson in the marginal seat of East Dunbartonshire, quickly becoming one of the highest-profile MPs of the new intake. Marked out by SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon as a rising star, she comes from a working-class background and survived skin cancer after developing it as a teenager. She has pledged to protect the NHS and raise awareness about the symptoms of cancer among young people.\n\nParty: SNP\n\n18. Bell Ribeiro-Addy worked as an adviser to the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, before she was elected MP for the safe seat of Streatham. She comes from an activist background, having been black students\u2019 officer for the National Union of Students and convenor of its anti-racism and anti-fascism campaign. She is backing Rebecca Long-Bailey and Richard Burgon in the Labour leadership contest, and could benefit from a victory from the left in the contest.\n\nParty: Labour\n\n19. Lee Anderson wins the prize for the most interesting political journey. A long-term Labour Party member and office manager for Gloria De Piero in Ashfield, he defected to the Conservatives in 2018 and went on to win the seat off Labour at this election. He personifies the Tories\u2019 new voter base in former Labour seats.\n\nParty: Conservative\n\n20. Kenny MacAskill is an unusually experienced newcomer, beating Labour to win the marginal seat of East Lothian. He was previously a member of the Scottish parliament for nearly two decades and Scotland\u2019s Cabinet secretary for justice between 2007 and 2014. He decided to make a comeback to politics because he saw this election as the \u201cfinal heave\u201d that could lead Scotland to independence. The SNP parliamentary party in Westminster could benefit from his long memory.\n\nParty: SNP"}, {"url": "https://leapwiseadvisory.com/about/our-people/tom-gash/", "page_content": "Tom Gash is Leapwise Managing Director, leading the organisation, overseeing some of its most critical projects, and developing many of Leapwise\u2019s tools and methods.

Some require training, experience, rigorous testing and background checks, while others can basically be purchased while putting in little or no time. SmartAsset.com lists a few of the more rigorous designations as:\n\nCPA (certified public accountant) CFP (certified financial planner) ChFC (chartered financial consultant) CFA (chartered financial analyst)\n\nSome financial designations target seniors. Designations and awards, like the example I gave above, are for sale and require no more vetting than handing over your credit card number. My dog was also offered a spot in a physicians\u2019 magazine as a top adviser for doctors. As previously mentioned, many designations are just used to build credibility, and some awards also target seniors specifically.\n\nSo how do you know if the adviser wanting your money truly has expertise and worked hard to build the necessary skills? Here are a few steps to figure that out.\n\nStep 1: Start with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)\n\nFINRA is the main self-regulatory body of the financial services industry. This FINRA tool lists 213 financial designations, although some of the designation issuers are now defunct. It gives the following information:\n\nName of the issuing organization\n\nPrerequisites, such as education\n\nExamination type\n\nContinuing education requirements\n\nIt also notes whether the organization has a process to confirm the adviser holds that designation, whether it has a complaint process and whether it lists those who have been disciplined. The tool has hyperlinks that can make it easy to check out a financial adviser.\n\nIf the organization is defunct or appears to be a slam-dunk certification, look elsewhere.\n\nStep 2: Do 10 minutes of internet research\n\nIf the designation looks legitimate on the FINRA tool, or if you are checking out an award not listed by FINRA, then a quick internet search may help. You can type in phrases like \u201cobtaining the XYZ designation\u201d and see what's involved. One senior designation I looked at entailed paying some money and attending a three-day seminar in Las Vegas.\n\nIf it's an award or list of top advisers, look to see what's involved or if anyone has written about it, such as the award given to my dog. That same organization also issues top doctor, dentist, lawyer and other awards, and there are many articles online exposing these pay-for-prestige practices.\n\nNext check out that person. In addition to any complaint or disciplinary action by the organization issuing the designation, financial regulators also list actions. FINRA's Broker Check and the Security and Exchange Commission's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure website are two good places to look. Don't assume that because the issuing organization shows no discipline that other organizations (or the government) haven't disclosed misdeeds. In 2019, The Wall Street Journal noted there were more than 6,300 CFP certificants who had clean records on the CFP website but that had disclosures on the FINRA website, including felony charges."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tom_Wise_(politician)", "page_content": "Dear Wikiwand AI, let's keep it short by simply answering these key questions:\n\nCan you list the top facts and stats about Tom Wise (politician)?\n\nSummarize this article for a 10 years old"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-62796077", "page_content": "Liz Truss became prime minister on 6 September 2022, replacing Boris Johnson who was in post for slightly more than three years.\n\nShe was not the first choice of Conservative MPs - but she was the clear winner in a ballot of Tory members, who had the final say.\n\nTruss has been a government minister since 2012, and held cabinet posts under David Cameron, Theresa May and Johnson, most recently as foreign secretary.\n\nA Remain supporter at the 2016 EU referendum, who began her political journey at Oxford University as a Liberal Democrat, she is now an enthusiastic Brexiteer who has vowed to get back to traditional tax-cutting Tory values.\n\nTruss, who has two children, was elected to Parliament as MP for South West Norfolk in 2010 after serving as deputy director of think tank Reform."}]}
