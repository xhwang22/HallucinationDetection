After countless singles and management changes; \u201cShay\u201d, a fierce, sassy, eccentric, edgy persona manifests to counter, \u201cSeyi\u201d, the traditional, homely, sultry, sleek, sexy diva exhibited in her debut single \u201cLoving Your Way\u201d. Diamonds are formed under pressure; with Tiwa Savage championing the afro-pop/beats genre and Yemi Alade governing the world and highlife music realm, Seyi did not break, rather the contralto created an alter ego to aid her find sonic balance between her western music influences and afro music to ensure that her \u201cslayage\u201d was supreme.\n\nDid Seyi Shay deliver on her debut album? Yes, it is what the career doctor prescribed! Although Shay painfully dragged tons of male afro-pop giants to bless the set with \u201cstreet credibility\u201d at various stops; Seyi shines like an \u201cIrawo\u201d vocally, tackling various societal issues facing females and serving a near-perfect blend of ragga, afro-pop and highlife. Amidst the constant struggle between the different characters of \u201cSeyi\u201d or \u201cShay\u201d, she tackles each number with emotional precision, skill and exceptional singing. Seyi Shay might not have the most expansive vocal range or be a vocal powerhouse yet she one of the most technical vocalists Nigeria has to offer.\n\nFor deeper insight on the album, digest our track-to-track analysis of \u201cSeyi or Shay\u201d.\n\nIntro: Having dealt with her alter-ego first hand, Seyi introduces us to the care-free Shay, so that we are not caught off guard by her larger-the-life personality. The Mic: Over a pop rock inspired instrumentation, Shay talks about Seyi\u2019s struggle and the constant pressure she faced from society to rise to the occasion and succeed; she also gets cocky about the success she has attained as she sings, \u201cI got the mic now, I guess I\u2019m famous\u2026I won\u2019t use a gun, I kill them with my mic now, right now..\u201d on the electronic guitar enriched chorus. In Public (feat. Cynthia Morgan): Attention demanding synths, claps and kicks explode as Shay and the controversial Cynthia Morgan sing about the battle of not being the \u201cside-chic\u201d and wanting to be seen \u201cIn Public\u201d with their lover. A perfect collaboration simply because Cynthia Morgan has the same persona with Shay. Mary (feat. Phyno): Seyi Shay enlists indigenous Igbo speaking rapper Phyno on Otee Beatz produced hip-hop influenced \u201cMary\u201d. She sings about the song\u2019s character, a girl with a bad reputation; not the strongest song on the set but it just slides in. It is very safe to say that the said Mary, Shay sings about is Marijuana. Right Now: The sultry \u201cRight Now\u201d is a mid-tempo reggae/R&B fusion that expresses the singer nostalgia about a former lover. She takes the bull by the balls proceeding to tell the said lover; \u201cTouch Me Now, Right Now, now, now\u2026\u201d on the explosive chorus. She wants to recreate the relationship that happened in the past; that said the sexy number sprinkled slightly with Pidgin English is a lush ear candy. Healer (feat. Sound Sultan): Seyi plans to heal the world with love accompanied by Sound Sultan. Just like \u201cRight Now\u201d, the ragga inspired \u201cHealer\u201d produced by Harmony Samuels is a sure winner. Crazy (feat. Wizkid): Shay takes centre stage, as the seventh track kicks in. A thumping high-octane afro-beat duet with Wizkid, on the production angle by Lgendury Beatz. No Vacancy: The Tee-Y Mix produced \u201cNo Vacany\u201d, sees Seyi return to the musical stylings of her debut singles \u201cNo Lele\u201d, \u201cLoving Your Way\u201d and \u201cIrawo\u201d. Seyi sings about out-growing a past lover from a hazardous relationship who is seeking to return. This is a captivating afro R&B gem, packed with brilliant vocal layering, background vocals and ad-libs. \u201cNo Vacany\u201d is a personal favourite from the LP; it showcases various shades of Seyi\u2019s vulnerabilities and strengths. Pack and Go (feat. Olamide): Aimed at gaining Shay, a street-hop base and give the LP some street cred. Olamide guest stars on \u201cPack and Go\u201d. Despite the annoying use of effects on Shay\u2019s vocals, \u201cPack and Go\u201d talks about domestic abuse in an interesting manner. The returnee vocalist wants out of an abusive relationship, while the street-hop titan wants to make it work; in all the Pheelz produced rap-sung track Murda (feat. Shaydee & Patoranking): Easy, breezy, and beautiful! Seyi Shay feeds off Patoranking ragga style and Shaydee\u2019s distinct vocals to deliver a clean mid-tempo summer ragga number. Higher: Seyi flips the coin as she brings her stellar pipes, hunting instrumentation on a powerful message that rises to unexpected heights vocally and musically. \u201cHigher\u201d showcases Seyi\u2019s amazing singing abilities, even more than the previously leaked \u201cAir Brush\u201d. Spiritually themed, \u201cHigher\u201d is arguably \u201cSeyi or Shay\u201d brightest moment. Everlasting Love: Although it becomes likeable when not fully paid attention, the lukewarm poppy \u201cEverlasting Love\u201d drops the bar. Killing Me Softly (feat. Timaya): Reworked and slightly different from the version released as a single in 2013; the album version of the Timaya assisted \u201cKilling Me Softly\u201d is very likeable and easy to digest. \u201cKiling Me Softly\u201d glides into the set without hassle. Church (feat. Boj): Seyi plans to take her haters and enemies to the church with this infectious, smooth and groovy mid-tempo duet with underrated alternative artiste Boj. Seyi exercises restraint allowing the calm melody and message do most the work although we would have loved to hear Seyi go big on the chorus like she did on \u201cNo Vacancy\u201d or \u201cHigher\u201d. Loud (feat. Femi Kuti): A Seyi Shay and Femi Kuti collaboration sounds fabulous on paper but not so much in reality. \u201cLoud\u201d is average at best as Shay employs the eldest son of afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti, to bless her afrobeat inspired track with his Saxophone; Kuti delivered but Shay\u2019s lyrics and delivery missed the bull\u2019s eye. Tina (feat. D\u2019Banj): Featuring D\u2019banj to tap into his fanbase has it pros and Listeners might end up being torn between D\u2019banj drowning Seyi with his vocals and the beauty of the harmonica enriched highlife instrumentation. On \u201cTina\u201d, D\u2019banj fails to compliment Seyi\u2019s vocals or arouse any goosebumps. Love Wan Tin Tin: Seyi gets back on her feet with a racy delivery on \u201cLove Wan Tin Tin\u201d. Where did you go? The 3 minutes R&B and high-life fusion is short and sweet. \u201cLove Wan Tin Tin\u201d is the album filler the doctor prescribed. More Seyi and Tee-Y Mix please? Jangilova: Ending the musical ordeal is the Del B produced high-life romantic number \u201cJangilova\u201d. Seyi\u2019s shakes off her western musical styling and sings like a foreigner trying to impress a villager and tries to embody the \u201chighlife diva\u201d on \u201cJangilova\u201d. Not the most epic album finale to be experienced, yet a Seyi Shay and Del B combo is a meal not to miss. Right Now (Remix) : Iyanya and Banky W did not push right now to new boundaries; the original slays this remix. Camp Shay should have treated us to bonus tracks from previous released singles richer than this so-so remix; they could have picked from \u201cRagga Ragga\u201d, \u201cChairman\u201d, \u201cNo Lele\u201d, \u201cLoving Your Way\u201d, \u201cIrawo\u201d or \u201cAir Brush\u201d.\n\nRating: 3/5\n\nReviewed by Ogaga Sakpaide\n\nOgaga Sakpaide is a music enthusiast and digital public relations expert.\n\nThe thoughts expressed in this article are solely the author\u2019s.

She also wrote \"You Will See\", a song that was included on Melanie C's third studio album Beautiful Intentions (2005). Shay wrote \"White Lies\", a song from Chip's Transition album. In 2008, she became the lead singer for the now defunct pop girl group From Above. The group signed a recording deal with Sony's Columbia Records and was managed by Mathew Knowles' Music World Entertainment company. In November 2013, Shay signed an endorsement deal with telecommunications service provider Etisalat. In July 2015, she signed a record deal with Island Records. In 2015, she signed a 2-year endorsement deal with Pepsi. Shay released her debut studio album Seyi or Shay in November 2015. It was supported by the promotional singles: \"Irawo\", \"Ragga Ragga\", \"Right Now\" and \"Murda\" featuring Patoranking and Shaydee. In January 2021, she signed a publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group France division, in partnership with Universal Music France.\n\nLife and career\n\nShay was born and raised in Tottenham, London, England, to Nigerian parents. Her mother was from Northern Nigeria and her father is a native of Ife. She has two elder brothers and an elder sister. She and her siblings were raised by their single mother. Shay grew up in a Christian home. She often felt like a single child during her adolescence as she is the single child between her mother and father. She started visiting Nigeria when she was two years old, and eventually attended the Command High School in Maryland, Lagos. She went back to London to complete her undergraduate studies, where she also attended and graduated from the University of East London, with a BA Hons in Music business management. Her interest in music was influenced by members of her household. Her late mother was a chorister and her sister used to compose songs for the BBC and her brother was a prominent club and radio DJ in London. Shay joined her secondary school choir and started performing at the age of 6. She performed for the London Community Gospel Choir during their world tour, which included 13 cities in Japan. In an interview with Lanre Odukoya of Thisday, Shay said that her mother wasn't a staunch supporter of her musical ambitions. Moreover, her mother wanted her to become a doctor or lawyer. Prior to departing the Earth, her mother told her to focus on her music career and put God first.\n\nHer music career took an upswing when she signed her first ever record deal with No Apologies, a record company affiliated with Sir George Martin (commonly referred to as the \"Fifth Beatle\"). In 2006, Shay formed a girl band in the UK called Boadicea; they were managed by Ron Tom, the founder and manager of All Saints and Sugababes. The band separated after two years, and Shay decided to partake in the From Above UK singing audition. After the conclusion of the audition, she emerged as the lead vocalist for the now defunct girl group From Above. The group inked a record deal with Mathew Knowles' management company after performing for him. They were taken to Houston to undergo energetic vocal and dance trainings.

They presented the Best New Act award to Bruno Mars at the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards and had their own MTV reality show called Breaking From Above, which aired in over 166 countries around the world.

In 2013, Shay left Fly time Music and told Vanguard newspaper that she had joined the label to promote her brand. She also said that while signed to the record label, she was very much in control of her brand. Moreover, she said she still has a relationship with the label.\n\nArtistry and role models\n\nAlthough her musical style is primarily a combination of Afropop and R&B, Shay doesn't conform to a particular genre of music. She believes that her musical prowess covers different genres, and has stated that her music draws from things that inspire her. Shay has cited her mother, Mathew Knowles, 2face Idibia, Beyonc\u00e9, Tina Turner, Sound Sultan, Wizkid, and Omawumi as mentors.\n\nNotable performances\n\nShay performed at the 2013 COSON song awards.

She is known for several of her songs such as \u2018Right Now\u2019 and \u2018Irawo\u2019.\n\nOnly a handful of female artists have succeeded in making a huge breakthrough with their singing talent, and their efforts largely impact the Nigerian music industry. One of such women with an excellent career in the industry is Seyi Shay. As a reward for her efforts, Seyi Shey not only boasts a massive fan base but also a mouth-watering net worth estimated at $4.5 million.\n\nSeyi Shay is undoubtedly one of the reigning queens of the Nigerian music industry, thanks to her ability to churn out some chart-topping hit after hit.\n\n\n\nSeyi Shay Profile Summary Birth Name: Deborah Oluwaseyi Joshua\n\nDeborah Oluwaseyi Joshua Also Known As: Seyi Shay (pronounced Shay-yee Shay)\n\nSeyi Shay (pronounced Shay-yee Shay) Date of Birth: December 21, 1985\n\nDecember 21, 1985 Age: 37 Years Old\n\n37 Years Old Place of Birth: Tottenham, London, United Kingdom\n\nTottenham, London, United Kingdom State of Origin: Osun State\n\nOsun State Nationality: Nigeria\n\nNigeria Occupation: Singer, songwriter, performer, actress\n\nSinger, songwriter, performer, actress Music Genre: Afropop, R&B, Afro-soul, Afro-fusion\n\nAfropop, R&B, Afro-soul, Afro-fusion Active Years: 2001 \u2013 present\n\n2001 \u2013 present Marital Status: Single\n\nSingle Net Worth: $4.5 million\n\nSeyi Shay Hails from Osun State, South-West Nigeria\n\nThe Afropop singer is one of many Nigerian celebrities who were born abroad. She was born in Tottenham, London, England, to Nigerian parents who named her Oluwaseyi Odedere. Seyi\u2019s father is an indigene of Ife (a town in Osun State, South West, Nigeria), which means the singer\u2019s ethnicity is Yoruba. However, her mother hails from one of the Northern states in Nigeria. Nothing much is known about her parents and siblings except that they lived in the United Kingdom for many years.\n\nSeyi spent her early years in England until she was 2 years of age when she started visiting her home country, Nigeria. She eventually relocated to Nigeria, where she completed her high school education at Command High School, Maryland, Lagos State. She holds a degree in music and business management, which she obtained from a local UK college and the University of East London, respectively.\n\nHer Family Has an Extensive Background in Music\n\nBeing born into a family with proximity to a certain profession could help you develop a special interest in it, gain inside knowledge, and even be privy to career-centered opportunities that others may not have access to. This is a true situation for Seyi Shay, who grew up among family members with a passion for music. Shay was raised by her single mother, who, as a Christian, was a church chorister. She has three siblings- two brothers, one of which was a prominent club and radio DJ in London, and a sister who used to compose songs for the BBC.\n\nIt took Seyi Shay only a few years to master some aspects of music, after which she decided to pursue a professional career in music. At the young age of six, Shay joined her secondary school choir to perform for the London Community Gospel Choir during their world tour, which included 13 cities in Japan. She was also a member of several musical groups over there. Her talent has also taken her to several cities in many countries, where she wowed the audience with her wonderful voice.\n\nHer participation in the competition further fueled her passion for pursuing music as a career. When it was time for Seyi to take up courses that would help her boost her career in music, she faced strong opposition from her mother, who wanted her to become a doctor or lawyer. However, before her death, her mother told her to focus on her music career and put God first.\n\nA Look At Seyi Shay\u2019s Breakthrough in the Music World\n\nBeing a successful female musician in a competitive industry dominated by men is not an easy feat. It requires talent, prowess, effort, expertise, and a lot of hard work, and Seyi Shay has proven she has all it takes to take over the music industry in her home country and beyond. Her music career started when she signed her first music deal with the record label No Apology, and afterward, formed a UK-based girl band called Boadicea in 2006. However, the group went their separate ways two years later.\n\nThe Nigerian-based artist became the group\u2019s lead vocalist after she won the highly-coveted \u201dFrom Above UK singing audition,\u201d which led to the group signing a deal with Matthew Knowles\u2019 management company and undergoing serious vocal and dance training. The girls also launched their own MTV reality show titled: \u201cBreaking From Above\u201d (it aired in over 166 countries worldwide) and were also present at the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards, where they presented an award to recipients.\n\nSeyi Shay later scored a recording deal with Sony and has continued to move from one level of success to another. Her return to Nigeria to pursue her music career was inspired by Nigerian rapper and singer Sound Sultan, who she met in London in 2011. After listening to her demos, Sultan convinced her to relocate to Nigeria and pursue her musical career. Under Cecil Hammond\u2019s record label Fly time Music, Seyi was able to launch her solo career in Nigeria and promote her brand. The superstar\u2019s debut album \u201cSeyi or Shay\u201d was released in 2015, while her second studio album titled: \u201cElectric Package\u201d followed in 2018.\n\nSeyi Shay\u2019s most famous hits include: Loving Your Way\n\nNo Le Le\n\nIrawo\n\nIrawo (Remix) ft Vector\n\nChante ft Ajuju\n\nRight Now\n\nAlele, ft DJ Consequence and Flavour N\u2019abania\n\nKo Ma Roll ft Harmonize\n\nSurrender ft Kizz Daniel\n\nAir brush\n\nPack and Go ft Olamide\n\nYour Matter ft Eugy ft Efosa\n\nWeekend Vibes Remix ft Sarkodie\n\nYolo Yolo\n\nGimme Love ft Runtown\n\nKilin Me Softly ft Timaya\n\nChairman ft Kcee\n\nRagga Ragga\n\nMurda ft Patoranking and Shaydee\n\nHer Awards and Recognitions\n\nIn addition to gaining a huge fan base, Seyi Shay has also received awards for a job well done in most of his hit songs. Her name was first listed for an award in 2013 when her song \u2018Irawo\u2019 was nominated for the \u2018Best Vocal Performance (Female)\u2019 award category at the year\u2019s Headies. While she lost it to Nikki Laoye\u2019s \u201cOnly You,\u201d Shay received her first award at the City People Entertainment Awards for the \u2018Best New Musician of the Year (Female)\u2019 category. Her next and latest award won was at the 2019 Headies, where she received the award for the \u2018Best R&B Single\u2019 category for her song \u201cGimme Love,\u201d which was released in 2018.\n\nA complete list of awards Seyi Shay has won so far include\n\n2013 City People Entertainment Awards for \u2018Best New Musician of the Year (Female)\u2019 category\n\nThe Headies (2019) awards for \u2018Best R&B Single\u2019 category\n\nHow Seyi Shay Accrued Her $4.5 Million Net Worth\n\nSold-out tours, hit songs, endorsement deals, concerts, enviable accolades, huge fan base, and global achievements are some of the ranking factors of the best in the music industry. Though not the richest compared to Tiwa Savage, Yemi Alade, and Omawumi, Seyi Shay is definitely one of the richest female artists in the Nigerian music world.\n\nShe could be rated as one of the top five of the most successful female artists in the country, thanks to her talents and hard work. Seyi is one woman with many talents \u2013 she sings, writes, and records songs, but beyond that, she has garnered much income from various other channels. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the ways Shay was able to gain her financial stance.\n\nHer Music Career\n\nEver since Seyi Shay broke into stardom with her talent, she has been in the spotlight for outstanding performance on stage and collaborating with several big artists like Michelle Williams, Justin Timberlake, Rob Knoxx, Brian Michael Cox, and many others. According to several websites, she makes her highest income from her music career. Musicians like Seyi Shay make money from royalties, advances, playing live, selling merchandise, and licensing fees for their music.\n\nAlthough the exact amount she made from selling thousands of her records while also performing at numerous shows, tours, and events across the globe is unknown, it is quite clear that the Afropop star has left no stone unturned in ensuring those areas are covered. Her biggest performances include the Darey Art Alade\u2019s Love Like A Movie concert held on 15 February 2014, the 2013 COSON song awards, and one of Big Brother Africa 8\u2019s live eviction shows.\n\nShay\u2019s record label signings with Island Records and the universal music publishing group were six-figure deals that surely lined her pocket with a few more millions. One of her hit songs, Yolo Yolo, has garnered over a million views, translating to thousands of dollars for her. The music video was also nominated at the 12th edition of The Headies for Best Music Video, and it became Bailey\u2019s commercial soundtrack for the West and Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nEndorsement Deals\n\nLike most other music stars, Seyi Shay earned part of her net worth from side gigs, including brand endorsements. One of her earliest deals was signed in 2013, with telecommunications service provider Etisalat, now known as 9Mobile. In 2015, the \u2018Right Now\u2019 crooner joined music stars, Wizkid and Tiwa Savage as ambassadors for the world-class beverage company Pepsi. This came after she signed a 2-year contract with the company. In 2017, she bagged an endorsement deal with Gionee, another telecommunications company.\n\nHere is a complete list of Endorsement deals Seyi Shay has signed so far: Pepsi\n\nGionee\n\nEtisalat(9mobile)\n\nBarcadi freezer\n\nShe Also makes Money From Acting Gigs\n\nSeyi Shey added acting to her career list after playing a role in Urenna Ukiwe\u2019s 2018 drama film, Lara and the Beat. The 137 minutes film, which talks about two sisters, Lara Giwa and Dara Giwa, who were stripped of their wealth due to a financial scandal that ruins their father\u2019s empire, has Shay playing Lara Giwa.\n\nShe shared the screen with Saheed Balogun, DJ Xclusive, Uche Jombo, Chioma Chukwuka, and Chinedu Ikedieze. The drama premiered on July 8, 2018, and grossed up to N31 million at the box office. This is her first lead role in a Nollywood film. It is not known if she has made further appearances to date.\n\nSeyi Shay is Currently Single\n\nThe Afropop singer is still in the market. In other words, she is not married yet but could do so sometime in the future. It is unknown to the media if she is secretly dating someone, but her fans are pretty sure she would show her man to the world someday. More so, Shay has no children of her own neither has she been in the news for getting married to a man previously."}, {"url": "https://www.musicinafrica.net/magazine/nigerian-entertainment-awards-full-list-winners", "page_content": "As with a number of other award ceremonies this year, Davido had been up against Wizkid in a number of categories.

No, she isn\u2019t, but she made headlines earlier this year for her comments about marriage.\n\nDuring a conversation with Seun Kuti and OAP Temi B on Simi's Stoopid Sessions show, she revealed that she would not mind if her husband had side chics.\n\nSeyi revealed that as long as her husband is not keeping just one woman, she would be fine. According to her, if he keeps just one woman, they may fall in love and that may put her relationship with him at risk. However, if he has multiple side chics, their relationship would be safe.\n\nShe said:\n\n\"This is gonna sound somehow and I hope that other women don't try and bash me for it but I will actually be cool with my man having chics. As long as they're chics, and not one. Because if he has one chick on the side, then it's more likely that he's gonna fall in love with that one chic but if he's got like chics outside and he's doing his thing but I'm number one clearly in every way,\"\n\nShe also revealed that she got engaged in 2019:\n\n\u201c I actually got engaged last year. People that knew, knew, right? I had my ring on and everything \u2013 people thought it was a fashion ring or something but it was actually an engagement ring \u2013 and then a few months later we broke up.\u201d\n\nExplaining the reasons why the relationship ended, she revealed:\n\n\u201cWe were already arguing about the whole wedding; there is a lot of stress when you are planning a wedding and I think somewhere in that all process, our relationship started to break down. Eventually, anyway, he was cheating on me and I found out because I walked in on the situation. I really wish I didn\u2019t have to. So, the reason I decided and agreed to get married to this person is that I have a certain opinion on marriage. I don\u2019t believe in the typical generalization of marriage. I don\u2019t believe in that whole western type of ceremony or marriage \u2013 It is much deeper than that. Marriage to me is a bit more spiritual. It is much deeper than that. There is a type of glory that marriage gives you and your relationship as a woman or man and that is beyond the contract or the things you say to each other or the number of people in the ceremony.\u201d\n\nSeyi Shay quotes\n\nHere are some of her famous quotes\n\n\u201cEven if you don\u2019t realize it, you are always moving forward and evolving.
