Here, he exudes the same quiet menace that he brought to films like \"Insomnia\" and \"One Hour Photo\" as Merritt Rook, an aerospace engineer who impersonates a police officer and orders a fast-food manager to molest an employee. At the trial, Merritt represents himself and uses the case to put forth a philosophy of social disobedience that wins him a lot of public support. However, this isn't the first time he's used his powers of persuasion to violent ends, and soon Benson and Stabler learn that his need to teach people a lesson is really a need for others to feel the same pain that he does.\n\nWilliams was arguably the biggest guest star in \"Special Victims Unit\" history, and the role won him the seventh Emmy nomination of his career. It also wasn't the first time that the \"Aladdin\" and \"Good Will Hunting\" star had appeared somewhat unexpectedly on an NBC crime drama. In 1994 he had earned another Emmy nomination for a particularly poignant episode of \"Homicide: Life on the Street.\" Williams would make a few more random television appearances in the years after \"Authority,\" most notably playing himself in an episode of \"Louie\" and an episode of \"Spongebob SquarePants.\" In 2013 he starred in the one-season David E. Kelley dramedy \"The Crazy Ones,\" his first regular starring role on television since the end of \"Mork & Mindy\" in 1982.

Requiring a constant flow of suspects, victims, cops, and other auxiliary characters, many an actor can find paying work within the \"Law & Order\" universe, and it's only natural that a few of these actors go on to have their big breaks elsewhere.\n\nThat's more or less the case with Adam Driver, who made an appearance in the show before nabbing high-profile roles in films like \"Frances Ha\" and \"Inside Llewyn Davis,\" and well before his debut in the \"Star Wars\" universe in 2015 as Ben Solo, also known as Kylo Ren. For this reason, many fans might not even remember the time he appeared in an episode of \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" in 2012.\n\nDriver wasn't the household name he went on to become when he acted in the well-known crime procedural, but he nevertheless manages to make the role memorable \u2014 even if it's unlikely anyone watching it at the time would've guessed he'd be an international movie star in just a few short years."}, {"url": "https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/celebrities-you-forgot-were-on-law-order-svu", "page_content": "From Alec Baldwin and Robin Williams to Pedro Pascal and Adam Driver, who did you miss out on seeing?\n\nHow to Watch Watch Law & Order: Special Victims Unit on NBC and Peacock.\n\nOne of the best parts of watching Law & Order: Special Victims Unit can be the many familiar faces you\u2019re likely to see\u2014as well as those actors who go on to great things after being on set. And while a bona fide celebrity is always a sign of high drama on the horizon for the detectives of the SVU, many once-unknown actors have gotten the opportunity to show their mettle as villains, special victims, witnesses or investigators on the long-running show.\n\nWith over 500 episodes under its belt, hundreds of actors have appeared on SVU, many of whom are unforgettable. Let's look back on some of the celebrities you might not recall seeing on the SVU set.\n\nPedro Pascal\n\nSeason 12, Episode 24 (\"Smoked\"), 2011\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nBefore our favorite Mandalorian and Game of Thrones star rose to fame, Pascal was a three-time Law & Order franchise veteran, guest-starring in the original series, Law & Order: Criminal Intent and in SVU.\n\nOn SVU, he depicted corrupt ATF Special Agent Greer in the Season 12 finale, delivering a flawless performance.\n\nSnoop Dogg\n\nSeason 20, Episode 22 (\"Diss\"), 2019\n\nPhoto: NBC\n\nSnoop Dogg depicted R.B Banks, a recording artist who got wrapped into a predicament involving a rival rapper and an assault case.\n\nMartha Stewart\n\nSeason 13, Episode 21 (\"Learning Curve\"), 2012\n\nPhoto: NBC\n\nStewart shone in her SVU performance as Eleanor Hastings, a private school headmistress who defended one of her school teachers accused of sexually abusing a student.\n\nRobin Williams\n\nSeason 9, Episode 17 (\"Authority\"), 2008\n\nPhoto: NBC\n\nOne of the most bone-chilling episodes was thanks to the late guest star, comedy king turned horrifying SVU villain, Williams. Williams portrayed Merritt Rook, an audio engineer who had a problem with authority and a habit of impersonating the police. His performance was chilling as he tortured Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni) and coerced his victims into committing atrocious acts.\n\nAdam Driver\n\nSeason 13, Episode 11 (\"Theatre Tricks\"), 2012\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nWhile many might now recognize Driver as Kylo Ren in the Star Wars franchise, he also had the honor of depicting a slimy stalker named Jason Roberts who sexually assaulted a woman under the guise of it being an interactive theatrical stunt.\n\nIn 2010, Driver made an appearance on Law & Order in Season 20, Episode 15 (\u201cBrilliant Disguise\u201d) as Robby Vickery, an escort-hiring researcher whose co-worker killed his \u201cdate\u201d in an armed robbery.\n\nAlec Baldwin\n\nSeason 15, Episode 18 (\"Criminal Stories\"), 2014\n\nPhoto: NBC\n\nBaldwin made his SVU debut as Jimmy MacArthur, a hot-shop news reporter who caused issues for the SVU while they addressed a hate crime\n\nThe 30 Rock star also wrote \"Tabloid\" (Season 8, Episode 23, 1998) for the original Law & Order, based on his negative experiences with the press.\n\nSerena Williams\n\nSeason 5, Episode 12 (\"Brotherhood\"), 2004\n\nPhoto: NBC\n\nTennis star Williams starred as Chloe Spiers, a college basketball star who became the revenge porn victim of a malicious fraternity pledge master.

They ultimately discovered that Anne, \u201ca psychopath with extremely violent tendencies,\u201d murdered both to keep them from cutting her out of their will and then took out hits on Benson and a British detective who assisted in her capture.\n\nHowever, her first on-screen acting gig was on the original Law & Order in 1994, portraying Maggie Conner in Season 5, Episode 4 (\u201cFamily Values\u201d). Conner was put on trial for the murder of her mother, only to confess that her stepfather initiated a sexual relationship with her and accidentally killed her mother when she found out about it. They used pictures from the 1994 appearance in her 2010 show.\n\nMartin Short\n\nSeason 6, Episode 18 (\"Pure\"), 2005\n\nPhoto: NBC\n\nThe Emmy-award Short portrayed \u201cpsychic\u201d Sebastian Ballentine on SVU.

The new corporate lawyer turned a very public scandal involving her politician husband, Peter (Chris Noth), into positive personal and professional growth. Multi-layered, nuanced characters make \"The Good Wife\" far more than just another legal procedural, and fans root for Alicia's triumph. However, by the end of Season 7, \"The Good Wife\" thematically showcased the corruption and greed behind the pursuit of power. Systemic corruption seeped through storylines and Alicia Florrick became more of an antihero than a straightforward heroine.\n\nThe show also spawned a solid spin-off series, \"The Good Fight,\" which centered on Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski), and ran for six seasons. The show's creators, Michelle and Robert King (who also created the critically-acclaimed supernatural drama, \"Evil\"), spoke to NPR about the ways in which the show imitated real life. \"Every other week or every other month there was this poor woman standing by her disgraced husband and it was just this kind of nightmarish scene where the wife did nothing wrong, but was kind of dragged up there as a prop,\" Robert King said. \"The Good Wife\" explores the dimensions behind the scandalized headline spouses.\n\nThe series showcased many talented A-list actors, including Michael J. Fox and Kristen Chenoweth, and received a staggering 43 Emmy nominations while taking home five awards. Let's look at what some cast members are up to now."}, {"url": "https://www.vulture.com/2016/05/the-good-wife-lost-characters.html", "page_content": "Photo: CBS\n\nWhen The Good Wife ends its seven-season run this Sunday, it\u2019ll leave behind a strong legacy as a great legal drama, as a network show that thrived in the era of prestige TV. But as is the case with its sprawling 22-episode-per-season format, The Good Wife also leaves behind more than a few loose ends. And whether the actors left because of scheduling conflicts, or the writers\u2019 ambitions were too big for the constraints of network TV production, The Good Wife\u2019s Chicago also is littered with characters who were once crucial to the show, but now have fallen to the wayside. Where are they now? We\u2019re glad you asked. This is our best guess.\n\nA few ground rules: This list is limited to characters who were on the series for at least four episodes (with a few exceptions), and whose presence on the show was in some way integral to the plot. This is, of course, a value judgment, but for the most part, we left out characters who merely serve as judges or opposition in the courtroom. Also out: Characters who returned in season seven \u2014 Zach Woods\u2019s ersatz Snowden is now happily in Canada \u2014 and anyone who is confirmed dead. Whether or not Josh Charles comes back in the finale, Will Gardner will not spring from the grave.\n\nDerrick Bond (Michael Ealy)\n\nWho he was: The head of Bond & Associates, which merges with Lockhart/Gardner early in season two. Derrick, an old friend of Will\u2019s, tries to stage a takeover.\n\nLast seen: Season 2, Episode 16, \u201cGreat Firewall\u201d\n\nWhere he is now: After being forced out by Will and Diane, Derrick returns to his old firm in Baltimore, where he has a very lucrative, not-quite-legal trade in maritime law.\n\nBlake Calamar (Scott Porter)\n\nWho he was: Bond\u2019s own private investigator, who gets competitive with Kalinda, and becomes a frequent victim to her \u201cHold Up\u201d-style baseball bat attacks.\n\nLast seen: Season 2, Episode 18, \u201cKiller Song\u201d\n\nWhere he is now: Blake peaces out once he reveals that Kalinda changed her name, but one assumes that he\u2019s gone into hiding in a small town in Texas. He coaches football, because a) he is Jason Street, and b) he\u2019s still afraid of baseball bats.\n\nGlenn Childs (Titus Welliver)\n\nWho he was: Peter Florrick\u2019s rival for the position of Cook County State\u2019s Attorney, who released the sex tape of Peter and a prostitute, and kickstarted the Good Wife to begin with. Glenn runs against Florrick in season two, until Eli digs up dirt on his nanny and forces him out of the race.\n\nLast seen: Season 3, Episode 7, \u201cExecutive Order 13224\u201d\n\nWhere he is now: Glenn pops up as an ASA in season three, but that doesn\u2019t last long. Instead, having learned the value of having dirt on other people, Glenn starts the Chicago version of TMZ, which reports on dirty politics and the local improv scene. It\u2019s not very successful.\n\nLaura Hellinger (Amanda Peet)\n\nWho she was: A former military lawyer turned prosecutor in the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office. She has a whole lotta chemistry with Will Gardner, so of course she had to go.\n\nLast seen: Season 4, Episode 19, \u201cThe Wheels of Justice\u201d\n\nWhere she is now: Laura is happy with her ex from the military. They live near D.C. now, somewhere in the suburbs. When she hears about Will\u2019s death, she sends Alicia flowers. Alicia burns them.\n\nWendy Scott-Carr (Anika Noni Rose)\n\nWho she was: One of The Good Wife\u2019s best villains, Wendy Scott-Carr spends most of her time hatching plans to take down Peter from inside the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office. She even tries to attack Will to get to him. It\u2019s wonderful!\n\nLast seen: Season 4, Episode 11, \u201cBoom De Yah Da\u201d\n\nWhere she is now: Peter fires Wendy back in season three, but she returns with a vengeance in season four, until Kyle MacLachlan\u2019s Department of Justice investigator takes over the case. (What gives?) Wendy Scott-Carr now lives in New York, where she is very successful. Every time she reads a headline about the Florricks she laughs a loud but rueful laugh.\n\nMaddie Hayward (Maura Tierney)\n\nWho she was: A rival to Peter in the gubernatorial race, and a sometime friend to Alicia, until Alicia realizes, \u201cThey\u2019re always wondering, can men and women really be friends, but the real question is, can women?\u201d Oh well, things worked out better for Margulies and Tierney on ER.\n\nLast seen: Season 4, Episode 15, \u201cGoing for the Gold\u201d\n\nWhere she is now: A successful businesswoman, Maddie goes on to make millions from her self-help book Women Who Support Other Women. She is a major donor to the Hillary campaign.\n\nMike Kresteva (Matthew Perry)\n\nWho he was: Another combatant in the Republican race, Mike is Peter\u2019s sneaky, sarcastic Republican rival \u2013 like Chandler in politician form.\n\nLast seen: Season 4, Episode 18, \u201cDeath of a Client\u201d\n\nWhere he is now: Given the fact that Mike\u2019s willing to piss off just about anyone to win, he\u2019s a big Ted Cruz supporter now. (Note: Perry only appeared in 3 episodes, but he\u2019s credited in four, so we\u2019re counting the character.)\n\nPatti Nyholm (Martha Plimpton)\n\nWho she was: A frequent rival in the courtroom, the amoral Patti uses her pregnancy \u2014 and, later, her two babies \u2014 to win sympathy from judges. (Patti\u2019s technically less involved in the plot and more like a judge, but Martha Plimpton won a Guest Actress Emmy for the role, so we\u2019re including her.)\n\nLast seen: Season 4, Episode 22, \u201cWhat\u2019s in the Box?\u201d\n\nWhere she is now: Patti has three more children. She pays for private school by defending only the worst, and wealthiest, companies possible.\n\nNatalie Flores (America Ferrera)\n\nWho she was: An undocumented immigrant who worked as Wendy Scott-Carr\u2019s nanny for several years. She becomes a love interest for Eli Gold, and later comes back to help out on a case.\n\nLast seen: Season 5, Episode 8, \u201cThe Next Month\u201d\n\nWhere she is now: Natalie gets a job in D.C. thanks to her skills as a translator, working for Hillary Clinton \u2013 it\u2019s (almost) canon!\n\nBecca (Dreama Walker)\n\nWho she was: Zach Florrick\u2019s devious ex-girlfriend who once spread rumors about the Florricks on social media. She comes back in season two for a convoluted abortion plot, and again in season five to steal Peter\u2019s gavel \u2014 who knows why exactly, it\u2019s a strange little caper.\n\nLast seen: Season 5, Episode 2, \u201cThe Bit Bucket\u201d\n\nWhere she is now: Living in New York, continuing to wreak havoc \u2014 basically, the same thing that happens in Don\u2019t Trust the B in Apartment 23, but with Dreama Walker as the B.\n\nDamian Boyle (Jason O\u2019Mara)\n\nWho he was: A shady lawyer with a connection to the mob, who tries to pull off a power grab in Florrick Agos, and then is ousted when Kalinda discovers evidence against him.\n\nLast seen: Season 5, Episode 17, \u201cA Material World\u201d\n\nWhere he is now: Series creators Robert and Michelle King have actually spoken on Boyle\u2019s future, telling the New York Times: \u201cWhat was supposed to happen was that when Will died, he was someone who really stepped up.\u201d Instead, Matthew Goode\u2019s Finn Polmar slid into the Will Gardner\u2013replacement spot. Damian Boyle, deprived of his chance to become a better man, bops along in his career as a shady lawyer.\n\nClarke Hayden (Nathan Lane)\n\nWho he was: A trustee appointed to watch over Lockhart/Gardner as they struggle to pay their debts.\n\nLast seen: Season 5, Episode 22, \u201cA Weird Year\u201d\n\nWhere he is now: Still an accountant turned lawyer, still mad at people for mismanaging their finances.\n\nRobyn Burdine (Jess Weixler)\n\nWho she was: A private investigator. She starts off as a mess, but quickly proves that she\u2019s (almost) as good as Kalinda.\n\nLast seen: Season 6, Episode 2, \u201cTrust Issues\u201d\n\nWhere she is now: Still employed at the firm, according to the Kings and Weixler herself.\n\nDean Levine-Wilkins (Taye Diggs)\n\nWho he was: A charming lawyer who transfers in from New York and then summarily disappears. (Diggs was only on for three episodes, but we\u2019re bending the rules. He was introduced as a key character, and we\u2019re still mad.)\n\nLast seen: Season 6, Episode 5, \u201cShiny Objects\u201d\n\nWhere he is now: Still working at the firm, according to the Kings. Let\u2019s hope it didn\u2019t last, and he and Robyn left to New York to start a practice of their own.\n\nJosh Perotti (Kyle MacLachlan)\n\nWho he was: An AUSA who goes after Eli Gold, and develops a weird fascination with Carrie Preston\u2019s Elsbeth Tascioni in the process.\n\nLast seen: Season 6, Episode 6, \u201cOld Spice\u201d\n\nWhere he is now: Still working for the Department of Justice. Still harassing the heck out of women. There is no justice.\n\nLana Delaney (Jill Flint)\n\nWho she was: An FBI agent who investigates, and then gets into a relationship with, Kalinda.\n\nLast seen: Season 6, Episode 9, \u201cSticky Content\u201d\n\nWhere she is now: After leaking information about a wiretap on Lemond Bishop, Lana finds her position at the FBI in jeopardy. We don\u2019t see her on the show again, but let\u2019s assume Lana escapes to Canada, where she starts an alt-rock band and writes songs about loving girls who really love Cary Agos.\n\nColin Sweeney (Dylan Baker)\n\nWho he was: A Robert Durst analogue who\u2019s been accused of killing his wife. He\u2019s also really rich and obsessed with getting Alicia Florrick to represent him.\n\nLast seen: Season 6, Episode 13, \u201cDark Money\u201d\n\nWhere he is now: Doing an HBO documentary about his alleged crimes, during which he accidentally admits to those crimes.\n\nMandy Post (Miriam Shor)\n\nWho she was: A reporter who claims she has evidence that Peter Florrick had another affair. She replaced Kristin Chenoweth in nearly the same role after Chenoweth stepped out due to a head injury after doing only one episode.\n\nLast seen: Season 6, Episode 16, \u201cRed Meat\u201d\n\nWhere she is now: Both Mandy and Chenoweth\u2019s Peggy Byrne now run a news start-up covering political gossip. They get most of their scoops from Glenn Childs, and they usually aren\u2019t right.\n\nJulius Cain (Michael Boatman)\n\nWho he was: The head of litigation at Lockhart/Gardner (and later Florrick, Agos, & Lee). He moves to the New York office, and then the New York office gets shut down.\n\nLast seen: Season 6, Episode 17, \u201cUndisclosed Recipients\u201d\n\nWhere he is now: Still at the firm, presumably. Still sending people very angry emails. Possibly off working with Taye Diggs in the land of The Good Wife\u2019s forgotten people of color.\n\nLemond Bishop (Mike Colter)\n\nWho he was: A drug lord who gets Lockhart/Gardner to represent his \u201clegitimate\u201d interests. He comes in and out of the show, but makes a big stink in season six as he tries to take control of Kalinda.\n\nLast seen: Season 6, Episode 20, \u201cThe Deconstruction\u201d\n\nWhere he is now: After being arrested at the end of season six, he\u2019s probably just running his drug ring from jail.\n\nFinn Polmar (Matthew Goode)\n\nWho he was: A fellow lawyer caught up in the Will Gardner shooting who eventually becomes a love interest for Alicia.\n\nLast seen: Season 6, Episode 22, \u201cWanna Partner?\u201d\n\nWhere he is now: He turns down Alicia\u2019s offer to partner, as he\u2019s trying to make things right with his ex-wife. He\u2019s off in Italy, drinking nearly as much wine as Alicia does back home.\n\nKalinda Sharma (Archie Panjabi)\n\nWho she was: The firm\u2019s lead investigator, friend to Alicia, general badass.\n\nLast seen: Season 6, Episode 22, \u201cWanna Partner?\u201d\n\nWhere she is now: At the end of season six, Kalinda went into hiding from Lemond Bishop, staying only for a few drinks with Alicia, which were shot on a green screen. This has led to a bunch of speculation about whether there is any enmity between Panjabi and her co-star \u2014 Margulies has denied this, repeatedly. But more importantly, where is Kalinda? Working for a new firm? Working in Belfast with Gillian Anderson? My money\u2019s on a crime ring of her own, but as with anything surrounding Kalinda, it\u2019s impossible to be certain."}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/archives/blogs/show-tracker/story/2011-10-24/the-good-wife-recap-who-you-callin-caitlin", "page_content": "This article was originally on a blog post platform and may be missing photos, graphics or links. See About archive blog posts.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t a wasted moment in this episode of \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d easily the best of the so-far uneven third season. The writing in \u201cMarthas and Caitlins\u201d was dazzlingly efficient: There were significant developments to virtually every subplot in the series, plus an interesting case of the week. Until this episode, it was unclear if the Kings had figured out a long-term narrative strategy for this season, but nearly every scene in \u2018Marthas and Caitlins\u2019 set the stage for future conflict. It was all so well done that I didn\u2019t even mind having Celeste back.\n\n\u201cThe Good Wife\u201d tends to cram a lot of narrative switchbacks into its extended opening act, and this might have been the most jam-packed one to date. Within the first minute or so of the episode, a whistleblower testifying against an aerospace company kills himself. The backup plan is to use his videotaped deposition in lieu of testimony, but the judge won\u2019t allow it. In a convenient twist, it turns out Colin Sweeney, everyone\u2019s favorite wife killer/venture capitalist was advising the aerospace company on its IPO and was blind-copied on emails regarding the faulty plane, and Alicia has the unenviable task of convincing him to testify in the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile all this is unfolding, the writers toss several more balls into the air: Will and David ask Alicia to hire a new first-year associate; Will warns Alicia not to let Celeste get under her skin; David advises Alicia on her divorce; Alicia and Peter discuss Grace\u2019s eccentric tutor; and Eli asks Kalinda to dig up some dirt on Adam Spellman, a businessman who\u2019s being groomed to give the coveted keynote address at the 2012 Democratic convention. In less than 10 minutes of airtime, the show deftly weaves together no fewer than six separate story lines, and does so without seeming jumbled or overstuffed. Folks, this is how you write good television.\n\nI confess that I was anxious about the return of Colin Sweeney, a character that \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d writers seem to love but whom I\u2019ve always found too self-consciously derivative \u2014 and even a little kitschy \u2014 for a show that otherwise strives for a certain level of realism. But this time around, the Sweeney excesses were kept in check. Yes, it was predictable that he wasn\u2019t going to cooperate with the testimony unless there was something to be gained from it. But the scene where Sweeney, wearing a wire, gets his neo-Nazi pal to confess to orchestrating a murder on the outside, was totally riveting. The staging of the scene was also pretty great: Alicia, Cary and Imani watch the action in the courtyard via grainy surveillance footage that somehow made the whole interaction more menacing.\n\nThe Sweeney subplot also brought Peter and Cary back into the fold in an organic way. Alicia has to negotiate Sweeney\u2019s release with Cary, who in turn has to get approval from Imani. At the same time, Peter is committed to eliminating corruption in the state\u2019s prisons, but he\u2019s also worried about letting an infamous murderer (correction: manslaughter-er) out of jail. Peter warns Eli that he\u2019s going to be in the news in the coming days, which makes me certain this will not be the last we hear of Sweeney\u2019s release. Will he strike again and become Peter\u2019s Willie Horton? And is it wrong that I\u2019m pretty excited by this possibility?\n\nEli continues to plot the next phase in Peter\u2019s political career. He wants Peter to give the keynote address at the 2012 Democratic convention \u2014 the spot that went to a then-obscure Illinois state senator named Barack Obama in 2004. The party establishment has already tapped Adam Spellman, a successful black businessman, to give the speech. At Eli\u2019s behest, Kalinda does some digging and finds that Spellman\u2019s wife, a devout Baptist, contributed money to support the Defense of Marriage Act. Eli asks Kalinda to do some more investigating, but she declines once she finds out that Eli\u2019s working on behalf of Peter. Naturally, this piques Eli\u2019s suspicions.\n\nWith Spellman effectively disqualified, Eli meets with Democratic strategist Donna Brazile to make the case for Peter. She likes his story, but she\u2019s concerned about the rumors about his marriage (in the bizarre world of American politics, patronizing prostitutes is forgivable, divorce is not). It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve had a political cameo on \u2018The Good Wife.\u201d Brazile\u2019s appearance was pretty fun \u2014 even if she\u2019s not going to win any Emmys for her performance. It seems obvious that Eli is going to scheme to get Alicia and Peter back together somehow. \u201cWe should talk some time \u2026 about the future,\u201d he tells Alicia ominously.\n\nAs for Alicia\u2019s future, it\u2019s impossible to know what it might entail. I was excited \u2014 if that\u2019s the right word \u2014 that David and Alicia met to discuss her divorce. He seems like exactly the kind of attorney you\u2019d want in that situation: discreet, unsentimental, realistic. He and Alicia are hardly buddies, but he is, by default, Alicia\u2019s only real confidant. That\u2019s why it\u2019s doubly humiliating when David lashes out at Alicia for not wanting to hire his niece, Caitlin (played by Anna Camp, one of two \u201cMad Men\u201d cast members who appeared in this episode). \u201cYou were given this task because you are unimportant and you can take a hint,\u201d he says. Way harsh, bro.\n\nOf course, Alicia wants to hire Martha, a brunet who likes French New Wave movies and moot court, instead of Caitlin, a blond who\u2019s into \u201ctrampboarding.\u201d (Just wondering: Does \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d keep some kind of youth-culture consultant on retainer?) In the end, the hiring committee overrules her and Caitlin gets the job. Alicia confronts Will about the vote and learns that he voted to hire Caitlin. His explanation? He owes David a favor because \u201cthere was a Martha\u201d \u2014 in other words, a more favorable candidate \u2014 when they hired Alicia. \u201cCaitlins often surprise you,\u201d he says. At first, Alicia seems moved by the confession, but as she walks away from Will\u2019s office, you can see the doubt washing over her face. Did Will really owe David a favor, or was he just trying to stay in David\u2019s good graces?\n\nDavid\u2019s showdown with Alicia has at least one unintended consequence: She ends up bonding with Celeste. When David barges in, Celeste and Alicia are in the middle of a tense conversation about Will. Celeste calls their relationship \u201cvery vanilla\u201d (if only she knew what we know \u2026) and Alicia fires back by accusing Celeste of being stuck in the past. Alicia is obviously annoyed by Celeste, but you also get the sense she\u2019s desperate for Celeste to spill the beans on Will. So when they go out for drinks, it\u2019s not quite as surprising as it might have been.\n\nThis might have been my favorite scene of the episode, and not just because I always like seeing Alicia getting a little tipsy. (Our girl really loves her tequila, doesn\u2019t she?) It was also nice to see a more human, slightly less crazy side of Celeste \u2014 though with her, it\u2019s all relative. Celeste says she wants to break up Will and Alicia, and all she needs to do to make this happen is to tell Alicia about his past. \u201cWill is like me. He\u2019ll always disappoint you,\u201d she warns. It\u2019s a great scene because it\u2019s impossible to know exactly how to read Celeste, and you can almost hear Alicia wondering to herself: Is she jealous? Genuinely concerned for a fellow female? A bit of both? Alicia doesn\u2019t know the answer, but her willingness to endure Celeste\u2019s craziness suggests she\u2019d really, really like to find out.\n\nStray thoughts:\n\n\u2014 I love that David can\u2019t use \u201cthe Cull divorce\u201d as a safe word with Alicia because now he\u2019s actually working on a Cull divorce.\n\n\u2014 It was also mice to see Geneva back this week, though did you think maybe she was a little jealous of Imani and Cary?\n\n\u2014 The tutor subplot is still not working for me. I understand why it\u2019s there (Alicia always has to have some domestic fires to put out), but still, it\u2019s just \u2026 off.\n\n\u2014 It\u2019s always nice to see Aaron Staton (a.k.a. Ken Cosgrove), but I wish he had a little more to do.\n\n\u2014 Assuming Will isn\u2019t fibbing, I wonder who was the Martha to Alicia\u2019s Caitlin?\n\nRELATED:\n\n\u2018The Good Wife\u2019 recap: Those 3 little words\n\n\u2018The Good Wife\u2019 recap: Processed cheese\n\n\u2018The Good Wife\u2019 recap: Love is like oxygen\n\n\u2014 Meredith Blake\n\ntwitter.com/MeredithBlake"}, {"url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/pictures/the-good-wife-cast-where-are-they-now/", "page_content": "Lockhart Gardner: Attorneys at Law.

Sure, it had an intriguing premise \u2014 the wife of a disgraced politician returns to work following her husband\u2019s scandal \u2014 and an impressive cast led by Emmy winners Julianna Margulies and Christine Baranski, but it appeared to be another legal case-of-the-week drama just wrapped in more prestigious packaging. However, the series quickly proved to be anything but.\n\nThe Good Wife showed early on that it wasn\u2019t afraid to shake things up and irreversibly alter the DNA of the show with twists like the revelation about Kalinda\u2019s rendezvous with Peter or Will\u2019s death. The result? Seven seasons in and it looks very different from how it started. Ahead of the acclaimed series\u2019 May 8 curtain call, The Hollywood Reporter looks back at the moments that changed the show forever.\n\n1. Alicia Kisses Will \u2026 and Sleeps With Peter\n\nFacebook\u2019s \u201cit\u2019s complicated\u201d option wasn\u2019t just made for non-committal twentysomethings. In its freshman season, The Good Wife proved it wasn\u2019t afraid to portray a messy marriage on TV. Up until then, the question had been solely whether Alicia (Margulies) would or would not stay with her husband. And also, whether Alicia should or should not hook up with her law school love-turned-boss Will Gardner (Josh Charles). The show predictably played up its central triangle by having Alicia and Will kiss (finally!), but few could have predicted the guilt-stricken (and possibly horny?) protagonist then running home and screwing her estranged husband in the guest room. Several years later, Alicia and Peter (Chris Noth) are still technically married, but their hot-and-cold marriage has become one of the most complex, and realistic, on television.\n\n2. Cary Loses the Bake-Off\n\nStern, Lockhart & Gardner\u2019s two junior associates spent nearly the entire first season competing with each other to win a permanent spot on the payroll. Although Cary (Matt Czuchry) initially came off as little too ruthless and cunning, audiences quickly warmed up to the well-connected Harvard grad thanks to his numerous, and originally fruitless, attempts to win over Kalinda (Archie Panjabi); not to mention that one time he got high before getting unexpectedly called into a late-night murder case. Most cookie-cutter network shows would have cheated by finding a way for both to get permanent gigs at the firm, but instead the drama took the road less traveled and sent Cary packing. Even more shocking, the show found a great way to keep series regular Czuchry in the fold working for the opposition in the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office, first for Glenn Childs (Titus Welliver) and then for Peter.\n\n3. Alicia Discovers Kalinda Slept With Peter\n\nPeople may have come for the relationship drama, but many stayed for the friendship between Alicia and the firm\u2019s mysterious investigator, Kalinda. Their honest conversations, frequently over tequila shots, quickly became a cornerstone of the series, which is why when it was revealed that Kalinda had slept with Alicia\u2019s husband years earlier, and then Alicia found about it, it seemed nearly impossible to come back from. The storyline provided plenty of drama \u2014 Alicia\u2019s angry confrontation, Kalinda\u2019s teary elevator breakdown \u2014 but their camaraderie was sorely missed. The writers briefly flirted with putting the two ex-BFFs back together in season three, before basically keeping the two as far apart as possible until Kalinda left Chicago for good at the end of season six. Thankfully, Alicia eventually found a new sidekick in Lucca and Kalinda grew close to Will, Diane (Baranski) and, finally, Cary, before she left.\n\n4. Alicia Leaves the Firm\n\nThe seed was planted in the final moments of season four when Cary showed up at Alicia\u2019s door \u2014 an especially cruel bait and switch for #TeamWill fans who were led to believe it was him paying a late-night visit. But after quietly laying the groundwork for their exodus early in season five, word leaked to their bosses and led to the single most tumultuous day in Lockhart/Gardner history. Diane fired Cary and Will trashed Alicia\u2019s office and had her escorted from the premises with two security guards. Although there have been many changes at the firm before and since, the result was possibly the series\u2019 best episode ever and reinvigorated the second half of season five that pitted the former lovers against one another. That is, until \u2026\n\n5. Will Dies\n\nWhat can be said that hasn\u2019t already? One minute, Will was defending the son of a wealthy client accused of murder (Hunter Parrish). The next, he was bleeding out on the floor of the courtroom after being shot by said client. Viewers didn\u2019t see Will actually get shot, but the image of his pale, lifeless body in the hospital emergency room was enough to send loyal fans into an emotional tailspin and led to the hashtag #TheGoodWifeSupportGroup. Even more shocking than the death itself were the lack of clues leading up to the fateful episode. The stunning realization that Alicia and Will would never end up together, and the enduring mystery about why he called her shortly before he was shot, loomed large over the drama\u2019s heroine and viewers all the way into the series\u2019 seventh and final season.\n\n6. Cary Goes to Jail\n\nAlicia\u2019s bakeoff rival turned firm partner traded in his Brioni for a jumpsuit when Cary was arrested in the opening moments of the season-six premiere and thrown in jail for allegedly aiding in the transportation of $1.3 million of heroin. The arrest was, naturally, a way for the state to try to get to Alicia and Cary\u2019s drug kingpin of a client, Lemond Bishop (Mike Colter), but Cary stayed loyal and had to suffer a nasty jail-room shakedown \u2014 which resulted in him stabbing his own hand \u2014 as well as a trial. Kalinda eventually helped get the charges dropped against Cary, but not without putting herself in hot water. She eventually had to leave town to escape the wrath of Bishop and his team.\n\n7. Alicia Runs for State\u2019s Attorney \u2026 and Is Forced to Resign\n\nConsidering her well-documented disdain for politics, it was a little \u2014 ok, very \u2014 disconcerting to see Alicia abandon the firm she and Cary had built from the ground up to step into the spotlight and run for office. But truly few could have predicted the role reversal to come at the end of season six when, after learning that voting machines had been tampered with in her favor, she was forced to step down days after winning. The image of a disgraced Alicia trying to hold back her tears in front of a swarm of press and photographers was eerily reminiscent of the pilot, except this time it was her giving the speech and grabbing her spouse\u2019s hand as she made a hasty exit. Once again, the twist not only made for a jaw-dropping moment, but held longstanding ramifications for Alicia, who was ultimately forced to start over again as a bond court attorney at the beginning of season seven.\n\n8. Kalinda Leaves Town for Good\n\nUnlike Charles\u2019 top-secret departure from the show, which was kept under tight wraps until the night his character was killed off, the writing had been on the wall for months for Panjabi. News first broke in November \u2014 a full six months before her curtain call \u2014 that she would leave the series at the end of her six-season contract. The reasoning behind Kalinda\u2019s exit was not that surprising: She fell out of drug kingpin Lemond Bishop\u2019s good graces to save her lover Cary and boss Diane. The big question mark was how the show would move on without the fan favorite. Producers were able to find two series regulars to fill Kalinda\u2019s boots of justice. One was another British breakout actress, Cush Jumbo, who played Alicia\u2019s bond court rival-turned-colleague Lucca Quinn. Like the early Kalinda years, Lucca was an important friend for Alicia, helping her deal with her midseason meltdown. As for an investigator with a dark past, that spot was taken by Jason Crouse (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), who also ended up filling the role of love interest long left unoccupied after Charles\u2019 onscreen death. (Matthew Goode\u2019s Finn Polmar never quite filled those shoes.)\n\n9. Peter Gets Arrested (Again)\n\nFor all the things that have changed over The Good Wife\u2019s seven-season stretch \u2014 see above \u2014 some have stayed exactly, alarmingly, the same. Sure, Peter tried to (appear to) become a better man by finding religion and moving back into their Highland Park family home. But he had a hard time resisting the dark side. Let\u2019s not forget that Will saw a member of Peter\u2019s team commit election fraud when he was up for governor at the end of season four. So it was only a matter of time before Peter\u2019s hand got caught in the cookie jar. The biggest shock? Seeing Saint Alicia swoop in and stand by his side once again despite her own growth. Will that remain the case if Peter is sent back to prison? There\u2019s only two episodes left to find out.\n\nThe Good Wife airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on CBS."}, {"url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/pictures/the-good-wife-cast-where-are-they-now/", "page_content": "Lockhart Gardner: Attorneys at Law.

My father was a Realtor in Calgary for almost 10 years before moving to Vancouver where he is currently a licensed agent. After only 6 months in the Real Estate industry, my mom had to quit her day job to become my dad\u2019s full time Assistant. I consider myself a Calgarian having lived here since 1989. Before moving to Calgary, we immigrated to Brandon Manitoba.\n\nI didn\u2019t know it then, but my training actually started in high school. Over dinner my parents would discuss real estate stories and news excessively. My dad had the most amazing stories, some I still tell my clients today. My meticulous father is one of the most competent, dutiful and loyal Agents I\u2019ve ever worked with. He truly put his clients first in business. I\u2019m proud to have him as my first mentor stepping into this industry.\n\nAlthough I officially launched my Real Estate career in 2005, I would say the seed of my passion for Real Estate was planted when I purchased my home in 2001. I was 21. Like most buyers, I made extensive sacrifices to buy my first home, including selling my first beloved motorcycle, and working 3 jobs simultaneously for a full year to save up. I couldn\u2019t sleep the night before my possession. I was giddy and excited, overdosed on Better Homes & Garden magazines (Pinterest did not exist in 2001). When my Agent/dad handed me the keys to my first house, the exhilaration I felt is a high a chase through my clients until this very day. When I hand my clients their keys for the first time, I feel the same giddiness and excitement for them. Every hurdle my clients have crossed to buy a home, all the hours spent scrutinizing properties with me by their side, all their dreams come into fruition in this very moment. Whether is a purchase or sale, it\u2019s a big deal. I take my job with all of it\u2019s giddiness seriously.\n\nPrior to obtaining my license to be Realtor, I was a bilingual assistant (ESL), server & bartender, entrepreneur with phone books (if you meet me, ask me about this hilarious 3 year period of my life), and a 3rd year university drop out \u2013 computer science major. I finally had to accept that hours in a lab working on assignments and programming was not me. I craved interaction and found I enjoyed my shifts at Red Lobster more than heading to lectures at the University. Oh and in 2012 I took most of that year off of full time Real Estate. I went back to College. This time Fairview College for my motorcycle mechanics certificate. After I finished, I was employed to work on motorcycles as a junior mechanic 4 days a week while working part time as a Real Estate Agent around those hours. I learned a lot from that experience but mostly my appreciation for my Real Estate career was solidified by the end of 2012.\n\nAt the end of 2012 I joined a mega team. Although I benefited from the success of consistently being one of the top producers on that team, and achieving multiple awards, I was missing something. Remember, I value interaction. Being that busy and closing that many deals in a year, the quality of relationship I had with my clients was not to my satisfaction. There\u2019s a difference between service and relationship. You can have the best of both with the right Agent.\n\nAs of January 1st 2017, I\u2019m a proud Realtor and Managing Partner of The Good Agent Inc. We are well aware of all the reasons people shy aware from Realtors \u2013 we are here to change that!\n\nIn June of 2017, from the help of my wonderful new found work/life balance I was able to achieve, I got married and started a family all at once. I now have one more skill to add to my list of Real Estate Agent skills \u2013 being able to see a home through practical mom eyes.

Red has wormed his way out of virtually every chaotic mess, and fans can\u2019t wait to see how he works his way out of the latest labyrinth.\n\nThe Blacklist is moving to Thursdays at 8/7c\n\nStarting Thursday, June 1, The Blacklist Season 10 will air on Thursdays at 8/7c on NBC and will be available later on Peacock.

Find highlights from The Blacklist\u2019s final season, below:\n\nNumerous former Blacklisters have a bone to pick with Red\n\nFor years, Red worked with the FBI\u2019s Reddington Task Force to track and apprehend Red\u2019s infamous \"blacklist\" of nefarious criminals. These investigations led to hundreds of successful arrests, but their operation became compromised after the events of Season 9 of The Blacklist, when Red\u2019s former lawyer revealed his role as an informant to Wujing (Chin Han), one of the first Blacklisters Red ever put behind bars.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nSeason 10 kicked off with Wujing on a revenge tour to find Red and prove his role as an FBI informant to other scorned members of The Blacklist. As a result, the Task Force has brushed shoulders with familiar faces like Dr. Perillos (Laverne Cox), The Freelancer (Daniel Sauli), Robert Vesco (Stacy Keach), and the Troll Farmer (Aaron Yoo). Wujing\u2019s army was only growing until Red managed to trap and kill him with the help of the Troll Farmer in Episode 9 (\"The Troll Farmer Pt. 2\u201d).\n\nSiya Malek has unveiled hidden secrets from her mother\u2019s past\n\nThe Reddington Task Force got a bit of a remix with the new addition of Siya Malek, an incredibly talented and driven MI-6 agent recruited in the Season 10 premiere. Siya has some personal ties to the Task Force, as her mother, Meera Malek, was killed during an operation for Red in the Season 1 finale of The Blacklist. Siya joins Cooper\u2019s Force to learn more about the confidential circumstances surrounding her mother\u2019s death, but what she unveils is far more shocking than what she anticipated.\n\nSiya Malik (Anya Banerjee) appears in a scene from The Blacklist Season 10 Episode 5. Photo: David Giesbrecht/NBC\n\nWhile looking at Meera\u2019s FBI file, Siya learns that she is adopted. Not only is she adopted, but the listed agency in Kolkata doesn\u2019t actually exist. Knowing he did his own background checks on Meera when she was recruited in Season 1, Siya has become closer to Red to try to learn more about her mother, and the shocking twists and turns just keep coming.\n\nReddington and Agnes are closer than ever\n\nDue to the numerous Blacklisters tracking him down, Red has been a rolling stone throughout Season 10 of The Blacklist, leading him to land on Cooper and Agnes Keen\u2019s doorstep a few times. As the daughter of the person Red loved most in this world, Red and Agnes have become quite close over time, with the preteen viewing the concierge of crime like a sweet grandfather. Cooper originally demanded that Red keep his distance from Agnes to keep her safe, but as fans are well aware, Red isn\u2019t one to accept direction gracefully.\n\nRelated\n\nRed has made numerous check-ins with Agnes recently, leading the pair to share some meaningful conversations. It\u2019s been refreshing to see a softer side of Red as he slows down from the criminal lifestyle to try to keep hold of what he cares about the most. But Cooper\u2019s concerns are valid. Is Red putting Agnes at risk by spending so much time with her? What is the true price of their quality time together?\n\nThe Reddington Task Force is under scrutiny\n\nPhoto: NBC\n\nRed\u2019s method of getting Wujing to stop recruiting angry Blacklisters for revenge was quite simple: kill him. OK, so it actually wasn\u2019t simple at all, Red built a full-scale replica of the Task Force HQ to pull it off, and kept Cooper and the Task Force in the dark because it\u2019s not the most legal course of action. Not only did Red kill Wujing on government property, but he also destroyed all records of his role as an FBI informant, thus eliminating any justification for the Task Force. Wujing\u2019s murder has created a flurry of legal issues for Cooper, and Red has become an inactive member of the Reddington Task Force.\n\nNow, Congressman Arthur Hudson (Toby Leonard Moore) has caught wind of the shady dealings transpiring within an elite highly-confidential FBI Task Force. Hudson is on Cooper\u2019s trail and is seeking to blow the cap off Red's entire operation. Will Cooper be able to fend off these suspicious outliers? Keeping the Task Force afloat is quickly becoming an impossible task. Find out if Cooper figures out a solution by watching the nail-biting series finale.\n\nThis story was originally published September 27, 2022.

In fact, four different actors almost took Spader's role. Sure, Spader had done TV in the past, but even David E. Kelley admitted it was tough getting Spader as the lead on \"Boston Legal,\" with executives telling him in 2004: \"James Spader is not a network face!\" (per The Guardian). That role ended up lasting five seasons, but the dry comedy and sarcastic wit required for the part were right up Spader's alley. The actor has made a career out of often choosing challenging material dealing with controversial subjects, like David Cronenberg's \"Crash\" and 2002's \"Secretary.\"\n\nSpader as the face of a network series with a heavy action bent seemed like it could be an unnatural combination, but the man Rolling Stone once called the \"strangest man alive\" made it work, bringing his usual eccentricities to the role of Raymond \"Red\" Reddington and proving rather quickly he can lead an action-oriented series just as easily as he can tackle other genres.\n\nSpader's work on \"The Blacklist\" is no doubt partially what has attracted so many big names to the show \u2014 after all, the actor doesn't do cookie cutter. Combine that with early episodes directed by cult filmmakers such as Joe Carnahan, and you have an attractive series for big names. \"The Blacklist\" has had some acting legends guest star in episodes, but what you may not know is that some of them have passed on, leaving the series as some of their final work."}, {"url": "https://www.distractify.com/p/new-dom-on-blacklist", "page_content": "Home > Television > The Blacklist Viewers Met the New Dom on \u2018The Blacklist\u2019 After Ron Raines Replaced Brian Dennehy Viewers met the new Dom on \u2018The Blacklist\u2019 after Ron Raines replaced the late Brian Dennehy on the NBC action drama.

In the anticommunist furor of post-World War II America, many crusaders\u2014both within the government and in the private sector\u2014targeted the media as a site of subversive infiltration. The blacklist was implemented by the Hollywood studios to promote their patriotic credentials in the face of public attacks and served to shield the film industry from the economic harm that would result from an association of its product with subversives. Though many of the entries on the blacklist were the result of rumours, the hint of suspicion was enough to end a career.\n\nCongressional accusations of communist influence in the film industry began in 1941, when Senators Burton Wheeler and Gerald Nye led an investigation of Hollywood\u2019s role in promoting Soviet propaganda. Wendell Willkie, the lawyer who defended the studios, revealed the senators\u2019 conflation of Judaism with communism, casting the senators as anti-Semites rather than patriots. Those hearings anticipated the much more infamous and influential investigations that would take place after World War II.\n\nIn 1947 the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) began its investigation into Hollywood. Of the individuals subpoenaed by the committee that year, 10 refused to testify. Referred to as the Hollywood Ten, they were indicted for contempt of Congress and sentenced to brief imprisonment. Although the leaders of the motion picture studios had initially supported the Hollywood Ten, they soon denounced them, and the Hollywood Ten were suspended without pay. Shortly thereafter it was announced that no subversive would be knowingly employed in Hollywood. The Hollywood blacklist was born.\n\nThe HUAC continued to subpoena members of the film industry in the 1950s, asking questions not only about their own activities but also about fellow workers. One-third of those subpoenaed cooperated with the committee, which often meant accusing friends and coworkers, and those who did not cooperate risked going to jail and being blacklisted.\n\nIn addition to the HUAC, private groups monitored the entertainment industries and published articles and pamphlets that identified subversive individuals. Perhaps the most powerful of those groups was the American Legion, which not only disseminated information about communist associations of media workers but also encouraged its 2.8 million members to picket movies made by people who had not cooperated with the HUAC.\n\nAs the anticommunism crusade subsided in the early 1960s, the Hollywood blacklist was slowly discontinued. Hollywood itself has commemorated the days of the blacklist in films like Guilty by Suspicion (1991) and The Front (1976). Those movies reinforce the popular notion of the blacklist as a blight on the history of American entertainment, a time when the film industry pandered to the hysteria of both the HUAC and private anticommunist organizations. As part of the wider sweep of anticommunist activities of the postwar period, the Hollywood blacklist brought media workers into the web of suspicion and fear that characterized the era."}]}
