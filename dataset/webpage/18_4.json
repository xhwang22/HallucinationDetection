And for the Archibald, it\u2019s a dramatic backstory for an exhibition prize that is sometimes accused of being less than the sum of its parts.\n\nThe award was announced at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney by Guido Belgiorno-Nettis, president of the gallery\u2019s board, to the heaving media throng who routinely report for duty on the biggest day in the Australian art calendar.\n\nMilsom\u2019s story is the stuff of TV drama itself. He was considered one of Australian art\u2019s most promising talents before depression, drug addiction and the death of several close friends derailed his career soon after he won the Sulman prize, sister award to the Archibald, in 2012.\n\nHigh on heroin, ice and prescription drugs, Milsom was involved in the hold-up of a 7/11 store in the Sydney suburb of Glebe with his drug dealer James Simon. At trial, the artist pleaded guilty to aggravated armed robbery, and was sentenced to six years, with a minimum jail period of two years and six months. Simon was given six years too.\n\nHe put his head on the chopping block and restored my faith in the legal system Nigel Milsom\n\nWhile inside, Milsom picked up Australia\u2019s other big portrait prize, the Moran, though not in person \u2013 his girlfriend and art dealer spoke on his behalf. The artist\u2019s sentence was later reduced by the NSW court of criminal appeal, in no small part due to Waterhouse\u2019s defence.\n\n\u201cHe basically put his hand up and said that he\u2019d help me, that he\u2019d help sort out the mess that I found myself in and that\u2019s what he did,\u201d said Milsom, who was released from Cessnock correctional centre after 12 months and showed his first exhibition after prison at Juniper Hall in Paddington in April.\n\n\u201cHe put his head on the chopping block and restored my faith in the legal system.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn Milsom\u2019s portrait, which took just a week to paint but three years to conceive, Waterstreet is rendered in Goya-esque shades of black, white and blue. In life, the lawyer is a colourful character whose quick thinking and faster living have given actor Richard Roxburgh, as his fictional alter ego Cleaver Greene, plenty to play with.\n\n\u201cCharlie is a very complex person,\u201d wrote Milsom in his supporting statement for his painting. \u201cHe isn\u2019t just a law man. He\u2019s a writer, a social environmentalist and he is involved in film, photography and theatre, too. Despite personal struggles with his own demons over the years, he has managed to dedicate most of his time to the welfare of others.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy portrait is an attempt to depict him a giant, part-man, part-mythical creature with hands that appear otherworldly, as though the anatomy of his hands has been designed to grasp unnatural disasters naturally.\u201d\n\nAlso announced on Friday were the $50,000 Wynne landscape prize and $40,000 Sulman prize for genre painting. The former went to Natasha Bieniek for her work Biophilia, an intricate painting of St Kilda botanical gardens, inspired by iPhone photos and at just a few inches square, not much bigger than one.\n\nThe Sulman went to Chinese-Australian artist Jason Phu for his piece, I Was At Yum Cha When In Rolled The Three Severed Heads of Buddha: Fear, Malice and Death.\n\nThe Young Archies, for child and teenage artists, will be announced on 22 July."}, {"url": "https://cookshillgalleries.com.au/pages/nigel-milsom-artist", "page_content": "Award-winning Australian painter Nigel Milsom was born in 1975 in Albury, New South Wales.

Milsom\u2019s powerful Archibald prize winning portrait portrayed his criminal barrister, Charles Waterstreet.

At the time, he was wielding a tomahawk and under the influence of heroin, ice, and prescription drugs.\n\nBarrister, Charles Waterstreet appeared for Milsom during his trial for armed robbery. According to Nigel, during the court proceedings, his relationship with Waterstreet began to strengthen and he began to trust him. They became friends.

Ingrid Periz\n\n\n\n\n\nNigel Milsom (b. 1975, Albury, l. Newcastle) is a figurative painter of baroque abstractions. Formal contestations within each painting and within each exhibition (light versus dark, motion versus stasis, advantage and disadvantage) slip into more complex and more personal structures. Milsom has had a consistent studio practice over two and a half decades. While at times his paintings have been more provisional in nature, strong painting is his signature indebted to chiaroscuro persuasion and a highly distinctive personal style. Typically white paint figures on black paint ground with the occasional intervention of colour, Milsom\u2019s subjects are constructed energetically via a scaffold of construction lines that begin in ink studies and are left visible in the final work. His bodies are geometric form against a more gestural and more openly brushy sequence of marks. His subjects range widely and function abstractly as entry points to composition and pictorial pragmatics. While focused around an athletics of form, Milsom\u2019s slippages into social dynamics and cultural references are ubiquitous and operate in parallel \u2014 often including veiled music and literary motifs as well as autobiographical chapters.\n\nMilsom has been awarded three of Australia\u2019s most prestigious painting prizes: The Sir John Sulman Prize (2012), The Doug Moran National Portrait Prize (2013) and The Archibald Prize (2015).

Worth $150,000, the Moran is the richest portrait-painting prize in the country, attracting a wide field of entrants \u2013 partly because of the big prize money, but also because artists consider it more credible than its older and arguably more prestigious cousin, the Art Gallery of NSW\u2019s Archibald Prize. More good paintings than bad have won, and it comes without the celebrity circus and media firestorm.\n\nMilsom has been widely considered an artist who would inevitably win both the Moran and the Archibald \u2013 when he took the 2012 Sulman prize, also at the AGNSW, it was seen as the beginning of his mature career. In many respects the Moran win is a validation of that view, but unfortunately the Sulman also marked the moment when things began to go wrong for the artist personally.\n\nIn 2012 Milsom and an accomplice, after a drug and alcohol bender, robbed a local 7-Eleven, assaulting a shop assistant. Milsom pleaded guilty and is now serving six years for armed robbery.\n\nThe details of the crime were both shocking and disturbing, particularly for those who had known the artist personally. I have been friendly with Milsom for nearly a decade, following his work through his early solo shows in Sydney\u2019s artist-run galleries, visiting his studio from time to time and having a beer with him at the pub. I was impressed by his work ethic and his commitment to his painting, and I was thrilled to see the evolution of his early painting to its unique current style.\n\nMilsom is an artist\u2019s artist, with prodigious skills and an eye for a compelling subject. He has developed an idiosyncratic approach, painting in black, white and greys, often basing his pictures on images found in old books and magazines, creating a palpable sense of time and an uncertain nostalgic aura in his pictures.\n\nHis Moran-winning work is Uncle Paddy, a portrait of a friend of the artist\u2019s late father and a one-time drinking companion of Milsom\u2019s. The painting has the presence and power of Milsom\u2019s best work and is, in my view, a deserving winner.\n\nSince the announcement there has been among Milsom\u2019s friends and peers a cautious celebration of the artist\u2019s talent but also a sense of sadness that it comes at such a difficult time for him and his family.\n\nI\u2019m sure many feel the same conflict that I do \u2013 on the one hand feeling compassion for a friend who has taken the wrong path, and on the other distress that someone who had seemed so normal would commit such an act. As his family expressed their thanks at the announcement, they also hoped that this would mark the beginning of Milsom\u2019s rehabilitation \u2013 a wish shared by all his friends.\n\nAlready there has been speculation on why the Moran judges, artist and former winner Ben Quilty and the highly respected curator Daniel Thomas, gave the prize to Milsom. Quilty, a trustee at the AGNSW and former Archibald winner, said his mission as a roving judge and trustee this year would be to shake things up. Some have speculated that the Moran decision was a publicity ploy, but the prize organisation and the Moran family themselves have been careful to downplay the win.\n\nIn the small world of Australian art, I also happen to know Quilty. If I can guess his reasons for choosing Milsom\u2019s painting, no doubt in collaboration with Thomas, it would be simply because they think it\u2019s a fantastic painting.

This year\u2019s prize exhibitions are an indication that they are all having a lot of fun.\n\nThe guide to winning\n\nThe choice of winner for the Archibald, Nigel Milsom\u2019s Judo House Part 6 (The White Bird) \u2013 main image \u2013 is a portrait of the showman barrister, Charles Waterstreet was widely predicted, as was the runner-up Mitch Cairns\u2019 angular portrait of artist Peter Powditch. There were several reasons for this.\n\n\u00a9 the artist - photograph courtesy of \u00a9 AGNSW, Felicity Jenkins\n\nFirst, the Archibald is \u2013 in essence \u2013 not an art prize but a celebration of the personalities who define Australia, and especially Sydney. Waterstreet, the flamboyant inspiration for the ABC television series Rake, has to be a front runner on those grounds alone.\n\nIn addition, Milsom was the winner of the 2013 Moran Prize \u2013 and a convicted criminal \u2013 all of which makes good copy. The Archibald is, above all things, about media coverage.\n\nThe other guide to the winner comes from the hanging. In the 1950s and 60s the Gallery director, Hal Missingham, used to write the telegrams for the winner before the judging. The Trustees were furious with him, but he had their measure.\n\nFor the 33 years of Edmund Capon\u2019s directorship it became very easy to work out which work was most likely to win. For well over a week before the final judging, the winner would be hanging in the central court on one of the long walls \u2013 either opposite where the announcement would be made, or adjacent to it.\n\nThe Director always chose the location.\n\nUnder the terms of JF Archibald\u2019s will, the prize must be judged by the Trustees. Since the rise of curators and professional gallery directors, only a few trustees are artists, but the current crop include some extremely knowledgeable collectors and art patrons.\n\nThe lighter and livelier exhibition is a reflection of their broad understanding that the Archibald exists to celebrate portraiture and people, not to elevate the status of the artists.\n\n\u00a9 the artist. Photograph courtesy of AGSNW, Mim Sterling\n\nFor me, the most impressive painting that was hung in the \u201cwinning room\u201d this year is still Kerry McInnis\u2019s Omar Musa, the poetry of unease \u2013 a muted study of one of this coming generation\u2019s most interesting writers.\n\nThe Archibald rules\n\nOne of the unspoken rules for hanging the Archibald, and the reason for the primacy of the central room, is the need to create a space for television cameras to film from a relative distance before zooming on the detail, the artist and the subject.\n\nJust outside the favoured room the curator has installed what is probably the most unusual painting to enter the Archibald.\n\nPaul Ryan has previously been exhibited, but this year\u2019s Thirteen Noahs easily outdoes his previous efforts.\n\n\u00a9 the artist - photograph courtesy of \u00a9 AGNSW, Felicity Jenkins\n\nIt is a compilation of paintings of the character actor Noah Taylor, based on different images, some distorted, each superimposed on discarded artworks \u2013 including a tapestry and ping pong bats. Taylor has inserted himself in such a wide range of characters on film and television that it makes sense for him to appear as a part of the scenery with kitsch naked ladies, landscapes and a dog. It might not have been awarded the prize, but it is easily the most exciting work in the show.\n\nThe dead and the famous\n\nThere are sub-themes in the exhibition.\n\nTwo portraits of the recently dead could not provide a greater contrast.\n\nJohn Beard has painted Bill Wright, the much loved curator, director and artist as pale ghost seen through a veil of striped primary colours. It is a celebration of his life and his values.\n\n\u00a9 the artist - photograph courtesy of \u00a9 AGNSW, Felicity Jenkins\n\nPeter Churcher has painted his mother, Betty Churcher, on her deathbed as a slack jawed empty shell with just a flicker of life in one eye. I can understand the impulse that led the artist to paint her as she faded from life, but this work needs a more sensitive context than the boisterous Archibald.\n\nMore than almost anyone I knew, Betty Churcher was very conscious of her public image.\n\nIn her last interview with Leigh Sales she went to an enormous effort to look immaculate, because she was speaking to her legacy.\n\nAnother surprising disappointment is Shaun Gladwell\u2019s monochrome portrait of Mark Donaldson VC, where a skull crashes onto the subject\u2019s helmeted head.\n\n\u00a9 the artist - photograph courtesy of \u00a9 AGNSW, Felicity Jenkins\n\nGladwell\u2019s style here is deliberately reminiscent of action hero comic books, and it does not quite work in this context.\n\nTianli Zu also uses monochrome (plus a burst of lurid green shoes) for his portrait of Edmund Capon, \u201cEdmund, your Twomblys are behind you\u201d, a reference to Capon\u2019s most distinguished acquisition for the Gallery\u2019s collection.\n\nHe has chosen to give the former director an especially gnarled face, which contrasts with the stylishly painted building.\n\n\u00a9 the artist - photograph courtesy of \u00a9 AGNSW, Mim Sterling\n\nIf it were dependant on subject matter, the clear winners would have been portraits of artists and people working in the arts.\n\nFilippa Buttitta has painted the much loved Judy Cassab while Tom Carment has a self portrait of his own ageing face.\n\nRodney Pople, an Archibald regular, has painted Frannie Hopkirk, Brett Whiteley\u2019s sister looking bug-eyed, while former National Portrait Gallery director Andrew Sayers has a portrait of Tim Bonyhady but manages to give him an expression that looks a bit like Sayers himself.\n\n\u00a9 the artist - photograph courtesy of \u00a9 AGNSW, Felicity Jenkins\n\nPerhaps the selection of so many people from the arts is a retreat from the current abysmal state of Australian politics \u2013 the only politicians included are those mad mavericks, Bob Katter and Cory Bernardi \u2013 neither with works that are especially memorable.\n\nThere is a sign of a better world with Sally Ross\u2019s very sweet portrait of documentary film maker Eva Orner, which hangs adjacent to Guy Morgan\u2019s portrait of Louise Voigt, the CEO of Barnardo\u2019s Australia.\n\nThe Wynne Prize, also judged by the Trustees, is often overlooked in the annual festival of faces. Mostly that neglect is justified, but this year the Trustees have reached out and given the prize to a young Melbourne artist Natasha Bieniek.\n\nI get the impression that, having done their duty by the public and paid homage to the sheer exuberant sensationalism of the Archibald, the Trustees have collectively released their inner aesthete and indulged in supporting both quality and the coming generation. As Guido Belgiorno-Nettis says, judging these prizes is \u201cabsolutely the most fun thing\u201d.\n\n\n\nSee also:\n\nCongratulations Natasha Bieniek, but the Wynne Prize is deeply flawed\n\n\n\nThe Archibald Prize exhibition will show at the Art Gallery of NSW from July 18 - September 27.
