Van Cleef appeared in 90 films and over 100 television series spanning nearly four decades. Before breaking into films, during World War II, Van Cleef served in the United States Navy aboard minesweepers and subchasers. Later, he had a brief career as an accountant and became involved in amateur theatrics in his spare time. An audition for a professional role led to a touring company job in \"Mr. Roberts.\" His performance was seen by Stanley Kramer, who cast him as henchman Jack Colby in \"High Noon\" (1952), a role that brought him great recognition, despite having no dialogue in the film.

First telecast on Dick Powell's \"Zane Grey Theatre\" (CBS) on March 7, 1958, the pilot premiered on ABC in the regular television season on September 30 that same year. The show's creator, Arnold Laven, developed customized Winchester rifle, not a six gun, the main protagonist's signature firearm.\n\nThe opening credits showcasing the skill of Chuck Connors as Lucas McCain firing his rapid-action Winchester rifle set the tone for the western action adventure, to be sure, but the show aspired to be more than a vehicle for gratuitous gun-slinging. Heart-warming human relationships, specifically the kinship between father and son, provided balance, and sometimes a paradoxical juxtaposition, to the violent backdrop of life on the frontier. The rifle complemented Lucas McCain's persona as a self-possessed, rugged individualist who had high ethical standards and a cool head. Connors in the title role, with rifle at the ready, portrayed the iconic western hero \u2013 a crackerjack marksman and cowboy-turned-single-father and homesteader facing life's challenges with a stoical, reasoned view about social justice and personal responsibility. Uppermost in his mind was being a good role model for his son and a solid citizen in his community. So, when McCain picked up his rifle, he wielded it not only with confidence and competence, but also with rational deliberation and fair-minded determination. He admonished his young son in one episode, \"A man doesn't run from a fight, Mark, but that doesn't mean you go looking to run to one.\"\n\nFamily values and moral principles informed many storylines in THE RIFLEMAN series. Through the McCains' adventures with the townfolk of North Fork and the weekly influx of visitors, THE RIFLEMAN was a series of morality plays examining human nature's rich and varied complexity \u2013 with all its foibles and follies, sorrow and humor, venality and virtue. The inspiration for many episodes was drawn from Biblical parables, sometimes recapitulated explicity, such as the story of Job, which was related by Lucas to son Mark in the second episode, \"Home Ranch.\" Second chances \u2013 compassion and redemption \u2013 was a prominent, recurring theme. It was often elicited in episodes featuring Marshal Micah Torrance, played by Paul Fix, a sometime derelict, recovered alcholic, who was a regular character introduced in the fourth episode, \"The Marshal,\" after R.G. Armstrong, who played the sheriff in the pilot was killed off. The themes were timeless and universal, featuring sympathetic characters grappling with familiar human dilemmas and classic good-versus-evil conflicts.\n\nArnold Laven and series co-producers, Arthur Gardner and Jules V. Levy, presciently anticipated that the show's strength lay in the father-son relationship, and its best asset was the genuine filial affection between actors Chuck Connors as Lucas McCain and Johnny Crawford as Mark McCain. In fact, the depiction of a widowed father grappling with the challenges of raising a son alone in THE RIFLEMAN may have been a television first in its departure from the traditional depiction of a family as mother, father and child. Critics and viewers responded favorably to the novel family portrayal celebrating the father-son bond, and it appears to account for the enduring appeal of the series. In the June 20, 2004 issue of \"TV Guide,\" the character of Lucas McCain was ranked #32 in a list of the \"50 Greatest TV Dads of All Time.\" In 1959, at age 13, Johnny Crawford was nominated for an Emmy for his role in THE RIFLEMAN. Chuck Connors later remarked with admiration how young Johnny Crawford comported himself on THE RIFLEMAN set with deferential respect toward the crew, addressing them as \"sir\" and \"ma'am\" upon arriving to the set on his first day until departing on the last day."}, {"url": "https://www.therifleman.net/episodes?episode=78", "page_content": "The Woman from Hog RidgeEpisode 78Writer: Calvin J.
