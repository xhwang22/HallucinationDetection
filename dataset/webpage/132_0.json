{"Richard Carpenter was born on 17 April 1934.": [{"url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/richard-karen-carpenters-biography-1258579/", "page_content": "In the summer of 1974, the Carpenters sat down with Rolling Stone writer Tom Nolan at Hollywood\u2019s Au Petit Caf\u00e9 for a cover story. Richard and Karen Carpenter, who had spent the past four years scoring massive soft-rock hits like \u201c(They Long to Be) Close to You,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve Only Just Begun,\u201d \u201cSuperstar,\u201d and \u201cTop of the World,\u201d took the opportunity to vent to Nolan about the uncool, wholesome image that they felt the press had created for the sibling duo.\n\n\u201cThis \u2026thing they\u2019ve built up, where it\u2019s implicitly understood the Carpenters don\u2019t smoke, the Carpenters don\u2019t drink,\u201d Richard said. \u201cNever would swear. Never would listen to rock music. It\u2019s like we\u2019re Pat Boone, only a little cleaner. As if all we do all day is drink milk, eat apple pie, and take showers. I don\u2019t even like milk.\u201d\n\nRichard can only laugh when the quote is read back to him nearly 50 years later. \u201cWell, that\u2019s what were described as,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was the way we looked and our audiences looked. The rock critics, they didn\u2019t like our audiences. It made the whole thing seem irrelevant, like we were nothing, and in no time at all, no one would ever remember us.\u201d\n\nThe new book Carpenters: The Musical Legacy tries to show how wrong that was. Written by Mike Cidoni Lennox and Chris May, the massive, definitive biography chronicles the duo\u2019s career in elaborate detail, based on more than 100 hours of interviews with Richard and full access to his archive. It aims to correct the legacy of the group, which is often overshadowed by Karen Carpenter\u2019s death from anorexia in 1983.\n\n1974 Richard Carpenter Collection\n\nEditor\u2019s picks\n\n\u201cBetween the TV movie [1989\u2019s The Karen Carpenter Story] and a number of unauthorized documentaries and articles, that\u2019s what a lot of the attention is focused on,\u201d Richard says. \u201cNot how successful we were and continue to be, nor Karen\u2019s voice and how timeless it is. It gets pushed to the back. The two of us are underrated, to this day. And we sell a lot every year, all over the world \u2014 still.\u201d\n\nThe book marks Richard\u2019s second time authorizing a Carpenters biography, after 1994\u2019s The Carpenters: The Untold Story by Ray Coleman. \u201cKaren\u2019s anorexia was much fresher,\u201d says Lennox, \u201cand he delivered what Richard calls \u2018the anorexia book.\u2019\u201d Adds May: \u201cHe\u2019s been down this road before, and he was very hesitant to do it again. We weren\u2019t sure if we were going to get his blessing.\u201d\n\nThat changed when Lennox and May approached Richard to write the introduction to their book. Lennox, a senior entertainment reporter at the Associated Press, and May, a music director and arranger, are both longtime Carpenters experts \u2014 they met online on a forum dedicated to the group. \u201cHe realized our hearts and background,\u201d May says.\n\nSoon, Richard was overseeing the entire project, and Lennox and May had gained his trust. \u201cThis was a book that intentionally didn\u2019t want to dive into their personal demons, and we make that point really clear,\u201d says Lennox. \u201cAfter reading the first draft, Richard said, \u2018You\u2019ve really got to deal with Karen\u2019s anorexia by the time you get to late 1973, and you have to deal with my use of Quaaludes.\u2019 These were things that he knew. The word \u2018authorized\u2019 can be a very dirty word, and here we were trying to just focus on the music. He pushed us into things and kept us in the nonfiction section.\u201d\n\nKaren rehearses at home, 1973 Richard Carpenter Collection\n\nHaving full access to the Carpenters\u2019 archives meant Lennox and May were able to provide an extensive history of the group. One chapter includes a Year in the Life, which maps out 364 days the duo spent in 1970 \u2014 from the release of their breakout single \u201c(They Long to Be) Close to You\u201d to their self-titled third album. Tour dates, television appearances, chart positions, and other major events are laid out in immense detail. This is somewhat rare, since many groups from that time don\u2019t have detailed records of their tour schedules, let alone the dates of photo shoots.\n\n\u201cWe were getting close to deadline,\u201d Lennox recalls, noting they spent four years writing the book. \u201cThere was a substantial amount of their gigs [that] could not be found. We finally said, \u2018Richard, we need a complete itinerary for the Carpenters.\u2019 He went downstairs, and lo and behold, he brought up Karen\u2019s itinerary, and in they were in [her] handwriting.\u201d\n\nThe writers used more than 200 images in the book, some of which showcase Karen\u2019s drumming. \u201cShe was a rare bird in that department,\u201d Richard says. \u201cShe was way beyond a novelty. There are more women playing the drums now.\u201d\n\nMore than anything, Richard says he really misses his sister\u2019s company. \u201cWe definitely liked and disliked the same things \u2014 a real friend where you could talk about anything you wish and you don\u2019t feel uncomfortable,\u201d he says. It also pains him to think about the records the Carpenters could have gone on to make. \u201cThat\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, she was only 32.\u201d\n\nNearly four decades after Karen\u2019s death, Lennox and May hope the biography will reintroduce the duo to a younger generation and rectify their legacy. \u201cMy hope is people will realize that the story of Richard and Karen Carpenter is not the most tragic in pop music \u2014 it is one of the most triumphant,\u201d Lennox says. \u201cThis gray cloud will no longer loom over this incredible work. I think the last thing in the world that she would have wanted was for her death to define her life.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.smoothradio.com/artists/carpenters/richard-carpenter-facts-age-wife-children-net-worth/", "page_content": "Richard Carpenter was one of the most successful singer-songwriters of all time, scoring many hits with his sister Karen Carpenter as part of the brother-sister duo Carpenters.\n\nBut when did he form the Carpenters with his sister Karen?

He was a record producer, arranger, pianist and keyboardist, and occasional lyricist, composer as well as joining with Karen on harmony vocals.\n\nChildhood\n\nRichard Lynn Carpenter was born to parents Agnes Reuwer Tatum and Harold Bertram Carpenter at Grace-New Haven Hospital (now called Yale-New Haven Hospital) in New Haven, Connecticut, the same hospital where Karen was later born.[1] He was named after his father's younger brother, Richard Lynn Carpenter. Carpenter and his uncle both married women named Mary.[2]\n\nHe frequently played the piano while his sister, Karen, played baseball outside.[3] He and Karen also liked to listen to the children's records their father bought for them when they were young.[3] Richard was introduced to Perry Como and Ella Fitzgerald, among many others, and by age 12, he knew he wanted to be in the music industry.\n\nThe Carpenter family moved from New Haven to Downey, California, in June 1963. They wanted Richard to further his music career, and the family was fed up with the cold New England winters.[4] He studied music at the California State University at Long Beach. There, he met Frank Pooler, a conductor and composer. Pooler wrote the lyrics to the Christmas classic \"Merry Christmas Darling\" in 1968. He also met good friend John Bettis, who co-wrote songs with Richard.\n\nThe Richard Carpenter Trio and Spectrum\n\nCarpenter created the Richard Carpenter Trio in 1965 with sister Karen and friend Wes Jacobs. Richard played the piano; Karen played the drums, and Wes played the tuba and bass.\n\nIn 1966, the Richard Carpenter Trio played \"Iced Tea\" and \"The Girl from Ipanema\" at the Hollywood Bowl Battle of the Bands. They won the competition, and shortly after recorded three songs at RCA Studios: \"Every Little Thing,\" \"Strangers in the Night,\" and the Carpenter original, \"Iced Tea.\" \"Iced Tea\" is the only recording that was officially released to the public.\n\nAround 1967, Richard and Karen joined four other student musicians from Long Beach State to form a sextet, Spectrum, consisting of:\n\nJohn Bettis;\n\nRichard Carpenter;\n\nKaren Carpenter;\n\nLeslie Johnston;\n\nGary Sims;\n\nDanny Woodhams.\n\nAlthough Spectrum played frequently at LA-area nightclubs such as Whisky A Go-Go, they met with an unenthusiastic response - their broad harmonies and avoidance of rock 'n' roll limited the band's commercial potential. Yet Spectrum was fruitful in another way, providing the raw material of future success: Bettis went on to become a lyricist for Richard's original compositions, and all the other members except Leslie Johnston went on to become members of the Carpenters.\n\nCareer\n\nRichard and Karen finally signed with A&M Records on April 22, 1969. \"Let's hope we have some hits,\" Herb Alpert told the two. According to Richard, Herb Alpert gave them carte blanche in the recording studios, but after Offering, their first album, was released, and wasn't a big seller, it was rumored that some of A&M's people were asking Alpert to release the Carpenters, but he believed in their talent, and insisted on giving them another chance.\n\nAlpert suggested that the Carpenters record a Burt Bacharach and Hal David song called \"(They Long to Be) Close to You.\" Though Richard worked up an arrangement, only after Alpert's insistence, his arranging talents clearly shone in the finished product. His arranging and musical talents, as well as Karen's vocals, helped the song climb to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, staying there for a month. \"(They Long to Be) Close to You\" gained public recognition seemingly overnight. According to Richard, even though the song became popular overnight, the Carpenters themselves did not.\n\nSitting at home one night, Richard was watching TV, and saw (and heard) a commercial for Crocker National Bank. He recognized the voices of Paul Williams and Roger Nichols, two A&M songwriters. It was the song \"We've Only Just Begun.\" Richard made some calls to confirm their involvement, and asked if there was a full version of the song, which Williams affirmed. Carpenter managed to turn a bank commercial jingle into an RIAA certified Gold Record. It peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100, and has become a popular wedding song. The song also successfully launched the careers of Nichols and Williams, who went on to write multiple hits for the Carpenters, and many other artists.\n\nRichard composed many of the Carpenters' hits as well, with John Bettis as lyricist, such as:\n\n\"Goodbye to Love\" (one of the first pop ballads to have a fuzz guitar solo - #7--influenced the development of the power ballad [5] )\n\n) \"Top of the World\" (#1. Though the Carpenters originally opted to not release this song as a single, a version recorded by Lynn Anderson reached #2 on the Billboard Country charts; following the success of Anderson's version, the Carpenters decided to release their version as a single, and it reached the Billboard top ten.\n\n\"Yesterday Once More\" (#2)\n\n\"Only Yesterday\" (#4)\n\nQuaalude addiction and treatment\n\nWhile Karen was suffering from the anorexia nervosa that would ultimately claim her life in 1983, Richard suffered from an addiction to quaaludes. They had been prescribed for him by his doctor as sleep aids, but his use got out of hand. He eventually sought treatment for his addiction at the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kansas, checking into the clinic in 1979 for an eight-week treatment program, which proved successful.\n\nPost-Carpenters\n\nOn October 12, 1983, eight months after Karen's death, the Carpenter family celebrated the unveiling of the Carpenters' new star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Richard said in his speech, \"This is a sad day, but at the same time a very special and beautiful day to my family and I. My only regret is that Karen is not physically here to share it with us, but I know that she is very much alive in our minds, and in our hearts.\"[3]\n\nHe started recording a solo album on June 26, 1985, and finished the album on July 5, 1987.[6] The album was called Time. It featured Dusty Springfield and Dionne Warwick. Springfield sang \"Something in Your Eyes\", and Warwick sang \"In Love Alone\". Richard created a song dedicated to Karen called \"When Time Was All We Had\". It starts off as an a cappella, but then Richard's piano fades in, as well as Herb Alpert's flugelhorn. Lyrics included:\n\nOur hearts were filled with music and laughter, Your voice will be the sweetest sound I'll ever hear and yet, We knew somehow the song would never end, When time was all we had to spend.\n\nIn 1996, at the suggestion of music writer Daniel Levitin, Carpenter recorded and released Richard Carpenter: Pianist, Arranger, Composer, Conductor, which included reworkings of many Carpenters favorites, including hits and album tracks, and ends with \"Karen's Theme\", which Carpenter composed for the 1989 made for TV movie, The Karen Carpenter Story.\n\nIn 1984, Carpenter married his first cousin Mary Rudolph (daughter of his mother's sister Bernice). Contrary to popular belief, Rudolph and Carpenter are not biologically related, since Rudolph is adopted. Her brother, Mark Rudolph, was the Carpenters' road manager, as well as the radio call-in \"contestant\" in the [Oldies] \"Medley\" on the 1973 album, Now & Then. The couple had been dating since the late 1970s. A young Mary made a cameo appearance in the Carpenters' promotional video for the song \"I Need to Be in Love\". It should be noted that when Karen learned of the relationship, she was completely mortified and shared her feelings with her brother on a number of occasions, leading to a final argument where Richard told his sister \"We have had the tests done, there will be no problem if we have children in the future. So let it drop!\" Richard and Mary have five children: Kristi Lynn, Traci Tatum, Mindi Karen (named after his late sister), Colin Paul and Taylor Mary. The children and Richard sometimes perform music together at various Carpenter-related events. The family today resides in Thousand Oaks, California. He also funds an annual scholarship/talent show for people with artistic abilities that is held at the Thousand Oaks Civic Center.\n\nRecently, Richard helped in the productions of the documentaries Close to You: Remembering the Carpenters (1997) and Only Yesterday: The Carpenters Story (2007). He released the DVDs Gold: Greatest Hits and Interpretations. Carpenter is also mastering a new Christmas album.\n\nDiscography\n\nThe Carpenters\n\nMain article: The Carpenters discography Main article: List of songs by The Carpenters\n\nAlbums\n\nYear Title Notes 1987 Time Released in October 1987\n\nRichard Carpenter's debut solo album\n\nIncluded guest singers Dusty Springfield, Dionne Warwick, and actor Scott Grimes\n\nOut of print\n\nLabel: A&M Records\n\nFormats: LP album, cassette tape, compact disc 1998 Pianist, Arranger\n\nComposer, Conductor Released on January 27, 1998\n\nRichard's second and latest solo album\n\nIncludes instrumentals of popular songs of Carpenters\n\nDedicated to Richard's deceased mother, Agnes Carpenter [7]\n\nLabel: A&M Records\n\nFormats: Cassette tape (out of print), compact disc (out of print), digital download\n\nSingles\n\nSingles\n\nYear Song Chart positions B-side RIAA\n\ncert.[8] U.S. catalogue\n\nnumber Album U.S. Hot 100 U.S. AC UK JPN CAN AUS 1987 \"Something in Your Eyes\"\n\n(featuring Dusty Springfield) - 12 84 - - - \"Time\" - Time \"Calling Your Name Again\" - - - - - - \"When Time Was All We Had\" - 1998 \"Karen's Theme\" - - - - - - - Pianist, Arranger, Composer, Conductor \"Medley\" - - - - - - -\n\nReferences\n\nThe Carpenters Lists List of albums by the Carpenters List of songs by the Carpenters Singles 1969: Ticket to Ride 1970: (They Long to Be) Close to You We've Only Just Begun Merry Christmas Darling For All We Know\n\n1971: Rainy Days and Mondays Superstar Bless the Beasts and Children (B-side) Hurting Each Other\n\n1972: It's Going to Take Some Time Flat Baroque (B-side) Goodbye to Love\n\n1973: Sing Yesterday Once More Top of the World 1974: Jambalaya (On the Bayou) I Won't Last a Day Without You Please Mr. Postman\n\n1975: Only Yesterday Solitaire 1976: There's a Kind of Hush (All Over the World) I Need to Be in Love Goofus Breaking Up Is Hard to Do\n\n1977: All You Get from Love Is a Love Song Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft The Christmas Song 1978: Sweet, Sweet Smile\n\n1978 (cont'd): I Believe You 1981: Touch Me When We're Dancing (Want You) Back in My Life Again Those Good Old Dreams\n\n1982: Beechwood 4-5789 1983: Make Believe It's Your First Time 1984: Your Baby Doesn't Love You Anymore 1986: Honolulu City Lights Albums 1969: Offering (repackaged as \"Ticket to Ride\") 1970: Close to You 1971: Carpenters 1972: A Song for You 1973: Now & Then 1975: Horizon\n\n1976: A Kind of Hush 1977: Passage 1978: Christmas Portrait 1981: Made in America 1983: Voice of the Heart\n\n1984: An Old-Fashioned Christmas 1989: Lovelines 2004: As Time Goes By Compilations 1973: The Singles: 1969-1973 1978: The Singles: 1974-1978 1985: Yesterday Once More 1991: From The Top 1995: Interpretations\n\n1997: Love Songs 1998: Reflections 2000: The Singles: 1969-1981 2002: The Essential Collection: 1965-1997 2003: Carpenters Perform Carpenter\n\n2004: Gold: 35th Anniversary Edition 2006: The Ultimate Collection Television Specials/Series 1971: Carpenters: Live at the BBC Make Your Own Kind of Music 1976: The Carpenters' Very First TV Special 1977: Christmas with the Carpenters 1978: Space Encounters A Christmas Portrait 1980: Music, Music, Music!

The Carpenters began when, atthe age of 19, Richard Carpenter turned his talents to composing and arranging music specifically to spotlight the singing talents of his younger sister, the late Karen Carpenter Burris. Together the siblings experienced incredible popularity and sold millions of records. The two achieved international fame and won numerous awards until the untimely death of Karen Carpenter in 1983. Richard Carpenter successfully worked his way through the loss of his sister and resurfaced to embark on a solo career as well as to release a series of posthumous albums of music by Carpenters.\n\nBorn October 15, 1946 in New Haven, Connecticut, Carpenter began to collect records before he could read the labels. By age four he was already captivated by the world of music and began accordion lessons. He began piano studies at age eight, and although he favored the piano as an instrument he failed to impress his first piano teacher. It was Henry Will, Carpenter\u2019s second piano teacher, who noted that the boy was clearly engrossed with improvisation, arranging, and writing songs. Carpenter was particularly intrigued by musical scales and harmonies, and by the time he was 12, his musical talent was undeniable. \u201cHe was about twelve. The whole neighborhood knew that he was on his way to becoming a professional musician, even then,\u201d stated a family friend to biographer Ray Coleman. The boy hounded his parents incessantly to purchase records. He was not partial to any particular style; he loved all music. After three years of lessons, piano teacher Henry Will referred Carpenter for an audition at Yale Music School because of the boy\u2019s astonishing aptitude for music.\n\nDuring his primary school years, Carpenter was not a popular student, especially in high school. His classmates viewed him as odd because of his advanced preoccupation with music, which ran contrary to the interests of his peers. Shunning sports and other extracurricular activities, he started an ensemble of sax, bass, and drums with some friends. They developed an extensive repertoire and the ability to play on demand. At age 16, he participated in a professional recording session for a local New Haven group.\n\nCarpenter was 16 years old when his family moved to Downey, California, near Los Angeles. He transferred to\n\nFor the Record \u2026\n\nBorn Richard Lynn Carpenter, October 15, 1946, New Haven, CT; son of Agnes Reuwer Tatum and Harold; one sibling, Karen; married Mary Rudolph in Downey, CA on May 19, 1984; four daughters.

He also performed as a lounge act in his spare time while his was still in high school. After graduation in 1964 he enrolled in a music program at California State University at Long Beach, but becoming increasingly sidetracked by show business and performing, he abandoned his studies before earning a degree. He then formed the Richard Carpenter Trio with his younger sister on drums, and fellow college student Wes Jacobs on tuba. The group worked around the area in local restaurants, and for parties and other affairs. In 1966, at age 19, Carpenter entered his trio in the Battle of the Bands on at the Hollywood Bowl, and won prizes for the best instrumentalist and best combo leader. The recognition led to a short-lived contract with RCA records for the trio at the end of 1966.\n\nDuring the summer of 1967, Carpenter performed at Disneyland with John Bettis as a banjo and piano duo. That partnership ultimately led to a long-time song writing and producing collaboration between Bettis and Carpenter. All the while the Carpenters, brother and sister, continued working in churches and performing at amateur night shows while Richard Carpenter gave piano lessons on the side, to finance a new piano. At one point the duo teamed with Bill Sissyoev on double bass for an appearance on \u201cYour All American College Show.\u201d That performance earned them a commercial contract with Ford Motor Company.\n\nThe Carpenters\u2019 big break came when trumpet player and record producer Herb Alpert of A&M Records heard a tape of Karen Carpenter\u2019s voice in 1969. Alpert was determined to market the wholesome Carpenter siblings, despite the media\u2019s tight focus at that time with hard rock, hippies, and other more rebellious subcultures. Alpert signed the Carpenters to A&M records on April 22, 1969. Their first album, Offering, was released that same year. The album sold poorly, but Alpert resolved to try at least one more record. For their second release the Carpenters pulled an old Hal David/Bert Bacharach song from relative obscurity. The recording, \u201cClose to You,\u201d became a number one best seller by the summer of 1970, and launched the duo into the big time.\n\nThe Carpenters next recorded a song that originally aired on a bank commercial. The song \u201cWe\u2019ve Only Just Begun,\u201d was written by\u2014then unknown\u2014Paul Williams. Within weeks of its release, the song rewarded the duo with their second smash hit. Coleman quoted Williams\u2019s partner, Roger Nichols in reference to the Carpenters rapid success, \u201cThey [Richard and Karen Carpenter] had a frightening amount of musical talent drooling off them.\u201d Meanwhile the decision had been made to market the duo not as The Carpenters, but simply as \u201cCarpenters.\u201d Carpenters\u2019 second album, Close to You, was released in 1970, and they embarked on a tour of the U.S. later that year.\n\nWhile on tour they heard and were enamored with \u201cFor All We Know,\u201d the theme from the feature film Lovers and Other Strangers. The two decided almost immediately to record the song that became their third hit single. In 1971, \u201cRainy Days and Mondays Always Get Me Down,\u201d another Paul Williams song, was their fourth single to sell a million copies. Key to Carpenters\u2019 success was Richard Carpenter\u2019s talent for writing, selecting, and arranging songs to most effectively showcase his sister\u2019s beautiful and eloquent voice. In 1971 Carpenters were nominated for six Grammy awards, of which they won two: Best Contemporary Vocal Group and Best New Artist. Noted composer Henry Mancini was impressed so much by Carpenters that he offered them a song with vocal and piano scores, to record on their third album. That album, Carpenters, earned gold certification and won a Grammy Award the following year.\n\nRichard Carpenter and his sister earned a reputation as a pair of driven perfectionists and work-a-holics, yet down-to-earth at the same time. Seemingly unaffected by fame, the Carpenter siblings treated the members of their entourage as equals. When Jerry Weintraub took over as manager of Carpenters in 1976, however, the group was faltering between Karen Carpenter\u2019s health problems\u2014she had developed the eating disorder, anorexia nervosa\u2014and Richard Carpenter\u2019s addiction to sleeping pills. As the talented duo launched into stardom, they operated at breakneck pace, their schedule habitually overbooked: 145 concerts in 1971, plus a European tour; 174 concerts in 1972, plus live performances, television appearances, and an album; 174 concerts in 1973, plus an album and three television appearances. Additionally, Carpenter suffered a serious motorcycle accident that year. He broke his leg and his wrist, sprained the other wrist, and spent five months healing in casts, yet refused to slow his work pace. In 1974 there were 203 concerts and a trip to Japan, where the pair encountered massive crowds. Carpenters performed 118 concerts in 1975, toured Japan and Europe, and taped an album. Their schedule that year was too hectic even for the driven Carpenter siblings, and portions of the European tour overflowed into 1976.\n\nUntil that time Richard Carpenter\u2019s growing addiction to Quaaludes, a powerful sleeping medication, was not apparent. The Carpenters in fact were known to sip on iced tea during recording sessions and while working, but never to drink alcohol. At the peak of their stardom, during the mid-1970s, Karen Carpenter developed anorexia nervosa. Richard Carpenter, troubled by his sister\u2019s failing health, turned to alcohol, cigarettes, and increasingly frequent doses of sleeping pills. At the peak of his addiction, Carpenter was known to take as many as six pills at a time and then wake up in the middle of the night to take some more. In 1977 Carpenter was hospitalized in an unsuccessful attempt to quell the addition. His performance ability was affected, and by 1978 he turned over a significant share of his behind-the-scenes work to Peter Knight for their ho Wday album, Christmas Portrait Carpenter lost the strength to perform. Lacking confidence and concentration, he canceled engagements. He underwent treatment again in 1979, and his health improved. Carpenters released Made in America in 1981, a comeback album, and made a promotional tour in London. The album includes the Carpenter/Bettis hit \u201cBecause We Are in Love,\u201d written as a wedding song for Karen Carpenter who married Tom Burris in 1980. A second reunion album, underway in 1982, was never completed. Karen Carpenter\u2019s marriage quickly dissolved. She became increasingly ill and died of heart failure due to her anorexic condition in 1983.\n\nAfter grieving the death of his sister, Carpenter released his first solo recording, Time, in 1987. For the next ten years Carpenter became involved in a variety of personal and professional projects, before emerging with his second solo album, Pianist-Arranger-Composer-Conductor, in 1997. Carpenter, as always, maintained extensive control over the production of his music. At live performances, Carpenter interspersed an assortment of newer songs, mixed with reprises of vintage Carpenter tunes from the 1970s, plus classics from other composers.\n\nDuring the course of Richard and Karen Carpenter\u2019s careers, the siblings were hosted by President Richard Nixon at the White House to entertain West German Chancellor Willy Brandt on May 1, 1973. They won three Grammy awards and received a \u201cGeorgie\u201d award in 1971 from the American Guild of Variety Artists for Best Musical Group. October 12, 1983 marked the dedication of a Carpenters square on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Hollywood Boulevard. New Haven\u2019s Nathan Hale School presented a Hall of Fame Award \u201cTo Richard and Karen Carpenter\u201d at graduation ceremonies on June 19, 1991, and California State University Long Beach Campus dedicated the Carpenter Performance Arts Center to the duo.\n\nTime, A&M, 1987.\n\nPianist, Arranger, Composer, Conductor, A&M, 1997.\n\nWith Carpenters\n\nOffering, A&M, 1969.\n\nClose To You (includes \u201cWe\u2019ve Only Just Begun\u201d), A&M, 1970.\n\nCarpenters (includes \u201cRainy Days and Mondays\u201d), A&M, 1971.\n\nA Song for You (includes \u201cTop of the World\u201d), A&M, 1972.\n\nNow and Then,(includes \u201cSing\u201d), A&M 1973.\n\nHorizon, A&M 1975.\n\nPassage, 1977.\n\nChristmas Portrait, A&M, 1978.\n\nMade in America, A&M 1981.\n\nVoice of the Heart, A&M, 1983.\n\nAn Old Fashioned Christmas, A&M, 1984.\n\nLoveliness, A&M, 1989.\n\nFrom the Top, A&M, 1991.\n\nBooks\n\nColeman, Ray, The Carpenters: the Untold Story, Harper Collins Publishers, 1994.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nLos Angeles Times, February 17, 1997.\n\nOnline\n\nhttp://www.keyboardmag.com/features/carpnter/carpntr.shtml, (October 2, 1998).\n\n\u2014Gloria Cooksey"}, {"url": "https://rankedwiki.com/wiki/richard-carpenter/", "page_content": "Is Richard Carpenter LGBTQ?\n\nWho is Richard Carpenter?\n\nThe talented Richard Carpenter has worked as a musician, record producer, songwriter, keyboardist, composer as well as pianist.

From January to May of this year, Carpenter spent countless hours editing and rewriting the just-published biography Carpenters: The Musical Legacy (Princeton Architectural Press) with his co-authors, Associated Press reporter Mike Cidoni Lennox, and musicologist and Carpenters expert Chris May.\n\nRichard authorized one other Carpenters biography published in 1994. But the writer delivered what Richard has called, \u201cthe anorexia book\u201d \u00ad\u2013 and in it, for the most part, the story of the Carpenters\u2019 music went untold.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSubsequently, Richard had other offers to tell the duo\u2019s story, but he wasn\u2019t intrigued until Cidoni and May came along in summer 2018, the two noting they\u2019d had enough of media features, documentaries, and books focusing on Karen\u2019s eating disorder (anorexia nervosa) and the complications which led to her death in 1983 at the age 32.\n\nAfter the writers promised to put the spotlight back on the duo\u2019s career, specifically their recordings, \u201cI agreed to become involved in the project and involved I became,\u201d Richard writes in the book\u2019s introduction.\n\nCarpenter submitted to approximately 100 hours of interviews and gave the authors access to his rarely visited archive of thousands of Carpenters artifacts, including family photos, outtakes from album-cover shoots, legends from master tapes, handwritten itineraries. Although immaculately organized, most of the items were untouched for decades and never published.\n\nCarpenters - Only Yesterday\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nWhile the writers were committed to keeping the book\u2019s narrative strictly business, they insisted Carpenter address the duo\u2019s personal demons \u2013 notably, his addiction to sleeping medication and her eating disorder \u2013 when they affected the recordings.\n\nCarpenter lived up to the agreement, and then some. In fact, after reviewing the writers\u2019 first draft of the book, Richard was adamant about more personal details being included.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want this to be yet another one of those authorized biographies where this famous person never admits to making a single mistake,\u201d Richard explains during a press junket for the book in September. \u201cNobody would even believe that. Nobody\u2019s perfect. We weren\u2019t perfect.\u201d\n\nWeighing in at almost four pounds, and containing 344 pages and approximately 300 images, at first glance Carpenters: The Musical Legacy looks like a mere coffee-table book of pretty photos. But it\u2019s really a genre buster: part biography, part memoir, and part reference guide. The book also includes a painstakingly researched discography, along with essays by (and interviews with) key Carpenters colleagues.\n\n\u201cFor those who are just discovering the Carpenters or those who have been with us from the start and want to know every little thing about our career, this is the definitive tome,\u201d Richard says.\n\nIn the late spring, Carpenter had yet to put finishing touches on the book when he began preparations for his third solo album. And by June, he was recording Richard Carpenter\u2019s Piano Songbook, a collection of piano-solo versions of Carpenters greatest hits and fan favorites. Already available in Japan, it\u2019s set for release worldwide by Decca on January 14.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nRichard\u2019s summer also included a trip to the Henson Studios in Hollywood, to shoot promotional videos for Piano Songbook. It marked Carpenter\u2019s first time in nearly 30 years performing on the site of the former A&M Records lot, where he and Karen recorded all of their hits.\n\nReturning to the Carpenters\u2019 former home away from home \u201cwas quite emotional,\u201d Richard recalls.\n\nA barrage of media interviews plugging the book and album began in late August and will continue through the year, but on October 27, Richard got a night off to attend a private gala at The Wallis Center for the Performing Arts in Beverly Hills, where he was named a \u201cSteinway Artist,\u201d celebrating his career-long association with the 160-year-old instrument maker Steinway & Sons.\n\nRichard has performed on Steinway grand pianos on all but one of the Carpenters albums, as well as on the new Piano Songbook album. He also has two Steinways in his suburban Los Angeles home.\n\nAt age 75, Richard Carpenter seems nowhere near retirement.

Richard and his sister Karen combined their talents on a long string of hits, including such classics as \u201c Close To You,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve Only Just Begun,\u201d \u201cSuperstar,\u201d \u201cTop Of The World\u201d and \u201cYesterday Once More.\u201d\n\nBy any measure, the Carpenters are among the most popular acts in recording history. Their worldwide sales top 100 million copies. Their many honors include three Grammy Awards, the first American Music Award ever presented for favorite Pop Group and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nThe Carpenters were the #1 American hit makers of the 1970s, according to Joel Whitburn\u2019s authoritative Top Pop Singles. And Karen and Richard\u2019s success went far beyond their homeland. They topped the charts from Holland to Hong Kong and in\n\nJapan, remain the best-selling non-Japanese artists ever.\n\nRichard and Karen were born to Harold and Agnes Carpenter, in New Haven, Connecticut, Richard in October, 1946 and Karen in March, 1950. By the age of 16, Richard was studying piano at Yale University. In 1963 the family moved to Southern California, where soon thereafter Richard enrolled in music classes at USC and California State University at Long Beach, where Richard and Karen soon discovered their musical talents complimented each other.\n\nAfter several years of making demos and enduring the usual rejections, Karen and Richard were signed to A&M Records in April of 1969. Karen and Richard\u2019s first major hit, \u201cClose To You\u201d exploded the following year. With her unforgettable voice, Karen was the star of the act, but Richard\u2019s behind-the-scenes contributions to the teams\u2019 success were enormous. As the chief architect of the Carpenters\u2019 sound, Richard arranged and orchestrated almost all of the duo\u2019s recordings. He produced most of them, composed many and played keyboards on all but a few. He also conceived, and contributed to, the duo\u2019s famed overdubbed harmonies.\n\nCarpenter received five Grammy nominations, recognizing his contributions with such signature Carpenter hits as \u201cClose To You\u201d, \u201cSuperstar\u201d and \u201cSing\u201d. His arrangements have been studied in numerous college music departments, including the prestigious Berklee College of Music and Stanford University. Carpenter is renowned for his ability to create memorable instrumental textures, with delicate interlocked string, horn and background vocal parts. In addition to his work in the studio, Richard took charge of finding the duo\u2019s material, often acting as a one-man A&R department. He spotted future hits in a wide range of sources, from a major Hollywood movie to a children\u2019s TV show. Richard found the Carpenters\u2019 signature song, \u201cWe\u2019ve Only Just Begun,\u201d on Los Angeles Television-as a bank commercial. The Carpenters\u2019 recording turned it from a jingle into a standard.\n\nRichard also teamed with lyricist John Bettis to write six of the Carpenters singles. Four reached the Top 10 in both the US and the UK-\u201cGoodbye To Love,\u201d \u201cYesterday Once More,\u201d \u201cTop Of The World\u201d and \u201cOnly Yesterday.\u201d\n\nIn his Rolling Stone review of \u201cThe Singles 1969-1973,\u201d critic Paul Gambaccini made note of Richard\u2019s role in the Carpenters\u2019 success. \u201cHeard together, the duo\u2019s hits prove that Richard Carpenter didn\u2019t study music at Yale for nothing. His clean arrangements, delicate piano turns and conservatively employed strings enhance almost every cut, and after a few tracks it becomes obvious his contributions have been grossly underestimated.\u201d\n\nRichard\u2019s arrangements have been highly influential. His arrangement of \u201cWe\u2019ve Only Just Begun,\u201d which blends the romanticism of easy listening with the pulse of pop/rock, provide a virtual blueprint for the modern \u201cadult contemporary\u201d format. Richard is widely credited with creating the \u201cpower ballad\u201d when he hired guitarist Tony Peluso to play a head-turning fuzz guitar solo on the Carpenters\u2019 1972 single, \u201cGoodbye To Love.\u201d\n\nCarpenter has been generous with his time and money. He is founder and prime benefactor of the Richard and Karen Carpenter Performing Arts Center, at the duo\u2019s alma mater, California State University at Long Beach, which bestowed upon him the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Fine Arts, in May 2000.\n\nRichard with his wife, Mary, have created the Carpenter Family Foundation which is a perpetual source of financial funding for causes ranging from medical to arts and entertainment, such as the recently opened Carpenter Family Theater on the campus of Westlake High School.\n\nCarpenter and his wife Mary, live in Westlake Village, California with their five children. To unwind, Carpenter indulges in his other passion-collecting cars, many which have been featured in automotive publications."}, {"url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/richard-karen-carpenters-biography-1258579/", "page_content": "In the summer of 1974, the Carpenters sat down with Rolling Stone writer Tom Nolan at Hollywood\u2019s Au Petit Caf\u00e9 for a cover story. Richard and Karen Carpenter, who had spent the past four years scoring massive soft-rock hits like \u201c(They Long to Be) Close to You,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve Only Just Begun,\u201d \u201cSuperstar,\u201d and \u201cTop of the World,\u201d took the opportunity to vent to Nolan about the uncool, wholesome image that they felt the press had created for the sibling duo.\n\n\u201cThis \u2026thing they\u2019ve built up, where it\u2019s implicitly understood the Carpenters don\u2019t smoke, the Carpenters don\u2019t drink,\u201d Richard said. \u201cNever would swear. Never would listen to rock music. It\u2019s like we\u2019re Pat Boone, only a little cleaner. As if all we do all day is drink milk, eat apple pie, and take showers. I don\u2019t even like milk.\u201d\n\nRichard can only laugh when the quote is read back to him nearly 50 years later. \u201cWell, that\u2019s what were described as,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was the way we looked and our audiences looked. The rock critics, they didn\u2019t like our audiences. It made the whole thing seem irrelevant, like we were nothing, and in no time at all, no one would ever remember us.\u201d\n\nThe new book Carpenters: The Musical Legacy tries to show how wrong that was. Written by Mike Cidoni Lennox and Chris May, the massive, definitive biography chronicles the duo\u2019s career in elaborate detail, based on more than 100 hours of interviews with Richard and full access to his archive. It aims to correct the legacy of the group, which is often overshadowed by Karen Carpenter\u2019s death from anorexia in 1983.\n\n1974 Richard Carpenter Collection\n\nEditor\u2019s picks\n\n\u201cBetween the TV movie [1989\u2019s The Karen Carpenter Story] and a number of unauthorized documentaries and articles, that\u2019s what a lot of the attention is focused on,\u201d Richard says. \u201cNot how successful we were and continue to be, nor Karen\u2019s voice and how timeless it is. It gets pushed to the back. The two of us are underrated, to this day. And we sell a lot every year, all over the world \u2014 still.\u201d\n\nThe book marks Richard\u2019s second time authorizing a Carpenters biography, after 1994\u2019s The Carpenters: The Untold Story by Ray Coleman. \u201cKaren\u2019s anorexia was much fresher,\u201d says Lennox, \u201cand he delivered what Richard calls \u2018the anorexia book.\u2019\u201d Adds May: \u201cHe\u2019s been down this road before, and he was very hesitant to do it again. We weren\u2019t sure if we were going to get his blessing.\u201d\n\nThat changed when Lennox and May approached Richard to write the introduction to their book. Lennox, a senior entertainment reporter at the Associated Press, and May, a music director and arranger, are both longtime Carpenters experts \u2014 they met online on a forum dedicated to the group. \u201cHe realized our hearts and background,\u201d May says.\n\nSoon, Richard was overseeing the entire project, and Lennox and May had gained his trust. \u201cThis was a book that intentionally didn\u2019t want to dive into their personal demons, and we make that point really clear,\u201d says Lennox. \u201cAfter reading the first draft, Richard said, \u2018You\u2019ve really got to deal with Karen\u2019s anorexia by the time you get to late 1973, and you have to deal with my use of Quaaludes.\u2019 These were things that he knew. The word \u2018authorized\u2019 can be a very dirty word, and here we were trying to just focus on the music. He pushed us into things and kept us in the nonfiction section.\u201d\n\nKaren rehearses at home, 1973 Richard Carpenter Collection\n\nHaving full access to the Carpenters\u2019 archives meant Lennox and May were able to provide an extensive history of the group. One chapter includes a Year in the Life, which maps out 364 days the duo spent in 1970 \u2014 from the release of their breakout single \u201c(They Long to Be) Close to You\u201d to their self-titled third album. Tour dates, television appearances, chart positions, and other major events are laid out in immense detail. This is somewhat rare, since many groups from that time don\u2019t have detailed records of their tour schedules, let alone the dates of photo shoots.\n\n\u201cWe were getting close to deadline,\u201d Lennox recalls, noting they spent four years writing the book. \u201cThere was a substantial amount of their gigs [that] could not be found. We finally said, \u2018Richard, we need a complete itinerary for the Carpenters.\u2019 He went downstairs, and lo and behold, he brought up Karen\u2019s itinerary, and in they were in [her] handwriting.\u201d\n\nThe writers used more than 200 images in the book, some of which showcase Karen\u2019s drumming. \u201cShe was a rare bird in that department,\u201d Richard says. \u201cShe was way beyond a novelty. There are more women playing the drums now.\u201d\n\nMore than anything, Richard says he really misses his sister\u2019s company. \u201cWe definitely liked and disliked the same things \u2014 a real friend where you could talk about anything you wish and you don\u2019t feel uncomfortable,\u201d he says. It also pains him to think about the records the Carpenters could have gone on to make. \u201cThat\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, she was only 32.\u201d\n\nNearly four decades after Karen\u2019s death, Lennox and May hope the biography will reintroduce the duo to a younger generation and rectify their legacy. \u201cMy hope is people will realize that the story of Richard and Karen Carpenter is not the most tragic in pop music \u2014 it is one of the most triumphant,\u201d Lennox says. \u201cThis gray cloud will no longer loom over this incredible work. I think the last thing in the world that she would have wanted was for her death to define her life.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.radioswissjazz.ch/en/music-database/musician/495839935657d026fb3380570ecc99c6f2b22/biography", "page_content": "Richard Carpenter (musician)\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nRichard Lynn Carpenter (born October 15, 1946) is an American pop musician, best known as one half of the brother/sister duo the Carpenters, along with his sister Karen Carpenter. He was a record producer, arranger, pianist and keyboardist, and occasional lyricist, composer as well as joining with Karen on harmony vocals.\n\nChildhood\n\nRichard Lynn Carpenter was born to parents Agnes Reuwer Tatum and Harold Bertram Carpenter at Grace-New Haven Hospital (now called Yale-New Haven Hospital) in New Haven, Connecticut, the same hospital where Karen was later born.[1] He was named after his father's younger brother, Richard Lynn Carpenter. Carpenter and his uncle both married women named Mary.[2]\n\nHe frequently played the piano while his sister, Karen, played baseball outside.[3] He and Karen also liked to listen to the children's records their father bought for them when they were young.[3] Richard was introduced to Perry Como and Ella Fitzgerald, among many others, and by age 12, he knew he wanted to be in the music industry.\n\nThe Carpenter family moved from New Haven to Downey, California, in June 1963. They wanted Richard to further his music career, and the family was fed up with the cold New England winters.[4] He studied music at the California State University at Long Beach. There, he met Frank Pooler, a conductor and composer. Pooler wrote the lyrics to the Christmas classic \"Merry Christmas Darling\" in 1968. He also met good friend John Bettis, who co-wrote songs with Richard.\n\nThe Richard Carpenter Trio and Spectrum\n\nCarpenter created the Richard Carpenter Trio in 1965 with sister Karen and friend Wes Jacobs. Richard played the piano; Karen played the drums, and Wes played the tuba and bass.\n\nIn 1966, the Richard Carpenter Trio played \"Iced Tea\" and \"The Girl from Ipanema\" at the Hollywood Bowl Battle of the Bands. They won the competition, and shortly after recorded three songs at RCA Studios: \"Every Little Thing,\" \"Strangers in the Night,\" and the Carpenter original, \"Iced Tea.\" \"Iced Tea\" is the only recording that was officially released to the public.\n\nAround 1967, Richard and Karen joined four other student musicians from Long Beach State to form a sextet, Spectrum, consisting of:\n\nJohn Bettis;\n\nRichard Carpenter;\n\nKaren Carpenter;\n\nLeslie Johnston;\n\nGary Sims;\n\nDanny Woodhams.\n\nAlthough Spectrum played frequently at LA-area nightclubs such as Whisky A Go-Go, they met with an unenthusiastic response - their broad harmonies and avoidance of rock 'n' roll limited the band's commercial potential. Yet Spectrum was fruitful in another way, providing the raw material of future success: Bettis went on to become a lyricist for Richard's original compositions, and all the other members except Leslie Johnston went on to become members of the Carpenters.\n\nCareer\n\nRichard and Karen finally signed with A&M Records on April 22, 1969. \"Let's hope we have some hits,\" Herb Alpert told the two. According to Richard, Herb Alpert gave them carte blanche in the recording studios, but after Offering, their first album, was released, and wasn't a big seller, it was rumored that some of A&M's people were asking Alpert to release the Carpenters, but he believed in their talent, and insisted on giving them another chance.\n\nAlpert suggested that the Carpenters record a Burt Bacharach and Hal David song called \"(They Long to Be) Close to You.\" Though Richard worked up an arrangement, only after Alpert's insistence, his arranging talents clearly shone in the finished product. His arranging and musical talents, as well as Karen's vocals, helped the song climb to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, staying there for a month. \"(They Long to Be) Close to You\" gained public recognition seemingly overnight. According to Richard, even though the song became popular overnight, the Carpenters themselves did not.\n\nSitting at home one night, Richard was watching TV, and saw (and heard) a commercial for Crocker National Bank. He recognized the voices of Paul Williams and Roger Nichols, two A&M songwriters. It was the song \"We've Only Just Begun.\" Richard made some calls to confirm their involvement, and asked if there was a full version of the song, which Williams affirmed. Carpenter managed to turn a bank commercial jingle into an RIAA certified Gold Record. It peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100, and has become a popular wedding song. The song also successfully launched the careers of Nichols and Williams, who went on to write multiple hits for the Carpenters, and many other artists.\n\nRichard composed many of the Carpenters' hits as well, with John Bettis as lyricist, such as:\n\n\"Goodbye to Love\" (one of the first pop ballads to have a fuzz guitar solo - #7--influenced the development of the power ballad [5] )\n\n) \"Top of the World\" (#1. Though the Carpenters originally opted to not release this song as a single, a version recorded by Lynn Anderson reached #2 on the Billboard Country charts; following the success of Anderson's version, the Carpenters decided to release their version as a single, and it reached the Billboard top ten.\n\n\"Yesterday Once More\" (#2)\n\n\"Only Yesterday\" (#4)\n\nQuaalude addiction and treatment\n\nWhile Karen was suffering from the anorexia nervosa that would ultimately claim her life in 1983, Richard suffered from an addiction to quaaludes. They had been prescribed for him by his doctor as sleep aids, but his use got out of hand. He eventually sought treatment for his addiction at the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kansas, checking into the clinic in 1979 for an eight-week treatment program, which proved successful.\n\nPost-Carpenters\n\nOn October 12, 1983, eight months after Karen's death, the Carpenter family celebrated the unveiling of the Carpenters' new star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Richard said in his speech, \"This is a sad day, but at the same time a very special and beautiful day to my family and I. My only regret is that Karen is not physically here to share it with us, but I know that she is very much alive in our minds, and in our hearts.\"[3]\n\nHe started recording a solo album on June 26, 1985, and finished the album on July 5, 1987.[6] The album was called Time. It featured Dusty Springfield and Dionne Warwick. Springfield sang \"Something in Your Eyes\", and Warwick sang \"In Love Alone\". Richard created a song dedicated to Karen called \"When Time Was All We Had\". It starts off as an a cappella, but then Richard's piano fades in, as well as Herb Alpert's flugelhorn. Lyrics included:\n\nOur hearts were filled with music and laughter, Your voice will be the sweetest sound I'll ever hear and yet, We knew somehow the song would never end, When time was all we had to spend.\n\nIn 1996, at the suggestion of music writer Daniel Levitin, Carpenter recorded and released Richard Carpenter: Pianist, Arranger, Composer, Conductor, which included reworkings of many Carpenters favorites, including hits and album tracks, and ends with \"Karen's Theme\", which Carpenter composed for the 1989 made for TV movie, The Karen Carpenter Story.\n\nIn 1984, Carpenter married his first cousin Mary Rudolph (daughter of his mother's sister Bernice). Contrary to popular belief, Rudolph and Carpenter are not biologically related, since Rudolph is adopted. Her brother, Mark Rudolph, was the Carpenters' road manager, as well as the radio call-in \"contestant\" in the [Oldies] \"Medley\" on the 1973 album, Now & Then. The couple had been dating since the late 1970s. A young Mary made a cameo appearance in the Carpenters' promotional video for the song \"I Need to Be in Love\". It should be noted that when Karen learned of the relationship, she was completely mortified and shared her feelings with her brother on a number of occasions, leading to a final argument where Richard told his sister \"We have had the tests done, there will be no problem if we have children in the future. So let it drop!\" Richard and Mary have five children: Kristi Lynn, Traci Tatum, Mindi Karen (named after his late sister), Colin Paul and Taylor Mary. The children and Richard sometimes perform music together at various Carpenter-related events. The family today resides in Thousand Oaks, California. He also funds an annual scholarship/talent show for people with artistic abilities that is held at the Thousand Oaks Civic Center.\n\nRecently, Richard helped in the productions of the documentaries Close to You: Remembering the Carpenters (1997) and Only Yesterday: The Carpenters Story (2007). He released the DVDs Gold: Greatest Hits and Interpretations. Carpenter is also mastering a new Christmas album.\n\nDiscography\n\nThe Carpenters\n\nMain article: The Carpenters discography Main article: List of songs by The Carpenters\n\nAlbums\n\nYear Title Notes 1987 Time Released in October 1987\n\nRichard Carpenter's debut solo album\n\nIncluded guest singers Dusty Springfield, Dionne Warwick, and actor Scott Grimes\n\nOut of print\n\nLabel: A&M Records\n\nFormats: LP album, cassette tape, compact disc 1998 Pianist, Arranger\n\nComposer, Conductor Released on January 27, 1998\n\nRichard's second and latest solo album\n\nIncludes instrumentals of popular songs of Carpenters\n\nDedicated to Richard's deceased mother, Agnes Carpenter [7]\n\nLabel: A&M Records\n\nFormats: Cassette tape (out of print), compact disc (out of print), digital download\n\nSingles\n\nSingles\n\nYear Song Chart positions B-side RIAA\n\ncert.[8] U.S. catalogue\n\nnumber Album U.S. Hot 100 U.S. AC UK JPN CAN AUS 1987 \"Something in Your Eyes\"\n\n(featuring Dusty Springfield) - 12 84 - - - \"Time\" - Time \"Calling Your Name Again\" - - - - - - \"When Time Was All We Had\" - 1998 \"Karen's Theme\" - - - - - - - Pianist, Arranger, Composer, Conductor \"Medley\" - - - - - - -\n\nReferences\n\nThe Carpenters Lists List of albums by the Carpenters List of songs by the Carpenters Singles 1969: Ticket to Ride 1970: (They Long to Be) Close to You We've Only Just Begun Merry Christmas Darling For All We Know\n\n1971: Rainy Days and Mondays Superstar Bless the Beasts and Children (B-side) Hurting Each Other\n\n1972: It's Going to Take Some Time Flat Baroque (B-side) Goodbye to Love\n\n1973: Sing Yesterday Once More Top of the World 1974: Jambalaya (On the Bayou) I Won't Last a Day Without You Please Mr. Postman\n\n1975: Only Yesterday Solitaire 1976: There's a Kind of Hush (All Over the World) I Need to Be in Love Goofus Breaking Up Is Hard to Do\n\n1977: All You Get from Love Is a Love Song Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft The Christmas Song 1978: Sweet, Sweet Smile\n\n1978 (cont'd): I Believe You 1981: Touch Me When We're Dancing (Want You) Back in My Life Again Those Good Old Dreams\n\n1982: Beechwood 4-5789 1983: Make Believe It's Your First Time 1984: Your Baby Doesn't Love You Anymore 1986: Honolulu City Lights Albums 1969: Offering (repackaged as \"Ticket to Ride\") 1970: Close to You 1971: Carpenters 1972: A Song for You 1973: Now & Then 1975: Horizon\n\n1976: A Kind of Hush 1977: Passage 1978: Christmas Portrait 1981: Made in America 1983: Voice of the Heart\n\n1984: An Old-Fashioned Christmas 1989: Lovelines 2004: As Time Goes By Compilations 1973: The Singles: 1969-1973 1978: The Singles: 1974-1978 1985: Yesterday Once More 1991: From The Top 1995: Interpretations\n\n1997: Love Songs 1998: Reflections 2000: The Singles: 1969-1981 2002: The Essential Collection: 1965-1997 2003: Carpenters Perform Carpenter\n\n2004: Gold: 35th Anniversary Edition 2006: The Ultimate Collection Television Specials/Series 1971: Carpenters: Live at the BBC Make Your Own Kind of Music 1976: The Carpenters' Very First TV Special 1977: Christmas with the Carpenters 1978: Space Encounters A Christmas Portrait 1980: Music, Music, Music!

The album features the revered musician, producer, songwriter, and arranger interpreting hits and personal favorites from the much-adored catalog of the Carpenters on solo piano.\n\nCarpenter brings his unique interpretations to some of the most beloved melodies in the entire pop canon, including such enduring hits by sister Karen and himself as \u201cClose to You,\u201d \u201cYesterday Once More,\u201d \u201cTop of the World,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve Only Just Begun,\u201d and \u201cRainy Days and Mondays.\u201d\n\nOther much-loved songs that he presents from a catalog that has sold over 120 million records worldwide include \u201cI Won\u2019t Last a Day Without You,\u201d \u201cI Need To Be In Love,\u201d and \u201cThe Rainbow Connection.\u201d He also offers a medley featuring \u201cSing,\u201d \u201cGoodbye to Love,\u201d \u201cEve,\u201d and \u201cRainy Days and Mondays.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSays Carpenter of the new project: \u201cI\u2019ve not only been into music since I was a kid, but records as well, and everything to do with them. In the late forties and early fifties, the Big Three labels were: Columbia, Victor, and Decca\u2026Bing Crosby was on Decca!\n\n\u201cWhen the label asked if I might be interested in recording an album of Carpenters songs on solo piano, I could only think of my Mom and Dad, and what an enormous compliment this was to their son, who never wanted to practise.\n\n\u201cBut this was a challenge. For somebody who likes to turn everything into a production, like our records, to adapt them for solo piano was a tall order, but the piano is a remarkable instrument, with a remarkable range, and I believe I\u2019ve given the songs chosen a fairly good reading.\u201d\n\nIntroducing\u2026 Richard Carpenter\u2019s Piano Songbook\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nThe announcement of the album is accompanied by two short video clips giving a flavor of the Piano Songbook.

He trained at the Old Vic Theatre School, and had a reasonably steady career as an actor, appearing in series like Z Cars and Emergency Ward 10. After acting gave him up, he turned to script writing and is best known for creating children\u2019s television series like Catweazle, Robin of Sherwood, and my own favourite, The Ghosts of Motley Hall, which I used to watch on Sunday afternoons. I found it uproariously funny at the time \u2013 I wonder whether it\u2019s lasted?\n\nMany of his scripts were turned into novels, including his favourite Black Beauty scripts from the ITV series The Adventures of Black Beauty (1972\u20131974), which became The Best of Black Beauty. Black Beauty, for which Richard Carpenter provided 17 out of the 52 scripts, of course was another TV favourite of mine: not a great deal to do with Anna Sewell\u2019s book (well, virtually nothing if I am honest) but it had a horse \u2013 and how I loved that horse. Even at the time, Black Beauty\u2019s capabilities struck me as a bit unlikely, but I didn\u2019t care. The first notes of the theme tune have only to sound, and I am back at the age of 10, and obsessed.\n\nFinding the book\n\nEasy to find in its paperback printing, but quite tricky as a hardback.\n\nSources and links\n\nBiographical information on Richard Carpenter\n\nAn interview with Richard Carpenter on Robin of Sherwood\n\nThe Adventures of Black Beauty"}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/its-yesterday-once-more-richard-carpenter-recalls-1970s-pop-duo-2021-11-08/", "page_content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLOS ANGELES, Nov 7 (Reuters) - More than 50 years after \"We've Only Just Begun\" and \"Yesterday Once More,\" Richard Carpenter is looking back on the California soft pop duo with his sister Karen that ruled the charts but got a rough ride from music critics.\n\nNow he is telling the story his way for the first time in \"Carpenters: The Musical Legacy,\" a book based on hundreds of hours of interviews Richard gave to authors Mike Cidoni Lennox and Chris May.

The Carpenters began when, atthe age of 19, Richard Carpenter turned his talents to composing and arranging music specifically to spotlight the singing talents of his younger sister, the late Karen Carpenter Burris. Together the siblings experienced incredible popularity and sold millions of records. The two achieved international fame and won numerous awards until the untimely death of Karen Carpenter in 1983. Richard Carpenter successfully worked his way through the loss of his sister and resurfaced to embark on a solo career as well as to release a series of posthumous albums of music by Carpenters.\n\nBorn October 15, 1946 in New Haven, Connecticut, Carpenter began to collect records before he could read the labels. By age four he was already captivated by the world of music and began accordion lessons. He began piano studies at age eight, and although he favored the piano as an instrument he failed to impress his first piano teacher. It was Henry Will, Carpenter\u2019s second piano teacher, who noted that the boy was clearly engrossed with improvisation, arranging, and writing songs. Carpenter was particularly intrigued by musical scales and harmonies, and by the time he was 12, his musical talent was undeniable. \u201cHe was about twelve. The whole neighborhood knew that he was on his way to becoming a professional musician, even then,\u201d stated a family friend to biographer Ray Coleman. The boy hounded his parents incessantly to purchase records. He was not partial to any particular style; he loved all music. After three years of lessons, piano teacher Henry Will referred Carpenter for an audition at Yale Music School because of the boy\u2019s astonishing aptitude for music.\n\nDuring his primary school years, Carpenter was not a popular student, especially in high school. His classmates viewed him as odd because of his advanced preoccupation with music, which ran contrary to the interests of his peers. Shunning sports and other extracurricular activities, he started an ensemble of sax, bass, and drums with some friends. They developed an extensive repertoire and the ability to play on demand. At age 16, he participated in a professional recording session for a local New Haven group.\n\nCarpenter was 16 years old when his family moved to Downey, California, near Los Angeles. He transferred to\n\nFor the Record \u2026\n\nBorn Richard Lynn Carpenter, October 15, 1946, New Haven, CT; son of Agnes Reuwer Tatum and Harold; one sibling, Karen; married Mary Rudolph in Downey, CA on May 19, 1984; four daughters.

He also performed as a lounge act in his spare time while his was still in high school. After graduation in 1964 he enrolled in a music program at California State University at Long Beach, but becoming increasingly sidetracked by show business and performing, he abandoned his studies before earning a degree. He then formed the Richard Carpenter Trio with his younger sister on drums, and fellow college student Wes Jacobs on tuba. The group worked around the area in local restaurants, and for parties and other affairs. In 1966, at age 19, Carpenter entered his trio in the Battle of the Bands on at the Hollywood Bowl, and won prizes for the best instrumentalist and best combo leader. The recognition led to a short-lived contract with RCA records for the trio at the end of 1966.\n\nDuring the summer of 1967, Carpenter performed at Disneyland with John Bettis as a banjo and piano duo. That partnership ultimately led to a long-time song writing and producing collaboration between Bettis and Carpenter. All the while the Carpenters, brother and sister, continued working in churches and performing at amateur night shows while Richard Carpenter gave piano lessons on the side, to finance a new piano. At one point the duo teamed with Bill Sissyoev on double bass for an appearance on \u201cYour All American College Show.\u201d That performance earned them a commercial contract with Ford Motor Company.\n\nThe Carpenters\u2019 big break came when trumpet player and record producer Herb Alpert of A&M Records heard a tape of Karen Carpenter\u2019s voice in 1969. Alpert was determined to market the wholesome Carpenter siblings, despite the media\u2019s tight focus at that time with hard rock, hippies, and other more rebellious subcultures. Alpert signed the Carpenters to A&M records on April 22, 1969. Their first album, Offering, was released that same year. The album sold poorly, but Alpert resolved to try at least one more record. For their second release the Carpenters pulled an old Hal David/Bert Bacharach song from relative obscurity. The recording, \u201cClose to You,\u201d became a number one best seller by the summer of 1970, and launched the duo into the big time.\n\nThe Carpenters next recorded a song that originally aired on a bank commercial. The song \u201cWe\u2019ve Only Just Begun,\u201d was written by\u2014then unknown\u2014Paul Williams. Within weeks of its release, the song rewarded the duo with their second smash hit. Coleman quoted Williams\u2019s partner, Roger Nichols in reference to the Carpenters rapid success, \u201cThey [Richard and Karen Carpenter] had a frightening amount of musical talent drooling off them.\u201d Meanwhile the decision had been made to market the duo not as The Carpenters, but simply as \u201cCarpenters.\u201d Carpenters\u2019 second album, Close to You, was released in 1970, and they embarked on a tour of the U.S. later that year.\n\nWhile on tour they heard and were enamored with \u201cFor All We Know,\u201d the theme from the feature film Lovers and Other Strangers. The two decided almost immediately to record the song that became their third hit single. In 1971, \u201cRainy Days and Mondays Always Get Me Down,\u201d another Paul Williams song, was their fourth single to sell a million copies. Key to Carpenters\u2019 success was Richard Carpenter\u2019s talent for writing, selecting, and arranging songs to most effectively showcase his sister\u2019s beautiful and eloquent voice. In 1971 Carpenters were nominated for six Grammy awards, of which they won two: Best Contemporary Vocal Group and Best New Artist. Noted composer Henry Mancini was impressed so much by Carpenters that he offered them a song with vocal and piano scores, to record on their third album. That album, Carpenters, earned gold certification and won a Grammy Award the following year.\n\nRichard Carpenter and his sister earned a reputation as a pair of driven perfectionists and work-a-holics, yet down-to-earth at the same time. Seemingly unaffected by fame, the Carpenter siblings treated the members of their entourage as equals. When Jerry Weintraub took over as manager of Carpenters in 1976, however, the group was faltering between Karen Carpenter\u2019s health problems\u2014she had developed the eating disorder, anorexia nervosa\u2014and Richard Carpenter\u2019s addiction to sleeping pills. As the talented duo launched into stardom, they operated at breakneck pace, their schedule habitually overbooked: 145 concerts in 1971, plus a European tour; 174 concerts in 1972, plus live performances, television appearances, and an album; 174 concerts in 1973, plus an album and three television appearances. Additionally, Carpenter suffered a serious motorcycle accident that year. He broke his leg and his wrist, sprained the other wrist, and spent five months healing in casts, yet refused to slow his work pace. In 1974 there were 203 concerts and a trip to Japan, where the pair encountered massive crowds. Carpenters performed 118 concerts in 1975, toured Japan and Europe, and taped an album. Their schedule that year was too hectic even for the driven Carpenter siblings, and portions of the European tour overflowed into 1976.\n\nUntil that time Richard Carpenter\u2019s growing addiction to Quaaludes, a powerful sleeping medication, was not apparent. The Carpenters in fact were known to sip on iced tea during recording sessions and while working, but never to drink alcohol. At the peak of their stardom, during the mid-1970s, Karen Carpenter developed anorexia nervosa. Richard Carpenter, troubled by his sister\u2019s failing health, turned to alcohol, cigarettes, and increasingly frequent doses of sleeping pills. At the peak of his addiction, Carpenter was known to take as many as six pills at a time and then wake up in the middle of the night to take some more. In 1977 Carpenter was hospitalized in an unsuccessful attempt to quell the addition. His performance ability was affected, and by 1978 he turned over a significant share of his behind-the-scenes work to Peter Knight for their ho Wday album, Christmas Portrait Carpenter lost the strength to perform. Lacking confidence and concentration, he canceled engagements. He underwent treatment again in 1979, and his health improved. Carpenters released Made in America in 1981, a comeback album, and made a promotional tour in London. The album includes the Carpenter/Bettis hit \u201cBecause We Are in Love,\u201d written as a wedding song for Karen Carpenter who married Tom Burris in 1980. A second reunion album, underway in 1982, was never completed. Karen Carpenter\u2019s marriage quickly dissolved. She became increasingly ill and died of heart failure due to her anorexic condition in 1983.\n\nAfter grieving the death of his sister, Carpenter released his first solo recording, Time, in 1987. For the next ten years Carpenter became involved in a variety of personal and professional projects, before emerging with his second solo album, Pianist-Arranger-Composer-Conductor, in 1997. Carpenter, as always, maintained extensive control over the production of his music. At live performances, Carpenter interspersed an assortment of newer songs, mixed with reprises of vintage Carpenter tunes from the 1970s, plus classics from other composers.\n\nDuring the course of Richard and Karen Carpenter\u2019s careers, the siblings were hosted by President Richard Nixon at the White House to entertain West German Chancellor Willy Brandt on May 1, 1973. They won three Grammy awards and received a \u201cGeorgie\u201d award in 1971 from the American Guild of Variety Artists for Best Musical Group. October 12, 1983 marked the dedication of a Carpenters square on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Hollywood Boulevard. New Haven\u2019s Nathan Hale School presented a Hall of Fame Award \u201cTo Richard and Karen Carpenter\u201d at graduation ceremonies on June 19, 1991, and California State University Long Beach Campus dedicated the Carpenter Performance Arts Center to the duo.\n\nTime, A&M, 1987.\n\nPianist, Arranger, Composer, Conductor, A&M, 1997.\n\nWith Carpenters\n\nOffering, A&M, 1969.\n\nClose To You (includes \u201cWe\u2019ve Only Just Begun\u201d), A&M, 1970.\n\nCarpenters (includes \u201cRainy Days and Mondays\u201d), A&M, 1971.\n\nA Song for You (includes \u201cTop of the World\u201d), A&M, 1972.\n\nNow and Then,(includes \u201cSing\u201d), A&M 1973.\n\nHorizon, A&M 1975.\n\nPassage, 1977.\n\nChristmas Portrait, A&M, 1978.\n\nMade in America, A&M 1981.\n\nVoice of the Heart, A&M, 1983.\n\nAn Old Fashioned Christmas, A&M, 1984.\n\nLoveliness, A&M, 1989.\n\nFrom the Top, A&M, 1991.\n\nBooks\n\nColeman, Ray, The Carpenters: the Untold Story, Harper Collins Publishers, 1994.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nLos Angeles Times, February 17, 1997.\n\nOnline\n\nhttp://www.keyboardmag.com/features/carpnter/carpntr.shtml, (October 2, 1998).\n\n\u2014Gloria Cooksey"}]}
