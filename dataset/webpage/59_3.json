Prior to leading the USPTO, he held several executive posts in the legal department of IBM, the world\u2019s largest patent holder. From 2003 to 2009, he served as the company\u2019s vice president and assistant general counsel for intellectual property.

Kappos was born in 1961 in Palos Verdes, California. He was educated at the University of California, Davis, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in electrical and computer engineering, and the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a Doctorate of Jurisprudence.\n\nKappos spent more than 25 years at IBM. As counsel in the area of global intellectual property (IP) protection, he oversaw the protection of the firm\u2019s IP in the Asia-Pacific region. Then, in 2003, he became IBM\u2019s chief IP lawyer. Attaining the rank of Vice President and Assistant General Counsel, Intellectual Property Law, he managed IBM\u2019s patent and trademark portfolios.\n\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Kappos for the position of Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the USPTO. The Senate confirmed Kappos\u2019s appointment on August 13, 2009. As Director, Kappos prioritized the strategic navigation of a severe recession, the implementation of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), and the reduction of pendency intervals (the amount of time between an applicant's submitting an application and receiving a decision).\n\nIn response to financial pressures resulting from the recession (2007-2009) and a decline in business activity for the agency, the USPTO froze hiring and scaled back programs where possible. The outlook brightened in 2011 when Congress passed the AIA, which Director Kappos helped to shape. He then set to work implementing the Act\u2019s provisions, including the establishment of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, and restarting expansions and initiatives that had been interrupted by the recession.\n\nMeanwhile, Director Kappos and the USPTO succeeded in reducing pendency by several months. The number of unexamined utility patent applications shrank, too, as the backlog fell from about 750,000 in 2009 to about 609,000 in 2013. In the same period, the Trademark organization exceeded its targets for action and final pendency. In pursuit of greater efficiency, Director Kappos pushed for the replacement of antiquated information technology, reengineering many of the systems and processes that kept patent and trademark applications moving.\n\nUnder Director Kappos\u2019s leadership, new offices and institutions arrived that proved to be lasting. The USPTO gained a Chief Economist and its first permanent satellite location, the Elijah J. McCoy Midwest Regional Office in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nOther major milestones under Director Kappos\u2019s leadership include the issuance of patent 8 million and the attainment of fifth place for employee satisfaction among the 300-plus federal agency and agency subcomponents surveyed by the Partnership for Public Service in 2012. The USPTO had risen steadily in these rankings from 172nd place in 2009, just before Kappos assumed office, to first place, shortly after his departure.\n\nFurther reading\n\nDavid J. Kappos.

He is widely recognised as one of the world\u2019s foremost leaders in the field of intellectual property, including IP management and strategy, the development of global IP norms, laws and practices, as well as commercialisation and enforcement of innovation-based assets.\n\nFirm Profile\n\nCravath has been known as one of the premier US law firms for over two centuries. Each of its practices is highly regarded and its lawyers are recognised around the world for their commitment to the representation of their clients\u2019 interests.\n\nIntellectual property is one of Cravath\u2019s core practice areas and a cornerstone of Cravath\u2019s reputation as the firm of choice for clients with respect to their most challenging legal issues, most significant business transactions and most critical disputes. In the 19th century, the firm handled the telegraph patent litigation for Samuel Morse and mechanical reaper patent matters for Cyrus McCormick. Today, the firm\u2019s expertise covers the entire innovation marketplace, spanning the consumer products, energy, healthcare, media and entertainment, pharmaceuticals, retail, technology and telecommunications industries, among others. Cravath also advises on matters in connection with emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, blockchain and fintech, as well as data security and privacy issues.\n\nCravath\u2019s strength in intellectual property stems in part from the firm\u2019s unique culture. Cravath\u2019s lawyers are trained as generalists and, over time, as partners, many focus on and deepen their expertise in specific areas. As a result, Cravath has a dedicated team of IP practitioners with an extensive understanding of patent and other issues, as well as experience in a broad range of trial and transactional work, which enables them to devise creative and commercially practicable solutions to complex problems. Cravath\u2019s governance as a true partnership ensures that all clients receive the benefit of the firm\u2019s overall knowledge, expertise and experience.\n\nCorporate IP practice\n\nCravath has a broad-based corporate IP practice representing clients ranging from early-stage start-ups to global companies in contexts across the full spectrum of IP disciplines, technologies and jurisdictions. Its lawyers work hand in glove with the firm\u2019s premier M&A and financing teams to handle the many IP issues that arise in complex transactions, including issues relating to patents, trademarks, copyright, data, trade secrets, privacy and information security. In addition, Cravath provides strategic counselling, review and analysis in developing and managing IP portfolios, commercialising innovation-based assets and optimising IP rights to ensure its clients are maximising value from their intellectual property in the United States and in non-US markets.\n\nLitigation IP practice\n\nRepresenting both plaintiffs and defendants at the trial level, on appeal, in investigations or in an advisory capacity, Cravath\u2019s litigators are adept at handling a wide variety of matters involving patents, trade secrets, copyright and trademarks, as well as the commercial litigation that frequently arises from IP matters, such as antitrust and breach of licence claims. Whatever the subject matter at issue, the firm\u2019s litigators bring to each case a trial lawyer\u2019s courtroom perspective and deep trial expertise in a variety of matters. As a result, clients turn to Cravath to protect them from infringement of their most important intellectual property or to defend valuable products against claims of infringement. Cravath has supervised and coordinated IP disputes that span the entire globe. The firm regularly advises on national and worldwide IP strategy and the identification of patents and other assets that can be used effectively for offensive or defensive purposes. Its practice also includes participation in inter partes review matters.\n\nInternational clients\n\nCravath regularly advises clients based outside the United States on a wide range of transactions, including cross-border mergers and acquisitions, international capital markets and bank financings, general corporate and Securities and Exchange Commission compliance matters. Its lawyers also handle US litigation, international arbitrations and investigations for non-US clients, and plan, coordinate and supervise multinational proceedings. The firm works closely with a network of leading law firms in major international markets, each of which has demonstrated a commitment to achieving the same high standards that clients expect from Cravath.\n\nCravath and its lawyers have been recognised as leaders in intellectual property by numerous industry publications, including Chambers USA, Chambers Global, The Legal 500 US, Benchmark Litigation, The Best Lawyers in America, Law360, Managing Intellectual Property, U.S. News-Best Lawyers\u2019 Best Law Firms and IAM."}, {"url": "https://www.fedsoc.org/contributors/david-kappos", "page_content": "Please Enable Cookies\n\nwww.fedsoc.org is using a security service for protection against online attacks.

He came to UC Davis with a respectable grade-point average; then, during his first quarter, he scored an A-plus \u2014 well above the rest of the class \u2014 in a chemistry course taught by Professor Dino Tinti (later emeritus).\n\nTinti subsequently wrote the young student a short note of encouragement.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018You could have a future,\u2019 \u201d Kappos recalled, in a 2010 interview. \u201cThat was the first time an academic in a position of authority had said that to me, and it had a big impact.\u201d\n\nIndeed. Kappos earned a bachelor of science in electrical and computer engineering from UC Davis in 1983, then followed that with a law degree from UC Berkeley in 1990. His subsequent career in the intellectual property field led to a stint as vice president and assistant general counsel for intellectual property at IBM, where he managed worldwide intellectual property operations.\n\nIn August 2009, Kappos became the Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property, and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\n\n\u201cI work harder than anybody else,\u201d he confessed, during that 2010 interview. \u201cYou get the best results in any deal not because you\u2019re the smartest or the flashiest, but because you\u2019re the last one standing. I learned that at UC Davis.\u201d\n\nIn April 2010, Kappos visited UC Davis to discuss his view that when transferring technology from the laboratory to the marketplace, universities must champion a new method based on long-term relationships with commercial partners. The idea is to simplify negotiations and quickly introduce inventions into the community: an approach that can generate more funding than if universities rely solely on long-shot \u201cblockbuster\u201d patents to pay off.\n\nKappos also encourages \u201chumanitarian IP\u201d: innovative licensing models that make products available at low cost. One such example is the San Francisco Bay Area\u2019s Gilead Sciences, which has licensed Indian companies to manufacture its anti-human immunodeficiency virus drugs for export to Africa, while charging only a modest royalty payment.\n\nWhen relaxing at home, Kappos\u2019 favorite sport is ice hockey, and he cites Sherlock Holmes as his \u201cfavorite fictional inventor.\u201d He regards Jules Verne as the world\u2019s most significant science fiction visionary, but refuses to choose between Star Trek and Star Wars. (\u201cThey\u2019re both great!\u201d)\n\nIn June 2011, Kappos gave an address to graduates of the UC Davis College of Engineering. No doubt recalling the encouragement he had received, years earlier, he was similarly inspiring to this next generation:\n\n\u201cThe power to innovate is the power to lead,\u201d he said, \u201cby creating, solving and doing.\u201d"}]}
