On television he also ran a good line in eminent characters from history: Percy Grainger in Ken Russell\u2019s Song of Summer (1968), Sir Anthony Babington in Elizabeth R (1971), John Ruskin in The Love School (1975), William Wilberforce in The Fight Against Slavery (1975) and William Pitt in Prince Regent (1979).\n\nHe was born in Brighton, East Sussex, to George Collings, a greengrocer, and his wife, Lillian (nee Parsons). At Varndean grammar school he enjoyed acting but had no thoughts of setting out to be a professional actor and, on leaving, started work as a designer in lettering, inheriting that interest from his father, a keen artist. From 1960 he was happily involved in amateur dramatics for the Withdean Players and the Lewes Little theatre, but then was recommended by the actor Freda Dowie to the director David Scase, who had been appointed to run the Liverpool Rep.\n\nAfter six months in rep, Collings found himself pitched into television through another unsolicited recommendation, this time from the actor John Slater, who thought he might be suitable casting in a 1964 Play of the Week presentation of Crime and Punishment. Thus he found himself playing the impoverished tragic hero, Raskolnikov, murderer of an old pawnbroker, in a three-and-a-half hour existential epic alongside Steven Berkoff, Peter Bowles, Julia Foster and Sylvia Coleridge.\n\nFive years later, in 1969, he was in another mighty Dostoevsky production, a BBC version in six episodes of The Possessed, as the charismatic rabble-rouser Pyotr Verkhovensky, alongside Rosalie Crutchley, Joan Hickson and Angela Pleasence. In the same year he was the Clerk in a BBC adaptation in seven long episodes of Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales, with Barbara Jefford as the Wife of Bath and Barry Linehan as the Miller.\n\nHe made a rare feature movie appearance as a lovable Bob Cratchit in the musical Scrooge (1970), with Albert Finney, in the same year as he was captured by aliens and imbued with superhuman powers in UFO. In Doctor Who he was an alien himself, in a rubber mask, with ideas of blowing up the Cybermen with a home-made rocket in 1975; a robot-phobic, Poul, in a 1977 narrative that found him crawling round the floor and sobbing; and in 1983, Peter Davison having succeeded Tom Baker in the title role, he was mistaken for the good doctor before mutating into a mutant with a wild spaghetti hairstyle.\n\nCollings as Bob Cratchit in the 1970 film Scrooge, with Frances Cuka as his wife. Photograph: Allstar/Waterbury\n\nPausing only to play Legolas in Lord of the Rings on BBC Radio 4 in 1981, and a guest appearance in the final wipe-out episode of Blake\u2019s 7, Collings joined the RSC for the first time as Newman Noggs in the 1985 revival of David Edgar\u2019s Nicholas Nickleby on tour and on Broadway. He also appeared in a star-studded chorus in the fine Don Taylor television script of Sophocles\u2019 Oedipus (1986), with Michael Pennington, Claire Bloom and John Gielgud.\n\nFor the RSC subsequently, between 1996 and 2001, he played Thomas Cranmer in Henry VIII, Baron de Charlus in Tennessee Williams\u2019s Camino Real, Count Lerma in Schiller\u2019s Don Carlos, Sir Politic Would-Be in Ben Jonson\u2019s Volpone, Cardinal Pandulph in King John and Sancho in Lope de Vega\u2019s Madness in Valencia. You could not devise a more varied roster of roles, but he discharged them all with a bitter charm and watchful, wary eye.\n\nIn this millennium, he played a neat double of Sir Henry Green and the Duke of Surrey in Kevin Spacey\u2019s Richard II (2005), directed by Trevor Nunn at the Old Vic, and graced a startling revival of Middleton and Rowley\u2019s Jacobean shocker The Changeling (2006) for Declan Donnellan\u2019s Cheek by Jowl company at the Barbican; the cast also included Will Keen, Olivia Williams and an unknown but tremendous Tom Hiddleston.\n\nA favourite \u201cjob\u201d was appearing with his son, Samuel, in Toby Frow\u2019s 1950s revival of Marlowe\u2019s Edward II at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, in 2011; he was old Mortimer and Matrevis while Sam doubled as the king\u2019s lover, Piers Gaveston, and his poker-wielding murderer, Lightborn.\n\nCollings was married firstly to Deirdre Bromfield, whom he met at the Lewes Little theatre, in 1962 (they divorced in 1975), and secondly to the actor Karen Archer in 1983, from whom he was separated, although they remained close friends. He is survived by Karen, by their children, Samuel and Eliza, his daughter, Kate, from his first marriage, and his sister, Nola.

You could not devise a more varied roster of roles, but he discharged them all with a bitter charm and watchful, wary eye.\n\nIn this millennium, he played a neat double of Sir Henry Green and the Duke of Surrey in Kevin Spacey\u2019s Richard II (2005), directed by Trevor Nunn at the Old Vic, and graced a startling revival of Middleton and Rowley\u2019s Jacobean shocker The Changeling (2006) for Declan Donnellan\u2019s Cheek by Jowl company at the Barbican; the cast also included Will Keen, Olivia Williams and an unknown but tremendous Tom Hiddleston.\n\nA favourite \u201cjob\u201d was appearing with his son, Samuel, in Toby Frow\u2019s 1950s revival of Marlowe\u2019s Edward II at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, in 2011; he was old Mortimer and Matrevis while Sam doubled as the king\u2019s lover, Piers Gaveston, and his poker-wielding murderer, Lightborn.\n\nCollings was married firstly to Deirdre Bromfield, whom he met at the Lewes Little theatre, in 1962 (they divorced in 1975), and secondly to the actor Karen Archer in 1983, from whom he was separated, although they remained close friends. He is survived by Karen, by their children, Samuel and Eliza, his daughter, Kate, from his first marriage, and his sister, Nola. He was predeceased by Deirdre and two of their children, Matthew and Bethian."}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/David_Collings", "page_content": "What we do.

He was 79.\n\nDavid Collings was an actor that was recognizable to many fans of cult British TV shows of the twentieth century. His many, many credits included Blake\u2019s 7, Sapphire and Steel and of course, Doctor Who.\n\nIf you\u2019ve watched much of the Classic Series, you\u2019ll likely have noticed that it had a habit of recasting actors in a variety of roles. Collings was one such actor, one who played three roles in the TV series: Vorus in Revenge of the Cybermen, Poul in The Robots of Death, and Mawdryn in Mawdryn Undead.\n\nOut of these three roles, it\u2019s his performance as Poul that stands out, due to the complexity of the character. Intelligent and highly observant, Poul is at first an ally to the Fourth Doctor and Leela. In fact, he\u2019s the closest thing they even have to an ally, at first. But over the course of the story, he starts to have a breakdown due to his deep fear of robots, and eventually snaps. Collings\u2019s performance of this complex character is one key reason why Poul was so memorable.\n\nBeyond the TV series\n\nOne of David Collings\u2019s final performances was as Poul in the second volume of The Robots, out later this year.Image Courtesy Big Finish Productions\n\nLike many other actors, David Collings\u2019s association with Doctor Who didn\u2019t simply end with the TV series. In 2002, he played Poul once more in the audio series Kaldor City by Magic Bullet Productions, this time going under the name of Paullus. It wouldn\u2019t be the last time that he\u2019d play the character.\n\nIn other audio series, he played the delightfully sinister villain Sanders in Series 2 of Jago & Litefoot, and was reunited with Tom Baker and Louise Jameson in the Fourth Doctor audio The King of Sontar, this time playing a new character called Rosato.\n\nMore than that, however: David Collings even once played the Doctor! Back in 2003, Big Finish Productions released Doctor Who Unbound \u2013 a series of audios exploring massive \u201cwhat if\u201d stories, featuring brand new Doctors. In the story featuring David Collings\u2019s Doctor \u2013 Full Fathom Five \u2013 we were given a deliciously dark take on our hero, one who went further than any we\u2019ve seen on TV. It\u2019s a great story in its own right, and well worth a listen.\n\nInterestingly, we\u2019ve yet to hear his final performance. A short while ago, it was announced that the second volume of Doctor Who audio spin-off The Robots would feature Pamela Salem and David Collings, once again playing their roles of Toos and Poul from The Robots of Death. It feels strange knowing that one of Collings\u2019s final performances was as one of his most memorable characters in Doctor Who.\n\nDavid Collings died suddenly in the early hours of yesterday morning. He is survived by his wife and his children."}, {"url": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/18377426.obituary-david-collings-stage-tv-film-actor-took-many-roles-royal-shakespeare-company-productions/", "page_content": "Born: June 4, 1940;\n\nDied: March 23, 2020.\n\nDAVID Collings, who has died of natural causes aged 79, was a fine character actor who could imbue the roles he played with watchful intelligence, prowling intensity, sardonic humour and detached melancholy as required. His soulful eyes could ignite vividly on his striking, yet sometimes doleful, countenance - under a lustrous mane of red hair - giving him an enigmatic, otherworldly quality that made him especially useful to science-fiction productions.\n\nAs Silver in the beguiling series Sapphire and Steel (1981-82) he was an eccentric, mercurial foil to David McCallum and Joanna Lumley. A popular contributor to Doctor Who \u2013 memorably guest-starring in three stories between 1975-83 \u2013 his powerful yet nuanced performances helped to ground the fantastical with requisite realism. Actor Mark Gatiss has described him as \u201cthe greatest Doctor Who we never had\u201d; Collings finally got to play his own incarnation of the Time Lord in an audio adventure for Big Finish (2003), capitalising on his vast experience in radio.\n\nIn BBC Radio 4\u2019s epic and strongly cast version of The Lord of the Rings (1981) he played Legolas, and latterly he was the perfect audiobook reader for the haunting stories of MR James.\n\nHis dusky yet melodic voice, perfectly modulated, also adopted an amusingly boorish bravado for the the title character in Monkey (1979-80),the dubbed English language version of the cult Japanese TV series.\n\nDavid Cressy Collings was born in Brighton, the son of a greengrocer. Upon leaving Varndean Grammar School he worked in retail before becoming an apprentice draughtsman at a design practice.\n\nHe joined the amateur company Lewes Little Theatre, partly to help with a speech impediment, and was spotted by actress Freda Dowie, who recommended him to the Liverpool Repertory Theatre. Whilst there the actor John Slater suggested him for a three-hour, live TV production of Crime and Punishment (1964) - and so, at 24 and with no formal training, he played his first leading television role.\n\nMore notable parts followed, in Ken Russell\u2019s Song of Summer (as an unforgettable Percy Grainger, 1968), Elizabeth R (1971, with Glenda Jackson), the BBC Shakespeare Julius Caesar (an intense Cassius, 1979), The Prince Regent (as William Pitt, 1979), A Tale of Two Cities (1980), Dark Towers (terrifying a generation of children as Lord Dark, 1981), and Press Gang (1989-93).\n\nHe also guest-starred in most popular series from Z-Cars (1965) to Holby City (2015) via UFO (1970), The Professionals (1978) and Blake\u2019s 7 (1981). On film he was an excellent Bob Cratchit to Albert Finney\u2019s eponymous miser in Scrooge (1970).\n\nHe was a gifted classical stage actor - his Mercutio at St George\u2019s Theatre, Tufnell Park (1976) was, according to Kenneth Branagh, who watched it as a schoolboy, \u201cthrilling\u201d and \u201cbrilliant\u201d.\n\nHe spent several seasons with the Royal Shakespeare Company, where his insightful character work benefited several good parts over the decades - a favourite engagement was touring with them from Stratford to Broadway in the 1985 revival of Nicholas Nickleby with his wife, Karen Archer, also in the cast, and their infant twins Samuel and Eliza (both destined to be actors themselves) in tow. He and Samuel also shared the stage in the Manchester Royal Exchange\u2019s 2011 production of Edward II.\n\nHe is survived by Karen, Samuel and Eliza, his sister Nola and step-daughter Juliet and daughter Kate from his earlier marriage, to Deirdre Bromfield. Their other two children, Matthew (12) and Bethian (aged just a few months), predeceased him."}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/240290079/david-collings", "page_content": "Your suggestions have been submitted and will be reviewed by the memorial manager.\n\nYour edit did not contain any changes from the original.\n\nThank you!
