Henry married Anne because he believed that he needed to form a political alliance with her brother, William, duke of Cleves, who was a leader of the Protestants of western Germany. He thought the alliance was necessary because in 1539 it appeared that the two major Roman Catholic powers, France and the Holy Roman Empire, were about to join together to attack Protestant England. That threat prompted Henry\u2019s chief minister, Thomas Cromwell, to arrange the marriage to establish ties between England and the Lutheran enemies of the Holy Roman emperor, Charles V.\n\nOn January 1, 1540, Anne arrived in England to meet her fianc\u00e9 for the first time. Five days later the wedding took place. Henry was keenly disappointed, Anne being less attractive than he had been led to expect, and he soon came to resent her lack of sophistication and her limited command of the English language.\n\nBritannica Quiz Quick Quiz: King Henry VIII\n\nWhen the alliance between the Catholic powers failed to materialize, the marriage became a political embarrassment and was annulled by an Anglican convocation (July 9, 1540).

Their marriage was marred by a lack of attraction on the part of both parties, and was annulled after several months. Anne of Cleves lived out her life in England, where she received the honorary title of King's sister.\n\nUpbringing at Cleves\n\nAnne of Cleves was born in Dusseldorf on September 22, 1515, to Johann III and Maria von Geldem. Her father ruled the Duchy of Cleves, a small territory in present day northwestern Germany, until his death in 1538, when Anne's brother, Wilhelm, became Duke. Growing up at the court, Anne was not educated in the manner typical of European royalty at the time. In Divorced, Beheaded, Survived: A Feminist Reinterpretation of the Wives of Henry VIII, Karen Lindsey commented that \"Anne enjoyed doing needlework, but she was lacking in the range of courtly accomplishments expected of an English noblewoman\u2014playing a musical instrument, singing, dancing, and the ability to converse wittily in at least one or two languages besides English.\" Anne spoke no languages other than German, which would later prove a difficulty in her marriage to an English monarch. Despite these possible failings, Anne was considered a desirable marriage prospect due to her family's political holdings. Anne became betrothed to the Duke of Lorraine, but the engagement contract was formally cancelled and the couple did not marry. This left Anne's family free to seek other marriage prospects.\n\nA Political Decision\n\nAfter the death of Henry VIII's third wife, Jane Seymour, in 1537, the king mourned for some time. However, political necessity demanded he seek a new bride in the late 1530s. Despite being married three times, Henry had only one male heir, who was still in delicate infancy; another wife offered Henry the opportunity to produce at least one additional son. Henry and his advisor, Thomas Cromwell, initially considered a marriage alliance with several other European powers, including France and Denmark. These possibilities did not lead to betrothals, and Cromwell urged Henry to consider a German marriage.\n\nBy late 1538, tensions between Protestant England and the Catholic powers of Europe had increased. The Duke of Cleves was Protestant, and the family was allied through marriage to a powerful Lutheran ruler, the Elector of Saxony. This made an alliance with Cleves an attractive one, and in March of 1539, Henry sent envoys to Cleves to arrange a marriage with one of the two as-yet unmarried daughters of the ruling family.\n\nEngagement to Henry VIII\n\nShortly prior to the arrival of the English envoys, Anne's brother, Wilhelm, had taken control of the duchy following the death of his father. Wilhelm was also Protestant, and welcomed Henry's envoys. However, as noted by Alison Weir in The Six Wives of Henry VIII, Wilhelm \"had strong ideas about feminine modesty, and when his sisters were brought in to be introduced to [the English envoys], they were so well covered with 'a monstrous habit and apparel' that the ambassadors could see very little of their faces, let alone their figures.\" Cromwell sent renowned portrait painter Hans Holbein from England to paint both Anne and her sister, Amelia. Holbein's depiction of Anne presented her in what was presumably the best possible light; court painters at the time typically painted their subjects in a flattering manner.\n\nSome today argue that Holbein did not overly misrepresent Anne. In Six Wives: The Queens of Henry VIII, David Starkey asserted that \"[Holbein's] painting \u2026 highlight[s] the woman's gentle, passive character\" rather than effectively altering her appearance. Regardless of the accuracy of Anne's portrait, the piece sufficiently pleased Henry, who appeared to be set on marriage negotiations with Cleves for Anne by that time.\n\nWhen the envoys from Cleves and Saxony arrived to negotiate on Anne's behalf in mid-September of 1539, Cromwell took charge of the marriage negotiations. The greatest potential problem discussed during these negotiations was Anne's previous marriage contract with the Duke of Lorraine. Such a contract typically forbade other possible marriages, but since both Anne and the Duke had been below the age of consent at the time of the contract's inception, the current Cleves envoys maintained that the Lorraine contract did not carry the force of law. Since the English government hoped to complete the marriage between Anne and Henry, they accepted this explanation. The talks passed quickly, and on October 4, 1539, a marriage treaty between England and Cleves was signed.\n\n\"The Flanders Mare\"\n\nThe marriage negotiations completed, Anne now needed to travel to England herself to meet her soon-to-be groom. Travel arrangements were debated before Anne's route was determined, overland from Cleves to Calais on the northern coast of France, and then across the English Channel to Dover and on to London. Because of Anne's status as a future royal bride, her traveling party was extensive, with 263 attendants and 226 horses. The party's progress was slow, and excited much interest along the way. Having left Cleves in mid-November, Anne did not arrive in Calais until December 11, averaging a little over five miles a day. At Calais, the party was stalled by poor weather. Between her arrival on December 11 and a delayed departure for England on December 27, Anne spent time learning Henry's favorite card games and presumably working on her practically non-existent English.\n\nAfter crossing the Channel accompanied by 50 royal ships, Anne endured an unpleasant winter journey from Dover. En route to London, Anne was to stop at Canterbury, Sittingbourne, and Rochester. The party arrived at Rochester on New Year's Eve, 1539, with the intent of arriving in London on January 3. Henry, however, had other plans. Having heard so much about his new bride, he determined to surprise her at Rochester.\n\nOn New Year's Day in 1540, Henry arrived unannounced and disguised at Anne's room in Rochester. She reportedly paid little attention to him until he left and returned again to reveal his true identify. What followed was by most accounts a somewhat awkward meeting. Henry left disappointed by Anne's appearance, claiming she was considerably less attractive than he had been led to believe by both his envoys' descriptions and the likenesses presented to him. Henry accused his advisors of presenting him with \"a great Flanders mare,\" coining a phrase which has become tied to the enduring memory of Anne of Cleves.\n\nHistorians today question whether Anne was, in fact, as unattractive as Henry claimed her to be. It seems likely that Henry had built up an unrealistic vision of Anne in his mind, and the relatively uncultured, provincial princess had little hope of living up to his vision. Because Henry first came upon her unannounced and unexpected, she was not mentally or physically attired for the meeting and probably did not come across in a favorable way. Further, since Henry disguised himself, it seems unlikely Anne would have reacted to him in a favorable manner that might have endeared her to the king. By that time in his life, Henry was aging and overweight\u2014probably not the type of suitor a young princess would have welcomed\u2014at least not without knowledge of his political status. Karen Lindsey noted that Anne \"can only have been dismayed by her first sight of this gross old man trying to act like an enthusiastic young swain. In the seconds it took to regain her composure, her horror must have been evident.\" The damage this horror would have done to the king's ego may be the reason for Anne's reputed ugliness rather than any actual physical cause.\n\nAn Unconsummated Marriage\n\nThe king hastened back to London, seeking a way to break the engagement with Anne before her still-planned arrival for their formal meeting on January 3. Anne's previ-ous marriage arrangements with the Duke of Lorraine were again discussed, and the representatives of Cleves again maintained that they could readily acquire proof that the marriage pre-contract had been properly and formally canceled. The embassy from Cleves convinced the English government of their honesty, and the decision was made to continue with the plans as already made rather than simply delay the inevitable and cause turmoil between England and Cleves.\n\nAnne and Henry met in a grand ceremony at Blackheath, near London, on January 3. The two rode to Henry's palace at Greenwich together, exchanging formal pleasantries and seemingly on good terms. That evening Henry held a grand banquet in Anne's honor, all the while still trying to find a way out of the marriage. The wedding was planned for January 4, but was delayed while the king sought an escape from the contract. None was found, and the couple married on January 6, 1540. Henry was not resigned to the marriage, despite the political alliances that had driven him to pursue the match originally. The morning after the wedding, Henry informed his advisers that Anne's unattractiveness had left him unable to consummate the marriage. Because Henry still needed male heirs, this inability presented a serious problem to the English crown.\n\nPolitical Shifts and a Marriage Ended\n\nChanges in Europe's political alliances complicated the king's lack of interest in his new wife. The forces driving the German alliance shifted; Catholic powers began making political overtures to Henry, and his Protestant wife no longer helped him consolidate his position. As weeks passed, the marriage between Henry and Anne remained unconsummated, and Henry continued to ask his council to investigate Anne's previous marriage arrangements with the Duke of Lorraine as possible grounds for annulling the marriage. In April of 1540, Henry began an affair with Katherine Howard, a young English girl and a relative of Henry's previous wife, Anne Boleyn. The marriage between Henry and Anne of Cleves appeared doomed.\n\nBy June of 1540, Anne had become aware of Henry's interests in Katherine Howard. Anne had herself admitted that her marriage remained unconsummated, and was presumably unsurprised when the king ordered her to the leave the court for Richmond Palace on June 20. On July 6, Anne was informed of proceedings to annul the marriage; on July 9, those proceedings were completed. Her entire marriage to Henry had lasted barely six months. Anne initially withheld her consent, but Henry offered her an arrangement that would allow her to remain in England under comfortable terms, in exchange for her acceptance of the annulment. Anne had the status of King's sister, use of a number of castles and estates, and a large annual allowance. Anne wrote to her brother, the Duke of Cleves, that she intended to remain in England, and accepted the state of affairs.\n\nLife After Henry\n\nSettling into life after her annulment, Anne of Cleves possessed a degree of freedom remarkable for women of her day. Although Anne was technically free to remarry, as her previous marriage had never existed in the eyes of the church or the court, she did not do so. She became friends with her previous stepdaughter, Princess Mary\u2014later Queen\u2014and lived briefly again at court during Mary's reign. The remainder of Anne's life was a pleasant one; she survived Henry as well as his other five wives, dying in London on July 16, 1557. Anne received a royal funeral and was buried in an inconspicuous spot in Westminster Abbey.\n\nBooks\n\nFraser, Antonia, The Wives of Henry VIII, Knopf, 1992.\n\nLindsey, Karen, Divorced, Beheaded, Survived: A Feminist Reinterpretation of the Wives of Henry VIII, Addison-Wesley, 1995.\n\nStarkey, David, Six Wives: The Queens of Henry VIII, HarperCollins, 2003.\n\nWeir, Alison, The Six Wives of Henry VIII, Grove Weidenfeld, 1991."}, {"url": "https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/historpedia/home/specific-individuals/king-henry-viii-the-marriages-and-religious-reformation-in-england-fall-2012", "page_content": "The reign of King Henry VIII of England was immersed in the rise and fall of multiple wives as well as religious changes in England. From the beginning of the Tudor\u2019s hold on power in England, great importance was placed on securing the throne for future generations. Having inherited this desire from his father, Henry VIII spent much of his time in power focusing on securing succession. As a result, Henry VIII had six different wives over his lifetime while only being the father of three legitimate children. While the role of specific individuals and religion permeated the reign of King Henry VIII, his multiple marriages were the focal point of his reign, and the marriages helped define not only religion in England but also a period of English history.\n\nHenry Tudor, also known as King Henry VIII, was born to King Henry VII and Elizabeth of York on June 28, 1491 in Greenwich Palace. King Henry VII won the English thrown in battle and became the first monarch of the House of Tudor; therefore, great importance was placed on securing an heir to the throne. He and Elizabeth had six children three of which survived past the infant stage. King Henry VIII was the second son in the family, so it was thought that he would join the church since his elder brother would take over the thrown. This future expectation shaped his early education, which had a focus on theology. Also, not a lot of information is known about his early childhood due to this expectation, yet it is known that Henry VIII had a Catholic baptism. Although a future in the church was expected, the death of the first-born son Arthur, Prince of Wales just before Henry VIII\u2019s eleventh birthday changed the course of his future. Henry VIII, the second born son, then found himself as the successor to his father, the King of England. Shortly after his older brothers death followed the death of Henry VIII\u2019s mother. Prince Arthur was married for only twenty weeks to Catherine of Aragon, daughter of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile, prior to his death. This was a major marriage bond that allied the monarchy with the powers of Spain and gave some legitimacy to the Tudor\u2019s hold on the conquered throne. Therefore, after the death of Arthur, there was a desire to preserve the important bond, so instead, it was planned to have Henry VIII marry Catherine. This plan of action however involved a very delayed process in which there were disputes about a dowry. In this specific matter, King Henry VII was unyielding. However, when Henry VIII was just under 18 years of age, his father died and left the thrown to Henry VIII. Now without the restrictions put on him by the past King of England, Henry Tudor officially had the power to make his own decisions. After a peaceful succession process, King Henry VIII quickly married Catherine without his father standing in his way. Both Henry and Catherine participated in the coronation to be the head of the English throne. This union marked the beginning of a series of marriages that not only defined King Henry VIII\u2019s reign but also the course of English history and specifically religion in the country.\n\nAs noted, King Henry VIII\u2019s marriages were a defining factor in the storied history of the Tudor monarchy and English throne in general. His marriages were extensive, tumultuous, and controversial, and they were directly related to policy changes during his reign. King Henry VIII\u2019s first marriage to Catherine of Aragon began in 1509 when he was just shy of 18 years of age. Shortly thereafter the marriage, Catherine had a stillborn girl; however, a few months later baby Henry, named after the King, was born. The healthy state of the newborn was met with celebrations, but seven weeks after the birth the baby died. Catherine had another miscarriage and another infant death, but then in 1516, Princess Mary was born to the royal family. After another bout of unsuccessful pregnancies, Henry VIII began having extramarital affairs with two known mistresses Elizabeth Blount and Mary Boleyn. Elizabeth Blount also conceived Henry\u2019s child, who was later given the title Duke of Richmond and died before having the opportunity to be possibly recognized to be next in line for the throne. As he became more and more disillusioned with his current wife, King Henry VIII pursued Mary\u2019s sister Anne Boleyn, who was in the service of Queen Catherine at the time.\n\nThis new relationship with Anne eventually developed into Henry\u2019s second marriage. However, in order to become married to Anne, his marriage with Catherine head to be annulled. King Henry VIII appealed directly to Pope Clement VII claiming that Catherine and his brother consummated their marriage; thereby, Henry could not marry his brother\u2019s wife. Catherine denied such accusations, and discussions went on for many years where the Pope stated that a new marriage should not occur unless a verdict was given from Rome. The pope chose not to annul the marriage right away. During this period many changes occurred regarding the English policy of religion, which became a part of the English Reformation. Without the guidance of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, Anne, who was partial to Lutheran ideas, as well as others who were not supporters of the theology from Rome influenced King Henry VIII. An occurrence of events followed that favored Henry\u2019s supremacy of the church as well as evangelical ideas. One action taken against the clergy in England forbade them from following orders from a foreign country or powers such as Rome. Another event that happened was when Henry was granted Royal Supremacy so that canon law could not be made unless there was permission from the King. Various other provisions were enacted that distanced the Church of England from Rome. Most importantly, the Acts of Supremacy were made, which stated that King Henry VIII was the supreme head of the Church of England on earth as well as stated a further separation of ties with Rome.\n\nDisregarding the Pope\u2019s rejection to annul the first marriage, Henry and Anne had a secret wedding. Very soon after the wedding, Anne became pregnant, and the court in England voided Henry\u2019s first wedding and legitimized the second. The Pope responded to the marriage by excommunicating the King from the Catholic Church. In 1533, Elizabeth was born to Henry and Anne, but shortly beforehand, the First Succession Act was passed by parliament, which declared Mary a bastard and Elizabeth the next in line for the English thrown. However, Anne had miscarriages and was not successful at producing a male heir to the throne for Henry. Around the same time, there was dissension regarding Henry\u2019s new religious policies, yet the King was able to thwart the opposition. The fact of Anne being unable to give Henry a son was a key factor in the beginning of Henry\u2019s third marriage and end of his second.\n\nHenry\u2019s third marriage occurred with one of Anne\u2019s lady-in-waiting named Jane Seymour. This marriage came about after many accusations were made against Anne as well as her brother and other men. These charges involved incest, adultery, along with scheming to murder the King. She was put on trial and sentenced to death. About three years after becoming Queen, Anne was beheaded, and her marriage with Henry was said to be invalid. Ten days after the execution of Anne, Henry married Jane. Important to note was that the Second Succession Act was passed, which said that Jane and Henry\u2019s children would be next in line for the throne and that both Mary and Elizabeth were illegitimate. Importantly, Henry was also given the power to declare the line of succession to the thrown in his will. Jane soon gave birth to Edward; however, she died in childbed, which led to the end of Henry\u2019s third marriage.\n\nAt the end of Henry\u2019s third marriage to Jane, a period of mourning occurred. However, the King desired to marry for a fourth time to solidify the line of succession for the throne. In order to secure an alliance with a country that was supportive of the reformation of the church, Henry married Anne of Cleves. This marriage was key because the Duke of Cleves was thought to be between Lutheran Protestant and Catholic ideas. Although Henry married Anne of Cleves, he soon sought to have an annulment on the grounds of not being attracted to his new wife as well as the threat to being pulled into a conflict with the Duke of Cleves and the Holy Roman Empire. The split was amicable in which both parties agreed their marriage had not been consummated. Furthermore, Anne was later called \u201cThe King\u2019s Sister\u201d and was given compensation in homes and money. This event allowed for the final two marriages in a reign defined by the royal unions.\n\n\n\n\n\nKing Henry VIII\u2019s fifth marriage was to Catherine Howard. Although there was about a 30-year age difference between the two, the marriage lasted about two years. However, Catherine was accused of infidelity, and after investigations, there was evidence of promiscuity before the royal marriage as well as after the marriage took place. Once found guilty, Catherine was executed. This event found the twice-widowed Catherine Parr having the opportunity to marry the newly available King. Catherine Parr married the King, and soon she made enemies in the court with her interest in religious reform. Although there was a plot to have her arrested, Catherine smartly manipulated the King and was forgiven. Additionally, Catherine had relationships with all three of Henry\u2019s children. During this period, an act was passed by Parliament that introduced Mary and Elizabeth back in the line of succession behind Edward. Catherine Parr outlived the King, who died on January 28th, 1547 at the age of 55. It is important to note that Henry was laid to rest next to his wife Jane Seymour, his only wife that gave him a son.\n\nKing Henry VIII\u2019s tumultuous reign dotted with unsuccessful marriages along with religious policy change was impacted by two major history forces. One of the most important forces that impacted his reign was the role of specific individuals. This force along with the force of religion were oftentimes intertwined and had an immense influence on King Henry VIII\u2019s reign, marriages, and religion. There were three clear examples of these forces working together to make an impact. The King\u2019s first wife Catherine of Aragon caused drastic changes to religion in England simply by proving unable to provide a male heir to the throne. By being unable to produce a son, Catherine forced Henry to make changes to the religion in England that gave him more power as well as supremacy in the Church of England while lessening the hold that Rome had on the English church. Catherine was one of the catalysts to the English Reformation. A second example to how religion and a specific individual provided influence in Henry\u2019s reign included Anne Boleyn. Anne assisted in the downfall of Henry\u2019s first marriage by attracting the King\u2019s attention, and she also introduced new Lutheran ideas to the King during a period where great changes were happening in the English church. Anne and her new religious ideas were pivotal in impacting Henry\u2019s marriage as well as religion in England. A third instance in which an individual as well as religion had an impact on Henry\u2019s reign was with Anne of Cleves. Because Henry wanted to align with powers that were supportive of a reformation of the Catholic Church, he married Anne of Cleves. This union involved a fourth marriage as well as underscored how religious forces, which brought the marriage together, were imperative to the reign of Henry VIII. Though the historical forces of specific individuals as well as religion were evident in King Henry VIII\u2019s rule, his time in power was made distinct by the numerous marriages that induced many changes in religion of England. King Henry VIII left not only a legacy of religious policy changes but also a legacy regarding his children and the impact they would eventually have on future generations in England.\n\n\n\n\n\nSources"}, {"url": "https://www.history.com/topics/european-history/henry-viii", "page_content": "Henry VIII ruled England for 36 years, presiding over sweeping changes that brought his nation into the Protestant Reformation. He famously married a series of six wives in his search for political alliance, marital bliss and a healthy male heir. His desire to annul his first marriage without papal approval led to the creation of a separate Church of England. Of his marriages, two ended in annulment, two in natural deaths and two with his wives\u2019 beheadings for adultery and treason. His children Edward VI, Mary I and Elizabeth I would each take their turn as England\u2019s monarch.\n\nEarly Life\n\nHenry was born in Greenwich, England, on June 28, 1491, the second son of Henry VII, the first English ruler from the House of Tudor. While his older brother Arthur was being prepared for the throne, Henry was steered toward a church career, with a broad education in theology, music, languages, poetry and sports.\n\nDid you know? An accomplished musician, Henry VIII of England wrote a song entitled \"Pastime With Good Company\" that was popular throughout Renaissance Europe.\n\nAs a young man, Henry displayed an admirable degree of intellectual curiosity, religious devotion and athletic achievement. One observer described a youth who \u201cspeaks good French, Latin and Spanish; is very religious; heard three masses daily when he hunted ... He is extremely fond of hunting, and never takes that diversion without tiring eight or ten horses ... He is also fond of tennis.\u201d.\n\nCatherine of Aragon\n\nHenry\u2019s brother and heir apparent Arthur had been betrothed since age 2 to Catherine of Aragon, the daughter of the Spanish rulers Ferdinand and Isabella. In November of 1501, the teenage couple were married.\n\nMonths later, however, Arthur died of a sudden illness. Henry became next in line for the throne and in 1503 was betrothed to his brother\u2019s widow.\n\nHenry VIII took the throne in 1509 at age 17, and married Catherine of Aragon six weeks later. Over the next 15 years, while Henry fought three wars with France, Catherine bore him three sons and three daughters, all but one of whom died in infancy. The sole survivor was Mary (later Mary I), born in 1516.\n\nHenry as Monarch\n\nHenry was an active king ruling over a prosperous realm in those years, and a leader in the English Renaissance. He lorded over a festive court while hunting, jousting, writing and playing music.\n\nHenry issued a book-length attack on Martin Luther\u2019s church reforms that earned him the title \u201cDefender of the Faith\u201d from Pope Leo X (a somewhat ironic accolade, given his eventual break with Roman Catholicism).\n\nHe made a significant investment in the Royal Navy, increasing its size from a mere 5 ships up to 53. But the lack of a male heir\u2014especially after he fathered a healthy illegitimate son, Henry FitzRoy, in 1519\u2014gnawed at the young king.\n\nThe Print Collector/Getty Images <em>The trial of Catherine of Aragon.</em>\n\nAnne Boleyn\n\nBy the 1520s, Henry had become infatuated with Anne Boleyn, a young woman in his wife\u2019s entourage. He also worried that his marriage to Catherine had been cursed by God because of the Old Testament ban on marrying the widow of one\u2019s brother. The king decided to seek a papal annulment that would free him to remarry.\n\nWith the assistance of his powerful adviser Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, Henry petitioned Pope Clement VII but was rebuffed due to pressure from Catherine\u2019s nephew, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Wolsey was forced from power for his failure and died in 1530 awaiting trial for treason.\n\nWith the backing of the British Parliament\u2014led in large part by Thomas Cromwell, Henry's chief adviser\u2014and the English clergy, Henry ultimately decided that he didn\u2019t need the pope\u2019s permission to rule on issues affecting the Church of England. In 1533 Henry and Anne Boleyn were married, and their daughter Elizabeth was born.\n\nThese actions linked Henry to the growing Reformation movement then sweeping northern Europe \u2014 they also earned him the enmity of Pope Clement VII. In response, the Vatican had Henry excommunicated in 1533.\n\nNonetheless, Henry\u2019s other daughter Mary was declared illegitimate, and Elizabeth was named his rightful heir. Then, during the dissolution of the monasteries, England\u2019s monasteries were closed and in most cases sold off to add to Henry\u2019s wealth\n\nKing Henry VIII ruled England for 36 years (1509-1547) and may be best known for his chaotic love life. The monarch\u2019s desperate quest for political unification and a healthy male heir drove him to annul two marriages and have two wives beheaded. His first wife was Catherine of Aragon, daughter of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain and the widow of his elder brother, Arthur. Henry became smitten with Anne Boleyn, but she had no interest in being a mistress, which is thought to have prompted Henry\u2019s annulment with Catherine\u2014and the founding of the Church of England. Eventually Henry lost interest in Anne Boleyn and had her beheaded in 1536. Days after Anne\u2019s execution, Henry married his third wife, Jane Seymour. On October 12, 1537, Jane gave birth to Edward VI and died from complications of the birth several weeks later. When Henry's minister suggested he seek a European alliance and marry one of the sisters of Germany\u2019s Duke of Cleves, Henry requested the women\u2019s portraits and found Anne to be the more flattering. When Anne arrived in England, Henry was shocked that she looked nothing like the painting. Because the arrangement had progressed so far, they married on January 6, 1540. Anne accepted a divorce and generous settlement six months later and lived in peace as the \u201cKing\u2019s Sister\u201d until her death in July 1557. Henry married 19-year-old Catherine Howard\u2014a lady-in waiting to Anne of Cleves\u2014in July 1540. Less than a year into their marriage, rumors of infidelity surfaced. With enough evidence that she had been at least promiscuous, Catherine was executed for adultery and treason Henry married his sixth wife, Catherine Parr, in July 1543. Of all Henry\u2019s wives, Catherine Parr had the most influence upon the widest variety of areas including court culture, religion, the role of women and the education of Henry\u2019s children. Catherine died in 1548, a year after Henry\u2019s passing. 1 / 6 : Imagno/Getty Images\n\nJane Seymour\n\nIn January of 1536 Henry was knocked off his horse and injured during a jousting tournament. When news of his accident reached the pregnant Anne, she miscarried, delivering a stillborn son. Henry then spurned her, turning his affections to another woman of his court, Jane Seymour.\n\nWithin six months, Henry had Anne executed for treason and incest. He then married Jane, who quickly gave him a son (the future Edward VI), although she died 12 days after giving birth.\n\nAnne of Cleves\n\nHenry\u2019s fourth marriage bore similarities to his first. Anne of Cleves was a political bride, chosen to cement an alliance with her brother, the ruler of a Protestant duchy in Germany. The marriage only lasted a few days before Henry had it annulled. He then married Catherine Howard, but two years later she too was beheaded for treason and adultery.\n\nIn the last years of his reign Henry grew moody, suspicious and famously obese, hobbled by personal intrigues and by the persistent leg wound from his jousting injury. His final marriage, to the widow Catherine Parr in 1543, saw his reconciliation with Mary and Elizabeth, who were restored to the line of succession.\n\nREAD MORE: Who Were the Six Wives of Henry VIII?\n\nDeath and Legacy\n\nHenry VIII died at age 55 on January 28, 1547.

The king with six wives clearly enjoyed being married even if those he tied the knot with ended up less than impressed. However, Henry didn\u2019t like to make a fuss about his weddings. He preferred a discreet and often private ceremony and several of his brides weren\u2019t confirmed publicly as his consort until after their marriages.\n\nCatherine of Aragon, June 1509\n\nHenry\u2019s first wedding set the template for the many other that would follow. Despite being a brand new king, desperately in love with his royal bride, Henry chose a private ceremony as he said \u2018I do\u2019 to Catherine of Aragon. The young monarch, still several weeks short of his 18th birthday, wed his brother\u2019s widow at the Church of the Observant Friars outside Greenwich Palace on June 11th 1509.\n\nTheir wedding had been talked about since the death of Henry\u2019s older sibling, Arthur, in 1502 but had been stalled time and again until the new king took power. The couple were apparently happy for a long time until Henry met Anne Boleyn and began proceedings to end the union, claiming his marriage was invalid as his wife had been wed to his brother. After six years of wrangling, Henry finally got his way and in early 1533, Catherine was divorced and given the title of Dowager Princess of Wales. She died at Kimbolton Castle in January 1536.\n\nAnne Boleyn, November 1532 and January 1533\n\nHenry turned the world he knew upside down again to bring about his second marriage but he ended up wedding Anne Boleyn twice, just to be sure their union was legitimate. The king had decided a new queen would be a good move as early as 1525 but his first wife had other ideas and getting his own way proved harder than Henry had hoped for. By the autumn of 1532, he had allies in very useful places and, having taken Anne on a visit to France with him, the king arranged a secret marriage ceremony with her on their return to England. They were wed privately in Dover in November 1532.\n\nHowever, Henry was still technically married to Catherine. On January 25th 1533, when Anne was in the early stages of pregnancy, she and Henry married again in another private ceremony at Whitehall Palace in London. On May 23rd 1533, the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, ruled that Henry\u2019s marriage to Catherine was invalid. Five days later, he declared Henry and Anne\u2019s marriage valid. The union would prove to be brief, however. In May 1536, Anne was arrested on charges of treason and adultery and executed at the Tower of London on May 19th that year.\n\nJane Seymour, May 1536\n\nHenry\u2019s third queen would give him his longed for legitimate son but her later reputation for meekness is at odds with her royal wedding. For Jane Seymour married her king just eleven days after his previous wife had been beheaded on his orders.\n\nHenry\u2019s interest in her dated back several months. He visited her family home at Wolf Hall in Wiltshire in the autumn of 1535 and by the following spring, was showing a clear interest in Jane whose ambitious brothers were already rising in favour at court. Within twenty four hours of Anne\u2019s execution, Jane was betrothed to Henry and they married on May 30th 1536 in the Queen\u2019s\u2019 Closet at Whitehall Palace, London. Jane gave birth to a son, Edward, on October 12th 1537 but died of complications on October 24th. She was buried at St. George\u2019s Chapel, Windsor where Henry was eventually laid to rest beside her.\n\nAnne of Cleves, January 1540\n\nAnother bride, another small ceremony. Henry VIII famously thought better of his fourth marriage before it had even happened but diplomatic links meant that he and Anne of Cleves had little choice but to say \u2018I do\u2019 to one another in a low key ceremony at the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich on January 6th 1540. Henry famously spoke the next morning of not consummating the marriage and within weeks he was looking for a way to end the union.\n\nAnne agreed to an annulment and the marriage was dissolved on July 9th 1540 with the bride receiving a rather generous settlement. Anne lived longer than any of Henry\u2019s other wives, dying in 1557, a full ten years after her one time husband.\n\nCatherine Howard, July 1540\n\nThe man who arranged Henry\u2019s marriage to Anne of Cleves, Thomas Cromwell, paid with his life. Attainted for treason, he was executed on July 28th 1540 but Henry had other things on his mind. For that was also the date of his fifth wedding.\n\nThe king, now in his forties, had first set eyes on his new bride as she acted as lady in waiting to Anne of Cleves. Catherine was just a teenager and a relation of the Duke of Norfolk. Henry was soon besotted and hastened to arrange a private wedding to Catherine at Oatlands Palace in Surrey. The marriage was made public on August 8th 1540 and Henry made no secret of his passion for his new queen. However, in November 1541, she was accused of adultery and was executed on February 13th 1542 at the Tower of London.\n\nKatherine Parr, July 1543\n\nHenry soon had another bride his sights. Katherine Parr had already had two husbands and was making plans to take another when the king intervened. He persuaded her to marry him and they wed, in another private ceremony, on July 12th 1543. This time Henry chose to say \u2018I do\u2019 at the Queen\u2019s Closet at Hampton Court Palace.\n\nKatherine clearly impressed her husband as he made her regent when he travelled to France in the early part of their marriage. However, she made dangerous enemies and had to talk her way out of arrest, narrowly avoiding a trip to the Tower. She was still married to Henry when he died on January 28th 1547 but wasted no time in finding another husband, marrying again within months. Katherine died on September 5th 1548, soon after giving birth to her only child."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-VIII-king-of-England/Legacy", "page_content": "Legacy of Henry VIII\n\nAs king of England from 1509 to 1547, Henry VIII presided over the beginnings of the English Reformation, which was unleashed by his own matrimonial involvements, even though he never abandoned the fundamentals of the Roman Catholic faith. Though exceptionally well served by a succession of brilliant ministers, Henry turned upon them all; those he elevated, he invariably cast down again. He was attracted to humanist learning and was something of an intellectual himself, but he was responsible for the deaths of the outstanding English humanists of the day. Though six times married, he left a minor heir and a dangerously complicated succession problem. Of his six wives, two joined a large tally of eminent persons executed for alleged treason; yet otherwise his regime observed the law of the land with painful particularity. Formidable in appearance, in memory, and in mind, and fearsome of temper, he yet attracted genuine devotion and knew how to charm people. Monstrously egotistical and surrounded by adulation, he nevertheless kept a reasonable grasp on the possible; forever taking false steps in politics, he emerged essentially unbeaten and superficially successful in nearly everything he attempted to do.\n\nHenry VIII has always seemed the very embodiment of true monarchy. Even his evil deeds, never forgotten, have been somehow amalgamated into a memory of greatness. He gave his nation what it wanted: a visible symbol of its nationhood. He also had done something toward giving it a better government, a useful navy, a start on religious reform and social improvement. But he was not a great man in any sense. Although a leader in every fibre of his being, he little understood where he was leading his nation. But, if he was neither statesman nor prophet, he also was neither the blood-stained monster of one tradition nor the rowdy bon vivant of another. Though cold, self-centred, ungiving, forever suspicious of the ways of the world, he could not descend to the second stereotype; despite a ruthlessness fed by self-righteousness, he never took the pleasure in killing required of the first. Simply, he never understood why the life of so well-meaning a man should have been beset by so many unmerited troubles."}, {"url": "https://www.historyextra.com/period/tudor/henry-viii-marriages-royal-wedding-six-wives-marriages-katherine-catherine-aragon-anne-boleyn/", "page_content": "Henry VIII\u2019s six weddings were all private. When, not quite 18, he became king in 1509, it was a matter of political and dynastic necessity that he marry and beget an heir as soon as possible, to ensure the continuation of the Tudor dynasty. Surviving members of the rival House of York arguably had a better claim to the throne than Henry, and the spectre of the Wars of the Roses still loomed large .\n\nToday, we associate royal weddings with great public celebrations, a grand procession, a magnificent ceremony in Westminster Abbey, St Paul\u2019s Cathedral or St George\u2019s Chapel at Windsor, and a public appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. The modern royal wedding, as we know it, dates only from 1840, when Queen Victoria married Prince Albert . Prior to that, royal weddings were usually private affairs, solemnised in the royal chapels with little public fanfare. So what would a wedding have looked like for England\u2019s most married monarch, Henry VIII ? Read on and find out...\n\nThe new King\u2019s councillors urged him to marry Katherine of Aragon, the Spanish princess to whom he had been betrothed since 1503 and the widow of his late elder brother, Arthur, Prince of Wales. Katherine had a great dowry, and the prospect of war with France \u2013 England\u2019s hereditary enemy \u2013 made an alliance with Spain all the more desirable. Her father, King Ferdinand of Aragon, was pressing Henry to marry her immediately, and promising him many political advantages if he did so.\n\nBut Henry hesitated. He was uneasy in his conscience, wondering if he would commit a sin by marrying the widow of his deceased brother, as such unions were forbidden in Scripture. King Ferdinand hastened to reassure him that the marriage would be perfectly lawful, as the Pope had given a dispensation for it. He felt certain that Henry would enjoy the greatest happiness with Katherine, and leave numerous children behind him.\n\nThe Privy Council also put pressure on the King. \u201cWe have the Pope\u2019s dispensation,\u201d they said. \u201cWill you be more scrupulous than he is?\u201d\n\nWatch: Tracy Borman on everything you needed to know about the Tudors (but were too afraid to ask)\n\nHenry agreed that there were many good reasons for the marriage. Above all, he declared, he desired Katherine above all women; he loved her and longed to wed her. Despite her six years\u2019 seniority, he found her attractive, with her long golden hair and fair skin, her dignity, lineage and graciousness. Everything about her proclaimed her a fit mate for the King of England.\n\nWhat Henry felt for her seems to have been love in its most chivalrous form\n\nWhat Henry felt for her seems to have been love in its most chivalrous form, coupled with deep respect. And honour demanded that he marry her and, like a knight errant of old, rescue her from the penury in which his father had kept her, and so win her love and gratitude. It was a grand gesture that appealed vastly to the King\u2019s youthful conceit.\n\nOne day in early June, 1509, the King arrived at Katherine\u2019s apartments in Greenwich Palace. He came alone, dismissed her attendants and, raising her from her curtsey, declared his love for her, and asked her to be his queen. Without hesitation, she joyfully agreed.\n\nThey were married on 11 June, the feast day of St Barnabas, in the Queen\u2019s closet at Greenwich, with William Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury, officiating. Katherine wore virginal white, with her long hair loose under a gold circlet. After the nuptials, the small wedding party proceeded to the chapel of the Observant Friars adjacent to the palace to hear Mass. There is no record of Henry and his new Queen being publicly put to bed together, as was generally the custom, but there was never any doubt that the marriage was consummated that night, for Katherine became pregnant immediately.\n\nMore like this\n\nIf, as the evidence strongly suggests, she had emerged from her first marriage virgo intacta, the chances are that Henry too was a virgin on his wedding night. There is no suggestion in any source that he was sexually active before his accession. He had led an almost cloistered life, closely supervised by his father and his tutors, and it is likely there had been no opportunities for dalliances with girls.\n\nThe marriage of Henry and Katherine was proclaimed four days later, on 15 June. On that same day Katherine first appeared at court as Queen of England.\n\nShe had adopted as her personal badge the pomegranate, a symbol of fertility since ancient times, and yet she failed to bear Henry the son he needed to ensure the succession. Of her six known children only one, the Princess Mary, survived infancy. At that time, it was unthinkable that a woman should rule England and wield dominion over men. By 1524, it was known that the Queen would bear no more children, and by 1526, Henry had fallen passionately in love with her maid-of-honour, the vivacious, accomplished and ambitious Anne Boleyn.\n\nIn 1527, Henry began to voice doubts that his marriage to his brother\u2019s widow was lawful, and asked the Pope for an annulment, only to be kept dangling in hope for the next seven years. By then, frustrated and alienated, he had broken with Rome and declared himself Supreme Head of the Church of England, and Thomas Cranmer, his new Archbishop of Canterbury, had declared Henry\u2019s union with Katherine null and void, and confirmed his marriage to Anne Boleyn. Henry had not waited for the formalities.\n\n2 Anne Boleyn\n\nThe precise date of Henry\u2019s marriage to Anne Boleyn is a matter of dispute. A Milanese envoy in France thought that they had married during their visit to Calais in October 1532, but the chronicler Edward Hall claimed: \u201cThe King, after his return, married privily the Lady Anne Boleyn on Saint Erkenwald\u2019s Day, which marriage was kept so secret that very few knew of it.\u201d\n\nThe feast of the translation of St Erkenwald fell on 14 November, the day after Henry and Anne returned to England, but it is highly unlikely that they wed while journeying through Kent towards Eltham Palace, especially in view of the testimony of two people who were much closer to events than Edward Hall.\n\n\u201cThe King\u2019s marriage was celebrated, it was reported, on the day of the conversion of St Paul (January 1533),\u201d the Imperial ambassador wrote on 10 May 1533, while Archbishop Cranmer stated, in a letter dated 17 June 1533, that Anne was \u201cmarried much about St Paul\u2019s Day last, as the condition thereof doth well appear, by reason she is now somewhat big with child\u201d.\n\nHall, who revered Henry VIII, would not have wanted to imply that the daughter Anne bore on 7 September 1533, had been conceived out of wedlock. His dating of the wedding to the previous November was either based on incorrect information or was a tactful, deliberate error. There can be little doubt that it was the discovery that Anne might be pregnant that prompted the King to pre-empt the Pope and marry her.\n\nContemporary accounts don\u2019t paint Anne as a great beauty, but as sallow-skinned\n\nand swarthy. (Photo by DeAgostini/Getty Images)\n\nJust before dawn on 25 January 1533, a small group of people gathered in Henry\u2019s private chapel in Whitehall Palace for his secret wedding to Anne.\n\n\u201cIt has been reported throughout a great part of the realm that I married her, which was plainly false,\u201d Cranmer protested, \u201cfor I myself knew not thereof a fortnight after it was done.\u201d The officiating priest was either Dr Rowland Lee, one of the royal chaplains, or George Brown, Prior of the Austin Friars in London.\n\nPossibly the priest was informed that the Pope had sanctioned the marriage; a royal envoy had just returned from Rome, leading some to suspect that the Pope had given his tacit consent. As far as Henry was concerned, he had never been lawfully married at all and was free to enter into wedlock at will.\n\nAnne's failure to bear a son laid her open to the machinations of her enemies, who did their best to exploit Henry's increasing interest in Jane Seymour\n\nThe few witnesses were all sworn to silence. The marriage, and Anne\u2019s pregnancy, remained strictly guarded secrets until Easter Sunday 1533, when, \u201cloaded with diamonds and other precious stones\u201d, she went \u201cin royal state, openly as queen\u201d to her closet to hear Mass, with 60 maids of honour following her. Having at long last won her King, she had adopted for her motto the legend \u2018The most happy\u2019.\n\nHer marriage lasted little more than three years. Her failure to bear a son laid her open to the machinations of her enemies, who did their best to exploit the King\u2019s increasing interest in Anne\u2019s maid-of-honour, Jane Seymour. Accused of betraying Henry with five men, one her own brother, and plotting to assassinate him, she was beheaded on 19 May 1536.\n\n3 Jane Seymour\n\nHenry VIII was at Whitehall Palace when the Tower guns signalled that he was a free man. Immediately, he had himself rowed to Chelsea, where Jane Seymour was waiting. Their affair had been gathering momentum since the autumn.\n\nJane gave Henry the son for whom he had cast aside two queens already. (Photo by The Print Collector/Getty Images)\n\nThe Privy Council had already petitioned Henry to venture once more into holy wedlock, pleading the uncertainty surrounding the succession, for both the King\u2019s daughters had been declared bastards. A speedy marriage was both desirable and necessary, and on the day Anne\u2019s head fell, Henry\u2019s imminent betrothal to Jane Seymour was announced to the Council. At nine o\u2019clock the next morning, they were formally betrothed at Hampton Court in a ceremony lasting a few minutes.\n\nHenry and Jane were married on 30 May at Whitehall Palace. The ceremony took place in the Queen\u2019s closet, with Archbishop Cranmer officiating. Afterwards, Jane sat enthroned under the canopy of estate in the presence chamber. Some thought it strange that, \u201cwithin one and the same month that saw Queen Anne flourishing, accused, condemned and executed, another was assumed into her place, both of bed and honour\u201d.\n\nJane died in October 1537, after presenting Henry with his longed-for son, Edward. He mourned her deeply, but \u2018framed his mind\u2019 to marry again for the good of his realm.\n\n4 Anne of Cleves\n\nBut when he saw Anne, he knew he could never love her. He did everything he could to wriggle out of the contract, but in vain, and on 6 January 1540, he reluctantly prepared himself for his wedding at Greenwich Palace.\n\n\u201cIs there none other remedy, but that I must needs, against my will, put my neck in the yoke?\u201d he growled. Nevertheless, he dressed magnificently for his wedding in a furred gown of cloth of gold with great flowers of silver, \u201chis coat crimson satin slashed and embroidered, and tied with great diamonds, and a rich collar about his neck\u201d.\n\nWhen his chief minister, Thomas Cromwell, who had arranged the marriage, attended him in his presence chamber, Henry muttered, \u201cMy lord, if it were not to satisfy the world and my realm, I would not do that I must do this day for none earthly thing.\u201d\n\nInformed that his bride was coming, he proceeded to the chapel gallery. At eight o\u2019clock, Anne appeared, sumptuously attired in \u201ca gown of rich cloth of gold set full of large flowers of great Orient pearl, made after the Dutch fashion round, her hair hanging down, which was fair, yellow and long; and on her head a coronal of gold replenished with great stone\u201d. She was bedecked with sprigs of rosemary, which symbolised love, fidelity and fertility, and about her neck and waist were costly jewels.\n\nThis portrait of Anne of Cleves, painted by Hans Holbein the Younger in 1539, delighted Henry VIII. Unfortunately, the king was far less impressed with his new bride when he met her in the flesh. (Photo by \u00a9 Historical Picture Archive/CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images)\n\nPreceded by Cromwell, and walking between the German envoys with a most demure countenance, she made three low curtseys to Henry, and together they proceeded into the Chapel Royal, where Cranmer was waiting to perform the ceremony.\n\nThe King made no protest. Both he and Anne answered freely that they knew of no impediment to the marriage. On her finger, he placed a ring engraved with the motto \u2018God send me well to keep\u2019.\n\nAfter Cranmer had blessed them and wished them a fruitful union, Henry and his new Queen went hand in hand into the King\u2019s closet to hear Mass. Cranmer gave the kiss of peace to Anne, upon which the King in turn kissed and embraced her. Afterwards, they were served wine and spices.\n\nThus \u201cpassed that day honourably\u201d. The newly wedded pair were ceremonially put to bed together to do their dynastic duty. The marital bedstead had an oak headboard with erotic carvings of priapic and pregnant cherubs, but they had little effect on Henry. The marriage was not consummated.\n\nThe next morning, the King complained to Cromwell that he \u201cabhorred\u201d Anne. \u201cSurely, my lord, as ye know, I liked her before not well, but now I like her much worse, for I have felt her belly and her breasts, and thereby, as I can judge, she should be no maid, which so strake me to the heart when I felt them that I had neither will nor courage to proceed any further in other matters.\u201d\n\nHe made similar complaints to other courtiers, on many occasions. Possibly he was only saying what he believed to be the truth. Most likely he wanted an excuse for not consummating the marriage, so that it could be annulled without difficulty as soon as grounds could be found. As indeed they were, and in July 1540 it was dissolved.\n\nThe downfall of Thomas Cromwell The Mirror & the Light, the eagerly-anticipated final instalment of Hilary Mantel\u2019s Wolf Hall trilogy, focuses on the final four years of Thomas Cromwell\u2019s life, from 1536\u20131540. This also happens to be one of the most dramatic periods in British history writes Tracy Borman... Read more\n\n5 Katherine Howard\n\nBy then, Henry had fallen for a pretty 19-year-old brunette, Katherine Howard. She was a niece of the Duke of Norfolk, England\u2019s premier Catholic peer. Norfolk and his party had put her in the King\u2019s path because they wanted to see a good Catholic queen on the throne; Henry quickly became besotted and resolved to wed Katherine.\n\nToday, what remains of the Palace of Oatlands lies beneath a housing estate in Weybridge, Surrey. It was a favoured retreat of Henry\u2019s, and he took Katherine there for their wedding, solemnised in private on 28 July 1540 by Edmund Bonner, Bishop of London. For ten days, absolute secrecy was maintained.\n\nKatherine garnered a reputation as a frivolous character who cared only for pretty clothes. (Photo by The Print Collector/Getty Images)\n\nInfatuated with his bride, the King wanted to spend time alone with her before showing her off to the world. At last, it seemed, he had found a wife who embodied the qualities he most admired in women: beauty, charm, a pleasant disposition and, he believed, virtue. He considered himself blessed. Whether Katherine was as elated is a matter for conjecture, for her husband was prematurely aged at nearly 50, with a waist of 54 inches and a putrid leg.\n\nBut Katherine had a past of which Henry knew nothing, and it increasingly came back to haunt her. In 1541, evidence of sexual liaisons before her marriage, and adultery after, came to light. Henry broke down in tears in council, then called for a sword with which to slay her whom he had worshipped. She was executed in February 1542.\n\nHenry broke down in tears, then called for a sword\n\nThe tragedy left Henry miserable and lonely, but in no hurry to remarry. That was as well, because, according to the Imperial ambassador, there were few ladies at court hastening to aspire to such an honour.\n\n6 Katherine Parr\n\nAs time passed, and his spirits lightened, Henry began to seek a companion for his declining years, and proposed marriage to Katherine Parr, a comely, intelligent widow of 30.\n\nKatherine was reluctant to marry the King because, having been wife in turn to a sick boy and a sick man, she had looked to wed the gallant Sir Thomas Seymour, Queen Jane\u2019s brother. Henry, sniffing a rival, sent Seymour abroad and claimed Katherine for himself.\n\nSniffing a rival, Henry sent Seymour abroad and claimed Katherine for himself\n\nOn 10 July 1543, Archbishop Cranmer issued a special licence for their marriage and, two days later, the wedding took place privately in the Queen\u2019s closet at Hampton Court, amid much rejoicing. The King\u2019s niece, Lady Margaret Douglas, was the bride\u2019s chief attendant. When the King was asked if he would take Katherine Parr to be his lawful wife, he answered \u201cYea\u201d, \u201cwith a joyful countenance\u201d.\n\nKatherine proved an admirable queen, and a loving stepmother to Henry\u2019s children, who were all fond of her. She was popular, and it was said that every day was like a Sunday at her court. Such was the King\u2019s trust in her that, when he invaded France in 1544, he appointed her Regent of England in his absence. When he died in 1547, he left her a wealthy widow.\n\nHenry VIII\u2019s matrimonial career shows that the outward trappings of royal nuptials were only half of the story - the velvet glove, rather than the iron first inside \u2013 and belied the fact that the celebrations attending his weddings would be remembered as the ceremonial cover for an unholy and sometimes brutal alliance.\n\nBritish royal weddings: a potted history 1100 The first royal to be married in Westminster Abbey was Henry I in 1100. It has hosted over a dozen royal weddings since, most recently that of Prince William and Kate Middleton. 1328 Edward III chose York Minster for his wedding to Philippa of Hainault in 1328, even though it was still being built and had no roof. The king got a white wedding of sorts, as it snowed during the ceremony. 1464 Edward IV kept his marriage to Elizabeth Woodville a secret, as she was a widow and commoner. The exact date of their 1464 wedding is still debated. 1503 Henry VII considered a marriage between James IV of Scotland and his daughter, Margaret \u2013 a five-year-old. She was bethrothed (by proxy) in 1502, when she was 12 years old. Margaret didn\u2019t meet her husband until the following year. 1736 The teenage Princess Augusta really didn\u2019t want to go ahead with the planned marriage to the Prince of Wales, Frederick, in 1736. While on the way to the ceremony, she pleaded with her mother, \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me\u201d, and was sick immediately afterwards. 1816 The oldest surviving royal wedding dress belonged to Princess Charlotte, daughter of George IV, who married Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. It cost over \u00a310,000 (around \u00a3400,000 today). 1840 We have Queen Victoria to thank for the white wedding dress. Although not the first to wear white, her wedding to Albert on 10 February 1840 set the bar that all other brides had to match. Before then, any colour could be worn, including the rather funereal black. 1923 The future George VI proposed three times before Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon agreed to marry him. The wedding took place in 1923, and it was made a public event to lift national morale in the wake of World War I. 1936 There has been no shortage of scandalous royal match-ups, but when Edward VIII announced his desire to wed Wallis Simpson, twice divorced already, it led to a constitutional crisis. In 1936, Edward abdicated the throne. 1947 Elizabeth II\u2019s wedding cake was a towering nine feet high, over four tiers \u2013 enough for all 2,000 guests to have a slice. 1960 The first royal wedding to be televised was in 1960, when Princess Margaret, the Queen\u2019s sister, married photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones. 1981 Diana Spencer was so nervous at her 1981 wedding to Prince Charles that she mixed up his name during the ceremony, calling him \u2018Philip Charles\u2019.\n\nAlison Weir is a historian and bestselling author.

He accused Anne of adultery, and she was convicted and beheaded on May 19, 1536; that she had not given birth to a male heir was, however, Henry\u2019s primary motive for having her executed. Henry accused Catherine of having affairs before their marriage and of adultery, which led to charges of treason; she was executed on February 13, 1542.\n\nHenry VIII was the king of England (1509\u201347).

When he became king at age 18, great things were expected of him.\n\nAccession to the throne\n\nWhy did Henry VIII form the Church of England? See all videos for this article\n\nHenry was the second son of Henry VII, first of the Tudor line, and Elizabeth, daughter of Edward IV, first king of the short-lived line of York. When his elder brother, Arthur, died in 1502, Henry became the heir to the throne; of all the Tudor monarchs, he alone spent his childhood in calm expectation of the crown, which helped give an assurance of majesty and righteousness to his willful, ebullient character. He excelled in book learning as well as in the physical exercises of an aristocratic society, and, when in 1509 he ascended the throne, great things were expected of him. Six feet tall, powerfully built, and a tireless athlete, huntsman, and dancer, he promised England the joys of spring after the long winter of Henry VII\u2019s reign.\n\nHenry and his ministers exploited the dislike inspired by his father\u2019s energetic pursuit of royal rights by sacrificing, without a thought, some of the unpopular institutions and some of the men that had served his predecessor. Yet the unpopular means for governing the realm soon reappeared because they were necessary. Soon after his accession, Henry married Catherine of Aragon, Arthur\u2019s widow, and the attendant lavish entertainments ate into the modest royal reserves.\n\nMore serious was Henry\u2019s determination to engage in military adventure. Europe was being kept on the boil by rivalries between the French and Spanish kingdoms, mostly over Italian claims; and, against the advice of his older councillors, Henry in 1512 joined his father-in-law, Ferdinand II of Aragon, against France and ostensibly in support of a threatened pope, to whom the devout king for a long time paid almost slavish respect.\n\nBritannica Quiz Quick Quiz: Weird British Royalty\n\nHenry himself displayed no military talent, but a real victory was won by the earl of Surrey at Flodden (1513) against a Scottish invasion. Despite the obvious pointlessness of the fighting, the appearance of success was popular. Moreover, in Thomas Wolsey, who organized his first campaign in France, Henry discovered his first outstanding minister. By 1515 Wolsey was archbishop of York, lord chancellor of England, and a cardinal of the church; more important, he was the king\u2019s good friend, to whom was gladly left the active conduct of affairs. Henry never altogether abandoned the positive tasks of kingship and often interfered in business; though the world might think that England was ruled by the cardinal, the king himself knew that he possessed perfect control any time he cared to assert it, and Wolsey only rarely mistook the world\u2019s opinion for the right one.\n\nNevertheless, the years from 1515 to 1527 were marked by Wolsey\u2019s ascendancy, and his initiatives set the scene. The cardinal had some occasional ambition for the papal tiara, and this Henry supported; Wolsey at Rome would have been a powerful card in English hands. In fact, there was never any chance of this happening, any more than there was of Henry\u2019s election to the imperial crown, briefly mooted in 1519 when the emperor Maximilian I died, to be succeeded by his grandson Charles V. That event altered the European situation. In Charles, the crowns of Spain, Burgundy (with the Netherlands), and Austria were united in an overwhelming complex of power that reduced all the dynasties of Europe, with the exception of France, to an inferior position. From 1521, Henry became an outpost of Charles V\u2019s imperial power, which at Pavia (1525), for the moment, destroyed the rival power of France. Wolsey\u2019s attempt to reverse alliances at this unpropitious moment brought reprisals against the vital English cloth trade with the Netherlands and lost the advantages that alliance with the victor of Pavia might have had. It provoked a serious reaction in England, and Henry concluded that Wolsey\u2019s usefulness might be coming to an end."}, {"url": "https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/inspire-me/blog/blog-posts/henry-viii-and-anne-of-cleves/", "page_content": "Many people know the story of Henry VIII\u2019s most famous wife, Anne Boleyn. But how many know the details of his short-lived marriage to his fourth wife Anne of Cleves? Sent from her home town in Germany to begin life as a new bride and queen of England, things couldn\u2019t have gone more badly.\n\nBorn on this day (22 September) in 1515, Anne was the daughter of a prominent German duke. Her family probably had high hopes for the marriage to Henry VIII, the powerful king of England. Diplomatically it was a perfect match, but romantically it went wrong from their very first meeting.\n\nAlthough Henry VIII had liked the portrait Hans Holbein had painted of Anne, when he met her he was disenchanted, confiding in his principal minister Thomas Cromwell of his disappointment. He annulled the marriage only a few months after they declared their vows and on 13 July, 1540 Anne returned her wedding ring. She had been on English soil for just six months.\n\nWe take a closer look at Anne\u2019s troubled journey, following her footsteps from Germany and at several places where she stayed in England, now in the care of English Heritage.\n\nWhy Anne of Cleves?\n\nThe daughter of William, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berge, an influential nobleman with lands north of Dusseldorf, Anne was just 24 years old. She had been raised by a devoutly Catholic mother in a sheltered environment in Cleves (northwestern Germany).\n\nIn England, Henry had lost his third wife, Jane Seymour. Jane had given him a son, but now he wanted to secure his dynasty with another. Also, he needed to form an alliance to ease his political isolation following the reconciliation of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and Francis I, King of France. Both men had vowed not to ally with Henry and Pope Paul III was urging them to attack England.\n\nAlliances sealed by marriages were routine in the dynastic politics of the day. Cleves was part of a confederation of German states, the Schmalkaldic League, with its own political and religious troubles with the Emperor and the Pope, and was inclined towards independence and reform.\n\nAnne was part of the alliance deal, for which negotiations extended from March until October 1539. Henry\u2019s envoys and foreign ambassadors reported favourably of Anne, and Henry instructed Hans Holbein to travel and take her portrait. His painting, which survives, depicts an attractive and confident young woman.\n\nPortrait of Anne of Cleves by Hans Holbein the Younger\n\nFrom Cleves to London: Anne\u2019s journey to England\n\nAnne left Cleves on 26 November 1539 and travelled overland. It was winter and the journey was slow through Antwerp, Bruges and Dunkirk. She reached English territory, Calais, by 11 December. Foul weather kept her there sixteen days, but eventually she crossed the Straits of Dover on 27 December.\n\nIt was a grey winter day and though making for Dover, the ships were forced north by wind and tide. Eventually, several boats crunched into the gravel on the beach at Deal in Kent. Out of one stepped Henry\u2019s wife-to-be. This was Anne\u2019s first time in England and she didn\u2019t speak English.\n\nAnne rested for a few hours in the new castle at Deal in Kent, an unfinished fortress with rooms hardly befitting a future queen. Today, though much has changed there, you can walk in Anne\u2019s footsteps, in the apartments of the first floor, and view a new exhibition that explores her place in Henry\u2019s world. You can encounter Anne on the ground floor, where you can listen to her and other \u2018voices\u2019 of key players in European power politics at the time Deal was built.\n\nDeal Castle, where a new exhibition reveals Anne of Cleves\u2019 place in the world of Henry VIII\n\nFrom Deal, Anne travelled on, in darkness, to more suitable royal apartments in Dover Castle. These also survive today, on the first floor of the great tower, though much altered.\n\nAnne left for Canterbury on a stormy winter\u2019s morning on 29 December. There, she stayed in the former abbot\u2019s lodging at St Augustine\u2019s Abbey, which Henry was adapting as a palace with new rooms for his queen to be. Though ruinous, you can still see the site of these apartments today.\n\nAnne of Cleves briefly stayed at Dover Castle\n\n\u2018I like her not!\u2019\n\nAnne travelled along the old Roman road to Sittingbourne by the 30 December, then to Rochester the following day. She expected to meet her future husband at Greenwich, but instead Henry made a \u2018surprise\u2019 visit at Rochester Castle, in disguise. He entered Anne\u2019s chamber with five companions, embraced and brazenly kissed her, then gave her a New Year\u2019s gift. Her reaction was polite but cool. Thinking she did not recognise him, Henry returned to the chamber that evening as himself, dined with Anne and again the following morning.\n\nThomas Cromwell later recalled that Henry told him after the public reception at Greenwich on 3 January, that Anne was \u2018nothing as well as she was spoken of\u2019. He spoke with his closest privy councillors and the Cleves ambassadors. The legal evidence of Anne\u2019s freedom to marry, a document ending her earlier betrothal to Francis of Lorraine, had not been received. Yet Henry still chose to wed Anne and said to Cromwell \u2018Is there none other Remedy, but that I must needs, against my will, put my neck in the yoke\u2019? This was the \u2018legal impediment\u2019 moment that we still have at weddings today.\n\nUnhappily ever after\n\nBut Henry went ahead with the wedding, which took place on 6 January 1540. The relationship quickly soured. Although the couple spent nights together, Henry could not consummate their marriage. This secret was kept from all but Henry\u2019s inner circle and the couple appeared in public \u2013 but she was not crowned queen. By 16 May, Henry\u2019s dissatisfaction was well-known and he was already courting Katherine Howard. On 24 June, Anne left court and five days later an official inquiry into the marriage began, ultimately ruling that Anne had not been free to marry because there was no conclusive evidence of the ending of her betrothal to Francis of Lorraine.\n\nAnne\u2019s agreement was sought on 6 July. She resisted for several days but gave in when it became clear that Henry was not rejecting the Cleves alliance, just the marriage. It was impossible to resist the will of a king and his government, and to risk the alliance. The marriage was annulled on 11 July.\n\nOn 28 July, Henry married for a fifth time \u2013 his bride Katherine Howard \u2013 just six months after he married Anne.\n\n\u2018God send me well to keep\u2019\n\nThese words, inscribed on Anne\u2019s wedding ring, asked for health and happiness. Certainly, having got his way, Henry ensured Anne was cared for. She became the \u2018king\u2019s sister\u2019 with a financial allowance, the palace of Richmond and properties in Kent, Sussex, Essex and Suffolk. These included Hever, sometime home of Anne Boleyn, Henry\u2019s second wife.\n\nGenerous, perhaps, but Anne probably didn\u2019t see it that way. She was grief-stricken and dishonoured by rejection: two great marriages, to a duke and a king, had eluded her. Privately, she may have thought that she had shamed Cleves, in descending from the epicentre of the vibrant English court to the fringe of public life. Anne chose to stay in England for the rest of her life. She died on 16 July 1557, at Chelsea manor, aged 41.\n\nPlan your visit to Deal Castle in Kent, and explore the new interpretation on site, where Anne of Cleves first encountered England."}, {"url": "https://www.thecollector.com/reign-king-henry-viii-key-moments/", "page_content": "Henry VIII\u2019s reign (1509-47) is one of the most famous reigns of any monarch in history. More often known for his six wives and the onset of Protestantism in England, Henry VIII faced numerous events during his almost 38-year reign which ultimately shaped him as a king, and the way he ruled the country. From tense relations with France and Spain, to rebellions in England, find out about 5 key events which shaped the reign of King Henry VIII.\n\n1. Henry VIII Meets Francis I: The Field of the Cloth of Gold\n\nThe Field of the Cloth of Gold, artist unknown, c. 1545, via Royal Collection at Hampton Court Palace\n\nThe Field of the Cloth of Gold was a huge summit meeting held between Henry VIII and Francis I of France (r. 1515-47), both of whom were in their 20s and keen to impress each other, and their rival factions.\n\nThe meeting was originally orchestrated to help bolster the friendship between the two kings, who had signed an Anglo-French treaty in 1514. As a result, the event was to be held on neutral ground, at Balinghem, which was between Gu\u00eenes in the English-owned Pale of Calais, and Ardres in French territory.\n\nThe meeting at the Field of the Cloth of Gold was hugely expensive, and organized by Henry\u2019s Lord High Chancellor of England, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey. The event was designed to show off how magnificent each king was, and there was so much gold cloth (fabric woven with silk and gold) that the event was given its name for this exact reason.\n\nHenry VIII, by Hans Holbein the Younger, c. 1537, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nGet the latest articles delivered to your inbox Sign up to our Free Weekly Newsletter Join! Please check your inbox to activate your subscription Thank you!\n\nHenry spared no expenses \u2014 a temporary castle including a courtyard was erected, and the canvas was painted to make it look like brickwork. Two fountains were also brought along, and instead of water coming out of them, red wine flowed instead. Around 10,000 people attended, including 35 priests who served the chapel day and night. It was even reported that 2200 sheep were consumed for their meat, giving an idea of the scale of the event.\n\nFrancis I, by Jean Clouet, c. 1530, via the Louvre\n\nDuring the eighteen days that the meeting went on for, Henry VIII and Francis I both held banquets and entertained each other\u2019s queens (Catherine of Aragon and Claude of France, respectively) as well as partaking in tournaments with each other. They also watched Cornish wrestlers face Breton wrestlers, in a huge spectacle that undoubtedly showed off both of their abilities.\n\nAlthough the rules of the tournaments explicitly stated that the kings were not to compete against each other, nevertheless Henry challenged Francis to a wrestling match, and duly lost. He then attempted to challenge him to an archery competition in order to beat him, but their relations had soured by this point.\n\nAlthough the event was a huge spectacle for their contemporaries, it achieved very little politically. If anything, it showed how pomp and ceremony meant too much to both kings but it also showed that being materialistic and rich does not achieve anything when it comes to confrontation on the battlefield.\n\nThis event was hard to swallow for Henry, who had spent thousands of pounds of the Crown\u2019s money to effectively achieve very little. Henry VIII\u2019s and Francis I\u2019s relations worsened even more after the event, when Cardinal Wolsey arranged an alliance with the Holy Roman Emperor and Francis\u2019 enemy, Charles V (r. 1519-66), who went on to declare war against France that same year, leading to the Italian War of 1521-26.\n\nCardinal Thomas Wolsey, c. 1589-95, via the National Portrait Gallery, London\n\nNevertheless, the Field of the Cloth of Gold was a significant event in the reign of Henry VIII \u2014 it showed him early on that niceties and pretending to like a political rival did not always work out, and it did not have to cost so much money in future.\n\n2. The Annulment of Henry VIII, and Catherine of Aragon\u2019s Marriage\n\nCatherine of Aragon, early 18th century, via the National Portrait Gallery, London\n\nHenry VIII is famous for having six wives, but his marriage to his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, lasted the longest and is arguably the most famous for how it ended. Henry desperately wanted a male heir to succeed him, and during his marriage to Catherine, their only surviving child was a daughter, who would go on to rule as Queen Mary I (r. 1553-58).\n\nIn the mid-1520s, Henry was becoming increasingly frustrated at what he (and Early Modern medical science) viewed as Catherine\u2019s inability to produce a male heir. He became less interested in Catherine, and particularly interested in one of her ladies-in-waiting: Anne Boleyn. However, Anne refused Henry\u2019s advances and did not just want to become a mistress \u2014 she wanted to be queen.\n\nHenry began to attempt to find ways to annul his marriage with Catherine, on the grounds that she had not produced him a male heir, in order to marry Anne Boleyn. Henry turned to Leviticus 20:21, where it states that \u201ca man shall not take his brother\u2019s wife\u201d \u2014 Henry had married Catherine, his deceased brother\u2019s widow. Henry along with Thomas Cranmer, tried to use this to explain why Henry\u2019s marriage to Catherine was null and \u201cblighted in the eyes of God.\u201d (Roderick Phillips, Untying the Knot: A Short History of Divorce, 1991).\n\nPope Clement VII, by Sebastiano del Piombo, c. 1531, via the J. Paul Getty Museum\n\nHenry took the case to Pope Clement VII and by doing so in the public eye, prevented all hope of ensuring Catherine would stay quiet or retire to a nunnery. However, if Clement declared that Henry\u2019s marriage was invalid, he would have had to go against a papal dispensation of a previous Pope who had allowed Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon to marry. Moreover, Charles V was Catherine of Aragon\u2019s aunt, and following the Battle of Pavia in 1525, he had taken Rome \u2014 and thus technically the Pope \u2014 as his prisoner.\n\nHenry waited it out until 1533. During this time, he had been hugely influenced by Anne Boleyn, who was a highly intelligent woman, and who had also taken on the Protestant beliefs of Martin Luther. A year later, Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy, which defined Henry VIII as the Supreme Head of the Church of England. This was the official break with Rome, and the rise of Protestantism in England.\n\nIn addition, Henry passed the Treasons Act, which stated that anyone who questioned Henry\u2019s authority over the Church could be punished by death. Henry\u2019s marriage with Catherine of Aragon was finally annulled, and he married Anne Boleyn. She ultimately ended up being beheaded, but not before giving birth to the future Queen Elizabeth I (r. 1558-1603).\n\nHenry VIII\u2019s annulment of his marriage with Catherine of Aragon was a hugely significant moment in his reign. It marked the onset of Protestantism in England, the break from Rome, and the beginning of the Church of England.\n\n3. The Pilgrimage of Grace\n\nThe Pilgrimage of Grace, unknown artist, 19th century, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nUnsurprisingly, Henry VIII faced opposition from the public during his tumultuous reign. The Pilgrimage of Grace was a popular revolt, started in North Yorkshire, and it was led by the lawyer Robert Aske. The common people were protesting against Henry VIII\u2019s break with Rome, as well as the policies of his Chief Minister, Thomas Cromwell.\n\nHowever, there were also other grievances that the rebels were protesting. From a political perspective, many were unhappy with Henry\u2019s annulment of his marriage with Catherine, and then his marriage to the Protestant Anne Boleyn. However, following Anne Boleyn\u2019s execution on an exaggerated charge of adultery and treason, many viewed Henry\u2019s personal reputation as that of a spoiled child bored with his toys.\n\nIn addition, the Ten Articles which had been released as part of the Reformation and the new order of prayer released in 1535 by the government, made the official church doctrine more Protestant, which again went against the Catholic beliefs of most northerners.\n\nRobert Aske led his army of followers south from York to Doncaster, where they met Thomas Howard, the Duke of Norfolk. Aske\u2019s forces numbered about 40,000 while Norfolk\u2019s numbered just under 7000. Aske and Norfolk entered into negotiations (as Norfolk was acting on Henry VIII\u2019s behalf), and Norfolk promised the rebels that if they dispersed and returned to York, there would be no actions against them and that a parliament would be held in York within the year to discuss their grievances.\n\nThomas Howard, by Hans Holbein the Younger, c. 1539, via Royal Collection Trust\n\nAske naively believed Norfolk, and as a result, the rebels dispersed. In February 1537, another northern rebellion broke out, but not under Aske\u2019s authority. Henry VIII viewed this as his chance to get his own back and turn back on his promises. The rebellion failed, and Henry arrested the leaders as well as Aske. Around 200 people were executed as a result of their parts during the rebellions, and Robert Aske was hanged in chains from Clifford\u2019s Tower in York.\n\nNonetheless, the Pilgrimage of Grace deserves a place on this list for a number of reasons. Although it was a failed rebellion and resulted in the larger monasteries being dissolved, it was still the largest threat that Henry had to deal with on his own soil during his reign. It also can be argued that the Pilgrimage of Grace was a defining factor for four of the seven sacraments being restored in the Bishop\u2019s Book of 1537, which marked the end of the flow of official doctrine toward Protestantism.\n\n4. The Dissolution of the Monasteries\n\nGisborough Priory, via English Heritage\n\nWith the Act of Supremacy of 1534, Henry VIII became the Supreme Head of the Church of England. Unfortunately for him, the monasteries were a stark reminder of the wealth and power of the Catholic Church in England.\n\nFurthermore, the monasteries were also the wealthiest institutions in England during Henry VIII\u2019s reign. Henry\u2019s extravagant lifestyle and his wars cost huge amounts of money \u2014 Henry\u2019s thinking was to destroy the monastic system so that he could not only remove Papal influence and reinforce Protestantism, but to also take the hordes of wealth owned by the monasteries.\n\nBut Henry did not undertake this task alone. A dossier was presented to Parliament outlining \u2014 and over-exaggerating \u2014 the corruption of the monastic system. His Chief Minister, Thomas Cromwell, then introduced the Valor Eccleasticus to find out just how much property was owned by the Church and followed this up by sending out royal commissioners to all the monasteries in England, Ireland, and Wales.\n\nThis then led onto the Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act in 1535, whereby small monasteries with an income of less than \u00a3200 per year were closed down. Their buildings, land and money were taken by the Crown. Henry managed to work his way around this by stating that he was undertaking it in the name of monastic reform: he was closing down the smaller monasteries and donating the money to the larger monasteries to make them more efficient.\n\nRievaulx Abbey, via English Heritage\n\nBy 1538, it was clear that Henry was not doing this in the name of monastic reform. Instead, he was selling on the land to the nobility and gentry, and making even more profit for himself and the Crown. A year later, the Second Act of Dissolution was passed, allowing Henry to dissolve the larger monasteries and religious houses. By 1540, they were being shut down at a rate of fifty per month.\n\nThe consequences were huge. An immediate after-effect was that hundreds of people who worked in the monasteries were out of work, and many were homeless. The Pilgrimage of Grace in 1536 was another immediate response. For Henry, his wealth increased by estimates of about \u00a31.5 million \u2014 the majority of which was spent on his wars in Scotland and France.\n\nA lasting legacy of the Dissolution of the Monasteries was the huge loss of wonderful architecture, the destruction of the monastic libraries, and the loss of thousands of precious, irreplaceable illuminated manuscripts. This was a negative element of Henry VIII\u2019s reign but a key one nonetheless \u2014 its legacy can still be seen today, in the hundreds of monastic ruins around England, that are now, thankfully, largely protected by English Heritage.\n\n5. Henry VIII\u2019s Favorite: The Marriage to Jane Seymour\n\nThe day after Anne Boleyn\u2019s execution, Henry was betrothed to Jane Seymour, a member of the Seymour family who held the duchy of Somerset. Ten days later, Henry VIII and Jane Seymour were married, and Jane was publicly proclaimed Queen on 4th June 1536. She was shown to be a kind-hearted person, who showed sympathy to Catherine of Aragon and Mary I, and her only involvement in political affairs was to ask for pardons for those involved in the Pilgrimage of Grace. Henry angrily rejected this, and reminded her of the fate of Anne Boleyn when she \u201cmeddled in his affairs\u201d.\n\nIn January 1537, Jane conceived and she reportedly had a craving for quail \u2014 causing Henry to order the finest from Flanders and Calais for her. She gave birth to the future King Edward VI (r. 1547-53) on 12th October 1537, to the delight of Henry VIII \u2014 he finally had the male heir he had wanted for years.\n\nUnfortunately, his joy was short-lived. Jane\u2019s labor had been notoriously difficult, and due to birthing complications \u2014 which some historians today argue was a retained placenta or puerperal fever \u2014 she died 12 days later at Hampton Court Palace. She was aged just 29.\n\nJane was buried at Windsor Castle and was the only one of Henry\u2019s six wives to have been given a queen\u2019s funeral. Henry wore black for the three months following Jane\u2019s death, and it was during this period that he began putting on weight, leading him to develop gout and diabetes.\n\nJane Seymour\u2019s legacy was that she was, unquestionably, Henry VIII\u2019s favorite wife. She also helped to restore the relationship between Mary I and Henry VIII, as well as advancing her own family\u2019s fortunes through her influence as queen. She gave Henry the son and male heir that he had wanted, and when Henry VIII died in 1547, he was buried next to her, as per his request."}]}
