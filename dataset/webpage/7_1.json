{"Wilhelm Windelband is now remembered mainly for the terms \"nomothetic\" and \"idiographic,\" which he introduced.": [{"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wilhelm-windelband/", "page_content": "First published Mon May 18, 2020\n\nWindelband was a marvelous essayist. He developed his ideas not in the format of a larger systematic work, but in a series of addresses and individual papers, a selection of which was published in his famous Pr\u00e4ludien [Preludes] in 1883. The genre of Windelband\u2019s writings does not lend itself to the development of a philosophical system, and he often changes the emphasis, framing, and terminology of his claims and arguments from one essay to the next. Nevertheless, he was a rigorous thinker. This entry provides a rational reconstruction of the systematic insights that Windelband developed in his various addresses and essays, and groups them around the central themes that reoccur throughout his oeuvre. With respect to many of these themes\u2014the anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant, the fact-value distinction, the question of historical method, and the conception of the history of philosophy\u2014Windelband was a highly influential contributor to the philosophical landscape of his time. Although he did not develop a detailed and encompassing philosophical system like his student Rickert, or the neo-Kantians of the Marburg school, most notably Ernst Cassirer (1874\u20131945), his ideas shaped subsequent debates on these issues more profoundly than is often acknowledged.\n\nHe also made a name for himself in the history of philosophy by pioneering the method of structuring the historical presentation in terms of fundamental philosophical problems, rather than as a chronology of individual thinkers.\n\nWindelband is well-known for having introduced a distinction between the \u201cnomothetic method\u201d of the natural sciences and the \u201cidiographic method\u201d of the historical disciplines. His argument that history is a science [Wissenschaft] that captures the unique, unrepeatable and individual character of reality has been highly relevant for subsequent debates on historical method.\n\nWindelband\u2019s main philosophical contribution consists in reformulating Kant\u2019s transcendental approach in terms of a \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d that focuses philosophical analysis on questions of normativity. Although Windelband thinks of his project as an anti-metaphysical \u201cscientific philosophy\u201d, he is keen to secure for philosophy a role that is independent of the special sciences. He finds the grounds for philosophy\u2019s independence in its formal-teleological method, and in its concern with a quaestio juris, rather than a quaestio facti. That is, philosophy deals with questions of justification, it does not determine matters of fact.\n\nWilhelm Windelband (1848\u20131915) was a German neo-Kantian philosopher. He is considered the founding father of the Baden (or Southwest) school of Neo-Kantianism. The Baden school included his student and successor at Heidelberg, Heinrich Rickert (1863\u20131936), and Rickert\u2019s student Emil Lask (1875\u20131915) as its core members. Alongside his contemporary Hermann Cohen (1842\u20131918)\u2014the founder of the Marburg school of Neo-Kantianism\u2014Windelband is a central proponent of the anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant that became dominant in German academic philosophy from the 1880s onwards, and that constituted the backbone of \u201corthodox\u201d neo-Kantianism in the late nineteenth century.\n\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nWilhelm Windelband was born in 1848 in Potsdam, Germany. His father, Johann Friedrich Windelband was a state secretary for the Province of Brandenburg. Windelband studied in Jena, Berlin, and G\u00f6ttingen, attending lectures by Kuno Fischer (1824\u20131907) in Jena and studying with Hermann Lotze (1817\u20131881) in G\u00f6ttingen. Fischer and Lotze would deeply influence Windelband\u2019s philosophical thinking, as well as his work as a historian of philosophy.\n\nIn 1870, Windelband completed his dissertation on Die Lehren vom Zufall [Doctrines of chance] under Lotze\u2019s supervision. The following year he served as a soldier in the German-French war. After his military service, he completed his habilitation in Leipzig and took up a position as \u201cPrivatdozent\u201d there. His habilitation was published in 1873 under the title Ueber die Gewissheit der Erkenntniss: eine psychologisch-erkenntnisstheoretische Studie [On the certainty of knowledge: a psychological-epistemological study]. In 1874, Windelband married Martha Wichgraf with whom he would have four children.\n\nTwo years later, Windelband became professor (ordinarius) of \u201cinductive philosophy\u201d in Z\u00fcrich. He lectured on psychology before taking up a position as professor of philosophy in Freiburg im Breisgau in 1877. In 1882 he accepted an offer from the University of Strasbourg. While his inaugural lectures in Z\u00fcrich and Freiburg had centered on the relation between psychology and philosophy, his works from the Strasbourg period develop his core themes in the philosophy of values and the philosophy of history. Windelband served as \u201cRektor\u201d of the University of Strasbourg in 1894/95 and 1897/98. He remained in Strasbourg until 1903, when he accepted a call from the University of Heidelberg. Between 1905 and 1908 he served as representative of the University of Heidelberg in the Baden \u201cLandtag\u201d. He was a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, and of the Academies of Sciences of G\u00f6ttingen, Bayern and Heidelberg. He remained in Heidelberg and taught there until his death in 1915.\n\n2. From Kant to the Philosophy of Values\n\nWindelband\u2019s views on normativity are strongly influenced by his teacher Lotze. In his Logic (1874), Lotze distinguishes between psychological laws which determine how thinking proceeds as a matter of fact, and logical laws, which are normative laws and prescribe how thinking ought to proceed (Lotze 1874: \u00a7x; \u00a7332, \u00a7337). This distinction also corresponds to a distinction between act and content. Lotze observes that \u201cideas\u201d do occur in us as acts or events of the mind. But their content does not consist in such acts, is not reducible to mental activity, and does not exist in the way empirical processes and entities may be said to exist. It is not real, but \u201cvalid\u201d (Lotze 1874: \u00a7\u00a7314\u2013318).\n\nThe distinction between the factual and the normative would become the cornerstone of Windelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d. In his early writings, however, Windelband does not yet embrace this distinction. In his habilitation thesis \u00dcber die Gewi\u00dfheit der Erkenntnis (1873), he argues that logic is a normative discipline, but that it needs to be put on a psychological basis. This is because the justification of our knowledge claims is always dependent on and relative to specific epistemic purposes which, in turn, are given psychologically. Although he criticizes the identification of the conditions of knowledge with psychophysical processes, he does think of psychology and logic or epistemology as continuous with one another. His 1875 \u201cDie Erkenntnislehre unter dem v\u00f6lkerpsychologischen Gesichtspunkte\u201d [\u201cThe theory of knowledge from the perspective of folk-psychology\u201d] which was published in Moritz Lazarus\u2019 and Heyman Steinthal\u2019s Zeitschrift f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft [Journal of folk psychology and linguistics], is more radical. It denies that logical norms are independent of the conscious mind and claims that the origins of logical norms are to be found in the social history of humankind: the principle of contradiction emerges in situations of social conflict together with the distinction between true and false beliefs; and the law of sufficient reason comes into being when conflicts between rival views are no longer settled by brute force. On this picture, logical principles exist only when humans cognize them. There is no boundary between psychological acts and objective logical laws, or between actual historical acceptance and normative validity.\n\nThis is precisely the type of thinking that Windelband will later reject as \u201cpsychologistic\u201d, \u201chistoricist\u201d, and \u201crelativist\u201d (1883: 116\u2013117, 132). It is not clear what led Windelband to this change of view, but a deeper engagement with the Critique of Pure Reason and with the Kant scholarship of his time, in particular with works by Kuno Fischer (1860), Herman Cohen (1871), and Friedrich Paulsen (1875), seem to have factored in. The clear contours of Windelband\u2019s anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant emerge for the first time in his 1877 paper \u201c\u00dcber die verschiedenen Phasen der Kantischen Lehre vom Ding-an-sich\u201d [\u201cOn the different stages of the Kantian doctrine of the thing-in-itself\u201d]. In this essay, Windelband argues against the idea, held by prominent figures of the \u201cback-to-Kant\u201d movement like Friedrich Albert Lange (1828\u20131875) and Hermann von Helmholtz (1821\u20131894), that knowledge emerges from an interaction between subject and object. According to their view, the object affects the subject\u2019s mind, while the subject provides the a priori cognitive structures that organize representations. These a priori structures are innate as they consist in the psychophysical constitution of the human sensory apparatus and mind. Cohen\u2019s critique of this (mis)interpretation focuses on the concept of the a priori and the question of objectivity (Cohen 1871). Windelband, in contrast, takes the problem of the thing-in-itself and the concept of truth as his starting points. His critique of the subject-object-interaction model leads him to an immanent conception of truth, according to which truth consists in the normative rules according to which our judgments ought to be formed. The immanent concept of truth thus shifts the focus of philosophical analysis on the universal and necessary \u201crules\u201d that ground our judgments.\n\nThe 1877 essay gives a genetic account of the development of Kant\u2019s views about the thing-in-itself from the Inaugural Dissertation (1770) to the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason (1787). This genetic reconstruction is supposed to reveal the underlying philosophical problems and motivations that drove Kant\u2019s thinking, as well as the inner tensions that, according to Windelband, permeate critical philosophy. In particular, Windelband identifies a \u201cgulf\u201d (1877: 225) between Kant\u2019s critique of knowledge and the metaphysics of morals, as well as a tension between the psychological account of the faculties, and Kant\u2019s mature anti-psychologism. He distinguishes between four phases in Kant\u2019s thinking about the thing-in-itself, and argues that residues of the latter three stages are present in both editions of the Critique (1781; 1787) and in the Prolegomena (1783).\n\nThe first phase, Windelband argues, is that of the Inaugural Dissertation (1770). Kant adopts Leibniz\u2019s distinction between noumena and phenomena while formulating a genuinely novel thought: he introduces the psychological distinction between receptive sensibility and the spontaneous intellect. This distinction allows him to maintain the claim that, unlike intuitions, concepts relate to things-in-themselves (1877: 240\u2013241).\n\nIn the second phase, Kant concerns himself more deeply with the question how the concepts of the understanding can relate to objects. He is driven to the insight that\n\n[w]e can only have a priori knowledge of that which we produce by the lawlike forms of our rational activities [Vernunfthandlungen]. (1877: 246)\n\nHere, Windelband follows Fischer\u2019s claim that the categories of the understanding are a priori valid for experience because they produce or \u201cmake\u201d it (Fischer 1860). Because the understanding cannot \u201cmake\u201d the thing-in-itself, the thing-in-itself cannot be known.\n\nAccording to Windelband, Kant then proceeds to inquire why we are even assuming the existence of things-in-themselves if we cannot know them. Here he enters his third, most radical phase. Kant now thinks of the thing-in-itself as a fiction, an illegitimate hypostasis in which\n\nthe universal form of the synthetic act of the understanding is seen as something that exists independently of experience. (1877: 254)\n\nWindelband argues that it is only by dismissing the existence of the thing-in-itself and by jettisoning the phenomena-noumena distinction that Kant can undertake his anti-psychologistic turn. With the rejection of the thing-in-itself, the characterization of sensibility as \u201creceptive\u201d also needs to be abandoned. And that makes a psychological construal of the faculties nonsensical. Kant is then also able to abandon the concept of truth as correspondence between representations and objects in favor of a strictly immanent conception. The immanent conception defines truth in terms of the universal and necessary rules that the relations between our representations need to accord to (1877: 259\u2013260).\n\nAnd yet, Kant could not rest with this radical view given his commitments in moral philosophy. Practical reason, and in particular the idea that the moral law does not depend on the qualities of humans as sensuous beings, but only on reason, demands a return to the assumption that the thing-in-itself exists (1877: 262). In the fourth phase, Kant thus reintroduces the thing-in-itself, while maintaining his anti-psychologism.\n\nThis genetic reconstruction allows Windelband to think of the conflict between the different views of the thing-in-itself that had emerged within the neo-Kantian tradition as reflective of inherent tensions in the Critique. He argues that Kant was especially unclear with respect to psychologism: the distinction between judgment (as a cognitive process) and justification (as logical and normative) is inadequately articulated in the first Critique. Hence Kant is at least partly responsible for the fact that in the first wave of neo-Kantianism represented by Lange and Helmholtz \u201cthe new concept of aprioricity was soon dragged down to the old idea of psychological priority\u201d (1883: 101).\n\nBut Windelband\u2019s approach to Kant is not merely historical. His sympathies clearly lie with the Kant of the third phase. For Windelband, the insight that natural psychological processes are \u201cutterly irrelevant\u201d for the truth value of our representations (1882b: 24), and the idea that the ultimate problem of philosophy is that of normativity and justification\u2014not a quaestio facti, but a quaestio juris (1882b: 26)\u2014need to be defended from Kant\u2019s own unclarities on these matters. Windelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d can thus be understood as an attempt to purify, explicate and develop the radical insights of the anti-psychologistic move in Kant\u2019s \u201cthird phase\u201d.\n\nThe cornerstone of this endeavor is the immanent conception of truth. Windelband repeatedly returns to discussing the correspondence theory of knowledge with its metaphor of a \u201cmirror relation\u201d between mind and object. He criticizes the misconception that our sensual perceptions are the things-in-themselves and that these things could be compared with our representations. Any comparison must occur between representations, since things and representations are \u201cincommensurable\u201d (1881: 130). According to Windelband, Kant\u2019s central innovation consists in the insight that the truth of our judgments, and the relation of our representations to an object are not to be found in correspondence at all. Rather, it consists in the \u201crules\u201d for combining representations (1881: 134). This leads Windelband to define truth as the \u201cnormality of thinking\u201d (1881: 138)\u2014with \u201cnormality\u201d meaning that thinking proceeds in accordance with rules or norms. Windelband also conceptualizes the object of knowledge in terms of the rules of judgment. The object of knowledge is nothing other than\n\na rule according to which representational elements ought to organize themselves, in order for them to be recognized as universally valid in this organization. (1881: 135).\n\nWindelband uses the terms \u201caxioms\u201d and \u201cvalues\u201d interchangeably to refer to the most fundamental rules, and he uses the term \u201cnorms\u201d often, but not fully consistently to refer to values or axioms as they relate to psychological experience and the cultural-historical world. Focusing his interpretation on \u201cvalues\u201d and \u201cnorms\u201d, Windelband captures the structural similarity of Kant\u2019s three Critiques in terms of immanent truth: if truth is nothing other than accordance with a rule, then there is moral and aesthetic truth in just the same way as there is epistemic truth (1881: 140). In a later text, Windelband describes the unified project of the three Critiques in terms of the necessary and universal relation between thought and object. He writes that the postulates of practical reason relate to intelligible objects (ideas) just \u201cas necessarily\u201d as the intuitions and categories relate to the object of experience, and that teleological judgment constructs the purposive whole of nature just \u201cas universally\u201d as the principles of pure understanding apply the categories to experience (1904a: 151). While this formulation glosses over some of the nuances of the distinction between constitutive and regulative uses of reason, Windelband\u2019s main intention is not that of giving a detailed and fully accurate reconstruction of Kant\u2019s philosophy. In line with his famous dictum that \u201cunderstanding Kant means to go beyond him\u201d (1915: iv), he instead seeks to revive the critical project in a manner that allows it to answer the needs of his own time. And Windelband thinks that the critical philosophy required at the time of his writing is a \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d which reveals the most fundamental values in epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics.\n\n3. The Factual, the Normative, and the Method of Philosophy\n\nAs indicated above, Windelband bases his \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d on Lotze\u2019s distinction between the factual and the normative. Throughout his career, he seeks to explicate and clarify this distinction and to illuminate its consequences for philosophical method.\n\nIn \u201cWas ist Philosophie?\u201d [\u201cWhat is philosophy?\u201d] (1882), Windelband approaches the factual-normative distinction by identifying two basic and irreducible types of cognitive operations: judgments and evaluations. While judgments relate representations in a synthesis, and thus expand our knowledge about an object, evaluations presuppose an object as given. They do not expand our knowledge. Rather, they express a relation between the \u201cevaluating consciousness\u201d and the represented object in a \u201cfeeling\u201d of approval or disapproval (1882b: 29\u201330).\n\nDespite characterizing evaluations in terms of the feelings and subjective attitudes of the evaluating consciousness, Windelband argues that some evaluations are \u201cabsolutely valid\u201d. Even if they are not embraced by everyone as a matter fact, they entail a normative demand: they ought to be accepted universally according to an absolute value (1882b: 37). The basic idea seems to be that the normative force of any particular evaluation that is carried out by an empirical consciousness is derived from its relation to a non-empirical, absolute value. Windelband argues that even if there is disagreement about which evaluations ought to be embraced as universal and necessary, the demand for absolute validity itself can be recognized by everyone: we all believe in the distinction between that which is absolutely valid and that which is not (1882b: 43).\n\nAccordingly, there must be a system of absolute values from which the validity of judgments in epistemology, aesthetics, and ethic derives. Critical philosophy, then, is nothing other than the \u201cscience of necessary and universal values\u201d (1882b: 26) that explicates this system and thus reveals the grounds of normative appraisal and valid judgment. Note that for Windelband, normativity and validity are closely linked, if not identical. Absolute values endow our judgments with a normative demand. Our judgments are valid if and only if they raise a normative demand, that is if they ought to be accepted universally and necessarily.\n\nHaving distinguished the factual and the normative by reference to different cognitive operations, Windelband also seeks to identify the points of contact between the two realms. Ultimately, he wants to explain how empirical beings can recognize absolute values. His idea that there is a system of absolute values is thus accompanied by the conception of a \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. In normal consciousness the absolute system of values is, at least partially, represented in the form of norms that are known by \u201cempirical consciousness\u201d and that have an effect on it.\n\nStarting from the immanent conception of truth as accordance with a rule, Windelband distinguishes from among the infinite possible combinations of representations that might or might not be formed by empirical consciousness a subset of combinations: the subset that accords with universal and necessary rules, and which hence ought to be formed (1881: 135\u2013139: 1882a: 72\u201373). This subset is what he calls \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d (1881: 139). Thought is related to and valid for an object if of the infinite possible combinations of our representations, our thinking forms exactly those judgments that \u201cought to be thought\u201d (1881: 135). One might say that empirical consciousness contains (parts) of the system of absolute values as its \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. To the extent that philosophy seeks not only to reveal the absolute system of values, but also to inquire into how they can be norms for empirical\u2014embodied, psychological and historically situated\u2014human beings, critical philosophy is not only a \u201cscience of values\u201d, but also a \u201cscience of normal consciousness\u201d (1882b: 46).\n\nAlthough Windelband refers to the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d as a science, he emphasizes that philosophy does not rely on the methods of the empirical sciences. Philosophy is a second-order science that reflects on the methods and results of the various empirical disciplines in order to reveal the values \u201cby virtue of which we can evaluate the form and extent of their validity\u201d (1907: 9). Crucially, this reflective endeavor cannot be carried out by means of empirical investigation. Here, the distinction between the factual and the normative assumes a methodological dimension.\n\nIn \u201cKritische oder genetische Methode?\u201d [\u201cCritical or genetic method?\u201d] (1883) Windelband lays out in great detail the differences between the \u201cexplanatory\u201d and \u201cgenetic\u201d method of the empirical sciences, on the one hand, and the \u201cteleological\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d method of philosophy, on the other. And he warns of the devastating consequences that result if the two are conflated. He singles out two disciplines that might be thought to be relevant to philosophical questions about values: individual psychology and cultural history. He does not call into question the legitimacy of these disciplines or of the \u201cgenetic method\u201d in general. He even thinks that the genetic method can be applied to values. That is, individual psychology and cultural history can yield valid genetic theories that explain the actual acceptance and development of values in an individual\u2019s mental life and in cultural history. But actual acceptance is not the same as normative validity, and validity proper cannot be found by generalizing from the empirical. A firm boundary separates the genetic method and its approach toward actually accepted values from the critical method of philosophy which concerns values as normative.\n\nWindelband\u2019s argument against the application of the genetic method to philosophical questions has three components. First, he argues that the genetic method cannot solve philosophical questions about normativity and validity, because there is too much variety regarding the values that have been and are actually accepted. The empirical method will not uncover values that are universally embraced by all cultures (1883: 114\u2013115).\n\nSecond, the genetic method can show and explain why some values have been accepted by this or that individual, or in this or that culture. But insofar as it is an empirical method, it cannot establish that the values in question are universal and necessary.\n\nThe universally valid can be found neither by inductive comparison of all individuals and peoples nor by deductive inference from \u2026 the \u2018essence\u2019 of man. (1883: 115)\n\nWindelband points to the absurdity of trying to justify by empirical means that which is the presupposition of any empirical theory: the axioms upon which the validity of any theory is based (1883: 113).\n\nThird, Windelband argues that the genetic method leads to relativism. The argument rests on the two claims just outlined, and can be reconstructed as follows. There is variation between individuals and cultures regarding which beliefs are actually prevalent, and the naturally necessary [naturnotwendig] laws of psychology lead to the formation of both true and false beliefs. As an empirical method with no access to the universal and necessary, the genetic method of cultural history and individual psychology has no criterion for distinguishing between valid and invalid beliefs. This means that it has to treat all beliefs as \u201cequally justified [alle gleich berechtigt]\u201d (1882b: 36).\n\nFor [the genetic explanation], there is thus no absolute measure; it must treat all beliefs as equally justified because they are all equally necessary by nature\u2026 [R]elativism is the necessary consequence of the purely empiricist treatment of philosophy\u2019s cardinal question. (1883: 115\u2013116)\n\nNote that Windelband does not differentiate between the idea that all beliefs have only relative validity and the claim that they are all equally justified or equally valid. In his view, the genetic method does not merely render belief relative to individuals and cultures; it also forces us to conclude that all beliefs are equally valid. An empirical psychology or cultural history that oversteps its boundaries and tries to address philosophical questions about normativity and validity leads to \u201chistoricism\u201d, \u201cpsychologism\u201d, and \u201crelativism\u201d and destroys the basis of normative appraisal altogether.\n\nHaving rejected the genetic method in philosophy, Windelband explains that philosophical method is purely \u201cformal\u201d. The axioms, or values, on which the validity of our judgments is based upon cannot be proven. But it can be shown that the purposes of recognizing truth, beauty, and can only be achieved if absolute values are presupposed. Hence the critical method of philosophy has a teleological structure:\n\n[F]or the critical method these axioms, regardless of the extent to which they are actually accepted, are norms which ought to be valid if thinking wants to fulfil the purpose of being true, volition the purpose of being good, and feeling the purpose of capturing beauty, in a manner that warrants universal validation. (1883: 109)\n\nAnd yet, while Windelband insists on the distinction between the empirical-genetic method of science and the critical-teleological method of philosophy, he takes his theory of \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d to imply that empirical facts do play a role in philosophy. In particular, he wants to maintain that empirical facts about individual psychology and culture can provide the starting points for philosophical reflection. He therefore describes the philosophical method as a method of reflection [Selbstbesinnung], in which the empirical mind becomes aware of its own \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. Philosophy examines existing claims to validity in light of teleological considerations, and in this way reveals the \u201cprocessual forms of psychic life that are necessary conditions for the realization of universal appraisal\u201d (1883: 125). Put differently, teleological considerations allow the empirical consciousness to distinguish within itself between empirical and contingent contents, on the one hand, and the \u201ccontents and forms\u201d that \u201chave the value of normal consciousness\u201d, on the other (1882b: 45\u201346; 1881: 139).\n\n4. The Problem of Freedom\n\nThe distinction between the normative and the factual and the question how the two realms are related also structure Windelband\u2019s reflections on human freedom. Throughout his intellectual career, Windelband returns to this problem, presenting different strategies for reconciling causal determinism and human freedom. His dissertation, completed under Lotze in 1870, deals with the concepts of chance, causal necessity, and freedom. At that time, Windelband still embraces the Kantian concept of transcendental freedom, according to which the noumenal self is the uncaused cause of all intentional action (1870: 16\u201319). But after the 1877 essay, which had uncovered the anti-metaphysical rejection of the thing-in-itself in Kant\u2019s \u201cthird phase\u201d as the radical starting point for the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d, Kant\u2019s metaphysical solution to the problem of freedom ceased to convince him.\n\nWindelband\u2019s most fully developed effort to arrive at an alternative solution to the problem of freedom can be found in his 1882 essay \u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d [\u201cNorms and natural laws\u201d] and in his 1904 lectures \u00dcber Willenfreiheit [On freedom of the will]. In these texts, Windelband articulates the following core claims. First, the Kantian dualism between phenomena and noumena needs to be overcome, and we need to think of moral responsibility in a way that does not presuppose a noumenal realm. Second, causal explanation and normative evaluation are two irreducible, but ultimately compatible, ways of viewing, or constructing, the world of appearances. Third, the object of moral evaluation is neither a particular moral action, nor a transcendentally free will, but a \u201cpersonality\u201d\u2014understood as a set of relatively stable motivations and psychological dispositions\u2014that is the natural cause of our actions. Although articulating these same core thoughts, the two texts differ in how they motivate these ideas, and in the consequences that they draw from them.\n\n\u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d begins by postulating a conflict between natural law and moral law: if the moral law demands an action that would also result from natural causes alone, it is superfluous. But if it demands an action that does not accord with natural causes, it is useless, because natural necessity cannot be violated (1882a: 59).\n\nWindelband holds that causal determinism extends to mental life and that for this reason the conception of freedom as a fundamental capacity that violates \u201cthe naturally necessary functions of psychic life\u201d (1882a: 60) is implausible from the get-go. However, he grants that there are two different and irreducible ways of viewing the same objects: on the one hand, there is psychological science which explains what the facts of mental life are. On the other hand, there are ideal norms, which do not explain what the facts are, but express how they ought to be (1882a: 66\u201367). The solution to the antagonism between natural law and moral law is to be found in the relation between these two points of view.\n\nHere, Windelband introduces the claim that although ideal norms differ from causal laws, they are not incommensurable with them and, in fact, act on us causally. His argument builds on his conception of \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d as the representation of the system of absolute values within empirical consciousness. Windelband argues that a mind that becomes aware of its own \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d is capable of acting on the basis of and in agreement with the norms that it has discovered within itself:\n\n[E]ach norm carries with it a sense that the real process of thinking or willing ought to form itself in accordance with it. With immediate evidence a form of psychological coercion attaches itself to the awareness of the norm. (1882a: 85)\n\nThe norm becomes a determining factor in and for empirical consciousness. It acts as \u201cpart of the causal law\u201d and determines psychological life with natural necessity (1882a: 87; see also 1883: 122).\n\nThe result is what Windelband calls a \u201cdeterministic concept of freedom\u201d (1882a: 88), according to which freedom consists in nothing other than the becoming-aware of the norms that command how we ought to act: our becoming-aware of them determines our actions with natural necessity. Freedom is the \u201cdetermination of empirical consciousness by normal consciousness\u201d (1882a: 88).\n\nBut Windelband still needs to explain how it is possible that we can be aware of a moral norm and not act on it. Long passages in the 1904 lectures are devoted to developing the thought that what determines our moral decisions and actions, and hence decisions if and when we act in accordance with the moral law is our \u201cpersonality\u201d. Windelband approaches this as a theoretical, not as a normative, question and concludes that we may well call those decisions and actions \u201cfree\u201d that are predominantly determined by our constant personality, as opposed to being determined by external circumstances or contingent affects. Freedom is \u201cthe unhindered causality of a pre-existing willing\u201d (1904b: 106).\n\nHowever, Windelband concedes that this analysis does not exhaust our concept of freedom since there is not merely a theoretical, but also a normative use of the concept. In this context, Windelband acknowledges the attraction of the Kantian argument that moral responsibility is possible only if we have transcendental free will and with it the capacity for genuine alternatives: we could act differently given the same circumstances. But Windelband rejects the project of grounding human freedom in a noumenal world. He thinks that Kant\u2019s distinction between an intelligible noumenal self that is the uncaused cause of our actions, and a deterministic empirical world as constructed by our understanding reproduces the same problems that earlier metaphysical accounts of freedom had encountered. He discusses two problems in particular.\n\nFirst, on the one hand, the personality that a particular individual has developed is part of the empirical world and therefore, on the metaphysical picture, does not feature into the free decisions of the individual. But, on the other hand, the noumenal self is empty. It is an abstract, general self, uniform in all of us; and thus it cannot account for the differences in the moral life of individuals (1904b: 161\u2013163).\n\nSecond, transcendental freedom is fundamentally incompatible with the \u201call- encompassing reality and causality of the deity\u201d (1904b: 187). God is the ultimate uncaused cause, and the only way to understand this thought is by assuming a \u201ctimeless causality\u201d between God and the intelligible characters (noumenal selves)\u2014a view which ends up undermining the freedom of the latter (1904b: 186\u20139)\n\nHaving concluded that Kantian dualism fails to avoid the pitfalls of earlier metaphysical approaches to freedom, Windelband abandons the concept of transcendental freedom altogether. But while in 1882 his alternative had been the \u201cdeterministic concept of freedom\u201d, in 1904 Windelband proceeds to articulate the view that the concept of free will is a mere placeholder in our normative discourse. We are not free in the metaphysical sense, but we are perfectly entitled to pass moral judgment. And we use the language of freedom to express the fact that when passing moral judgment we disregard questions of causal determination.\n\nTo spell out this idea, Windelband takes up the 1882 distinction between the \u201cpoints of view\u201d of explanatory science and ideal norms. He now argues that there are two ways of constructing the world of appearances: we construct the world of appearances according to causal laws, and we construct it according to our normative evaluations. Evaluation\n\nreflects within the manifoldness of the given on those moments only which can be put in relation to the norm\u2026 [O]ne could call the manner in which the objects of experience, the given manifoldness of the factual, appear uniformly in light of such an evaluation another form of \u201cappearance\u201d\u2026. (1904b: 195\u20136)\n\nFreedom then means not that the will is an uncaused cause. When speaking of freedom, we appeal to the uncaused merely in the sense that we evaluate matters independently of causal deterministic processes (1904b: 197\u2013198).\n\nWindelband believes that his view preserves moral responsibility. As described above, his theoretical investigation had yielded the result that that which determines the extent to which we act in agreement with a moral norm is our personality or character. Personality is the constant cause of voluntary action, it determines our actions necessarily according to general psychological laws. From a practical standpoint, personality then is also the ultimate object of moral appraisal. We hold personality responsible, and we are justified in doing so, even if the formation of personality is itself a causal process over which the individual has no control. Ultimately, the upshot of Windelband\u2019s discussion is that moral responsibility does not presuppose a noumenal world and transcendental freedom, because it does not presuppose that we could act otherwise. It merely presupposes that another person in the same circumstances could act otherwise. The idea that one could have acted differently refers\n\nnot to the concrete human being in these concrete circumstances, but to the generic concept of the human being. (1904b: 212)\n\n5. The Natural and the Historical Sciences\n\nIn Windelband\u2019s view, a reconsideration of the Kantian project is not only necessary because of its inherent tensions; broader developments in nineteenth-century culture and science also necessitate an adaptation of the critical method to changed historical circumstances. One important factor is the professionalization of the historical disciplines that had been underway since the early nineteenth century (1907: 12). One of Windelband\u2019s central and best known philosophical contributions concerns the question what distinguishes the \u201chistorical sciences\u201d, that is, those disciplines that study the human-historical and cultural world, from the natural sciences. Windelband\u2019s answer to this question is in line with his formal-teleological conception of philosophy: by explicating the autonomous presuppositions of historical method, critical philosophy safeguards the historical sciences against methodological holism, namely the view that there is only one scientific method, and that this is the method of physics and natural science.\n\nWindelband shares the goal of securing the autonomy of the historical disciplines with his contemporary Wilhelm Dilthey. In his 1883 Einleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften [Introduction to the human sciences] Dilthey had founded the distinction between the natural sciences and the human sciences or \u201csciences of spirit\u201d on a distinction between outer and inner experience. While outer experience forms the basis of hypothetical knowledge in natural science, inner experience discloses \u201cfrom within\u201d how the individual is an intersection of social and cultural relations (Dilthey 1883: 30\u201332, 60\u201361, 88\u201389). Inner experience is at the same time psychological and socio-historical, and a descriptive psychology capable of grasping the integrated nexus of inner experience can provide the \u201csciences of spirit\u201d with a solid foundation (Dilthey 1894).\n\nWindelband profoundly disagrees with Dilthey\u2019s strategy for demarcating the historical disciplines. In his Strasbourg rector\u2019s address \u201cGeschichte und Naturwissenschaft\u201d [\u201cHistory and natural science\u201d] from 1894, he takes issue with the suggestion that the facts of the \u201csciences of spirit\u201d derive from a particular type of experience. He takes Dilthey to endorse an introspective view of psychological method. To this he objects that the facts of the historical disciplines do not derive from inner experience alone, and that inner perception is a dubious method in the first place. He also classifies psychology with the natural sciences, rejecting Dilthey\u2019s idea that the human-historical disciplines could be founded on a non-explanatory and non-hypothetical descriptive psychology. Perhaps most fundamentally, Windelband rejects the term \u201csciences of spirit\u201d on the ground that it suggests that the distinction between different sciences rests on a material distinction between different objects: spirit and nature (Windelband 1894: 141\u2013143).\n\nWindelband seeks an alternative method for science-classification that is purely formal. His reflections take scientific justification in its most abstract form as their starting point: justification in science is either inductive or deductive, Windelband argues, and the basic relation on which all knowledge is based is between the general and the particular (1883: 102\u2013103).\n\nThe distinction between different empirical sciences is then also to be sought at this level. In particular, Windelband argues that science might pursue one of two different \u201cknowledge goals\u201d (1894: 143): it \u201ceither seeks the general in the form of natural law or the particular in the historically determined form\u201d (1894: 145). The former approach is that of the \u201cnomothetic sciences\u201d which seek to arrive at universal apodictic judgments, treating the particular and unique as a mere exemplar or special case of the type or of the generic concept. The \u201cidiographic sciences\u201d, in contrast, aim to arrive at singular assertoric judgments that represent a unique object in its individual formation (1894: 150).\n\nWindelband emphasizes that the distinction between nomothetic and idiographic sciences is a purely formal and teleological one. One and the same object can be approached from both points of view, and which method is appropriate depends entirely on the goal or purpose of the investigation. Moreover, most sciences will involve both general and particular knowledge. The idiographic sciences in particular depend on general and causal knowledge which has been derived from the nomothetic sciences (1894: 156\u2013157).\n\nNote, however, that Windelband is not consistently restricting his analysis to the formal level. He tends to use the terms \u201cnomothetic\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d sciences, and the terms \u201cidiographic\u201d and \u201chistorical\u201d sciences interchangeably, which at least suggests a correspondence between scientific goals, methods, and objects.\n\nAlthough Windelband does not spell this out in great detail, he also suggests that values are of integral importance to the idiographic method. First, he argues that the selection of relevant historical facts depends on an assessment of what is valuable to us (1894: 153\u2013154). Second, he suggests that the integration of particular facts into larger wholes is only possible if meaningful, value-laden relations can be established such that \u201cthe particular feature is a meaningful part of a living intuition of the whole [Gesamtanschauung]\u201d (1894: 154). And third, he claims that we value the particular, unique, and individual in a way in which we do not value the general and recurrent, and that the experience of the individual is indeed at the root of our \u201cfeelings of value\u201d (1894: 155\u2013156).\n\nIt is Windelband\u2019s student Heinrich Rickert who takes up these suggestions and develops them into a systematic account of the \u201cindividuating\u201d and \u201cvalue-relating\u201d \u201cconcept-formation\u201d of the \u201chistorical sciences of culture\u201d (Rickert 1902). Rickert argues that \u201cscientific concept formation\u201d, by which science overcomes the \u201cextensive and intensive manifold\u201d of reality, depends on a principle of selection. The principle of selection at work in the natural sciences is that of \u201cgeneralization\u201d. For this reason, the natural sciences cannot account for the unique and unrepeatable character of reality. The historical sciences, in contrast, form their concepts in a manner that allows them to capture individual realities (Rickert 1902: 225, 236, 250\u2013251). They do so on the basis of values: values guide the selection of which particular historical facts belong to and can be integrated into a specific historical \u201cindividuality\u201d (examples being \u201cthe Renaissance\u201d, \u201cthe Reformation\u201d or \u201cthe German nation state\u201d). According to Rickert, one can clearly distinguish the theoretical value-relation that is the basis of historical science and practical evaluation. The historian relies on values but does not evaluate his material (Rickert 1902: 364\u2013365). Building on Windelband\u2019s core ideas about historical method, Rickert arrives at a more refined and systematized account of how historical science forms its concepts, that ultimately leads to an account of what culture as an object of scientific study amounts to.\n\nIn some of his later writings, Windelband will pick up the more developed thoughts of his student Rickert. For example, he claims that each science creates its objects according to the manner in which it forms its concepts (1907: 18), and that the historical sciences rely on a system of universal values when making selections about what enters into their concepts (1907: 20).\n\n6. The History of Philosophical Problems\n\nA large part of Windelband\u2019s oeuvre consists of writings in the history of philosophy. Windelband primarily covers modern philosophy from the Renaissance to his own time, but he also published on ancient philosophy. As a historian, Windelband is heavily indebted to Fischer. And yet, he goes significantly beyond his teacher, developing a new method and mode of historical presentation. Windelband conceives of the history of philosophy as a \u201chistory of problems\u201d. Rather than presenting a chronological sequence of great minds, he organizes the presentation of philosophical ideas according to the fundamental problems around which the philosophical debates and arguments of an age were structured. Windelband also takes a reflective attitude towards his own historiographical practice and seeks to clarify the goals and systematic relevance of the history of philosophy.\n\nIn these reflections, Windelband seeks to integrate two main thoughts: First, the idea that philosophy is a reflection of its time and age and, second, the conviction that the history of philosophy has systematic significance. Windelband finds both thoughts in Hegel\u2019s approach to the history of philosophy. Mirroring Hegel\u2019s famous dictum that \u201cphilosophy is its own time apprehended in thought\u201d, he speaks of philosophy the \u201cself-consciousness of developing cultural life\u201d (1909: 4). He also applauds Hegel\u2019s \u201cdeep insight\u201d that the history of philosophy realizes reason and thus has intrinsic relevance for systematic philosophy (1883: 133). Windelband thinks of history as the \u201corganon of philosophy\u201d (1905: 184), as a guide to the absolute values that the critical method seeks to reveal.\n\nBut despite the Hegelian gloss of these two claims, Windelband is critical of Hegelianism. This is primarily because he has a different understanding of the idea that philosophy is \u201cits own time apprehended in thought\u201d. For Windelband, this means that philosophical thinking is shaped by historically contingent factors.\n\nAccordingly, Windelband formulates two criticisms of the Hegelian conception of the history of philosophy. First, he finds fault with the idea that the order in which successive philosophical ideas emerge is necessary and that\u2014in virtue of being necessary\u2014it has systematic significance:\n\n[I]n its essentially empirical determination which is accidental with respect to the \u201cidea\u201d the historical process of development cannot have this systematic significance. (1883: 133, see also 1905: 176\u2013177)\n\nThe history of philosophy is not only shaped by the necessary self-expression of reason, but also by the causal necessity of cultural history. The cultural determinants of philosophical thinking lead to \u201cproblem-convolutions\u201d (1891: 11), in which various, conceptually unrelated philosophical questions merge with one another. Windelband also emphasizes that the \u201cindividual factor\u201d of the philosopher\u2019s character and personality is relevant for how philosophical problems and concepts are articulated in a given historical moment (1891: 12)\n\nSecond, although Windelband agrees that the historical development of philosophical ideas is partly driven by critique and self-improvement, he does not think of this process in terms of progress. Windelband probes the often unacknowledged presuppositions of our talk about progress. In \u201cPessimismus und Wissenschaft\u201d (1876) Windelband argues that science cannot decide between historical optimism and historical pessimism (1876: 243). In \u201cKritische und genetische Methode\u201d (1883) he gives a more detailed analysis of why this is the case. Historical change itself is not progress, he observes. In order to determine whether a given historical development is progressive, we need to be in possession of \u201ca standard, the idea of a purpose, which determines the value of the change\u201d (1883: 119). Windelband is wary of triumphalist narratives that identify the historical development of present-day values with progress. History is determined by contingent cultural factors and could have produced \u201cdelusions and follies \u2026 which we only take to be truths now because we are inescapably trapped in them\u201d (1883: 121). Of progress we can only speak legitimately, if we are in possession of an absolute value that allows us to assess the historical development. At minimum, this means that the appeal to a progressive history of philosophy is of no help when it comes to the systematic task of uncovering the system of absolute values: progress cannot aid in revealing absolute values as it presupposes them.\n\nBut while the fact that philosophy is at least partly determined by contingent cultural factors undercuts necessity and progress, it also opens the door for a reconceptualization of the \u201cessence\u201d of philosophy. In his Einleitung in die Philosophie [Introduction to philosophy] (1914) Windelband reflects on the fact that everyday life, culture, and science do already contain general concepts of the world. These concepts form the initial content of philosophical reflection (1914: 6). But the business of philosophy only takes off when these initial concepts, and the assumptions that are baked into them, become unstable and collapse. An experience of shock and unsettling prompts philosophy to question, rethink, and critically assess the concepts and ideas of everyday life and science. In this process of critical assessment, philosophy strives to purify these concepts and ideas, and to connect them into a coherent, unified system. According to Windelband, in this process of conceptual reorganization, a rational necessity exerts itself. The \u201cvigorous and uncompromising rethinking of the preconditions of our spiritual life\u201d creates certain philosophical problems \u201cwith objective necessity\u201d (1914: 8).\n\nWindelband provides neither a very detailed account of what \u201cphilosophical problems\u201d exactly are, nor of how precisely they spring from the unsettling of everyday concepts. But he makes three claims that, taken together, establish that philosophy, even when reflecting its particular age, is not solely determined by contingent cultural factors. First, philosophical puzzles stem from the \u201cinadequacy and contradictory imbalance\u201d of the contents that philosophy receives from life and science (1891: 10). That is, true philosophical problems emerge whenever the systematizing drive of philosophy is confronted with the deep incoherence of life. Second, philosophical problems are necessary because the conceptual \u201cmaterial\u201d found in life already contains \u201cthe objective presuppositions and logical coercions for all rational deliberation about it\u201d (1891: 10). The necessity of philosophical problems is logical necessity. Third, despite historical change\n\n[c]ertain differences of world- and life-attitudes reoccur over and over again, combat each other and destroy each other in mutual dialectics. (1914: 10)\n\nBecause philosophical problems emerge \u201cnecessarily\u201d and \u201cobjectively\u201d, they also reoccur throughout history. Philosophical problems are thus timeless and eternal (1891: 9\u201310; 1914: 11)).\n\nWindelband also believes that the history of philosophy, pursued empirically and scientifically, can disentangle from one another the \u201ctemporal causes and timeless reasons\u201d (1905: 189) that together give rise to the emergence of philosophical problems.\n\nOnly through knowledge of the empirical trajectory that is free of constructions can come to light \u2026. what is the share of \u2026 the needs of the age on the one hand\u2026but on the other hand that of the objective necessities of conceptual progress. (1905: 189)\n\nAt this point, Windelband reaches a clear verdict on the goal and systematic significance of the history of philosophy: it lies in disentangling that which is contingently actually accepted from that which is \u201cvalid in itself\u201d (1905: 199). History is the \u201corganon of critical philosophy\u201d precisely to the extent that it allows us to distinguish the actually accepted norms of cultural life from that which is absolutely valid (1883: 132).\n\n7. Critical Philosophy and World-Views\n\nWindelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d is also an intervention into debates that had preoccupied the neo-Kantian movement and German academic philosophy more broadly since the materialism controversy [Materialismusstreit]: what the relation between science and world-views is, and whether philosophy is capable of providing a \u201cworld-view\u201d.\n\nGiven that he takes the core of the critical project to consist in a quaestio juris\u2014a concern with normativity\u2014it seems surprising that throughout the 1880s Windelband insists that critical philosophy does not provide a \u201cworld-view\u201d: the project of revealing the highest values of human life has nothing to do with \u201cworld-views\u201d, he argues, because it does not provide a metaphysical account of the world and our place in it (1881: 140\u2013141, 145). Questions about optimism or pessimism cannot be answered by means of \u201cscientific\u201d philosophy, since they depend on the idea that the world as a whole has a purpose. And claims about the ultimate purpose of the world arise only from an unscientific, subjective, and arbitrary projection of particular purposes onto the universe as such (1876: 231). Philosophy is a science, albeit a second-order formal science, and is thus barred from formulating a world-view that would be metaphysical in character.\n\nAfter 1900, however, Windelband\u2019s position on the question of world-views changes. He now claims that it is the aim of philosophy to provide a \u201cworld-view\u201d with scientific justification (1907: 1). Given that Windelband holds that philosophy in general and the Kantian project in particular need to be adapted to the developing circumstances of time and culture, this change of position is not inconsequential: the cultural landscape of the early 1900s demands a revision of the neo-Kantian project that highlights not only its \u201cnegative\u201d and critical aspects, but also develops its positive implications for cultural life (1907, 8). The shift to a more positive attitude towards philosophy as a world-view corresponds to a re-evaluation of Kant\u2019s oeuvre, in which Windelband at least partly suspends the anti-metaphysical rigor of the \u201cthird phase\u201d of the genesis of the Critique of Pure Reason, and attributes more relevance to the Critique of the Power of Judgment. This view is taken up by Rickert, who later argues in more detail that the third Critique forms the core of critical philosophy, and that Kant\u2019s metaphysical project can provide the basis for an encompassing theory of world-views (Rickert 1924: 153\u2013168).\n\nIn his 1904 \u201cNach hundert Jahren\u201d [\u201cAfter one hundred years\u201d] Windelband provides yet another take on the relation between the natural and the normative. Declaring the question how the realm of natural laws is related to the realm of values to be the \u201chighest\u201d philosophical endeavor (1904a: 162), he now sees in the Critique of the Power of Judgment the possibility of solving this problem: here one finds the idea that the purposive system of nature gives rise to the value-determined process of human history. The central concept that allows for connecting nature and history in this way is that of \u201crealization\u201d (1904a: 162\u20133).\n\nThe turn to the concept of \u201crealization\u201d also leads to a shift in how Windelband approaches the problem of science classification. In 1894, Windelband had thought of the nomothetic and idiographic sciences as two fundamental yet disjointed and even incommensurable approaches to seeking knowledge of the word: \u201cLaw and event persist next to each other as the last, incommensurable factors of our representation of the world\u201d (1894: 160). But in 1904, he claims that the concept of realization provides a common, unified basis for the natural and the historical sciences (1904a: 163).\n\nWindelband\u2019s language assumes a Hegelian tone. Critical philosophy equipped with the concept of realization is able to grasp and express the \u201cspiritual value content\u201d of reality (1904a: 165). History is capable of revealing the universal value content in the contingent maze of human interests and desires, and in so doing captures \u201cthe progressive realization of rational values\u201d (1907: 20\u201321). The human as a rational being is not determined psychologically or naturally, but humanity is a historical task: \u201conly as a historical being, as the developing species, do we have a share in world-reason\u201d (1910a: 283: see also 1905: 185). Windelband even suggests that history itself has a goal, namely the realization of a common humanity (1908: 257).\n\nThese remarks remain cursory however, and there is room for debate over how much of Hegel\u2019s ontology of history Windelband takes on board, as well as whether his talk about the progressive realization of reason in history is incompatible with the formal-teleological method that he had endorsed in the 1880s and 1890s. His \u201cKulturphilosophie und transzendentaler Idealismus\u201d [\u201cPhilosophy of culture and transcendental idealism\u201d] of 1910 presents us with a puzzling fusion of Kantian and Hegelian language. The goal of critical philosophy is that of revealing the unity of culture, Windelband now claims, and this unity can only be found"}, {"url": "https://study.com/academy/lesson/nomothetic-vs-idiographic-differences-approaches-examples.html", "page_content": "The Idiographic Approach\n\nThe idiographic approach is the opposite of the nomothetic approach. Rather than focusing on generalities, the idiographic approach focuses on individual differences, qualitative data, and individual experiences. In other words, it is the study of individuals rather than groups. The term \"idiographic\" comes from the Greek word \"idios\" which means \"private\". There have been several different approaches that fall under the umbrella of idiographic psychology, including phenomenology, hermeneutics, and case study methods. Each of these approaches has a different focus, but all share the common goal of understanding behavior from the perspective of the individual.\n\nStrengths and Weaknesses of the Idiographic Approach\n\nThe idiographic approach has been criticized for its lack of objectivity and its reliance on subjective data. However, the approach has several strengths that make it a valuable tool for the study of behavior. These strengths include:\n\nIt allows for a more in-depth understanding of behavior: By focusing on individual differences, the idiographic approach can provide insights into how and why people behave the way they do in specific situations. Additionally, the use of case studies and clinical observations can provide rich data that can be used to generate hypotheses about behavior.\n\nIt can be used to study rare events: Since the focus is on individual differences, the idiographic approach can be used to study behaviors that are not often observed in experiments. For example, case studies have been used to understand why some people develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after experiencing a traumatic event.\n\nIdiographic approach weaknesses include:\n\nIt can be difficult to generalize the findings of research to the population as a whole: Since the focus is on individual differences, it can be difficult to identify general principles that govern behavior. The use of case studies and clinical observations can make it difficult to replicate research findings.\n\nThe complex and costly nature of the idiographic approach: Due to its focus on in-depth analysis of single cases, the idiographic approach can often be time-consuming and expensive.\n\nIdiographic vs. Nomothetic Research\n\nWhen conducting research, psychologists must consider what blend of an idiographic vs nomothetic approach should be taken. The choice of approach depends on the goals of the research and the type of data that is available. If the goal of the research is to identify general laws that govern behavior, then more of a nomothetic approach is typically used. This approach relies on experiments and surveys to collect data. The data is then analyzed to identify general trends and patterns.\n\nIf the goal of the research is to understand the unique experiences of individuals, then more of an idiographic approach is typically used. This approach relies on case studies and clinical observations to collect data. The data is then analyzed to identify individual differences.\n\nMany researchers believe the best method is a combination of both approaches. For example, if the goal of the research is to understand how stress affects health, then the researcher might use both an idiographic and nomothetic approach. The researcher could use case studies to understand how stress affects health in individual people and surveys to identify general trends in how stress affects the health of general populations. The data and findings from both approaches would then be combined to form a more complete understanding of the issue."}, {"url": "https://www.douban.com/group/182598/", "page_content": "1\n\n\u8bf7\u52ff\u53d1\u5e03\u300a\u793e\u533a\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\u300b\u4e0d\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\n\n\u4e3a\u5171\u540c\u7ef4\u62a4\u793e\u533a\u7684\u826f\u597d\u6c1b\u56f4\uff0c\u8bf7\u52a1\u5fc5\u9075\u5b88\u53d1\u8a00\u89c4\u5219\u3002\u793e\u533a\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u5c06\u5220\u9664\u5df2\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u53d1\u5e03\u8005\u505a\u51fa\u7981\u8a00\u3001\u5c01\u7981\u3001\u79fb\u51fa\u5c0f\u7ec4\u7b49\u76f8\u5e94\u5904\u7f5a\u3002\n\n\u2022 \u8fdd\u53cd\u4e2d\u56fd\u6216\u8c46\u74e3\u7528\u6237\u6240\u5728\u5730\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6cd5\u89c4\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\uff1b\n\n\u2022 \u9488\u5bf9\u79cd\u65cf\u3001\u56fd\u5bb6\u3001\u6c11\u65cf\u3001\u5b97\u6559\u3001\u6027\u522b\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u5730\u7f18\u3001\u6027\u53d6\u5411\u3001\u751f\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6b67\u89c6\u548c\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\uff1b\n\n\u2022 \u6fc0\u8fdb\u65f6\u653f\u3001\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff1b\n\n\u2022 \u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u96c5\u8bcd\u53e5\u3001\u8fb1\u9a82\u3001\u9a9a\u6270\u4ed6\u4eba\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u4e0d\u53cb\u5584\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\n\n\u2022 \u4fb5\u72af\u4ed6\u4eba\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\n\n\u2022 \u5a01\u80c1\u4ed6\u4eba\u6216\u8c46\u74e3\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4eba\u8eab\u3001\u8d22\u4ea7\u7b49\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\n\n\u2022 \u6ee5\u7528\u4ea7\u54c1\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u4ea7\u54c1\u751f\u6001\u53ca\u6c1b\u56f4\uff0c\u5982\u6076\u610f\u653b\u51fb\u5c0f\u7ec4\u7ec4\u957f\u6216\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u7684\u6b63\u5e38\u7ba1\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u7b49\u3002"}, {"url": "https://handwiki.org/wiki/Biography:Wilhelm_Windelband", "page_content": "Short description : German philosopher, 1848-1915\n\nWilhelm Windelband ( ; German: [\u02c8v\u026andl\u0329bant]; 11 May 1848 \u2013 22 October 1915) was a German philosopher of the Baden School.\n\nHis grave in Heidelberg\n\nBiography\n\nWindelband was born the son of a Prussian official in Potsdam.

An idiographic theory accounts for the facts in a single case. A nomothetic theory accounts for the facts in many cases. The more cases that a theory accounts for, the more nomothetic it is.\n\nThe distinction was first made by Wilhelm Windelband, a philosopher of science, in 1894. By the late 1800s, Wilhelm Dilthey\u2019s distinction between the Naturwissenschaften and Geisteswissenschaften\u2014the sciences of nature and the sciences of the mind\u2014had become quite popular. The problem with Dilthey\u2019s distinction, said Windelband, was that it couldn\u2019t accommodate the then brand-new science of psychology. The subject matter made psychology a Geisteswissenchaft, but the discipline relied on the experimental method, and this made it a Naturwissenschaft.\n\nWhat to do? Yes, said Windelband, the search for reliable knowledge is, indeed, of two kinds: the sciences of law and the sciences of events, or, in a memorable turn of phrase,\n\n\u2018\u2018the study of what always is and the study of what once was.\u2019\u2019 Windelband coined the terms idiographic and nomothetic to replace Dilthey\u2019s Natur- and Geisteswissenschaften.\n\nOrganic evolution is governed by laws, Windelband observed, but the sequence of organisms on this planet is an event that is not likely to be repeated on any other planet. Languages are governed by laws, but any given language at any one time is an event in human linguistic life. The goal of the idiographic, or historical sciences, then, is to deliver \u2018\u2018portraits of humans and human life with all the richness of their unique forms\u2019\u2019 (Windelband 1998 [1894]:16).\n\nWindelband went further. Every causal explanation of an event\u2014every idiographic analysis, in other words\u2014requires some idea of how things happen at all. No matter how vague the idea, there must be nomothetic principles guiding idiographic analysis.\n\nWindelband\u2019s formulation is a perfect description of what all natural scientists\u2014 vulcanologists, ornithologists, astronomers, ethnographers\u2014do all the time. They describe things; they develop deep understanding of the cases they study,and they produce explanations for individual cases based on nomothetic rules. The study of a volcanic eruption, of a species\u2019 nesting habits, of a star\u2019s death is no more likely to produce new nomothetic knowledge than is the study of a culture\u2019s adaptation to new circumstances. But the idiographic effort, based on the application of nomothetic rules, is required equally across all the sciences if induction is to be applied and greater nomothetic knowledge achieved.\n\nThose efforts in psychology are well known: Sigmund Freud based his theory of psychosexual development on just a few cases. Jean Piaget did the same in developing his universal theory of cognitive development, as did B. F. Skinner in developing the theory of operant conditioning.\n\nIn anthropology, Lewis Henry Morgan (1877) and others made a brave, if ill-fated effort in the 19th century to create nomothetic theories about the evolution of culture from the study of cases at hand. The unilineal evolutionary theories they advanced were wrong, but the effort to produce nomothetic theory was not wrong. Franz Boas and his students made clear the importance of paying careful attention to the particulars of each culture, but Leslie White (1959) and Julian Steward (1949, 1955) did not reject the idea that cultures evolve. Instead, they advanced more nuanced theories about how the process works.\n\nSteward (1955) chose just a handful of cases when he developed his theory of cultural evolution. Over time, data from Tehuacan, Mexico, and Ali Kosh, Iran\u20146,000 miles and several thousand years apart\u2014support Steward\u2019s nomothetic formulation about the multistage transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture. (The sequences appear to be similar responses to the retreat of the last glacier of the Paleolithic.) As we get more comparisons, the big picture will either become more and more nomothetic or it will be challenged.\n\nAnd the effort goes on. Wittfogel (1957) developed his so-called hydraulic theory of cultural evolution\u2014that complex civilizations, in Mexico, India, China, Egypt, and Mesopotamia developed out of the need to organize the distribution of water for irrigation\u2014 based on idiographic knowledge of a handful of cases. David Price (1995) studied a modern, bureaucratically organized water supply system in the Fayoum area of Egypt. The further downstream a farmer\u2019s plot is from an irrigation pump, the less water he is likely to get because farmers upstream divert more water than the system allows them legally to have. Price\u2019s in-depth, idiographic analysis of the Fayoum irrigation system lends support to Wittfogel\u2019s long neglected theory because, says Price, it shows \u2018\u2018how farmers try to optimize the disadvantaged position in which the state has placed them\u2019\u2019\n\n(1995:107-108). Susan Lees (1986) showed how farmers in Israel, Kenya, and Sudan got around bureaucratic limitations on the water they were allotted. We need much more idiographic analysis, more explanations of cases, to test the limitations of Wittfogel\u2019s theory. (See Harrower [2009] for recent archeological work in southern Arabia on the role of irrigation systems in state formation.)"}, {"url": "https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/694382", "page_content": "Nomothetic and idiographic are terms used by Kantian philosopher Wilhelm Windelband to describe two distinct approaches to knowledge, each one corresponding to a different intellectual tendency, and each one corresponding to a different branch of academe.\n\nNomothetic is based on what Kant described as a tendency to generalize, and is typical for the natural sciences. It describes the effort to derive laws that explain objective phenomena in general.\n\nIdiographic is based on what Kant described as a tendency to specify, and is typical for the humanities. It describes the effort to understand the meaning of contingent, unique, and often subjective phenomena.\n\nUse in the social sciences\n\nThe problem of whether to use nomothetic or idiographic approaches is most sharply felt in the social sciences, whose subject are unique individuals (idiographic perspective), but who have certain general properties or behave according to general rules (nomothetic perspective).\n\nOften, nomothetic approaches are quantitative, and idiographic approaches are qualitative, although the \"Personal Questionnaire\" developed by M.B. Shapiro, and its further developments (e.g. Discan scale) are both quantitative and idiographic. Personal cognition (D.A. Booth) is idiographic, qualitative and quantitative, using the individual's own narrative of action within situation to scale the ongoing biosocial cognitive processes in units of discrimination from norm (with M.T. Conner 1986, R.P.J. Freeman 1993 and O. Sharpe 2005).\n\nIn psychology, idiographic describes the study of the individual, who is seen as a unique agent with a unique life history, with properties setting him/her apart from other individuals (see idiographic image). A common method to study these unique characteristics is an (auto)biography, i.e. a narrative that recounts the unique sequence of events that made the person who she is. Nomothetic describes the study of classes or cohorts of individuals. Here the subject is seen as an exemplar of a population and their corresponding personality traits and behaviours. The terms idiographic and nomothetic were introduced to American psychology by Gordon Allport in 1937, who borrowed them from the German philosopher Wilhelm Windelband.\n\nIn sociology, the nomothetic model tries to find independent variables that account for the variations in a given phenomenon (e.g. What is the relationship between timing/frequency of childbirth and education). Nomothetic explanations are probabilistic and usually incomplete. The idiographic model focuses on a complete, in-depth understanding of a single case (e.g. Why do I not have any children).\n\nIn anthropology, idiographic describes the study of a group, seen as an entity, with specific properties that set it apart from other groups. Nomothetic refers to the use of generalization rather than specific properties in the same context.\n\nReferences\n\nCone, J. D. (1986).
