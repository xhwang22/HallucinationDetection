He was not overly physical in his defending either, preferring to win the ball through quick thinking and anticipation rather than just brute strength. So in some ways he was ahead of his time.\n\nThis refined approach to the game made him a popular player among the Celtic support and the Scotland selectors who capped him 14 times.\n\nHe became the captain in 1961, and then led the first team to the Scottish Cup matches v Dunfermline (the final & replay), but in both unfortunately Celtic once again came up short and lost. The side were perennially underachieving despite the wealth of talent on hand.\n\nWith Celtic so poor, he actually decided openly to request a move to England, but there was surprisingly little interest (Celtic\u2019s poor state a likely major cause of the lack of interest). You have to take in the poor team management at the time at Celtic, lack of morale in the squad and the constant board meddling. It wasn\u2019t an uncommon position. Jimmy Johnstone, Billy McNeill and Lennox were all also on the verge of leaving or giving up before Jock Stein\u2019s arrival at Celtic.\n\nDuncan McKay lost the captaincy to Billy McNeill in 1963, and his place in the first team later in the year. His last game was a single appearance in the 1964/65 season with a 4-2 defeat to Hearts.\n\nHe was not a heavy goalscorer, but curiously once he scored his first the others soon enough followed. He took a long time to score his first for Celtic, a penalty in a 7-0 victory over St Mirren in November 1962. However, over April & May 1963, he scored five goals (all penalties), including a double over Raith Rovers in a Scottish Cup semi-final. His last goal (also a penalty) was in October 1963 as Celtic defeated Aberdeen 3-0.\n\nIt was a great injustice to Duncan McKay\u2019s wonderful ability that he never won any major trophies as a Celt. This popular player eventually left Parkhead in 1964 for Third Lanark after 236 appearances and 7 goals.\n\nThe saddest aspect is that he was a great player in one of the poorer eras for Celtic. After the League Cup win in 1957, Celtic did not win another major trophy again until 1965. His first team career sadly spanned practically the whole of this period. Jock Stein became the club manager only a few months after Duncan Mackay\u2019s departure. If Jock Stein had arrived sooner then possibly Duncan Mackay could have won a medal worthy of his talents.\n\nHe is one of the finest regular long-term first team Celtic players to leave Celtic without a medal for a major trophy (Willie Miller is another in this group). He deserved better, and it is an indictment of the club at the time for just how poor the First Team were.\n\nHowever, the Celtic support more then recognised his talent. In 1967, following the triumph in Lisbon in the European Cup, a poll by the Evening Times amongst its readers surveyed for the best Celtic team in living memory. To his credit, Duncan MacKay walked in at right-back. A great accolade and a mark of the respect the support had for him.\n\nAfter Third Lanark, he moved to Australia to play for various sides and then later to coach clubs there also, with a brief period back home in Scotland between 1972-74 when he was player-coach with Juniors St Anthony\u2019s.\n\nHe passed away in December 2018, coincidentally just a few weeks after the passing of Ian Young who had succeeded him as the right-back at Celtic.\n\nPlaying Career\n\nAPPEARANCES LEAGUE SCOTTISH CUP LEAGUE CUP EUROPE TOTAL 1955-64 162 33 37 \u2013 236 Goals 5 2 0 \u2013 7\n\nHonours with Celtic\n\nnone\n\nPictures\n\nForums\n\nArticles\n\nDuncan MacKay Source: http://sesasport.com/?p=760 Duncan MacKay had a relatively short but stellar career with Celtic, racking up 236 games for the club from 1958 to 1964 and 14 Scottish caps in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He moved to Third Lanark in 1964 when Bill Hiddleston was engaged in the destruction of that club and in 1965 Frank Burin from the Croatia club in Melbourne persuaded him to try his luck in Australia. Mackay had an immediate impact on the club which had just been promoted to the Victorian State League, the top division. Croatia had been up and down between the State League and lower divisions over previous seasons but this time president Enver Begovic organised an open cheque-book approach that resulted in the expenditure of \u00a35000 in two months. Hammy McMeechan from Slavia was signed for a Victorian record fee of \u00a31200. Other newcomers were Joe Keenan, Ian Currie, Bobby McLachlan, Bill McIntyre and Brian Adlam. Croatia finished sixth in 1965. It was the \u2018Glamour Team\u2019 of the season, according to the Victorian Soccer Federation Yearbook. The early season form had been poor, six of the first seven games were lost, and it looked as if Croatia would go back down again, but the attraction of Duncan MacKay and the other players resulted in a transformation in the second half of the season when it finished with eleven wins. Croatia was also runner-up in the Dockerty Cup in 1965. The team which was to take Croatia to the top in Victoria and Australia was now in place. Croatia finished 6th in 1966, 3rd in 1967 under Jimmy Adam, and won the State League for the first time in 1968 under coach Mijo Kiss, finishing seven points clear of Polonia. Only four league games were lost all season. In addition, Croatia won the Ampol Cup and the Dockerty Cup, to complete an extraordinary triumph. In 1972 after an incident involving crowd trouble in a match against Hakoah, Croatia was suspended from the Victorian Soccer Federation and eventually refused permission to regain its position in the State League. It was not till 1974 that the Croatians took over Essendon Lions and resumed participation at a lower level. Duncan MacKay returned to Scotland in March 1972 and was player-coach at St Anthony\u2019s, but he came back to Australia to the Azzurri club in Western Australia in 1974 and in 1977 he returned to Melbourne with Essendon Lions as player-coach.\n\nDeath of Celtic great Duncan MacKay\n\nBy: Newsroom Staff on 26 Dec, 2019 11:31\n\nhttp://www.celticfc.net/news/17326\n\nEVERYONE at Celtic Football Club is saddened to hear of the death of former player, Duncan MacKay, who has passed away at the age of 82.\n\nDunky, who played for the Hoops between 1955-64, making 236 appearances and scoring seven goals, is rightly considered a Celtic great. His first-team debut came in August 1958, in a League Cup tie against Clyde at Shawfield, which Celtic won 4-1, and he soon established himself as first-choice right-back in the team.\n\nA highly-rated defender who was an early exponent of the attacking full-back role later honed by the likes of Tommy Gemmell and Jim Craig, Dunky MacKay was a firm fans\u2019 favourite and his leadership qualities were identified by Jimmy McGrory, who made him captain in 1961, succeeding Bertie Peacock as skipper.\n\nHe would later pass on the captain\u2019s armband to Billy McNeill for the start of the 1963/64 season.\n\nIn November 1984, he moved to Third Lanark, before heading out to Australia where he would eventually settle after a brief return to Scotland. He also gained 14 caps for Scotland during his playing career.\n\nThe thoughts and prayers of everyone at Celtic are with Duncan\u2019s family and friends at this very sad time.\n\nThe Celtic players will wear black armbands at today\u2019s game against St Mirren as a mark of respect.\n\nObituary: Duncan Mackay, highly esteemed Celtic full-back who won honours in Australia\n\nBy Matt Vallance\n\n(2)\n\nSource: https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/18141730.obituary-duncan-mackay-highly-esteemed-celtic-full-back-won-honours-australia/Former Celtic captain and Scotland full-back\n\nBorn:July 14, 1937;\n\nDied: December 23, 2019.\n\nIT IS a long way from Maryhill to Melbourne, but in his 82 years that was the journey made by the esteemed former Celtic and Scotland full-back Dunky Mackay.\n\nLike many before him, Duncan\u2019s father, also Duncan, had left the West Highlands for the city, where he worked at several jobs to keep a roof over his family\u2019s head. He insisted the young Duncan wore his Mackay tartan kilt every day. But getting into schoolyard scrapes when responding to taunts of \u201cKiltie, kiltie cauld-bum\u201d began to wear thin with the youngster, and he persuaded his parents to get him into long trousers.\n\nAt St Columba\u2019s High his exceptional skill with a football got him noticed. He moved to St Mary\u2019s Boys\u2019 Guild, where Celtic signed him on a provisional form, farming him out to juniors, Maryhill Harp. By now the teenaged Mackay had seen the great Hungarian side of Ferenc Puskas and the sort of attacking football he wanted to play. He had left school and started an apprenticeship as a marine engineer.\n\nHe turned full-time at Celtic after completing his apprenticeship. During the 1958-59 campaign he made the first of his 236 first-team appearances in a League Cup tie against Clyde. By season\u2019s end he was first choice, and an Under-23 cap. On April 11, 1959, aged 21, he made the first of an eventual 14 appearances for Scotland, against England at Wembley.\n\nHis full-back partner that day was Rangers\u2019 Eric Caldow and the pair hit it off immediately. Indeed, they played together 12 times for Scotland, making Mackay Caldow\u2019s most frequent international partner. Caldow would relate how, as Scotland captain, he once distributed \u2018fan mail\u2019 when the national squad was training at Largs; finding one addressed to \u201cDonkey Mackay\u2019 he quipped, \u201cThis lassie must have seen you playing, Dunky\u201d. In reality, Caldow, rated his Celtic friend very highly as a player.\n\nBut, if things were going well with Scotland, all was not well at Celtic Park, where, following the 1957 League Cup win, the side struggled to compete with Rangers, Kilmarnock and Hearts, then the top teams. Bertie Peacock left the club and Mackay was appointed team captain in 1960, leading them to the Scottish Cup final of 1961, where they lost to Dunfermline after a replay. Indeed, along with 1940s goalkeeper Willie Miller, Mackay shares the \u201cdistinction\u201d of having won more Scotland caps than medals as a Celtic player.\n\nIn 1963 he lost the captaincy to Billy McNeill, then, after injury he lost his first-team place, partly because, it is rumoured, manager Jimmy McGrory and chairman Bob Kelly, who picked the side, did not like Mackay\u2019s attacking sorties up the wing.\n\nIn November, 1964, he left Celtic for Third Lanark. This is one of Scottish football\u2019s great \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d; maybe, had he hung on until Jock Stein returned in February, 1965, he would have regained his place. Stein certainly preferred attacking full-backs. But Thirds were starting to implode and at the end of that season, Mackay joined Melbourne Croatia, who were spending big in a bid to become the top side in the Victoria League.\n\nHe was an instant success, being appointed captain and winning the Player of the Year title in his first season. He led Croatia to several trophies, including a league-and-two-cups treble in 1972, but the club fell foul of Australian Soccer financial rules and collapsed. Mackay returned to Scotland for two seasons, working as a bookbinder and coaching junior outfit St Anthony\u2019s.\n\nHis first marriage, when a young man, had failed. But while, back home, he married his second wife, Marilyn, before, in 1974, Perth Azzurri, in Western Australia, offered him a player-coach role.\n\nHe led the Azzurri to back-to-back league titles, then returned to Melbourne, to Essendon Lions, as Croatia had now become. Here he found success as a league-winning coach, before winding down his active involvement in football with South Melbourne Hellas.\n\nMelbourne clearly suited Mackay. In his first spell with Croatia, he turned down the chance to join Pele at New York Cosmos. His non-football working life turned full circle when he joined Transfeld Ship Builders as a Senior Procurement Buyer \u2013 the post he filled until his retirement.\n\nHe and Marilyn, who survives him, had two daughters, Shone and Elissa. He is also survived by son Duncan Junior, from his first marriage, who also lives in Australia. Paul, another son from that first marriage predeceased his father. In retirement, Mackay enjoyed listening to the Beatles, Barbra Streisand and Tony Bennett.\n\nDunky Mackay was a very good full-back. He was Celtic\u2019s Player of the Year in 1963, and Man of the Match when they played Real Madrid at Parkhead in a friendly. Sadly, he never had the medals to show for playing at a low point in the club\u2019s history, but on the other side of the world he finally won a few medals, forged a good reputation as a coach, and perhaps showed Scottish football what it lost when it allowed him to leave.\n\nMATT VALLANCE"}, {"url": "https://www.ancientfaces.com/person/duncan-ross-mackay-birth-1955-death-1963/123893604", "page_content": "Refresh this page to see various historical events that occurred during Duncan's lifetime.\n\nIn 1955, in the year that Duncan Ross Mackay was born, on September 30th, movie star James Dean, 24, died in a car accident.

Engineering was deemed, under the Essential Works Order, a trade needed at home.\n\nFollowing the engineering course in Glasgow, illness in his family, and now in a post war situation Duncan returned to his native Island to find that following the end of the war all \u2018War Work\u2019 had dried up. Unemployment was looking a distinct possibility but for the work orientated Duncan this was not an option.\n\nDuncans parents bought him a Harris Tweed Loom for \u00a3100.00 which he spent the next 2/3 years at before his love of the outdoor life took him firmly back there. He had diversified a small bit while weaving and started to buy the wool from neighbouring crofters and then creating the tweed with the Mills only involvement being in the finishing process.\n\n\n\nEven at this stage in his career Duncan was offering his services as an Agricultural contractor in the form of Duncan Mackay, Horse, Cart and Plough. Ploughing and harrowing agricultural land but at the same time bringing home the Peats\u2019, for both himself and neighbouring crofters.\n\nHis reputation as a hard working, reliable and thorough \u2018contractor\u2019 meant that not only did his workload rocket but horse sales increased as crofters realised they now had no need of, or expense associated with keeping a horse if Duncan was around.\n\nAs Duncans workload increased he soon realised that he had to embrace \u2018modern technology\u2019 (of the era), and through the money he had saved from his time weaving, put down the deposit on a Ferguson TE20 Petrol Tractor in addition to plough, harrows and an old lorry. It was at this time that Duncan began a seeding and sand spreading service as well as beginning to make concrete blocks.\n\nIt was not long before the local council called upon his services with his first (of many) contracts. The installation of street lighting and it was not long before the council began recommending him throughout the Islands of Lewis and Harris.\n\nAs his family were born, Duncan Mackay and Sons was born. The eldest son, Donald, chose to move away from the Island and pursue a career in civil engineering in his own right. Iain Hector and \u2018Buddy\u2019 were the more \u2018stay at home\u2019 sons who have continued to develop the business to where it now stands.\n\nDuncan is immensely proud of how his sons and daughter Chris have developed the business embracing everything that modern day engineering requires and when asked at which point he retired he replied \u201c I have never retired, just grown older \u201c."}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/87274.Duncan_Mackay", "page_content": "* Note: these are all the books on Goodreads for this author.

He insisted the young Duncan wore his Mackay tartan kilt every day. But getting into schoolyard scrapes when responding to taunts of \u201cKiltie, kiltie cauld-bum\u201d began to wear thin with the youngster, and he persuaded his parents to get him into long trousers.\n\nAt St Columba\u2019s High his exceptional skill with a football got him noticed. He moved to St Mary\u2019s Boys' Guild, where Celtic signed him on a provisional form, farming him out to juniors, Maryhill Harp. By now the teenaged Mackay had seen the great Hungarian side of Ferenc Puskas and the sort of attacking football he wanted to play. He had left school and started an apprenticeship as a marine engineer.\n\nHe turned full-time at Celtic after completing his apprenticeship. During the 1958-59 campaign he made the first of his 236 first-team appearances in a League Cup tie against Clyde. By season's end he was first choice, and an Under-23 cap. On April 11, 1959, aged 21, he made the first of an eventual 14 appearances for Scotland, against England at Wembley.\n\nHis full-back partner that day was Rangers\u2019 Eric Caldow and the pair hit it off immediately. Indeed, they played together 12 times for Scotland, making Mackay Caldow\u2019s most frequent international partner. Caldow would relate how, as Scotland captain, he once distributed \u2018fan mail\u2019 when the national squad was training at Largs; finding one addressed to \u201cDonkey Mackay\u2019 he quipped, \u201cThis lassie must have seen you playing, Dunky\u201d. In reality, Caldow, rated his Celtic friend very highly as a player.\n\nBut, if things were going well with Scotland, all was not well at Celtic Park, where, following the 1957 League Cup win, the side struggled to compete with Rangers, Kilmarnock and Hearts, then the top teams. Bertie Peacock left the club and Mackay was appointed team captain in 1960, leading them to the Scottish Cup final of 1961, where they lost to Dunfermline after a replay. Indeed, along with 1940s goalkeeper Willie Miller, Mackay shares the \"distinction\u201d of having won more Scotland caps than medals as a Celtic player.\n\nIn 1963 he lost the captaincy to Billy McNeill, then, after injury he lost his first-team place, partly because, it is rumoured, manager Jimmy McGrory and chairman Bob Kelly, who picked the side, did not like Mackay\u2019s attacking sorties up the wing.\n\nIn November, 1964, he left Celtic for Third Lanark. This is one of Scottish football\u2019s great \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d; maybe, had he hung on until Jock Stein returned in February, 1965, he would have regained his place. Stein certainly preferred attacking full-backs. But Thirds were starting to implode and at the end of that season, Mackay joined Melbourne Croatia, who were spending big in a bid to become the top side in the Victoria League.\n\nHe was an instant success, being appointed captain and winning the Player of the Year title in his first season. He led Croatia to several trophies, including a league-and-two-cups treble in 1972, but the club fell foul of Australian Soccer financial rules and collapsed. Mackay returned to Scotland for two seasons, working as a bookbinder and coaching junior outfit St Anthony\u2019s.\n\nHis first marriage, when a young man, had failed. But while, back home, he married his second wife, Marilyn, before, in 1974, Perth Azzurri, in Western Australia, offered him a player-coach role.\n\nHe led the Azzurri to back-to-back league titles, then returned to Melbourne, to Essendon Lions, as Croatia had now become. Here he found success as a league-winning coach, before winding down his active involvement in football with South Melbourne Hellas.\n\nMelbourne clearly suited Mackay. In his first spell with Croatia, he turned down the chance to join Pele at New York Cosmos. His non-football working life turned full circle when he joined Transfeld Ship Builders as a Senior Procurement Buyer \u2013 the post he filled until his retirement.\n\nHe and Marilyn, who survives him, had two daughters, Shone and Elissa. He is also survived by son Duncan Junior, from his first marriage, who also lives in Australia. Paul, another son from that first marriage predeceased his father. In retirement, Mackay enjoyed listening to the Beatles, Barbra Streisand and Tony Bennett.\n\nDunky Mackay was a very good full-back. He was Celtic's Player of the Year in 1963, and Man of the Match when they played Real Madrid at Parkhead in a friendly. Sadly, he never had the medals to show for playing at a low point in the club's history, but on the other side of the world he finally won a few medals, forged a good reputation as a coach, and perhaps showed Scottish football what it lost when it allowed him to leave.\n\nMATT VALLANCE"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/duncan.mackay/2398366", "page_content": "Duncan MacKay\n\nassociation football player\n\nJuly 14, 1937 Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom\n\nBorn in Glasgow, Mackay turned professional when he joined Celtic from Maryhill Harp aged 17 in 1955.

MacKay opted to move to Australia at this juncture, joining Melbourne Croatia of the Victorian State League.

He was not overly physical in his defending either, preferring to win the ball through quick thinking and anticipation rather than just brute strength. So in some ways he was ahead of his time.\n\nThis refined approach to the game made him a popular player among the Celtic support and the Scotland selectors who capped him 14 times.\n\nHe became the captain in 1961, and then led the first team to the Scottish Cup matches v Dunfermline (the final & replay), but in both unfortunately Celtic once again came up short and lost. The side were perennially underachieving despite the wealth of talent on hand.\n\nWith Celtic so poor, he actually decided openly to request a move to England, but there was surprisingly little interest (Celtic\u2019s poor state a likely major cause of the lack of interest). You have to take in the poor team management at the time at Celtic, lack of morale in the squad and the constant board meddling. It wasn\u2019t an uncommon position. Jimmy Johnstone, Billy McNeill and Lennox were all also on the verge of leaving or giving up before Jock Stein\u2019s arrival at Celtic.\n\nDuncan McKay lost the captaincy to Billy McNeill in 1963, and his place in the first team later in the year. His last game was a single appearance in the 1964/65 season with a 4-2 defeat to Hearts.\n\nHe was not a heavy goalscorer, but curiously once he scored his first the others soon enough followed. He took a long time to score his first for Celtic, a penalty in a 7-0 victory over St Mirren in November 1962. However, over April & May 1963, he scored five goals (all penalties), including a double over Raith Rovers in a Scottish Cup semi-final. His last goal (also a penalty) was in October 1963 as Celtic defeated Aberdeen 3-0.\n\nIt was a great injustice to Duncan McKay\u2019s wonderful ability that he never won any major trophies as a Celt. This popular player eventually left Parkhead in 1964 for Third Lanark after 236 appearances and 7 goals.\n\nThe saddest aspect is that he was a great player in one of the poorer eras for Celtic. After the League Cup win in 1957, Celtic did not win another major trophy again until 1965. His first team career sadly spanned practically the whole of this period. Jock Stein became the club manager only a few months after Duncan Mackay\u2019s departure. If Jock Stein had arrived sooner then possibly Duncan Mackay could have won a medal worthy of his talents.\n\nHe is one of the finest regular long-term first team Celtic players to leave Celtic without a medal for a major trophy (Willie Miller is another in this group). He deserved better, and it is an indictment of the club at the time for just how poor the First Team were.\n\nHowever, the Celtic support more then recognised his talent. In 1967, following the triumph in Lisbon in the European Cup, a poll by the Evening Times amongst its readers surveyed for the best Celtic team in living memory. To his credit, Duncan MacKay walked in at right-back. A great accolade and a mark of the respect the support had for him.\n\nAfter Third Lanark, he moved to Australia to play for various sides and then later to coach clubs there also, with a brief period back home in Scotland between 1972-74 when he was player-coach with Juniors St Anthony\u2019s.\n\nHe passed away in December 2018, coincidentally just a few weeks after the passing of Ian Young who had succeeded him as the right-back at Celtic.\n\nPlaying Career\n\nAPPEARANCES LEAGUE SCOTTISH CUP LEAGUE CUP EUROPE TOTAL 1955-64 162 33 37 \u2013 236 Goals 5 2 0 \u2013 7\n\nHonours with Celtic\n\nnone\n\nPictures\n\nForums\n\nArticles\n\nDuncan MacKay Source: http://sesasport.com/?p=760 Duncan MacKay had a relatively short but stellar career with Celtic, racking up 236 games for the club from 1958 to 1964 and 14 Scottish caps in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He moved to Third Lanark in 1964 when Bill Hiddleston was engaged in the destruction of that club and in 1965 Frank Burin from the Croatia club in Melbourne persuaded him to try his luck in Australia. Mackay had an immediate impact on the club which had just been promoted to the Victorian State League, the top division. Croatia had been up and down between the State League and lower divisions over previous seasons but this time president Enver Begovic organised an open cheque-book approach that resulted in the expenditure of \u00a35000 in two months. Hammy McMeechan from Slavia was signed for a Victorian record fee of \u00a31200. Other newcomers were Joe Keenan, Ian Currie, Bobby McLachlan, Bill McIntyre and Brian Adlam. Croatia finished sixth in 1965. It was the \u2018Glamour Team\u2019 of the season, according to the Victorian Soccer Federation Yearbook.

Croatia finished 6th in 1966, 3rd in 1967 under Jimmy Adam, and won the State League for the first time in 1968 under coach Mijo Kiss, finishing seven points clear of Polonia.

He insisted the young Duncan wore his Mackay tartan kilt every day. But getting into schoolyard scrapes when responding to taunts of \u201cKiltie, kiltie cauld-bum\u201d began to wear thin with the youngster, and he persuaded his parents to get him into long trousers.\n\nAt St Columba\u2019s High his exceptional skill with a football got him noticed. He moved to St Mary\u2019s Boys\u2019 Guild, where Celtic signed him on a provisional form, farming him out to juniors, Maryhill Harp. By now the teenaged Mackay had seen the great Hungarian side of Ferenc Puskas and the sort of attacking football he wanted to play. He had left school and started an apprenticeship as a marine engineer.\n\nHe turned full-time at Celtic after completing his apprenticeship. During the 1958-59 campaign he made the first of his 236 first-team appearances in a League Cup tie against Clyde. By season\u2019s end he was first choice, and an Under-23 cap. On April 11, 1959, aged 21, he made the first of an eventual 14 appearances for Scotland, against England at Wembley.\n\nHis full-back partner that day was Rangers\u2019 Eric Caldow and the pair hit it off immediately. Indeed, they played together 12 times for Scotland, making Mackay Caldow\u2019s most frequent international partner. Caldow would relate how, as Scotland captain, he once distributed \u2018fan mail\u2019 when the national squad was training at Largs; finding one addressed to \u201cDonkey Mackay\u2019 he quipped, \u201cThis lassie must have seen you playing, Dunky\u201d. In reality, Caldow, rated his Celtic friend very highly as a player.\n\nBut, if things were going well with Scotland, all was not well at Celtic Park, where, following the 1957 League Cup win, the side struggled to compete with Rangers, Kilmarnock and Hearts, then the top teams. Bertie Peacock left the club and Mackay was appointed team captain in 1960, leading them to the Scottish Cup final of 1961, where they lost to Dunfermline after a replay. Indeed, along with 1940s goalkeeper Willie Miller, Mackay shares the \u201cdistinction\u201d of having won more Scotland caps than medals as a Celtic player.\n\nIn 1963 he lost the captaincy to Billy McNeill, then, after injury he lost his first-team place, partly because, it is rumoured, manager Jimmy McGrory and chairman Bob Kelly, who picked the side, did not like Mackay\u2019s attacking sorties up the wing.\n\nIn November, 1964, he left Celtic for Third Lanark. This is one of Scottish football\u2019s great \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d; maybe, had he hung on until Jock Stein returned in February, 1965, he would have regained his place. Stein certainly preferred attacking full-backs. But Thirds were starting to implode and at the end of that season, Mackay joined Melbourne Croatia, who were spending big in a bid to become the top side in the Victoria League.\n\nHe was an instant success, being appointed captain and winning the Player of the Year title in his first season. He led Croatia to several trophies, including a league-and-two-cups treble in 1972, but the club fell foul of Australian Soccer financial rules and collapsed. Mackay returned to Scotland for two seasons, working as a bookbinder and coaching junior outfit St Anthony\u2019s.\n\nHis first marriage, when a young man, had failed. But while, back home, he married his second wife, Marilyn, before, in 1974, Perth Azzurri, in Western Australia, offered him a player-coach role.\n\nHe led the Azzurri to back-to-back league titles, then returned to Melbourne, to Essendon Lions, as Croatia had now become. Here he found success as a league-winning coach, before winding down his active involvement in football with South Melbourne Hellas.\n\nMelbourne clearly suited Mackay. In his first spell with Croatia, he turned down the chance to join Pele at New York Cosmos. His non-football working life turned full circle when he joined Transfeld Ship Builders as a Senior Procurement Buyer \u2013 the post he filled until his retirement.\n\nHe and Marilyn, who survives him, had two daughters, Shone and Elissa. He is also survived by son Duncan Junior, from his first marriage, who also lives in Australia. Paul, another son from that first marriage predeceased his father. In retirement, Mackay enjoyed listening to the Beatles, Barbra Streisand and Tony Bennett.\n\nDunky Mackay was a very good full-back. He was Celtic\u2019s Player of the Year in 1963, and Man of the Match when they played Real Madrid at Parkhead in a friendly. Sadly, he never had the medals to show for playing at a low point in the club\u2019s history, but on the other side of the world he finally won a few medals, forged a good reputation as a coach, and perhaps showed Scottish football what it lost when it allowed him to leave.\n\nMATT VALLANCE"}, {"url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/duncan-mackay-dies-aged-82-21163559", "page_content": "Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nGet the latest Celtic news sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter\n\nFormer Celtic hero Duncan MacKay has died at the age of 82.\n\nThe Hoops will honour the former player by wearing black armbands in their trip to Paisley to face St Mirren this afternoon.\n\nThe Parkhead club released a statement announcing the news ahead of the Premiership encounter.\n\nIt read: \"Everyone at Celtic Football Club is saddened to hear of the death of former player, Duncan MacKay, who has passed away at the age of 82.\n\n\"Dunky, who played for the Hoops between 1955-64, making 236 appearances and scoring seven goals, is rightly considered a Celtic great.

He was not overly physical in his defending either, preferring to win the ball through quick thinking and anticipation rather than just brute strength. So in some ways he was ahead of his time.\n\nThis refined approach to the game made him a popular player among the Celtic support and the Scotland selectors who capped him 14 times.\n\nHe became the captain in 1961, and then led the first team to the Scottish Cup matches v Dunfermline (the final & replay), but in both unfortunately Celtic once again came up short and lost. The side were perennially underachieving despite the wealth of talent on hand.\n\nWith Celtic so poor, he actually decided openly to request a move to England, but there was surprisingly little interest (Celtic\u2019s poor state a likely major cause of the lack of interest). You have to take in the poor team management at the time at Celtic, lack of morale in the squad and the constant board meddling. It wasn\u2019t an uncommon position. Jimmy Johnstone, Billy McNeill and Lennox were all also on the verge of leaving or giving up before Jock Stein\u2019s arrival at Celtic.\n\nDuncan McKay lost the captaincy to Billy McNeill in 1963, and his place in the first team later in the year. His last game was a single appearance in the 1964/65 season with a 4-2 defeat to Hearts.\n\nHe was not a heavy goalscorer, but curiously once he scored his first the others soon enough followed. He took a long time to score his first for Celtic, a penalty in a 7-0 victory over St Mirren in November 1962. However, over April & May 1963, he scored five goals (all penalties), including a double over Raith Rovers in a Scottish Cup semi-final. His last goal (also a penalty) was in October 1963 as Celtic defeated Aberdeen 3-0.\n\nIt was a great injustice to Duncan McKay\u2019s wonderful ability that he never won any major trophies as a Celt. This popular player eventually left Parkhead in 1964 for Third Lanark after 236 appearances and 7 goals.\n\nThe saddest aspect is that he was a great player in one of the poorer eras for Celtic. After the League Cup win in 1957, Celtic did not win another major trophy again until 1965. His first team career sadly spanned practically the whole of this period. Jock Stein became the club manager only a few months after Duncan Mackay\u2019s departure. If Jock Stein had arrived sooner then possibly Duncan Mackay could have won a medal worthy of his talents.\n\nHe is one of the finest regular long-term first team Celtic players to leave Celtic without a medal for a major trophy (Willie Miller is another in this group). He deserved better, and it is an indictment of the club at the time for just how poor the First Team were.\n\nHowever, the Celtic support more then recognised his talent. In 1967, following the triumph in Lisbon in the European Cup, a poll by the Evening Times amongst its readers surveyed for the best Celtic team in living memory. To his credit, Duncan MacKay walked in at right-back. A great accolade and a mark of the respect the support had for him.\n\nAfter Third Lanark, he moved to Australia to play for various sides and then later to coach clubs there also, with a brief period back home in Scotland between 1972-74 when he was player-coach with Juniors St Anthony\u2019s.\n\nHe passed away in December 2018, coincidentally just a few weeks after the passing of Ian Young who had succeeded him as the right-back at Celtic.\n\nPlaying Career\n\nAPPEARANCES LEAGUE SCOTTISH CUP LEAGUE CUP EUROPE TOTAL 1955-64 162 33 37 \u2013 236 Goals 5 2 0 \u2013 7\n\nHonours with Celtic\n\nnone\n\nPictures\n\nForums\n\nArticles\n\nDuncan MacKay Source: http://sesasport.com/?p=760 Duncan MacKay had a relatively short but stellar career with Celtic, racking up 236 games for the club from 1958 to 1964 and 14 Scottish caps in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He moved to Third Lanark in 1964 when Bill Hiddleston was engaged in the destruction of that club and in 1965 Frank Burin from the Croatia club in Melbourne persuaded him to try his luck in Australia. Mackay had an immediate impact on the club which had just been promoted to the Victorian State League, the top division. Croatia had been up and down between the State League and lower divisions over previous seasons but this time president Enver Begovic organised an open cheque-book approach that resulted in the expenditure of \u00a35000 in two months. Hammy McMeechan from Slavia was signed for a Victorian record fee of \u00a31200. Other newcomers were Joe Keenan, Ian Currie, Bobby McLachlan, Bill McIntyre and Brian Adlam. Croatia finished sixth in 1965. It was the \u2018Glamour Team\u2019 of the season, according to the Victorian Soccer Federation Yearbook. The early season form had been poor, six of the first seven games were lost, and it looked as if Croatia would go back down again, but the attraction of Duncan MacKay and the other players resulted in a transformation in the second half of the season when it finished with eleven wins.

Sadly, he never had the medals to show for playing at a low point in the club\u2019s history, but on the other side of the world he finally won a few medals, forged a good reputation as a coach, and perhaps showed Scottish football what it lost when it allowed him to leave.\n\nMATT VALLANCE"}, {"url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/duncan-mackay-dies-aged-82-21163559", "page_content": "Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nGet the latest Celtic news sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter\n\nFormer Celtic hero Duncan MacKay has died at the age of 82.\n\nThe Hoops will honour the former player by wearing black armbands in their trip to Paisley to face St Mirren this afternoon.\n\nThe Parkhead club released a statement announcing the news ahead of the Premiership encounter.\n\nIt read: \"Everyone at Celtic Football Club is saddened to hear of the death of former player, Duncan MacKay, who has passed away at the age of 82.\n\n\"Dunky, who played for the Hoops between 1955-64, making 236 appearances and scoring seven goals, is rightly considered a Celtic great.

From the golden ages to the calamitous dark winds that have blown in and out of the club, Old Trafford has endured it all.\n\nThe lush green home of the champions is a well-known fortress in Europe. Many great players have entered through those reddish tunnels and have bowed out as absolute legends. While these giants have stamped their authorities in the shelves of history, their exploits have helped The 'Theatre of Dreams' gain a reputation as a fearsome venue for the adversaries.\n\nManchester United has been home to some of the greatest midfielders ever to play the game. Out of the countless legends to have donned the famous red shirt of Manchester, here are some of the midfielders who have remained as a bedrock to United's glittering history throughout the ages.\n\n#10: Duncan Edwards\n\nDuncan Edwards: An unfulfilled promise in the Busby Babes\n\nA player who could have been an unparalleled legend, but fell prey to his profane destiny, remains an unfulfilled promise. No tightest corner at the Theatre of Dreams will ever forget the sheer elegance of Big Dunc and his monumental playing style. The most shining jewel that Manchester United flaunted during the Busby Years, Edwards will always remain a sad, yet a beautiful enigma of the doomed Babes.\n\nTo tell the truth, Duncan Edwards was as if born to be the omnipotent force on a football pitch. Albeit he is remembered as a defensive midfielder, it was a crime to limit him to a single position. The world had never seen and shall never see a better versatile player than the boy from Black County.\n\nEdwards displayed his protean style of play when he once played as a striker in the first half and later slotted in for an injured defender in the second. Apparently, the great Sir Bobby Charlton was quoted saying that Duncan made the others feel like pygmies on the pitch. If it hadn't been for the disaster, Pele would have had a worthy competitor in Edwards.\n\nIn his short five-year spell, Duncan Edwards notched 21 goals in 177 appearances, winning 4 trophies for the club. In recent times, Sir Bobby stated that Phil Jones reminded him starkly of the English midfielder. Mysterious, isn't it? The fact that Jones was born on the same date Duncan Edwards passed away?\n\n#9: Ji Sung Park\n\nJi Sung Park was the first Asian to captain Manchester United\n\nThe midfielder must have been the first nuclear-powered South Korean in history, in the sense that he rushed about the pitch at the speed of an electron.\n\nJi Sung Park arrived as a relatively unknown player at Old Trafford in 2005 as a \u00a34million signing from PSV Eindhoven. The first Asian to captain Manchester United, Park was a pivotal versatile midfielder in Alex Ferguson's Champions League winning squad.\n\nThe South Korean displayed his knack of adapting on multiple occasions for the Red Devils. He was notably used as a winger in a 4-3-3 format in Manchester United's 2-0 Champions League final loss to Barcelona in Rome. His terrific work rate and pace in defence, as well as attack, earned him rave reviews for his performances.\n\nPark was also equally effective in the centre of the park, thanks to his work-rate and defensive abilities. Italian pass master Andrea Pirlo, who quoted his admiration above, accepted his failure in getting past the dynamic South-Korean, who marked him in United's famous 4-0 win over AC Milan at Old Trafford in 2009. Park was equally tough to handle for Pirlo when he faced PSV Eindhoven.\n\nJI Sung Park made 205 appearances, scoring 27 goals for Manchester United. He won 13 trophies in his glorious seven-year spell from 2005 to 2012, including a UEFA Champions League title in the 2007/08 season.\n\n#8: Paul Ince\n\nPaul Ince was a pivotal midfielder in Manchester United's formative years\n\nA dynamic tough-tackling midfielder, Paul Ince was one of those players who proved to be the pillar in United's road to glory after dark times at Old Trafford. Albeit he left Old Trafford before United hit their peak, Ince is always summoned up as a legend, being the first black skipper to ply his trade for the Red Devils.\n\nAlex Ferguson was quick to snap up the midfielder in a \u00a31.35 million deal after spotting him at West Ham United in 1989. A hard tackler and a top-class ball winner, Ince was a vital player in the absence of United skipper Bryan Robson. He formed a stellar partnership with midfielder Neil Webb in the center of the park at Old Trafford.\n\nBut, the Englishman left for Inter Milan following an infamous feud with Sir Alex Ferguson. Though his departure allowed the youngsters to make their mark, Ince will always be remembered as a saviour in United's formative years.\n\nPaul Ince netted 29 goals in 281 appearances in his six-year spell at the Theatre of Dreams. He amassed a total of 10 total trophies, before departing for Inter Milan in 1995.\n\n#7: Nicky Butt\n\nNicky Butt celebrates his famous winner against fierce rivals Leeds United\n\nIf there was any trouble, you could look to your right or left and Nicky would be there to sort it out!\n\nVery few of all the people who saw the midfielder with gold hair would disagree to the fact that he was a perfect successor to Irishman Roy Keane. Paul Scholes has been perfect in describing the crucial attribute that made Nicky Butt one of the most revered players in the history of United.\n\nA graduate of the famous Manchester United youth academy, Nicky Butt was one of the ablest defenders the Manchester-based club has seen in its history.\n\nButt proved to be an apt replacement for the team after Paul Ince's departure in 1994. The sturdy and tenacious midfielder had attributes similar to the legendary Roy Keane, being hard as a nail in both his game and attitude on the pitch. Like the others, you could always count on Nicky Butt to be a huge influence in big games.\n\nThe Manchester-born lad was always known to deliver his best in times of need. Butt is always remembered for his superb winner versus Leeds United in 1998, slotting the ball with a turn past keeper Paul Robinson.\n\nUnited were put in grave peril as Roy Keane and Paul Scholes were out of action in the Champions League final against Bayer Munich in 1999. However, Butt stepped up magnificently to the occasion and put in an energetic ninety minutes as United cruised to a thrilling 2-1 victory over the Bavarians.\n\nButt netted 26 times in an illustrious 12-year career from 1992 to 2004, winning 15 laurels with the club. He departed to Newcastle after seeing a shortage of playing time at Old Trafford.\n\n#6: Michael Carrick\n\nMichael Carrick is known as one of the most underrated midfielders in England\n\nNot only this season but every year. People do not realise the amount of work Carrick delivers until he has gone.\n\nThierry Henry was right up to the mark in underlining the 36-year-old's selfless contribution to the game of football. Michael Carrick joined the Red Devils in 2006 for a reported fee of \u00a314 million.\n\nIt is a really sad thing to see a player of his quality being underrated in his own country. In contrast to the fiery midfield general Roy Keane, the six-feet-four-inch midfielder has been a calm presence in the United midfield for over a decade now. It has been bad luck on his part to see him receive the deserved recognition only in the twilight of his career with the Red Devils.\n\nCarrick quickly slotted in as a worthy midfield partner to the legendary Paul Scholes, excelling in his holding role. After the Ginger Prince's retirement in 2013, he has served the responsibility of an able and trusted midfielder who can dictate attacking plays from the midfield.\n\nWhile the Englishman is set to retire soon, England will be saying goodbye to their last midfield giant since the likes of Scholes, Lampard and Gerrard. Michael Carrick has appeared 460 times, netting 24 goals for the Red Devils since 2006. He has won 18 trophies since his move to Old Trafford and currently captains a resurgent Manchester United under Jose Mourinho.\n\n#5: David Beckham\n\nDavid Beckham's free-kicks were nothing short of nightmares for goal-keepers\n\nThe best crosser of the ball I have ever seen. You would make a run and he would put the ball into your path without having to break stride. A brilliant footballer.\n\nWhile Ryan Giggs may appreciate the golden boy of Manchester United, David Beckham deserves a worthy credit for never letting anyone down whenever his ability was called into question.\n\n'Becks' is one of the first names you will encounter on a nostalgic walk down United's glorious memory lane. Establishing himself as a legend after coming through the youth ranks, Beckham has lived a fairytale football career.\n\nAs a legendary number 7 of Manchester United, we remember Beckham for the two most distinctive quirks of his game; crosses and set-pieces. At Old Trafford, it became a common sight to see the fans celebrating louder once David Beckham stepped up to take a free-kick in his trademark style. Most of his goals have come from the dead balls he sent swerving in the top corners of the net.\n\nThe former English skipper is also regarded as the king of crosses. His pin-point crossing enabled him to find teammates in the box with marvellous precision. An unbelievable cross was a hallmark of Beckham's set-piece aptness. Beckham marshalled the right midfield in Ferguson's wingless wonders, starkly different to the winger Andrei Kanchelskis whom he replaced in the line-up.\n\nApart from being a great player, Beckham also enjoyed his status as the most popular footballer of his generation, becoming a household name all over the world. Although his popularity did prove to be the reason for his rift with Ferguson, Beckham did leave an unforgotten legacy behind him at Old Trafford.\n\nThe Englishman won 13 trophies in a ten-year span from 1993 to 2003, scoring 85 times in 394 appearances for the English giants.\n\n#4: Roy Keane\n\nAbsolutely no one could intimidate Roy Keane on and off the pitch.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t a player at United who could match Roy\u2019s influence in my time at the club.\n\nAnd that is another United great Gary Neville paying homage to the most successful captain in the history of Manchester United, Roy Keane.\n\nGetting on the wrong side of a furious Roy Keane would probably be the last mistake of your life. For an experience, better consult Alf-Inge Haaland who will never forget that nightmare.\n\nRoy Keane is simply courage and bravery personified. Absolutely nothing could intimidate the Irishman on and off the pitch. A born legend, inspirational leader and an undisputed bedrock of the team, one cannot ask for more in a club captain. None of his teammates had the guts to question his authority at Old Trafford.\n\nKnown for his short-tempered behaviour, Keane was nonetheless a driving force in United's stellar midfield. The masterstroke he produced against Juventus in the Champions League semi-finals has gone down as one of the greatest stories to boast about in the United folklore. A dictatorial defensive midfielder, Keane had the ability to grab the game by the scruff of the neck and win it on his own terms.\n\nAs good as he was with the ball, Roy Keane also managed to entertain the United supporters with his immense passion. It was a treat for the United fans to watch the Irishman raging at Arsenal's Patrick Viera, eventually getting better of the Frenchman.\n\nRoy Keane turned out 480 times, scoring 51 goals and winning 17 trophies in a 13-year-old career with the Red Devils. Absolute legend!\n\n#3: Bryan Robson\n\nCaptain Marvel won so much less than he actually deserved\n\nHe\u2019d be all over the pitch, terrorising the opposition\u2019s defence, menacing the midfield and smacking in goals. Bryan could do anything, he was Captain Courageous, and bloomin\u2019 hell, he would often win games on his own.\n\nFormer United great Lou Macari has quite a bag of sweet words in his basket for Bryan Robson.\n\nIt is an absolute pity to see that Captain Marvel won so much less than he actually deserved. A loyal servant in United's darkest times, Bryan Robson would become the legendary number seven with his brilliant leadership skills and match-winning abilities.\n\nArriving at Old Trafford after seven years with West Bromwich Albion, the midfielder was one of the very few players who was pivotal to United's rise as one of the greatest clubs in the world. Robson was a torch-bearer for the young Fergie's Fledglings, who would go on to conquer the world with their impressive displays. The great midfield enforcer was known to be equally adept in attack as well as in defence, being a commanding presence in the midfield.\n\nIn his vital thirteen-year tenure, Robson appeared 469 times, falling just one short of a century of goals. The English defensive midfielder procured 8 trophies leaving on the brink of United's golden era. A player who deserved so much more!\n\n#2: Ryan Giggs\n\nRyan Giggs: Mr. Manchester United\n\nWhen I arrived (at Manchester United), he was playing. Now, 15 years after I retired, he\u2019s still playing. It\u2019s crazy.\n\nA healthy and worthy tribute to the Welsh giant by the 'King' Eric Cantona.\n\nRyan Giggs is Mr. Manchester United. The greatest servant of Old Trafford and the crowned jewel of Fergie's Fledglings in the illustrious past of the Red Devils, the Welsh wizard kick-started his United career after being persuaded by Sir Alex to ditch rivals Manchester City and join United's youth academy.\n\nOnly 17 at that time, Giggs was a winger filled with deafening pace, providing Eric Cantona with a plethora of assists for his famous goals.\n\nBut, Giggsy's attribute of gradually adopting a different playing style over the years is the quality that should be appreciated the most. Often as the time passes, wingers tend to lose their explosive speed and become somewhat unproductive with increasing age. Yet, the Welshman has shown his pedigree, after being switched to a deep midfield role in 2009.\n\nGiggs was equally effective as Scholes, playing in the center of the park and providing assists for attackers to score goals. No British player has won more trophies than the famous number 11. Giggsy's career numbers are elephantine, thanks to his profound longevity as a footballer.\n\nIn an illustrious career spanning over 24 years, Giggs made a whopping 963 appearances and scored 168 goals for the Red Devils. He also amassed a load of silverware in his long tenure, winning 34 trophies with the club. He is rightly down as the best player ever to don the famous red shirt.\n\n#1: Paul Scholes\n\nPaul Scholes has gone down as one of the greatest ever to grace the beautiful game\n\nI\u2019m star-struck when I see Paul Scholes because you never see him. On the pitch you can\u2019t catch him. Off the pitch he disappears.\n\nOf all the innumerable quotes about him, Luis Figo aptly underlines Scholesy's down-to-earth and dedicated attitude to the game of football. It really seems weird that the Ginger Prince could have equally excelled as a cricketer. But thanks to the almighty, we have a beloved legend to adore at Old Trafford.\n\nThere are greats. Then there are legends. And then there is Paul Scholes. A class of his own. No wonder Zidane regretted of not being able to play with the diminutive midfielder in his career. The fact to be appreciated is that he could influence the game even after coming out of retirement at the ripe old age of 37.\n\nPlaying at the highest level for decades, the Englishman is the most beautiful ode to perfection. For years, Paul Scholes was an unparalleled creative lynchpin in the United midfield. His inch-perfect precision in long passes and ability to control the tempo of the game will remain unmatched in the years to come. Many have tried to emulate, but the grace and elegance of his deft touch has been conferred to none of them.\n\nOne regret though, is that of Scholes being manhandled in the English national team. Had they played him in his preferred central position instead of shifting him to wide left, England might as well have won a World Cup. Yet as past remains unchanged, so also is the fact that the world will never see another midfielder with the quality of Paul Scholes.\n\nIn a glorious career spanning nineteen years, the one-club legend appeared 718 times, scoring 158 goals for Manchester United. The shy genius has won 25 trophies with the club and is regarded as one of the greatest ever to grace the beautiful game.\n\nPoll : 0 votes"}, {"url": "https://www.musicradar.com/news/duncan-mackay-mike-reid-synths-80s-tv-show", "page_content": "Back in the \u201870s and \u201880s, British TV made plenty of attempts to introduce synthesizers to a mainstream audience, but perhaps none stranger than the one that featured former 10cc keyboard player Duncan Mackay explaining his impressive rig to comedian Mike Reid and a robot called Metal Mickey in an episode of children\u2019s game show Runaround.\n\nIn the clip, which was recently unearthed by Are Sounds Electrik? and was previously posted by Littlepixel (see above), the surreal scenes kick off around the six-minute mark, when a be-tracksuited Reid approaches Mackay and asks him to explain \"In layman's terms - because it gets a bit confusing - what's this all about?\"\n\nMackay is happy to indulge the ebullient East End entertainer, first by starting up his Roland CR-78 rhythm box and then turning to his impressive collection of synths. These include a Yamaha CS-80, a Roland RS-505 string machine and a pedal-powered Moog Taurus. You\u2019ll spot a Roland Space Echo there, too.\n\nAnd then the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance. After battling to hold a conversation with Mackay while the synths do their thing, Reid reaches down out of shot and picks up a keytar. \u201cWhat sir, is that?\u201d he enquires, with Mackay explaining that it\u2019s a keyboard that can be played like a guitar.\n\nMetal Mickey\u2019s bemused expression probably reflects how most of the audience was feeling while all of this was going on - the whole thing is made weirder by the fact that, for reasons that remain unclear, the names Rick Wakeman, Oscar Peterson and Ernest Hemingway are written on the set wall. Once he\u2019s had enough, Reid ends up asking Mackay to turn everything off so that he can quiz him on his departure from 10cc and his future plans.\n\nHaving joined in 1978, Mackay left 10cc in 1981, which suggests that this is when the clip dates from. His illustrious career also saw him playing keyboards on Kate Bush\u2019s first three albums, and it\u2019s said that he was once considered for the position of keyboard player in Yes.\n\nReid, meanwhile, went on to enjoy considerable success playing the roguish Frank Butcher in BBC soap opera EastEnders. He died in 2007.\n\nAs for Metal Mickey, he had his own show at the time, which ran until 1983. His current whereabouts are unknown, but given the current obsession with all things AI, now could be the perfect time for a comeback."}, {"url": "https://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/sport/10074675/All-Whites-mourn-Mr-Dependable-Duncan-Cole", "page_content": "'DEPENDABLE DUNC': Duncan Cole was a first choice central midfielder for much of his football career.\n\nIt was arguably the greatest goal in New Zealand football history and master coach John Adshead hopes people will remember the late Duncan Cole for his pivotal part in it.\n\nCole, 55, died suddenly at his Auckland home on Wednesday night - the first of the 1982 All Whites World Cup squad to pass away.\n\nHis death has been keenly felt by the close-knit 1982 team.\n\nSkipper Steve Sumner said it was like \"losing a brother\" and there would be a gap at the table at future team reunions.\n\nThey want their mate, who played 92 times for New Zealand, to be acknowledged as one of the All Whites' genuine greats.\n\nAn emotional Adshead said yesterday that Cole should never be forgotten for delivering the pass for Grant Turner's long-range headed goal in a 2-0 World Cup qualifying series win over the Socceroos in Sydney in 1981.\n\n\"There were so many players who produced important moments [on the road to Spain], but that is one of the special moments that people still remember.\"\n\nAdshead said the quality of Grant's goal meant \"sometimes we forget the magical buildup before it\". \"For every action, there's a reaction. If you produce the perfect cross, you get the perfect header, and Duncan Cole produced the perfect cross that day.\"\n\nCole was \"the equal of anyone\" in the 1982 squad as a player and a person, Adshead said.\n\n\"He was probably the most reliable person - and there were others - off the field, as well as on it. If I decided to play Allan Boath instead of him one week, he would take it on the chin. He was disappointed, but he just got back on the job and worked hard to get back out there.\n\n\"He was a fantastic person and player to work with, as a coach. He was so important to that side. Look at that midfield pairing of Sumner and Cole. You had two men that wouldn't give anybody an inch.\n\n\"Attitude, dedication and commitment - Duncan Cole had it all.\"\n\nSumner said \"Dependable Dunc\" would be remembered for \"having a long throw, white beads and a powerful shot, but as a footballer he was seriously more than that\".\n\n\"He had a big engine, as they would say today, and was a very powerful man who did a lot of the stuff that didn't get noticed. He covered people and took on the thankless tasks of turning people and making them play the way they didn't want to play.\n\n\"Duncan was dependable, he never let you down and he never had a bad game. He wasn't crafty but he did the hard, grinding, tough stuff that Kiwis love.\"\n\nCole was ever-present during the All Whites' 15-game odyssey on the road to Spain in 1982, forging a fine midfield quartet with Sumner, Turner and Keith [Buzzer] Mackay. He played in all three World Cup finals matches against Scotland, the Soviet Union and Brazil.\n\nAdshead said Cole \"never created any form of drama at training or away from the game\".\n\nHe was a quiet character, who was, nevertheless, proud of being an \u201882 All White, enjoyed a beer with his mates, and was always one of the first to meet up with his old coach when Adshead visited Auckland from his Tauranga home.\n\nCole, who lived in Birkenhead, played for North Shore United in the New Zealand national league and was part of Don Jones' team that won the 1977 title. He earned Chatham Cup winners' medals with North Shore in 1979 and 1986 and also had two stints with Canberra City in the Australian National Soccer League.\n\nHe made his All Whites debut against England B in 1978 and played his first international soon after against Iran. He quickly established himself as a regular, playing in the historic 4-0 win over Mexico in Auckland in 1980 to cement his place for the World Cup campaign.\n\nCole missed the warmup series against a League of Ireland XI and English club Watford before the 1982 World Cup finals because of a torn Achilles tendon, but he was always determined to make the plane for Spain. \"I was going to physio twice a day and had to pass a fitness test,\" he said in 2010.\n\nEnglish-born but Auckland-raised, Cole played 58 full internationals for New Zealand and scored four goals. But Sumner made the point that many of the other games in that era against teams like England B and professional clubs like Newcastle United \"when they had [England internationals] Peter Beardsley, Chris Waddle and Paul Gascoigne\" were stronger than matches against Oceania or Asian nations.\n\nSumner said Cole, whose last cap came against Israel in 1988, was a \"first-choice\" selection throughout his career in New Zealand football's golden age. \"You don't play 90-odd games for the All Whites, particularly back in those days, without being a very good player.\n\n\"A lot of the players we are seeing today couldn't lace Duncan's boots.\""}, {"url": "https://www.thefamouspeople.com/scottish-football-players.php", "page_content": "Famous Scottish Football Players\n\nRight IconThis ranking is based on an algorithm that combines various factors, including the votes of our users and search trends on the internet.\n\nIf you thought football is all about a ball being juggled by twenty players with two goalies trying to restrict its entrance at the ends of an approximately 130-yard pitch, you have been living under the rock for sure!
