Eligibility problems are common and will affect final rankings as well.\n\nIowa, Indiana and Michigan State head up the top of the Big Ten, while Connecticut, Seton Hall and St. John's collected impressive classes in the Big East. North Carolina headed the ACC and Cincinnati topped Conference-USA, while Memphis, under new head coach John Calipari, finished strong. Alabama leads the SEC.\n\nIf you're looking for pure size, 7-foot-6 center Neil Fingleton, a native of England who attended Worchester-Holy Name Central Catholic, Mass., signed with North Carolina. Curtis Johnson, a 7-4 center from Norfolk-Ryan Academy, Va., is set for St. John's. However, neither will play early roles.\n\n1.

This is one of the top Hawkeye classes ever, as coach Steve Alford signed a highly rated center in Reiner (who passed on UConn and Kansas), a top forward in Worley and an unbelievable shooter in Boyd. Evans is considered a top junior college prospect at power forward and Hogan played at Kentucky before transferring. The huge prize is Recker, who transferred to Arizona from Indiana and then moved to Iowa in order to be nearer his family and girlfriend, who was seriously injured in a car accident. After an appeal, the NCAA allowed eligibility this fall. Recker averaged 16 points as a sophomore for the Hoosiers and was third-team all-Big Ten.

Jarvis had corralled a super class, perhaps best in the nation, but the key was F Darius Miles, 6-9, East St. Louis, Ill. A do-everything player generally rated among the top three prospects in the country, Miles turned to the NBA rather than attend St. John's. Without him, this group tumbles a few notches from their No. 1 ranking after the early signing period. Cook is dynamic and Diakite could the Red Storm's best center in years. Both have great basketball bodies and athleticism. Johnson was a late addition and is considered a project. F Eric King, 6-7, Brooklyn-Lincoln, NY., had entrance problems.\n\n7.

Thomas is tough and Boddicker was rated the best propect in the state. Both should get playing time with the departure of center Chris Mihm to the NBA. Purdue wanted Mouton badly, as he is a major offensive threat. Other keys are Ivey, Williams and Klotz. F/G Maurice Evans, 6-5, is a redshirt transfer from Wichita State.\n\n9.

Moye is a physical player and suited for the Big Ten wars, and Owens and Roberts are very tough. Jeffries, a huge believer in Knight, threatened to transfer if the veteran coach had been fired.\n\n10. Michigan State\n\nG Marcus Taylor, 6-3, Lansing-Waverly, Mich.\n\nF Zach Randolph, 6-8, Marion, Ind.\n\nSpartan followers can't complain about a class with the top guard and center/forward in the nation. Higher-rated schools just had more prospects. Taylor is outstanding and should see time early. Randolph, still not qualified, is a widebody who dominated prep all-star play and could be the Spartans' best post player in recent years.\n\n11. Missouri\n\nG Rickey Paulding, 6-5, Detroit-Renaissance, Mich.\n\nF Arthur Johnson, 6-9, Detroit-Pershing, Mich.\n\nG Wesley Stokes, 5-10, Long Beach-Poly, Calif.\n\nF Travon Bryant, 6-8, Long Beach-Jordan, Calif.\n\nCoach Quin Snyder's first class landed four talented players. Johnson, Bryant and Paulding are exceptional and Stokes was one of California's best. However, Bryant has not qualified. Forward Omar Weaver, 6-7, of Compton-Centennial, Cal., decommitted and will attend Hutchinson (Kan.) C.C.\n\n12. North Carolina\n\nF Jason Parker, 6-8, Fork Union Military Academy, Va.\n\nG Brian Morrison, 6-2, Kirkland-Lake Washington, Wash.\n\nG Adam Boone, 6-2, Minnetonka, Minn.\n\nC Neil Fingleton, 7-6, England/Worcester-Holy Name, Mass.\n\nThe Tar Heels signed the nation's tallest player in Fingleton (over Wake Forest); however, the native of England was extremely disappointing in all-star competition and is a project. Coach Bill Guthridge also re-signed the outstanding Parker, who committed but did not qualify last year, and reports vary on his current entrance eligibility. Boone and Morrison are two of the nation's better guard prospects.\n\n13. Iowa State\n\nG Jake Sullivan, 6-2, Oakdale-Tartan, Minn.\n\nC Andrew Skoglund, 7-1, Minnetonka-Hopkins, Minn.\n\nG/F Shane Power, 6-5, Merrillville-Andrean, Ind.\n\nF Tyray Pearson, 6-7, Kankakee CC, Ill.\n\nF Omar Bynum, 6-7, Indiana Hills CC, Iowa\n\nG Zach Fortune, 6-2, Bellevue-West, Neb.\n\nG Marcus Jefferson, 6-5, East Chicago-Central/Notre Dame Prep, Mass/Providence\n\nCoach Larry Eustachy signed the nation's premier junior college big man in C Ernest Brown, 6-11, Indian Hills (Iowa) C.C.., but the prospect opted for the NBA. The Cyclones landed two of Minnesota's best prospects in Skoglund and Sullivan, a Top 100 guard. Sullivan, Power and Pearson should all contribute right away, with Skoglund being more of a project. Jefferson will redshirt.\n\n14. Alabama\n\nF Gerald Wallace, 6-7, Childersburg, Ala.\n\nC Dan Banko, 6-11, Nashville-Montgomery Bell Academy, Tenn.\n\nG Demetrius Smith, 6-3, Hogansville-Calloway, Ga.\n\nF Reggie Rambo, 6-8, Alexandria-Peabody Magnet, La.\n\nHad coach Mark Gottfried not lost previously committed center Mario Austin to Mississippi State, the Tide would have challenged for No. 1. Wallace is a top-notch forward and Smith, an outstanding guard, was a late addition, signed over Georgia and Kentucky.\n\n15. Memphis\n\nF John Grice, 6-6, Shelby State CC, Tenn.\n\nF Arthur Barclay, 6-8, Camden, N.J.\n\nC Modibo Diarra, 6-9, Africa/Fitchburg-Notre Dame Prep, Mass.\n\nG Scooter McFadgon, 6-3, Memphis-Raleigh-Egypt, Tenn.\n\nF Lou Wright, 6-6, Memphis-Raleigh-Egypt, Tenn.\n\nNew coach John Calipari closed fast with an outstanding class and was in the race for star forward Darius Rice of Jackson-Lanier, Miss., who eventually picked Miami (Fla.) over the Tigers and Kentucky. Grice was signed over Kentucky. Diarra could be a force, plus both McFadgon and Wright are potential stars. But the best coup might be landing top-five junior guard Dajuan Wagner of Camden, N.J., as the cornerstone for next year's recruiting class. Wagner was a high school teammate and best friend of Barclay, an outstanding prospect in his own right.\n\nBill Hodge is the executive editor and director of recruiting coverage at FANSonly.com.

He began his career at Kingswood school in West Hartford and then played at Marist (NCAA) from 2003-2007 being named MAAC player of the year in 2007 and led the NCAA in assists twice. He began his professional career in 2007 in Lithuania with top team Lietuvos Rytas Vilnius (Lithuania-LKL) and played a season in the then D-League with the Rio Grande Valley Vipers. He returned to Europe in 2009 and would play the rest of his career overseas until 2020. He was most of his time in Germany where he played 8 seasons for teams like the Telekom Baskets Bonn, Brose Bamberg and the Tigers Tuebingen. He also played in Greece with VAP Kolossos Rodou, in Spain with Gipuzkoa BC San Sebastian and closed out his career in Romania with BC CSU Sibiu. It didn\u2019t matter where he played but as some say that guy is a walking bucket, Jordan was a walking dime as he led the easyCredit BBL in assists 6 times and also led the top European league ACB in Spain in assists and in Greece and Romania. He was a three time BBL allstar and is the all-time easyCredit assist leader breaking ex Lebron James teammate Dru Joyce\u2019s mark in 2017 with his 1458th assist. He shared his memories playing against Rickey Paulding.\n\nThanks Jordan for talking to germanhoops.com. Where are you and how is life treating you at the moment?\n\n\n\nHey miles, I am in West Hartford CT where we have lived since I retried a couple years ago. Everything is good here and nice to be settled back home.\n\nYou retired from the game in 2020. You have made the next step in your life and are in real estate. How is that new challenge?\n\n\n\nReal estate has been really good so far. It has been a crazy market the last couple years but it keeps me busy and has a competitive side to it as well which I love.\n\nYou have been away from the game for 2 years. What do you miss the most?\n\nIt\u2019s not easy playing for 13 years professionally and then just stopping. I do miss the game of basketball. I especially miss the daily routine and competitiveness. It was a great 13 years but I knew my time was over once covid hit.\n\nRickey Paulding had his farewell game on June 4. What is the first thing that you think about when you hear Rickey Paulding?\n\n\n\nWhen I hear Ricky\u2019s name the first think I think of is ultimate professional. He just always seemed to go about his business in such a professional manner that all you can do is respect him.\n\nHave you ever seen a player that was able to play so well at such a high age?\n\n\n\nWhat Ricky did was so impressive because he was so consistent for so many years. It\u2019s not easy doing that but he made it look easy!\n\nWhat do you think was your record against him? Were you above or below 500?\n\n\n\nIf I had to guess I was below 500 vs him unfortunately but we had some good battles over the years!\n\nYou were 7-12. You were 7-5 with the Telekom baskets Bonn, but your time with Tuebingen hurt your overall record as you were 0-6. How do you remember Rickey Paulding the competitor?\n\nHahah the 0-6 def hurts. I remember our battles and playoff games vs each other when I was in Bonn. Ricky was the ultimate competitor and always showed up when it mattered. He would always hit tough shots when it really counted.\n\nYou had very memorable games against him early in your career. In the 11-12 season you were 2-0 and had 18 and 15 assists games. What do you remember from these games?\n\n\n\nI remember the 18 assist game playing in the old arena in Oldenburg. It was like a scorer getting hot and I found a rhythm and it just clicked. I was lucky guys made shots which is always key!\n\nIn the 12-13 season you lost a tough 5 game series to Oldenburg. What memories do you have from this series?\n\n\n\nThat was a great series. You know what sticks out was Kyle Weems having like 30 points in the first half in one of the games. I knew at that time that Kyle was going to have a great career!\n\nWhat kind of legacy do you feel will he leave in the EasyCredit BBL. Do you feel there will ever be another American that will reach his longevity?\n\n\n\nWhat Ricky has done and the respect he\u2019s earned from everyone in Germany will be hard to match. He was one of the best players, competitors and professionals the BBL will ever see.\n\nPlease leave some closing words for Rickey.\n\nRickey, congrats on an amazing career! You were always one of my favorite players and the way you went about it was something I always admired.

Bibb even made an appearance in the 2006 videogame \u201cAND 1 Streetball.\u201d At Denby, Bibb was a Detroit Free Press All-PSL First Team selection in 1991 and he finished 10th in the Mr. Basketball voting.\n\nHere is a small excerpt from a first-hand account shared on Facebook from a man named Tom Burgan talking about Bibb in his AAU days:\n\n\"\u2026 With one hand, he soared sideways and slammed the ball with so much force that the retractable backboard began to go up and down uncontrollably. The referees had to stop the game in order to make sure the rim & backboard would be useable for the rest of the tournament - the crowd & myself watching was in utter disbelief\u2026\"\n\nLorenzo Orr, Detroit Pershing\n\nLorenzo Orr is a dunking legend in city of Detroit. From the Class of 1990, Orr went on to play at USC and enjoy a 12-year professional career in Europe, he was one of many high flyers to come out of the dominant Detroit Pershing program. It seems like most people from the city would agree that he was one of the all-time greats.\n\n\"Incredible dunker,\" former Detroit Pershing coach Wydell Henry said. \"I remember him catching lobs from half court and just dunking it.\"\n\nOrr was a fan favorite, with his name coming up often in social media discussion of the topic. To sum up his legend, one person on Facebook simply wrote, \"Lorenzo Orr, hands down.\"\n\nMichigan Head Coach Steve Fisher gives instructions to Maurice Taylor during the waning moments of a game against Michigan State in East Lansing in 1995. The Wolverines kept the game close but eventually fell short losing 67-64.\n\nMaurice Taylor, Detroit Henry Ford\n\nTalyor is a name that comes up as frequently as Lorenzo Orr's in debates about the best dunkers in Detroit-area history. Known for his ability to reach back and posterize opponents, Taylor went on to do the same at the University of Michigan and in the NBA with Los Angeles Clippers, Houston Rockets, New York Knicks and Sacramento Kings.\n\n\"I think Maurice, when I was in college, jumped over a guy,\" Henry said.\n\nAlthough his name is tightly tied to the booster scandal that scarred the Michigan basketball program, many in the city still remember him as a true high-flyer from Henry Ford. He went on to play 534 games in the NBA, averaging 11.0 points, 4.6 rebounds and 1.2 assists per game. He last played in the NBA in the 2006-07 season but went on to play Italian Euroleague ball until 2010.\n\nJustin Tillman, Detroit Pershing\n\nOf all of the players in the last decade, not many could throw down like Pershing big man Justin Tillman. A guy like Tillman would not have survived in an era when dunking was illegal because that it how he made his presence felt.\n\nAt Pershing, the 6-8 powerhouse he made quite a duo with guard Kay Felder as Tillman brought the power and Felder brought the finesse. With his muscular frame and ferocious fro, Tillman brought a Ben Wallace-esque vibe to the hardwood and averaged 23 points, 16 rebounds, 3 assists and 4.5 blocks as a senior. He finished second in Mr. Basketball voting in 2014 and continued his dunking ways at Virginia Commonwealth University. Going undrafted in 2018, he joined the Miami Heat in the 2018 Summer League before joining the Korean League. He is currently playing for Hapoel Gilboa Galil of the Israeli Premier League.\n\n\u201cI called him \u2018The Tillmanator,\u2019\" Henry said. \"He loved dunking, though. He loved dunking. That\u2019s one thing I\u2019ll say about Justin: He wanted to dunk every time. He didn\u2019t like layups he wanted to dunk the ball.\u201d\n\nChris Webber, Detroit Country Day\n\nChris Webber is one of the most famous names to come out of the state of Michigan and the University of Michigan. He began building his legend at Detroit Country Day and was head and shoulders above his competition, including when it came to dunks.\n\nLegendary Country Day coach Kurt Keener recalled a few standout dunks, including one where Webber caught a bad pass off the backboard and slammed it home. He even covered his eyes with one arm and dunked with another in a game.\n\n\u201cIn a game at Charlotte, Chris came down on a fast break with one defender back,\u201d Keener recalled. \u201cChris looked like he was going to jump over the player who was 6-foot-6. Chris hit the guy with his knee in the opponent\u2019s forehead, then dunked. I turned to my assistant and said, \u2018I think he knocked the guy out!\u2019 I bring (this) up, because in all my years coaching and watching the game I have never seen (that) duplicated.\u201d\n\nMore great dunkers\n\nDerrick Alexander, Detroit Benedictine\n\nDewon Blakeney, Detroit Cody\n\nStan Bufford, Ferndale\n\nDerrick Coleman, Detroit Northern\n\nJoe Crawford, Detroit Renaissance\n\nLorenzo Geeter, Detroit Martin Luther King\n\nBarry Hardy, Inkster\n\nSpencer Haywood, Detroit Pershing\n\nJosh Jackson, Detroit Consortium\n\nElvin Jones, Ferndale\n\nRickey Paulding, Detroit Renaissance\n\nSteve Pearson, Detroit Northwestern\n\nBryan Pollard, Detroit Chadsey\n\nTharren Richard, Hamtramck\n\nMaurice Searight, Orchard Lake St. Mary's\n\nJoe Shepherd, Southfield\n\nCorey Tarrant, Detroit Northwestern\n\nTony Tolbert, Detroit St. Martin de Porres\n\nRobert \u201cTractor\u201d Traylor, Detroit Murray-Wright"}, {"url": "https://michiganpreps.rivals.com/news/top-10-detroit-pershing-basketball-players-of-the-last-ten-years", "page_content": "If there were any question as to who the top boys basketball program of all-time in the state of Michigan is, look no further than on the east side of Detroit: 18875 Ryan Road, to be exact. Home of John J. Pershing High School, or simply, the Doughboys. Pershing's storied boys basketball programs spans back decades, to the 1960s, with legendary players in each decade. One could go on for days naming some of the best that have graced the blue and gold of Pershing, so I'll just go back 10 years to 2006, ranking the top ten players from that era.\n\n1.Class of 2010 PG Keith Appling: His 49 points in Class A state title win as a junior in 2009, is more than enough to put Appling atop this list. But combined with that, at 6-2, Appling was a terror on offense. One-on-one, he was unstoppable, and knew how to score the ball, whether shooting it, or taking it to the rack. Not many players can say they averaged 20-plus points per game as a sophomore, junior, and senior, including 28.1 points. six rebounds, five assists, and three steals in 2010. Appling went on to play all four years at Michigan State, and is currently in the NBA's D-League.

He also was named a McDonald's All-American in 2010.\n\n2.Class of 2006 SF DeShawn Sims: He's known as \"Peedi\" when you mention his name around Detroit, and Sims was definitely one of the best high school players to ever play in the city. A bit undersized a 6-8 for his position, but more than able to get his points in a variety of ways, inside or outside. One of the most decorated players out of Pershing, he averaged 19.8 points, 10.3 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks in his career there. He started for three years, and averaged 25 points, 12 rebounds, and three blocks as a senior. Sims had a good career at Michigan, and now plays overseas in the Lebanese Basketball League.

Rivals.com ranked him as the No.31 best player in the country in 2006, and a four-star recruit.\n\n3.Class of 2008 PG Demetrius Ward: A big 6-3 combo guard who excelled at getting in the lane and scoring at the rim, Ward didn't win any championships at Pershing (state or city), but his game spoke volumes. A nice blend of size, scoring ability, and craftiness is what made Ward so special at Pershing. He averaged 16.9 points and 8.0 rebounds as a senior, taking Pershing to the Class A state title game, which they lost to Saginaw and A big 6-3 combo guard who excelled at getting in the lane and scoring at the rim, Ward didn't win any championships at Pershing (state or city), but his game spoke volumes.

But to be so big, Nix was nimble, could score at will almost in the paint, and was a tremendous rebounder. He helped Pershing win a Class A state title in 2009, where he averaged 15 points and 15 rebounds per game senior year.

Instead, he was 5-9, but played much bigger. There wasn't much Felder couldn't do on the floor at his size, with his quickness, strength, vision, shooting, leadership, and ability to jump.

He averaged an incredible 23 points and 16 rebounds as a senior. Tillman currently plays for VCU.

Just ask Detroit Cass Tech about his fade-away 3-pointer at the buzzer in the state playoffs in 2013. He averaged 20.4 points a game and seven rebounds as a senior, helping them to 25-1 record.

He was a three-year starter for Pershing, and averaged 17 points, 6.7 rebounds, and 3.4 assists as a senior in 2012.

She would not speculate on when a ruling might be made or any possible implications it might hold for Missouri.\n\nAlden said the university interpreted NCAA rules to mean a prospect could be accompanied on a noncommercial flight if the extra party paid fair market value for the ticket.\n\nThe women paid the university between $200 and $300 each for their tickets prior to flying from Detroit to Columbia Regional Airport on Sept. 17 and returning Sept. 19, Alden said.\n\n\"I feel confident in the process. I feel confident in our basketball program. And, I feel confident in the NCAA,\" Alden said. \"Do I feel confident in a great result? I have no idea.\"\n\nAlthough Jankowski would not comment specifically on Missouri's situation, she said NCAA rules are clear regarding transportation of prospective recruits and their relatives and friends.\n\nA school can use commercial flights or noncommercial flights the school's own plane, charter or private planes to bring prospects to campus for official visits, Jankowski said. But relatives, friends and legal guardians can accompany prospects only on commercial flights. On those flights, the prospect's fare is paid by the school. Anyone accompanying the prospect must pay his or her own way.\n\n\"The NCAA does not support that a parent can be on a noncommercial flight,\" Jankowski said. It does not matter whether the parents pay for the flight, she added.\n\nPaulding and Johnson, both seniors, orally committed to Missouri last week. But now they could be declared ineligible, at least temporarily, before the Nov. 7 signing day.\n\n\"Once an institution determines there's been a violation involving an athlete or prospective athlete, it's their responsibility to make an eligibility ruling,\" Jankowski said. The university would then seek to have the athlete reinstated by the NCAA.\n\nNone of this would affect a student's ability to play at another school, Jankowski said.\n\nBut Alden said Missouri had yet to decide what to do with Paulding and Johnson's eligibility.\n\n\"We don't know if an infraction has indeed taken place,\" Alden said. \"The NCAA is the only one that can determine if an infraction has taken place.\"\n\nAlden said the call to the NCAA followed one Wednesday to the Big 12 Conference, which advised Missouri tha it would be \"beneficial\" to notify the NCAA.\n\nSnyder, who was heavily involved with recruiting as an assistant coach at Duke before being hired by Missouri in April, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Friday that he bears responsibility if an infraction had taken place.\n\n\"Unequivocally I do,\" he said. \"I'm the head basketball coach. That's what it means to be the head coach.\"\n\nPaulding, a 6-foot-4 guard, averaged 25.6 points, 11.2 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 3.0 blocked shots last season at Detroit Renaissance High. He said having his mother on the visit made it easier to choose a college. Paulding also visited Ohio State, Miami and Michigan State, but his mother made only the trip to Columbia.\n\nPaulding and his mother, Virginia Robinson, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that the two mothers and their sons were the only passengers on the chartered plane.\n\n\"It was a nice plane,\" Paulding said.\n\nJohnson, a 6-9 forward, averaged 16.4 points last season at Detroit Pershing High. He only visited Miami before choosing Missouri. Both players made an unofficial visit together to Missouri in August. But the September trip to Columbia over Parents Weekend solidified their choices.\n\n\u00a91999 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
