That woman was Hope Cooke. It was based on her autobiography.\n\nIt spoke about how the American media was enamoured with an American marrying Crown Prince Palden Thondup Namgyal of Sikkim in 1963. The press always heavily followed any trips of theirs to the United States. Vogue wanted to know her beauty secrets. What the media did not know was that this so-called fairy tale was anything but.\n\nHope Cooke was born on 24 June 1940 in San Francisco, California to John J. Cooke and Hope Noyes. When Hope was not yet two, her mother died in a single person plane crash in 1942. Her father then moved her and her sister, Harriet, to New York City with him to an apartment that was across the hall from their maternal grandparents (who Hope claimed were aloof and refused to talk about her mother). Hope and Harriet were raised by governesses; one beat the future royal with a coat hanger when she could not remember the Lord\u2019s Prayer. Their grandfather died when Hope was 12, and their grandmother passed away just three years later when Hope was 15.\n\nFrom then, Hope and Harriet lived with their maternal aunt and uncle; the latter was the former US Ambassador to Iran and Peru. Hope studied at both the Chaplin School in New York and the Madeira School in Virginia. She completed her high school education in Iran.\n\nShe chose to continue her studies and head to university. She enrolled at Sarah Lawrence College in 1959 where she majored in Asian Studies. One summer she travelled to India with her later recalling, \u201cI\u2019ve never been so happy \u2026 India! My heart explodes \u2026 The East is my home\u2026\u201d It was in Darjeeling that she met the recently widowed Palden Thondup Namgyal, Crown Prince of Sikkim.\n\nThey became engaged two years later, in 1961, after bonding over what the New York Times called the \u201csimilar isolation of their childhoods.\u201d The couple did not marry until 1963 due to astrologers claiming 1962 was a bad year for marriages.\n\nThe Crown Prince and Hope wed after the latter had renounced her American citizenship, in a Buddhist monastery on 20 March 1963; their ceremony was officiated by 14 lamas \u2013 the title for a high priest in Tibetian Buddhism. Although the wedding was a Buddhist ceremony, Hope never converted from Christianity. However, she was known to have practised Buddhism from an early age.\n\nTogether, they had two children: Prince Palden Gyurmed Namgyal and Princess Hope Leezum Namgyal. Hope gained three stepchildren (Prince Tenzing Kunzang Jigme Namgyal, Prince Tobgyal Wangchuk Tenzing Namgyal and Princess Yangchen Dolma Namgyal) from the union who she adored. She vowed that her children would know happiness and not grow up with the sad family life like both their parents.\n\nJust two years after their nuptials, the Crown Prince was proclaimed Sikkim\u2019s monarch (Chogyal or King) on 4 April 1965. His reign would be short, as he was deposed ten years later on 10 April 1975. He was put under house arrest in the palace. Not long after, Hope and Palden separated with Hope returning with their two children to the United States.\n\nHope later described her ex-husband as a heavy-drinker, sexist and philanderer. He continued his affair that started before he married Hope with a Belgian woman during their marriage. However, she was not innocent as she was also having an affair with an American man.\n\nHer popularity waned with Newsweek even calling her the Himalayan Marie-Antoinette after Sikkim was annexed into India. A US Representative and US Senator co-sponsored a bill to give Hope her American citizenship back, but the bill would not pass until the language was altered to only give her permanent residence status. President Ford signed it in 1976. She and the Chogyal divorced in 1980. He died just two years later of cancer.\n\nIn 1983, she married for a second time to Mike Wallace, but this union did not last. She resided in London for a time, but she eventually returned to the United States. Hope now works as a writer and lecturer and lives in Brooklyn, New York."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/08/books/the-fairy-tale-that-turned-nightmare.html", "page_content": "Hope's loneliness and confusion grow over the years, and so does her spiritual quest. Grandfather dies when she's 12, Granny dies three years later. She goes to live with her aunt and uncle, Mary and Selden Chapin, then the ambassador to Iran, and finishes high school there. One summer in her late teens she travels to India: ''I've never been so happy ... India! My heart explodes ... The East is my home ... I must stay near India somehow ...''\n\nHope Cooke is majoring in Asian studies at Sarah Lawrence when she meets the recently widowed Crown Prince of Sikkim in Darjeeling (where, with typical eccentricity, she is taking a course in typing). Two years later they are engaged. The writer immediately hints at the complex pragmatism of this alliance: Her impulse toward him may be inspired by her fascination with Indian spirituality and her desire for some kind of rootedness; his impulse toward her is in part prompted by his need to find a mother for his children. Both are also driven toward each other by the similar isolation of their childhoods. ''Even more than me,'' Hope muses about the Prince's ''Chaplinesque loneliness,'' ''when he was small he had a rather sad life.''\n\nHope Cooke is an exceptionally chaste adventuress who seeks the tamer shores of security rather than the wilder shores of love. She's perhaps more infatuated with the prospect of nesting in her little Oriental palace than she is with the moody king. ''I want a family so much. I want to fill this nest, make it a real home.'' One of the most touching aspects of this story is her delight in recapturing childhood through her affection for her three stepchildren, whom she seems to love quite as much as she will later love her own son and daughter. She exults when her modest (five-bedroom) palace explodes with offspring and the family consumes 12 dozen eggs a week. She has made a fierce resolution to reverse the karma that had saddened her childhood and her husband's.''These children will be happy. The wheel of unhappiness that both my husband and I grew up on will not go to this generation.''\n\nBut the monsters lurking in Hope's fairy tale appear soon after her marriage. The Crown Prince may well have been one of the Far East's most enlightened rulers, as both the author and the historical record confirm: He shaped a model Asian state whose literacy rate and per capita income were twice as high as the neighboring countries of Nepal, Bhutan and India; he retained a measure of independence for a tiny country threatened on two sides, by an India intent on annexation and an equally aggressive Communist-dominated Tibet. Yet, as Hope Cooke describes him, he was also a heavy-drinking philanderer with an odious streak of macho sexism. Notwithstanding his strained finances, the Crown Prince managed to maintain a love affair with a married woman in Belgium before and during his marriage to Hope; he even flew to visit her a few weeks before Hope's first child was born. The lover wrote letters to the Prince on ''crisp rustling paper'' that Hope could hear crinkling in her husband's bathrobe when he hugged her at night. If a letter dropped to the floor, she read it while he went to the altar to perform his Buddhist prayers.\n\nWhen Sikkim's independence was endangered by the death of Nehru, who had carefully preserved Sikkim's autonomy under the terms of a protectorate, the Crown Prince began to drink more and throw temper tantrums. During one such tantrum, he tosses Hope's record player, her ''lifeline to the West,'' out the window. Fairy tale turns to nightmare as Indira Gandhi conspires to deprive Sikkim of the little independence it has. While Hope entertains visiting reporters interested in ''My Thirty Ways of Preparing Yak,'' she is secretly tippling beer in the morning, living on whisky, Valium and cigarettes from noon on. She begins to realize that the manic fervor with which she'd developed Sikkim's cottage industries and helped her husband fight Indian domination is a substitute for a love that barely exists, if it ever existed. On one of her yearly trips to New York, she has an affair with a man who had been a friend during her lonely adolescence, and the memory of this affair haunts her for the rest of her stay in the Far East. She lies in bed more dazed than ever by whisky and Valium, listening to Joan Baez sing freedom songs."}, {"url": "https://jothishi.com/astrology-matching-palden-thondup-namgyal-and-hope-cooke/", "page_content": "https://jothishi.com/celebrity-horoscope-match/Palden-Thondup-Namgyal-and-Hope-Cooke\n\nAbout Palden Thondup Namgyal and Hope Cooke\n\nPalden Thondup Namgyal (Sikkimese: \u0f51\u0f54\u0f63\u0f0b\u0f63\u0fa1\u0f53\u0f0b\u0f51\u0f7c\u0f53\u0f0b\u0f51\u0fb2\u0f74\u0f54\u0f0b\u0f62\u0fa3\u0f58\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f92\u0fb1\u0f63; Wylie: dpal-ldan don-grub rnam-rgyal) (23 May 1923 \u2013 29 January 1982) was the 12th and last Chogyal (king) of the Kingdom of Sikkim.Namgyal was born on 23 May 1923 at the Royal Palace, Park Ridge, Gangtok.At six, he became a student at St. Joseph\u2019s Convent in Kalimpong, but had to terminate his studies due to attacks of malaria.

Before joining the NYC Parks Department, he worked for AmeriCorps VISTA and Philadelphia Parks and Recreation. Mr. Botula majored in Geography and Civil Engineering in college which thoroughly prepared him for an environment-focused career.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe city has a huge role in managing water,\u201d he began. \u201cProviding drinking water and distributing water back into ponds and streams is essential. It\u2019s a precious resource.\u201d He noted that he loves working in a city as it provides opportunities for all different kinds of work and the NYC Parks Department is one of the biggest in the country \u2013 serving more than 30,000 acres of land, 600,000 street trees and 2,000,000 trees in parks.\n\n\n\nMr. Botula offered examples of the various jobs he has done \u2013 across each borough \u2013 such as monitoring wetlands, drainage studies, pond monitoring, restoration and design, and construction. \u201cWe can even send robots underground to explore pipes and drains that we can\u2019t get to.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter this brief overview, he commenced the main focus of the day\u2019s presentation (which coincides with the Class 4 scientists\u2019 recent study of water): Where does water go when it lands on park properties? Where does the water from homes (toilets, sinks, showers, etc.) end up?\n\n\n\nToday, Mr. Botula explained, the water runs to a treatment plant to be cleansed before it is released back into a river, stream, etc. In prior years, however, that wasn\u2019t always the case, which can be damaging to water quality.\n\n\u201cWhen it rains a lot, the sewage from homes can combine with rain water,\u201d he explained. \u201cMy goal as an engineer is to make less water go into the drains at a slower rate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cA great engineering design challenge!\u201d Ms. Berg said.\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, we must make design decisions to create natural filtration.\u201d\n\nMr. Botula shared his screen to show a cartoon scenario depicting rainwater rushing down pavement and overflowing the pipes. He asked the students to make an educated guess on additions that would slow water down.\n\n\n\nUsing the poll feature on Zoom, students selected whether grass or soil would help and why. After thirty seconds, answers were revealed. \u201cTurns out, you\u2019re all correct. You can make arguments for both of these options,\u201d Mr. Botula said.\n\nThe next poll question had students rank the order of three elements (sand, dirt and gravel) by which would capture the most water from fastest to slowest.\n\n\u201cHmm, does this remind anyone of the water filters we made?\u201d prompted Ms. Berg, who received many nodding heads in response. Most students opted for gravel, sand, then dirt; which was the correct order.\n\n\n\nMr. Botula explained that when you put these ideas together (grass, soil, gravel), you have a rain garden \u2013 a real-life filtration example that can be found all over the city!\n\n\n\nThe curious scholars were actively engaged and asked many questions. One asked, \u201cHow are rain gardens used as a filter for pollutants?\u201d to which Mr. Botula clarified that they typically add species that remove nitrogen and phosphorous, and these plants also prevent trash from going into drains.\n\n\n\nAnother asked, \u201cCan this project cause species to be reintroduced that may have left New York City?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, we\u2019re expanding or reintroducing options for animals,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, by the Bronx Zoo, there\u2019s a dam. Fish used to move upstream to lay their eggs but they couldn\u2019t get past. We\u2019ve created a passage for them to go through.\u201d\n\nAs their time together came to an end, Mr. Botula said, \u201cMy hope is to restore and preserve natural land, to make the city and water healthier. It\u2019s important to take advantage of what we have and make the most of it.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter an unmuted round of applause for their guest, Ms. Berg said, \u201cWe\u2019ve made so many connections to what we\u2019ve learned in class!

With instructional experience in all three divisions, Suzanne has created environments in which community members are willing, able and excited to collaborate and innovate to best meet the developmental needs of children in Kindergarten through Class 12.\n\nLincoln School, where Suzanne served as Head prior to coming to Chapin, is a Quaker, all-girls K to grade 12 school with a robust coed program for children ages six weeks through PreK. The only independent all-girls school in Rhode Island, Lincoln has benefited tremendously from Suzanne\u2019s direction. There, she enhanced the curriculum by forming strategic partnerships with local and global institutions and thought-leaders, and has significantly increased both enrollment and the endowment.\n\nPreviously, Suzanne spent 15 years at The Berkeley Carroll School, the last nine as Head of Upper School, where she oversaw 40 teachers and a student body of 240. Prior to this, Suzanne was an English middle- and upper-school teacher and also the English Chair for a year there. Before that, Suzanne was head teacher of 1st and then 2nd grade at Saint Ann\u2019s School in Brooklyn and served as director of the Associate Teachers Program for 1st-3rd grades. Her first teaching position was as an Associate Teacher in the 2nd/3rdgrade, a combined class at the time at The Brearley School.\n\nSuzanne earned a Masters in Elementary Education, Magna Cum Laude, from Bank Street College and has a B.A. in English and French from Bowdoin College.

After a long flight the day before, they appeared surprisingly well rested and eager to get to know the students.\n\nAs the visitors \u2013 Hecky Odera, Mercy Kasiti, Florence Odero and Julia Alubala \u2013 settled into seats at the front of the room, the students held tight to small slips of paper on which they had written questions to ask, based on their research and curiosity.\n\nFor the past several weeks, Class 3 has been immersed in a comprehensive study of Africa. Their classroom work was beautifully enhanced on this particular afternoon, when the students had the opportunity to connect with these four accomplished individuals, who are passionate educators from two pioneering schools in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nChapin and the schools \u2013 the Kibera School for Girls (KSG) and the Mathare School for Girls (MSG) \u2013 enjoy a robust, ongoing partnership that focuses primarily on faculty exchange initiatives. During past summers, members of Chapin\u2019s professional community have traveled to Nairobi to work with both school communities, which are located in vast, unauthorized slums. They supported local teachers and worked with them to develop curriculum, while learning about the area\u2019s culture, customs and educational philosophy.\n\nKSG, founded in 2009, and MSG, established in 2014, are operated by SHOFCO (Shining Hope for Communities), an international non-profit that transforms extremely impoverished communities through health and wellness services, leadership opportunities and rigorous education for women and girls. The schools have dramatically altered the path for hundreds of promising female students. Currently, a collective 566 students attend pre-school through grade 8 and are thriving.\n\nFor the very first time, the Kenyan educators, two classroom teachers and two administrators, have been able to journey to New York City to immerse themselves in life at Chapin, their sister school, and share their knowledge and expertise. The four flew direct from Nairobi to JFK International Airport, arriving on Sunday, April 28.\n\nThe focus of their weeklong residency is student-centered learning with specific attention to engagement. Thus, Mr. Odera, Ms. Kasiti, Ms. Odero and Ms. Alubala are observing a variety of Lower and Middle School classes, speaking with teachers and students, and gathering information and impressions to take back to their colleagues in Kenya. After school hours, they are also exploring New York City\u2019s numerous sights and tasting a variety of cuisines, guided by professional community members Sarah Bellantoni, Lynette Engel and Laura O\u2019Reilly, who have all traveled to Nairobi.\n\nBack in Room 43, an animated discussion got underway. \u201cWe prepared some questions for you,\u201d Head teacher Rick Frey explained to the visitors, who gazed out at a sea of raised hands. \u201cLoud and proud,\u201d Mr. Frey reminded the class.\n\nReading from their slips of paper, the students posed thoughtful questions that ran the gamut from asking what subjects are taught (literacy, math, science, social studies, STEM, life skills, all in English, as well as Swahili) to what the schools serve for breakfast and lunch (porridge, rice and beans, fruit, lentils and ugali, an African cornmeal dish) to whether or not they have running water (they do, thanks to SHOFCO\u2019s support).\n\nSeveral students were interested in finding out more about Kenya\u2019s wild animal population. \u201cWho knows what the \u2018Big Five\u2019 are?\u201d Mr. Odera asked the audience, referring to the five most prominent species in Africa. After several guesses, the students arrived at the correct responses \u2013 lion, rhinoceros, elephant, buffalo and leopard. Mr. Odera told the students that such animals resided in nearby Nairobi National Park.\n\nThe students also asked about the schools\u2019 athletic offerings, which, they learned, include basketball and rugby; the after-school program, the favorites of which are art and drama; and the uniform, which consists of a light-blue dress with white trim, a red pullover sweater and red knee socks.\n\nFinally, as the class period wound down, one student asked a final question: \u201cWhy did you want to work at Kibera School and Mathare School?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe girls we teach are in so much need. Everything we share with them, we see smiles on their faces. We make them happy,\u201d remarked Ms. Alubala, who is one of KSG\u2019s founding teachers.\n\nAfter a boisterous round of applause, the special guests said goodbye to Class 3 and continued on with their Chapin activities, which included a welcome reception later that day.

One of seven children, she was born on September 13, 1863 in Wickford, Rhode Island. Because her family traveled extensively, Miss Chapin was tutored at home, with the exception of the single year she spent at Miss Abbott\u2019s School in Providence, Rhode Island. Miss Abbott\u2019s had a profound effect on Miss Chapin, and she would later adopt many of its traditions in her own school.\n\nIn 1888, when she was 25 years old, Miss Chapin came to New York to become a teacher, one of the few jobs available to an educated woman. In keeping with the custom of teaching young children at home, Miss Chapin\u2019s first students were six little girls whom she taught in the parlor of a private residence. These girls would eventually enroll at The Brearley School, and thus Miss Chapin kept in contact with James G. Croswell, Headmaster of Brearley, and his secretary, Alice Wetmore. In 1894 Miss Wetmore asked Miss Chapin to join her in starting a school. The partnership seemed ideal: Miss Wetmore knew the mechanics of running a school, while Miss Chapin was a gifted teacher who could attract new students through her many friends and acquaintances.\n\nTheir new venture was called Primary Classes for Girls. Beginning with 18 pupils initially, enrollment soon doubled. For the next seven years, Miss Wetmore and Miss Chapin held Primary Classes for Girls, and the School was a resounding success. With her bright personality and enduring vision, Miss Chapin charmed the parents and inspired her students, preparing for the day when she would establish a school of her own.\n\nAfter ending her partnership with Miss Wetmore, Miss Chapin borrowed $2,000 to pay the first year\u2019s rent on a house at 12 West 47 Street, and in October 1901, she opened Miss Chapin\u2019s School for Girls with 78 students and seven teachers. The School, which added one class each year, offered academics, lessons in moral development as well as physical education, which was largely unheard of at the time. By 1904, with 100 students and 12 teachers, the School had outgrown its quarters. Thus, Miss Chapin leased two houses \u2013 46 and 48 East 58 Street \u2013 and in 1905 the School moved again. The first two students graduated in 1908, and Miss Chapin\u2019s School\u2019s reputation continued to grow. In 1909, to accommodate her ever-expanding student population, Miss Chapin purchased two brownstones, at 32 and 34 East 57 Street, and the School relocated again in 1910. In 1928, Miss Chapin\u2019s School settled into its current location at 100 East End Avenue overlooking the majestic East River.\n\nAlong with her accomplishments as an educator, Miss Chapin was ardently dedicated to social issues, particularly the advancement of women. She edited \u201cFar and Near,\u201d a monthly periodical that addressed the concerns of working women around the country. She also proudly marched in the first women\u2019s suffrage procession.\n\nMiss Chapin retired from active management of her school in 1932, paving the way for her loyal colleagues Ethel Grey Stringfellow and Mary Cecelia Fairfax to become joint Headmistresses. Maria Bowen Chapin died on March 8, 1934, and honoring her wishes, the School\u2019s name was changed to The Chapin School, Ltd."}]}
