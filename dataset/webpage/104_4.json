He spent the majority of his 16-season playing career in the minor leagues, but he appeared sporadically in the majors with the A\u2019s (both in Kansas City and, later, in Oakland, where the franchise moved), the Atlanta Braves, and the Chicago Cubs. He was named the manager of a minor-league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox in 1978, and his first big-league managerial job came the following year, when he took over the White Sox late in the 1979 season.\n\nBritannica Quiz Baseball\n\nThe cerebral La Russa\u2014who earned a law degree shortly before assuming managerial duties in Chicago\u2014proved to be a natural leader in the clubhouse. He developed a managerial style that consisted of frequent in-game situational substitutions that came in response to the great attention he paid to the nuances and flow of a particular game (which occasionally led to criticism that La Russa \u201covermanaged\u201d). In 1983 he guided the White Sox to a 99-win season and the team\u2019s first playoff appearance in 24 years. However, a slow start to the 1986 campaign and a strained working relationship with the team\u2019s new general manager (former outfielder Ken Harrelson, who left the announcing booth to spend only one tumultuous season running the White Sox) led to La Russa\u2019s being fired three months into the season. He was out of work for less than a month before he was hired to manage the A\u2019s.\n\nLa Russa quickly turned the A\u2019s into the most-dominant team in baseball. He led Oakland to the highest win total in the major leagues for three straight seasons (1988\u201390), each of which also ended with the Athletics\u2019 winning the American League (AL) pennant. The team was upset in two of its World Series appearances during that period, but the A\u2019s did defeat the San Francisco Giants to win a championship in 1989. La Russa and the A\u2019s won another division title in 1992, but after the team posted three consecutive losing seasons (1993\u201395), he opted out of his contract and signed with the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nLa Russa\u2019s third managerial stint was even more successful than his first two. In his initial season in St. Louis, he guided the Cardinals to the first of seven division titles the team would win during his tenure. The Cardinals won a National League (NL) pennant in 2004, and in 2006 the team beat the Detroit Tigers to win the World Series. In 2011 La Russa led St. Louis on improbable comebacks to clinch a postseason berth (after trailing in the Wild Card standings by 8 1/2 games with a month remaining in the regular season) and to win the World Series (after twice being one strike away from elimination). La Russa retired soon after earning his third championship ring. He had been named the AL\u2019s Manager of the Year three times (1983, 1988, and 1992) and won the NL\u2019s version of the award in 2002.\n\nThree years after his retirement from managing, La Russa joined the Arizona Diamondbacks as the team\u2019s chief baseball officer. He was demoted to an advisory role with the franchise following the 2016 season after the Diamondbacks ran off three consecutive losing campaigns during his tenure, and he left the team after the 2017 season. La Russa then joined the Boston Red Sox as an assistant to the team\u2019s general manager. After the 2020 season he returned to the Chicago White Sox as general manager. In his first season back with the team, Chicago finished first in the Central Division, and La Russa won his 2,764th game, which moved him into second place for most career wins by a general manager. In the 2021 postseason the White Sox lost in the AL Division Series.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

His experience in the field was nonexistent. His doctorate was in veterinary medicine. Lewis came to the Diamondbacks because he possessed a quality far more important than developing algorithms or building models: For 35 years, he had been Tony La Russa's friend.\n\nThe hiring of Lewis prompted snickers around the game. At the time La Russa was stripped of power three years into the job, the Diamondbacks had gone 212-274. His handpicked GM, old friend Dave Stewart, had been fired. Lewis was replaced.\n\nCronyism in the game is as old as the spitball, and an inner circle of powerful men -- they're all men -- has spent decades in the game fomenting it. When they want something, they tend to get it.\n\nJerry Reinsdorf, the Chicago White Sox's owner for nearly 40 years, said he regretted trading Harold Baines because had he not, Baines would have reached 3,000 hits. He finished his career with 2,866, and his other numbers were well shy of Hall of Fame standards. So Reinsdorf found himself a place on a Hall committee voting on a special ballot with Baines-era players, argued vehemently on Baines' behalf and rammed him through to Cooperstown. One of the other 11 votes came from Tony La Russa.\n\nThis is how it works. And this is how perhaps the most inexplicable news of the offseason unfolded at its outset Thursday: La Russa, now 76 years old, out of the dugout for the last nine, was named manager of the White Sox. He inherits a team brimming with young, dynamic talent -- a team that, in many ways, represents a new epoch of baseball whose principles and priorities run antithetical to La Russa's.\n\nThere was no more desirable job available this offseason than the White Sox's -- not even the big-market, big-money Boston Red Sox's. The White Sox are a ready-made contender, a playoff team that fired its manager, Rick Renteria, with the publicly stated intention of taking a step forward via a replacement with recent championship experience. The opportunity was undeniable. The last time a playoff team fired a manager immediately after its season ended was in 2017, when Boston got rid of John Farrell and Washington Dusty Baker. The next year, under Alex Cora, the Red Sox won the World Series. The year after that, Davey Martinez helmed the Nationals to a championship.\n\nTony La Russa got the White Sox's job this week because of another crony hire. In 1986, Reinsdorf moved Ken \"Hawk\" Harrelson, a former player, from the broadcast booth to the front office. General manager Roland Hemond was demoted and left. Harrelson dismissed a 29-year-old executive named Dave Dombrowski. And he purged the manager too.\n\nLetting Harrelson fire La Russa, Reinsdorf said, was his greatest regret, even more than what happened to Harold Baines. And at 84 years old, given a chance to remedy that mistake, Reinsdorf wasted no time.\n\nThe White Sox recently contacted A.J. Hinch, the former Houston Astros manager, to determine his interest in their open managing job, league sources told ESPN. Hinch said the job very much appealed to him, according to sources. There was only one snag, which had become apparent inside the organization in recent days: Once La Russa expressed a desire to manage again, nobody else had a chance.\n\nThe White Sox's announcement finally came Thursday -- at the same time Hinch was interviewing with the Detroit Tigers, Chicago's American League Central rivals. Now, sources say, Hinch is on the verge of agreeing to a deal to manage the Tigers, an up-and-coming team that expects to challenge the White Sox sooner than later.\n\nHinch, 46, was connected to the Chicago job immediately after Renteria's firing. He had won a World Series with the Astros in 2017 and gone to another in 2019 before being fired in the wake of the team's sign-stealing scandal. Hinch's reputation in most quarters emerged unscathed, and his experience helping mold a young core into a championship-caliber group was almost too perfect a fit for a White Sox team that folded down the stretch of the shortened 2020 season and bowed out in the first round of the playoffs. It was so good, in fact, that the email the White Sox sent out to fans celebrating La Russa's hire ... included an image of Hinch's signature.\n\nIt was like the White Sox were trolling their own fans. (They blamed the snafu on a graphics glitch.) The job opening gave the club a perfect opportunity to acquaint itself with young, talented, diverse candidates to run a team that includes Cuban (Luis Robert, Jose Abreu, Yoan Moncada, Yasmani Grandal), Black (Tim Anderson) and Dominican (Eloy Jimenez) stars. Other teams have capitalized on the opportunity to do the same. Of the dozen who reportedly have interviewed for the Tigers job, five are Black, five white and two Latino. They range in age from 38 to 61. Boston has interviewed at least seven candidates: three white, two Black and two Latino.\n\nInside MLB's Ivy League culture Baseball's front offices have embraced analytics in the 21st century. Diversity? Not so much. Joon Lee \u00bb\n\nWhite Sox officials said they interviewed candidates other than La Russa, but USA Today named just one other: Willie Harris, the longtime White Sox utilityman, who is Black. With the makeup of its clubhouse, front office (Ken Williams, who is Black, serves as executive vice president) and the prior hiring of Renteria, the White Sox have been far more progressive than other teams when it comes to hiring minorities. It was jarring nevertheless to see Reinsdorf essentially flout the Selig Rule, named after his longtime collaborator and former commissioner Bud Selig, which calls for teams to interview minority candidates for high-level positions.\n\nNobody was going to come in and blow Reinsdorf away. His mind was made up, even as others balked. Players as well as rank-and-file employees told ESPN they were dumbfounded. Sure, they all respect La Russa's managing acumen. His accomplishments -- 2,728 wins, six World Series appearances, three titles -- speak for themselves.\n\nSo do his words. And that's what the players and employees were having trouble getting past.\n\nManaging a team in 2020 is, despite the perception that front offices write lineup cards and serve as puppet masters, perhaps the most trying day-to-day job in baseball. The best managers are polymaths: strategist, public-relations specialist, politician, therapist, mathematician, motivational speaker, innovator. The crusty manager who cared about baseball, baseball and baseball and gave not a moment of his time to much else is an anachronism. Or maybe was.\n\nBefore he spent even an hour as White Sox manager for the second time, La Russa addressed the intersection of his present and past. Four years ago, when Colin Kaepernick first took a knee to protest police brutality against Black people, La Russa unleashed a screed to Sports Illustrated about how his protest disrespected the constitution, the soldiers, the country, the American flag.\n\n\"I really question the sincerity of somebody like Kaepernick,\" La Russa said.\n\nIn the years since, the protests that once were limited to the NFL have spread to baseball. On Opening Day this year, Anderson, Abreu, Robert, Jimenez and star pitcher Lucas Giolito were among the eight uniformed White Sox personnel who knelt during the national anthem. Even more radical a change since La Russa's last game managing, a World Series-clinching victory with St. Louis in 2011, is the style of on-field play. The bat flips -- Anderson is among the best -- and the displays of emotion. The embrace, for the most part, of the \"Let the Kids Play\" ethos MLB marketed. That is these White Sox. That is their identity. And considering La Russa pooh-poohed Fernando Tatis Jr.'s grand slam on a 3-0 pitch this summer in an interview with The Washington Post, it was fair to ask how, exactly, he would police his team.\n\n\"If it's sincere, I didn't have a problem with it,\" La Russa said.\n\nIf it's sincere.\n\nThe rise of Fernando Tatis Jr. Since he was a child, Fernando Tatis Jr. has lived to play. This year, the game needs him just as much as he needs it. Jeff Passan \u00bb\n\n\"What I see now is that with players that are being more exuberant -- I take Tim Anderson for an example -- now it's people showing that, hey, I'm coming through,\" said La Russa, who in Oakland managed the homer-pimping Rickey Henderson and forearm-smashing Bash Brothers. \"In fact, Major League Baseball is encouraging them to do so. And if I see that it's sincere and directed toward the game, that's displaying the kind of emotion you want.\"\n\nIf I see that it's sincere.\n\n\"If your team celebrates and their team celebrates,\" La Russa said, \"neither team can be upset when you see celebrations, as long as everyone's doing it sincerely.\"\n\nAs long as everyone's doing it sincerely.\n\nLa Russa couldn't help himself. He kept retreating to that crutch, the same one he had used four years earlier, when he attacked Kaepernick's motives with falsehood-filled broadsides.\n\nSincere. Sincerely. Sincerity. All the same concept, the idea that whatever is under La Russa's microscope -- be it a protest or a bat flip -- is fine as long as it comes from a noble, honest, real place. Except that this nobility, this honesty, this reality -- it is not objective. It can't be. What's sincere to one man may be insincere to another, and when that was pointed out to La Russa, he fell back on that same tired philosophy -- when he sees it, he knows it -- the sort of incurious hubris that would lead someone to hire a veterinarian who flexed his math muscles stock-picking for a data science job.\n\n\"I evaluate players' commitment to our team,\" La Russa said. \"And based on watching them closely, you can detect the sincerity of when they say 'I'm all-in for helping the team,' and then you look around and see that they are not all-in. So I think you look at actions.\n\n\"Words are words. I would look at actions, and what I'm seeing, one of the reasons I'm so encouraged by what I've seen the last bunch of years, is how players are backing up their words with actions.\"\n\nHe's right. Words are words. And it was particularly interesting to hear him revisit his about Kaepernick from four years ago.\n\n\"I know in 2016, when the first issue occurred, my initial instincts were all about respecting the flag and the anthem and what America stands for,\" La Russa said Thursday.\n\n\"There's been a lot that's gone on in a very healthy way since 2016. Not only do I respect but I applaud the awareness that's come into not just society but especially in sports. If you talk about specifically baseball, I applaud and would support the fact they are now addressing [and] identifying the injustices, especially on the racial side. And as long as it's peacefully protested and sincere ... I'm all for it.\"\n\nThe Black experience in MLB Players, managers and the one major leaguer who took a knee share their experiences of race issues inside the game and out. Story \u00bb\n\nBryant: The exile of Bruce Maxwell \u00bb\n\nThere it was again. Sincere, as if sincerity is more important than injustice, as if one need exist to validate the other, as if his opinion means any more than Tim Anderson's or Jose Abreu's or Lucas Giolito's or anyone else's. As if he's got the monopoly on sincerity.\n\nIn fact, go back not four years ago but nine months ago to when La Russa told Graham Bensinger in an interview: \"I was so upset when the kneel-down [sic] in the NFL. It's not that you don't have something that you dislike. There's a different way to protest it. When you kneel down, you disrespect the flag, the country and the anthem. Men and women are fighting and dying for that. It's the wrong way to protest.\"\n\nMaybe George Floyd changed things for La Russa. Maybe it was something else. Or maybe it's fair to wonder whether someone who just got hired for a job that needs him to be a politician and a public-relations specialist was just saying what he had to say and not necessarily being sincere. What a shame that would be.\n\nIt is very possible that Tony La Russa is a smashing success as White Sox manager. For all the consternation about the hire, which even La Russa acknowledged in a tweet Thursday night, the White Sox are an extremely talented team, and La Russa is a historically competent manager. His hiring neither dooms nor damns Chicago. What so deeply frustrated White Sox fans was the rationale behind it, the process behind it and the unfortunate commonality that ties them together.\n\nNobody, in fact, put it better than La Russa: \"How rare is it to get an opportunity to manage a team that's this talented and this close to winning?\"\n\nWay-too-early 2021 MLB Power Rankings No, we haven't a clue how baseball's offseason will play out. We're ranking all 30 teams anyway.\n\nWay-too-early Power Rankings \u00bb\n\nWay-too-early MLB awards picks \u00bb\n\nExtraordinarily, especially a team that general manager Rick Hahn so expertly put together -- one with Anderson, Robert, Moncada and Jimenez all signed to long-term deals, with a core that for the next half-decade should at very least keep the White Sox in contention and at best compete for multiple championships. That kind of team, the logic goes, should have the kind of manager who will grow with it, a manager chosen not by an owner trying to right an almost-four-decades-old wrong but by the GM and staff that put the team together in the first place. That is how functional organizations work. The baseball people make the baseball decisions. The owners let them.\n\nThis isn't about age. It's more a question of execution. Joe Maddon, 66, has managed winners in 11 of the past 14 years, so that's what the Los Angeles Angels hired him to do. The Astros needed a reputation rehabilitation, and few know how to charm the media and public like Dusty Baker, 71. What is La Russa today? More Jack McKeon or Bobby Valentine? Joe Gibbs or Dick Vermeil? Is he still a brilliant tactician -- clearly better than all those people who weren't interviewed because cronyism-gone-wrong, which at this point might as well be in the fossil record, necessitates some recompense?\n\nEither Reinsdorf didn't recognize there would be widespread opposition internally as well as externally to handing over the Corvette they'd built to someone who hadn't gotten behind the wheel in a decade -- or he didn't care. The former would be sad. The latter would be infuriating.\n\nEspecially because in the interview nine months ago, Bensinger asked Reinsdorf whether La Russa would ever manage again, and Reinsdorf said: \"Managing, it just takes an awful lot out of you. There's nothing else for him to accomplish. He's won three World Series. He's in the Hall of Fame. There's no reason to go back to managing and have to try to deal with people who are 22 years old when you're 75 years old.\"\n\nClearly there was a reason, because here was Tony La Russa, Chicago White Sox manager (1979-1986, 2021- ). He wanted something, and Jerry Reinsdorf gave it to him, like they always do. Now we'll see just how sincere he was about making the most of it."}, {"url": "https://www.mlb.com/news/tony-la-russa-joe-torre-bobby-cox-elected-to-baseball-hall-of-fame-c64493980", "page_content": "\"When I think of these guys, I think of the respect they've had from their players, their fans and their organizations,\" said Phil Niekro, a Hall of Famer who pitched for both Cox and Torre, was briefly a teammate of La Russa's, and was a member of the election committee. \"They are men of integrity and character. I was honored and privileged to play for a couple of these guys.\n\n\"We're in Disney World right now. This is a Magical Kingdom. I think we just honored the three kings among the managers. It's a magical day for each and every one of them, and we're so excited about having them in the Hall of Fame.\"\n\nCox's election is matched up with the candidacies on the Baseball Writers' Association of America ballot of two Braves pitchers, Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine, who pitched together for Cox for a decade and between them spent 28 seasons with Atlanta. Maddux totaled 355 wins and Glavine won 305. Any electees from the BBWAA ballot will be announced in New York on Jan. 8.\n\n\"I'm still getting goose bumps,\" Cox said. \"I'm excited to be in Cooperstown in July and get inducted. It's the greatest honor you can have in baseball. I'm going in with great company. I'm just hoping that Glav and Mad Dog can be up there on the stage with me. They were two of the guys who got me there, or helped get me there. That would be the final, finishing touch, going in with those two.\"\n\nCox, Torre and La Russa were among 12 people on the Expansion Era ballot, which included another landmark skipper, Billy Martin; players Dave Concepcion, Steve Garvey, Tommy John, Dave Parker, Dan Quisenberry and Ted Simmons; Marvin Miller, the influential executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association; and iconic Yankees principal owner George Steinbrenner.\n\nNone of the other nine received more than six of the 16 possible votes. Like all Hall of Fame elections, a candidate's name needs to appear on at least 75 percent of the ballots to be elected. On this committee, that was 12 votes. Each member could vote for a maximum of five candidates.\n\nMiller's name had previously been on ballots studied by several permutations of the Veterans Committee, and he missed election by a single vote on the first Expansion Era ballot three years ago. He died last year. Steinbrenner, Martin, Concepcion, Garvey, John and Simmons were also on the previous Expansion Era ballot.\n\nBut the selection of the three managers provided an epic highlight. Monday's announcement assured that the 2014 induction weekend will be one of the most widely attended and covered ever.\n\nTorre and Cox had each attended one recent induction each, while La Russa has never been to one.\n\n\"You realize you want to offer thanks to the people who made it possible,\" said La Russa, whose managing career began with the White Sox under owner Jerry Reinsdorf and is now a consultant to Major League Baseball on on-field issues. \"You want to thank the family. There have been a lot sacrifices by my wife and daughter. You go to the park early and you stay late. And finally, you realize who is sitting behind you. I can categorically state I don't think I will ever feel comfortable as a member of that club.\"\n\n\"I can't tell you how I'm going to feel,\" said Torre, who also managed the Mets, Braves, Cardinals and Dodgers and is currently MLB's executive vice president of baseball operations. \"All I know, and Tony just said it, when you see who else is there, players who have obviously been inducted before you and come up every year. It's obviously special to them. I've admired these players even though I might have played or managed against some of them. So I don't know how I'm going to feel, but I can tell you it will be a feeling I've never had before.\"\n\nCox compiled a 2,504-2,001 (.556) record in his 29 seasons, which included four managing the Blue Jays. His Braves won the 1995 World Series while capturing five National League pennants during his 25 years with Atlanta. Cox led Atlanta to a record 14 straight division titles from 1991-2005.\n\nLa Russa had a 2,728-2,365 (.536) record in 33 seasons, winning the World Series with the A's in 1989 and the Cardinals in 2006 and '11. He also guided Oakland to three American League pennants (1988-90) in 10 seasons and the Cards to three NL pennants (2004, '06 and '11) in 16 years. La Russa also spent eight seasons managing the White Sox, taking them to the AL Championship Series in 1983.\n\nFollowing an 18-year playing career in which he had a .297 batting average and one batting title, Torre posted a 2,326-1,997 record, good for a .538 winning percentage. Torre led the Yankees to Series titles in 1996, '98, '99 and 2000 (in addition to 100-win seasons in 1998 and from 2002-04), and six AL pennants. He spent his first 14 seasons a manager with the Mets, Braves and Cardinals, and finished his career managing the Dodgers in 2010. Torre took his teams in New York and Los Angeles into the playoffs every year from 1996-2009.\n\nThe 16-member electorate charged with the review of the Expansion Era ballot consisted of Hall of Famers Rod Carew, Carlton Fisk, Whitey Herzog, Tommy Lasorda, Paul Molitor, Joe Morgan, Niekro, and Frank Robinson; Major League executives Paul Beeston of the Blue Jays, Dave Montgomery of the Phillies, Reinsdorf and Andy MacPhail, formerly of the Twins, Cubs and Orioles.

And he may be doing it with the team that gave his first managing job, the Chicago White Sox.\n\nFollowing a disappointing end to their 2020 season, the White Sox parted ways with manager Rick Renteria earlier this week and have reportedly received permission from the Angels to interview La Russa, who last served as a manager in 2011, a season in which he led the St. Louis Cardinals to a World Series title.\n\nSince leaving the Cardinals, Tony La Russa has held executive roles with Major League Baseball, the Arizona Diamondbacks, the Boston Red Sox, and, of course, the Angels. The 2014 Hall of Fame inductee, who also spent six seasons in the big leagues as a player, still seems to be very passionate about the game and is viewed by many as one of the greatest managers in MLB history.\n\nTony LaRussa began his managerial career with the Chicago White Sox\n\nFive years after his final game as a player, Tony La Russa was given his first job as a manager by the Chicago White Sox organization in 1978. La Russa managed the team\u2019s Double-A affiliate, the Knoxville Sox, for half a season before joining the big club midway through the year when the White Sox fired Bob Lemon and replaced him with Larry Doby. Doby was then fired at the end of the season and replaced by Don Kessinger, who served as a player-coach to begin the 1979 campaign. La Russa began that season as the manager of the Triple-A Iowa Oaks but was made the manager in Chicago when the White Sox fired Kessinger in late June.\n\nTony La Russa was named American League Manager of the Year in 1983 when he led the Sox to the ALCS but was fired less than three years later after Chicago got off to a 26-38 start to begin the 1986 season. In parts of eight seasons with the White Sox, La Russa posted a record of 522-510.\n\nHe led the Oakland A\u2019s to a World Series title in 1989\n\nLess than three weeks after being fired by the White Sox, Tony La Russa was named the manager of the Oakland A\u2019s in late July 1986, with whom he\u2019d spent parts of five seasons as a player.\n\nIt certainly didn\u2019t take long for the A\u2019s to become contenders under La Russa\u2019s management. Oakland made their first World Series appearance in 14 years in 1988, a season in which La Russa was named AL Manager of the Year, but lost to the Dodgers in five games. The following season, the A\u2019s won the World Series by sweeping the Giants, a series most remembered for being delayed due to the earthquake that occurred just before the start of Game 3. La Russa and the A\u2019s were huge favorites in the 1990 World Series but were swept by the Reds.\n\nTony La Russa won his third AL Manager of the Year award, his second with the A\u2019s, in 1992 by leading Oakland to its fourth AL West title in five years before losing to the Blue Jays in the ALCS. He managed the A\u2019s for three more seasons and ended his career in Oakland following the 1995 season. In 10 seasons with the A\u2019s, he amassed a record of 798-673.\n\nTony La Russa managed the St. Louis Cardinals for 16 seasons and won two World Series\n\nTony La Russa | Jeff Curry/Getty Images\n\nTony La Russa joined the St. Louis Cardinals ahead of the 1996 season, replacing interim manager Mike Jorgensen, who managed 96 games after the team fired Joe Torre during the 1995 season. Torre, of course, went on to win four World Series titles as the manager of the New York Yankees.\n\nIn his first season in St. Louis, La Russa led the Cardinals to a division title, the team\u2019s first since 1987. St. Louis lost to the Atlanta Braves in the NLCS in seven games. La Russa and the Cardinals returned to the postseason in 2000 and made the playoffs in six of seven seasons, a stretch that included two World Series appearances. St. Louis lost to the Red Sox in 2004 and defeated the Tigers in 2006.\n\nTony La Russa led the Cardinals to another World Series win in 2011, his last season with the team. In 16 seasons in St. Louis, La Russa posted a record of 1,408-1,182. His 2,728 career wins as a manager are good for third on the all-time list behind only John McGraw (2,763) and Connie Mack (3,731).\n\nAll stats courtesy of Baseball Reference"}, {"url": "https://www.onthisday.com/people/tony-la-russa", "page_content": "Profession: Baseball Manager\n\nBiography: Best known for his tenures as manager of the Chicago White Sox, Oakland Athletics, and St. Louis Cardinals.\n\n\n\nLa Russa guided his teams to three World Series titles, six league championships and twelve division titles in 33 seasons.\n\nBorn: October 4, 1944\n\nBirthplace: Tampa, Florida, USA\n\nAge: 78 years old\n\nGeneration: Silent Generation\n\nChinese Zodiac: Monkey\n\nStar Sign: Libra"}, {"url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/tony-larussa-named-as-white-sox-manager/", "page_content": "CHICAGO (CBS) -- The White Sox are betting their future on their past, naming Tony La Russa as the team's new manager.\n\nThe last time around, you would have seen Johnny Morris reporting on La Russa's White Sox for the evening news on CBS 2 after their games at old Comiskey Park. Now they'll be playing at Guaranteed Rate Field as the Sox have for the past 29 years, and CBS 2's Matt Zahn reported on the new edition of La Russa's White Sox on Thursday.\n\nLa Russa, 76, was last at the helm of the White Sox 34 years ago. Even though there had been rumblings in the past few weeks, it was still pretty stunning to see him announced as the new Sox manager.\n\nIt has been almost a decade since La Russa has managed in Major League Baseball at all; he last managed the St. Louis Cardinals in 2011, when they won the World Series. He has had front-office roles since and does not have recent managerial experience, which does not seem to line up with what White Sox general manager/senior vice president Rick Hahn said the team was looking for just three weeks ago.\n\n\"Quite frankly, as we talked a couple, three weeks ago when we initiated this process, this obviously played out a little differently than I described I thought it would for all of you,\" Hahn said. \"Initially, I think I was a little surprised, just given that I knew not only, obviously, that he was retired, but I knew that other clubs had reached out previously and were rebuffed.\"\n\nAccording to the team, La Russa signed a multiyear contract with the White Sox.\n\n\"My internal response has been excitement. I haven't had the first regret,\" La Russa said. \"I'm fired up. I'm ready to go. I'm anxious to get with the players. I want to show them what I represent as a person; as a professional.\"\n\nTony La Russa, a member of baseball's Hall of Fame, the third-winningest manager in baseball history, a three-time World Series champion and a four-time winner of the Manager of the Year Award, has been named the new manager of the Chicago White Sox. pic.twitter.com/RKP24rleHP \u2014 Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) October 29, 2020\n\nA news release said \"La Russa and Connie Mack are the only two managers to win World Series titles in three different decades and to win pennants in four decades. La Russa, who was named Manager of the Year in 1983, 1988, 1992, and 2002, is one of only four managers to receive the honor in each league.\"\n\nLa Russa was the manager of the White Sox from 1979 until 1986. The White Sox made one playoff appearance in that era, winning the American League West championship in 1983.\n\nDuring more than 30 seasons as a manager with the White Sox and then with the Oakland Athletics (1986-95) and St. Louis Cardinals (1996-2011), La Russa's teams have made 14 postseason appearances, won 12 division titles, six pennants and claimed three World Series championships (1989 with Oakland; 2006 and '11 with St. Louis.)\n\nLa Russa was fired from his first stint as Sox skipper back in 1986 by then-General Manager Hawk Harrelson. Sox Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf has regretted the move ever since, as La Russa went on to win those three titles elsewhere.\n\nIt was Reinsdorf who reached out to La Russa a few weeks ago to see if he had interest, and many believe this was Reinsdorf's decision to hire him.\n\nLa Russa said this is not about their relationship.\n\n\"His major interest on the baseball side is what's best for the Chicago White Sox and the fans that we're hoping are driving to our ballpark in droves,\" La Russa said. \"Any past relationship or current relationship he's had with me over the years. I mean, there were other opportunities to hire me that wouldn't hire me. I think all managers would understand this \u2013 I think everybody would understand this \u2013 how rare it is to get an opportunity to manage a team that's this talented and this close to winning.\"\n\nThe move to hire La Russa has been almost universally panned by Sox fans and people within baseball. A national report said it even caused conflict within the White Sox organization.\n\nMeanwhile, of course, one of the big questions is how 76-year-old La Russa can related to a mostly young, diverse White Sox team, with most of the players more than 50 years younger than he. La Russa sounds ready to work to bridge that age gap.\n\n\"You start with the respect, trust at zero. You have to work every day to earn it, and I did it for years, and I'm going to try very hard to do it, and the players will decide,\" he said, \"but I know if I come at it with what I've learned, and how I feel about putting that team in a good position to succeed, I think it'll happen.\"\n\nLa Russa has also been opposed in the past to showmanship by players such as backflips, and has also been against protesting during the National Anthem.\n\n\"When the first issue occurred, my initial instincts were all you about, you know, respecting the flag and the anthem and what America stands for. There's been a lot goes on in a very healthy way since 2016. I would applaud and support the fact that they are now addressing; identifying the injustices, especially on the racial side,\" he said.\n\nAs to the way players might express themselves on the field, he added: \"I do believe at the basis that sportsmanship is important. I always reasoned that if it's sincere, I didn't have a problem with it. And what I see now is that with players that are being more exuberant \u2013 and I take Tim Anderson for an example \u2013 if I see that it's sincere and it's directed towards the game, that's displaying the kind of emotion that you want.\"\n\nLa Russa said he has not talked to any of the players yet.\n\nAs a player himself, La Russa appeared in 132 major league games over six seasons with the Kansas City Athletics (1963), Oakland Athletics (1968-71), Atlanta Braves (1971) and Chicago Cubs (1973), batting .199 (35-176) with seven RBI. He retired as a player in 1977.\n\nLa Russa is 2,728-2,365 (.536) in 5,097 games as a manager and has a 70-58 (.547) record in postseason. His 2,728 career wins rank third all-time in the history of baseball, following Mack (3,731) and John McGraw (2,763). His teams have won 100 or more games four times, topped by 105 victories with the 2004 NL-pennant winning Cardinals.\n\nCBS 2's Matt Zahn contributed to this report.\n\nAlso From CBS Chicago:"}, {"url": "https://www.deseret.com/2011/11/1/20227508/mlb-after-3-world-series-titles-tony-la-russa-retires", "page_content": "ST. LOUIS \u2014 Tony La Russa waited until after the championship parade and then called a team meeting with his players.\n\n\"We didn't know what to expect,\" said pitcher Chris Carpenter, who won Game 7 of the World Series against Texas on Friday night. \"I think we all figured it was just going to be like, 'Thataway guys. Great year. Way to battle!' Instead, he dropped that on us. I think everybody was caught off-guard.\"\n\nAnd with that, the 67-year-old La Russa said goodbye to baseball and became the first manager to retire immediately after leading his team to a Series title \u2014 the third of his career.\n\n\"I think this just feels like it's time to end it,\" he said Monday. \"When I look in the mirror, I know I'd come back for the wrong reasons, and I didn't want to do that.\"\n\nLa Russa said he told general manager John Mozeliak of his decision in August \u2014 before the Cards rallied from a 101/2-game deficit in the NL wild-card race to upset Philadelphia and Milwaukee in the playoffs.\n\nThey won the thrilling seven-game Series after twice coming within a strike of elimination in Game 6.\n\n\"I tip my hat to him. He's had a great career. What a way to go out,\" Washington Nationals manager Davey Johnson said.\n\nThe player meeting was short and emotional.\n\n\"Some grown men cried,\" La Russa said, joking that, \"I kind of liked that because they made me cry a few times.\"\n\nLa Russa won the World Series with Oakland in 1989, and with St. Louis in 2006 and again this year, joining Sparky Anderson as the only manager to win with clubs in both leagues.\n\nDuring 33 seasons with the Chicago White Sox (1979-86), Oakland (1986-95) and St. Louis (1996-2011), La Russa compiled a 2,728-2,365 regular-season record. He trails only Connie Mack (3,731) and John McGraw (2,763) for wins. And his 70 postseason victories are behind only Joe Torre's 84.\n\nA rare manager with a law degree, La Russa was voted AL Manager of the Year three times, and NL Manager of the Year in 2002. He will be up for consideration for the Hall of Fame in December 2013, at the same time as Torre and Bobby Cox.\n\n\"I think you can make a case for him as best of all-time. Absolutely,\" said Detroit manager Jim Leyland, who coached for La Russa with the White Sox after managing against him in the minors.\n\nLeyland said La Russa was the \"total package\" as a manager, obsessing over the lineup card, outfoxing opponents during games and refusing to bend to public opinion.\n\n\"Terry Francona used to say 'If you manage for the guys in the seats, pretty soon you'll be sitting with 'em.' Tony never worried about that stuff,\" Leyland said. \"It's a good lesson for managers.\"\n\nLa Russa revolutionized the sport during his time with Oakland, making Dennis Eckersley a one-inning closer. Now, it's common for all 30 big league teams.\n\n\"He's been an outstanding leader of many different teams under many different circumstances, and that's hard to do,\" said New York Mets general manager Sandy Alderson, La Russa's GM with the Athletics.\n\nLa Russa had unusual strategies: He started a game with the pitcher batting eighth 432 times. He was renowned for his use of batter-pitcher matchups in determining which reliever to bring in, but also ridiculed \"Moneyball\" and its emphasis on statistics over human scouting and observation.\n\nPotential successors include Francona, Jim Riggleman and Joe Maddon, who has one year left on his deal in Tampa Bay but has expressed interest in the Cardinals in the past.\n\nA pal of Bobby Knight, Bill Parcells and Bill Belichick, La Russa was an outspoken supporter of PETA and animal rights, and could be seen during spring training years ago in Phoenix hitting fly balls to one of his dogs.\n\nHe was treated at the Mayo Clinic in May for shingles, which left his face swollen and right eye nearly shut. The manager downplayed his health, saying \"it had no bearing on my future.\"\n\nLa Russa spoke with little emotion at the news conference with one exception, when he paused to compose himself as he thanked his wife, Elaine, and two daughters for putting up with his absence over much of his long tenure.\n\nLa Russa often appeared tightlipped at his televised postgame news conferences, but behind the scenes he showed his sense of humor and often poked fun at himself by referencing his .199 career big league average in a playing career that consisted of 176 at-bats over 11 years as a second baseman, shortstop and third baseman. The manager was looser than usual and more reflective in October, perhaps doing a personal farewell tour.\n\nLa Russa donned a throwback Sam Bradford jersey on the sideline before the Rams' upset of the Saints on Sunday.\n\n\"I saw him smile more in the last few months during games than I ever saw in the eight years that I was here before it,\" Carpenter said. \"He was enjoying the moment, but I didn't know it.\"\n\nLa Russa gave a signal of his intentions to Dave Duncan, his former teammate and his pitching coach since they were together on the White Sox. Duncan left the team for several weeks to tend to his ailing wife, and La Russa asked whether Duncan could return in time for the regular-season finale.\n\nChris Duncan, a son of the pitching coach, who played for La Russa in St. Louis, said he was fairly certain this meant the end.\n\n\"Tony wanted his longtime sidekick, the coach who's been with him all the way, with him if it was going to be his last game,\" Chris Duncan told The Associated Press. \"That was important to him.\"\n\nLa Russa said it was definite that he'd never manage again and added he has no desire to be a general manager, a job he described as the hardest in baseball. He would be open to a position in baseball in the future, but probably not with the Cardinals.\n\n\"Me personally, I think it's time to step away for a long while,\" La Russa said.\n\nHired by Bill Veeck for his first major league managing job with the White Sox, La Russa was fired by White Sox GM Ken Harrelson.\n\n\"I allowed the general manager to fire him. That was the worst mistake I ever made,\" Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf said. \"It turned about to be great for Tony, though, because he left here at a time we weren't doing well and he went to Oakland right at the time that all of their talent came to fruition.\"\n\nLa Russa managed teams to 12 first-place finishes and six pennants, going to the World Series in three straight years with the A's from 1988-90. He also lost in the Series with the Cardinals in 2004.\n\n\"Tony wanted to win in spring training,\" Leyland said. \"He wanted everything done right from the start. It's like he was born to manage.\"\n\nCardinals chairman Bill DeWitt Jr. said he didn't try to talk La Russa out of his decision. The manager had taken his time in recent years deciding whether to return to baseball.\n\n\"I said, 'Are you sure you want to do this?'\" DeWitt said. \"I respected his decision. It was never about 'Do you want me to come back?'\"\n\n\"We're not going to find a Tony La Russa out there, given his career and what he's accomplished, what he's meant to the Cardinals,\" DeWitt said.\n\nMozeliak said the new manager will be given autonomy to hire staff. Duncan is under contract for 2012, but will likely also retire.\n\nMozeliak didn't think La Russa's departure would affect negotiations with Albert Pujols, a free agent for the first time after 11 seasons with the Cardinals.\n\n\"He probably understood that Tony is not going to manage forever,\" Mozeliak said.\n\nBefore heading home to California, La Russa said he was happy he didn't know what the future held for him. He even joked about his next occupation.\n\n\"Maybe open a book store,\" he said.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://docslib.org/doc/553602/tony-la-russa", "page_content": "T ony La Russa led his teams to three World Series titles (1989, 2006, and 2011) as a\n\nprofessional baseball manager and accumulated the third most managerial wins (2,728)\n\nin Major League Baseball history.

This marks the third National League pennant for the Cardinals in the past eight seasons. But a question arises from this latest feat: Can we proclaim La Russa the greatest manager of all time?\n\nThe Case for Tony La Russa\n\nHow many managers in baseball history have won World Series championships with both an American League team and a National League team? Other than La Russa, only one other managed to achieve that\u2014Sparky Anderson! La Russa won World Series championships managing the 1989 Oakland Athletics and the 2006 St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nHow many managers have led at least three teams to division titles? Billy Martin and Joe Torre are the only managers that come immediately to mind.\n\nHowever, Joe Torre never won a pennant with any other team but the New York Yankees. And Billy Martin had just one World Series championship that could easily be chalked up to George Steinbrenner for his signing of Reggie Jackson in the offseason prior to the 1977 season.\n\nTony La Russa has 12 division titles and six pennants (1988, 1989, 1990, 2004, 2006, 2011) while leading three different clubs to the League Championship Series (Chicago White Sox, Oakland Athletics and St. Louis Cardinals).\n\nHow many managers have had a 30+ year managerial career and never finished a season with 100+ losses? Even the legendary Casey Stengel finished a season with a stunning 120 losses with the 1962 New York Mets.\n\nConnie Mack, the great Philadelphia Athletics manager in the early 20th century, had a disastrous 1916 season when the A's finished with 117 losses. Furthermore, three times in the final ten seasons of Mack's managerial career with the Philadelphia Athletics between 1941 and 1950 did his club finish with 100 or more losses.\n\nThe only two managers besides La Russa that had a 30+ year managerial career and avoided any 100+ loss seasons were Joe Torre and John McGraw. Torre did have a couple of seasons where his teams flirted with 100, falling short with 99 and 96 losses. McGraw did all of his great work with one franchise, the New York Giants.\n\nThe Case against La Russa\n\n\n\n\n\nPending the outcome of the 2011 World Series, La Russa has only two World Series championships. This puts him well behind managers like Casey Stengel, John McGraw, Joe Torre and Connie Mack, all who won a heck of a lot more than two. Stengel managed the Yankees to seven World Series championships! Connie Mack had five World Series championships!\n\nFurthermore, La Russa's achievements in Oakland where the Athletics won three consecutive American League pennants from 1988 to 1990 get overshadowed by other circumstances. That powerful club he led to the Fall Classic during that three-year period included ballplayers who would later be among the most tainted during the Steroid Era, players like Mark McGwire and Jose Canseco.\n\nAdditionally, the one World Series title Oakland captured during that period is most remembered for the devastating earthquake that delayed Game 3 of that series for several weeks while San Francisco recovered from the damage.\n\nDespite more than 2,700 victories in his managerial career, Connie Mack and John McGraw remain very well ahead on that list. After all, Connie Mack managed for 50 years!\n\nSo the debate is set on the managerial greatness of Tony La Russa. Is he the greatest of all time? Or is there more he needs to achieve in order to remove all possible doubt?"}], "Tony La Russa Jr. is the only manager to win the World Series in both the American and National Leagues.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tony-La-Russa", "page_content": "Tony La Russa, byname of Anthony La Russa, Jr., (born October 4, 1944, Tampa, Florida, U.S.), American professional baseball manager who led his teams to three World Series titles (1989, 2006, and 2011) and was one of the winningest managers in major league history.\n\nLa Russa signed to play baseball with the Kansas City Athletics (or \u201cA\u2019s\u201d) out of high school. He spent the majority of his 16-season playing career in the minor leagues, but he appeared sporadically in the majors with the A\u2019s (both in Kansas City and, later, in Oakland, where the franchise moved), the Atlanta Braves, and the Chicago Cubs. He was named the manager of a minor-league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox in 1978, and his first big-league managerial job came the following year, when he took over the White Sox late in the 1979 season.\n\nBritannica Quiz Great Moments in Sports Quiz\n\nThe cerebral La Russa\u2014who earned a law degree shortly before assuming managerial duties in Chicago\u2014proved to be a natural leader in the clubhouse. He developed a managerial style that consisted of frequent in-game situational substitutions that came in response to the great attention he paid to the nuances and flow of a particular game (which occasionally led to criticism that La Russa \u201covermanaged\u201d). In 1983 he guided the White Sox to a 99-win season and the team\u2019s first playoff appearance in 24 years. However, a slow start to the 1986 campaign and a strained working relationship with the team\u2019s new general manager (former outfielder Ken Harrelson, who left the announcing booth to spend only one tumultuous season running the White Sox) led to La Russa\u2019s being fired three months into the season. He was out of work for less than a month before he was hired to manage the A\u2019s.\n\nLa Russa quickly turned the A\u2019s into the most-dominant team in baseball. He led Oakland to the highest win total in the major leagues for three straight seasons (1988\u201390), each of which also ended with the Athletics\u2019 winning the American League (AL) pennant. The team was upset in two of its World Series appearances during that period, but the A\u2019s did defeat the San Francisco Giants to win a championship in 1989. La Russa and the A\u2019s won another division title in 1992, but after the team posted three consecutive losing seasons (1993\u201395), he opted out of his contract and signed with the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nLa Russa\u2019s third managerial stint was even more successful than his first two. In his initial season in St. Louis, he guided the Cardinals to the first of seven division titles the team would win during his tenure. The Cardinals won a National League (NL) pennant in 2004, and in 2006 the team beat the Detroit Tigers to win the World Series. In 2011 La Russa led St. Louis on improbable comebacks to clinch a postseason berth (after trailing in the Wild Card standings by 8 1/2 games with a month remaining in the regular season) and to win the World Series (after twice being one strike away from elimination). La Russa retired soon after earning his third championship ring. He had been named the AL\u2019s Manager of the Year three times (1983, 1988, and 1992) and won the NL\u2019s version of the award in 2002.\n\nThree years after his retirement from managing, La Russa joined the Arizona Diamondbacks as the team\u2019s chief baseball officer. He was demoted to an advisory role with the franchise following the 2016 season after the Diamondbacks ran off three consecutive losing campaigns during his tenure, and he left the team after the 2017 season. La Russa then joined the Boston Red Sox as an assistant to the team\u2019s general manager. After the 2020 season he returned to the Chicago White Sox as general manager. In his first season back with the team, Chicago finished first in the Central Division, and La Russa won his 2,764th game, which moved him into second place for most career wins by a general manager. In the 2021 postseason the White Sox lost in the AL Division Series.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

American professional baseball manager Tony La Russa led his teams to three World Series titles (1989, 2006, and 2011). He also accumulated the third most managerial wins (2,728) in major league history.\n\nAnthony La Russa, Jr., was born on October 4, 1944, in Tampa, Florida. He signed to play baseball with the Kansas City Athletics (or \u201cA\u2019s\u201d) out of high school. Though he spent the majority of his 16-season playing career in the minor leagues, he appeared sporadically in the majors with the A\u2019s (both in Kansas City and, later, in Oakland, where the franchise moved), the Atlanta Braves, and the Chicago Cubs. He was named the manager of a minor-league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox in 1978, and his first big-league managerial job came the following year, when he took over the White Sox late in the 1979 season.\n\nIn 1983 La Russa guided the White Sox to a 99-win season and the team\u2019s first play-off appearance in 24 years. However, a slow start to the 1986 campaign led to La Russa\u2019s being fired three months into the season. He was out of work for less than a month before he was hired to manage the A\u2019s. He quickly turned the A\u2019s into the most dominant team in baseball. He led Oakland to the highest win total in the major leagues for three straight seasons (1988\u201390), each of which also ended with the Athletics\u2019 winning the American League (AL) pennant. The team was upset in two of its World Series appearances during this period, but the A\u2019s did defeat the San Francisco Giants to win a championship in 1989. La Russa and the A\u2019s won another division title in 1992, but after the team posted three consecutive losing seasons (1993\u201395), he opted out of his contract and signed with the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nLa Russa\u2019s third managerial stint was even more successful than his first two. In his initial season in St. Louis, he guided the Cardinals to the first of seven division titles the team would win during his tenure. The Cardinals won a National League (NL) pennant in 2004, and in 2006 the team beat the Detroit Tigers to win the World Series. In 2011 La Russa again led St. Louis to the World Series title. He retired soon after earning his third championship ring. He was named the AL\u2019s Manager of the Year three times (1983, 1988, and 1992) and won the NL\u2019s version of the award in 2002. In 2013 he was selected for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame."}, {"url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/tony-larussa-named-as-white-sox-manager/", "page_content": "CHICAGO (CBS) -- The White Sox are betting their future on their past, naming Tony La Russa as the team's new manager.\n\nThe last time around, you would have seen Johnny Morris reporting on La Russa's White Sox for the evening news on CBS 2 after their games at old Comiskey Park. Now they'll be playing at Guaranteed Rate Field as the Sox have for the past 29 years, and CBS 2's Matt Zahn reported on the new edition of La Russa's White Sox on Thursday.\n\nLa Russa, 76, was last at the helm of the White Sox 34 years ago. Even though there had been rumblings in the past few weeks, it was still pretty stunning to see him announced as the new Sox manager.\n\nIt has been almost a decade since La Russa has managed in Major League Baseball at all; he last managed the St. Louis Cardinals in 2011, when they won the World Series. He has had front-office roles since and does not have recent managerial experience, which does not seem to line up with what White Sox general manager/senior vice president Rick Hahn said the team was looking for just three weeks ago.\n\n\"Quite frankly, as we talked a couple, three weeks ago when we initiated this process, this obviously played out a little differently than I described I thought it would for all of you,\" Hahn said. \"Initially, I think I was a little surprised, just given that I knew not only, obviously, that he was retired, but I knew that other clubs had reached out previously and were rebuffed.\"\n\nAccording to the team, La Russa signed a multiyear contract with the White Sox.\n\n\"My internal response has been excitement. I haven't had the first regret,\" La Russa said. \"I'm fired up. I'm ready to go. I'm anxious to get with the players. I want to show them what I represent as a person; as a professional.\"\n\nTony La Russa, a member of baseball's Hall of Fame, the third-winningest manager in baseball history, a three-time World Series champion and a four-time winner of the Manager of the Year Award, has been named the new manager of the Chicago White Sox. pic.twitter.com/RKP24rleHP \u2014 Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) October 29, 2020\n\nA news release said \"La Russa and Connie Mack are the only two managers to win World Series titles in three different decades and to win pennants in four decades. La Russa, who was named Manager of the Year in 1983, 1988, 1992, and 2002, is one of only four managers to receive the honor in each league.\"\n\nLa Russa was the manager of the White Sox from 1979 until 1986. The White Sox made one playoff appearance in that era, winning the American League West championship in 1983.\n\nDuring more than 30 seasons as a manager with the White Sox and then with the Oakland Athletics (1986-95) and St. Louis Cardinals (1996-2011), La Russa's teams have made 14 postseason appearances, won 12 division titles, six pennants and claimed three World Series championships (1989 with Oakland; 2006 and '11 with St. Louis.)\n\nLa Russa was fired from his first stint as Sox skipper back in 1986 by then-General Manager Hawk Harrelson. Sox Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf has regretted the move ever since, as La Russa went on to win those three titles elsewhere.\n\nIt was Reinsdorf who reached out to La Russa a few weeks ago to see if he had interest, and many believe this was Reinsdorf's decision to hire him.\n\nLa Russa said this is not about their relationship.\n\n\"His major interest on the baseball side is what's best for the Chicago White Sox and the fans that we're hoping are driving to our ballpark in droves,\" La Russa said. \"Any past relationship or current relationship he's had with me over the years. I mean, there were other opportunities to hire me that wouldn't hire me. I think all managers would understand this \u2013 I think everybody would understand this \u2013 how rare it is to get an opportunity to manage a team that's this talented and this close to winning.\"\n\nThe move to hire La Russa has been almost universally panned by Sox fans and people within baseball. A national report said it even caused conflict within the White Sox organization.\n\nMeanwhile, of course, one of the big questions is how 76-year-old La Russa can related to a mostly young, diverse White Sox team, with most of the players more than 50 years younger than he. La Russa sounds ready to work to bridge that age gap.\n\n\"You start with the respect, trust at zero. You have to work every day to earn it, and I did it for years, and I'm going to try very hard to do it, and the players will decide,\" he said, \"but I know if I come at it with what I've learned, and how I feel about putting that team in a good position to succeed, I think it'll happen.\"\n\nLa Russa has also been opposed in the past to showmanship by players such as backflips, and has also been against protesting during the National Anthem.\n\n\"When the first issue occurred, my initial instincts were all you about, you know, respecting the flag and the anthem and what America stands for. There's been a lot goes on in a very healthy way since 2016. I would applaud and support the fact that they are now addressing; identifying the injustices, especially on the racial side,\" he said.\n\nAs to the way players might express themselves on the field, he added: \"I do believe at the basis that sportsmanship is important. I always reasoned that if it's sincere, I didn't have a problem with it. And what I see now is that with players that are being more exuberant \u2013 and I take Tim Anderson for an example \u2013 if I see that it's sincere and it's directed towards the game, that's displaying the kind of emotion that you want.\"\n\nLa Russa said he has not talked to any of the players yet.\n\nAs a player himself, La Russa appeared in 132 major league games over six seasons with the Kansas City Athletics (1963), Oakland Athletics (1968-71), Atlanta Braves (1971) and Chicago Cubs (1973), batting .199 (35-176) with seven RBI. He retired as a player in 1977.\n\nLa Russa is 2,728-2,365 (.536) in 5,097 games as a manager and has a 70-58 (.547) record in postseason. His 2,728 career wins rank third all-time in the history of baseball, following Mack (3,731) and John McGraw (2,763). His teams have won 100 or more games four times, topped by 105 victories with the 2004 NL-pennant winning Cardinals.\n\nCBS 2's Matt Zahn contributed to this report.\n\nAlso From CBS Chicago:"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/29/sports/baseball/tony-la-russa-white-sox-manager.html", "page_content": "Tony La Russa has a permanent home along the top row of the back wall in the Hall of Fame\u2019s plaque gallery in Cooperstown, N.Y., between Bobby Cox and Frank Thomas.

The first sentence of the text below his image cites his 2,728 victories, the third most for a manager.\n\nThe plaque went up in 2014, and La Russa never expected the numbers to change.

While many were left saddened, it was a decision that was very understandable as the veteran manager cited a pair of health issues as the central motivation for leaving. Sadly, La Russa will walk away from the very same team that gave him his first job in the big leagues, but this time, it will be with a disappointing record after two years at the reigns.\n\nFull screen White Sox manager Tony La Russa announces his retirement due to health concerns, infront of the entire organization on Monday. Kamil Krzaczynski USA TODAY Sports\n\nA three-time World Series champion, La Russa who actually turns 78 on Tuesday, has been absent for the last 34 games having had to leave the team on August 30th to address problems with his pacemaker, which incidentally was implanted in February of this year. It\u2019s worth noting this, because it was apparently during that period that La Russa underwent additional testing for another medical issue that had been previously diagnosed. Ultimately, he took the decision to say goodbye to the game. \u201c...Now however that I\u2019m in the treatment program, it\u2019s become obvious that the length of the treatment and recovery process for the second issue makes it impossible to be the manager in 2023,\u201d La Russa said.\n\nThe Blame Game: Tony La Russa accepts responsibility for White Sox woes\n\nWhen this MLB season got underway, the Chicago White Sox were definitely a team that had their eye on a World Series run. Unfortunately, between constant injuries and inconsistent play, that parade got severely rained on. Speaking in front of essentially the entire organization, including the players themselves, La Russa didn\u2019t shy away from responsibility in anyway. \u201cI understand the ultimate responsibility for each minus this season belongs to the manager,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s accurate, because there\u2019s always something else you could do.

Interestingly, general manager Rick Hahn said Cairo will get an interview for the full-time job, but also indicated that there is a preference for someone outside the organization. \u201cI think we are going to use this opportunity to get different perspectives,\u201d Hahn said.\n\nWhere else has Tony La Russa coached in his career?\n\nWith a 2,900-2,514 record across an incredible 35 years in the league, La Russa has seen success with the Chicago White Sox, as well as the Oakland A\u2019s and the St. Louis Cardinals. La Russa is second only to Connie Mack on baseball\u2019s career wins list, having previously leap frogged John McGraw just last season. Where his world championships are concerned, La Russa clinched World Series titles with Oakland in 1989 and the Cardinals in 2006 and 2011. To that end, he stands alongside only Sparky Anderson as the only managers ever to win the World Series in both the American and National leagues.\n\nScott Servais greets Tony La Russa at home plate.\n\n\n\nHe talked today about remembering the many times he matched up against La Russa and the Cardinals when playing for the Cubs in the 90s.\n\n\n\n\u201cA Hall of Fame manager who\u2019s had a ton of success.\u201d pic.twitter.com/xn7DBj6Mh5 \u2014 Daniel Kramer (@DKramer_) April 6, 2021\n\nYet, it must be said that La Russa\u2019s name will likely always evoke images of the White Sox first before any other team when thinking of him. First hired by the franchise at 34, La Russa was promoted from Triple-A to replace Don Kessinger who had just been fired by the White Sox during the season of 1979. Once appointed, the former infielder would go on to lead the White Sox to a 522-510 record across eight seasons as their manager. Despite leading the White Sox to their first playoff appearance since 1959, during a 1983 run that saw them win 99 games enroute to an AL West Championship, La Russa was fired by then GM Ken Harrelson following a 26-38 start to the season.

The manager guided the Cardinals to the championship despite being 10 1/2 games behind Atlanta on Aug. 25 for the final playoff spot in the National League.\n\nLa Russa retires third on the all-time wins list, 35 behind second-place John McGraw.

In late August he told general manager John Mozeliak and other team officials.\n\nLa Russa said the timing of those discussions \u0097 about the time the Cardinals appeared to be out of wild card contention before their miraculous run \u0097 was pure coincidence. He said he simply felt it was time to go, a feeling that didn't change even as the Cardinals squeaked into the playoffs on the final day of the season, then upset the Phillies, Brewers and Rangers.\n\n\"Comeback Kid\" Cards win World Series\n\nHe spoke with little emotion at the news conference with one exception, when he paused to compose himself as he thanked his wife, Elaine, and two daughters for putting up without him over much of the past 33 years. But he did say his meeting with players after Sunday's parade and celebration was short but emotional.\n\n\"Some grown men cried,\" La Russa said, then he joked, \"I kind of liked that because they made me cry a few times.\"\n\nMozeliak said work is under way to find a new manager for the first time since La Russa was hired prior to the 1996 season. A search committee will be formed. Mozeliak did not speculate on how long the process might take.\n\nLa Russa answered flatly, \"No,\" when asked if he'll ever manage again. He also said he had no plans to be a general manager, but said he is open to some sort of baseball job in the future.\n\n\"Maybe open a book store,\" he said.\n\nChris Carpenter, who won four times in the postseason, including the decisive Game 7, said La Russa gathered the team together in the weight room moments after Sunday's celebration at the stadium, along with Mozeliak and principal owner Bill DeWitt Jr..\n\nHe spoke about how proud he was of the team's championship run, \"and then he said that he was done,\" Carpenter said. \"Everybody was surprised, shocked. I think every single guy in there was emotional and gave big old hugs on the way out.\"\n\nCarpenter said the behind-the-scenes La Russa is different than the public persona \u0097 including a great sense of humor. But he lauded La Russa for always having his team play at its highest possible level.\n\n\"I'm not sure there are a lot of people that can match the preparation, the dedication and the ability to put it all together,\" he said.\n\nMozeliak said the team will have a \"long list\" of candidates for a job that will likely be considered among the best in baseball given the strong returning team \u0097 whether or not Albert Pujols decides to come back \u0097 and based on the strong fan support in St. Louis.\n\n\"There's going to be a lot of names that we'll consider,\" Mozeliak said. \"We want to do our due diligence. We want to be smart.\"\n\nDeWitt said replacing La Russa will be a tall task.\n\n\"We're not going to find a Tony La Russa out there, given his career and what he's accomplished, what he's meant to the Cardinals,\" DeWitt said. \"We're in a pretty good situation for the future. But it'll be different, no question about it.\"\n\nLa Russa's decision leaves the future of his coaching staff up in the air. Mozeliak said the new manager will be given autonomy to hire his own staff or retain some or all of La Russa's. Asked about pitching coach Dave Duncan, La Russa's longtime right-hand man, Mozeliak did note that Duncan is under contract for 2012.\n\nAs for Pujols, Mozeliak noted that he has a strong relationship with the only manager he's ever played for, but doubted it would be a factor in whether the free agent first baseman stays.\n\n\"He probably understood that Tony is not going to manage forever,\" Mozeliak said.\n\nLa Russa was a .199 hitter in a brief major league career. He began as a manager with the Chicago White Sox in 1979. He guided the Oakland A's to three straight American League pennants in 1988-1990 and the 1989 World Series title over the Giants.\n\nLa Russa was hired by the Cardinals in October 1995, soon after the new ownership group purchased the team from Anheuser-Busch. His impact was immediate \u0097 the Cardinals won the NL Central and came within a game of going to the World Series in 1996, losing to the Atlanta Braves.\n\nOverall, St. Louis went to the playoffs nine times in La Russa's 16 seasons, won pennants in 2004, 2006 and this year, and won two championships, over Detroit in 2006 and this season, rallying to win the final two games over Texas, including the memorable Game 6 when the Cardinals trailed five times and were down to their last strike in two innings. His teams were successful on the field and in the stands \u0097 the Cardinals drew 3 million fans in 13 of La Russa's 16 seasons.\n\nLa Russa, who won 2,728 regular-season games, including 1,408 with the Cardinals, said he never considered coming back simply to reach No. 2 on the all-time wins list.\n\n\"I'm aware of the history of the game, but I would not be happy with myself if the reason I came back was to move up one spot,\" La Russa said.\n\nWashington Nationals manager Davey Johnson said La Russa picked the right time to leave.\n\n\"I tip my hat to him. He's had a great career. What a way to go out,\" said Johnson, who at 68 is a year older than La Russa. \"If you're going to retire, that's the way to go out; a world champion.\"\n\nAs CBSSports.com's Matt Snyder notes, this year there was something different about La Russa, who seemed to enjoy himself at press conferences more than he ever had before\n\n\"It was like La Russa was at peace with knowing he had accomplished everything he could have ever dreamed of accomplishing as skipper and was just enjoying one final ride,\" Snyder writes."}, {"url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/09/tony-la-russa-great-manager-terrible-memoirist/262836/", "page_content": "The man who led the St. Louis Cardinals to a World Series championship last season knows baseball\u2014but not how to write about it.\n\nAP Images\n\nAs longtime season-ticket holders for the St. Louis Cardinals, my father and I spent unseemly portions of the past 15 years bickering from our seats along the first-base line about Tony La Russa's unorthodox managerial style. As a La Russa skeptic, I continually second-guessed the manager's incessant lineup tinkering. My father, ever the optimist, assured me that his in-game moves were all grounded in meticulous preparation and statistical analysis. Nearly every game we circled back to the same conversations:\n\nMe: How come La Russa is the only manager to bat the pitcher eighth?\n\nMy father: He must've calculated that the eighth-place batter is more likely to come up in sacrifice situations.\n\nMe: Why is La Russa bringing in his third relief pitcher this inning?\n\nMy father: The matchups must favor it.\n\nAfter La Russa guided the Cardinals to an improbable World Series championship last year, I grudgingly surrendered to my father's point of view. Despite La Russa's maddening tendency to over-manage, his intensity and creative decision-making had set the tone for that team's never-say-die attitude. Down ten-and-a-half games in late August, the Cardinals tallied a 23-9 record down the stretch, clinching the National League wild card on the last day of the season. After vanquishing the heavily favored Philadelphia Phillies and Milwaukee Brewers, the Cardinals found themselves down to their last strike twice in Game 6 of the World Series before rallying back both times to tie the score, eventually triumphing on a walk-off homerun by third baseman David Freese. Right through the World Series-clinching out, La Russa remained perched in his usual spot at the far end of the dugout, alone and clench-jawed, his mind almost visibly whirring through a series of moves and countermoves, anything to give his team the advantage.\n\nIt was La Russa's glowering countenance that spurred the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Buzz Bissinger to shadow the Cardinals for the 2003 season, which resulted in his bestselling book, Three Nights in August. According to Bissinger, the opportunity to understand baseball \"through the mind of La Russa\u2014to excavate deep into the game and try to capture the odd and lonely corner of the dugout that he and all managers occupy by virtue of the natural isolation of their craft\u2014was simply too good to pass up.\" It was too good to pass up for the syndicated conservative columnist George F. Will as well, who characterized La Russa as a managerial mastermind in his 1990 book, Men at Work.\n\nIt's easy to understand why serious writers are drawn to La Russa. Since being plucked from obscurity to lead the Chicago White Sox in 1979 after a sub-mediocre playing career (lifetime batting average: .199), La Russa went on to manage for 33 consecutive seasons, an unprecedented feat in an era in which \" baseball manager\" and \"job security\" are mutually exclusive terms. The accolades speak for themselves: four Manager of the Year Awards, three World Series championships, and the third highest win total in MLB history. But his most lasting contributions grew out of his relentless futzing with the bullpen and bench. Under La Russa, the team's closer became chiefly a ninth-inning stopper, an innovation now practiced universally around the league. He also scrutinized hitter-pitcher matchups, pulling relief pitchers after one batter or benching starters in favor of utility players who had had found success in the past against an opposing pitcher. It was as if La Russa believed that there was always something more he could be doing to help his team eke out the extra victories needed to propel them into the playoffs.\n\nAfter retiring last November, mere weeks after winning the championship, La Russa returned to his home in the San Francisco Bay area, where he resumed work at his animal rescue foundation and started writing a memoir with the St. Louis-based sportswriter Rick Hummell. I anticipated La Russa's book more than the 2012 Cardinals season, eagerly awaiting an unfiltered glimpse into baseball's foremost tactical mind. Besides, without La Russa's in-game meddling, my father and I found little to argue about this baseball season while broiling in the Midwestern summer humidity.\n\nSo how is it that the most persistent question that ran through my mind when I finally read One Last Strike: Fifty Years in Baseball, Ten and a Half Games Back, and One Final Championship Season was: If Tony La Russa is such a genius, then why is his memoir so shallow?\n\nLike most sports memoirs, La Russa's brims with the clich\u00e9s that have come to define athlete-speak. La Russa preaches \"the edge of not giving in, making excuses, or giving up\"; posits that \"the key to beating any outstanding starter is to have every hitter go to war from start to finish\"; and asserts that mental toughness \"is something [players] can acquire. If they decide to make something important, then they can make it happen.\" As David Foster Wallace notes in his essay \"How Tracy Austin Broke My Heart,\" robotic banality is a staple in athlete autobiographies, but it's especially disappointing coming from La Russa, who might be expected to transcend the conventions of the genre.\n\nIf anything, what La Russa's memoir underscores is how integral clich\u00e9s are to the practice of being a major-league manager. La Russa knows that axioms such as \"keep on believing\" and \"no regrets\" help keep 20- and 30-something multimillionaires motivated over the course of baseball's long season. In a telling anecdote, La Russa recounts how, in his first speech after taking over as manager of the Cardinals in 1996, he droned on for 45 minutes, testing the patience of the players and coaching staff alike. He partly blames that detail-laden speech for the team's sluggish start that season.\n\nWhile stirring platitudes can inspire professional athletes during pre-game pep talks, they come across on the page as trite and obfuscating. It's jarring, for example, when La Russa sums up the Cardinals' championship season with language seemingly pulled from a third-rate self-help guide: \"Just because you're down to your last strike, you're not out yet. You can always do more. You'll always have more at-bats to take. That's true in baseball, in rescuing animals, and in life generally.\"\n\nMore problematic than La Russa's reliance on clich\u00e9s is his inability to humanize the ballplayers he manages. Despite La Russa's insistence that the most important duty of a baseball manager is to \"understand and relate to the diverse personalities of the players,\" the individual Cardinals remain almost indistinguishable throughout the memoir\u2014an interchangeable collection of gritty gamers and hard-nosed competitors differentiated primarily by the positions they play. Here's a sampling of player descriptions:\n\nOn starting pitcher Adam Wainwright: \"Adam is a great guy, a devout family man, and a real competitor.\"\n\nOn backup catcher Gerald Laird: \"Gerald Laird, a catcher, was another guy with a terrific sense of humor and a real passion for and knowledge of the game.\"\n\nOn infielder Skip Schumaker: \"Skip Schumaker, our second baseman, was as tough as nails and always worked his tail off.\"\n\nOn infielder Ryan Theriot: \"Ryan Theriot was another gamer, a gritty player with a championship pedigree.\"\n\nOn outfielder Jon Jay: \"Jay is a major leaguer. Of Cuban extraction, he was born in Miami, and he loves to play the game. He runs well and gets to a lot of balls hit his way.\"\n\nSuch descriptions are superficial partly because La Russa refuses to breach the sanctified space of the Cardinals' clubhouse. Few revealing anecdotes about the players are related, and conflicts are either intimated or dismissed altogether. When veteran players from the underachieving 2010 squad suggested that there had been problems with team unity that year, La Russa neglects to expand on what those problems entailed and who was involved. Even La Russa's well-documented clashes with Colby Rasmus, a talented yet disgruntled centerfielder who was shipped to the Toronto Blue Jays midway through the 2011 season, are merely hinted at through ambiguous phrases such as the importance of \"accepting personal responsibility.\" The only Cardinal whom La Russa openly criticizes is Ozzie Smith, the Hall-of-Fame shortstop who grew estranged from the organization after La Russa benched him in 1996. Their relationship was already too frayed for La Russa to worry about discretion.\n\nOn a certain level, however, La Russa's inability or unwillingness to flesh out his players is symptomatic of his professional mindset. As a manager, La Russa thinks in terms of strategy, not narrative. He has little time for clubhouse gossip, rally squirrels, or even personal histories that don't directly impact players' performances. His concerns are primarily tactical: which players hit left-handed pitching, which respond well to criticism, which can be trusted in close games. He's interested not in conveying who a player is, but in determining what he might do in a given situation.\n\nSince nearly half of the book consists of a blow-by-blow recap of last year's playoffs, La Russa has ample space to explain the rationale behind his many lineup decisions. In perhaps the closest approximation to his strategic thought-process, La Russa painstakingly explains the logic behind nearly every double-switch, hit-and-run, and late-inning situational matchup that he instigated during the playoffs. After a while, though, these excessive details start to feel overwhelming. I yearned for a more expansive perspective that would move beyond La Russa's lonely dugout perch, for actual player conversations and behind-the-scenes glimpses of the team's internal dynamics. La Russa's mind, it turns out, is a rather cramped place to dwell.\n\nAt the very least, La Russa's memoir offers my father and me something new to argue about in the Cardinals' post-La Russa era. I look forward to the team's opening home stand next season, when we take our usual seats in Busch Stadium and engage in one final back-and-forth on our preferred topic. I imagine it going something like this:\n\nMe: Why was La Russa's memoir so tedious?\n\nMy father: He must've figured that it was the truest expression of how he approached the game, for better or worse."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/sports/baseball/tony-la-russa-white-sox.html", "page_content": "Hallowed names caromed off the walls of the coaches' room one recent morning at the Chicago White Sox\u2019 camp in Glendale, Ariz. The former slugger Jim Thome was in town, and as coaches prepared the day\u2019s schedule, Thome rattled off a list of the greatest players ever managed by a fellow Hall of Famer, Tony La Russa.\n\nThome is a special assistant for the White Sox now, but La Russa is much more than an adviser. At 76 years old, he is back as manager of the team that fired him in 1986, before any players on the current 40-man roster were born.\n\nLa Russa has managed boldface names like Tom Seaver and Carlton Fisk, Rickey Henderson and Dennis Eckersley, Mark McGwire and Albert Pujols. Yet as Thome recited them, La Russa and the coaches came to a tantalizing conclusion: The players down the hall just might fit with the best of his best.\n\n\u201cThose lineups compare to anybody\u2019s, ever,\u201d La Russa said by phone last week. \u201cSo I think what\u2019s exciting here is that when we put our talent, the depth of our talent, alongside those, you can see why the opportunity is real.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/30220736/why-tony-la-russa-sincerely-curious-choice-white-sox-manager", "page_content": "In November 2014, six months after the Arizona Diamondbacks named Hall of Fame manager Tony La Russa their chief baseball officer, the organization announced that it had hired Dr. Ed Lewis as its first director of baseball analytics and research. His experience in the field was nonexistent. His doctorate was in veterinary medicine. Lewis came to the Diamondbacks because he possessed a quality far more important than developing algorithms or building models: For 35 years, he had been Tony La Russa's friend.\n\nThe hiring of Lewis prompted snickers around the game. At the time La Russa was stripped of power three years into the job, the Diamondbacks had gone 212-274. His handpicked GM, old friend Dave Stewart, had been fired. Lewis was replaced.\n\nCronyism in the game is as old as the spitball, and an inner circle of powerful men -- they're all men -- has spent decades in the game fomenting it. When they want something, they tend to get it.\n\nJerry Reinsdorf, the Chicago White Sox's owner for nearly 40 years, said he regretted trading Harold Baines because had he not, Baines would have reached 3,000 hits. He finished his career with 2,866, and his other numbers were well shy of Hall of Fame standards. So Reinsdorf found himself a place on a Hall committee voting on a special ballot with Baines-era players, argued vehemently on Baines' behalf and rammed him through to Cooperstown. One of the other 11 votes came from Tony La Russa.\n\nThis is how it works. And this is how perhaps the most inexplicable news of the offseason unfolded at its outset Thursday: La Russa, now 76 years old, out of the dugout for the last nine, was named manager of the White Sox. He inherits a team brimming with young, dynamic talent -- a team that, in many ways, represents a new epoch of baseball whose principles and priorities run antithetical to La Russa's.\n\nThere was no more desirable job available this offseason than the White Sox's -- not even the big-market, big-money Boston Red Sox's. The White Sox are a ready-made contender, a playoff team that fired its manager, Rick Renteria, with the publicly stated intention of taking a step forward via a replacement with recent championship experience. The opportunity was undeniable. The last time a playoff team fired a manager immediately after its season ended was in 2017, when Boston got rid of John Farrell and Washington Dusty Baker. The next year, under Alex Cora, the Red Sox won the World Series. The year after that, Davey Martinez helmed the Nationals to a championship.\n\nTony La Russa got the White Sox's job this week because of another crony hire. In 1986, Reinsdorf moved Ken \"Hawk\" Harrelson, a former player, from the broadcast booth to the front office. General manager Roland Hemond was demoted and left. Harrelson dismissed a 29-year-old executive named Dave Dombrowski. And he purged the manager too.\n\nLetting Harrelson fire La Russa, Reinsdorf said, was his greatest regret, even more than what happened to Harold Baines. And at 84 years old, given a chance to remedy that mistake, Reinsdorf wasted no time.\n\nThe White Sox recently contacted A.J. Hinch, the former Houston Astros manager, to determine his interest in their open managing job, league sources told ESPN. Hinch said the job very much appealed to him, according to sources. There was only one snag, which had become apparent inside the organization in recent days: Once La Russa expressed a desire to manage again, nobody else had a chance.\n\nThe White Sox's announcement finally came Thursday -- at the same time Hinch was interviewing with the Detroit Tigers, Chicago's American League Central rivals. Now, sources say, Hinch is on the verge of agreeing to a deal to manage the Tigers, an up-and-coming team that expects to challenge the White Sox sooner than later.\n\nHinch, 46, was connected to the Chicago job immediately after Renteria's firing. He had won a World Series with the Astros in 2017 and gone to another in 2019 before being fired in the wake of the team's sign-stealing scandal. Hinch's reputation in most quarters emerged unscathed, and his experience helping mold a young core into a championship-caliber group was almost too perfect a fit for a White Sox team that folded down the stretch of the shortened 2020 season and bowed out in the first round of the playoffs. It was so good, in fact, that the email the White Sox sent out to fans celebrating La Russa's hire ... included an image of Hinch's signature.\n\nIt was like the White Sox were trolling their own fans. (They blamed the snafu on a graphics glitch.) The job opening gave the club a perfect opportunity to acquaint itself with young, talented, diverse candidates to run a team that includes Cuban (Luis Robert, Jose Abreu, Yoan Moncada, Yasmani Grandal), Black (Tim Anderson) and Dominican (Eloy Jimenez) stars. Other teams have capitalized on the opportunity to do the same. Of the dozen who reportedly have interviewed for the Tigers job, five are Black, five white and two Latino. They range in age from 38 to 61. Boston has interviewed at least seven candidates: three white, two Black and two Latino.\n\nInside MLB's Ivy League culture Baseball's front offices have embraced analytics in the 21st century. Diversity? Not so much. Joon Lee \u00bb\n\nWhite Sox officials said they interviewed candidates other than La Russa, but USA Today named just one other: Willie Harris, the longtime White Sox utilityman, who is Black. With the makeup of its clubhouse, front office (Ken Williams, who is Black, serves as executive vice president) and the prior hiring of Renteria, the White Sox have been far more progressive than other teams when it comes to hiring minorities. It was jarring nevertheless to see Reinsdorf essentially flout the Selig Rule, named after his longtime collaborator and former commissioner Bud Selig, which calls for teams to interview minority candidates for high-level positions.\n\nNobody was going to come in and blow Reinsdorf away. His mind was made up, even as others balked. Players as well as rank-and-file employees told ESPN they were dumbfounded. Sure, they all respect La Russa's managing acumen. His accomplishments -- 2,728 wins, six World Series appearances, three titles -- speak for themselves.\n\nSo do his words. And that's what the players and employees were having trouble getting past.\n\nManaging a team in 2020 is, despite the perception that front offices write lineup cards and serve as puppet masters, perhaps the most trying day-to-day job in baseball. The best managers are polymaths: strategist, public-relations specialist, politician, therapist, mathematician, motivational speaker, innovator. The crusty manager who cared about baseball, baseball and baseball and gave not a moment of his time to much else is an anachronism. Or maybe was.\n\nBefore he spent even an hour as White Sox manager for the second time, La Russa addressed the intersection of his present and past. Four years ago, when Colin Kaepernick first took a knee to protest police brutality against Black people, La Russa unleashed a screed to Sports Illustrated about how his protest disrespected the constitution, the soldiers, the country, the American flag.\n\n\"I really question the sincerity of somebody like Kaepernick,\" La Russa said.\n\nIn the years since, the protests that once were limited to the NFL have spread to baseball. On Opening Day this year, Anderson, Abreu, Robert, Jimenez and star pitcher Lucas Giolito were among the eight uniformed White Sox personnel who knelt during the national anthem. Even more radical a change since La Russa's last game managing, a World Series-clinching victory with St. Louis in 2011, is the style of on-field play. The bat flips -- Anderson is among the best -- and the displays of emotion. The embrace, for the most part, of the \"Let the Kids Play\" ethos MLB marketed. That is these White Sox. That is their identity. And considering La Russa pooh-poohed Fernando Tatis Jr.'s grand slam on a 3-0 pitch this summer in an interview with The Washington Post, it was fair to ask how, exactly, he would police his team.\n\n\"If it's sincere, I didn't have a problem with it,\" La Russa said.\n\nIf it's sincere.\n\nThe rise of Fernando Tatis Jr. Since he was a child, Fernando Tatis Jr. has lived to play. This year, the game needs him just as much as he needs it. Jeff Passan \u00bb\n\n\"What I see now is that with players that are being more exuberant -- I take Tim Anderson for an example -- now it's people showing that, hey, I'm coming through,\" said La Russa, who in Oakland managed the homer-pimping Rickey Henderson and forearm-smashing Bash Brothers. \"In fact, Major League Baseball is encouraging them to do so. And if I see that it's sincere and directed toward the game, that's displaying the kind of emotion you want.\"\n\nIf I see that it's sincere.\n\n\"If your team celebrates and their team celebrates,\" La Russa said, \"neither team can be upset when you see celebrations, as long as everyone's doing it sincerely.\"\n\nAs long as everyone's doing it sincerely.\n\nLa Russa couldn't help himself. He kept retreating to that crutch, the same one he had used four years earlier, when he attacked Kaepernick's motives with falsehood-filled broadsides.\n\nSincere. Sincerely. Sincerity. All the same concept, the idea that whatever is under La Russa's microscope -- be it a protest or a bat flip -- is fine as long as it comes from a noble, honest, real place. Except that this nobility, this honesty, this reality -- it is not objective. It can't be. What's sincere to one man may be insincere to another, and when that was pointed out to La Russa, he fell back on that same tired philosophy -- when he sees it, he knows it -- the sort of incurious hubris that would lead someone to hire a veterinarian who flexed his math muscles stock-picking for a data science job.\n\n\"I evaluate players' commitment to our team,\" La Russa said. \"And based on watching them closely, you can detect the sincerity of when they say 'I'm all-in for helping the team,' and then you look around and see that they are not all-in. So I think you look at actions.\n\n\"Words are words. I would look at actions, and what I'm seeing, one of the reasons I'm so encouraged by what I've seen the last bunch of years, is how players are backing up their words with actions.\"\n\nHe's right. Words are words. And it was particularly interesting to hear him revisit his about Kaepernick from four years ago.\n\n\"I know in 2016, when the first issue occurred, my initial instincts were all about respecting the flag and the anthem and what America stands for,\" La Russa said Thursday.\n\n\"There's been a lot that's gone on in a very healthy way since 2016. Not only do I respect but I applaud the awareness that's come into not just society but especially in sports. If you talk about specifically baseball, I applaud and would support the fact they are now addressing [and] identifying the injustices, especially on the racial side. And as long as it's peacefully protested and sincere ... I'm all for it.\"\n\nThe Black experience in MLB Players, managers and the one major leaguer who took a knee share their experiences of race issues inside the game and out. Story \u00bb\n\nBryant: The exile of Bruce Maxwell \u00bb\n\nThere it was again. Sincere, as if sincerity is more important than injustice, as if one need exist to validate the other, as if his opinion means any more than Tim Anderson's or Jose Abreu's or Lucas Giolito's or anyone else's. As if he's got the monopoly on sincerity.\n\nIn fact, go back not four years ago but nine months ago to when La Russa told Graham Bensinger in an interview: \"I was so upset when the kneel-down [sic] in the NFL. It's not that you don't have something that you dislike. There's a different way to protest it. When you kneel down, you disrespect the flag, the country and the anthem. Men and women are fighting and dying for that. It's the wrong way to protest.\"\n\nMaybe George Floyd changed things for La Russa. Maybe it was something else. Or maybe it's fair to wonder whether someone who just got hired for a job that needs him to be a politician and a public-relations specialist was just saying what he had to say and not necessarily being sincere. What a shame that would be.\n\nIt is very possible that Tony La Russa is a smashing success as White Sox manager. For all the consternation about the hire, which even La Russa acknowledged in a tweet Thursday night, the White Sox are an extremely talented team, and La Russa is a historically competent manager. His hiring neither dooms nor damns Chicago. What so deeply frustrated White Sox fans was the rationale behind it, the process behind it and the unfortunate commonality that ties them together.\n\nNobody, in fact, put it better than La Russa: \"How rare is it to get an opportunity to manage a team that's this talented and this close to winning?\"\n\nWay-too-early 2021 MLB Power Rankings No, we haven't a clue how baseball's offseason will play out. We're ranking all 30 teams anyway.\n\nWay-too-early Power Rankings \u00bb\n\nWay-too-early MLB awards picks \u00bb\n\nExtraordinarily, especially a team that general manager Rick Hahn so expertly put together -- one with Anderson, Robert, Moncada and Jimenez all signed to long-term deals, with a core that for the next half-decade should at very least keep the White Sox in contention and at best compete for multiple championships. That kind of team, the logic goes, should have the kind of manager who will grow with it, a manager chosen not by an owner trying to right an almost-four-decades-old wrong but by the GM and staff that put the team together in the first place. That is how functional organizations work. The baseball people make the baseball decisions. The owners let them.\n\nThis isn't about age. It's more a question of execution. Joe Maddon, 66, has managed winners in 11 of the past 14 years, so that's what the Los Angeles Angels hired him to do. The Astros needed a reputation rehabilitation, and few know how to charm the media and public like Dusty Baker, 71. What is La Russa today? More Jack McKeon or Bobby Valentine? Joe Gibbs or Dick Vermeil? Is he still a brilliant tactician -- clearly better than all those people who weren't interviewed because cronyism-gone-wrong, which at this point might as well be in the fossil record, necessitates some recompense?\n\nEither Reinsdorf didn't recognize there would be widespread opposition internally as well as externally to handing over the Corvette they'd built to someone who hadn't gotten behind the wheel in a decade -- or he didn't care. The former would be sad. The latter would be infuriating.\n\nEspecially because in the interview nine months ago, Bensinger asked Reinsdorf whether La Russa would ever manage again, and Reinsdorf said: \"Managing, it just takes an awful lot out of you. There's nothing else for him to accomplish. He's won three World Series. He's in the Hall of Fame. There's no reason to go back to managing and have to try to deal with people who are 22 years old when you're 75 years old.\"\n\nClearly there was a reason, because here was Tony La Russa, Chicago White Sox manager (1979-1986, 2021- ). He wanted something, and Jerry Reinsdorf gave it to him, like they always do. Now we'll see just how sincere he was about making the most of it."}, {"url": "https://commencement-archive.wustl.edu/people/tony-la-russa/", "page_content": "Tony La Russa, Baseball Hall of Fame manager, was selected to give the 153rd Commencement address at Washington University in St. Louis in 2014 and received an honorary doctor of humanities degree.\n\nMaking baseball history\n\nTony La Russa recently was unanimously elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame and is considered one of the best managers in baseball history.
