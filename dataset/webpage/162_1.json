(@83_87_89_91_01) January 23, 2022\n\nLate developing rumors have Bryan McClendon being considered for the WR coaching position at his Alma Mater, the University of Georgia.\n\nMiami Co-OC/WR\u2019s Coach Bryan McClendon has emerged as the leading candidate to be the new WR\u2019s Coach at Georgia according to multiple sources.\n\n\n\nA former UGA receiver, McClendon coached under Mark Richt in Athens from 2007-2015 \u2014 Graham Coffey (@DawgOutWest) January 26, 2022\n\nWhether he stays or goes, I wanted to provide you with a look into his mind as he expressed it to some of the nations top recruits at Miami\u2019s Elite Prospect camp.\n\nMcClendon, who grew up in Georgia and played at the University of Georgia, went on to play with for Chicago Bears until sustaining an injury requiring three surgeries on his knee.\n\nHe told recruits that after the second surgery he got into coaching at the University of Georgia for nine years. He said he left UGA to coach at the University of South Carolina as the offensive coordinator and receivers coach for four years, and then he moved on to coach at Oregon for two seasons under Mario Cristobal. He followed Cristobal to Miami last month, and he shared film from a bunch of the guys that he\u2019s recruited and coached along the way including AJ Green and Deebo Samuels.\n\nMcClendon listed 6 Critical Factors for the receiver\u2019s he recruits and they are as follows:\n\n1. Catch the ball (consistently and contested)\n\n2. Dominate at the line of scrimmage\n\n3. Separate and get open at a high level\n\n4. Dangerous with the ball\n\n5. Understand coverage/defenders\n\n6. Turn big plays into touchdowns\n\nMcClendon touched on the measurables he looks at when recruiting a wide receiver and said this:\n\n\u201cWhat I look at when I\u2019m teaching my guys this right here man if you can master these things right now this is what every great wide receiver does at a high level\u2026 not every now and then\u2026 so when you\u2019re talking about catching the football it\u2019s pretty simple, but it\u2019s not it\u2019s not always done at a high level, ok? So catching the ball consistently and making contested catches, if I can do those two things I\u2019m always open\u2026 Doing those two things right now are what we work on on a day to day basis and that\u2019s not negotiable\u2026 not one of those said man you gotta be 6\u20194 220 pounds running 4.3 ok\u2026? alright... so again not one of those say man hey man I gotta work on cone drills over and over\u2026 none of that says that.\u201d\n\nWhen discussing his approach further with the Quarterbacks and Wide Receivers he stated:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s throwing you the ball for you to catch it\u2026 one of the biggest things that you could get me upset with you as being your coach is coming to the sideline and saying hey I didn\u2019t catch the ball \u2018cause it was a bad ball, or I didn\u2019t catch the ball because it was pass interference\u2026 We play the game like there\u2019s no such thing as pass interference, so you come to the sideline telling me I didn\u2019t catch it \u2018cause he grabbed me you\u2019re not going back in the game, Ok?!? Alright\u2026\u201d\n\nHe went on to discuss the need for his receivers to be able to catch the ball under duress\u2026\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one thing man right now\u2026 #1 if you can\u2019t catch the football you\u2019re playing the wrong spot\u2026 go to the DB room... I ain't got no problem with that\u2026 I don\u2019t care how fast or how big you are man if you can consistently make contested catches you\u2019ll do good\u201d\n\nMcClendon moved on to the next items on his list by saying:\n\n\u201c#2 and #3 go together... you want dominating at the line of scrimmage and #3 right now being able to separate and get open at a high level. They gotta be able to do that right now at a high level\u2026 that is a must\u2026 if you can\u2019t do that it\u2019s gonna be hard for you to play ok\u2026? alright...\n\n#4 being dangerous with the ball in my hand and I say this over and over again man catching the ball is not enough, alright? Being able to score and do something after I have the ball in my hand consistently, not every now and then.\u201d\n\n#5 Understanding coverages and defenses is a must\u2026 you gotta be able to know and understand defense... ain\u2019t too many routes in the NFL or college where you run a route regardless of the coverage or the leverage... you have to read and react. If its outside leverage and its 2 high, then I got this route... if its inside leverage with 2 high then its this route... its always readings to it... Dumb guys cant play wide receiver...\n\n#6 Turning big plays into touchdowns and that\u2019s a lot more than just catching a post and running in... on a run play or if the ball is thrown to the perimeter you have to be willing to block so your teammate can make it into the end zone... so right now man those are the critical factors right now that I feel like makes up a great receiver... being able to make plays once you have the ball in your hand... catching the ball is not enough... hey, catching the ball is not enough... so I never want to just sit up here and say coach I caught it\u2026 So what??? I mean what are you doing after the catch??? OK... what are you doing after the catch... \u2018cause if all you\u2019re gonna do right now is try to catch the ball then maybe you playing in the wrong spot...\n\nHe shared several examples of the points as he went over film from past players to help identify what that looks like for the recruits and in one portion of the presentation he stated:\n\n\u201cThe only thing I wanna see when that ball is thrown at you is where you focusing on the point of the ball\u2026 focus on the point of the ball right here man the same thing catching that ball and then standing up and then doing something after the catch, Ok? That\u2019s what makes guys different... a lot of people can go out there and catch this ball... that doesn\u2019t make you different, right? And that\u2019s not bad, it just means you need to go do something else... again I just wanna make sure that everybody understands that.\u201d\n\nOn how he expects his receivers to practice:\n\n\u201cNo matter what, in practice we\u2019re gonna finish ten yards past the deepest defender\u2026 every time we catch we finishing 10 yards past the deepest defenders\u2026 the only way to get better at trying to score is to score in practice\u2026 going out there and doing it over and over again... I\u2019ve been really really blessed to coach and recruit a bunch of really good players OK alright a bunch of them\u2026 I wanna make sure that you understand to play for me, or to play for coach Cristobal, understand this\u2026 We\u2019re gonna push you just as hard off the field as you will get pushed on the field, OK? Because this is a direct reflection of each other\u2026 a direct reflection of each other\u2026 so if this hard for you to do\u2026 if its hard for you to pay attention to me and everything else this is probably not for you\u2026 OK?\n\nAs McClendon closed out his presentation, he left the recruits with wise words:\n\n\u201cThe last thing I want to make sure that I say is this\u2026 there is nobody responsible for your success other than you\u2026 I don\u2019t want to hear oh man this guy ain\u2019t getting me the ball or man we running these type of plays and everything else\u2026 it\u2019s about what you do with your gift\u2026with what you're given... so nobody is more responsible for your success than you. The only thing you have in common with your opponent is time... are you using your time better than they\u2019re using their time?\u201d\n\nCoach McClendon certainly talks the talk and has a track record of following through by producing a stable of productive receivers at each stop he's made during his coaching career. Will he stick around long enough to do that at Miami??? That remains to be seen... I\u2019m not a betting man, but if I were, my money would be on him staying at Miami.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

Despite starting just eight games, Nick Chubb finished second in the SEC in rushing (1,547 yards) and was named the SEC Freshman of the Year. Chubb and Todd Gurley (911 yards in six games) gave Georgia one of five FBS running back duos with over 900 yards rushing in 2014, while Sony Michel rushed for 410 yards on just 64 carries.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2015 season, McClendon was promoted to assistant head coach by Mark Richt and took over as passing game coordinator and wide receivers coach in addition to starting his second year as Georgia\u2019s recruiting coordinator. McClendon\u2019s first class (2015) as recruiting coordinator was ranked No. 6 nationally by 247Sports and Rivals.\n\nFrom 2011-14, the Bulldogs put together four of the top six seasons in program history in total offense and three of the top five seasons for total TDs. McClendon was promoted to the post of running backs coach in 2009. He recruited and developed some of the nation\u2019s best running backs over his five seasons, including Gurley, Chubb, Michel and Isaiah Crowell.\n\nMcClendon began his coaching career with a two-year stint as an offensive graduate assistant on the Georgia staff from 2007-08.\n\nMcClendon was a four-year letterman at Georgia, where he graduated in 2005.

So catching the ball consistently and making contested catches, if I can do those two things I\u2019m always open\u2026 Doing those two things right now are what we work on on a day to day basis and that\u2019s not negotiable\u2026 not one of those said man you gotta be 6\u20194 220 pounds running 4.3 ok\u2026? alright... so again not one of those say man hey man I gotta work on cone drills over and over\u2026 none of that says that.\u201d\n\nWhen discussing his approach further with the Quarterbacks and Wide Receivers he stated:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s throwing you the ball for you to catch it\u2026 one of the biggest things that you could get me upset with you as being your coach is coming to the sideline and saying hey I didn\u2019t catch the ball \u2018cause it was a bad ball, or I didn\u2019t catch the ball because it was pass interference\u2026 We play the game like there\u2019s no such thing as pass interference, so you come to the sideline telling me I didn\u2019t catch it \u2018cause he grabbed me you\u2019re not going back in the game, Ok?!? Alright\u2026\u201d\n\nHe went on to discuss the need for his receivers to be able to catch the ball under duress\u2026\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one thing man right now\u2026 #1 if you can\u2019t catch the football you\u2019re playing the wrong spot\u2026 go to the DB room... I ain't got no problem with that\u2026 I don\u2019t care how fast or how big you are man if you can consistently make contested catches you\u2019ll do good\u201d\n\nMcClendon moved on to the next items on his list by saying:\n\n\u201c#2 and #3 go together... you want dominating at the line of scrimmage and #3 right now being able to separate and get open at a high level. They gotta be able to do that right now at a high level\u2026 that is a must\u2026 if you can\u2019t do that it\u2019s gonna be hard for you to play ok\u2026? alright...\n\n#4 being dangerous with the ball in my hand and I say this over and over again man catching the ball is not enough, alright? Being able to score and do something after I have the ball in my hand consistently, not every now and then.\u201d\n\n#5 Understanding coverages and defenses is a must\u2026 you gotta be able to know and understand defense... ain\u2019t too many routes in the NFL or college where you run a route regardless of the coverage or the leverage... you have to read and react. If its outside leverage and its 2 high, then I got this route... if its inside leverage with 2 high then its this route... its always readings to it... Dumb guys cant play wide receiver...\n\n#6 Turning big plays into touchdowns and that\u2019s a lot more than just catching a post and running in... on a run play or if the ball is thrown to the perimeter you have to be willing to block so your teammate can make it into the end zone... so right now man those are the critical factors right now that I feel like makes up a great receiver... being able to make plays once you have the ball in your hand... catching the ball is not enough... hey, catching the ball is not enough... so I never want to just sit up here and say coach I caught it\u2026 So what??? I mean what are you doing after the catch??? OK... what are you doing after the catch... \u2018cause if all you\u2019re gonna do right now is try to catch the ball then maybe you playing in the wrong spot...\n\nHe shared several examples of the points as he went over film from past players to help identify what that looks like for the recruits and in one portion of the presentation he stated:\n\n\u201cThe only thing I wanna see when that ball is thrown at you is where you focusing on the point of the ball\u2026 focus on the point of the ball right here man the same thing catching that ball and then standing up and then doing something after the catch, Ok? That\u2019s what makes guys different... a lot of people can go out there and catch this ball... that doesn\u2019t make you different, right? And that\u2019s not bad, it just means you need to go do something else... again I just wanna make sure that everybody understands that.\u201d\n\nOn how he expects his receivers to practice:\n\n\u201cNo matter what, in practice we\u2019re gonna finish ten yards past the deepest defender\u2026 every time we catch we finishing 10 yards past the deepest defenders\u2026 the only way to get better at trying to score is to score in practice\u2026 going out there and doing it over and over again... I\u2019ve been really really blessed to coach and recruit a bunch of really good players OK alright a bunch of them\u2026 I wanna make sure that you understand to play for me, or to play for coach Cristobal, understand this\u2026 We\u2019re gonna push you just as hard off the field as you will get pushed on the field, OK? Because this is a direct reflection of each other\u2026 a direct reflection of each other\u2026 so if this hard for you to do\u2026 if its hard for you to pay attention to me and everything else this is probably not for you\u2026 OK?\n\nAs McClendon closed out his presentation, he left the recruits with wise words:\n\n\u201cThe last thing I want to make sure that I say is this\u2026 there is nobody responsible for your success other than you\u2026 I don\u2019t want to hear oh man this guy ain\u2019t getting me the ball or man we running these type of plays and everything else\u2026 it\u2019s about what you do with your gift\u2026with what you're given... so nobody is more responsible for your success than you. The only thing you have in common with your opponent is time... are you using your time better than they\u2019re using their time?\u201d\n\nCoach McClendon certainly talks the talk and has a track record of following through by producing a stable of productive receivers at each stop he's made during his coaching career. Will he stick around long enough to do that at Miami??? That remains to be seen... I\u2019m not a betting man, but if I were, my money would be on him staying at Miami.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

McClendon previously worked as the assistant/wide receivers coach at South Carolina before taking the wide receivers coach job in Eugene in 2020.\n\nMcClendon is filing in for former Oregon coach Mario Cristobal, who took the job at Miami. Oregon is playing the Oklahoma Sooners, who also have an interim coach, Bob Stoops, in the Alamo Bowl.\n\nMcClendon joined the South Carolina Gamecocks for the 2016 season. He became their offensive coordinator in 2018, but the Gamecocks struggled mightily over those two seasons going 11-14. He coached NFL standout Deebo Samuel during his time with South Carolina.\n\nGeorgia fans may remember McClendon from this key touchdown catch against Georgia Tech in 2005:\n\nMcClendon won 44 games and two SEC Championships during his time in Athens as a player. He returned to Georgia as a graduate assistant coach in 2007-2008. He served as running backs coach from 2009 to 2014 (he coached both Todd Gurley and Nick Chubb) before becoming recruiting coordinator.\n\nMcClendon served as Georgia\u2019s interim coach in the 2016 Tax Slayer Bowl. Georgia won the game 24-17 over Penn State."}]}
