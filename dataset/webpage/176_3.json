He is considered to have some of the more extreme opinions on talk radio. He writes that he created the term \"Compassionate Conservative\" in 1994, and, for him, these words describe a \"firewall of balance\" that limits how far to the right his opinions go.[1]\n\nOn 12 September 2009, he was fired by San Francisco radio station KNEW, the third San Francisco station to do so, with the explanation \"Here's your no-spin direct answer; we have decided to go in a different philosophical and ideological direction, featuring more contemporary content and more local information. The Savage Nation does not fit into that vision.\"[2]\n\nHe is also a contributor to WorldNetDaily and NewsMax. In 2003, he was fired by MSNBC for anti-gay remarks. [3] He was a friend, in the 1970s, of Allen Ginsberg, and wrote a novel in 1983,Vital Signs, in which the protagonist said \"I choose to override my desires for men when they swell in me, waiting out the passions like a storm, below decks.\" [4]\n\nRecent reporting\n\nOn his website, now hosted by WorldNetDaily, the \"Savage Manifesto\" states a number of his goals, certainly not fitting a single ideology, including: [5]\n\nRegulate Wall Street: End short selling. Try tycoons who profited from bailouts.\n\nGive Israel four years to become self-sufficient. Cut off all foreign aid to all nations.\n\nHave illegal aliens build a wall between the United States and Mexico, and then, repatriate them. Pay them a one-time worker fee.\n\nNorth Korea. Destroy their launching platforms, impose a Naval blockade on all goods coming in or out, except food.\n\nMake abortions illegal, except when the physical survival of the mother is threatened, to be determined by three medical doctors. Require Norplant for all women on welfare of childbearing age.\n\nMexico. Force Mexico to pay one barrel of oil for every illegal alien in the United States of America per month.\n\nHe is a supporter of the Birther Movement, accusing Barack Obama of being a Kenyan citizen.[6]\n\nHis website displays Geert Wilders' speech on Islam.\n\nLawsuits\n\nHe has sued the Council on American Islamic Relations for copyright infringement, because they rebroadcast a part of a show in which he referred to the Qur'an as \"a throwback document\" and a \"book of hate.\"\n\nWhat kind of religion is this? What kind of world are you living in when you let them in here with that throwback document in their hand, which is a book of hate... Don't tell me I need reeducation. They need deportation.[7]\n\nHe also joined in a suit against U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano and U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder over a report issued by the Department of Homeland Security, which warned that there might be increased risk of extremism among disaffected returned veterans. [8]\n\nOpinions on journalists\n\nAfter he played portions of a Barbara Walters interview with Hugo Chavez, he called her a \"double-talking slut\" continuing: \"She's an empty mind-slut. She'd peddle anything for a ratings point....[a] mental prostitute...I think that the woman is vermin. I think she's dirt.\"\n\nOn August 7, 2006, he said of CNN's White House correspondent, Wolf Blitzer,\n\nThat's why the department store dummy named Wolf Blitzer, a Jew who was born in Israel, will do the astonishing act of being the type that would stick Jewish children into a gas chamber to stay alive another day. He's probably the most despicable man in the media next to Larry King, who takes a close runner-up by the hair of a nose. The two of them together look like the type that would have pushed Jewish children into the oven to stay alive one more day to entertain the Nazis.[9]\n\nBlitzer was born in Germany but grew up in Buffalo, New York and attended the University of Buffalo, according to its alumni newsletter. [10]\n\nHate speech and Britain\n\nHe was banned from entry into Britain, in 2008, by Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, on grounds that he was among a group of \"preachers of hate\".\n\nI think it\u2019s important that people understand the sorts of values and sorts of standards that we have here, the fact that it\u2019s a privilege to come and the sort of things that mean you won\u2019t be welcome in this country[11]\n\nEducation and academia\n\nHe holds a B.S. degree in biology and education from Queens College, in New York City, and taught high school science before returning to graduate school, receiving a Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley in Nutritional Ethnomedicine in 1978. Savage also holds two Master\u2019s degrees in Medical Botany and Medical Anthropology from the University of Hawaii. (The degrees are under the name of Weiner, not Savage.)\n\nOriginally, he sought an academic career, originally in biology and then in journalism. Salon.com reported that he claimed both to have been banned from academic appointments due to his race and gender: \"\"I discovered I could not gain a professorship even after applying many times. My crime? I was a white male.\" In broadcast and on his book covers, Michael Weiner claimed, however, to have had a number of academic appointments in the sciences. A book he attempted to publish in 1994, \"Immigrants and Epidemics, which claimed that Southeast Asian immigrants were bringing tuberculosis and other infectious diseases into the United States. After publishers rejected it, he rented a studio and created the Michael Savage persona. [12]\n\nIn 1996, after having written approximately 20 books in medical botany and related topics, he applied for the deanship of the journalism school of the University of California at Berkeley. At that time, he had a year of radio experience although recognition in phytotherapy.\n\nIn 1998, David Horowitz and his Individual Rights Foundation filed suit against the Regents of the University of California, on behalf of Savage, when Orville Schell was named dean of the journalism school.[13] The suit alleged that Schell was selected through an \"old-boy network of New Leftists, his appointment constituted political patronage and was therefore illegal under California labor law.\" [14]"}, {"url": "https://www.ksfo.com/michaelsavage/", "page_content": "The Michael Savage Show\n\nWEEKDAYS 12PM TO 2PM\n\nCall in Number: 1-855-400-SAVAGE (7282)\n\nDr. Michael Savage is a multimedia icon in the conservative movement, heard by 10 million listeners a week on The Michael Savage Show and syndicated across the U.S. in more than 300 markets.

Complementary to this, I aim to understand how much variation around optima or averages is considered healthy or adaptive versus diseased or disturbed states, which are essentially deviations from normal or sustainable functioning. As I attempt to make progress on these questions, I join together ecology, evolutionary theory, physiology, mathematical modeling, image-analysis software, informatics, and biomedical sciences. Many theories, including some of my work, focus on optimal or average properties, but more recently, I have been working to obtain the large amounts of data necessary to characterize variation in key properties. My new findings about the diversity and variation in form and function are revealing flaws in current models, and I am working to develop new theories that incorporate realistic amounts of natural variation.\n\nI also am faculty in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.\n\nSavage's Lab"}, {"url": "https://caltech.academia.edu/MichaelSavage", "page_content": "In March 1972, during the remedial hearings on the Bradley v.

Milliken school desegregation case in Detroit, a white homeowners' group that initially formed to oppose school integration, the Citizens' Committee for Better Education (CCBE), argued the same thing as the NAACP: that any school desegregation plan should not be limited to the central city alone. Placing school segregation in its metropolitan context, both groups urged the inclusion of politically autonomous, virtually all-white suburbs in remedying segregation. In fact, it was the CCBE that first brought this issue up in court \u2013 not the plaintiff NAACP. Far from an anomaly, in other cities \u2013 notably Philadelphia and Boston \u2013 metropolitan arguments were advanced most forcefully by urban whites who possessed little commitment to the concept of integration. Many urban whites supported metropolitan integration because it would mean fewer black students in their children's schools. These metropolitan arguments did not require a genuine transformation in outlook \u2013 those making them were free to continue working against integration politically, as CCBE members did by supporting George Wallace's drive for the 1972 Democratic Presidential nomination and by advocating for an anti-busing constitutional amendment. Despite this, the metropolitan arguments nevertheless articulated a significant residence-and class-based challenge to the suburban methods of exclusion which kept African Americans and many poor whites confined to the central cities. In recovering the history of metropolitan arguments, two themes become abundantly clear: metropolitan remedies for segregation had a longer history than is typically appreciated, and the the poles of urban segregation and metropolitan integration were not as far apart one would expect."}, {"url": "https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/david-savage", "page_content": "Research Expertise and Interest\n\nbiochemistry, metabolism, photosynthetic systems, Systems and Synthetic Biology, protein engineering\n\nResearch Description\n\nDavid Savage is an associate professor of biochemistry, biophysics, and structural biology in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology. The goal of the Savage Lab is to understand how protein machinery \u2013 including both enzymes and compartmentalization - facilitates the biochemistry of the cell. They are particularly interested in photosynthetic CO2 fixation, a complex set of reactions that must occur in the right place and time to capture and convert light into stored chemical energy. Photosynthesis is uniquely important for human society. It catalyzes the assimilation of inorganic carbon into the organic world and is the ultimate source of nearly all nutritional calories on Earth.\n\nThey employ several model organisms including various bacterial species, mammalian cells and plant cells. For the past several years, they have focused much of our effort on the bacterial Carbon dioxide Concentrating Mechanism (CCM), a multi-scale, multi-component system that functions to increase the rate and specificity of the critical enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase / oxygenase (Rubisco). They use the tools of biochemistry, molecular biology, and synthetic biology to identify and characterize the key players and mechanistic principles underlying CCM function. Ultimately, they hope to develop a total cell biological understanding of how CCM function emerges from individual components and to use this understanding for the improvement of photosynthetic CO2 fixation in plants.\n\nThey are therefore also interested in the development of novel genome editing technologies for accelerating genetic experiments in plants. Given the generality of these tools, they also explore how engineered genome editors can be used to improve editing in human cells. Their specific areas of research are as follows.\n\nCurrent Projects\n\nUnderstanding and Improving Biological CO2 Assimilation\n\nCyanobacteria carry out photosynthetic carbon dioxide assimilation by controlling when and where these biochemical reactions occur. Perhaps most amazing is the use of a protein organelle, the carboxysome, to achieve improved activity of Rubisco. Rubisco is a notoriously bad enzyme, and it is thought the inside of the carboxysome provides a microenvironment within the cell of high carbon dioxide (and possibly low oxygen) as a means of improving rate and specificity. Despite numerous structural studies of carboxysome components, there are many open questions they are currently investigating related to how this massive complex self-assembles and functions in the context of the cellular milieu. For example, our systems model of the CCM (Mangan et al. 2016) suggests that pH, carbon transport, and carboxysome permeability are highly intertwined and they are interested in mechanisms that can control the permeability of the carboxysome shell. Second, work from our group has demonstrated the inherent genetic modularity of the CCM may all for it to be transferred to other organisms in order to improve their growth (Bonacci et al. 2012). They are therefore also developing tractable genetic systems to explore, in a synthetic biological context, how CCMs can be constructed de novo. They have used high-throughput screening strategies to identify unknown components of the CCM (Desmarais et al. 2019), and in a recent paper, demonstrated a complete reconstitution of the CCM by porting it from a native to a heterologous host (Flamholz et al. 2020). The latter publication is the first such successful demonstration of a fully functional, engineered CCM.\n\nTools for Investigating Protein Structure, Function and Engineering\n\nOur group takes an integrative view of protein function. That is, they are interested not only in protein mechanism but also in trying to understand this mechanism in its native, cellular context. They therefore also develop genetic tools to interrogate proteins in the cell. Much of this effort has been focused on leveraging recent advances in DNA sequencing to interrogate protein function in higher throughput and also demonstrating that protein sequence topology is a critical, yet often unexplored, dimension of the sequence-function landscape (Higgins and Savage 2017). Highlights of our work include developing a novel systematic mutagenesis method (Higgins et al. 2017), a transposon-based method for rapidly constructing metabolite biosensors (Nadler et al. 2016), and development of an allosterically regulated Cas9 variant (Oakes et al. 2016). In more recent work, they have also developed a technique, called MISER, that enables the directed evolution of smaller proteins from a starting parental scaffold (Shams et al. 2021). Currently, they are developing high-throughput selective assays for some of our favorite enzymes, including Rubisco (Flamholz et al. 2020), and applying modern mutational methods and machine learning approaches to better explore sequence-function landscapes.\n\nGenome Editing Applications\n\nAn important application of our protein engineering work is to make robust genome editing that can be delivered to the right cell at the right time. For example, the study of many model organisms, particularly plants, is constrained by our ability to quickly and easily manipulate gene sequence and gene expression. Although advances with CRISPR-Cas proteins, such as Cas9, have accelerated this progress, much remains to be done. To this end, they have developed engineered variants of Cas9 that are allosterically regulated (Oakes et al. 2016). More broadly, they have sought to optimized the entire scaffold of Cas9 using topological mutagenesis in order to improve both delivery (Oakes et al. 2019) and for effector fusions such as base editors (Huang et al. 2019). In more recent work, they have also developed a technique, called MISER, that enables the directed evolution of smaller genome editing proteins which are more suitable for viral delivery vectors (Shams et al. 2021). Current projects also include developing new genome editing tools to facilitate plant genetic experiments.\n\nUnderstanding the Diversity and Functions of Protein Compartments\n\nThe carboxysome is a 250 MDa+ complex formed from thousands of proteins, yet it self-assembles in the bacterial cytosol into monodisperse particles. How does this amazing process occur? In previous work, they have used microscopy to demonstrate the importance of carboxysome partitioning during cell division and the surprising connection between this process and the bacterial cytoskeleton (Savage et al. 2010; Yokoo et al. 2015). More recently they have focused on assembly directly and have demonstrated the minimal set of proteins sufficient to produce the carboxysome in a heterologous host (Bonacci et al. 2012), and honed in on one of these proteins, CsoS2, as particularly critical to the process (Chaijarasphong et al. 2016). They are now currently building on these advances to understand how specific protein-protein interactions direct the assembly process and are attempting to elucidate the fundamental biophysical principles leading to high fidelity assembly. Finally, they now believe that the carboxysome is yet one example of myriad ways in which protein compartments can facilitate biochemical function (Nichols et al. 2017). They are thus also interested identifying novel compartments and, more broadly, understanding the functional principles of compartmentalization. An example of the former is our recent identification and characterization of a wide variety of compartments involved in sulfur metabolism (Nichols et al. 2021).\n\nSelected Publications\n\nNichols RJ, LaFrance B, Phillips NR, Radford DR, Oltrogge LM, Valentin-Alvarado LE, et al.

Yet on that day, the host of The Savage Nation launched a new line of attack inspired by the anniversary of the bombing of Pearl Harbor\u2014and the United States\u2019 reaction to it. Broadcasting from his home in Northern California, where a strict new stay-at-home order had just gone into effect, Savage declared that his and other blue states had been turned into \u201cDemocrat-run prison camps\u201d whose residents were living under \u201cundeclared martial law.\u201d \u201cWe have gone from Japanese internment to lockdowns and curfews without so much as anyone screaming,\u201d he said.\n\nRiffing on this tendentious analogy, Savage said he hoped that the governors of California and New York \u201cdon\u2019t declare their states military areas from which any or all persons may be excluded\u201d\u2014a reference to the orders that led to 110,000 Japanese Americans being forced into concentration camps during World War II. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ll deport us from our own state, making it safe only for Mexican illegal aliens so they could have 100 percent and absolute freedom to do what they want.\u201d\n\nThe harangue thinly disguised as a history lesson was typical of Savage, a right-wing shock jock whose 27-year career has left a trail of racist, xenophobic, and homophobic comments. But the pseudonymous talker (real name: Michael A. Weiner) wasn\u2019t simply mouthing off as his on-air persona; he was about to enlist his audience in a battle he\u2019d been waging in his side gig as a public servant.\n\nLast May, President Donald Trump named Savage to the board of directors of the Presidio Trust, the federal corporation that runs the nearly 1,200-acre urban park at the foot of San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Bridge. In a normal year, as many as 10 million visitors enjoy the Presidio\u2019s stunning views, forests, wetlands, and historic sites. For more than a century, this prime real estate had been an US Army base; in 1994, the Pentagon handed it over to the National Park Service. When his appointment was first announced, Savage said that one of his goals would be to \u201cremind the public of the military significance\u201d of the site. Yet throughout the fall of 2020, Savage had been working behind the scenes to use his new position to try to downplay an inglorious chapter of that history: the former base\u2019s inarguable connection to the forced removal and detention of Japanese Americans during World War II. That abuse of power, set in motion by a 1942 executive order signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was carried out through more than 100 military exclusion orders issued from the Presidio\u2014orders just like those Savage had alluded to on the air.\n\nHis revisionist campaign was focused on the Presidio\u2019s museum, which he had come to see as a symbol of unchecked liberal sensitivity. \u201cYou would think that the military heritage museum would show us the greatness of the US Army at the Presidio, but it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he griped on his December 7 program. \u201cInstead, it shows us big things about the Japanese internment. Two of the largest exhibits inside this heritage museum are about the internment of Japanese Americans. Now as important as that is, it does not define the US military.\u201d To rectify this \u201ccockeyed\u201d and \u201ccrazy\u201d situation, Savage said he wanted the museum to highlight events such as D-Day and the liberation of Nazi concentration camps.\n\nHe went on, quickly heading toward one of his trademark apoplectic blow-ups. \u201cI am so sick and tired of the vermin on the left debasing the military in my country that I could just scream about it!\u201d he shouted.\n\nThe rant wasn\u2019t just for effect. A trove of emails obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) reveal that Savage\u2019s first months as a Presidio Trust board member were marked by prickly outbursts, culminating in a sudden push to inject his toxic politics into park business. And, as he promised his audience on Pearl Harbor Day, he\u2019s only getting started. \u201cI\u2019m on for another three years on the Presidio Trust board and I\u2019m going to kick my heels up and raise hell until the US Army is represented properly inside that museum,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have only heard the beginning of my outrage.\u201d\n\nIn his final year in office, Trump handed out dozens of positions and awards to loyalists whose qualifications included their propensity to irk liberals. But amid the worsening news during the first weeks of the pandemic, Savage\u2019s appointment to the Presidio Trust\u2019s board prompted little comment, even in the city he calls \u201cSicko Frisco\u201d and \u201cSan Fran-Freako.\u201d Perhaps it was just a coincidence, but the March 26 announcement fell on the birthday of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a key player in the Presidio\u2019s conversion into a national park and a frequent target of Savage\u2019s bile.\n\nThe new job was the ultimate validation of Savage\u2019s transformation into the self-styled \u201cGodfather of Trumpmania.\u201d The 79-year-old got his start in talk radio in the mid-1990s with a drivetime show in San Francisco. In less than a decade, he gained a national audience, got and lost a show on MSNBC, and joined the top ranks of conservative radio hosts. He was initially cool toward Trump, whom he mocked as \u201cthe Balding Eagle.\u201d Yet he changed his tune in 2015, becoming an early and ardent supporter of a presidential candidate whose white identity politics and constant need for affirmation mirrored his own. Trump repaid Savage\u2019s allegiance with audiences at Mar-a-Lago, the White House, and on Air Force One. Even as Savage criticized Trump for not going far enough, he portrayed the political forces arrayed against the president in apocalyptic terms. \u201cAt the end of the road,\u201d he warned as the 2020 election approached, \u201cwe know Trump is the only thing standing between us and absolute chaos in this nation.\u201d\n\nThe president names six of the Presidio Trust\u2019s board members; the secretary of the interior designates the seventh. The unpaid four-year seats have mostly been filled by affluent Bay Area residents: President Barack Obama\u2019s appointees included investment banker William Hambrecht, a major Democratic donor, and Mark Pincus, the founder of the gaming company Zynga. Savage, who lives just outside San Francisco in Marin County, replaced John Keker, a high-profile attorney. Four of his colleagues on the board are Trump appointees with conventional CVs; Lynne Benioff, a philanthropist who is married to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, is the sole remaining Obama appointee. (The seventh member is the former chief of staff for ex-Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt.) According to the trust, only the president may remove or replace sitting board members.\n\nBy law, the board\u2019s seats must go to people with \u201cextensive knowledge and experience\u201d in city planning, finance, real estate development, or resource conservation. Presumably, Savage checks that last box; he\u2019s said Trump picked him specifically for \u201cthe resum\u00e9 of my environmental background over the last 40 years.\u201d Ironically, that\u2019s the one issue where there is the most political daylight between Savage and Trump. Though he detests the \u201cEnvironmental Propaganda Agency\u201d and thinks climate change is a \u201cscam\u201d based on \u201cStalinist science,\u201d Savage is a Rachel Carson\u2013quoting animal lover who spoke out against Trump\u2019s decision to allow the hunting of bear cubs and wolves on federal land and against his sons\u2019 trophy hunting. \u201cTheir record on the environment is sickening, abysmal, nightmarish,\u201d Savage said last June.\n\nMost of Savage\u2019s conservationist cred stems from his pre-radio career, back when he was a hippie, herbalist, nutritionist, and the author of books like Plant a Tree and Herbs That Heal. Savage has always flaunted these unusual credentials, which he\u2019s burnished to a high gloss. He has claimed to have \u201cspent decades searching and saving tropical rainforests.\u201d His bio states that he has a PhD from the University of California, Berkeley, in \u201cepidemiology and nutrition sciences.\u201d (Officially, it is in nutritional ethnomedicine.) Lately, as he\u2019s claimed that COVID surges are caused by Mexicans trying to \u201cflood the gringo hospitals\u201d and has vowed to \u201cjoin an armed militia\u201d\u2060 before getting vaccinated, he\u2019s boasted of being \u201ca trained epidemiologist.\u201d\n\nSavage has bragged to his listeners that his position at the Presidio Trust is \u201cequivalent to being an ambassador.\u201d The prestigious post arrived at an opportune moment. As 2020 came to an end, so did The Savage Nation, which aired its final episode on December 31. (Savage said \u201clegal reasons\u201d prevented him from saying why Westwood One pulled the broadcast.) Though he now hosts a twice-weekly podcast, he\u2019s lost a major platform for amplifying the kinds of controversy that have sustained his career. As he ventured into \u201cthis piece of federal land in the middle of occupied territory,\u201d he would find a new one.\n\n\n\nWhen his appointment to the Presidio Trust was made public last March, Savage insisted it wasn\u2019t his idea. \u201cI did not apply for it, didn\u2019t ask for it,\u201d he claimed on his program. When Trump personally called to make the offer, Savage said that he\u2019d promised, \u201cPresident Trump, I\u2019ll make you proud.\u201d\n\nYet Savage seemed unprepared for his new role overseeing a popular park that receives no federal funding and was facing a pandemic budget crunch. \u201cWhen I talked to him he had no idea we run a large business to be self-sustaining,\u201d Presidio Trust CEO Jean Fraser, who was appointed by the board in 2016, wrote in an internal email after her first conversation with him. Board Vice-Chair Marie Hurabiell, who was appointed by Trump in 2018, spoke with Savage and reported back that he \u201cseemed very excited to be working with the Presidio, which he loves.\u201d But, she continued, \u201cHe was a little nervous that it would be a lot of work and asked how we all manage it.\u201d Savage was initially assigned to the board\u2019s finance and audit committee, but he demurred. \u201cI am not a financial person,\u201d he replied. (He joined the governance and human resources committee instead.)\n\nPrompted for details on what he would like to do with his new role, Savage, who has no military experience, emailed back that he hoped to see \u201ca new inclusion of the Presidio\u2019s proud military heritage\u201d and wanted to use his botanical knowledge to create \u201ca native American medicinal plant garden.\u201d Asked for examples of his personal ties to the park to include in a press release, he suggested quoting his 2012 action novel Abuse of Power, in which the former base is a backdrop for a high-speed chase along roads named \u201cfor military commanders who knew how to defeat the enemy, not placate the media and foreign lobbyists.\u201d\n\nSavage proved easily fazed by routine requests. When he was asked to attend a short ethics review with a staff attorney, he grumbled, \u201cWhat is this emphasis on \u2018ethics\u2019? Am I somehow suspect?\u201d The session, he was told, was mandatory for new board members. Savage, writing from a personal email account with the handle \u201cjoe shmo,\u201d replied, \u201cWell i can understand the need for this procedure. But I find it offensive to answer to some lawyer.\u201d (He eventually relented and took the training.)\n\nWhen he was told he\u2019d have to fill out a standard financial disclosure form, Savage balked. \u201cSINCE I AM NOT AN EMPLOYEE OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, NOR RECEIVING ANY COMPENSATION I SEE NO NEED TO FILL OUT THE \u2018ETHICS\u2019 FORM,\u201d he wrote. After he was granted an extension, Savage said that he and his wife \u201care in touch with the White House about this intrusive inquisition\u2026To open up our PRIVATE financial arrangements, for a non-paying relationship, and expose ourselves to unknown individuals is not tenable. Especially in these troubling times.\u201d (He eventually submitted the form, which is not public.)\n\nWhen it came to board business, however, Savage was less eager to make use of his connection to Trump. Last June, as a funding bill for the national parks moved through Congress, the trust\u2019s board members were asked to work their connections to push for an amendment allowing the Presidio to increase its borrowing authority. The money would have provided a financial lifeline to the park, which lost $29 million in revenue last year and laid off 20 percent of its 350-person workforce. Carole McNeil, a real estate investor put on the board by Trump in 2019, got in touch with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who she thought \u201cwould probably take a positive interest in our situation.\u201d Yet when a Presidio Trust executive asked Savage if he\u2019d hit up his \u201ccontacts in the White House,\u201d his response was unenthusiastic. \u201cI will just forward your letter to the White House,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDoubt the timing. Riots have the entire admin occupied.\u201d The final version of the $1.9 billion Great American Outdoors Act did not include the Presidio\u2019s request.\n\nTo his obvious displeasure, Savage\u2019s new position also opened him up to an unfamiliar type of scrutiny. When an internal report disclosed one of the FOIA requests used to report this article, Savage sent an irritated email to Fraser. \u201cWhat\u2019s the situation surrounding \u2018Dr Weiner\u2019s emails to Board staff\u2019?\u201d he demanded, referring to his legal name, which he uses on the board. \u201cWhy is this an issue? Who sent this? What is the resolution?\u201d\n\nOn July 23, Savage attended his first public board meeting, held via Zoom. During the comment period, one of the Presidio\u2019s residents began to speak about how Savage\u2019s well-documented views relate to the trust\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion plan. She calmly noted that the Southern Poverty Law Center has reported that Savage \u201csubscribes to the white genocide conspiracy theory\u201d and has blamed immigrants for spreading disease. She had started to describe his comments about Muslims when board chair William Grayson, a wealth manager appointed by Trump in 2017, cut her short, saying that bringing up board members\u2019 personal views was \u201coutside the scope\u201d of the meeting.\n\nThe speaker was silenced after less than a minute, but this exposure to a small dose of public criticism incensed Savage. After the meeting, he fired off an email to Grayson and trust administrators demanding, \u201cWHO PERMITTED THE LAST SPEAKER TO ATTACK ME? HOW DID SHE GET ON THE LIST OF \u2018APPROVED SPEAKERS\u2019?\u201d Fraser responded that public comments at board meetings are not pre-screened. \u201c[W]e are required under the First Amendment not to censor people however offensive their comments might be,\u201d she wrote. Savage snapped, \u201cYes, I am aware of the \u2018law\u2019. Do not appreciate your lecture. Not what I asked. How did this hateful person get to be chosen?\u2026Did she indicate she wanted to verbally abuse my good name?\u201d Fraser emailed Grayson and Benioff that she would appreciate their assistance \u201cin helping Dr Weiner understand how public meetings work.\u201d\n\nIn an all-caps message, Savage suggested new rules for the board\u2019s public meetings, including a prohibition on \u201cAD HOMINUM [sic] ATTACKS ON BOARD MEMBERS\u201d as well as any discussion of their political or personal views. Afterward, the board posted updated meeting guidelines that expressly ask members of the public to \u201cnot address individual Board members.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn his messages from his first few months at the Presidio Trust, Savage comes off as thin-skinned and crabby, yet largely able to keep his political agenda separate from board business. However, that boundary collapsed last fall, when he found an outlet for one of his long-simmering fixations.\n\nAt the board\u2019s public meeting on September 23, Fraser announced a plan to save money by moving the Presidio\u2019s museum, known as the Heritage Gallery, from its home in the old Officer\u2019s Club to a smaller space. Several members of the public spoke out against relocating the museum, which includes exhibits on the indigenous Ohlone people and the Presidio\u2019s time as a Spanish and Mexican garrison. None of the speakers were critical of the gallery\u2019s content; two specifically praised \u201cExclusion,\u201d a recent temporary exhibit that explored the former Army base\u2019s \u201cpivotal role in the incarceration of Japanese Americans.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve seen people cry,\u201d after seeing it, one docent said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people come in and thank us for raising the issue that they feel is extremely important.\u201d\n\nIn their emails about the plan, board members, including Savage, expressed their desire to keep the museum in its current location. Yet shortly after the board meeting, Savage dragged the conversation off on an irate tangent, writing to his colleagues, \u201cNow that we are looking more closely at the Heritage exhibit, I want to discuss the INCLUSION OF THE DEFEAT OF HITLER! There is far too much emphasis on the JAPANESE INTERNMENT.\u201d He went on: \u201cAnd, while we are at it, we must emphasize that it was Franklin Roosevelt, a far left LIBERAL, who interred the Japanese. We must insist on HISTORICAL truths. When can we address these concerns?\u201d\n\nOn his radio program that day, Savage briefly mentioned the debate over moving the museum, implying that he was preventing a purge of the Presidio\u2019s past: \u201cNow, what if the president had been Obama and he had appointed someone to the board? They would remove the military history probably into a garbage can.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Savage sent the board a message with the subject \u201cfrom a military historian and war hero.\u201d \u201cThe one thing I have found interesting is how the Trust has always been able to find a grievance to exploit,\u201d it read. \u201cWas it regrettable that the Japanese were interned? Yes, but the reason is more nuanced than the \u2018racist\u2019 one they will give you.\u201d It included a link to what was described as \u201ca government publication on the extent of Japanese espionage on the US West Coast\u201d during World War II; in fact, it was a 1983 newspaper article hosted on the CIA website that claimed \u201ca substantial number\u201d of Japanese Americans had been spies. It also linked to a page about the 1941 \u201cNiihau incident,\u201d in which Japanese Americans in Hawaii aided a downed Japanese pilot after the attack on Pearl Harbor, an episode that was cited at the time to justify questioning Japanese Americans\u2019 loyalties. \u201cYou probably know about this already,\u201d the email concluded. \u201cNone of that ever showed up in any of the Trust\u2019s exhibits.\u201d\n\nApparently, Savage\u2019s messages were met with silence; none of his fellow board members responded to his comments via email. While his angry explosion might have caught them by surprise, it didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. Learning about the Presidio museum\u2019s coverage of the incarceration of Japanese Americans appears to have triggered one of his obsessions. For years, Savage has fantasized about summarily locking up his enemies and trampling on their civil rights, while simultaneously insisting that liberals are secretly plotting to throw white conservatives into concentration camps.\n\n\u201cAmericans must give up some civil liberties in order to catch those who would kill us and then we get our civil liberties back,\u201d he wrote in his 2004 book The Savage Nation, where he unapologetically called for targeting Muslim Americans to combat terrorism. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna mince words with you. I want racial profiling, and I want it now.\u201d In his following book, The Enemy Within, he stated, \u201cWe cannot afford to be naive or worried about tolerance when our national security is on the line.\u201d Throughout last summer, he railed against Black Lives Matters protesters as \u201cthugs,\u201d \u201cferal dogs,\u201d and \u201cvermin\u201d who should be \u201crounded up\u201d and \u201cput into detention immediately.\u201d\n\nSavage has cited the imprisonment of Japanese Americans and other historical violations of civil liberties to justify his demands. After terrorists killed eight people in a van and knife attack in London in June 2017, he said hundreds of \u201cIslamists\u201d were on US watchlists, and asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you intern all of them before they run people over on a bridge, or stab people in the street? It was done during World War II.\u201d Last May, Savage suggested that Trump take a page from President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s wartime crackdown on the press to \u201cclose down Twitter [and] arrest the heads of CNN.\u201d\n\nAs an alternative to \u201cfascist\u201d stay-at-home orders, Savage has promoted the \u201cselective quarantine\u201d of communities he believes to be vectors of the coronavirus, specifically \u201cthe homeless and illegal immigrant populations.\u201d Speaking about unhoused people last March, he said, \u201cFor six weeks I\u2019ve been screaming, \u2018Round them up, isolate them, give them the treatment they need.\u2019 Don\u2019t let them infect the whole city.\u201d In September, he complained that Democratic politicians wouldn\u2019t implement his solution because they were afraid of offending people: \u201cSo the governors, being the cowards that they are, applied affirmative action and locked everyone up in their houses and turned everyone into a prisoner.\u201d (\u201cI\u2019m a trained epidemiologist,\u201d he added. \u201cI know more about this than anyone in the media.\u201d)\n\nIn January, Savage joined the conservative media freakout over a New York assembly bill that proposed \u201cthe removal and detention\u201d of people \u201cwho are or may be a danger to public health.\u201d Though the bill would do what he\u2019d been advocating, Savage called it the \u201cmost un-American piece of legislation ever proposed in the history of this country\u201d and warned that it would lead to \u201cCOVID concentration camps\u201d for white Americans. Even as he attacked the bill (which had little chance of passing) he continued to call for \u201can emergency decree\u201d to forcibly detain \u201cthe homeless filth.\u201d\n\nSavage\u2019s views on Japanese American internment are similarly incoherent. His 2018 book, the unselfconsciously titled Stop Mass Hysteria, details the widespread anti-Japanese sentiment that drove \u201cblameless people\u201d into internment camps in 1942. Savage then slams actor and activist George Takei, a survivor of the camps, for daring to make the same essential point while criticizing Trump\u2019s Muslim ban. \u201cTakei is not correct,\u201d Savage writes. \u201c[T]he internment was neither racist nor hysterical on the part of the government. It was ultimately wrong, but it was tactical and reasoned.\u201d\n\nSavage\u2019s stance isn\u2019t about consistency but convenience: The wartime mistreatment of Japanese Americans provides further proof of liberal treachery as well as cover for his own authoritarian leanings. However, if anyone, particularly survivors, asks for a sincere reckoning with this episode of paranoia and scapegoating, they are un-American whiners. On his December 7 program, Savage noted that the federal government had also violated some Italian and German Americans\u2019 civil rights during World War II. \u201cYou don\u2019t know any of it because the Italians and the Germans didn\u2019t complain,\u201d he lectured his listeners. \u201cThey didn\u2019t cry. They didn\u2019t demand reparations. They understood why it was done.\u201d\n\nWhen I recently asked Savage for an interview about these issues, he wrote back, \u201cGiven the extreme left wing bias of \u2018mother Jones\u2019 [sic] I would assume you want to paint me in a negative light?\u201d A few hours later, he tweeted about Japanese American internment for the first time in more than three months: \u201cFDR \u2013 Biden\u2019s HERO, enslaved Japanese-Americans and placed them in INTERNMENT CAMPS! TIME TO REMOVE FDR\u2019S name from all HIGHWAYS, SCHOOLS & Institutions.\u201d\n\nSince last spring, the Presidio Trust had been tracking Savage\u2019s media appearances for any mentions of the park or his work there. A summary of his Pearl Harbor Day show that was circulated internally set off a flurry of emails among trust employees. One of the docents who had taken Savage on a tour of the Heritage Gallery in November expressed concern about his comments. \u201cWe heard some, but not all, of this criticism during the tour,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe told him that it was appropriate for the Presidio\u2019s collection to focus on the Army\u2019s history at the Presidio and let other museums, most notably the Smithsonian and other national collections, tell a more comprehensive story. Mr. Weiner didn\u2019t seem to be very receptive to that position during the tour.\u201d\n\nIn a message to Michael Boland, the trust\u2019s chief park officer, another staff member wondered if Savage understood that the \u201cExclusion\u201d exhibit was temporary and that the Heritage Gallery focused exclusively on the Presidio\u2019s history. \u201cSigh,\u201d Boland answered. \u201cWe\u2019ve told him multiple times.\u201d Other emails show that Fraser and administrative staff scrambled to talk offline about Savage\u2019s comments, which Boland noted were \u201ca Board governance issue.\u201d\n\nSavage didn\u2019t mention the museum issue on the air again in 2020, but he had not moved on. On New Year\u2019s Eve, he sent an email to his colleagues on the board, thanking them for \u201ca great introduction to the intricate workings of the Presidio.\u201d Looking ahead, he wrote, \u201cI hope to see a greater respect for the contributions of the U.S. Army and it\u2019s [sic] legacy on this hallowed ground.\u201d Once again, he proposed shifting the focus of the Heritage Gallery to Army history and suggested some more exhibits with no clear connection to the park\u2019s past: a \u201cdiorama of the Battan [sic] death March\u201d and perhaps something on \u201cthe experiments on our live human soldiers by the Japanese military.\u201d He added, \u201cLet me know how I might help.\u201d\n\nThis time, Grayson, who had not previously expressed support for Savage\u2019s views in the messages released by the Presidio Trust, responded with enthusiasm. \u201cI concur with Michael,\u201d he wrote back on January 2. \u201cCelebrating the US Army at the Presidio (and the men and women who served there\u2014and their impact around the world) would be fabulous.\u201d He sketched out some ideas for an expanded and improved museum. And he already had someone in mind to spearhead the project. \u201cWe need a board champion and I nominate Michael,\u201d Grayson wrote. McNeil concurred. \u201cI agree with you,\u201d she said. \u201cI think Michael Weiner would be the perfect person.\u201d\n\nIf the other board members objected to these proposals\u2014or the notion that Savage was seeking to champion the Presidio\u2019s history rather than twist it for his own purposes\u2014they did not immediately express their reactions via email. (The messages I obtained go through January 20.) I asked to speak with the trust\u2019s board members about their responses to Savage\u2019s opinions on the museum and the internment of Japanese Americans; a spokesperson said that they \u201cdo not discuss Presidio Trust matters with the press.\u201d In a statement, the trust said that \u201cThere are no plans to change the content of the Heritage Gallery\u2019s permanent exhibit\u201d and that there has been no decision whether to close the \u201cExclusion\u201d exhibit or make it permanent. After I requested an interview with Savage, I received a voicemail from a trust employee, who said that \u201cDr. Weiner is not a spokesman of our organization in any way.\u201d\n\nAs 2021 began, Savage\u2019s on-air career had faded and his political benefactor would grudgingly leave the White House in less than a month. Yet he seemed to be relishing the prospect of continuing to push buttons and boundaries inside the heart of \u201cthe sickest city in the world.\u201d Trump\u2019s parting gift to him still had plenty of time left on it. There was, Savage eagerly wrote to Grayson, \u201cso much to plan for.\u201d\n\n"}, {"url": "http://naturalhealthperspective.com/reviews/michael-savage-natural-immunity.html", "page_content": "Michael Goes Savage on Boosting\n\nNatural Immunity\n\nMichael Savage holds conservative political views whose political philosophy can be summarized in three words: borders, language, and culture. As an ardent conservationist and an open-minded individualist, Michael holds some rather strong views on health.\n\nHe was born Michael Alan Weiner and academically is a man of science. Some sites report that Michael Savage holds a PhD from the University of California, Berkeley, in nutritional ethnomedicine, the study of the traditional medicines practiced by various primitive cultures. Savage himself claims that his PhD is in both epidemiology and nutritional sciences. In addition, Michael holds two different master's degrees in science: medical botany and medical anthropology from the University of Hawaii.\n\nDr. Savage is known for opposing illegal immigration to the United States, for strongly supporting the English-only movement, and likes to claim that that liberalism is a mental disorder.\n\nDespite all the negative press on Michael Savage, he often humanizes many different topics on the air in his easy listening voice, such as his experiences with eating in restaurants and of course his pet dog, Teddy. Michael Savage on his radio talk show will even occasionally discuss his interest in health.\n\nHere are a few sound bites of Michael nailing it on natural health related topics.\n\nNaturally Boost Immunity with Retinol and Zinc\n\nThe Natural Health Perspective has its own formula for boosting natural immunity. While retinol and zinc are awesome at fighting infectious diseases, vitamin B-3 (i.e., nicotinamide) provides another powerful weapon. Michael's own complete immune boosting formula would probably include a number of different herbs. No matter how badly some people would describe the vitamin supplement business, the position of the Natural Health Perspective is that the herbal business is worst by far.\n\nWARNING: the vitamin A dosage recommended by Michael Savage is intended only for people who are feeling sick, which should only be used for a couple of days. Continuous daily dosing with retinol at such high levels would be toxic to the liver.\n\nUnder his birth name, Michael Weiner has written many health oriented books .\n\n1972 - Earth Medicine 1975 - Plant a Tree 1976 - Bugs in the Peanut Butter 1976 - Man's Useful Plants 1977 - The Taster's Guide to Beer 1981 - The Way of the Skeptical Nutritionist 1982 - The Art of Feeding Children Well 1983 - Nutrition Against Aging 1983 - Secrets of Fijian Medicine 1984 - Dr. Weiner's High Fiber Counter 1984 - Getting Off Cocaine 1984 - The People's Herbal 1986 - Maximum Immunity 1987 - Reducing the Risk of Alzheimer's 1989 - The Complete Book of Homeopathy 1990 - Weiner's Herbal: Guide to Herb Medicine 1992 - The Herbal Bible 1993 - Healing Children Naturally 1994 - Herbs That Heal 1995 - The Antioxidant Cookbook\n\nMichael Savage - Lecture on Vitamin C and Immune System\n\nSavage advocates stimulating your immune system with powder vitamin C along the lines of Linus Pauling and Ewan Cameron. Michael especially believes in Robert Cathard's bowel tolerance hypothesis of vitamin C usage. Unfortunately, on the tail end of this video, Michael gets sidetracked onto a political tangent.\n\nSavage on Health - Exposing the Cholesterol Myth\n\nMichael Savage is positively against managing your cholesterol levels with prescription medication on a recreational basis.\n\nMichael Savage on Health and Exercise\n\nFinally, Michael Savage no longer believes in running to improve his health.\n\nIn conclusion, the Natural Health Perspective substantially agrees with most of Michael Savage's views on natural health.\n\nAll content posted on this article is satire, commentary, or is an opinion piece that is protected under our constitutional rights to Free Speech.
