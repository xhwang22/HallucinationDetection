{"Under Tom Izzo's leadership, the Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team has won one national championship (in 2000) and eight Big Ten Conference championships.": [{"url": "https://msuspartans.com/sports/mens-basketball/roster/coaches/tom-izzo/1011", "page_content": "Tom Izzo was enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on September 9, 2016, cementing his status as one of the game\u2019s all-time greats.\n\n\\\n\nNow in his 28th year, Izzo has compiled an impressive list of accomplishments, including the 2000 NCAA National Championship, 10 regular-season Big Ten Championships, six Big Ten Tournament titles, eight Final Four appearances, eight National Coach of the Year awards and a Big Ten-record 24 straight NCAA Tournament appearances.\n\n\n\nThese accomplishments, however, are not what make Izzo one of the best in the game, but rather it is his insatiable desire to accomplish more.\n\n\n\nWith a career record of 666-267, it\u2019s easy to see that Izzo knows how to win, but he also knows how to win the right way. In his 27 years directing the Spartan program, 85 percent of his players who completed their eligibility also left with a degree. In the last 22 years, 65 Spartans have received their undergraduate degrees.\n\n\n\nIn 27 seasons, Izzo has returned Michigan State to national prominence, placed his name in the NCAA record books and become a leader among college basketball coaches.\n\nIzzo\u2019s 666 wins are fifth most by any coach in his first 27 seasons in the history of college basketball. In late November 2009, he passed his mentor Jud Heathcote (340 wins) to become MSU\u2019s all-time winningest coach. When the Spartans beat Ohio State in the quarterfinals of the 2019 Big Ten Tournament, Izzo won his 600th career game. He became one of just two Big Ten coaches with at least 300 conference wins when MSU beat Iowa, 78-70, on Feb. 25, 2020. And when the Spartans beat Maryland on March 6, 2022, the victory gave Izzo 663 overall wins for his career, passing Bob Knight of Indiana for the most overall wins by a Big Ten Head Coach.\n\n\n\nIn the NCAA Tournament, Izzo is at his best, winning at a clip of .697 to rank third among all active coaches with at least 10 tournament games coached. His 53 NCAA Tournament wins are the most ever for a Big Ten coach, and rank sixth all-time. He has led MSU to 24-straight NCAA Tournament appearances, the longest active streak among Division I coaches and tied for the longest streak all-time.\n\n\n\nA 2015 inductee into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame, Izzo led MSU to eight Final Four appearances between 1999 and 2019, becoming just the fourth school in college basketball history to do it in any 21-year span, including just the third since the tournament field expanded to 64 teams in 1985. Izzo is one of just two coaches in NCAA history to reach four Final Fours in his first 10 years of coaching, joining Ohio State\u2019s Fred Taylor, and is just the second coach in NCAA history to appear in eight Final Fours in a 21-year span since the tournament expanded to 64 teams. His eight Final Four appearances rank fifth all-time, first among active coaches and first all-time among Big Ten coaches. Two stats stand out in Izzo\u2019s NCAA Tournament success: 1) MSU is 23-7 in the second game of an NCAA Tournament weekend 2) MSU is 15-12 as the lower-seeded team, while the 15 wins are the most in NCAA Tournament history for any coach.\n\n\n\nThrough 27 seasons, Izzo is one of the most successful coaches in Big Ten history. His .679 winning percentage in Big Ten games ranks fourth all-time among league coaches with at least 10 years of service. In all games, Izzo ranks fourth (.714). With 322 conference victories, Izzo ranks second all-time, trailing just Indiana\u2019s Bob Knight (353 wins). In the 2021-22 regular season finale, the Spartans beat Maryland to give Izzo his 663rd win, passing Knight (662) for the most overall wins by a Big Ten Head Coach.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Izzo brings stability to Michigan State basketball. Including 12 years as an assistant, the 2022-23 season is Izzo\u2019s 40th with the Spartans, as he is the longest serving active Big Ten men\u2019s basketball head coach. He is also a leader among his peers, serving as the NABC President from April 2010-April 2011, while currently serving as an emeritus member of the NABC Board of Directors. He\u2019s also held spots on the John R. Wooden Award Board of Governors and the USA Basketball Collegiate Committee.\n\n\n\nOver the past 25 seasons, Izzo has compiled an impressive 633-239 (.726) record. A quick look at other stats further demonstrates the Spartans\u2019 success over that stretch: 304-134 (.694) in the Big Ten; 349-45 (.886) at the Breslin Center, including a Big Ten record 53-game winning streak; 142-126 (.530) against Top 25 teams (including four wins over No. 1-ranked teams); 87-41 (.680) in postseason play and 53-23 (.697) in the NCAA Tournament.\n\n\n\nIndividually, players have excelled under Izzo. Twelve Spartans (Charlie Bell, Mateen Cleaves, Paul Davis, Draymond Green, Gary Harris, Drew Neitzel, Adreian Payne, Morris Peterson, Jason Richardson, Denzel Valentine, Miles Bridges and Cassius Winston) have earned some form of All-America honors. Valentine earned six different National Player of the Year awards in 2016 (Associated Press, Basketball Times, NABC, NBC, Sports Illustrated and USA TODAY Sports), and Green was named National Player of the Year by the NABC in 2012. Chris Hill was a three-time Academic All-American, including being named the Academic All-American of the Year in 2005, while Neitzel also earned Academic All-America accolades. In 2019-20, Winston became the third player in MSU history to earn multiple consensus All-American honors, while Xavier Tillman Sr. was named a Second Team Academic All-American.\n\nForty-two different players have earned all-conference recognition, including 14 different first-team honorees, six Big Ten Players of the Year (Cleaves, Green, Lucas, Peterson, Valentine, Winston), three Big Ten Freshmen of the Year (Gary Harris, Miles Bridges and Jaren Jackson Jr.) and three Big Ten Defensive Players of the Year (Travis Walton, Jackson Jr. and Tillman Sr.).\n\n\n\nOne of the reasons for Izzo\u2019s success is his ability to recruit some of the nation\u2019s most talented high school players. During his time as head coach, Izzo has recruited 16 McDonald\u2019s All-Americans (Mateen Cleaves - 1996, Jason Richardson - 1999, Marcus Taylor and Zach Randolph - 2000, Kelvin Torbert - 2001, Paul Davis - 2002, Shannon Brown and Brandon Cotton - 2003, Keith Appling - 2010, Branden Dawson - 2011, Gary Harris - 2012, Deyonta Davis - 2015, Miles Bridges and Joshua Langford - 2016, Jaren Jackson Jr. - 2017, Max Christie - 2021). In addition, 12 of the last 23 Michigan Mr. Basketball award winners suited up for the Green and White (1999 - Richardson, 2000 - Taylor, 2001 - Torbert, 2002 - Davis, 2004 - Drew Neitzel, 2009 - Derrick Nix, 2010 - Appling, 2012 - Matt Costello, 2015 - Davis, 2016 - Cassius Winston, 2018 - Foster Loyer, 2021 \u2013 Pierre Brooks), while Shannon Brown won the 2003 Illinois Mr. Basketball Award and Gary Harris won the 2012 Indiana Mr. Basketball Award.\n\n\n\nBut perhaps even more important to Izzo\u2019s success is his ability to take young talent and develop a player\u2019s skills, allowing him to grow as a player and go on to play professionally. Under Izzo, Michigan State has had 23 players selected in the NBA Draft, including 22 since 2000, 11 of whom were first rounders (Mateen Cleaves - 2000 first round, Morris Peterson - 2000 first round, Jason Richardson - 2001 first round, Zach Randolph - 2001 first round, Andre Hutson - 2001 second round, Marcus Taylor - 2002 second round, Erazem Lorbek - 2005 second round, Shannon Brown - 2006 first round, Maurice Ager - 2006 first round, Paul Davis - 2006 second round, Goran Suton - 2009 second round, Draymond Green - 2012 second round, Adreian Payne - 2014 first round, Gary Harris - 2014 first round, Branden Dawson - 2015 second round, Denzel Valentine - 2016 first round, Deyonta Davis - 2016 second round, Jaren Jackson Jr. - 2018 first round, Miles Bridges - 2018 first round, Xavier Tillman Sr. - 2020 second round, Cassius Winston - 2020 second round, Max Christie \u2013 2022 second round).\n\nWhile many players were high school All-Americans, Izzo took others who were not ranked in the top-75 coming out of high school and turned them into NBA talent. In addition, Izzo-recruit Charlie Bell played in the NBA during the 2001-02 season after signing a free agent contract. After a successful stint overseas, Bell played seven more seasons in the NBA. Alan Anderson, a member of the 2005 Final Four team, signed a free agent contract and played two years with the Charlotte Bobcats and, after a stint in Europe, returned for five seasons back in the NBA. In more recent years, Kalin Lucas and Bryn Forbes have also played in the NBA after signing free agent contracts, while Aaron Henry signed a two-way contract with the Philadelphia 76ers in 2021. Numerous other former Spartans have enjoyed lucrative professional careers playing overseas.\n\n\n\nIzzo has also emerged as a teacher, not only to his players, but also his assistant coaches. Three current Division I head coaches served as assistants to Izzo, including Brian Gregory (South Florida), Stan Heath (Eastern Michigan) and Dwayne Stephens (Western Michigan). In total, eight former assistants have earned head coaching jobs. Former long-time assistant Mike Garland spent three seasons as head coach at Cleveland State following an initial seven-year stint at MSU, while Stan Joplin was also head coach at Toledo for 12 seasons, Jim Boylen served as head coach at Utah for four seasons, Heath served as head coach at Kent State, Arkansas and South Florida over 13 seasons and Tom Crean was the head coach at Marquette, Indiana and Georgia. The current coaching staff features two former assistants who were head coaches before returning to East Lansing \u2013 Doug Wojcik spent nine seasons between Tulsa and College of Charleston and Mark Montgomery was the head coach at Northern Illinois for 10 seasons.\n\n\n\nThe Spartans finished the 2021-22 season with a 23-13 overall record and were selected to the NCAA Tournament for the 24th-straight season, extending the longest streak in Big Ten history. The 24-year run also ranked tied for the third-longest in NCAA history and was the second-longest active streak in the nation. Izzo tied former Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski for the most consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances and entered the 2022-23 season as the active leader for consecutive appearances.\n\n\n\nMichigan State finished the 2020-21 season with a 15-13 overall record and advanced to the NCAA Tournament for the 23rd-straight season, the longest streak in Big Ten history and the third-longest active streak among Division I schools. In a season shortened to just 28 games due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Spartans opened the season with six-straight non-league wins, including a 75-69 win at Duke in the Champions Classic. After starting the Big Ten Conference season with three-straight losses and a 2-7 record through nine games, MSU finished the season with a 7-4 mark against Big Ten opponents and closed out the regular season with five wins in its last seven games, including wins against No. 5 Illinois, No. 4 Ohio State and No. 2 Michigan.\n\n\n\nThe 2019-20 season finished with Michigan State clinching a share of the Big Ten regular season title for the third-straight year. The Spartans won their last five regular season games and six of the last seven overall, to finish 14-6 and claim a share of the title. While the postseason was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, MSU finished the season with a 22-9 overall record and a 14-6 record in league play. The Spartans opened the season ranked No. 1 in the country in the Associated Press pre-season poll, the first time in program history the team was the top-ranked team in the preseason. MSU finished the season ranked second in the country in assists per game (17.7), while also ranked fourth in field goal percentage defense (37.9 percent) and ninth in total rebounds per game (40.6). Of the 28 20-win seasons in Michigan State history, Izzo has been involved in 25 of them, 20 as a head coach and five as an assistant.\n\n\n\nThe 2018-19 season was among the most memorable in Michigan State history under Izzo. The Spartans finished with a 32-7 overall record, the fifth 30-win season under Izzo, won a share of the Big Ten regular season championship, won the Big Ten Tournament Championship for a conference-record sixth time and reached the Final Four for the eighth time in 21 years and the 10th time in program history. Along the way, MSU won the Las Vegas Invitational, beat Michigan three times, including a 65-60 decision in the Big Ten Tournament Championship, and toppled No. 1 Duke, 68-67, in the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament. MSU finished the year leading the nation in total rebounds (1,580) and total assists (715), while ranking among the top-10 in the country in six other categories: assists per game (3rd, 18.3 apg), total blocks (3rd, 205), field goal percentage defense (3rd, 38.1%), rebound margin (5th, 8.8 rpg), defensive rebounds per game (6th, 29.72 rpg) and blocked shots per game (7th, 5.3 bpg).\n\n\n\nMichigan State finished the 2017-18 season with a 30-5 overall record, the fourth 30-win season under Izzo, advanced to the NCAA Tournament for a Big Ten-record 21st straight season and won the program\u2019s eighth Big Ten regular season championship. The Spartans set a school record for most wins in a regular season (28), won their first outright Big Ten Regular Season title since 2009, won 16 Big Ten Conference games for the first time and had the fewest losses in a regular season since the 2000-01 team went 24-3. The New Year started with MSU moving into the No. 1 spot in the national rankings for the fifth time in program history, and the fourth time under Izzo. The Spartans had win streaks of 14 games and 13 games during the season, earning a No. 3 seed in the Midwest Region of the NCAA Tournament. MSU finished the year leading the nation in assists per game (19.1), blocked shots per game (7.2), field goal percentage defense (36.7%) and rebound margin (+10.7).\n\n\n\nThe 2016-17 season saw Michigan State advance to the NCAA Tournament for a Big Ten-record 20th straight season. It was not an easy road, however, to reach the postseason. Before the season started, the Spartans lost senior forwards Ben Carter and Gavin Schilling to season-ending knee injuries. MSU\u2019s November was arguably the toughest opening month in college basketball history. In addition to games against four ranked opponents, all away from home, the Spartans traveled more than 13,600 miles in 22 days with trips to Hawaii, New York, North Carolina and the Bahamas. In December, the Spartans played seven contests without leading scorer Miles Bridges. Despite all the adversity, including losing a third player, Eron Harris, to a season-ending knee injury in February, the Spartans pulled together and used a 5-2 mark in February to earn their way into the NCAA Tournament. When MSU defeated Miami in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, the Spartans secured their 20th win of the season. It was quite an accomplishment for a team that was one of the least experienced (321st) and shortest (291st) in the nation according to KenPom.com.\n\n\n\nThe 2015-16 season was a milestone year both for Coach Izzo and the Spartans. Michigan State opened the year by winning its first 13 games, establishing a new school mark for best start to a season. When the Spartans defeated Boston College on November 26, Izzo became the 91st coach in NCAA history to record 500 career wins, with at least 10 seasons in Division I, and just the eighth coach to accomplish the feat in his first 21 seasons. He also became just the 18th coach to win 500 career games in his first collegiate head-coaching stop, and was the eighth-fastest coach to reach 500 wins among those who did it all at one school, accomplishing the feat in 699 games.\n\n\n\nOn December 7, MSU rose to No. 1 in the regular-season polls for just the fourth time in school history, and the third time under Izzo. The Spartans would hold the top spot for a school-record four weeks. Following a perfect 13-0 non-conference slate, Michigan State would finish second in the Big Ten with a 13-5 mark. A victory over Northwestern gave Izzo 513 for his career, moving past Purdue\u2019s Gene Keady for second-most wins at a Big Ten School, trailing only Bob Knight (662). In the Big Ten Tournament, the Spartans defeated Ohio State, Maryland and Purdue to become the first school in Big Ten history to hold five conference tournament titles. The Spartans earned a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament, where they were upset by No. 15 Middle Tennessee. MSU finished the season with a 29-6 record, matching the fourth-best win total in school history, as the Spartans\u2019 26 regular-season victories equaled a school record. Izzo\u2019s Spartans were the only team in the nation to win 27 or more games every year from 2011-12 to 2015-16.\n\n\n\nStatistically, the 2015-16 season was one of the most impressive in school history. Michigan State led the nation in 3-point field-goal percentage (.434), rebound margin (+11.4), assists per game (20.5) and total assists (719). The Spartans ranked in the top three in eight different categories, and in the Top 10 in 11 different categories. It marked the fifth time in Izzo\u2019s career that the Spartans led the nation in rebounding margin. MSU also set school single-season records for assists (719), 3-point field goals made (321) and blocked shots (177). The 719 assists were the 22nd-best total in NCAA history, while MSU recorded an assist on a nation\u2019s-best 71.3 percent of its field goals. At 79.8 points per game, the 2015-16 squad was the highest-scoring team of the Izzo era, and the highest-scoring team since 1985-86. In Big Ten Conference games, MSU led the conference in 12 stat categories and was ranked in the top three in 17 of the 21 stats.\n\n\n\nThe 2014-15 Spartans provided a lesson in resiliency and the power of togetherness. MSU opened the season ranked in the polls, but by Christmas, the Spartans had fallen out of the rankings. Following a home loss to Illinois on Feb. 7, the Spartans stood at 15-8, including just 6-4 in conference. MSU closed the regular season by winning six of its last eight games, including a final week that featured a come-from-behind home finale win over Purdue on Senior Day despite a first-half injury to Branden Dawson, and a regular-season finale victory at Indiana without Dawson. In the Big Ten Tournament, MSU defeated Ohio State and No. 8 Maryland before falling to No. 6 Wisconsin in overtime. The Spartans were disappointed to have let a championship opportunity slip away, but entered the NCAA Tournament on a mission.\n\n\n\nHaving entered March just hoping to secure a spot in the NCAA Tournament, the postseason run turned a good season into a great one. As the No. 7 seed, MSU opened with a victory over No. 10 Georgia. In the third round, MSU faced No. 2 Virginia for the second-straight season, defeating the Cavaliers to advance to a nation\u2019s-best seventh Sweet 16 in the last eight seasons. At the East Regional in Syracuse, the Spartans trailed at the half against both No. 3 Oklahoma in the Sweet 16 and No. 4 Louisville in the Elite Eight, before rallying for a pair of victories to reach the Final Four. Making its nation\u2019s-best seventh Final Four appearance in the last 17 seasons, MSU got off to a quick start against No. 1 Duke before falling to the eventual National Champion Blue Devils. MSU would finish 27-12, 12-6 in the Big Ten.\n\n\n\nThe senior class of 2015 finished tied for the second-winningest class in school history with 112 wins. The 2014-15 Spartans established school single-season records for assists (646) and blocks (176), while the 294 made 3-pointers were second-most in school history. Averaging 16.6 assists per game, the Spartans ranked fifth in the nation, while ranking seventh in assist-to-turnover ratio (1.5). Defensively, MSU posted a .396 field-goal percentage defense, marking the fourth-straight season that Spartan opponents shot less than 40 percent from the field.\n\n\n\nThe 2013-14 season was not short of highlights. It started early, with No. 2 MSU knocking off No. 1 Kentucky, 78-74, on Nov. 12 in Chicago, in what was the earliest game ever between No. 1 and No. 2. One week later, MSU ascended to No. 1 in the polls, a position it would hold for three weeks \u2013 establishing a school record at the time for the longest stay at No. 1. In late November, the Spartans captured the Coaches Vs. Cancer Tournament title in Brooklyn, marking MSU\u2019s first regular-season, neutral-site tournament championship since December 1998.\n\n\n\nInjuries proved to be a common storyline during the 2013-14 campaign, as six different players, including each one of MSU\u2019s top four scorers, missed multiple games due to injury or illness for a total of 29 games missed. In 19 of 38 games, including 13 of 18 Big Ten contests, the Spartans were without their full allotment of players due to injury. In nine games, Michigan State was without two of its regular rotation players. In total, 11 different Spartans started at least one game, as Izzo employed 15 different starting lineups. The fluctuation led to inconsistent results through much of the Big Ten slate, but by the end of the regular season, MSU was getting healthy.\n\n\n\nPlaying at full strength, the Spartans played at a different level in the postseason, steamrolling through the Big Ten Tournament. The championship game featured the third meeting of the season between in-state rivals Michigan State and Michigan, marking the first time the Spartans and Wolverines would meet in the conference tournament. Although UM won the two regular-season meetings, this was the first time MSU would feature a complete roster, pulling away early in the second half to capture the fourth tournament championship in school history with a 69-55 victory.\n\n\n\nMSU entered the NCAA Tournament as the No. 4 seed in the East Region, but was also a popular pick to advance to the Final Four and even cut down the championship nets. In the second round, Adreian Payne scored an MSU NCAA Tournament record 41 points to defeat Delaware, 93-78. Two days later, the Spartans advanced to the Sweet 16 with an 80-73 win over Harvard. Playing in the East Regional in New York City\u2019s Madison Square Garden, Michigan State defeated No. 1 seed Virginia, 61-59. In the Elite Eight, the Spartans held a nine-point lead in the second half against Connecticut, but the eventual National Champion Huskies would rally for a 60-54 victory.\n\n\n\nThe 2013-14 Spartans finished with a 29-9 record, including 12-6 in the Big Ten, finishing tied for second. The 29 wins tied for the fourth-best total in school history, while MSU established single-season school records for assists (637), made 3-point field goals (307), and blocks (174). Michigan State led the conference in field-goal percentage defense (.397), while ranking second in field-goal percentage (.474) and 3-point field-goal percentage (.392). The Spartans also finished with an all-time low 11.6 turnovers per contest.\n\n\n\nIn 2012-13, the Spartans collected a 27-9 record, including 13-5 in the Big Ten, against perhaps the nation\u2019s most difficult schedule, playing 13 games against ranked opponents. The slate was especially difficult down the stretch as 14 of MSU\u2019s last 18 games (postseason included) were against opponents that participated in the NCAA Tournament. Michigan State advanced to its 16th consecutive NCAA Tournament as the No. 3 seed in the Midwest Region, and advanced to the Sweet 16 for the fifth time in the last six seasons, tied for the most in the nation.\n\n\n\nOn Jan. 16, 2013, Izzo recorded his 200th conference victory against Penn State, joining Mike Krzyzewski (Duke) and Jim Boeheim (Syracuse) as the only active coaches in a power conference with 200 conference wins at their current school. In April, Izzo received the Wayman Tisdale Humanitarian Award, honoring an individual in college basketball who has made a significant impact on society.\n\n\n\nThe Spartans proved to be dominant defensively once again in 2012-13, pacing the Big Ten in field-goal percentage defense (.390) and steals (8.0 spg), while ranking second in scoring defense (59.1 ppg) and third in 3-point field-goal percentage defense (.300). MSU also continued to be strong on the glass, ranking second in the Big Ten and 10th in the nation with a +7.6 rebound margin, marking the 11th time that an Izzo-coached team ranked in the Top 10 in the nation.\n\n\n\nThe 2011-12 season was one of Izzo\u2019s most rewarding as head coach. The Spartans entered the season unranked, returning only two players who averaged more than 20 minutes a game the previous season. MSU opened the year with neutral-site losses to No. 1 North Carolina and No. 6 Duke, but responded with 15 straight victories, including road wins at No. 23 Gonzaga and No. 18 Wisconsin, marking the Spartans\u2019 first win in Madison since 2001. Keyed by a mid-February win at No. 3 Ohio State, MSU would go on to capture a share of the Big Ten regular-season championship, the seventh of the Izzo era, and head to the Big Ten Tournament where it defeated Ohio State to capture the third Big Ten Tournament title in school history, and the first since 2000. Michigan State was rewarded with a No. 1 seed in the West Region of the NCAA Tournament, where it would advance to the Sweet 16 for the 10th time in the last 15 years, good for second most in the nation. MSU would finish with a 29-8 record.\n\n\n\nStatistically, the Spartans finished the 2011-12 season ranked second in the nation in field-goal percentage defense (.379), the best effort by a Spartan squad since 1959. Once again, the Spartans were a dominant presence on the glass, ranking fifth in the nation in rebounding margin (+8.0), and pacing the Big Ten for the 12th time in the last 15 seasons, and the 13th time in his career.\n\n\n\nFor his efforts, Izzo was named the 2012 Big Ten Coach of the Year by both the league\u2019s media and coaches. He also was named Division I National Coach of the Year by the NABC, and was CBSSports.com\u2019s pick for national coach of the year as well.\n\n\n\nThe 2010-11 Spartans finished with a 19-15 mark and advanced to a 14th-straight NCAA Tournament. MSU faced a difficult regular-season schedule that included 18 of 33 games against the RPI Top 50 and 23 of 33 against the RPI Top 100.\n\n\n\nMichigan State turned in another great season in 2009-10, capturing a share of a second-straight Big Ten Championship and advancing to a sixth Final Four in 12 seasons. With MSU\u2019s 106-68 victory over UMass in the sixth game of the season, Izzo recorded his 341st victory, becoming Michigan State\u2019s all-time winningest coach. The Spartans opened Big Ten play with a school-best 9-0 start and captured a share of the regular-season crown with a 14-4 mark. Overall, MSU would finish with a 28-9 record.\n\n\n\nThe Spartans opened the 2010 NCAA Tournament as a No. 5 seed and advanced through the first weekend with narrow victories over New Mexico State (70-67) and Maryland (85-83). In the Midwest Regional, the Spartans won two more close games, defeating Northern Iowa (59-52) and Tennessee (70-69) to advance to the program\u2019s eighth Final Four and the sixth in the last 12 seasons under Izzo. Michigan State led the nation in rebounding margin for the fourth time in Izzo\u2019s career, out-rebounding opponents by a +8.6 margin.\n\n\n\nThe 2008-09 season was one of the best in the history of Spartan basketball. Michigan State advanced to its fifth Final Four in 11 seasons, becoming just the fifth school in the history of college basketball to accomplish that feat. During the regular season, the Spartans won the Big Ten Championship with a 15-3 league record, including a school-best 8-1 mark on the road. MSU won the league title by four games, equaling the second-greatest margin in conference history. Overall, Michigan State finished the season with a 31-7 record, the third-highest win total in school history. For his efforts, Izzo was named Big Ten Coach of the Year for the second time in his career.\n\n\n\nIn the NCAA Tournament, Michigan State advanced through the first weekend with wins over Robert Morris and USC. In the Sweet 16, the Spartans took out defending National Champion Kansas. In the Elite Eight, MSU beat No. 1 seed and No. 1 ranked Louisville, marking just the third victory over the top-ranked team in The Associated Press Top 25 in school history. At the Final Four in Detroit\u2019s Ford Field, the Spartans beat No. 1 seed Connecticut before eventually falling to North Carolina in the title game.\n\n\n\nMichigan State led the nation in rebounding margin for the third time in Izzo\u2019s career, out-rebounding opponents by a +9.3 margin. It marked the eighth time that an Izzo-coached team ranked in the top 10 in the nation. The Spartans also proved to possess a high-powered attack, leading the Big Ten in scoring offense (72.0 ppg).\n\n\n\nIzzo directed Michigan State to a 27-9 record in 2007-08. The season finished with a trip to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament, marking MSU\u2019s seventh trip to the regionals in the last 11 years. The 27 wins marked the fifth-largest total in school history at the time, while the 24 regular-season victories were the then third-largest regular-season total for MSU. The Spartans were a perfect 17-0 at home, good for the first perfect home season since 2001 and the fourth in Breslin Center history.\n\n\n\nThe 2007-08 Spartans led the Big Ten in rebounding margin (+6.8). In league games, MSU paced the conference in field-goal percentage (.474) for the fifth-straight season, becoming the first school in league history to accomplish that feat.\n\n\n\nMichigan State finished with a 23-12 mark in 2006-07. The Spartans had to overcome a large amount of adversity and a very difficult Big Ten schedule to advance to a 10th-straight NCAA Tournament. The Spartans also did something for the first time in school history \u2013 recording Michigan State\u2019s first home win over a No. 1-ranked team, with a 64-55 decision over Wisconsin.\n\n\n\nThe 2006-07 Spartans excelled by getting back to basics \u2013 rebounding and defense. On the glass, the Spartans led the Big Ten in rebounding margin (+7.0). Defensively, MSU allowed opponents just 57.2 points per game, the lowest total since the 1951-52 squad allowed 56.0 points. Opponents also shot just 38.4 percent from the field, the lowest percentage since 1958-59 (.379). Nationally, the Spartans ranked sixth in scoring defense and field-goal percentage defense and eighth in rebounding margin.\n\n\n\nIn 2005-06, Michigan State finished with a 22-12 mark. The Spartans played one of the nation\u2019s toughest schedules, playing more games against teams ranked in the RPI top-25 (13) and top-50 (18) than any other school. In Big Ten games, MSU led the conference in five stat categories including free-throw percentage (.781), field-goal percentage (.469), rebounding defense (30.1), rebounding margin (+4.2) and assists (15.81 apg).\n\n\n\nMichigan State returned to the Final Four in 2005, becoming the only team to appear in four Final Fours between 1999 and 2005. The Spartans finished the season with a 26-7 mark, including 22-5 in the regular season. Since joining the Big Ten, only three Spartan teams finished the regular season with fewer losses.\n\n\n\nIn the NCAA Tournament, MSU defeated No. 1 Duke and No. 2 Kentucky in the Austin Regional, becoming the first team in tournament history to defeat the Blue Devils and the Wildcats in the same year. Despite losing to North Carolina in the Final Four, Izzo was named the 2005 Clair Bee Award winner, recognizing the Division I men\u2019s basketball coach who has made the most significant positive contribution to his sport.\n\n\n\nNot only did the 2004-05 Spartans win, they were also statistically impressive, ranking in the top 15 nationally in six statistical categories, including free-throw percentage (3rd, .777), scoring margin (7th, +13.1), assists per game (10th, 17.1 apg), field-goal percentage (11th, .487), rebound margin (11th, +6.8) and scoring offense (13th, 78.5 ppg). MSU led the Big Ten in scoring for the second-straight year with 78.5 points per game \u2013 its highest scoring average since 1985-86 (83.1 ppg).\n\n\n\nDuring the season, Izzo recorded his 232nd win at MSU, moving past Benjamin Van Alstyne for the second most number of career wins in Spartan coaching history. In the summer of 2005, Izzo traveled to Kuwait to take part in \u201cOperation Hardwood - Hoops With The Troops.\u201d Izzo was one of eight coaches and sports personalities coaching 13-member military basketball teams on Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, from Aug. 27-31. Camp Arifjan defeated the other bases to win the championship under the direction of Coach Izzo. Izzo made a return trip to Kuwait in May 2006.\n\n\n\nIn 2003-04, MSU opened the season with a 5-7 mark after taking on one of the most difficult non-conference schedules in NCAA history. Rather than give up, Izzo and the Spartans rallied to win 12 of the next 15 games, finishing just one game out of first place in the Big Ten at 12-4. For the year, MSU posted an 18-12 mark. Michigan State became the first team in Big Ten history to lead the conference in scoring offense (71.3 ppg), field-goal percentage (.522), 3-point field-goal percentage (.434) and free-throw percentage (.777) in the same season.\n\n\n\nOn Feb. 4, 2004, MSU defeated Iowa, 89-72, as Izzo recorded the 200th victory of his Spartan career, becoming just the third coach in MSU history to accomplish that feat. He also became the eighth head coach in NCAA history to record 200 wins in his first nine seasons. Ten days later, Izzo became just the third coach in Big Ten history to record 100 league wins in his first nine seasons, joining Bob Knight and Gene Keady as MSU defeated Minnesota, 69-58, on Feb. 14.\n\n\n\nThe 2002-03 season was a study in perseverance. Izzo rallied his team to win the final four regular-season games and eight of the last 10 conference games to finish 10-6 in the Big Ten, good for third place in the league. Michigan State made even bigger noise during the NCAA Tournament. The No. 7 seed Spartans easily dismissed Colorado in the first round, setting up a matchup with the No. 2 seed Florida Gators. The Spartans shocked many experts with a 68-46 victory in the Gators\u2019 home state. In the Sweet 16, MSU defeated defending national champion Maryland in a thrilling two-point game, before eventually falling to the No. 1 seed Texas Longhorns in the Lone Star State.\n\n\n\nThe Elite Eight appearance was the fourth for MSU between 1999 and 2003. During that time period, no other school made more than two trips. In fact, since the NCAA Tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985, just six programs (Duke, Florida, Kentucky, Michigan State, North Carolina and UNLV) have advanced to four Elite Eights in any five-year period.\n\nThe 2001-02 season may prove to be one of Izzo\u2019s finest. Despite losing 81 percent of the scoring load from 2000-01, and having three key players miss several games with injuries, Izzo led the Spartans to a 10-6 Big Ten mark (19-12 overall), finishing just one game out of first place. MSU won 10 of the last 13 regular-season games and earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament.\n\n\n\nIn 2000-01, Izzo earned NABC National Coach of the Year and District 11 Coach of the Year honors for leading MSU to its third straight Final Four and fourth straight regular-season Big Ten Championship. MSU became just the fourth school in Big Ten history to win four-straight league titles.\n\n\n\nMSU opened the season by winning its first 12 games to establish the best start in school history. On Dec. 25, 2000, the Spartans earned the top spot in The Associated Press Top 25, marking the first time they held the No. 1 position in the AP Poll since 1979. In Big Ten action, Michigan State posted a 13-3 record to win a share of the league crown. The Big Ten finale vs. Michigan marked Izzo\u2019s 100th Big Ten game. Through his first 100 games, Izzo posted a 72-28 mark, the fifth-best record in Big Ten history.\n\n\n\nIn the 2001 NCAA Tournament, Izzo guided the Spartans to a third-straight Final Four. For a third consecutive season, Michigan State earned a No. 1 seed. MSU won the first three games by double figures, establishing a record with nine straight NCAA Tournament victories by double digits. When MSU defeated Temple, 69-62, in the South Regional Final, the Spartans became just the ninth school to reach three-straight Final Fours and just the third since the NCAA Tournament field expanded to 64 teams in 1985. On the season, MSU finished with a 28-5 record.\n\n\n\nMichigan State led the nation in rebound margin for the second straight season at +15.4 boards per game, tying the fifth-largest margin in Division I history (greatest since 1980). The Spartans also ranked 13th in the nation in scoring defense (61.8 ppg).\n\n\n\nIn 1999-2000, Michigan State captured the second NCAA Championship in school history and its third straight regular season Big Ten Championship. MSU also won at least 30 games for the second straight season, posting a 32-7 mark, becoming just the second Big Ten school to accomplish that feat. The 65 wins over the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 seasons were the greatest two-year total in the history of the Big Ten. MSU also repeated as Big Ten Tournament champions.\n\n\n\nIzzo led MSU to consecutive Final Fours for the first time in school history. For his efforts, Izzo was named USBWA District V Coach of the Year and NABC District 11 Coach of the Year. Izzo also recorded his 100th career victory in a Jan. 11, 2000, 77-71 overtime win over Indiana in the Breslin Center.\n\n\n\nFor the second consecutive season, Michigan State earned a No. 1 seed in the Midwest Region of the NCAA Tournament. After disposing of Valparaiso and Utah in Cleveland, the Spartans moved on to the Sweet 16 at the Palace of Auburn Hills, where they recorded come-from-behind victories versus Syracuse and Iowa State. In the Final Four, MSU defeated Wisconsin for the fourth time that season. The Spartans then captured their second NCAA title in school history, defeating Florida, 89-76.\n\n\n\nIn 1998-99, Izzo directed the Spartans on a magical run to the program\u2019s first appearance in the NCAA Final Four since 1979. Michigan State posted a record of 33-5, establishing a school record for most wins in a season. For his efforts, Izzo was named the Basketball Times National Coach of the Year and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) District 11 Coach of the Year. Throughout the Big Ten season, Michigan State established itself as the class program of the conference. Izzo directed the school to its second-straight Big Ten title. The Spartans followed up a 15-1 Big Ten regular season by capturing their first Big Ten Tournament championship. The 15 league wins tied a school record for most victories in conference play, while the Spartans\u2019 93.8 winning percentage established a school record.\n\n\n\nWhereas MSU\u2019s success in 1998-99 was expected, the Spartans took the college basketball world by storm in 1997-98. Izzo became the first MSU coach to earn Associated Press National Coach of the Year honors, leading MSU to a 22-8 record and a share of the Big Ten title. The Spartans posted a 13-3 mark in conference, earning Izzo Big Ten Coach of the Year honors.\n\n\n\nOver the course of the 1997-98 season, Izzo and his team finished the year ranked No. 10 nationally by USA Today/ESPN, marking the first time the Spartans had finished in the Top 10 since 1995. In addition to his AP award, Izzo was named National Coach of the Year by Basketball News and the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA). Basketball Times selected Izzo as its Mideast Coach of the Year.\n\n\n\nDuring Izzo\u2019s first season as head coach in 1995-96, he directed the Green and White to an overall slate of 16-16, including 9-9 in the Big Ten. Izzo recorded four wins over Top 25 teams. In 1996-97, Izzo guided the Green and White cagers to an overall mark of 17-12, including a Big Ten ledger of 9-9. Izzo led the Spartans to the second round of the NIT in each of his first two seasons.\n\n\n\nIn his 40th season as a member of the MSU coaching staff, Izzo has been with the Spartan program since taking a part-time assistant coaching position in 1983. An assistant coach with the Spartans from 1983-86, Izzo left MSU in May of 1986 to become the top assistant and recruiting coordinator at Tulsa. But, on June 10 of the same year, Izzo returned to East Lansing when Spartan assistant Mike Deane left to become head coach at Siena College.\n\n\n\nKnown as a tireless worker both on the recruiting trail and in the office, his hard work and loyalty were rewarded in July 1990, when Jud Heathcote appointed him associate head coach. His dutiful efforts were further recognized when, on March 30, 1993, then-MSU Athletics Director Merrily Dean Baker recommended both a one-year contract extension for Heathcote through the 1994-95 season and that Izzo be appointed head coach upon Jud\u2019s retirement. The MSU Board of Trustees accepted both recommendations on April 9, 1994.\n\nIzzo originally came to MSU from Northern Michigan, where he had been an assistant from 1979-83. He was named a part-time assistant at MSU in September 1983. When former assistant Edgar Wilson left in November 1983, Izzo became a full-time assistant.\n\n\n\nIzzo played guard for NMU\u2019s basketball team from 1973-77, and was voted the team\u2019s MVP as a senior. He was also a third-team Division II All-America pick that year and established the Wildcat record for most minutes played in a season. Following his graduation from NMU in 1977, Izzo took over as head coach at Ishpeming High School and served in that position for the 1977-78 campaign.\n\n\n\nA native of Iron Mountain, Michigan, Izzo and former NFL head coach Steve Mariucci were Iron Mountain High School teammates in football, basketball, baseball and track. As college roommates at Northern Michigan, Izzo walked on to the basketball team, while Mariucci did the same with football. Both would go on to earn Division II All-America honors. Despite their busy schedules, they remain the closest of friends. For 10 years, they co-hosted a golf tournament in Iron Mountain to raise money for the community, including a fitness center for the high school.\n\n\n\nIn 1990, Izzo was inducted into the Northern Michigan University Hall of Fame and was selected as an inductee into the Upper Peninsula Hall of Fame during the summer of 1998. He was inducted into the National Italian-American Sports Hall of Fame in 2011, and the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 2015. He received the sport\u2019s ultimate honor when his election into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame was announced on April 4, 2016. He was officially enshrined in Springfield, Massachusetts, on Sept. 9, 2016.\n\n\n\nIn 2001, Izzo received honorary degrees from both Northern Michigan and Michigan State, delivering the commencement address at both graduation ceremonies.\n\n\n\nIzzo is also an active volunteer in the community. Among his many efforts, he is very active with Coaches Vs. Cancer, Volunteers of America and Sparrow Hospital. In 2009, Izzo was presented the Coaches Vs. Cancer Champion Award, recognizing his work and leadership in the fight to save lives from cancer.\n\n\n\nIzzo and his wife, Lupe, created the Izzo Legacy Fund in 2019 to formalize their commitment to the Mid-Michigan community. The Izzo Legacy Fund helps to raise money and contributions to charitable causes in the area.\n\n\n\nIzzo was born Jan. 30, 1955. His family includes his wife, Lupe, daughter, Raquel, and son, Steven.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.theonlycolors.com/2021/6/7/22522682/michigan-state-spartans-mens-basketball-announces-several-staff-changes", "page_content": "For the first time in a while, Michigan State Spartans men\u2019s basketball head coach Tom Izzo is shaking up his staff a bit. MSU announced several staff changes to the 2021-2022 staff, including bringing back several former players.\n\nWe are excited to announce some updates to our 2021-22 staff \u2014 Michigan State Basketball (@MSU_Basketball) June 7, 2021\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very excited to make the announcement for our staff for next season,\u201d Izzo said in a press release. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve had some change in our staff in a while, but I think we have some great experience and it means even more when former players want to return to campus to be a part of building our future.\n\n\u201cDwayne Stephens is one of our mainstays and will remain as our associate head coach while overseeing the entire staff and bringing together a group I am really excited to work with as we start the new season.\u201d\n\nWhile Stephens remains as associate head coach, and Mike Garland remains as the other assistant coach, Doug Wojcik moves into the third assistant coaching role. Wojcik takes over for Dane Fife, who left to take an assistant coaching job with the Indiana Hoosiers.\n\nWojcik being promoted to assistant coach was reported back in April, but is now official. Wojcik spent the past three seasons with the Spartans as recruiting coordinator. He previously served as an assistant coach on Izzo\u2019s staff for two seasons from 2003 through 2005, and helped lead the Spartans to a 2005 Final Four appearance. He went on to become head coach of Tulsa from 2005 through 2012, and then head coach at the College of Charleston from 2012 until August of 2014, when Wojcik was fired after an investigation into allegations that he verbally abused his players. Despite the allegations, Wojcik is a trusted member of Izzo\u2019s staff.\n\nAs recruiting coordinator, Wojcik was instrumental in helping Michigan State earn a national top-10 class in 2021, which includes Max Christie, Jaden Akins and Pierre Brooks II. Christie and Brooks both recently earned Gatorade Player of the Year honors in their respective states.\n\n\u201cDoug has been a vital part of our success over the last three years since he returned to East Lansing,\u201d Izzo said. \u201cAs our director of recruiting, he was the lead for us with an incoming recruiting class that is among the top in the nation. I\u2019ve known Doug for more than 20 years and he\u2019s one of the best basketball minds I know. It was natural for him to move into our assistant coaching position when that opened. He\u2019s got tremendous experience, is a man of incredible character and has a work ethic that is unmatched.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, former Spartan player and assistant coach Mark Montgomery returns to the program. He will take over Wojcik\u2019s old post as recruiting coordinator, which is quite frankly an excellent hire by Izzo.\n\nMontgomery played at MSU for Jud Heathcote from 1988 through 1992. After playing professionally in Europe for a few years, Montgomery got his start as an assistant coach at Central Michigan for then head coach Jay Smith. Montgomery then returned to his alma mater in East Lansing in 2001 and stayed through the 2011 season. He helped guide MSU to Final Four appearances in 2005, 2009 and 2010. Montgomery went on take the head coaching job at Northern Illinois in 2011, but was fired in January 2021.\n\n\u201cWhen we knew we were going to have openings on the staff after last season, Monty was one of the guys I had in mind,\u201d Izzo said. \u201cHe played here under Jud and was on my staff for 10 years when we really got things going. As a head coach for 10 years and someone who has more than 20 years of experience recruiting in college basketball, he will be a great fit for us as a recruiting coordinator.\u201d\n\nTwo former Spartan players who played for Izzo are also making a return to Michigan State. As we covered last week, Austin Thornton joins the staff as video coordinator, taking over for Drew Denisco who departed to take an assistant coaching job at Eastern Michigan. Meanwhile, Matt McQuaid is coming on as assistant director of basketball operations.\n\n\u201cAustin Thornton is one of the hardest working and most humble players I have coached during my time at Michigan State,\u201d Izzo said. \u201cI loved having him on staff as a graduate assistant and he\u2019s worked really hard on the high school level to get himself ready to take a college job. It\u2019s great to have him back.\u201d\n\nThornton most recently served as head coach for the freshman and varsity boys basketball teams at Sparta High School in Michigan. He played for MSU from 2007 through 2012 and was a two-time team captain, while being a part of teams that reached two Final Fours and won three Big Ten Championships. He also served as a graduate assistant for Izzo from 2015 through 2017.\n\nMcQuaid was a captain as a senior for the 2019 Michigan State Final Four team, and earned honorable mention All-Big Ten and Big Ten All-Defensive Team honors that season. He was also part of Michigan State squads that won back-to-back Big Ten regular season titles in 2018 and 2019, and two Big Ten Tournament titles in 2016 and 2019.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited to have Matt back with us and he really is excited to be on staff and start his professional career,\u201d Izzo said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be a great addition and someone who can relate to our players. I think this is the start of what could be a great career for Matt.\u201d\n\nAs assistant director of basketball operations, McQuaid will now work under Garrett Briningstool who takes over for David Thomas as director of operations. Briningstool, who spent the past two seasons as Izzo\u2019s executive assistant, will also serve as chief of staff. The Spartans also announced Julian Stall as director of creative video after working with MSU Athletics Spartan Vision the past four years.\n\nAs for Thomas, who was a member of the 2000 Michigan State men\u2019s basketball national championship team, he is leaving the program after six seasons. Thomas is moving on to work at Podium Risk Management, \u201cone of the leading brands in financial services with a concentrated focus on serving professional athletes.\u201d Paul Davis, another former Spartan standout basketball player, is a partner at the company.\n\nIzzo is sad to see Thomas leave, but excited for his future:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bittersweet to see DT leave, but I\u2019m also very happy for him, Toni and his family,\u201d Izzo said. \u201cHe\u2019s been such a big part of our program for the last 20 years, first with a successful playing career here and being part of three Final Four teams, four Big Ten Championships, and, of course, a national championship team. Over the last six seasons, since he returned as our director of operations, he has been one of the faces for our program and someone everyone immediately recognizes and loves for the person he is. We\u2019re really going to miss his presence around here, but know that he\u2019ll be back and that he is, truly, forever a Spartan.\u201d\n\nFull staff changes:"}, {"url": "https://spartanswire.usatoday.com/gallery/every-michigan-state-basketball-player-drafted-to-the-nba-under-tom-izzo/", "page_content": "After last night\u2019s NBA draft, Michigan State basketball has had a remarkable 22 players drafted during head coach Tom Izzo\u2019s tenure. Xavier Tillman was taken No. 35 overall by the Memphis Grizzlies (reuniting with Jaren Jackson Jr.) and Cassius Winston was taken No. 53 overall by the Washington Wizards.\n\nWhat Izzo has built at Michigan State is quite impressive, and he has routinely helped players elevate their profile and attract the attention of NBA players. Not every player has necessarily panned out in the NBA, but they at least gained the opportunity. Some, like Draymond Green, have exceeded expectations.\n\nBelow, we take a look at every Spartan who has been drafted under the watchful eye of Tom Izzo.\n\nJamie Feick: 1996, Round 2, Pick No. 48 by the Philadelphia 76ers New Jersey Nets forward Jamie Feick (R) and Portland Trailblazers center Arvydas Sabonis (L) fight for\u2026 New Jersey Nets forward Jamie Feick (R) and Portland Trailblazers center Arvydas Sabonis (L) fight for a rebound in the first quarter 08 March, 2000 at Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, NJ. more \u00a9 MATT CAMPBELL/AFP via Getty Images | March 8, 2000 Share Share this image gallery on Facebook on Twitter via text message via email https://spartanswire.usatoday.com/gallery/every-michigan-state-basketball-player-drafted-to-the-nba-under-tom-izzo/\n\nMateen Cleaves: 2000, Round 1, Pick No. 14 by the Detroit Pistons Mateen Cleaves #24 of the Detroit Pistons during the game against the Los Angeles Clippers at\u2026 Mateen Cleaves #24 of the Detroit Pistons during the game against the Los Angeles Clippers at the STAPLES Center in Los Angeles, California.

During that time, he has guided the Spartans to almost unprecedented highs, made MSU a national brand and has impacted probably as many lives off of the court as his teams have scored points on it. But even a great man and incredibly successful head coach like Izzo will one day face an opponent that even he won\u2019t be able to outmaneuver \u2014 Father Time himself.\n\nThis formidable foe reminded college basketball of his power most recently when three prominent head coaches in Mike Krzyzewski (following the end of the 2021-2022 season), Roy Williams and Lon Kruger called it quits in a matter of just a few months. These are men who have left their mark on this game in a similar manner or even more so than Izzo did, and they are also the reason why he had to face some questions regarding his own future lately. Much to the excitement of Spartan Nation, though, Izzo was quick to debunk any retirement talk, stating that he has \u201cno intentions in following in some of my compadres\u2018 footsteps\u201d and that he is \u201ca little leery of where our profession is going right now,\u201d but that he has a lot of \u201clove for my job.\u201d\n\nNow the ultimate goal for Izzo is clear as well, and he has said on numerous occasions that he wants to chase that elusive second national championship. Recently he also made it clear that he feels as good physically as he has in about 10 years \u2014 using the downtime during the COVID lockdown to get in better shape \u2014 and that he will only ponder retirement when he doesn\u2019t love what he is doing anymore. While that point seems to be quite a few years away, there is no denying the toll that college basketball takes on a man north of 60 years old (Izzo is 66 years old right now).\n\nIn addition to the actual games, there are things to consider, like flights all across the country, recruiting, keeping up with high school and college students, the practices, the media obligations and many more activities that the public rarely even recognizes. All of these things aren\u2019t only time-consuming, but for a man like Izzo who is heavily invested emotionally in many of his endeavors and into the people he is dealing with, this lifestyle is married with an enormous amount of stress and mental sacrifice. Whoever wants to get an idea of that just has to look at Izzo\u2019s Grand Canyon of eye bags every March when he probably gets about 20 minutes of sleep and studies as much film on a nightly basis as all Academy Award judges in the history of the Oscars combined. If they actually watch the films that is, of course.\n\nYet as of now, luckily for every Spartan, Izzo is enjoying every minute of his job and still has a lot of basketball, accomplishments and years in front of him. With some big names from the coaching profession leaving the sport in recent years, it might be interesting to look at some of them and how they did with their teams after the age of 66. Did age cause them to not win as many games with their teams, or is age also just a number for superstar head coaches?\n\nIs there any limit on where coaches can seriously win in college basketball? Or is it possible for coaches to win big north of the age of 70, maybe? How does Izzo compare to the guys he has battled for many years and who are comparable with him in the sense of their major accomplishments and longevity?\n\nHere is a partial list of the \u201cold\u201d guard and how they did in the \u201ctwilight years\u201d of their careers, if you will. While the situations, of course, aren\u2019t exactly comparable due to roster differences and varying circumstances, it should still nonetheless tell us a bit about what we might expect in the next few years, and that age shouldn\u2019t be a factor, per se, in determining Izzo\u2019s capability of guiding a successful program.\n\nMike Krzyzewski (74 years old)\n\nEver heard of that guy? Following the 2021-2022 season, Coach K is leaving college basketball as one of the most iconic figures that the sport has ever seen, and also as one of its most accomplished coaches. After his age-66 season, he still guided the Duke Blue Devils for eight more seasons and even won a national title when he was 68 years old. On average, Krzyzewski won 26.6 games in the last eight years of his career, even though that number is slightly affected by his last COVID-shortened campaign in 2020-2021. He also reached two Elite Eights and one Sweet Sixteen during that stretch.\n\nRoy Williams (71 years old)\n\nRoy Williams has coached two big time programs during his career with the Kansas Jayhawks and most recently the North Carolina Tar Heels. He like Coach K also won a national championship towards the end of his career (the last of his three) when he was 66 years old. Over the course of his last five seasons in Chapel Hill he averaged 23.6 wins per year, a number clearly affected by the 2019-20 campain where the Tar Heels only amassed 14 wins. Last year UNC also just got 18 wins in total and bowed out in the first year of the NCAAs.\n\nJim Boeheim (76 years old)\n\nBoeheim\u2019s case is a hard one to judge since there are plenty of wins taken away from him in regard to certain NCAA sanctions. Yet, the Syracuse legend still managed to stay extremely steady in recent years, never finishing with less than 18 wins since 2010. While he \u201conly\u201c averaged 21.6 wins over that period, he had remarkable success in the postseason, constantly outperforming his seed with the Orange. Syracuse made two Final Fours, one Elite Eight and two Sweet Sixteens during the last decade. Boeheim has no plans to retire anytime soon.\n\nJim Calhoun (79 years old)\n\nAfter retiring from his position at UConn in 2012 due to fighting spinal stenosis, Calhoun started to coach again in 2018 at the University of Saint Joseph, a Division III school. In regard to Izzo, his last four seasons with the Huskies are fairly interesting since they represented exactly the age years that Izzo is entering now. Calhoun twice won over 30 games and twice finished with 18 wins. He won a national championship in 2011 at the age of 69 and reached another Final Four two years prior, losing to Michigan State in the semifinals in Detroit \u2014 fun to remember for every Spartan.\n\nBob Knight (80 years old)\n\n\u201cThe general\u201c only coached for one-and-a-half seasons after his 66th birthday, and while his last days at Texas Tech didn\u2019t come close to his legendary achievements with Indiana decades earlier, Knight certainly lifted the Red Raiders out of their conference\u2019s basement. His last full season had Knight win 21 games and lose with TTU in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. All in all, Knight coached for 42 seasons, winning 902 games.\n\nLon Kruger (69 years old)\n\nKruger hasn\u2019t won a national championship during his career, but he still created an impressive legacy that also saw him coach in the NBA for a few years. Kruger spent the last three years of his career at Oklahoma and he guided the Sooners to 20, 19 and 16 wins, respectively, after his 66th birthday. He reached the NCAA Tournament twice and most likely would have participated with his team if the 2020 Tourney wouldn\u2019t have been cancelled.\n\nHow does Izzo compare?\n\nThere were other big names coaches like Dean Smith, who retired at the age of 66, or Adolph Rupp who coached six more seasons successfully at Kentucky, averaging 22.8 wins during a time where there were fewer games overall. Rupp also guided his team into three Elite Eights and two Sweet Sixteens during that stretch.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting in regard to Izzo is that in terms of his total number of seasons, he hasn\u2019t been active as long as many of the other legendary coaches. He sits in 45th place overall with 643 wins in 26 seasons, yet of all the coaches in front of him, only Bill Self (28 years, 729 wins) and John Wooden (29 years, 664 wins) have been a head coach for less than 30 years. Meanwhile, 14 coaches have exceeded 40 seasons of coaching and Phog Allen even coached for 50 years while also overseeing the football and baseball programs at Kansas for a few years. Interestingly, the six coaches coming in behind Izzo on the list also have all coached for more than 30 years.\n\nNow as mentioned earlier, these numbers don\u2019t really mean a lot to the individual, but they still show that many men had tremendous success in college basketball not only after their 66th birthday, but also after their 26th season in the profession.\n\nIzzo also seems to still get plenty of strong recruits and is just a few years removed from a Final Four season. A lot can change in the future of course and you\u2019ll never know what circumstances might impact his decision for retirement one day. But all in all, age shouldn\u2019t prevent Tom Izzo from anything he wants to do in East Lansing and certainly won\u2019t keep him from continuing to do all the great things he has done for the majority of 26 years now. And no matter how many years are still to come, Spartan Nation should and most likely will be grateful for every single one."}, {"url": "https://heavy.com/sports/2019/03/tom-izzo-how-many-national-championships/", "page_content": "One of college basketball\u2019s most well-known postseason coaches, Tom Izzo has overseen the Michigan State Spartans for 24 years. Without a losing record to his name, Izzo has guided the Spartans to a winning percentage 72.4% over his career to go along with six Big Ten Tournament championships and nine regular-season Big Ten championships.\n\nPlay\n\nHighlights: Winston Leads MSU to B1G Tourney Title | Michigan State vs. Michigan | March 17, 2019 Matt McQuaid scored a career-high 27 points, Cassius Winston converted the go-ahead layup in the closing minute, and Michigan State rallied to beat Michigan 65-60 for its sixth Big Ten Tournament championship.

One of the more impressive stats is the fact that Izzo has only missed the NCAA tournament twice during his 24-year reign \u2013 both in his first two seasons.\n\nNational Championships: 1 (2000)\n\nFinal Four Appearances: 7 (1999, 2000, 2001, 2005, 2009, 2010, 2015)\n\nNCAA Tournament Appearances: 22\n\nConsidering the number of times Izzo has not only made the tournament but advanced Michigan State to the Final Four, it is a bit of a surprise to see that Izzo only has one national championship that came nearly two decades ago. However, Izzo has the 2018-2019 group clicking on all cylinders heading into an Elite Eight showdown with national powerhouse and top overall seed Duke.\n\nTom Izzo & Michigan State\u2019s Chances Against Duke\n\nWhile Duke comes into the matchup a little banged up (Cam Reddish) and on the heels of two VERY close calls to UCF and then Virginia Tech, they still possess the single most influential player in the NCAA. Zion Williamson has been stellar in the tournament, averaging 26.7 points, 6.7 rebounds, and 1.7 assists per game. On the defensive side, Williamson is averaging over a block and steal per game.\n\nPlay\n\nVideo Video related to tom izzo national championships: how many titles has coach won? 2019-03-31T16:15:45-04:00\n\nWilliamson\u2019s size and athleticism make him a nightmare matchup for any program and the fact that MSU\u2019s Nick Ward is limited to coming off the bench will be an issue. While by no means as athletic as Zion, Ward is a very sturdy body down low and possesses the lateral quickness to be a problem on the defensive side. There really isn\u2019t any stopping Zion but Izzo and Michigan State will need Ward to put up some monster defensive minutes off the bench should he draw the task of matching up with Zion.\n\nUCF and Virginia Tech showed off the blueprint to take down Duke \u2013 sag off the three-point line, collapse on Zion, and force Duke\u2019s other players to beat you. Duke doesn\u2019t have the necessary three-point shooting to spread the floor which has resulted in a tough time for anyone outside of Zion to get going. RJ Barrett had a stronger second half against VT but has still shown to be incredibly inconsistent as a shooter and has been forced into taking more mid-range jumpers.\n\nThat said, slowing down Duke\u2019s offense is only one part of the equation. While they are typically comfortable pushing the pace in transition and outscoring their opponents, Duke has the skillset to lock down defensively and make life miserable on their opponents. With Tre Jones harassing opposing point guards up and down the court and Zion flying around on help defense, Duke forces a ton of turnovers and teams are often scared to go inside with Zion lurking.\n\nIt will be a tough task for Michigan State but things all start with keeping Zion Williamson in check. If they can do that, Michigan State might just be able to exploit Duke\u2019s weaknesses and come away with the win."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/34384882/michigan-state-men-college-basketball-coach-tom-izzo-gets-new-5-year-31-million-deal", "page_content": "Michigan State has signed men's college basketball coach Tom Izzo to a new five-year deal valued at $6.2 million per season, giving him about $2 million more each year.\n\nThe school announced the deal Thursday, saying the rollover contract will need to be approved by its board next month.\n\n\"We greatly appreciate Coach Izzo's commitment to our outstanding university and his competitive drive to keep Spartan basketball as a national powerhouse,\" university president Samuel Stanley said in a statement.\n\nIzzo, who was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016, won a national championship in 2000 and leads all active coaches with eight Final Four appearances.

He\u2019s got tremendous experience, is a man of incredible character and has a work ethic that is unmatched.\"\n\nMontgomery was an All-Big Ten guard in his playing days at Michigan State and served as an assistant from 2001-11 before leaving to become the head coach at Northern Illinois. During his 10 seasons on Izzo\u2019s staff, Michigan State made 10 straight trips to the NCAA Tournament and reached three Final Fours.\n\n\u201cWhen we knew we were going to have openings on the staff after last season, Monty was one of the guys I had in mind,\u201d Izzo said. \u201cHe played here under Jud and was on my staff for 10 years when we really got things going. As a head coach for 10 years and someone who has more than 20 years of experience recruiting in college basketball, he will be a great fit for us as a recruiting coordinator.\"\n\nThornton played from 2007-12 and was part of two Final Four teams and won three Big Ten titles.

For some, this move might have raised a few eyebrows as a quick look at the 2022-2023 roster chart already shows three point guards on the team in A.J. Hoggard, Jaden Akins and Tyson Walker. Now, barring any early departures or transfers, this is looking like a bit of a logjam \u2014 except that it really isn\u2019t a logjam.\n\nMichigan State head coach Tom Izzo always had a soft spot for two-point guard lineups and is now really putting some bodies behind that strategy. Our friend Sam Tyler already dove into this specific way of building a roster within his fantastic write up on Holloman and now we want to dive in even a little further. True to the motto: One point guard is good, two might be better.\n\nRecent history shows that playing two point guards is the way to go\n\nEver since his lone national championship at Michigan State, Izzo was open to playing two playmakers together. Some guys by the name of Mateen Cleaves and Charlie Bell might have had something to do with that, and Izzo let other prominent combinations follow throughout the years. Drew Neitzel played a lot with Travis Walton, who then stood side by side in many battles with Kalin Lucas. Korie Lucious not only stepped up for the injured star, he also played plenty of minutes together with Lucas. Travis Trice lined up next to Lourawls \u201cTum Tum\u201d Nairn and went all the way to a Final Four. Denzel Valentine was like a second point guard, too, and even when Izzo had the privilege of coaching the once-in-a-generation type talent of Cassius Winston, he paired him with the likes of Nairn or Foster Loyer from time to time (just not as often).\n\nNow the thinking of using two playmakers as an advantage is of course a lot older than Izzo\u2019s tenure and has been a part of basketball forever. But this strategy and roster makeup has put its stamp on the college basketball landscape more than ever in recent years, as the latest champions show.\n\nSix of the last seven national champions featured a heavy dose of lineups featuring two point guards, proving the point that it certainly is a way to big time success on the NCAA level. UConn\u2019s 2014 team under Kevin Ollie featured two diminutive guards in Shabazz Napier and Ryan Boatright, both more than capable of running the point. The Huskies were followed by a Duke Blue Devils team that ran out a senior Quinn Cook and freshman Tyus Jones. Jay Wright\u2019s first title with Villanova the next year came on the shoulders of Jalen Brunson and Ryan Arcidiacono running the backcourt. After the Wildcats, North Carolina relied heavily on Joel Berry, but also had Nate Britt playing almost 20 minutes per night.\n\nThen in 2018, it was Villanova again with Jalen Brunson as a junior, one of the few players in the last decade who truly handled the point guard position and the entire team all by himself. Virginia followed with plenty of lineups featuring two playmakers, mostly its team leader Ty Jerome and rookie Kihei Clark who played 26.8 minutes per game. Last, but not least, the Baylor Bears in 2021 made use of multiple point guards in Jared Butler and Davion Mitchell, both almost interchangeable on both ends of the court.\n\nHow two-point guard lineups can work\u2026 and how they can\u2019t\n\nNow unlike some of the other teams mentioned, Baylor had the luxury of really being able to mix and match its backcourt from game to game, even from timeout to timeout. With two-point guard lineups, especially on defense, that is not always the case. Mitchell was close to 6-foot-2 with long arms and a muscular frame, while Butler stood at 6-foot-3 and also possessed next level strength in his game. Size of course is always a big question mark when playing two point guards together at the same time as it can lead to defensive problems or struggles against taller backcourts. And if a team runs out two smallish players, at 6-foot-1 or smaller, then that lack of size has to be compensated somewhere.\n\nMany teams didn\u2019t necessarily worry about size within the backcourt itself, but rather filled out the lineup with players who made up for the squad\u2019s lack of length at the guard position. Think of those UConn teams that always featured elite level athletes on the wing like Jeremy Lamb and long, menacing rim protectors inside like Amida Brimah. Same goes for programs like Duke, UNC or Villanova as those schools constantly not only had long, athletic players throughout their respective rosters, but they also possessed basically next level size inside year in and year out.\n\nJaden Akins showing out in the dunk contest last night. 180 between the legs....making it look EASYYY pic.twitter.com/nkaamTXgFx \u2014 DK (@SpartanHoops_DK) May 8, 2021\n\nIf your backcourt can\u2019t play, defend or operate above the rim, you need other players that can. Otherwise you will get eaten alive inside, opposing guards can post your players up, they can shrink the court and make it hard to pass against ball pressure. A smaller backcourt can get a lot more aggressive defensively when there are long athletes behind it, especially if one of them is also a shot blocker. A defense with these types of players overall has more than enough presence and ability to limit operating space for any offense.\n\nMichigan State, over the course of the last decade, didn\u2019t always possess these types of players mentioned above in abundance, which made it hard to constantly play two playmakers together. Izzo\u2019s point guards also were more on the smaller side in many years, which created some lineup disadvantages and problems for the overall balance of the team. Still, MSU also made this special type of a team work more often than not, and as recent recruiting developments show, will look to do so in the future as well.\n\nThe big advantages of having two point guards on the floor together\n\nWhile playing two smaller playmakers who aren\u2019t both clear cut NBA level talents certainly has its disadvantages there are many things that these lineups can offer to a team. Aside from the fact that you always want to get your best players on the floor, it never hurts to have numerous players on the team that can handle the ball. This is especially true in college where teams generally face more ball pressure than in the professional ranks, where some opponents run full court pressure almost every game or where the overall skill level throughout the roster sometimes makes it hard to get into the offense.\n\nWith two point guards it gets extremely hard for the defense to not only prevent the ball from coming smoothly up the court, but also to disrupt the offense while it gets into sets. On the road or in a tournament situation this can be extremely valuable and offers plenty of security for the entire team and the coaching staff. It also gives coaches and players a lot more creativity and freedom in the way they choose to attack the defense.\n\n2022 4\ufe0f\u20e3\u2b50\ufe0f point guard Tre Holloman has committed to Michigan State @Tretrehoops pic.twitter.com/vfRMogMDWE \u2014 BallerTV (@BallerTV) August 7, 2021\n\nAnother huge advantage is that point guards usually are generally capable to get into the paint by the way of their handle. Making a defense collapse and breaking opponents down off the dribble has become more and more important in the modern game. It puts pressure on the players to defend without fouling and also creates the needed space for the waiting three-point shooters. Many teams rely on the long ball as the basis for their entire game, but before the players can let it fly, space needs to be created first. Playmakers usually are capable of that, just like they can free up inside players for dump offs with their penetration.\n\nPoint guards usually have a great understanding of the offense in general, plus they usually possess quite a good feel for the tempo and flow of a game. Having multiple players to influence these things is extremely helpful and it makes it that much harder to defend a team. This proves especially true in specific situations. Think of the vaunted MSU fast break, which some teams try to counter by taking away the Spartans\u2019 point guard immediately, sometimes with a double team. That of course becomes a lot harder when there is a second player to fall back on who can bring the ball up the court quickly and run everything just like the actual playmaker would have done.\n\nHow future two-point guard lineups might look for Michigan State\n\nHaving multiple, comparable players for one job can also help in terms of roster security. Injuries all of a sudden do not hit quite as hard as they would if only one clear cut starter can man the point, and it secures quite a bit of continuity on top of that. Mixing and matching all of his point guards will still be quite a challenge for Izzo, as it seems that by next year he will have four players on the roster who will all look for heavy minutes as playmakers. Now, of course, a lot can change from year to year, especially in today\u2019s college basketball world. But as of now, none of Tyson Walker, A.J. Hoggard, Jaden Akins and Tre Holloman seem like players who shy away from a challenge, and they are all in some shape or form in Izzo\u2019s long term plans. These players are all competitors hoping to earn a role.\n\nA huge bonus for the Spartans is that as of now, it seems that outside of Walker all mentioned players should be able to handle spot minutes at the two-guard position. Even Walker might switch over there from time to time if he proves to be the electric scorer many people expect him to be. Akins stands at 6-foot-3, has a long wingspan and is an elite level athlete, which could actually make him available for a permanent position switch. But even if that happens, his ability to help out as a primary ball handler would only add to the versatility Izzo has created with his recent recruiting strategy. For a player like Hoggard, his outside shot definitely needs to improve from last season if he plans to play at shooting guard spot.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the rest of the roster will shape up for the Spartans as quite a few players will be leaving in the next couple of years. Izzo, though, has recently shown a lot more interest in long, athletic wings and has certainly gotten quite a few of these types of players. Shot blockers always had value at Michigan State as well, and that should continue in the future. Recruiting numerous talented players for the same position, all of them with expectations for themselves, might create a little logjam, sure. But on a personal level, Izzo should be more than capable of handling any situations where they may be drama, and it will also cover up a situation if one of his recruits doesn\u2019t turn out the way he envisioned. Two point guards are much better than one in that case, and four of them offer a lot of interesting options.\n\nMaybe even one that adds Michigan State on that long list of champions that operated with multiple playmakers."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/2008%E2%80%9309_Michigan_State_Spartans_men%27s_basketball_team", "page_content": "Dear Wikiwand AI, let's keep it short by simply answering these key questions:\n\nCan you list the top facts and stats about 2008\u201309 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team?\n\nSummarize this article for a 10 years old"}], "The Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team has made seven Final Four appearances, including five in a row from 1999 to 2003.": [{"url": "https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/tournament/history/_/team1/6637", "page_content": "NCAA Basketball Tournament History\n\nTeam: Select One Abil Christian Akron Alabama Alabama State Albany American University Arizona Arizona State Arkansas Arkansas-Pine Bluff Auburn Baylor Belmont Binghamton Boise State Boston College Bradley Brigham Young Bucknell Buffalo Butler Cal State Fullerton Cal State Northridge California Charleston Chattanooga Cincinnati Clemson Cleveland State Coastal Carolina Colgate Connecticut Cornell Creighton Davidson Dayton Duke East Tennessee State Eastern Washington Fairleigh Dickinson Florida Florida State Gardner-Webb Georgetown Georgia Georgia State Georgia Tech Gonzaga Hampton Harvard Houston Illinois Indiana Iona Iowa Iowa State Kansas Kansas State Kentucky Lafayette Lehigh Liberty Lipscomb Long Island University Louisville Loyola (IL) LSU Manhattan Marquette Marshall Maryland Memphis Miami (FL) Michigan Michigan State Minnesota Mississippi Mississippi State Missouri Montana Morehead State Morgan State Murray State Nevada New Mexico New Mexico State North Carolina North Carolina Central North Carolina State North Dakota State North Florida North Texas Northeastern Northern Iowa Northern Kentucky Northwestern State Notre Dame Oakland Ohio Ohio State Oklahoma Oklahoma State Old Dominion Oregon Pennsylvania Pittsburgh Portland State Prairie View A&M Providence Purdue Radford Rhode Island Richmond Robert Morris Saint Louis Saint Mary's Sam Houston State San Diego State Seton Hall Siena South Dakota State Southern Methodist St. Bonaventure St. John's Stephen F.

In the regional final, MSU overcame a 12-point halftime deficit and outscored Kentucky 45-21 in the second for an 80-68 win.\n\nThe national semifinal: MSU lost to North Carolina, 74-70, in one of the greatest games in college basketball history. The Spartans and Tar Heels were tied at the half, then needed three overtimes to settle it. MSU\u2019s best chance at a win came at the end of the first OT, when Johnny Green had two free throws with a 64-62 lead and 11 seconds left. Green, who had joined the Spartans from the Marines seven games into the season, missed both, and UNC\u2019s Pete Brennan went the length of the court for a game-tying jumper. Green tied it near the end of the second OT with a tip-in. Finally, the Tar Heels pulled away in the third OT with eight points to MSU\u2019s four.\n\nThe consolation game: MSU didn\u2019t have much left in the tank the next day in a 67-60 loss to San Francisco. Green, who averaged 13.2 points that season, managed just nine points, though he did have 13 rebounds.\n\nThe aftermath: Green and star guard Jack Quiggle returned in 1957-58, but the Spartans finished a game behind Indiana in the Big Ten and missed out on the NCAA tournament.\n\nMore:How a Michigan State players-only meeting sparked Final Four run\n\n1979: Follow the Magic\n\nCoach: Jud Heathcote (third year at MSU).\n\nRecord: 26-6, 13-5 Big Ten.\n\nQualified: Auto-bid, No.2 seed, Mideast region\n\nFinal Four location: Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nThe road to the Final Four: The Spartans had a bye, then dominated Lamar in the second round, 95-64, LSU in the Sweet 16, 87-71 and Notre Dame, 80-68, in the Elite Eight.\n\nThe national semifinal: Penn\u2019s Cinderella run, in which the ninth-seeded Quakers beat three higher-ranked teams, came to an abrupt end as Magic Johnson put up a triple-double (29 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists) and Greg Kelser added 28 points and nine rebounds. Final score: MSU 101, Penn 67. Really, it wasn\u2019t even that close: MSU led 50-17 at halftime.\n\nThe title game: The matchup of college basketball\u2019s two biggest stars, in Magic and Larry Bird, went as expected. Magic had 24 points, seven boards and five assists, while Bird had 19 points and 13 rebounds. Bird made just seven of his 21 attempts though, and the Sycamores couldn't make up the difference, falling 75-64.\n\nThe aftermath: Magic and Kelser were off to the NBA and the Spartans tumbled nearly to the bottom of the Big Ten, finishing ninth out of ten teams.\n\nIn their own words: Kelser, who had 19 points and nine assists in the final, kept his summary of the game short: \u201cOur shots were dropping and theirs weren\u2019t, and that was the difference in the ball game.\u201d\n\n[ Big Ten fanatics, check out our free Best of the Big Ten newsletter!

Duke won their next 30 games entering the Final Four. In December, All-America forward Elton Brand had just 12 points and three rebounds for Duke. Brand was much better in the rematch, with 18 points and 15 rebounds, both game-highs. Duke had a 12-point halftime lead that the Spartans whittled to three when Brand sat with foul trouble. But the Blue Devils held on to win it, 68-62, and leave Mateen Cleaves despondent in the press conference: \"We were so close, but couldn\u2019t get over that hump.\u201d\n\nThe aftermath: MSU\u2019s core of Cleaves, Morris Peterson, Charlie Bell and Andre Hutson all returned for another year, which ended on a much, much better note.\n\nIn their own words: \u201cIf we played them 10 times, we might beat them a couple \u2014 at least once,\u201d Izzo said of the mostly dominant Dukies. \u201cBut they knew they were in a game.\u201d\n\nMore:Michigan State the Final Four blueblood, with 'idol' Tom Izzo chasing 2nd title\n\n2000: State of Glory\n\nCoach: Tom Izzo (fifth year at MSU).\n\nRecord: 32-7, 13-3 Big Ten\n\nQualified: Auto-bid, No. 1 seed, Midwest region\n\nFinal Four location: Indianapolis.\n\nThe road to the Final Four: MSU stomped Valparaiso in Cleveland, then outscored Utah by 15 in the second half to come \u201chome\u201d to The Palace. In Auburn Hills, the Spartans trailed Syracuse by 14 just over a minute into the second half. No worries; they closed the game on a 22-2 run to meet Iowa State in the regional final. Once again, the Spartans struggled deep into the game before finishing with a 23-5 run in the final three minutes.\n\nThe national semifinal: The Spartans\u2019 fourth showdown with Wisconsin, in the home of the Big Ten, resembled a brutal February game at the Kohl Center, with the teams combining to shoot 34.8% overall and score just 36 points in the first half. The Spartans eventually pulled away to a 53-41 win, thanks to Morris Peterson\u2019s 16 points in the second half, but MSU still didn\u2019t make a field goal in the final 12 minutes.\n\nThe final: As the semifinal was slow, the final was not, with MSU scoring 43 in the first half en route to an 89-76 victory. They might have won by more, but Mateen Cleaves missed a little over four minutes with an ankle sprain.\n\nThe aftermath: Charlie Bell would be the only Flintstone to return the next season, but MSU would still have plenty of talent in Jason Richardson and Zach Randolph.\n\nIn their own words: Cleaves had no doubts how much a title meant to him, as he put it after beating Florida on basically one leg: \u201cI told the trainer he was going to have to amputate my leg to keep me out of this.\u201d\n\n2001: Three's company\n\nCoach: Tom Izzo (sixth year at MSU).\n\nRecord: 28-5, 13-3 Big Ten.\n\nQualified: At-large bid, No. 1 seed, South Regional.\n\nFinal Four location: Minneapolis.\n\nThe road to the Final Four: The Spartans led Alabama State by just four at the half before allowing just 10 points in the second. From there, it was a walk through the South, with a 16-point win over Fresno State, a 15-point in over Gonzaga abd a seven-point win over Temple.\n\nThe national semifinal: Perhaps the Spartans\u2019 easy road to the final weekend \u2014 they faced the 9, 11, 12 and 16 seeds \u2014 left them soft against No. 2 Arizona. The Spartans were within two points at the half, but surrendered a 21-3 run by the Wildcats to open the second half. MSU had 15 turnovers in an 80-61 loss.\n\nThe aftermath: Most of the Spartans\u2019 NBA-level talent would leave, and the Spartans would struggle just to return to the tournament in 2002.\n\nIn their own words: Izzo had to turn to football to describe the Spartans\u2019 struggles in the national semi; \u201cLike I told my buddy, Steve Mariucci, \u2018We threw a lot of interceptions. And they ran them back for touchdowns.\u2019 \u201d\n\n2005: Carolina blues\n\nCoach: Tom Izzo (10th year at MSU)\n\nRecord: 26-7, 13-3 Big Ten.\n\nQualified: At-large, No. 5 seed, Austin Regional.\n\nFinal Four location: St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nThe road to the Final Four: The Spartans got hot late against 12-seed Old Dominion and won by eight, the locked down 13-seed Vermont to head to Austin. In Texas waited a taller task: No. 1 Duke and No. 2 Kentucky. First up, the Spartans finally topped Izzo\u2019s nemesis in Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, then recovered from blowing an eight-point lead against the Wildcats to prevail in double overtime against Kentucky, 94-88.\n\nThe national semifinal: The Spartans, led by freshman guard Drew Neitzel, suffered from a talent disparity against No. 1-seeded North Carolina, and it showed in the second half. MSU went from down 5 at the half to down 22 to the Tar Heels with 12 minutes left, and never recovered.\n\nThe aftermath: The Spartans entered the next season as the nation\u2019s No. 1 team, but it never really clicked.\n\nIn their own words: The seniors\u2019 struggles in the semifinal \u2014 they combined for just 12 points \u2014 had Tom Izzo turning philosophical: \u201cI\u2019m proud of what they\u2019ve done. And yet I hope they weren\u2019t satisfied.\u201d\n\nMore:Big Ten newsletter: Welcome back to the Final Four, Mr. March\n\n2009: Motor City madness\n\nCoach: Tom Izzo (14th year at MSU)\n\nRecord: 31-7, 15-3 Big Ten.\n\nQualified: At-large bid, No. 2 seed, Midwest region.\n\nFinal Four location: Detroit.\n\nThe road to the Final Four: An MSU team with a Final Four in Detroit on its mind was tested early in Minneapolis, first by Robert Morris, which was subdued only by a 21-0 run midway through the game, then by Southern Cal, which dared Travis Walton to beat them. He did. Then, in Indianapolis, the Spartans took care of business with a close win over Kansas and a lopsided one over Louisville.\n\nThe national semifinal: It wasn\u2019t technically a home game for MSU, but it might as well have been, with a clear majority of the 72,456 fans at Ford Field cheering for the Green and White. And the Spartans \u2014 and Kalin Lucas \u2014 delivered in the second half, outscoring UConn by seven in the second half on the way to a 82-73 win.\n\nThe final: The Spartans had beaten two No. 1 seeds \u2014 Louisville and UConn \u2014 to make the final. North Carolina was the final No. 1 seed standing. Unfortunately for the Spartans, they played like it, too, jumping out to an early 24-8 lead they never relinquished. The Tar Heels set records for most first-half points and largest halftime margin, and Ford Field set a record for attendance, with 72,922 fans.\n\nThe aftermath: Walton would graduate, but the core of the Spartans\u2019 Final Four team would return, and make another Final Four.\n\nIn their own words: The Ford Field experience was one few Spartans wouldn't forget \u2014 \u201cWhen you walked down that tunnel and walked out there and saw what I saw, you just say, \u2018Wow.\u2019 So if our players were a little bit, \u2018Wow,\u2019 it\u2019s probably because they got it from their coach. The only difference was I didn\u2019t have to play.\u201d\n\n2010: Indy-scribable\n\nCoach: Tom Izzo (15th year at MSU).\n\nRecord: 28-9, 14-4 Big Ten.\n\nQualified: At-large, No. 5 seed, Midwest region.\n\nFinal Four location: Indianapolis.\n\nThe road to the Final Four: A reunion with Jud Heathcote in Spokane, Wash., started out rocky, with a too-close win over New Mexico State followed by a buzzer-beater from Korie Lucious to beat Maryland. That was a costly win, however, as Kalin Lucas tore his Achilles. In St. Louis, the Spartans survived an upset bid from Northern Iowa, then won a thriller against Tennessee on a Raymar Morgan free throw with 1.8 seconds left.\n\nThe national semifinal: The year before, the Spartans had been the home team. This year, they were facing the home team, as tiny Butler, a 5-seed, was the crowd \u2014 and media \u2014 favorite. The Bulldogs\u2019 defense hampered the Spartans all game long, but never more than with eight seconds left, trailing 50-49, Draymond Green went up for a shot and was smacked by Butler\u2019s Gordon Hayward. No good. No foul. Game over, essentially.\n\nThe aftermath: Izzo had stars Lucas and Durrell Summers returning, but the biggest commitment was Izzo himself, who turned down an offer from Cleveland Cavaliers owner (and MSU alum) Dan Gilbert to jump to the NBA.\n\nIn their own words: Izzo couldn\u2019t be too upset at the run his Spartans had made: \u201cNobody is gonna be able to take this Final Four away from us,\u201d he said after the game.\n\n2015: 'Mr. March' rides again\n\nCoach: Tom Izzo (20th year at MSU)\n\nRecord: 27-12, 12-6 Big Ten.\n\nQualified: At-large, No. 7 seed, East regional.\n\nFinal Four location: Indianapolis.\n\nThe road to the Final Four: It wasn\u2019t an easy run \u2014 even a 10-point lead in the tourney opener was cut to three in the final minute \u2014 but the Spartans edged by Georgia, Virginia, Oklahoma and Louisville by 7,6, 4 and 6 points thanks to late defense and steady free-throw shooting.\n\nThe national semifinal: For a while, it looked like Izzo would finally get his revenge on Coach K, whom he hadn\u2019t beaten since 2005. The Spartans were up 14-6 and there was a path to the final. But Duke was relentless inside and on defense, resulting in too many Spartans fouls and turnovers, and an 81-61 loss.\n\nThe aftermath: The Lansing Sexton tandem of Denzel Valentine and Bryn Forbes would return for their senior seasons, but 2015-16 would end in one of the most stunning tourney losses under Izzo, to Middle Tennessee State.\n\nIn their own words: A season of struggles was redeemed by the final run, per Izzo: \u201cIt\u2019ll go down as the best one, just because of what we went through all year.\u201d\n\nAn earlier version of this story misstated how many times Wisconsin and Michigan State played in 1999-2000.\n\nContact Ryan Ford at rford@freepress.com.

Keyontae Johnson slipped behind the Michigan State defense, elevated with his back to the basket, grabbed the ball and slammed it down.\n\nIt was the signature play of a towering performance by the shortest player on the floor.\n\nNowell broke the NCAA Tournament record for assists in a game with 19, his last two on spectacular passes in the last minute of OT, and Kansas State beat Michigan State 98-93 on Thursday night in a Sweet 16 thriller.\n\n\u201cToday was a special one, man,\u201d said Nowell, who fought through a second-half ankle injury. \u201cI\u2019ve got to give a lot to credit to my teammates for battling, for fighting through adversity when we was down. I can\u2019t even explain how I\u2019m feeling right now. I just know that I\u2019m blessed and I\u2019m grateful.\u201d\n\nNowell's alley-oop to Johnson with 52 seconds left in overtime gave the Wildcats (26-9) the lead for good in this back-and-forth East Region semifinal.\n\n\u201cI mean, it was just a basketball play between me and Keyontae,\u201d Nowell said. \u201cWe knew how Michigan State plays defense. They play high up, and Keyontae just told me, we got eye contact, and he was like, lob, lob. I just threw it up, and he made a great play.\u201d\n\nMichigan State cut the lead to one before Nowell bounced an inbound pass from under the basket to Ismael Massoud, who knocked down a jumper with 17 seconds left that put Kansas State ahead 96-93 and gave Nowell the assists record.\n\nWith Michigan State needing a 3 to tie, Nowell stole the ball from the Spartans' Tyson Walker and drove for a clinching layup at the buzzer. Nowell finished with 20 points and five steals in a signature performance at basketball's most famous arena that drew tweets of praise from Patrick Mahomes and Kevin Durant.\n\n\u201cThat was a legendary display of controlling a basketball game Markquis,\u201d Durant tweeted.\n\nUNLV\u2019s Mark Wade had the previous NCAA tourney assists record with 18 during the Runnin\u2019 Rebels 1987 Final Four win over Indiana.\n\nTang, the energetic, 56-year-old first-year head coach who was hired to lead the Wildcats after two decades as an assistant at Baylor, gave all the credit to his senior point guard.\n\n\u201cWell, what really helps is that all 10 eyes on the defense have to pay attention to him, and that\u2019s what allows everybody else to get open,\u201d Tang said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that he sees it, but they all have to pay attention to him when he has the ball in his hands.\u201d\n\nJohnson \u2014 the Florida transfer who was sidelined for nearly two years after he collapsed on the court during a game in December 2020 \u2014 scored 22 points for the No. 3 seed Wildcats. Kansas State will face ninth-seeded Florida Atlantic on Saturday as it seeks the program's first Final Four berth since 1964.\n\nA.J. Hoggard scored a career-high 25 points for seventh-seeded Michigan State (21-13). Joey Hauser added 18 points and Walker had 16, including a layup with 5 seconds left in regulation that forced the first overtime of this year's NCAA Tournament.\n\nNowell turned his ankle early in the second half, was helped off the court and had it taped. Michigan State took the lead with him sidelined, and when he returned, he pushed off the ankle to bank in a 3-pointer that beat the shot clock and tied the game at 55-all.\n\nTurns out he was just getting started. Neither team led by more than seven points in the final 15 minutes of regulation, and Nowell steadied Kansas State's offense down the stretch, finding Massoud for a 3-pointer that made it 80-75 and hitting a jumper with 1:04 left for the Wildcats' final basket of regulation.\n\nMassoud, who like Nowell honed his game on the playgrounds of Harlem, finished with 15 points for the Wildcats, who shot 55.9% from the field. They become only the second team to shoot better than 50% against the Spartans this season. Cam Carter added 12 points.\n\nJaden Akins added 14 points for coach Tom Izzo\u2019s Spartans, the final Big Ten team in the tournament. Michigan State outrebounded Kansas State 37-31 and finished 31 of 63 from the field (49.2%).\n\n\u201cWe got caught mesmerized on Nowell,\u201d Izzo said. \u201cHe\u2019s a special player. We actually did a pretty good job on him. ... It was the assists that really killed us, and the back cuts.\u201d\n\nBoth teams were efficient from 3-point range in a tournament that's featured shaky outside shooting, with Michigan State hitting 13 of 25 (52%) and Kansas State connecting on 11 of 24 (45.8%).\n\nNowell was the difference, putting his name alongside New York City point guard greats like Kenny Smith, Kenny Anderson, Mark Jackson and Bob Cousy, and sending Kansas State to its first Elite Eight since 2018.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nMichigan State: The 68-year-old Izzo has led the Spartans to 25 straight NCAA Tournaments but is still seeking his second national title. Since their championship in 2000, the Spartans have made six Final Fours, most recently in 2019.\n\nKansas State: Nowell has 64 points and 42 assists in three games, including 14 assists in the first round against Montana State. He had nine assists against Kentucky; one more would have given him double-doubles in all three games.\n\n------\n\nAP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP--Top25"}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/recap?gameId=401263325", "page_content": "EAST LANSING, Mich. -- \u2014 Michigan State's NCAA Tournament streak under Hall of Fame coach Tom Izzo appears to be alive and well after it was in dire straits a month ago.\n\nRocket Watts scored 21 points and Aaron Henry had 18 to lead the Spartans in a 70-64 victory over No. 2 Michigan on Sunday that seems to seal Izzo's 23rd consecutive appearance in college basketball's showcase.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re damn right it matters,\" Izzo said.\n\nThe Spartans (15-11, 9-11 Big Ten) have won five of their last seven games, beating No. 4 Ohio State, No. 5 Illinois and their second-ranked rivals in the span of 16 days.\n\n\u201cI bet I never go through that again in my career,\" Izzo said.\n\nThe Wolverines (19-3, 14-3) closed the regular season getting routed at home by the Fighting Illini, beating Michigan State handily to clinch the Big Ten title and losing the rematch three days later.\n\nAnd, Michigan might have lost more than that.\n\nSenior guard Eli Brooks hurt his left ankle early in the game at the Breslin Center and did not return in what potentially could be a problem going into the Big Ten and NCAA tournaments. Coach Juwan Howard did not have an update on Brooks after the game.\n\nThe Wolverines wrapped up the conference championship Thursday night with a 69-50 win over the Spartans as Franz Wagner scored 19 points and Hunter Dickinson adding 14.\n\nMichigan's dynamic duo struggled Sunday, missing 4 of 5 shots in the first half and combining for five points. Both bounced back in the second half as Dickinson finished with 12 points while Wagner had 10 points.\n\nReserve Chaundee Brown scored 13 points, Mike Smith added 11 and Isaiah Livers had nine for the Wolverines, whose last lead was 21-19 early in the game.\n\n\u201cWe come here complacent, get blasted,\" Livers said. \u201cThat\u2019s just how it works in college basketball. They were ready to play today and we weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nJoey Hauser scored nine of his 11 points off the bench in the first half as Michigan State led 30-26. The Spartans pulled away and were ahead 55-44 with 5:58 remaining and made enough free throws in the final minutes to hold off the Wolverines.\n\n\u201cYou have to be ready to play from start to finish, versus a team that,\" Howard said. \u201cYou won convincingly in your building, and now you play in their building. A team like that, one of the things that they pride themselves on is physicality.\"\n\nROCKET'S RETURN\n\nWatts had one of the best games three days after he was benched for much of the second half at Michigan after not diving onto the floor for a loose ball.\n\n\u201cI was real mad at myself, not at the coaches,\" Watts said. \u201cI know I could\u2019ve played better and harder at Michigan.\"\n\nWatts said his mother attended a game for the first time in his two seasons.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not really into basketball and sports,\" said Watts, adding his mother calls him after every game.\n\nIzzo embraced Watts after the game and saw tears in his eyes, an emotional reaction to having his mother in the stands.\n\n\u201cThat was pretty cool,\" Izzo said.\n\nNOT BITING\n\nIllinois (20-6, 16-4) made a case Saturday after beating No. 7 Ohio State that it deserved to be recognized as Big Ten champions after winning two more conference games than the Wolverines, who played 17 of 20 games because of a COVID-19 pause, and beat them 76-53 on March 2.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get into that stuff,\" Howard said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get any sound bites from me.\"\n\nSENIOR MOMENT\n\nFifth-year senior Joshua Langford, who missed much of the previous two seasons with injury, made a 3-point shot with 49 seconds left to give Michigan State a 64-59 lead.\n\n\u201cI was standing right next to him and I told him to shoot it before he caught it,\u201d Izzo recalled. \u201cHe went straight up and straight down and it was as picture perfect as you can get.\u201d\n\nTIP-INS\n\nMichigan: Brooks had a protective boot on his left leg as he watched the second half. If he is out for an extended period of time, that could hurt the team's national championship hopes. Brooks ranks fourth on the team with eight-plus points per game, averages nearly three assists a game and has started 51 games over two seasons.\n\nMichigan State: The NCAA Tournament will likely include the Spartans, whose spot in college basketball's showcase was in doubt last month when they lost four straight and were reeling from a COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not politicking for anything,\" Izzo said. \u201cWe did about everything we could do.\"\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nMichigan will likely slip a little in the Top 25 with the setback and potential loss of Brooks.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Big Ten Tournament begins Wednesday in Indianapolis, where first-seeded Michigan may meet Michigan State for a third time.\n\n------\n\nFollow Larry Lage at https://twitter.com/LarryLage\n\n------"}, {"url": "https://spartanswire.usatoday.com/2022/03/24/michigan-state-basketball-march-29-1979-final-four-spartans-history-magic-johnson/", "page_content": "Spartans Wire looks back in history. What special Michigan State event took place on Mar. 24?\n\nIt was a glorious day for the Spartans on this day in 1979. The Michigan State men\u2019s basketball team was coming off an 80-68 victory over the Notre Dame Fighting Irish in the Elite Eight. This set up a Final Four showdown between Michigan State and the Pennsylvania Quakers.\n\nThe man who would eventually be known as Magic would dominate this game. Earvin Johnson recorded his second triple-double of the tournament against Penn. He poured in 29 points to go with his 10 rebounds and 10 assists. Johnson shot a blistering 90% from the field and hit 11 of 12 shots from the charity stripe.\n\nGreg Kesler was right behind Johnson as he scored 28 points for Michigan State. As a team, they shot 63.3% from the field, while limiting Penn to 29.3% shooting.\n\nThe Spartans ran away with this game and defeated the Quakers 101-67. By halftime, the score was 50-17 but Penn would keep up with Michigan State in the second half as they only scored one less point, 51-50.\n\nMichigan State would finish the 1979 season as NCAA champions.

We take a look at some of the historical significance of this run. Buy Spartans Tickets Michigan State has the sixth most Final Four appearances in NCAA Men\u2019s Basketball with ten. They have now gone to the Final Four in the years: 1957, 1979 (Thank you Magic Johnson), 1999, 2000, 2001, 2005, 2009, 2010, 2015, and now 2019).\n\nMichigan State is vying for their third ever National Title. They won their first in 1979 led by Jud Heathcote and some guy named Earvin \u2018Magic\u2019 Johnson. Tom Izzo is going for his second title, winning the first in 2000 against Florida behind his stars Jason Richardson and the \u201cFlintstones.\u201d The Flintstones were comprised of point guard Mateen Cleaves, small forward Morris Peterson, and shooting guard Charlie Bell. Side note: Michigan State legend Miles Bridges also hails from Flint, MI, along with a host of other NBA talent. Michigan State has now competed in 22 straight NCAA Tournaments, a streak which began in Tom Izzo\u2019s second season with the team. This is good for the fourth-longest streak of all-time, and the third-longest active streak in college basketball.\n\nDespite having a good history of Tournament play, no Big Ten team has won the NCAA Tournament since\u2026 Michigan State in 2000.\n\nAfter their Elite 8 matchup with Duke, Tom Izzo is now 2-11 in his career against Duke and Coach Mike Krzyzewski, with his last win coming in 2005 where his 5-seeded Michigan State team upset the 1-seed Duke Blue Devils in the Sweet Sixteen.\n\nThis will be Tom Izzo\u2019s eighth Final Four appearance, and he is 2-5 lifetime in the Final Four. He made three straight Final Four appearances between 1999-2001, winning one championship in that time.\n\nFollow all of your favorite Michigan teams at Spartans Wire, Lions Wire and the Detroit Free Press!"}, {"url": "https://msuspartans.com/news/2021/11/9/m-basketball-michigan-state-falls-to-no-3-kansas-87-74-at-the-champions-classic.aspx", "page_content": "Thanks for visiting !\n\nThe use of software that blocks ads hinders our ability to serve you the content you came here to enjoy.\n\nWe ask that you consider turning off your ad blocker so we can deliver you the best experience possible while you are here.\n\nThank you for your support!"}]}
