Moreover, Malcolm is of African-American descent and holds American citizenship.\n\nMalcolm was born under the astrological sign of Libra. Sapiens born under the Libra astrological sign are nurturing and caring. They are constantly on the lookout for balance, harmony, and justice.\n\nProfessional Career\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks picked Brogdon with the 36th overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft on June 23, 2016. He signed with the Bucks on July 30, 2016.\n\nHe made his NBA debut on October 26, 2016, in the Bucks\u2019 season opener against the Charlotte Hornets, recording eight points and five assists in 21 minutes.\n\nBrogdon made history as the first second-round draft pick to win Rookie of the Year with the Milwaukee Bucks since the common draft era began in 1966.\n\nTwo seasons later, he became the eighth player in NBA history to have a 50-40-90 season, indicating a percentage success rate for field goals, three-pointers, and free throws.\n\nOn October 18, 2017, Brogdon scored 19 points in a 108\u2013100 victory over the Boston Celtics in the Bucks\u2019 season opener. Likewise, he had a season-high ten assists to go with 21 points against the Detroit Pistons on November 3, 2017.\n\nFurthermore, Malcolm set a season-high with 22 points against the Cleveland Cavaliers four days later. Developed a career-high with 32 points in a 109\u2013105 win over the Phoenix Suns on January 22, 2018.\n\nBrogdon won a bronze medal for the United States national team at the 2015 Pan American Games. In 2019, he signed as a free agent with the Pacers.\n\nCeltics Of Boston (2022\u2013present)\n\nBrogdon was traded to the Boston Celtics on July 9, 2022, in exchange for Aaron Nesmith, Daniel Theis, Nik Stauskas, Malik Fitts, Juwan Morgan, and a 2023 first-round draft pick (player).\n\nBrogdon scored 16 points in a 126-117 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on October 18.\n\nInjury\n\nBrogdon has been nursing an Achilles injury and entered the league\u2019s health and safety protocols after testing positive for COVID-19 in January.\n\nMalcolm Brogdon hit a floating jump shot on the Indiana Pacers\u2019 first offensive possession of the game.\n\nMoreover, Brogdon ended up with the ball in his hands as the shot clock expired on the next possession. Additionally, he took a hurried shot that only hit the side of the backboard.\n\nIf this injury persists past the All-Star break, it would be prudent to have Brogdon sit out the rest of the season. With how the Pacers\u2019 season has gone so far, he has no reason to play hurt.\n\nInjuries have hurt his game, but statistically, Brogdon has been more of a plus for this team than a minus. Hopefully, Brogdon will overcome his injury and return to court sooner rather than later.\n\n2022 Injury\n\nDATE INJURY 11/11/22 Hamstring 2/28/22 Rest 2/24/22 Achilles 1/20/22 Achilles\n\nDid The Indiana Pacers Ruin Malcolm Brogdon\u2019s Shot?\n\nCertainly not. However,h the Pacers\u2019 request for Malcolm Brogdon to shoot more mid-range shots has undoubtedly impacted Brogdon.\n\nIn fact, the crux of his missed 3-pointers is due to the difficulty of his shots rather than the team asking him to do something he is incapable of.\n\nBrogdon receives more defensive attention as the Pacers\u2019 focal point than he did as a complementary piece in Milwaukee. Furthermore, only 25% of his 3-point attempts were \u201cwide open,\u201d while only 20% can be classified as such.\n\nBrogdon will have to adjust in the future and learn to sink contested and pull-up 3-pointers if he wants to maintain his accuracy.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss Out on Jerrelle Benimon: NBA, Net Worth & More>>\n\nComes From A Studious Family\n\nMitchell Gino Brogdon Sr., Brogdon\u2019s father, is a lawyer and mediator best known as the host of the syndicated court show Personal Injury Court.\n\nBrogdon\u2019s mother, Dr. Jann Adams, is the former chairperson of Morehouse College\u2019s Psychology Department.
