Her first book, Family, Dependence, and the Origins of the Welfare State: Britain and France, 1914\u20131945 (Cambridge University Press,1993), showed how welfare states were shaped by and came to promote particular family relations and gender roles. Her more recent work has addressed the involvement of British women in colonial policymaking. In this and other work, Pedersen has sought to specify the complex processes through which political and social change happens.\n\nWhile researching various aspects of British politics between the two world wars, Pedersen often found herself encountering the figure of Eleanor Rathbone, the feminist and social reformer. Rathbone led the movement for family allowances; she also became an important parliamentary defender of women\u2019s interests, a prominent critic of appeasement, and an advocate for refugees from Franco\u2019s Spain and Hitler\u2019s Germany. Pedersen will spend her year at the Institute completing a biography of this visionary feminist thinker and politician.\n\nPedersen earned her BA in social studies and her PhD in history from Harvard University.

An Old Etonian from the Scottish aristocracy, he had pursued an unglamorous career in the Foreign Office before the first world war, and his conversion to Catholicism shortly before his marriage may have further damaged his prospects. He was third or fourth choice to run the newly established League of Nations in 1919, but he made a brilliant job of it on a shoestring budget, and in the process he created something new in world affairs \u2013 an embryonic international civil service. The relatively small staff that worked under Drummond inspired the 1945 formation of the United Nations, a larger and more lavishly funded international body, and thus in some measure created the world we know today.\n\nSusan Pedersen\u2019s strikingly original book puts Drummond and those around him in the spotlight, and in the process transforms our understanding of the League of Nations. For many years after it was disbanded in 1946 the league was a byword for failure, a graveyard of hopes. Even during the war, about the only thing the architects of the UN could agree on was that their new world organisation should have a different name. Given the considerable continuities in function and personnel, this rebranding worked surprisingly well \u2013 even as the league was being unceremoniously wound up, the new UN was welcomed with high hopes.\n\nThe main charge levelled at the league was that it had manifestly failed in its principal purpose \u2013 to prevent another global conflict. The rise of fascism and the outbreak of the second world war seemed to indicate its bankruptcy. Only occasionally did dissident voices suggest that this was a little unfair, pointing out that the league might have succeeded, had it not been coupled so tightly to the fundamentally unsustainable post-1919 peace treaties.\n\nOver the past 20 years, there has been a real reassessment. It began with a rethink of the league\u2019s efforts for minority rights. Much more ambitious than anything the UN has ever attempted, the organisation\u2019s work to protect minorities through international law was a prescient attempt to encourage states to treat all their citizens fairly, and to prevent the huge flights of refugees that took place in the interwar years and that are with us again today. Historians also took a closer look at the league\u2019s pioneering interventions in global welfare and healthcare: many of its public health professionals and economists went on to put their experience into practice in the World Health Organisation, the UN\u2019s statistical services and the International Monetary Fund.\n\nNow Pedersen, a colleague of mine at Columbia University, has added an important missing piece to the jigsaw. The focus of her book is the Permanent Mandates Commission, a body created out of the first world war settlement. Its role was to supervise the victors in their administration of the captured enemy colonies \u2013 one of Drummond\u2019s most sensitive responsibilities. Former German possessions in Africa and the Pacific went to South Africa, Belgium, Australia and others. Britain and France got large chunks of the formerly Ottoman Middle East. The commission gave Samoans, Rwandans and Syrians an organisation in Geneva to which they could address complaints, and appeal for greater autonomy. And address it they did, sending hundreds of petitions outlining their grievances and demands for reform.\n\nCritics will point out that the commission\u2019s powers were, not surprisingly, highly circumscribed from the very start. It could not compel the mandate governments to change their methods: even when France bombed Syrian nationalists and destroyed much of the centre of Damascus in 1925, they were scarcely penalised. So from that point of view the commission functioned as a kind of figleaf to legitimise the reality of continued European imperial domination.\n\nYet Pedersen shows it was more interesting than that, by focusing her attention on Drummond and the other members of the commission. While some of them could never escape the sense that they were representing their countries, that was certainly not true of them all. In fact a view emerged within the commission that it was necessary to rise above nationalism and defend the greater good. There was a Victorian highmindedness about this which was inseparable from empire \u2013 but it could be turned in other directions. In practice, the commission applied discreet pressure on mandatory governments to pay more attention to what they were doing in their territories.\n\nIn moments of crisis, a real battle for international public opinion took place over whether governments should be answerable to an international body. Many officials in the mandated territories breathed a sigh of relief when Hitler took Germany out of the league in 1933, because they knew that without the backing of such a major power the Permanent Mandates Commission would be weakened. And so it was.\n\nPedersen outlines some of the commission\u2019s less well-known achievements. She shows that Britain decided, quite unilaterally, to give Iraq its independence in 1932 because Whitehall argued that the country would be better controlled if it was nominally independent \u2013 and free of commission scrutiny. This is an important insight into just what imperial logic understood by independence in the Middle Eastern context. In Palestine, in contrast, Whitehall policymakers felt by the 1930s that the mandate was tying its hands by forcing it to follow a more pro-Zionist line than really suited British interests.\n\nIn the end, Pedersen shows that the Permanent Mandates Commission served neither the imperial powers nor the inhabitants of the colonies themselves. While it didn\u2019t give colonial subjects any real power, it did give them a voice \u2013 but this didn\u2019t seem that significant in the 1930s. Over the next 20 years, however, the contribution of Drummond and his colleagues helped to spread the ideal of independence much faster than anyone had ever imagined."}, {"url": "https://www.apollo.io/people/Susan/Pedersen/57dd68d2a6da987af1218c67", "page_content": "Texas A&M University has a proud history that stretches back to 1876 when The Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas became the first public institution of higher learning in the state of Texas.

The book, populated with a cast of memorably drawn characters, tells the story of the League\u2019s Permanent Mandate Commission (PMC), the body intended to oversee the governance of territories taken from the defeated German and Ottoman empires in the Middle East, Africa, and the Pacific, from its inception in the Peace Conference of 1919 to its effective dissolution in 1939. The Guardians tells a rich and important story, a fact reflected in the diversity of responses it engendered from the participants of this roundtable. For Veronique Dimier, this is the story of the success, however limited, of the PMC in carrying out its supervisory mission despite its weakness vis-\u00e0-vis the mandatory powers. The commission, after all, could only discuss the reports submitted by those powers themselves; it had no authority to conduct its own inspections on the ground, to sanction the mandatory powers, or even to receive petitions directly from the inhabitants of the mandate territories. Even so, Dimier notes that the commission managed to carve out a measure of independence, insisting that the powers respect inhabitants\u2019 right of petition and giving mandate populations voice in the international arena. For Elizabeth Thompson, on the other hand, the PMC was an unmitigated disaster as it helped suppress complaints from native populations and endorsed colonial violence in the mandate territories. Noting that Pedersen\u2019s focus on the \u201cview from Geneva\u201d elides colonial-nationalist perspectives, she doubts the contention that \u201cthe League helped make the end of empire imaginable\u201d and points out that colonial nationalists could imagine a world without empire long before the PMC. In the end, \u201cairing dirty laundry without then washing it proved to be a detriment to the League\u2019s internationalism and to the future of human rights in the Middle East,\u201d and the PMC\u2019s failure helped turn anticolonial nationalists away from liberal internationalism and toward other, seemingly more promising paths to dignity and equality, including\u2014in the Middle East in particular\u2014alternatives centered on Islam. Meredith Terretta highlights Pedersen\u2019s contention that the work of the PMC represented the high point of an \u201cinternationalist age,\u201d an era when transnational networks of experts, jurists, officials, and lobbyists engaged in tense, sometimes antagonistic collaborations. For Terretta, the book\u2019s main contribution lies in demonstrating the role of League internationalism in shaping the transition from a world of empires to one of nation-states, not least by insisting on the principle that mandatory powers had no political sovereignty over the territories under their rule. Terretta admires Pedersen\u2019s extensive research and the deft pen portraits of League officials but also, like Thompson, notes that the book\u2019s focus on Geneva downplays the perspectives of colonial populations as well as the role of competing internationalisms, most notably the communist variety that developed contemporaneously with the League version. Trygve Thronveit is concerned less with Pedersen\u2019s account of what the PMC did then with her account of how and for what purpose it came into being. Her view that the PMC, and the League more generally, was primarily a British creation designed to serve British imperial interests underestimates, he argues, the role that President Woodrow Wilson played in shaping it and so fails to reckon fully with the radical nature of his vision. Throntveit disputes the claim that \u201cthe mandates system functioned as it was intended to function\u201d when it promoted the interests of empire, arguing instead that the pressure of \u201cworld opinion\u201d that the PMC channeled was precisely what Wilson thought would help shift international norms away from unaccountable colonial rule and toward self-determination. For Throntveit, the failure therefore lay not with Wilson\u2019s original conception but with the refusal of the U.S. Senate to endorse it, a refusal that left the League a hollow shell and allowed it to become a tool of reaction rather than reform. Readers of this roundtable who have not yet read the book may wish to begin with Andrew Webster\u2019s contribution, which provides the most comprehensive tour d\u2019horizon of the work. Webster locates The Guardians within the recent outpouring of scholarship on the League and then proceeds to lay out the book\u2019s central themes and offer a detailed outline of its structure. He notes that Pedersen\u2019s case-study approach to the mandate territories sometimes obscures \u201cthe simultaneity of discussions regarding multiple Mandates which existed at each PMC session\u201d and the ways in which \u201cthat overlap influenced specific decisions,\u201d and he also wishes for a more robust treatment of the post-1945 transition from the PMC to the United Nations Trusteeship Council. In the end, however, he finds the book \u201can engaging and genuinely accessible work of scholarship\u201d whose arguments will \u201cframe all scholarly discussion of the mandates system, and much on the League of Nations as a whole, for some time to come.\u201d On this, all the contributors to this roundtable seem to agree.

Set up in November 1920, after former German and Turkish colonial territories were granted as mandates to France, Britain, Belgium, South Africa, Australia and Japan, it was to ensure \u2018the well-being and development\u2019 of \u2018those people not yet able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world\u2019 (Article 22 of the covenant of the League of Nations\u2019). Composed of 9 members selected for an indefinite period of time and chosen for their competence, with a majority of them coming from non-mandate powers, the Commission was expected to be an independent body whose aim was to supervise the implementation of these principles by the mandatory powers. As such it had at least one annual session in Geneva where it was to analyse the reports sent by the mandatory powers, a task it performs till 1939 and the beginning of the Second World War. The task of the Commission was limited as it did not have the right to investigate on the spot, to receive petitions directly and to sanction the mandatory powers. Of particular interest in this book is precisely the importance Pedersen grants to the leaders who built this institution (Lord Lugard, Marquis Alberto Theodoli, William Rappard, among others) despite the very limits it encountered. She shows convincingly how the Commission tried and, to some extent, succeeded in escaping the grasp of its main stakeholders (mainly mandatory and colonial powers), in extending its power well beyond the expectations of the states which originated it. This seems to confirm the neo-institutionalists\u2019 hypotheses that the political organs of international organizations are not without resources: as a result, they are not simply passive tools of the Member States. Over time, the argument holds, these organizations will seek to use grants of authority for their own purposes, especially to increase their autonomy. They will seek to expand the gaps in Member States\u2019 control and they will use any accumulated political resources to resist efforts to curtail their authority\u2019[2] This is clear in the way Theodoli dealt with petitions received through the mandatory powers (85): his activism in receiving, reading and accepting a number of petitions was a great source of annoyance for the mandatory powers. As Pedersen notes, \u201cthe vast majority of communications, memoranda, memorials and appeals that crossed Theodoli\u2019s desk (including a great many that certainly did call the mandate into question), were thus ruled \u2018receivable\u2019, sent to the mandatory power for comment, and put through a procedure that would make the petitioner\u2019s grievance more widely known.\u201d (85). Members of the Commission, to assert their autonomy, also did their utmost to force mandatory powers to respect the right of petition. In the same way, some members strove to have their own visit of inspection on the ground and a more precise questionnaire (211-212). The tendency and attempts of the Commission to increase its power and independence is also clear in chapter 7, which examines the success of the Commission\u2019s members in opposing attempts by South Africa and Great Britain to annex or amalgamate mandate territories with colonial ones. Of course, these attempts had limits: the autonomy of the Mandates Commission as an international institution was always challenged by its stakeholders. Pedersen largely highlights the resistance of the mandatory powers to what was considered to be the \u201cactivism\u201d of the Permanent Mandates Commission (211). The mandatory powers, for example, opposed any attempts by the Commission to have direct links with petitioners, shut down any possibility for the Commission to send visits of inspection on the spot and to write a more precise questionnaire, one that would be, according to Chamberlain, \u201cinfinitely more detailed, infinitely more inquisitorial\u201d (212). Criticisms as to the tendency of the Commission \u201cto exceed its power\u201d continued (211). The book also shows (chapter 5) how, in 1925, after the Syrian revolt and the bombing of Damascus, attempts by Lugard and other members of the Commission to inquire into French atrocities and into the conflict in progress were quickly dashed, how the Permanent Mandates Commission eventually came to cooperate with the mandatory powers instead of casting doubts on the \u201calleged mal-administration of backward people\u201d (166). Even though the Commission was eager to present itself as impartial, in this case, where its own legitimacy and raison d\u2019\u00eatre were at stake, it finally stated that \u201cits duty to cooperate with the mandatory power was as important as its duty to supervise\u201d (160). This chapter is also interesting on another aspect: while in my own work on the Permanent Mandates Commission[3], I show that the Commission became the perfect ground for French and British rivalry and competition, Pedersen reveals judiciously how both powers were able to cease their squabbles and collaborate when their status as colonial powers was seriously challenged. Last but not least, she shows how these limits to the Commission\u2019s autonomy and the contradictions in which the Commission found itself largely contributed to the demise of the system. Particularly interesting on this point is chapter 9 on Iraq: the decision of the UK to grant independence to Iraq, was a way for it to maintain its economic interests and influence while escaping the supervision of the Commission. In this case, the mandate system was questioned by the very powers that set it up when it became clear that they could lose control of the whole process. As pointed out by Pedersen, this demise was facilitated by the evolution of the international context and a change in personnel, with the departure of the main leaders of the organisation (Lugard especially). All in all, this book will be of interest not only to historians but also to specialists in international relations and political scientists working on international institutions.\n\nReview by Meredith Terretta, Princeton University Susan Pedersen devotes much of her conclusion to spelling out the differences between the dynamically internationalist Permanent Mandates Commission of the League of Nations, tasked with overseeing the mandated territories from the mid-1920s until the mid-1930s, and its more statist postwar successor, the United Nations Trusteeship Council that supervised the administration of the trust territories. Among other things, the Trusteeship Council privileged the \u2018security\u2019 interests of administering authorities over those of indigenous inhabitants, even as the latter became involved in the political processes of decolonization. The Trusteeship Council appeared much less independent than the Mandates Commission, particularly to those intimately familiar with the League for having served on it, studied it, or written legal opinions about its purpose in the world. Pedersen\u2019s history of the Mandates Commission portrays the League\u2019s dismantling in the late 1930s and the postwar formation of a statist UN as a harbinger for the end of empire. This was not because the UN, amplifying the Atlantic Charter, ushered in an age of political and economic rights in a new age of world governance in which colonialism had no place. Rather, the UN was a trans-war, not a post-war, formation that foretold not only the end of empire, but also the very end to internationalism that enabled empire\u2019s demise. In place of a league of nations, Pedersen argues, came not a united nations, but the bilaterally negotiated state-building that would \u201csafeguard geopolitical interests [of world powers] even after formal empire was gone (203).\u201d This book provides answers to more than one essential historical question of our time, nearly a century after the League\u2019s optimistic formation. My primary focus is this one: How did the interests of states vanquish \u2018the international\u2019 that the world\u2019s \u2018guardians\u2019\u2014members, experts, officialdom, secretaries, jurists, and various lobbyists associated with the League of Nations\u2014deliberately built; and, further, what was lost when the sort of internationalism on which they collaborated, at times tensely, even antagonistically, to construct \u2018stopped working\u2019 on the brink of the Second World War? As a historian of Africa researching the particular rights that UN Trusteeship status afforded to inhabitants of Africa\u2019s trust territories in the age of decolonization, I frame the question more particularly than Pedersen intends: What, if anything, did inhabitants of Mandate/Trust territories lose \u2018when internationalism stopped working?\u2019 Pedersen answers as far as her chronological parameters, circa 1920-1939, will allow; but I find most compelling the historical nuggets she leaves to suggest that the answer may be found in the political, legal, and economic deformations of sovereignty in our present-day world. In the rise and demise of internationalism embodied in the League in the interwar period, Pedersen finds the historical roots of sovereignty\u2019s present deformations. Through a historical analysis of the \u201cpractices and proclivities\u201d (406) of Mandate Commission members, the colonially-minded politicians and administrators they aided or opposed, experts on international law, and activists claiming rights, Zionist protections, and/or the vague promise of self-determination in Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, Pedersen parses the conflictual meanings of sovereignty and historicizes its redefinition. Although plenty of references to it pepper the rest of the text, her main arguments about sovereignty appear in Chapter 7, \u201cThe Struggle over Sovereignty,\u201d and again in Chapters 8 and 9, the latter, a case study of the mandate territory Iraq\u2019s transition to statehood. These chapters fit into Part III of the book, entitled \u201cNew Times, New Norms, 1927-1933\u201d and coincide with German membership in the League, a period which Pedersen refers to as the League\u2019s most \u201cinnovative\u201d and \u201ccreative.\u201d In Chapters 7 and 8, Pedersen shows that, from about 1925 through 1930, through the cases of Ruanda-Urundi, Southwest Africa, and Tanganyika, the Permanent Mandates Commission upheld the principle that imperial powers were not sovereign in the territories they administered as League of Nations Mandates. But rather than \u201cdeprive the mandatory powers of sovereignty\u201d as the Mandates Commission prevented the integration of mandate territories \u2014 South West Africa, Ruanda-Urundi, and Tanganyika \u2014 into the adjacent Union of South Africa, Belgian Congo, and Kenya, the League created \u201cspaces from which sovereignty was banished altogether (232).\u201d Concurrently, the League\u2019s commitment to development led to a \u201cdecoupling of legal sovereignty and economic control (203),\u201d with the administering powers retaining possession of mandated territories\u2019 \u2018economic sovereignty\u2019 even as the League curtailed their \u2018legal sovereignty.\u2019 Nowhere is this more starkly revealed than in the case of Ruanda-Urundi. Three years after the League forbade the Belgians to administer Ruanda-Urundi as part of Belgian Congo, a decimating famine swept underdeveloped northeastern Rwanda in 1928. The Belgians used the famine to justify coercive labor practices for cultivation, portage, and roadwork, despite the League\u2019s restriction of forced labor in mandate territories. The decoupling of sovereignties posed a conundrum for Britain, which set the standard for \u2018good, civilizational governance\u2019 characteristic of the League\u2019s \u2018Lugardian\u2019 age in the 1920s. Eager to preserve its exclusive commercial privilege by making Iraq into a client state and thereby shutting the \u2018open door\u2019 that the League pledged to protect in mandate territories, Britain shepherded Iraq\u2019s \u2018emancipation\u2019 through the Mandates Commission from 1921 to 1932. On 3 October 1932, Iraq was admitted to membership in the League of Nations, an event that marked \u201cthe first case in which the pre-eminent global institution changed the international standing of a territory\u2014from \u2018dependent\u2019 to \u2018independent\u2019\u2014without war and through member vote (263),\u201d but at what cost? Pedersen explains that Britain secured international approval for Iraq\u2019s transition from Mandate to member of the League by striking \u201ctwo consequential bargains \u2026 one over the extent of Iraq\u2019s economic and military sovereignty (269),\u201d over which the former administrator ensured its continued control, and \u201cthe second over its internal authority (269),\u201d where \u201cIraq was free to run its internal administration much as it liked (283),\u201d meaning, free to do away with the fragile protections that mandate status had afforded minorities, Kurds and Assyrians among them. Here, Pedersen sees a new definition of \u2018independence\u2019 emerging, one that had been, during mandate rule, evacuated of legal sovereignty even as its economic sovereignty was assigned to territorial administrators. The Mandates Commission thus became the bureaucratic, procedural body through which the League \u201chelped make the end of empire imaginable, and normative statehood possible,\u201d not by triumphantly conferring political sovereignty to formerly subjugated inhabitants of mandate territories, but rather by allowing internationalization to lay the groundwork for the possibility that territorial control was no longer \u201cessential to the maintenance of global power (406).\u201d I now turn away from the empirically detailed case studies that serve as the backbone for Pedersen\u2019s claims about sovereignty, empire, and its internationalist alternative as the historical roots of normative statehood to examine more closely the ways in which the League made the internationalist dynamic. Pedersen\u2019s history is not a conventional diplomatic one. Her innovative approach to state and non-state actors through official and personal archives combines a collective biographical sketch of \u2018the guardians\u2019 with an analysis of their commitment to textualism and legalism. Personality and practice of League personnel resulted in serendipitous combinations and seemingly accidental convergences, and the mandates system itself emerged from these by the skin of its teeth. Through Pedersen\u2019s precise and witty prose we learn how the inner workings of the League\u2019s nascent bureaucratic structure engendered the dynamic of internationalization that set the course to our unevenly globalized world of disparate states. The towering figure of veteran British colonial administrator Sir Frederick D. Lugard excepted, the Permanent Mandates Commission \u2018guardians\u2019 \u2014 who served to bring consensus, peace, and order to the \u201cconflict zone where empires clashed and territory changed hands (405),\u201d \u2014 that is, to the fifteen mandated territories taken from Germany in the First World War \u2014 were rather secondary, forgettable figures in their respective national and colonial histories. Yet Pedersen offers a close-up view of the Mandates Commission members as a way of situating the Commission vis-\u00e0-vis the League Secretariat and Council, the colonial and foreign ministries of administering powers, and the political activists and lobbies engaging the mandates system to various ends. Pedersen brings the guardians to life as she reveals the small, intricate dynamics that laid very broad strokes of the internationalism that gradually became so immutable as to have \u2018stopped working\u2019 in the case of Palestine (Ch. 12) as the League fell apart in the late 1930s. Her attention to persona leads one to ask: Had these men (and woman) not been the members of the Commission, might the story have ended differently? For instance, the \u201cpedantic\u201d and \u201csocially inept\u201d Dutch member of the Commission, D. F. W. Van Rees was the one to write the memoranda that pushed the body to \u201cestablish the principle that mandatory powers were \u2018not sovereign\u2019 in the mandated territories (206).\u201d Lugard\u2019s seniority, not to mention his veteran experience in diverse colonial settings allowed his paternalistic racial thinking to trump the muted suggestions of his much younger predecessor on the Mandates Commission, William Ormsby-Gore, that white prejudices prevented civilized governance in Mandate territories. And so civilizational paternalism, a transparent veneer for racism, prevailed as a League standard. To the consternation of the French, Portuguese and Belgian members Italian member and president of the Commission, Alberto Theodoli, delighted in championing the petitioning process that allowed the hitherto voiceless inhabitants of the territories to be heard, albeit in a much regulated way, on the world stage in Geneva. Yet, although in 1923 Theodoli penned the \u201cstrongest condemnation of white settler colonialism \u2026 that ever appeared in a Commission report (125),\u201d in 1935 he defended Italy\u2019s conquest of Abyssinia. More than the sum of these vignettes, Pedersen milks far-flung archival records in no fewer than ten countries to uncover just what underlay the League\u2019s civilizational and internationalist rhetoric. The practice beneath the talk\u2014the bureaucratic structure built from scratch, the document review, the leaks and the back-channeling that accompanied periodic sessions\u2014conflicted with the \u201caims, claims, and interests of the powers and peoples with which it was involved\u201d to produce \u201cmeanings and outcomes no one had intended (406).\u201d In other words, the League of Nations, and, in particular, its Mandates Commission, went further than most anyone in 1920 ever supposed it would, towards regulating the \u2018international frontier\u2019 of the interwar era. In part, Pedersen explains, this was due to a common devotion to textualism that enabled Commission members, civil servants, and functionaries thrust into the seat of \u2018expert\u2019 on a world stage to elaborate a \u201cdistinct and separate status for mandates under international law \u2026 as determinations were made on one sticky question after another,\u201d (206) thereby assuring their own utility and gradually acquiring the sort of authority that made international consent a prerequisite for any changes to the mandate system. Europeans, of course, were not the only actors preoccupied by the international frontier the mandate territories comprised. Other actors appear in Pedersen\u2019s pages, including: the American political scientist and statesman, Ralph Bunche, who would become a primary architect of the UN\u2019s Trusteeship system; Olaf Nelson, the prosperous merchant of Western Samoa whom the British viewed, rightly or wrongly, as the ringleader of the Samoan civil disobedience movement known at the time as the Mau movement; and Michael Leahy, an intrepid and rapacious adventurer who explored Mandated New Guinea\u2019s highlands. These activists, admittedly far flung and of varying stripes, at times formed their own arguably coherent internationalist networks. Yet, outside of Zionists, and to a lesser extent, pan-Arabists, anti-imperial activists do not collectively figure in Pedersen\u2019s book. From chapter to chapter, I wondered about alternative internationalisms with an interwar genesis, and whether some of the figures that Pedersen portrays might have intersected with transregional circuits of mobilization that made much of new precedents in international law issuing from the League. Humanitarian activists are represented only in the Anti-Slavery Society, but what of the legalist civic republicans and freemasons of the French Ligue des Droits de l\u2019Homme who plagued the League in their support of petitioners from territories under French administration? The word \u2018communism\u2019 is absent from the book although the Third Communist International turned its focus to colonial territories in the summer of 1920, precisely as the League and its mandates system began to congeal in Geneva. By 1922, the French government had adopted anticommunism as a cornerstone of burgeoning anti-revolutionary policy across metropole and empire. Petitioners to the League thus figured in the crosshairs of French administrators, as did black internationalists. By pioneering an internationalist approach to interwar imperial history through the lens of the League, Pedersen\u2019s work asks for similar work to be undertaken from other historical vantage points. Having done so much, her work reveals how much is still to be done.\n\nReview by Elizabeth F. Thompson, University of Virginia Susan Pedersen\u2019s story is a dispassionate and devastating autopsy of an institution deformed by a congenital disease. Pedersen reveals how the League of Nations\u2019 mandate system routinely violated its mission to guide advanced states in tutoring new nations in self-government. Tutelage was rendered unlikely at the outset, as these states used brutal force to occupy\u2014and put down revolts in\u2014Syria, Iraq, Palestine, Western Samoa, and Southwest Africa. Subsequent chapters describe nightmarish measures to sustain mandatory rule over the next two decades: South Africa\u2019s 1922 air bombing of family camps in South West Africa (118); French troops\u2019 parading of rebel corpses through Damascus streets in 1925 (146); New Zealand\u2019s 1929 massacre of eleven Samoans in a peaceful demonstration (187); Belgium\u2019s resort to massive, unpaid forced labor to build roads in response to a 1929 famine in Rwanda, (252); France\u2019s 1938 transfer of Syria\u2019s valuable port of Alexandretta to Turkey, against the non-Turkish majority\u2019s wishes, forcing 40,000 Arabs and Armenians to flee (352); and Britain\u2019s destruction of Jaffa\u2019s old city and methodical dynamiting of peasant houses in the 1936-39 Palestinian revolt (373-375). More chilling, still, is to read how agents of the League of Nations endorsed this violence. From its birth, Pedersen argues, the mandate system functioned through the collusion of colonial empires to contain their rivalries and repress challenges to imperialism unleashed by World War I and the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. The Permanent Mandates Commission (PMC), an oversight body, was staffed with veterans of European colonial endeavors who regarded former subjects of the Ottoman and German empires as backward peoples who, like children, were in need of the rod of discipline. Pedersen\u2019s account is so effective because she fully inhabits the minds of these European elites. Her prose captures their confident legalism and pretense to civilization, then juxtaposes these with the carnage they authorized. For scholars of the mandated territories like myself, it is no surprise that these so-called \u2018trusts of civilization\u2019 were ruled no more humanely than regular colonies. But this is no mere story of how the wolves ran the chicken coop. Pedersen\u2019s study of the PMC\u2019s records reveals an unexpected health benefit: bureaucrats at the League of Nations\u2019 headquarters in Geneva rescued the mandate system from the jaws of brute colonialism to place it under public scrutiny and at times, legal restraint. The hero of her tale is William Rappard, the Swiss director of the Mandates Section. A Wilsonian at heart, Rappard wanted to hold the Great Powers accountable in a democratizing world (52). He struggled against the near-hegemonic power of racist colonialism to air the dirty laundry of mandates and to establish precedents for international regulation. \u201cBureaucracy, more than idealism, tamed the demons of power,\u201d Pedersen wrote (46). By insisting on a paper trail and by holding meetings, bureaucrats like Rappard fostered an unprecedented public conversation. The talk generated at Geneva fostered a community of observers and activists who would lay the foundations for the United Nations and the internationalist world of Non-Government Organizations that monitor human rights violations today. At the core of the mandate system, Pedersen concludes, was \u201cthe play of geopolitical interest and the force of international scrutiny and \u2018talk\u2019\u201d (406). There is much to engage with in Pedersen\u2019s rich and nuanced argument. I confine myself here to comments I can offer as a specialist on the modern Middle East, which is the focus of five of the book\u2019s twelve chapters. First, Pedersen throws valuable light on what has long remained a black box for scholars of the interwar Middle East. Residents of the mandates of Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Transjordan, and Palestine sent hundreds \u2013 even thousands\u2014of petitions to Geneva between 1920 and 1939. Their persistence and their passionate advocacy of Wilsonian ideals is striking. As Pedersen shows, members of the Arab elite like Shakib Arslan, the Lebanese-Druze prince who lobbied the League in Geneva, adapted well to the new system and proved as legalistic as the PMC. However, almost all of their petitions were ignored or rejected as inadmissible. The star of Arabs\u2019 hopes for justice under international law proved to be a black hole of disappointment. Second, Arabs able to access the foreign press no doubt appreciated the new level of international scrutiny enabled by the League. On 18 February 1926, under the headline \u201cFrance Defends Policy in Syria,\u201d the New York Times wrote, \u201cThe cross-examination of a great colonial power in regard to its treatment of a weaker nationality took place here today for what is believed to be the first time in history.\u201d[4] The article details how the PMC subjected the architect of France\u2019s violent occupation of Syria, Robert de Caix, to a grueling interrogation on French \u2018misadministration,\u2019 in the wake of the Great Syrian Revolt. Yet, despite press coverage, public condemnation of French war crimes, and hundreds of Syrian petitions demanding independence under Article 22 of the League covenant, the PMC voted to uphold French rule. Pedersen uncovered correspondence demonstrating how Commissioners caved so much to French pressure that they did not even require reforms. Pedersen\u2019s book confirms what Arabs of the era suspected: the machinery established in 1919 to guarantee rights to small nations and the rule of international law actually worked to subvert both. Here, as in other chapters, she shows that, at the PMC, geopolitical interest trumped public scrutiny. The extent of damage done to the future of politics and the reign of law in the Arab world has not yet been fully calculated. Some historians have suggested that, like a cancerous cell, colonial violence replicated itself on every level of culture, society, politics, eroding the vigorous culture of liberal tolerance and respect for law that had once prevailed.[5] Given its focus on the institution in Geneva, The Guardians cannot and should not be expected to pursue these effects, but the book\u2019s greatest promise, in my view, is that it may inspire a new round of scholarship placing local history in dialogue with international institutions based in Europe. Pedersen presents her book as the first \u201ccomprehensive history of the mandate system\u201d (10) but it should not therefore be regarded as the definitive history. The Guardians opens the door to research that may overturn not only our understanding of global politics after the 1919 Wilsonian moment but also reinvent the discipline of international history itself. I hazard here two hypotheses about what a future synthesis of center-periphery in the mandate system might look like. First, future research might widen and reshape the mandate system. From the standpoint of Geneva, Pedersen argues that the system began as a vehicle for imperial collusion, but that by the 1930s, \u201cthe League helped make the end of empire imaginable\u201d (11, 406). Imaginable to colonial officials, perhaps, but many outside of the halls of colonial and foreign ministries had long before then imagined a world without empire. I am struck that much of the work of the PMC involved rationalizing how to dismiss petitions and critics. The boundaries of the mandate system were apparently quite unstable, suggesting that policing them was a key dynamic. The inclusion of anti-imperial critics and the Africans and Asians living under mandates within Pedersen\u2019s international society and within the mandate system would likely take this history into new directions and also suggest a new narrative arc. The system was not, for example, congenitally a club of colonial collusion. According to the papers of Woodrow Wilson and minutes of the Supreme Council in 1919, the American president vigorously upheld his promise that the war should not serve the extension of colonial empire. He fought repeatedly against delegates of the British Dominions and Japan who wished to annex portions of the German Empire. And he urged that \u2018A\u2019 mandates assigned to formerly Ottoman peoples grant them provisional sovereignty. He angered the British and French by insisting on sending a commission to poll Syrians on their political preferences.[6] Likewise, another of the Big Four, French Premier Georges Clemenceau, was an anti-imperialist who fully controlled his colonial lobby as long as he remained in office, until January 1920. Further research might ask why it was that small colonial lobbies in London and Paris held sway against significant opposition. We know that by 1921-1922, the British and French parliaments drastically cut budgets for the Iraqi and Syrian mandates, having lost interest. We might profit by placing the PMC within a wider field of talk, and reconsider what factors turned it into a colonial club, after the departure of Wilson and Clemenceau from the scene. We might also reconsider whether self-rule was truly unimaginable in the 1920s, or whether the PMC only made it seem so. Second, future research may also inquire as to whether the League\u2019s greater importance is revealed in the mandates, not in Geneva, as Pedersen contends (5). From the local viewpoint, the international talk generated by the League was not so sanguine a side effect. In Syria, it served to highlight how it had been deliberately excluded from the family of nations endowed with rights. It may be that the bitterness this caused may set mandates apart from regular colonies, where the possibility of equality under international law had not been inscribed in founding charters. The consequences of betrayal were, as I have argued Justice Interrupted, turned Arabs and Turks away from international law, with grave consequences for the future.[7] Shakib Arslan, the embittered Arab lobbyist, in the 1930s turned toward cooperation with Nazi Germany against the Allies\u2019 League. His close associate, Rashid Rida, also abandoned his liberalism after the PMC upheld the French mandate. An Islamic scholar, he told readers of his popular magazine, The Lighthouse, that Europe clearly intended justice under international law for Christians only. And he inspired the 1928 founding of the Muslim Brotherhood, which opted out of liberal universalism in favor of a separate, Islamic justice. From this schism grew the militant, anti-Western brand of Islamism that engulfs Syria and Iraq today.[8] In the long-term, airing dirty laundry without then washing it proved to be a detriment to the League\u2019s internationalism and to the future of human rights in the Middle East. Turkish historians debate the deleterious impact of Allies\u2019 imperialist manipulation of the tribunals established to prosecute war crimes against Armenians. Liberals in Istanbul who inclined toward cooperation with the League were undercut when the Allies justified the parceling out of Anatolia amongst themselves by asserting the Turkish peoples\u2019 collective guilt. The evident bias of the tribunals played into the hands of nationalists who rejected international jurisdiction. Taner Ak\u00e7am believes that moment spoiled the future of human rights in the Turkish Republic.[9] Pedersen\u2019s book offers rewarding, if deeply pessimistic, lessons on the difficulty of legislating changes in mentality, of challenging military power with law, and in reforming institutions. Those lessons set an important agenda for the evolution of international history beyond the study of European institutions. A truly global history may inspire the international talk that Pedersen rightly argues is crucial to an impartial and international system of justice.\n\nReview by Trygve Throntveit, Independent Scholar For all its narrative sweep and analytical power, Susan Pedersen\u2019s The Guardians is essentially a study in irony. Her subject, the League of Nations mandates system, was the primary mechanism for colonial reform in an institution viewed by millions worldwide as civilization\u2019s response to the mass psychopathy of imperialism and its consequence, world war. And yet, the League\u2019s Permanent Mandates Commission (PMC) served from its first session to shore up the British and French empires against the anti-imperialist tide that the Great War unleashed. Pedersen\u2019s main characters, the PMC\u2019s commissioners in Geneva, were overwhelmingly influenced by British imperial ideology, which viewed the empire\u2019s existing colonies as sites of political tutelage opening culturally distinct pathways to civilization. And yet the British, straining to reconcile their mandated duties with indigenous demands and their own changing interests, were the leading innovators of alternative arrangements that served to make statehood normative, even while rendering sovereignty amorphous and often meaningless for post-colonial states. In a further irony, it was the territorially ravenous Germans who catalyzed that process by insisting that sovereignty over Mandates rested with the League (in which Germany was included after 1926) rather than the mandatory powers (from which Germany was excluded). Finally, Pedersen argues, the PMC was from its beginnings dominated by a \u2018textualist\u2019 rather than political ethos, committed to holding mandatory powers accountable to the letter of their mandate texts rather than evolving local and global conditions. And yet, by publicizing both the policies of its member states and many of the resentments and claims of their legal wards, the PMC inadvertently undermined the colonial system of political tutelage it was intended to preserve. Though neither the PMC nor the mandatory powers were interested in \u201cextending the right of self-determination\u201d to their wards, Pedersen argues, the mandates system nonetheless became \u201cthe tool through which the imperial order would be transformed\u201d (3-4). Pedersen wraps these ironic narratives together into a remarkably coherent and readable origin story of our contemporary world\u2014a world in which sovereignty is inviolably sacred in theory but fragmented and frequently irrelevant in practice.[10] There is no comparable treatment of the mandates system; the best works to date (which Pedersen has mastered and generously credited in her copious notes) have focused on individual Mandates, mandatory powers, or regions.[11] There are of course much broader works on the League, some more comprehensive than The Guardians in terms of the number of Mandates and events addressed.[12] But these provide nothing approaching Pedersen\u2019s exhaustive treatment of the mandates system\u2019s most transformative episodes, nor her focused argument regarding their origins, consequences, and collective import. The depth and authority of her scholarship is rooted in her impressive (at times astonishing) grasp of the relevant sources, including a host of national and thematic historical literatures as well as primary materials, in multiple languages and on multiple continents. As a factual exposition, compelling interpretation, and multi-archival excavation of the mandates system\u2019s history, The Guardians is unsurpassed and likely to remain so for a long time. Yet like any great work of history\u2014and that is what Pedersen has produced\u2014The Guardians makes interpretive claims that are important in part because they are open to challenge. One is her claim that the increased burden of \u201cimperial governance\u201d and promotion of \u201cnormative statehood\u201d that the mandates system effected \u201cwas not what its architects and officials had intended\u201d (13). This depends on the identity of the architects and officials in question and, in Pedersen\u2019s case, on collapsing the two roles. Pedersen traces the system\u2019s origins and early development to Britons intent on universalizing their nation\u2019s tradition\u2014or rather ideology\u2014of consultative, humane, tutelary empire. According to her, this was also the intention of President Woodrow Wilson and other Americans who pushed for international oversight of former German and Ottoman colonies during the Paris Peace Conference (18-19, 24-25, 168). But while chapters 4 and 5 clearly demonstrate the degree to which Britons infused the PMC with their distinct imperial ideology and practices, Pedersen\u2019s own claims and evidence suggest that Wilson\u2019s far more radical vision of justice through international deliberation was also consequential for the development of the mandates system, and indeed the international system generally.[13] As Pedersen notes in her introduction, it was the power of public criticism, via the League Assembly, that forced the Council to convene the PMC in the first place (2). It was that same power that forced the mandatories to make promises that ultimately undermined their imperial practices and set the stage for decolonization after World War II (4-7, 9-10). This instantiation of Anglo-American political habits in international political machinery was Wilson\u2019s goal even before America entered the war.[14] Most important, it was Wilson\u2019s insistence that the slaughter of the Great War could only be redeemed by a new order promoting the wellbeing and political autonomy of all the world\u2019s peoples that prevented the outright annexation of conquered territories by the Allies[15] and, later, encouraged European publics to hold their governments accountable for the fates of distant and alien populations.[16] Another of Pedersen\u2019s important but challengeable arguments is that the PMC was a fundamentally legalist or \u201ctextualist\u201d rather than political institution (64-66). The PMC\u2019s textualist ethos is amply demonstrated in chapter 2. Here Pedersen shows that early, consistent, and highly public reversion to Article 22 and the various mandate texts allowed PMC bulldogs such as the Swiss William Rappard to establish an effective role for the commission, despite minimal direct authority over the mandatory powers. But as Pedersen herself notes (65), textualism and politics are not mutually exclusive, and in explaining the contest between Britain and the PMC over Palestine (chapter 12) she confusingly overdraws the distinction. Britain\u2019s effort to repudiate its responsibility to secure a \u201cJewish national home\u201d in Palestine and limit Jewish immigration in order to appease the restless Arab majority was indeed, as Pedersen claims, a political challenge to a legal system founded in texts. But the PMC\u2019s use of those same texts to elevate \u201cthe obligation to support Jewish immigration above the obligation to foster representative institutions\u201d was equally political in its inspiration and effects\u2014the goal being to solve Europe\u2019s Jewish refugee crisis, and the effect being to create the demographic preconditions for an ethnic Jewish state (358). British policymakers naturally condemned what Pedersen, following their lead, describes as \u201ca legalistic oversight apparatus that made flexible decision-making impossible\u201d (391). But what really rankled was the PMC\u2019s political power to force unwanted decisions upon them. These two problematic claims\u2014regarding the mandates system\u2019s imperialist purpose and textualist practice\u2014are important because of their implications for the League project as a whole. Building on them, Pedersen argues that the mandates system not only failed but was never even intended to do what millions expected it to do: namely, bring self-determination nearer for politically oppressed populations in the former German and Ottoman colonies and, by force of example, across the world. This is a roundabout way of saying that Wilsonianism failed. In Pedersen\u2019s mandates system we find Wilson\u2019s dream of a global founding text--structuring forums for the public management of political change and the promotion of consensual government--doomed from the start by its inherent paternalism and legalism. A slightly wider lens, bringing both U.S. diplomatic history and European geopolitics into view, complicates this picture. For all his paternalism, it was Wilson, through his wartime rhetoric and his efforts at Paris, who did the most to prevent the outright annexation of the territories that became Mandates; Wilson who publicly insisted on the primacy of indigenous over imperial interests; and Wilson who imposed the requirement, however long the timeline, of eventual self-government.[17] On the other hand, it was U.S. abstention from League membership that eviscerated the League\u2019s collective security apparatus, made sanctions against powerful aggressors unworkable, and encouraged France and Britain to shore up and expand their territorial spheres of influence as insurance against another world war.[18] Meanwhile, American economic nationalism hampered the economic reconstruction of Europe and exacerbated the global economic crisis of the 1930s, prompting a neo-imperialist quest for autarky by the world\u2019s major powers that further burdened their colonial subjects and hastened a war costing millions of their lives.[19] In sum, there was indeed a gulf between the anticolonial hopes invested in the League by subjugated peoples and the imperialist agenda imposed upon it by European officials, a gulf widened by a striking mismatch between the text of the League Covenant and the political realities of the international system. For as nearly every meeting of the Council reveals, the League Covenant was structured to include U.S. participation, while the League itself was forced to endure U.S. obstruction. It seems, therefore, too simple to claim that the mandates system functioned as it was intended to function when it promoted \u201cimperial best practices\u201d while \u201cpushing self-determination off the table.\u201d To the extent that Wilson had anything to do with its origins, the mandates system was intended to promote (sometimes, granted, at painfully slow pace) increasing levels of political participation and eventual self-government for the populations of the mandated territories\u2014perhaps through independent statehood, perhaps through extension of civil and political rights under an alternative regime. As Pedersen demonstrates, the PMC\u2019s dominant personalities worked from very early on to point the system in a different direction. And yet because of its Wilsonian roots, others found opportunities to put it to progressive uses. Invoking the principle of international accountability that Wilson had preached and the Covenant endorsed, the PMC cultivated a publicizing function that otherwise marginalized peoples found ways to coopt. Through the petition process, for instance, claimants \u201cmobilized movements and built up mass support\u201d that \u201callowed them to speak in a multi-vocal, international arena\u201d and, in many cases, \u201cfundamentally altered what the mandatory power not only could but also wanted to do\u201d (94). Meanwhile, adverting to the system\u2019s founding texts, Germany argued successfully that changes in the administration of mandated territories could not be made without international approval, because sovereignty did not reside with the mandatory power, but with League, and only in trust. This, Pedersen argues, was \u201cthe most significant achievement of the mandates system,\u201d for it established that the mandatory power \u201ccould not deny sovereignty to its wards forever\u201d (231). Pedersen claims that the Covenant played no major role in this achievement (232), and that League oversight did not bring self-determination any nearer for the populations in question (261). But as she goes on to show, the international oversight of Mandates stipulated in the League Covenant helped push Britain to change Iraq\u2019s status, despite fears among the majority of the PMC\u2019s members that it was not yet ready for independence (chapter 9). True, the new Iraq remained in many ways dependent on and beholden to Britain. But it had nonetheless moved along the spectrum of independence in a positive direction, from official ward to recognized state. None of this is to say that the mandates system or the League itself succeeded in democratizing world politics. They did not. It is rather to challenge prevailing assumptions regarding the reasons why. The League\u2019s failure to create a more just and stable international order was not due to the essentially imperialistic or inflexibly legalistic character of the structure designed at Paris in 1919. It was due to the crippling of the actual League\u2019s political capacities by a recalcitrant United States. The League might have developed in an imperialistic yet politically impotent direction even with United States participation, but we can never know. What we can know\u2014though not from Pedersen\u2019s book\u2014is the extent to which U.S. absence encouraged that very development. That knowledge is important: it should check the prevailing tendency to judge President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s original vision of deliberative, democratic international governance bereft of positive lessons. But one book can convey only so many lessons, and it is hard to imagine Pedersen cramming any more into The Guardians than she already has. She has shown us how people shape the institutions that constrain them, even at the highest levels of national and international politics. She has shown us how rhetoric, slogans, and promises, however empty, establish norms that can inspire the powerless and constrain the powerful. She has shown us that national and international history, politics and culture, and the world of ideas and the world of material and structural forces are inextricably linked and mutually constitutive. Above, all, she has shown us our own world in a new light, tracing the contingent origins of several of its most challenging features. \u201cWe live,\u201d Pedersen writes, \u201cin a world of formally independent states of very varying capacity, and if we look back to the mandates system, we can see this order emerging\u201d (13).\n\nReview by Andrew Webster, Murdoch University \"We are in the midst of a great revival of scholarly interest in the League\u201d, writes Susan Pedersen (424, note 7). Her well-known article in the American Historical Review in 2007 surveyed the surge of new historical research on the League of Nations; nearly ten years later the wave rolls on, still growing as it moves.[20] Several developments lie behind this outpouring: the end of the Cold War and its ingrained assumptions of bipolarity; a widening definition of security, incorporating elements of what is sometimes termed \u2018human security;\u2019 renewed attention to issues of sovereignty and global governance; and the cultural turn in recent work on international relations. Histories of the League until the 1990s were almost universally, perhaps inevitably, bound and defined by a narrative of \u2018failure.\u2019 This stultified real understanding of what the League did\u2014and caricatured what it did not do. Viewing the defunct organisation as a case study demonstrating the true dynamics of power in the post-1945 world, historians and political scientists alike dismissed it as useless: an artificial creation based upon trust, voluntary cooperation, and altruism that was unable to account for the natural imperatives of self-interest inherent in all states existing within a starkly competitive international system. Such a focus upon a state-centred order and the maintenance of peace, rejecting the possibilities for the provision of security or for international disarmament contained in the Covenant, formed the basis of the prevailing view of the League as a failure. This became so ingrained that many prominent studies of the roles and practices of international institutions made scant or no mention of it at all. The wave of research since the 1990s, on the contrary, has demonstrated just how broad the extent of the League\u2019s work was, and how great was its impact. The best contributions to this new scholarship have drawn upon the League archives directly\u2014in contrast to earlier work which was almost entirely based on the papers of individual states\u2014and tell a story in which the League was a functioning internationalist presence laying the foundations for modern regimes of global governance. Further, they embody the dramatic shift of attention in research away from the \u2018traditional\u2019 security sphere and towards a new focus on issues such as minority protections and human rights, international systems for combating disease or drug and sex trafficking, the promotion of intellectual cooperation and the role of global public opinion, the creation of new frameworks of international economics and finance, and, as in the book reviewed here, the relationship between Mandates and the persistence of empire.[21] In all of this, they are really returning to an awareness of the League\u2019s role which was well understood by its contemporaries. As the eminent historian Sir Charles Webster concluded in 1933: \u201cTo a far greater degree than even the boldest thinkers contemplated in 1919 the League has reached out into almost every field of human effort. Conceived primarily as a compact to maintain the peace, it has been used as an active agency of international cooperation in a world in which the need for such a body is growing at an ever-increasing pace.\u201d[22] With The Guardians, Susan Pedersen has produced an impressive, deeply researched and extremely engaging history of the mandates system, which was a key component among the League\u2019s founding tasks. As she writes, \u201cevery allied power wanted compensation for war losses and suffering; most thought annexation of their conquests no more than their due\u201d (1). The imperial powers only reluctantly gave in to international sentiment, and especially American pressure, to accept in Article 22 of the Covenant that their rule of the African, Pacific, and Middle Eastern territories seized from Germany and the Ottoman empire during the First World War should be framed as conditional, not absolute. They were to be held only in \u201csacred trust\u201d for the administered peoples who were \u201cnot yet able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world,\u201d and exercised on behalf of the League and indeed \u201ccivilisation\u201d as a whole (408). The League Secretariat thus included a Mandates Section, which was given the job of reviewing the imperial powers\u2019 administration, while the mandatory powers were required to submit annual reports on their administration to a permanent commission of eminent individuals appointed by the League Council. But nothing was specified about how long such mandatory control was to last, the conditions under which it might be considered to have been completed, or how the rulings of the League\u2019s officials were to be enforced upon the governing powers. The result, as was admitted from the start, was \u201cat best a compromise between partisans of imperial annexation and those who wanted all colonies placed under international control\u201d (2). Pedersen\u2019s story is an exploration of how this void of governance was steadily filled\u2014how the League as an institution made itself central to the theory and practice of post-war imperialism. As with several other spheres of the League\u2019s work that have been addressed in recent studies, Pedersen provides the first genuinely new history on the Mandates as a complete system since the 1940s.[23] Her analysis of the workings of this system is really the identification of an interacting set of relationships: between theories of internationalism and of empire, between the League and its member states, between ruling powers and local populations, and between colonial administrators and international bureaucrats. The narrative thus bypasses entirely the tired story of the League as \u2018failure.\u2019 Indeed, it implicitly makes clear how absurdly simplistic it is to describe that complex and evolving phenomenon in such reductive terms. The point for Pedersen is rather to examine what the League created, what ideas it developed, what norms of international behaviour and interaction it established, and its relationship with the shifting language and forms of imperialism during the interwar decades. That she accomplishes this so adeptly is based in no small part upon the staggering breadth of her research, including archives in nine countries, the League\u2019s own papers in Geneva, and published sources in English, French and German. Finally, it matters that Pedersen also writes beautifully, with an eye for the sharply-framed insight\u2014for instance when she identifies \u201cthe influential, internationally minded Anglo-American scholars and writers whom the League founders always had in mind when they spoke of \u2018public opinion\u2019\u201d (149). The task of the Permanent Mandates Commission (PMC), supported by the Mandates Section of the Secretariat, was to oversee the victorious imperial powers\u2019 administration of their mandatory acquisitions. It was in principle the subjection of imperial rule to international control. Even here, to say that the task was to exercise \u2018oversight\u2019 is a vast simplification: Article 22 empowered the PMC merely to advise the Council on \u201call matters relating to the observance of the mandates\u201d (409). The early story is consistent with other aspects of the League\u2019s work during its first years, in particular its small scale and uncertain beginnings as it sought to define its own purpose and methods. Only fierce criticism at the first and second League Assemblies, in 1920 and 1921, forced the Council at last to actually convene the permanent commission specified in the Covenant. During the decade which followed, that commission worked out its own role and philosophical approach through argument and practice, not based on fixed principles or abstract theory. What quickly became clear was that facilitating national self-determination was to be no part of its agenda. The main task was the rehabilitation of the imperial order. One way to read Pedersen\u2019s book is as a study of the evolving process of states, local populations, and the League in coming to grips for the first time with the meaning, duties, and practicalities of global governance. What was new about the mandates system above all was its creation of a \u201cglobal web of talk\u201d (120): an organised framework of public scrutiny and publicity. As she notes, \u201cLeague oversight could not force the mandatory powers to govern mandated territories differently; instead, it obliged them to say they were governing them differently\u201d (4, italics in original). It was the embodiment of the contemporary belief in the transformative power of public opinion, that transparency could and would overcome all obstacles. The great champion of the League, Lord Robert Cecil, insisted that \u201cin a democratic age, everything depends upon public opinion\u201d. He told the first League Assembly in 1920: It is quite true that by far the most powerful weapon at the command of the League of Nations is not the economic or the military weapon or any other weapon of material force. By far the strongest weapon we have is the weapon of public opinion.[24] This could operate on two levels: first, domestically\u2014through the scrutiny of government foreign policy by electorates to monitor compliance with League ideals and the application of pressure via public expressions of approval or disapproval; second, internationally\u2014through the scrutiny of national policies in the global public forum of the League to monitor compliance with international norms and expose those states guilty of infractions. It was the role of publicity at the international level, through the scrutiny of states in the global forum of the League and its role as a discursive arena, which was vital to the functioning in practice of the mandates system. This poses the question of whether talking about new means of governing territories did in fact lead to action in governing differently, as Pedersen asserts. Certainly, that the talk in Geneva could shape the landscape within which states operated was believed at the time. An authority on British constitutional law opined in 1922 that \u201cThe true mode of securing the just carrying out of the [mandates] system lies in bringing to bear on any abuses the public opinion of the League, and especially of the country whose methods are pronounced faulty.\u201d[25] The mandatory powers found their mistakes and abuses the subject of publicity and controversy in Geneva. Some reacted by attempting to modify their own behaviour; others remained recalcitrant. The League of Nations Union in Britain certainly insisted that publicity worked. By 1927, the Permanent Mandates Commission was held up as a model of high-minded imperial administration: \u201cAbuses in mandated territories are now almost non-existent. The commissioners\u2019 is not an easy task, but they fulfil it nobly.\u201d[26] But was publicity enough? The not-infrequent imputation by critics has since been precisely this: that the League was nothing more than a \u2018talk shop.\u2019 Yet talking was really what the League did best. Time after time, when faced with difficulties, it did not descend into stalemate but rather functioned as a genuinely operative forum for transacting international negotiations. We should not scorn the contemporary importance and value of \u2018talk\u2019 and publicity. Most states had no wish to be held up before the eyes of the world as a transgressor, an aggressor, a back-slider, or colonial tyrant. True, when faced in the 1930s with revisionist states which had no interest in abiding by common norms of international behaviour, public opinion proved ineffective where supporters expected to use it most: collective security, maintaining peace and international conciliation. Yet it nevertheless powerfully influenced the management of functional questions and at the very least brought into focus issues that previously would have been dismissed as impossible to control. This did not operate in a single consistent form across the life of the mandates system. The conditionality and marginality of the level of League control over the Mandates needs to be emphasised. The League created a regime of scrutiny, appointing international bureaucrats and commissioners to exercise oversight on Mandate governance. But what emerges from Pedersen\u2019s narrative is the extent to which the experience in every Mandate took on a life of its own. Hence Pedersen divides her examination into three main chunks, broadly chronological, each containing three chapters addressing how specific Mandates responded to the guiding principles of that period. One downside, unfortunately, is that the chosen structure tends to connect the examination of key themes to the specific case studies, and so compartmentalises the analysis. The discussion of overlapping events across multiple Mandates, or the periodic unifying moments at critical sessions of the PMC, is also sometimes dispersed across multiple chapters. While this assists with analytical clarity, it sacrifices the simultaneity of discussions regarding multiple Mandates which existed at each PMC session and how that overlap influenced specific decisions. The sweeping approach also means that, in places, the book perhaps skips too lightly over moments that deserve closer reading. The first chunk covers 1923 to 1930 and three early crises, each linked to a different Mandate: South Africa and the violent suppression of the Bondelswarts in South West Africa in 1922, which \u201cdid more to crystallize the Commission\u2019s deals, define its practice, enhance its reputation, and make League oversight a reality, than any other conflict\u201d (113); France and the revolt in Syria in 1925-26, the most serious rebellion to take place in a mandated territory; and New Zealand and Western Samoa from 1927 to mid-1930s, where a well-organised movement for self-determination sought to call upon the Wilsonian ideals of 1919 by declaring and seeking to demonstrate their capacity to rule themselves. All the mandatory powers may have been intended, in theory, to assist in that process; instead, throughout this first decade they sought to quash such changes\u2014and the PMC assisted that work of containment. But it was no mere tool of the dominant British and French. Unlike other comparable bodies of independent international experts created by the League\u2014such as the Temporary Mixed Commission on Armaments of 1921-24\u2014the PMC had an independent standing and the ability at least to attempt to carve out its own role. Established by the terms of the Covenant itself, it possessed a legitimacy and indeed permanency that most other League bodies could never hope for. As such, it made itself central to the very process of governance, rather than being reduced to a mere generator of reports or suggestions for possible lines of progress. Here we can locate one of the critical moments in the development of something that can be called a \u2018system\u2019 of international governance: when imperial rulers, confronted by colonial resistance, found themselves looking to Geneva for the international legitimacy to answer attacks upon their rule. Over Syria, the PMC \u201cused the threat of a public inquiry to force the French to play the legitimation game\u201d (159). France verbally proclaimed its commitment to League ideals and the commission\u2019s conception of Mandates; in return, the commission openly accepted the validity of French rule. This cost the PMC any credibility among Arab nationalists, but that was not the point. Rather, \u201cthe aim was to enlist the great powers in a drama of public accountability that would legitimate this form of alien rule before a sometimes critical, newspaper-reading, Western public\u201d (168, italics in original). Western Samoa may have seen the most protracted, well-organized, and impressive campaign for self-determination of any mandated territory. But the guiding purpose embedded within the PMC by the end of the 1920s was that claims to self-determination were inadmissible. \u201cThe Samoans were to be governed in their best interest; if it was necessary for them to be locked up or held down to take their medicine, New Zealand should hold them down\u201d (181). Wellington, in turn, looked back to Geneva to legitimate and stabilise its rule of Samoa. The second chunk covers 1927 to 1933, the mandate system\u2019s \u201cmost innovative period\u201d (202), when German entry into the League, Italian revisionism, intense great-power diplomacy, and deepening global political-economic uncertainty all combined to broaden the PMC\u2019s approach far beyond its previous focus on (in essence) legitimating Anglo-French geopolitical aims. It was a period which saw the PMC acting as a genuine arena for negotiation over new international norms. The irony was that this came about in large part because of German pressure. Its leaders sought (for reasons that can justly be called cynical) to turn the language of internationalism into a reality, not because of any belief in the ideals being voiced, but because it formed a useful, immediate political tool to advance Germany\u2019s return to a position of global influence and power. As the only great power on the League Council without an imperial position, its tactic was to insist upon the strongest interpretation of the limits to imperial sovereignty, in order to limit the gains made by the powers now in territorial control and minimise German disadvantage. It was an approach paralleled in other arenas of German diplomacy. With its acceptance into the League, Germany also became an integral participant in the international disarmament process also. Those debates in Geneva saw German delegates employ their status as the only \u2018officially disarmed\u2019 power, by virtue of the strictures contained in the Treaty of Versailles, in their claim to Gleichberechtigung (meaning variously \u2018equality of status\u2019 or \u2018equality of rights\u2019). They continually harped back to the \u2018promises\u2019 to disarm made by the victorious powers in 1919: if the Allies did not fulfil their own obligations, then Germany should be free to rearm. Such claims were simply a political strategy aimed at winning concessions to cover their on-going illegal rearmament, but their propaganda value allowed them to position Germany as one of disarmament\u2019s chief supporters. For the PMC, the consequence identified by Pedersen was that Germany would \u201cbecome the most vigilant guardian of the mandates system\u201d and resistance to all efforts to turn them into de facto colonies (198). The three chapters in this second chunk correspond to three areas where issues of formal and informal sovereignty were put at stake: the PMC\u2019s successful opposition during 1925-31 to moves by Belgium (in the Congo), South Africa (in South West Africa) and Britain (in Tanganyika) towards outright annexation of their mandates; the tightening of economic control, by Belgium in Rwanda during 1925-32; and the British efforts during 1929-32 to make Iraq an \u2018independent\u2019 member of the League. The key theme in all these cases was the challenge to preconceived assumptions of imperial control. Establishing an agreed norm that mandatory powers were not politically or legally sovereign in their mandated territories was, as Pedersen asserts, probably \u201cthe most significant achievement of the mandates system\u201d as \u201cimperial powers decided to submit to a probably unenforceable norm\u201d. Publicity was key to the outcome. In a formal and semi-public setting, watched by the newly-arrived Germans and an international press corps, \u201cthe mandatory powers were constrained to reiterate their own promises. They did not want to do this \u2026 but with the question now an \u2018international\u2019 one, the imperial powers could not but submit\u201d (231-232). The third chunk covers 1933 to 1939, the period of the departure of Japan, Germany, and Italy from the League and so also in theory from the PMC (though the Japanese delegate retained his seat until late 1938.) The three chapters here cover: the legitimation crisis in Australia\u2019s rule over New Guinea; the debate over a repartition and redesignation of mandates during 1936-38, in the face of Nazi colonial claims and the diplomacy of appeasement; and the British experience in Palestine from 1929 through the Arab revolt of 1936-39. As Pedersen notes, the practices and culture established over the previous dozen or so years proved durable. Yet its ability to impact state behaviour was now greatly constricted, not only with the revisionist powers but with those which remained. Once the key conversations about international norms of governance ceased to take place via Geneva, they also \u201cno longer took the peace settlement, and especially did not take the mandates system, as their point of departure\u201d (294). This made it easier to ignore the PMC when desired and to throw out former objections to treating the mandates themselves as colonies. This comes out most clearly perhaps in the movement for \u2018colonial appeasement\u2019, where there was a blatant return to the treatment of mandates as the basic material of empire, to be traded as necessary for the interests of the imperial power. \u201cNot only desperate allied statesmen but equally British liberals and humanitarians, it became clear, could imagine handing Africans over to Nazis in order to preserve peace in Europe\u201d (326). We are accustomed by the traditional narrative of the League to see these years, including as they do the catastrophes in Manchuria and Ethiopia, as the climax of the League\u2019s failure, with all that followed until its formal demise dismissed as an irrelevant twilight. Yet the extension of scholarly attention beyond collective security has also made clear the extent to which this standard chronology is flawed, for it overlooks the continuing work in spheres such as international economics and finance, health, labour standards and humanitarian norms\u2014and with the mandates\u2014which went on through the late 1930s and into the following decade. Looking at the larger arc of the League\u2019s life across all its activities also reveals the problems with a scheme of periodisation attuned solely to the outbreak of war in 1939. One point emerging in recent work in international history is a recognition of the permeability of the formerly solid dividing line of 1945. In this regard the summary consideration given by Pedersen to post-1939 developments feels too hurried. She does discuss the formation of the United Nations and its Trusteeship Council, but in outline terms only. It feels somewhat churlish, as one cannot ask for all things, but it would have been intriguing to track at greater length some of the currents running from League to United Nations. The precedents, procedures, and indeed very people involved with the governance of mandates did not disappear with the end of the League itself. On the contrary, they explicitly informed what came next. Pedersen\u2019s approach throughout The Guardians seeks the greater importance and implications of what the mandates system did, and how it worked, rather than becoming tied down in close description of each specific incident. In concluding it is worth emphasising that it is not a forensic and encyclopaedic chronological narrative of the mandate experience in its entirety. To do so would demand, in effect, the integration of comprehensive local histories of each of the Mandates themselves across the interwar years\u2014probably too much to ask of any single study\u2014and would inevitably make for a turgid tome. Quite the opposite, The Guardians wears its immense learning lightly. This is a book to be read and not simply consulted: written with verve, sympathy, and, in places, humour, it is an engaging and genuinely accessible work of scholarship. Its arguments will deservedly frame all scholarly discussion of the mandates system, and much on the League of Nations as a whole, for some time to come.\n\nOne of the pleasures of writing The Guardians was the chance it afforded me to delve into fields not my own. The territories to which the League\u2019s oversight regime was applied were scattered across the Pacific, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East. I did my best to reconstruct the relationship between that regime and the different imperial and territorial administrations through archival research across the globe, but to understand what I was finding I had to rely on the work of historians in those different fields. As my debt to those historians grew, I couldn\u2019t help but hope that some would in turn find my work useful.\n\nI am therefore extremely grateful to Tom Maddux and H-Diplo for organizing this roundtable and to the colleagues who engaged with the book. Their comments help clarify not only its findings but also what my approach can \u2013 and, equally importantly, cannot \u2013 deliver. For what may be disorienting about the book for historians in different regional fields, and certainly what made it hard to write, is that its subject is not any particular state or territory, nor even the bilateral relationship between metropole and colony. The Guardians is, rather, a history of a multilateral, complex, and unstable international regime \u2013 the oversight regime applied to the transferred German colonies and Ottoman territories by the League of Nations. The book seeks less to show how that oversight regime affected colonial rule in this or that specific territory (since those effects were not uniform and certainly not uniformly or even usually progressive) than how it affected norms, practices, and relations of sovereignty \u2013 or what we might call the international order as a whole.\n\nV\u00e9ronique Dimier notes that the League\u2019s Permanent Mandates Commission (PMC) \u2013 the body of so-called experts appointed to scrutinize mandatory administration \u2013 lies at the center of my story. She is quite right. She was in fact the first to treat the Commission (as I do) less as an actor than as an arena \u2013 in her case showing how British and French colonial officials used the Commission, and the publicity that surrounded it, to defend their own colonial ideals and practices and denigrate those of the other.[27] Following a similar approach, I sought to elucidate how other interests as well \u2013 revisionist powers, humanitarian lobbies, nationalist movements \u2013 entered and sought to influence that international arena towards their own ends. To put it much too briefly, the book shows how a League regime set up to reform and sanitize the imperial order, instead, precisely because of the degree of contestation and publicity it introduced, destabilized it.\n\nAndrew Webster has so ably summarized the book\u2019s narrative and major claims that I do not feel the need to repeat them. It is worth explaining, however, how I chose the specific controversies I did. These choices were not random. As I wished to explore what difference internationalization by the League made for the imperial order, I necessarily concentrated on those conflicts (the Bondelswarts, Syrian, Samoan and Palestinian Arab revolts) or those questions (sovereignty, free trade, labour control, the definition and meaning of the term civilization, German colonial claims) that made the most noise internationally. (Put bluntly, my selection principle was: If a tree falls in a mandated territory and Geneva hears it, I hear it.) Early in my research, I thus read through the minutes of the PMC, noting the specific controversies that absorbed it and totting up the amount of time spent on each of the specific territories. The narrative follows roughly the arc of their attention, although once I had chosen my subjects, I explored them not only through the Commission\u2019s self-justifying prose but also through archival sources and voices from the mandatory powers and the territories themselves.\n\nWhat did that approach yield? It confirms, certainly (as Antony Anghie argued a decade ago[28]), that Geneva became a key site of imperial legitimation and contestation \u2013 while also showing how the porousness of that arena and the fluidity of the interests within it produced unintended results. We see how cannily the imperial powers used the regime to legitimate their rule, how assiduously nationalist groups adopted the new tools of petitioning and publicity to challenge them, and how the League\u2019s officials and experts sought to contain and negotiate those conflicts. That those officials considered imperial rule normal and legitimate is clear: in one case after another, the Commission espoused protection, not self-determination, justifying political repression and labour coercion on the grounds that populations under mandate were definitionally \u201cnot yet able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world.\u201d Yet, public exposure, geopolitical shifts, and the Commission\u2019s own changing composition could have unexpected effects too, with pressures from revisionist Germany and liberal humanitarians ultimately forcing the League Council to rule that the imperial powers were not sovereign in territories under mandate.\n\nThese arguments were often fought out in the mandated territories through protests, police actions, and prison terms; in Geneva, however, they were fought out with words. The mandates system was born of power but promulgated by text \u2013 by the Covenant and the detailed written agreements (mandates) hammered out between the League and each administering power. The existence of these documents meant that every claim or challenge had to be made textually: thus, Germany opposed administrative union in East Africa not by saying that it would prevent Tanganyika\u2019s return to Germany (although that was its real fear) but by claiming union a violation of the Covenant; Syrian and Palestinian patriots petitioned by pointing to Article 22\u2019s \u201cprovisional recognition\u201d of Middle East populations\u2019 national rights. The Commission, too, took refuge in textualism, insisting it was a purely technical body impartially interpreting international law. This was nonsense. As I show in case after case, Commission members had strong views and often partisan agendas about the mandates regime: the point is simply that they were obliged to argue their case with reference to the regime\u2019s ruling texts. I am sorry Trygve Throntveit understood me to be arguing that the Commission, because textual, was therefore not political: to the contrary, the two aspects went hand in hand. As I put it on page 65, \u201ctextualism became the language politics was forced to speak.\u201d However clear I thought I had been on this point, obviously I was not clear enough.\n\nThese insights are, I hope, enough to vindicate the system-centered approach I adopted. There are, however, things such an approach cannot do. It cannot, for one, do justice to each mandated territory\u2019s unique history or its peoples\u2019 two-decade engagement with the League. I can thus only echo Elizabeth Thompson\u2019s hope that the book might spur historians of the Middle East, Africa and the Pacific to investigate more systematically local populations\u2019 roles within, and responses to, the international system and processes I describe. Too little such work has been done. Most Middle East historians, for example, use the term \u201cmandate\u201d as a descriptor for a particular period (\u201cthe mandate period\u201d) rather than to indicate a particular internationalized form of rule[29] \u2013 and yet, as my book shows, local people and movements were often aware of the new triangulation of authority, appealing to Geneva against their imperial rulers, over and over and over. Political movements arose from those mobilizations \u2013 although, as Thompson suggests, when persistent appeals went unanswered, so too did the politics of despair. We see the symbiotic relationship between failed appeals and political violence in the Middle East in particular.\n\nNor can this approach adequately treat interwar internationalisms not oriented towards Geneva (whether communist, fascist, religious, or anticolonial) or track fully how local populations engaged those networks or constructed alternative internationalisms of their own. Humanitarian and revisionist lobbies figure more centrally in the book than the international Communist mobilization Meredith Terretta mentions because they were more influential or disruptive for the mandates regime specifically \u2013 however differently their influence might be weighed elsewhere or retrospectively.[30] Pan-Arab, pan-African, Zionist, Garveyite and other diasporic mobilizations are recovered because their various efforts to engage Geneva and variable successes show up the character (including the racial assumptions) of the regime, not because the book can do justice to those movements in their own right.[31] I am glad, then, that Terretta\u2019s new project on African petitions and legal appeals sent to the League and the United Nations, Ananda Burra\u2019s work on anticolonial mobilization and thought over the transition between the two bodies, and the burgeoning literature on anticolonial networks will provide a richer account of those alternative internationalisms.[32] I could not do that work: I had to adhere to my optic and method to make the project manageable at all \u2013 especially since it is a study of the mandates regime and not of anticolonial activism per se. But I am glad someone else will do it.\n\nTrygve Throntveit, by contrast, wishes I had paid more attention to the role of the United States, both when present and when absent. He argues that President Woodrow Wilson was responsible for the mandates regime\u2019s initial progressivism and thus that the United States\u2019 absence from the League can be held largely responsible for its limitations. Had the United States remained, he implies, the system could have promoted self-determination all round. I can understand the appeal of this research agenda for historians of U.S. foreign relations, since it nicely shifts agency and attention away from League bureaucrats, nationalist petitioners, and revisionist claimants and back to American internationalists and politicians, but I am content not to have gone in this direction. This is not only because the field of U.S. diplomatic history will surely continue to churn out work on Wilson without me; nor is it just because I wanted to investigate the system as it actually existed rather than as it might have been \u2013 especially since the counterfactual of U.S. presence in Geneva requires assuming not only that the U.S. joined the League but also that (in defiance of everything we know about the sclerotic and partisan nature of American politics) it remained there and actually upheld Wilsonian ideals. But the real reason I didn\u2019t make the argument Throntveit advances is simply that I did not find much evidence for it and do not find it persuasive. Since I did not spell out those views in the book, let me do so briefly here.\n\nCertainly it is the case that had the U.S. joined, remained within the League, and been willing to play a leading role in upholding its collective security provisions (all very large assumptions), the League would have been a more powerful institution. Anglo-American dominance would have been assured; capacity to force agreements would have increased; the cost of dissent or exit would have been much greater. But Throntveit\u2019s claim is not simply that the presence of the United States would have made the League more powerful and effective; it is that it would have made the League more progressive on imperial questions, turning the specific regime I discuss \u2013 the mandates regime \u2013 into an engine for national self-determination. I cannot find much evidence to support that claim. Yes, Wilson expressed disapproval of the European empires\u2019 territorial claims. Yet, when what we can only call American imperial interests were threatened at the Peace Conference, he rallied to their defense \u2013 insisting on deference to the Monroe Doctrine, for example, and declining to support the Japanese effort to include a racial equality clause. Moreover, on the national claims of non-European peoples in particular, Wilson was hardly a progressive voice. A few in his entourage were sympathetic to Arab nationalism, but it was British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, not Wilson, who stated (if for his own instrumental reasons) that Africans had the capacity and the right to be consulted about their rulers; by contrast Wilson\u2019s Colonial advisor George Louis Beer, who was slated to become the Director of the Mandates Section, thought Africans had no capacity for governing themselves and were definitely best kept under European \u2013 ideally British \u2013 rule. The two convinced Wilsonians who shaped the mandates regime from within the Secretariat (former Harvard instructor William Rappard and the American internationalist Huntington Gilchrist) likewise not only did little to advance the political claims of mandated populations but crafted the Commission\u2019s arguments against them, Gilchrist authoring its justifications of French and New Zealand repression of national movements in Syria and Samoa, and Rappard categorically opposing any further moves towards independence in the Middle East in the 1930s. As Robert Vitalis has most brilliantly shown, it\u2019s important not to gloss over the importance of race here.[33] Like so many white Europeans and Americans, Wilson, Beer, Rappard, and Gilchrist conscientiously believed in self-determination for civilized men but almost unthinkingly equated civilization and whiteness \u2013 and the mandates system, it is worth remembering, was applied mostly to populations who were not white. Just why Wilson would have led the charge for self-determination for these non-whites, when he could not face having African-American students on the Princeton campus or African-American employees in the Federal Post Office, eludes me.\n\nMy defense of this choice to investigate the mandates regime as it developed, rather than to speculate about how it might have looked had the Senate confirmed the Treaty and subsequent U.S. Presidents stayed on board, does not mean that I feel I captured well all the relations and interests that shaped it. In particular, I wish I could have properly investigated Turkey\u2019s role. To understand why I think this important, we need to note what no commentator save Webster really noticed, but what is (I think) the book\u2019s single most important finding \u2013 which is the extent to which politics around Germany and German revisionism drove the process of territorial \u201cinternationalization\u201d. The decision not to return Germany\u2019s colonies turned Germany, against its will, into the first postcolonial great power; German resentment against those losses forced the League (following Germany\u2019s entry) to articulate a defense of international sovereignty; Germany\u2019s exit in 1933 and its claim to colonial restitution helped destroy that international regime altogether. But Germany was only one ex-sovereign; the Ottoman Empire was the other. True, Turkey was a \u201cnew state\u201d and not just a successor state \u2013 and yet, Turkey did not abdicate all claims to those ex-Ottoman lands, working hard to persuade the League to award it Mosul in 1925 and successfully reclaiming Hatay (or Alexandretta) in 1938. I mentioned these efforts, but I did not have the linguistic ability to properly investigate Turkey\u2019s relations with the League \u2013 or, for that matter, to trace the way the European powers\u2019 long history with the Ottoman Empire shaped the mandates regime. We are fortunate, then, to have Aimee Genell\u2019s recent dissertation which shows (among other things) how the British based their ideas about the mandates system not only on Lugardian ideals but also on their policies towards Ottoman Egypt, and Andrew Arsan\u2019s study of Ottoman precedents for League petitions[34]; I\u2019m also pleased to see scholars tackling the timely subject of Turkey\u2019s continued engagement with those former Ottoman lands.\n\nI thank Tom Maddux and H-Diplo again for this round-table on my book, and look forward to further amplifications, amendments and refutations of its findings."}, {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/87ce2b2e-258f-11e5-bd83-71cb60e8f08c", "page_content": "What is included in my trial?\n\nDuring your trial you will have complete digital access to FT.com with everything in both of our Standard Digital and Premium Digital packages.\n\nStandard Digital includes access to a wealth of global news, analysis and expert opinion.

He had a poor shooting game, making only 4 of 12 shots from the field and 1 of 6 three-point attempts, an effort that was not uncommon among players for Team USA in a 83-76 upset loss to France.

Team USA\u2019s time was about a second slower than that clocked by the winner of the other heat, the team from New Zealand.

He swam a time of 1:00.13 and finished last out of the seven swimmers in his heat who completed the race and did not advance to the semifinals. Early this morning he swam in the prelims for the 200 meter breaststroke, and his time of 2:10.21 was seventh-fastest out of the eight swimmers in his heat. He did not advance to the semifinals in that event.\n\nTownley Haas (USA) - Haas, a returning Olympian who finished 5th in the men\u2019s 200 meter freestyle at the 2016 Olympics, was one of two Americans entered in that event at this year\u2019s games, but he did not improve on his finish from five years ago. He finished fourth in his prelim heat on Sunday and qualified for the semifinals, which were held later that day. In his semifinal heat, he had by far the slowest reaction time at the start and was in last place after the first 50 meters, and was only able to get into fifth place by the race\u2019s end. He did not have one of the top eight semifinal times overall and did not advance to last night\u2019s final.\n\nIt is unclear if his Olympic run is now over. He was previously listed as a member of Team USA\u2019s 4x200 meter freestyle relay team, but he was not part of the American foursome that swam in this morning\u2019s semifinals, a group that had the fifth-fastest qualifying time overall and will swim in the finals tonight at 10:26 p.m.\n\nDrew Kibler (USA) - Kibler swam Team USA\u2019s first leg of the 4x200 meter freestyle relay this morning, swimming a team-best 1:46.12 split and helping the squad to a time of 7:05.62. The final race in that event is scheduled for tonight (Tuesday) at 10:26 p.m. Central Time.\n\nWomen\u2019s Swimming\n\nAnna Elendt (Germany) - Elendt, the first Longhorn athlete to represent Germany at an Olympic games, had her prelim heat in the 100 meter breaststroke on Sunday morning and finished 2nd with a time of 1:06.96. She did not fare as well in her semifinal heat, finishing in 7th place with a time of 1:07.31, more than a second and a half behind her future Longhorn teammate Lydia Jacoby (more on her in a bit). Elendt did not advance to the 100m breaststroke final, but still has one event left in Tokyo. On Friday morning she will swim a leg of Germany\u2019s 4x100 medley relay in that event\u2019s initial heats, and with a top eight time her team will advance to Saturday\u2019s final heat.\n\nJoanna Evans (The Bahamas) - Evans, competing in her second Olympics, did not advance past the first heat either of her events this week. In Sunday\u2019s 400 meter freestyle prelims she finished 2nd in her heat with a time of 4:07.50 (exactly one-tenth of a second faster than her prelim time in the same event at the 2016 Olympics), but it wasn\u2019t a fast enough time to qualify for one of the two semifinal heats. The next day she swam in the prelims for the 200 meter freestyle and finished 7th in her heat with a time of 1:58.40, an improvement of nearly 3 seconds on her time at the 2016 Olympics, but not fast enough to get her into the semifinals.\n\nLydia Jacoby (USA) - I did not mention Jacoby in my Texas Longhorn-centric Olympics preview piece on Friday that named the 26 Longhorn athletes set to compete in Tokyo. I was unaware that she was a Longhorn swimming commit, and she was not included on the release from UT Athletics last week that named the Longhorn athletes slated to compete in Tokyo because she is an incoming high school senior and has not yet signed a letter of intent with Texas. The 17-year-old Alaska native swam in the 100 meter breaststroke prelims on Sunday and advanced to the semifinals with a time of 1:05.52. She won her semifinal heat with a slightly slower time of 1:05.72 to advance to Monday\u2019s final.\n\nIn her first Olympic final she got off to a promising start, and after 50 meters she was in 3rd place behind fellow American and reigning Olympic gold medalist and world record holder Lilly King, and South African Tatjana Schoenmaker, who had set a new Olympic record in her prelim heat. After the turn, Jacoby caught up to and passed both King and Shoenmaker to win the gold medal with a time of 1:04.95, besting Schoenmaker\u2019s 1:05.22 silver medal finish.\n\nJacoby is not listed as a participant in any other events, but she seems a likely candidate to be included on Team USA\u2019s 4x100 medley relay, which will have its opening heat on Friday night.\n\nRemedy Rule (The Philippines) - Rule, the only swimmer representing The Philippines, and the first Longhorn to compete for that country in the Olympics, swam in the prelims for the 100 meter butterfly on Saturday, and though she finished 2nd in her heat she did not advance to the semifinals. Swimming in the 200 meter butterfly prelims early this morning, she finished 6th in her heat with a time of 2:12.23, but since only 16 swimmers actually finished the race between the three prelim heats, she was able to earn a spot in the semifinal heats.\n\nRule will swim in one of that event\u2019s semifinals tonight at around 9:04 Central Time. If her time is one of the eight best, she\u2019ll compete in the 200 meter butterfly final on Wednesday night. If she doesn\u2019t advance to the final, then tonight\u2019s race will likely be the final one as a competitive swimmer for the former Longhorn All-American, as she has stated that she plans to retire from swimming after the Olympics.\n\nErica Sullivan (USA) - Sullivan, who will turn 21 on August 9, the day after the closing ceremony of the Tokyo Olympics, finished 2nd in her qualifying heat of the 1,500 meter freestyle on Monday. Her time of 15:46.67 was the third-best qualifying time among the eight swimmers who advanced to the final, which is scheduled to begin tonight at 9:54 p.m. Central Time. Also in the final heat will be Katie Ledecky, who won four gold medals at the 2016 Olympics but has not previously swum the 1,500 meter freestyle in Olympic competition. [Author\u2019s note: until watching the NBA Olympic broadcast on Tuesday night I did not know that neither Ledecky nor any other female swimmer has swum the 1,500m in the Olympics before. This is the first time it has been included in the women\u2019s Olympic swimming competition, though it has been swum by the male Olympians since the 1904 summer games. Previously, no women\u2019s Olympic race had exceeded 800 meters.] Ledecky set an Olympic record with a time of 15:35.35 in her qualifying heat, and she also holds the world record in that event (15:20.48).\n\nWomen\u2019s Volleyball\n\nChiaka Ogbogu (USA) - Ogbogu was one of two players on Team USA\u2019s roster who did not play in its 3-0 win over Argentina in pool play on Saturday. She also got a DNP in yesterday\u2019s upset win by Team USA over China, which it won in straight sets 29-27, 25-22, 25-21. The Americans will next play Turkey on Thursday in a game set to begin at 7:45 a.m. Central Time."}, {"url": "https://swimswam.com/texas-longhorns-take-second-consecutive-win-in-the-d1-directors-cup/", "page_content": "Texas took home its second-straight Directors\u2019 Cup title in the final 2021-22 standings released by the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA) on June 30. This honor has been awarded annually to Division I, II, III, and National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) institutions based on their sports teams\u2019 finishes in the NCAA or NAIA Championships for nearly 30 years.\n\nThe NACDA scores the Division I, II, III, and NAIA schools differently. For Division I, the NACDA evaluates the finishes of a college\u2019s top 19 sports teams. four of these teams must be baseball, men\u2019s basketball, women\u2019s basketball and women\u2019s volleyball. After these mandatory teams\u2019 scores have been calculated, the NACDA will assess the next 15 highest-performing sports teams. The only difference in Division II is that a total of 15 teams are scored. Division III schools put forward their top 18 sports teams, of which the four teams must be men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball, and men\u2019s and women\u2019s soccer. Finally, NAIA schools have 13 of their top teams scored, with both basketball teams, men\u2019s soccer, and women\u2019s volleyball required in the institution\u2019s total points.\n\nLast year\u2019s Division I final standings saw a new champion for the first time in 27 years. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s impact, some conferences like the Pac-12 took strict measures to ensure the athletes\u2019 health and safety, which wound up breaking Stanford\u2019s 25-year streak. However, the Big 12 went full throttle with its sports seasons, and Texas rose to the top after placing 4th in the 2018-19 standings.\n\nEven with a more normal 2021-22 season, Texas continued to prove how dominant its athletics program is with a second consecutive win. The Longhorns claimed four NCAA team titles in men\u2019s indoor track and field, men\u2019s golf, and women\u2019s tennis and rowing. Texas also set a single-season school record with six NCAA runner-up team finishes, two of which were claimed by the men\u2019s and women\u2019s swimming and diving programs.\n\nGrand Valley State University earned its 14th Directors\u2019 Cup title, setting the Division II record. GVSU captured team titles in women\u2019s soccer, men\u2019s cross country, and men\u2019s indoor track and field. The men\u2019s swimming and diving program finished 10th at the Division II NCAA Championships.\n\nTufts received its first-ever Directors\u2019 Cup for Division III colleges. The university\u2019s victory ended Williams College\u2019s winning streak of seven Directors\u2019 Cup titles. Tufts had three spring-season teams finish in the top 5 at NCAAs. Women\u2019s lacrosse took second and men\u2019s lacrosse and tennis made the Final Four. The women\u2019s swimming and diving team had a historic season ending with the program\u2019s first NESCAC title and its first two NCAA individual titles. Claire Brennan won the program\u2019s first individual title in the 200-yard free with a time of 1:48.46. Brennan then went on to earn the program\u2019s second-ever title in the 800 free relay alongside Katelin Isakoff, Abby Claus, and Mary Hufziger. As a result of the team\u2019s efforts, the Tufts women finished 7th at the Division III NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships.\n\nLike Tufts, Indiana Wesleyan University claimed its first Directors\u2019 Cup in school history. The women\u2019s swimming and diving team finished 7th at the NAIA National Championships.\n\nJunior/community colleges follow separate criteria to be declared the winner of the Directors\u2019 Cup in their own category. The National Alliance of Two Year College Athletic Administrators (NATYCAA) annually awards the NATYCAA Cup, which also crowns the institution with the most success in its athletics. NACDA deems this honor to be the junior colleges\u2019 equivalent to the Directors\u2019 Cup.\n\nTop 10 Schools from Each Division\n\nDivision I Division II Division III NAIA 1. Texas 1.

The back-and-forth affair saw multiple lead changes and came down to the final race of the day, the 400-yard freestyle relay. With the Longhorns leading 144-139, the Aggies had to take first and third in the final relay to be victorious in the overall team race, and the foursome of Sammie Bosma, Meredith Oliver, Kelli Benjamin and Lili Ibanez got home in 3:20.57 to beat the Longhorn four by over a second. The foursome of Emily Neubert, Melanie McClure, Katherine Huff and Paige Miller secured the deciding points with a third-place finish in 3:26.87.\n\nAGGIES IN THE NCAA TOP 25: The Aggies feature six swimmers that have posted 11 times ranking among the top 25 fastest in the NCAA so far this season.\n\n50 freestyle: Sammie Bosma (No. 8, 22.72), Beryl Gastaldello (No. 14, 22.84)\n\n100 freestyle: none\n\n200 freestyle: none\n\n500 freestyle: none\n\n1,000 freestyle: Sarah Henry (No. 21, 9:55.96)\n\n1,650 freestyle: Colleen Konetzke (No. 10, 16:52.81)\n\n100 backstroke: Beryl Gastaldello (tNo. 25, 54.71)\n\n200 backstroke: Lisa Bratton (No. 19, 1:57.92)\n\n100 breaststroke: Sycerika McMahon (No. 16, 1:01.79)\n\n200 breaststroke: Sycerika McMahon (No. 18, 2:14.39)\n\n100 butterfly: none\n\n200 butterfly: none\n\n200 IM: Sarah Henry (No. 7, 2:00.61), Sycerika McMahon (No. 24, 2:02.83)\n\n400 IM: Sarah Henry (No. 4, 4:13.11)\n\nTOP 10 AGAIN: The College Swim Coaches Association of America announced its second Div.

SwimSwam will be previewing the top 12 men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams (and then some) from the 2022 NCAA Championships. Follow along with the College Swimming Preview Channel. Want to read even more? Check out the latest edition of the SwimSwam magazine.\n\n#2 Texas Longhorns\n\nKey Losses: Evie Pfeifer (29 NCAA points, 1 relay), Julia Cook (3 NCAA points, 1 relay)\n\nKey Additions: #3 Lydia Jacoby (breast), graduate transfer Dakota Luther (fly)\n\nGRADING CRITERIA\n\nTwo years ago, we unveiled a new, more data-based grading criteria based on \u2018projected returning points\u2019, a stat of our own making that involved a lot of manual calculations involving departing seniors, redshirts, freshmen, etc. We liked the objectiveness of that stat, but given that there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty for this year, we\u2019re adopting a hybrid approach this year. The \u201cstars\u201d will rely heavily on what swimmers actually did last year, but we\u2019ll also give credit to returning swimmers or freshmen who have times that would have scored last year.\n\nSince we only profile the top 12 teams in this format, our grades are designed with that range in mind. In the grand scheme of college swimming and compared to all other college programs, top 12 NCAA programs would pretty much all grade well across the board. But in the interest of making these previews informative, our grading scale is tough \u2013 designed to show the tiers between the good stroke groups, the great ones, and the 2015 Texas fly group types.\n\n5 star (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605) \u2013 a rare, elite NCAA group projected to score 25+ points per event\n\n4 star (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605) \u2013 a very, very good NCAA group projected to score 15-24 points per event\n\n3 star (\u2605\u2605\u2605) \u2013 a good NCAA group projected to score 5-14 points per event\n\n2 star (\u2605\u2605) \u2013 a solid NCAA group projected to score 1-4 points per event\n\n1 star (\u2605) \u2013 an NCAA group that is projected to score no points per event, though that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s without potential scorers \u2013 they\u2019ll just need to leapfrog some swimmers ahead of them to do it\n\nWe\u2019ll grade each event discipline: sprint free (which we define to include all the relay-distance freestyle events, so 50, 100 and 200), distance free, IM, breaststroke, backstroke, butterfly and diving. Use these grades as a jumping-off point for discussion, rather than a reason to be angry.\n\n2021-2022 LOOKBACK\n\nThe Texas women held the fourth spot in the SwimSwam power rankings for the majority of last season. Then, in our final rankings, we had them at third, trailing only Virginia and Stanford. Much of the conversation heading into the 2022 NCAAs centered around whether there was anything Stanford could do to beat Virginia. In hindsight, the conversation should have been about the battle between Stanford and Texas for second.\n\nStanford didn\u2019t swim badly, but both Texas\u2019 swimmers and divers performed exceptionally. They raked in points from Kelly Pash\u2018s three \u2018A\u2019 finals, Anna Elendt\u2018s strong finishes in breaststroke, and the distance duo of Erica Sullivan and Evie Pfeifer. However, it was their butterfly and diving that powered them past Stanford in the final individual events of the meet\u2014200 fly and platform. Then, they did enough in the 400 free relay to hold off Stanford, securing their place as the national runner-up.\n\nAfter an exceptional meet like that, can the Longhorn women hold onto their momentum and defend their spot as the country\u2019s #2?\n\nSprint Freestyle: \u2605\u2605\n\nWhile the Texas women have many areas where they shine, sprint freestyle is not one of them. They had just one woman compete in either the 50 or 100 freestyle at NCAAs\u2014Emma Sticklen, who finished 33rd in the 50 freestyle in 22.26. While that was just off her lifetime best, it took 21.99 to make it back for finals last year. With no recruits coming in who will immediately contribute NCAA points in the 50 or 100 free, it looks like this area will still be a gap for Texas in the 2022-23 season.\n\nAt the dual meet and conference level, however, they have more depth. With a 22.07, it was then-sophomore Grace Cooper who had Texas\u2019 fastest time in the 50 freestyle last season. Cooper is the two-time Big-12 champion in the event, and will make a run at the hat trick this season. She\u2019s not as strong in the 100 freestyle\u2014her best time is 49.00\u2014but she still finished fifth at Big 12s. That 49.00 came from the Minnesota Invitational, and she added more than half a second en route to her Big-12 title. To make even more of an impact in the postseason, she\u2019ll need to aim to be at her best come February.\n\nTexas kept Sienna Schellenger in-state, and she holds lifetime bests of 22.76 in the 50 and 49.73 in the 100. While neither of those will make an immediate impact, she could be a key relay piece for the Longhorns.\n\nSeniors Bridget Semenuk and Kyla Leibel are classic 50/100/200 freestylers and\u2014especially Leibel\u2014the further they go the better they get. Both played crucial roles on the Texas relays all season, and are important depth pieces as the Longhorns look to hold on to their second place in the team competition. None of Semenuk, Leibel or Cooper swam an individual event at NCAAs last season. Relays are a weak spot for Texas, so continued improvement will be paramount for this trio will be paramount this season, especially as Texas has a few key legs to replace.\n\nTheir best 200 freestyler is Kelly Pash, who finished third at NCAAs with a lifetime best 1:42.38. Pash had a strong long course season and should bring that momentum into her senior campaign. 200 free national champion Taylor Ruck does return and showed herself to be back on form last season, when she won in 1:41.12. Given that, it might take a big lifetime best for Pash to win an individual national title, but that isn\u2019t impossible.\n\nDistance Freestyle: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nTokyo Olympian Erica Sullivan headlines the Longhorns\u2019 2022-2023 distance group. As a freshman last year, Sullivan finished third in the 500 (4:35.92) and second in the 1650 (15:45.94) at NCAAs, amassing 33 individual points. Her personal bests in both events were set prior to her freshman year, so we know that her ceiling is higher. That\u2019s especially true in the mile, where her time was over 22 seconds off her 15:23.81 lifetime best. Sullivan had a shoulder injury in the offseason, which caused her to miss U.S. World Trials in April. Since then, she swam one event at U.S. Nationals, where she placed fourth in both the 800 and 1500 meter freestyles.\n\nEvie Pfeifer scored 27 points across the same events last year and has since graduated, which is a big loss for the Longhorns. It leaves Sullivan as the sole scorer for Texas in the distance events, with questions still lingering about what kind of form she\u2019s bringing into the season and her recovery. Sullivan is certainly capable of holding her place in the event standings\u2014and if she\u2019s on form winning both or either\u2014but as it stands, the Longhorns will lose points from 2022 to 2023 NCAAs in these events. What they really need is another distance swimmer having a big season and jumping up into NCAA scoring.\n\nEven with the loss of Pfeifer, Sullivan alone makes this a four-star distance group.\n\nBackstroke: \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIt\u2019s junior backstroker/butterflier Olivia Bray who leads the Longhorns\u2019 backstroke group this season.\n\nLast year at NCAAs, she took on the 100 fly/100 back double, and in the 100 back, finished eighth in 51.02 after posting a personal best of 50.69 in prelims. She opted for the 200 fly last year at NCAAs, so those 11 points were the only ones Texas scored in the 100 back. She did race the 200 back at Big 12s, where she went a personal best of 1:51.09, which would have earned her seventh at NCAAs. After posting multiple lifetime bests last season, Bray comes into this season with a strong foundation to build off as she continues to improve.\n\nGiven Texas\u2019 depth in the 200 fly, which is also getting a significant improvement this season (more on that below), it\u2019s possible we see Bray take on the 200 back over the 200 fly in 2023.\n\nThe backstroke group has lost Julia Cook, who was an important depth piece for the Longhorns. They\u2019re bringing in two freshmen, Meghan DiMartile and Emily Carpenter, who are both 1:58-high in the 200. Neither project to make an immediate impact this season, but could develop into important pieces.\n\nBreaststroke: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nLast season, German Olympian Anna Elendt had a major breakthrough in yards. She first made headlines by breaking Texas\u2019 100-yard breaststroke school record in December 2021. At the Big 12 Championships, she split a blistering 56.42 on the 400 medley relay. Then, at NCAAs, she roared to 56.88 in prelims of the 100 breast, joining an exclusive group of women under 57 seconds as the fifth-fastest all-time. She added time in the final, ultimately finishing fifth in a razor-thin race, though her morning time would have won the event. She followed that up by clocking 2:04.31 in the 200 breast, finishing second behind Kate Douglass\u2018 American record performance.\n\nElendt made great strides in her sophomore season, and now as a junior will be counted on for her consistency as one of the best breaststrokers in the NCAA. Her 56.88 100-yard time makes her a serious contender for the national title, especially with Alexis Wenger (UVA) and Sophie Hansson (NC State) graduating. In the 200 breast, it\u2019s hard to see her beating Douglass, but she should remain near the top of the podium. It\u2019s realistic to expect Elendt to equal or surpass the 31 NCAA points she contributed last season.\n\nThe Longhorns are also getting an incredible addition to their breaststroke group in Lydia Jacoby. The Tokyo gold medalist in the 100-meter breaststroke, Jacoby also has the fastest time in her class in yards with a 58.87. Jacoby went from unranked as a sophomore, to eighth as a junior, to #3 on our re-rank of the girls\u2019 high school class of 2022. Even though her yards times aren\u2019t yet at the same level as her long course pedigree, she\u2019s made big improvements and should continue to do so at Texas. She and Elendt will be a lethal duo to contend with. We\u2019ll get more in-depth on relays later, but right now it looks like Elendt retains her spot on the medleys, though Jacoby could very well challenge her.\n\nButterfly: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe days of the Texas butterfly group have come again, and this time it\u2019s the women\u2019s team that has perhaps the best fly corps in the country. At the 2022 NCAAs, they scored the most points of any team in both individual butterfly events, racking up 27 points in the 100 and 37 in the 200.\n\nIt was their three 200 fly \u2018A\u2019 finalists (Pash, Bray, and Sticklen) who launched them into a position to pass Stanford for second place in the team standings in the final events of the meet. The three finished fifth, seventh, and eighth in that final, respectively, with Pash the fastest of the three in 1:52.01. Sticklen popped 1:51.45 in prelims, which would have put her third if she\u2019d repeated that time in finals. Though they will be pushed by the likes of Charlotte Hook, Lillie Nordmann, and Lindsay Looney, it\u2019s still realistic to expect them all to return to the \u2018A\u2019 final, especially with Olivia Carter and Regan Smith\u2018s departures from the NCAA.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t enough that Pash, Bray, and Sticklen all return, the Longhorns are also adding Dakota Luther as a graduate transfer to their already formidable group. With Luther now at Texas, it\u2019s a real possibility that we could see a 200 fly \u2018A\u2019 final at 2023 NCAAs with half of the swimmers sporting Longhorn caps. Factoring in Luther\u2019s fourth-place finish in the 200 fly (just ahead of Pash), that would have brought their total points in the event to a whopping 52 last season. She also adds depth in the 100 fly, where she finished 11th at NCAAs in 51.01.\n\nSimply put, this is a group that will bring in a major haul of points for Texas. With the 200 butterfly being the final individual swimming event of NCAAs, the value of Texas\u2019 fly group is incredibly high. While Virginia will likely have clinched their third title in a row by that point, this group of athletes makes it so that any team wishing to finish second will have to accumulate a huge lead on the Longhorns to beat their fly group (and their divers) in the waning events of the meet.\n\nIM: \u2605\u2605\n\nFor Texas, the IMs are similar to sprint freestyle in that Pash is their only NCAA scorer. She finished fifth in the 200 IM at NCAAs, hitting a lifetime best of 1:53.31. Pash was the only Longhorn entered in the event, and as seven of the \u2018A\u2019 finalists (potentially eght, depending on how Izzy Ivey\u2019s eligibility works out) return, it projects as a quite crowded event. It\u2019s also Luther\u2019s third event, and she finished 24th last year in 1:56.67. It took 1:55.90 to final last year, which would be a significant, but not impossible drop for Luther.\n\nIn the 400 IM, the Longhorns had no NCAA scorers. Pash had the fastest time of the season with a 4:07.65 to win Big 12s, but don\u2019t expect her to race it at NCAAs. With Pfeifer, who did swim the event at NCAAs (19th, 4:08.76), graduated, the next fastest woman on the roster is sophomore Olivia McMurray, who holds a lifetime best of 4:13.67 and is primarily a distance freestyler.\n\nNone of their recruits are medley specialists either, and with IM being the third event for those on the roster who do swim it, it looks like it will remain a discipline where Texas won\u2019t pick up many NCAA points.\n\nDiving: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 \u2605\n\nBy the parameters we set in our grading criteria, Texas diving earns four stars because they \u201conly\u201d scored 17 points on the 1-meter board at NCAAs. However, compared to the other teams vying for top spots in the division, they are worthy of five stars. Those 17 points were the only points that a top ten team scored on the 1-meter.\n\nAnd they got better on the higher boards. Hailey Hernandez and Paola Pineda scored on 1-meter by finishing fourth and 15th, respectively. They both \u2018A\u2019 finaled on 3-meter, with Pineda finishing sixth and Hernandez eighth. They were joined in the final by Jordan Skilken, who earned 10th, bringing their total points in the event to 31. Then, in platform diving on the last day of the meet, Skilken and Pineda took third and eighth, with junior Janie Boyle earning fourth. Together, they accumulated 42 points and pushed Texas ahead of Stanford for second in the team race.\n\nAll four of these high-powered divers return to Texas for the 2022-2023 season, giving Texas a huge edge in the race for second, as none of the other top five teams are within range of equaling Texas\u2019 diving points. In addition, they also add Canada\u2019s Sarah Carruthers, who joins the team as a freshman this year.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate the value that this group brings to the Longhorns, especially given that they all have the capacity to improve on their finishes from last season. We mentioned this in the butterfly section, but the 200 fly and platform finals being the final two individual events of the meet is a lethal back-to-back for Texas\u2014one that keeps them dangerous through the whole competition, and covers most of the gaps they have.\n\nRelays: \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nOne of those gaps is their relays. Compared to the other top teams, this is a major weakness for the Longhorns, though it\u2019s not a surprising one. Given their lack of depth in sprint freestyle, it\u2019s not shocking that only three of their relays made the top eight last year. The only free relay to crack that barrier was the 800, which finished fourth in 6:56.21. They lose their 1:44.29 anchor, Pfeifer, but return the other three legs: Pash, Bray, and Leibel.\n\nThe other two \u201c\u2018A\u2019 final\u201d relays were the medleys with the 200 finishing fifth and the 400 fourth. While the entire 400 medley relay (Bray, Elendt, Sticklen, and Pash) returns this year, they will need to replace Julia Cook as the sprint backstroker on the 200 medley. Last year, that was the relay they opted to not use the versatile Pash on: Bray split 22.56 on fly and Sticklen anchored in 21.69. That was just .04 off what Pash split on the 200 free relay, so that decision made sense in 2022.\n\nBut will it still make sense in 2023? There are a variety of options for the Longhorns: if the plan is to keep Pash off the relay, they could move Bray to backstroke, then put Sticklen on fly and replace her free leg with Cooper, Semenuk, or Schellenger, depending on how they develop this year. If they want to put Pash on the relay, and \u201cpunt\u201d on the 200 free relay, then that\u2019s an easy switch too and Schellenger (or potentially Leibel) would likely draw on to that relay instead.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering how Luther factors into relay decisions, last year she split a 23.37 50 fly and 51.28 100 fly, both slower than Texas\u2019 butterfly legs on the medley relays. Hr 50 fly split is over half a second slower than Bray\u2019s, therefore, her presence on the Texas roster likely won\u2019t sway any relay decisions at this point.\n\nTotal Stars: 28/40\n\n2022-2023 Outlook:\n\nThe Texas Longhorns are getting two massive additions in Olympic champion Jacoby and 200-meter fly national champion Luther. Paired with a core of returning star swimmers and divers, that sets Texas up for another strong season. While they don\u2019t have enough depth to overcome the Virginia Cavaliers, they should be able to hold onto the runner-up team trophy.\n\nThey\u2019ll have a good battle for that position with Stanford though, and ultimately, who you think earns second comes down to which duo you believe will have more of an impact: Jacoby/Luther or Curzan/Hook. Here at SwimSwam, we\u2019re going with Jacoby, Luther, and the Longhorns to retain their spot.\n\nWOMEN\u2019S PREVIEW INDEX"}, {"url": "https://swimswam.com/piper-enge-best-breaststroker-in-class-of-2024-commits-to-texas-longhorns/", "page_content": "Fitter and Faster Swim Camps is the proud sponsor of SwimSwam\u2019s College Recruiting Channel and all commitment news.

Enge trains with the Bellevue Club Swim Team in Washington and is the #8-ranked swimming recruit among current high school juniors.\n\nEnge was the 2022 Junior Pan Pac Champion in the 100 meter breaststroke (1:08.58), and also earned a bronze medal in the 200 breaststroke (2:27.93).\n\nShe won a trio of USA Swimming Futures Championships earlier in the summer, and was the runner-up at the 2021 Speedo Winter Junior Championship \u2013 West meet.\n\nHer long course summer best of 1:08.12 from the Pro Swim Series meet in Westmont early in the year, where she dropped three seconds from her lifetime best. That ranked her 8th among Americans across the season in long course.\n\nShe became one of the fastest 15-year olds ever in the event.\n\nEnge exploded coming out of the pandemic. As of February 2020, her best time in the 100 yard breaststroke was 1:07.75. In her first swim back, March 2021, she swam 1:03.29, and by the end of that year she had broken a minute.\n\nBest Times in Short Course Yards:\n\n100 free \u2013 51.04\n\n200 free \u2013 1:49.85\n\n100 breast \u2013 59.83\n\n200 breast \u2013 2:09.09\n\n200 IM \u2013 1:58.44\n\n400 IM \u2013 4:18.95\n\nSwimSwam recruiting analyst Jared Anderson says that Enge is the \u201cclear-cut\u201d top breaststroker in the class. She\u2019s the only one who has been under a minute in the 100 yard breaststroke (59.83), and is two seconds better than any other 200 breaststroker in the class (2:09.09).\n\nWhen Enge joins the Texas women in the fall of 2024, the defending Olympic champion Lydia Jacoby projects to be a junior for the same team. Jacoby, who has been a better long course breaststroker than short course breaststroker to this point of her career, has not yet raced for the Longhorns this fall in her freshman season of collegiate swimming.\n\nTexas junior Anna Elendt, among the favorites to win NCAA titles in both breaststroke events this season, will have either exhausted her eligibility, or will be using her 5th year of eligibility, when Enge arrives in Austin.\n\nEnge is the Texas women\u2019s second verbal commitment in the class of 2024, joining Campbel Chase from Dallas. Like Enge, Campbell is a strong breaststroker (1:02.0) and IMer (1:57.6/4:12.0), though she is a bit better of a sprint freestyler (50.1 personal best in the 100 yard race).\n\nThe Texas women placed 2nd at the 2022 NCAA Swimming & Diving Championships behind only Virginia\u2019s second consecutive title.\n\nIf you have a commitment to report, please send an email with a photo (landscape, or horizontal, looks best) and a quote to [email protected] .\n\nAbout the Fitter and Faster Swim Tour\n\nFitter & Faster Swim Camps feature the most innovative teaching platforms for competitive swimmers of all levels.

Later, Betsy attended Mercersburg Academy, in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania, where she continued competitive swimming during her high school years. She graduated from Mercersburg in 1983 and remains passionately involved with the Academy having served as a longtime member of its Board of Regents.\n\nFollowing high school, Betsy attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where she competed for the North Carolina Tar Heels swimming and diving teams during her first year there, for the 1983\u201384 NCAA season.\n\nAt the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, Betsy won a silver medal for her second-place performance in the women\u2019s 100-meter backstroke, finishing with a time of 1:02.63. She also earned a gold medal by swimming the backstroke leg for the winning U.S. team in the preliminary heats of the women\u2019s 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay.\n\nAfter the 1984 Olympics, Mitchell transferred to the University of Texas at Austin and swam for the Texas Longhorns swimming and diving team from 1985 to 1988. She won nine NCAA titles and was a member of the Longhorns NCAA national championship teams in 1986, 1987 and 1988.\n\nShe received the Honda Sports Award for Swimming and Diving, recognizing her as the outstanding college female swimmer of the year in 1987\u201388.

Alston. On June 21, the court ruled on the legality of the National Collegiate Athletic Association\u2019s restrictions on student-athlete compensation and benefits. Current and former student-athletes who played in men\u2019s Division I Football Bowl Subdivision football and men\u2019s and women\u2019s Division I basketball (collectively, \u201cstudent-athletes\u201d) filed an antitrust class action against the NCAA and eleven Division I conferences (collectively, \u201cNCAA\u201d), alleging that the NCAA implemented anticompetitive bylaws unreasonably limiting the compensation and benefits that student-athletes might receive in exchange for their athletic participation. The court unanimously found the NCAA\u2019s compensation rules violated the Sherman Act when they restricted non-cash education-related benefits such as post-eligibility undergraduate or graduate scholarships or tutoring, study-abroad expenses, and paid post-eligibility internships.\n\nThe court upheld the district court\u2019s finding based on the rule of reason analysis that the NCAA and its member schools collectively enjoyed monopsony power in the relevant market as defined as the market for student-athlete services in Division I basketball and FBS football and exercised such power to restrain compensation without risking their market dominance. The district court found that there were no viable substitutes for the Division I market that student-athletes could switch to in response to decreases in compensation.\n\nThe NCAA\u2019s compensation framework had significant anticompetitive effects in the relevant market by restricting competition between or among the member institutions for offering better compensation in recruiting student-athletes. Reduced compensation caused depressed athletics participation so that the price and quantity of student-athlete labor were suppressed below competitive levels. The court rejected the NCAA\u2019s defense arguing that special consideration should be afforded to the association as a joint venture that inevitably necessitates collaboration among members to \u201coffer consumers the benefit of intercollegiate athletic competition.\u201d The court admitted that \u201csome degree of coordination between competitors within sports leagues can be procompetitive.\u201d But it found that joint venture restrictions, especially with monopoly power, were appropriately subject to antitrust scrutiny under \u201cthe ordinary rule of reason\u2019s fact-specific assessment of their effect on competition.\u201d\n\nWith special emphasis, the court made it clear that the rule of reason analysis was structured with flexibility depending on the circumstances. The court highlighted that the rule of reason review purported to \u201cfurnish an enquiry meet for the case, looking to the circumstances, details, and logic of a restraint\u201d to determine that the challenged practices harmed competition. The burden-shifting framework of the rule of reason poses the complex question as to whether the procompetitive benefits outweigh the anticompetitive harms. The court affirmed the district court\u2019s finding that the procompetitive benefits the NCAA had established with compensation restraints in the labor market could have been achieved by \u201csubstantially less restrictive alternative means.\u201d\n\nIt is noteworthy that the court had due regard to the preservation of amateurism as contended by the NCAA to show its compensation limits are procompetitive. Relying on long-standing controversial language in NCAA v. Board of Regents of University of Oklahoma (1984), the NCAA contended that the challenged rules helped preserve amateurism that drives consumer demand for college sports. The court in Board of Regents noted that the NCAA plays a critical role in maintaining \u201ca revered tradition of amateurism in college sports;\u201d that it has \u201cample latitude to play that role;\u201d and that the preservation of amateurism is \u201centirely consistent with the goals of the Sherman Act.\u201d The court in Alston maintained due balance in interpreting this language. The court construed its earlier wording as neither binding nor dispositive and thereby refused to grant wide antitrust immunity. The court further understood this language as suggesting that \u201ccourts should take care when assessing the NCAA\u2019s restraints on student-athlete compensation, sensitive to their procompetitive possibilities,\u201d but does not imply that \u201ccourts must reflexively reject all challenges to the NCAA\u2019s compensation restrictions.\u201d As such, the court struck the sensitive balance in considering the admissibility of amateurism as a viable defense by allowing the NCAA having the shifted burden of proof to argue that the preservation of amateurism has procompetitive effects.\n\nAlston has particular significance in that it provided legal clarification as to when the reshaped relationship between institutions and student-athletes ensures legitimacy in the college-sport labor market from an antirust perspective. Alston unprecedently lifted the limits on education-related compensation/in-kind benefits for student athletes and further attenuated the NCAA\u2019s control over student-athlete compensation. The significance of Alston is, nevertheless, not confined to its contribution to the accumulation of antitrust jurisprudence. Alston paved the way for re-establishment of the delicate relationship between universities or colleges and student-athletes from business transactional perspectives. It revealed the evolving landscape of college athletics in terms of fair compensation and treatment. Alston recognized that the NCAA relied heavily on amateurism to unduly exploit student-athlete labor for free or for a lower price in college sports. Invoking amateurism to the extreme creates controversy by oversimplifying and solidifying the relationship between institutions and student-athletes rather than aligning their business interests on an equal footing as in the competitive market. The court implied that amateurism acted to eliminate market dynamics and reduce competition in the student-athlete labor market.\n\nAlston, however, did not answer the question of whether and where the preservation of amateurism might be a successful procompetitive rationale on the merits. The court left room for more flexible interpretation by stating that courts dealing with complex business arrangements should be amenable to \u201cclarifying and reconsidering their decrees in light of changing market realities\u201d because markets tend to be \u201cmore effective than the heavy hand of judicial power when it comes to enhancing consumer welfare.\u201d The court also left room for future discourse on how to define amateurism as it stated that \u201cthe national debate about amateurism in college sports is important.\u201d The elimination of conceptual uncertainty and ambiguity will be necessary to better inform the antitrust analysis of practices in college sports demanding free labor in the name of amateurism.\n\n\u2014Kwanghyuk David Yoo\n\nlaw librarian, adjunct professor of law"}, {"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/21/supreme-court-rules-for-college-athletes-in-compensation-dispute-with-ncaa.html", "page_content": "The Supreme Court handed a unanimous victory Monday to Division I college athletes in their fight against the National Collegiate Athletic Association over caps it sought to impose on compensation related to education.\n\nThe court voted 9-0 to affirm lower court rulings that found that antitrust law prevented the NCAA from restricting payments to athletes for items such as musical instruments or as compensation for internships. The justices rejected the NCAA's argument that its players' amateur status would be impossible to maintain if they could receive pay, even for education-related expenses.\n\n\"Put simply, this suit involves admitted horizontal price fixing in a market where the defendants exercise monopoly control,\" Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the court.\n\nThe conservative justice, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, wrote that it was \"unclear exactly what the NCAA seeks.\"\n\n\"To the extent it means to propose a sort of judicially ordained immunity from the terms of the Sherman Act for its restraints of trade \u2014 that we should overlook its restrictions because they happen to fall at the intersection of higher education, sports, and money \u2014 we cannot agree,\" Gorsuch wrote.\n\nThe outcome was largely expected following oral argument in March. The decision upheld an injunction imposed by a federal district court that barred the NCAA from limiting \"compensation and benefits related to education.\" The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals earlier approved of the injunction.\n\nIn allowing the injunction, Gorsuch wrote that the NCAA can ask lawmakers to carve out an exception for it.\n\n\"The NCAA is free to argue that, 'because of the special characteristics of [its] particular industry,' it should be exempt from the usual operation of the antitrust laws \u2014 but that appeal is 'properly addressed to Congress,'\" Gorsuch wrote.\n\n\"Nor has Congress been insensitive to such requests. It has modified the antitrust laws for certain industries in the past, and it may do so again in the future,\" Gorsuch wrote. \"But until Congress says otherwise, the only law it has asked us to enforce is the Sherman Act, and that law is predicated on one assumption alone \u2014 'competition is the best method of allocating resources' in the Nation's economy.\""}, {"url": "https://www.ussportsscholarships.com/national-collegiate-athletic-association/", "page_content": "The NCAA regulates athletes of 1,281 North American institutions and conferences.

Alston , the U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously that the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) cannot restrict certain education-related benefits schools may offer student-athletes.\n\nThe NCAA regulates student-athlete compensation. A group of current and former student-athletes sued the NCAA claiming that its rules limiting education-related benefits violate the Sherman Act which prohibits \u201ccontract[s], combination[s], or conspiracy[ies] in restraint of trade or commerce.\u201d The NCAA limits scholarships for graduate or vocational school, payments for academic tutoring, and paid post-eligibility internships.\n\nIn an opinion written by Justice Gorsuch, the Supreme Court agreed with the federal district court that these limits violate federal antitrust law. The district court applied the \u201crule of reason\u201d test to decide this case. The test is intended to \u201cdistinguish between restraints with anticompetitive effect that are harmful to the consumer and restraints stimulating competition that are in the consumer\u2019s best interest.\u201d\n\nPer the rule of reason, the plaintiff (student-athletes in this case) must prove the restraint has a substantial anticompetitive effect. If the defendant (here the NCAA) can make that showing, \u201cthe burden shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the procompetitive efficiencies could be reasonably achieved through less anticompetitive means.\u201d\n\nThe federal district court concluded educational-related benefits couldn\u2019t be \u201cconfused with a professional athlete\u2019s salary.\u201d So, disallowing caps on them \u201cwould be substantially less restrictive than the NCAA\u2019s current rules and yet fully capable of preserving consumer demand for college sports.\u201d\n\nThe NCAA offered numerous general objections to how the district court reached its conclusion, all of which the Supreme Court rejected. The NCAA argued the Supreme Court should give the caps a \u201cquick look\u201d rather than applying the more rigorous rule of reason, the lower court applied the rule of reason analysis incorrectly, and Supreme Court precedent is in its favor.\n\nThe NCAA also offered three specific objections to the district court\u2019s holding the educational-related benefits cap violated anti-trust law.\n\nFirst, the NCAA was concerned that schools will use internships \u201cas a way of circumventing limits on payments that student-athletes may receive for athletic performance.\u201d But following the district court opinion the NCAA adopted a rule only allowing a \u201cconference or institution\u201d (rather than a sneaker company or auto dealership) to fund post-eligibility internships.\n\nSecond, the NCAA objected to the district court\u2019s ruling that aggregate limits on \u201cacademic or graduation\u201d achievement awards must be no lower than aggregate limit on athletic awards (currently $5,980 per year). According to the Court, \u201c[t]he NCAA does not believe that the athletic awards it presently allows are tantamount to a professional salary.\u201d\n\nFinally, the NCAA was concerned that allowing schools to offer scholarships for graduate degrees or vocational school and to pay for things like computers and tutoring might lead to schools giving student-athletes \u201cluxury cars\u201d \u201cto get to class\u201d and \u201cother unnecessary or inordinately valuable items\u201d only \u201cnominally\u201d related to education. The Court disagreed that this would be possible noting \u201cthe NCAA is free to forbid in-kind benefits unrelated to a student\u2019s actual education; nothing stops it from enforcing a \u2018no Lamborghini\u2019 rule.\u201d\n\nIt is noteworthy that the Supreme Court didn\u2019t review the lower court\u2019s additional holding in this case rejecting the student-athletes\u2019 challenge to NCAA rules that limit athletic scholarships to the full cost of attendance and that restrict compensation and benefits unrelated to education. The student-athletes didn\u2019t ask the Supreme Court to review that holding. Interestingly, Justice Kavanaugh wrote a brief concurring opinion \u201cto underscore that the NCAA\u2019s remaining compensation rules also raise serious questions under the antitrust laws.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://meridian.allenpress.com/jat/article/56/7/629/467951/Epidemiology-of-Injuries-in-National-Collegiate", "page_content": "Cross-country is a sport repetitive in nature that requires contestants to run great distances, traversing over various terrains (grass, wooden trails, and/or roads). Particularly in the United States, it is a popular sport among athletes of various ages, 1 and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) competition level is among the most elite levels in which cross-country athletes compete in the United States. The NCAA has sponsored men's cross-country programs since 1938, and since then, sponsorship and participation have notably grown. Even in recent years, participation has continued to follow an upward trajectory\u2014with the number of membership teams competing in NCAA men's cross country rising from 974 in 2014\u20132015 to 1000 in 2018\u20132019 (with over 14 000 student-athletes competing each year). 2 The abovementioned dynamics of the sport result in a undeniable sport-related injury burden for this group. As such, it is important to routinely examine the incidence of injury among NCAA men's cross-country athletes in juxtaposition to previously reported data to identify dynamic evolutions in this unique injury burden.\n\nSurveillance systems are robust public health tools that are effectively leveraged in sports settings as well used to examine the burden of sports-related injuries. The NCAA directed the creation of an injury surveillance system, now called the Injury Surveillance Program (ISP), to capture injury characteristics sustained by college athletes. 3 , 4 Although the NCAA ISP has historically captured injury-related data among men's cross-country athletes, the epidemiology of men's cross-country is yet not well defined. In previous work within this population, Kerr et al. reported an overall injury rate of 4.66 per 1000 athlete-exposures (AEs) and no difference in injury rates between practice and competition. 5 It has also been noted that although collision or contact injuries are uncommonly reported in this group, distance runners commonly report noncontact mechanisms of injury related to overuse, sprains, and strains. 5 In addition, ankle sprain and lower leg tendonitis were observed to be among the most prevalently reported injuries in this population. 5\n\nContinual surveillance-based investigations directed at sports-injury incidence not only supply athletic trainers (ATs) and sports medical staff with the most up to date information but also allow these clinicians and researchers to hypothesize interventions of mechanisms aimed at reducing the risk and burden of injury. Given the paucity of research in this population, further epidemiological investigations are warranted, particularly given the continuously increasing participation in NCAA-sponsored programs. Thus, the purpose of this study was to describe the epidemiology of men's cross-country injuries captured by the NCAA ISP during the 2014\u20132015 through 2018\u20132019 academic years.\n\nMen's cross-country exposure and injury data collected in the NCAA ISP during the 2014\u20132015 through 2018\u20132019 athletic seasons were analyzed in this study. The methods of the NCAA ISP have been reviewed and approved as an exempt study by the NCAA Research Review Board. The methods of the surveillance program are described in detail in separately within this special issue. 6 Briefly, ATs at participating institutions contributed exposure and injury data using their clinical electronic medical record systems. A reportable injury (or illness, inclusive of heat illnesses and respiratory conditions) was one that occurred due to participation in an organized intercollegiate practice or competition and required medical attention by a team certified AT or physician (regardless of time loss [TL]). Scheduled team practices and competitions were considered reportable exposures for this analysis. Data from 13 (1% of membership) participating cross-country programs in 2014\u20132015, 6 (\u223c1% of membership) in 2015\u20132016, 14 (1% of membership) in 2016\u20132017, 19 (2% of membership) in 2017\u20132018, and 36 (4% of membership) in 2018\u20132019 qualified for inclusion in the analyses. Qualification criteria are detailed further in the methods manuscript. 6\n\nInjury counts and rates per 1000 AEs (for which 1 AE was defined as 1 athlete participating in 1 exposure event) were assessed by event type (practice or competition), competition level (Division I, Division II, or Division III), season segment (preseason, regular season, or postseason), and TL (TL or non-TL [NTL]). Weighted and unweighted rates were estimated, and results are presented in terms of unweighted rates (due to low frequencies of injury observations across levels of certain covariates) unless otherwise specified. Temporal trends in injury rates across the study period were evaluated using stratified (by levels of abovementioned variables) rate profile plots. Injury counts and proportions were examined by TL, body part injured, mechanism of injury, injury diagnosis, and activity at the time of injury. Injury rate ratios (IRRs) were used to evaluate differential injury rates across event types, competition levels, and season segments. IRRs with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) excluding 1.00 were considered statistically significant, and all analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute).\n\nA total of 364 men's cross-country injuries were reported to the NCAA ISP from 90 723 AEs during 2014\u20132015 through 2018\u20132019 (rate = 4.01 per 1000 AEs). This equated to a national estimate of 22 056 injuries overall ( Table 1 ). A relatively small number of competition-related injuries (55 injuries) were reported during the study period, although the competition injury rate was higher than the practice rate (IRR = 2.11; 95% CI = 1.59, 2.82). Competition injury rates decreased notably between 2014\u20132015 and 2015\u20132016, remained relatively stable thereafter until 2017\u20132018, and increased drastically between 2017\u20132018 and 2018\u20132019 ( Figure A). In comparison, practice injury rates remained relatively stable across the study period ( Figure A). The overall Division III injury rate (rate = 5.48 per 1000 AEs) was higher than Division I (3.86 per 1000 AEs), and Division II (3.14 per 1000 AEs) injury rates; statistically significant differences were observed between Division I and Division III rates (IRR = 0.70; 95% CI = 0.55, 0.89), as well as between Division II and Division III rates (IRR = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.44, 0.75).\n\nDuring the 2014\u20132015 through 2018\u20132019 academic years, inflammatory conditions (musculoskeletal pathologies with degenerative characteristics to the corresponding tissue, such as bursitis, capsulitis, osteochondritis, and tendinitis; 30.2%), strains (18.7%), and sprains (11.5%) accounted for most reported men's cross-country injuries. Inflammatory conditions (most commonly reported in the lower leg or Achilles, knee, and foot or toes) accounted for a larger proportion of practice injuries (33.3%) than competition injuries (12.7%). Inflammatory conditions also occurred at a markedly higher rate in preseason (rate = 2.07 per 1000 AEs) than in the regular season (rate = 1.20 per 1000 AEs) and postseason (rate = 0.64 per 1000 AEs). Conversely, strains (29.1%) accounted for larger proportions of competition injuries than practice injuries (16.8%). The most commonly reported injuries during the study period were partial or complete lateral ligament complex tears (ankle sprains) (8.2%) and medial tibial stress syndrome (shin splints) (6.6%). During the study period, the overall rate of lateral ligament complex tears was 3.31 per 10 000 AEs (95% CI = 2.12, 4.49), and the overall rate of medial tibial stress syndrome was 2.65 per 10 000 AEs (95% CI = 1.59, 3.70).\n\nLower leg injuries (29.1%) accounted for the largest proportion of all injuries reported during the study period. Knee injuries (14.6%), ankle injuries (12.1%), and foot injuries (12.1%) were also common overall. Although knee injuries and foot injuries accounted for notably larger proportions of practice injuries than competition injuries, ankle injuries accounted for comparable proportions of both practice and competition injuries ( Table 3 ). Overuse (38.5%) and noncontact (32.1%) injuries accounted for most of all reported injuries; surface contact injuries also accounted for approximately 12% of all reported injuries ( Table 3 ). Noncontact injuries accounted for comparable proportions of practice (32.4%) and competition injuries (30.9%), whereas overuse injuries accounted for a notably larger proportion of practice injuries (41.4%) than competition injuries (21.8%).\n\nWe aimed to describe the epidemiology of NCAA men's cross-country injuries during the 2014\u20132015 through 2018\u20132019 athletic seasons. Across the study period, the competition injury rate was higher than the practice injury rate. Importantly, this result had not been observed previously in NCAA men's cross-country athletes; and particularly, the competition injury rate observed in this study was notably higher than the competition rates previously reported in this population.5 Given the trajectory of competition injury rates during the final years of this study, it may be important to closely monitor the incidence of competition injuries after 2018\u20132019 to better understand the burden of such injuries to this population. Similar results were observed when we examined injury rates by season segment. The overall preseason injury rate was higher than regular and postseason injury rates across the study period. However, the preseason injury rate was notably more variable than the regular and postseason rates. Although preseason and regular season rates were comparable between 2015\u20132016 and 2017\u20132018, the preseason injury rate increased sharply between 2017\u20132018 and 2018\u20132019. Much akin to competition injuries, this trajectory of preseason injury rates indicates the need to closely monitor preseason injury incidence and outcomes after 2018\u20132019. This may be particularly important given the notable increase in ISP participation observed during 2018\u20132019. NCAA ISP recruitment tactics have evolved over time, and the improvements in participation during 2018\u20132019 in particular reflects the success of recently used recruitment strategies (for instance, support and communication from the NCAA Sport Science Institute). Consequently, although it is reasonable to suggest that the injury rates and characteristics reported during the latter years of the study period more closely represent the larger population of interest (as compared with the earlier years) due to greater participation in the ISP, continued monitoring during sustained periods of healthy participation is needed. Closer monitoring of offseason and preseason training routines may be warranted if comparable preseason injury rates are observed beyond 2018\u20132019.\n\nMost injuries reported among men's NCAA cross-country athletes during 2014\u20132015 through 2018\u20132019 were inflammatory conditions, sprains, and strains. The prevalence of inflammatory conditions (delineated as musculoskeletal pathologies with degenerative characteristics to the tissue involved) is particularly noteworthy, and the relatively higher rate of such injuries in preseason (as compared with regular and postseason) suggests that inflammatory-related injuries, especially in preseason, warrant further attention in this population. In a sport in which the body's largest muscle groups are recruited to perform at maximal exertion for long periods of time, exercise-induced muscle damage (nonpathophysiological) is arguably expected given the physiological mechanisms involved in the recovery process.7,8 This suggested trend may be attributable to the nature of the sport, as athletes are required to undergo repetitive movements for long periods of time. These movements cause the body's largest muscle groups to perform in a high intensity capacity for long periods of time. This exercise-induced muscle damage is arguably expected given the physiological mechanism involved in the recovery process7,8 but may become pathological if appropriate recovery is not allowed.9 The current trend observed may suggest that cross-country athletes may not always be implementing the requisite recovery practices to prevent these conditions. Given the higher injury incidence during the preseason and time constraints that may hamper the athlete's ability to fully recover, implementation of preventative programs before athletic participation may serve as an effective intervention strategy and is an important avenue for future researchers.10 Furthermore, it is important to note that given the nature of sports injury surveillance, inflammatory conditions are made up of several potential injury diagnoses in the ISP (such as bursitis, capsulitis, osteochondritis, and tendinitis). As such, it is difficult to discuss these records in greater detail than in terms of commonly reported body parts or rates by season segment (as noted above) in this context. In future studies directed toward studying inflammatory conditions in this population, researchers may not only target specific types of inflammatory conditions but also capture physiological characteristics of athletes at various times during the season to expand the understanding of such injuries among NCAA men's cross-country athletes. Future study of training and recovery practices that are associated with a higher prevalence of such conditions may also be important.\n\nThe most commonly reported specific injuries were (partial or complete) lateral ligament complex tears (ankle sprains) and medial tibial stress syndrome (shin splints). Particularly with regards to medial tibial stress syndrome, prior research in collegiate athletes has suggested that potential etiological elements of this injury include weak hip abductors, restrictive hip musculature, and long durations of rearfoot eversion during stance.11 In addition, it has also been noted that greater hip external rotation (in males), prior orthotic use, fewer years of running experience, increased body mass index, navicular drop, and navicular drop greater than 10 millimeters are all factors associated with a higher risk of medial tibial stress syndrome.12 Importantly, we did not examine temporal patterns in rates of commonly observed injuries due to low injury frequencies (of both lateral ligament complex tears and medial tibial stress syndrome) observed per year. The observed frequencies are at least partially attributable to low ISP participation among men's cross-country programs, particularly during the earlier years of this study. Therefore, continued monitoring of commonly reported injuries is needed through a period of healthy and stable ISP participation among NCAA men's cross-country programs. Given the results observed here, it may be important to discuss the development injury prevention strategies for commonly observed injuries, while continuing to closely monitor the incidence (and associated outcomes) of such injuries after 2018\u20132019."}, {"url": "https://www.collegeequestrianconsulting.com/teams/", "page_content": "National Collegiate Equestrian Association (NCEA)\n\nList of College NCAA/NCEA Equestrian Teams: http://www.collegiateequestrian.com/schools/main/#.VR1Ru-l0xMw\n\nNCEA Website: http://www.collegiateequestrian.com/\n\nIn 1998, Equestrian was identified and adopted by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) as an emerging sport for women at the Division I and II levels. The National Collegiate Equestrian Association (NCEA) was created as a governing body to advance the sport of equestrian. NCAA Varsity Equestrian programs are fully funded by the university athletic departments. Equestrians receive the same benefits as other varsity athletes (soccer, basketball, etc.). The NCAA allows for a maximum of 15 College Equestrian Scholarships for each Division I and Division II program. Although benefits vary from school to school, additional benefits can include access to financial assistance, academic advising, tutors, athletic trainers and strength and conditioning coaches.\n\nNCEA is the most competitive format in Collegiate Equestrian. Riders must maintain an amateur status and there are specific rules and requirements that apply to these prospective college athletes. Currently more than 800 female students participate in NCAA/NCEA Equestrian representing eighteen Division I and four Division II programs. The average team includes 40 members. Disciplines include Hunter Seat and Western and with four events: Hunt Seat Equitation Over Fences, Hunt Seat Equitation on the Flat, Western Horsemanship and Western Reining. Competitions test five riders from each event in head-to-head competitions. Each rider receives a score, and the rider with the highest score receives one point for her team. A NCEA National Championship is held each year. National Champions are crowned in each of three areas: Western, English and Overall.\n\nIntercollegiate Horse Show Association (IHSA)\n\nList of College IHSA Equestrian Teams: https://members.ihsainc.com/publicteaminfo/currentteams.aspx\n\nIHSA Website: www.rideiea.org\n\nThe Intercollegiate Horse Show Association (IHSA), founded in 1967, is the largest of the intercollegiate riding organizations. At the heart of the IHSA philosophy is the belief that any college student (male or female) should be able to have the opportunity to participate in horse shows, regardless of their financial status or riding level. Horses are furnished by the host college thereby eliminating the expense associated with maintaining a horse. IHSA competitions encourage a level playing field by assigning horses at random. Riders of all levels can participate and contribute to the team score. Currently, 412 member colleges and nearly 9000 students participate in IHSA. Approximately 450 students compete each year in the IHSA National Championships. Both individuals and teams qualify at all levels.\n\nWithin the IHSA, riders can compete in Hunter Seat Over Fences and On the Flat, and Western Horsemanship and Reining. In both Hunter Seat and Western divisions, riders are judged on their equitation. There are eight levels within the Hunter Seat division including: Walk-trot, Walk-trot-canter, Novice, Intermediate and Open on the Flat and Novice, Intermediate and Open Over Fences. In Western competition there are six levels: Beginner, Intermediate, Novice, Advanced and Open Horsemanship and Open Reining. An Open Western rider may compete in a horsemanship and a reining class but to compete in a reining class the rider must be in the Open level and have six months professional training prior to competition.\n\nIntercollegiate Dressage Association\n\nList of College IDA Equestrian Teams: http://teamdressage.com/about-us/member-schools\n\nFounded in 1995, the Intercollegiate Dressage Association\u2019s (IDA) mission is to introduce students to the equestrian discipline of dressage and to foster continued development, understanding and appreciation in the art of dressage through organized student competitions and educational opportunities. Multiple schools across the USA offer College Equestrian Scholarships to United States Pony Club members. The IDA provides a series of dressage competitions affiliated with the U.S. Dressage Federation and adheres closely to the US Equeshttp://www.collegeequestrianconsulting.comtrian Federation rules. It is not necessary for IDA competitors to provide their own horse. Host colleges provide the horses used during competitions which adds to the challenge and sportsmanship of the competition. Presently 58 schools representing 9 regions participate in the IDA. At IDA shows collegiate riders in teams of four, compete at Introductory, Lower Training Level, tests 1and 2, Upper Training Level, tests 3 and 4, and First Level. Both individual and team points are earned towards regional standings and qualification for national finals.\n\nUnited States Eventing Association (USEA)\n\nList of Colleges with Eventing Programs: http://useventing.com/directory/colleges\n\nIn 2014, the United States Eventing Association (USEA) approved the creation of the Intercollegiate Eventing Program as an official program of the USEA. The program was established to provide a framework on which eventing teams and individual competition could flourish at universities and colleges across the country. Collegiate athletic programs have been the training grounds for Olympians, amateur athletes and professional athletes for generations. Enabling college students to train in the Olympic sport of eventing is a natural addition.\n\nIntercollegiate Team Challenges are quickly becoming popular additions to recognized horse trials in the United States. Teams competing in events identified as Intercollegiate Team Challenges are able to self-identify to the competition organizer, and will compete in the regular horse trial competition as individuals. Combining their individual scores, their team scores will be tabulated and matched against other teams.

Over the years, NIRA\u2019s history has read like a Who\u2019s Who in the sport of rodeo. Roy Cooper, Chris LeDoux, Ty Murray, Tuff Hedeman, Dan Mortensen, and many more, are all champions in college rodeo, as well as professional rodeo. Today nearly 200 member colleges and universities and over 3,500 student members participate in the NIRA.\n\nNIRA members compete in saddle bronc, bareback, bull riding, steer wrestling, calf roping, team roping, barrel racing, breakaway roping and goat tying. Each of the 11regions host 10 rodeos during the school year. The top three students in each event, and top two men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams from the NIRA\u2019s 11 regions qualify for the College National Finals Rodeo (CNFR.) National team championships are awarded to both men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams. Over 400 students from over 100 universities and colleges compete in the CNFR.\n\nAmerican National Riding Commission (ANRC)\n\nList of ANRC Teams: http://anrc.org/what_is_anrc/participating-colleges-and-universities/\n\nThe primary goal of American National Riding Commission (ANRC) is to promote the American System of Forward Riding. Students compete on a college-owned horse or a privately owned horse. The ANRC Intercollegiate Equitation Championship is a National championship recognizing both individual and team levels. Colleges showcase their most talented riders in a competition judged on equitation skills and producing a smooth, cooperative performance exemplifying quality hunter movement both on the flat and over fences. There are two divisions: Novice (2\u20196\u201d) and National (3\u2019). The four phases of competition are: Written, Program Ride (using U.S. Equestrian Federation Tests 1-19), Derby Phase and Medal Phase.\n\nMore than 70 colleges have competed in the ANRC National Intercollegiate Championships over its 34 year history. USHJA is a primary sponsor of the ANRC National Intercollegiate Equitation Championship and ANRC competitors are eligible for the USHJA Affiliates Awards program. There are five ANRC Awards distributed annually at the ANRC Intercollegiate Championship, in addition to the competitive awards, four of which are sponsored by USHJA.\n\nCollege Equestrian Disciplines\n\nHunter Seat on the Flat\n\nThe riders have to perform a flat test on their horses in a 40 x 20 meter arena. The test consists of nine movements to be judged on accuracy, smoothness and overall position of the rider. Riders are judged on their equitation. In IHSA Hunter Seat competition riders may choose to ride in a flat class, over fences class, or both. In IHSA Hunter Seat On the Flat competition there are six levels of competition: Walk-trot; Beginner; Advanced walk-trot-canter; Novice; Intermediate; Open.\n\nIn NCAA/NCEA Hunter Seat on the Flat competition there is one level of competition: Open.\n\nHunter Seat Over Fences\n\nThe judges evaluate the rider\u2019s position, consistency on course, smoothness, flow from jump to jump, the number of strides (steps taken by the horse) in a line and the rider\u2019s plan to complete the course. Riders are judged on their equitation.\n\nIn IHSA Hunter Seat competition riders may choose to ride in an over fences class, a flat class, or both. In IHSA Hunter Seat Equitation Over Fences there are three levels of competition: Novice, Intermediate and Open.\n\nIn NCAA/NCEA Hunter Seat Equitation Over Fences there is one level of competition: Open.\n\nWestern Horsemanship\n\nThis event is designed to evaluate the rider\u2019s ability to execute a prescribed set of maneuvers with precision and smoothness while maintaining a balanced, functional and fundamentally correct body position. The ideal horsemanship pattern consists of seven to nine maneuvers and is extremely precise with horse and rider working in complete unison, executing each maneuver with subtle aids and cues. Riders are judged on their equitation.\n\nIn IHSA competition there are five levels of Western Horsemanship: Beginner, Intermediate, Novice, Advanced and Open\n\nIn NCAA/NCEA competition there is one level of Western Horsemanship: Open\n\nWestern Reining\n\nThis is a class based on set patterns and a precise scoring system. Within these patterns the horse\u2019s and rider\u2019s athletic abilities are tested in a series of maneuvers including spins, stops, flying lead changes and circles with changes in size and speed. In collegiate competition, the rider must perform one of the set National Reining Horse Association (NHRA) patterns. Riders are judged on their equitation.\n\nIn IHSA competition there is one level of Western Reining: Open.\n\nIn NCAA/NCEA competition there is one level of Western Reining: Open\n\nDressage\n\nThe Intercollegiate Dressage Association (IDA) is affiliated with the United States Dressage Federation and adheres closely to the US Equestrian Federation rules. The dressage test comprises a set series of memorized movements performed in an enclosed arena. Ideally the horse appears to perform the test\u2019s movements on its own accord, working in harmony with its rider. The test is scored on each movement with the overall harmony and precision of the test taken into consideration. In IDA competition there are four levels of Dressage. Introductory Level (Intro A & Intro B), Lower Training Level (Intro C & Training Level Test 1), Upper Training Level (Training Level Test 2&3) and First Level Test.\n\nRodeo\n\nIn the National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association (NIRA) there is one level of competition. Women\u2019s teams compete in four events: Barrel Racing; Breakaway Roping, Goat Tying and Team Roping.\n\nNational Intercollegiate Rodeo Association Men\u2019s teams compete in six events: Tie Down Roping; Steer Wrestling; Team Roping; Bull Riding; Bareback and Saddle Bronc Riding"}, {"url": "https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/20-512", "page_content": "NOTICE: This opinion is subject to formal revision before publication in the preliminary print of the United States Reports.

At the same time, the court struck down NCAA rules limiting the education-related benefits schools may offer student-athletes\u2014such as rules that prohibit schools from offering graduate or vocational school scholarships. Before us, the student-athletes do not challenge the district court\u2019s judgment. But the NCAA does. In essence, it seeks immunity from the normal operation of the antitrust laws and argues, in any event, that the district court should have approved all of its existing restraints. We took this case to consider those objections.\n\nI\n\nA\n\nFrom the start, American colleges and universities have had a complicated relationship with sports and money. In 1852, students from Harvard and Yale participated in what many regard as the Nation\u2019s first intercollegiate competition\u2014a boat race at Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire. But this was no pickup match. A railroad executive sponsored the event to promote train travel to the picturesque lake. T. Mendenhall, The Harvard-Yale Boat Race 1852\u20131924, pp. 15\u201316 (1993). He offered the competitors an all-expenses-paid vacation with lavish prizes\u2014along with unlimited alcohol. See A. Zimbalist, Unpaid Professionals 6\u20137 (1999) (Zimbalist); Rushin, Inside the Moat, Sports Illustrated, Mar. 3, 1997. The event filled the resort with \u201clife and excitement,\u201d N. Y. Herald, Aug. 10, 1852, p. 2, col. 2, and one student-athlete described the \u201c \u2018junket\u2019 \u201d as an experience \u201c \u2018as unique and irreproducible as the Rhodian colossus,\u2019 \u201d Mendenhall, Harvard-Yale Boat Race, at 20.\n\nLife might be no \u201cless than a boat race,\u201d Holmes, On Receiving the Degree of Doctor of Laws, Yale University Commencement, June 30, 1886, in Speeches by Oliver Wendall Holmes, p. 27 (1918), but it was football that really caused college sports to take off. \u201cBy the late 1880s the traditional rivalry between Princeton and Yale was attracting 40,000 spectators and generating in excess of $25,000 . . . in gate revenues.\u201d Zimbalist 7. Schools regularly had \u201cgraduate students and paid ringers\u201d on their teams. Ibid.\n\nColleges offered all manner of compensation to talented athletes. Yale reportedly lured a tackle named James Hogan with free meals and tuition, a trip to Cuba, the exclusive right to sell scorecards from his games\u2014and a job as a cigarette agent for the American Tobacco Company. Ibid.; see also Needham, The College Athlete, McClure\u2019s Magazine, June 1905, p. 124. The absence of academic residency requirements gave rise to \u201c \u2018tramp athletes\u2019 \u201d who \u201croamed the country making cameo athletic appearances, moving on whenever and wherever the money was better.\u201d F. Dealy, Win at Any Cost 71 (1990). One famous example was a law student at West Virginia University\u2014Fielding H. Yost\u2014\u201cwho, in 1896, transferred to Lafayette as a freshman just in time to lead his new teammates to victory against its arch-rival, Penn.\u201d Ibid. The next week, he \u201cwas back at West Virginia\u2019s law school.\u201d Ibid. College sports became such a big business that Woodrow Wilson, then President of Princeton University, quipped to alumni in 1890 that \u201c \u2018Princeton is noted in this wide world for three things: football, baseball, and collegiate instruction.\u2019 \u201d Zimbalist 7.\n\nBy 1905, though, a crisis emerged. While college football was hugely popular, it was extremely violent. Plays like the flying wedge and the players\u2019 light protective gear led to 7 football fatalities in 1893, 12 deaths the next year, and 18 in 1905. Id., at 8. President Theodore Roosevelt responded by convening a meeting between Harvard, Princeton, and Yale to review the rules of the game, a gathering that ultimately led to the creation of what we now know as the NCAA. Ibid. Organized primarily as a standard-setting body, the association also expressed a view at its founding about compensating college athletes\u2014admonishing that \u201c[n]o student shall represent a College or University in any intercollegiate game or contest who is paid or receives, directly or indirectly, any money, or financial concession.\u201d Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States Constitution By-Laws, Art. VII, \u00a73 (1906); see also Proceedings of the Eleventh Annual Convention of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, Dec. 28, 1916, p. 34.\n\nReality did not always match aspiration. More than two decades later, the Carnegie Foundation produced a report on college athletics that found them still \u201csodden with the commercial and the material and the vested interests that these forces have created.\u201d H. Savage, The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, American College Athletics Bull. 23, p. 310 (1929). Schools across the country sought to leverage sports to bring in revenue, attract attention, boost enrollment, and raise money from alumni. The University of California\u2019s athletic revenue was over $480,000, while Harvard\u2019s football revenue alone came in at $429,000. Id., at 87. College football was \u201cnot a student\u2019s game\u201d; it was an \u201corganized commercial enterprise\u201d featuring athletes with \u201cyears of training,\u201d \u201cprofessional coaches,\u201d and competitions that were \u201chighly profitable.\u201d Id., at viii.\n\nThe commercialism extended to the market for student-athletes. Seeking the best players, many schools actively participated in a system \u201cunder which boys are offered pecuniary and other inducements to enter a particular college.\u201d Id., at xiv\u2013xv. One coach estimated that a rival team \u201cspent over $200,000 a year on players.\u201d Zimbalist 9. In 1939, freshmen at the University of Pittsburgh went on strike because upperclassmen were reportedly earning more money. Crabb, The Amateurism Myth: A Case for a New Tradition, 28 Stan. L. & Pol\u2019y Rev. 181, 190 (2017). In the 1940s, Hugh McElhenny, a halfback at the University of Washington, \u201cbecame known as the first college player \u2018ever to take a cut in salary to play pro football.\u2019 \u201d Zimbalist 22\u201323. He reportedly said: \u201c \u2018[A] wealthy guy puts big bucks under my pillow every time I score a touchdown. Hell, I can\u2019t afford to graduate.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 211, n. 17. In 1946, a commentator offered this view: \u201c[W]hen it comes to chicanery, double-dealing, and general undercover work behind the scenes, big-time college football is in a class by itself.\u201d Woodward, Is College Football on the Level?, Sport, Nov. 1946, Vol. 1, No. 3, p. 35.\n\nIn 1948, the NCAA sought to do more than admonish. It adopted the \u201cSanity Code.\u201d Colleges Adopt the \u2018Sanity Code\u2019 To Govern Sports, N. Y. Times, Jan. 11, 1948, p. 1, col. 1. The code reiterated the NCAA\u2019s opposition to \u201cpromised pay in any form.\u201d Hearings before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 95th Congress, 2d Sess., pt. 2, p. 1094 (1978). But for the first time the code also authorized colleges and universities to pay athletes\u2019 tuition. Ibid. And it created a new enforcement mechanism\u2014providing for the \u201csuspension or expulsion\u201d of \u201cproven offenders.\u201d Colleges Adopt \u2018Sanity Code,\u2019 N. Y. Times, p. 1, col. 1. To some, these changes sought to substitute a consistent, above-board compensation system for the varying under-the-table schemes that had long proliferated. To others, the code marked \u201cthe beginning of the NCAA behaving as an effective cartel,\u201d by enabling its member schools to set and enforce \u201crules that limit the price they have to pay for their inputs (mainly the \u2018student-athletes\u2019).\u201d Zimbalist 10.\n\nThe rules regarding student-athlete compensation have evolved ever since. In 1956, the NCAA expanded the scope of allowable payments to include room, board, books, fees, and \u201ccash for incidental expenses such as laundry.\u201d In re National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Athletic Grant-in-Aid Cap Antitrust Litig., 375 F. Supp. 3d 1058, 1063 (ND Cal. 2019) (hereinafter D. Ct. Op.). In 1974, the NCAA began permitting paid professionals in one sport to compete on an amateur basis in another. Brief for Historians as Amici Curiae 10. In 2014, the NCAA \u201cannounced it would allow athletic conferences to authorize their member schools to increase scholarships up to the full cost of attendance.\u201d O\u2019Bannon v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn., 802 F. 3d 1049, 1054\u20131055 (CA9 2015). The 80 member schools of the \u201cPower Five\u201d athletic conferences\u2014the conferences with the highest revenue in Division I\u2014promptly voted to raise their scholarship limits to an amount that is generally several thousand dollars higher than previous limits. D. Ct. Op., at 1064.\n\nIn recent years, changes have continued. The NCAA has created the \u201cStudent Assistance Fund\u201d and the \u201cAcademic Enhancement Fund\u201d to \u201cassist student-athletes in meeting financial needs,\u201d \u201cimprove their welfare or academic support,\u201d or \u201crecognize academic achievement.\u201d Id., at 1072. These funds have supplied money to student-athletes for \u201cpostgraduate scholarships\u201d and \u201cschool supplies,\u201d as well as \u201cbenefits that are not related to education,\u201d such as \u201closs-of-value insurance premiums,\u201d \u201ctravel expenses,\u201d \u201cclothing,\u201d and \u201cmagazine subscriptions.\u201d Id., at 1072, n. 15. In 2018, the NCAA made more than $84 million available through the Student Activities Fund and more than $48 million available through the Academic Enhancement Fund. Id., at 1072. Assistance may be provided in cash or in kind, and there is no limit to the amount any particular student-athlete may receive. Id., at 1073. Since 2015, disbursements to individual students have sometimes been tens of thousands of dollars above the full cost of attendance. Ibid.\n\nThe NCAA has also allowed payments \u201c \u2018incidental to athletics participation,\u2019 \u201d including awards for \u201cparticipation or achievement in athletics\u201d (like \u201cqualifying for a bowl game\u201d) and certain \u201cpayments from outside entities\u201d (such as for \u201cperformance in the Olympics\u201d). Id., at 1064, 1071, 1074. The NCAA permits its member schools to award up to (but no more than) two annual \u201cSenior Scholar Awards\u201d of $10,000 for students to attend graduate school after their athletic eligibility expires. Id., at 1074. Finally, the NCAA allows schools to fund travel for student-athletes\u2019 family members to attend \u201ccertain events.\u201d Id., at 1069.\n\nOver the decades, the NCAA has become a sprawling enterprise. Its membership comprises about 1,100 colleges and universities, organized into three divisions. Id., at 1063. Division I teams are often the most popular and attract the most money and the most talented athletes. Currently, Division I includes roughly 350 schools divided across 32 conferences. See ibid. Within Division I, the most popular sports are basketball and football. The NCAA divides Division I football into the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and the Football Championship Subdivision, with the FBS generally featuring the best teams. Ibid. The 32 conferences in Division I function similarly to the NCAA itself, but on a smaller scale. They \u201ccan and do enact their own rules.\u201d Id., at 1090.\n\nAt the center of this thicket of associations and rules sits a massive business. The NCAA\u2019s current broadcast contract for the March Madness basketball tournament is worth $1.1 billion annually. See id., at 1077, n. 20. Its television deal for the FBS conference\u2019s College Football Playoff is worth approximately $470 million per year. See id., at 1063; Bachman, ESPN Strikes Deal for College Football Playoff, Wall Street Journal, Nov. 21, 2012. Beyond these sums, the Division I conferences earn substantial revenue from regular-season games. For example, the Southeastern Conference (SEC) \u201cmade more than $409 million in revenues from television contracts alone in 2017, with its total conference revenues exceeding $650 million that year.\u201d D. Ct. Op., at 1063. All these amounts have \u201cincreased consistently over the years.\u201d Ibid.\n\nThose who run this enterprise profit in a different way than the student-athletes whose activities they oversee. The president of the NCAA earns nearly $4 million per year. Brief for Players Association of the National Football League et al. as Amici Curiae 17. Commissioners of the top conferences take home between $2 to $5 million. Ibid. College athletic directors average more than $1 million annually. Ibid. And annual salaries for top Division I college football coaches approach $11 million, with some of their assistants making more than $2.5 million. Id., at 17\u201318.\n\nB\n\nThe plaintiffs are current and former student-athletes in men\u2019s Division I FBS football and men\u2019s and women\u2019s Division I basketball. They filed a class action against the NCAA and 11 Division I conferences (for simplicity\u2019s sake, we refer to the defendants collectively as the NCAA). The student-athletes challenged the \u201ccurrent, interconnected set of NCAA rules that limit the compensation they may receive in exchange for their athletic services.\u201d D. Ct. Op., at 1062, 1065, n. 5. Specifically, they alleged that the NCAA\u2019s rules violate \u00a71 of the Sherman Act, which prohibits \u201ccontract[s], combination[s], or conspirac[ies] in restraint of trade or commerce.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a71.\n\nAfter pretrial proceedings stretching years, the district court conducted a 10-day bench trial. It heard experts and lay witnesses from both sides, and received volumes of evidence and briefing, all before issuing an exhaustive decision. In the end, the court found the evidence undisputed on certain points. The NCAA did not \u201ccontest evidence showing\u201d that it and its members have agreed to compensation limits on student-athletes; the NCAA and its conferences enforce these limits by punishing violations; and these limits \u201caffect interstate commerce.\u201d D. Ct. Op., at 1066.\n\nBased on these premises, the district court proceeded to assess the lawfulness of the NCAA\u2019s challenged restraints. This Court has \u201clong recognized that in view of the common law and the law in this country when the Sherman Act was passed, the phrase \u2018restraint of trade\u2019 is best read to mean \u2018undue restraint.\u2019 \u201d Ohio v. American Express Co., 585 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 8) (brackets and some internal quotation marks omitted). Determining whether a restraint is undue for purposes of the Sherman Act \u201cpresumptively\u201d calls for what we have described as a \u201crule of reason analysis.\u201d Texaco Inc. v. Dagher, 547 U. S. 1, 5 (2006); Standard Oil Co. of N. J. v. United States, 221 U. S. 1, 60\u201362 (1911). That manner of analysis generally requires a court to \u201cconduct a fact-specific assessment of market power and market structure\u201d to assess a challenged restraint\u2019s \u201cactual effect on competition.\u201d American Express, 585 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 8\u20139) (internal quotation marks omitted). Always, \u201c[t]he goal is to distinguish between restraints with anticompetitive effect that are harmful to the consumer and restraints stimulating competition that are in the consumer\u2019s best interest.\u201d Ibid. (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nIn applying the rule of reason, the district court began by observing that the NCAA enjoys \u201cnear complete dominance of, and exercise[s] monopsony power in, the relevant market\u201d\u2014which it defined as the market for \u201cathletic services in men\u2019s and women\u2019s Division I basketball and FBS football, wherein each class member participates in his or her sport-specific market.\u201d D. Ct. Op., at 1097. The \u201cmost talented athletes are concentrated\u201d in the \u201cmarkets for Division I basketball and FBS football.\u201d Id., at 1067. There are no \u201cviable substitutes,\u201d as the \u201cNCAA\u2019s Division I essentially is the relevant market for elite college football and basketball.\u201d Id., at 1067, 1070. In short, the NCAA and its member schools have the \u201cpower to restrain student-athlete compensation in any way and at any time they wish, without any meaningful risk of diminishing their market dominance.\u201d Id., at 1070.\n\nThe district court then proceeded to find that the NCAA\u2019s compensation limits \u201cproduce significant anticompetitive effects in the relevant market.\u201d Id., at 1067. Though member schools compete fiercely in recruiting student-athletes, the NCAA uses its monopsony power to \u201ccap artificially the compensation offered to recruits.\u201d Id., at 1097. In a market without the challenged restraints, the district court found, \u201ccompetition among schools would increase in terms of the compensation they would offer to recruits, and student- athlete compensation would be higher as a result.\u201d Id., at 1068. \u201cStudent-athletes would receive offers that would more closely match the value of their athletic services.\u201d Ibid. And notably, the court observed, the NCAA \u201cdid not meaningfully dispute\u201d any of this evidence. Id., at 1067; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 31 (\u201c[T]here\u2019s no dispute that the\u2014the no-pay-for-play rule imposes a significant restraint on a relevant antitrust market\u201d).\n\nThe district court next considered the NCAA\u2019s procompetitive justifications for its restraints. The NCAA suggested that its restrictions help increase output in college sports and maintain a competitive balance among teams. But the district court rejected those justifications, D. Ct. Op., at 1070, n. 12, and the NCAA does not pursue them here. The NCAA\u2019s only remaining defense was that its rules preserve amateurism, which in turn widens consumer choice by providing a unique product\u2014amateur college sports as distinct from professional sports. Admittedly, this asserted benefit accrues to consumers in the NCAA\u2019s seller-side consumer market rather than to student-athletes whose compensation the NCAA fixes in its buyer-side labor market. But, the NCAA argued, the district court needed to assess its restraints in the labor market in light of their procompetitive benefits in the consumer market\u2014and the district court agreed to do so. Id., at 1098.\n\nTurning to that task, the court observed that the NCAA\u2019s conception of amateurism has changed steadily over the years. See id., at 1063\u20131064, 1072\u20131073; see also supra, at 3\u20137. The court noted that the NCAA \u201cnowhere define[s] the nature of the amateurism they claim consumers insist upon.\u201d D. Ct. Op., at 1070. And, given all this, the court struggled to ascertain for itself \u201cany coherent definition\u201d of the term, id., at 1074, noting the testimony of a former SEC commissioner that he\u2019s \u201c \u2018never been clear on . . . what is really meant by amateurism.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 1070\u20131071.\n\nNor did the district court find much evidence to support the NCAA\u2019s contention that its compensation restrictions play a role in consumer demand. As the court put it, the evidence failed \u201cto establish that the challenged compensation rules, in and of themselves, have any direct connection to consumer demand.\u201d Id., at 1070. The court observed, for example, that the NCAA\u2019s \u201conly economics expert on the issue of consumer demand\u201d did not \u201cstudy any standard measures of consumer demand\u201d but instead simply \u201cinterviewed people connected with the NCAA and its schools, who were chosen for him by defense counsel.\u201d Id., at 1075. Meanwhile, the student-athletes presented expert testimony and other evidence showing that consumer demand has increased markedly despite the new types of compensation the NCAA has allowed in recent decades. Id., at 1074, 1076. The plaintiffs presented economic and other evidence suggesting as well that further increases in student-athlete compensation would \u201cnot negatively affect consumer demand.\u201d Id., at 1076. At the same time, however, the district court did find that one particular aspect of the NCAA\u2019s compensation limits \u201cmay have some effect in preserving consumer demand.\u201d Id., at 1082. Specifically, the court found that rules aimed at ensuring \u201cstudent-athletes do not receive unlimited payments unrelated to education\u201d could play some role in product differentiation with professional sports and thus help sustain consumer demand for college athletics. Id., at 1083.\n\nThe court next required the student-athletes to show that \u201csubstantially less restrictive alternative rules\u201d existed that \u201cwould achieve the same procompetitive effect as the challenged set of rules.\u201d Id., at 1104. The district court emphasized that the NCAA must have \u201cample latitude\u201d to run its enterprise and that courts \u201cmay not use antitrust laws to make marginal adjustments to broadly reasonable market restraints.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). In light of these standards, the court found the student-athletes had met their burden in some respects but not others. The court rejected the student-athletes\u2019 challenge to NCAA rules that limit athletic scholarships to the full cost of attendance and that restrict compensation and benefits unrelated to education. These may be price-fixing agreements, but the court found them to be reasonable in light of the possibility that \u201cprofessional-level cash payments . . . could blur the distinction between college sports and professional sports and thereby negatively affect consumer demand.\u201d Ibid.\n\nThe court reached a different conclusion for caps on education-related benefits\u2014such as rules that limit scholarships for graduate or vocational school, payments for academic tutoring, or paid posteligibility internships. Id., at 1088. On no account, the court found, could such education-related benefits be \u201cconfused with a professional athlete\u2019s salary.\u201d Id., at 1083. If anything, they \u201cemphasize that the recipients are students.\u201d Ibid. Enjoining the NCAA\u2019s restrictions on these forms of compensation alone, the court concluded, would be substantially less restrictive than the NCAA\u2019s current rules and yet fully capable of preserving consumer demand for college sports. Id., at 1088.\n\nThe court then entered an injunction reflecting its findings and conclusions. Nothing in the order precluded the NCAA from continuing to fix compensation and benefits unrelated to education; limits on athletic scholarships, for example, remained untouched. The court enjoined the NCAA only from limiting education-related compensation or benefits that conferences and schools may provide to student-athletes playing Division I football and basketball. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 20\u2013512, p. 167a, \u00b61. The court\u2019s injunction further specified that the NCAA could continue to limit cash awards for academic achievement\u2014but only so long as those limits are no lower than the cash awards allowed for athletic achievement (currently $5,980 annually). Id., at 168a\u2013169a, \u00b65; Order Granting Motion for Clarification of Injunction in No. 4:14\u2013md\u201302541, ECF Doc. 1329, pp. 5\u20136 (ND Cal., Dec. 30, 2020). The court added that the NCAA and its members were free to propose a definition of compensation or benefits \u201c \u2018related to education.\u2019 \u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 20\u2013512, at 168a, \u00b64. And the court explained that the NCAA was free to regulate how conferences and schools provide education-related compensation and benefits. Ibid. The court further emphasized that its injunction applied only to the NCAA and multi-conference agreements\u2014thus allowing individual conferences (and the schools that constitute them) to impose tighter restrictions if they wish. Id., at 169a, \u00b66. The district court\u2019s injunction issued in March 2019, and took effect in August 2020.\n\nBoth sides appealed. The student-athletes said the district court did not go far enough; it should have enjoined all of the NCAA\u2019s challenged compensation limits, including those \u201cuntethered to education,\u201d like its restrictions on the size of athletic scholarships and cash awards. In re National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Athletic Grant-in-Aid Cap Antitrust Litig., 958 F. 3d 1239, 1263 (CA9 2020). The NCAA, meanwhile, argued that the district court went too far by weakening its restraints on education-related compensation and benefits. In the end, the court of appeals affirmed in full, explaining its view that \u201cthe district court struck the right balance in crafting a remedy that both prevents anticompetitive harm to Student-Athletes while serving the procompetitive purpose of preserving the popularity of college sports.\u201d Ibid.\n\nC\n\nUnsatisfied with this result, the NCAA asks us to reverse to the extent the lower courts sided with the student- athletes. For their part, the student-athletes do not renew their across-the-board challenge to the NCAA\u2019s compensation restrictions. Accordingly, we do not pass on the rules that remain in place or the district court\u2019s judgment upholding them. Our review is confined to those restrictions now enjoined.\n\nBefore us, as through much of the litigation below, some of the issues most frequently debated in antitrust litigation are uncontested. The parties do not challenge the district court\u2019s definition of the relevant market. They do not contest that the NCAA enjoys monopoly (or, as it\u2019s called on the buyer side, monopsony) control in that labor market\u2014such that it is capable of depressing wages below competitive levels and restricting the quantity of student-athlete labor. Nor does the NCAA dispute that its member schools compete fiercely for student-athletes but remain subject to NCAA-issued-and-enforced limits on what compensation they can offer. Put simply, this suit involves admitted horizontal price fixing in a market where the defendants exercise monopoly control.\n\nOther significant matters are taken as given here too. No one disputes that the NCAA\u2019s restrictions in fact decrease the compensation that student-athletes receive compared to what a competitive market would yield. No one questions either that decreases in compensation also depress participation by student-athletes in the relevant labor market\u2014so that price and quantity are both suppressed. See 12 P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law \u00b62011b, p. 134 (4th ed. 2019) (Areeda & Hovenkamp). Nor does the NCAA suggest that, to prevail, the plaintiff student-athletes must show that its restraints harm competition in the seller-side (or consumer facing) market as well as in its buyer-side (or labor) market. See, e.g., Mandeville Island Farms, Inc. v. American Crystal Sugar Co., 334 U. S. 219, 235 (1948); Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Co., 549 U. S. 312, 321 (2007); 2A Areeda & Hovenkamp \u00b6352c, pp. 288\u2013289 (2014); 12 id., \u00b62011a, at 132\u2013134.\n\nMeanwhile, the student-athletes do not question that the NCAA may permissibly seek to justify its restraints in the labor market by pointing to procompetitive effects they produce in the consumer market. Some amici argue that \u201ccompetition in input markets is incommensurable with competition in output markets,\u201d and that a court should not \u201ctrade off \u201d sacrificing a legally cognizable interest in competition in one market to better promote competition in a different one; review should instead be limited to the particular market in which antitrust plaintiffs have asserted their injury. Brief for American Antitrust Institute as Amicus Curiae 3, 11\u201312. But the parties before us do not pursue this line.\n\nII\n\nA\n\nWith all these matters taken as given, we express no views on them. Instead, we focus only on the objections the NCAA does raise. Principally, it suggests that the lower courts erred by subjecting its compensation restrictions to a rule of reason analysis. In the NCAA\u2019s view, the courts should have given its restrictions at most an \u201cabbreviated deferential review,\u201d Brief for Petitioner in No. 20\u2013512, p. 14, or a \u201c \u2018quick look,\u2019 \u201d Brief for Petitioners in No. 20\u2013520, p. 18, before approving them.\n\nThe NCAA offers a few reasons why. Perhaps dominantly, it argues that it is a joint venture and that collaboration among its members is necessary if they are to offer consumers the benefit of intercollegiate athletic competition. We doubt little of this. There\u2019s no question, for example, that many \u201cjoint ventures are calculated to enable firms to do something more cheaply or better than they did it before.\u201d 13 Areeda & Hovenkamp \u00b62100c, at 7. And the fact that joint ventures can have such procompetitive benefits surely stands as a caution against condemning their arrangements too reflexively. See Dagher, 547 U. S., at 7; Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U. S. 1, 22\u201323 (1979).\n\nBut even assuming (without deciding) that the NCAA is a joint venture, that does not guarantee the foreshortened review it seeks. Most restraints challenged under the Sherman Act\u2014including most joint venture restrictions\u2014are subject to the rule of reason, which (again) we have described as \u201ca fact-specific assessment of market power and market structure\u201d aimed at assessing the challenged restraint\u2019s \u201cactual effect on competition\u201d\u2014especially its capacity to reduce output and increase price. American Express, 585 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 8\u20139) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nAdmittedly, the amount of work needed to conduct a fair assessment of these questions can vary. As the NCAA observes, this Court has suggested that sometimes we can determine the competitive effects of a challenged restraint in the \u201c \u2018twinkling of an eye.\u2019 \u201d Board of Regents, 468 U. S., at 110, n. 39 (quoting P. Areeda, The \u201cRule of Reason\u201d in Antitrust Analysis: General Issues 37\u201338 (Federal Judicial Center, June 1981)); American Needle, Inc. v. National Football League, 560 U. S. 183, 203 (2010). That is true, though, only for restraints at opposite ends of the competitive spectrum. For those sorts of restraints\u2014rather than restraints in the great in-between\u2014a quick look is sufficient for approval or condemnation.\n\nAt one end of the spectrum, some restraints may be so obviously incapable of harming competition that they require little scrutiny. In Rothery Storage & Van Co. v. Atlas Van Lines, Inc., 792 F. 2d 210 (CADC 1986), for example, Judge Bork explained that the analysis could begin and end with the observation that the joint venture under review \u201ccommand[ed] between 5.1 and 6% of the relevant market.\u201d Id., at 217. Usually, joint ventures enjoying such small market share are incapable of impairing competition. Should they reduce their output, \u201cthere would be no effect upon market price because firms making up the other 94% of the market would simply take over the abandoned business.\u201d Ibid.; see also 7 Areeda & Hovenkamp \u00b61507a, p. 444 (2017) (If \u201cthe exercise of market power is not plausible, the challenged practice is legal\u201d); Polk Bros., Inc. v. Forest City Enterprises, Inc., 776 F. 2d 185, 191 (CA7 1985) (\u201cUnless the firms have the power to raise price by curtailing output, their agreement is unlikely to harm consumers, and it makes sense to understand their cooperation as benign or beneficial\u201d).\n\nAt the other end, some agreements among competitors so obviously threaten to reduce output and raise prices that they might be condemned as unlawful per se or rejected after only a quick look. See Dagher, 547 U. S., at 7, n. 3; California Dental Assn. v. FTC, 526 U. S. 756, 770 (1999). Recognizing the inherent limits on a court\u2019s ability to master an entire industry\u2014and aware that there are often hard-to-see efficiencies attendant to complex business arrangements\u2014we take special care not to deploy these condemnatory tools until we have amassed \u201cconsiderable experience with the type of restraint at issue\u201d and \u201ccan predict with confidence that it would be invalidated in all or almost all instances.\u201d Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U. S. 877, 886\u2013887 (2007); Easterbrook, On Identifying Exclusionary Conduct, 61 Notre Dame L. Rev. 972, 975 (1986) (noting that it can take \u201ceconomists years, sometimes decades, to understand why certain business practices work [and] determine whether they work because of increased efficiency or exclusion\u201d); see also infra, at 26\u201327 (further reasons for caution).\n\nNone of this helps the NCAA. The NCAA accepts that its members collectively enjoy monopsony power in the market for student-athlete services, such that its restraints can (and in fact do) harm competition. See D. Ct. Op., at 1067. Unlike customers who would look elsewhere when a small van company raises its prices above market levels, the district court found (and the NCAA does not here contest) that student-athletes have nowhere else to sell their labor. Even if the NCAA is a joint venture, then, it is hardly of the sort that would warrant quick-look approval for all its myriad rules and restrictions.\n\nNor does the NCAA\u2019s status as a particular type of venture categorically exempt its restraints from ordinary rule of reason review. We do not doubt that some degree of coordination between competitors within sports leagues can be procompetitive. Without some agreement among rivals\u2014on things like how many players may be on the field or the time allotted for play\u2014the very competitions that consumers value would not be possible. See Board of Regents, 468 U. S., at 101 (quoting R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 278 (1978)). Accordingly, even a sports league with market power might see some agreements among its members win antitrust approval in the \u201c \u2018twinkling of an eye.\u2019 \u201d American Needle, 560 U. S., at 203.\n\nBut this insight does not always apply. That some restraints are necessary to create or maintain a league sport does not mean all \u201caspects of elaborate interleague cooperation are.\u201d Id., at 199, n. 7. While a quick look will often be enough to approve the restraints \u201cnecessary to produce a game,\u201d ibid., a fuller review may be appropriate for others. See, e.g., Chicago Professional Sports Ltd. Partnership v. National Basketball Assn., 95 F. 3d 593, 600 (CA7 1996) (\u201cJust as the ability of McDonald\u2019s franchises to coordinate the release of a new hamburger does not imply their ability to agree on wages for counter workers, so the ability of sports teams to agree on a TV contract need not imply an ability to set wages for players\u201d).\n\nThe NCAA\u2019s rules fixing wages for student-athletes fall on the far side of this line. Nobody questions that Division I basketball and FBS football can proceed (and have proceeded) without the education-related compensation restrictions the district court enjoined; the games go on. Instead, the parties dispute whether and to what extent those restrictions in the NCAA\u2019s labor market yield benefits in its consumer market that can be attained using substantially less restrictive means. That dispute presents complex questions requiring more than a blink to answer.\n\nB\n\nEven if background antitrust principles counsel in favor of the rule of reason, the NCAA replies that a particular precedent ties our hands. The NCAA directs our attention to Board of Regents, where this Court considered the league\u2019s rules restricting the ability of its member schools to televise football games. 468 U. S., at 94. On the NCAA\u2019s reading, that decision expressly approved its limits on student-athlete compensation\u2014and this approval forecloses any meaningful review of those limits today.\n\nWe see things differently. Board of Regents explained that the league\u2019s television rules amounted to \u201c[h]orizontal price fixing and output limitation[s]\u201d of the sort that are \u201cordinarily condemned\u201d as \u201c \u2018illegal per se.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 100. The Court declined to declare the NCAA\u2019s restraints per se unlawful only because they arose in \u201can industry\u201d in which some \u201chorizontal restraints on competition are essential if the product is to be available at all.\u201d Id., at 101\u2013102. Our analysis today is fully consistent with all of this. Indeed, if any daylight exists it is only in the NCAA\u2019s favor. While Board of Regents did not condemn the NCAA\u2019s broadcasting restraints as per se unlawful, it invoked abbreviated antitrust review as a path to condemnation, not salvation. Id., at 109, n. 39. If a quick look was thought sufficient before rejecting the NCAA\u2019s procompetitive rationales in that case, it is hard to see how the NCAA might object to a court providing a more cautious form of review before reaching a similar judgment here.\n\nTo be sure, the NCAA isn\u2019t without a reply. It notes that, in the course of reaching its judgment about television marketing restrictions, the Board of Regents Court commented on student-athlete compensation restrictions. Most particularly, the NCAA highlights this passage:\n\n\u201cThe NCAA plays a critical role in the maintenance of a revered tradition of amateurism in college sports. There can be no question but that it needs ample latitude to play that role, or that the preservation of the student-athlete in higher education adds richness and diversity to intercollegiate athletics and is entirely consistent with the goals of the Sherman Act.\u201d Id., at 120.\n\nSee also id., at 101, 102 (the NCAA \u201cseeks to market a particular brand of football\u201d in which \u201cathletes must not be paid, must be required to attend class, and the like\u201d). On the NCAA\u2019s telling, these observations foreclose any rule of reason review in this suit.\n\nOnce more, we cannot agree. Board of Regents may suggest that courts should take care when assessing the NCAA\u2019s restraints on student-athlete compensation, sensitive to their procompetitive possibilities. But these remarks do not suggest that courts must reflexively reject all challenges to the NCAA\u2019s compensation restrictions. Student-athlete compensation rules were not even at issue in Board of Regents. And the Court made clear it was only assuming the reasonableness of the NCAA\u2019s restrictions: \u201cIt is reasonable to assume that most of the regulatory controls of the NCAA are justifiable means of fostering competition among amateur athletic teams and are therefore procompetitive . . . .\u201d Id., at 117 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the Court simply did not have occasion to declare\u2014nor did it declare\u2014the NCAA\u2019s compensation restrictions procompetitive both in 1984 and forevermore.\n\nOur confidence on this score is fortified by still another factor. Whether an antitrust violation exists necessarily depends on a careful analysis of market realities. See, e.g., American Express Co., 585 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 10\u201312); 2B Areeda & Hovenkamp \u00b6500, p. 107 (2014). If those market realities change, so may the legal analysis.\n\nWhen it comes to college sports, there can be little doubt that the market realities have changed significantly since 1984. Since then, the NCAA has dramatically increased the amounts and kinds of benefits schools may provide to student-athletes. For example, it has allowed the conferences flexibility to set new and higher limits on athletic scholarships. D. Ct. Op., at 1064. It has increased the size of permissible benefits \u201cincidental to athletics participation.\u201d Id., at 1066. And it has developed the Student Assistance Fund and the Academic Enhancement Fund, which in 2018 alone provided over $100 million to student-athletes. Id., at 1072. Nor is that all that has changed. In 1985, Division I football and basketball raised approximately $922 million and $41 million respectively. Brief for Former NCAA Executives as Amici Curiae 7. By 2016, NCAA Division I schools raised more than $13.5 billion. Ibid. From 1982 to 1984, CBS paid $16 million per year to televise the March Madness Division I men\u2019s basketball tournament. Ibid. In 2016, those annual television rights brought in closer to $1.1 billion. D. Ct. Op., at 1077, n. 20.\n\nGiven the sensitivity of antitrust analysis to market realities\u2014and how much has changed in this market\u2014we think it would be particularly unwise to treat an aside in Board of Regents as more than that. This Court may be \u201cinfallible only because we are final,\u201d Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 540 (1953) (Jackson, J., concurring in result), but those sorts of stray comments are neither.\n\nC\n\nThe NCAA submits that a rule of reason analysis is inappropriate for still another reason\u2014because the NCAA and its member schools are not \u201ccommercial enterprises\u201d and instead oversee intercollegiate athletics \u201cas an integral part of the undergraduate experience.\u201d Brief for Petitioner in No. 20\u2013512, at 31. The NCAA represents that it seeks to \u201cmaintain amateurism in college sports as part of serving [the] societally important non-commercial objective\u201d of \u201chigher education.\u201d Id., at 3.\n\nHere again, however, there may be less of a dispute than meets the eye. The NCAA does not contest that its restraints affect interstate trade and commerce and are thus subject to the Sherman Act. See D. Ct. Op., at 1066. The NCAA acknowledges that this Court already analyzed (and struck down) some of its restraints as anticompetitive in Board of Regents. And it admits, as it must, that the Court did all this only after observing that the Sherman Act had already been applied to other nonprofit organizations\u2014and that \u201cthe economic significance of the NCAA\u2019s nonprofit character is questionable at best\u201d given that \u201cthe NCAA and its member institutions are in fact organized to maximize revenues.\u201d 468 U. S., at 100\u2013101, n. 22. Nor, on the other side of the equation, does anyone contest that the status of the NCAA\u2019s members as schools and the status of student-athletes as students may be relevant in assessing consumer demand as part of a rule of reason review.\n\nWith this much agreed it is unclear exactly what the NCAA seeks. To the extent it means to propose a sort of judicially ordained immunity from the terms of the Sherman Act for its restraints of trade\u2014that we should overlook its restrictions because they happen to fall at the intersection of higher education, sports, and money\u2014we cannot agree. This Court has regularly refused materially identical requests from litigants seeking special dispensation from the Sherman Act on the ground that their restraints of trade serve uniquely important social objectives beyond enhancing competition.\n\nTake two examples. In National Soc. of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U. S. 679 (1978), a trade association argued that price competition between engineers competing for building projects had to be restrained to ensure quality work and protect public safety. Id., at 679\u2013680. This Court rejected that appeal as \u201cnothing less than a frontal assault on the basic policy of the Sherman Act.\u201d Id., at 695. The \u201cstatutory policy\u201d of the Act is one of competition and it \u201cprecludes inquiry into the question whether competition is good or bad.\u201d Ibid. In FTC v. Superior Court Trial Lawyers Assn., 493 U. S. 411 (1990), criminal defense lawyers agreed among themselves to refuse court appointments until the government increased their compensation. Id., at 414. And once more the Court refused to consider whether this restraint of trade served some social good more important than competition: \u201cThe social justifications proffered for respondents\u2019 restraint of trade . . . do not make it any less unlawful.\u201d Id., at 424.\n\nTo be sure, this Court once dallied with something that looks a bit like an antitrust exemption for professional baseball. In Federal Baseball Club of Baltimore, Inc. v. National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, 259 U. S. 200 (1922), the Court reasoned that \u201cexhibitions\u201d of \u201cbase ball\u201d did not implicate the Sherman Act because they did not involve interstate trade or commerce\u2014even though teams regularly crossed state lines (as they do today) to make money and enhance their commercial success. Id., at 208\u2013209. But this Court has refused to extend Federal Baseball\u2019s reasoning to other sports leagues\u2014and has even acknowledged criticisms of the decision as \u201c \u2018unrealistic\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018inconsistent\u2019 \u201d and \u201caberration[al].\u201d Flood v. Kuhn, 407 U. S. 258, 282 (1972) (quoting Radovich v. National Football League, 352 U. S. 445, 452 (1957)); see also Brief for Advocates for Minor Leaguers as Amicus Curiae 5, n. 3 (gathering criticisms). Indeed, as we have seen, this Court has already recognized that the NCAA itself is subject to the Sherman Act.\n\nThe \u201corderly way\u201d to temper that Act\u2019s policy of competition is \u201cby legislation and not by court decision.\u201d Flood, 407 U. S., at 279. The NCAA is free to argue that, \u201cbecause of the special characteristics of [its] particular industry,\u201d it should be exempt from the usual operation of the antitrust laws\u2014but that appeal is \u201cproperly addressed to Congress.\u201d National Soc. of Professional Engineers, 435 U. S., at 689. Nor has Congress been insensitive to such requests. It has modified the antitrust laws for certain industries in the past, and it may do so again in the future. See, e.g., 7 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7291\u2013292 (agricultural cooperatives); 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71011\u20131013 (insurance); 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71801\u20131804 (newspaper joint operating agreements). But until Congress says otherwise, the only law it has asked us to enforce is the Sherman Act, and that law is predicated on one assumption alone\u2014\u201ccompetition is the best method of allocating resources\u201d in the Nation\u2019s economy. National Soc. of Professional Engineers, 435 U. S., at 695.\n\nIII\n\nA\n\nWhile the NCAA devotes most of its energy to resisting the rule of reason in its usual form, the league lodges some objections to the district court\u2019s application of it as well.\n\nWhen describing the rule of reason, this Court has sometimes spoken of \u201ca three-step, burden-shifting framework\u201d as a means for \u201c \u2018distinguish[ing] between restraints with anticompetitive effect that are harmful to the consumer and restraints stimulating competition that are in the consumer\u2019s best interest.\u2019 \u201d American Express Co., 585 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9). As we have described it, \u201cthe plaintiff has the initial burden to prove that the challenged restraint has a substantial anticompetitive effect.\u201d Ibid. Should the plaintiff carry that burden, the burden then \u201cshifts to the defendant to show a procompetitive rationale for the restraint.\u201d Ibid. If the defendant can make that showing, \u201cthe burden shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the procompetitive efficiencies could be reasonably achieved through less anticompetitive means.\u201d Id., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 9\u201310).\n\nThese three steps do not represent a rote checklist, nor may they be employed as an inflexible substitute for careful analysis. As we have seen, what is required to assess whether a challenged restraint harms competition can vary depending on the circumstances. See supra, at 15\u201319. The whole point of the rule of reason is to furnish \u201can enquiry meet for the case, looking to the circumstances, details, and logic of a restraint\u201d to ensure that it unduly harms competition before a court declares it unlawful. California Dental, 526 U. S., at 781; see also, e.g., Leegin Creative, 551 U. S., at 885 (\u201c \u2018[T]he factfinder weighs all of the circumstances of a case in deciding whether a restrictive practice should be prohibited as imposing an unreasonable restraint on competition\u2019 \u201d); Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U. S. 752, 768 (1984); 7 Areeda & Hovenkamp \u00b61507a, at 442\u2013444 (slightly different \u201cdecisional model\u201d using sequential questions).\n\nIn the proceedings below, the district court followed circuit precedent to apply a multistep framework closely akin to American Express\u2019s. As its first step, the district court required the student-athletes to show that \u201cthe challenged restraints produce significant anticompetitive effects in the relevant market.\u201d D. Ct. Op., at 1067. This was no slight burden. According to one amicus, courts have disposed of nearly all rule of reason cases in the last 45 years on the ground that the plaintiff failed to show a substantial anticompetitive effect. Brief for 65 Professors of Law, Business, Economics, and Sports Management as Amici Curiae 21, n. 9 (\u201cSince 1977, courts decided 90% (809 of 897) on this ground\u201d). This suit proved different. As we have seen, based on a voluminous record, the district court held that the student-athletes had shown the NCAA enjoys the power to set wages in the market for student-athletes\u2019 labor\u2014and that the NCAA has exercised that power in ways that have produced significant anticompetitive effects. See D. Ct. Op., at 1067. Perhaps even more notably, the NCAA \u201cdid not meaningfully dispute\u201d this conclusion. Ibid.\n\nUnlike so many cases, then, the district court proceeded to the second step, asking whether the NCAA could muster a procompetitive rationale for its restraints. Id., at 1070. This is where the NCAA claims error first crept in. On its account, the district court examined the challenged rules at different levels of generality. At the first step of its inquiry, the court asked whether the NCAA\u2019s entire package of compensation restrictions has substantial anticompetitive effects collectively. Yet, at the second step, the NCAA says the district court required it to show that each of its distinct rules limiting student-athlete compensation has procompetitive benefits individually. The NCAA says this mismatch had the result of effectively\u2014and erroneously\u2014requiring it to prove that each rule is the least restrictive means of achieving the procompetitive purpose of differentiating college sports and preserving demand for them.\n\nWe agree with the NCAA\u2019s premise that antitrust law does not require businesses to use anything like the least restrictive means of achieving legitimate business purposes. To the contrary, courts should not second-guess \u201cdegrees of reasonable necessity\u201d so that \u201cthe lawfulness of conduct turn[s] upon judgments of degrees of efficiency.\u201d Rothery Storage, 792 F. 2d, at 227; Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U. S. 36, 58, n. 29 (1977). That would be a recipe for disaster, for a \u201cskilled lawyer\u201d will \u201chave little difficulty imagining possible less restrictive alternatives to most joint arrangements.\u201d 11 Areeda & Hovenkamp \u00b61913b, p. 398 (2018). And judicial acceptance of such imaginings would risk interfering \u201cwith the legitimate objectives at issue\u201d without \u201cadding that much to competition.\u201d 7 id., \u00b61505b, at 435\u2013436.\n\nEven worse, \u201c[r]ules that seek to embody every economic complexity and qualification may well, through the vagaries of administration, prove counter-productive, undercutting the very economic ends they seek to serve.\u201d Barry Wright Corp. v. ITT Grinnell Corp., 724 F. 2d 227, 234 (CA1 1983) (Breyer, J.). After all, even \u201c[u]nder the best of circumstances,\u201d applying the antitrust laws \u201c \u2018can be difficult\u2019 \u201d\u2014and mistaken condemnations of legitimate business arrangements \u201c \u2018are especially costly, because they chill the very\u2019 \u201d procompetitive conduct \u201c \u2018the antitrust laws are designed to protect.\u2019 \u201d Verizon Communications Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, 540 U. S. 398, 414 (2004). Indeed, static judicial decrees in ever-evolving markets may themselves facilitate collusion or frustrate entry and competition. Ibid. To know that the Sherman Act prohibits only unreasonable restraints of trade is thus to know that attempts to \u201c \u2018[m]ete[r]\u2019 small deviations is not an appropriate antitrust function.\u201d Hovenkamp, Antitrust Balancing, 12 N. Y. U. J. L. & Bus. 369, 377 (2016).\n\nWhile we agree with the NCAA\u2019s legal premise, we cannot say the same for its factual one. Yes, at the first step of its inquiry, the district court held that the student-athletes had met their burden of showing the NCAA\u2019s restraints collectively bear an anticompetitive effect. And, given that, yes, at step two the NCAA had to show only that those same rules collectively yield a procompetitive benefit. The trouble for the NCAA, though, is not the level of generality. It is the fact that the district court found unpersuasive much of its proffered evidence. See D. Ct. Op., at 1070\u20131076, 1080\u20131083. Recall that the court found the NCAA failed \u201cto establish that the challenged compensation rules . . . have any direct connection to consumer demand.\u201d Id., at 1070.\n\nTo be sure, there is a wrinkle here. While finding the NCAA had failed to establish that its rules collectively sustain consumer demand, the court did find that \u201csome\u201d of those rules \u201cmay\u201d have procompetitive effects \u201cto the extent\u201d they prohibit compensation \u201cunrelated to education, akin to salaries seen in professional sports leagues.\u201d Id., at 1082\u20131083. The court then proceeded to what corresponds to the third step of the American Express framework, where it required the student-athletes \u201cto show that there are substantially less restrictive alternative rules that would achieve the same procompetitive effect as the challenged set of rules.\u201d D. Ct. Op., at 1104. And there, of course, the district court held that the student-athletes partially succeeded\u2014they were able to show that the NCAA could achieve the procompetitive benefits it had established with substantially less restrictive restraints on education-related benefits.\n\nEven acknowledging this wrinkle, we see nothing about the district court\u2019s analysis that offends the legal principles the NCAA invokes. The court\u2019s judgment ultimately turned on the key question at the third step: whether the student-athletes could prove that \u201csubstantially less restrictive alternative rules\u201d existed to achieve the same procompetitive benefits the NCAA had proven at the second step. Ibid. Of course, deficiencies in the NCAA\u2019s proof of procompetitive benefits at the second step influenced the analysis at the third. But that is only because, however framed and at whichever step, anticompetitive restraints of trade may wind up flunking the rule of reason to the extent the evidence shows that substantially less restrictive means exist to achieve any proven procompetitive benefits. See, e.g., 7 Areeda & Hovenkamp \u00b61505, p. 428 (\u201cTo be sure, these two questions can be collapsed into one,\u201d since a \u201clegitimate objective that is not promoted by the challenged restraint can be equally served by simply abandoning the restraint, which is surely a less restrictive alternative\u201d).\n\nSimply put, the district court nowhere\u2014expressly or effectively\u2014required the NCAA to show that its rules constituted the least restrictive means of preserving consumer demand. Rather, it was only after finding the NCAA\u2019s restraints \u201c \u2018patently and inexplicably stricter than is necessary\u2019 \u201d to achieve the procompetitive benefits the league had demonstrated that the district court proceeded to declare a violation of the Sherman Act. D. Ct. Op., at 1104. That demanding standard hardly presages a future filled with judicial micromanagement of legitimate business decisions.\n\nB\n\nIn a related critique, the NCAA contends the district court \u201cimpermissibly redefined\u201d its \u201cproduct\u201d by rejecting its views about what amateurism requires and replacing them with its preferred conception. Brief for Petitioner in No. 20\u2013512, at 35\u201336.\n\nThis argument, however, misapprehends the way a defendant\u2019s procompetitive business justification relates to the antitrust laws. Firms deserve substantial latitude to fashion agreements that serve legitimate business interests\u2014agreements that may include efforts aimed at introducing a new product into the marketplace. Supra, at 15\u201319. But none of that means a party can relabel a restraint as a product feature and declare it \u201cimmune from \u00a71 scrutiny.\u201d American Needle, 560 U. S., at 199, n. 7. In this suit, as in any, the district court had to determine whether the defendants\u2019 agreements harmed competition and whether any procompetitive benefits associated with their restraints could be achieved by \u201csubstantially less restrictive alternative\u201d means. D. Ct. Op., at 1104.\n\nThe NCAA\u2019s argument not only misapprehends the inquiry, it would require us to overturn the district court\u2019s factual findings. While the NCAA asks us to defer to its conception of amateurism, the district court found that the NCAA had not adopted any consistent definition. Id., at 1070. Instead, the court found, the NCAA\u2019s rules and restrictions on compensation have shifted markedly over time. Id., at 1071\u20131074. The court found, too, that the NCAA adopted these restrictions without any reference to \u201cconsiderations of consumer demand,\u201d id., at 1100, and that some were \u201cnot necessary to preserve consumer demand,\u201d id., at 1075, 1080, 1104. None of this is product redesign; it is a straightforward application of the rule of reason.\n\nC\n\nFinally, the NCAA attacks as \u201cindefensible\u201d the lower courts\u2019 holding that substantially less restrictive alternatives exist capable of delivering the same procompetitive benefits as its current rules. Brief for Petitioner in No. 20\u2013512, at 46. The NCAA claims, too, that the district court\u2019s injunction threatens to \u201cmicromanage\u201d its business. Id., at 50.\n\nOnce more, we broadly agree with the legal principles the NCAA invokes. As we have discussed, antitrust courts must give wide berth to business judgments before finding liability. See supra, at 15\u201319. Similar considerations apply when it comes to the remedy. Judges must be sensitive to the possibility that the \u201ccontinuing supervision of a highly detailed decree\u201d could wind up impairing rather than enhancing competition. Trinko, 540 U. S., at 415. Costs associated with ensuring compliance with judicial decrees may exceed efficiencies gained; the decrees themselves may unintentionally suppress procompetitive innovation and even facilitate collusion. See supra, at 26\u201327. Judges must be wary, too, of the temptation to specify \u201cthe proper price, quantity, and other terms of dealing\u201d\u2014cognizant that they are neither economic nor industry experts. Trinko, 540 U. S., at 408. Judges must be open to reconsideration and modification of decrees in light of changing market reali ties, for \u201cwhat we see may vary over time.\u201d California Dental, 526 U. S., at 781. And throughout courts must have a healthy respect for the practical limits of judicial administration: \u201cAn antitrust court is unlikely to be an effective day-to-day enforcer\u201d of a detailed decree, able to keep pace with changing market dynamics alongside a busy docket. Trinko, 540 U. S., at 415. Nor should any court \u201c \u2018impose a duty . . . that it cannot explain or adequately and reasonably supervise.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. In short, judges make for poor \u201ccentral planners\u201d and should never aspire to the role. Id., at 408.\n\nOnce again, though, we think the district court honored these principles. The court enjoined only restraints on education-related benefits\u2014such as those limiting scholarships for graduate school, payments for tutoring, and the like. The court did so, moreover, only after finding that relaxing these restrictions would not blur the distinction between college and professional sports and thus impair demand\u2014and only after finding that this course represented a significantly (not marginally) less restrictive means of achieving the same procompetitive benefits as the NCAA\u2019s current rules. D. Ct. Op., at 1104\u20131105.\n\nEven with respect to education-related benefits, the district court extended the NCAA considerable leeway. As we have seen, the court provided that the NCAA could develop its own definition of benefits that relate to education and seek modification of the court\u2019s injunction to reflect that definition. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 20\u2013512, at 168a, \u00b64. The court explained that the NCAA and its members could agree on rules regulating how conferences and schools go about providing these education-related benefits. Ibid. The court said that the NCAA and its members could continue fixing education-related cash awards, too\u2014so long as those \u201climits are never lower than the limit\u201d on awards for athletic performance. D. Ct. Op., at 1104; App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 20\u2013512, at 168a\u2013169a, \u00b65. And the court emphasized that its injunction applies only to the NCAA and multiconference agreements; individual conferences remain free to reimpose every single enjoined restraint tomorrow\u2014or more restrictive ones still. Id., at 169a\u2013170a, \u00b6\u00b66\u20137.\n\nIn the end, it turns out that the NCAA\u2019s complaints really boil down to three principal objections.\n\nFirst, the NCAA worries about the district court\u2019s inclusion of paid posteligibility internships among the education-related benefits it approved. The NCAA fears that schools will use internships as a way of circumventing limits on payments that student-athletes may receive for athletic performance. The NCAA even imagines that boosters might promise posteligibility internships \u201cat a sneaker company or auto dealership\u201d with extravagant salaries as a \u201cthinly disguised vehicle\u201d for paying professional-level salaries. Brief for Petitioner in No. 20\u2013512, at 37\u201338.\n\nThis argument rests on an overly broad reading of the injunction. The district court enjoined only restrictions on education-related compensation or benefits \u201cthat may be made available from conferences or schools.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 20\u2013512, at 167a, \u00b61 (emphasis added). Accordingly, as the student-athletes concede, the injunction \u201cdoes not stop the NCAA from continuing to prohibit compensation from\u201d sneaker companies, auto dealerships, boosters, \u201cor anyone else.\u201d Brief for Respondents 47\u201348; see also Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 33. The NCAA itself seems to understand this much. Following the district court\u2019s injunction, the organization adopted new regulations specifying that only \u201ca conference or institution\u201d may fund post-eligibility internships. See Decl. of M. Boyer in No. 4:14\u2013md\u201302541, ECF Doc. 1302\u20132, p. 6 (ND Cal., Sept. 22, 2020) (NCAA Bylaw 16.3.4(d)).\n\nEven when it comes to internships offered by conferences and schools, the district court left the NCAA considerable flexibility. The court refused to enjoin NCAA rules prohibiting its members from providing compensation or benefits unrelated to legitimate educational activities\u2014thus leaving the league room to police phony internships. As we\u2019ve observed, the district court also allowed the NCAA to propose (and enforce) rules defining what benefits do and do not relate to education. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 20\u2013512, at 168a, \u00b64. Accordingly, the NCAA may seek whatever limits on paid internships it thinks appropriate. And, again, the court stressed that individual conferences may restrict internships however they wish. Id., at 169a, \u00b66. All these features underscore the modesty of the current decree.\n\nSecond, the NCAA attacks the district court\u2019s ruling that it may fix the aggregate limit on awards schools may give for \u201cacademic or graduation\u201d achievement no lower than its aggregate limit on parallel athletic awards (currently $5,980 per year). Id., at 168a\u2013169a, \u00b65; D. Ct. Op., at 1104. This, the NCAA asserts, \u201cis the very definition of a professional salary.\u201d Brief for Petitioner in No. 20\u2013512, at 48. The NCAA also represents that \u201c[m]ost\u201d of its currently permissible athletic awards are \u201cfor genuine individual or team achievement\u201d and that \u201c[m]ost . . . are received by only a few student-athletes each year.\u201d Ibid. Meanwhile, the NCAA says, the district court\u2019s decree would allow a school to pay players thousands of dollars each year for minimal achievements like maintaining a passing GPA. Ibid.\n\nThe basis for this critique is unclear. The NCAA does not believe that the athletic awards it presently allows are tantamount to a professional salary. And this portion of the injunction sprang directly from the district court\u2019s finding that the cap on athletic participation awards \u201cis an amount that has been shown not to decrease consumer demand.\u201d D. Ct. Op., at 1088. Indeed, there was no evidence before the district court suggesting that corresponding academic awards would impair consumer interest in any way. Again, too, the district court\u2019s injunction affords the NCAA leeway. It leaves the NCAA free to reduce its athletic awards. And it does not ordain what criteria schools must use for their academic and graduation awards. So, once more, if the NCAA believes certain criteria are needed to ensure that academic awards are legitimately related to education, it is presently free to propose such rules\u2014and individual conferences may adopt even stricter ones.\n\nThird, the NCAA contends that allowing schools to provide in-kind educational benefits will pose a problem. This relief focuses on allowing schools to offer scholarships for \u201cgraduate degrees\u201d or \u201cvocational school\u201d and to pay for things like \u201ccomputers\u201d and \u201ctutoring.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 20\u2013512, at 167a\u2013168a, \u00b62. But the NCAA fears schools might exploit this authority to give student-athletes \u201c \u2018luxury cars\u2019 \u201d \u201cto get to class\u201d and \u201cother unnecessary or inordinately valuable items\u201d only \u201cnominally\u201d related to education. Brief for Petitioner in No. 20\u2013512, at 48\u201349.\n\nAgain, however, this over-reads the injunction in ways we have seen and need not belabor. Under the current decree, the NCAA is free to forbid in-kind benefits unrelated to a student\u2019s actual education; nothing stops it from enforcing a \u201cno Lamborghini\u201d rule. And, again, the district court invited the NCAA to specify and later enforce rules delineating which benefits it considers legitimately related to education. To the extent the NCAA believes meaningful ambiguity really exists about the scope of its authority\u2014regarding internships, academic awards, in-kind benefits, or anything else\u2014it has been free to seek clarification from the district court since the court issued its injunction three years ago. The NCAA remains free to do so today. To date, the NCAA has sought clarification only once\u2014about the precise amount at which it can cap academic awards\u2014and the question was quickly resolved. Before conjuring hypothetical concerns in this Court, we believe it best for the NCAA to present any practically important question it has in district court first.\n\nWhen it comes to fashioning an antitrust remedy, we acknowledge that caution is key. Judges must resist the temptation to require that enterprises employ the least restrictive means of achieving their legitimate business objectives. Judges must be mindful, too, of their limitations\u2014as generalists, as lawyers, and as outsiders trying to understand intricate business relationships. Judges must remain aware that markets are often more effective than the heavy hand of judicial power when it comes to enhancing consumer welfare. And judges must be open to clarifying and reconsidering their decrees in light of changing market realities. Courts reviewing complex business arrangements should, in other words, be wary about invitations to \u201cset sail on a sea of doubt.\u201d United States v. Addyston Pipe & Steel Co., 85 F. 271, 284 (CA6 1898) (Taft, J.). But we do not believe the district court fell prey to that temptation. Its judgment does not float on a sea of doubt but stands on firm ground\u2014an exhaustive factual record, a thoughtful legal analysis consistent with established antitrust principles, and a healthy dose of judicial humility.\n\n*\n\nSome will think the district court did not go far enough. By permitting colleges and universities to offer enhanced education-related benefits, its decision may encourage scholastic achievement and allow student-athletes a measure of compensation more consistent with the value they bring to their schools. Still, some will see this as a poor substitute for fuller relief. At the same time, others will think the district court went too far by undervaluing the social benefits associated with amateur athletics. For our part, though, we can only agree with the Ninth Circuit: \u201c \u2018The national debate about amateurism in college sports is important. But our task as appellate judges is not to resolve it. Nor could we. Our task is simply to review the district court judgment through the appropriate lens of antitrust law.\u2019 \u201d 958 F. 3d, at 1265. That review persuades us the district court acted within the law\u2019s bounds.\n\nThe judgment is\n\nAffirmed."}, {"url": "https://law.emory.edu/news-and-events/releases/2021/08/scotus-yoo-ncaa-v-alston.html", "page_content": "The Supreme Court of the United States recently rendered a landmark decision in the antitrust case National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Alston. On June 21, the court ruled on the legality of the National Collegiate Athletic Association\u2019s restrictions on student-athlete compensation and benefits. Current and former student-athletes who played in men\u2019s Division I Football Bowl Subdivision football and men\u2019s and women\u2019s Division I basketball (collectively, \u201cstudent-athletes\u201d) filed an antitrust class action against the NCAA and eleven Division I conferences (collectively, \u201cNCAA\u201d), alleging that the NCAA implemented anticompetitive bylaws unreasonably limiting the compensation and benefits that student-athletes might receive in exchange for their athletic participation. The court unanimously found the NCAA\u2019s compensation rules violated the Sherman Act when they restricted non-cash education-related benefits such as post-eligibility undergraduate or graduate scholarships or tutoring, study-abroad expenses, and paid post-eligibility internships.\n\nThe court upheld the district court\u2019s finding based on the rule of reason analysis that the NCAA and its member schools collectively enjoyed monopsony power in the relevant market as defined as the market for student-athlete services in Division I basketball and FBS football and exercised such power to restrain compensation without risking their market dominance. The district court found that there were no viable substitutes for the Division I market that student-athletes could switch to in response to decreases in compensation.\n\nThe NCAA\u2019s compensation framework had significant anticompetitive effects in the relevant market by restricting competition between or among the member institutions for offering better compensation in recruiting student-athletes. Reduced compensation caused depressed athletics participation so that the price and quantity of student-athlete labor were suppressed below competitive levels. The court rejected the NCAA\u2019s defense arguing that special consideration should be afforded to the association as a joint venture that inevitably necessitates collaboration among members to \u201coffer consumers the benefit of intercollegiate athletic competition.\u201d The court admitted that \u201csome degree of coordination between competitors within sports leagues can be procompetitive.\u201d But it found that joint venture restrictions, especially with monopoly power, were appropriately subject to antitrust scrutiny under \u201cthe ordinary rule of reason\u2019s fact-specific assessment of their effect on competition.\u201d\n\nWith special emphasis, the court made it clear that the rule of reason analysis was structured with flexibility depending on the circumstances. The court highlighted that the rule of reason review purported to \u201cfurnish an enquiry meet for the case, looking to the circumstances, details, and logic of a restraint\u201d to determine that the challenged practices harmed competition. The burden-shifting framework of the rule of reason poses the complex question as to whether the procompetitive benefits outweigh the anticompetitive harms. The court affirmed the district court\u2019s finding that the procompetitive benefits the NCAA had established with compensation restraints in the labor market could have been achieved by \u201csubstantially less restrictive alternative means.\u201d\n\nIt is noteworthy that the court had due regard to the preservation of amateurism as contended by the NCAA to show its compensation limits are procompetitive. Relying on long-standing controversial language in NCAA v. Board of Regents of University of Oklahoma (1984), the NCAA contended that the challenged rules helped preserve amateurism that drives consumer demand for college sports. The court in Board of Regents noted that the NCAA plays a critical role in maintaining \u201ca revered tradition of amateurism in college sports;\u201d that it has \u201cample latitude to play that role;\u201d and that the preservation of amateurism is \u201centirely consistent with the goals of the Sherman Act.\u201d The court in Alston maintained due balance in interpreting this language. The court construed its earlier wording as neither binding nor dispositive and thereby refused to grant wide antitrust immunity. The court further understood this language as suggesting that \u201ccourts should take care when assessing the NCAA\u2019s restraints on student-athlete compensation, sensitive to their procompetitive possibilities,\u201d but does not imply that \u201ccourts must reflexively reject all challenges to the NCAA\u2019s compensation restrictions.\u201d As such, the court struck the sensitive balance in considering the admissibility of amateurism as a viable defense by allowing the NCAA having the shifted burden of proof to argue that the preservation of amateurism has procompetitive effects.\n\nAlston has particular significance in that it provided legal clarification as to when the reshaped relationship between institutions and student-athletes ensures legitimacy in the college-sport labor market from an antirust perspective. Alston unprecedently lifted the limits on education-related compensation/in-kind benefits for student athletes and further attenuated the NCAA\u2019s control over student-athlete compensation. The significance of Alston is, nevertheless, not confined to its contribution to the accumulation of antitrust jurisprudence. Alston paved the way for re-establishment of the delicate relationship between universities or colleges and student-athletes from business transactional perspectives. It revealed the evolving landscape of college athletics in terms of fair compensation and treatment. Alston recognized that the NCAA relied heavily on amateurism to unduly exploit student-athlete labor for free or for a lower price in college sports. Invoking amateurism to the extreme creates controversy by oversimplifying and solidifying the relationship between institutions and student-athletes rather than aligning their business interests on an equal footing as in the competitive market. The court implied that amateurism acted to eliminate market dynamics and reduce competition in the student-athlete labor market.\n\nAlston, however, did not answer the question of whether and where the preservation of amateurism might be a successful procompetitive rationale on the merits. The court left room for more flexible interpretation by stating that courts dealing with complex business arrangements should be amenable to \u201cclarifying and reconsidering their decrees in light of changing market realities\u201d because markets tend to be \u201cmore effective than the heavy hand of judicial power when it comes to enhancing consumer welfare.\u201d The court also left room for future discourse on how to define amateurism as it stated that \u201cthe national debate about amateurism in college sports is important.\u201d The elimination of conceptual uncertainty and ambiguity will be necessary to better inform the antitrust analysis of practices in college sports demanding free labor in the name of amateurism.\n\n\u2014Kwanghyuk David Yoo\n\nlaw librarian, adjunct professor of law"}, {"url": "https://meridian.allenpress.com/jat/article/56/7/750/467943/Epidemiology-of-Injuries-in-National-Collegiate", "page_content": "Since the 1980s, the NCAA has acquired injury data related to participation in collegiate athletics through sports injury surveillance. 7 Continued monitoring of athletic injury is currently accomplished electronically via the NCAA Injury Surveillance Program (ISP). 7 , 8 Prior researchers using data from the NCAA ISP have identified the overall injury rate in women's lacrosse as approximately 4 injuries per 1000 athlete exposures (AEs) 3 , 5 ; however, until recently, nontime loss (NTL) injuries were not included in the analyses. In addition, the Division III injury rate has been noted to be higher than the Division I injury rate, and the rate of injury during competitions has been reported as more than twice as high as the practice injury rate. 5 Prior investigators have also indicated that the hip/thigh/upper leg, ankle, and knee were among the most commonly injured body parts, and ligament sprains, muscle/tendon strains, and concussions were among the most common diagnoses in NCAA women's lacrosse. 5 Further, the notable burden of head/face injuries has sparked discussion surrounding the role of protective equipment in the sport. 5 , 9 Given the continued increase in NCAA women's lacrosse participation, and the emerging interest in the topic of protective equipment in women's lacrosse (eg, addition of a helmet), 9 it is critical to update the epidemiologic evidence surrounding injury incidence in this population. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to summarize the descriptive epidemiology of women's lacrosse injuries in a sample of NCAA teams recorded in the NCAA ISP during the 2014\u20132015 through 2018\u20132019 athletic seasons.\n\nIn this study we analyzed women's lacrosse exposure and injury data collected in the NCAA ISP during the 2014\u20132015 through 2018\u20132019 athletic seasons. The methods of the NCAA ISP have been reviewed and approved as an exempt study by the NCAA Research Review Board. Athletic trainers (ATs) at participating institutions contributed exposure and injury data using their clinical electronic medical record systems. A reportable injury was one that occurred due to participation in an organized intercollegiate practice or competition and required medical attention by an AT or physician regardless of time loss. Reportable exposures included scheduled team practices and competitions for this analysis. Data from 18 (4% of membership) participating programs in 2014\u20132015, 12 (3% of membership) in 2015\u20132016, 17 (3% of membership) in 2016\u20132017, 23 (5% of membership) in 2017\u20132018, and 69 (13% of membership) in 2018\u20132019 qualified for inclusion in analyses. The methods manuscript in this special issue further details the surveillance program and qualification criteria for participating programs. 10\n\nInjury counts and rates per 1000 AEs were examined overall and by event type (practice, competition), competition level (Division I, Division II, Division III), season segment (preseason, regular season, postseason), and time loss (time loss [TL], NTL). An AE was defined as 1 athlete participating in 1 exposure event (practice or competition). Weighted and unweighted rates were estimated; however, results were presented in terms of unweighted rates due to low frequencies of injury observations across levels of certain covariates unless otherwise specified. Rate profile plots displayed temporal trends in injury rates across the study period stratified by levels of exposure characteristics, and time trends in rates of most commonly reported injuries were examined across the study period. Stratified injury counts and proportions were presented by TL, body part injured, injury mechanism, injury diagnosis, player position, and activity at the time of injury. Injury rate ratios (IRRs) were used to examine differential injury rates across event types, competition levels, and season segments. IRRs with associated 95% CIs excluding 1.00 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute).\n\nApproximately 40.1% of all reported injuries were NTL, less than a third (29.7%) resulted in TL \u22651 day, and \u223c30% had missing/unknown TL. The prevalence of TL injuries was higher among practice-related (31.9%) than competition-related (25.5%) injuries. The prevalence of TL injuries varied across the study period (2014\u20132015 = 38.5%; 2015\u20132016 = 47.3%; 2016\u20132017 = 40.2%; 2017\u20132018 = 21.3%; 2018\u20132019 = 25.6%), as did the prevalence of injuries with missing TL data (2014\u20132015 = 14.7%; 2015\u20132016 = 8.2%; 2016\u20132017 = 20.7%; 2017\u20132018 = 43.8%; 2018\u20132019 = 34.5%). Over one-third of all TL injuries (35.0%) resulted in TL of 10 or more days. The prevalence of TL injuries were higher among practice-related (31.9%) than competition-related (25.5%) injuries. Rates of competition-related TL injuries decreased notably between 2014\u20132015 and 2015\u20132016 and remained stable throughout the remainder of the study period ( Figure C). Rates of practice-related TL injuries fluctuated throughout the study period, decreasing consistently between 2015\u20132016 and 2017\u20132018 before increasing sharply during the final year of the study ( Figure C).\n\nOverall, most women's lacrosse injuries reported between 2014\u20132015 and 2018\u20132019 were sprains (19.9%), strains (19.2%), and inflammatory conditions (15.3%). Contusions (12.8%) were also commonly reported during the study period. While strains accounted for comparable proportions of reported practice and competition injuries ( Table 3 ), sprains accounted for a larger proportion of competition injuries (25.9%) than practice injuries (16.8%), and inflammatory conditions accounted for a larger proportion of practice injuries (19.7%) than competition injuries (6.8%). The most commonly reported specific injuries during the study period were partial or complete lateral ligament complex tears (ankle sprains; 9.1%), concussions (7.2%; overall rate = 3.58 per 10 000 AEs; 95% CI = 2.89, 4.27), and partial or complete hamstring tears (3.8%). Rates of lateral ligament complex tears steadily increased between 2014\u20132015 and 2017\u20132018 before decreasing during the final year of the study ( Figure D). Rates of hamstring tears increased between 2014\u20132015 and 2015\u20132016 before decreasing steadily until 2017-2018 ( Figure D). Temporal patterns in concussion rates were not described due to low counts of concussions observed during certain years of the study period.\n\nIn this study we describe the epidemiology of injuries in NCAA women's lacrosse during the 2014\u20132015 through 2018\u20132019 athletic seasons. The overall injury rate was \u223c5 injuries per 1,000 AEs, and the rate of injury was twice as high in competitions as in practices. The injury rate in Division III was higher than those in Divisions I and II, which is similar to findings previously reported by Pierpoint et al.5 Recent research indicated that ATs at Division III programs typically incurred a greater patient load than their Division I and II counterparts.11 Further, schools with a greater number of clinicians per student-athletes have also been shown to have lower injury rates than schools in which ATs have higher patient loads,12 which has been hypothesized to be related to clinicians' involvement in injury prevention programs, attitudes toward athlete health and well-being, and documentation practices. The injury rates observed in this study were comparable to previous findings, albeit marginally higher than select previous reports within this population.3,5 Practice injury rates were relatively stable during this 5-year study period; however, a notable increase was observed during the final year of the study. In comparison, the competition injury rate increased between 2014\u20132015 and 2017\u20132018 (most sharply between 2016\u20132017 and 2017\u20132018) and decreased notably during the final year of the study. Importantly, the current study included TL and NTL injuries, which is not the case in previous reports and therefore may influence the practice and competition injury rates.5 Further, given that participation in the NCAA ISP among women's lacrosse programs increased dramatically during the final year of the study, it is reasonable to suggest that the higher practice injury rates observed in 2018\u20132019 are a more stable representation of the injury burden in this population compared with those from previous years. It is therefore important to examine the contrasting trajectories of practice and competition injury rates observed between 2017\u20132018 and 2018\u20132019 more closely and to identify potential contributing factors. We note that increases in participation across the study period are due to new recruitment strategies (in particular, the NCAA Sport Science Institute's role in association-wide communication). With that said, limitations to the external validity of the present study should be considered as the ISP uses a convenience sampling scheme, and participation in the ISP is therefore not compulsory for ATs at NCAA-sponsored institutions. Therefore, given the findings of this study it is important to continue monitoring practice-related injury incidence in this population after 2018\u20132019 to determine whether the increasing trajectory is maintained. Furthermore, the marked increase in competition injury rates between 2016\u20132017 and 2017\u20132018 is noteworthy and warrants juxtaposition with competition rule changes and policy updates from the same time period. Important playing rule changes with regards to free movement, self-starting after minor fouls, and permission to kick the ball (to move away from congested spaces) were implemented in NCAA women's lacrosse during the study period.13\u201315 The observed trajectories indicate that these changes may have required a familiarization period for athletes to adapt to gameplay, during which competition injury risk may have been higher than previously recorded. Future researchers may wish to measure features (eg, penalty event) and phases (eg, pace of play after the penalty) of gameplay to appraise how rule additions, amendments, or both affect gameplay and injury incidence. In examining competition-related injury incidence more closely, it is also salient to consider the dynamic nature of NCAA women's lacrosse sponsorship over time.2 Indeed, the rise in the total number of women's lacrosse teams sponsored by the NCAA may change the nature of competition within the sport, consequently yielding fluctuating competition injury rates.\n\nWe identified that the preseason injury rate was higher than the regular season and postseason injury rates. This may be attributed to a sudden increase in training workload that most athletes encounter while transitioning from the offseason to preseason as well as a rapid reintroduction to dynamic team play in an intense and competitive atmosphere.16 Interestingly, these findings contrast with those of previous reports indicating no differences between preseason and regular season injury rates in this setting.5 In comparing the results observed here with previously reported surveillance-based findings within this population, it is important to consider that the present study leveraged a larger volume of data given the improved participation in the NCAA ISP over time. In addition, potential differences in findings between studies may be due to the inclusion of both TL and NTL injuries in the current study; previous studies only included TL injury events.5 Further, it is important to note that the preseason injury rates followed an increasing trajectory for most of the study period (between 2015\u20132016 and 2018\u20132019), suggesting that the preseason injury incidence has been increasing in recent years. It is important to further examine recent changes in preseason training practices and workload accumulation during preseason to better understand preseason injury risk in this population. In its current form, the NCAA ISP is not positioned to capture information on training details or workload. Given the inherent limitations of sports injury surveillance systems, these investigations may be better carried out using small-sample, targeted examinations.17\n\nIn the current study, we also found that the knee, ankle, lower leg, and head/face were the most commonly injured body parts among NCAA women's lacrosse athletes, and this is generally consistent with previously reported findings in this population.3 Overuse mechanisms contributed a large proportion of reported injuries during 2014\u20132015 through 2018\u20132019 seasons. Overuse mechanisms were largely attributed to the lower extremity, were most often reported from practice-related exposures, and were predominantly NTL injuries. The observed prevalence of overuse injuries mirror previous studies of this population, and the findings of the present study may be even be more reflective of the distribution of injuries incurred by women's lacrosse athletes given the additional capture of NTL injuries in the present study in contrast to previous studies.5 In this regard, it is important to acknowledge that the prevalence of injuries missing TL data was relatively high across the study period, and the TL distribution of overuse injuries therefore may not be entirely reflected in these results. Missing outcome information is an inherent limitation of sports injury surveillance, and future studies should aim to more comprehensively capture outcome data to better examine overuse injuries in this population. Given that it has been previously reported that lower extremity injuries accounted for approximately 70% of overuse injuries in NCAA athletes (albeit not specifically in women's lacrosse athletes),18 the distributions of injuries by body part and injury mechanism observed in this study are unsurprising. Close monitoring of workload accumulation and acute to chronic workload ratio may be needed to facilitate detection of these injuries and better identify effective preventive strategies.19,20 In particular, lateral ligament complex tear (ankle sprain) and hamstring tear (partial or complete) were the most common diagnoses in this sample, which may be due to demands within lacrosse, including quick or unanticipated changes of direction20 and acceleration/deceleration during play.22 Therefore, ATs should aim to include primary and secondary areas of prevention for these specific injury diagnoses. Further, with regard to injury mechanism, despite restrictions for player-to-player contact in women's lacrosse, player contact accounted for 14% of reported injuries during the study period. While this is also consistent with previously reported findings,3,8 the inciting mechanisms are modifiable risk factors influenced by rules, officiating, and protective equipment and suggest an area for future injury prevention study. It is also important to consider that head/face injuries accounted for \u223c12% of all reported injuries and that concussion was one of the most common specific injuries reported during the time period. The topic of protective headgear in women's lacrosse has gathered much academic and media attention in recent years.9,23\u201325 While evidence indicates a reduction of eye and head/face injuries after institution of protective eyewear requirements in youth girls' lacrosse,6 the efficacy of helmets in reducing concussion risk has not been robustly demonstrated using empirical evidence. Given that helmets are used in boys' and men's lacrosse, previous researchers have compared injury incidence in boys' and girls' lacrosse to determine the protective effect of helmet use in lacrosse.9,23\u201325 Subsequently, it was observed that in high school girl's lacrosse, concussions were most often attributed to ball or stick contact.9,23\u201325 These mechanisms, and their resulting effect on head movements, may be abated by requiring a hard-shelled helmet in women's lacrosse. However, due to the inherent differences between the sports, targeted studies in women's lacrosse are needed to better determine the protective effect of helmets in this population."}]}
