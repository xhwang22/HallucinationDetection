Good going forward, hard working and with good touch and distribution the teenager displayed all the raw ingredients to become a top quality full-back.\n\n\n\nInitially used from the bench, Caddis\u2019 was given a starting spot in the 3-2 Champions League defeat to Barcelona at Parkhead. Although he would be subbed that night the youngster did not look out of his depth in such illustrious company.\n\n\n\nWith Hinkel and Wilson already vying for the right-back berth Caddis may have to bide his time before he becomes a first team regular but the early signs are that he has the talent to ensure that even internationalists can\u2019t take a starting spot for granted.\n\n\n\nHe was a very good player but he just wasn\u2019t given sufficient opportunities to progress and many were sceptical that he would make it. Buying in was seen as better too often to taking a gamble on a youngster. Caddis may have been a good prospect but with Celtic messing up the league titles in 2008 & 2009 and then having multiple changes in managers, it doesn\u2019t help anyone\u2019s career let alone a developing youngster. Gordon Strachan in his last season & then Tony Mowbray were poor coaches during those spells.\n\nPaul Caddis was loaned out to Dundee United to gain first team experience in the January 2009 transfer window.\n\nHe returned to Celtic and featured in pre-season friendlies, this time under Neil Lennon. However, in Aug 2010 he made a transfer to Swindon after a successful \u00a3350,000 double bid for both himself and Simon Ferry. We hoped him the best.\n\nHe definitely had the making of a good player for Celtic, and some of the support were very much convinced that Celtic had missed out on a great player to be if the Club had held onto him and developed him.\n\n\n\nPost-Celtic\n\nA successful time at Swindon, he helped them to the league two title in England.\n\nHe then went onto have a long career with Birmingham over five seasons, and was a firm favourite. Made himself a hero by scoring a dramatic equaliser at the death in the last league match of Birmingham City\u2019s season in 2013/14 season to keep them up in their division.\n\nA proud moment came in 2016 when he finally made his debut for Scotland, a debut late in his career, albeit only playing a few minutes late on in the game after being subbed on in a 1-0 win over the Czech Republic in a friendly.\n\nIn 2017, Paul Caddis signed for Blackburn Rovers, coincidentally under Tony Mowbray his former Celtic manager. He later moved to Bradford and then most memorably returning to Swindon where he (again) helped the club win the league two title. He wrapped up his playing career in 2022 but had ended his time in the senior game on the playing side in 2021.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nQuotes\n\n\u201c14 years ago I was involved the last time Celtic won the title at tannadice.

It had all of the ingredients required for a third round classic but, sadly, the tie ended up making headlines for different reasons.\n\nNeil Warnock\u2019s Burton team took hope from the memory of Leicester\u2019s surprising defeat to Harlow Town in the Cup in 1980. Leicester had drawn with the Athenian Premier League side at Filbert Street, before suffering a 1-0 defeat in the replay. Leicester defender Tommy Williams had played in that tie and did not want to suffer another embarrassment against Burton. \u201cWe realise we are on a hiding to nothing,\u201d said Williams. \u201cWe were terrible that night at Harlow and it would have been no injustice if they had won by three or four clear goals. So some of us know what to expect. That\u2019s why we are going out against Burton determined not to let it happen again.\u201d\n\nBurton had already disposed of Wootton Blue Cross, Stevenage Borough, Willenhall Town, Wycombe Wanderers, Staines Town and Aldershot on their way to reaching the third round for the first time since 1956, but their adventure was expected to end against Leicester. They had been hammered 7-0 by Charlton at this stage 29 years before and Burton suffered another thrashing when they met Leicester on the 5 January 1985. However, this time there were outside influences to take into account.\n\nMidlands brewery company Ind Coope, sponsors of both teams, provided both sets of players with an even greater incentive to progress to the fourth round; a barrel of best bitter, containing 288 pints of beer. Come the end of the match, Burton keeper Paul Evans must have felt like he had drunk the lot. Burton had been holding their own before the incident. Gary Lineker had opened the scoring after 16 minutes before an equaliser from David Vaughan sent the Burton fans into raptures. Then things took a turn for the worse.\n\nThroughout the match \u2013 which had been moved to the Baseball Ground in Derby for safety reasons \u2013 Burton keeper Evans had been showered with missiles while patrolling his area. \u201cSomeone threw a can in the goalmouth just after the start,\u201d Evans recalled after the match. \u201cSo I picked it up. It was full of sand.\u201d There was more to come. \u201cThere were a lot of coins being thrown and one of them hit me. Then I was hit by something else and I went down.\u201d\n\nEvans was struck by a block of wood thrown from the stands, believed to be a part of the seating, and players gathering around the stricken keeper with concerned looks on their faces. \u201cI didn\u2019t quite pass out and eventually I managed to get up. I felt very nauseated and kept trying to throw up.\u201d In fact, Evans was sick on the pitch and continued to vomit at half-time.\n\nEventually struggling to his feet, Evans then conceded two goals, not that he knew much about them. \u201cI can\u2019t remember the second and third goals at all. Someone told me they were headers.\u201d Having already used their one permitted substitute, Burton were reluctant to go down to 10 men, but they had a big decision to make at half-time.\n\nReferee Brian Hill extended the break by five minutes to give Evans time to recover. \u201cI was weak at the knees,\u201d Evans said. \u201cA doctor told me not to go out for the second half but by then I was beginning to feel a little better. I didn\u2019t want to miss anything.\u201d Evans made it out for the second half but three more goals gave Leicester a 6-1 win, Lineker\u2019s hat-trick apparently putting Gordon Milne\u2019s team into the fourth round.\n\nLeicester players celebrate with 288 pints of beer. Photograph: Duncan Raban/Empics\n\n\u201cIt should have been a gala occasion. Instead, it was a rather unpleasant day out,\u201d wrote Simon Barnes in the Times, as rumours began to circulate that Burton would lodge a protest with the FA asking for a replay. After a two-hour meeting, Burton decided to appeal to the FA, with the club\u2019s chairman, Bill Royall, making the 200-mile round trip through snow to deliver the protest letter to Lancaster Gate. \u201cWe know we are only little Burton but the principle is important,\u201d said Warnock. \u201cWhoever is playing, hooligans must not be allowed the opportunity of altering the course of a match.\u201d\n\nIn 1974, the FA ordered Newcastle and Nottingham Forest to replay their fifth-round tie after crowd trouble and Uefa had recently ruled that the Cup-Winners\u2019 Cup tie between Celtic and Rapid Vienna should be played again due to a missile allegedly striking a Rapid player. So there was hope for the non-league team. Six days after the original match, Burton\u2019s case was heard.\n\nLeicester secretary Alan Bennett made his feelings clear on the matter. \u201cOf the 6,000 tickets sold behind the goal, only 1,828 were issued by Leicester. The rest were sold at the gate on the day to anyone. There were incidents earlier in the match when Leicester fans behind the goal were hit by missiles from the stand above. The feeling was that the culprits were Derby people.\u201d Derby officials hit back but the most important opinion would be that of the FA committee.\n\nThe FA came down in favour of Burton, ordering a replay to be played at the Baseball Ground behind closed doors. \u201cThe clear message from the decision is that the FA will not draw back from actions strong enough to prove that crowd trouble must not pay,\u201d FA secretary Ted Croker announced after the hearing. Leicester were less than happy but had to accept the decision. \u201cThe team and our genuine supporters are victims of idiots and to call them only idiots is to treat them kindly,\u201d said Milne.\n\nThe Foxes found an unlikely ally in the Burton goalkeeper. \u201cMy sympathies are with Leicester. I think they deserve the tie on the basis of the first result,\u201d said Evans, admirably, after the hearing. Evans, his manager and team-mates now had another chance, but it brought another headache: could they get time off work to play in the replay? \u201cI\u2019ve got lorry drivers, shopkeepers, solicitors and all sorts of working lads who will have to get the day off,\u201d said Warnock. \u201cBut we\u2019ll have 11 out there and that\u2019s the important thing.\u201d Warnock, who was also working as a chiropodist in Sheffield, had to cancel a number of bookings, a situation that wasn\u2019t improved when the replay scheduled for Monday 14 January was called off due to snow.\n\nThe \u00a335-a-week part-timers now had to sort out leave from work for a second time, as the fixture was moved to the Wednesday afternoon at Highfield Road in Coventry due to the unavailability of the Baseball Ground. Finally, the replay went ahead, in front of 200 or so people, made up of club representatives, journalists and a few ball boys who had to stand and shiver on the empty, snow-covered terraces.\n\nAlan Smith of Leicester City and Steve Dolby of Burton Albion battle it out at an empty Highfield Road. Photograph: Bob Thomas/Getty Images\n\nPaul Ramsey\u2019s goal after four minutes settled the tie but Doug Newton and Stewart Mell went close for Burton. The match was a strange affair, played out in an eerie atmosphere. \u201cIt is unfair to ask teams to play in that environment and I wouldn\u2019t like to think that any professional side will be asked to do that again,\u201d said Milne after his team had progressed to a fourth-round date with Carlisle. \u201cThe crowd is part of the game and you can\u2019t perform without them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did ourselves justice,\u201d said Warnock as the saga reached its conclusion. \u201cWithout outside interference we got on with the game and showed a lot of guts and determination and quite a lot of skill. We are disappointed we lost but we were happy to prove that it would have been closer in the first match without intimidation.\u201d\n\nBut the final word should come from Evans. \u201cWe went to the game to enjoy ourselves. But I was deprived of half an hour of a game I had been looking forward to.\u201d And that is the saddest part of this sorry tale. A chapter that unfortunately could be added to many others in a season of violence that sent British football hurtling to rock bottom."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/23048066", "page_content": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nSwindon Town defender Paul Caddis says he is still unclear about his future with the club.\n\nCaddis, 24, is under contract at with the League One side until next summer.\n\nBut he has not played for Swindon since May 2012, after falling out with former Town boss Paolo Di Canio. and spent last season on loan at Birmingham.\n\nCaddis at Swindon Signed in August 2010 from Celtic\n\nMade 42 appearances in first season\n\nCaptain for 2011-12 campaign and led Swindon to League Two title\n\nDropped by Paolo Di Canio in August and loaned to Birmingham\n\nMade 27 Championship appearances last season for the Blues\n\nAsked if he was staying for the long-term, Caddis told BBC Wiltshire: \"Honestly, I don't know the way the club is going at the moment.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Right now I'm contracted at Swindon and, as always, I'll give 100% until the day I leave.\"\n\nBirmingham have previously made several unsuccessful bids to take the right-back to St Andrew's on a permanent deal, but Swindon manager Kevin MacDonald says the Blues have cooled their interest.\n\nCaddis made 28 appearances for Birmingham last season and believes it has helped him develop as a player.\n\n\"The Championship is, arguably, the toughest league in the world and it's extremely tough for a club to get out of,\" he continued.\n\n\"It was good to test myself at a higher level.\"\n\nHe arrived at Swindon from Celtic in 2010 and captained Town to the League Two title to following season.\n\nCaddis agreed a contract extension last summer but a spat with now Sunderland boss Di Canio led to him being stripped of the captaincy and sent out on loan.\n\nThe club is now under new management, with MacDonald having replaced Di Canio in February, and new ownership, following chairman Jed McCrory's takeover in the same month.\n\nAnd the club's overhaul has hit the playing squad as well, with six first-team players having already departed this summer.\n\n\"There's only about nine senior players left, and that's including Louis Thompson and Leigh Bedwell who are still young,\" added Caddis.\n\n\"There's only really Paul Benson, Alan Navarro and Wardy [Darren Ward] who are the old heads.\n\n\"It's quite a depleted squad at the moment but they've got time and I'm sure the manager will track some quality players.\""}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/23836019", "page_content": "Swindon defender Paul Caddis has said he is frustrated with the club's board because his future is not yet resolved.\n\nThe 25-year-old right-back was loaned to Birmingham City last season and has not featured in the squad this term.\n\nCaddis believes that, as one of Town's highest earners, the club have frozen him out with the intention to sell, but have not acted on interest from both Blues and Millwall.\n\nHe told BBC West Sport: \"I don't understand where I'm at.\"\n\nCaddis, who is under contract until next summer, explained: \"I spoke to Jed [McCrory, chairman] when I first came back from Birmingham and he said my wage could be a problem.
