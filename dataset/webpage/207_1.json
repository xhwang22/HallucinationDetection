The panel was organized by Carla Hesse and also included talks by Jennifer Morgan and Mrinalini Sinha. This text has been edited but appears very largely as it was given.\n\nI want to thank all of you for coming out at 7:30 a.m. on a Saturday morning of a busy conference. When I see the group gathered here today, I understand why feminist history has accomplished all that it has. And this is because, after we feminists do our share of interviewing and being interviewed, speaking, commenting and debating, schmoozing, hobnobbing, and finding time to see old friends (not to mention sometimes getting up with small children), we wake up at the crack of dawn to talk about the future of feminist history. Confronted by such dedication, I am tempted to propose one possible future for feminist history: let the women sleep in! Next year, let's let the men get up at dawn to discuss gender and history. But they won't and don't, and we will and do\u2014and that is our strength and also our cross.\n\nLet me turn, then, to my task, which is to discuss the future of feminist history. But surely this is an impossible\u2014and almost antifeminist\u2014charge. For the topic seems to invite the kind of magisterial summarizing and confident prediction that women's history\u2014with its attention to the unexpected and contingent, the marginal and suppressed\u2014was virtually developed against. But as I reflected further on this challenge, I began to find it an extraordinarily useful one, for it forced me to think outside my usual range of topics and against the historian's particularist grain. After all, there is a value in magisterial pronouncements and sweeping generalizations, if only because they can serve as stimuli to debate. So, instead of making the true but unhelpful point that the future of feminist history is likely to be messy, unfathomable, contentious and yet productive, let me take advantage of this chance to be magisterial and predictive, and put forward my own singular but considered views. And in this vein, I am drawn to make three main points about our field: one celebratory, one anxious, and one programmatic.\n\nA Transformative Presence\n\nFirst and most fundamentally, I want to acknowledge and celebrate the degree to which feminist history has come to be\u2014and, I believe, will continue to be\u2014a powerful and transformative presence in the academy. Whatever our individual criticisms of various approaches and fields\u2014and there is no more critical and self-critical bunch\u2014I think all of us would agree that feminism has utterly transformed historical writing. If we take feminism to be that cast of mind that insists that the differences and inequalities between the sexes are the result of historical processes and are not blindly \"natural,\" we can understand why feminist history has always had a dual mission\u2014on the one hand to recover the lives, experiences, and mentalities of women from the condescension and obscurity in which they have been so unnaturally placed, and on the other to reexamine and rewrite the entire historical narrative to reveal the construction and workings of gender. Moreover, despite our own endless arguments over which of these approaches and tasks is the more significant, the important point is that we have been true to both. And rightly so, for this argument\u2014the argument between \"women's history\" and \"gender history\"\u2014is an argument in which one side continually produces the case for the opposite stance, an argument neither side should ever win. Women's history isn't a stage that we move through as we struggle toward gender history, for gender history itself sends us endlessly back to women. And both inquiries have transformed our historical work and understanding.\n\nThus, works on women have consistently de-essentialized and historicized groups and issues too often trapped in discourses of degeneracy and difference. From Luise White's determination to see Nairobi's prostitutes as entrepreneurs and not victims, to Margot Badran's recovery of a critical feminist voice in Egyptian nationalism, to Nancy Hunt's creative analysis of the ways in which varied cultural practices around maternity in the Belgian Congo shaped colonial relations and populations more broadly, feminist historians have recovered and asserted the significance of women's voices and choices in the past\u2014an effort that cannot possibly be dismissed as \"compensatory history.\" And the payoffs from the turn to gender history have been equally great. Most of the great narratives of modern history\u2014the narratives of industrialization, of class formation, of the construction of welfare states, of the making of nations and empires, of the emergence of democratic politics and the practices of total war\u2014are now seen to have been framed by, based upon, productive of, and narrated through changes in relations between the sexes. This revisionist impulse has gone very far in some fields\u2014there is, for example, no more flourishing subfield in British history today than that devoted to working out the interconnections between the construction of gender identities and the operations of empire\u2014but we find it in almost every field. Think, for example, of Afsaneh Najmabadi's lovely recent study of the ways in which a national panic over the abduction and selling of girls helped to authorize and legitimate the project of Iranian nation-building, of Kristin Hoganson's reading of the Spanish-American war as a project of cultural masculinization, or of Partha Chatterjee's and Mrinalini Sinha's rival accounts of the gendered bases of British imperialism and Indian nationalism.\n\nInstitutional Achievements\n\nNor need our celebration of the impact of feminism on the academy be measured by the flow of books and articles alone. There are also institutional achievements. Not only do most departments now feel that they must teach women's history and (sometimes) even hire specialist women's historians, but also\u2014and this is a quantum leap\u2014they can increasingly imagine hiring someone who works on women or gender not as a \"women's historian\" but rather, say, as a colonial Americanist. Equally important, department members who are responsible for other areas\u2014whether medieval Europe or modern Japan\u2014increasingly feel driven to incorporate material on women into their teaching. Women's and gender history, in other words, may not have achieved its grandest ambition\u2014the ambition to rewrite all of history from the standpoint of gender\u2014but it has accomplished something that I feel to be even more important: it has established itself as one of a relatively small number of approaches and perspectives that are accepted both as legitimate subfields in their own right and as essential components of all national fields. Nor is this position seriously under threat, for both the intellectual imperatives and the emotional and political passions that underpin it are alive and well. Our search to find \"where the women were,\" and to reinterpret the world from their standpoint, will sustain and enrich our profession for a long time to come.\n\nIs all, then, sweetness and light? Here, I want to stop and spend a few minutes voicing an anxiety about two trends within feminist history that I find both exciting and disquieting. I speak, on the one hand, of the increasing attention paid to questions of identity in the study of the formation of individuals and collectivities, and, second, of the turn to what we might call an epistemological approach to the study of relations of power.\n\nContesting Identities\n\nOf course, there are good reasons for both of these moves. The study of women led us ineluctably to the discovery of differences and antagonisms between women, to an awareness of the fact that women often saw other affiliations as more meaningful than those of sex. From this study of division arose, inevitably, the study of contestation among identities, and of the processes through which particular affiliations come to be privileged or powerfully felt. Likewise, the study of gender as a cultural and symbolic system led us inevitably to what Mary Poovey and others have called historical epistemology\u2014that is, to the attempt to understand the production of all those fundamental assumptions and categories that underwrite and sustain particular cultural formations. And if these moves were logical, so too have they had their benefits. The turn to identity, for example, has forced a critical reexamination of\u2014and a moral attention to\u2014a history that feminism has sometimes been slow to acknowledge. Rather than assuming the power of the identity of \"woman,\" we spend more time these days acknowledging and studying women's investment in other cultural practices or markers of difference\u2014in ethnic and racial identities, in relational or family roles, in religious faith and observance. Thus, for example, Susan Grayzel's recent study of women's identities in Britain and France during World War I explores not only the emergence of a feminist pacifism but equally the ways in which many women sought to craft a gendered rhetoric of patriotism and to align the cause of feminism with the cause of war. Likewise, works by feminist historians show us what can be gained by integrating the insights of cultural analysis into studies of social relations: one has only to think of Leora Auslander's brilliant account of the ways in which aesthetic tastes and styles, gender and labor relations, and political forms coalesced and reinforced one another in 18th- and 19th-century France. And one could proliferate such examples.\n\nHistory without Politics?\n\nAnd yet, in spite of the manifest excellence of such work, the turn to identity in the context of a parallel turn toward what we might call a neo-Foucauldian or discursive theory of power has left me somewhat uneasy\u2014or, rather, with the nagging feeling that something has been left out. What might that be? Let me take an example from my own field of British history. At the last annual meeting of the North American Conference on British Studies, there were 25 panels devoted to the modern period. Of these, 11 (or nearly a half) either employed gender as a central analytic concept or were explicitly on men, women, or the family. By contrast, 8 of these 25 panels (or about a third of the total) were on imperial questions. There was, however, an overlap of six between these two groups: six panels, in other words, were on gender and empire. These were, very largely, on identity\u2014on \"imperial masculinity\" or on women's self-understandings and expression in different imperial contexts. They were, I hasten to add, often fascinating presentations: through an enterprising investigation of new sources, they revealed much about their subjects' mental worlds. But this focus on identity and subjectivity seemed to have come at some cost (if only in terms of alternatives foresworn), for what struck me at the time was that, among all these papers on sailors and settlers, missionaries and migrants, I was scarcely able to find one directly concerned with the political processes or social relations of empire\u2014with conquest and governance, population policy, and labor control\u2014all of which, I might add, have everything to do with gender. If a nonhistorian were to have come to this conference, then, she might conclude that the British Empire was nothing more than a great staging ground for the elaboration of \"Britishness,\" in which groups of rather self-absorbed British men and women could experiment with different identities without doing much harm to anyone\u2014a bizarre vision, profoundly one-sided, and oddly reminiscent of an old imperial history also intensely focused on the self-justifications and self-understandings of the colonizing power.\n\nWhy, I wondered, did the conference look this way? Why had politics dropped out? There are, of course, many possible answers to this question, some of which would simply stress shifts in intellectual fashion and the lure of new sources, but one part of any answer must surely focus on the difficulties of studying politics in the context of our preoccupation with systemic cultural analysis. The problem is that the insights that have proven so productive for cultural analysis\u2014insights about the multivalent, collaborative, and web-like nature of power\u2014tend to be less useful for the study of narrower political processes. For, once we assume power is everywhere, it usually turns out to be nowhere very much; if it is analytically directionless, it scarcely needs to be taken into account. Our acceptance, in other words, of the truth that power is everywhere and that the weak, like the strong, play the game of power, has led us away from grasping the other truth that the players are not equal, that even multivalent systems can have internal movements preponderantly in one direction or another, that there are degrees of power, that a middle ground exists between an assumption of total agency and an assumption of total fixity\u2014and that it is on this crucial middle ground that most interesting questions are found and much interesting history happens.\n\nWhat Is to Be Done?\n\nWhat is to be done? I think the problem itself dictates the solution. Let me then argue\u2014and this is my third point\u2014that feminist historians need to bring politics back in, and by this I mean politics less in the broad sense of systemic relations of power than in the narrower sense of that set of negotiations and institutions through which rights and goods are claimed, distributed, and contested. Bringing politics back in will give some much-needed precision to some of the work on identity\u2014allowing us to see, for example, the conditions under which particular racialized or gendered identities can be captured by political movements and mobilized for particular ends. The narrow study of politics also reawakens us to the truth that questions about the degree and form of power are crucial and consequential historical questions, that there is a big difference between the sticks and stones that break our bones and the words that hurt but don't quite kill us. The study of politics, in other words, forces us constantly, and almost against our will, to shift the unit of analysis away from the system and toward the component parts, and to ask questions about processes and outcomes as well as about meanings. Partial such an approach may well be, but it strikes me as a necessary corrective at a moment when systemic analysis and \"thick description,\" rather than causal analysis and the study of change has so much the intellectual upper hand.\n\nBut I want to argue for bringing politics back in for two other reasons as well. We should pay attention to politics, I think, because political history has been one of the last intellectual strongholds of antifeminism, and is only now undergoing a real revision. Thus, in British history, a field in which virtually every worthwhile topic has been done many times over, crucial topics relating to women and politics and gendered studies of politics are still relatively underdeveloped. There is, for example, no book-length study of women's activism in the League of Nations, even though this is where many social reformers cut their teeth; only one recent scholarly work (by Kim Reynolds) on the activities of the political wife, even though political hostesses were crucial power brokers in the era before the emergence of mass parties; and until quite recently relatively little work on the reasons for the long-standing (if now overcome) gender gap in British politics, whereby women disproportionately favor conservatism. Only in the last few years, in work by Alison Light on the affinity between appeasement and domesticity, by Ina Zweiniger-Bargielowska and Fiona Grigg on the gendered appeal of conservative penal and economic policies, and by Martin Pugh and David Jarvis on the party's women's organizations, do we get the beginnings of such a gendered history of conservatism. Subjects like these are not trivial, for they help us to understand how some of the core political changes of our time\u2014changes that affected the lives and life chances of millions\u2014happened. These processes, too, were gendered, and they need our attention.\n\nBut there is one final reason I want to argue for attention to politics, and that is because it will help us with our own institutional work and practice. As we trace the historical significance of the partial reform, of the awkward coalition, of the indifferent outcome chosen to preclude the worse, we learn some lessons that may actually help us in the world in which we find ourselves. For\u2014and this brings me back to my first point\u2014as feminist history has swollen into a big and successful wave, it has lifted a lot of individual historian boats. Feminist historians are now on the committees and Council of the American Historical Association, they are deans and university presidents, heads of major granting agencies, tenured professors and department chairs. This group is making or helping to make the decisions about hiring, promotion, and publishing that will affect our profession through the next generation. I don't wish to belittle in any way the struggles of the first generations of feminist historians, who often pursued their visions from marginal positions and against difficult odds, but for a younger generation\u2014my generation\u2014I think it is important to acknowledge that the world has changed. It is no good, anymore, pretending that we are brave outsiders valiantly challenging patriarchal institutions: that is, the institutions may still be patriarchal, but we are right in the middle of them. When we make such claims or play such a role, then, we look\u2014to our graduate students, to younger faculty, to adjuncts sweating it out in poorly paid holding tanks\u2014not merely ridiculous but irresponsible, indulging in some fantasy of romantic opposition at their expense. For, I would argue, there is no power more despotic than the power that hides its face, that operates personally and erratically, that despises process, that will not acknowledge its own place in the hierarchy, that takes refuge\u2014to cite a feminist classic\u2014in the \"tyranny of structurelessness.\" Theories that stress the fluidity and multivalence of power fit too comfortably with such practice to make our attraction to them entirely innocent. My last point, then, is to ask that as we, as feminist historians, take on ever more important roles in the academy, we understand our place in fixed and directional hierarchies of power, and use our position well. This means, among other things, that we think about whether we can place our graduate students before we ask them to carry out our own intellectual agendas; that we diversify our curriculum without operating our own thought police; that we are gracious to those colleagues who don't quite understand what we do but want to be on our side; and, finally, that we not act like hurt parents when a younger generation decides\u2014as it assuredly will\u2014that we got it all wrong, and comes along to chastise and correct us."}, {"url": "https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v43/n05/susan-pedersen/worth-the-upbringing", "page_content": "On\u200b 18 June 1914, Sylvia Pankhurst was released from Holloway prison. She was in bad shape. A year earlier the Liberal government had passed the so-called Cat and Mouse Act as a response to the hunger strikes undertaken by militant suffragettes in prison. Under its terms, women could be released when they became dangerously weak (not just from hunger, but also from the travails of force-feeding), and then rearrested, released and rearrested, over and over, until they had served the whole of their sentences. Pankhurst came late to this refined and punctuated torture: by the time she was first force-fed, in February 1913, militant suffragettes had been hunger-striking and enduring force-feeding for almost four years. But once she was enlisted, no one could match her commitment. If the prison authorities would mortify her flesh, she would mortify it still more, pacing her cell ceaselessly and forgoing not just food but also water and sleep in order to hasten the physical collapse that would bring her liberty.\n\nBut what was freedom, if women were everywhere in chains? On her release that June day, Pankhurst had her supporters carry her to the entrance to the Strangers\u2019 Gallery of the House of Commons. She lay down on the pavement, announcing that she would continue her hunger and thirst strike there, until such a time as Asquith, the prime minister, agreed to receive a deputation from her East London Federation of Suffragettes (ELFS), the working-class women\u2019s organisation that had broken away (or been cut off) from the militant mothership controlled by Emmeline, Pankhurst\u2019s mother, and her sister Christabel. \u2018I feel it is my duty to take this course,\u2019 Pankhurst informed Asquith, \u2018and I shall not give way, although it may end in my death.\u2019 On 20 June, the front page of the Woman\u2019s Dreadnought, the weekly newspaper Pankhurst had begun publishing a few months earlier, carried her shawl-clad, Madonna-like photograph under the banner headline \u2018IS SHE TO DIE?\u2019\n\nAsquith, no fool, had already decided she would not. He agreed to meet Pankhurst\u2019s deputation within hours of her pavement protest. And so on 20 June, half a dozen female brushmakers and housewives journeyed from Whitechapel to Westminster to tell the prime minister just why the vote would better their lives. In her classic history, The Suffragette Movement (1931), Pankhurst portrayed that deputation as the breakthrough, speak-truth-to-power moment that finally shattered Asquith\u2019s adamantine hostility to the women\u2019s cause. Plenty of historians have subsequently disagreed. After all, Asquith told Pankhurst merely that if suffrage was to be extended it could only be on \u2018democratic\u2019 lines \u2013 which was what he\u2019d been saying for years. It was exactly the excuse he gave in 1911 when he torpedoed a painfully crafted \u2018Conciliation Bill\u2019 which would have added roughly a million women to an electorate of eight million men. But historians have always had trouble competing with the drama and I-was-there authority of Pankhurst\u2019s account.\n\nSylvia Pankhurst seems a heroine for our times. She is, after all, the Pankhurst who joined the family project of building a militant suffrage movement but then \u2013 unable to stomach her mother and sister\u2019s separatism and authoritarianism \u2013 moved to the East End to run her own socialist and feminist offshoot. Radicalised by the First World War and the Russian Revolution, she steered that organisation towards international communism, but \u2013 unhappy with Lenin\u2019s insistence on parliamentarism and party discipline \u2013 was in short order expelled from the British Communist Party she had helped to found. She then threw herself into a range of anti-imperialist and anti-fascist causes, and spent the last third of her life writing literally millions of words defending the independence of Ethiopia, the country where she was most honoured and which became her adopted home. In her ability to see connections between forms of oppression, in the integrity of her principles and the breadth of her sympathies, she appears to have been, as her granddaughter Helen Pankhurst put it, \u2018what we would now call an intersectional feminist\u2019.\n\nRachel Holmes\u2019s new biography of Pankhurst rightly gives equal weight to the three great causes \u2013 feminism, left internationalism and anti-imperialism \u2013 to which Pankhurst devoted her life. Almost a thousand pages long, and weighing in at three and a half pounds, it is clearly intended to be the definitive Life. Disappointingly, it isn\u2019t. It is digressive, repetitive, and rife with typographical and factual errors, but that isn\u2019t the main problem. Nor does it matter that Holmes so thoroughly admires Pankhurst\u2019s politics, for biography is often driven by identification: why else would Roy Jenkins choose to write about Asquith, Conor Cruise O\u2019Brien about Edmund Burke, Michael Foot about Aneurin Bevan, E.P. Thompson about William Morris and (ridiculously) Boris Johnson about Winston Churchill? The problem is rather that identification has led Holmes to echo, rather than analyse and explain, Pankhurst\u2019s own version of her story. The first two-thirds of the book are based almost exclusively on Pankhurst\u2019s writings, but without enough attention to the cultural tropes, political imperatives and psychological needs that shaped them. The result is a flattened and surprisingly naive account of a woman whose personal journey was painful and whose happiness in later life hard won.\n\nEstelle Sylvia Pankhurst was born in Manchester in 1882 to Richard Pankhurst, a radical barrister, and Emmeline Goulden, his stylish, much younger wife. A second child, she would always claim that her pretty elder sister, Christabel, got the lion\u2019s share of attention \u2013 though, amusingly, the third daughter, Adela, who was sent out of the way to Australia during the suffrage fight, said later that Christabel and Sylvia were equally favoured and she was the one left short (her brothers, both of whom died young, had the best claim to that dubious distinction). Richard and Emmeline were staunch supporters of women\u2019s rights, but the family moved too much \u2013 around Manchester and then, for a time, to London \u2013 to send the children regularly to school. Instead, much like the Bront\u00eb and Alcott broods, the children educated themselves, writing a family paper and listening in when London\u2019s radical intelligentsia (the Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin, the Communard Louise Michel, the Fabian Annie Besant, and a host of suffragists and socialists) talked politics at their house on Russell Square. Emmeline started a business selling Arts and Crafts soft furnishings and decorations, but it absorbed rather than made money. In 1892, broke but unbowed, the family went back north and the children, finally, went to school.\n\nSylvia flourished more than Christabel, showing a talent for drawing and decoration that won her scholarships to the Manchester School of Art and, later, to the Royal College of Art, as well as a travelling studentship that took her to Italy. But her father\u2019s death in 1898 was a serious blow, causing financial hardship for the whole family and emotional turmoil for Sylvia, who always cast herself as his heir. In her unpublished autobiographical sketches, she recalled his chilling charge \u2013 \u2018If you do not work for others you will not have been worth the upbringing\u2019 \u2013 and the dreadful thing is that she thought it was fine to say this to a child. Unsurprisingly, she would measure her every action against an impossible standard and develop a painful penchant for renunciation.\n\nHer artistic career was one such sacrifice, though for a decade she tried to reconcile social service and art. Emmeline and Christabel founded the Women\u2019s Social and Political Union (WSPU) in Manchester in 1903, but Sylvia was an art student in London from 1904, and it wasn\u2019t until the organisation adopted militancy and moved to London in 1906 that she was drawn deeply into its work. Even so, while she did her share of organising meetings and chalking pavements, her most memorable contributions came from her paints and her pen. In 1907, she travelled through the Black Country, the Potteries and the industrial North sketching women bobbin minders and laundresses, potters and chainmakers. (The evocative pieces recently acquired by Tate Britain are from these tours.) The WSPU\u2019s striking visual iconography and decorations \u2013 banners and brooches, decorated tea sets and membership cards \u2013 were her work too, as was the movement\u2019s first history, The Suffragette, published in 1911. But the book took time \u2013 and so did the two American speaking tours, each of them lasting three months, that she undertook in 1911 and 1912 (and to which Holmes devotes three chapters and 55 interminable pages). By this point, her artistic work had been pushed aside.\n\nWhat replaced it was the ELFS. Loyalty to her father had kept Pankhurst\u2019s socialism strong, but so too did her encounter with the labour movement in America, and her relationship with Keir Hardie, leader of the Independent Labour Party (and her parents\u2019 old friend), which lasted, in some form or other, from 1904 until his death in 1915. Hardie was married and more than twice Pankhurst\u2019s age, nor was she his only extramarital entanglement. But the relationship appears to have been loving, companionate and in some manner sexual. The two wrote regularly, especially during Pankhurst\u2019s American travels. Holmes calls these letters \u2018sexually explicit\u2019, but none of the hearts-and-flowers lines she quotes would bring a blush to the cheek of a young person: Hardie calls Sylvia his \u2018little sweetheart\u2019; they miss each other\u2019s kisses and encircling arms. Pankhurst\u2019s unpublished fictions are a better guide to their relationship, but these too reveal a sensibility that was ultimately Victorian. In \u2018Noah Adamson\u2019, for example, the Hardie figure is described as a man of great ability \u2018condemned to great loneliness of spirit through the inability of the woman he married in early youth to rise with him\u2019 \u2013 that is, his wife wasn\u2019t good enough for him, poor man, surely the oldest of the excuses women make for male philandering. This is not the world in which Lytton Strachey walks into a drawing room, sees a stain on Vanessa Bell\u2019s skirt, and says: \u2018Semen?\u2019\n\nBy the prewar years, Pankhurst was too tied up with her East End movement to spend much time with Hardie anyway. She moved there with two staunch female friends \u2013 the American radical Zelie Emerson and the composer Ethel Smyth\u2019s niece Norah (who would use up a good portion of her fortune keeping Pankhurst and her causes afloat). The federation drew on East London\u2019s long-standing radical and sexually egalitarian networks and was self-consciously progressive. In sharp contrast to the WSPU, the ELFS permitted male members, supported local trade union campaigns, and \u2013 when militant tactics like window-breaking landed Pankhurst and others in jail \u2013 built up a \u2018People\u2019s Army\u2019 to protect the federation\u2019s \u2018mice\u2019 from the government \u2018cat\u2019. This was a boisterous street-based movement \u2013 the Woman\u2019s Dreadnought listed dozens of outdoor meetings each week.\n\nIn The Suffragette Movement, Pankhurst told the story of the federation\u2019s break with the WSPU as a family drama \u2013 a struggle between herself and Christabel (now running the WSPU from exile in Paris) over the movement\u2019s strategy and their mother\u2019s soul. She disliked the turn away from popular protest towards arson and property damage; she also wanted the WSPU to ally with Labour, as \u2013 albeit mostly for strategic reasons \u2013 the constitutionalist National Union of Women\u2019s Suffrage Societies was doing. She lost this argument: the WSPU remained non-party and women only, losing supporters as it bombed letterboxes and torched country houses. (Holmes doesn\u2019t tell us this, but it was the National Union and not the locally based ELFS which profited from this decline, growing to six hundred chapters by 1914.) But Pankhurst\u2019s bitterness was personal as much as political, rooted in her resentment of her sister\u2019s hold over their mother \u2013 who, she thought, had been seduced away from the socialist commitments she had once shared with her husband by Christabel\u2019s vanity, authoritarianism and social-climbing.\n\nThere is more to be said here, of course; in family quarrels, one side is rarely right. Emmeline did defer to Christabel\u2019s strategic leadership, but she had Sylvia\u2019s photograph on her bedside table in these years, when she and her second daughter (but not Christabel) were in and out of prison. In addition, the WSPU, if hardly democratic, was not exactly an autocracy: individual adherents and organisers exercised much initiative, and militant tactics bubbled up from below. Even Holmes (who follows Sylvia\u2019s line) acknowledges that The Suffragette Movement was written more than fifteen years after these events, when family factionalism was at its worst \u2013 after Sylvia had denounced Emmeline\u2019s decision to contest a parliamentary seat for the Conservatives; after Sylvia, heavily pregnant, was turned away from her mother\u2019s door; after Sylvia publicised her delivery of an out-of-wedlock \u2018eugenic baby\u2019 to the News of the World; and after Emmeline had denounced Sylvia\u2019s conduct in turn. Emmeline died in 1928, and Christabel moved to America. The two sisters would not speak for almost thirty years.\n\nBy\u200b the time of that estrangement, Pankhurst had lived through a whirlwind. When the war broke out, the ELFS, like the huge National Union, threw itself into social work. Backed by wealthy subscribers, it opened a clinic, nursery and Montessori school, ran a cost-price restaurant, and set up workshops for women thrown out of work by the early dislocations of the war. But Pankhurst was already at odds with militarism, and Hardie\u2019s outspoken opposition (\u2018I would rather see my two boys put up against a wall and shot than see them go to the war\u2019) and resulting ostracism aroused her indignation. In a memoir written much later, she recalled that she \u2018suffered acutely \u2026 having to tell parents whose sons were at the front that the war was wrong and its ideals false\u2019, but that she \u2018could not permit such matters to influence me\u2019. By 1916, she was speaking against the war at rallies across the country, including one in April in Trafalgar Square that attracted twenty thousand people.\n\nThis was not a popular position, and the ELFS was bleeding supporters and members. The organisation had an impeccably democratic constitution, but it was in thrall to Pankhurst\u2019s charisma; members uncomfortable with her pacifism left rather than challenge her. In March 1916, it became the Workers\u2019 Suffrage Federation, with the aim of winning votes for all as well as \u2018social and economic freedom\u2019; two years later it rebranded again as the Workers Socialist Federation, committed to international socialism and an end to capitalism and parliaments. In 1920, it declared itself the Communist Party (British Section of the Third International). Driving this last transformation, of course, was the Russian Revolution. Pankhurst spoke in support of the Bolsheviks and turned the Workers\u2019 Dreadnought (as it was now called) into probably the most vibrant and \u2018advanced\u2019 left-wing paper in Britain. As fearless as its name, the Dreadnought sent a reporter \u2013 Patricia Lynch, all of eighteen \u2013 to Dublin to cover the Easter Rising; hired Claude McKay (later a star of the Harlem Renaissance) and printed his condemnation of the racist reactions to the presence of France\u2019s black soldiers in the Rhineland; reported in detail on Russian and European developments, and published works by Lenin, Luxemburg, Kollontai, Clara Zetkin and other leading communists. Norah Smyth still paid the bills, but in 1919 Sylvia started a relationship with an exiled Italian anarchist, Silvio Corio, whom she had hired to work on the paper. By this point, she had entirely lost interest in the suffrage finally won by women in 1918 and was intent on social revolution. Which put her squarely in the sights not only of Britain\u2019s security services (busily infiltrating her movement) but also of Lenin, who was impressing on British communists the need for a parliamentary strategy and affiliation with the Labour Party, and whose Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder (1920) was partly directed against her. In July 1920, Pankhurst smuggled herself into Russia to have it out with him at the Second Comintern Congress.\n\nHolmes takes us through the wild ride of these years, but her reliance on Pankhurst\u2019s own works, especially The Home Front (1932), continues to lead her astray. She considers the workshops set up by the dedicated trade unionist Mary Macarthur to have been \u2018sweatshops\u2019 because that\u2019s what Sylvia called them (they paid a minimum wage of ten shillings a week while Pankhurst\u2019s paid eleven, although she later raised the wage to a pound a week, which was also the minimum wage for women in munitions work); she tells us that the separation allowances paid to soldiers\u2019 and sailors\u2019 wives and mothers were at \u2018minimal rates\u2019 (perhaps, but they were higher than the wages paid at either of those workshops and cost the wartime governments more than \u00a3400 million, or roughly twice the total annual expenditure of prewar central government); she depicts the war years in East London as a time of grinding poverty and starvation, even though full employment, higher wages, those separation allowances and (I\u2019m afraid) the absence of men finally brought about some improvement in the health of working-class women and their children; she tells us that the vote benefited \u2018primarily middle-class and aristocratic women\u2019, even though the electorate (female as well as male) in 1918 was majority working-class. Holmes does recover Pankhurst\u2019s astonishingly imaginative plan for \u2018social soviets\u2019 \u2013 political bodies based in local neighbourhoods that would give unwaged housewives a voice, as workplace soviets would for men \u2013 but doesn\u2019t register that all of Pankhurst\u2019s writings, and not just these programmes, were intended to advance her cause. She was a committed socialist activist, after all: it was her job to denounce inequality, combat repression and stoke discontent. But we aren\u2019t going to understand these commitments if Holmes repeats rather than explains them.\n\nPankhurst lost the argument with Lenin, just as she lost the argument with Christabel. Scotland Yard raided the Dreadnought offices soon after her return from Russia; as the publisher of articles ostensibly urging sailors to mutiny, she was charged with sedition. It\u2019s never a good idea for people with strong political convictions to conduct their own defence \u2013 at least, not if they want to avoid prison. But Pankhurst wanted to make headlines: she treated the court to a long disquisition on the history of English socialism, the right to civil disobedience, the many sacrifices she had made \u2018to pursue her father\u2019s mission of liberating the oppressed from their oppressors\u2019, how often she had risked death, and a good deal more. \u2018Why didn\u2019t you make up your mind to keep out of prison instead of insistently breaking into it?\u2019 Bernard Shaw wrote to her, in justified frustration. But Pankhurst served out her six-month sentence as a revolutionary should \u2013 in the infirmary, writing poetry on toilet paper that Norah faithfully smuggled out. Her organisation, now only a few hundred strong, was absorbed into the new Communist Party of Great Britain in her absence and she was expelled from it soon afterwards. She and Corio managed to hang on to the Dreadnought, which retained its independence and vitality, covering politics \u2013 including Mussolini\u2019s rise in Italy \u2013 until 1924.\n\nThen, worn out and hard up, they moved to a cottage in Woodford Green and \u2013 of all things \u2013 opened a tea room. (Bizarrely, Emmeline and Christabel opened a much tonier and still less profitable tea room on the French Riviera two years later.) Mostly, though, Sylvia tried to make money writing. She outlined an autobiography (\u2018The Inheritance\u2019) and planned a book about international communism (\u2018In the Red Twilight\u2019) \u2013 these two projects were the ones that, somehow, she could never bring herself to complete. She did, however, publish a monumental study of India in 1926; Delphos, a book about international language, in 1927; Save the Mothers, a plea for a national maternity service, in 1930; and, of course, The Suffragette Movement in 1931. Her son, Richard Keir Pethick Pankhurst, was born in December 1927 (when she was 45), catapulting her into the ranks of us women protesting that their baby scarcely leaves them a minute to work \u2013 although, judging by this record, motherhood didn\u2019t hamper her productivity much. She had spent so much of her life without enough love; from now on, Richard would be her constant companion. Perhaps this is too simplistic, but it seems to me that what pulled her head from the clouds and put her feet on the ground was the need to attend less to suffering humanity and more to one small boy.\n\nHere,\u200b in its final third, Holmes\u2019s book improves dramatically. It\u2019s still baggy and repetitive, but the final three hundred pages are fresher and more engaging than the preceding six hundred, probably because Pankhurst did not write obsessively about her life during these decades, so that Holmes has had to piece the story together from more prosaic sources. With her mother dead, and Christabel far away in America, Pankhurst\u2019s devotion to old family quarrels finally waned. She now had a family of her own, in which her pre-eminence was unchallenged. Corio worked faithfully on the newspaper they produced together from 1936 until 1956 (The New Times and Ethiopia News), but he never seemed to want much credit or occupy much space. Visitors sometimes mistook him for the gardener.\n\n\u2018My parents were old-style libertarian socialists,\u2019 Pankhurst\u2019s son, Richard, told Holmes \u2013 and if this hardly describes their politics in 1919, it was what they became. With royalties from The Suffragette Movement and a few legacies, Pankhurst was finally able to buy a proper brick house in 1933. It was, like every house she lived in, untidy and stuffed with papers (though there was a daily help and a housekeeper, neither named by Holmes), but life became easier, and a generation of internationalists, leftists and anti-imperialists made the trek out to West Dene for bad food and good conversation. Richard grew up knowing African-American intellectuals (W.E.B. Du Bois, Amy Ashwood Garvey) and African nationalists (Kwame Nkrumah, Jomo Kenyatta) as household guests. After a spell at the LSE he became his mother\u2019s collaborator and moved into the field of African history. Corio died in 1954, and two years later Pankhurst moved to Ethiopia. Richard went with her, and his fianc\u00e9e, Rita Eldon, married him there soon afterwards.\n\nRemarkably, the three lived together amicably in an Italian-built villa supplied by Selassie \u2013 Richard teaching at the university, Rita getting its library in order, and Pankhurst writing for a new monthly magazine, the Ethiopia Observer, devoted to raising Western awareness about her adopted country. She had her weaknesses: she uncritically defended Ethiopia\u2019s claim to Eritrea and Somalia; she paid less attention than might be expected to its extreme social inequality; after decades of criticising Britain\u2019s imperial policies, she now voiced anxiety about its declining influence. But she was never pompous and never bored, always up for a new encounter or experience. I like to imagine her in those years, squeezing her cottage-loaf body into her Fiat, going out into the countryside to find another Coptic monastery, another co-operative farm. When she died, very suddenly, in 1960, she was given a huge state funeral. Selassie stood to attention by her coffin throughout the long service.\n\nHolmes presents Pankhurst\u2019s life \u2013 as she herself did \u2013 as one of utter consistency. I\u2019m not so sure. I am as susceptible as the next feminist to the romance of her story \u2013 or at least I was, back in 1982, when as a 22-year-old I spent a month working in her archives at the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam. (This collection has since been made available online.) I was headed to graduate school and thought she might be a good subject; I was also, probably, on a quest for a historical role model and a usable past. So, I read through the ELFS minute books, tracking the campaigns and totting up the meetings, but found myself drawn particularly to the fragments of autobiography. Several of Pankhurst\u2019s books are heavily autobiographical, but she never wrote a full Life. She tried more than once, sketching opening scenes over and over in the backs of the exercise books in which she drafted her books.\n\nOf these fragments, one made an especially strong impression on me, and in those pre-computer and pre-camera days, I copied out the text in full. (This is the source for a few of the quotations in this review.) It was written in the 1930s, in answer to a question about the decisions that had shaped her life. Pankhurst lists them, but they are renunciations as much as decisions \u2013 it is a register of the many things she gave up (her art, her family, her followers, reputation and honour) to do right. Some seven times in eleven pages she insists that she \u2018never consulted anyone\u2019 about these choices, following the imperative dictates of her conscience. The proof of their rightness and her righteousness was how much she suffered for her convictions, how fully she embraced what in The Suffragette Movement she called \u2018the hallowing influence of sacrifice\u2019.\n\nI came to Amsterdam tracking a fighter for women\u2019s freedom. What I discovered were patterns of subjection I knew all too well. Even though I was raised to serve God rather than humanity, I too was schooled from girlhood in renunciation, taught that the path to glory lay in suffering for the cause. I had long ago said \u2018Goodbye to All That\u2019 when I stumbled across Pankhurst\u2019s account, but what she taught me \u2013 and thank you, Sylvia \u2013 was that you can reject a culture that punishes women for their every claim, but it will keep its grip on you anyway, as you quiver to attention whenever the dog-whistle of sacrifice sounds. \u2018I was always convinced that the element of martyrdom provided the highest and keenest incentive to our movement,\u2019 wrote the woman who lay on the pavement outside Parliament, hungering and thirsting for the vote. Quite.\n\nI would like to read a different biography of Sylvia Pankhurst, one that is less hagiographic but more humane. Surely it is possible to acknowledge this remarkable woman\u2019s foresight, determination, convictions and courage without shying away, as Holmes does, from addressing how her culture and upbringing could drive her to assert authority through self-sacrifice, almost as if she believed that whoever suffers the most, wins. I want to believe that Pankhurst finally freed herself from those patterns, because I am tired of movements that love to watch women martyr themselves for the cause. I want a politics that lets us live for ourselves."}, {"url": "https://www.womensrunning.com/events/olympics/olympics-2021-updates-track-and-field/", "page_content": "Heading out the door?

(Photo by Cameron Spencer/Getty Images)\n\nAfter a rough start\u2014clearing the lowest height of 4.50 only on her third attempt, and the second height of 4.70 on her second attempt\u2014it wasn\u2019t looking like Team USA\u2019s Katie Nageotte would be in contention for a medal in the pole vault finals in Tokyo on Thursday.\n\n2019 pole vault world champion Anzhelika Sidorova of the Russian Olympic Committee, on the other hand, had breezed through the competition. Sidorova held the gold medal-position for four rounds, and looked to be the uncontested winner.\n\nBut after five rounds, and in her second attempt, Nageotte cleared 4.90 to secure the gold-medal position, leaving Anzhelika to answer. Anzhelika bailed on her final attempt at 4.95, having to settle for silver.\n\nHolly Bradshaw of Great Britain finished third to win the bronze.\n\nNageotte didn\u2019t stop at the win. After running into the stands to celebrate with her coach, she decided not to grab the flag and start her victory lap, but instead to attempt a celebratory jump at 5.01. Ultimately it proved to be too much with all the emotions swirling, and she bailed during her run as she started to cry in joy.\n\nThe 2019 Pan American Games silver medalist, this is Nageotte\u2019s first gold on the international stage. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to look back and see how far I\u2019ve come,\u201d she said in an Instagram video two days before this competition. (The video, which goes into how she got her and what the Olympics mean to her, is worth a watch.)\n\n\n\nOh, and hey side note: Props to Team USA\u2019s Heather MacLean\u2014those braids were on point. \u2014Jen Ator\n\nhttps://twitter.com/heathair31/status/1423253477539520517\n\nTeam USA Will Defend Their Olympic Gold in Women\u2019s 4x400m Final\n\nJamaica\u2019s Janieve Russell (L) and USA\u2019s Kendall Ellis compete in the women\u2019s 4x400m relay heats during the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games at the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo on August 5, 2021.

A fantastic team and reputation, they proved they are ones to watch in the final.\n\nPoland, Germany, and Switzerland fought for the top spot in the first lap. Germany hightailed down the back straight of the second lap to get to the front, with Poland and France catching and passing them in the final meters. Poland kept a healthy lead in lap three, handing off to Justyna Swiety-Ersetic who finished with a nice gap to win the heat in 3:23.10\n\nThe Cubans laid a late charge to go from fifth to finish ahead of Germany in second in a season\u2019s best of 3:24.08, Germany in third (3:24.77).\n\nIn the second heat, Team USA, who won gold in the event at the 2016 Rio Olympics, made it look smooth and easy on their campaign to get back to the finals. Kailyn Whitney led things off to get in good position on the first lap. Jamaica got an edge on Wadeline Jonathas in lap two, but she fought to get around the shoulder in the final straight away to earn back the top spot. Kendall Ellis got off to a quick start in lap three with Jamaica fighting on her heels the whole time. But Lynna Irby pulled away in the final lap to win the heat in 3:21.86.\n\nJamaica finished second in a season\u2019s best of 3:21.95. Canada and Great Britain were neck and neck in the race for third, when with 180m to go, Netherland\u2019s Femke Bol came out of nowhere to nearly beat them. Ultimately, Great Britain squeezed out the third automatic qualifying spot in 3:23.99.\n\nNetherlands finished fourth in a new national record of 3:24.01 and will advance to the final on time, along with Canada, who placed fifth in the second heat (3:24.01)\n\nA number of big teams did not have the days they expected. Team Australia finished seventh in 3:30.61, while Bahamas did not finish the race, which means 2016 400m gold medalist Shaune Miller-Uibo will not have an opportunity to run for an additional medal here in Tokyo.

(Photo by Michael Steele/Getty Images)\n\nTeam USA comes into the Tokyo Games as the reigning champ in the 4 x 100-meter relay, hoping to bring home its 12th gold medal in the event.\n\nFor a chance to defend that title, the team needed to place in the top three of its heat or get one of the next two fastest times. After three smooth passes, anchor Aleia Hobbs took the lead alongside Great Britain\u2019s Daryll Neita. Neita quickly outpaced Hobbs and USA took second place in 41.90 behind Great Britain\u2019s 41.55. GB\u2019s team included Dina Asher-Smith, who had pulled out the 200-meter competition with a hamstring injury. The Jamaican relay team also auto-qualified after coming in third (42.15).\n\nAlso running on the United States\u2019s relay was Javianne Oliver, Teahna Daniels, and English Gardner. Daniels and Oliver competed earlier in the Games in the 100 meters\u2014an event that the Jamaicans swept.\n\nYou might recall the last time Team USA was in a qualifying round for the 4 x 100-meter relay at the Olympics. It was the Rio Games in 2016. Who could forget the dropped pass between Allyson Felix and English Gardner in the second and third positions after Felix\u2019s arm was bumped? Everyone thought they were out. But after appealing, they ran a surreal solo time trial on an empty track, made it to the final, and ultimately won gold.\n\nQualifying drama-free, this year\u2019s team has its eyes set on a competitive final round. \u201cWe had good hand-offs and stuff, but there\u2019s always room for improvement,\u201d Daniels told \u200b\u200bNBC\u2019s Lewis Johnson after the race.\n\nYou can watch the relay final at 9:30 a.m. Eastern on Friday August 6. \u2014Malissa Rodenburg\n\nRACE REPORT: Courtney Frerichs Breaks Olympic Steeplechase Wide Open to Take Silver; Peruth Chemutai Wins Gold\n\nOne Last Time: Allyson Felix Advances to Women\u2019s 400m Final; Quanera Hayes Through on Time\n\nTOKYO, JAPAN \u2013 AUGUST 04: Allyson Felix of Team United States competes in the Women\u2019s 400m Semi-Final on day twelve of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games at Olympic Stadium on August 04, 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. (Photo by Patrick Smith/Getty Images)\n\nIt was a very fast first heat, with the top four inside 50 seconds. And that would set the tone for the rest of the women\u2019s 400m semifinals on Wednesday.\n\nDominican Republic\u2019s Marileidy Paulino resulted took the top spot, setting a new national record of 49.38. Candice McLeod of Jamaica was second in 49.51.\n\nTeam USA\u2019s Quanera Hayes, who went out well to eat up stagger to start, tied up badly in the final 80 meters and ultimately may have gone out too hard, finishing fourth 49.81. She made it through to the final on time.\n\nRunning smooth the whole way, Shaunae Miller-Uibo of Bahamas came off the turn in good position in heat two to take the win in 49.60. Jodie Williams of Great Britain ran a massive personal best to break 50 and earn the second automatic qualifying spot in 49.97.\n\nFirst-time Olympian Wadeline Jonathas of Team USA moved quickly in the final straight away of heat 2 to make up some distance, but ultimately finished fourth in 50.51 and will not advance to the finals.\n\nAnd in heat 3, Jamaica\u2019s Stephanie Ann McPherson ran a terrific race to win in a personal best of 49.34. Allyson Felix, looking smooth and totally in control, took second in a season\u2019s best of 48.89 to qualify for one last individual final at her fifth and final Olympic Games. Sada Williams of Barbados was third in 50.11, a new national record.\n\n\u201cIt was a fight to get here. When I was younger, I never really thought about making a final,\u201d Allyson Felix said after the race. \u201cThis time, you get older and it seems harder. You just have to get smarter and figure it out. It is a very humbling experience but very rewarding to see the progress.\u201d\n\nThis moment was never a guarantee for Felix. There were a lot of moments when she was doubtful that she would be able to feel like herself again, she said. \u201cI am slowly getting there and, for me, it is just one race at a time. I will re-focus, regroup and get back out there and keep fighting.\u201d\n\nYou can watch the final at 8:35 a.m. EDT on Friday, August 4. \u2014Jen Ator\n\n\n\nKipyegon and Hassan Dominate in the Women\u2019s 1500m Semifinal; Elle Purrier St. Pierre and Cory McGee Advance\n\nKenya\u2019s Faith Kipyegon (R) wins ahead of Ethiopia\u2019s Freweyni Gebreezibeher in the women\u2019s 1500m semi-finals during the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games at the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo on August 4, 2021. (Photo by Jewel SAMAD / AFP) (Photo by JEWEL SAMAD/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHeat one was loaded with talented women in the women\u2019s 1500-meter semifinal on Wednesday, but only five of them would automatically continue on to the final.\n\nThey went out fast from the start, with Gabriela Debues-Stafford of Canada taking an early lead in the first lap, Japan\u2019s Nozomi Tanaka right behind her, and American Elle Purrier St. Pierre in third. Tanaka then briefly led in the second lap with Faith Kipyegon, the defending Olympic champion, right on her shoulder and Debues-Stafford staying tight in third.\n\nFrom there, Kipyegon started to dominate. One of the favorites to win gold, Kipyegon won the heat in 3:56.80. Freweyni Gebreezibher of Ethiopia was second (5:47.54) and Debues-Stafford third (3:58.28). Jessica Hull of Australia was fourth (3:58.81) and Tanaka in fifth (3:59.19) rounded out the automatic qualifiers.\n\n\u201cComing here is a bit emotional for me, because in this Olympic cycle I gave birth to my daughter,\u201d Kipyegon said after the race. \u201cI know she is watching me and hoping for the best from mummy.\u201d\n\nHolding a spot in the middle of the pack, Kenya\u2019s Winny Chebet fell, tripping up Cory McGee directly behind her and causing them both to hit the track hard before recovering to finish the race, McGee in 11th (4:10.39) and Chebet in last (4:11.62). McGee was advanced to the next round by the referee.\n\nPurrier St. Pierre finished sixth in 4:01.00 and made it through to the final on time.\n\nIn heat two, Australia\u2019s Linden Hall took a quick, steadfast lead for most of the race, with Winnie Nanyondo of Uganda and Laura Muir of Great Britain holding in the top three.\n\nThe Netherland\u2019s Sifan Hassan resumed her usual back-of-the-pack spot until the final lap when she mounted a strong effort to win the heat in 4:00.23. Muir took second (4:00.73), with Hall holding on for third (4:01.37). Nanyondo, fourth in 4:01.64, celebrated after making it through to the final, with Marta Perez taking the final automatic spot in a personal best of 4:01.69.\n\n\u201cI wanted to sit back for at least a lap but ended up at the front of the line. I guess that excitement and adrenaline of an Olympic semifinal will do that,\u201d Hall said after the competition. \u201cIt worked out. The whole time I was just thinking, you need to stay in the top five. My little race motto was just, \u2018top five, stay alive\u2019. [I\u2019m] still alive, still kicking.\u201d\n\nHassan, who is going for a never-been-done-before three distance events at the Tokyo Olympics, will be racing six times in nine days. So far, she\u2019s already won Olympic gold in the women\u2019s 5,000m. (Here\u2019s the rest of the schedule of what she\u2019ll need to run, plus who her biggest competitors are.)\n\n\u201cI was so tired from all the emotions, the medal [gold in the women\u2019s 5000m on Monday] and also the fall [in the first round of the 1500m on the same day],\u201d Hassan said after the race. \u201cThe body is so tired and the semifinals are always hard. Everybody does their best to get to the final. But I felt better every lap and am so grateful. I\u2019m so lucky.\u201d\n\nTeam USA\u2019s Heather MacLean finished 12th in 4:05.33. Edinah Jebitok of Kenya, who had advanced to the semis by the referee after being involved in a fall during the third heat of round one, finished 13th (4:05.56).\n\nYou can watch the final at 8:50 a.m. EDT on Friday, August 6. \u2014Jen Ator\n\nRACE REPORTS:\n\nTeam USA\u2019s Brittney Reese Takes Silver in the Long Jump After a Close Final\n\nUSA\u2019s Brittney Reese reacts as she competes in the women\u2019s long jump final during the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games at the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo on August 3, 2021.

In the case of a tie, the win goes to the second best time and it was there the two battled it out.\n\nBut in a shocking finish it was Germany\u2019s Malaika Mihambo who jumped a surprise 7.00m in her final jump and overtook them both. Ultimately, Reese\u2019s second-best of 6.95m won her silver in her fourth Olympic showing, while Brume took bronze with her second-best of 6.90m.\n\nFan favorite and first-time Olympian Tara Davis finished sixth. She struggled with her take off throughout the rounds, but kept her energy high and finished with an impressive best of 6.84m. And in case you were wondering: Yes, Davis, who recently turned pro, came out rocking her signature cowboy hat. \u2014 Malissa Rodenburg\n\n\n\nAllyson Felix Begins Fifth and Final Olympics, Advances to the 400 Meter Semifinal\n\nTOKYO, JAPAN \u2013 AUGUST 03: Allyson Felix of Team United States reacts after finishing first in round one of the Women\u2019s 400m heats on day eleven of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games at Olympic Stadium on August 03, 2021 in Tokyo, Japan.

But Felix isn\u2019t quite ready to talk about the final farewell\u2014she said after the race that she\u2019s ready to \u201cbump it up\u201d in the semifinal.\n\n\u201cI love the sport, and it has been so much in my life,\u201d she said. \u201cKnowing that this is my last time around means a lot to me.\u201d\n\nTeam USA member Quanera Hayes also qualified for the next round, placing second in her race in 51.07, behind Jodie Williams of Great Britain (50.99). And in the sixth heat, American Wadeline Jonathas earned her spot in the semifinal with a second-place finish in 50.93, behind Marileidy Paulino of the Dominican Republic, who had the fastest time of the session, 50.06.\n\nIt was an undramatic session of the 400 meters, void of surprises or drama. The favorites all advanced, including Shaunae Miller-Uibo of the Bahamas (first in the first heat in 50.50), the defending Olympic champion who nipped Felix in 2016 for the gold medal by diving for the finish line.\n\nThe final is at 8:35 a.m. Eastern on Friday, August 6. \u2014Erin Strout\n\nRACE REPORT: Sifan Hassan Wins Her First Olympic Gold in the Tokyo Olympics 5,000 Meters\n\nMaking it Look Easy: Muhammad and McLaughlin Cruise Through to Finals; Anna Cockrell Makes Her First Olympic Finals\n\nTOKYO, JAPAN \u2013 AUGUST 02: Dalilah Muhammad of Team United States competes in the Women\u2019s 400 metres hurdles semi finals on day ten of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games at Olympic Stadium on August 02, 2021 in Tokyo, Japan.

(Uh\u2026I guess?)\n\nThings started with a blatant false start by Amalie Iuel of Norway. After speaking with officials, she went back to the starting block, choosing to still run even though she was disqualified.\n\nLooking completely unfettered, Dalilah Muhammad pulled away strong and early in the first heat to make no question about her earning a spot in the final, easing up towards the line to win in 53.30. Janieve Russell of Jamaica clinched the second automatic qualifying spot, finishing second in 54.10.\n\nIn heat 2, world record holder Sydney McLaughlin looked fiercely focused, took an early lead to cruise to a win in 53.03.

Beatrice Masilingi of Namibia finished second in 22.40, setting a new world U20 record. Anthonique Strachan of Bahamas, and Riley Day of Australia finished third in 22.56, a season\u2019s best for both athletes.\n\n\u201cI have never run two 200m in a day after winning three rounds of the 100m so this is definitely different,\u201d Fraser-Pryce said after the race. \u201cIt takes a lot of commitment and work, but I am glad I made it to the finals, and I am feeling good and looking forward to it.\u201d\n\nTeam USA\u2019s Jenna Prandini faded a bit in the last 70 meters, finishing fifth in 22.57.

Gabby Thomas (22.20) looked smooth and controlled, almost instantly making up the stagger from the inside lane, until Nigeria\u2019s Christine Mboma took over to win.\n\nIn a post-race interview on the broadcast, Thomas said even though the stadium is empty due to COVID-19 restrictions, she could still sense the energy of her first Olympics. She also clearly stated her goal for the Games: \u201cI want a gold medal,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m excited to go for it.\u201d\n\nAfter a fast start, the last American of the night, Jenna Prandini cruised to win her heat in a smooth 22.56.

She ran from lane six and was distracted by the commotion around her as other competitors fell. She called it a \u201crookie mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got a little distracted, I won\u2019t lie,\u201d she said, later adding, \u201cit\u2019s so dangerous, especially if somebody next to you falls or does anything that is impeding your lane.\u201d\n\nIn Harrison\u2019s heat, it took four starts before the race got underway.

It was about 100 degrees on the track on Sunday, but it didn\u2019t seem to bother the 2017 world champion and 2016 Olympic bronze medalist, who noted that half the track was in the shade.\n\nFrerichs, the American record holder and 2017 silver medalist, also advanced with ease, taking first in her race in 9:19.34. She stayed in a lead pack until 800 meters to go and then decided to take charge, surging ahead. Nobody cared to go with her. It was a smart strategy to stay out of trouble and eliminate some risk of falling. Gesa Felicitous Krause of Germany was second in 9:19:62 and world record holder Beatrice Chepkoech was third in 9:19.82.\n\nGrowing up in Missouri has prepared Frerichs for the kind of conditions she\u2019s racing in, she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m relying on my roots right now,\u201d she said on the broadcast, adding, \u201cI\u2019m feeling really, really awesome.\u201d\n\nFirst-time Olympian Val Constien lined up with some fierce-looking shades and qualified for the final by way of her time: 9:24.31.

(Seriously, loving the look of those relay uniforms.) And they ran well: Team USA\u2019s Elija Godwin, Lynna Irby, Taylor Manson, and Bryce Deadmon won their heat in the first round of the mixed 4\u00d7400-meter relay in 3:11.38.\n\nMaking its debut in the Olympics, the mixed 4\u00d7400-meter relay includes two men and two women from each country. They can run in any order, but most teams opt for male-female-female-male. The world record of 3:09.34 is held by the United States, set at the 2019 World Championships in Doha, Qatar by team Allison Felix, Michael Cherry, Wilbert London, and Courtney Okolo.\n\nThe heavy favorites to win this event were informed shortly after their heat that they would not have the opportunity to go for gold, disqualified because the first exchange from Godwin to Irby was outside of the takeover zone, violating technical rule 24,19.\n\n\u201cWe come out, we try our best and it was a complete surprise to all of us. All we can do is prepare for the future and see what happens next,\u201d Elija Godwin said after the event. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing, no matter the outcome.

Saunders, who finished fifth at the 2016 Rio Olympics, dominated her preliminary round on July 30. After fouling on her first attempt, she threw an impressive 19.2 meters on her second.\n\nNicknamed \u201cThe Hulk,\u201d Saunders showed up looking strong wearing a Joker-esque mask and chromatic single-lens sunglasses. She\u2019s already had an impressive 2021, throwing a personal-best of 19.96 meters at the Olympic Trials in June.\n\n\u201cI feel really good. I feel absolutely amazing. I\u2019ve been preparing myself for pretty much a dog fight, a battle, maybe one of the greatest shot put competitions of all time, so I\u2019m really ready. I\u2019m really focused. I\u2019m ready to get it and compete against really great athletes,\u201d Saunders said after the competition.\n\nAmerica\u2019s other two throwers did not advance. Aquilla Adelaide fell short, coming in ninth in the second heat with 17.68 meter throw. Jessica Ramsey narrowly missed the 18.80m qualifying distance with her 18.75m throw.\n\nThe shot put finals will take place on August 1.\n\nOther field updates: the triple long jump qualification rounds took place shortly before the shot put. No jumpers from Team USA qualified to advance. Competing was Orji Keturah, Jasmine Moore, and Tori Franklin. No American has ever medaled in the Olympic triple long jump. \u2014Malissa Rodenburg\n\nJamaica Did What Jamaica Does, While All of Team USA Also Advances in the 100 Meters\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DaLJBeast/status/1420952762087444484\n\nTeam USA went three-for-three in the first round of the women\u2019s 100 meter to all advance to the semi-final on Friday in Tokyo.\n\nIn the opening heat, Teahna Daniels, who finished third at Olympic Trials, took first (11.04) in the opening heat ahead of Great Britain\u2019s Dina Asher-Smith (11.07) to automatically advance, along with Murielle Ahoure.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited. Are you kidding me? This is the most anticipated race and just to be in it and to be competing, I am soaking in every moment,\u201d Daniels said after the race. \u201cThere is no pressure, as I don\u2019t put pressure on myself, or other people\u2019s expectations of me. I just know what I can do. I am excited, I think I am going to be in the final.\u201d\n\nIn heat three, runner-up at Olympic Trials Javianne Oliver was edged out by Germany\u2019s Alexandra Burghardt (11.08), finishing second second in 11.15.\n\nAnd in the final heat of the evening, Jenna Prandini, who is also racing the 200 meters for Team USA, held on for third with a time of 11.11. Prandini was added to the 100-meter squad after Trials champion Sha\u2019Carri Richardson received a one-month ban for testing positive for marijuana.\n\nTeam Jamaica, as expected, showed its leadership in the event. Reigning Olympic champion Elaine Thompson-Herah made it look easy storming through the line during heat two in 10.82. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, ranked first in the world, looked smooth and relaxed to win her heat in 10.84. At 34 years old, the four-time Olympian is running faster than ever. If she earns a medal here in Tokyo, she would become the first athlete man or woman to win four medals in the 100 meters. And 2016 Rio Olympic 400-meter bronze medalist Shericka Jackson, who surprised many when she made this year\u2019s Jamaican team in the 100 and 200, finished second in the final heat in 11.07.\n\nBut it was C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s Marie-Josee Ta Lou who might have made the biggest statement of the night. After finishing fourth place in both the 100 and 200 at the 2016 Rio Olympics, Ta Lou found her redemption running into a headwind to win her heat in 10.78, setting a new African record. \u2014Jen Ator\n\n\n\nSmooth Sailing for Mu, Rogers, and Wilson in First Round of the 800 Meters\n\nHabitam Alemu of Team Ethiopia, Athing Mu of Team United States, and Melissa Bishop-Nriagu of Team Canada compete during round one of the women\u2019s 800-meter heats on day seven of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games at Olympic Stadium on July 30, 2021 in Tokyo, Japan.

Great Britain\u2019s Keely Hodgkinson, in second place, also advanced, along with Mary More of Kenya.\n\nIt was Wilson, American record-holder (1:55.61) and 2016 Olympian, who ended up with the fastest race of the evening among the American trio. She earned an auto-qualifier by placing second in 2:00.02, behind Jemma Reekie of Great Britain, who ran 1:59.97. Chunyu Want was third in 2:00.05 to also advance to the semi-final round.\n\nAlmost all of the heavy-hitters in the notably talented field had little drama in the opening round, though Melissa Bishop-Nriagu of Canada was among those who did not make it to the semi final, which is at 7:50 a.m. on July 31. \u2014Erin Strout\n\nRELATED: How Olympian Ajee\u2019 Wilson Keeps Her Cool"}, {"url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/law-and-history-review/article/abs/susan-pedersen-the-guardians-the-league-of-nations-and-the-crisis-of-empire-oxford-oxford-university-press-2015-pp-592-3495-cloth-isbn-9780199730032/62B543C4B5C2CD308A1428D4D3120552", "page_content": "It is a time-honored clich\u00e9 to claim that a book defies overview, its elegance and erudition invalidating the very idea of a concise assessment. In most cases, such claims amount to little more than rhetorical flourishes. The present book is a rare exception, presenting the reviewer with the unenviable task of having to convey in a limited space the full scope of an argument that sweeps across two decades and four continents to marshal an enormous quantity of previously untapped archival material.\n\nToday, the League of Nations is remembered for many things, and is forgotten for even more. Its drive to establish a system of multilateral institutions that would coordinate, if not eradicate, the great-power rivalry that had marked the Concert of Europe's machinations during the long nineteenth century is regularly cited as a forerunner of the United Nations. Its support for \u201ctechnical cooperation\u201d with respect to everything from the struggle against malaria to the regulation of maritime traffic to the standardization of economic data is invoked as a progenitor of the countless networks and organizations that now link the globe. The efforts of jurists and diplomats affiliated with various League agencies to further disarmament initiatives and outlaw the aggressive use of force is sometimes presented as having inspired attempts to defuse the Cold War that set in shortly after the next \u201cgreat war.\u201d Above all, however, the League of Nations is remembered as a failure, a starry-eyed attempt to reduce the violence and unpredictability of international politics to the (nominal) order and consistency of international law. The League's inability to contain nationalism; its toothlessness in the face of the Great Depression; and its ineffective responses to war and intervention in Spain, Abyssinia, Manchuria, and elsewhere, all, it is widely believed, contributed to the League's de-legitimization and consequent dissolution. As the institutional embodiment of a \u201c20 years' crisis\u201d in which one after another hope revealed itself to be delusional, the League spawned the very catastrophe it was meant to avert.\n\nThe Guardians has little patience for such narratives. Sidestepping traditional explanations of the League project, Susan Pedersen trains her lens on the mandates system, regarded by many lawyers and historians today as the most significant precursor to the United Nations' trusteeship system and a host of broadly related modes of international territorial administration. Unlike the League's minority protection regime, designed principally for Central and Eastern European states, the mandates system was intended for the extra-European world, a means of placing territories detached from the German and Ottoman Empires under a combination of foreign administration and international supervision. Pursuant to Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, every such territory was to be governed by a mandatory power with a view to ensuring its \u201cwell-being\u201d and \u201cdevelopment\u201d (these terms being in tension and also open to divergent interpretations) and in the name of a \u201csacred trust of civilization\u201d (this expression being a continuation of the centuries-old tradition of the mission civilisatrice). The League itself was to exercise oversight powers, mainly, athough not exclusively, through its Permanent Mandates Commission. This was a small agency staffed by a shrewd and well-connected group of former ministers, colonial governors, and similarly high-ranking officials, most of whom hailed from leading imperialist states.\n\nLawyers and historians have conventionally sought to distinguish the kind of internationalized administration that found expression in the mandates system from the direct colonial rule that had marked European expansion (and its underlying capitalist logic) for centuries. There is certainly something to this effort. Some of the most enthusiastic advocates of mandates would not have cast their lot with the system had it not been for their desire to stave off direct annexation of German and Ottoman territories. As Pedersen herself notes, the fact that the system\u2014and the League more generally\u2014operated in \u201ca swirl of publicity\u201d (65), with intense lobbying and public scrutiny often accompanying key decisions, tended to discourage crude policies of territorial aggrandizement. Nevertheless, the line between formal and informal domination is always a highly fluid one, and the distinction between colonialism sensu stricto and the League's regime of mandatory administration has typically been overdrawn and exaggerated. In most cases, it has rested upon a rather naive belief that multilateralism is preferable to unilateralism and that the compromises of international law are capable of mitigating the rigors of domestic law.\n\nThe central ambition of The Guardians is to provide a more sophisticated explanation of the mandates system than any such hard-and-fast distinction would permit, and Pedersen is astonishingly successful in this regard, demonstrating that those who designed, implemented, petitioned, and railed against the mandates system continually blurred the line between formal and informal control. As she notes, one consequence of this conceptual and ideological ambiguity was that it became exceptionally difficult to determine whether sovereignty could justifiably be said to vest in the people inhabiting the territory that was placed in the trust of the mandatory power. Although most authorities were of the view that each mandate constituted a contract between the League on the one hand and the mandatory power on the other (91), there was nothing approaching a consensus on the question of where sovereign authority was ultimately to be located. Did sovereignty lie in the people subjected to mandatory rule, in the mandatory power itself, or perhaps in the League? If sovereignty vested in the people, was it merely \u201cin abeyance\u201d until such time as the mandatory relationship came to an end and the people in question reconstituted itself as an independent sovereign state? Some may have sought to dismiss such questions as being purely of academic interest (e.g., 229); however, it is not hard to see that they lay at the heart of far-reaching debates concerning the limits of mandatory power and the rights of \u201cnative\u201d peoples. Because whereas the mandates system was designed to internationalize the governance of formerly German and Ottoman territories, setting and ostensibly enforcing standards for foreign administration, it also facilitated the alienation of large tracts of land, furthered the practice of granting concessions to foreign companies, and reinforced a wide-ranging \u201copen door\u201d policy that invited economic exploitation by all and sundry. Indeterminacy with respect to the content and location of sovereignty thus proved to be a handmaiden of informal empire, all the more insidious for being less visible and less costly to maintain than formal empire. As Pedersen rightly observes, all of this was made possible by the imprecision of the relevant legal instruments, first and foremost the League Covenant and the individual mandate documents. Those who participated in Geneva's \u201cforce field\u201d (5, 11, 94) may have been committed to a legalistic textualism (e.g., 64\u201365, 101\u20132); however, the texts themselves were shot through with uncertainties that muddied the concept of sovereignty and muddled the line between formal and informal tutelage.\n\nPedersen does not belabor the contemporary resonance of these and other debates. Nor does she attempt to write a history of the present. At root, it is for the reader to link the heavy-handed Belgian administration of Ruanda-Urundi to the \u201ctribal\u201d divisions that would later prove to be so cataclysmic. Similarly, it is up to the reader to trace the contemporary implications of France's brutal suppression of the Great Syrian Revolt or the various claims to Palestine that were made by Arab and Jewish groups during the 1920s and 1930s. Such circumspection makes the book not only more persuasive but also more pressing.\n\nSimply put, Susan Pedersen has produced an instant classic, a work of extraordinary range that is without question the most insightful and carefully researched study of the mandates system currently available. It will remain a touchstone for all future discussion of this system, as well as of its complex and variegated implications for subsequent exercises in nation- and state-building. It should\u2014and doubtless shall\u2014be read (and reread) widely."}, {"url": "https://time.com/6087202/erriyon-knighton-olympics/", "page_content": "At 17 years old, American sprinter Erriyon Knighton is not the youngest competing athlete at this year\u2019s 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. But the Florida native is the youngest man to compete for the U.S. track team in a Summer Olympics since 1964.\n\nAnd after an impressive performance in the 200-m finals on Wednesday, he\u2019s solidified his place as one to watch in the track and field world. While Knighton narrowly missed his goal of a medal\u2014he finished fourth with a time of 19.93, just .19 shy of Noah Lyles, who took bronze\u2014he did so after only running track for a few years.\n\nKnighton was initially recruited as a football wide receiver for Hillsborough High School in Tampa, Fla., but when he was a freshman, his coach asked him to join the track team, too. He decided to focus fully on track by the age of 16, going pro with an Adidas sponsorship and turning down offers from football programs at the University of Alabama, the University of Florida and Florida State University. \u201cEven though I love football, after what I just ran, I have to give track 110%,\u201d he explained after taking gold at the 2019 AAU National Junior Olympics. \u201cI think that is what\u2019s best for me and what my future holds.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was a little fast, but I got faster,\u201d he told his high school newspaper about his recent few years as a rising force in the track world. \u201cI wanted to be better than everyone else,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on\u2014they think I dropped out of high school, but I be here everyday,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re looking from the outside in. At the end of the day, they really just help me. I feed off of stuff like that.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, he added to that: \u201cI know I can maximize to the next level,\u201d he told Track and Field News. \u201cI\u2019ve got to see what I can do. I want to win against the top athletes, but I know they\u2019re not going to take it easy on me, so I\u2019m going to have to train real hard.\u201d\n\nHis training has apparently paid off: he is the current record holder of the world under-18 and under-20 titles in the 200-m; he set that new record during the U.S. Track and Field Olympic Trials in June of this year, with a time of 19.84 seconds. That means he bested legendary Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt\u2019s under-20 record, too. Bolt has been a point of comparison since he first arrived on the scene \u201cbecause he\u2019s tall like me,\u201d as Knighton has said. (Bolt is 6\u20195\u2033; Knighton is 6\u20193\u2033.)\n\nTeam USA\u2019s Kenny Bednarek, who took silver in the event, said after the race, \u201cHe\u2019s going to be dangerous in the future.\u201d\n\nRead more about the Tokyo Olympics:\n\nWrite to Raisa Bruner at raisa.bruner@time.com."}, {"url": "https://time.com/5169066/final-medal-count-2018-winter-olympics/", "page_content": "After 19 days of competition at the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, Norway came out on top of the final medal count.\n\nNorway\u2019s dominance was apparent from the beginning of the Olympic Games, with 14 gold medal wins in sports like cross-country skiing and more medals from other skiing events from jumping to downhill. Germany came in second with 31 total medals and 14 gold medals, and Canada finished in third with 29 medals, 11 of which were gold. After a number of historic wins for the United States late in the Games, Team USA finished fourth with 23 total medals, including nine golds.\n\nThe 2018 Olympic Games came with a number of surprises and spills, including everything from record-breaking performances to gold-medal favorites failing to make the podium. The United States was an example of both: Figure skaters Nathan Chen and Mirai Nagasu made history with their performances on the ice, but failed to make it on the individual podium. (They did, however, both take home a bronze medal with the rest of their team.) While Mikaela Shiffrin earned one gold and one silver medal, she fell short of the podium in her signature slalom event and pulled out of the downhill event while at the Olympic Games.\n\nSurprises late in the Olympics helped boost Team USA\u2019s medal count after a lackluster start.

She did likewise in person to the USA captain, Juli Inkster.\n\nThe USA were furious after Pettersen enforced a 17th green penalty on the rookie Alison Lee, who had wrongly picked up a short putt in the belief a concession had been granted. Not only did Pettersen and Charley Hull go on to claim a point for Europe, but the Norwegian player exhibited no regret in the immediate aftermath of a 14\u00bd-13\u00bd success for the USA.\n\nThe incident was widely recognised to have been the key motivating factor for Inkster and her players, who had trailed 10-6 with the singles left to play. Zach Johnson, the 2015 Open champion, had branded Pettersen\u2019s conduct \u201ca disgrace to the sport\u201d.\n\nWhether by virtue of a simple change of heart, a realisation as to the magnitude of her actions or advice from elsewhere, a contrite Pettersen took to social media on Monday with a fresh tone entirely.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never felt more gutted and truly sad about what went down Sunday on the 17th at the Solheim Cup,\u201d she said. \u201cI am so sorry for not thinking about the bigger picture in the heat of the battle and competition. I was trying my hardest for my team and put the single match and the point that could be earned ahead of sportsmanship and the game of golf itself. I feel like I let my team down and I am sorry.\n\n\u201cTo the US team, you guys have a great leader in Juli, who I\u2019ve always looked up to and respect so much. Knowing I need to make things right, I had a face-to-face chat with her before leaving Germany this morning to tell her in person how I really feel about all of this. I wanted her also to know that I am sorry.\u201d\n\nEven on Sunday evening, Inkster was publicly of a mind to draw a line under the affair. Eight members of Europe\u2019s team joined in the USA party, with Pettersen understandably not among them.\n\nPettersen, a two-time major champion, plays on the LPGA Tour in the United States. Gallery reaction towards her there will prove fascinating. Brittany Lincicome, who partnered Lee at the time of the controversy, said she believed the USA team members could make peace with Pettersen but others, most notably Stacy Lewis, were less charitable.\n\n\u201cI hope in time the USA team will forgive me and know that I have learned a valuable lesson about what is truly important in this great game of golf, which has given me so much in my life,\u201d Pettersen added.\n\n\u201cTo the fans of golf who watched the competition on TV, I am sorry for the way I carried myself. I can be so much better and being an ambassador for this great game means a lot to me.\n\n\u201cThe Solheim Cup has been a huge part of my career. I wish I could change Sunday for many reasons. Unfortunately I can\u2019t. This week I want to push forward toward another opportunity to earn the Solheim Cup back for Europe in the right way. And I want to work hard to earn back your belief in me as someone who plays hard, plays fair and plays the great game of golf the right way.\u201d\n\nAn earlier element of Solheim Cup rancour was almost forgotten amid the final day acrimony. A member of the European backroom staff, Annika Sorenstam, hit back at suggestions she had been coaching players during competition. Only the captain can impart advice. The same allegation was made against Sorenstam at the 2013 Solheim Cup in Denver.\n\n\u201cJust to clarify, I was wrongly accused of giving advice,\u201d Sorenstam said. \u201cI\u2019ve known the lesson from Colorado. I know what a vice-captain can do. I was extremely hurt.\n\n\u201cI was insulted, and I addressed it with Juli. So, as far as giving advice and what to do, I was put on this team to inspire this team, and that\u2019s what I do. I will continue to do that.

She faded down the home stretch and finished seventh in 2:03.05.\n\nVillanova senior McKenna Keegan and Oklahoma State freshman Gabija Galvydyte went with Schoffield as she moved into the lead down the home stretch, but neither could reel in the senior as she raced to her first NCAA title. Keegan finished second in 2:01.71 and Galvydyte was third in 2:01.76.\n\nFlorida junior Imogen Barrett took fourth place in 2:02.05, Kennesaw State junior Sarah Hendrick was fifth (2:02.19) and Texas junior Valery Tobias was sixth (2:02.74).\n\nFlorida's Diggs pulls away for win in 400\n\nFlorida sophomore Talitha Diggs found another gear over the final 50 meters to win an NCAA title in the 400 meters Saturday.\n\nDiggs was even with Kentucky junior Alexis Holmes and Texas A&M sophomore Charokee Young coming out of the final turn, and Holmes still had the lead halfway down the home stretch before Diggs turned on the afterburners and left everyone else in the dust.\n\nDiggs won with a personal-best time of 49.99 seconds, making her only the second collegiate woman to crack the 50-second barrier this season. Young, who ran 49.87 in April for the fastest time of the year, finished second Saturday in 50.65.\n\nTexas junior Kennedy Simon finished third in 50.69 and teammate Stacey Ann Williams took fifth in 51.13. Holmes faded to fourth in 50.71, with UCLA senior Shae Anderson in sixth (51.50) and Arkansas freshman Rosey Effiong in seventh (51.55).\n\nOregon's Nelson finishes second in 100 meters\n\nSix-thousandths of a second was all that separated Oregon\u2019s Kemba Nelson from an NCAA title in the 100 meters Saturday.\n\nFacing a loaded field, Nelson ran 11.020 seconds to finish just behind race winner Julien Alfred of Texas, who took first place in 11.014.\n\nKentucky junior Abby Steiner finished third in 11.08, Texas Tech sophomore Rosemary Chukwuma was fourth (11.14) and LSU sophomore Favour Ofili was fifth (11.17).\n\nNelson\u2019s performance was all the more impressive considering she was facing a field that had produced five of the 10 fastest times in NCAA meet history during Thursday\u2019s preliminaries.\n\nLSU's Armstrong hangs on for victory in 100 hurdles\n\nLSU sophomore Alia Armstrong shot out of the blocks and held off a spirited challenge from USC\u2019s Jasmine Jones to win the 100 hurdles in 12.57 seconds.\n\nArmstrong took the early lead and seemed destined for an easy victory, but Jones closed her down over the final four hurdles to make things interesting at the line. Jones eventually settled for second place in 12.66.\n\nKentucky junior Masai Russell finished third in 12.81, North Carolina A&T senior Paula Salmon was fourth (12.85), Texas A&M senior Kaylah Robinson was fifth (12.86), Wisonsin sophomore Destiny Huven was sixth (12.92) and Texas Tech junior Demisha Roswell was seventh (12.94).\n\nBYU's Wayment smashes NCAA record in 3,000 steeplechase\n\nCheered on by the Hayward Field crowd down the final straightaway, BYU senior Courtney Wayment set a new collegiate record in the 3,000 steeplechase with a time of 9:16.00, which is also the fifth-fastest time ever run by an American woman.\n\nWayment went to the front of the pack early and no one could keep up as she slowly separated from the rest of the field. She led by about 100 meters as she rounded the final turn and the crowd began to cheer in anticipation of a record-setting performance. Wayment threw her hands in the air as she crossed the finish line to break the old collegiate record of 9:24.41, set by Courtney Frerichs of New Mexico in 2016.\n\nYale junior Kayley Delay finished second in 9:25.08, West Virginia sophomore Ceili McCabe was third in 9:31.14 and Colorado junior Madison Boreman was fourth in 9:33.02. All three runners established new lifetime bests.\n\nOregon State junior Kaylee Mitchell finished sixth in a personal-best 9:34.59, becoming the first Beaver to score points at the NCAA outdoor meet in 40 years. Teammate Grace Fetherstonhaugh finished 10th in a PR of 9:37.56.\n\nOf the 12 steeplechase participants, 10 set new personal records as the field tried desperately to keep up with Wayment.\n\nVissa claims victory in women's 1,500 meters\n\nOle Miss sophomore Sintayehu Vissa made her move with 300 meters remaining and held off a determined field to win the 1,500 Saturday afternoon.\n\nArkansas senior Krissy Gear led for most of the race with Vissa, Colorado senior Micaela DeGenero and Stanford senior Christina Aragon staying close at the front of the pack. Gear had the lead as the bell sounded for the final lap, but Vissa and the rest of the chase pack passed her on the back straightaway and Vissa held on for the win in 4:09.42.\n\nDeGenero finished second in 4:09.62, Aragon was third in 4:10.00 and Gear was fourth in 4:10.06. Stanford senior Julia Heymach finished fifth in 4:10.58, with five of the top six runners all logging season-best times.\n\nOregon starts Day 4 with third-place finish in 4x100 relay\n\nIt wasn\u2019t quite the start the Ducks wanted, but Oregon kicked off the fourth and final day of the NCAA Outdoor Track & Field Championships with a third-place finish in the women\u2019s 4x100 relay.\n\nOregon\u2019s team of Jadyn Mays, Kemba Nelson, Jasmin Reed and Jasmine Montgomery was in contention heading into the final exchange, but Texas pulled away down the stretch behind a strong anchor leg from Kynnedy Flannel and the Longhorns won in 42.42 seconds.\n\nKentucky finished second in 42.55 and Oregon just pipped LSU at the finish line, taking third place in a season-best 42.59 to 42.62 for the Tigers.\n\nFlorida State claimed fifth place in 43.18, Ohio State was sixth (43.52), UCF was seventh (43.69) and Coastal Carolina was eighth (43.78).\n\nOregon's Kemba Nelson seeking 100 and 4x100 titles\n\nThe women are were search of their titles on the final day of the NCAA Outdoor Track & Field Championships Saturday.\n\nThe Ducks' Kemba Nelson will have double duty on Saturday. The Oregon senior qualified for the finals in the 100 meters and 4x100 relay, the Ducks\u2019 only sprinter to advance in two events.\n\nNelson won her 100 semifinal 10.97 and ran the second leg of the 4x100 that recorded a season-best 42.64 to win its heat. The rely also included Jadyn Mays, Jasmin Reed and Jasmine Montgomery.\n\nThe second day of the heptathlon begins at 10:30 a.m., field events start at 2 p.m. and track events begin at 2:30 p.m.\n\nNCAA Outdoor Track & Field Championships\n\nWhere: Hayward Field at University of Oregon in Eugene\n\nMeet schedule: Men compete Wednesday and Friday and women compete Thursday and Saturday.\n\nWhere to watch on TV\n\nSaturday \u2014 Day 2 women, 2:30 p.m., ESPN\n\nMEN'S FINALS UPDATES - Friday\n\nGators cap team title with victory in 4x400 relay\n\nChampion Allison brought home Florida\u2019s national championship in style.\n\nRunning the anchor leg of the 4x400 relay, Allison took the baton with the lead and blazed around the track in 44.06 seconds to help the Gators set both facility and meet records with a winning time of 2:58.88.\n\nUSC finished second with a season-best time of 2:59.98, Alabama was third (3:00.17), Texas was fourth (3:01.69) and Texas A&M was fifth (3:01.72).\n\nThat final victory on Friday night capped a tremendous weekend for the Gators, who captured the team title with 54 points. Texas finished second in the team standings with 38 points, Tennessee was third (34), Florida State was fourth (33), Georgia was fifth (32) and LSU was sixth (31).\n\nHacker outkicks Beadlescomb to win 3,000\n\nWisconsin senior Olin Hacker and Michigan State senior Morgan Beadlescomb broke away from the rest of the pack near the end of the 5,000 on Friday night and staged a one-on-one duel down the final straightaway, with Hacker outkicking his counterpart to win an NCAA title in 13:27.73.\n\nHacker closed with a 54.62-second last lap to pull away from the field and eventually overtake Beadlescomb, who finished second in 13:28.38.\n\nNorthern Arizona sophomore Nico Young took third place in 13:28.62, Stanford sophomore Ky Robinson was fourth (13:30.23) and Air Force junior Sam Gilman was fifth (13:30.82). Washington got a seventh-place finish from junior Brian Fay (13:31.39) and Stanford sophomore Cole Sprout finished ninth (13:32.53).\n\nIhemeje comes up short in triple jump title defense\n\nOregon sophomore Emmanuel Ihemeje knew the mark he needed to beat in order to defend his NCAA triple jump title, but even the partisan hometown crowd couldn\u2019t propel him to victory this time around.\n\nTCU senior Chengetayi Mapaya threw down an early gauntlet with a jump of 56-7\u00bd on his third attempt, and realistically only Ihemeje could catch him. The Oregon sophomore put down a mark of 55-10\u00bd on his fifth jump but could only muster 53-5\u00bd on his final attempt as Mapaya won his first triple jump title.\n\nLSU freshman Apalos Edwards finished third at 53-9\u00bc, Stanford junior Keyshawn King was fourth (53-6\u00bd) and Missouri junior Georgi Nachev was fifth (53-1).\n\nYoungsters dominate discus competition\n\nThe young bucks stole the show in Friday\u2019s discus final, with freshmen landing in the top three spots on the podium.\n\nVirginia\u2019s Claudio Romero won his first NCAA title with a throw of 217-1 to barely edge runner-up Mykolas Alekna of Cal, who threw 217-0. Arizona State freshman Ralford Mullings finished third with a throw of 204-11.\n\nThose were the only athletes to break the 200-foot mark, with Cal junior Iffy Joyner finishing fourth (199-3), Minnesota junior Kaleb Siekmeier in fifth (196-10), Miami junior Jeffrey Williams in sixth (196-5) and Washington senior Elijah Mason in seventh (195-6).\n\nHall leads women's heptathlon going into Saturday\n\nFlorida sophomore Anna Hall ran a lifetime best in the 200 meters Friday night to extend her lead in the women\u2019s heptathlon, which concludes with three more events on Saturday.\n\nHall had the fastest 200 time of the day at 23.13 seconds, followed by Florida teammate Sterling Lester in 23.29. Washington junior Ida Eikeng was third in 23.81 and Duke senior Erin Marsh was fourth in 23.86.\n\nThose results kept Hall in first place with 3,922 points, followed by Marsh (3,674), Eikeng (3,640) and Lester (3,580).\n\nEarlier in the day, Hall finished third in the 100 (13.15), first in the high jump (5-11\u00bc) and third in the shot put (44-5\u00bc). The heptathlon concludes on Saturday with the long jump, javelin and 800 meters.\n\nFahnbulleh doubles up with two sprint victories\n\nFlorida sophomore Joseph Fahnbulleh was up to his usual tricks Friday night, hunting down the leaders in the 200 meters and pulling away for a resounding victory to sweep the two sprinting events.\n\nFahnbulleh won the 100 in similar fashion earlier in the evening, but the 200 result was even more emphatic. The sophomore rounded the final turn and hit the boosters as he blazed to victory in 19.83, which is the fourth-fastest time in collegiate history and the third-best time in the world this year.\n\nGeorgia sophomore Matthew Boling finished second in 20.13, Stanford freshman Udodi Onwuzurike was third in 20.15 and Texas senior Micaiah Harris was fourth in 20.45, but none of them really stood a chance once Fahnbulleh hit top speed over the final 80 meters.\n\nBurrell successfully defends his 400 hurdles title\n\nLSU sophomore Sean \u201cSquirrel\u201d Burrell runs his best when the stakes are the highest.\n\nBurrell, the defending NCAA champion in the 400 hurdles, almost didn\u2019t advance out of the SEC Championships with an eighth-place finish last month, but he rallied to finish third at the East Preliminary meet and then ran his fastest time of the season in the preliminaries on Wednesday.\n\nBurrell was back on the track Friday night to defend his hurdles title and he did it with aplomb, withstanding a late challenge from Texas Tech senior Malik Metivier to win his second NCAA title with a time of 48.70. Metivier finished second in 49.13.\n\nOklahoma senior Isaiah Levingston finished third in 49.20, Baylor freshman Nathaniel Ezekiel was fourth (49.24) and Houston senior Quivell Jordan-Bacot was fifth (49.52).\n\nShankar closes senior season with high jump title\n\nKansas State senior Tejaswin Shankar had a long wait between NCAA titles.\n\nShankar won a high jump title as a freshman back in 2018, but finished as runner-up in each of the last two national meets. Friday night he was back atop the medal stand after clearing 7-5\u00bc to win the high jump in a showdown against Georgia senior Darius Carbin, who finished second at 7-4\u00bc.\n\nBoth high jumpers cleared 7-4\u00bc on their first attempt but failed on three cracks at 7-5\u00bc before Shankar won the jump-off by going over the bar on his first try while Carbin clipped it on his final attempt.\n\nAuburn junior Dontavious Hill, Oklahoma senior Vernon Turner and Washington State senior Mitch Jacobson all cleared 7-3, with Hill taking third, Turner in fourth and Jacobson in fifth based on misses.\n\nTexas Tech's Zahafi outkicks the field to win 800 title\n\nFive runners logged lifetime bests in the 800 meters Friday night, but none of them could outkick Texas Tech senior Moad Zahafi.\n\nTexas A&M sophomore Brandon Miller took the lead on the last lap, followed by Zahafi and Mississippi State junior Navasky Anderson. Zahafi surged to the front with 200 meters to go and barreled down the home stretch with Miller and Anderson in tow. Ultimately, neither runner could make up any ground and Zahafi took home the title in 1:44.49.\n\nAnderson finished second in 1:45.02 and Miller was third in 1:45.09. Iowa State junior Jason Gomez claimed fourth in 1:46.34, Villanova sophomore Sean Dolan was fifth (1:46.38) and Arizona State freshman Dayton Carlson was sixth (1:46.72).\n\nAnderson, Gomez, Dolan, Carlson and Princeton freshman Samuel Rodman all ran personal bests in the race and Miller ran a season best.\n\nRoss wins back-to-back titles in the 400\n\nNorth Carolina A&T junior Randolph Ross defended his NCAA title in the 400 meters Friday, rounding the final turn and holding off two challengers to win in a season-best time of 44.13.\n\nFlorida junior Champion Allison couldn\u2019t make up any ground in the final 100 meters and eventually finished second in 44.41, with Georgia junior Elija Godwin running a lifetime best 44.50 to claim third.\n\nTexas junior Jonathan Jones finished fourth in 44.93, Florida sophomore Ryan Willie was fifth (45.00), Oklahoma sophomore Richard Kuykendoll was sixth (45.73), UTEP sophomore Jevaughn Powell was seventh (45.81) and Ohio State senior Tyler Johnson was eighth (45.83).\n\nFlorida's Fahnbulleh surges to victory in 100, Williams fades\n\nFlorida sophomore Joseph Fahnbulleh takes a little while to hit top speed \u2013 but once he does, no one has better closing speed.\n\nFahnbulleh used his long strides to walk down the field in the 100 meters Friday night, surging past the competition in the final 20 meters to win an NCAA title in 10.00 seconds.\n\nAt 6 feet, 2 inches, Fahnbulleh bears at least a passing resemblance to perhaps the greatest sprinter of all time \u2013 Usain Bolt. Both runners tend to be slow out of the blocks, but early deficits quickly evaporate as the long-striders pick up speed with alarming pace.\n\nThat was the story on Friday night as Oregon\u2019s Micah Williams and Tennessee\u2019s Favour Ashe flew out of the blocks and took the early lead, but Fahnbulleh came flying down lane 7 and out-leaned both Ashe and North Carolina A&T\u2019s Javonte Harding at the line.\n\nAshe finished second in 10.075 and Harding was third in 10.079. Florida State junior JoVaughn Martin took fourth in 10.09, Florida senior Dedrick Vanover was fifth (10.16), Georgia sophomore Matthew Boling was sixth (10.18) and Williams faded to seventh (10.19).\n\nCunningham comes close to NCAA record in 110 hurdles victory\n\nFlorida State senior Trey Cunningham and LSU senior Eric Edwards Jr. went stride-for-stride in a sizzling-fast 110 hurdles race, but Cunningham prevailed at the line after Edwards clipped the final hurdle with his trail foot.\n\nCunningham won in 13.00 and was just 0.02 seconds off the all-time collegiate record of 12.98, set by Florida\u2019s Grant Holloway in 2019. It was Cunningham\u2019s second straight title after winning the 60-meter hurdles at the NCAA Indoor Championships in March.\n\nEdwards finished second in 13.15, Michigan junior Joshua Zeller was third (13.26), and Clemson teammates Giano Roberts (13.442) and Lafranz Campbell (13.444) finished fourth and fifth, respectively.\n\nJaziri comes from behind to win 3,000 steeplechase\n\nMontana State junior Duncan Hamilton led nearly wire-to-wire in the 3,000 steeplechase Friday night, only to be overtaken on the final straightaway by Eastern Kentucky junior Ahmed Jaziri, who ran a lifetime best of 8:18.70 to win the NCAA title.\n\nIn fact, the top eight finishers all ran personal bests on Friday, with Hamilton finishing second in 8:18.878 and Georgetown sophomore Parker Stokes taking third in 8:18.880.\n\nHamilton went to the front of the pack from the start and seemed to be in control the whole way, but Jaziri and Stokes started pressing him as they headed into the final water jump. All three made the jump cleanly, then Jaziri found another gear after clearing the final hurdle with 70 meters to go. Hamilton edged Stokes at the finish line by 0.002 seconds.\n\nOklahoma State senior Ryan Smeeton finished fourth in 8:20.06, Princeton senior Ed Trippas was fifth (8:20.29), BYU sophomore Kenneth Rooks was sixth (8:22.56), while Minnesota teammates Alec Basten (8:23.86) and Matthew Wilkinson (8:25.03) finished seventh and eighth, respectively.\n\nThree Huskies place in 1,500 finals led by Waskom's victory\n\nIt was a great start for Pac-12 athletes Friday with Washington sophomore Joe Waskom winning the 1,500 title.\n\nWaskom emerged from a bunched field and surged to the front with 200 meters to go, and he held off a late push from Ole Miss junior Mario Garcia Romo to win in 3:45.58. Romo finished second in 2:45.69.\n\nWashington\u2019s Luke Houser led for the majority of the race but Waskom began making his move around the 1,200-meter mark, passing on the outside and then pressing the pace for the final 200 meters. Princeton senior Sam Ellis and Wake Forest junior Thomas Vanoppen went with him but couldn\u2019t match the pace down the final straight. Then Romo came blazing along the inside rail to pass them both and nearly edge Waskom at the line.\n\nEllis finished third in 3:45.82 and Vanoppen was fourth in 3:46.03. Houser faded to fifth in 3:46.13 and Washington teammate Nathan Green finished seventh in 3:46.26, giving the Huskies 16 team points from the event.\n\nThe 1,500 was missing one big name, with collegiate record holder Eliud Kipsang of Alabama failing to qualify out of Wednesday\u2019s preliminaries. He ran 3:33.74 in April to break the old mark of 3:34.68, set by Notre Dame\u2019s Yared Nuguse at last year\u2019s ACC Championships.\n\nTrojans open Day 3 with victory in 4x100 relay\n\nUSC held off a late charge from Florida to win the 4x100 relay and capture the first title of the night Friday on Day 3 of the NCAA Outdoor Track & Field Championships at Hayward Field.\n\nThe Trojans had a solid lead at the last exchange but Florida\u2019s Joseph Fahnbulleh ran a scorching anchor leg and nearly caught USC\u2019s Johnnie Blockburger at the line, but the Trojans hung on to win in 38.49 with the Gators second in 38.52.\n\nHouston ran a season best of 38.64 to finish third, Tennessee was fourth in 38.83 and Baylor was fifth in 38.99.\n\nDay 3 features Ducks looking for 100 and triple jump titles\n\nDay 3 of the NCAA Outdoor Track & Field Championships meet Friday at Hayward Field will put a pair of Oregon stars in the spotlight, as Micah Williams and Emmanuel Ihemeje are favored to win national titles in the 100 meters and triple jump, respectively.\n\nThe opening round of the heptathlon gets going for the women at 1 p.m., followed by 14 men's finals beginning with the high jump at 5:30 p.m. The first event on the track is the 4x100 relay at 6:02 p.m.\n\nDAY 2: WOMEN'S DAY 1 and DECATHLON FINALS\n\nWomen's first day ends with Arizona State in lead\n\nAll the top seeds advanced in the 4x400 preliminaries, led by Texas A&M\u2019s team of Tierra Robinson-Jones, Jaevin Reed, Jania Martin and Charokee Young running a time of 3:25.63.\n\nKentucky was close behind with a time of 3:25.67, while Arkansas (3:27.52), Texas (3:27.88), Florida (3:28.40), Baylor (3:29.03) and UCLA (3:29.17) all breaking the 3:30 barrier. Howard was the final qualifier with a time of 3:30.60.\n\nThe first day of women's competition ended with Arizona State in first place in the team standings with 18 points, followed by Virginia Tech, Nebraska and Florida with 14 apiece. Cal is in fifth place with 12 points, while Ohio State, Alabama, Louisville and BYU are tied for sixth with 10 points.\n\nLouisville's Leon wins pole vault title after long day\n\nLouisville senior Gabriela Leon outlasted the rest of the field during a marathon pole vault final, winning with a final clearance of 15-1.\n\nThe pole vault competition lasted three hours, with four vaulters advancing to take a crack at 15-1. Leon went over on her first try and the rest of the competition fell away. Arkansas sophomore Amanda Fassold and LSU senior Lisa Gunnarson each cleared 14-11 but Fassold took second place on callbacks, with Gunnarson in third.\n\nVirginia Tech senior Rachel Baxter finished fourth with a 14-9 clearance and teammate Julia Fixsen was fifth at 14-5\u00bc.\n\nBYU's Riner wins javelin title with her first throw\n\nJust like with shot put, the NCAA javelin title was decided on the very first throw by BYU senior Ashton Riner, whose toss of 191-1 was enough to hold off the rest of the field through six rounds.\n\nRiner came into the meet with the best throw of the season, a 198-0 mark she set in April. She didn\u2019t quite reach that distance on Thursday, but it was enough to hold off runner-up Maddie Harris of Nebraska, who threw 189-3 on her third toss but couldn\u2019t improve on that mark.\n\nNorth Carolina junior Madison Wiltrout finished third at 185-3, Florida International sophomore Rhema Otabor was fourth (183-5) and Florida State senior Sara Zabarino was fifth (182-5).\n\nStanford got points from senior Virginia Miller, who finished seventh with a throw of 177-7, and Washington State freshman Valentina Barrios Bornacelli took eighth at 177-3.\n\nOhio State's Aquilla sets new collegiate record in shot put\n\nThe shot put title was never really in doubt, with Ohio State senior Adelaide Aquilla setting a new collegiate record of 64-5\u00bc on her first throw.\n\nAquilla, who also won the shot put at both the NCAA indoor and outdoor meets in 2021, broke the collegiate record of 63-10\u00bc that was set by Arizona State\u2019s Maggie Ewen in 2018.\n\nArizona State senior Jorinde Van Klinken threw 60-11\u00bd on her fourth attempt and no one else broke the 60-foot mark. Van Klinken finished second, Nebraska freshman Axelina Johansson was third (59-3) and Virginia freshman Maria Deaviz was fourth (58-11\u00bd).\n\nOregon sophomore Jaida Ross set a new lifetime best with a throw of 58-6 to finish fifth.

Oregon teammate Mine De Klerk finished 13th with a throw of 55-4\u00bc.\n\nAlabama's Chelangat makes up ground to win 10,000 title\n\nOne day after a similar strategy backfired for Campbell\u2019s Athanas Kioko in the final of the men\u2019s 10,000 meters, Washington junior Haley Herberg went out fast in the women\u2019s distance race and tried to dictate the tempo before eventually being reeled in by the chase pack.\n\nAlabama junior Mercy Chelangat, last year\u2019s runner-up, caught Herberg with 2,400 meters to go and proceeded to pull away from everyone, winning the 10,000 title in 32:37.08.\n\nRice sophomore Grace Forbes finished second in 32:48.07, Michigan State senior Jenna Magness was third (32:59.96), Colorado freshman Emily Covert was fourth (33:14.64), NC State junior Alexandra Hays was fifth (33:16.16), Oklahoma State sophomore Gabby Hentemann was sixth (33:18.04) and Herberg faded to seventh (33:20.33).\n\nNCAA Track & Field Men's Day 1:Good for Max Vollmer but not great for Oregon Ducks\n\nFlorida's Moore adds another long jump title\n\nFlorida sophomore Jasmine Moore swept the long jump and triple jump titles at the NCAA Indoor Championships in March, and now she will have a chance to sweep the outdoor titles as well.\n\nMoore uncorked a leap of 22-\u00be on her first long jump attempt Thursday and held on to win against a very competitive field.\n\nNow she will come back on Saturday and go after the triple jump title.\n\nTexas A&M senior Deborah Acquah jumped 21-8 on her fifth attempt, but no one could budge Moore from the top of the long jump leaderboard. She eventually passed on her sixth and final attempt when no one else equaled her opening mark.\n\nAcquah finished second, Texas senior Tyra Gittens was third (21-6\u00be) and Texas Tech senior Monae\u2019 Nichols was fourth (21-5\u00bd). Florida got some extra team points from sophomore Claire Bryant, who finished fifth with a jump of 21-4\u00bc.\n\nKentucky's Steiner sets NCAA meet record in 200\n\nFresh off qualifying in the 100, Kentucky junior Abby Steiner set an NCAA meet record in the 200 by running 22.02 to win that event and qualify for another Saturday final.\n\nLSU sophomore Favour Ofili, who set the national collegiate record in April (21.96), finished second with a time of 22.13. Texas junior Kynnedy Flannel and Ohio State senior Anavia Battle went virtually step-for-step in the first heat of the 200, with Flannel winning in 22.25 to Battle's 22.26.\n\nOther qualifiers included Texas sophomore Kevona Davis (22.38), Florida State\u2019s Edidiong Odiong (22.43), North Carolina A&T freshman Grace Nwokocha (22.44), Coastal Carolina sophomore Melissa Jefferson (22.54) and Tennessee sophomore Joella Lloyd (22.66).\n\nOregon senior Iman Brown ran 22.96 and finished 15th, and teammate Jasmine Montgomery finished 19th in 23.15.\n\nCollegiate Athlete Hall of Fame:Track greats inducted in star-studded ceremony at Hult Center\n\nNation's fastest 400 hurdlers don't disappoint\n\nThe two fastest 400 hurdlers in the country this season finished 1-2 in the preliminaries for that event Thursday, with Florida sophomore Anna Hall running 54.48 and Arkansas sophomore Britton Wilson running 54.72.\n\nKentucky junior Masai Russell, who has the third-fastest time in the nation, ran 56.15 to win the first heat and also qualify for Saturday\u2019s final.

Texas teammate Kennedy Simon ran 50.45 to win the third heat and Texas A&M sophomore Charokee Young ran 50.46 to win heat two.\n\nYoung has emerged from the shadow of former teammate Athing Mu, who turned professional after winning a pair of gold medals at the Tokyo Olympics. Young\u2019s time of 49.87 back in April leads the nation this season and is the second-fastest time in the world this year.\n\nKentucky junior Alexis Holmes finished fifth in 50.75, and the other qualifiers were UCLA sophomore Shae Anderson (50.94), Arkansas freshman Rosey Effiong (51.06) and Baylor freshman Kavia Francis (51.17).\n\nOregon's Kemba Nelson finishes fourth in 100 prelims\n\nThere were some sizzling heats in the 100 preliminaries Thursday, with seven sprinters \u2013 including all three winners \u2013 clocking under 11 seconds.\n\nOregon senior Kemba Nelson ran 10.97 in the first heat and was still the slowest of the three heat winners.

Armstrong ran a wind-aided 12.33 earlier this season to lead the nation.\n\nShe was followed by North Carolina A&T senior Paula Salmon, who won the third heat in 12.68, and Kentucky junior Masai Russell, who won heat two in 12.77. USC sophomore Jasmine Jones had the third-fastest prelim time overall at 12.72.\n\nThe only real surprise was Baylor freshman Ackera Nugent withdrawing before the race. She had run the third-fastest time in the nation this season at 12.49 but lane three was vacant in the third and final heat.\n\nBeavers get two qualifiers in 3,000 steeplechase\n\nOregon State junior Kaylee Mitchell ran a lifetime best of 9:41.51 to win the second heat of the 3,000 steeplechase preliminaries, and teammate Grace Fetherstonhaugh qualified out of a fast first heat with a time of 9:45.17.\n\nArkansas senior Logan Jolly set a PR of 9:38.13 to win the first heat, followed by Notre Dame sophomore Olivia Markezich (9:40.81), West Virginia sophomore Ceili McCable (9:41.10) and BYU senior Courtney Wayment (9:41.21).\n\nFetherstonhaugh was the last automatic qualifier out of the first heat, finishing fifth.

That gives Rogers the four longest hammer throws in women\u2019s collegiate history.\n\nTexas State senior Alyssa Wilson (245-4), Arizona State senior Beatrice Llano (236-6), Virginia Tech sophomore Sara Killinen (233-0), Arizona State junior Shelby Moran (231-7) and Ole Miss junior Jalani Davis (228-1) all set personal bests, but none of them were even close to Rogers\u2019 throw of 254-10, which broke her old record of 250-10 and cemented her third NCAA title.\n\nVollmer no-heights in pole vault\n\nMax Vollmer made a mistake he couldn\u2019t recover from. He didn\u2019t clear a bar in the pole vault to go scoreless in that event and essentially end his competition in the decathlon.\n\nVollmer was in 11th place with 5,737 points when he missed on three attempts at 15-1 1/2 \u2014 his first height of day \u2014 but dropped to 21st.\n\nHe bailed out on his first two attempts and then clipped the bar on his third attempt.\n\nVollmer hasn't dropped out of the event yet. He was seen warming up for the javelin.\n\nFouls hurt Vollmer's decathlon standings\n\nMax Vollmer has taken a tumble in the decathlon standings.\n\nThe Oregon junior fouled on two of his three attempts in the discus and had to settle for a throw of 131-1 as he dropped from fifth place to 11th after seven events.\n\nVollmer has 5,737 points heading into the pole vault.\n\nDecathlon begins with 110 hurdles\n\nMax Vollmer remains in fifth place in the decathlon after the first event of Day 2 Thursday, as he scored 858 points in the 110-meter hurdles with a 14.93-second finish.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a great performance by Vollmer, who set his personal-record in the event earlier this season when he ran 14.40. Vollmer clipped his first hurdle Thursday and had to regain his stride as he finished last in his heat.\n\nHe didn\u2019t lose ground in the overall standings, though he slipped further behind in points.\n\nAfter six events, the top four continue to be Ayden Owens-Delerme of Arkansas at 5,474, Georgia\u2019s Kyle Garland (5,432), Texas\u2019 Leo Neugebauer (5,325) and California\u2019s Hakim McMorris (5,182) as the competition moves to the discus.\n\nSecond day of NCAA championships begins Thursday\n\nThe second day of the NCAA Outdoor Track & Field Championships features the continuation of the men's decathlon starting at 11:30 a.m. The remaining events run through the day and include 110 hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin and 1,500.\n\nThe women's competition begin with field events at 3 p.m. and track events start at 5:30 p.m.\n\nCheck back here throughout the day to stay up-to-date on the meet's progress.\n\nWomen's events:Top women's events and athletes to watch during NCAA Track & Field Championships\n\nMEN'S DAY 1 UPDATES - Wednesday\n\nPrinceton brothers both finish on top in pole vault finals\n\nNorwegian pole vaulters Sondre and Simen Guttormsen both finished in the top-five of Wednesday\u2019s final in that event to lead a strong showing for Princeton.\n\nSondre Guttormsen won an NCAA pole vault title with his clearance of 18-10\u00bc and brother Simen finished fourth with a mark of 18-6\u00bd to score 15 team points for the Tigers.\n\nSam Houston senior Clayton Fritsch finished second with a mark of 18-8\u00bc and Kentucky sophomore Keaton Daniel was third at 18-6\u00bd. Branson Ellis of Stephen F. Austin finished fifth (18-6\u00bd) and Zach McWhorter of BYU was sixth (18-4\u00bc). Kansas had two vaulters in the top-10 with freshman Clayton Simms taking seventh place (18-\u00bd) and junior Zach Bradford finishing ninth (18-\u00bd).\n\nThe 15 points put Princeton in third place in the team standings after the first day of competition. Tennessee scored 21 points on Wednesday to move into first place and Florida State sits in second with 16. Texas (12), Alabama (11), Notre Dame (10), Penn (10) and Southeast Missouri (10) all hit double digits in the team scoring.\n\nMen's preview:Top events and athletes to watch during men's NCAA Track & Field Championships\n\nFavorites advance in 4x400 relay\n\nThere weren\u2019t many surprises in the 4x400 preliminaries on Wednesday, with the top-ranked teams all advancing to Friday\u2019s final.\n\nTexas and Alabama finished 1-2 in a fast first heat, with Texas winning in 3:00.31 and Alabama taking second in 3:00.42. Florida, which set the all-time collegiate record earlier this season (2:58.53), finished third in 3:01.30. LSU took fourth (3:01.67) and Kentucky was fifth (3:01.68).\n\nIowa, Texas A&M, USC and North Carolina also advanced to the final.\n\nPenn sophomore wins javelin title\n\nThe second flight of Wednesday\u2019s javelin final featured 10 of the best throws of the day, with Penn sophomore Marc Minichello winning with his heave of 266-3.\n\nMinichello went to the front of the pack on his third throw and was never really challenged. Virginia junior Ethan Dabbs moved into second place with a fifth throw of 261-5 and LSU sophomore Tzuriel Pedigo finished third at 258-10.\n\nWichita State junior Taran Taylor finished fourth (258-5), Baylor freshman Chinecherem Prosper Nnamdi was fifth (257-11) and UT-Arlington sophomore Arthur Petersen was sixth (250-5).\n\nOregon freshman Ty Hampton just missed out on a spot on the medal stand with a 10th-place finish, throwing 236-7.\n\nPiperi leaves no doubt about shot put title\n\nTexas senior Adrian Piperi added an NCAA title to his trophy case, winning Wednesday\u2019s shot put final with a throw of 70-7\u00bc to come up just short of his personal best of 71-4.\n\nPiperi finished second at last year\u2019s NCAA Outdoor Championships and he added a second-place finish at the Indoor Championships in March. There would be no runner-up finish this time, as the senior took the lead with his very first throw and never relinquished it.\n\nArizona State junior Turner Washington finished second at 69-\u00be and Alabama senior Isaac Odugbesan was third at 67-2\u00bc. Tennessee junior Jordan West took fourth place with a mark of 66-6\u00bd and Northern Iowa senior Darius King was fifth at 65-9.\n\nJacobs overtakes Nur for 10,000 victory\n\nCampbell senior Athanas Kioko made a bold move Wednesday to go out hard in the 10,000 finals and leave the chase pack in the dust, but the gamble did not pay off.\n\nKioko sprinted to the front and established a 100-meter gap between himself and the rest of the field, leading for 19 laps before being reeled in by the pack.\n\nNorthern Arizona junior Abdihamid Nur and Notre Dame junior Dylan Jacobs surged to the front and led the rest of the way until Jacobs found another gear for the final 200 meters to win the NCAA title in 28:12.32. Jacobs closed out his victory with a final lap of 55.45.\n\nOklahoma State sophomore Alex Maier overtook Nur down the final straightaway to finish second in 28:12.68 and Nur was third in 28:14.51. Kioko faded to fifth with a time of 28:17.17.\n\nOregon senior Aaron Bienenfeld finished eighth in 28:19.05 to earn the Ducks a point in the team standings.

Pinnock\u2019s second-best effort was 26-1\u00bd to Davis\u2019 mark of 25-10. Florida State also got a third-place finish from senior Isaac Grimes, who jumped 26-1\u00be.\n\nBrandon Hicklin of North Carolina A&T finished fifth (25-9\u00bd), A\u2019Nan Bridgett of Rutgers was sixth (25-9\u00bc) and Stacy Brown Jr. of Texas was seventh (25-7\u00bd).\n\nHarding disqualified in 200 prelims\n\nNorth Carolina A&T sophomore Javonte Harding ran a lifetime best of 19.98 in the 200 but was disqualified for a lane violation during Wednesday\u2019s preliminaries, putting a serious dent in the Aggies\u2019 team title hopes.\n\nInstead, Florida sophomore Joseph Fahnbulleh finished first in 20.10, using his long strides to break away from a loaded heat that included national leader Micaiah Harris of Texas (20.28) and third-seeded Matthew Boling of Georgia (20.24).\n\nOhio State senior Eric Harrison had the second-fastest time Wednesday at 20.18 and Stanford freshman Udodi Onwuzurike finished third in 20.24 after failing to qualify in the 100 earlier in the day.\n\nDefending 400 hurdles champ Burrell advances in prelims\n\nDefending NCAA 400 hurdles champion Sean \"Squirrel\" Burrell of LSU ran his fastest time of the season Wednesday to finish third and advance to Friday\u2019s final.\n\nBurrell hadn\u2019t cracked 50 seconds this season and barely qualified for the East Regionals with an eighth-place finish at the SEC Championships, but he ran 49.19 on Wednesday to win his heat and finish third overall.

Edwards ran 13.33 to finish second in the prelims, followed by Syracuse sophomore Jaheem Hayles (13.44), Michigan junior Joshua Zeller (13.45) and Charlotte sophomore Justin Leaston (13.46).\n\nThe only big surprise was Arkansas junior Tre\u2019Bien Gilbert, who had the nation\u2019s fourth-fastest time this season, finishing 10th in 13.55 and missing out on the final qualifying spot to Clemson junior Giano Roberts, who ran 13.54.\n\nSteeplechase won with nation's fastest time\n\nMontana State junior Duncan Hamilton used a 63-second last lap to pull away from the field in the 3,000 steeplechase and win with a time of 8:23.13, which was a lifetime best and the fastest time in the nation this season.\n\nEastern Kentucky junior Ahmed Jaziri \u2013 who had the season\u2019s previous best time \u2013 finished fourth in 8:26.27, just behind BYU sophomore Kenneth Rooks (8:24.88) and Georgetown sophomore Parker Stokes (8:26.04).\n\nWashington State senior Colton Johnsen snuck into Friday\u2019s final with an 11th-place finish in 8:31.64.\n\nCollegiate record holder Kipsang crashes out of 1,500\n\nOne of the biggest shocks of Wednesday\u2019s preliminaries was Alabama sophomore Eliud Kipsang, the collegiate record holder in the 1,500, fading to the back of the pack and finishing last in his heat to miss out on a spot in Friday\u2019s final.\n\nKipsang set the college record of 3:33.74 at the Bryan Clay Invitational in April, but he ran 3:43.30 in the preliminaries to finish 20th and well off the pace.\n\nIllinois senior Jonathan Davis had the fastest time Wednesday at 3:37.39, followed by Nathan Green of Washington (3:37.46), Sam Ellis of Princeton (3:37.60) and Thomas Vanoppen of Wake Forest (3:37.65), who all ran personal bests.

It was a third-straight season-best for Vollmer on Wednesday.\n\nHe scored 785 to strengthen his hold on fourth place in the overall standings with 3,332 points.\n\nLeo Neugebauer of Texas cleared 6-9 1/2 and was the top scorer in the third straight event as he continues to lead with 3,569 points.

The Flying Sikh, as he was popularly nicknamed, was into his second Olympics and was coming into the quadrennial extravaganza on the back of a splendid show at the 1958 Asian Games, where he had won the 400m gold in Tokyo.\n\nHe might have dominated the continental stage - his back-to-back gold medals at the 1958 and 1962 Asian Games a testament to this - but one race that Milkha Singh fondly remembers is the one where he turned out to be a gallant loser, finishing fourth at the Rome 1960 Olympics.\n\nMilkha Singh at the Olympics: A photo finish\n\nParticipating in the 400m race, Milkha Singh got through the heats with relative ease. The quarter-finals saw him better his timing by more than a second while in the semis, he would finish behind USA\u2019s Otis Davis in 45.9 seconds, the fourth-fastest to make it to the final.\n\nWith impressive timings in all the preliminary races, the Indian was one of the favourites going into the final. And the manner in which he started the race, it looked like India\u2019s dream of winning a track medal at the Olympics could finally come true.\n\nFiring off the blocks, Milkha was quick to join the lead pack. He continued to push himself, keeping his pace up for much of the first part of the run and looked certain of a podium finish, which would have created history for India at the Olympics.\n\nHowever, an error in judgment saw him slow down before the final turn, giving Malcolm Spence of South Africa enough room to close down on the Indian.\n\nThe move proved too costly for Milkha Singh, as Spence edged ahead to take the bronze medal in 45.5 seconds while the Indian fell mighty close, finishing his run 0.1 seconds slower, leading to a photo finish at the line and leaving him wondering about the \u2018what-ifs\u2019.\n\nThe race was won by Otis Davis clocking 44.9 seconds, a world record then, and by a paper-thin margin over German Carl Kaufmann.\n\n\"I knew what my fatal error was,\" Milkha Singh said. \"After running perilously fast in lane five, I slowed down at 250m and could not cover the lost ground after that, and that cost me the race.\""}]}
