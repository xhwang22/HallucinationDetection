However, his explosive dashes out of the half back line and ball carrying ability did catch the attention of North Melbourne recruiters, and after 43 senior games with the Boroughs between 1990 and 1993, King was taken at number 46 in the 1993 National Draft.\n\nAt North Melbourne, where he fitted seamlessly into an already strong line-up, King enjoyed a very solid first year before going from strength to strength. During the course of an 11-season, 241 game, 145-goal AFL career, he achieved virtually everything the modern game has to offer. A tough, pacy, relentlessly aggressive footballer, he was equally adept in a number of positions, including the wing, a back pocket or half back flank, and ruck-rover. He was a key contributor to the 'Roos 1996 and 1999 premiership victories, and made the AFL All Australian team in 1997 and 1998. He also represented Victoria.

On Level 4 at Tate Modern is a room hung with 40 framed magazine covers by John Heartfield, the German political artist and pioneer of photomontage; in the centre, open in a display case, are two copies of King\u2019s last book, John Heartfield: Laughter is a Devastating Weapon (2015). Over several years, a larger Tate room showed dozens of Soviet posters from the David King collection, items from which will be displayed again in 2017-18 in the exhibition Red Star Over Russia.\n\nAmassed over several decades, the collection is made up of 250,000 photographs, books, journals, posters, documents and newspapers dating from the Russian Revolution to the Khrushchev era. Added to this was material from the Weimar Republic, the Spanish civil war, American labour organisations and Mao\u2019s China. King wanted to make his collection accessible to the public, and in recent years it was acquired by the Tate.\n\nKing was art editor of the Sunday Times Magazine for 10 award-winning years. Photograph: Anthony Oliver/Eye Magazine\n\nKing\u2019s skills were those of the eye: he could speed-read an image for meaning and context. He was born in Isleworth, Middlesex. His father was a bank manager. He began his training in 1959, after leaving school, in the design department of the London School of Printing and Graphic Arts (now the London College of Communication). His political apprenticeship came from working with his teacher Robin Fior, the designer-typographer, who was then designing the weekly Peace News and covers of the quarterly International Socialism, and was a member of the anti-nuclear Committee of 100. Fior introduced King to Soviet constructivist design and political graphics.\n\nAfter a time in an advertising agency, where his favoured copywriter was Elizabeth Smart, author of By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept, he went to work at Queen magazine. In 1965 he joined the Sunday Times Magazine, where, under the overall art direction of Michael Rand, he was art editor for 10 years. The magazine won awards for its picture stories, arranged cinematically and uninterrupted by advertising. King took only a morning to lay out Don McCullin\u2019s celebrated photographs in a multi-page feature on the Vietnam war.\n\nKing later worked on books with former Sunday Times writers, among them the art critic David Sylvester, and with Bruce Chatwin on his Photographs and Notebooks (1993). In 1972 he was co-author with Francis Wyndham of Trotsky: A Documentary. Trotsky became so much a centre of King\u2019s career that Fior referred to King\u2019s Islington house as \u201cTrot-ski-lodge\u201d. In the garden King constructed a personal dacha, set up a bust of Marx (left over from a film set), and laid down in brick mosaic a five-pointed star.\n\nIn 2009 King published Red Star Over Russia: A Visual History of the Soviet Union from 1917 to the Death of Stalin. The introduction to the book is an anecdotal account of his research into Soviet history. He enjoyed telling stories, sometimes cloak-and-dagger, sometimes comical, of his search for material over more than 40 years \u2013 in pre-Glasnost Russia, in eastern Europe, and in the US. This quest won him friends in many parts of the world. The dramatically orchestrated presentation of the documents is matched by a sensitivity to the human suffering they represent.\n\nThe cover of King\u2019s book on Leon Trotsky produced with Francis Wyndham; the former Soviet revolutionary became a central figure in King\u2019s career\n\nRed Star Over Russia marked the unique character of his mature book-making: writing, designing, scanning the images, all from his own archive. His frequent collaborator, Judy Groves, tells how he laid all the pages out end to end on the floor of his studio, \u201ccoupling and uncoupling them like carriages of a train\u201d, until he was satisfied with a complete view of the story unfolding. He did not use a computer in designing, but he put the text, perfectly judged for length, in emails to the typesetter. Proofs of the typeset version were then taped in position with prints of the scanned images, printed to size.\n\nWhen King first went to Russia in 1970 and asked to see pictures of Trotsky, he was told there were none of \u201cthat fascist\u201d. He made the repeated response to his enquiries into a catchphrase, \u201cnot possible\u201d, uttered in a heavy Russian accent. But a diligent search in many countries eventually made an archive possible. By the time they came to do the book, Wyndham remarked that there were now more photographs of Trotsky than there were of Marilyn Monroe.\n\nKing\u2019s interest in constructivist artists led him to the studio of Alexander Rodchenko, who had died in 1956. Opening a book \u2013 he was there to look at the artist\u2019s book designs \u2013 was, he said, \u201clike looking on to the scene of a terrible crime\u201d. Rodchenko\u2019s grandson Alexander Lavrentiev explained that his grandfather had painted over the faces of \u201cenemies of the state\u201d: to have been found with them risked the attentions of Stalin\u2019s secret police.\n\nAcquiring visual records of those who had disappeared in the purges became a particular preoccupation for King. His revelations appeared in The Commissar Vanishes: The Falsification of Photographs and Art in Stalin\u2019s Russia (1997) and Ordinary Citizens: The Victims of Stalin (2003). For an exhibition, King enlarged the original passport-size photographs to more than three metres high, accompanied by captions from their card-indexed personal details.\n\nHorrifyingly powerful, the Commissar Vanishes exhibition travelled in Europe; at the launch of a follow-up project at the Gulag museum in Moscow in 2013, King told his audience that Trotskyist groups had willingly helped him, but with \u201cthe hilarious proviso\u201d that he shouldn\u2019t mention that he had talked to one group, because another would then refuse to see him. King\u2019s book was also the basis of an audiovisual collaboration with Michael Nyman, who \u201cde-faced\u201d an earlier work, The Fall of Icarus, to create a soundtrack to The Commissar Vanishes; it was first performed at the Barbican in London in 1999.\n\nFascism \u2013 The Most Evil Enemy of Women, a 1941 Soviet poster from David King\u2019s collection.\n\nOn his first visit to Russia, King had taken a camera. The Nikon F was recommended by McCullin, after four hours of instruction. King had several assignments from the Sunday Times Magazine, and could give his own photographs generous space in the layouts. A feature on Muhammad Ali in 1975 led to the photographic biography I Am King, published the same year.\n\nHe also became well known for his portraits of literary figures, Nadezhda Mandelstam and Jean Genet among them, later used on covers of the London Review of Books. During this period at the Sunday Times, for which he made some collage illustrations, King designed several record sleeves, including The Who Sell Out for the Who and Jimi Hendrix\u2019s Axis: Bold As Love (both 1967).\n\nIn the 1970s King began to develop a recognisable, but varied graphic style consisting of heavy rules \u2013 bands of black, five-pointed stars, and heavy sans-serif type, most often in upper case only. Working for the Anti-Nazi League, the Anti-Apartheid Movement and the National Union of Journalists, he claimed that he was trying to create a visual style for the left. His bold condensed capitals and heavy underlining survive in placards carried at demonstrations today.\n\nIn the 1980s he designed the first covers for City Limits, the new weekly alternative to Time Out, produced several posters for the Crafts Council and was art director of its bi-monthly magazine, Crafts. King was himself a craftsman: posters were designed full-size on a draughting desk, the photoset lettering and images pasted down with wax glue and the rules cut from paper with a scalpel. They were in black only; colour instructions for the printer were added on an overlay.\n\nKing\u2019s Anti-Nazi League badge: he said he was trying to create a visual style for the left\n\nHe rarely favoured full-colour half tones, but would use three or four flat colours for a brilliant effect. Ink colours were most often black and red, and images were often overprinted in both colours, which made them a reddish sepia. King\u2019s style suited David Elliott, director of the Museum of Modern Art Oxford (now Modern Art Oxford), who commissioned him to create catalogues and posters for the Soviet art exhibitions Alexander Rodchenko (1979), Vladimir Mayakovsky: Twenty Years of Work (1982) and Art Into Production: Soviet Textiles, Fashion and Ceramics 1917-1935 (1985). His work is celebrated in a current exhibition at the gallery, David King: Designs for Oxford (1979-1985).\n\nRodchenko\u2019s constructions were also the stimulus for simple furniture and a series of neo-constructivist wood sculptures which King began in a shed in his garden. Always generous, he gave away his own works and duplicates from his collection, and gave his time to encouraging others and sharing his enthusiasm. His legacy is the books, and the images which make history come alive.\n\nHe is survived by his partner, Valerie Wade, his children, Robin and Josephine, from an earlier marriage, and by two grandchildren."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/David", "page_content": "spouse Abigail spouse Bathsheba father Jesse son Absalom ...(Show more)\n\nTop Questions Where did David grow up? According to the Bible, David grew up in the rugged Judean hills around the Israelite town of Bethlehem, a few miles south of what was then the Canaanite stronghold of Jerusalem. At the time, Israel was threatened by other peoples in the region, especially the Philistines, who occupied the Mediterranean coastal plain to the west. What was David\u2019s early life like? David was the youngest of eight sons of Jesse, a farmer and sheep breeder of the Israelite tribe of Judah. David likely spent much of his boyhood tending his family\u2019s flock. One day he was summoned from the fields by the prophet Samuel, who anointed him king of Israel while Saul was still king. What did David do for a living? As a youth, David distinguished himself as a musician and warrior. This gained him the attention of King Saul, for whom he played the harp and fought the Philistines. David\u2019s popularity aroused the king\u2019s jealousy. After Saul tried to kill him, David fled and became a leader of outlaws. When Saul died, David became king. What did David achieve? As Israel\u2019s second king, David built a small empire. He conquered Jerusalem, which he made Israel\u2019s political and religious centre. He defeated the Philistines so thoroughly that they never seriously threatened the Israelites\u2019 security again, and he annexed the coastal region. He went on to become the overlord of many small kingdoms bordering Israel.\n\nDavid, (flourished c. 1000 bce), second ruler of the united kingdom of ancient Israel and Judah. He founded the Judaean dynasty and united all the tribes of Israel under a single monarch. His son Solomon expanded the empire that David built. David is an important figure in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.\n\nEarly life David slaying Goliath According to 1 Samuel, David was the youngest son of Jesse, a man of Bethlehem, and served as a shepherd for his father before beginning his career as an aide at the court of Saul, Israel\u2019s first king. When Israel came into conflict with the Philistines, a people from a neighbouring region, David\u2019s brothers went to fight for King Saul. Young David would travel back and forth to the camp to bring his brothers food and supplies. According to 1 Samuel 17, Goliath, a heavily armed Philistine giant, challenged Saul for 40 days to send out a man to fight him. No one would face this warrior until David, armed only with a sling and stones, volunteered. David hit the giant in the forehead with a stone and killed him. He continued to distinguish himself as a warrior in the ongoing battles against the Philistines, and his resultant popularity aroused Saul\u2019s jealousy. Fearing that the people would make David king, Saul plotted to kill him. With the help of his loyal friend Jonathan, Saul\u2019s eldest son, David fled into southern Judah and Philistia, on the coastal plain of Palestine, where, with great sagacity and foresight, he began to lay the foundations of his career. As an outlaw with a price on his head, David led the life of a Robin Hood on the desert frontier of his tribal domain in Judah (in the south of the Levant). He became the leader and organizer of a group of other outlaws and refugees, who progressively ingratiated themselves with the local population by protecting them from other bandits or, in case they had been raided, by pursuing the raiders and restoring the possessions that had been taken. Although the boy David was anointed by the prophet Samuel as the future king of Israel (1 Samuel 16), his actions in exile helped ensure that he would be \u201cinvited\u201d to become king as the true successor of Saul after Saul and Jonathan were slain in battle against the Philistines on Mount Gilboa."}]}
