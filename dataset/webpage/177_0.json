Tagged: Artist, Author.\n\n(1957- ) Canadian artist, now a resident of Switzerland. After formal training in France, he moved to Switzerland to work on an animated film and decided to remain there. He took on a variety of projects, but an invitation to join other artists in contributing to the 1987 and 1988 J R R Tolkien calendars changed his life. Admiring his approach to Tolkien, publishers then assigned Howe to illustrate books by Tolkien, as well as four additional Tolkien calendars (in 1991, 1995, 1997, and 2001). In 1997, when Peter Jackson began working on his three-part film version of The Lord of the Rings (1954-1955 3vols), Howe was hired to serve as the films' conceptual designer, also working as a carpenter on the films; he is now performing similar duties for Jackson's upcoming film trilogy based on The Hobbit (1937; rev 1951; rev 1966). His Tolkien artwork is not unlike that of his most famous predecessor, the Brothers Hildebrandt, though he is noted for his obsessive attention to detail in rendering medieval weaponry, contributing to the generally darker and more mature ambience of his paintings.\n\nOutside of his Tolkien-related work, Howe has done other book covers, almost exclusively for works of Fantasy, including books by Robin Hobb, Guy Gavriel Kay, and David A Gemmell. However, he did paint impressive covers for two paperback volumes of Robert Silverberg's collected stories, Pluto in the Morning Light (coll 1992) and The Secret Sharer (coll 1993), interestingly juxtaposing imagery from sf and fantasy and suggesting that he might have enjoyed equal success had he specialized in sf.

He started with The Two Towers, because \"everyone who started the first volume never got any further\" and The Fellowship of the Ring was rarely available to borrow.[4] He was inspired by artwork from The Brothers Hildebrandt to start creating illustration of Tolkien's works.[4]\n\nHowe's version of Boromir is based on his own face.[5]\n\nInvolvement in Peter Jackson's Middle-earth film series [ edit | edit source ]\n\nJohn Howe and Alan Lee worked as the chief conceptual designers on The Lord of the Rings trilogy.[6] Howe is also credited as a carpenter in the first two films.[6] [7] He has a cameo as one of the nine Kings of Men in the Prologue of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.

He was drawing from pre-school age, with his mother's help for his \"more ambitious renderings\". Around primary school age he found his mother's ability no longer living up to his expectations, and even got frustrated once at both his mother and himself at not being able to draw a cow to his expectations. Howe's school years were complicated by moves which took place with a timing that left the art classes full, and left him in classes like power mechanics. He did find his ability as a draughtsman to be profitable in biology class though, where he and a friend would produce renderings of microscopic organisms for classmates at fifty cents each. As a child, he collected the covers of paperbacks. His collection included items from Frank Frazetta, Barry Smith, and Bernie Wrightson. In his adolescence, Howe read The Lord of the Rings trilogy by J. R. R. Tolkien. He said he got \"a real spark\" from the Hildebrandt calendars, which showed him that the books could be illustrated. Howe made drawings of his own versions of the scenes depicted in the calendar. These drawings, according to Howe, may not have survived.\n\nA year after his high school graduation, Howe found himself in Strasbourg, France attending college. The following year, he enrolled into the \u00c9cole des arts d\u00e9coratifs. He cites his experience of this period as follows:\n\n\"The first year was spent not understanding much, the second at odds with what I did manage to understand, and the third eager to get out, although in retrospect I certainly owe whatever clarity of thought I possess to the patience of the professor of Illustration.\"\n\nThroughout his first years in Europe, Howe was taking in as much as he could in the way of art, architecture and everything that was \"simultaneously ancient and novel.\" He says the only piece of his art work that survived from this period is his \"The Lieutenant of the Black Tower of Barad-d\u00fbr\", a piece inspired by Tolkien's, The Lord of the Rings. He says if this is not his first published piece, it must certainly be the earliest. Howe's earliest commissions included political cartoons, magazine illustrations, comics, animated films, advertising, of which he says were nightmares. He said that he would end up redoing sketches so many times that there was nothing left of \"his\" in them. This frustrated him, and he wondered how he would ever make it in the profession.\n\nSince the earlier days of his career, Howe has managed to find his place in the profession of art. Working on such well-known projects as: The Lord of the Rings, J.R.R. Tolkien's Books and Merchandise, Beowulf, Robin Hobb's books, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, Cards for Magic: The Gathering, The Hobbit, Pan's Labyrinth. Howe has also written and illustrated children's books.\n\nSelected works\n\nThe Fisherman & His Wife, transl. from Brothers Grimm (Mankato MN: Creative Education, 1983).

Tolkien as well as working on both The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit film series. Most recently he has worked as a concept artist for The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power television series. [1]\n\nJohn Howe was born in Vancouver, Canada.[2] He graduated from the \u00c9cole des Arts D\u00e8coratifs of Strasbourg[2] in 1981, having obtained a Diploma in Illustration.[3] He now lives in Neuchatel with his wife Fataneh and his son Dana.[2]\n\nHowe first read The Lord of the Rings in high school, borrowing them from his school library. He started with The Two Towers, because \"everyone who started the first volume never got any further\" and The Fellowship of the Ring was rarely available to borrow.[4] He was inspired by artwork from The Brothers Hildebrandt to start creating illustration of Tolkien's works.[4]\n\nHowe's version of Boromir is based on his own face.[5]\n\nInvolvement in Peter Jackson's Middle-earth film series [ edit | edit source ]\n\nJohn Howe and Alan Lee worked as the chief conceptual designers on The Lord of the Rings trilogy.[6] Howe is also credited as a carpenter in the first two films.[6] [7] He has a cameo as one of the nine Kings of Men in the Prologue of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. Howe and Lee returned to work as conceptual designers for The Hobbit film series. They both make an uncredited appearance as a men-musicians of Laketown in The Desolation of Smaug.[8]\n\nArtwork theft [ edit | edit source ]\n\nIn the night of 18 May 1997, 11 of Howe's originals were stolen from the M\u00e9diath\u00e8que of Sedan in Belgium. The thief's father contacted the M\u00e9diath\u00e8que a couple weeks later promising to try to retrieve the stolen works from his son. 8 originals were finally returned, one (Minas Tirith) was damaged beyond repair. \u00c9owyn and the Nazg\u00fbl, Gandalf the Grey, and The Uruk-hai were never recovered.[9]\n\nPublished Artwork [ edit | edit source ]\n\nHowe is one of HarperCollins' most used artists, and his cover art is frequently featured on translations as well.\n\nMultiple editions [ edit | edit source ]\n\nCalendars and books [ edit | edit source ]\n\n\"Illustrating Tolkien means treading warily, dipping one's brush in shadow and rinsing them in light. Battle and balance, down the impossible path between the clear and the obscure.\" \u2015 John Howe on painting Middle-earth, Tolkien's World.\n\n\"It was this place in North Island, and we wandered round these fields saying, well, Bag End can go here, that can be our party tree; it was very exciting. It's almost even more fun to have a location imposed upon you, because you really have to get down to brass tacks and figure it out, imagine it on paper.

Howe grew up in British Columbia and moved to France to study illustration at the Ecoles des Arts D\u00e9coratifs de Strasbourg. Howe has been influential on fantasy visual language generally through his work on the Tolkien Mythos.\n\n\n\nThe most enduringly popular Middle-earth artist...his work has appeared in numerous books and calendars\u2026and earned him a role as a conceptual artist for Peter Jackson\u2019s The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings movies (Sisto and Marchese, 2022).\n\n\n\nThe image shown here was also created for a Tolkien work, his translation of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, an edition published by HarperCollins (1995) which features Howe\u2019s landscape as the jacket cover. Howe\u2019s image which depicts the confrontation at the Green Chapel; the place in the wilderness that Gawain has journeyed to in order to receive the return blow from the Green Knight\u2019s axe, emphasises the link between the Green Knight and nature. The figures are situated in verdant undulating land, the Green Knight is shown as a giant, seemingly an outcrop of the landscape as much as the large standing stones that define the mid-ground. For Gentile (2014) writing in Storytelling, Self, Society, Howe\u2019s image has resonance with the trope of the wild man generally, the description below fitting well with the broad, hirsute figure confronting Gawain in Howe\u2019s painting.\n\n\n\nThe idea of the Wild Man has also inspired artists\u2019 working images of the Green Knight, such as John Howe, whose illustration of the Wild Man/Green Knight appears on the cover of an edition of J. R. R. Tolkein\u2019s translation of the poem\u2026\u201cThe \u2018classic\u2019 Wild Man of the later Middle Ages,\u201d writes Malcolm Jones in Medieval Folklore, \u201cis covered in shaggy hair (except for face, hands, and feet), frequently wears a wreath of leaves around his head, and wields a club, usually a branch\u201d (433). Clearly, this description resonates significantly with the Green Knight, whose beard and long hair as well as his holly cluster all show some connection to the image of the medieval Wild Man (Gentile, 2014:234).\n\n\n\nThe diminished scale of Gawain in Howe's image compared to the Green Knight and the landscape combined with the atmospheric sky overhead reference deep time and the ways that nature at large dwarfs the constructed world of Arthur\u2019s court, symbolised in the pentangle on Gawain\u2019s shield, a geometric symbol for chivalric authority and moral standing.\n\n\u200b\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nGentile, J (2014) Shape-Shifter in the Green: Performing Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.

As a teen, he like to read what Tolkien wrote and started to create works based on Tolkien's Legendarium. Howe achieved much of his fame for his Fantasy Art by working as a chief conceptual designer along with Alan Lee for Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings. He has expertise in ancient and medieval armour and armaments, which influenced the way he portrays the medieval world in fantasy. Howe is also serving as a conceptual designer for Amazon's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.\n\nFroud's homepage can be found here .\n\nNotable Projects:"}, {"url": "https://quillandpad.com/2020/09/10/how-to-train-a-dragon-jaquet-droz-collaborates-with-john-howe-lord-of-the-rings-and-the-hobbit-illustrator-and-conceptual-artist/", "page_content": "Quill & Pad\u2019s Joshua Munchow would say that watchmaking and sci-fi/fantasy easily appeal to the same kind of person. But Joshua is not the only member of the Quill & Pad team to find joy in two such seemingly disparate subjects: I too am a nerd at heart.\n\nWhich is why the announcement of Jaquet Droz collaborating with John Howe both pleased me and made me realize that the two fit together far better than I imagined. Starting with Jaquet Droz\u2019s past in making androids \u2013 perhaps the science fiction items par excellence of their day \u2013 this brand is about as creative as it gets in our traditionally minded world of horology.\n\nWho is John Howe?\n\nJohn Howe, the Canadian-born book illustrator and conceptual artist, is best known as one of two chief conceptual designers for the Lord of the Rings film trilogy by Peter Jackson and The Hobbit trilogy. He has also illustrated other items based on the timeless story by J.R.R. Tolkien and other well-known genre classics like Game of Thrones and The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe.\n\nA conceptual artist is responsible for the style and look of a film. His or her sketches aid producers, programmers, and 3D artists in understanding how sets should look and the vibe should feel. The conceptual artist\u2019s sketches are vital to the cohesive development of a feature-length film.\n\nBorn in Vancouver, 63-year-old Howe has lived in Neuch\u00e2tel for 30 years. He moved to Europe after graduating from high school, beginning with a university experience in Strasbourg.\n\nHowe is currently busy working on the upcoming Lord of the Rings television series for Amazon Studios \u2013 according to reports, set to become the most expensive TV series ever \u2013 which began shooting in New Zealand in February 2020. It is expected to stream in 2021.\n\nHowe keeps a rather low profile, so this collaboration with the imaginative La Chaux-de-Fonds-based brand is one that I find eminently exciting.\n\nThe Jaquet Droz dials, as we\u2019ve shown before, do lend themselves very well to artistic endeavors outside \u201cusual\u201d watchmaking. This turn toward the fantasy world could be an immensely exciting collaboration, and not just for nerds like me.\n\nJaquet Droz collaboration with John Howe\n\nHowe\u2019s collaboration with Jaquet Droz marks the first time that he has been approached by a fine watch brand. From reports, Howe worked alongside the brand\u2019s own artisans in the creation of an as-yet not-disclosed timepiece or timepieces.\n\nIt will be exciting to discover what magical, mysterious ideas pop up on the dial of the next Petite Heure Minute or Ateliers d\u2019Art models, which constitute my guesses as to the canvas of the future Howe masterpiece(s). I just hope we don\u2019t have to wait too terribly long to see them!\n\n\u201cThe craftsmen and designers at Jaquet Droz strive to bring together precision, poetry, and light in their meticulous work when it comes to materials and movements, something I particularly appreciate,\u201d Howe said. \u201cThe technical constraints further stimulated reflection and creativity. Collaborating with Jaquet Droz, renowned for its great creativity, proved to be challenging \u2013 but most of all, a real pleasure.\u201d\n\nFor more on John Howe, please visit www.john-howe.com.\n\nYou may also enjoy:\n\nJaquet Droz Petite Heure Minute Tiger: So Lifelike You Expect It To Leap From The Dial\n\nJaquet Droz Loving Butterfly Automaton: Millions Of Years In The Making\n\nJaquet Droz Magic Lotus Automaton: Zen Serenity On The Wrist\n\nAll About Automata: Mechanical Magic (With Action Videos)\n\nJaquet Droz\u2019s Charming Bird Deconstruction By The Naked Watchmaker (Plus Video)"}, {"url": "https://www.howold.co/person/john-howe-illustrator", "page_content": "John Howe Canadian illustrator\n\nJohn Howe is a 65 years old Canadian illustrator from .

One year after graduating from high school, he studied in a college in Strasbourg, France, then at the \u00c9cole des arts d\u00e9coratifs in the same town.\n\nHe is best known for his work based on J. R. R. Tolkien's worlds. Howe and noted Tolkien artist Alan Lee served as chief conceptual designers for Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, and Howe also did the illustration for the Lord of the Rings board game created by Reiner Knizia. Howe also re-illustrated the maps of The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, and The Silmarillion in 1996\u20132003. His work is however not limited to this, and includes images of myths such as the Anglo Saxon legend of Beowulf (he also illustrated Knizia's board game Beowulf: The Legend). Howe illustrated many other books, amongst which many belong to the fantasy genre (Robin Hobb's books for instance.) He also contributed to the film adaptation of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe by C. S. Lewis. In 2005 a limited edition of George R. R.

He was drawing from pre-school age, with his mother's help for his \"more ambitious renderings\". Around primary school age he found his mother's ability no longer living up to his expectations, and even got frustrated once at both his mother and himself at not being able to draw a cow to his expectations. Howe's school years were complicated by moves which took place with a timing that left the art classes full, and left him in classes like power mechanics. He did find his ability as a draughtsman to be profitable in biology class though, where he and a friend would produce renderings of microscopic organisms for classmates at fifty cents each. As a child, he collected the covers of paperbacks. His collection included items from Frank Frazetta, Barry Smith, and Bernie Wrightson. In his adolescence, Howe read The Lord of the Rings trilogy by J. R. R. Tolkien. He said he got \"a real spark\" from the Hildebrandt calendars, which showed him that the books could be illustrated. Howe made drawings of his own versions of the scenes depicted in the calendar. These drawings, according to Howe, may not have survived.\n\nA year after his high school graduation, Howe found himself in Strasbourg, France attending college. The following year, he enrolled into the \u00c9cole des arts d\u00e9coratifs. He cites his experience of this period as follows:\n\n\"The first year was spent not understanding much, the second at odds with what I did manage to understand, and the third eager to get out, although in retrospect I certainly owe whatever clarity of thought I possess to the patience of the professor of Illustration.\"\n\nThroughout his first years in Europe, Howe was taking in as much as he could in the way of art, architecture and everything that was \"simultaneously ancient and novel.\" He says the only piece of his art work that survived from this period is his \"The Lieutenant of the Black Tower of Barad-d\u00fbr\", a piece inspired by Tolkien's, The Lord of the Rings. He says if this is not his first published piece, it must certainly be the earliest. Howe's earliest commissions included political cartoons, magazine illustrations, comics, animated films, advertising, of which he says were nightmares. He said that he would end up redoing sketches so many times that there was nothing left of \"his\" in them. This frustrated him, and he wondered how he would ever make it in the profession.\n\nSince the earlier days of his career, Howe has managed to find his place in the profession of art. Working on such well-known projects as: The Lord of the Rings, J.R.R. Tolkien's Books and Merchandise, Beowulf, Robin Hobb's books, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, Cards for Magic: The Gathering, The Hobbit, Pan's Labyrinth.

Government of the Republic of France statements from French to English \u2013\n\nSource: Canton of Neuchatel Switzerland\n\nA new space for exhibition, creation and innovation around the works of John Howe and fantastic imaginations will see the light of day in Neuch\u00e2tel in 2025. This project will materialize on the exceptional site of the former prisons in the heart of the old town. . The cantonal and municipal authorities, as well as the NIFFF and John Howe have come together to design an ambitious and unifying project.\n\nAt the crossroads of art, science and innovation, the \u201cLa Tour dufantastique\u201d project was unveiled today to the media in the heart of the disused prisons of the old town of Neuch\u00e2tel, a stone\u2019s throw from the Ch\u00e2teau.\n\n\u201cBringing together the Canton and the City of Neuch\u00e2tel, the NIFFF and the artist John Howe, La Tour brings life back to a place belonging to the canton and left unassigned for several years, serving a vision that brings together history and imagination, past and future, creation and innovation, dream and magic\u201d, indicated Laurent Kurth, State Councillor, Head of the Buildings Department, on behalf of the State which will make the building available to the project. This is the result of an exciting collaboration between the City and the Canton, united to develop contemporary creation and innovation. It will have taken several years to see this project mature, led by four partners and involving many actors.\n\nFor local, national and international audiences\n\nBringing together past, future and imagination, La Tour intends to break down barriers and bring together creation, economy and innovation in a space with high heritage value. The medieval tower, whose origins date back to the 10th century \u2013 one of the oldest buildings in Neuch\u00e2tel \u2013 will be linked by a footbridge to the prison corps, a building operated until 1996 with cells still visible, forming a place of evolving and technological exhibition devoted to the works of John Howe. \u201cThe project strengthens the place of the fantastic in Neuch\u00e2tel. The Tower targets a local, national but also international audience,\u201d explained Thomas Facchinetti, municipal councilor of the City of Neuch\u00e2tel, responsible for culture.\n\nJohn Howe, Neuch\u00e2telois of Canadian origin, is an international reference in terms of illustration of the work of JRR Tolkien. He was the general and artistic director of the screen adaptations of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, as well as, most recently, of the series The Rings of Power, whose second season is in the process of being created. Very committed to the project, the artist also sees it as a place of incubation for young talents: \u201cThese former prisons can no longer serve their original designation, but can accommodate reflection, the marvelous journey, the escape ; become a place of meeting, emulation and creation, to take advantage of all the skills present in the region. \u00bb\n\nArtistic incubation and innovation\n\nBecause a third building, attached to the former prison spaces, enters the scene, the one partly occupied by the administration of the NIFFF, and which will soon house, in addition to the administration of La Tour, artists\u2019 studios of \u201cconcept art \u2013 a register in which the artists illustrate an idea in a creative way for a realization on the screen. \u201cNeuch\u00e2tel already hosts one of the most important European festivals dedicated to the fantastic, it will soon host a plural space with, at its center, the work of John Howe, a major artist in the field of \u2018concept art'\u201d, declared to his tour Pierre-Yves Walder, artistic and general director of the festival. The NIFFF plans to create a point of contact between artists, screenwriters and authors. A concrete project will already see the light of day this summer, with a \u201cworldbuilding\u201d workshop which brings together French and Swiss artists on the premises of La Villa (la Petite Rochette) during the 22nd edition of the festival in July, and a presentation of the projects from this workshop in the fall.\n\nAnother major point of the project, innovation: to the creative abundance of La Tour will be added the potential of the regional ecosystem with universities and institutes as well as the impulses given by the \u201csmart city\u201d strategy of the City of Neuch\u00e2tel . \u201cInputs\u201d that can feed both innovative museography and technological projects, through exchanges between the private sector and the world of culture. \u201cThrough the networking of actors of culture, innovation and the economy, La Tour will be much more than an exhibition space\u201d, noted for his part the municipal councilor Didier Boillat, in charge of technological development, which will present a report on the \u201csmart\u201d strategy this year.\n\nGovernance by a foundation\n\nNext steps towards the realization of the project: the creation, by the four partners, of a foundation involving the world of innovation, which will be called upon to manage La Tour in a self-financed way thanks to admissions, but also in particular to sponsorship, rentals , shop and cafe. The latter, moreover, will enjoy a terrace with a view of the rooftops and the lake. The set-up phase will start in the second half of the year, with an opening scheduled for 2025.\n\nA year to remember for enthusiasts and the curious all over the world: \u201cI see La Tour as a new beginning, an opportunity to share passions for the fantastic, a gateway to the worlds of the marvelous, worlds that have always accompanied humanity,\u201d concluded John Howe.\n\nIllustration: The Tower and the Dragon (credit: John Howe).\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This article is a translation.

It lies in the central Jura Mountains and is drained by Lake Neuch\u00e2tel (leading to the Rhine) and Le Doubs River (leading to the Rh\u00f4ne). Its three regions are a low-lying strip along the lake called Le Vignoble (from its vineyards); an intermediate region, Les Vall\u00e9es, comprising the two principal valleys of the canton (the Ruz Valley, watered by the Seyon, and the Travers Valley, watered by L\u2019Areuse), which lie at an elevation of 2,300 feet (700 metres); and the highest region, the Neuch\u00e2teloises Mountains (3,000\u20133,500 feet [915\u20131,065 metres]), mainly composed of a long valley in which stand the industrial centres of La Chaux-de-Fonds, Le Locle, La Sagne, Les Ponts-de-Martel, and La Br\u00e9vine. Neuch\u00e2tel is the capital.\n\nNovum Castellum (Neuch\u00e2tel) was first mentioned in the will of Rudolf III, the last king of Burgundy, who died in 1032. About 1034 the town and its territories were granted in fief to Count Ulrich von Fenis, whose dynasty gradually increased its dominion, until by 1373 it held practically all the area of the present canton. In 1406 Neuch\u00e2tel entered into union with Bern. It passed in the early 15th century to the lords of Freiburg im Breisgau in the German Rhineland and in 1504 to the French ducal house of Orl\u00e9ans-Longueville. The Reformation was introduced there in 1530 by Guillaume Farel, the French preacher, and Neuch\u00e2tel became a principality in 1648. With the extinction of the house of Orl\u00e9ans-Longueville in 1707, the area passed to Frederick I, the first king of Prussia. The nominal role of the Prussian king lasted until 1848, with a brief interval from 1806 to 1814 when the principality was granted by Napoleon to his marshal, Louis-Alexandre Berthier. It was admitted to the Swiss Confederation in 1815 as the 21st canton and the only nonrepublican member, its hereditary rulers the last to maintain their position in Switzerland. A republican form of government was established by a peaceful revolution in 1848, and after long negotiations and several attempts at counter-revolution, including the so-called Neuch\u00e2tel crisis (1856), the king of Prussia renounced his claims to sovereignty in 1857.\n\nThe population is mainly French speaking and has a Protestant majority. In addition to excellent wineries, some fruit is grown in Le Vignoble, and horses are raised. There are pastures for cattle in the valleys, and some cheese is made. The most valuable mineral product is asphalt, concentrated in the Travers Valley. The most characteristic industry is watchmaking, which has been prominent since the early 18th century in the highland valleys of La Chaux-de-Fonds, Le Locle, and Fleurier; in 2009 La Chaux-de-Fonds and Le Locle together were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site. Other important manufactures include metal products, machines, and tobacco products. An oil refinery is located at Cressier. Road and rail communications are highly developed.

It serves as a meeting place where society\u2019s movers and opinion-makers can speak a shared language of change. In addition, members are able to have a say regarding future collections.\n\n\n\nA discreet, even secretive man, very much the artist and dreamer, John Howe draws his spellbinding talents from a mysterious wellspring of imagination. To celebrate the arrival of the fourth member of his club, Rodolphe Cattin had the pleasure of presenting him with a personalised engraving and a steel \"Le Semainier\" watch with quintuple date, a trademark piece of the Jura based manufacturer.\n\n\n\nThe pen of John Howe thus crosses that of Rodolphe, for his part a specialist in the world of watchmaking, who last year was responsible for the design of around seven million timepieces sold across the globe."}]}
