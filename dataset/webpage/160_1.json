He was a two-time All-American at Princeton, splitting time during his career between attack and midfield. Striebel helped the Tigers capture two NCAA championships during his career, winning the title in 1998 and 2001. He was also a part of four Ivy League championships, and earned All-Ivy honors three times (1999, 2000, 2001).\n\nStriebel played on three U.S. National Teams, helping to claim world championships in 2002 and 2010, and a runner-up finish in 2006. He also enjoyed a 13-year professional career in Major League Lacrosse, earning all-star honors nine times and All-Pro status in 2007 & 2008. He was a part of three MLL championships and was selected as the Championship Game MVP in 2007. He finished his MLL career with 225 goals, 120 assists, and 355 points, ranking among the top 10 all-time in each category.\n\nA product of Gill, Mass., Striebel was inducted into the US Lacrosse Western Massachusetts Chapter Hall of Fame in 2014."}, {"url": "https://premierlacrosseleague.com/articles/hall-of-fame-inductee-matt-striebel", "page_content": "A two-sport athlete at Princeton, Matt Striebel played lacrosse like a soccer player. In MLL offseasons, Striebel played three years of professional soccer from 2002-04 for the Western Massachusetts Pioneers of the USL Second Division.\n\n\u201cHis fitness level was just off the charts,\u201d said former Philadelphia Barrage head coach Tony Resch. \u201cHe could keep going and going. He had great speed. He could shoot it. Unselfish. All the things you look for in a midfielder, he had it.\u201d\n\nWhile Resch and most fans may remember Striebel as a lights-out shooter, that wasn\u2019t always the case. Prior to his senior year at Princeton, Striebel was an X attackman. When freshman Ryan Boyle stepped on campus, Striebel was moved above GLE \u2013 where, Boyle jokes, his shot couldn\u2019t break a paper bag.\n\n\u201cHe completely reinvented himself, starting with his senior year at Princeton moving from behind the cage out in front to midfield,\u201d said Boyle, who also played with Striebel on the Philadelphia Barrage. \u201cHis dedication to his craft is truly remarkable. Going from somebody who didn\u2019t really have much range to speak of at all to being somebody who you had to pick up at 16 yards\u2026 he was unguardable.\u201d\n\nThat work ethic led to a 171-game career. Striebel evolved to earn playing time on the \u201804 Barrage midfield unit featuring Blake Miller (46G, 11A), Roy Colsey (25G, 6T, 7A), Mike Mollot (11G, 8A), and Doug Shanahan (12G, 6A).\n\nStriebel stuck the eventual game-winning goal in the \u201804 MLL Championship for that Barrage squad. He did the same in \u201807 on a broken powerplay \u2013 Boyle\u2019s favorite shot of Striebel\u2019s 15-year pro career."}, {"url": "https://goprincetontigers.com/sports/2017/2/24/first-team-all-americas.aspx", "page_content": "All-Time All-Americans\n\nPRINCETON MEN'S LACROSSE\n\nALL-TIME ALL AMERICANS\n\n\n\n1922\n\nFirst Team\n\nEd Stinson Out Home\n\nHonorable Mention\n\nKen Dittmar First Attack\n\nBill Hubbell Point\n\n\n\n1923\n\nFirst Team\n\nKen Dittmar Second Attack\n\nThird Team\n\nOllie Alford Cover Point\n\nHonorable Mention\n\nNick Marden Out Home\n\nBill Hubbell Point\n\nBill Owen First Defense\n\nDick Shackelford Third Defense\n\n\n\n1924\n\nSecond Team\n\nKen Dittmar Second Attack\n\nHonorable Mention\n\nBill Hanna Attack\n\nBill Hubbell Defense\n\n\n\n1925\n\nThird Team\n\nHank Jeffers First Defense\n\nHonorable Mention\n\nBernie Thulin Home\n\nJohn Ballentine Point\n\n\n\n1926\n\nFirst Team\n\nHank Jeffers First Defense\n\nSecond Team\n\nBernie Thulin Out Home\n\nHank Parker In Home\n\nHonorable Mention\n\nBill Stevens Center Field\n\nJohn Ballentine Inside Defense\n\nAlfie Marshall Goal\n\n\n\n1927\n\nFirst Team\n\nBernie Thulin Out Home\n\nAlternates/First String\n\nJohn Schenk First Defense\n\nHonorable Mention\n\nHank Parker Attack\n\n\n\n1928\n\nAlternates/First String\n\nBill Scarlett Second Attack\n\nJohnny Stinson In Home\n\n\n\n1929\n\nFirst Team\n\nBill Scarlett Third Attack\n\nAlternates/First String\n\nJohnny Stinson In Home\n\nHonorable Mention\n\nTony Sessa Attack\n\nChas Buschmann Defense\n\nNew Lawler Defense\n\n\n\n1930\n\nFirst Team\n\nWalt Jenifer First Defense\n\n\n\n1932\n\nFirst Team\n\nArchie Brooks Goal\n\nHonorable Mention\n\nEd Schwab Wing Attack\n\n\n\n1933\n\nFirst Team\n\nArchie Brooks Goal\n\nEd Schwab In Home\n\nHonorable Mention\n\nTaylor Woodward Center Field\n\n\n\n1934\n\nFirst Team\n\nCharlie Ceppi Second Defense\n\nCharlie Wardell In Home\n\n\n\n1935\n\nFirst Team\n\nCharlie Wardell First Attack\n\nAlternate\n\nEddie Britten Goal\n\nHonorable Mention\n\nTony Rytina Inside Attack\n\nBuck Shea Wing Defense\n\nBill Bedell Inside Defense\n\n\n\n1936\n\nFirst Team\n\nEddie Britten Goal\n\nAlternate\n\nSam Robinson Point\n\nWalt Woodward First Attack\n\nHonorable Mention\n\nEd McLean Center\n\n\n\n1937\n\nFirst Team\n\nSam Robinson Point\n\nEd McLean Second Defense\n\nBud Dering Second Attack\n\nAlternate\n\nJake Classen First Defense\n\nHonorable Mention\n\nBobby Mueller Inside Attack\n\nWalt Woodward Wing\n\nPan Ralli Goal\n\n\n\n1938\n\nFirst Team\n\nHerb Foedisch Cover Point\n\nSecond Team\n\nSandy Ormond In Home\n\nThird Team\n\nBucky Turner Goal\n\nHonorable Mention\n\nBobby Mueller Inside Attack\n\nEddie Green Center\n\n\n\n1939\n\nSecond Team\n\nBucky Turner Goal\n\nBilly Lynn Cover Point\n\nHonorable Mention\n\nJack Higginbotham Wing\n\nEddie Green Wing\n\nLarry Naylor Wing\n\n\n\n1940\n\nFirst Team\n\nBucky Turner Goal\n\nJoe King In Home\n\nSecond Team\n\nScooter Stewart Point\n\nLarry Naylor Center\n\nHonorable Mention\n\nElmo Weisheit Inside Attack\n\n\n\n1941\n\nFirst Team\n\nTy Campbell Goal\n\nSecond Team\n\nElmo Weisheit Second Defense\n\nThird Team\n\nHowie Marshall.

Pioneers for a few years when it didn\u2019t conflict with his MLL schedule.\n\n\u201cI think the reason I\u2019ve been as successful as I have is because of the little things and the details,\u201d Striebel said Tuesday. \u201cBut I don\u2019t talk to them a lot about what I do.\u201d\n\nAs the Blue Devils move back to the Valley Wheel \u2013 with perennial powerhouses such as South Hadley, Minnechaug Regional and defending Western Massachusetts champion Longmeadow \u2013 after five years in the Valley League, it\u2019s helpful to have a coach that has himself mixed it up with the best around.\n\nAfter starting as a youth at Indoor Action Sports in Greenfield, Striebel was a two-time honorable mention All-America at Princeton. His collegiate career, as part of arguably the nation\u2019s best team in the late 1990s and early 2000s under coach Bill Tierney, ended with a victory over Syracuse in the 2001 title game. Striebel also played soccer for the Tigers.\n\nHe won three MLL titles in eight seasons with the Barrage, including the clinching goal against the Boston Cannons in 2004, and will return this spring for another season with the Rochester Rattlers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it now more than ever,\u201d Striebel said of his 12th MLL season. \u201cNow that I\u2019m coaching, I\u2019m itching to get back out there playing.\u201d\n\nStriebel\u2019s coaching experience includes a stint as an assistant at his alma mater and with the club team at Iowa, from where he received his master\u2019s degree. His coaching style borrows from all the coaches he\u2019s had.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had the best coaches in lacrosse,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cThe sincerest form of flattery is stealing things, copying things.\u201d\n\nThe Blue Devils (6-12 last year) return one first-team All-Scholastic selection from last season, senior midfielder Colin Sawula. The team captain netted 23 goals and 16 assists a season ago.\n\nSawula and fellow senior captains Jay Messer, Andy Kuon and Justin Golec all see a major difference already in what their new coach has been able to get out of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompared to last year, it\u2019s completely different,\u201d said Sawula, who has had three coaches in four years. \u201cWe\u2019re out there working hard every day. I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019ve run more this year than we have last year. I have really high hopes for this season.\u201d\n\nOne of those previous coaches, Bill Metzger, is back as an assistant, giving Northampton some continuity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely an experience,\u201d Messer said. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely prepared.\u201d\n\nStriebel observed the Blue Devils several times last season and noticed a team that just needed a spark to get it to reach its full potential and to change the feeling of mediocrity that the players had.\n\n\u201cI saw a team that could benefit from some coaching, some discipline and some plans,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cThe biggest thing is getting over the sense of this (losing) is who we are.\u201d\n\nThe Blue Devils are ready to respond.\n\n\u201cHe wants us to work hard, and we come out here every day to work hard,\u201d Kuon said. \u201cWe\u2019re determined.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://phillylacrosse.com/2014/look-back-top-25-mens-lacrosse-players-past-25-years-princeton-university/", "page_content": "Phillylacrosse.com, Posted 2/11/14\n\nBy Jerry Price, Princeton Sports Information Director\n\nThe following article was written by Jerry Price, Senior Associate Director of Athletics at Princeton University and the Athletic Communications contact for men\u2019s lacrosse, who created his list of the top 25 Princeton players of the last 25 years.

Price consulted a bit with a few people, but claims it as his own personal list.\n\n\n\nHonorable mention\n\nKyle Baugher\n\nPatrick Cairns\n\nScott Conklin\n\nJohn Cunningham\n\nBrad Dumont\n\nScott Farrell\n\nJohn Harrington\n\nAlex Hewit\n\nTodd Higgins\n\nZachary Jungers\n\nKurt Lunkenheimer\n\nMike Mariano\n\nTorr Marro\n\nAndy Moe\n\nTaylor Simmers\n\nScott Sowanick\n\nGreg Waller\n\nBecket Wolf\n\nWildcard\n\nMatt Striebel\n\nClass of 2001\n\nAttack/Midfield\n\nGill, Mass. Deerfield\n\nCurrently national director for Trilogy Lacrosse, as well as a professional and international player\n\nMatt Striebel earns wildcard status, somewhere between honorable mention and the top 25, because of the uniqueness of his lacrosse career. Striebel was an honorable mention All-America his senior year and was twice named All-Ivy League, and he ranks eighth all-time at Princeton with 74 career assists. He also moved as a senior from attack to midfield to make room for Ryan Boyle when he came to Princeton, and the move led to Princeton\u00b9s 2001 NCAA championship. Had Striebel never played after Princeton, he would have had a very good career. It\u00b9s what he\u00b9s done since Princeton that makes him a Hall-of-Fame player, as he has won multiple World and Major League Lacrosse Championships and is MLL\u00b9s all-time leader in games played. If the list included post-Princeton accomplishments, then Striebel would have moved into the top 10 or even top 5 of Princeton players in the last 25 years.\n\nNo. 25\n\nMark Kovler\n\nClass of 2009\n\nMidfield\n\nLandon School \u20ac Washington, D.C.\n\nCurrently a third-year medical student at George Washington University, with plans to become a surgeon\n\nMark Kovler was a first-team All-America middie as a senior in 2009, when he scored 34 goals and had nine assists. He was also a first-team All-Ivy selection as a sophomore and senior, and he was on his way as a junior until a broken ankle wiped out the last four games of the 2008 season for him. Even with that, he was honorable mention All-America as a junior and a third-team All-America as a sophomore. He stands 17th all-time at Princeton with 84 goals, which also ranks him second all-time at Princeton behind only Josh Sims among players who were strictly midfielders. Kovler\u00b9s biggest weapon as a scorer was his ferocious lefthanded shot.\n\nNo. 24\n\nJason Doneger\n\nClass of 2005\n\nAttack\n\nLynbrook High School \u20ac Hewlett, N.Y.\n\nCurrently heads up the U.S. convertible bond sales business for Barclays.\n\nJason Doneger ranks seventh all-time at Princeton with 105 career goals, including 36 as a junior and 41 as a junior, tying him for eighth all-time in a single season. Until Mike MacDonald\u2019s 43 goals last season, no\n\nPrinceton player had scored more in a season than Doneger\u00b9s 41 in 2004. He was an honorable mention All-America and two-time All-Ivy League selection as well.\n\nNo. 23\n\nMike MacDonald\n\nClass of 2015\n\nAttack\n\nTrinity Pawling \u20ac Georgetown, Ont.\n\nCurrently a junior on the Princeton men\u00b9s lacrosse team\n\nMike MacDonald, one of two active Princeton players on the list, has scored 65 goals in his first two seasons, and he trails only Jesse Hubbard and Chris Massey for most goals by a Princeton player after his sophomore year.\n\nA left-handed finisher, MacDonald scored 43 goals a year ago, the sixth-most ever by a Princeton player in a single season and the most by any Princeton player since Massey scored 45 in 1997. MacDonald, who scored seven goals against Cornell in the Ivy League tournament semifinals, was a first-team All-America and honorable mention All-America in 2013.\n\nNo. 22\n\nDan Cocoziello\n\nClass of 2008\n\nDefense\n\nDelbarton School \u20ac Oldwick, N.J.\n\nCurrently works in Project Management in the construction management industry in Manhattan and is also getting his master\u00b9s in real estate fromNYU\n\nDan Cocoziello began his career as the first defenseman to be named Ivy League Rookie of the Year and ended it as a first-team All-America. He started every game for his entire four-year career and was a second-team\n\nAll-America as a sophomore and junior in addition to his first-team selection senior year. He was a four-time All-Ivy selection, including unanimous first-team selections as a sophomore and senior and second-team selection as a junior.\n\nNo. 21\n\nDamien Davis\n\nClass of 2003\n\nDefense\n\nGilman School \u20ac Baltimore, Md.\n\nCurrently is Director and Portfolio Manager for Brown Capital Management in Baltimore, where he also coaches the defense for the Gilman School lacrosse team\n\nDamien Davis is one of the great defensemen in Princeton lacrosse history who, along with Cocoziello, started every game of his four-year career. In fact, his resume pretty closely mirrors that of Cocoziello, as he too was a\n\nfirst-team All-America as a senior after being second-team All-America as a sophomore and junior. He was also a unanimous first-team All-Ivy selection as a junior and senior, as well as a second-team selection as a sophomore\n\nand honorable mention selection as a freshman. His most famous moment came in the 2001 NCAA championship game, when he stripped Syracuse\u00b9s Mikey Powell of the ball in overtime to start the sequence that led to the game-winning\n\ngoal.\n\nNo. 20\n\nPeter Trombino\n\nClass of 2007\n\nAttack\n\nSt. Anthony\u00b9s \u20ac Huntington Station, N.Y.\n\nCurrently works in business development for CrowdSurge in Brooklyn, as well as a live music event promoter and marketer for Art For Progress, a non-profit that helps support local artists and funds art programs in New York City public schools; also plays club lacrosse in New York\n\nPeter Trombino is the only player in Princeton men\u00b9s lacrosse history to have at least 20 goals and at least 10 assists for all four seasons he played. He began his career by being named Ivy League Rookie of the Year after scoring at least one goal in all 15 games his freshman year, including the one in overtime to defeat Maryland in the quarterfinals and send Princeton to the Final Four. He was a second-team All-Ivy selection as a sophomore and junior and first-team selection as a senior, and he was an honorable mention All-America as a junior and senior. He ranks ninth all-time at Princeton with 98 career goals and 11th all-time at Princeton with 152 career points and finished his career two goals shy of joining Wick Sollers as the only palyers in program history with at least 100 goals and 50 assists.\n\nNo. 19\n\nChristian Cook\n\nClass of 1998\n\nDefense\n\nManual High School \u20ac Denver, Colo.\n\nCurrently is a professional staff member on the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. He also runs the Play for Parkinson\u00b9s Fall Lacrosse Series each year along with his sister to raise funds for the ProjectSpark\n\nFoundation, which raises funds to fight against Parkinson\u2019s.\n\nChristian Cook is one of the fastest defensemen Princeton has ever had, and he used his speed and tenacity to become a one of its best defensemen as well. After playing longstick midfield as sophomore, he moved to close\n\ndefense as a junior and became a first-team All-Ivy League and third-team All-America selection on Princeton\u00b9s perfect 1997 team. As a senior, he added a third championship ring while being named first-team All-America, as\n\nwell as first-team All-Ivy. His best game was probably the 1998 NCAA semifinal win over Syracuse, when he shut out Casey Powell and actually outscored him 1-0 with a goal of his own, before tearing his ACL in the final seconds. Even though he did not play two days later in the final, he was still named to the NCAA Final Four all-tournament team.\n\nNo. 18\n\nSean Hartofilis\n\nClass of 2003\n\nAttack\n\nSt. Anthony\u00b9s \u20ac Huntington, N.Y.\n\nCurrently is writing and directing movies with his company Walls Farms Pictures, and his first feature Beach Pillows was released last week\n\nSean Hartofilis ranks third all-time at Princeton with 126 career goals, trailing only Jesse Hubbard (163) and Chris Massey (146). Of his 126 goals, he scored 27 in nine NCAA tournament games, and he ranked seventh all-time\n\nin Division I in NCAA tournament goals in a career when he graduated. He began his career with 20 goals as a freshman, including five against Virginia in Princeton\u00b9s NCAA semifinal win, and he ended his career by scoring 41 goals as a senior, making him one of eight Princeton players to reach 40 for a season. He was a three-time All-Ivy League selection, with first-team honors as a sophomore and senior, and was a two-time All-America.\n\nNo. 17\n\nLorne Smith\n\nClass of 1999\n\nAttack/Midfield\n\nGilman School \u20ac Baltimore, Md.\n\nCurrently is a strategic account manager for Warrior Lacrosse. He is also the owner of Lorne Smith Lacrosse, which runs camps and the Marin Lacrosse Club, and a guitar player with Lorne and the Wayhighs.\n\nLorne Smith came to Princeton as an attackman at the same year that Jesse Hubbard, Chris Massey and Jon Hess were sophomores. So what did he do? He moved to midfield and became a first-team All-America while winning three\n\nNCAA championships, with an assist to Hubbard on the game-winner in overtime in the 1996 final. He is tied for 12th all-time at Princeton with 94 career goals despite playing most of his career as a middie, and he had 31 goals as a senior when he finally moved to attack. He was a first-team All-Ivy League selection as a sophomore and senior, and he was a second-team pick as a junior. He was a three-time All-America, with a first-team selection in 1997 and second-team selections in 1998 and 1999.\n\n\n\nNo. 16\n\nChad Wiedmaier\n\nClass of 2012\n\nDefense\n\nDelbarton School \u20ac Chatham, N.J.\n\nCurrently is a marketing associate for Trilogy Lacrosse\n\nOf all of the great players who have played lacrosse at Princeton, only one has been a first-team All-Ivy League selection four times \u00ad Chad Wiedmaier. He began his career by becoming the first Princeton defenseman to be\n\nfirst-team All-Ivy, and he went on to repeat that selection each season, including his sophomore year, even though he missed the first six games due to a knee injury. Even with that, he was also a second-team All-America as a\n\nsophomore. In fact, he was an All-America each of his four seasons, with second-team All-America selections as a freshman and sophomore, a third-team selection as a junior and then a first-team selection as a senior. His\n\nbattles against Cornell\u00b9s Rob Pannell were epics and cemented his reputation as one of the great cover defenders in Ivy League lacrosse history.\n\nNo. 15\n\nB.J. Prager\n\nClass of 2002\n\nAttack\n\nGarden City \u20ac Garden City, N.Y.\n\nCurrently the head of Exchange Traded Funds for Barclays. He also plays club lacrosse in the summer.\n\nB.J. Prager ranks fifth all-time at Princeton with 118 career goals, a figure that would have been higher \u00adand almost surely would have left him in third \u2013 had he not missed the final seven games of his sophomore year\n\nafter tearing his ACL. Of all of his goals, the biggest came in overtime on Memorial Day 2001 against Syracuse, giving Princeton its sixth NCAA championship and earning him Most Outstanding Player honors after a seven-goal, eight-point tournament. Prager had a career 49.6 shooting percentage, finishing his career with 118 goals on 238 shots, or one goal away from shooting 50%. He was a three-time first-team All-Ivy League selection and a three-time All-America (second-team once, third-team twice). At one point he scored at least one goal in 31 straight games, the second-longest streak in school history, and his eight goals against Hobart his senior year tie him for the second-highest single-game total. He had four goals against Syracuse in the 2001 NCAA final and five goals against Hopkins in the 2002 semifinal win.\n\nNo. 14\n\nScott Reinhardt\n\nClass of 1994\n\nMidfield\n\nWest Genesee HS \u20ac Camillus, N.Y.\n\nCurrently works as, in his words, \u00b3president, secretary, CFO, janitor and anything else that needs to be done,\u00b2 for Passive Capital Management, an investment company he co-founded. Passive Capital Management has offices in\n\nSyracuse and Baltimore.\n\nScott Reinhardt is one of the great two-way midfielders ever to play at Princeton, as well as one of the most clutch. He finished his career with 76 goals, but he scored 18 of those in NCAA tournament games, including four in\n\nthe 1994 semifinals, when Princeton avenged a regular season loss to Brown en route to its second NCAA championship. A key member of the 1992 and 1994 NCAA champions, he was a second-team All-America and first-team All-Ivy League selection as a junior, when he scored 19 goals for the second straight year despite missing five games in mid-season with a broken bone in his leg. He finished his career with a 30-goal, 35-point season that earned him first-team All-America honors, and first-team All-Ivy honors for the second time.\n\nNo. 13\n\nRyan Mollett\n\nClass of 2001\n\nDefense\n\nBoys Latin \u20ac Taneytown, Md.\n\nCurrently is managing director of the hedge fund group for GSO Capital Partners, part of the Blackstone Group. He still plays lacrosse once a year in a master\u00b9s tournament in Lake Placid as part of a team of Princeton alums.\n\nRyan Mollett was part of one of the most enduring moments of the 2001 NCAA championship game, when his caused turnover against Mikey Powell got Princeton the ball back to start the winning possession. Princeton might never have gotten to the final that year had it not been for Mollett, whose caused turnover and assist snapped a tie game and gave Princeton a 12-11 win over Towson in the semifinal. For Mollett, it was a completely dominant\n\nsenior year, from start to finish, with two goals, four assists, 60 ground balls and a completely intimidating presence on a team that allowed 5.8 goals per game, not only the lowest total for a Princeton team in the modern\n\nera but also the lowest total in the modern era for any Ivy League team (and fourth all-time in Division I). Mollett was a first-team All-Ivy League selection as a junior as well, when he was also named honorable mention\n\nAll-America. Among his other achievements was being the first ever selection in the first Major League Lacrosse draft.\n\nNo. 12\n\nTrevor Tierney\n\nClass of 2001\n\nGoalie\n\nHun School \u20ac Princeton, N.J.\n\nCurrently is the president (and founder) of LXTC Lacrosse Trainer Center in Denver, running camps, clinics, teams and tournaments out of the University of Denver. He is also the president of the National Scholastic Club Lacrosse\n\nAssociation and is pursuing his master\u00b9s degree in psychology through the Harvard Extension School.\n\nTrevor Tierney was a brick wall in goal during his Princeton career, with career numbers of a .652 save percentage and 6.65 goals-against average that are just extraordinary. In face, Tierney\u00b9s 6.65 career goals-against ranks\n\nsecond all-time in Division I in the modern era. He had a career .600 save percentage when it mattered most, in NCAA tournament games. His first big performance was a six-save, one-goal-against performance in the final 37:58\n\nagainst Duke in the 1998 NCAA quarterfinals, when Princeton erased an 8-4 deficit to rally for an 11-9 win. He went on to make 15 saves in the 2000 NCAA finals and then finish his career with a 14-save performance in the\n\n10-9 win over Syracuse in the 2001 final. He led Division I in goals against (5.70) and save percentage (.671) as a senior, when he was first-team All-America and first-team All-Ivy League. He was honorable mention in both as a junior.\n\nNo. 11\n\nJustin Tortolani\n\nClass of 1992\n\nAttack\n\nManhasset HS \u20ac Manhasset, N.Y.\n\nCurrently is a spine surgeon in Baltimore, as well as Director of Research and Education at Union Memorial Hospital Department of Orthopedic Surgery and an adjunct member of the faculty at the John Hopkins School of Medicine.He has coached youth lacrosse and is also involved with his wife Kim Simons, a former Princeton great who is the head coach of the U.S. U-19 team.\n\nJustin Tortolani came to Princeton as the recruit around whom an entire program was rebuilt and a dynasty was created. He left as the school\u2019s all-time leading goal-scorer and as an NCAA champion, not to mention one of\n\nthe great student-athletes who ever played Division I lacrosse. A two-time first-team All-Ivy League selection who was an honorable mention All-America as a junior and third-team All-America as a senior, Tortolani led Princeton\n\nin goals scored in 1990, 1991 and 1992. He graduated with 120 career goals, which at the time was the most in school history (and now ranks fourth). He also had 20 career NCAA tournament goals in six games, and his 3.2 goals per game are the most by a Princeton player in NCAA tournament games. He also graduated with a 3.71 grade-point average in molecular biology and was a two-time Academic All-America. He graduated from Cornell University medical\n\nschool.\n\nNo. 10\n\nTyler Fiorito\n\nClass of 2012\n\nGoalie\n\nMcDonogh School \u20ac Phoenix, Md.\n\nCurrently on the institutional equity sales desk at UBS. He also won a Major League Lacrosse championship last summer with the Chesapeake Bayhawks.\n\nTyler Fiorito is one of the greatest goalies in Ivy League history and one of the great leaders the Princeton program has seen. He is the only Princeton goalie ever to be named the Ivy League Player of the Year ,which\n\nhe won unanimously his senior year, and he was a three-time first-team All-Ivy League selection, the last two of which were unanimous. He was also named an All-America all four of his seasons. He began his career with a\n\nsecond-team All-Ivy and honorable mention All-America freshman year, and he was third-team All-America as a sophomore and second-team as a junior and senior. He finished his career with a great 12-save performance in a 6-5\n\nloss to Virginia in the NCAA tournament, and he sits second all-time at Princeton in saves with 624.\n\nNo. 9\n\nJosh Sims\n\nClass of 2000\n\nMidfield\n\nSevern School \u20ac Edgewater, Md.\n\nCurrently is the Senior Category Manager, Lacrosse, for Under Armour, as well as working with Athlete Prep, providing a technology platform empowering high level academic, athletic and college planning tools for student-athletes.\n\nJosh Sims, with his combination of size, speed, power and intensity, is one of the great midfielders in NCAA history. He is a three-time first-team All-America who also won the MacLaughlin Award as the top midfielder in\n\nDivision I as a sophomore in 1998 and a senior in 2000. He ranks eighthall-time at Princeton with 103 career goals and is the only Princeton midfielder ever to reach the 100-goal mark for his career. He is also 16th all-time at Princeton with 141 career points, which rank second behind Tom Schreiber for a Princeton middie. Sims is the only Princeton player ever to score an overtime goal in his first game, which he did as a freshman against Johns Hopkins. He scored 36 goals as a senior to lead Princeton to the NCAA championship game after winning NCAA titles as a freshman and sophomore. His 17 NCAA tournament goals tie him for sixth-best all-time at Princeton. He\n\nwas also a three-time first-team All-Ivy League selection, and he is the only player in program history to win the NCAA\u00b9s prestigious Top VIII Award.\n\nNo. 8\n\nChris Massey\n\nClass of 1998\n\nAttack\n\nGarden City \u20ac Garden City, N.Y.\n\nCurrently an attorney working in wealth management at Morgan Stanley in Boston. He also was a long-time MLL player who won a championship with the Lizards.\n\nChris Massey ranks second all-time at Princeton with 146 career goals, and his streak of 46 straight games with at least one goal is the second-longest in school history. He also is second all-time at Princeton and eighth in\n\nDivision I history with 31 career NCAA tournament goals. With 46 career assists, he finished his career with 192 career points, which ranks fifth all-time at Princeton. He is the only player in school history to reach at\n\nleast 45 goals in a season twice, with 46 goals as sophomore and 45 as a junior. He was a three-time All-America (third-team twice, second-teamonce), and he also won a Major League Lacrosse championship with the Long Island Lizards.\n\nNo. 7\n\nTom Schreiber\n\nClass of 2014\n\nMidfield\n\nSt. Anthony\u00b9s \u20ac East Meadow, N.Y.\n\nCurrently a senior on the Princeton men\u00b9s lacrosse team.\n\nTom Schreiber, the second of two active members on the Princeton men\u2019s lacrosse team in the top 25 along with Mike MacDonald (No. 23), is being judged on his first three seasons. Even without playing one minute of his\n\nsenior year, Schreiber is already one of the all-time greats at Princeton and in the Ivy League. Known for his ability to shoot with either hand and for his ridiculous field vision, he is Princeton\u2019s career leader for points\n\nby a midfielder with 149 (76 goals, 73 assists), and he would be the first player in program history to reach 90 goals and 90 assists, let alone 100 and 100. He is a three-time first-team All-Ivy League selection and would\n\nbecome the second Princeton player and fourth Ivy player to be first-team all-league four times, and he has already been a two-time first-teamAll-Americas, as well as a McLaughlin Award winner as the top midfielder in\n\nDivision I. He was the No. 1 overall selection in the 2014 MLL draft and wasa Tewaaraton Trophy finalist a year ago.\n\nNo. 6\n\nJon Hess\n\nClass of 1998\n\nAttack\n\nNyack \u20ac Upper Nyack, N.Y.\n\nCurrently works in finance for Caprok Capital and also serves as the president of the Friends of Princeton Lacrosse.\n\nJon Hess was the quarterback of Princeton\u00b9s attack during the most glorious three years the program has known, when Princeton won the NCAA championship his sophomore, junior and senior years of 1996-98 and went 43-2 overall and 18-0 in the Ivy League. Hess finished his career third all-time at Princeton with 215 career points, and his 133 assists rank third all-time at Princeton behind Kevin Lowe and Ryan Boyle. His 48 assists in 1997 tie him with Boylefor the school single-season record, and his 74 points that year are are the school record. He was a first-team All-America as a junior and senior and first-team All-Ivy selection as a sophomore and junior, as well as the 1997 Ivy League Player of the Year and the Most Outstanding Player of the 1997 NCAA tournament. He is tied for first all-time at Princeton in NCAA tournament points with Jesse Hubbard with 43, and his 28 assists are the\n\nmost ever by a Princeton player in the NCAA tournament.\n\nNo. 5\n\nDavid Morrow\n\nClass of 1993\n\nDefense\n\nBrother Rice HS \u20ac Troy, Mich.\n\nCurrently the CEO/Founder of Warrior Lacrosse, as well as a founder of Major League Lacrosse. He is also Chairman of the Board for Brother Rice High School Lacrosse and a coach for the Michigan Warriors club team.\n\nDavid Morrow is the best defenseman ever to play at Princeton and one of the best ever to play college lacrosse. He came from Michigan at a time when lacrosse wasn\u00b9t nearly as widespread nationally as it is today, and he used\n\nthat \u00b3outsider\u00b2 mentality as a motivation every time he stepped on the field. Whatever he used, it worked, as Princeton has had few if any players who brought his level of ferocity and intensity to the game. Morrow was the\n\n1993 Lt. Enners Award winner as the national player of the year, which makes him still to this day the last defenseman to win the award. He was a two-time first-team All-America and three-time first-team All-Ivy League\n\nselection, as well as a two-time winner of the William Schmeisser Award as the top defenseman in Division I. As a junior he helped Princeton to its first NCAA championship, with an epic performance in the 16-14 win over\n\nNorth Carolina in the semifinals, when he shut out the Tar Heels top attackman and scored not one but goals of his own. A World Champion with the U.S. national team, he has also done as much as anyone to bring the sport of\n\nlacrosse into its modern era as the founder of Warrior Lacrosse and Major League Lacrosse. Warrior Lacrosse, named for the nickname of Brother Rice High School, revolutionized the sport, with its use of titanium sticks to\n\nreplace the old wooden ones and an appeal to youth players that has helped make the sport fun for players from all over the country.\n\n\n\nNo. 4\n\nRyan Boyle\n\nClass of 2004\n\nAttack\n\nGilman School \u20ac Baltimore, Md.\n\nCurrently the CEO of Trilogy Lacrosse and a player for the Boston Cannons in Major League Lacrosse, as well as a color analyst for lacrosse for ESPN and a columnist for Lacrosse Magazine.\n\nRyan Boyle is a lacrosse savant and a great natural athlete who is one of the best field generals the sport has ever seen. He is known for being an additional coach on the field, for having incredible vision and for being a\n\nwinner on every level. Boyle made his presence known immediately, as his assist freshman year in overtime against Syracuse on Memorial Day gave Princeton its sixth NCAA championship. He ended up career with 233 career\n\npoints (and with at least one point in every game he ever played) and 162 career assists, both of which are second all-time at Princeton. He was a first-team All-America as a senior and junior, a second-team All-America as\n\na sophomore and a third-team All-America as a freshman, as well as a three-time first-team All-Ivy pick. He is also the only Princeton player to be the Ivy League Player of the Year more than once, as he won the honor in\n\n2002 and 2004. As a junior he equaled the school record for assists in a season with 48 (tying Jon Hess); as a senior he willed Princeton to the NCAA Final Four with his most famous individual performance, with two goals to\n\ntie the score in the final minute of regulation and then an assist to win it in overtime as the Tigers rallied to defeat Maryland in the quarterfinals. Boyle would play in 10 NCAA tournament games and put up 37 points, with 12\n\ngoals and 25 assists. He went on to win multiple Major League Lacrosse and World Championships, and he is the all-time leader in points and assists in MLL history.\n\nNo. 3\n\nKevin Lowe\n\nClass of 1994\n\nAttack\n\nMineola HS \u20ac Williston Park, N.Y.\n\nCurrently a bond trader for Credit Suisse, as well as a board member for the Cougar Lacrosse Club in Chatham, N.J.\n\nKevin Lowe is one of the greatest feeders and most accomplished players in the history of the sport of lacrosse, and he put up numbers at Princeton that have yet to be challenged despite all of the great players who have\n\ntried. He is Princeton\u00b9s career leader in points, the 247th and last of which was a goal that came in overtime against Virginia on Memorial Day his senior year of 1994, giving Princeton its second NCAA title. Lowe, who had\n\nat least one point in every game he played and led Princeton is points each of his four years, is also Princeton\u00b9s career leader in assists with 174. Of all the great players who have played at Princeton since, no player has come\n\nwithin 15 points or 12 assists of Lowe, and only two have come within 36 points or a remarkable 75 assists. Lowe won the Turnbull Award as a senior as the top attackman in Division I, and he was a three-time All-America,\n\nwith a first-team honor as a senior and second-team honors as a sophomore and junior. He was also a three-time first-team All-Ivy League selection and the 1994 Ivy League Player of the Year, as well as a second-team All-Ivy\n\nselection as a freshman. He averaged three points per game in nine NCAA tournament games, with nine goals and 18 assists for 27 points. He went from Princeton to Major League Lacrosse, where he scored an overtime goal in the\n\n2003 championship game for the Long Island Lizards, making him the only player ever to score an overtime goal in the NCAA final and MLL final. Lowe, who also won a World Championship with the United States team in the 2002\n\nevent in Australia, was inducted into the USILA Hall of Fame in 2009.\n\nNo. 2\n\nScott Bacigalupo\n\nClass of 1994\n\nGoalie\n\nSt. Paul\u00b9s School \u20ac Baltimore, Md.\n\nCurrently head of Americas cash equities trading and sales trading for Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. He also is coaching the kindergarten through second grade girls team.\n\nScott Bacigalupo graduated from Princeton in 1994 and never played lacrosse again, famously saying then and now that he would never be able to top his Princeton experience. His time at Princeton wasn\u00b9t perfect, but it came pretty close. A three-time first-team All-America (which makes him a three-time winner of the Ensign Kelly Award as the top goalie in Division I) and three-time first-team All-Ivy selection, Bacigalupo won the Lt. Enners Award as the outstanding player in Division I his senior year. Bacigalupo was the Ivy League Rookie of the Year in 1991, a season that ended with his 20-save performance in a triple-overtime loss to Towson in the NCAA quarterfinals, after which he guaranteed that Princeton would never lose another OT game on his watch. From there, the Tigers were 5-0 in overtime games before he graduated, with three of them in the NCAA tournament and two of them in the NCAA championship games of 1992 and 1994. Princeton went 7-2 in NCAA tournament games in his four years, winning its first two NCAA championships and reaching the Final Four his junior year as well. Bacigalupo made at least 15 saves in five of his nine career NCAA tournament games, and his 732 career saves are 112 more than any other goalie in program history. He was inducted into the USILA Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\nNo. 1\n\nJesse Hubbard\n\nClass of 1998\n\nAttack\n\nSt. Alban\u00b9s School \u2013 Washington, D.C.\n\nCurrently the founder of Motive Pure, a beverage company focusing on electrolyte hydration. He also runs the Jesse Hubbard Lacrosse Experience summer camp.\n\nJesse Hubbard brought with him a power and presence that simply dominated the rest of Division I lacrosse. The possessor of a laser for a shot, Hubbard\u00b9s theory was to go after the opposing goalie\u00b9s strength that was listed in the scouting report, figuring if he could beat his strength, he could do anything he wanted. He is the premier goal scorer in program history, and he actually had more career games with three or more goals than he did with fewer than three. His final total was 163 career goals, a figure 17 more than the next-highest total and 37 more than the third-best. He also holds the school single-season record with 53, set in 1996. He set a then-Princeton freshman record with 23 goals as a midfielder his freshman year, earning Ivy League Rookie of the Year honors, before changing positions for the rest of his career. During his three years as a starter on attack, Princeton went 43-2 overall and 18-0 in the Ivy League and won the NCAA championship each year. In fact, Princeton from 1996-98 remains the last team to win three straight NCAA titles. Hubbard scored in overtime against Virginia in the 1996 NCAA championship game, and he had four goals in both the 1997 and 1998 NCAA final wins over Maryland. He holds the school record for goals in NCAA tournament games with 33 (in 11 games), and his 43 career NCAA points are tied for the most in program history. He went on from Princeton to win a World Championship with the U.S. in 1998, and he would also become the career leader in goals in Major League Lacrosse history when he retired (though his record has since been broken). Hubbard was inducted into the USILA Hall of Fame in 2012."}, {"url": "https://www.usalaxmagazine.com/usa-insider/senior-men/hall-of-fame-call-a-final-victory-for-the-versatile-matt-striebel", "page_content": "Nine lacrosse legends \u2014 Ryan Boyle, Charlie Coker, Kara Ariza Cooke, Rachael Becker DeCecco, Sarah Forbes, Cathy Reese, Paul Schimoler, Richard Speckmann and Matt Striebel \u2014 will be inducted into the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame Oct. 19 at The Grand Lodge in Hunt Valley, Md. These are their stories.\n\nMatt Striebel was out to lunch with his wife and two kids, and then he saw his phone ring. He didn\u2019t recognize the number, so he let it go straight to voicemail, as one does.\n\nThe message, he quickly realized, was from US Lacrosse. It was right around the annual giving time for the men\u2019s national team, Striebel said, so he called back to let them know his check was ready to be sent out.\n\nBut on the other line was Rick Lake, men's game senior manager at US Lacrosse. His message was a tad different.\n\n\u201cHe goes, \u2018Matt, we're actually calling you to let you know made the Hall of Fame,\u2019\u201d the Gill, Mass., native recalled. \u201cIt was an amazing moment that was made doubly better that I found out I was going in with Ryan (Boyle). As soon as I hung up that phone call, I called Ryan and was like, \u2018This is crazy. Can you believe it?\u2019 It was the perfect, poetic bookend to a journey of our playing careers.\u201d\n\n\"We tried to coexist for two games, then I went into the coach's office and they basically looked at me and said \u2018Striebs, it's been a great run. How about you try midfield?\" \u2014 Matt Striebel describing a meeting Bill Tierney his senior year.\n\nStriebel is one of nine set for the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame\u2019s Class of 2019, entering with his close friend, Boyle \u2014 a fellow champion at Princeton, with the U.S. national team and in Major League Lacrosse. They now work together at Trilogy Lacrosse, the company Boyle co-founded, though their roots extend back to 2001 at Princeton.\n\nThe Tigers, then coached by fellow Hall of Fame member Bill Tierney, had Boyle entering as a blue-chip recruit down on attack. Striebel, a captain and returning All-American on attack, was excited by playing with a player of his quality. Plans went another direction, though.\n\n\u201cWe tried to coexist for two games, then I went into the coach's office and they basically looked at me and said \u2018Striebs, it's been a great run. How about you try midfield?,\u2019\u201d said Striebel, who gave himself 24 hours to sulk before embracing his new role.\n\n\u201cI decided it's my senior year, I really want to win and am here to win a national championship. From a lacrosse standpoint, it's the best thing that could have happened to me, because I am more of a midfielder talent-wise and it made us a better team and opened opportunities on the U.S. team and as a professional.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not hyperbole from Striebel, either. That 2001 season marked Striebel\u2019s second national championship while at Princeton, as well as a fourth straight Ivy League championship. On the national stage, he captured gold at the World Lacrosse championships in 2002 (Perth) and 2010 (Manchester), plus silver in 2006 (Ontario).\n\nStriebel also secured three MLL championships (2004, \u201806, \u201807) with the Philadelphia Barrage, earning earning MLL All-Star honors on nine occasions. Boyle was right there at nearly every step.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m far happier for him than I am for myself,\u201d Boyle said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI often say there are some guys out there who are A-plus in a couple categories. Oh, he's an A-plus shooter or an A-plus dodger,\u201d Striebel began. \u201cFor me, I think I just had the versatility to be B-plus, A-minus guy in a lot of different categories. That allowed me to change and adapt my game as I got older.\n\n\u201cThe first 10 years I was in the MLL, I think I took one two-point shot and it was on an open goal when we needed goal differential for the playoffs. Then as I got older, like a basketball player who's adding a different aspect, I became more of a shooter so I could develop other parts of my game and maintain relevance as a player.\u201d\n\nBut like most great players, Striebel\u2019s connection with the game didn\u2019t cease once he put away the pads and cleats. He\u2019s spent the last seven years coaching at Northampton High School in Massachusetts, plus working for Trilogy. He\u2019s especially close with coaches in the Colonial Athletic Association, so he\u2019ll often swing by nearby UMass-Amherst to catch games and chat with old friends.\n\nThose experiences also remind Striebel of his time at Hotchkiss, in Lakeville, Conn., during the mid-1990s. He said that was the \u201cdawn of the post-graduate lacrosse era\u201d at New England prep schools, where he played alongside several NHL draft picks.\n\n\u201cYou had kids who played multiple sports at a very high level,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cThere were great athletes and for better or for worse, lacrosse has become a 365-day endeavor where kids have an opportunity to play every day.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://trilogylacrosse.com/our-staff/matt-striebel/", "page_content": "\u201cI play lacrosse because I love it\u2014the speed, the intensity, the teamwork, the sense of fulfillment and satisfaction that comes when success is achieved over and through adversity. At Trilogy Lacrosse, we approach the teaching and coaching of lacrosse with the same passion and commitment to excellence that we bring to our play. Nowhere else can you find a community of lacrosse players and coaches so dedicated to the singular values of the game.\u201d\n\nDuring his career Matt was among the most elite class of lacrosse players in the world. At his peak he was widely considered the best midfielder in the game. His unique combination of athleticism, versatility, and intelligence set him apart as a dynamic playmaker and offensive force. A champion at every level of the game, Matt set professional records in All Star appearances and games played, while compiling one of the most impressive statistical careers for a midfielder ever. His vast knowledge and passion for the game of lacrosse distinguish him as a Trilogy instructor. His energy is contagious and quickly picked up by his players. When not coaching lacrosse, Matt can be found playing pick-up basketball in high school gyms across America.

This countdown has been one man's opinion. The top 25 is certainly debatable, and clearly the top spots are as well. Hopefully you've enjoyed it.\n\nHere are the top five:\n\nNo. 5\n\nDavid Morrow\n\nClass of 1993\n\nDefense\n\nBrother Rice HS \u2022 Troy, Mich.\n\nCurrently the CEO/Founder of Warrior Lacrosse, as well as a founder of Major League Lacrosse. He is also Chairman of the Board for Brother Rice High School Lacrosse and a coach for the Michigan Warriors club team.\n\nDavid Morrow is the best defenseman ever to play at Princeton and one of the best ever to play college lacrosse. He came from Michigan at a time when lacrosse wasn't nearly as widespread nationally as it is today, and he used that \u201coutsider\u201d mentality as a motivation every time he stepped on the field. Whatever he used, it worked, as Princeton has had few if any players who brought his level of ferocity and intensity to the game. Morrow was the 1993 Lt. Enners Award winner as the national player of the year, which makes him still to this day the last defenseman to win the award. He was a two-time first-team All-America and three-time first-team All-Ivy League selection, as well as a two-time winner of the William Schmeisser Award as the top defenseman in Division I. As a junior he helped Princeton to its first NCAA championship, with an epic performance in the 16-14 win over North Carolina in the semifinals, when he shut out the Tar Heels top attackman and scored not one but goals of his own. A World Champion with the U.S. national team, he has also done as much as anyone to bring the sport of lacrosse into its modern era as the founder of Warrior Lacrosse and Major League Lacrosse. Warrior Lacrosse, named for the nickname of Brother Rice High School, revolutionized the sport, with its use of titanium sticks to replace the old wooden ones and an appeal to youth players that has helped make the sport fun for players from all over the country.\n\nNo. 4\n\nRyan Boyle\n\nClass of 2004\n\nAttack\n\nGilman School \u2022 Baltimore, Md.\n\nCurrently the CEO of Trilogy Lacrosse and a player for the Boston Cannons in Major League Lacrosse, as well as a color analyst for lacrosse for ESPN and a columnist for Lacrosse Magazine.\n\nRyan Boyle is a lacrosse savant and a great natural athlete who is one of the best field generals the sport has ever seen. He is known for being an additional coach on the field, for having incredible vision and for being a winner on every level. Boyle made his presence known immediately, as his assist freshman year in overtime against Syracuse on Memorial Day gave Princeton its sixth NCAA championship. He ended up career with 233 career points (and with at least one point in every game he ever played) and 162 career assists, both of which are second all-time at Princeton. He was a first-team All-America as a senior and junior, a second-team All-America as a sophomore and a third-team All-America as a freshman, as well as a three-time first-team All-Ivy pick. He is also the only Princeton player to be the Ivy League Player of the Year more than once, as he won the honor in 2002 and 2004. As a junior he equaled the school record for assists in a season with 48 (tying Jon Hess); as a senior he willed Princeton to the NCAA Final Four with his most famous individual performance, with two goals to tie the score in the final minute of regulation and then an assist to win it in overtime as the Tigers rallied to defeat Maryland in the quarterfinals. Boyle would play in 10 NCAA tournament games and put up 37 points, with 12 goals and 25 assists. He went on to win multiple Major League Lacrosse and World Championships, and he is the all-time leader in points and assists in MLL history.\n\nNo. 3\n\nKevin Lowe\n\nClass of 1994\n\nAttack\n\nMineola HS \u2022 Williston Park, N.Y.\n\nCurrently a bond trader for Credit Suisse, as well as a board member for the Cougar Lacrosse Club in Chatham, N.J.\n\nKevin Lowe is one of the greatest feeders and most accomplished players in the history of the sport of lacrosse, and he put up numbers at Princeton that have yet to be challenged despite all of the great players who have tried.

The play called for him to hand off the football off to an electrifying running back named Darnell Stewart. He knew it. They knew it.\n\nBoyle audibled to a tight end post and fired a spiral deep down the middle for a completion.\n\nHe was 10.\n\n\u201cIt sounds so archaic. It\u2019s so obvious,\u201d Boyle said, remembering 27 years later the lessons he learned playing Pop Warner football. \u201cYou just have to have the gumption to call the play.\u201d\n\nBoyle never lacked for nerve, that\u2019s for sure. Combined with a rare intellect, his confidence produced one of the most brilliant lacrosse careers we\u2019ve ever seen. Boyle was a four-time All-American at Princeton and five-time MLL All-Star, and he played in three world championships for the U.S. national team.\n\nOn Saturday, Boyle will be inducted into the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame at a ceremony at the Grand Lodge in Hunt Valley, Md., just minutes from his childhood home. Matt Striebel, Boyle\u2019s teammates at all three levels (college, pro and international), will share that stage, each as the other\u2019s presenter.\n\n\u201cYou hear people talk about Ryan\u2019s game and compare him to Peyton Manning or Steve Nash because of how he plays the game, how he distributes, how he reads the defense, how he reads the offense or how he understands the game,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t get at the depth of the impact that he has on really making guys around him better.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the proverbial Renaissance man.\u201d\n\nStriebel learned that the hard way in 2001, when a highly touted freshman out of Baltimore\u2019s Gilman School supplanted him as Princeton\u2019s go-to attackman behind the goal. Striebel played soccer in the fall. He had heard of Boyle, but upon first glance at the 5-foot-11, 180-pound wunderkind that spring, he wondered what all the hype was about.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018This is the guy? This is the guy that\u2019s going to take my job away from me?\u2019 He\u2019s an unassuming person,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cAnd then you see him on the field. I had to go through jealousy and envy to get to respect and admiration with Ryan.\u201d\n\nStriebel and Boyle were like oil and water as attack line mates. Striebel often ran around without rhyme or reason, at least not that which Boyle could comprehend. After two games, Princeton coach Bill Tierney and offensive coordinator Dave Metzbower ended the experiment.\n\n\u201cCoach T and Coach Metz brought me into the office and say, \u2018Hey Striebs, you\u2019ve had a great run. We\u2019re moving you to midfield,\u2019\u201d Striebel said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTierney famously called Boyle the smartest player in the game. That didn\u2019t happen accidentally. It happened through osmosis.\n\nGrowing up in Cockeysville, Md., Boyle said, he had access to the sport\u2019s best educators, \u201cregardless if it was rec, club or my brother [Michael] in the backyard.\u201d That only continued at Gilman with John Tucker and Princeton with Metzbower, transcendent offensive minds.\n\n\u201cI was learning what a rocker step was before there was even a term rocker step. Metz and I were experimenting with two-man games at goal line extended before the term razor pick was invented,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cI enjoyed the technical aspect, their passion for exploration, to dabble and do something different.\u201d\n\nBoyle continued with football through high school, twice earning Baltimore All-Metro honors and setting the league record for completion percentage. He gravitated toward the dark room where the offensive coordinator, also his middle school science teacher, would break down film with him.\n\nThere were rumors Boyle would play both sports at Princeton, but lacrosse was his true calling. As the No. 1 recruit in the country, he lived up to the billing, leading the Tigers to an NCAA championship as a freshman in 2001. Boyle assisted B.J. Prager\u2019s game winner in overtime to beat Syracuse in the final.\n\nBoyle went on to become a four-time All-American at Princeton. He was a Tewaaraton finalist as a senior in 2004, when he strapped the Tigers onto his shoulders and carried them to the final four. Princeton trailed Maryland by two goals with two minutes left in the NCAA quarterfinals. Boyle scored twice unassisted, including the equalizer with 12 seconds remaining, then set up Peter Trombino for the game-winning goal in overtime.\n\n\u201cAnyone who doubts the size of Ryan Boyle\u2019s heart hasn\u2019t been around him for four years,\u201d Tierney said then.\n\nAdded Boyle: \u201cThe thought that this might be the end of my career never entered my mind.\u201d\n\nBoyle played on U.S. teams in 2002, 2006 and 2010, earned NLL and MLL Rookie of the Year honors and won four MLL titles with the Philadelphia Barrage and Boston Cannons.\n\nThat beautiful mind of his now imparts knowledge on fans as a college lacrosse and Premier Lacrosse League analyst for ESPN and NBC Sports, respectively, and on the next generation of stars with Trilogy Lacrosse, which he co-founded in 2005 with his former Gilman and Princeton teammate, Rob Lindsey.\n\n\u201cA huge part of why I\u2019ve been able to enjoy any success within the sport is the culture I grew up in,\u201d Boyle said, \u201cboth in my nuclear family and the community around me.\u201d\n\nAsked about Boyle\u2019s ability to see plays develop and calmly orchestrate others in the most stressful of circumstances, if it\u2019s innate or a byproduct of Boyle\u2019s environment as he suggested, Streibel said it\u2019s a little bit of both.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve met Ryan\u2019s parents. I know that it\u2019s nurtured,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cYet I also have this image of Ryan being born into the hospital, organizing all the little babies into the appropriate way to break down a zone defense or run a 1-3-2, telling them they should go here for dinner if they\u2019re in the East Village or that they should watch this if they have the time.\u201d"}], "Matt Striebel was a member of the 2001 NCAA championship team.": [{"url": "https://www.usalacrosse.com/player-profile/matthew-striebel", "page_content": "Striebel was inducted as a truly great player.

These are their stories.\n\nMatt Striebel was out to lunch with his wife and two kids, and then he saw his phone ring. He didn\u2019t recognize the number, so he let it go straight to voicemail, as one does.\n\nThe message, he quickly realized, was from US Lacrosse. It was right around the annual giving time for the men\u2019s national team, Striebel said, so he called back to let them know his check was ready to be sent out.\n\nBut on the other line was Rick Lake, men's game senior manager at US Lacrosse. His message was a tad different.\n\n\u201cHe goes, \u2018Matt, we're actually calling you to let you know made the Hall of Fame,\u2019\u201d the Gill, Mass., native recalled. \u201cIt was an amazing moment that was made doubly better that I found out I was going in with Ryan (Boyle). As soon as I hung up that phone call, I called Ryan and was like, \u2018This is crazy. Can you believe it?\u2019 It was the perfect, poetic bookend to a journey of our playing careers.\u201d\n\n\"We tried to coexist for two games, then I went into the coach's office and they basically looked at me and said \u2018Striebs, it's been a great run. How about you try midfield?\" \u2014 Matt Striebel describing a meeting Bill Tierney his senior year.\n\nStriebel is one of nine set for the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame\u2019s Class of 2019, entering with his close friend, Boyle \u2014 a fellow champion at Princeton, with the U.S. national team and in Major League Lacrosse. They now work together at Trilogy Lacrosse, the company Boyle co-founded, though their roots extend back to 2001 at Princeton.\n\nThe Tigers, then coached by fellow Hall of Fame member Bill Tierney, had Boyle entering as a blue-chip recruit down on attack. Striebel, a captain and returning All-American on attack, was excited by playing with a player of his quality. Plans went another direction, though.\n\n\u201cWe tried to coexist for two games, then I went into the coach's office and they basically looked at me and said \u2018Striebs, it's been a great run. How about you try midfield?,\u2019\u201d said Striebel, who gave himself 24 hours to sulk before embracing his new role.\n\n\u201cI decided it's my senior year, I really want to win and am here to win a national championship. From a lacrosse standpoint, it's the best thing that could have happened to me, because I am more of a midfielder talent-wise and it made us a better team and opened opportunities on the U.S. team and as a professional.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not hyperbole from Striebel, either. That 2001 season marked Striebel\u2019s second national championship while at Princeton, as well as a fourth straight Ivy League championship. On the national stage, he captured gold at the World Lacrosse championships in 2002 (Perth) and 2010 (Manchester), plus silver in 2006 (Ontario).\n\nStriebel also secured three MLL championships (2004, \u201806, \u201807) with the Philadelphia Barrage, earning earning MLL All-Star honors on nine occasions. Boyle was right there at nearly every step.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m far happier for him than I am for myself,\u201d Boyle said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI often say there are some guys out there who are A-plus in a couple categories. Oh, he's an A-plus shooter or an A-plus dodger,\u201d Striebel began. \u201cFor me, I think I just had the versatility to be B-plus, A-minus guy in a lot of different categories. That allowed me to change and adapt my game as I got older.\n\n\u201cThe first 10 years I was in the MLL, I think I took one two-point shot and it was on an open goal when we needed goal differential for the playoffs. Then as I got older, like a basketball player who's adding a different aspect, I became more of a shooter so I could develop other parts of my game and maintain relevance as a player.\u201d\n\nBut like most great players, Striebel\u2019s connection with the game didn\u2019t cease once he put away the pads and cleats. He\u2019s spent the last seven years coaching at Northampton High School in Massachusetts, plus working for Trilogy. He\u2019s especially close with coaches in the Colonial Athletic Association, so he\u2019ll often swing by nearby UMass-Amherst to catch games and chat with old friends.\n\nThose experiences also remind Striebel of his time at Hotchkiss, in Lakeville, Conn., during the mid-1990s. He said that was the \u201cdawn of the post-graduate lacrosse era\u201d at New England prep schools, where he played alongside several NHL draft picks.\n\n\u201cYou had kids who played multiple sports at a very high level,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cThere were great athletes and for better or for worse, lacrosse has become a 365-day endeavor where kids have an opportunity to play every day.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://trilogylacrosse.com/our-staff/matt-striebel/", "page_content": "\u201cI play lacrosse because I love it\u2014the speed, the intensity, the teamwork, the sense of fulfillment and satisfaction that comes when success is achieved over and through adversity.

Now Boyle is in a cab, unhappy about the route being taken to the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\n\"Which way are you going?\" he asks.\n\nThe answer, given in either an Eastern European or Middle Eastern dialect, is not to Boyle's liking.\n\n\"What are you doing? We could already have been there.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" the accent says, \"you'd like to fly there? Maybe you'll drive and I'll sit back there?\"\n\nMatt Striebel is apologetic.\n\nThe sounds coming through the phone now suggest rain, heavy rain. Striebel explains that he's in the car, driving through \"a torrential New England rain,\" and hopes that he can be heard. He thinks otherwise, and for that, he's sorry.\n\nWindshield wipers slosh back and forth as Striebel's voice races, going much faster, presumably, than the car. He talks college basketball, throws out the name of a mutual friend, asks about life in general, all to the metronomic cadence of the wipers.\n\nThe conversation with each lasts about 20 minutes, and they talk about the other for maybe 10 of those 20 minutes.\n\nThey are two of the best players in the history of the sport of lacrosse, Matt Striebel and Ryan Boyle are, sure-fire Hall-of-Famers one day. In a sport where there has been a direct correlation between the marketing of its superstars and an unimaginable explosion of the game in the last 10 years, there haven't been too many players who have been more in the eye of the hurricane than Striebel and Boyle.\n\nThey are lacrosse icons, instantly recognizable and awe-inspiring on any field where kids are carrying sticks.\n\nThey are lacrosse winners with few equals. They each have won six major lacrosse championships, on the collegiate, professional and international levels. Each time one has won such a title, the other was on the team. Without the other, they are ringless.\n\nThey are teammates. They are in business together. They are like brothers, these two, something that, in their own quite distinct styles, they scream out during their 20 minutes on the phone.\n\nAnd yet, it all could have been so much different.\n\nThere could have been resentment. There could have been disappointment. There could have been anger. There could have been none of those shared championships.\n\nThey could have been enemies.\n\nIt's been 10 years since their first championship, accomplished on Memorial Day 2001, when both were members of the 2001 Princeton men's lacrosse team that won the sixth NCAA title in school history.\n\nTheir 20 minutes on the phone a decade later are a reminder of just how amazing that championship was - and how remarkable their story is.\n\nThe final seconds of the 2000 NCAA championship game were ticking away as Ryan Powell sprinted from the goal to the Syracuse bench at Byrd Stadium on the campus of the University of Maryland. This day belonged to the Orange, and the final score of 13-7 doesn't really capture how much this game was never in doubt.\n\nEarlier that season, Syracuse had destroyed Princeton 16-4 at the Class of 1952 Stadium. It would be the most lopsided loss of Bill Tierney's 22 years at Princeton.\n\nThere is no question that Syracuse was the better team in 2000, and it wasn't really all that close. In two meetings, the Orange outscored Princeton 29-11.\n\n\"We were missing something,\" Striebel says. \"We were one piece shy of being a championship team. And that piece was Ryan.\"\n\nExcept for one problem. Striebel was an honorable mention and second-team All-Ivy League attackman, and he led the Tigers in assists in 1999 and 2000. In addition, he was a senior captain on a team coming off an NCAA championship game appearance.\n\nAnd then, from the Gilman School in Baltimore, came Boyle. Princeton has had an army of great players in its history, but it has never had anyone with the charisma of Ryan Boyle.\n\nHe's a great athlete and lacrosse player, to be sure, but his best quality might be his unmatched vision, which enables him to get the ball to the right person at the right time almost without fail. Well, that, and his lacrosse IQ, which might be the highest in the history of the sport.\n\nBill Tierney, then the Princeton coach, has called him a \"lacrosse savant;\" Striebel, while driving through the rain, calls Boyle \"tough\" no fewer than 11 separate times.\n\nBeyond that, he has the looks and persona of a movie star or rocker. When he walks into the room - or huddle - everything else stops.\n\n\"I know Ryan pretty well,\" Striebel says. \"There's an aspect of Ryan's persona that is sort of like Peyton Manning, where he's the quarterback and he's all business. But there's a toughness about him that people underestimate. Look at his career indoors. You wouldn't peg him as a guy who would thrive in that league. I've never played with someone who gets physically beaten up the way he does, but he always gets up. That competitiveness, that fight, translates into leadership. He's the one who steps in and says 'this is what we're going to do; this is how it's going to be,' and you just believe him. He's a tough little bastard, and that's where it all starts.\"\n\nBoyle speaks confidently, but he also speaks softly. He thinks about what his answer is going to be before he gives it. He chuckles moderately when he says something funny and then moves on.\n\nEven when the cab driver is going the long way, he doesn't raise his voice too much. Instead, he's questioning the decision to go this particular route, explaining other options, with just a hint of aggravation in his voice.\n\nStriebel speaks faster, much, much faster. He probably says three times as many words in a minute than Boyle does. He pauses only to laugh uproariously at what he's said - or perhaps at what he's heard - and then continues. With Boyle, the humor is more subtle - \"kids dream of scoring the game-winning goal, perhaps not necessarily assisting on it,\" he says - whereas with Striebel, the laughs come charging directly at you.\n\nHe changes subjects on a dime, and he speaks with complete passion about whatever that minute's subject is. Then, in another second, it's on to the next.\n\nBoyle refers to Striebel as \"very, very close to my heart\" and says \"I love him dearly.\" Striebel calls Boyle \"the dude who used to struggle to get to practice on time\" and says it to mean exactly what Boyle said about him.\n\n\"Even though they appear to be an odd couple,\" Tierney says, \"what they really are is the confluence of one guy who's passion is ridiculous and one who's knowledge is even more so.\"\n\nThey are definitely men with different personalities. A little over a decade ago, they were two college kids with different personalities - who happened to play the same position.\n\n\"It really wasn't much of a decision,\" Tierney says. \"We tried them together in the fall, and I've never seen two great players get more in each other's way. Plus, B.J. was healthy, and we had [Sean] Hartofilis and Brendan [Tierney], who had started the year before.\"\n\nStriebel was a soccer player at Princeton as well, so he missed most of the fall practices anyway. Plus, it didn't take long for it to be clear that Boyle's was a special talent.\n\n\"With any team I'm on, and Ryan is the same way, I just want to win,\" Striebel says. \"I realized quickly that Ryan was the guy who'd be instrumental in making us win. When they told me they were bumping me to midfield, I said 'let's do it if it's going to make us win.' \"\n\nHad he said something like \"but I've been an All-America at that position and it's the only one I know how to play,\" it might have all been different.\n\nOr, if he said to the coaching staff \"okay\" and to every other senior \"who's this freshman think he is,\" it likewise could have been a disaster.\n\n\"Our biggest worry was how Matt would handle it,\" Tierney says. \"It's easy to look back now and see how it all worked out, but really, going back to the moment, knowing Matt Striebel, we had the assumption that he'd handle it like he did everything else, which was to do whatever he needed to for the good of the team.\"\n\nIf the move bothered him, he never let on.\n\n\"The fact that accepted it the way he did was incredible,\" Boyle says. \"It speaks volumes about his character and leadership. It takes a special kind of person to move over so some freshman punk can take over. It takes a special kind of person to accept that and move forward.\"\n\nThe team that opened the season against Johns Hopkins started Boyle on attack and Striebel at midfield. Boyle had four assists in the game, and Princeton won 8-4.\n\nStriebel looks back on it in typical - for him - fashion.\n\n\"It could have gone really badly,\" Striebel says. \"But hey, I'm better suited to be a midfielder anyway. Now if they moved me to the bench instead, I might not have liked it.\"\n\nPrinceton went 11-1 during the 2001 regular-season, with only another relatively big loss to Syracuse - 14-8 at the Carrier Dome in the fourth game of the year - and then beat Loyola 8-7 in the quarterfinals at Hofstra and Towson 12-11 on a late Hartofilis goal to reach the championship game. Waiting there would of course be Syracuse.\n\nFrom the 1999 NCAA tournament through the 2001 final, Princeton was 0-4 against Syracuse and 25-1 against all other teams.\n\n\"Our confidence level was high going into the game,\" Boyle says. \"We had made some adjustments strategically. Mostly, though, it was the neutral site. When they play in front of the big crowd cheering them on, it's easier to perform. This wasn't a contained arena with solid attendance cheering them on.\"\n\nNo, this was at Rutgers Stadium, 20 minutes from the Princeton campus.\n\n\"We won the semifinal game, and we were going to go back to Princeton to practice,\" Tierney says. \"A bunch of the seniors came to me, and one of them, I think it was Ryan Mollett, said that we didn't need to practice. He said to just give them the plan and they'll carry it out, and that's exactly what they did. We changed a lot of things overnight. We played things differently.\"\n\nIronically, the biggest issue for Princeton heading into the game wasn't physical at all. After four consecutive losses, including three straight that weren't competitive, Princeton had to convince itself that it could win the game.\n\nStill, as Boyle said, this wasn't going to be in a \"contained arena,\" which of course, meant he was referring to the Carrier Dome, Syracuse's intimidating home field.\n\nUnlike a normal college lacrosse facility, the Dome is just that, a dome, an indoor building, one with silver seats that make picking up the ball difficult - at least the ones that aren't occupied by one of the sport's most passionate fan bases.\n\nIf Princeton had anything going for it heading into the 2001 final, it was the knowledge that the regular season game had been in the Dome and therefore was largely irrelevant.\n\n\"It was all psychological,\" Tierney says. \"When you play them in the Dome, it's a whole different ball of wax. We had confidence. We had beaten everyone else we'd played. We knew we'd played poorly at Syracuse earlier. It was just a matter of mentally believing we could do it.\"\n\nPrinceton trailed Syracuse 10-2 at halftime of the 2000 regular-season game at Class of 1952 Stadium before falling 16-4. The 2000 NCAA final saw Syracuse go up 6-0 before Princeton finally scored. The Tigers trailed at various times by 6-1 and 11-4 in the 14-8 regular-season loss at the Carrier Dome in 2001.\n\nIn the NCAA championship game, though, Princeton finally was able to play from ahead. Brad Dumont scored 2:44 into the game, and Striebel had a goal and assist in the first quarter to make it 3-0. It became 4-0 before SU scored, and the Tigers would lead 5-3 at intermission as Striebel scored again.\n\n\n\nBy the end of the third quarter, Princeton led 8-4, as Striebel had his second assist and Boyle had his first assist. With 15 minutes to go, Princeton was in complete control.\n\n\"Mostly, I remember random details about the game,\" Striebel says. \"Like the Princeton socks. We all had to wear these traditional Princeton socks, but for that game, I cut my socks and wore lower ones. I remember feeling so prepared for that game and so confident that all of superstitions went out the window.\"\n\nPrinceton in 2001 had two gifted shortstick defensive middies, Kyle Baugher and Winship Ross, and both would figure in what happened that day.\n\nBaugher broke his arm in the semifinal game and couldn't play in the final, but he still had an impact.\n\n\"Kyle Baugher gave a great talk to the team in the lockerroom before the game,\" Striebel says. \"I remember going out after that thinking that this was going to be ours. And then we got off to this blistering start. It was almost a giddy feeling.\"\n\nHad Princeton fallen behind, there's almost no way it would have been able to get over the psychological hurdle, so getting off to the good start was a must. Otherwise, it might have turned into another rout.\n\n\"Brad had a few early inverts,\" Boyle says. \"That's exactly what we'd talked about. We ran some crease plays to free up B.J. [Prager]. Defensively, I remember we didn't slide as much. We didn't create offense for them. We felt we matched up well enough against them.\"\n\nSyracuse, of course, had no intention of giving up.\n\n\"To their credit,\" Boyle says, \"they recognized the kind of game it was and realized they'd have to execute six-on-six. And to their credit, they did.\"\n\nEven with the lead at four after 45 minutes, Princeton wasn't able to start celebrating.\n\n\"I knew they'd make a run,\" Boyle says.\n\nSyracuse needed less than half the fourth quarter to tie the game at 8-8. Spencer Wright started the comeback just 21 seconds into the fourth quarter, and that goal seemed to knock Princeton out of its comfort zone. Mikey Powell - then a freshman and known as Michael - scored his first of the day, and Brian Solliday made it 8-7 with 10:03 left. The tying goal came from Wright with 7:40 left.\n\nPrinceton would get a 30-second man-advantage opportunity a minute later, and Boyle made it count, feeding Prager from up top to the crease for a nice catch and turnaround shot that made it 9-8 with 6:13 left, which is an eternity.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Syracuse would outshoot Princeton 19-5, but Trevor Tierney made two big saves in the final minutes, including one that led to a clear with less than a minute left. Ross, the great shortstick D-middie, then did the unimaginable - he ran into the box and immediately out of it, giving possession back to the Orange with 34 seconds left. With 26 seconds left, SU got the ball across midfield and called timeout.\n\nOnly one person touched the ball after that, and it was Powell, who dodged All-America defenseman Damien Davis and bounced a shot past Tierney to knot it at 9-9 with 16 seconds left and force overtime.\n\n\"I don't think I've ever watched the tape,\" Tierney says. \"When I got back to that, I don't do it on tapes. I do it on memories. The memories are so vivid.\"\n\nSyracuse had forced the overtime and appeared to have all the momentum, not to mention the best face-off man in college lacrosse, Chris Cercy. Still, Tierney wasn't panicking between the end of regulation and the start of the overtime.\n\n\"That timeout was memorable,\" Tierney says. \"Mostly because I had to stop Trevor and Mollett from killing Winship.\"\n\nWhile Tierney was playing peacemaker, Boyle had other thoughts.\n\n\"I knew it wasn't going to be a five-goal win for us,\" he says. \"I knew it was going to be one goal. Mikey made a great play at the end of regulation. But Damien was such a warrior, and I knew if they went at him again, the next one would be Damien's. I was thinking that all we had to do was score one goal and we'd win a national championship. That's how I looked at it. You always hear about how every possession is important, but that's a clich\u00e9. Here, it was a really true.\"\n\nIf Boyle was being logical, Striebel was being his own usual self, which meant being emotional.\n\n\"I remember standing there thinking that there was no way that we we're losing this game,\" he says. \"No way. Somehow, some way, we were going to make a play.\"\n\nMatt Bailer won the face-off to start the overtime, and Striebel took the first shot of the extra session, an effort that went wide, with possession to the Orange. Syracuse cleared, and Powell would eventually go after Davis, who this time stripped the ball. Princeton controlled but couldn't get it across midfield before SU caused a turnover, but in an attempt to create a fast break opportunity, Powell threw the ball past the cutting Liam Banks.\n\nAs it rolled to the corner, Powell and Mollett went after it, and it would skip out of bounds off Powell, possession to Princeton.\n\nPowell, who thought he had been pushed, was slow to get up, causing a short delay before the restart. Once play began, Mollett threw the ball crossfield to Ricky Schultz, a freshman longstick, and Schultz brought it up the sideline before getting it to Chris Harrington, who helped clear it behind the goal to Boyle with less than a minute left in the first OT.\n\nAs Boyle began to settle the ball, he saw Prager cut to the goal, and Boyle put it right into Prager's stick. Prager then flipped it into the goal, giving Princeton the win 10-9 with 41 seconds remaining.\n\n\"It was all weirdly simple,\" says Tierney, who won four of his six NCAA titles at Princeton in overtime. \"We cleared it. B.J. got open. Ryan threw him the ball.\"\n\nIn fact, the first instinct would have been to hold for the final shot of the OT and not give Syracuse another chance. Princeton had already spent its timeout, but with Boyle on the field, it didn't need to go over anything.\n\n\"We didn't set anything up,\" Boyle says. \"It was like we were harmlessly moving the ball around, getting ready to do whatever we were going to do. The next thing I knew, B.J. was open. I almost didn't throw him the ball, because I couldn't believe how open he was. I hesitated for a split-second and luckily not a full second, because he wouldn't have been open anymore.\"\n\nPrager's goal was his fourth of the day and came on Boyle's third assist. Prager would earn Most Outstanding Player honors.\n\nAfter the goal went into the back of the net, there were two kinds of reactions.\n\nThe first was the one for all the players.\n\n\"I just ran and kept running,\" Boyle says. \"I didn't know where to go. I was just running with my arms up in the air, away from our bench. Then I jumped into D.C.'s [Dan Clark's] arms.\"\n\nStriebel was having a similar experience.\n\n\"I remember seeing the play develop, and I had this sense that B.J. was going to get the goal,\" he says. \"It's almost like it happened before it really happened. I just started sprinting and grabbing my closest teammates and yelling.\"\n\nNot everyone was laughing and jumping up and down.\n\nTierney, the head coach, had won his sixth NCAA title, but this one was the only one in which both of his sons, Trevor and Brendan, were on the team. Unable to handle the emotion of having his wildest coaching dream come true, Tierney collapsed to the grass and began to weep.\n\n\"Throughout my career, I've spoken to kids all the time about being unselfish,\" Tierney says. \"That was my one selfish moment.\"\n\nTo his credit, Tierney never spoke to the team about the personal significance of the 2001 season, how it was his last chance to win with both sons.\n\n\"That was such a personal moment for him,\" Boyle says. \"You know how parents say they love all their children equally? All coaches will say they love all their championships equally, but I'm sure if Coach T had a favorite national championship it'd be that one. But he also knew that telling us about it wouldn't resonate, so he just kept it to himself. He never made a big deal out of it.\"\n\nThe image of Tierney as he kneels on the grass, head in hands, completely overcome, is seared into the memory of anyone who saw it.\n\n\"I remember seeing the photo afterwards,\" Striebel says. \"I remember the picture of him, breaking down on the field. I saw it, like, four years later, and it immediately hit me again what an incredible moment that was for him.\"\n\nPrinceton and Syracuse met again a year later in the NCAA final, also at Rutgers Stadium. Syracuse won that game 13-12; it was the last NCAA championship lacrosse game played on a college campus.\n\nBoyle would play in the 2004 Final Four as well, and he finished his career second all-time at Princeton in points with 233.\n\nThe 2001 season was the first year of Major League Lacrosse, and Ryan Mollett was the first overall selection. With the advent of an outdoor professional league, a generation of lacrosse mega-stars emerged, with Boyle and Striebel among them.\n\nTogether they would win three Major League Lacrosse championships with the Philadelphia Barrage, and they would win World Championships together with the U.S. national team in 2002 in Perth, Australia, and 2010, in Manchester, England. In an ironic twist, Striebel has at times been called the best midfielder in the world, though he only plays the position because Boyle came to Princeton and knocked him off of attack.\n\nIn addition, they work together with Trilogy Lacrosse, an educational venture that helps bring the game to youth players throughout the country.\n\n\"It's absurd, what they've done together,\" Tierney says. \"Why are they so successful? They have a passion for the game that's unmatched. They have a longevity. And they found each other.\"\n\nAnd so today, they continue to move down the same road, even on the same corporate team. Boyle is the Trilogy CEO; Striebel is the Director of Research and Development.\n\nThey both continue to play professionally at the highest level, even as Striebel is into his 30s and Boyle is approaching his. There's a new generation of high-profile, highly marketed stars coming up behind them, and their time on the field figures not to last too many more years.\n\n\"I'll ask some of the kids we work with if they know who Jesse Hubbard is,\" Striebel says of the all-time leading goal scorer at Princeton, who led the Tigers to the 1996, 1997 and 1998 NCAA titles. \"And I'm shocked by how many don't know. That's just how it is. They all know who [former Duke star] Ned Crotty is now.\"\n\nStill, they are two of the all-time greats in their sport, two players who first met up on a special team that won a very special championship 10 years ago and who went on to win big on every level after that.\n\nBut that's not completely what their legacy will be. It won't just be Ryan Boyle. It won't just be Matt Striebel.\n\nIt'll be both of them together, inseparable in their place in lacrosse history.\n\nTogether.\n\nAs players, as friends, as competitors, as winners.\n\nAs brothers.\n\n- by"}, {"url": "https://www.princeton.edu/~paw/archive_new/PAW00-01/17-0704/sports.html", "page_content": "July 4, 2001 Sports National champs again!

Matt Golden's From the Cheap Seats column National champs again!\n\nMen's lacrosse wins its sixth title in 10 years\n\nJulibant Tigers surround the national championship trophy after a 10-9 overtime win against Syracuse at Rutgers Stadium on Memorial Day. ( photographs by Beverly Schaefer) I think we have to make some changes to beat Syracuse,\" goalie Trevor Tierney '01 said after the Princeton men's lacrosse team suffered a 14-8 drubbing at Syracuse on March 24, giving the Orangemen a fourth straight win over the Tigers. The day after the loss to Syracuse, Trevor's father, coach Bill Tierney, began making the changes that resulted in a 10-9 overtime win against Syracuse in the NCAA Division I championship game at Rutgers on Memorial Day. The win gave Princeton its sixth national championship since 1992. Tierney's first change affected Matt Striebel '01, who for two years ran Princeton's offense from behind the goal, earning honorable mention All-America honors in 2000. At practice on March 25, Tierney moved Striebel to midfield and handed the team's offensive reins to attackman Ryan Boyle '04, who started the season's first four games at attack along with Striebel and B. J. Prager '02. Boyle flourished, tallying 16 goals and 37 assists en route to winning Ivy League Rookie of the Year and third-team All-America honors. Princeton gained from being able to put two feeders on the field at once, which baffled opposing defenses almost as much as it did the coaches who voted Striebel a first-team All-Ivy midfielder and an honorable mention All-America attackman. The benefits of the move were on full display during the title game. Striebel scored two of Princeton's first six goals and assisted on two others, then helped get Boyle involved in the offense during the third quarter by scooping up a loose ball and passing it to the freshman on the opposite side of the field. Boyle moved the ball to Prager, who scored to put Princeton up 7-4. The goal was the 18th on which Boyle had assisted Prager this season. B. J. Prager '02, left, and Trevor Tierney '01, right, were both All-Tournament selections. (photographs by Beverly Schaefer) The 19th and 20th soon followed. After Syracuse reeled off four straight goals to force an 8-all tie, Prager scored on another Boyle assist to put Princeton ahead midway through the fourth quarter. Syracuse tied it with 16 seconds left to force overtime and stir memories of Princeton's first national title game, a 10-9 win over Syracuse in 1992. That year, Andrew Moe '92 scored nine seconds into the second overtime after picking up a loose ball on a face-off. This year, in the final minute of the first overtime, Boyle got the ball behind the goal and hit Prager with a pass as he cut past his defenseman. Prager then netted his fourth goal of the day, giving Princeton the win. Prager might not have had the chance for such heroics had it not been for another beneficiary of Striebel's move to midfield. Though Boyle assumed Striebel's role in the offense, Sean Hartofilis '03 took over his starting spot on attack. Princeton's offense is often accused of being mind-numbingly methodical, a stereotype that does not fit Hartofilis, who took 118 shots in Princeton's 15 games this season, 20 percent of the Tigers' total. Hartofilis's itchy trigger finger regularly brought Tierney to sideline histrionics. But the shooter also scored 33 goals. Three of those helped rally Princeton from a 4-1 deficit to a 7-4 win at Cornell that secured Princeton's seventh straight Ivy League title. \"Their goalie was very hot,\" Hartofilis told the Daily Princetonian after the win in Ithaca. \"Our shots weren't falling, and he was making a lot of saves. I thought I was getting good looks, so I kept shooting. We figured sooner or later they'd have to start to fall.\" Four more fell for Hartofilis in the NCAA semifinal against Towson University, including the game winner in a wild 12-11 win that made Tierney sound almost accepting of such shot-happy ways. \"Sean is not shy,\" the coach said. \"He's a guy who can get shots off. Sometimes he drives me crazy, and a lot of times I drive him crazy, but you've got to have guys with the gumption to take shots at the end of the game.\" Princeton's defensive adjustments were less radical than the overhaul of the team's attack, but just as critical. Syracuse had figured Princeton's defense out, scoring 16, 13, and 14 goals in the teams' last three meetings. Princeton usually tries to aggressively slide and double-team the man with the ball, a philosophy that helped the Tigers hold opponents to an average of 5.8 goals per game this year, the lowest in the nation. But in the title game, \"We changed the way we play lacrosse,\" said defenseman Ryan Mollett '01. \"We weren't going to slide; we were going to play one-on-one as much as possible. We slid a lot up at the Carrier Dome, and all we did was create offense for Syracuse.\" In that March loss, Syracuse's starting attack combined for six goals and four assists; on Memorial Day, Princeton held the unit to two goals and three assists, its lowest output of the season. Princeton's style may have changed for the Syracuse game, but the outcome was a familiar one - an 11th straight win in tournament games decided by one goal since 1992, including five overtime wins and all three of this season's postseason games. Trevor Tierney said that such potentially nerve-racking situations are nothing compared to the relentless demands of his father's perfectionism: \"Every time the offense throws the ball out of bounds in practice, he's screaming. Every time the defense throws the ball out of bounds, he's screaming. We're in pressure situations every day from February on. If you want to deal with a guy who's going to be in your face all the time, you come to Princeton and take home a couple of rings.\" This fall, Trevor Tierney will take his two national championship rings to Colorado, where he will be an assistant lacrosse coach at the University of Denver.

( photograph by Beverly Schaefer) There were Olympians, All-Americas, and national champions from whom to choose, but Julie Shaner lapped the field as PAW's choice for Princeton's athlete of the year. Shaner did it all - individual accomplishments, team championships, and an impressive list of accolades - and she did it twice. As a member of both the women's soccer and lacrosse teams, Shaner left an indelible signature on two of Princeton's most successful women's athletic programs. A five-time first-team All-Ivy selection (three times in lacrosse, twice in soccer), Shaner was named a first-team All-America in lacrosse for the second time as a senior after leading the Tigers to an Ivy League championship and a return to the NCAA Final Four. The senior captain tallied 20 goals and 21 assists from her midfield position this season and provided the Tigers with a unique blend of speed and athleticism. She is a finalist for the Tewaaraton Trophy, which is awarded annually to the nation's top women's lacrosse player. Coach Chris Sailor said of her star, \"Shaner is clearly one of the top players in the collegiate game and one of the very best to ever play for Princeton.\" Shaner's impact has been even greater on the soccer field. While Princeton women's lacrosse has been a perennial power, the women's soccer program improved dramatically during Shaner's tenure. According to head coach Julie Shackford, \"The team's success over the past two years (including two trips to the NCAA tournament and an Ivy title) is in no small part due to her. She is a fierce competitor.\" The Tigers posted a 7-8-1 mark the season before Shaner arrived. Since her freshman year, the team has a 44-24-2 record that was capped by a 13-5 Ivy championship season last fall, after which the midfielder and team captain was named to the All-Mid-Atlantic All-America team. Though Shaner graduated last month, she will continue to help the women's soccer program. Shaner returns to campus in the fall as a volunteer assistant coach while fulfilling her student-teaching requirement at Princeton's Riverside Elementary School before earning a teaching certificate and license. She has taken more than a few opponents to school already. By M.G.

He starred as a member of the Princeton Tigers men's lacrosse team from 1998 through 2001 and the Princeton Tigers men's soccer team from 1997 through 2000.\n\nDuring his time at Princeton, the team qualified for the NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship all four years, reached the championship game three times, won the championship game twice and won four Ivy League championships. He was a two-time honorable mention United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) All-American and three-time All-Ivy League selection (once first team, twice second team). He was also an All-Ivy league performer in soccer and earned Princeton co-athlete of the year (all-sport) honors as a senior.\n\nAs a professional, he has earned three MLL championships, a league record eight MLL All-Star recognitions and an MLL championship game MVP award. He is also a three-time Team USA representative and two-time World Lacrosse Championship gold medalist.\n\nBackground\n\nStriebel is a native of Gill, Massachusetts. He first got involved in lacrosse at about the age of 12 or 13 when his sister brought home the Brine Lightning stick that he began to play with. Striebel attended The Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut. Striebel first started playing lacrosse when he was a youth for Jeff Coulson, owner of Indoor Action Sports, in Greenfield, Massachusetts.\n\nHe also attended the Writers Workshop at The University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa, earning a Master of Fine Arts degree in 2007. He had earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English at Princeton.\n\nCollege career\n\nAt Princeton he was a two-time honorable mention USILA All-American Team selection in 2000 and 2001. He was a second team All-Ivy League selection in 1999 and 2000 and a first team selection in 2001. He was a 2001 USILA Scholar All-American. During his four-year career, Princeton went undefeated in Ivy League Conference play with consecutive 6\u20130 records. Princeton was invited to the 1999 tournament, was a finalist in the 2000 tournament and earned championships in both the 1998 and 2001 tournaments, bringing the schools consecutive tournament invitations streak to twelve. In Striebel's 2001 senior season, the arrival of freshman Ryan Boyle necessitated that he move from attack to midfield. The move came the first practice after Princeton's 14\u20138 loss to Syracuse. Striebel had previously been orchestrating the Princeton offense from behind the goal, but on March 25, 2001, head coach Bill Tierney made the switch. During the 1998 season when Princeton won the NCAA title, Striebel had been playing midfield. Princeton went undefeated for the rest of the 2001 season after the switch.\n\nDuring the 2000 NCAA tournament, Striebel scored two goals in the quarterfinals 10\u20137 victory against Maryland, and he added another in the 13\u20137 championship game loss to Syracuse. Striebel was one of the leading scorers on the team that season, and he was the team leader in assists entering the final four weekend. In the quarterfinals of the 2001 NCAA championship tournament, Striebel had an assist in the 8\u20137 victory over Loyola. In the 12\u201311 semifinal victory over Towson State, Striebel had a goal and an assist. Striebel scored twice in the 2001 championship game and also added two assists. He was selected to the All-tournament team.\n\nStriebel was also an honorable mention All-Ivy League soccer player in 2000 as well as a 2000 Academic All-Ivy selection in soccer. As a junior, Striebel was a member of the 1999 Ivy League Champion Princeton Soccer team that earned an invitation to the 1999 NCAA Men's Division I Soccer Championship. The team posted a 10\u20135\u20132 (5\u20131\u20131 Ivy League) record.\n\nAs of 2010, Striebel ranks eighth on the Princeton Lacrosse career assists list and eleventh on the Princeton soccer career assists list. As a senior, he was honored as one of the three athletes of the year on campus (along with Dennis Norman and Scott Denbo)\n\nProfessional career\n\nStriebel began his career in the league's inaugural 2001 MLL season with the Bridgeport Barrage and stayed with the team as it remained in Bridgeport, Connecticut until the 2003 season. Then he moved with the franchise and played with the Philadelphia Barrage from 2004 through 2008. In 2009 MLL season, he joined the Chicago Machine and then became a member of the Rochester Rattlers for the 2011 MLL season. Striebel and Boyle were reunited for five seasons in Philadelphia. Striebel has helped the Barrage to win three Steinfeld Cup championships in 2004, 2006, and 2007. In the 2004 championship game, he scored what the Baltimore Sun described as the clinching goal in the 13\u201311 victory over the Boston Cannons. In the 2006 game, he had nine points (four goals, including one two-pointer and four assists). He was presented with the 2007 Steinfeld Cup Game Most Valuable Player Award. Striebel appeared in the 2005 & 2007 Major League Lacrosse All-Star Games. In the 2006 All-Star game he represented Team USA by scoring a goal and two assists. Striebel was an MLL All-Pro selection in 2007 and 2008. Striebel was an MLL All-Star in 2011. In 2012, Striebel set the MLL record for most All-Star games with eight (consecutive).\n\nStriebel served as an assistant coach for Princeton Men's Lacrosse in 2005. Striebel also spent time assisting the men's lacrosse team at Iowa during his time there. As of 12 April 2012, Striebel currently coaches the Varsity Boys Lacrosse team at Northampton High School in Northampton, MA which is just south of his hometown. He also played professionally in 2012 and 2013.\n\nIn addition to his field lacrosse career, Striebel played one season in 2003 of box lacrosse with the Philadelphia Wings in the National Lacrosse League. Streibel was traded by the Wings to the New York Saints in February 2003. He never appeared in a game for the Saints. Striebel has also played professional soccer for the Western Massachusetts Pioneers.\n\nStriebel has represented Team USA in the World Lacrosse Championship in 2002, 2006, and 2010.

He starred as a member of the Princeton Tigers men's lacrosse team from 1998 through 2001 and the Princeton Tigers men's soccer team from 1997 through 2000.\n\nDuring his time at Princeton, the team qualified for the NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship all four years, reached the championship game three times, won the championship game twice and won four Ivy League championships. He was a two-time honorable mention United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) All-American and three-time All-Ivy League selection (once first team, twice second team).

In MLL offseasons, Striebel played three years of professional soccer from 2002-04 for the Western Massachusetts Pioneers of the USL Second Division.\n\n\u201cHis fitness level was just off the charts,\u201d said former Philadelphia Barrage head coach Tony Resch. \u201cHe could keep going and going. He had great speed. He could shoot it. Unselfish. All the things you look for in a midfielder, he had it.\u201d\n\nWhile Resch and most fans may remember Striebel as a lights-out shooter, that wasn\u2019t always the case. Prior to his senior year at Princeton, Striebel was an X attackman. When freshman Ryan Boyle stepped on campus, Striebel was moved above GLE \u2013 where, Boyle jokes, his shot couldn\u2019t break a paper bag.\n\n\u201cHe completely reinvented himself, starting with his senior year at Princeton moving from behind the cage out in front to midfield,\u201d said Boyle, who also played with Striebel on the Philadelphia Barrage. \u201cHis dedication to his craft is truly remarkable. Going from somebody who didn\u2019t really have much range to speak of at all to being somebody who you had to pick up at 16 yards\u2026 he was unguardable.\u201d\n\nThat work ethic led to a 171-game career. Striebel evolved to earn playing time on the \u201804 Barrage midfield unit featuring Blake Miller (46G, 11A), Roy Colsey (25G, 6T, 7A), Mike Mollot (11G, 8A), and Doug Shanahan (12G, 6A).\n\nStriebel stuck the eventual game-winning goal in the \u201804 MLL Championship for that Barrage squad.

Matt Golden's From the Cheap Seats column Photo by Beverly Schaefer Expectations change for Nate Walton '01\n\nTigers enjoy surprising success with their new center Between August 31 and the start of its season in November, the Princeton men\u0092s basketball team\u0092s roster and coaching staff were ravaged by injuries and defections. The losses caused concern among Tiger fans and vastly changed captain Nate Walton\u0092s expectations heading into his senior season.\n\nWalton would begin his final collegiate tour with a new head coach, a new position, and, most significant, a pivotal role on the Tiger squad. Recruited as a forward, Walton was moved to the center position, which, at Princeton, is a position true to its name. The Tigers\u0092 success historically revolves around their big man in the middle.\n\n\u0093I remember finding out about Chris Young \u009202 signing with the [Pittsburgh] Pirates and coach Carmody leaving on the same day,\u0094 recalls Walton, who at six feet, seven inches tall is noticeably shorter than most opposing centers. \u0093There was a sense of excitement that I would be placed in such a key role, but it was disappointing losing Chris. He was a very talented player, but we\u0092ve tried to maintain a positive outlook on the situation from day one.\u0094\n\nHe adds, \u0093I remember saying to my dad, \u0091Well, dad, we\u0092ve got a new coach, and I\u0092m going to be playing center. I guess I better go out and start practicing my post moves.\u0092 He told me not to make too big of a deal out of it. He said it doesn\u0092t matter what position you play, a good basketball player is a good basketball player no matter where he is on the floor.\u0094\n\nThose words would be typical of a proud father supporting his son, but when that father is Bill Walton, winner of three collegiate national basketball championships with UCLA, two NBA championships with the Portland Trail Blazers and Boston Celtics, and a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, you give them some added credence.\n\nProving his father right, Walton has been rock solid for Princeton. The Tiger veteran, whose younger brothers, Chris and Luke, play at San Diego State and the University of Arizona, respectively, was averaging 10.3 points and 5.1 rebounds per game heading into a February 13 first-place, Ivy-League showdown with the Penn Quakers. (For coverage of that game visit the PAW Web site at www.princeton. edu/~ paw.) Battling through an early-season ankle injury, Walton posted respectable numbers and provided leadership that kept the young Princeton squad afloat. The Tigers dropped seven of their first 11 games while a hobbled Walton and several new faces struggled to find consistency and continuity. But as Ivy League play approached, Walton seemed to hit his stride. After posting a career-high 26 points against the College of New Jersey, Walton paced the Tigers to a 4\u00970 Ivy start that left Princeton knotted in a first-place tie with Penn.\n\n\u0093Nate has been absolutely outstanding for us,\u0094 said first-year head coach John Thompson III \u009288. \u0093He does everything we ask him to, and he\u0092s been a tremendous asset. He may take some jump-hooks at times that he shouldn\u0092t, but you\u0092ve got to keep in mind, he was recruited as a forward. In my mind, he\u0092s made a remarkable transition.\u0094\n\nThat transition has presented an unusually difficult learning curve. The center plays a nontraditional role in the highly disciplined Princeton offense. \u0093You touch the ball so frequently at the center position in our offense, it\u0092s difficult to know when you should look to shoot the ball and when to pass the ball,\u0094 Walton explains. \u0093In most offenses, the center doesn\u0092t get the ball very often. Basically, when he gets it, he shoots it. That\u0092s not the case in our offense.\u0094\n\nWith Walton anchoring the middle and freshmen Andre Logan, Ed Persia, and Konrad Wysocki rounding into steady contributors, the Tigers have already surpassed the expectations of most. But for Walton, in the twilight of his Ivy career, that only means it is time to raise the bar. He says, \u0093For us to . . . play in the postseason, we need to put forth a consistent effort every night out. That is our only focus. If we do that, we\u0092ve got a chance to win every game we play. All you can ask for is a chance to win every time out.\u0094 That effort was evident in the Tigers\u0092 first battle with Penn, when Princeton rolled to a 67\u009753 win for a leg up in the Ivy title chase.\n\nPrinceton fans would agree that Walton and the Tigers have already delivered more than anyone had a right to ask for when the season began.

The Tigers\u0092 13\u00977 loss to Syracuse in the Memorial Day title game barely dimmed the glow on a year in which Princeton went 12\u00973, won a sixth straight Ivy League title, and ran its streak of Ivy League wins to 31 straight.\n\nPrinceton returns almost all of its key players and adds several freshmen who could see significant playing time in 2001. Once again, Princeton\u0092s primary challenger for the NCAA title will be Syracuse, which enters this season as a favorite to repeat. The Tigers themselves hope for a return to the title game. Ryan Mollett \u009201, an honorable mention All-America defenseman last year and one of Princeton\u0092s four captains, explains, \u0093We think that we have the talent to be playing on Memorial Day, but it\u0092s spread out so evenly that every day we\u0092re pushing each other in practice to see who\u0092s going to be playing for us on that day.\u0094\n\nCocaptain Trevor Tierney \u009201 proved his mettle in goal last year, earning honorable mention All-America status. He\u0092ll be protected by one of the best, and deepest, defenses in the game. Along with Mollett, starters Scott Farrell \u009202, another honorable mention All-America, and Damien Davis \u009203 return. Brian Lieberman \u009203, Joe Rosenbaum \u009203, Ricky Schultz \u009204, and John Walsh \u009201 will compete for the longstick midfield spot. Winship Ross \u009201 returns as a defensive midfielder, one who wields a short stick but plays only when his team is on defense, and will be joined there by Chip Buzzeo \u009201, another cocaptain. All of that experience will help Princeton immensely. Head coach Bill Tierney says, \u0093Last year, going into the season we really didn\u0092t have much of an idea of what each other was doing. This year, we know that we have four or five guys who can play defense at a really high level.\u0094\n\nThe Tigers have even more depth on the attack, where they return all of their key contributors. Cocaptain Matt Striebel \u009201, another honorable mention All-America, will again run the offense from behind the cage. B. J. Prager \u009202 has recovered from the knee injury that ended his season last April and should continue to rack up goals on the crease. Last year, Brendan Tierney \u009202, Sean Hartofilis \u009203, and Josh White \u009203 also saw substantial time at attack, though White will probably play midfield this spring. Princeton also added two of the four best attack recruits in the country: Ryan Boyle \u009204 and Jason Donegar \u009204, who Tierney says have been \u0093all we expected and more.\u0094\n\nAdd to that list Will MacColl \u009203, who Tierney says is perhaps the most improved player on the roster, and Princeton could have a high-scoring attack where playing time will be hard to come by. \u0093No one\u0092s going to play as much as he wants to play,\u0094 Tierney cautions, adding that a successful campaign should salve any brooding about who\u0092s playing. White won\u0092t be the only attackman to see time at midfield, where Princeton suffered its only serious loss to graduation \u0097 Josh Sims \u009200 was twice the college midfielder of the year and was Princeton\u0092s best offensive player the last two years. Tierney sees a partial replacement in Rob Torti \u009201, who ran on the first midfield as a freshman but was hit by a variety of injuries in 1999 and 2000. \u0093Rob Torti is by far the most dominant midfielder we\u0092ve had in the last few years outside of Sims,\u0094 Tierney says.\n\nMatt Bailer \u009201 has been the Tigers\u0092 face-off man the past two years, but he will be challenged by Drew Casino \u009204, perhaps the most highly touted face-off recruit Tierney has landed at Princeton. Douglas Baugher \u009202 and Greg Golaszewski \u009203 will also take some draws.\n\nPrinceton opens its schedule with four tough opponents. On March 3 the Tigers faced Johns Hopkins, and on March 10 they host the University of Virginia, both of whom were national semifinalists last year. The Tigers travel to Hofstra, an NCAA quarterfinalist last year, on March 17, and to Syracuse on March 24. The schedule eases after that, with games against Hobart, Rutgers, and the Ivy League slate.\n\nHeading into the season, Princeton and Syracuse are clearly the two top teams in the country. Last year, the Orangemen were far superior to the Tigers, but that talent gap has narrowed substantially. This year, the two teams could square off at Rutgers on Memorial Day in a classic NCAA championship showdown. By David Marcus \u009292\n\nDavid Marcus is a frequent contributor to PAW.
