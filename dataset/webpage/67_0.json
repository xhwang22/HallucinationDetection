{"Anthony Dimond (1850\\u20131927) was an American politician who served as the third Governor of Alaska Territory from 1909 to 1913.": [{"url": "https://kids.britannica.com/students/article/Anthony-Joseph-Dimond/311018", "page_content": "Harris and Ewing Collection/Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. (digital file no. LC-DIG-hec-28851)\n\n(1881\u20131953). American lawyer and political leader Anthony Joseph Dimond was a champion of Alaskan statehood. He also stressed the importance of the Alaska Highway, which, when completed, was the only land route to connect Alaska with the mainland United States (through Canada).\n\nDimond was born on November 30, 1881, in Palatine Bridge, New York. After teaching from 1900 to 1903, he moved to Alaska in 1904 to work as a prospector and miner. Dimond also studied law, and in 1913 he was admitted to the bar and began practicing in Valdez, Alaska. Later that year he became the U.S. commissioner at Chisana, Alaska, where he worked with gold miners and their claims. In 1917 Dimond became the special assistant to the U.S. attorney in Valdez.\n\nDimond served as mayor of Valdez for nine years, from 1920 to 1922 and from 1925 to 1932. From 1923 to 1926 and from 1929 to 1932 he was a member of the Alaska Territorial Senate. In 1933 Dimond was elected as the Alaskan representative to the U.S. Congress, and he was reelected five successive times. Although he worked tirelessly for Alaskan statehood, the feat would not be accomplished until 1959, after his death. Dimond left Congress in 1945 to become a district court judge in Anchorage, Alaska. He died there on May 28, 1953."}, {"url": "https://www.asdk12.org/domain/3908", "page_content": "Dimond High School was named for Anthony Joseph Dimond, an Alaskan pioneer legislator and federal judge who promoted statehood for the young territory.\n\nDimond was born in New York on November 30, 1881. Dimond left a teaching position in New York to emigrate to Alaska in 1905 and spent the next 48 years protecting and defending the land he loved. In 1913, he became an attorney and later that year was appointed U.S. Commissioner at Chisana, recording gold miners\u2019 claims and settling their disputes. Later he became Special Assistant to the U.S. Attorney in Valdez. Motivated by the goal of statehood for this Last Frontier, Dimond entered politics and served four terms in the Alaska Territorial Legislature and as mayor of Valdez for nearly a decade. He worked hard to unify the Territory\u2019s interests and became Alaska\u2019s sole delegate to the Congress of the United States from 1933-1945. His first acts were to introduce a Statehood Bill, which was ignored, to urge construction of the Alaska Highway, and to advise that fortifications be built in Fairbanks and Anchorage.\n\nDimond ended forty years of public service as a Federal Judge for the Third Judicial District of Alaska. In May of 1953, Judge Dimond suffered a heart attack and died a week later at Providence Hospital in Anchorage. November 30, his birthdate, was designated as A.J.
