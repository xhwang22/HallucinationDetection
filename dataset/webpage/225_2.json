Kazuhiro Sasaki\n\nPosition(s): Closer\n\nTeam(s): Seattle Mariners\n\nComing in at number 10 on the Top 10 MLB Asian Baseball Players All-Time Rankings is the former Seattle Mariners closer Kazuhiro Sasaki.\n\nAfter pitching within the NPB from 1990 to 2005, the longtime NPB star made his transition to Major League Baseball with the Mariners where he would play for the four solid seasons in the league before leaving to return to Japan.\n\nIn his first season with the Mariners, Sasaki would post 37 saves to go along with a 3.16 earned run average while winning the 2000 AL Rookie of the Year.\n\nOver the next two seasons Sasaki would make two AL All-Star teams while posting 82 saves over that stretch while ranking among the best closers in baseball.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Koji Uehara\n\nPosition(s): Starting Pitcher, Relief Pitcher, Closer\n\nTeam(s): Baltimore Orioles, Texas Rangers, Boston Red Sox & Chicago Cubs\n\nOne Japanese player who had all the stuff to be a great baseball player is Koji Uehara who joined the league after making nine NPB All-Star teams.\n\nUnfortunately, Uehara struggled to stay healthy during his playing days but showed his potential at times over his MLB career posting a career 22-26 record to go along with a 2.66 earned run average with 95 career saves.\n\nAfter converting from a starting pitcher in 2009, Uehara posted his best season as a closer with the Boston Red Sox in 2014 finishing with a 2.52 earned run average and posting 26 saves. From 2013 to 2015, Uehara posted at least 21 saves to go along with a 2.52 or lower earned run average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Hisashi Iwakuma\n\nTeam(s): Seattle Mariners\n\nPosition(s): Pitcher\n\nAnother former NPB All-Star who ranks among the best Asian baseball players to play in Major League Baseball is Hisashi Iwakuma.\n\nIwakuma who was a three-time NPB All-Star and Pacific League MVP signed with the Seattle Mariners before the start of the 2012 MLB Season would go on to pitch six seasons for the Mariners posting a 63-39 career record to go along with a career 3.42 earned run average.\n\nIn 2013, Iwakuma posted his best season within Major League Baseball posting a 14-6 overall record to go along with a 2.66 earned run average, 185 strikeouts while making his only MLB All-Star team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Masahiro Tanaka\n\nPosition(s): Starting Pitcher\n\nTeam(s): New York Yankees\n\nOne of the most exciting players to be posted to Major League Baseball was the former Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles starting pitcher Masahiro Tanaka.\n\nAfter being posted six teams made bids for Tanaka before the New York Yankees landed him. After joining the Yankees Tanaka would pitch from 2014 to 2020 with the team posting a 78-46 career record to go with a 3.74 career earned run average mark and 991 career wins.\n\nTanaka posted at least 11 wins in each of his first six seasons while earning an AL All-Star selection during the 2014 MLB season and 2019 MLB season. Tanaka would return to the Golden Eagles after the 2020 MLB season and remains one of the highest paid players within the league.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Yu Darvish\n\nPosition(s): Starting Pitcher\n\nTeam(s): Texas Rangers, Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles Dodgers, San Diego Padres (Active)\n\nOne of two current Top 10 MLB Asians of All-Time who are still actively playing in Major League Baseball is the San Diego Padres starting pitcher Yu Darvish.\n\nSince arriving in the United States, Darvish has made five MLB All-Star teams, led the National League in wins, led the American League in strikeouts, and was an All-MLB First Team selection during the 2020 MLB season.\n\nThe current San Diego Padres starting pitcher has won 16 games twice during his MLB career including during the 2020 MLB season while posting an earned run average below 3.50 in five different MLB seasons. Darvish entered the 2023 MLB season with a career 95-75 record on the mound to go along with 1,788 career strikeouts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Hideo Nomo\n\nPosition(s): Starting Pitcher\n\nTeam(s): Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Mets, Milwaukee Brewers, Detroit Tigers, Boston Red Sox, Tampa Bay Devils Rays, & Kansas City Royals\n\nRounding out the Top 5 on the Top 10 MLB Asian Baseball Players All-Time Rankings is the former 12-year MLB pitcher Hideo Nomo.\n\nNomo who was known for his unorthodox windup deliveries was brilliant over his career while posting a career 123-109 record to go along with 1,918 strikeouts and a 4.24 career earned run average.\n\nOver his 12-year career, Nomo posted at least 12 wins in seven different seasons including a 13-6 record in his rookie season in 1995 earning him his only MLB All-Star selection and the 1995 NL Rookie of the Year Award.\n\nIn addition to those numbers Nomo threw two career no-hitters while leading the league in strikeouts in two different MLB seasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Shin-Soo Choo\n\nPosition(s): Outfielder\n\nTeam(s): Seattle Mariners, Cleveland Indians, Cincinnati Reds, & Texas Rangers\n\nOne of the most popular MLB Asian baseball players is the former longtime Texas Ranger and Cleveland Indians outfielder Shin-Soo Choo.\n\nChoo who made his MLB debut during the 2005 MLB season played from 2005 to 2020 before joining the KBO where he has played in each of the past few seasons.\n\nChoo racked up 218 career home runs over 7,157 career at bats over his career to go along with 782 runs batted in. Over his 16-year MLB career, Choo posted at least 20 home runs in seven different seasons while picking up at least 140 hits in eight different seasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Hideki Matsui\n\nPosition(s): Left Fielder, Designated Hitter\n\nTeam(s): New York Yankees, Los Angeles Angels, Oakland A\u2019s & Tampa Bay Rays\n\nWhen it comes to the top three MLB Asian Baseball players to play, each is well deserving of a mention as three of the greatest of All Time. One of those three is the former New York Yankees All-Star outfielder Hideki Matsui who also was known as Godzilla.\n\nMatsui prior to signing with the New York Yankees was a 9-time NPB All-Star and three-time Central League MVP. After joining the Yankees Matsui would make back-to-back All-Star teams in 2003 and 2004 while driving in at least 106 runs in each season.\n\nMatsui would finish his career with four 100 plus runs batted in seasons and five seasons with at least 21 home runs. The 10-year MLB would make two All-Star teams and win a World Series MVP during his time with the Yankees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Shohei Ohtani\n\nPosition(s): Starting Pitcher, Designated Hitter\n\nTeam(s): Los Angeles Angels\n\nAs of now the current Los Angeles Angels All-Star Shohei Ohtani lands at number two among the greatest Asians to play in Major League Baseball.\n\nThe current Angels starting pitcher and designated hitter continues to perform among the best players in the league both on the mound as well as at the plate. Ohtani, who is doing something that MLB fans have not seen since Babe Ruth, has dominated both as a hitter as a hitter.\n\nHis performance since arriving in Major League Baseball includes being selected to back-to-back All-Star teams, winning the 2021 AL MVP Award, the 2018 AL Rookie of the Year Award, and a member of the Cycle Club after hitting for the cycle during the 2019 MLB Season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Ichiro Suzuki\n\nPosition(s): Outfielder\n\nTeam(s): Seattle Mariners, New York Yankees, & Miami Marlins\n\nIn at number one on the Top 10 MLB Asian Baseball Players All-Time Rankings is the former Seattle Mariners Hall of Famer Ichiro Suzuki. It is hard to look past Suzuki as not only the best Japanese baseball player but also the greatest Asian baseball player to play in Major League Baseball.\n\nThe NPB seven-time All-Star was as dominant as any player after arriving in the United States while making 10 straight MLB All-Star teams and 10 Gold Glove Awards.\n\nIn his first season during the 2001 MLB season, Suzuki won the AL Rookie of the Year Award as well as the 2001 AL MVP Award. Suzuki would go on to win two AL Batting crowns, lead the AL in stolen bases, and post an MLB record 262 career hits during a single season.\n\nSuzuki would finish his career with 10 straight 200 plus hit seasons, 3089 career hits, 362 doubles, 780 runs batted in, 509 stolen bases and a career .311 batting average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow would rank these Asian Baseball Players?

Iwakuma put in an outstanding performance in the round two elimination game against Cuba, and again in the final when he left the game with a lead over Korea. He isn\u2019t a new face to NPB fans, but he\u2019s not a phenom like\u00c2 Yu Darvish\u00c2 and hasn\u2019t gotten much exposure abroad.\u00c2\n\nIt\u2019s been somewhat of a winding road to this point for Iwakuma. Let\u2019s take a look at how he got here.\n\n2002\n\nI was living near Osaka in 2002, when Iwakuma arrived on the scene for the local Kintetsu Buffaloes. The Buffaloes were coming off a Japan Series appearance, but had a pretty weak rotation, and he put up respectable numbers in his first full year. More than anything, I recall his funky two-stage delivery, and that people were talking about his as someone to watch in coming years.\n\n2003\n\nIwakuma broke out with a 15-10 record and 3.45 ERA in 195 2/3 innings, and along with Jeremy Powell gave the Buffaloes a solid front-end rotation. \u00c2 Kintetsu\u2019s power lineup was aging at that point though, and they weren\u2019t able to compete with the strong Fukuoka Daiei Hawks for the Pacific League title.\n\n2004\n\nIwakuma started the season with a 12-game winning streak and was the top vote-getting pitcher in the Pacific League for the All-Star game. \u00c2 Iwakuma plays in the Olympics later in the summer and finished with a 15-2 record.\n\nMore signficantly, the Kintetsu Buffaloes and Orix Blue Wave agreed to merge their baseball operations in the summer of \u201904, leading to the establishment of team currently known as the Orix Buffaloes. The merger spurred talks of contraction, which eventually led to a fan-supported players\u2019 strike and the creation of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles franchise. The merge was a sad event for me, as it meant the end of the Blue Wave name, which I really liked.\n\n2004-5 Offseason\n\nIwakuma refused to play for the merged Buffaloes team, and was traded to the Rakuten expansion team. Rakuten seemed to have a decent foundation to its rotation with Iwakuma and college ace Yasuhiro Ichiba. Ichiba never panned out, and was just recently traded.\n\n2005-7\n\nWilderness years. Two-stage delivery\u2019s were banned in NPB, forcing Iwakuma\u00c2 to re-work his mechanics. This video gives you a sense of the changes he had to make; you can see his Kintetsu-era windup from about 1:00-1:20*. He also struggled through injuries and had a doormat of an expansion team behind him until 2007.\n\n\u00c2 *note about the video: click the large button that says \u00e5\u2020\u008d\u00e7\u201d\u0178 to play the video. There is also an annoying comment feature that can be disabled if you click the button in the lower right of the video player, the one that kind of looks like a chick with a cartoon talk-bubble.\u00c2\n\n2008\n\nA big return to form. Iwakuma stayed healthy and apparently mastered his mechanics. The video I linked to above shows a change he made to his arm slot, which resulted in him getting more groundball outs, and dramatically reduced his home run rate. Despite his excellent season, Iwakuma was snubbed from the Olympic team, which in part allowed him to win a league-leading 21 games. He was the first 20-game winner in NPB since Kei Igawa\u00c2 and Kazumi Saito\u00c2 both won 20 in 2003, and the first 21-game winner since Yoshinori Sato\u00c2 in 1985.\u00c2\n\nFor his efforts, he was awarded the Sawamura Award as NPB\u2019s best pitcher, and the Pacific League MVP despite playing for a 5th-place team.\n\nThe Future\n\nIwakuma signed a 3-year, 1.1bn yen ($11m) deal with Rakuten after the 2008 season. It\u2019s uncommon for NPB players to sign multi-year deals prior to reaching free agency, so his contract is evidence that Rakuten really thinks highly of him. \u00c2 Since I was getting asked this during the NPB chats, as far as I can tell he has about five years of NPB service time, which means he has another four to go before reaching international free agency. Rakuten seems to be commited to building a competitive team around him."}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/hisashi-iwakuma", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nHisashi Iwakuma was born on 12 April, 1981 in Higashiyamato, Tokyo, Japan, is a Japanese baseball player.

All five have been thrown at home. Here's a rundown of some other facts about the no-no.\n\n\u2022 The no-hitter was Iwakuma's first career complete game.\n\nComplete coverage: Hisashi Iwakuma's no-hitter\n\n\u2022 The last three no-hitters thrown by American League pitchers have been authored by the Mariners -- Felix Hernandez threw a perfect game in a 1-0 victory over the Rays on Aug. 15, 2012, and six pitchers combined to toss a no-hitter against the Dodgers in a 1-0 win on June 8, 2012.\n\n\u2022 Iwakuma and Hernandez's no-hitters bookended the longest streak of no-hitters in Major League history by one league -- and Iwakuma's came nearly three years to the day after Hernandez's.\n\n\u2022 In that span, the National League threw 12 no-hitters.\n\n\u2022 Iwakuma's no-no marked the first time one team has accounted for three consecutive no-hitters by a respective league since 1960-61, when the Braves were responsible for three straight no-hitters league-wide. Lew Burdette tossed the first no-no of the streak on Aug. 18, 1960, against the Phillies, before Warren Spahn hurled the league's next two no-hitters, on Sept. 16, 1960, and April 28, 1961.\n\n\u2022 Including White Sox right-hander Philip Humber's perfect game at Safeco Field in April 2012, four of the last five AL no-hitters have involved the Mariners.\n\nVideo: [email protected]: Iwakuma one out from no-no with groundout\n\n\u2022 The last pitcher to throw a no-hitter in his first career complete game was Humber (it is still his only career complete game).\n\n\u2022 Hideo Nomo (with two) is the only other Japanese pitcher in MLB history to throw a no-hitter.

With the Golden Eagles, Iwakuma was their first staff ace, and continued to hold that position until the present, when he was given permission to be posted.\n\nInjuries plagued Iwakuma for a three-year period from 2005 until 2007, and cost him virtually the entire 2006 and 2007 seasons. His 2005 stats were bloated, and at the end of the season, Iwakuma revealed that he had been pitching with a weak shoulder for nearly the entire baseball season, all 182 innings that he pitched. Nippon Professional Baseball also changed certain rules governing two-stage motions (the motion that most Japanese pitchers have, where they come to a hitch, or a stop in the middle of their delivery) also threw off his mechanics, which, in turn, threw off his performance. Because of his shoulder problems, Iwakuma was out for more than half of the 2006 season, pitching only 38 innings. The 2007 season was more of the same, with Iwakuma succumbing to a left oblique strain, limiting him to 90 innings. He had arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow that October, and it did wonders.\n\nIwakuma's best season was 2008, when he won the Pacific League MVP Award, as well as the Eiji Sawamura Award. He took that good karma into the 2009 World Baseball Classic, where he pitched 19 innings of three-run baseball over the course of the tournament. The manager of Team Japan chose Iwakuma to pitch in the final game against Korea, and when everything was said and done, the right-handed possessed a sterling 1.35 ERA, was selected as a member of the All-Tournament Team, and was easily the best pitcher in the competition, edging out even Tournament MVP Daisuke Matsuzaka.\n\nHere are his stats, thanks to NPBtracker.com:\n\nPart I: Scouting Report\n\nAccording to NPBtracker.com, Iwakuma possesses:\n\nA fastball that sits between 87 and 91 MPH.\n\nA shuuto that sits between 87 and 90 MPH.\n\nA forkball that hovers around 85 MPH.\n\nA cutter that hovers around 85 MPH.\n\nA slider that hovers around 80 MPH.\n\nA curveball thrown between 70 and 75 MPH.\n\nIwakuma is primarily a groundball pitcher, but his strikeouts per nine rate and walks per nine are extraordinarily high for a groundball pitcher- he has a career mark of 6.74 K/9 and 2.19 BB/9. It is important to keep in mind that, for three years, he had limited playing time, thereby artificially deflating the numbers he put up during those years, but even still, this shows the great deal of control and finesse that Iwakuma possesses.\n\nHis delivery can be seen here. Before 2005, his delivery was a bit more unique, with him letting his right arm hang at it's side while lifting his left leg, lowering it halfway, and then raising it again before lunging towards the plate. The NPB rule change, as well as his injuries, forced him to abandon it in favor of a more orthodox style of delivery.\n\nPart II: Costs\n\nThough he certainly has put up some sterling numbers in the NPB, there are many factors that, I think, would limit his posting/contractual value. His track record of injury, while it hasn't been a problem since 2007, is still something to keep in the back of ones mind. Iwakuma has never garnered massive amounts of attention in Japan, and thus, is not a media darling, like Daisuke Matsuzaka, or Yu Darvish. Though he is well established in Japan, like all other pitchers making the transition to the MLB, his ability to adapt to the MLB-regulation ball is something that also needs to be kept in mind.\n\nAt the same time, however, if Yu Darvish is posted this winter, Iwakuma's stock might rise exponentially because of it, much like how Kei Igawa's posting and contractual fees were extremely inflated, because he was hitting the market the same time that Dice-K was, and everyone wanted their own, new, shiny, \"Japanese import\". Should Darvish not be posted, however, I think that Iwakuma's posting fees and contractual demands will be much more in line with what was mentioned above.\n\nBecause he is turning 30, and is in the declining stage of his baseball career, factored in with the above-mentioned variables, I really can't foresee him signing with any team for an absurd amount of money, or for a very lengthy period of time. Brandon Siefken, and editor and writer at Japanball.com is reporting that the Japanese media is estimating his posting fee at $12 million dollars- a number that can very easily increase should a desperation-fueled bidding war erupts. I'd estimate that any contract that he signs will likely be for about three years or so, and would be in the neighborhood of $10 million dollars per year, or thereabouts. This is based on the deals that Kenshin Kawakami and Koji Uehara signed, with Iwakuma being both younger and closer to his glory days than either of the other two.\n\nPart III: Conclusion\n\nPersonally, I would take a pass on Iwakuma. His pitching repertoire does not contain any one, single amazing pitch. That is to say, there is nothing about it that blows me away, and makes me feel that, as a pitcher in the MLB, he can blow away opposing batters. His fastballs top out at just over 90 MPH, his out-pitch, the forkball, could theoretically be taken away from him by an MLB pitching coach, over injury concerns, and the transition from NPB-regulation baseballs to MLB-regulation baseballs might negate the above-average control that he possesses, at least for some period of time, as he accustoms himself with the MLB-regulation ball. In the past, he has had numerous injuries, and while he seems to have put that all behind him, this team is the Mets, and as we all know, whatever wrong that can happen will happen. Of late, the team certainly has a way of bringing out all of injury woes in players. I would rather pick up a free agent on the market (such as fellow countryman Hiroki Kuroda) who has proven their worth in the Major Leagues already than take a gamble on Iwakuma- especially if his price becomes artificially inflated due to other, more highly coveted Japanese pitchers."}, {"url": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/players/hisashi-iwakuma", "page_content": "Veteran right-hander Hisashi Iwakuma tells Ryan Divish of the Seattle Times that he will conclude his tenure with the Mariners and return to his native Japan. That does not mean, however, that he\u2019s calling his playing career quits.\n\nIwakuma had been trying to return from shoulder surgery, but only made it to a pair of rehab appearances. While he was not able to get all the way back to the big league mound, the 37-year-old says he still hopes to pitch in the Nippon Professional Baseball League in the future.\n\nAs Iwakuma put it: \u201cLooking at the big picture, it\u2019s been long process of rehab, and finally in this long tunnel, I\u2019m starting to see light. \u2026 I wanted to explore how much more I could do back in Japan and see if there any teams are interested in me.\u201d\n\nThough he did not come to the majors until his age-31 season, following a strong decade-long NPB run, Iwakuma certainly made his mark at the game\u2019s highest level. He ended up throwing 883 2/3 innings of 3.42 ERA ball, all of them coming with the Seattle organization.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to forget just how effective \u2019Kuma was over the years. He never posted gaudy strikeout rates, but rarely gave up free passes and (in his first three seasons, at least) drew groundballs on about half the balls put in play against him.\n\nHis best overall season, unquestionably, came in 2013. Iwakuma came up one out shy of accumulating 220 frames and ended the year with a 2.66 ERA and 7.6 K/9 against 1.7 BB/9. He earned his lone All-Star nod in the midst of that campaign, which ended with a third-place finish in the American League Cy Young voting.\n\nOf course, injuries limited Iwakuma more recently. Problems identified on his physical scuttled a three-year, $45MM contract with the Dodgers after the 2015 season. He ended up returning to the M\u2019s on a deal that included a $12MM guarantee and rolling vesting/club options. While the first campaign under that agreement worked out well enough, as Iwakuma threw 199 innings with a 4.12 ERA, he only made six starts with the team in the 2017 season. After the option was declined, Iwakuma ended up returning on a minor-league deal \u2014 the same contract that is now coming to a conclusion.\n\nAs he prepares to return to Japan, it\u2019s interesting to look back on the circumstances surrounding his original decision to cross the Pacific. Iwakuma was actually posted in the fall of 2010, with the Athletics winning the bidding under the system in place at that time. When Oakland failed to work out a deal with Iwakuma, he pitched a final season in Japan before drawing interest again as a free agent.\n\nUnfortunately, though he was effective in that intervening campaign, Iwakuma also was limited that year by shoulder issues. He ended up signing an incentive-laden, one-year deal with the M\u2019s for only a $1.5MM guarantee. The Seattle club wisely doubled down on that initial investment in the ensuing offseason with a two-year, $14MM extension that included a cheap, $7MM option for the 2015 season.\n\nThough he spent a relatively brief portion of his career in the majors, Iwakuma rates as one of the better Japanese starters ever to ply his trade at the game\u2019s highest level. Where does he rate among them? That\u2019s up for debate, certainly, but those interested in weighing the question can check out this list I compiled of ten prominent Japanese hurlers who\u2019ve compile a notable number of MLB starts.\n\nPhoto courtesy of USA Today Sports Images."}, {"url": "https://www.lookoutlanding.com/2021/1/12/22227985/seattle-mariners-hisashi-iwakuma-special-assignment-coach-mlb-news", "page_content": "In the biggest Seattle coaching news of the day, the Mariners have brought in Hisashi Iwakuma as a Special Assignment Coach.\n\nI don\u2019t know what that is. Sounds pretty made up.\n\nAccording to the club, Iwakuma will start his new gig during Spring Training and report directly to Jerry Dipoto. The most important part seems to be the specifics of this role, which involves working \u201cwith Mariners pitchers and pitching instructors at all levels\u201d and the ability to \u201cperiodically visit the team\u2019s minor league affiliates during the season\u201d. Another interesting note stated that Kuma will do some scouting in Japan with Manabu Noto, the scout who helped the Mariners sign Yusei Kikuchi.\n\nSome pretty simple dot connecting tells us that Iwakuma will likely be working pretty heavily with Kikuchi, the Mariners\u2019 most recent Japanese acquisition and the one who struggled the most upon arrival. Iwakuma is one of the more successful Japanese pitchers in recent MLB history; the Mariners are hoping Kikuchi doesn\u2019t go down as one of the bigger failures. To avoid this, it seems, they\u2019re going to have Iwakuma get in his ear regularly.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t know, at least at this point, is how much of this role will be baseball-related and how much will be person-related. Surely Iwakuma can help Kikuchi (and the rest of the pitchers, for that matter) learn how to navigate an MLB lineup. But he can also help with the mental side of pitching in the big leagues, and for Kikuchi specifically, how to do that while living away from home.\n\nIwakuma\u2019s credentials speak for themselves. He pitched 11 seasons in the NPB, won an MVP in 2008, a gold medal at the 2009 World Baseball Classic, made an MLB All-Star team, and pitched a no-hitter against the Orioles in 2015. All signs also indicate that Iwakuma is both a beloved clubhouse guy and a well of information.\n\nLove this! Kuma is the man! https://t.co/1abw8X7Bem \u2014 Taijuan Walker (@tai_walker) January 13, 2021\n\nHere\u2019s part of Jerry Dipoto\u2019s quote about the former Mariner pitcher who is now a Mariner coach.\n\n\u201cHe was always prepared, has a terrific work ethic, and the ability to communicate the things that made him a successful pitcher. We\u2019re looking forward to adding him to our mix at both the Major and minor league level.\u201d\n\nThe work in the minor leagues might low key be the most interesting part of this whole arrangement. It\u2019s no secret at all that most of the Mariners\u2019 currency is in the minor leagues. The team itself obviously thinks they have some good things going down there, but so much of that is either behind the scenes, dismissed by the common, MLB-centric fan, or both. Bringing on a respected figure with a track record of success to work with the minor league pitchers tells me that the front office believes they have some future MLB starters in the system. You wouldn\u2019t bring in Iwakuma to turn non-prospects into the 26th guy on the roster. You bring in Hisashi Iwakuma to make sure the guys you\u2019re banking on actually cash in on their prospect status.\n\nI have no idea if this will work! Neither do you! But having Hisashi Iwakuma back in the organization is, at the very least, a fun bit of news in this dormant offseason. It will be interesting to monitor this situation in terms of the updates that the team is willing to release to the public."}], "Hisashi Iwakuma won the Sawamura Award in 2008.": [{"url": "https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2020/10/19/baseball/eagles-mariners-pitcher-hisashi-iwakuma-retire/", "page_content": "Yomiuri Giants pitcher Hisashi Iwakuma, who has a combined 170 wins over his career in Japan and the major leagues, plans to retire at the end of the season, his club announced Monday.\n\nIwakuma returned to Nippon Professional Baseball in 2019 after six years with the Seattle Mariners but has yet to pitch for the Giants\u2019 top team due to lingering shoulder issues following a 2017 surgery that derailed his career in the majors.\n\nThe 39-year-old plans to speak at a press conference on Friday."}, {"url": "https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Hisashi_Iwakuma", "page_content": "Hisashi Iwakuma (\u5ca9\u9688 \u4e45\u5fd7)\n\nBats Right, Throws Right\n\nRight, Right Height 6' 3\", Weight 210 lb.\n\n6' 3\", 210 lb. High School Horikoshi High School\n\nBR page\n\nBiographical Information [ edit ]\n\nHisashi Iwakuma has won the Sawamura Award and starred on the international stage and in the US. He is the son-in-law of Koju Hirohashi.\n\nIwakuma was the 5th-round pick of the Kintetsu Buffaloes in the 2000 NPB draft. Spending most of his rookie year in the minors, he joined the team's rotation in '02, going 8-7 with a 3.69 ERA. In 2003 Iwakuma established himself as Kintetsu's ace, going 15-10 with a 3.45 ERA. He was sixth in the Pacific League in ERA and fourth in wins despite playing on a fifth-place team. Iwakuma did even better in '04, with a 15-2, 3.01 season. He led the PL in wins, was second to Daisuke Matsuzaka in ERA and didn't suffer a defeat till after the All-Star Game (starting off the year 12-0). The rest of the Kintetsu staff went 46-68 during the year.\n\nIwakuma received even more fame after the 2004 season. When the Buffaloes announced a merger with the Orix Blue Wave, Kintetsu's ace said he would not play for the new team. The merged Orix Buffaloes selected him in a draft of the former Buffalo and Blue Wave players, but Iwakuma continued his refusals. The usually-docile players' union threw their weight behind Iwakuma and the Buffaloes relented, letting Iwakuma go to the expansion Rakuten Golden Eagles instead.\n\nIwakuma's first season with Rakuten paled statistically in comparison with his last Kintetsu season. He was clearly the ace of the new squad though - his 4.99 ERA was the best by a starter and his 9-15 record gave him more wins than the next two pitchers combined. He also threw half of the team's 18 complete games. Hisashi did not pitch much in 2006, going 1-2 with a 3.72 ERA in six games. Shoulder injuries and new rules about pitch deliveries limited his effectiveness and playing time.\n\nIwakuma went 5-5 with a 3.40 ERA in 2007. After his three ineffective seasons from 2005-2007, Iwakuma turned things around in a big way in 2008. He went 21-4 with a 1.87 ERA. He edged Yu Darvish by .01 for the PL lead in ERA, led the league in innings (201 2/3), was third with 159 strikeouts (trailing Toshiya Sugiuchi and Darvish) and tied for second with two shutouts. That earned him Pacific League MVP honors. He became just the third MVP in Nippon Pro Baseball history from a 5th-place team, following Hiromitsu Ochiai (1982) and Hiromitsu Kadota (1988. Iwakuma also won the Sawamura Award as the best pitcher in Japan. No one had won 21 games in a NPB season since Yoshinori Sato in 1985.\n\nIwakuma pitched for the Japanese national team in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. He went 1-1 with a 1.35 ERA, allowing only 12 hits in 20 innings while striking out 15. He lost a 1-0 duel to Jung-keun Bong of South Korea, giving up a 4th-inning run on a walk to Jong-wook Lee and hits by Keun-woo Jeong and Tae-kyun Kim. He tossed a scoreless 7th inning in a win over Cuba. Iwakuma started the second game against Cuba, a make-or-break game; he tossed only 69 pitches in six shutout innings before Toshiya Sugiuchi completed the whitewash. It was the earliest Cuba had ever been eliminated from a major baseball tournament. Iwakuma then got the call from Tatsunori Hara to start the finale against South Korea. He allowed only one run in the first 7 innings (a homer by Shin-soo Choo) before giving up a second score in the 8th; he left with a 3-2 lead but Yu Darvish blew the save. Japan went on to win in the 10th. Iwakuma led the tournament in innings (20) and was second to Darvish in strikeouts. He made the All-Tournament team alongside fellow pitchers Daisuke Matsuzaka and Bong. Matsuzaka beat him out for MVP honors, but said that Iwakuma deserved them more.\n\nIwakuma fell to 13-6, 3.25 in 2009. He was 7th in the PL in ERA (between D.J. Houlton and Takayuki Kishi), tied for 5th in wins (with Kishi and Satoshi Nagai) and allowed a league-worst 179 hits. He rebounded a bit at 10-9, 2.82 in 2010, finishing 4th in ERA behind Darvish, Masaru Takeda and Masahiro Tanaka. He was 4th in innings (201), was 7th in losses, tied Chihiro Kaneko for second with 184 hits allowed (only Hideaki Wakui was worse), fanned 153 (7th-most) and had a 1.09 WHIP (4th after Darvish, Yoshihisa Naruse and Takeda).\n\nIwakuma with Seattle\n\nFollowing the 2010 season, Iwakuma's name was placed on the posting system by the Golden Eagles. The Oakland Athletics posted the highest bid to secure the right to negotiate a major league contract with him. Iwakuma turned down a 4-year, $15,250,000 offer from Oakland and opted to remain with Rakuten. He missed part of the season with a shoulder injury, being sidelined from May 18th to July 26th. He had been 3-2, 1.72 in 6 starts before the injury, and went 3-5, 2.87 after his return. He became a free agent after the season, and this time truly made the jump across the Pacific Ocean, signing with the Seattle Mariners. Surprisingly, he only agreed to a one-year contract worth $1.5 million, with potential performance bonuses of $3.4 million, much less than what he had turned down a year earlier. However, he explained that having a good relationship with a team - something he had not felt with Oakland - was more important than the money. He added that he and his family had taken an immediate liking to the city of Seattle and that he was looking forward to being a teammate of the great Ichiro Suzuki.\n\nIwakuma's time in the major leagues did not start off well. He pitched poorly during the Mariners' spring training in 2012, forcing the hand of manager Eric Wedge who announced he would not be part of the team's starting rotation to start the season. The plan was to use him in the bullpen to allow him to build back strength in his shoulder. Thus, he was on the M's special 28-man roster for their season-opening series against the Oakland Athletics in his native Japan, but in one of three spots designated as being ineligible to play during the Series, even though he made the trip across the Pacific Ocean. It took him until April 20th to make his debut, when he pitched four innings in relief of Hector Noesi and Erasmo Ramirez in a game against the Chicago White Sox. He was outstanding, only giving up a single hit during his stint; it was a solo homer by Adam Dunn, although it made little difference in the final 7-3 score in favor of the White Sox. He was the last player from all 30 teams' opening day rosters to make his season debut. He won his first game as a starter on July 30th, beating the Toronto Blue Jays, 4-1. In that game, he set a Mariners rookie record with 13 strikeouts, after surrendering a leadoff homer to Rajai Davis to start the game. He settled down nicely after that rough start, giving up no more runs in completing 8 innings, before turning the ball to Josh Kinney. He had been inserted in the starting rotation just before the All-Star break, but had had to fly back to Japan to be at the side of his ill father only a few days before. He ended the season with a record of 9-5, 3.16, in 30 games, with 16 starts, pitching 125 1/3 innings and striking out 101.\n\nIwakuma started the 2013 season as one of the best pitchers in the major leagues, placing his name among the ERA leaders from the start. He had a scoreless string of 23 2/3 innings in June, only broken by an unearned run allowed to the Houston Astros on June 10th, in a game he won, 3-2. That win improved his record to 7-1 and lowered his ERA to 1.79, trailing only Clay Buchholz's 1.71 at that point of the season. He finished the year at a very solid 14-6, 2.66 with a 1.01 WHIP and 185 K in 219 2/3 IP. He was chosen for the 2013 All-Star Game but did not play due to the Sunday starter rule; Chris Tillman replaced him. He finished among the 2013 AL leaders in ERA (3rd behind Anibal Sanchez and Bartolo Colon), wins (tied for 8th), WHIP (2nd to Max Scherzer), fewest hits per 9 IP (4th behind fellow ex-PL star Darvish, Scherzer and Justin Masterson), fewest walks per 9 (3rd behind David Price and Colon), innings (3rd behind James Shields and R.A. Dickey) and ERA+ (138, 6th, between Chris Sale and Shields). He was third in voting for the 2013 AL Cy Young Award, behind Scherzer and Darvish.\n\nPreparing for spring training in 2014, Iwakuma injured a finger while working out in southern California in January. He showed up in camp wearing a splint due to a strained tendon and had to lay off throwing for a month. The Mariners then announced that as a result, he would not be ready for the start of the season. As a result, he only made his first start on May 3rd, then had back-to-back starts of 8 innings without allowing a run in his second and third outings of the season. After a couple of games in which he was touched for 9 runs in 15 innings and suffered two losses, he bounced back with a gem on June 4th when he shut out the Atlanta Braves for seven innings, combining with two relievers for a 2-0 win. He ended the season with an excellent record of 15-9, 3.52 in 28 starts, and 154 Ks in 179 innings. He tied for 8th in the 2014 AL in wins, was 4th in WHIP (behind teammate Felix Hernandez, Sale and Garrett Richards), was second in walk rate (behind Phil Hughes) and was second in K:BB ratio (also behind Hughes).The Mariners were hoping to take a step forward in 2015 and were counting on Hisashi as one of the team's pillars, but after making only three starts in April, with a record of 0-1 and a 6.61 ERA, he went on the disabled list and was out until July 6th. he was roughed up in his first start back, allowing 5 runs in as many innings to the Detroit Tigers, increasing his ERA to 7.17, but then began pitching well after that. On August 12th, he threw a no-hitter against the Baltimore Orioles, allowing 3 walks and striking out 7, in what was the first complete game and shutout of his big league career. The Mariners won the game, 3-0, as he improved to 4-2 on the year and lowered his ERA to 3.86. He was the second Japanese-born pitcher to throw a no-hitter, after Hideo Nomo. He finished the season with a record of 9-5, 3.54 in 20 starts, logging 129 2/3 innings.\n\nIwakuma became a free agent after the 2015 season and was sought after by the Los Angeles Dodgers, who were looking to strengthen their starting rotation following the departure of co-ace Zack Greinke through free agency. The two sides came to a preliminary agreement on a three-year contract worth $45 million, but after two weeks of intense negotiations, they were unable to agree on the final details of the deal and the Mariners took advantage of the snag to scoop him up back into the fold, inking him on December 17th to a guaranteed one-year contract with two option years. So back he went to Seattle in 2016, but he started off slowly as by mid-May, he was only 1-4 with a 4.38 ERA in 8 starts. However, he won his last three starts of the month, then after going 2-2 in his first four June starts, began a tremendous streak on June 28th, when he beat the Pittsburgh Pirates, 5-2. Starting with that game, he won 7 of 8 starts, topped off with a 3-0 win over the Detroit Tigers on August 8th in which he tossed 7 shutout innings. The streak improved his record to 13-7 while lowering his ERA to 3.79. He ended the season at 16-12, 4.12.\n\nIn 2017, Iwakuma was set back by injuries and made only 6 starts, going 0-2, 4.35. He underwent major shoulder surgery in September and as a result missed all of 2018 after some setbacks while rehabbing in the minors. At 37, there was some question as to whether he would try to make a comeback. He stated that September that he would likely pursue his career back in Japan.\n\nIn 2021, he returned to the Mariners as a special assignment coach.\n\nNotable Achievements [ edit ]\n\nAL All-Star (2013)\n\n15 Wins Seasons: 2 (2014 & 2016)\n\n200 Innings Pitched Seasons: 1 (2013)\n\nFurther Reading [ edit ]\n\nGreg Johns: \"Iwakuma feels Seattle is right place for him: 'It all worked out,' righty says of Mariners reaching out to him after deal with Dodgers fell through\", mlb.com, December 18, 2015.

There\u2019s no immediate end in sight to my hectic schedule, but I\u2019m hoping to be able to get back to posting 2-3 times a week.\u00c2\n\nLet\u2019s start the comeback with a look a this year\u2019s race for the Sawamura Award. With apologies to Satoshi Komatsu and Colby Lewis, two pitchers have clearly separated themselves from the pack: Nippon Ham\u2019s\u00c2 Yu Darvish and Rakuten\u2019s\u00c2 Hisashi Iwakuma. Darvish\u2019s regular season is over, while Iwakuma still has another start left, but we have enough numbers to compare.

Both pitchers have sub-2.00 ERAs, sub-1.00 WHIPs, and 4+ K/BB ratios. Darvish has struck more guys out, but Iwakuma has better controlled the home run ball. Both guys have been outstanding by these metrics.\n\nSelected Accumulated Stats\n\n\u00c2 Games Starts CG Shutouts No-walk CG Wins Loses Win % IP Yu Darvish 25 24 10 2 2 16 4 0.800 200.2 Hisashi Iwakuma 27 27 5 2 3 20 4 0.833 195.2\n\nIwakuma has a big edge here in hitting the 20 win mark, becoming the first NPB 20-game winner since Kazumi Saito and Kei Igawa both did it in 2003. This is a particularly phenomenal achievement for a guy pitching for a last place team.\n\nDarvish has been a workhorse, throwing 200 innings in just 24 starts. It should be noted, however, \u00c2 that he threw two meaningless innings in Nippon Ham\u2019s 17-0 drubbing of Rakuten\u00c2 in the Fighters\u2019 last regular season game to reach 200.\n\n\u00c2 Hits Allowed HR Allowed K BB Runs Earned Runs Yu Darvish 136 11 208 44 44 42 Hisashi Iwakuma 158 3 155 35 48 42\n\nThe WHIP numbers shown above give an indication of how unhittable these guys have been this year, and these totals underscore that further. Despite Iwakuma\u2019s remarkable HR allowed total, overall Darvish has been even less hittable.\n\nThe Sawamura Award\n\nThe recipient of the Sawamura Award is decided by a panel of great NPB pitchers, who in part base their decision on the following criteria (courtesy of Wikipedia):\n\nGames started: 25\n\nWins: 15\n\nComplete games: 10\n\nW/L Percentage: .600\n\nInnings Pitched: 200\n\nERA: 2.50\n\nStrikeouts: 150\n\nWith the exception of Iwakuma\u2019s CG total (5), both pitchers meet all the criteria, or come so close that it doesn\u2019t matter. So it\u2019ll come down to what the selection committee values more highly: Iwakuma\u2019s win total for his also-ran team, or Darvish\u2019s general unhittable-ness.\n\nPersonally, my head says it\u2019s Darvish but my gut says it\u2019s Iwakuma. This would be an easier choice if the Fighters had scored a few more runs behind Darvish early in the season, but they didn\u2019t. Iwakuma was consistent throughout the whole year and helped give Rakuten\u2019s fans their first year of competitive baseball to cheer for. In the end, I think I\u2019d go for Iwakuma.\u00c2"}, {"url": "https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2019/02/27/baseball/japanese-baseball/hisashi-iwakuma-throws-practice-first-time-since-returning-japan-giants/", "page_content": "Former major league pitcher Hisashi Iwakuma on Wednesday threw for the first time in practice since making his return to Japanese baseball with the Yomiuri Giants.\n\nThe 37-year-old right-hander tossed 45 pitches, testing out a variety of balls at the Giants\u2019 preseason camp in Okinawa.\n\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019m just working out how much I can throw.

Wilson, Mark Buehrle, Japanese countryman Hiroki Kuroda of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Yu Darvish of Japan's Nippon Ham Fighters. Sabathia can become a free agent if he exercises an opt-out clause in his seven-year, $161 million contract with the New York Yankees this winter.\n\nIwakuma hired Paul Cobbe of Sosnick-Cobbe Sports as his new representative several months ago, but delayed the announcement out of respect for his community and the victims of the March earthquake and tsunami in Sendai, Japan, home of the Eagles. He had also been occupied until recently with rehabilitation from a shoulder injury that sent him to the disabled list in late May. Iwakuma recently rejoined Rakuten and his fastball was clocked at between 89 and 92 miles per hour in his last start.\n\nAlthough Iwakuma's decision will reverberate throughout Japan, Cobbe said the pitcher does not plan to address his professional future during the Golden Eagles' season.\n\n\"Iwakuma-san has instructed me not to discuss Major League Baseball with him during the 2011 season,\" Cobbe said. \"His sole focus is bringing a championship to Rakuten.\"\n\nIwakuma, 30, played in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens and the 2009 World Baseball Classic. In 2008 he won the Eiji Sawamura Award, the Japanese equivalent of the Cy Young Award.\n\nThe Oakland Athletics paid a reported $19.1 million posting fee to negotiate with Iwakuma last winter. But talks between the A's and Iwakuma's former agent, Don Nomura, broke down with no resolution, and the pitcher elected to return to Japan after the 30-day negotiating window expired. In early December, Nomura told reporters that the A's were insincere and \"never showed any respect\" to his client during the discussions.\n\nSince Iwakuma is currently in his 10th professional season in Japan, he will not be subject to a \"posting fee\" as a prelude to negotiations with a major league club. There are estimates that an MLB team will have to pay a posting fee in the $25 million-to-$50 million range to win the right to negotiate with Darvish this winter.\n\nSenior writer Jerry Crasnick covers Major League Baseball for ESPN.com."}, {"url": "http://www.npbtracker.com/2008/10/04/", "page_content": "Work and my upcoming home move have settled down a little bit, so it\u2019s time to catch up on a little NPB bloggin\u2019.

Despite Iwakuma\u2019s remarkable HR allowed total, overall Darvish has been even less hittable.\n\nThe Sawamura Award\n\nThe recipient of the Sawamura Award is decided by a panel of great NPB pitchers, who in part base their decision on the following criteria (courtesy of Wikipedia):\n\nGames started: 25\n\nWins: 15\n\nComplete games: 10\n\nW/L Percentage: .600\n\nInnings Pitched: 200\n\nERA: 2.50\n\nStrikeouts: 150\n\nWith the exception of Iwakuma\u2019s CG total (5), both pitchers meet all the criteria, or come so close that it doesn\u2019t matter. So it\u2019ll come down to what the selection committee values more highly: Iwakuma\u2019s win total for his also-ran team, or Darvish\u2019s general unhittable-ness.\n\nPersonally, my head says it\u2019s Darvish but my gut says it\u2019s Iwakuma. This would be an easier choice if the Fighters had scored a few more runs behind Darvish early in the season, but they didn\u2019t. Iwakuma was consistent throughout the whole year and helped give Rakuten\u2019s fans their first year of competitive baseball to cheer for. In the end, I think I\u2019d go for Iwakuma.\u00c2"}, {"url": "https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2013/10/28/baseball/flawless-tanaka-wins-sawamura-award/", "page_content": "Masahiro Tanaka followed up an amazing career first with something even more impressive the second time around.\n\nLess than 24 hours after striking out 12 during a complete-game victory in his Japan Series debut, the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles ace was named the Sawamura Award winner for the second time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy,\u201d Tanaka told Kyodo News. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest award a pitcher can receive.

Iwakuma put in an outstanding performance in the round two elimination game against Cuba, and again in the final when he left the game with a lead over Korea. He isn\u2019t a new face to NPB fans, but he\u2019s not a phenom like\u00c2 Yu Darvish\u00c2 and hasn\u2019t gotten much exposure abroad.\u00c2\n\nIt\u2019s been somewhat of a winding road to this point for Iwakuma. Let\u2019s take a look at how he got here.\n\n2002\n\nI was living near Osaka in 2002, when Iwakuma arrived on the scene for the local Kintetsu Buffaloes. The Buffaloes were coming off a Japan Series appearance, but had a pretty weak rotation, and he put up respectable numbers in his first full year. More than anything, I recall his funky two-stage delivery, and that people were talking about his as someone to watch in coming years.\n\n2003\n\nIwakuma broke out with a 15-10 record and 3.45 ERA in 195 2/3 innings, and along with Jeremy Powell gave the Buffaloes a solid front-end rotation. \u00c2 Kintetsu\u2019s power lineup was aging at that point though, and they weren\u2019t able to compete with the strong Fukuoka Daiei Hawks for the Pacific League title.\n\n2004\n\nIwakuma started the season with a 12-game winning streak and was the top vote-getting pitcher in the Pacific League for the All-Star game. \u00c2 Iwakuma plays in the Olympics later in the summer and finished with a 15-2 record.\n\nMore signficantly, the Kintetsu Buffaloes and Orix Blue Wave agreed to merge their baseball operations in the summer of \u201904, leading to the establishment of team currently known as the Orix Buffaloes. The merger spurred talks of contraction, which eventually led to a fan-supported players\u2019 strike and the creation of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles franchise. The merge was a sad event for me, as it meant the end of the Blue Wave name, which I really liked.\n\n2004-5 Offseason\n\nIwakuma refused to play for the merged Buffaloes team, and was traded to the Rakuten expansion team. Rakuten seemed to have a decent foundation to its rotation with Iwakuma and college ace Yasuhiro Ichiba. Ichiba never panned out, and was just recently traded.\n\n2005-7\n\nWilderness years. Two-stage delivery\u2019s were banned in NPB, forcing Iwakuma\u00c2 to re-work his mechanics. This video gives you a sense of the changes he had to make; you can see his Kintetsu-era windup from about 1:00-1:20*. He also struggled through injuries and had a doormat of an expansion team behind him until 2007.\n\n\u00c2 *note about the video: click the large button that says \u00e5\u2020\u008d\u00e7\u201d\u0178 to play the video. There is also an annoying comment feature that can be disabled if you click the button in the lower right of the video player, the one that kind of looks like a chick with a cartoon talk-bubble.\u00c2\n\n2008\n\nA big return to form. Iwakuma stayed healthy and apparently mastered his mechanics. The video I linked to above shows a change he made to his arm slot, which resulted in him getting more groundball outs, and dramatically reduced his home run rate. Despite his excellent season, Iwakuma was snubbed from the Olympic team, which in part allowed him to win a league-leading 21 games. He was the first 20-game winner in NPB since Kei Igawa\u00c2 and Kazumi Saito\u00c2 both won 20 in 2003, and the first 21-game winner since Yoshinori Sato\u00c2 in 1985.\u00c2\n\nFor his efforts, he was awarded the Sawamura Award as NPB\u2019s best pitcher, and the Pacific League MVP despite playing for a 5th-place team.\n\nThe Future\n\nIwakuma signed a 3-year, 1.1bn yen ($11m) deal with Rakuten after the 2008 season. It\u2019s uncommon for NPB players to sign multi-year deals prior to reaching free agency, so his contract is evidence that Rakuten really thinks highly of him. \u00c2 Since I was getting asked this during the NPB chats, as far as I can tell he has about five years of NPB service time, which means he has another four to go before reaching international free agency. Rakuten seems to be commited to building a competitive team around him."}, {"url": "https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Hisashi%20Iwakuma", "page_content": "Hisashi Iwakuma (\u5ca9\u9688 \u4e45\u5fd7)\n\nBats Right, Throws Right\n\nRight, Right Height 6' 3\", Weight 210 lb.\n\n6' 3\", 210 lb. High School Horikoshi High School\n\nBR page\n\nBiographical Information [ edit ]\n\nHisashi Iwakuma has won the Sawamura Award and starred on the international stage and in the US. He is the son-in-law of Koju Hirohashi.\n\nIwakuma was the 5th-round pick of the Kintetsu Buffaloes in the 2000 NPB draft. Spending most of his rookie year in the minors, he joined the team's rotation in '02, going 8-7 with a 3.69 ERA. In 2003 Iwakuma established himself as Kintetsu's ace, going 15-10 with a 3.45 ERA. He was sixth in the Pacific League in ERA and fourth in wins despite playing on a fifth-place team. Iwakuma did even better in '04, with a 15-2, 3.01 season. He led the PL in wins, was second to Daisuke Matsuzaka in ERA and didn't suffer a defeat till after the All-Star Game (starting off the year 12-0). The rest of the Kintetsu staff went 46-68 during the year.\n\nIwakuma received even more fame after the 2004 season. When the Buffaloes announced a merger with the Orix Blue Wave, Kintetsu's ace said he would not play for the new team. The merged Orix Buffaloes selected him in a draft of the former Buffalo and Blue Wave players, but Iwakuma continued his refusals. The usually-docile players' union threw their weight behind Iwakuma and the Buffaloes relented, letting Iwakuma go to the expansion Rakuten Golden Eagles instead.\n\nIwakuma's first season with Rakuten paled statistically in comparison with his last Kintetsu season. He was clearly the ace of the new squad though - his 4.99 ERA was the best by a starter and his 9-15 record gave him more wins than the next two pitchers combined. He also threw half of the team's 18 complete games. Hisashi did not pitch much in 2006, going 1-2 with a 3.72 ERA in six games. Shoulder injuries and new rules about pitch deliveries limited his effectiveness and playing time.\n\nIwakuma went 5-5 with a 3.40 ERA in 2007. After his three ineffective seasons from 2005-2007, Iwakuma turned things around in a big way in 2008. He went 21-4 with a 1.87 ERA. He edged Yu Darvish by .01 for the PL lead in ERA, led the league in innings (201 2/3), was third with 159 strikeouts (trailing Toshiya Sugiuchi and Darvish) and tied for second with two shutouts. That earned him Pacific League MVP honors. He became just the third MVP in Nippon Pro Baseball history from a 5th-place team, following Hiromitsu Ochiai (1982) and Hiromitsu Kadota (1988. Iwakuma also won the Sawamura Award as the best pitcher in Japan. No one had won 21 games in a NPB season since Yoshinori Sato in 1985.\n\nIwakuma pitched for the Japanese national team in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. He went 1-1 with a 1.35 ERA, allowing only 12 hits in 20 innings while striking out 15. He lost a 1-0 duel to Jung-keun Bong of South Korea, giving up a 4th-inning run on a walk to Jong-wook Lee and hits by Keun-woo Jeong and Tae-kyun Kim. He tossed a scoreless 7th inning in a win over Cuba. Iwakuma started the second game against Cuba, a make-or-break game; he tossed only 69 pitches in six shutout innings before Toshiya Sugiuchi completed the whitewash. It was the earliest Cuba had ever been eliminated from a major baseball tournament. Iwakuma then got the call from Tatsunori Hara to start the finale against South Korea. He allowed only one run in the first 7 innings (a homer by Shin-soo Choo) before giving up a second score in the 8th; he left with a 3-2 lead but Yu Darvish blew the save. Japan went on to win in the 10th. Iwakuma led the tournament in innings (20) and was second to Darvish in strikeouts. He made the All-Tournament team alongside fellow pitchers Daisuke Matsuzaka and Bong. Matsuzaka beat him out for MVP honors, but said that Iwakuma deserved them more.\n\nIwakuma fell to 13-6, 3.25 in 2009. He was 7th in the PL in ERA (between D.J. Houlton and Takayuki Kishi), tied for 5th in wins (with Kishi and Satoshi Nagai) and allowed a league-worst 179 hits. He rebounded a bit at 10-9, 2.82 in 2010, finishing 4th in ERA behind Darvish, Masaru Takeda and Masahiro Tanaka. He was 4th in innings (201), was 7th in losses, tied Chihiro Kaneko for second with 184 hits allowed (only Hideaki Wakui was worse), fanned 153 (7th-most) and had a 1.09 WHIP (4th after Darvish, Yoshihisa Naruse and Takeda).\n\nIwakuma with Seattle\n\nFollowing the 2010 season, Iwakuma's name was placed on the posting system by the Golden Eagles. The Oakland Athletics posted the highest bid to secure the right to negotiate a major league contract with him. Iwakuma turned down a 4-year, $15,250,000 offer from Oakland and opted to remain with Rakuten. He missed part of the season with a shoulder injury, being sidelined from May 18th to July 26th. He had been 3-2, 1.72 in 6 starts before the injury, and went 3-5, 2.87 after his return. He became a free agent after the season, and this time truly made the jump across the Pacific Ocean, signing with the Seattle Mariners. Surprisingly, he only agreed to a one-year contract worth $1.5 million, with potential performance bonuses of $3.4 million, much less than what he had turned down a year earlier. However, he explained that having a good relationship with a team - something he had not felt with Oakland - was more important than the money. He added that he and his family had taken an immediate liking to the city of Seattle and that he was looking forward to being a teammate of the great Ichiro Suzuki.\n\nIwakuma's time in the major leagues did not start off well. He pitched poorly during the Mariners' spring training in 2012, forcing the hand of manager Eric Wedge who announced he would not be part of the team's starting rotation to start the season. The plan was to use him in the bullpen to allow him to build back strength in his shoulder. Thus, he was on the M's special 28-man roster for their season-opening series against the Oakland Athletics in his native Japan, but in one of three spots designated as being ineligible to play during the Series, even though he made the trip across the Pacific Ocean. It took him until April 20th to make his debut, when he pitched four innings in relief of Hector Noesi and Erasmo Ramirez in a game against the Chicago White Sox. He was outstanding, only giving up a single hit during his stint; it was a solo homer by Adam Dunn, although it made little difference in the final 7-3 score in favor of the White Sox. He was the last player from all 30 teams' opening day rosters to make his season debut. He won his first game as a starter on July 30th, beating the Toronto Blue Jays, 4-1. In that game, he set a Mariners rookie record with 13 strikeouts, after surrendering a leadoff homer to Rajai Davis to start the game. He settled down nicely after that rough start, giving up no more runs in completing 8 innings, before turning the ball to Josh Kinney. He had been inserted in the starting rotation just before the All-Star break, but had had to fly back to Japan to be at the side of his ill father only a few days before. He ended the season with a record of 9-5, 3.16, in 30 games, with 16 starts, pitching 125 1/3 innings and striking out 101.\n\nIwakuma started the 2013 season as one of the best pitchers in the major leagues, placing his name among the ERA leaders from the start. He had a scoreless string of 23 2/3 innings in June, only broken by an unearned run allowed to the Houston Astros on June 10th, in a game he won, 3-2. That win improved his record to 7-1 and lowered his ERA to 1.79, trailing only Clay Buchholz's 1.71 at that point of the season. He finished the year at a very solid 14-6, 2.66 with a 1.01 WHIP and 185 K in 219 2/3 IP. He was chosen for the 2013 All-Star Game but did not play due to the Sunday starter rule; Chris Tillman replaced him. He finished among the 2013 AL leaders in ERA (3rd behind Anibal Sanchez and Bartolo Colon), wins (tied for 8th), WHIP (2nd to Max Scherzer), fewest hits per 9 IP (4th behind fellow ex-PL star Darvish, Scherzer and Justin Masterson), fewest walks per 9 (3rd behind David Price and Colon), innings (3rd behind James Shields and R.A. Dickey) and ERA+ (138, 6th, between Chris Sale and Shields). He was third in voting for the 2013 AL Cy Young Award, behind Scherzer and Darvish.\n\nPreparing for spring training in 2014, Iwakuma injured a finger while working out in southern California in January. He showed up in camp wearing a splint due to a strained tendon and had to lay off throwing for a month. The Mariners then announced that as a result, he would not be ready for the start of the season. As a result, he only made his first start on May 3rd, then had back-to-back starts of 8 innings without allowing a run in his second and third outings of the season. After a couple of games in which he was touched for 9 runs in 15 innings and suffered two losses, he bounced back with a gem on June 4th when he shut out the Atlanta Braves for seven innings, combining with two relievers for a 2-0 win. He ended the season with an excellent record of 15-9, 3.52 in 28 starts, and 154 Ks in 179 innings. He tied for 8th in the 2014 AL in wins, was 4th in WHIP (behind teammate Felix Hernandez, Sale and Garrett Richards), was second in walk rate (behind Phil Hughes) and was second in K:BB ratio (also behind Hughes).The Mariners were hoping to take a step forward in 2015 and were counting on Hisashi as one of the team's pillars, but after making only three starts in April, with a record of 0-1 and a 6.61 ERA, he went on the disabled list and was out until July 6th. he was roughed up in his first start back, allowing 5 runs in as many innings to the Detroit Tigers, increasing his ERA to 7.17, but then began pitching well after that. On August 12th, he threw a no-hitter against the Baltimore Orioles, allowing 3 walks and striking out 7, in what was the first complete game and shutout of his big league career. The Mariners won the game, 3-0, as he improved to 4-2 on the year and lowered his ERA to 3.86. He was the second Japanese-born pitcher to throw a no-hitter, after Hideo Nomo. He finished the season with a record of 9-5, 3.54 in 20 starts, logging 129 2/3 innings.\n\nIwakuma became a free agent after the 2015 season and was sought after by the Los Angeles Dodgers, who were looking to strengthen their starting rotation following the departure of co-ace Zack Greinke through free agency. The two sides came to a preliminary agreement on a three-year contract worth $45 million, but after two weeks of intense negotiations, they were unable to agree on the final details of the deal and the Mariners took advantage of the snag to scoop him up back into the fold, inking him on December 17th to a guaranteed one-year contract with two option years. So back he went to Seattle in 2016, but he started off slowly as by mid-May, he was only 1-4 with a 4.38 ERA in 8 starts. However, he won his last three starts of the month, then after going 2-2 in his first four June starts, began a tremendous streak on June 28th, when he beat the Pittsburgh Pirates, 5-2. Starting with that game, he won 7 of 8 starts, topped off with a 3-0 win over the Detroit Tigers on August 8th in which he tossed 7 shutout innings. The streak improved his record to 13-7 while lowering his ERA to 3.79. He ended the season at 16-12, 4.12.\n\nIn 2017, Iwakuma was set back by injuries and made only 6 starts, going 0-2, 4.35. He underwent major shoulder surgery in September and as a result missed all of 2018 after some setbacks while rehabbing in the minors. At 37, there was some question as to whether he would try to make a comeback. He stated that September that he would likely pursue his career back in Japan.\n\nIn 2021, he returned to the Mariners as a special assignment coach.\n\nNotable Achievements [ edit ]\n\nAL All-Star (2013)\n\n15 Wins Seasons: 2 (2014 & 2016)\n\n200 Innings Pitched Seasons: 1 (2013)\n\nFurther Reading [ edit ]\n\nGreg Johns: \"Iwakuma feels Seattle is right place for him: 'It all worked out,' righty says of Mariners reaching out to him after deal with Dodgers fell through\", mlb.com, December 18, 2015.
