The Australian actor took on the role of the heroic WSB agent on December 2, 1980, and says that even he can't believe that four decades have passed since his first day in Port Charles.\n\n\"To look back and think I've been associated with this show for 40 years is pretty incredible, but to try to put that into words is difficult,\" he shares with Soap Opera Digest. \"As someone once said, you can't dwell on the past; you're as good as your next show. As long as I can entertain people, I'm doing the right thing.\"\n\nRogers surmises that one of the reasons that Robert has stuck around for so long (minus sporadic breaks from the soap, which we break down below) is because the character has somehow managed to resonate with a wide spectrum of viewers of all ages.\n\n\"As the years have gone by, I've managed to attract an across-the-board demographic across the audience, which is great,\" he says. \"To think that from the '80s to now, 40 years down the line, people still like what I'm doing, that's really gratifying. You think to yourself, 'Yeah, I did the right thing. I'm not sure what I did, but I did the right thing!' I look back on it with a degree of pride.\"\n\nRogers' 40-year history with GH is one heck of a roller coaster. As longtime fans might recall, his Port Charles journey began with an action-packed 1981 storyline in which Robert was following Luke Spencer (Anthony Geary), who he thought knew the whereabouts of a rare and elusive diamond called the Ice Princess. Robert was posing as a playboy financier who wanted the diamond for financial reasons, and when the two men butted heads, Robert revealed to Luke and his fianc\u00e9e, Laura Webber (Genie Francis), that he was actually a WSB agent working undercover to find the Ice Princess and retrieve it before it got into the hands of the Cassadine family. Luke agreed to help him get it back and fight the Cassadines before they tried to take over the world, using this diamond to do it -- thus beginning a friendship between Robert and Luke, with Robert even standing up as Luke's best man at his wedding.\n\nCongratulations to the amazing @tristanrogers on an historic 40 years on @GeneralHospital! #GH wouldn't be the show it is today without this legend of daytime television. Happy Anniversary! https://t.co/w1n499sTFy \u2014 Frank Valentini (@valentinifrank) December 2, 2020\n\nSome of Robert's other storylines over the past four decades include a loving relationship with his daughter, Robin (Kimberly McCullough); an at-first rocky relationship with his brother, Mac (John York); a battle with a deadly virus that nearly killed everyone in Port Charles; delivering Lorenzo (Ted King) and Skye's (Robin Christopher) baby; catching Faison (Anders Hove) when he was pretending to be \"Duke\"; a couple of serious comas; being presumed dead in a boat explosion; and romances with scores of beautiful women like Jackie Templeton (Demi Moore), Holly Sutton (Emma Samms), Katherine Delafield (Edie Lehmann), and Anna Devane (Finola Hughes).\n\nAt this time, it's unclear if GH is planning a tribute to Rogers for his 40th anniversary or if any special material will air to mark the special occasion. Soap Central will keep you updated if further information becomes available.\n\nAfter joining GH in 1980, Rogers stayed with the ABC soap opera until 1992, when Robert was (wrongly) declared dead in a boat explosion. He returned to the series in 1995 in spirit form to comfort Robin, who had found out she was HIV-positive and was dealing with the death of her boyfriend, Stone (Michael Sutton), from AIDS-related illness. Rogers returned again for two short arcs in 2006, during which Robert was discovered to be very much alive.\n\nRogers once again stepped back into the role of Robert in 2008, for GH's primetime spin-off series General Hospital: Night Shift. He made it back to the original GH in 2012, when Robert believed Robin had died in a lab explosion, and again in 2013, when Robin was revealed to be alive. However, in November of 2013, it was announced that the actor would be departing the series to return to The Young and the Restless, where he'd played the role of Colin Atkinson from 2010 to 2011.\n\nRogers returned as GH's Robert in December of 2015, but he was also portraying Colin on Y&R at the same time, so his return was rather short; he only stayed until February of 2016 and made another brief return from August to September that same year. Rogers returned to GH in April of 2018 for a short story arc in which he aided Anna in trying to locate her long-lost son, Henrik Faison. He returned yet again from July to September that same year for another story arc in which Anna and Finn (Michael Easton) went missing. Fortunately, he reprised the role of GH's Robert once again in January of 2019 and has remained on the soap since on a recurring basis."}, {"url": "https://www.soapsindepth.com/posts/general-hospital/tristan-rogers-legacy", "page_content": "The end of this year will mark Tristan Rogers\u2019 40th anniversary playing GENERAL HOSPITAL\u2018s Robert Scorpio. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think of it that way, because I have come and gone several times,\u201d admitted the actor \u2014 who has returned for stints of various lengths since Scorpio was \u201ckilled off\u201d for the first time in 1992.

She\u2019s always been like that, you know.</p>\n\n32 / 168 <p>How was Laura \u2014 or <em>any</em> bride \u2014 supposed to compete with a diva in an outfit like this? The curse that Helena placed on the Spencers was almost superfluous!</p>\n\n33 / 168 <p><em>Aaanyway</em>\u2026 Laura and Luke\u2019s nuptials wound up being a simple affair\u2026 attended by some 30 million viewers, making it the most-watched episode of a soap opera in TV history.</p>\n\n34 / 168 <p>The newlyweds saw a bright future ahead of them. They just didn\u2019t realize how short it would be, at least at first.</p>\n\n35 / 168 <p>To this day, the Spencers\u2019 lavish wedding remains the standard against which all other soap ceremonies are measured.</p>\n\n36 / 168 <p>In other plots \u2014 and yes, there were some \u2014 once Monica Webber (Leslie Charleson) had for the most part stopped ping-ponging between Rick and his brother, Jeff, she focused her attentions on\u2026 well, as you can see, <em>General Hospital</em>\u2019s newest doctor, filthy-rich Alan Quartermaine (Stuart Damon).</p>\n\n37 / 168 <p>Alan\u2019s parents, Edward (David Lewis) and Lila (Anna Lee), knew better than to involve themselves in his squabbles with Monica. This, of course, did nothing to stop them from involving themselves in the Bickersons\u2019 quarrels.</p>\n\n38 / 168 <p>Here, Edward sits idly by waiting to see if Monica is going to remind his son of the time he almost dropped a roof on her and loverboy Rick. (Hey, we only said that she was done ping-ponging between the Webber boys, not that she was done ping-ponging.)</p>\n\n39 / 168 <p>Mind you, Alan was not without his own peccadilloes.

Let\u2019s rewind to the 1980s once more, shall we?</p>\n\n45 / 168 <p>In its Golden Age, <em>General Hospital</em> attracted a Who\u2019s Who of famous folks, among them Sammy Davis Jr., who passed through Port Charles as Eddie Phillips for a fraught family reunion with estranged son Bryan (Todd Davis) and daughter-in-law Claudia (Bianca Ferguson).</p>\n\n46 / 168 <p>Legendary funnyman Milton Berle briefly played Mickey Miller, the talent agent responsible for the career of B-movie starlet Tiffany Hill (Sharon Wyatt).</p>\n\n47 / 168 <p>Mickey was also the mover and shaker that turned Luke\u2019s bride into a supermodel who vanished in the fog on Port Charles\u2019 docks. That is, Mickey made Laura Miss Star Eyes; as far as we know, he had nothing to do with the weather that fateful night.</p>\n\n48 / 168 <p>After Laura\u2019s disappearance, Luke teamed up with reporter Jackie Templeton (then Demi Moore) in hopes of finding not only his wife but her sister.</p>\n\n49 / 168 <p>Jackie\u2019s younger sibling, Laura (Janine Turner), did turn up. But Luke\u2019s Laura? No such luck.</p>\n\n50 / 168 <p>Viewers didn\u2019t buy Laura 2.0 as a new love interest for Luke. And they soon discovered that they preferred Jackie with Luke\u2019s BFF Robert than with Luke.</p>\n\n51 / 168 <p>In the 1980s, it was tough for Robert to go anywhere without running into someone with whom he\u2019d been involved.

Yeah, his little black book really wasn\u2019t little at all.</p>\n\n52 / 168 <p>\u201cWidower\u201d Luke\u2019s romance with impish con artist Holly Sutton (Emma Samms) was just heating up when he was \u201cfatally\u201d snowed in by an avalanche. (On <em>General Hospital</em>, matters of life and death have pretty much always belonged in air quotes.)</p>\n\n53 / 168 <p>To save Holly from deportation in 1983, Robert (Tristan Rogers) stepped up and made his \u201clate\u201d buddy\u2019s pregnant girlfriend his wife. As you can see, she wasn\u2019t the <em>least</em> bit nervous.</p>\n\n54 / 168 <p>Really, it <em>was</em> convenient for the Scorpios to be hitched once they realized that they\u2019d fallen for one another. Naturally, that was when Luke thawed out enough to return to Port Charles alive and well\u2026 ticked.</p>\n\n55 / 168 <p>Losing Holly to Robert turned out to be a blessing in disguise for Luke, who\u2019d have had a lot of explaining to do once Laura emerged from the fog with a wild story about having been held prisoner for years by Stavros Cassadine.</p>\n\n56 / 168 <p>Monica\u2019s ex, Jeff (future <em>MacGyver</em> star Richard Dean Anderson), tried in vain to get virginal Nurse Anne Logan (Susan Pratt) to play doctor with him.</p>\n\n57 / 168 <p>Noah Drake (Rick Springfield) also attempted to get Anne to sample his bedside manner.

Or so we can hope!</p>\n\n85 / 168 <p>In the early 1990s, Robert was also reunited with estranged sibling Mac Scorpio (John J. York). As you know, they ultimately made peace.

But first\u2026 about that nap\u2026</p>\n\n102 / 168 <p>An insta-hit with the soap\u2019s viewers, Jackson went on to score five Emmys and, recasts notwithstanding, basically <em>own</em> the role of Luke and Laura\u2019s firstborn.</p>\n\n103 / 168 <p>It was while helping Elizabeth Webber (Rebecca Herbst) recover from a sexual assault that Lucky realized that he was in love with Audrey\u2019s granddaughter.</p>\n\n104 / 168 <p>Lucky was understandably horrified to learn that back in the day, Dad had forced himself on Mom \u2014 and still, they\u2019d forged a life together.</p>\n\n105 / 168 <p>During Jackson\u2019s breaks from <em>General Hospital</em>, Lucky was recast with two other Emmy winners \u2014 Jacob Young (best known as Rick Forrester on <em>The Bold and the Beautiful</em>) and Greg Vaughan (later Eric Brady on <em>Days of Our Lives</em>).

For most of the second season of Night Shift, which airs its finale tonight (Oct. 21), Rogers has played the aging super spy he originated and brought to fame on GH in the \u201980s, Robert Scorpio. Head writer Sri Rao sought him out to do an arc in which he found out that he had cancer, and, in coming to terms with it, he reconnected with his family. To say he was happy that he signed on would be an understatement.\n\n\u201dThe only other experience I had that was as significant was in 1981 on General Hospital, when we were the biggest and the baddest, and whatever we did just soared,\u201d said the Australian native. \u201dThis [storyline] was about the deconstruction of an iconic character done in a way it hadn\u2019t been done before. Characters like mine don\u2019t get colon cancer. They get shot, they get beaten up, they get hit by trains. They don\u2019t get colon cancer. It\u2019s not very glamorous. I thought it was a hell of a challenge, more than the usual fare that you\u2019re given going into this: Go through the investigation, find the bad guys, have a gunfight, get a schmooze\u2026.This was a whole different animal.\u201d\n\nWorking with co-stars Kimberly McCullough and Finola Hughes was a given, and Rogers relished building on all the history they shared. But the special treat was getting to have a dream sequence with his old GH buddies Tony Geary, Sharon Wyatt, and John Reilly.\n\n\u201dI have to say it was like we had never been apart. We all just saw one another and it was like any other day that we had worked together. It was like no time at all had passed. Of course, 20 years had passed,\u201d he said. \u201dWe just started being wise-asses with each other.\u201d\n\nThere was also a personal aspect to playing a cancer patient for Rogers. \u201dMy father had gone through this and lots of friends. And they\u2019d all died. So I thought, maybe along the way, if somebody watches this and sees what we\u2019re doing, they might go out and get tested. And if we inspired that, then it\u2019s a bonus.\u201d\n\nAs for whether he could take the growth that his character has made and move it over to GH, Rogers doesn\u2019t think that should even be an issue, because what they\u2019ve done on Shift is so uniquely it\u2019s own thing that it doesn\u2019t \u201dfit in over there.\u201d\n\n\u201dNight Shift now doesn\u2019t even need the term General Hospital. It\u2019s got its own identity. This is the real significance of what we\u2019ve done,\u201d he says. \u201dWe could do that with any of the ABC soaps. Literally, they can reinvent themselves. We\u2019re not just talking about shows that are there [right now]. We\u2019re talking about shows like Ryan\u2019s Hope, Edge of Night, and The City. Dig in, grab a piece of their history, pepper it with a couple of vets as an anchor, bring in new people with their issues\u2026and awaaaay we go. We\u2019ve reinvented the entire genre.

At the time, the Disney-owned station had been focusing on repeats of soaps \u2014 including ABC\u2019s All My Children, One Life to Live, and General Hospital \u2014 and Night Shift marked its first original scripted series.\n\nWith an initial order of 13 episodes, SOAPnet said that Night Shift would \u201cdelve deeper into the relationships, friendships, and medical cases seen at the hospital,\u201d with self-contained episodes featuring younger characters from the world of Port Charles. The idea was that Night Shift would lure younger watchers to both SOAPnet and to General Hospital \u2014 and at a discount, since Night Shift would use writers and sets from the mothership show.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to growing the soap genre and the General Hospital franchise by expanding its storyline only on SOAPnet,\u201d Brian Frons, then the daytime president of the Disney-ABC Television Group, said at the time, per Soap Central. \u201cGeneral Hospital: Night Shift will launch with an audience that is already dedicated and compelled to know more about what happens on the night shift at the hospital.\u201d\n\nNight Shift has strong vitals at first. The series premiere on July 12, 2007 attracted 1 million total viewers, including nearly half a million 18-to-49-year-old women, per Broadcasting & Cable. The latter total made the Night Shift premiere the second-most viewed cable program in that demographic that night, which was particularly impressive considering SOAPnet reached 64 million U.S. households, while leader USA Network reached 94 million.\n\nOn the show, new faces \u2014 including Star Wars veteran Billy Dee Williams \u2014 made the rounds with known General Hospital entities \u2014 including Kimberly McCullough, Antonio Sabato Jr., and Steve Burton.\n\nAfter just five weeks of Night Shift on air, though, viewers learned of complications behind the scenes. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what kind of physical and creative toll [Night Shift] would take on the GH team,\u201d Frons told TV Week that August. \u201cWhile the GH numbers have been great, people are getting tired. So I have to figure out how to keep the energy in both programs.\u201d\n\nAnd critics gave dire prognoses to Night Shift\u2019s first 13 episodes. Soap columnist Marlena De Lacroix trashed the freshman season as \u201can incoherently written and produced mess.\u201d De Lacroix added, \u201cDaytime should have learned its lesson: You just can\u2019t get two soaps for the price of one.\u201d\n\nBut with Season 2, which premiered in July 2008, a new head writer and executive producer \u201ctransform[ed] what had been in its freshman season a perfectly putrid spin-off of a soap opera that is now a mere shadow of its fantastic former self into a sophomore series that embodied almost everything that was sublime about its mothership back in its heyday,\u201d as critic Ed Martin observed.\n\nEven De Lacroix came around. \u201cDarlings, if they could only bottle [Night Shift Season 2], they\u2019d save soap operas,\u201d she blogged. \u201c[It] expertly delivered traditional soap opera in a modern form while reinforcing love as the center of the medium, instead of devaluing it as so many soaps do today.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, for reasons not entirely clear, SOAPnet pulled the plug on Night Shift after Season 2, with TV Guide Canada reporting in December 2008 that the network had \u201cno plans\u201d for a third season.\n\nAt least fans still get glimpses of Night Shift on General Hospital from time to time. Sonya Eddy, for example, is still playing Epiphany Johnson on GH, more than 13 years after working her last Night Shift."}, {"url": "https://michaelfairmantv.com/the-tristan-rogers-interview-general-hospital/2009/07/27/", "page_content": "\n\nOn-Air On-Soaps continuing coverage of General Hospital continues this week with several features surrounding the troubling state of the ratings of the venerable soap, and the genre in general. I had the opportunity to catch up with the outspoken and brilliant actor of both General Hospital and GH: Night Shift, Tristan Rogers, who has played Robert Scorpio on and off for decades. Tristan was taking part in the west coast DVD release party of Roger Newcomb\u2019s and Gregori J. Martin\u2019s film Manhattanites, starring many familiar daytime faces. The two of us took time out from the festivities to discuss what\u2019s going down in soap land.\n\nTristan and I chat about these hot topics: what\u2019s going on with \u201cGH\u201d and how can it gets back on track in the ratings and excite fans again, why no season three of GH: Night Shift, the controversy over who is Ethan\u2019s true biological father, Luke or Robert, and the fate of the Daytime Emmys. Plus, as the one-time producer of Michael Jackson\u2019s 30th anniversary concert, Tristan and I delve into the tragic death of the world\u2019s biggest superstar.\n\nAlways on the cutting edge, online reports have indicated that Tristan\u2019s next move could be a part in the web series Imaginary Bitches starring Eden Riegel. But for now, enjoy our feature with him. Here\u2019s Tristan!\n\nListen to the audio:\n\n[display_podcast]\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nYou are here tonight to support director and producer Gregori J. Martin, even though you were not in his most recent release, Manhattanites.\n\nTRISTAN:\n\nThat is because I have done two of Gregori\u2019s movies. I did Raven and the one before that, Jack Rio.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nI have been reading your blogs at www.tristanrogers.com and everything you have written is quite commendable. It is direct and honest in regards to the quagmire daytime soaps find themselves in.\n\nTRISTAN:\n\nI do enjoy trying to make sense out of the situation and approach what is going on in the daytime world from a common sense situation, rather than being hysterical about it. It\u2019s taking me awhile, but I actually see the networks side of the coin, and I see the fans side of the coin. Consequently, I see what is happening and why it\u2019s happening. Frankly, its time for Guiding Light \u2026 72 years is a long run for a show in broadcasting. On the other hand, you know, I don\u2019t quite know if I want to see it happening the way it is happening now. I think there is a better way to bring it about.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nWhat do you think of the declining ratings of \u201cGH\u201d, that is the talk of the soap world right now?\n\nTRISTAN:\n\nI think General Hospital, of all the soaps, is in a real quandary because \u201cGH\u201d is constantly fighting its past, and in particular, it\u2019s fighting its past now. It seems to suddenly have become a real issue. When I went back to the show in 2006 it was starting to bubble, and I don\u2019t know if comments I made at the time helped it bubble up a bit hotter. But, I think what you have got now is an issue with the core body of fans. \u201cGH\u201d has a core body of fans that support it with whatever is happening. Now that core body of fans is deserting it, and when the last one turns off, that\u2019s it. The new fans will not support it in a way that the older, foundational group will. I have been saying for sometime, \u201cThis is the group you have to have be supporting.\u201d The show needs to try and maintain these fans and get that group solidified, and then go after the other groups. But, you must keep that fan base and foundation. When you have got no foundation, there is nothing to build on.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nPatrick and Robin are the morale center these days in Port Charles. What is left are many mobsters. In the days when you were starring on the show there was heart to the show that seems to be lacking now. Recently, the show launched the storyline: \u201cWho was Ethan\u2019s biological father\u2026 Luke or Robert?\u201d You were quite vocal about that at the time this played out on air. Do you think this is the way it will remain \u2026 Luke and Ethan are truly father and son?\n\nTRISTAN:\n\nI still think that is up in the air. That has been created in such a vague way as to literally be twisted any which way you wanted it to be twisted. I think that was done deliberately. When that storyline first got suggested to me, they said to me, \u201cRobert was going to turn out to be the father,\u201d and I remember saying to myself at that time, \u201cThat does not make any sense! Why at this particular time now? They have a whole lot of contractual actors over there, that aren\u2019t used a whole lot\u2026why would they bring somebody else on and just turn around and go; \u201cOK, you\u2019re it.\u201d I had a problem whether that would actually come to pass. So far it hasn\u2019t\u2026 but anything can happen.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nThen also came the sad news that SOAPnet was not bringing back another season of GH: Night Shift, which was surprising because creatively it kicked-butt last season with you at the center of it!\n\nTRISTAN:\n\nI knew that it was not coming back and being renewed a while ago. Night Shift was a wonderful glimpse of what was possible to do with a daytime format and a primetime format, shot in HD, edited like a movie, and essentially brought up to date, which was subtle. It was written by Sri Rao, who really understood the genre. He really got it, and there was no messing with him. I think this is an issue of what goes on with the daytime soaps. There are not too many people out there now who want to take what history there is, and take it and build on it. I can see why they don\u2019t want to do that, but on the other hand, I don\u2019t think there is much point in changing history for the sake of change. If you have a really good reason to change it then do it, otherwise use it!\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nRobert\u2019s colon cancer storyline was so poignant. It was a performance that if it could have been in Emmy contention this year, it would stand among the best. How did you feel about how the storyline played out?\n\nTRISTAN:\n\nIt was certainly something much meatier that we saw Robert involved in before, and in a very real way. We saw this character dealing with something he couldn\u2019t deal with, and so I said, \u201cI am just going to let it all hang out.\u201d I said, \u201cI am going to go for broke on this, and I am not going to hold anything back.\u201d Everybody was like, \u201cBut Robert is this unbreakable character.\u201d Not in this show, he\u2019s not! This time around we are going to see a side of him that we hadn\u2019t seen before, and it totally worked. I don\u2019t think it took anything away from the character at all. I f he were to walk back to the show now and kick someone\u2019s ass, they would go, \u201cLook how terrific! He\u2019s back.\u201d\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nThe relationship you have on-screen with Kimberly McCullough (Robin) and Finola Hughes (Anna) is always must-see television. Why does it work so well?\n\nTRISTAN:\n\nThe three of us together\u2026 there is such a connection there that I can\u2019t put into words. When the three of us are together, it\u2019s just there! Everything\u2019s right and we don\u2019t have to look at one another, and we meld together.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nWould you go back to \u201cGH\u201d for something that made sense for Robert?\n\nTRISTAN:\n\nOh, absolutely! Regardless, I get frustrated with the place, but I have an enormous emotional connection to \u201cGH\u201d. It\u2019s like having a bad emotional child. They might grow up and do bad stupid things, but you still love them.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nWhat did you think when none of the three major networks that broadcast daytime soaps passed on airing the Daytime Emmys this year, and it landed on the CW?\n\nTRISTAN:\n\nIt\u2019s a further indication that the networks are distancing themselves from the genre; in the fact they did not want to show it at all. And yet, it\u2019s rather interesting. You kind of wonder: What would happen to the Daytime Emmys if there were no soaps in the Daytime Emmys? Does that mean that the networks would go, \u201cIt\u2019s cool now. It\u2019s all full of talk shows now?\u201d I think for the soaps to have what we had in the 80\u2019s, you have to have someone step up to the plate with that kind of gritty vision that Gloria Monty (ex-exec prod, \u201cGH\u201d) had with a chair in one hand and a bull whip in the other hand and say, \u201cThis is the way were are going to do it!\u201d That\u2019s what she did and we need that now. I don\u2019t know who is out there that can do that, but it\u2019s going to take an individual like that to drag daytime out of its malaise.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nAre you and Tony Geary (Luke) close?\n\nTRISTAN:\n\nOh, yes. We don\u2019t see each other much, but when we are together it\u2019s great. We pick up a conversation that ended a few years ago and it\u2019s like it just started again.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nTony could win his 7th Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor at next month\u2019s Daytime Emmy ceremonies. If so, he would stand alone as the most decorated and honored actor of all time in the soaps.\n\nTRISTAN:\n\nTony has put his heart and soul into daytime. I cannot claim to do that because I left. Tony sat down and made a career out of it, and Tony is the consummate actor. I can see why he does a lot of things he does. I can see why he walks on the wild side, when it comes to what he has done with some of the history on the show. You can\u2019t in his position\u2026 you can\u2019t let the history bind you or contain what performances you might have, even if it\u2019s going to ruffle a few feathers, and that is kind of what he has done here. I never had to deal with history the way he had to deal with it because I wasn\u2019t here. But if I would have had to deal with it, I am not quite sure of how I would have handled it. It\u2019s one of those imponderable questions.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nWould you ever consider executive producing or writing for a soap?\n\nTRISTAN:\n\nAbsolutely, if the right situation came along.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nI know you produced Michael Jackson\u2019s 30th Anniversary show. How did you feel about the death of Michael?\n\nTRISTAN:\n\nIt was totally unexpected. On the other hand, there were a lot of questions being asked, \u201cDoes anyone think he can actually do 50 shows?\u201d I thought to myself, \u201cI don\u2019t see him getting through that. I don\u2019t think he has the stamina for it.\u201d When we did the 30th anniversary of the Michael Jackson show in Madison Square Garden, he was looking a little worse for wear then, and that was in 2001! A lot has happened in the last 8 years. A great talent has been taken from us. The media are going to make hay from this for a long time.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nDid you know him at all?\n\nTRISTAN:\n\nI cannot say he was a friend. I worked with him professionally. He came around to my place once. He knew David Gest very well, and David Gest and I have done a lot of shows together. I know this caught David by surprise, and everyone else as well! It\u2019s a terrible shame!"}, {"url": "https://www.soapoperaspy.com/2021/gh-spoilers-the-scorpios-come-together-as-roberts-cancer-returns/", "page_content": "General Hospital (GH) spoilers tease that the Scorpio family will come together in future episodes of General Hospital when Robert Scorpio\u2019s (Tristan Rogers) cancer returns and he goes under the knife!\n\nGeneral Hospital Spoilers \u2013 Robert\u2019s Cancer Story Played Out On SoapNet\u2019s GH Spinoff, \u201cNight Shift\u201d\n\nLongtime General Hospital viewers who had access to SoapNet on their cable systems may have watched the General Hospital spinoff \u201cNight Shift\u201d. In October 2008, Robert Scorpio faced an enemy he couldn\u2019t take down on his own; colon cancer! Robert had been found after narrowly escaping a plane crash near Port Charles. Jagger Cates (Antonio Sabato, Jr.) had rescued Robert and brought him to General Hospital, where Dr. Patrick Drake (Jason Thompson) did some tests and found a brain tumor.\n\nAfter the brain tumor was found Patrick ordered an additional MRI and other oncology tests and found that Robert also had colon cancer, and the brain tumor had spread from his colon. Robert slipped into a coma before he made it through alive after surgeries to remove the tumors and he experienced dreams of himself, Anna Devane, (Finola Hughes) their daughter Robin Scorpio, (Kimberly McCullough) Luke Spencer, (Anthony Geary) Sean Donely (John Reilly) and Tiffany Donely (Sharon Wyatt) in the old days in the 1980s. He came out of the coma on October 14, 2008 and left for further treatment in Europe, not returning to Port Charles again until 2012, and has appeared in a recurring manner ever since.\n\nGH Spoilers \u2013 Will Robin Scorpio-Drake Return?\n\nOne question that General Hospital viewers are bound to have is whether Robin Scorpio-Drake will return with her father again in dire straits. It is certainly possible, with her last appearance having been several months ago in the episode honoring their old friend Sean Donely. General Hospital viewers will recall that Anna had obtained the formula for the antidote for a toxin that Cesar Faison (Anders Hove) from Sean and Tiffany\u2019s daughter Annie Donely (Caitlin Reilly) that was instrumental in saving the life of Harrison Chase (Josh Swickard) in that episode.\n\nKimberly McCullough has reprised the role of Robin several times in the past few years, so it will be likely she will return for a brief arc although nothing has been announced. Robin was instrumental in saving her father\u2019s life from cancer in 2008. Felicia Scorpio (Kristina Wagner) is returning to General Hospital, and although she will be supporting her daughter Maxie Jones (Kirsten Storms) in a different storyline, she will certainly be needed by Mac Scorpio (John J. York) as he deals with Robert\u2019s illness.\n\nGeneral Hospital Spoilers \u2013 Will Robert\u2019s Colon Cancer Recur, Or A Different Type Or Cancer At All?\n\nWhile there is a possibility that Robert would need surgery for something other than his cancer recurring, such as a gunshot from Peter August (Wes Ramsey) it seems that cancer surgery may be much more of a serious and dramatic storyline for General Hospital viewers to watch. It definitely sounds like there will be a life and death situation for Robert, and with his advanced age it may make recovery much more difficult! But Robert is a tough old bird, as Luke might have put it, but it sounds like it may be touch and go in his surgery. Other General Hospital spoilers hint that Luke may have passed, and it would be very difficult for longtime General Hospital fans to deal with two deaths of General Hospital icons close together. It was hard enough losing the ones who were lost in 2021! Viewers can expect these storylines to run in 2022.\n\nStay tuned to General Hospital, and keep checking General Hospital spoilers frequently for all the latest news, updates and developments!"}, {"url": "https://soaps.sheknows.com/soaps/news/1940/general-hospital-night-shift-season-two-updated/", "page_content": "Updated on July 21, 2008:\n\n* Warning: Casting Teaser *\n\nWe are all anxiously awaiting the new season of Night Shift and all its characters are going to bring to the canvas this year.
