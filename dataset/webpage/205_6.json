{"Hephaestion was in command of the Companion cavalry on the left wing in the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC.": [{"url": "https://www.livius.org/articles/person/hephaestion/", "page_content": "Hephaestion\n\nHephaestion (c.357-324): Macedonian nobleman, closest friend and lover of king Alexander the Great. During the expedition against Persia, he served sometimes as a military commander, but he was probably a better organizer.\n\nYouth\n\nHephaestion\n\nAccording to a document that is included in Arrian of Nicomedia's Indik\u00ea,note[Quoted here.] Hephaestion was born in the capital of ancient Macedonia, Pella. His father Amyntor must have been an important man, because his son was educated at the court of king Philip (360-336). The Greek name of Hephaestion's father suggests that he was one of the Greek mercenary leaders or intellectuals who came to Macedonia and received an honorable treatment. (The father of Alexander's admiral and friend Nearchus is another example.)\n\nMieza, nymphaeum\n\nWhen he was still young, Hephaestion met the crown prince Alexander. Although an explicit connection between Hephaestion and the famous Macedonian scientist and philosopher Aristotle of Stagira is not mentioned in our best sources, we may assume that Hephaestion, like Alexander, was educated by Aristotle, whose school in the Nymphaeum of Mieza (below modern Naousa) was situated in one of the most beautiful and green parts of Macedonia. If we are to believe Diogenes Laertius, the author of several entertaining Lives of Eminent Philosophers, Aristotle published a collection of letters to Hephaestion,note[Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers 5.1.27.] which suggests that the two wrote to each other during Alexander's Persian campaign. However, Diogenes is not always a reliable author.\n\nAnatolia\n\nHephaestion is first mentioned at the very beginning of the histories of Alexander's Persian campaign, when the invaders reached Troy (May 334). He is never introduced as 'a friend' or 'a companion' of the king; he is simply mentioned, which suggests that the historians assumed that everybody knew Hephaestion's position as Alexander's lover. (We don't have to introduce Juliet once Romeo is on the stage.)\n\nAt Troy, Alexander venerated the ancient heroes. It is said that he went to the tomb of his legendary ancestor Achilles and that Hephaestion sacrificed to Achilles' friend Patroclus. Again, this suggests that Hephaestion was Alexander's lover, because in the fourth century, it was widely believed that the two legendary heroes had been lovers. (Homer states that they used to spend the night separately - a remark that is only meaningful when it was already taken for granted that the two were lovers.)\n\nIf the parallel between Achilles and Patroclus on the one hand and Alexander and Hephaestion on the other hand was really perfect, Hephaestion was - like Patroclus - older than his lover. Since Alexander was born in the summer of 356, we may assume that his friend was born in, say, 357.\n\nAfter the visit to Troy, Hephaestion disappears for some time from our sources. This suggests that he was with Alexander and did not occupy commands worth mentioning. It is only after the battle of Issus (November 333) that we reencounter Hephaestion in our sources, in a famous anecdote. After the Macedonian victory, queen Statira was captured. She went to Alexander and kneeled down in front of Hephaestion, thinking that he was the king. Alexander saved her face by saying \"Don't worry, mother. Everywhere, he is Alexander too\".\n\nDetail of the Alexander sarcophagus, probably Hephaestion\n\nIt is possible that Hephaestion is depicted on the Alexander sarcophagus. If the identification is correct, Hephaestion fought on horseback during the battle of Issus.\n\nThe Levant\n\nAlexander was now twenty-three and Hephaestion may have been twenty-four or older. According to the Macedonian and Greek ideas about love and sexuality, the time for homosexual affairs was over. The young men had to marry. Hephaestion could no longer be Alexander's lover, and had to find a new role, especially since the king accepted a Persian mistress, Barsine. However, the friendship between the two men remained very close.\n\nHephaestion was sent on a diplomatic mission to Sidon, where he had to appoint a new king. He chose a man named Abdalonymus. This was not a very important task, but it should be noted that he had not had earlier assignments. During the next year, he commanded the navy of the Phoenician towns that had sided with the conquerors; this meant that he had to supply the main force. This was a more important job. (It should be noted that these assignments are not mentioned in our most important source, Arrian.)\n\nDuring Alexander's stay in Egypt (first half 331), Hephaestion was approached by a friend of the Athenian politician Demosthenes, an enemy of the Macedonians. The envoy said that he hoped that Hephaestion would put in a good word for Demosthenes with Alexander. It is unclear whether Hephaestion was persuaded, or, if he was, what was the result.\n\nOn October 31, 331, the Macedonians and Persians fought a large battle at Gaugamela in northern Mesopotamia. Hephaestion was now one of the members of Alexander's bodyguard, the somatophylakes. (In fact, these seven men were not real bodyguards but adjutants.) During this bloody battle, he was wounded in an arm.\n\nThe Philotas Affair\n\nAgain, Hephaestion disappears from our sources for some time, except for an undated assignment as guard and protector of Persian captives. He becomes \"visible\" again in October 330, when several soldiers conspired against Alexander. Almost immediately, it became clear that the commander of the Companion cavalry (the best soldiers in the Macedonian army), Philotas, had known of the plans and had not reported his discovery.\n\nAt first, Alexander forgave Philotas, but the next day, the accusations were renewed by the phalanx commanders Craterus and Coenus, Philotas' brother-in-law. It is not known whether they had a secret agenda, but we may be suspicious, as we see two infantry commanders accusing the leading cavalry commander. During the night, Philotas was arrested.\n\nAs the army exercised capital jurisdiction in Macedonia, Alexander organized a trial. He accused Philotas and the court found him guilty of conspiracy. However, the precise nature of the conspiracy was unclear. Hephaestion, Craterus and Coenus declared that torture should be employed to force the truth out of Philotas. He confessed that he and his father had wanted to kill Alexander to become kings themselves. After this confession, the commander of the Companions was executed.\n\nWhat to make of this story? No one doubts that the first conspiracy was a fact, but the existence of the conspiracy of Philotas and Parmenion is another matter. The confession of the tortured man can, of course, not be taken as proof. On the other hand, it is strange that Philotas did not report the first conspiracy. It is possible that he wanted to see what happened: if the soldiers' attempt failed, nothing was lost, if it were successful, the army would chose him as its commander and king. He had much to gain, but the fact that he had a motive does not mean that he really did what he was accused of. We will never known what really happened.\n\nThe consequences of the murder were clear. In the first place, the execution of Philotas made the murder of his father Armenian inevitable - and in fact, he was killed. In the second place, the Companion cavalry was placed under two men: a safety measure against too powerful officers. The new commanders were Clitus, a trusted senior officer, and Hephaestion, who was still inexperienced.\n\nSogdia\n\nThe years 329, 328 and 327 saw fighting in Bactria and Sogdia, satrapies in the northeast of the Achaemenid Empire. Since most of the fighting was done on horseback, we would expect the commander of the Companion cavalry to be prominent in our sources, but Hephaestion is conspicuously absent. The reason is that the unit of Hephaestion and Clitus was too large for the guerilla warfare in Sogdia. It was divided into smaller units, and Hephaestion commanded only one of them. (It should be noted that Alexander killed Clitus, which would have made Hephaestion the senior commander of the Companions, an assignment that was probably still above his powers.)\n\nSo, Alexander was skeptical about Hephaestion's capacities as commander, but this did not mean that his friend was out of favor. He is mentioned as the official who had to secure provisions during the winter, an important task. Moreover, Hephaestion acted as Alexander's best man when he married with the native princess Roxane (text). But Hephaestion rarely served as commander during a fight; when he commanded an army that was to see battle, he was always sharing the command with a more experienced officer (e.g., Clitus, Artabazus, Perdiccas)."}, {"url": "https://www.worldhistory.org/article/108/the-battle-of-gaugamela-331-bce/", "page_content": "After securing the eastern Mediterranean seaboard and Egypt, Alexander the Great pushed east into Mesopotamia with the intention of bringing Darius to battle. After crossing the Euphrates River unopposed, he marched his army eastward along the foothills of the Armenian mountains before crossing the Tigris River. Once across the Tigris, Macedonian mounted scouts reported seeing Persian cavalry in the distance. Taking no chances, Alexander drew his army up in battle order, and, whilst the bulk of his troops cautiously advanced, he personally led a contingent of horsemen and light infantry against these Persians, scattering them and taking prisoners. He deduced from his captives that Darius was awaiting him at Gaugamela, a small village beside the river Bumodus.\n\nGreek Phalanx CA (Copyright)\n\nAlexander sets up Camp\n\nAlexander halted his army and built a fortified encampment. The gap between the two armies was now about seven miles, although neither side was visible to the other because a low range of hills ran between them. Leaving his baggage, camp followers, and prisoners under guard, Alexander left his encampment after nightfall, with his troops prepared for battle.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nAt about midnight, the Macedonian army crested the hills, taking in the thousands of twinkling Persian campfires below. Whilst the men halted and rested, Alexander took some of his Companions and light infantry down to reconnoitre the plain. His generals urged him to make a night attack, but Alexander refused - a good thing, because the Persians were expecting such a move and their entire army was under arms, the men already in their battle formations.\n\nAlexander had learnt much from his captured Persians. The plain that Darius had chosen to fight his battle upon had been further levelled, to enable his horsemen and chariots to manouevre effectively, and traps had been lain. Alexander knew of these traps, and, although unclear when, they were rendered harmless.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nBattle Lines\n\nThe battle itself began about mid-morning. The scene that confronted Alexander's army must have been awe-inspiring. The Persian line stretched across the plain, far outflanking the Macedonians. The Persian left flank was composed of cavalry - Bactrians, Scythians, and Arachotians, some of the finest mounted warriors in the Empire. Screening this force was more cavalry and 100 scythed chariots. In the centre, where Darius himself was stationed, was a vast horde of Persian infantry, and Darius' 2,000 - 10,000 mercenary Greeks. These men were the finest foot-soldiers in the Achaemenid host, and Darius was relying on them to halt the advance of the dreaded Macedonian phalanx. A further 50 scythed chariots and 15 elephants screened the centre.\n\nThe Persian right was held mostly by cavalry - Syrians, Mesopotamians, and warriors from the Persian Gulf. Although the figure of a million infantry and 40,000 cavalry ( including 200 scythed chariots and 15 elephants) is almost certainly exaggerated, Alexander's army, with 40,000 infantry and 7,000 cavalry, was nevertheless heavily outnumbered. Modern estimates put the size of Darius force at anywhere between 90,000 to 250,000 men.\n\nLove History?

The infantry, the pezhetairoi or phalangites, fought in a densely packed phalanx formation. Their chief weapon, the sarissa, was a pike of up to twelve cubits (18 ft) in length. In terms of length alone it conferred an enormous advantage to the Macedonian infantry, because they could start the slaughter whilst the enemy were still attempting to bring their own weapons to bear. In addition, footsoldiers were equipped with a sword, either a traditional Greek xiphos or the curved kopis.Those phalangites who fought in the front ranks of the phalanx were well armoured with cuirasses, helmets, and greaves, and all soldiers carried a two-foot wide circular shield.\n\nPersian infantry, by contrast, wore little to no armour, and most carried wicker shields that offered no defence against the brutal power of sarissae. Most were levies with little military training, and although the Persian host was vast, it lacked much in the manner of cohesion and discipline. Foremost in their minds would also most likely have been the knowledge that they were facing a general who had bested their king at the battle of Issus, and the fact that Darius had fled at Issus. This knowledge would also have influenced Alexander's men.\n\nThe chief advantages enjoyed by the Persians were their cavalry & the prepared battlefield. Conversely, the smooth plain was also ideal for the deployment of the Macedonian phalanx.\n\nThe chief advantages enjoyed by the Persians were their cavalry and the prepared battlefield. Conversely, the smooth plain was also ideal for the deployment of the Macedonian phalanx - the slightest dip or obstruction could ruin the cohesion of an advancing phalanx, and the bristling hedge of glittering pikes would dissuade any horse.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nAlexander stationed himself on the Macedonian right, with the bulk of his Companion and mercenary cavalry, and large numbers of psiloi (light infantry). Companion cavalry carried the xyston - a long, double-headed lance that was wielded two-handed. If the shaft snapped, as it often did, the warrior could reverse it and thrust with the other end. Companions wore breastplates and helmets and wielded a kopis (chopper) in the brutal scrummage of close-in combat.\n\nThe Macedonian infantry held the centre, with the entire line arrayed in echelon, slanting away diagonally backward to the left flank. On the left, General Parmenio commanded more infantry and the Thessalian cavalry (sometimes said to be the best cavalry in Alexander's army), and to him fell a tough task: to contain the main Persian attack whilst Alexander and his Companions dealt the death blow to Darius' army.\n\nAware that the phalanx would be vulnerable whilst he and his cavalry were engaged, Alexander stationed another phalanx behind the main battle line, comprised mostly of Greek mercenaries. This rear phalanx would face about in the event of an encirclement, a highly likely event given Darius' vast numbers.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nOpening Moves\n\nInitially, Alexander led his cavalry out to the right. Darius ordered his left-wing Bactrian and Scythian cavalry, under the command of his cousin Bessus, to keep pace with Alexander's outflanking movement. Furthermore, as the Macedonian line advanced, they were subjected to 'phalanx drift' - a phenomenon that occured as each man huddled instinctively behind his right-hand partners shield, resulting in a gradual crabbing drift to the right. Aware that the Macedonian line might thus move out of his prepared ground, Darius ordered his left flank to envelop Alexander's mercenary cavalry.\n\nAlexander then launched a determined assault on the centre of the enveloping Persian left wing, which was counterattacked by Scythian and Bactrian horsemen. Although the initial envelopment was thrown back, fresh reserves of Bactrian cavalry rallied the fleeing left wing and a savage cavalry battle erupted in which many on both sides lost their lives. Alexander's cavalry were fighting against some of the finest horsemen in the ancient world - many Scythians, or Saka, were particularly well armoured in the cataphract fashion. But Alexander persisted in his assault, and the Persian left finally began to waver.\n\n. Map of the Battle of Gaugamela - Alexander's Attack US Military Academy (Public Domain)\n\nWitnessing the failure of his cavalry to contain Alexander's outflanking manouevre, Darius committed his chariots and elephants. They ran into a thick screen of Macedonian light infantry, who grabbed the chariot reins and killed horses and drivers. Other chariots and elephants made it through the psiloi and attempted to attack the phalanx - the phalangites opened their ranks, allowing the chariots to drive through and be dealt with by Hypaspists and horse-grooms at the rear. The pezhetairoi also hammered the shafts of their sarrissae against their shields, causing a frightful din which panicked the chariot horse teams. The chariot assault had been a failure, although how much of a failure is open to debate: Diodorus states that they managed to inflict gruesome casualties before being neutralised.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nMid-Battle Maneuvres\n\nDarius now committed reserve Persian cavalry to contain Alexander's right, thus opening up a gap in his centre. Leaving behind his commander Aretas and some cavalry to deal with the Persian horsemen that still attempted to envelop the Macedonian right flank, Alexander wheeled his squadrons left, a complete about-turn that highlights the Macedonian's discipline and training. The manouevre would have been further complicated by the thick pall of choking dust and general mayhem that now blanketed the battlefield.\n\nForming his cavalry into a gigantic wedge, with himself and the Companions at the tip, Alexander met with the right-wing infantry elements of his centre and led a ferocious charge into the gap in the Persian lines, making for Darius himself. The phalanx, along with Thracian mercenaries and light infantry, followed, and the sheer momentum of their assault carried them deep into the Persian lines. Darius decided not to hang around: He fled, and the fight went out of those Persians who witnessed his flight. Thousands of Persian infantry began to rout from the field. On the left, Bessus finally gave way before the cavalry of Admetus.\n\nAlexander the Great in Combat Warner Brothers (Copyright, fair use)\n\nMeanwhile, on the Macedonian left, Parmenion was in trouble. The right-wing elements of the line had followed Alexander into the Persian centre, but their comrades had been forced to go to the assistance of the left flank. This created a gap in the Macedonian battle line, and Persian and Indian cavalry swarmed through this gap. Some swung around to attack the Macedonian left from the rear, but most bypassed the rear phalanx and made for the Macedonian camp, several miles away. This was a serious tactical error: Had they all swung about to attack the Macedonian left, they may well have succeeded in destroying a large part of Alexander's army.\n\nAs it was, the Macedonian camp guards were slaughtered and the prisoners freed, and these now joined the battle. The Macedonian rear phalanx ran back to save the camp, an impressive feat given that battle had already been raging for perhaps several hours and they made the run in full armour and carrying their weapons.\n\nMazaeus, the commander of the Persian left, pressed his advantage. He was unaware that Darius had fled the field and it is likely that the Persian right believed they were winning the battle. Parmenion was virtually surrounded and despatched a messenger to find Alexander and request assistance. Miraculously, this messenger succeeded in his task, and Alexander abandoned his pursuit of the fleeing Persian centre and galloped back to help Parmenion. On the way, he and his Companions ran head-on into thousands of withdrawing Persian and Indian cavalry - many of whom were returning after plundering his baggage - and the Companions were forced to hack a path through them to reach the Macedonian left.\n\nWith Alexander's arrival, Mazaeus realised that the Persian army was routing and began to withdraw, pursued relentlessly by Parmenion's Thessalian horse. Alexander resumed his pursuit of Darius with 500 cavalry, chasing and slaughtering fleeing Persians until dusk, before halting his exhausted men so they could rest and water their horses at the river Lycus. At midnight, they moved on toward Arbela, where they later found Darius' chariot, weapons, and treasure. Parmenion occupied the Persian camp, capturing their baggage train of camels and their elephants (curiously little is mentioned of the elephants role in the battle).\n\nVictory\n\nIn all, Arrian states that over 300,000 Persians were killed and more captured, with only 100 Macedonian dead. These figures are almost certainly grossly inflated. A more conservative estimate is 40,000 Persian dead, and Alexander himself claimed that his army suffered about 500 killed and 5,000 wounded. With widely fluctuating casualty lists, it is virtually impossible to determine how many lost their lives or limbs at Gaugamela.\n\nIt is unknown whether it was Alexander's deliberate intention to provoke Darius into removing men from his centre to counter the Macedonian outflanking movement, thereby creating a fatal gap. But his actions would suggest it, and Alexander was quick to seize the opportunity when it occurred.\n\nAlthough Darius still lived, his authority was a tenuous shadow of former times, and he would eventually be murdered by his cousin Bessus. With his defeat, and after resting his troops for a month at Arbela, the way was now open for Alexander to march on the heartland of Achaemenid Persia.\n\nThe battle was portrayed in the 2004 movie Alexander, although the depiction of the phalanx opening its ranks and creating 'boxes' in which to trap Darius' chariots was invented by Captain Dale Dye, military trainer for the cast, and the scene where Cleitus the Black saves Alexander's life actually took place at the Battle of the River Granicus."}, {"url": "https://the-past.com/feature/the-battle-of-gaugamela-1-october-331-bc/", "page_content": "We can date the fall of the Persian Empire to a single day of battle on 1 October 331 BC.\n\nIt had once been the greatest empire the world had ever seen, stretching from Thrace (modern Bulgaria) in the west to the Indus Valley (in modern Pakistan) in the east, from the Caucasus Mountains in the north to the Nubian Desert in the south.\n\nIt had existed for the best part of two centuries, a strapping together of hundreds of ethnic, religious, and linguistic groups, perhaps 50 million people, under the supreme autocratic rule of a \u2018Great King\u2019, a \u2018King of Kings\u2019 \u2013 the Achaemenid Persian Emperor.\n\nThe famous Alexander Mosaic from the House of the Faun in Pompeii. It depicts the encounter between Alexander (on the left) and Darius (on the right) on the battlefield of either Issus or Gaugamela. Like virtually all our source material for Alexander, it is mythologising propaganda that offers no real clues as to what actually happened. Image: WIPL.\n\nIn three short years, Alexander had overrun the entire western part of that empire \u2013 Anatolia (modern Turkey), the Levant (modern Lebanon, Syria, Israel, and Jordan), and Egypt. Now the struggle was to decide whether the heartland of the empire \u2013 Mesopotamia and Persia (modern Iraq and Iran) \u2013 would also be overrun and the rule of the Achaemenid dynasty terminated.\n\nNothing less than this was at stake at Gaugamela (or Arbela, as it is sometimes known). Though Alexander would live and fight for another eight years \u2013 much of it to be spent in gruelling counter-insurgency operations to secure his conquests \u2013 the stakes would never again be so high. Gaugamela was Alexander\u2019s greatest battle \u2013 the most geopolitically decisive and, as it happens, also the most tactically brilliant.\n\nLittle wonder, then, that it ranks in everyone\u2019s top twenty. It features in Edward Creasy\u2019s The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World of 1851, again in J F C Fuller\u2019s The Decisive Battles of the Western World in 1954, and in countless more-recent popular studies.\n\nThe unknowns\n\nAnd yet we know so very little about what actually happened that day. Robin Lane Fox \u2013 whose 1973 biography of Alexander is still the best \u2013 is honest about the many problems of reconstruction. The ancient accounts are few and mainly derivative. The contemporary chroniclers were court historians imbued with the Homeric ethic of Alexander\u2019s retinue. But even if their intention had been to record a literal truth, how could they have known it?\n\nBattle is a chaotic collision of mass forces in which each man\u2019s compass quickly shrinks down to what is happening immediately around him; no single man\u2019s experience is exactly like any other\u2019s. Memory, anyway, is defective, especially of something as traumatic as battle, with its overworked senses and surging emotions. Added to that, however, was the dust.\n\nDarius, the Persian King of Kings, as depicted on the Alexander Mosaic a pejorative, orientalist caricature. Image: WIPL.\n\nGaugamela was fought on a level plain of sand and dust at a time of year when average temperatures were around 25\u00b0C and there had probably been no rain for several months. As soon as the armies began to move, and from then until the battle ended, with perhaps 150,000 men and 50,000 horses in motion, the action would have been shrouded in a vast dust cloud, reducing visibility in places to as little as a few yards.\n\nOne should view plans of the battle \u2013 including the plans we publish here \u2013 with a heavy dose of scepticism. We do not know for sure how the armies were deployed, how they manoeuvred, when and where each collision occurred, how exactly the outcome was determined. In the secondary literature, from Hellenistic times onwards, a great edifice of reconstruction has been raised, but it rests on little more than some flimsy sticks of contemporary anecdote and myth-making.\n\nIt is best, therefore, to discuss the battle in terms of broad tactical considerations. Details are likely to be wrong, and can never be certain.\n\nThe strategic challenge\n\nThough Alexander had faced and defeated Darius himself at Issus in 333 BC, he would have known that this was not the final battle. The Persian Great King had escaped the battlefield and could be assumed to have fled eastwards deep into his heartlands. To have followed him there immediately would have been exceptionally hazardous.\n\nFor one thing, Darius had vast reserves of military manpower to call on. Greek caricatures of an \u2018oriental despot\u2019 ruling over \u2018slaves\u2019 can be dismissed. Autocratic he may have been, but none of the Great King\u2019s soldiers were slaves, and few are likely to have been conscripts. Though raised by levies on the cities and subject peoples of the Empire, it is probable that most complements were filled by willing-enough volunteers. The cavalry, in particular, must have been first-class, for the Persians, the Medes, the Scythians, and the Bactrians were all Central Asian steppe nomads.\n\nAnother danger precluding immediate advance was the eternal military problem that the offensive loses momentum as it advances, while the defensive gets stronger. The Macedonian leader\u2019s line of communication (back to Greece) was already a thousand miles long. He had given himself no time to consolidate his vast conquests and secure his rear. Most of the Levant and Egypt was still against him. To have plunged straight into inner Asia in 331 BC would have been the height of folly.\n\nThus the two-year delay \u2013 to crush all resistance in the west, to reinforce his army, to make full logistic preparation for what was to come. It gave Darius time also, but the balance of advantage must have lain with Alexander. Even so, the odds, when the great confrontation came in what is now northern Iraq, appeared forbidding.\n\nTwo ways of war, the Western and the Eastern. The famous Chigi vase depicts a collision of two Greek hoplite phalanxes [ABOVE]. Glazed-tile reliefs from Susa show Persian Immortals, the imperial bodyguard, with bows and spears, and wearing relatively little armour [BELOW]. Shock action was at the centre of one military system, mobility and shooting at the centre of the other. Images: WIPL.\n\nThe tactical challenge\n\nDarius\u2019s army probably outnumbered Alexander\u2019s by at least two-to-one, quite possibly more, and the Persian advantage in cavalry may have been at least four-to-one.\n\nWe can probably assume that the figure given (in the Greek sources) for Alexander\u2019s strength is reasonably accurate at 40,000 infantry and 7,000 cavalry. Most of the figures given for the Persian numbers \u2013 they go as high as a million \u2013 are ludicrous and can be ignored. But 100,000 seems possible, with perhaps 30,000 cavalry, as well as 200 scythed chariots and a contingent of elephants.\n\nThe \u2018Eastern way of war\u2019 involved mobility and shooting, epitomised by the horse-archer. The \u2018Western way of war\u2019 was almost the precise reverse: the emphasis was on the shock action of heavy infantry. Darius\u2019s best chance lay in his potential ability to envelop the flanks of the smaller Macedonian army. He therefore offered battle on an open, level plain \u2013 one made more so by systematic clearance of any impediments to mounted movement prior to the battle.\n\nAlexander accepted the challenge. Here was the final, decisive, world-conquering battle he had been seeking. In any case, to have refused the test of battle would have violated the Homeric ethic by which he and his peers lived, leaving him dishonoured and diminished, his right to rule in question. Gaugamela was a challenge to fight that could not be refused.\n\nBut the odds were awesome. Here is how Robin Lane Fox describes them:\n\nThe enemy\u2019s numbers were reported to be immense\u2026 In the open plain, where no natural barriers protected his flanks, Alexander was bound to be encircled by the Great King\u2019s cavalry, who were drawn in thousands, not only from horse-breeding areas of the Empire, from Media, Armenia, and even from Cappadocia behind his lines, but also from the tribes of the upper satrapies, Indians, Afghans, and others, some of them mounted archers, all of them born to ride, none more so than the allied Scythian nomads from the steppes beyond the Oxus.\n\nAlexander\u2019s army\n\nThe Macedonian army was, in fact, a combination of three distinct military traditions. The phalanx of \u2018Foot Companions\u2019 fought in the conventional Greek manner: they were close-packed heavy infantry trained for shock action. But there were refinements.\n\nWhile Greek hoplites were usually a part-time militia of citizen soldiers, the Foot Companions were highly trained professional soldiers, drilled for speed and manoeuvre, and equipped with sarissa or pike, such that several ranks\u2019 blades projected from the front of the phalanx.\n\nMention should also be made of the Hypaspists, around 3,000 strong, who were armed like hoplites, with spear and shield, but seemingly with lighter armour, making them an elite of mobile shock infantry.\n\nThe open plains of northern Greece (Macedonia and Thessaly) were represented by the mounted Companions, the heavy shock cavalry that both Philip and Alexander employed as their masse de manoeuvre and instrument of rupture or Schwerpunkt.\n\nThe hill tribes of the wilder parts of the Macedonian Empire in the southern Balkans provided light infantry, like the Agrianian javelin-men, who, under Alexander, became a kind of elite special-forces unit.\n\nThe Macedonian army at Gaugamela was a modern combined-arms force of professional veteran soldiers, with the emphasis on complex manoeuvre and shock action \u2013 the attritional shock of the phalanx, the lightning shock of the cavalry, with the Hypaspists often providing the hinge between the two.\n\nThe dispositions of the armies, Gaugamela, 1 October 331 BC. The plan probably understates the numerical preponderance of the Persians, making Alexander\u2019s army seem relatively larger than it was. It also assumes the echeloning of the Macedonian line occurred only once the advance began. But the other essential elements of the tactical conception are clear: Alexander had his main weight on the right, both flanks were bent back to guard against envelopment, and a second reserve line stood ready to cover all contingencies. Image: Ian Bull.\n\nHow should it be employed to minimise Darius\u2019s advantage in numbers, mobility, and shooting-power, and to maximise its own advantage in hitting-power?\n\nAlexander\u2019s plan\n\nIt seems there were four distinct elements to Alexander\u2019s solution to the tactical problem posed by Gaugamela: an oblique approach; an echeloned formation; refused flanks; and strong reserves. This combination had the effect of turning the entire Macedonian army into a huge, mobile, flexible, hollow square.\n\nThe main strength was on the right. Here the bulk of the Companion cavalry was deployed. This, remember, was the key strike-force, its role to spearhead the break-in to the enemy line at the moment of decision, this to be determined by the leader himself, who would ride at the head of the cavalry wedge.\n\nLeft of the cavalry, in the centre of the Macedonian line and forming its anchor, were the great blocks of the pike phalanx, but echeloned back from right to left. This \u2018refusal\u2019 of the left-centre was designed to delay the action here until the stronger Macedonian right had broken through.\n\nBoth outer flanks were also \u2018refused\u2019 \u2013 that is, angled backwards \u2013 in anticipation that the numerically superior Persian cavalry would overlap them both and threaten either to roll up the Macedonian line or break into the rear and surround the entire army. In the case of the weaker left flank, this was, then, a double \u2018refusal\u2019, in that the Macedonian line was both echeloned back and, at the far end, bent back.\n\nThis was the deployment of the Macedonian elements of the army, but Alexander used his second-rate elements \u2013 Greek, barbarian, and other auxiliary units, perhaps as many as 20,000 in total \u2013 to form a second line behind the first. Their task was to plug gaps in the main line, to reinforce the flanks if threatened, to extend the flanks if necessary, or even to form a rear face, turning the entire army into square, in the event of complete envelopment.\n\nIn short, almost the whole of Alexander\u2019s plan was a defensive response to Persian numbers and mobility; he was prepared to fight a \u2018cauldron battle\u2019 if necessary. But the secure defensive can be the essential springboard for the successful offensive. So it was at Gaugamela.\n\nThis was the meaning of the oblique approach to the Persian line. The Macedonian advance involved a rightwards shuffle, reducing the risk of envelopment on the right flank while pushing forward the mounted strike-force and positioning it for an attack somewhere on the left-centre of the enemy line.\n\nThe crisis of the battle, Gaugamela, 1 October 331 BC. At this stage, the effect of Alexander\u2019s dispositions and orders become clear. His refused right flank and his doubly refused left flank have the effect of stretching the Persian line, thinning the centre, and opening gaps. His tactical strike-force, the Companion heavy cavalry, then leads the Schwerpunkt, with support from the pike phalanx and the Hypaspists. Image: Ian Bull.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nInformation about Alexander\u2019s deployment of his troops, and the intention implicit in it, is more reliable than information about the action itself \u2013 for all the reasons explained above. Some oft-repeated statements about the action are quite ludicrous. I will give one example.\n\nWe are invited to believe that Darius launched his scythed chariots in a frontal attack on the phalanx, and that the Macedonians opened their lines to create lanes through which the chariots passed, only to be dispatched by the reserve forces behind.\n\nChariots are even less capable of breaking solid infantry than cavalry. To have used them in this way would have been madness. Equally, the most-effective defence against such a chariot attack would have been to halt, close ranks, and present a hedge of projecting blades to the oncoming horses.\n\nWhat seems possible is that we have a garbled report of an abortive chariot attack in which many vehicles ended up passing around pike \u2018hedgehogs\u2019, much as Ney\u2019s cavalry flowed around Wellington\u2019s infantry squares at Waterloo. But we do not know, and the nonsensical accounts of this incident fossilised in the sources merely underline the exceptional difficulty we have, at this distance, in understanding what actually happened in the battle.\n\nWhat follows, however, is an attempt to identify the essentials. The Persians attacked on both flanks, mainly with cavalry, but supported by infantry. Their enemy\u2019s oblique advance and refused right flank forced them to swing wide in an attempt to find the end of the line and achieve an envelopment. This had the effect of stretching the Persian line.\n\nThe Persian attack on the opposite flank was harder still, for here, remember, there was a double refusal \u2013 an echeloned line and a bent-back end. This had the effect of stretching the Persian line to an even greater degree than on the opposite flank, thereby weakening the impetus of its attacks and making effective envelopment exceptionally difficult.\n\nThe crisis of the battle\n\nThe discipline and solidity of Alexander\u2019s heavy formations was critical: the Foot Companions, the Hypaspists, and the Greek hoplites were especially adept at dogged defensive fighting, their formations effectively impenetrable as long as morale held. This remained true even with limited breaches in the Macedonian line.\n\nThe fighting on the Macedonian left is reported to have become exceptionally desperate, and the sources also record one major breakthrough in the centre, by a large Persian cavalry force that ended up in the far rear looting Alexander\u2019s baggage-train.\n\nThis is not difficult to explain. An oblique advance by an army of 47,000 men must have been a challenge for even the most highly drilled soldiers, even without the need to respond to enemy attacks. Add in the dust, the chaos, the confusion, and it would have been astonishing if gaps had not opened in parts of the Macedonian line.\n\nTwo scenes from the Alexander Sarcophagus (on display in Istanbul\u2019s antiquities museum). Alexander appears in the guise of a Homeric hero, wearing the lion skin of Heracles, in the thick of the fighting. Images: WIPL.\n\nThe colourised reconstruction closer to the probable original appearance underlines the dichotomy between West and East that was fundamental to the Hellenic world-view.\n\nBut the character of Alexander\u2019s infantry \u2013 again, much like the British infantry at Waterloo \u2013 was such that it could endure for a time even with a ruptured line by fighting in defensive islands. For a time: but not indefinitely. Everything depended on the Schwerpunkt on the right.\n\nAt some point, Alexander judged the moment had come to launch the Companion cavalry against the left-centre of the Persian line. He may have detected a gap, caused by the stretching effect of his own angled formation. He may have sensed the drain of Persian strength away to the flanks. This may, indeed, have been the very core of his tactical conception.\n\nKnowing that Darius was bound to launch a fight for the flanks, he had so arranged things that this became a mechanism for leaching power from the enemy centre. His deliberate intention was perhaps to extend and prolong the fight on the flanks to the point where a potential breaking-point appeared in the middle of the enemy line, close to where the Great King himself held station.\n\nThe charge of the Companions pierced the Persian line and penetrated deeply, sending shock-waves left and right, and immediately endangering the Great King, who promptly fled. The Macedonian cavalry were followed by the Hypaspists and the Foot Companions, who now crashed into a faltering line. Panic spread through the Persian centre and much of it began to disintegrate.\n\nAssessment\n\nThe story \u2013 the Homeric version concocted by Alexander\u2019s courtiers \u2013 is that the Macedonian king would have run Darius down but for Philip\u2019s old general Parmenion on the left, who made a desperate appeal for help.\n\nThis is another transparent falsehood: Alexander\u2019s job was to complete the victory over the Persian army, and that required the Companion cavalry to continue the action until all sections of the enemy line had been broken and were in flight.\n\nOddly, the court panegyric has the effect of diminishing the achievement. Alexander may have worn the mask of Achilles and exercised what John Keegan called \u2018heroic leadership\u2019, but he was a master tactician.\n\n\u2018The whole art of war\u2019, wrote Napoleon, \u2018consists in a well-reasoned and circumspect defensive followed by a rapid and audacious attack.\u2019 Moreover, as Clausewitz, who theorised the generalship of Napoleon, explained, a basic principle of strategy is \u2018to concentrate force at the point where the decisive blows are to be struck, for success at this point will compensate for all defeats at secondary points\u2019.\n\nGaugamela was a practical application of such ideas, and more: a defensive designed to draw and fix the enemy\u2019s forces, so as to weaken him at the point already selected for the decisive blow. It stands with just a handful of other great battles as an enduring tactical masterpiece.\n\nFurther reading\n\nRobin Lane Fox (1973) Alexander the Great (Allen Lane).\n\nJohn Keegan (1988) The Mask of Command (Penguin)."}, {"url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/5D6E0E5DF376C5DAEA1B37F21429C032/S0075426900084755a.pdf/alexanders_macedonian_cavalry.pdf", "page_content": "Sir William Tarn devoted some of the best pages in his Alexander the Great to Alexander's Macedonian troops. He has made many improvements on the account given by H. Berve. Yet doubts may be voiced or amendments suggested.\n\nI. Prodromoi\n\nIt is known that the Companion cavalry at Gaugamela were formed in eight squadrons or ilai (Arr. iii 11.8), of which one was the royal squadron par excellence or the \u2018agema of the Companions\u2019. It is unlikely that the number of ilai had been reduced since 334, as reinforcements had probably more than compensated for losses (section V). Plutarch, however, says in his life of Alexander (16.2) that at the Granicus Alexander plunged into the stream with 13 ilai. His account of the battle closely resembles Arrian's, and he cites Aristobulus on the number of Macedonian casualties. The statement quoted probably then corresponds to Arrian's (i 14.6) that Alexander ordered the prodromoi and Paeonians under Amyntas, son of Arrhabaeus, into the river, together with one foot regiment which was preceded by Socrates' cavalry squadron, and that he himself followed with the whole right wing. Plutarch's 13 squadrons may thus be identified with the 8 squadrons of the Companions plus 5 of prodromoi and Paeonians. The Paeonians themselves can be classified, perhaps by error, as prodromoi (Arr. iii 8.1) or distinguished from them (i 14.1 and 6; ii 9.2; iii 12.3); they could have formed only a single squadron, distinct from 4 squadrons of prodromoi under command of the same Amyntas (Arr. i 12.7) or sarissophoroi (iv 4.6) of whom we hear elsewhere."}, {"url": "https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/classics/warwickclassicsnetwork/stoa/anchist/gcse/alexander/teachersguide", "page_content": "Introduction and the developments of the Macedonia state and army under Philip (Suggested timing: 1 \u00bd\u20132 hours) \u00b7 Background to the rise of Macedon and familiarity with the geography of the areas covered in the depth study, most of which should be fairly familiar from the Persian period study. \u00b7 Introduction to key (textual) ancient source authors: Arrian, Plutarch and Diodorus Siculus. \u00b7 Alexander\u2019s success built on the firm foundations laid down by Philip. Philip trained and organised a new army, at the same time ensuring the men swore loyalty to him rather than Macedonia. Philip made the traditional formation deeper so that his phalanx could exert greater force against an enemy. This required him to develop a longer spear; his men were from then on supplied with a five metre long lance known as a sarissa. \u00b7 Philip abolished the monarchies of some of the northern tribal states and instead these former ruling elites joined the traditional Macedonian noble families as part of the Companions of the King. The sons of the tribal leaders were invited to Philip\u2019s court to form a class of royal pages. They also acted as hostages ensuring the loyalty of their fathers. \u00b7 Philip partook in a succession of politically strategic marriages. The marriages aimed to secure his borders by establishing better relations with Macedonia\u2019s neighbours. For example, he married Olympias, the daughter of the king of the Epirus. \u00b7 Philip\u2019s developments in the Macedonia army \u00b7 The weapons and armour of the Macedonia army \u00b7 Philip\u2019s methods for securing the Macedonia state\n\nAlexander\u2019s birth and youth, and important events up to 336 BC (Suggested timing: 2 \u00bd\u20133 hours) \u00b7 Plutarch details episodes and stories that were connected to Alexander\u2019s birth and youth. As Alexander became a heroic figure, legends quickly took hold of the historical record. o Plutarch outlines the stories told about Alexander\u2019s conception and birth. The stories are a mix of contextualised folktale and propaganda, designed to imply the pre-determined nature of Alexander\u2019s ascent to greatness. o The evidence concerning Alexander\u2019s youth was selected to portray him as a boy marked out for success as well as to characterise him more generally. \u00b7 In 338 Philip moved into central Greece looking to fight a decisive battle against Thebes and Athens. He was seeking to emerge as the most powerful man in Greece. The battle took place at Chaeronea. \u00b7 Philip married a Macedonian called Cleopatra \u2013 a niece of Attalus. At the wedding Alexander fell out with his father in an argument incited by Attalus. Alexander and Olympias left Macedonia, although Philip recalled Alexander the following year. \u00b7 In 337 Philip established a council of Greek states known as the League of Corinth. Philip was elected its leader or hegemon. As hegemon, Philip was handed the responsibility of invading Persia in the name of Greece. In reality, he handed this responsibility to himself as it is far from clear that the Greek city-states shared his enthusiasm for avenging Xerxes\u2019 invasion. \u00b7 In spring 336 Parmenio and Attalus were sent to Asia in charge of an advance party. Plutarch, The Life of Alexander 2\u20133 and 6\u20139 \u00b7 The nature of the evidence on Alexander\u2019s birth and youth \u00b7 Alexander\u2019s character as revealed at key moments prior to becoming king \u00b7 Greeks views of Philip and Macedonia \u00b7 Philip\u2019s policy towards the Greek city-states \u00b7 The significance of Philip marrying Cleopatra \u00b7 The reason for Philip and Alexander\u2019s falling out in 338/337 \u00b7 Alexander\u2019s relationship with Philip \u00b7 The character and influence of Olympias\n\nThe murder of Philip October 336 BC (Suggested timing: 1 \u00bd\u20132 hours) \u00b7 Cleopatra Eurydice may have given birth to a son to compliment the daughter she had already had with Philip. Alexander and Olympias\u2019 position was possibly now in even greater danger. \u00b7 Philip and Olympias\u2019 daughter (who was also called Cleopatra) married Alexander of Epirus. Alexander of Epirus was both Olympias\u2019 brother and King of Epirus. This union would have weakened Olympias\u2019 position further in that she was no longer Philip\u2019s main link with the neighbouring state of Epirus. \u00b7 The wedding celebrations were attended by a significant number of Greeks as well as Macedonians. Olympias was not present. \u00b7 The day after the wedding ceremony Philip was murdered. The situation of the assassin Pausanias does not seem enough of a motive on its own. He was angry with Philip for not punishing Attalus, yet he could, as a bodyguard, have more easily murdered Philip elsewhere. Olympias (and Alexander) could have influenced Pausanias, although Alexander later claimed the Persians had bribed the murderer. Diodorus, Library of History 16.91\u201394 \u00b7 The reasons for Philip to marry his daughter to her uncle \u00b7 The reasons for Philip\u2019s murder\n\nAlexander consolidating his position and the initial reasons for the expedition against Persia (Suggested timing: 1 hour) \u00b7 On the murder of his father, Alexander launched a purge of possible rivals for the throne. Attalus was executed on Alexander\u2019s instructions and with Parmenio\u2019s help. \u00b7 Alexander travelled to Corinth where, like his father, he was appointed hegemon of Greece. The position carried the authority to wage war on Persia on behalf of the League of Corinth. \u00b7 Alexander then turned his attention towards Greece where Thebes and Athens were in rebellion. Theban exiles had returned to their city to foment rebellion. Alexander captured Thebes and massacred many of its inhabitants. \u00b7 Alexander invaded Persia for a host of interconnected reasons that should be analysed and attributed due weight. \u00b7 Darius III, the new king of Persia, was in a weak position. He was not from the principal royal line and had gained power after a series of coups. \u00b7 The ways Alexander secured power \u00b7 The reasons for Alexander\u2019s Persian expedition\n\nAlexander in Asia-Minor (Suggested timing: 4\u20134 \u00bd hours) \u00b7 Antipaer was left in charge of Greece by Alexander. \u00b7 In 334 Alexander crossed the Hellespont with his army and made a detour to Troy. Alexander was said to have laid a wreath on the tomb of Achilles and taken sacred weapons dating from the time of the Trojan War. Arrian, The Campaigns of Alexander 1.11\u201312 \u00b7 The significance of Alexander\u2019s visit to Troy \u00b7 Alexander\u2019s relationship with his companions (Hephaestion)\n\nBattle at the River Granicus (May 334 BC) \u00b7 An army led by the Persian satraps of Asia-Minor and Memnon was waiting for Alexander at the River Granicus. Alexander fought bravely during the battle, leading a Companion Cavalry charge at Mithridates (Darius\u2019 son-in-law). At this point Cleitus saved his life. Alexander showed particular contempt for the Greek mercenaries opposing him: his army was instructed to show them no mercy and those who survived were classed as traitors and enslaved to the mines of Macedon. Alexander sent Persian armour back to Athens to show the Athenians what he had achieved. Arrian, The Campaigns of Alexander 1.13\u201316 \u00b7 The use of cavalry, the phalanx and other troops \u00b7 The nature and aims of Arrian \u00b7 The nature of the evidence regarding the Battle of Granicus\n\n\u00b7 After the Battle at the River Granicus, the city of Sardis surrendered to Alexander. Alexander also takes control of Ephesus and Miletus. \u00b7 Unable to match the Persians at sea, Alexander\u2019s fleet was becoming a financial liability: it was disbanded. \u00b7 Alexander moved down the coast and besieged Halicarnassus. \u00b7 Alexander sent the younger men in his army home for the winter to be with their wives. He and Parmenio split the rest of the army to better deal with other pockets of resistance.\n\nAlexander at Gordium \u00b7 Alexander\u2019s forces reconvened at Gordium in the spring of 333. The cutting of the Gordian knot was symbolic: Alexander was signalling his greater vision for the expedition. Cutting the knot was also important for propaganda reasons: it encouraged the soldiers by making them believe they were destined to take over Asia as the prophecy foretold. Arrian, The Campaigns of Alexander 2.3 \u00b7 What does Arrian\u2019s account of the legend of the Gordium knot reveal about the nature of ancient historical writing? \u00b7 Alexander\u2019s character\n\nThe Battle of Issus (November 333 BC) \u00b7 At the Battle of Issus Alexander faced a much larger Persian army across a river. The steep banks of the River Issus provided a dangerous obstacle for Alexander\u2019s phalanx. However, Alexander led a strong cavalry charge that forced Darius to flee. Darius got away but Alexander captured his family. Alexander sarcophagus Mosaic from the House of the Faun in Pompeii \u00b7 The tactics used in the main battles\n\nAlexander in Phoenicia and Egypt (Suggested timing: 1 \u00bd\u20132 hours) \u00b7 Parmenio was sent with a detachment to Damascus where he took possession of vast amounts of Darius\u2019 wealth. \u00b7 Darius, having suffered a significant defeat, offered to make peace as Alexander marched down the Phoenician coast. Alexander replied demanding to be recognised as King of Asia. \u00b7 Alexander was determined that all cities should submit to him. The Phoenician cities had to be forced to submit as the Persians could not be allowed to possess bases for their fleet and thus continue controlling the seas and trade routes. Alexander had disbanded his fleet while at Halicarnassus (for financial reasons) and so an active Persian fleet may have disrupted his plans.\n\nSiege of Tyre (January\u2013July 332 BC) \u00b7 Chief among the Phoenician cities was Tyre. Situated on an island half a mile out to sea, the Babylonians, among others, had previously tried and failed to take the city. Alexander convinced his men that his ancestor Heracles had visited him in a dream and demanded that he worship in the Temple of Heracles in Tyre. More prosaically, he was determined to prevent the Persians from using the Phoenician ports to shift the war over to Greece where their allies the Spartans were fomenting unrest. Arrian, The Campaigns of Alexander 2.24 \u00b7 the main events of the siege of Tyre \u00b7 Alexander\u2019s character and leadership as revealed by his actions during the final capture of Tyre\n\n\u00b7 The Tyrians taunted the Macedonians from their walls saying Alexander would never capture the city. Attempts at negotiation failed when the Tyrians threw some of Alexander\u2019s men from the city wall. Alexander built a mole across the sea in order to use his siege engines against the city\u2019s walls. The Tyrians shot arrows at his men from both their walls and their triremes. The Tyrians then burnt his mole using a fire ship. Increasingly determined, Alexander built a wider mole. Alexander had forecast that, due to his recent victory at Issus, other Phoenician cities would switch allegiance. This hope was realised when the newly conquered Sidon willingly sent ships to pin the Tyrians in their harbours. The Tyrians could no longer sally out to attack the new mole and neither could they import supplies into the city. Yet even then Tyre\u2019s landside walls proved too strong. Alexander used his new fleet to sail round to a weaker part of the wall. He put his siege engines on rafts anchored to the seabed. In desperation the Tyrians sent divers to cut the anchor ropes and threw hot sand on Alexander\u2019s men from their walls. Alexander replaced the anchor ropes with metal chains. After the failure of a desperate Tyrian naval attack, Alexander\u2019s siege engines smashed a gap in the wall and a detachment of shield-bearers was ordered to exploit it. After their leader was killed, Alexander and his Companions took over the attack. 8,000 Tyrians were massacred.\n\nAlexander in Egypt \u00b7 Instead of heading into the Persian heartland, Alexander moved into Egypt. While his men were founding Alexandria, Alexander travelled hundreds of miles into the desert to the oracle that was located at the oasis that is now modern-day Siwa. \u00b7 The importance of foundation cities \u00b7 Alexander\u2019s beliefs\n\nThe Battle of Gaugamela (Suggested timing: 2 \u00bd\u20133 hours) Battle of Gaugamela (October 331 BC) \u00b7 Darius had amassed a large army; Alexander realised his smaller army could easily be outflanked and attacked on its weak sides and rear. Therefore Alexander stationed infantry in the midst of his cavalry to strengthen his flanks. The infantry would surprise Darius\u2019 cavalry. The soldiers on each side of the phalanx could also move back like flaps to prevent being outflanked. Alexander\u2019s plan was to move right so that Darius would initiate action to prevent the battle moving off the ground he had prepared for his chariots. It was hoped that Darius would advance his cavalry on the left in an attempt to outflank Alexander\u2019s right and stop the Macedonians moving further to the right. Alexander hoped that this would create a gap in the Persian line through which he could lead a Companion Cavalry charge at Darius. The Persians had too many men to attempt anything else \u2013 Alexander therefore had to win the battle in a decisive move against Darius. The plan generally worked as envisaged and Darius was forced to flee the battle. The ancient sources say Parmenio was struggling to hold the left-flank and had to ask for assistance. The implication is that this request prevented Alexander from capturing Darius and gaining a full victory. Plutarch, The Life of Alexander 31\u201333 Arrian, The Campaigns of Alexander 3.9\u201315 Babylonian Astronomical Diary tablet mentioning Gaugamela \u00b7 Reasons for Alexander\u2019s victory \u00b7 The use of cavalry, the phalanx and other troops \u00b7 What does Plutarch\u2019s account of the battle reveal about his priorities as a writer? \u00b7 The nature of the evidence for the Battle of Gaugamela\n\n\u00b7 After the battle Alexander\u2019s army moved to Babylon where the soldiers were allowed to rest and recuperate; many Babylonians welcomed Alexander as the Egyptians had done. \u00b7 Antipater, who had been left in charge of Macedon, beat King Agis of Sparta in a battle at Megalopolis. Agis had sought to destroy Macedon\u2019s pre-eminent position in Greece and had been liaising with the Persians.\n\nThe Battle of the Persian Gates and Alexander\u2019s visit to Persepolis (Suggested timing: 1 \u00bd \u20132 hours) Battle of the Persian Gates (January 330 BC) \u00b7 Alexander moved on to the Persian capital at Persepolis after fighting his way through the mountain pass known as the Persian Gates. Meanwhile Parmenio was charged with leading the other half of the army on a more circuitous, less mountainous, route to Persepolis. Arrian, The Campaigns of Alexander 3.18 \u00b7 the events of the Persian Gates \u00b7 Alexander\u2019s character as revealed by the events at Persepolis \u00b7 The reasons for the burning of the Palace at Persepolis \u00b7 The nature of the sources regarding Alexander\u2019s visit to Persepolis\n\nAlexander in Persepolis \u00b7 Arrian says that Alexander set fire to the palace to avenge Xerxes\u2019 destruction of Athens 150 years earlier however Plutarch gives another story where Thais, Ptolemy\u2019s mistress, encourages Alexander to burn down the palace. \u00b7 At this juncture Alexander changed the terms of service of his Greek soldiers in a move that perhaps signalled that he felt the revenge mission had finally been completed. Arrian, The Campaigns of Alexander 3.18.10\u20133.18.12 Plutarch, The Life of Alexander 38\n\nThe pursuits of Darius and Bessus (Suggested timing: 1 \u00bd\u20132 hour) \u00b7 Alexander marched to Ecbatana and left Parmenio there with a lot of the Persian treasure. \u00b7 Alexander chased Darius down. Darius was eventually betrayed by his own men and held captive. In July 330 BC he was killed when Alexander\u2019s troops attacked the camp where Darius was being held. Alexander gave Darius a state funeral at Persepolis. \u00b7 Bessus proclaimed himself Great King \u2013 Artaxerxes V. Alexander would not stand for this and needed to avenge the death of Darius. Many of Alexander\u2019s men, no doubt, thought that the death of Darius would mean the end of the fighting and a return to Macedonia. \u00b7 The impact of Darius\u2019 death on the nature of Alexander\u2019s campaign \u00b7 Alexander\u2019s character\n\nAlexander\u2019s adoption of Persian customs \u00b7 Immediately after the death of Darius, Alexander started to adopt some aspects of Persian dress. \u00b7 The first complaints about Alexander\u2019s behaviour were voiced soon after. Silver tetradrachm minted by Ptolemy I Silver tetradrachm minted by Lysimachus \u00b7 Reasons for Alexander\u2019s adoption of Persian customs\n\nThe conspiracy of/against Philotas (October 330 BC) \u00b7 Philotas boasted to his mistress that Alexander\u2019s victories were really due to him and his father Parmenio. \u00b7 Some pages asked Philotas, Parmenio\u2019s son, to arrange an audience with Alexander for them. Philotas twice turned down their request. As their information was important the pages therefore found another way of speaking to the King. It transpired that other pages were plotting against the King\u2019s life. The plotters were dealt with but Alexander was furious that he had not been warned earlier. There was a suspicion, if no actual proof, that Philotas may have been involved. Alexander executed Philotas, sealed the camp to prevent information leaking out, and then sent an urgent message to Ecbatana instructing that Parmenio be killed in case the old general led a rebellion in an act of revenge. \u00b7 Alexander split Philotas\u2019 sole command of the Companion Cavalry in two: between Cleitus and Hephaestion. \u00b7 Alexander\u2019s relationship with his companions and his army (Phitotas and Parmenio)\n\nPursuit of Bessus \u00b7 In the spring of 329, Alexander crossed the Hindu Kush into Bactria in pursuit of Bessus. The crossing was a feat of determination, stubbornness and organisation given that Alexander was leading such a large force. \u00b7 In the summer of 329, Bessus was captured and mutilated, the customary Persian punishment for those who committed treason.\n\nAlexander in Bactria and Sogdiana. The murder of Cleitus and the opposition of Callisthenes (Suggested timing: 2 \u00bd\u20133 hours) The death of Cleitus (328 BC) \u00b7 Alexander\u2019s enemies now employed guerrilla warfare tactics against him; his army was forced to split up to hunt out the different groups of fighters who attacked them. Not all the Macedonian leaders enjoyed success in the battles that followed and one night a singer began to mock those who had suffered defeat. Alexander encouraged the singer to continue despite Macedonian protests. Everybody was drunk and worn out after the fighting. An argument began in which Alexander stabbed Cleitus to death and then immediately regretted it. Plutarch, The Life of Alexander 50\u201351 Arrian, The Campaigns of Alexander 4.8\u20134.9.8 \u00b7 The reasons for Cleitus\u2019 argument with Alexander \u00b7 Alexander\u2019s character and his relationship with his men\n\n\u00b7 In the spring of 327 Alexander sent men with climbing experience to storm a stronghold known as the Sogdian Rock. The Sogdians were said to have claimed their position unassailable, which, if Arrian is to be believed, fired Alexander\u2019s determination to capture it even more.\n\n\u00b7 Alexander then married a noble girl called Roxane who had been taken prisoner on the Sogdian Rock. It was, despite Arrian\u2019s views to the contrary, most likely a politically inspired union in that her father, Oxyartes, was a leading tribal chief in Sogdiana.\n\nCallisthenes\u2019 opposition and removal in the Pages\u2019 Conspiracy \u00b7 Callisthenes argued with Alexander over the issue of whether Greeks and Macedonians should perform obeisance (proskynesis) before the King. It seems that Alexander was encouraged to organise a stage-managed event in which the ritual would be trialled; we don\u2019t hear of it being demanded again. It may have been in this context that the Greek Callisthenes spoke out powerfully against Alexander\u2019s growing preference for the custom. Callisthenes is portrayed as having put forward a powerful case suggesting that in freedom lays strength, and that some honours were only fit for gods and not men. The subtext of Callisthenes\u2019 argument was that previous kings had failed to benefit from receiving proskynesis: free peoples had defeated all of them. \u00b7 Callisthenes was soon dead. He was either executed or died in prison after being accused of involvement in another plot against Alexander \u2013 the so-called \u2018Pages\u2019 Conspiracy.\u2019 It is unlikely he was involved but the episode could possibly be interpreted as an example of Alexander\u2019s vindictiveness and paranoia. The plot to murder Alexander in his sleep had been triggered when he overreacted to the actions of a page. The plot failed and its existence was revealed the next day. The pages were tortured until all the conspirators were unmasked. Callisthenes was their teacher and Alexander, having already argued with the Greek historian, appeared keen to implicate him in the affair.

Alexander\u2019s vigorous assault on this high mountain stronghold was perhaps motivated by a story that even Heracles had failed to take it. Ptolemy, making use of local guides, was tasked with leading an advanced force to secure a position from which to attack the main Indian stronghold. Ptolemy completed this difficult mission and Alexander was able to lead the main army up the mountain to join him. After laying siege to the mountaintop, Alexander ordered a ravine to be bridged so that his war engines could be brought within range of the Indian defences. The rock was captured after an intense assault followed by the false promise of a peace treaty. Many of those who had resisted Alexander were either massacred or fell to their deaths attempting to escape. Arrian, The Campaigns of Alexander 4.28\u201330 Silver tetradrachm minted by Ptolemy I \u00b7 the methods Alexander used to capture the Aornus Rock\n\nThe campaign against Porus \u00b7 One Indian leader who offered significant resistance was Porus. Alexander admired how Porus had fought until all hope was lost and so the Indian was allowed to retain his kingdom \u2013 but only as a satrap \u2013 in return for his loyalty and help in subduing other pockets of resistance. \u00b7 Bucephalas died after the battle and in response Alexander founded a city in the name of his most trusted horse. Populated by a mix of local people and soldiers no longer fit for battle, the culture in each foundation was said to have been Greco-Macedonian in nature. Most of the foundations were garrison towns designed to leave a permanent military presence in areas where it was felt that rebellions might surface in the future. The inhabitants, often veterans and others loyal to Alexander, were meant to be a socialising force. \u00b7 Alexander\u2019s character \u00b7 The nature and role of Alexander\u2019s foundation cities \u00b7 the Indus Valley campaign and what it reveals about Alexander\u2019s abilities and character\n\nMutiny at the River Hyphasis (Summer 326 BC) \u00b7 The Macedonians received reports that they were still a long way from the Great Ocean and that they would have to fight armies with thousands of elephants to get there. This news, along, no doubt, with the rain, mud, snakes, insects and proliferation of illness within the camp, eventually resulted in a mutiny at the River Hyphasis. Alexander couldn\u2019t change the men\u2019s minds; to save face he declared the omens were bad and ordered the army turn back. \u00b7 the Indus Valley campaign and what it reveals about Alexander\u2019s aims, and relationships with his men\n\nThe difficulties encountered on the return to Babylon. The mass marriages at Susa (Suggested timing: 1 \u00bd\u20132 hours) The march through the Gedrosian Desert \u00b7 Alexander made the decision to march through the Gedrosian Desert, thousands of soldiers and camp followers died. Alexander\u2019s veterans survived because, led by Craterus, they took a different route avoiding the desert. Arrian, The Campaigns of Alexander 7.4.1\u20137.4.3 \u00b7 Why might Alexander have decided to march through the Gedrosian Desert? \u00b7 Alexander\u2019s relationship with his army and satraps\n\n\u00b7 Emerging from the desert, Alexander found his empire to be in a state of unrest; there had been rumours that he had died in the east. Alexander acted decisively, punishing the offending satraps to restore order. A further purge of satraps took place once Alexander reached Susa.\n\nThe mass marriages at Susa \u00b7 Alexander held a mass marriage ceremony for his Companions at Susa. Alexander married into two lines of the Persian royal clan. Arrian, The Campaigns of Alexander 7.4.4\u20137.4.7 \u00b7 The reasons behind the mass marriages at Susa\n\nThe mutiny at Opis \u00b7 At Opis Alexander faced another mutiny when he attempted to decommission his veteran soldiers who were no longer fit to serve. His soldiers, including those he was decommissioning, were angered that they were to be replaced by the Epigonoi \u2014 30,000 young Persians who had been trained and armed in the Macedonian manner. \u00b7 Alexander\u2019s relationship with his army\n\n\u00b7 His army newly reinforced by the Epigonoi, Alexander was now less reliant on his veterans than he had been at the Hyphasis. He executed thirteen men he considered to be the ringleaders of the mutiny and threatened to send all the Macedonian rebels in his army home without pay. The Macedonians pleaded with Alexander and he let them off while promising to view them all as his kinsmen. \u00b7 10,000 veterans, including those who had married their oriental partners were discharged and ordered back to Macedonia. Their offspring by the oriental women were required to be left behind.\n\n\u00b7 In Macedon, Olympias and Antipater were at loggerheads. When Alexander sent the 10,000 veterans back to Macedon, Antipater was sent a request to bring out fresh Macedonia troops, potentially as a way to prevent his dispute with Olympias from turning nasty.\n\nHephaestion and Alexander\u2019s deaths (Suggested timing: 2 \u00bd hours) Death of Hephaestion (324 BC) \u00b7 Alexander travelled to Ecbatana where Hephaestion died following a short illness. As Alexander\u2019s favourite, Hephaestion had become increasingly unpopular. Alexander was naturally very upset given the closeness of his relationship with Hephaestion. He sent messengers to Siwa to see whether Hephaestion should be worshipped as a god. The oracle refused his request and so Alexander had to content himself with declaring Hephaestion a hero to whom sacrifices should be directed. Arrian, The Campaigns of Alexander 7.14 \u00b7 The impact of Hephaestion\u2019s death on Alexander \u00b7 Alexander\u2019s character and his relationship with his men\n\nDeath of Alexander (323 BC) \u00b7 Alexander returned to Babylon but did not immediately enter the city because of troubling oracles. Alexander suspected the Chaldaeans had dreamt up the oracles to further their own interests, yet he remained wary and held off entering the city. \u00b7 Alexander spent the remainder of the spring planning an expedition against the Arabians. Despite this apparent burst of activity, the sources continue to paint Alexander as paranoid, overly superstitious and too harsh. \u00b7 After a period of illness, during which he continued to drink heavily, Alexander died. Whether he died from an accumulation of natural causes, or was the victim of a conspiracy, has long been a subject of debate. Prime candidates for conspiracy theorists are Antipater and his family.

De Santis\n\nCavalry was the decisive arm of the Macedonian army under Alexander. His tactics for its employment in battle were simple but effective. First Alexander would fix the enemy in place with light cavalry and the phalanx, and then launch the killing stroke with his cavalry at the critical moment. This hammer-and- anvil approach served Alexander well throughout his 11 years in Asia, and the successes of the Macedonian cavalry arm must place Alexander\u2019s horsemen with the finest fielded by any army.\n\n[text_ad]\n\nForemost among Alexander\u2019s cavalry units were the Companions. Recruited from among the nobly born young men of Macedonia, the Companions were the senior regiment in the army and fought on the right wing, the place of honor in the line of battle. They were armed with a spear and shield, and protected by a cuirass and an open Boeotian-style bronze helmet that offered all-around vision and hearing.\n\nThe Companions were 1,800 strong at the outset of Alexander\u2019s campaign against Persia, and organized into eight ilai, or squadrons. The senior ile, or Royal Squadron, was 300 men strong, and Alexander fought at the head of this formation at Gaugamela. The remaining seven were smaller, composed of about 215 men apiece, and each was drawn, on a territorial basis, from different areas of Macedonia, such as Amphipolis, Anthemus, Apollonia, and Bottiaea. The Companions fought in a wedge formation with the best troopers at the front. The wedge was favored for its ability to penetrate and exploit gaps in the opposing line more easily than the typical square formation in use in most Greek states. The Companions were Alexander\u2019s elite, his principal instrument of victory, and he used them to deliver the decisive, fatal blow to the Persian enemy.\n\nMacedonia\u2019s Elite Cavalry\n\nThe Thessalian cavalry were recruited from the best horse-breeding country in Greece, the plains of Thessaly, which was dominated by its nobility and their excellent cavalry. They were considered by many to be the finest horsemen in the army, but for reasons of national origin were junior to the Companions. Like the Companions, they numbered 1,800 at the start of the campaign against Persia, and were also organized in eight ilai. These squadrons were of unequal size, however, with the largest and best, in Arrian\u2019s opinion, being from Pharsalus. The Thessalians normally fought on the left wing of the battle line, and at Gaugamela were under the direct command of Parmenio, one of Alexander\u2019s senior generals. Their heroic action saved that day for the left wing, demonstrating that their reputation for excellence was well deserved.\n\nThe Thessalians were armed and armored like the Companions, and fought in a diamond-shaped formation, the rhombos. Unlike the usual square formations, the rhombos allowed the squadron to maneuver quickly because the leader was easier to see and follow. Further, the facing of the formation could be changed simply by turning the troopers\u2019 horses in the appropriate direction.\n\nThe prodromoi, or scouts, were four squadrons of Thracians of the Royal Army, and were used to reconnoiter ahead of the main body of the army. Alexander relied heavily upon the scouts for accurate intelligence about Darius\u2019s whereabouts, and they did not fail him. As scouts, the prodromoi were lightly equipped, and their armor was probably limited to a helmet. As light troops, they were often detached from the main army for actions where speed was required.\n\nOther Thracian cavalrymen fought as allies for Alexander. A squadron of Paeonians and perhaps two of Odrysians took service with Alexander, provided for by agreements with the client kings of those states. One encounter during the Gaugamela Campaign shows the dash and bravado reminiscent of a Napoleonic hussar. As Alexander\u2019s troops were crossing the Tigris River, a force of Persian cavalry arrived at a vulnerable moment for the Macedonians. Alexander immediately ordered the Paeonians, under the command of Ariston, to attack. Ariston gallantly engaged the Persian commander Satropates in single combat and slew him, to the cheers of the watching Macedonians on the riverbank, and the Persians were driven off.\n\nThe Greek allies of the League of Corinth also supplied Alexander with a number of cavalry. They were recruited from different cities in Greece but were grouped together in battle. Two squadrons of six hundred men each fought for Alexander at Gaugamela.\n\nMore important than the Greek allied cavalry were the mercenary light horsemen, recruited by the king to remedy his weakness in light cavalry. Two squadrons fought for Alexander at Gaugamela, with the formation under the command of Menidas in the vanguard of the entire army. It was Menidas\u2019s mercenary horse that performed the critical role of drawing off enough of Darius\u2019s own cavalry to allow Alexander his moment to strike.\n\nStriking a Deathblow to the Persian Empire\n\nThe performance of Alexander\u2019s cavalry left little to be desired. They fought bravely and well and were victorious. Their advantage over the Persians, whom they bested on numerous occasions, was not due to a lack of Persian skill or courage. Rather, the Macedonians were exceptionally well led, and their morale, as soldiers of the young and charismatic Alexander, was exceptionally high.\n\nAs with its infantry, so with its cavalry, the Persians were undone by overly large numbers and the polyglot composition of their cavalry force. Fewer troops under tighter control might have allowed Darius to avoid the fatal blunder at Gaugamela that occurred when the entire left wing was drawn off by Alexander\u2019s feint with his mercenary light cavalry. Alexander, at the head of his smaller but tightly disciplined Companions, was able to exploit this opening and deliver the killing blow to the Persian army, and indeed, to the Persian Empire."}, {"url": "https://alexander-the-great.org/people/hephaestion", "page_content": "People > Hephaestion\n\nHephaestion\n\nBackground\n\nSources\n\nPrimary Sources\n\nSecondary Sources\n\nHephaestionHephaestion Cropped.jpgHephaestion marble head, as of September 2015 housed in the Getty MuseumNickname(s)PatroclusBornc. 356 BCPella, MacedoniaDied324 BCBabylonAllegianceMacedoniaRankGeneral, 2nd in command.UnitSomatophylakesCommands heldCompanion cavalryBattles/warsSiege of Pelium, Battle of Thebes, Battle of the Granicus, Siege of Halicarnassus, Siege of Miletus, Battle of Issus, Siege of Tyre (332 BC), Siege of Gaza, Battle of Gaugamela, Battle of the Persian Gate, Siege of Aornos, Battle of the Hydaspes River, Mallian CampaignSpouse(s)Drypetis princess of the Achaemenid dynasty in Persia.[1]Hephaestion (Greek: \u1f29\u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03c9\u03bd Hephaistion; c. 356 BC \u2013 324 BC), son of Amyntor, was a Macedonian nobleman and a general in the army of Alexander the Great. He was \"... by far the dearest of all the king's friends; he had been brought up with Alexander and shared all his secrets.\"[2] This friendship lasted throughout their lives, and was compared, by others as well as themselves, to that of Achilles and Patroclus.His military career was distinguished. A member of Alexander the Great\u2019s personal bodyguard, he went on to command the Companion cavalry and was entrusted with many other tasks throughout Alexander's ten-year campaign in Asia, including diplomatic missions, the bridging of major rivers, sieges and the foundation of new settlements. Besides being a soldier, engineer and diplomat he corresponded with the philosophers Aristotle and Xenocrates and actively supported Alexander in his attempts to integrate the Greeks and Persians. Alexander formally made him his second-in-command when he appointed him Chiliarch of the empire. Alexander also made him part of the royal family when he gave him as his bride Drypetis, sister to his own second wife Stateira, both daughters of Darius III of Persia. When he died suddenly at Ecbatana around age thirty-two, Alexander was overwhelmed with grief. He petitioned the oracle at Siwa to grant Hephaestion divine status and thus Hephaestion was honoured as a Divine Hero. Hephaestion was cremated in Babylon in the presence of the entire army.[3] At the time of his own death a mere eight months later, Alexander was still planning lasting monuments to Hephaestion's memory.Contents [hide]1Youth and education2Career3Relationships4Death and funeral4.1Amphipolis Tomb5Portrayals of Hephaestion in fiction6Notes7References7.1Ancient sources7.2Modern sources8Further reading9External linksYouth and education[edit]The emblema of the Stag Hunt Mosaic, c. 300 BC, from Pella; the figure on the right is possibly Alexander the Great due to the date of the mosaic along with the depicted upsweep of his centrally-parted hair (anastole); the figure on the left wielding a double-edged axe (associated with Hephaistos) is perhaps Hephaestion.[4]Hephaestion\u2019s exact age is not known. No concise biography has ever been written about him, likely stemming from the fact that he died before Alexander and none of those among Alexander's companions who survived him would have had a need to promote someone other than themselves. Many scholars cite Hephaestion\u2019s age as being similar to Alexander\u2019s so it is fair to assume that he was born about 356 BC. He is said to have become a page in 343 BC, a role common to adolescent boys of the aristocratic class in Macedon.[5] As a member of the court, he may have met Alexander around this time.The only surviving anecdote from Hephaestion\u2019s youth comes courtesy of the Alexander Romance. According to this tale, \u201c... one day when Alexander was 15 years old [...] sailing with Hephaestion, his friend, he easily reached Pisa [...] and he went off to stroll with Hephaestion.\u201d[6] That Alexander\u2019s exact age is given provides another clue to Hephaestion\u2019s upbringing because at fifteen Alexander and his companions were at Mieza studying under Aristotle.[7] Hephaestion has never been named among those who attended the lectures at Mieza, but his close friendship with Alexander at that age suggests strongly that he was numbered among them. More telling is Hephaestion\u2019s name being found in a catalogue of Aristotle\u2019s correspondences.[8] The letters themselves no longer exist, but for them to have found their way into an official catalogue, their content must have been of some significance. It implies that Hephaestion received a good education and shows that Aristotle was impressed enough by his pupil to send letters throughout Alexander's expanding empire to converse with him.A few years after the lectures at Mieza, Hephaestion\u2019s presence was notably absent when several of Alexander\u2019s close friends were exiled as a result of the Pixodarus affair. Among those exiled by Philip II after Alexander\u2019s failed attempt to offer himself as groom to the Carian princess were Ptolemy, Nearchus, Harpalus, Erigyius and Laomedon.[9] The reason for Hephaestion\u2019s absence from this list could be due to the fact that all of the exiled men were older friends of Alexander, Erigyius himself roughly 24 years older than the prince.[10] Hephaestion was a contemporary of Alexander and it is likely that his influence might have been seen as less of a threat than these more mature companions. Whatever Hephaestion\u2019s opinion had been on the whole affair, like many of Alexander\u2019s other childhood companions he was not exiled in its aftermath.While it is true that very little detail of Hephaestion\u2019s childhood and education can be found, that which remains gives credence to what is known about his later life. His friendship with Alexander was long-lasting, as was his tenure in the court at Pella; he even shared the same education as the future Great King of Greece and Asia. With such a promising start, age and experience would have helped mould Hephaestion Amyntoros into the man who would one day be the second most powerful man in Alexander\u2019s empire, second only to the king himself.Career[edit]Sharing Alexander's upbringing, Hephaestion would have learned to fight and to ride well from an early age. His first taste of military action was probably the campaign against the Thracians while Alexander was regent, followed by Philip II's Danube campaign (342 BC) and the battle of Chaeronea (338 BC) while he was still in his teens. His name is not mentioned in lists of high-ranking officers during the early battles of Alexander's Danube campaign (335 BC) or the invasion of Persia. Nor are the names of Alexander's other close friends and contemporaries listed, suggesting that their promotions, when they achieved them, were earned by merit.The Battle of Issus by Albrecht Altdorfer, 1529Hephaestion's career was never solely a military one. Right from the start he was also engaged in special missions, sometimes diplomatic, sometimes technical. The first mention of his career in the sources is a diplomatic mission of some importance. After the battle of Issus (333 BC) when Alexander was proceeding south down the Phoenician coast and had received the capitulation of Sidon, Hephaestion was \"... authorised to appoint to the throne the Sidonian he considered most deserving of that high office.\"[11] Hephaestion took local advice and chose a man distantly related to the royal family, but whose honesty had reduced him to working as a gardener. The man, Abdalonymus, had a successful royal career, fully justifying Hephaestion's choice.After the siege of Tyre (332 BC) Alexander entrusted his fleet to Hephaestion, who had orders to skirt the coast and head for Gaza, their next objective, while Alexander himself led the army overland.[12] Hephaestion's task was not an easy one for this was not the Athenian fleet with which Alexander had started and had earlier disbanded, but a motley collection of semi-reluctant allies of many nationalities who would need holding together with patience and strength. Furthermore, on arrival at Gaza the cargo of siege engines had to be unloaded, transported across difficult terrain and reassembled.Plutarch, while writing about Alexander's correspondence, reveals an occasion when Hephaestion was away on business and Alexander wrote to him. The subject matter suggests that this took place while they were in Egypt. What business Hephaestion was attending to we do not know, but Andrew Chugg[13] has suggested that it was concerned either with his command of the fleet or Athenian diplomacy. He quotes sources which suggest that Hephaestion had been approached by Aristion of Athens to effect a reconciliation between Alexander and Demosthenes and, certainly, Athens' inaction during the revolt of the Spartan king Agis would seem to support this idea. As Chugg says, \"If he did persuade Alexander to reach an accommodation with Demosthenes at this critical juncture, as would seem likely from the circumstances, then he was significantly responsible for saving the situation for Macedon in Greece by preventing the revolt of Agis spreading to Athens and her allies.\"[13]It is likely, though not certain, that it was Hephaestion who led the advance army from Egypt to bridge the Euphrates river. Darius of Persia sent Mazaeus to hold the opposite bank while the bridging work was in progress. This Mazaeus was the commander who threw away what looked like certain victory on the Persian right at the battle of Gaugamela (331 BC) and later became Alexander's governor of Babylon. Robin Lane Fox has suggested that a conversation with Hephaestion may have won Mazaeus over: \"It is conceivable that the battle of Gaugamela was partly won on the banks of the Euphrates and that Mazaeus' reinstatement was less a sign of magnanimity than of a prearranged reward.\"[14]It is at Gaugamela that mention is first made of Hephaestion's rank. He is called the \"... commander of the bodyguards (somatophylakes).\"[15] This is not the Royal Squadron, whose duties also included guarding the king in battle and which was at that time commanded by Cleitus\u2014a man of the older generation\u2014but a small group of close companions specifically designated to fight alongside the king. Hephaestion was certainly in the thick of things with Alexander for Arrian tells us he was wounded and Curtius specifically mentions that it was a spear wound in the arm.[16][17]After Gaugamela there is the first indication that Alexander intended reconciliation with the Persians and that Hephaestion supported him in this unpopular policy. One evening in Babylon Alexander noticed a high-born woman obliged to dance as part of the entertainment. Curtius explains: \"The following day, he (Alexander) instructed Hephaestion to have all the prisoners brought to the royal quarters and there he verified the lineage of each of them.\"[18] Alexander had realized that people from noble families were being treated with little dignity and wanted to do something about it. That he chose Hephaestion to help him shows that he could rely on Hephaestion's tact and sympathy. Yet Alexander could also rely on Hephaestion for firmness and resolve. When his policies had led to a plot against his life, the possible involvement of a senior officer, Philotas, caused much concern. It was Hephaestion, along with Craterus and Coenus, who insisted on, and actually carried out, the customary torture.[19]After the execution of Philotas (330 BC), Hephaestion was appointed joint commander\u2014with Cleitus\u2014of the Companion cavalry, Philotas' former position. This dual appointment was a way of satisfying two divergent shades of opinion now hardening throughout the army: one, like Hephaestion, broadly supportive of Alexander's policy of integration, and the other, that of Philip's older veterans in particular, whose implacable resentment of Persian ways was well represented by Cleitus.[20] The cavalry prospered under this command, showing itself equal to learning new tactics necessary against Scythian nomads and to counter-insurgency measures such as those deployed in the spring of 328 BC. The army set out from Balkh in five columns to spread through the valleys between the Oxus and Tanais[dubious \u2013 discuss] rivers to pacify Sogdiana. Hephaestion commanded one of the columns and, after arriving at Marakanda, he set out again to establish settlements in the region.[21]In spring 327 BC the army headed into India and Alexander divided his forces. He led his section north into the Swat Valley, while Hephaestion and Perdiccas took a sizeable contingent through the Khyber Pass. Hephaestion's orders were to \"... take over either by force or agreement all places on their march and upon reaching the Indus to make suitable preparations for crossing.\"[22] They were in unknown territory, whose political and geographical landscapes were unfamiliar, and Hephaestion would have had to make decisions on the spot and act accordingly. He reached the Indus with the land behind him conquered, including the successful siege of Peuceolatis, which took thirty days, and proceeded to organize the construction of boats for the crossing.[23]Alexander often had to divide his forces and command was given to a variety of senior officers on different occasions. For example, a few weeks before this mission of Hephaestion's, Craterus had been sent with a large force to subdue the last two remaining Bactrian rebels.[24] It seems that Hephaestion was chosen when the objectives were far from clear-cut, and Alexander needed a commander on whom he could rely to do what he would have done himself without needing instructions.A painting by Charles Le Brun depicting Alexander and Hephaestion (in red cloak), facing Porus, during the Battle of the Hydaspes.Hephaestion took part in a notable cavalry charge at the battle of the Hydaspes river (326 BC).[25] Then when the army began its homeward journey he was again entrusted with half the army, including the elite troops and two hundred elephants, as they travelled south-west along the banks of the Hydaspes.[26] Some of the army, including Alexander himself, travelled in boats which had been provided by the sponsorship of leading courtiers. Arrian lists Hephaestion first among these \"honorary trierarchs\", indicating his leading position at this time.[27] On entering hostile territory Alexander split his forces into three. Hephaestion's section marched \"... five days in advance, with the object of intercepting and capturing any native troops which ... might be rapidly moving forward\".[28] Again, Hephaestion was called upon when initiative was required. After Alexander had taken a detour to subdue a hostile tribe, in which he was seriously injured, Hephaestion took command of the greater part of the army as they travelled down the Indus to the sea.[29] At the coast he organized the construction of a fortress and a harbour for the fleet at Pattala.[30]Hephaestion was in command at Pattala while Alexander advanced. When he rejoined Alexander at Rhambacia he established a city there also.[31] Hephaestion crossed the Gedrosian desert with Alexander, sharing the torments of that journey and, when the army was safely back in Susa, he was decorated for bravery.[32] He was to take part in no further fighting; he had only months to live. But, having ended his military career as Alexander's de facto second-in-command, he was also his second in the political sphere. Alexander had made that official by naming him Chiliarch. Photius mentions Perdiccas being appointed \"... to command the chiliarchy which Hephaestion had originally held.\"[33]Relationships[edit]Little is known of Hephaestion's personal relationships beyond his close friendship with Alexander. Alexander was an outgoing, charismatic man who had many friends but his dearest and closest friend and confidant was Hephaestion.[2] Theirs was a friendship which had been forged in boyhood. It endured through adolescence, through Alexander's becoming king, and through the hardships of campaigning and the flatteries of court life and their marriages. Apart from Diogenes of Sinope's alleged letter quoted below, heavily hinting at Alexander's yielding to Hephaestion's thighs, ancient sources do not generally mention that Hephaestion and Alexander may have been lovers, as some modern scholars have theorized. Overall direct evidence is non-existent and, at least according to Thomas R. Martin, this was a practice which was uncommon by majority Greek standards of their time.[34]Alexander and Hephaestion enter the tent of the captive royal family of Darius. From a 1696 edition of Curtius.Their tutor Aristotle described friendship as \"... one soul abiding in two bodies\".[35] That they themselves considered their friendship to be of such a kind is shown by the stories of the morning after the battle of Issus. Diodorus,[36] Arrian[37] and Curtius[38] all describe the scene when Alexander and Hephaestion went together to visit the captured Persian royal family. Its senior member, the queen Sisygambis, knelt to Hephaestion to plead for their lives mistaking him for Alexander because he was the taller and both young men were wearing similar clothes. When she realized her mistake she was acutely embarrassed but Alexander reassured her with the words, \"You were not mistaken, Mother; this man too is Alexander.\"[38] Their love for each other was no secret, as is borne out by their own words. Hephaestion, when replying to a letter to Alexander's mother, Olympias, said \"... you know that Alexander means more to us than anything.\"[39] Arrian says that Alexander, after Hephaestion's death, described him as \"... the friend I valued as my own life.\"[40] Paul Cartledge describes their closeness when he says: \"Alexander seems actually to have referred to Hephaestion as his alter ego.\"[41]Their friendship was also a working partnership; in all that Alexander undertook, Hephaestion was at his side. They worked well together; it is possible to discern a pattern, when studying Hephaestion's career, of Alexander's constant trust in, and increasing reliance on, Hephaestion. By the time of the advance into India, after the deaths of senior generals from the older generation, there had been worrying instances among senior officers of their own generation of treachery,[42] a lack of sympathy with Alexander's aims of further integration of Persians into the army,[43] and of sheer incompetence.[44] Time after time, when Alexander needed to divide his forces he entrusted half to Hephaestion, knowing that in him he had a man of unquestionable loyalty who understood and sympathized with his aims and, above all, who got the job done.Hephaestion played a full part in Alexander's regular consultations with senior officers, but he was the one to whom Alexander would also talk in private, sharing his thoughts, hopes and plans. Curtius[45] states that Hephaestion was the sharer of all his secrets. And Plutarch[46] describes an occasion when Alexander had a controversial change to impose and implies that Hephaestion was the one with whom Alexander discussed it and who arranged for the change to be implemented. According to the painting done by Aetion of Alexander's first wedding, Hephaestion was his torch bearer (best man), showing by this not only his friendship, but also his support for Alexander's policies as Alexander's choice of an Asian bride had not been a popular one. By the time they returned to Persia Hephaestion was officially, by title, Alexander's second-in-command, as he had long been in practice, and also his brother-in-law. Hammond sums up their public relationship well: \"It is not surprising that Alexander was as closely attached to Hephaestion as Achilles was to Patroclus\",[47] and \"At the time of his death Hephaestion held the highest single command, that of the Companion Cavalry; and had been repeatedly second in command to Alexander in the hierarchy of the Asian court, holding the title of Chiliarch, which had been held by Nabarzanes under Darius. Thus Alexander honoured Hephaestion both as the closest of his friends and the most distinguished of his Field Marshals.\"[48]Alexander, left, and Hephaestion, right. The Getty Villa Museum.It has been suggested by some modern scholars that as well as being close friends Alexander and Hephaestion were also lovers despite the fact that hardly any of Alexander's extant ancient Greek or Roman biographers ever refer to Hephaestion as anything but Alexander's friend,[34][49] consistent with Hephaestion's epithet \u201cPhilalexandros\u201d which was given to him by Alexander himself.[50] The ancient sources generally name Hephaestion only as a good and loyal friend of Alexander's.[51]However, Arrian[52] describes the occasion when Alexander and Hephaestion publicly identified themselves with close friends Achilles and Patroclus. It happened right at the beginning of the campaign in Asia when Alexander led a contingent of the army to visit Troy, scene of the events in his beloved Iliad. He laid a wreath on the tomb of Achilles and Hephaestion laid a wreath on the tomb of Patroclus and they ran a race, naked, to honour their dead heroes. Arrian discreetly draws no conclusions from this, but, according to Thomas R. Martin, by no means does the identification of Alexander and Hephaestion with Achilles and Patroclus equate to their being homosexuals as Homer, author of the Iliad, never suggested that Achilles and his close friend Patroclus were homosexual or that they had sexual relations. Martin further suggests this concept was theorized by unspecified \"later authors\",[34] who include however such eminent writers as Aeschylus and Plato[53] that had lived before Alexander and Hephaestion's time. Thus, according to Robin Lane Fox quite different conclusions can be drawn: \"It was a remarkable tribute, uniquely paid, and it is also Hephaestion's first mention in Alexander's career. Already the two were intimate, Patroclus and Achilles even to those around them; the comparison would remain to the end of their days and is proof of their life as lovers, for by Alexander's time, Achilles and Patroclus were agreed to have enjoyed the relationship which Homer himself had never directly mentioned.\"[54]Hephaestion and Alexander grew up in a time where, according to Thomas R. Martin, homosexual affairs were seen as abnormal by majority Greek standards of their time.[34] But Andrew Chugg, Robin Lane Fox and others show different views. According to Eva Cantarella, for instance, male bisexuality was widely permitted and ruled by law, and generally not frowned upon by the public to the extent to which it remained within the preset limits. The Greeks used to approach the relationships between men in a very different way from how they will be dealt with today (with exceptions of course). For the Greeks \"homosexuality was not an exclusive choice. Loving another man was not an option out of the norm, different, somehow deviant. It was just a part of life experience; it was the show of an either sentimental or sexual drive that, over a lifetime, alternated and was associated (sometimes at the very same time) with love for a woman\". [55] The pattern that same-sex love affairs followed, however, was not the same in every city-state. Some Roman and later writers, taking the Athenian pattern as their example, have tended to assume either that Alexander and Hephaestion had a sexual relationship which belonged to their adolescence, after which they left it behind, or that one of them was older, the lover (erastes) and the other was the beloved (eromenos) despite there being scarcely any direct evidence that Alexander and Hephaestion had a sexual relationship at all.[56]The former assumption has persisted to the present day, with writers of fiction such as Mary Renault and the film director Oliver Stone among its proponents, as well as modern historians such as Paul Cartledge, who says: \"Rumour had it\u2014and rumour was for once surely correct\u2014that he [Hephaestion] and Alexander had once been more than just good friends.\"[57] Aelian takes the latter view when he uses just such an expression when describing the visit to Troy: \"Alexander laid a garland on Achilles' tomb and Hephaestion on Patroclus', indicating that he was Alexander's eromenos, as Patroclus was of Achilles.\"[58]However, what was the case in Athens was not necessarily the case in Macedon. As Robin Lane Fox says, \"... descendants of the Dorians were considered and even expected to be openly homosexual, especially among their ruling class, and the Macedonian kings had long insisted on their pure Dorian ancestry.\"[59] This was no fashionable affectation; this was something that belonged at the heart of what it was to be Dorian, and therefore Macedonian, and had more in common with the Theban Sacred Band than with Athens.[60] In light of this, it is not surprising that there are many indications that their sexual relationship was indeed lifelong. Lucian, writing in his book On Slips of the Tongue[61] describes an occasion when Hephaestion's conversation one morning implied that he had been in Alexander's tent all night, and Plutarch[62] describes the intimacy between them when he tells how Hephaestion was in the habit of reading Alexander's letters with him, and of a time when he showed that the contents of a letter were to be kept secret by touching his ring to Hephaestion's lips. Diogenes of Sinope, in a letter written to Alexander when he was a grown man, accuses Alexander of being \"... ruled by Hephaestion's thighs.\"[63]No other circumstance shows better the nature and length of their relationship than Alexander's overwhelming grief at Hephaestion's death. As Andrew Chugg says, \"... it is surely incredible that Alexander's reaction to Hephaestion's death could indicate anything other than the closest relationship imaginable.\"[64] The many and varied ways, both spontaneous and planned, by which Alexander poured out his grief are detailed below. In the context of the nature of their relationship however, one stands out as remarkable. Arrian says that Alexander \"... flung himself on the body of his friend and lay there nearly all day long in tears, and refused to be parted from him until he was dragged away by force by his Companions.\"[65]The family of Darius in front of Alexander, by Justus Sustermans and preserved in the Biblioteca Museu V\u00edctor Balaguer. In this picture we can see Hephaestion point out AlexanderSuch an all-encompassing love often leaves little room for other affections. Hephaestion was the best friend of Alexander, his king and his commanding officer, so it is not surprising that we only hear of several other close friendships or attachments in his life. There is no evidence, however, that he was anything but popular and well liked among the group of Alexander's close friends and Companions who had grown up together, and worked well together for so many years. It is possible that he was closest to Perdiccas, because it was with Perdiccas that he went on the mission to take Peuceolatis and bridge the Indus. By that time, as Alexander's effective second-in-command, he could doubtless have chosen any officer he cared to name.[66] They accomplished everything they set out to do with great success, which indicates that the two of them worked well together, and that Hephaestion found the irrepressible Perdiccas a congenial companion. It is notable that their two cavalry regiments in particular were selected by Alexander for the dangerous crossing of the river Hydaspes before the battle with the Indian king, Porus. On that occasion superb teamwork would have been of paramount importance.[67]It would be wrong to imply that Hephaestion was universally liked or admired however. Outside the close-knit coterie of the Macedonian high command he had his enemies. This is clear from Arrian's comment about Alexander's grief: \"All writers have agreed that it was great, but personal prejudice, for or against both Hephaestion and Alexander himself, has coloured the accounts of how he expressed it.\"[68]Yet given the factions and jealousies that arise in any court and that Hephaestion was supremely close to the greatest monarch the western world had yet seen, it is remarkable how little enmity he inspired. Arrian[69] mentions a quarrel with Alexander's secretary Eumenes but, because of a missing page in the text, the greater part of the detail is missing, leaving only the conclusion that something persuaded Hephaestion, though against his will, to make up the quarrel. However, Plutarch, who wrote about Eumenes in his series of Parallel Lives,[70] mentions that it was about lodgings and a flute-player, so perhaps this was an instance of some deeper antagonism breaking out into a quarrel over a triviality. What that antagonism might have been, it is not possible to know, but someone with the closeness to the king of a secretary might well have felt some jealousy for Hephaestion's even greater closeness.The weddings at Susa; Alexander to Stateira (right), and Hephaestion to Drypetis (left). Late 19th-century engraving.In only one instance is Hephaestion known to have quarrelled with a fellow officer and that was with Craterus. In this instance it is easier to see that resentment might have been felt on both sides, for Craterus was one of those officers who vehemently disliked Alexander's policy of integrating Greek and Persian, whereas Hephaestion was very much in favour. Plutarch tells the story: \"For this reason a feeling of hostility grew and festered between the two and they often came into open conflict. Once on the expedition to India they actually drew their swords and came to blows ...\".[71] Alexander, who also valued Craterus highly as a most competent officer, was forced to intervene and had stern words for both. It is a measure of how high feelings were running over this contentious issue that such a thing should have happened and also an indication of how closely Hephaestion identified Alexander's wishes with his own. Hephaestion gave perhaps the ultimate proof of this in the summer of 324 BC, when he accepted as his wife Drypetis, daughter of Darius and sister to Alexander's own second wife Stateira.[1] Of his short married life nothing is known, except that at the time of Alexander's own death, eight months after Hephaestion's, Drypetis was still mourning the husband to whom she had been married for only four months.[72]For Alexander to marry a daughter of Darius made good political sense, allying himself firmly with the Persian ruling class, but for Hephaestion to marry her sister shows the high esteem in which Alexander held him, bringing him into the royal family itself. They became brothers-in-law, and yet there was more to it than that. Alexander, says Arrian \"... wanted to be uncle to Hephaestion's children ...\".[73] Thus it is possible to imagine Alexander and Hephaestion hoping that their respective offspring might unite their lines and that, ultimately, the crown of Macedon and Persia might be worn by one who was a descendant of them both.[73]Death and funeral[edit]In spring 324 BC Hephaestion left Susa, where he had been married, and accompanied Alexander and the rest of the army as they travelled towards Ecbatana. They arrived in the autumn and it was there, during games and festivals, that Hephaestion fell ill with a fever. Arrian says that after the fever had run for seven days, Alexander had to be summoned from the games to Hephaestion, who was seriously ill. He did not arrive in time; by the time he got there, Hephaestion was dead.[74] Plutarch says that being a young man and a soldier, Hephaestion had ignored medical advice and as soon as his doctor, Glaucias, had gone off to the theatre, he ate a large breakfast consisting of a boiled fowl and a cooler of wine, and then fell sick and died.[75]Piecing the accounts together, it seems as if Hephaestion's fever had run its course for seven days, after which time he was sufficiently recovered for his doctor, and Alexander himself, to feel it was safe to leave him, and for Hephaestion to feel hungry. His meal, however, seems to have caused a relapse that led to his rapid death. Precisely why this should have happened is not known. As Mary Renault says, \"This sudden crisis in a young, convalescent man is hard to account for.\"[76] The explanation that fits most of the facts is that the fever was typhoid and that solid food perforated the ulcerated intestine that the typhoid would have caused. This would have led to internal bleeding, though it would be unusual in that case for death to follow quite as swiftly as it seems to have done here. For that reason, it is not possible altogether to discount other possible explanations, one of them being poison.Following Hephaestion's death his body was cremated and the ashes were taken to Babylon.[77][78] The general Eumenes suggested that divine honors be given to Hephaestion, this was later done.[78]Hephaestion's death is dealt with at greater length by the ancient sources than any of the events of his life, because of its profound effect upon Alexander. Plutarch says \"... Alexander's grief was uncontrollable ...\" and adds that he ordered many signs of mourning, notably that the manes and tails of all horses should be shorn, the demolition of the battlements of the neighbouring cities and the banning of flutes and every other kind of music.[79] Arrian relates an account that \"... he flung himself on the body of his friend and lay there nearly all day long in tears, and refused to be parted from him until he was dragged away by force by his Companions ...\",[80] another that said \"... he lay stretched upon the corpse all day and the whole night too ...\",[80] and another which told how he had the doctor, Glaucias, executed for his lack of care.[81] Arrian also mentions Alexander ordering the shrine of Asclepios in Ecbatana to be razed to the ground,[82] and that he cut his hair short in mourning,[83] this last a poignant reminder of Achilles' last gift to Patroclus on his funeral pyre: \"... he laid the lock of hair in the hands of his beloved companion, and the whole company was moved to tears.\"[84]Another hint that Alexander looked to Achilles to help him to express his grief may be found in the campaign, shortly following these events, against a tribe called the Cossaeans. Plutarch says they were massacred as an offering to the spirit of Hephaestion and it is quite possible to imagine that to Alexander this might have followed in spirit Achilles' killing of \"... twelve high-born youths ...\" beside Patroclus' funeral pyre.[79]Arrian states that all his sources agree that \"... for two whole days after Hephaestion's death Alexander tasted no food and paid no attention in any way to his bodily needs but lay on his bed now crying lamentably, now in the silence of grief.\"[85] Alexander ordered a period of mourning throughout the empire. Arrian tells us that \"Many of the Companions, out of respect for Alexander, dedicated themselves and their arms to the dead man ...\"[86] The army, too, remembered him; Alexander did not appoint anyone to take Hephaestion's place as commander of the Companion cavalry; he \"... wished Hephaestion's name to be preserved always in connection with it, so Hephaestion's Regiment it continued to be called, and Hephaestion's image continued to be carried before it.\"[87]Alexander sent messengers to the oracle at Siwa to ask if Amon would permit Hephaestion to be worshipped as a god. When the reply came saying he might be worshipped not as a god, but as a divine hero, Alexander was pleased and \"... from that day forward saw that his friend was honoured with a hero's rites.\"[88] He saw to it that shrines were erected to Hephaestion's memory, and evidence that the cult took hold can be found in a simple votary plaque now in Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki, inscribed, \"To the Hero Hephaestion\".[89][90]Hephaestion was given a magnificent funeral. Its cost is variously given in the sources as 10,000 talents or 12,000 talents. It is difficult to give a modern equivalent for such a huge amount but we know that in Hephaestion\u2019s time, the daily wage of a skilled worker was two or three drachmas. In western Europe, 2008, that would be between \u00a350 and \u00a3100, so the lowest possible value for 1 drachma in modern terms is \u00a325. We know there were 6,000 drachmas in a talent, so even at the most conservative estimate, Hephaestion\u2019s funeral would have cost \u00a31,500,000,000. Alexander himself drove the funeral carriage part of the way back to Babylon with some of the driving entrusted to Hephaestion's friend Perdiccas.[82] At Babylon funeral games were held in Hephaestion's honour. The contests ranged from literature to athletics and 3,000 competitors took part, the festival eclipsing anything that had gone before both in cost and in numbers taking part.[91] Plutarch says that Alexander planned to spend ten thousand talents on the funeral and the tomb. He employed Stasicrates, \"... as this artist was famous for his innovations, which combined an exceptional degree of magnificence, audacity and ostentation ...\", to design the pyre for Hephaestion.[92]The pyre was sixty metres high, square in shape and built in stepped levels. The first level was decorated with two hundred and forty ships with golden prows, each of these adorned with armed figures with red banners filling the spaces between. On the second level were torches with snakes at the base, golden wreaths in the middle and at the top, flames surmounted by eagles. The third level showed a hunting scene, and the fourth a battle of centaurs, all done in gold. On the fifth level, also in gold, were lions and bulls, and on the sixth the arms of Macedon and Persia. The seventh and final level bore sculptures of sirens, hollowed out to conceal a choir who would sing a lament.[93] It is possible that the pyre was not burnt, but that it was actually intended as a tomb or lasting memorial; if so, it is likely that it was never completed, as there are references to expensive, uncompleted projects at the time of Alexander's own death.[94]One final tribute remained, and it is compelling in its simplicity and in what it reveals about the high esteem in which Hephaestion was held by Alexander. On the day of the funeral, he gave orders that the sacred flame in the temple should be extinguished. Normally, this was only done on the death of the Great King himself.[95]Amphipolis Tomb[edit]Based on a monogram found in the Amphipolis Tomb, the lead archaeologist, Katerina Peristeri, claims that the whole tumulus was a funerary monument for Hephaestion, built between 325 - 300 BC.[96]Portrayals of Hephaestion in fiction[edit]Cave, A.

In any case, the ancient sources were certain that Alexander was sexually active with women. When Barsine, the daughter of a prominent Persian and a Greek woman, and the widow of Memnon of Rhodes, was captured in 333 and brought to Alexander, he was reportedly so entranced by her beauty \u2014 and her high level knowledge of Greek literature \u2014 that he became her lover. Plutarch asserted that Barsine was the only woman with whom Alexander had sex before his (first) marriage several years later, but other sources report that he had learned about sex from Pancaste, a woman form Thessaly in Greece so beautiful that Apelles the painter became famous for his nude portrait of her. Our sources also recount that Alexander, like the Persian kings he replaces, regularly took his pick of the many concubines kept at the court as temporary sex partners. Most colourfully of all they also report that Alexander spent thirteen days having sex with the female leader of the tribe of women warriors (\u201cAmazons\u201d), who came to him from the Caucasus region, asking that he impregnate her so she could have his child. The ancient sources do not report, however, what modern scholars have asserted: that Alexander and his very close friend Hephaestion were lovers. Achilles and his equally close friend Patroclus provided the legendary model for this friendship, but Homer in the Iliad never suggested that they had sex with each other. (That came from later authors.) If Alexander and Hephaestion did have a sexual relationship, it would have been transgressive by majority Greek standards...Jump up ^ Diogenes Laertius 5.1.20Jump up ^ Diodorus 17.37.5Jump up ^ Arrian 2.12.31^ Jump up to: a b Curtius 3.12.17Jump up ^ Diodorus 17.114.3Jump up ^ Arrian 7.14.50Jump up ^ Cartledge p19Jump up ^ Arrian 3.26Jump up ^ Arrian 4.8Jump up ^ Arrian 4.5Jump up ^ Curtius 12.16.2Jump up ^ Plutarch 55.1Jump up ^ Hammond 1980, p.16Jump up ^ Hammond 1980, p.250Jump up ^ Cartledge, Paul (2010).

His daughter was wet-nurse of Philip's son and crown-prince Alexander.\n\nClitus became an officer of the Companion cavalry, a unit of eight squadrons (of 225 horsemen each) that was Macedonia's most effective weapon in battle. Its overall commander was Philotas, the son of Philip's most reliable general Parmenion. Clitus' exact position among the Companions is unclear, but he may already have been commander of the agema, the squadron that served as the king's bodyguard.\n\nIn any case, he was close to the young king during the battle of the Granicus, where Alexander defeated a Persian provincial army (June 334; text). During the fight, Clitus saved Alexander's life. He certainly was commander of the agema during the battle of Gaugamela (1 October 331).\n\nHe is next heard of in Susa, one of the capitals of the Achaemenid empire, where he fell ill. In 330, he brought Macedonian reinforcements to Parthia, where he joined forces with Alexander in September. By now, he was one of Alexander's most trusted officers, and he was the natural successor of Philotas when he was accused of treason in October 330 and executed. Clitus was probably not involved in the trial of his superior, which may have been masterminded by another officer, Craterus.\n\nAlexander, however, had learned a lesson from the Philotas affair: it was dangerous to make one man sole commander of the Companions. Therefore, Clitus had to accept a second, minor commander, Alexander's closest friend Hephaestion.\n\nThe years 329 and 328 saw fighting in Bactria and Sogdia, satrapies in the northeast of the Achaemenid empire. Since most of the fighting was done on horseback, we would expect the commanders of the Companion cavalry to be prominent in our sources, but they are conspicuously absent. The reason is that the unit of Hephaestion and Clitus was too large for the guerilla warfare in Sogdia. It was divided into smaller units and Hephaestion commanded one of them. Clitus was appointed as future satrap of Bactria and Sogdia, an incredibly important function. (In the Achaemenid empire, this task was left to the crown prince.)\n\nIn the autumn of 328, however, a tragic incident took place. During a drinking party in the satrapial palace at Maracanda in Sogdia, many courtiers were flattering Alexander, who had won a difficult war in the Sogdianian desert. Some called him the son of Zeus-Ammon and belittled Alexander's human father Philip, others made jokes about the commanders who had been defeated and killed by the native leader Spitamenes. This was more than Clitus, who had served under Philip and knew the dead commanders, could stomach: he started to praise Philip.\n\nHearing his words, Alexander felt offended, and in his drunken rage pushed aside his bodyguards Ptolemy and Perdiccas and run a lance through Clitus, who died on the spot.\n\nWhen the king was sober again, he understood that he had made one of the greatest mistakes of his life. For three days, he considered suicide but then he decided to accept life again. The fact that the officers had constructed some evidence to suggest that Clitus was a traitor, may have helped. The same can be said about the court philosopher Anaxarchus of Abdera, who told him that the king was justice impersonated, and could therefore never act badly.\n\nThis may have been comfortable to Alexander, but set a new standard of flattery. From now on, hardly anybody dared to correct Alexander any more.\n\nClitus is sometimes called \"Clitus the Black\" to distinguish him from another Macedonian officer (\"the White\"), who rose to prominence after Alexander's death."}, {"url": "https://www.livius.org/articles/battle/gaugamela-331-bce/", "page_content": "Gaugamela (331 BCE) Q179670\n\nBattle of Gaugamela (October 1, 331 BCE): decisive battle in the war between Macedonia and the Achaemenid Empire, fought in northern Iraq. The outcome was influenced by a celestial omen that announced the imminent downfall of the Persian king Darius III Codomannus and the succession by Alexander the Great.\n\nDelay\n\nAlexander the Great\n\nIn the summer of 331, Darius learned that Alexander was returning from Egypt. Alexander soon reached Tyre, where he made a sacrifice to Melqart and organised sporting contests and a theatre festival. Now that Alexander controlled the wealth of such cities as Sardes, Damascus, and Memphis, he was in a position to pay huge fees, buying up actors who were still under contract in Greece. Other guests from Greece included envoys petitioning for the release of soldiers captured at Granicus. King Agis III of Sparta had started his war of Greek liberation and had already scored one victory over a Macedonian contingent, even though he did not yet have the support of all the Greek cities. So Alexander complied with the envoys' request, with the result that in Athens, for example, enough sympathy was aroused for the Macedonian cause to dissuade people from casting in their lot with the Spartans. At the same time, Alexander sent hundreds of Phoenician and Cypriot ships to Crete and the Peloponnese to do battle with Agis.\n\nAlexander was biding his time. He expected Darius to attack him, but that would have been uncharacteristically foolish. Darius preferred to let Alexander set out for the east, unfamiliar territory for the Macedonians. The son of Zeus had another reason for restraint. He was expecting fifteen thousand fresh troops to follow from Europe, troops that consistently failed to arrive, perhaps because Antipater needed them in the struggle against Agis. Eventually Alexander decided to set out for Mesopotamia, in the hope that reinforcements would catch up with him before he ran into Darius' army.\n\nOpening game\n\nThe Euphrates\n\nDarius put not the slightest obstacle in Alexander\u2019s way. Seventy years earlier, a Yaun\u00e2 army, led by the rebel Persian Prince Cyrus the Younger, had been defeated in Babylonia and largely destroyed on its way home. The Persian high command had reason to be optimistic and they allowed the Macedonians to advance towards the Euphrates, to a place the sources call Thapsacus, which must lie somewhere in the borderlands between Turkey and Syria. Alexander's friend Hephaestion had already started building two pontoon bridges when Mazaeus, the satrap of Babylonia, appeared with a small army on the east bank.\n\nAt first the Macedonians did not finish building their bridge all the way to the opposite bank, because they feared Mazaeus' troops would attack their bridgehead. But when Mazaeus heard that Alexander was on his way, he and his entire army fled. As soon as he had gone, the bridges were extended to the far bank and Alexander crossed them with his army.note[Arrian, Anabasis 3.7.2.]\n\nArrian's claim that Mazaeus fled as the Macedonian king approached is directly or indirectly based on words used by Alexander, Parmenion and other commanders to explain events to their own soldiers. It must surely have encouraged the men to know that the first contact with the enemy in this operation had brought such easy success.\n\nBut the Macedonian general staff knew better. In fact, few manoeuvres by Persian commanders were as successful as that of Mazaeus. Alexander had been planning to march along the Euphrates to Babylon, where he suspected he would find Darius' new army. The boats used to support the bridges had been intended as transport for heavy equipment. The river route was the shortest and it was also known to the Macedonian generals from Xenophon's Anabasis, an account of the expedition by Cyrus the Younger mentioned above. It was now obvious that Darius had blocked that route. The harvest was already in and all along the Euphrates the grain was stored in well-fortified settlements that would be easy for Mazaeus to defend. His presence meant that the Macedonians would have to engage in siege warfare to feed themselves. They would face hunger. The only alternative route was the Persian Royal Road, which Alexander knew lay somewhere to the unknown east.\n\nMacedonian detour, Persian preparations\n\nIt was impossible to march directly south-eastwards through the desert, since high summer had arrived and the average daytime temperature was close to 50\u00b0C. An ancient map describes the region as \"desolate plains, made uninhabitable by a lack of water\". The Macedonians would have to march around the desert, across the less arid steppe to the north.\n\nWhen Darius learned that Alexander had decided to make this detour and was marching towards the Tigris, he left Babylon and headed north to offer battle in the central region of what had once been the kingdom of Assyria. He knew his enemy would arrive there sooner or later and he looked for a broad battleground where his numerical superiority could be used to full advantage, which had not been the case at Issus. He set up his command centre at Arba'il (present-day Irbil), a stronghold on raised ground that was famous as the holy site of the fertility goddess I\u0161tar. To judge by its name, which means \"city of four gods\", it was home to the holy sites of a number of other cults as well. This was an excellent base. Here the Royal Road joined the roads to Armenia and the eastern satrapies, so it was a convenient spot to assemble a large army. The battlefield Darius had chosen lay seventy-five kilometres to the northwest, below a hill in the form of a dromedary's hump, which had given it the name derived from the Semitic word for that animal, gammalu. The Macedonians referred to these places as Arbela and Gaugamela.\n\nEdessa\n\nOnce the Persians had levelled the terrain to make it suitable for war chariots and horsemen, they had to ensure that Alexander would not march off somewhere else. Darius let his adversary reach Mesopotamia unhindered. The region reminded the Macedonians of their fatherland. When they came to Urhai, a city on a rock rising high above the plain, where water supplies were plentiful, they renamed it Edessa after a Macedonian city of a similar altitude that was famous for its waterfall. Alexander allowed his men to rest for a few days in nearby Harran and, being a religious man, is likely to have performed a sacrifice in the temple of the moon god Sin. Moving on through the forests of Nisibis, the Macedonians reached the Tigris on 18 September 331, somewhere close to what is now the Eski Mosul dam.\n\nTheir situation was problematic. Mazaeus' army, which had joined forces with Darius at Arbela, had been sent on ahead to lay waste to the land the Macedonians would have to pass through. They found too little food to feed themselves properly, but not so little that they were forced to turn back. All around them, Mazaeus' Babylonian horsemen set fire to the thatched roofs of houses, to sheaves of wheat, to crops and food stores:\n\nThe entire area to the east of the Tigris was still smoking from recent fires, since Mazaeus had put the fields to the torch as if he himself were the invading enemy. Because the daylight was subdued by dark clouds of smoke, Alexander held back for fear of a trap, but when his scouts told him the coast was clear, he sent horsemen ahead of him to test whether the river was fordable. note [Q. Curtius Rufus, History of Alexander 4.9.14f.]\n\nCrossing the Tigris\n\nTigris\n\nThe Persians guarding the ford pulled back after a brief skirmish and the Macedonians reached the opposite bank without significant difficulty. They were now in Assyria. Even though this once powerful kingdom had been ruled for the past three centuries by the Babylonians, whose empire in turn had been absorbed into that of the Persians, the name \"Assyria\" still spoke to the imagination. The fall of such a once-powerful city as Nineveh had made an impact even in Europe.\n\nWe know from the contemporary Astronomical Diaries that panic broke out in the Persian army that evening and it is natural to assume this was in response to the news that the enemy had crossed the river. But in fact there was no reason for panic. Alexander had done exactly what Darius had wanted him to do. By leaving the fordable stretches of the Euphrates and the Tigris practically unguarded, the Persians had managed to guide the enemy to the battlefield of their choice. Darius was completely in command of the situation and seemed guaranteed of victory.\n\nEvil omens\n\nAstronomical Diary mentioning the battle of Gaugamela\n\nIt was not to be. On 20 September, immediately after sunset, Darius\u2019 soldiers watched the moon turn blood red and then go dark. The Astronomical Diaries describe the omen:\n\nOn the thirteenth day of the month of Ul\u00fblu in the fifth year of Darius there was an eclipse of the moon, which was entirely darkened as Jupiter set. Saturn was four fingers distant. As the eclipse became total, a westerly wind was blowing; as the moon became visible again, an easterly wind. During the eclipse there were deaths and plagues.\n\nAccording to the Persian Magians, an eclipse of the moon was more significant for the king himself than most other omens.note[Herodotus of Halicarnassus, Histories 7.37.] The Babylonian Chaldaeans, in their catalogue of prophecies, offered an even less propitious interpretation:\n\nIf the moon or the sun are eclipsed and Jupiter is not visible: end of a dominion.note[Textes Cun\u00e9iformes du Louvre 6.13; rev. 2.16.]\n\nMoreover, according to the systems generally used in prophetic writings, an eclipse on the thirteenth day of the month meant disaster for Babylonia and an eclipse in the month of Ul\u00fblu meant disaster for Persia. A westerly wind during such an eclipse indicated that the catastrophe was to come from that direction; an easterly wind as the disc of the moon became visible meant the eastern regions were safe. The fact that Saturn was visible gave added force to all these prophecies.\n\nIn other words, after the omens of 20 September, a Babylonian astronomer would have known that the end was near for the ruler of Persia and Babylonia and that the cause of his demise would be an enemy from the west. Although the east would provide sanctuary, this was still a demoralising prospect. On another clay tablet we find a similar description of a lunar eclipse, but this time it predicts the fate of the victor rather than the defeated party:\n\nIf on the thirteenth or fourteenth of Ul\u00fblu the moon is eclipsed, the watch passes and the darkness remains, the moon\u2019s features are dark as lapis lazuli, the moon is eclipsed as far as its centre and its western quadrant covered, a westerly wind is blowing, the sky remains dark and the light concealed, then the king\u2019s son will undergo a cleansing ritual in front of the throne, but he will not ascend to the throne. An invader will mount an invasion supported by the rulers of the west; for eight years he will exercise kingship [lacuna]; he will defeat a hostile army; he will find abundance and riches on his path; he will pursue his enemy relentlessly and there will be no end to his good fortune. note [29th Ah\u00fb tablet of Enuma Anu Enlil; obv. 59-61.]\n\nAstrology was not a secret doctrine.note[Take, for instance, the Jewish teacher Samuel who was educated in Babylon as \"astrologer and fysician\", an exact translation of the title of the translators of the Babylonian shrine known as Esagila (Babylonian Talmud, Baba Metziah 85b).] We can assume that educated Babylonians in Darius' army, such as Mazaeus, would have known the fate of their king was sealed. Morale declined visibly, especially when the following day brought word that the Macedonians had made short work of the cavalry unit responsible for laying waste to the land through which Alexander was marching. The Astronomical Diaries record a new omen in the early hours of 23 September:\n\nA meteor flashed. Its light was visible on the ground.note[Astronomical Diary -330, obv.5.]\n\nWhen daylight came, one of the Persian courtiers taken prisoner during the battle of Issus arrived at Darius' camp, released in order to bring the great king more bad tidings: his wife Stateira, who had been take captive, had died in childbirth two days before. Alexander had buried her in accordance with Persian rites.\n\nThe Macedonians advance\n\nOn the twenty-fourth, Darius sent a messenger to the Macedonian army with a third peace proposal. This time he offered his enemy all the land to the west of the Euphrates and the hand in marriage of one of his daughters who had been captured by Alexander. This proposal shows that the Persian king was keen to avert a battle. His army had been so heavily demoralised by bad omens that he felt forced to make concessions. It was no use. The messenger returned the following day to report that Alexander had rejected his offer.\n\nHe also reported that the Macedonians were only forty kilometres away from the Persians that morning and advancing rapidly. In the evening another omen was seen; the Astronomical Diaries refer to it as a \"fall of fire\". Exactly what this means is unclear, but it may have been a bolide, a kind of slow meteorite. The phenomenon was seen by the Macedonians as well and it provoked panic. Mazaeus, who had taken up position on a hill between the Macedonian and Persian camps, could see that the enemy was not breaking camp that morning, in fact the Macedonians were starting to reinforce their position with a palisade. Alexander had never approached an enemy so circumspectly. More than ten kilometres separated the two armies.\n\nOn the evening of the twenty-sixth there was another fall of fire and Mazaeus informed his king that the Macedonian army remained in its camp. The enemy did not turn out on 27 or 28 September either. No doubt the soldiers made use of the time to sharpen their weapons and to exercise. On the evening of the twenty-ninth Mazaeus saw that the enemy army was on the move and he knew it was time to abandon the hill and join the Persian main force.\n\nA remarkable omission in the sources shows just how great the tension had become. The Macedonian army had to cross a river and pass along a canal that the Assyrian king Sennacherib had laid long before, as a means of supplying Nineveh with clean water. It was one of the greatest engineering achievements of the Ancient World, but it passed unnoticed. At least, the Greek sources, which generally make note of such things, do not refer to it. Neither is there any mention of the nearby ruins of an Assyrian palace.\n\nPreparing for battle\n\nWhen the sun rose on 30 September, Darius sent scouts to the far side of the field to study his opponents' battle formation. It looked similar to their formation at Issus. In the Macedonian centre was the phalanx (under the leadership of Craterus) and on the right wing stood the shield-bearer infantrymen (under the command of Parmenion's son Nicanor), the companion cavalry (led by Nicanor's brother Philotas and Alexander) and the light cavalry. On the left wing, commanded as ever by Parmenion, stood the Thessalian and Thracian horsemen, commanded as ever by Parmenion. A second line, invisible to the Persians, consisted of Greek troops and lightly armed soldiers who were to intervene if the Persians attempted a flanking movement.\n\nAlexander and his general staff were also studying the enemy lines, stretched out six kilometres wide in front of them. Arrianus records what they saw:\n\nAt the centre, where King Darius was to be found, the relatives of the king were arranged, along with the Persian Applebearers, the Indians, the \"Carian deportees\" and the Mardian archers; behind them, in a hollow, were the Babylonians [under the leadership of Mazaeus], the Red Sea contingents and the Sittacenians. Out in front on the left wing, opposite Alexander's right wing, stood the Sacaean horsemen [commanded by Bessus], around 1,000 Bactrians, and 100 scythed chariots. The elephants and 50 scythed chariots stood close to Darius' own royal squadron. At the front of the right wing stood the Armenian and Cappadocian horsemen, with another 50 scythed chariots. The Greek mercenaries were placed on either side of Darius and his Persian followers, directly opposite the Macedonian phalanx, since only they could possibly be a match for the phalanx. note [Arrian, Anabasis 3.11.5ff.]\n\nScythed chariots were war chariots with, as the name suggests, scythes attached to the wheels. Like the elephants, they were deployed mainly against enemy infantry.\n\nNight\n\nIt was an almost moonless night, but not dark, since hundreds of campfires were burning on either side of the plain. Darius did not want a repeat of the battle of Granicus, where the Macedonians had taken advantage of the fact that Persian armies were only allowed to march after performing sacrifices to the rising sun. So he had his men stay awake all night, in battle formation.\n\nAccompanied by generals and relatives he made the rounds of his troops [\u2026]. He invoked the sun, Mithra, and the holy eternal fire, to lend the kind of courage to his men that would be appropriate to the ancient fame and memory of their ancestors. \"If the human spirit is capable of understanding the signs of divine assistance,\" Darius went on, \"then the gods are definitely with us. We caused panic recently among the Macedonians and our enemies are still stiff with fear, throwing down their weapons. The tutelary deities of the Persian Empire will give those madmen everything they deserve. And their leader has not acquired a single grain of wisdom! Like a wild animal, he sees nothing but the prey he is after as he storms into the trap set for that very same prey.\" note [Q. Curtius Rufus, History of Alexander 4.13.12ff.]\n\nCoin of Alexander with a lion's skin\n\nSo runs the account of Curtius Rufus, which may be an accurate reflection of the great kings words. The night of 30 September 331 was the beginning of autumn, when the Persians celebrated Mithrakana \u2013 sure enough, by making sacrifices to the sun, to Mithra and to the holy fire. The comparison between Alexander and a \"wild animal\" is also worth noting. In the Persian holy book, the Avesta, the same imagery is used to describe Angra Mainyu, the evil counterpart of Ahuramazda. The personification of evil, he was sometimes described as like a lion, and the Persian king was often depicted fighting a lion. Alexander liked to have an image of himself as Heracles stamped on coins, with a lion's skin over his head. It was natural for Darius, Ahuramazda\u2019s chosen ruler, to compare his enemy to Angra Mainyu.\n\nThe battle of Gaugamela\n\nOur detailed knowledge of events leading up to the battle is mirrored by a lack of information about the engagement itself. We simply have no idea what happened, even though Greek and Roman authors offer detailed descriptions of the advances and manoeuvres that took place on 1 October 331. Their reports amount to saying that Alexander charged at Darius with such energy and terrifying ferocity that he panicked, turned around and thereby put the mass of the Persian army to flight.\n\nMap of the battle of Gaugamela\n\nThe actual course of events was probably rather different. The battleground at Gaugamela was a sandy plain, and the sand they kicked up would have made it impossible for the Macedonians and Persians to see what was happening. After a day of fighting in a dust storm, Alexander's army emerged in control of the field. No one could say how this had come about, although the Macedonians naturally assumed that their plan of attack had proved successful: an advance by the companion cavalry on the right wing, led by Alexander, while Parmenion's left wing and the second line took up defensive positions. There is also firm evidence that at some point Mazaeus' Babylonian horsemen broke through the Macedonian lines, only to take the Macedonian camp instead of attacking the enemy from the rear.\n\nThat evening the victors tried to reconstruct what had happened. They put their victory down to the heroic performance of their young king and to Darius' cowardice. What actually happened lies concealed for ever in the dust clouds of the battlefield, but the Astronomical Diaries do offer some interesting information:\n\nOn the morning of the twenty-fourth of the month of Ul\u00fblu, the king of the world [Alexander] raised his standard [lacuna]. The armies engaged each other and the king\u2019s soldiers suffered a heavy defeat. The troops abandoned their king [Darius] and headed back to their cities. They fled to the lands in the east. note [Astronomical Diaries, -330, obv.15-18. This contradicts the Greek source that is often accepted as the best, Arrian. He says that Darius was the first to turn and run, after which the other Persians followed suit (Anabasis 3.14.3). One way to harmonize these conflicting pieces of information is to render \"The troops abandoned their king\" as \"The king abandoned his troops\". Suspending the rules of grammar, however, will not make Arrian right.]\n\n\"King of the world\" is how the Babylonians translated \"king of Asia\", the title accepted by Alexander. The writer of the Astronomical Diaries had to use this ancient royal title because \"Asia\" was not a concept he recognised. The striking thing about this fragment is that it says Darius was abandoned by his men and not - as Macedonian propaganda would have it - that he let his men down. By \"lands in the east\" the writer means Media, where Darius, just as the Chaldaeans had predicted, found sanctuary and could begin raising his third army.\n\nThe Babylonian account of the engagement, which was written a few days after the battle, makes sense in the light of what had happened in the days leading up to it. Despite Darius' meticulous preparations and the fact that his enemy behaved like a puppet in his hands, his soldiers, many of whom had no combat experience at all, were demoralised and ran away. It is only a slight exaggeration to say that the battle of Gaugamela amounted to an attack on a large group of deserters. It wasn't Alexander's courage or Darius' cowardice that decided the fate of the Persian Empire, it was the signs that were seen in the sky.\n\nThanks\n\nThis was about half a chapter from my book Alexander de Grote.

One of the rivals, a man named Attalus, was put to death by Parmenion, the most important general of Alexander's father Philip II. This was remarkable, because Parmenion was related to Attalus. Alexander owed something to the old general and was forced to do something in return, especially since Parmenion commanded a big army, the vanguard of an expeditionary that the Macedonians had sent against the Achaemenid empire.\n\nAlexander knew what he was expected to do, and in the next years, we find many relatives of Parmenion in key positions in the Macedonian army. For example, his youngest son Nicanor became commander of the infantry regiment that was known as the Shield bearers, his son-in-law Coenus commanded a phalanx battalion, and another Nicanor was admiral of the navy of the Greek allies. Parmenion's friend Amyntas and his brother Asander received other honorable positions. Parmenion himself was Alexander's second in command.\n\nThe most important appointment, however, was that of his oldest son Philotas: he was the commander of the Companion cavalry, a unit of eight squadrons (of 225 horsemen each) that was Macedonia's most effective weapon in any battle. Until then, Philotas had only commanded a cavalry squadron from Upper Macedonia.\n\nIn his new position, Philotas was present at all great battles of Alexander's Persian campaign. Together with his king, he led the cavalry charge at the Granicus river (June 334), he prevented the Persian navy from finding a safe anchorage during the siege of Miletus (Summer 334), and was present at the beginning of the siege of Halicarnassus. During the winter, the Companion cavalry was part of Parmenion's army group, which moved from Sardes to the east along the Royal road, occupying Gordium in the winter.\n\nDuring the great battle of Issus, Alexander successfully used the Companions as a crowbar to create a gap in the Persian lines (November 333) and during the siege of Tyre, he again used Philotas' men during the main charge (July 332). No activities of the regiment are mentioned during the second half of the year, but it is certain that at least one unit was with Alexander when he subdued Egypt. As we will see below, Philotas was also in Egypt. However, he is not mentioned in the accounts of Alexander's famous visit to the oracle of Ammon at Siwa.\n\nThe Persian Gate\n\nThe decisive battle in the war against Persia took place on 1 October 331, at Gaugamela in the north of Mesopotamia. Again, Alexander used the Companion cavalry as a crowbar and again, he was victorious over the Persians (who were demoralized after evil omens). In the last weeks of the year, the Companions were present during the battle at the Persian gate, and in the spring of 330, Alexander used them to pursue the last Achaemenid king of Persia, Darius III Codomannus. When he had been killed, half of Philotas' regiment went to western Hyrcania; it is not clear whether their commander was with them.\n\nPassing through Parthia and Aria, the Macedonians reached Drangiana. By now, many soldiers were discontent. They had been expecting to return home after the fall of the Achaemenid empire and the death of its king. However, they were now forced to march to the east and nobody knew what their king was doing. Moreover, it seemed that Alexander was more and more becoming something of a Persian king himself, something the soldiers did not appreciate. Officers of the old school like Parmenion were sent on honorable missions - but were conspicuously far away from the royal court. These were clear signals that the war was to continue for a long time.\n\nIn December 330, Philotas was accused. He was said to have known of an earlier conspiracy by ordinary Macedonian soldiers who wanted to kill their king, and not to have reported it. This was not the first time that Philotas was accused: something similar had already been brought to Alexander's attention when he was in Egypt. Back then, Alexander had ignored the rumors. This time, however, there was solid evidence that soldiers had attempted to kill the king, and the accusations against Philotas were taken seriously.\n\nAt first, Alexander forgave Philotas, but the next day, the accusations were renewed by the phalanx commanders Craterus and Coenus, Philotas' brother-in-law. It is not known whether they had a secret agenda, but we may be suspicious, now that we see two infantry commanders accusing the leading cavalry commander. During the night, Philotas was arrested. According to Quintus Curtius Rufus, Philotas only said to the king that the bitter hatred of his enemies had triumphed over Alexander's kindness.\n\nAs the army exercised capital jurisdiction in Macedonia, Alexander organized a trial. He accused Philotas and produced an intercepted letter from Parmenion to his son that contained the line \"first of all take care of yourselves and the of your people - that is how we shall accomplish our purpose\". This was no real evidence, but the court found Philotas guilty of conspiracy.\n\nHowever, the precise nature of the conspiracy was still unknown. Hephaestion, Craterus and Coenus declared that torture should be employed to force the truth out of Philotas. He confessed that he and his father had wanted to kill Alexander, whose claim to be a god was scandalous. The plan had been postponed until Darius was dead, because otherwise, the enemy would benefit from it, whereas with the Persian leader removed, Asia and Europe would be the reward of the assassination. The soldiers' conspiracy had offered an excellent opportunity. Having confessed all this, Philotas and a few others were speared or stoned to death. To commemorate the event, Alexander renamed the city where the conspiracies had been detected Prophthasia or Anticipation (modern Far\u00e2h).\n\nIt is not clear what really happened. No ancient author doubts that the first conspiracy was a fact; the problem is the conspiracy of Philotas and Parmenion. The confession of the tortured man can, of course, not be taken as proof that he and his father were really attempting to gain the kingdom. On the other hand, it is strange that Philotas did not report the first conspiracy. It is possible that he wanted to see what happened: if the soldiers' attempt failed, nothing was lost, if it were successful, the army would chose him as its commander and king. But although he had much to gain, the fact that he had a motive does not mean that he really did what he was accused of. We will never known what really happened.\n\nThe consequences of the murder were clear. In the first place, from now on, the Companion cavalry had two commanders, Clitus and Hephaestion. This was a safety measure against too powerful commanders.\n\nIn the second place, the execution of Philotas made the murder of his father Parmenion inevitable. Whether the son had been guilty or not was unimportant: the father was too powerful to stay alive. He was in Ecbatana, where he controlled the road from the Mediterranean to the East, large sums of money and many troops, reinforcements that were delayed. Therefore, Alexander sent an express messenger, whose duty it was to be at Ecbatana before the news of the death of Philotas reached Parmenion. The courier gave letters to the commanders of the reinforcements, and they killed the old general.\n\nLiterature\n\nSabine M\u00fcller, Ma\u00dfnamen der Herrschaftssicherung gegen\u00fcber der makedonischen Opposition bei Alexander dem Gro\u00dfen, 2003 Frankfurt am Main."}]}
