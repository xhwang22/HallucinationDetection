{"Albert I, Margrave of Meissen fought in the Battle of G\u00f6llheim in 1298 and the Battle of Lucka in 1303.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Albert-I-king-of-Germany-and-duke-of-Austria", "page_content": "Albert I, (born c. 1255\u2014died May 1, 1308, Brugg, Switz.), duke of Austria and German king from 1298 to 1308 who repressed private war, befriended the serfs, and protected the persecuted Jews.\n\nThe eldest son of King Rudolf I of the House of Habsburg, Albert was invested with the duchies of Austria and Styria in 1282. After Rudolf\u2019s death (1291), the electors, determined to prevent the German crown from becoming a hereditary possession of the Habsburgs, checked Albert\u2019s aspirations by choosing Adolf of Nassau as German king. Albert, however, drew the electors into an alliance and engineered the deposition (June 23, 1298) of Adolf, who was defeated in battle and slain on July 2, 1298, at G\u00f6llheim.\n\nMore From Britannica Germany: Albert I of Habsburg\n\nAlbert\u2019s election, proclaimed at Mainz before the battle, was repeated at Frankfurt on July 27; he was crowned at Aachen on August 24.\n\nAlbert formed an alliance in 1299 with Philip IV of France against Pope Boniface VIII, who had refused to recognize him as king. He tried to increase the power of his house by claiming (unsuccessfully) possession of Holland, Zealand, and Frisia as vacant fiefs. His pro-French policy and his effort to control the mouths of the Rhine were opposed by the four Rhenish electors, who tried to depose him. Albert, aided by the cities of the Rhineland, crushed the coalition in a series of campaigns between 1300 and 1302. He obtained confirmation of his election from Pope Boniface VIII on April 30, 1303, swore an oath of obedience to the pope, and promised that none of his sons should be elected German king without papal consent. His attempt to place his son Rudolf on the vacant throne of Bohemia in 1306 was only momentarily successful, and his claim to Thuringia and Meissen, inherited from Adolf of Nassau, was checked by a defeat near Lucka in 1307. Albert was assassinated by his nephew John of Swabia, later called the \u201cParricide,\u201d from whom the King had unjustly withheld his inheritance."}, {"url": "https://wiki.alquds.edu/?query=Battle_of_G%C3%B6llheim", "page_content": "Result Habsburg victory\n\nBelligerents\n\nCommanders and leaders\n\nclass=notpageimage| Location within Germany\n\nThe Battle of G\u00f6llheim was fought on 2 July 1298 between the forces of duke Albert I of Habsburg (German: Albrecht) and king Adolf of Nassau following the unilateral decision of the prince electors, without any formal election, to dethrone Adolf and proclaim Albert as king. Adolf died in the battle.[1][2][3]\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nAfter the death of Rudolph I at Germersheim on 15 July 1291, his son Albert I was the most obvious successor to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire. However, Albert's undignified looks (he was known as \"Albert the One-Eyed\", due to an open eye socket from a battle injury) as well as his poor attitude gave the prince electors an excuse not to elect him. The electors did not want a strong king, and Albert, as the son of former king Rudolph I, controlled one of the strongest domestic power bases in the empire, while Adolf was simply a somewhat insignificant Count from the House of Nassau.\n\nAccordingly, at the next Imperial Diet near Frankfurt, Adolf of Nassau-Weilburg (a cousin of one of the electors) was elected, though only after making a number of concessions to the Electors. Although Albert publicly recognized Adolf's election with good grace, he was driven by irreconcilable anger and plotted against him. Further, once king, Adolf of Nassau-Weilburg was determined to forge his own power base and failed to commit to the concessions he had made to get elected. He attempted to seize Thuringia and Meissen from the Wettins.\n\nAs he was regarded as having repeatedly abused his royal prerogatives, the Electors deposed Adolf without any formal electoral process. As a result, Adolf chose to defend his rights as king, and went on campaign against the Habsburgs.[1][4]\n\nBefore this, and following a request of the Elector Archbishop of Mainz, Albert had already begun to move to the Rhine and engage Adolf, who had his own strong army. Albert evaded Adolf's army, which was trying to stop him marching west, near Ulm and again near Breisach. Albert then advanced north through the Upper Rhine valley towards Mainz. Albert's army included contingents from the Habsburg territories, Hungary, Switzerland and those of Henry II, Prince-Bishop of Constance. They met outside the fortified city of Alzey and invested the castle. On arrival, Albert received the news of Adolf's deposition on 23 June 1298.[3]\n\nAdolf approached from the imperial city of Worms, in order to relieve Alzey Castle. His forces consisted of contingents from the Taunus, Adolf's home region, the Electoral Palatinate, Franconia, Lower Bavaria, Alsace and St. Gallen.[2]\n\nBattle [ edit ]\n\nThe King's Cross at the battlefield\n\nAlbert initially avoided a collision, but then on July 2, 1298 deployed his troops in a strategically favorable position on the Hasenb\u00fchl, a hill near G\u00f6llheim. G\u00f6llheim community is located 20 km (12 mi) south of Alzey between Kaiserslautern and Worms, near the Donnersberg massif.[5]\n\nJohannes von Geissel describes the exact course of the battle in his 1835 monograph The Battle of Hasenb\u00fchl and the King's Cross at G\u00f6llheim. The battle was fought in three engagements and lasted from the morning until the early afternoon. The battle remained undecided for many hours and, even after Adolf's death, did it not end immediately. The third engagement proved to be decisive. Adolf, who is said to have rushed to attack, was possibly slain by a Raugrave named Georg. Thereupon a large part of Adolf's army dissolved and fled, others continued to fight until they learnt about Adolf's death. According to Geissel's monograph, 3,000 battle horses perished on the losing side, while the winners fared not much better.[6]\n\nThe result of the battle was generally considered as a judgment of God. Nevertheless, Albert insisted on a formal election by the electors, which took place in Frankfurt on July 27, 1298. As the kingship returned to the Habsburgs, the conflicts of interest between the electors and the king continued.[1][2]\n\nAdolf's widow, Imagina of Isenburg-Limburg, saw her husband's coffin transferred from Rosenthal Abbey to Speyer Cathedral by emperor Henry VII in 1309. There he was buried alongside his rival Albert, who had been murdered in 1308 by his own nephew Johann. Imagina had a memorial cross erected on the battlefield near G\u00f6llheim, which was designed in the early Gothic style. In the 19th century a chapel was built around it, and it has been preserved to this day.[3][7]\n\nReferences [ edit ]"}, {"url": "https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/437421882", "page_content": "Henry III, Margrave of Meissen\n\nMargrave of Meissen\n\nReign 1221\u20131288\n\nPredecessor Theodoric I\n\nSuccessor Albert II\n\nRegent Louis IV of Thuringia (until 1217)\n\nAlbert I of Saxony (until 1230)\n\nMargrave of Lusatia\n\nReign 1221\u20131288\n\nPredecessor Theodoric II\n\nRegent Louis IV of Thuringia (until 1217)\n\nAlbert I of Saxony (until 1230)\n\nLandgrave of Thuringia,\n\nCount Palatine of Saxony\n\nReign 1242\u20131265\n\nPredecessor Henry Raspe\n\nSuccessor Albert II\n\nBorn 1215\n\nMeissen, Duchy of Saxony, Holy Roman Empire\n\nDied 15 February 1288 (aged 72\u201373)\n\nDresden, Duchy of Saxony, Holy Roman Empire\n\nSpouse Constance of Babenberg\n\nAgnes of Bohemia\n\nElisabeth von Maltitz\n\nIssue Albert II, Margrave of Meissen\n\nTheodoric of Landsberg\n\nHouse House of Wettin\n\nFather Theodoric I, Margrave of Meissen\n\nMother Jutta of Thuringia\n\nHenry III, called Henry the Illustrious (Heinrich der Erlauchte) (c. 1215 \u2013 15 February 1288) from the House of Wettin was Margrave of Meissen and last Margrave of Lusatia (as Henry IV) from 1221 until his death; from 1242 also Landgrave of Thuringia.\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\nBorn probably at the Albrechtsburg residence in Meissen, Henry was the youngest son of Margrave Theodoric I, Margrave of Meissen and his wife Jutta, daughter of Landgrave Hermann I of Thuringia. In 1221 he succeeded his father as Margrave of Meissen and Lusatia, at first under guardianship of his maternal uncle, Landgrave Louis IV of Thuringia, and after his death in 1227, under that of Duke Albert I of Saxony. In 1230 he was legally proclaimed an adult.\n\nHenry had his first combat experience in sometime around 1234, while on crusade in Prussia, fighting against the Pomesanians. His pilgrimage and company is well-documented by Peter of Dusburg, and it resulted in the construction of Balga castle, an important administrative centre for the Teutonic http://Knights.In 1245 after many years of conflict with the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg, he was forced to cede the fortresses of K\u00f6penick, Teltow and Mittenwalde north of Lower Lusatia. In 1249 however, the Silesian duke Boles\u0142aw II the Bald granted him the eastern area around Schiedlo Castle at the Oder river, where Henry founded the town of F\u00fcrstenberg.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the struggle between the Hohenstaufen Emperor Frederick II and Pope Gregory IX, Henry took the side of the Emperor. In consideration, Frederick II in 1242 promised him the heritage of Henry Raspe as Landgrave of Thuringia and Count palatine of Saxony. In 1243 the Emperor also betrothed his daughter Margaret of Sicily to Henry's son Albert II.\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry remained a loyal supporter of the Hohenstaufens and not before the departure of Frederick's son Conrad IV from Germany did he recognise the antiking William of Holland. After the death of Henry Raspe in 1247, he enforced his rights in Thuringia by military means in the War of the Thuringian Succession against the claims raised by Sophie of Thuringia, daughter of late Landgrave Louis IV, and her husband Duke Henry II of Brabant, as well as by Prince Siegfried I of Anhalt-Zerbst. After a long drawn-out war he detached the Landgraviate of Hesse in the west and gave it to Sophie's younger son Henry, but kept Thuringia, which he granted to his son Albert II together with the Palatinate of Saxony. The Thuringian acquisition significantly increased the Wettin territorial possessions, which now reached from the Silesian border at the B\u00f3br river in the east up to the Werra in the west, and from the border with Bohemia along the Erzgebirge in the south to the Harz range in the north.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 1273 Henry was an important support to the newly elected Rex Romanorum Rudolph of Habsburg in his struggle against rivaling King Ottokar II of Bohemia. Against Bohemia he won, among other places, Sayda and Purschenstein Castle near Neuhausen,\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was known throughout the whole empire as a glittering prince, famous as a patron of the arts and a model knight, and as a significant minnesinger (not to be confused with Heinrich Frauenlob), poet and composer. Henry was patron of many tournaments and singing competitions, in which he also took part himself, and commissioned the famous Christherre-Chronik. He set to music hymns to be sung in the churches, by express permission of the pope.\n\nFamily\n\nIn 1234 Henry married Constance of Babenberg, the daughter of Duke Leopold VI of Austria. Together they had two sons:\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbert II, Margrave of Meissen (1240\u20131314)\n\nTheodoric of Landsberg (1242\u20131285)\n\nAs early as 1265 he attached the Imperial Pleissnerland around Altenburg, the dowry of his daughter-in-law Margaret, to the Landgraviate of Thuringia and gave both to his elder son Albert II, otherwise Albert the Degenerate. For his younger son Theodoric, Henry had created \u2013 though without imperial consent \u2013 the smaller Margraviate of Landsberg in the western part of the Lusatian lands around Leipzig. Henry kept for himself only the Margraviate of Meissen, the remaining Lower Lusatian lands, and a formal power of oversight. Only domestic disorders, caused by the unworthiness of his son Albert, clouded the later years of his reign and indeed, long after his death in 1288, led to the loss of Lusatia and Thuringia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the death of Constance in 1243 Henry took as his second wife Agnes (d. 1268), a daughter of King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia, and in his third marriage the daughter of a ministerialis, or serving knight, Elisabeth von Maltitz, who bore him Friedrich Clem (whose only daughter Elisabeth married Otto II, Prince of Anhalt-Aschersleben) and Hermann the Long.\n\n\u4ea8\u5229\u4e09\u4e16\n\n\u8fc8\u68ee\u85e9\u4faf\n\n1221-1288\u5e74\n\n\u524d\u4efb \u897f\u5965\u591a\u91cc\u514b\u4e00\u4e16\n\n\u7ee7\u4efb\u8005

and eldest son of German King Rudolph I of Habsburg and Gertrude of Hohenburg .\n\nn dependents compelled Albert to recognize the sovereignty of his rival, and to confine himself for a time to the government of the Habsburg territories.\n\nHe did not abandon his hopes of the throne, however, which were eventually realised. In 1298, he was chosen German king by some of the princes, who were dissatisfied with Adolf. The armies of the rival kings met at the Battle of G\u00f6llheim near Worms, where Adolf was defeated and slain. Submitting to a new election but securing the support of several influential princes by making extensive promises, he was chosen at Frankfurt on the July 27 , 1298 , and crowned at Aachen on August 24 .\n\nAlbert married Elizabeth, daughter of Meinhard II, count of Gorizia and Tyrol , who was a descendant of the Babenberg \"margraves of Austria\" who predated the Habsburgs' rule. The baptismal name Leopold, patron saint margrave of Austria , was given to one of their sons. Elisabeth was in fact better connected to mighty German rulers than her husband: a descendant of earlier kings, for example Emperor Henry IV , she was also a niece of dukes of Bavaria, Austria's important neighbors.\n\nElisabeth bore him seven sons, including Rudolph III of Austria, Frederick I of Austria, Leopold I of Austria, Otto of Austria and Albert II of Austria , and five daughters. Although a hard, stern man, Albert had a keen sense of justice when his own interests were not involved, and few of the German kings possessed so practical an intelligence. He encouraged the cities, and not content with issuing proclamations against private war, formed alliances with the princes in order to enforce his decrees. The serfs, whose wrongs seldom attracted notice in an age indifferent to the claims of common humanity, found a friend in this severe monarch, and he protected even the despised and persecuted Jews. Stories of his cruelty and oppression in the Swiss cantons did not appear until the 16th century, and are now regarded as legendary.\n\nAlbert sought to play an important part in European affairs. He seemed at first inclined to press a quarrel with France over the Burgundian frontier, but the refusal of Pope Boniface VIII to recognize his election led him to change his policy, and, in 1299, he made a treaty with Philip IV of France , by which his son Rudolph was to marry Blanche, a daughter of the French king. He afterwards became estranged from Philip, but in 1303, Boniface recognized him as German king and future emperor; in return, Albert recognized the authority of the pope alone to bestow the imperial crown, and promised that none of his sons should be elected German king without papal consent.\n\nAlbert had failed in his attempt to seize Holland and Zeeland , as vacant fiefs of the Empire, on the death of Count John I in 1299, but in 1306 he secured the crown of Bohemia for his son Rudolph on the death of King Wenceslaus III . He also renewed the claim made by his predecessor, Adolf, on Thuringia , and interfered in a quarrel over the succession to the Hungarian throne. His attack on Thuringia ended in his defeat at Lucka in 1307 and, in the same year, the death of his son Rudolph weakened his position in eastern Europe. His action in abolishing all tolls established on the Rhine since 1250, led the Rhenish archbishops and the count palatine of the Rhine to form a league against him. Aided by the towns, however, he soon crushed the rising.\n\nHe was on the way to suppress a revolt in Swabia when he was murdered on May 1 , 1308 , at Windisch on the Reuss River , by his nephew John of Swabi, afterwards called \"the Parricide\" or \"John Parricida\", whom he had deprived of his inheritance.\n\nFamily and children\n\nHe was married Vienna 20 December 1274 Elisabeth of Tirol , daughter of Count Meinhard II of Gorizia-Tyrol.

He was the younger son of Prince Friedrich Christian of Saxony, Margrave of Meissen and Princess Elisabeth Helene of Thurn und Taxis, and had four siblings:\n\nPrince Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen (1926) \u2013 married Princess Anastasia of Anhalt, no issue\n\nPrincess Maria Josepha (1928) \u2013 unmarried\n\nPrincess Anna (1929) \u2013 married Roberto de Afif, had issue\n\nPrincess Mathilde (1936) \u2013 married Prince Johannes Heinrich of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, had issue\n\nAfter finishing secondary school in Bregenz, Austria, the family moved to Munich where Albert studied history and ethnography at the Ludwig Maximilian University, receiving his Ph.D. in 1961. He worked as a historian, particularly studying the history of the Duchy and then the Kingdom of Saxony and their relationship to Bavaria.\n\nIn a civil ceremony on April 10, 1980 and a religious ceremony two days later at the Theatinerkirche in Munich, Albert married Elmira Henke. She had been his assistant for many years. They had no children.\n\nUpon the death of his elder brother, Maria Emanuel, in July 2012, Albert assumed the Headship of the House of Saxony. This was disputed as Maria Emanuel had named, and adopted, his nephew, Prince Alexander of Saxe-Gessaphe as his rightful heir. (More on the succession dispute below). However, Albert\u2019s role in the dispute was short-lived, as he passed away in Munich just three months later, on October 6, 2012. He is buried in the Old Catholic Cemetery in Dresden along with his wife.\n\nSUCCESSION DISPUTE\n\nHaving no children, in May 1977 Maria Emanuel named his nephew, Prince Alexander of Saxe-Gessaphe, as his heir. Alexander was the son of the Margrave\u2019s eldest sister Anna. A document was drafted and agreed to, and signed by, all the other members of the former royal house. And two years later, in September 1999, Maria Emanuel legally adopted Alexander. However, in 2002, three of the family members retracted their agreement. One of them was Maria Emanuel\u2019s younger brother, Albert, who stated that the headship of the family should eventually pass to Prince R\u00fcdiger \u2013 the son of their late cousin, Prince Timo of Saxony. Despite this disagreement, Maria Emanuel continued to assert that Prince Alexander was his rightful heir. Following his death in July 2012, both Albert and Alexander claimed the headship of the family. When Albert died just three months later, the dispute intensified. Prince R\u00fcdiger claimed that he was the rightful heir, and assumed the title Margrave of Meissen, just as Prince Alexander had done upon Maria Emanuel\u2019s death.\n\nIn 2015, the heads of three Ernestine branches of the House of Wettin \u2013 Michael, Prince of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Andreas, Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and Konrad, Prince of Saxe-Meiningen \u2013 issued a statement stating that they did not recognize Prince Alexander as Head of the House of Saxony, nor as Margrave of Meissen. It is notable that their statement did not specifically recognize Prince R\u00fcdiger either.\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nSaxony Resources at Unofficial Royalty\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

He was a member of the House of Wettin.\n\nHe was the eldest son of Henry the Illustrious, Margrave of Meissen by his first wife, Constantia of Austria.\n\nLife\n\nIn 1265 Margrave Henry III granted the Landgraviate of Thuringia and the Palatinate to Albrecht and the Margraviate of Landsberg in the Osterland to his younger brother Dietrich. Henry III kept for himself the Margraviates of Meissen and Lusatia as a formal power over his sons.\n\nIn June 1255 Albert married Margaret of Sicily, the daughter of Emperor Frederick II, who was also King of Sicily, and Isabella of England. Margaret, also known as Margaret of Schwaben was a sister of Henry Otto, also known as Carlotto. As a dowry the Pleissnerland was pledged to the House of Wettin. Albert and Margaret had five children:\n\nFile:Dresden F\u00fcrstenzug 083.JPG Albert II, Margrave of Meissen (1288\u20131307) and Frederick I, Margrave of Meissen (1307\u20131324); F\u00fcrstenzug, Dresden, Germany\n\nHenry, Lord of Pleissnerland (b. 21 March 1256 - d. 25 January/23 July? 1282), inherited the Pleissnerland in 1274. Frederick (b. 1257 - d. Wartburg, 16 November 1323), Margrave of Meissen. Dietrich, called Diezmann (b. 1260 - murdered Leipzig, 10 December 1307), Margrave of Lusatia. Margaret (b. 1262 - d. young, aft. 17 April 1273). Agnes (b. 1264 - d. September 1332), married before 21 July 1282 to Henry I, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen.\n\nAfter what was at first a happy rule and marriage, Albert turned away from Margaret and began a passionate love affair with Kunigunde of Eisenberg. She bore him two children: a daughter, Elisabeth in 1269,[1] and a son, Albert (\"Apitz\") in 1270.\n\nWhen she discovered the adultery and the illegitimate births, Margaret left Wartburg on 24 June 1270 and went to Frankfurt am Main where she died on 8 August of the same year. The two younger sons, Frederick and Diezmann were looked after by their uncle, Theodoric of Landsberg. Henry, the oldest, disappeared in Silesia in 1282.\n\nAlbert married Kunigunde in 1274 and legitimised their children. When Albert intended to leave the Landgraviate of Thuringia to Apitz and compensate his sons from his first marriage with only the Osterland (which included the inheritance from their mother) and the County Palatine of Saxony, they began a war against their father. Frederick was captured by his father and was locked up in Wartburg castle; however, he escaped one year later and continued the war against his father together with Diezmann. During this time, in 1284, their uncle Theodoric of Landsberg died, and four years later, in 1288, Henry the Illustrious, Albert's father, also died. These deaths heightened the family disputes.\n\nAt the death of his father, Albert became Margrave of Meissen, while his nephew Frederick Tuta - son of Theodoric of Landsberg - inherited the Margraviate of Lusatia, which was sold off by Albert's son Diezmann in 1303. Shortly after, Frederick captured his father Albert in battle. By the Treaty of Rochlitz (1 January 1289), Albert obtained his freedom after the renunciation of large parts of his lands. He retained Meissen for himself, but later sold it to Frederick Tuta. When, after his death (1291) his cousins Frederick and Diezmann arbitrarily took possession of his lands, Albert \u2014suffering financial difficulties\u2014 was compelled to sell Thuringia in 1293 to the German King Adolf of Nassau; in the contract, it was stipulated that the king could take possession of the lands after Albert's death. In the sale, Albert included Meissen and Osterland as his fiefs, despite the fact they were in the hands of his sons. Thanks to this, Adolf's successor Albert I of Habsburg was able to take possession of these lands, claiming that the contract of sale was legitimate and lawful.\n\nKunigunde of Eisenberg died on 31 October 1286. Four years later, on 1 October 1290, Albert married thirdly Elisabeth of Orlam\u00fcnde, heiress of Nordhalben and widow of Hartmann XI of Lobdeburg-Arnshaugk. The same year, Apitz, Albert's son by Kunigunde, was formally legitimized by the Emperor and created Herr of Tenneberg.\n\nOn 11 April 1291 Apitz's younger full-sister, Elisabeth, married Henry III of Frankenstein; the marriage was short-lived and childless.[2] Elisabeth died on 28 September 1293.[3] Three years later (9 October 1296), Apitz married a sister of his brother-in-law Henry III, apparently also called Elisabeth.[4] This marriage, like his sister's, was childless.\n\nFour years later (24 August 1300) Albert's eldest surviving son, Frederick, married Elisabeth of Lobdeburg-Arnshaugk, daughter of his stepmother; this make the final reconciliation between father and son. Five years later (27 June 1305) Apitz of Tenneberg died, aged thirty-five. The death of his favorite son was a terrible blow to Albert. He never recovered from the loss.\n\nTwo years later, in 1307, Albert finally resigned the Landgraviate of Thuringia and the County Palatine of Saxony to his son Frederick in exchange for an annuity.

However, Albert's grotesque appearance (including an open eye socket from battle; hence, \"Albert the One-Eyed\") and his lack of good manner cost him the throne. When the Diet met near Frankfurt the following year, they were discouraged to appoint Albert, thus they elected a cousin of one of the Electors, Adolf of Nassau-Weilburg. Nevertheless, Albert's patience allowed him to recognize Adolf with good grace, while secretly plotting against him. Nearly five years later, Adolf was deposed by the Electors, and Albert anticipated their judgment by killing Adolf face-to-face at the battlefield at G\u00f6llheim.\n\nOnce the battle had commenced, Albert rode his horse through the throng of fighting men until he had found Adolf. Earlier in the battle, Adolf had lost his helmet, thus facing Albert bare-headed. It is said that they exchanged angry words, until Albert pierced his adversary through the chin. Adolf was thrown off his horse, and was butchered by his opponent. It is believed that Albert killed Adolf with a ballock-knife, only to rise from the ground completely stained in Adolf's blood.\n\nAfter the gruesome battle, Albert was reluctantly elected King of the Romans. His electors had good reason to be afraid of Albert, for he is often compared to the biblical King Rehoboam, who often declared to his people, \"My father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions!\""}]}
