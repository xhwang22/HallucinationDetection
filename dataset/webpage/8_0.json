Known as \u2018the Galahad in leathers\u2019 Frith gained a reputation for being a stylish and skilled racer. His accomplishments include winning the 1935 Junior Manx Grand Prix and becoming the first 350cc World Champion.\n\nEarly days\n\nFrith was born in Grimsby in 1909 and came from a well-known stonemason family. He inherited his motorcycle enthusiasm from his dad, even though he started working in the family business. He went on to become a motorbike retailer in his hometown, but he always had a need to be on the road.\n\nRacing career\n\nFrith managed to earn a sponsorship from Nigel Spring, who was part of a family known for owning a jam and curd factory. His first ride occurred in the Isle of Man at the 1930 Manx Grand Prix and he came third. The bike he rode was a 350 cc Velocette KTT. Frith enjoyed major success in 1935 when he won the Junior 350 cc.\n\nThis win inspired him to turn professional and he joined the Norton team in 1936. His success continued when he won the 1936 Junior Tourist Trophy, setting a new race record lap of 81.94 mph. He followed this up with a second place position in the Senior 500 cc race, losing out to Norton teammate Jimmie Guthrie. In 1937, Frith won the Senior TT, becoming the first man to lap the course at over ninety miles per hour.\n\nFrith served at the Infantry Driving & Maintenance School stationed in Keswick during WW2. He was set to participate in the 1947 TT, only to suffer a crash at Ballacraine during practice, dislocating his right shoulder. This stopped him from racing, but he came back strong in 1948 and won the Junior race in the European championship.\n\nIn 1949, the Moto GP was created and it became Frith\u2019s most successful season. He went on to win every round in the Junior class, including the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy and became the first 350 cc World Champion.\n\nAt the end of the season, Frith retired, winning his final race at the Ulster Grand Prix. In 1950, he received royal honours, being awarded the OBE for his service to motorcycle racing.\n\nVery few racers can claim to go out on the top of their career, but Frith was happy with the success that he\u2019d earned. He passed away in 1988, having lived a satisfying life."}, {"url": "https://dbpedia.org/page/Freddie_Frith", "page_content": "dbo: abstract \u0641\u0631\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0641\u0631\u064a\u062b (\u0628\u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u062c\u0644\u064a\u0632\u064a\u0629: Freddie Frith)\u200f \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u062a\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0642 \u062f\u0631\u0627\u062c\u0627\u062a \u0646\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0625\u0646\u062c\u0644\u064a\u0632\u064a \u0641\u0627\u0632 \u0628\u0628\u0637\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0633\u0628\u0627\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0626\u0632\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u0631\u0649 \u0644\u0644\u062f\u0631\u0627\u062c\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629. \u0646\u0627\u0641\u0633 \u0641\u064a \u0633\u0628\u0627\u0642\u0627\u062a \u0628\u0637\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0644\u0641\u0626\u0629 500 \u0633\u064a \u0633\u064a \u0648\u0644\u0641\u0626\u0629 350 \u0633\u064a \u0633\u064a \u0648\u0644\u0641\u0626\u0629 50 \u0633\u064a \u0633\u064a. \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0634\u0627\u0631\u0643 \u0641\u064a \u0643\u0623\u0633 \u062c\u0632\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u0627\u062d\u064a\u0629.

He also won the Dutch TT and the Belgian and Swiss GPs, and did not need to compete in the sixth and last race of the season (the Italian Grand Prix at Monza) having already won the Championship with maximum points.\n\n\n\nWinning the 350cc class of the FIM's inaugural World Championship was the pinnacle of Freddie Frith's career and he subsequently retired (he was by then 40 years old). He was honoured with an OBE by King George VI at the end of the year for 'services to British motorcycle racing' and 'British prestige' in general.\n\n\n\nThe works Velocettes of the late 1940s were based on the latest version of the company's immensely successful over-the-counter KTT racer: the MkVIII. With its deep petrol tank, massively finned overhead-camshaft engine and purposeful appearance, the MkVIII KTT is unquestionably one of the most beautiful racing motorcycles ever made. The talking point of Velocette's new racer on its introduction in 1939 was its swinging-arm rear suspension, an innovation first seen on the works bikes in 1936. By now tried and tested, the Velocette rear suspension comprised a pivoting fork made from tapered tubing and complemented by a pair of Dowty Oleomatic air-sprung struts. The rest of the cycle parts remained much as those of the rigid-framed MkVII.\n\n\n\nThe production Mk VIII's original engine, while basically the same as its MkVII predecessor's, incorporated a number of improvements intended to enhance power and reliability. The big-end bearing assembly had already been strengthened (after some failures on the earlier model) and despite the springer's increase in weight over the rigid machine, its superior performance and excellent handling made the MkVIII KTT a formidable competitor. Indeed, the production version differed little from the factory bikes that had dominated the 1938 Isle of Man Junior TT, Stanley Woods leading home team-mate Ted Mellors to break Norton's seven-year stranglehold on the event. Woods repeated his win the following year.\n\n\n\nDespite its pre-war design origins, the Nigel Spring-entered MkVIII KTT had proved good enough to provide Freddie Frith and Velocette with the 1948 Junior TT; however, in order to win the 350cc World Championship in 1949, a complete redesign of the valve gear was considered necessary. Velocette had first experimented with a double-overhead-camshaft (DOHC) cylinder head on the KTT-based factory bikes back in 1936 (courtesy of chief designer Charles Udall). The post-war revisit of the DOHC concept however, was instigated by Bertie Goodman, only son of company boss, Percy.\n\n\n\nThe principal advantage of the DOHC motor was its lighter and better-controlled valve gear, which enabled it to rev safely at 8,000rpm, as against the 7,200rpm maximum of the single-cam 'rocker' engines (though the latter were preferred at some circuits on account of their greater low-down torque). At 74mm x 81mm, the bore and stroke were the same as the standard KTT, but the DOHC 'double knocker' (an original term coined by team manager Harold Willis in the mid-1930s) differed considerably in its detail design. Special machined-all-over forged pistons were used while, in anticipation of higher revs, the exhaust valve was sodium-filled to dissipate heat. The post-war DOHC engines were also fitted with larger-than-standard Oldham couplings while at the same time (and for the same reason) the valve gear's vertical drive-shaft was waisted. As usual, there was the additional oil scavenge pump in the lower end of the timing cover, a normal practice on works machines, in an effort to minimise oil drag on the spinning crankshaft. For the first time since before the war there was extensive use of Elektron magnesium alloy and also, as with most of the Velocette TT and Grand Prix machines, larger capacity fuel tanks.\n\n\n\nAs well as being original thinkers, Velocette were masters of both chassis and engine development. After what can only be described as a very short 'teething' period, the engines were immediately producing significantly more power than the 'single-knockers' but with the - almost luxurious - added benefit of a turbine-smooth power delivery. On the circuit they were extremely quick, and Bertie's attention to detail clearly helped achieve this (as a good example, individual camshafts were carefully balanced with special counter-weights so as to avoid vibration within the gear trains). As with all the factory racers, a very large cylinder barrel was employed to improve cooling. In addition, to assist when climbing Snaefell Mountain at the Isle of Man TT, a batch of special gearboxes was produced, in Elektron magnesium alloy, employing modified internal ratios as used on the pre-war works machines.\n\n\n\nAccording to works mechanic Frank Panes' notes, '1046' was one of two experimental 350cc DOHC engines produced from scratch for the 1949 season. Bertie himself later stated that in total, six 350cc DOHC engines had been produced by the factory after the war (some having been converted from the earlier single-knocker works motors).\n\n\n\nWith most of Velocette Ltd's limited financial resources committed to developing the forthcoming LE model, the post-war racing effort was bankrolled by Castrol and supported by several dealers together with private entrants Nigel Spring and Dick Wilkins. Factory records show that the KTTs, which were to be ridden by Freddie Frith and Ken Bills, were invoiced to Nigel Spring on 20th May 1948 and delivered via the Premier Motor Company of Birmingham. Frith's machine was numbered 'SF114' (frame) and 'KTT 954' (engine), while Bills' was numbered 'SF129' and 'KTT 956' respectively. Interviewed by Motor Cycling in February 1948, Spring remarked that he had expected a couple of standard MkVIII KTTs, but was delighted to hear that Veloce had decided to build a limited number of special models, with 'hotted-up' engines. As works supported riders, Frith and Bills enjoyed the advantages of these special engines that had been modified by the factory. In the same Motor Cycling article, Bertie Goodman confirmed that four of these special KTTs had been made: two for the Spring \u00e9quipe, and one each for Bob Foster and David Whitworth.\n\n\n\nR M N Spring was proprietor of a preserves manufacturer ('Spring's Delights') based in Brigg, Lincolnshire where it operated a large fruit processing plant. He was also a pre-war Brooklands competitor, race winner, world record holder, tuner, and sponsor, so knew a thing or two about racing motorcycles. Another Lincolnshire man, and one of the few riders to win Isle of Man TT's both before and after the war, Freddie Frith first came to prominence in 1930 when he rode a Velocette to 3rd place in the inaugural Manx Grand Prix's Junior race. In 1935 he won the Junior Manx GP on a Norton, a ride that earned him a place in Bracebridge Street's works team for '36. Freddie Frith was an instant success at the higher level, winning the 1936 Junior TT and the Senior TT in 1937, during which he became the first man to lap the Mountain Course at over 90mph.\n\n\n\nHaving spent the war years as an Army motorcycle instructor, he was tempted back into the saddle in 1947 at the age of 38 but did not compete in that year's TT following a spill in practice on a Senior Moto-Guzzi. He joined the Spring stable for 1948, and the rest, as they say, is history. A quiet, modest man, referred to consistently by all as a 'real gentlemen' Freddie Frith retired at the end of the 1949 season and opened a motorcycle dealership in Grimsby, which traded successfully for many years. He died in 1988 aged 78 and is still remembered fondly in Lincolnshire as one of the county's greatest sporting heroes.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the 1949 season, the special DOHC engines that had been on loan to Spring were returned to the factory, while the rest of the Frith Velocette, being Spring's personal property, was retained by him. (Apparently, at some point, possibly after being sold to a private owner, it was fitted with a standard KSS engine and used on the road).\n\n\n\nVelocette's exceedingly fast DOHC 350s raced on into 1950, Bob Foster winning the World Championship for the second year in succession for Hall Green, and these advanced engines were so good that they continued to be reused in more up-to-date cycle parts as development progressed. Fitted into lightweight 'low-boy' frames in 1951, they were once again raced by Foster (now in his final year) as well as up-and-coming new team members Cecil Sandford and Bill Lomas, whose machine ended up being fitted with the ex-Frith engine, 'L.IOM 68560.1046'.\n\n1951 would turn out to be the swansong of the full Velocette race team (in 1952 Veloce Ltd were only to enter a single rider - Les Graham - in international events) and the race shop was closed down soon afterwards.\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, but as is so often the case with obsolescent racing machines, the works Velocettes were dismantled and the major components dispersed, their historic identities being lost in the short term. The special magnesium DOHC engines, which still retained the promise of a useful life, were all sold to private owners, and 'L.IOM 68560.1046' eventually found itself recycled into the Reynolds-framed Velocette originally built for Geoff Duke. This came about because the Duke Reynolds Velocette had been acquired as a rolling chassis by the Australian Hinton Brothers, minus its original single-knocker engine. As the Hinton's also by now owned the ex-Lomas low-boy works Velocette, they wasted no time in transferring the ultra-quick ex-Frith motor, 'L.IOM 68560.1046', into the Duke machine.\n\n\n\nHaving gone down separate paths for so many years, frame and engine have now been reunited, and the ex-Frith 350cc motor, having changed hands a multitude of times in the intervening years, has been rebuilt by the world's leading authority on the Velocette marque. Since the rebuild's completion, this beautiful historic Velocette has been ridden on the Isle of Man TT Parade Lap, at the Assen Classic TT, and at the Goodwood Festival of Speed. Presented in sound order, this turbine-smooth, docile yet exceptionally fast motorcycle is ready to parade or even race. Accompanying documentation consists of period photographs, copies of factory records, Velocette Owners Club works record extract, engine specification details, and various magazine articles.\n\n\n\nExceptional motorcycles with important race history seldom come to market, let alone ultra-rare factory racers such as that offered here, so this multiple Grand Prix-winning works DOHC KTT, originally ridden to such success by one of the sport's most iconic World Champions, represents a unique opportunity, of enormous significance for collectors, to own a genuine World Championship-winning Velocette."}, {"url": "https://www.calendarz.com/on-this-day/may/30/freddie-frith", "page_content": "Birth\n\nMay, 30\n\nFreddie Frith\n\nFreddie Frith, English motorcycle road racer (d. 1988)\n\nFrederick Lee Frith OBE (30 May 1909 \u2013 24 May 1988 Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England) was a British Grand Prix motorcycle road racing world champion. A former stonemason and later a motor cycle retailer in Grimsby, he was a stylish rider and five times winner of the Isle of Man TT. Frith was one of the few to win TT races before and after the Second World War."}, {"url": "https://www.lincolnshirelife.co.uk/heritage/motorcycling-heroes/", "page_content": "Austin Munks and Freddie Frith were both at the very top of their chosen sport of motorcycle racing either side of World War Two.\n\nThey were both born during the same year, 1909, with Austin coming from Leverton in the south of the county and Freddie from Grimsby in the north. Although Austin remained an amateur throughout his career, Freddie was to turn professional, with outstanding success. Later in their lives they both proved to be successful businessmen.\n\nAustin was the youngest son of Mr and Mrs A E Munks, and his father was blacksmith of the Highgate. He was obviously always interested in speed, and started racing locally on grass and at proper hard tracks, Donington Park being the nearest. His first Isle of Man Manx Grand Prix victory came in 1933, when he won the Junior (350cc) on a Velocette \u2013 he had finished third in the Junior class on his Velocette the previous year. Three years later, in 1936, he was the first man ever to win the double, the Junior and the Senior (500cc) on Velocette and Norton machines respectively. After the war, in 1947, Austin was to secure his final Manx Grand Prix victory, winning the Lightweight class (250cc) on a Moto Guzzi, with an average speed of seventy miles per hour, setting a new record lap of 72.54mph.\n\nAustin was not only interested in motorcycle racing, flying aircraft was another of his passions. He learned to fly and obtained his pilot\u2019s licence in 1933. He owned his own aircraft, and flew it from a strip belonging to the Bowser family at Hurn End. He became friendly with Alex Henshaw CBE, a former test pilot, and they both used this strip.\n\nAustin was to suffer a terrible shooting accident during October 1935. While he was out with an organised shoot at Asterby, one stray pellet was to hit him in his left eye, causing him to lose his sight from that eye. But this setback obviously did not slow down his racing brain, and he went on to notch up his remarkable double Manx Grand Prix wins the following year. After this he retired from racing, and of course the outbreak of the Second World War was soon to follow.\n\nWhen the hostilities ceased he was to get itchy feet again and have a crack at the race he had previously not won on the Isle of Man, the lightweight class of the Manx Grand Prix. So he bought a motorcycle of Italian manufacture, a Moto Guzzi, and the only way he could get it back was to fly to Italy himself. So off to Milan he flew in his Auster aircraft and picked up the dismantled machine \u2013 a good story he could surely tell about that experience. The machine was re-assembled by his very good friend and mechanic, Sammy Coupland of Frithville, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nAfter this he did finally retire from racing, and he was to sponsor a couple of local lads who were to make names for themselves in the sport. First it was R H (Dickie) Dale, from Wyberton. Dickie went on to win the following year\u2019s Lightweight Manx Grand Prix (1948) on the same machine, Austin\u2019s Motto Guzzi, setting an average speed of 73.36mph, and a new record lap of 74.36 in the process. Dickie was to go on and enjoy a successful career in the sport riding first for the Norton works team, then followed by spells in various continental teams, including Gilera, Benelli, MV Agusta, BMW, and Moto Guzzi (where he was especially noted for his rides on the 500cc V8 model) teams. Unfortunately he was to lose his life after a crash at the Nurburgring, Germany, in 1961.\n\nDickie was followed by Bernard Codd from Wrangle, who still farmed there until his recent death last July. Starting in trials riding, he also proved to be successful in the Isle of Man. Winning the Clubman\u2019s Tourist Trophy double (350 and 500cc), he was the only man to achieve this unique double, during the last year these classes were held, 1956.\n\nHe was certainly a force to be reckoned with on the short circuit scene in this country. A serious crash at Crystal Palace the following year ended a very promising career. Unfortunately, he suffered a serious break to his right leg, and was bed bound for a year. The latest technology for treating such injuries had not reached these parts of the country in those days.\n\nFrederick Lee (Freddie) Frith, was born in Grimsby, into a reputable monumental and stonemason family. Like his father, who was a keen motorcyclist, he had the urge for speed. He was to enjoy the sponsorship of Nigel Spring, of the Spring family from Brigg \u2013 famous for their jam and curd factory.\n\nFrom 1936 until the outbreak of World War II he rode works machines provided by the Norton factory, and later, Velocette. He always held the reputation of being a very stylish rider, and gained such quotes from the press of the day as \u2018chivalrous\u2019 and \u2018the Galahad in leathers\u2019. His first ride in the Isle of Man was in the 1930 Manx Grand Prix, in which he was to finish third in the Junior race on a Velocette. His first win came in 1935, when he won the Junior (350cc) race \u2013 he had previously finished second to Austin in the 1933 Junior. The following year he turned professional and joined the works Norton team, with immediate success. He won, on his first attempt, the 1936 Junior Tourist Trophy, setting a new race record, and record lap at 81.94mph, making him the first man to lap the famous course at over eighty miles per hour for the Junior class. And he followed this up with a second place in the Senior (500cc) to his Norton teammate, Jimmie Guthrie. Later that season he was to go on to win the Junior (350cc class) European championship. The 1937 senior TT was to be a memorable race for Freddie; not only did he win it, but he was the first rider ever to lap the famous TT course at over ninety miles per hour (90.27mph) on his works Norton. By this time the German and Italian supercharged machines were becoming a real threat to the British manufacturers in the European championships, with George Meier winning both the 1938 and 1939 Senior class on his BMW. The 1939 Ulster Grand Prix was the last race before the Second World War intervened. In this Freddie finished second in the Senior class on his Norton, to Italian, Dorino Serafini, who was Gilera mounted.\n\nDuring the war Freddie served in the army, at the infantry driving and maintenance school at Keswick, reaching the rank of sergeant. At the first TT after the war in 1947, Freddie had secured a ride on a Moto Guzzi in the senior class. But he was to suffer a crash at Ballacraine during practice, dislocating his right shoulder, and was unable to race. In the 1948 season Freddie was back on British machinery, this time Velocette. He went on to win the Junior class in the European championship that year.\n\nIn 1949 the World Championships, now known as Moto GP, was born. There were four classes for solo machines, 125cc Ultra-Lightweight, 250cc Lightweight, 350cc Junior and 500cc Senior, and one for 600cc sidecars. It was to turn out for Freddie to be his most successful season. He went on to win every round in the Junior class, including the Isle Of Man Tourist Trophy and became the first ever 350cc World Champion. He was to retire at the end of that season, winning his final race at the Ulster Grand Prix, and setting a new record lap speed of 90.60mph in the process. When Royal honours were announced the following year (1950), Freddie was honoured for his efforts, by being awarded the OBE for his services to the sport. This made him the first person ever to receive a Royal honour for motorcycling. Geoff Duke was the next to follow him, and receive the same honour.\n\nBoth Austin and Freddie were able to prove, beyond their motorcycling endeavours, that they could run successful businesses. Austin ran his motor garage at Leverton Highgate from the 1930s and was soon to obtain the very successful Jaguar car agency. He was later to add Daimler and later still Austin/Rover to the list. On his death on 29th January 1981, he left the business to his workers. He also had a collection of vintage motorcycles, his favourite being a 1939 Brough Superior. It was later sold at a Bonham\u2019s sale to an American collector for \u00a342,200, well above the \u00a330\u201335,000 estimate.\n\nFreddie also owned his own successful business, a motorcycle sales and repair outlet, run from the family\u2019s original stonemason premises in Victoria Street, Grimsby, now unfortunately demolished. He was the agent for various leading manufacturers, including BMW, and was very successful for many years. He died on 24th May 1988.\n\nThese two true gentlemen have both been great ambassadors for their chosen sport and the county of Lincolnshire. We can only guess at what might have happened if the war had not interrupted their respective careers, but they have both left us with their own unique memories. The famous (or infamous) Isle of Man TT course certainly held no fears for either of these two intrepid Lincolnshire yellowbellies.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nThe Story of the Manx G S Davison (The TT.
