Already a success in Latin America, Feliciano scored a major American hit with his 1968 cover of the Doors' \"Light My Fire,\" before inciting controversy with his jazzy rendition of \"The Star Spangled Banner\" during the World Series in October of that year. His 1970 Christmas pop classic \"Feliz Navidad\" went on to become one of the most ubiquitous songs in the holiday canon. Throughout the '70s and '80s, he remained a popular touring and recording artist, releasing a variety of Spanish- and English-language albums, guesting on albums by major artists like John Lennon, Joni Mitchell, and Bill Withers, and composing for television shows like Chico and the Man and Kung Fu. Feliciano's success extended into the next century as he continued to explore a variety of musical styles, earning a pair of Grammy Awards for his 2008 album Se\u00f1or Bachata and recording a high-profile collaboration with Jools Holland on the 2017 jazz and R&B set, As You See Me Now. In the seventh decade of his career, he was still in demand, releasing a pair of albums in 2022, Right Here Waiting and Love & Christmas.\n\nFeliciano was born September 10, 1945, in Lares, Puerto Rico; the victim of congenital glaucoma, he was left permanently blind at birth. Five years later, he and his family moved to New York City's Spanish Harlem area; there Feliciano began learning the accordion, later taking up the guitar and making his first public appearance at the Bronx's El Teatro Puerto Rico at the age of nine. While in high school he became a fixture of the Greenwich Village coffeehouse circuit, eventually quitting school in 1962 in order to accept a permanent gig in Detroit; a contract with RCA followed a performance at New York's Gerde's Folk City, and within two years, he appeared at the Newport Jazz Festival. After bowing with the 1964 novelty single \"Everybody Do the Click,\" he issued his flamenco-flavored debut LP The Voice and Guitar of Jose Feliciano, trailed early the next year by The Fantastic Feliciano.\n\nUnhappy with the direction of his music following the release of 1966's A Bag Full of Soul, Feliciano returned to his roots, releasing three consecutive Spanish-language LPs -- Sombras...Una Voz, Una Guitarra, Mas Exitos de Jose Feliciano, and Sentimiento, La Voz y La Guitarra -- on RCA International, scoring on the Latin pop charts with the singles \"La Copa Rota\" and \"Amor Gitana.\" With 1968's Feliciano!, he scored a breakthrough hit with a soulful reading of the Doors' \"Light My Fire\" that launched him into the mainstream pop stratosphere; a smash cover of Tommy Tucker's R&B chestnut \"Hi Heel Sneakers\" solidified his success, and soon Feliciano found himself performing the national anthem during the 1968 World Series in Detroit. His idiosyncratic Latin jazz performance of the song proved highly controversial, and despite the outcry of traditionalists and nationalists, his status as an emerging counterculture hero was secured, with a single of his rendition also becoming a hit.\n\nIn 1969, Feliciano recorded three LPs -- Souled, Alive Alive-O!, and 10 to 23 -- and won a Grammy for Best New Artist, though it was his self-titled 1970 Christmas album that yielded his most enduring original song. \"Feliz Navidad,\" his Latin pop holiday hit, went on to become a perennial Christmas staple for decades to come and has been widely covered by other artists. Throughout the remainder of the '70s, Feliciano remained an active performer, touring annually and issuing a number of LPs in both English and Spanish, including 1973's Steve Cropper-produced Compartments; he also appeared on the Joni Mitchell hit \"Free Man in Paris,\" and guested on a number of television series including Kung Fu and McMillan and Wife. He also wrote the theme song for the sitcom Chico and the Man, which edged into the Top 100 singles chart in 1974.\n\nIn 1980, Feliciano was the first performer signed to the new Latin division of Motown, making his label debut with an eponymous effort the following year. His recorded output tapered off during the course of the decade, although he occasionally resurfaced with LPs including 1987's Tu Inmenso Amor and 1989's I'm Never Gonna Change. A school in East Harlem was renamed the Jose Feliciano Performing Arts School in his honor. In 1996, he also appeared briefly in the hit film Fargo and in 2000 received the Grammy Legend Award. A handful of Spanish-language albums appeared in the early part of the decade and in 2006, Feliciano returned with the instrumental Six-String Lady album, kicking off a prolific run that saw a steady stream of releases well into the 2010s. His highest-profile project during this period was a 2017 duet album with Jools Holland called As You See Me Now. Heading into the next decade, Feliciano reunited with longtime producer Rick Jarrard for 2020's Behind This Guitar, his first album to be recorded in Nashville. The album shared its title with a documentary about Feliciano, which began playing the film festival circuit in 2020. In 2022, Feliciano received the Legend Award at the Billboard Latin Music Awards; he was the first artist to receive the honor. It was a busy year that saw two releases from the veteran artist. Right Here Waiting was a set of classic tunes that included new recordings of \"Light My Fire\" and the theme from Chico and the Man. Later in the year, he issued Love & Christmas, a seven-song EP that included a pair of holiday songs (\"Viva La Navidad\" and \"Little Drummer Boy\") as well as a Latin-flavored cover of Jimi Hendrix's \"Purple Haze\" and a Spanish-language version of Michael Jackson's \"Human Nature.\""}, {"url": "https://magazine.columbia.edu/article/famous-musicians-who-graduated-columbia", "page_content": "From left: Ryan, Jack, and Adam Met of AJR.\n\nAJR\n\nBrothers Adam, Jack, and Ryan Met began making music together while growing up in New York City.

And while there are hundreds of talented and successful artists out there, very few will end up doing all of that. Most will have a hit or two, and many may even achieve a string of successful albums, but few will change the course of popular music or pave a new path for those who follow.\n\nBut of course, there have been a handful of modern musicians who have done that. Stacker has rounded up the 50 most successful musical artists of all time. These folks have been trailblazers and icons. They've sold millions of albums and singles, performed countless live shows, and even invented new genres.\n\nIn order to come up with this list, Stacker looked at data from both the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the Grammy Awards. The RIAA gives out certifications based on the number of albums and singles an artist has sold. Gold albums have sold 500,000 copies; platinum albums have sold 1,000,000 copies; multi-platinum have sold 2,000,000 (with increments of 1,000,000 thereafter), and diamond albums have sold 10,000,000 copies. Stacker then came up with an index to rank each artist that takes into account the total number of RIAA certified units (70%), Grammy wins (20%), and Grammy nominations (10%). Additionally, to be considered for this story, artists must have sold 10 million RIAA certified units.\n\nSome artists found on the list are predictable, like Michael Jackson and The Beatles, while others might be more surprising, like Eminem and Kenny G.

BTS finish ahead of last year's winner Taylor Swift.\n\nThe award from the international trade body for the recording industry comes after a thunderously successful year for BTS, who scored multiple accolades for their Map Of The Soul: 7 album, which reached Number 1 in more than 20 countries, including the Official UK Albums Chart.\n\nThe group's 2020 single Dynamite - their first ever recorded fully in English - topped the charts in the US and became their biggest UK hit to date at Number 3, as well as smashing YouTube and Spotify records.\n\nBTS rounded off 2020 with the release of BE (Deluxe Edition), a response to the global pandemic that hit Number 1 in over ten countries, and landed at Number 2 in the UK.\n\nFrances Moore, CEO of the IFPI, said: \u201cBTS are a global phenomenon. They have had another outstanding year, releasing three albums, and continually finding creative and engaging ways to share their story with the world. They truly show the power that music has to bring joy and happiness to people the world over.\n\n\u201cWe would like to congratulate RM, Jin, SUGA, j-hope, Jimin, V and Jung Kook and we are excited to see what they have in store next.\u201d\n\nBehind BTS on this year's Global Artist Top 10 are two-time winners Taylor Swift and Drake, who both finish in top three for the fourth time in the last five years.\n\nMeanwhile, The Weeknd takes fourth place after landing the biggest song of 2020 with Blinding Lights, and Billie Eilish celebrates a second consecutive year in the Top 5.\n\nIFPI Top 10 Global Recording Artists of 2020\n\n1.

Live albums captured legendarily loud bands like The Who and The Ramones in their natural element. Once obscure regional acts like Bob Seger, KISS and Cheap Trick exploded into the mainstream with live albums. The Band, The Stooges, and Velvet Underground put their final gigs on vinyl. Jimi Hendrix, Neil Young (as his ongoing archive series shows), and Jackson Browne recorded entire sets of new songs onstage. The Grateful Dead released several official live albums (and continue to do so) that only made fans want to bootleg shows on their own more.\n\nWith the 50th anniversary of a landmark live album, The Allman Brothers Band At Fillmore East, coming up on July 6, here\u2019s a look back at the best of the best of the decade of decadence. This list only features albums recorded and released during the 1970s \u2013 which is to say the various live albums recorded at Woodstock and released in the \u201870s aren\u2019t included, nor are more recent releases that feature archival recordings from the \u201870s.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of live albums in the last few decades, but they never mattered quite as much as they did in the \u201870s.\n\n50. The Velvet Underground \u2013 Live At Max\u2019s Kansas City (1972)\n\nIn the summer of 1970, The Velvet Underground recorded Loaded and played a legendary nine-week residency at Max\u2019s Kansas City in New York, with Lou Reed quitting the band before the final show. The band still owed Atlantic Records another album on their contract after releasing Loaded, and instead of keeping the Doug Yule-led group on for their next studio album, the notorious Squeeze (which doesn\u2019t include Reed, is hated by many fans and not considered a true VU album by others), the label opted to release a recording of the last VU show with Reed. It\u2019s a polished set with some fairly uptempo renditions of VU\u2019s avant-rock classics, with Yule\u2019s brother Billy sitting in on drums for a pregnant Moe Tucker. Reed opens the proceedings by describing \u201cI\u2019m Waiting for the Man\u201d as \u201ca tender folk song from the early \u201850s about love between man and subway.\u201d Live At Max\u2019s Kansas City also marked the first release of the original \u201cSweet Jane\u201d bridge that had been edited out of the release of Loaded.\n\n49. Janis Joplin \u2013 In Concert (1972) *\n\nTwo years after Janis Joplin\u2019s death, Columbia Records assembled a double album of her legendary live performances. One LP featured the band she rose to fame with (Big Brother and the Holding Company) and the other included the band she recorded her final studio album, Pearl, (with Full Tilt Boogie Band). A few tracks on the first half were recorded in 1968 (hence the asterisk to our all-\u201870s rule) and the audio quality on some of the recordings are a little low, but the electricity of Joplin\u2019s performances shines through.\n\n48. Elvis Presley \u2013 Having Fun with Elvis On Stage (1974)\n\nOne of the most infamous live albums of the \u201870s is barely music at all. In the King of Rock and Roll\u2019s less profitable final years, his manager, Col. Tom Parker, came up with the incorrect theory that he could self-release an album of Elvis Presley\u2019s stage banter from concerts without violating the singer\u2019s RCA contract if it didn\u2019t contain any songs. The result is a bizarre, disjointed series of vignettes where Presley jokes with the audience and tells stories, occasionally humming or breaking into a melodic \u201cwell\u2026\u201d to lead into a song. His most appropriate comment comes early on the album with \u201cBy the time the evening\u2019s over I will have made a complete total fool of myself.\u201d Once RCA caught on to Parker\u2019s ruse, they re-released Having Fun with Elvis on Stage and it actually charted, but an embarrassed Presley asked them to withdraw the release, sealing its fate as a campy black market curio.\n\n47. Ted Nugent \u2013 Double Live Gonzo! (1978)\n\nFew multi-platinum artists of the 1970s feel so distinctly of their time as Ted Nugent. Although cock rock has flourished in many decades, only in the \u201870s could a guy in a loincloth calling himself the \u201cMotor City Madman\u201d have sold millions of records wielding his guitar like a phallus on songs with titles like \u201cYank Me, Crank Me\u201d and \u201cWang Dang Sweet Poontang.\u201d Even the hair bands of the \u201880s seem subtle by comparison. For better or worse, Double Live Gonzo! is a perfect distillation of the Nugent phenomenon, a collection of bawdy anthems recorded in seven different cities, which he\u2019d attempt to top with 1981\u2019s Intensities in 10 Cities.\n\n46. Jimmy Smith \u2013 Root Down (1972)\n\nBefore Jimmy Smith, the Hammond B-3 Organ was a curiosity that was sold to churches as a smaller, cheaper alternative to a pipe organ. After Jimmy Smith\u2019s run of albums with Verve Records in the \u201860s and \u201870s, the B-3 was established as a jazz staple, although nobody wielded it as a lead instrument quite like him. Root Down, recorded in Smith\u2019s own L.A. supper club, the Bombay Bicycle Club, is a supremely funky set of soul-jazz best known for the title track that was sampled by several hip hop acts, including the Beastie Boys\u2019 1994 hit also titled \u201cRoot Down.\u201d\n\n45. Dolly Parton \u2013 A Real Live Dolly (1970)\n\nApril 25th, 1970 was the second annual Dolly Parton Day in the singer\u2019s hometown, Sevierville, Tennessee, so Parton held a benefit concert at her alma mater, Sevier County High School, to raise money for scholarships and musical instruments for students. Then, she turned the local performance into her first live album. Her irrepressible charm was on full display as she runs through early hits like \u201cDumb Blonde\u201d and \u201cMy Blue Ridge Mountain Boy\u201d before being joined by her mentor and frequent duet partner Porter Wagoner. She also performed what would become her signature song a year later, \u201cCoat of Many Colors,\u201d but the performance would remain unreleased until a 2009 reissue.\n\n\n\n44. Led Zeppelin \u2013 The Song Remains the Same (1976)\n\nLed Zeppelin were one of the biggest live draws of the 1970s, breaking attendance records held by The Beatles, but the concert film and live album they released during the decade doesn\u2019t quite match their stature. The 1973 shows at Madison Square Garden weren\u2019t exceptional by the band\u2019s standards, Robert Plant\u2019s \u201cDoes anyone remember laughter?\u201d ad-lib during \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d became a notoriously campy moment of self-parody. But there are moments of arena rock majesty, particularly an iconic rendition of \u201cDazed and Confused\u201d that featured Jimmy Page playing an otherworldly guitar solo with a violin bow. The album remained the definitive live Zep document until the 2003 release of the superior 1972 recording, How the West Was Won.\n\n\n\n43. Fela Ransome-Kuti and The Africa \u201970 With Ginger Baker \u2013 Live! (1971)\n\nGinger Baker was one of the most famous drummers in the world after the breakup of his \u201860s Eric Clapton-based supergroups, Cream and Blind Faith. Baker spent much of the \u201870s seeking out music beyond rock and jazz around the world, making the documentary Ginger Baker in Africa setting up a recording studio in Nigeria where stars like Paul McCartney made albums. Baker sat in with Nigerian legend Fela Kuti\u2019s band Africa \u201870 on several releases, including Live!, a percolating jam session that exposed Kuti\u2019s Afrobeat sound to American and European audiences for the first time. Despite Baker\u2019s star billing, Kuti and his passionate protest songs like \u201cBlack Man\u2019s Cry\u201d take center stage, with Tony Allen leading an explosive performance by The Africa \u201870s\u2019s six-man percussion section.\n\n42. Wings \u2013 Wings over America (1976)\n\nWhile John Lennon remained permanently retired from touring after The Beatles split up, Paul McCartney returned to the road with gusto. The biggest tour by his band Wings yielded a triple album, packed with their own hits as well as five Beatles songs (with the Lennon-McCartney songwriting credits intentionally flipped to McCartney-Lennon). \u201cMaybe I\u2019m Amazed,\u201d which had been widely acclaimed as the first great song of McCartney\u2019s solo career in 1970, finally became a chart hit when released as a single from Wings Over America, peaking at No. 10 on the Hot 100.\n\n41. Neil Diamond \u2013 Hot August Night (1972)\n\nNeil Diamond released three multi-platinum live albums in the \u201870s, but the most famous one is Hot August Night, perhaps in part because of Diamond\u2019s hilariously strange pose on the album cover. Hot August Night features Diamond unleashing the full power of his mighty vibrato in a 10-night stand at the Greek Theatre in L.A., belting out \u201cSweet Caroline\u201d and giving the goofiest possible performance of the country pastiche \u201cSoggy Pretzels.\u201d For some reason, Hot August Night really caught fire in Australia, going 10-times platinum and becoming the country\u2019s top-selling album of 1973.\n\n40. Iggy & The Stooges \u2013 Metallic K.O. (1976)\n\nAfter The Stooges split up, a semi-official live album recorded at two of the Detroit band\u2019s hometown shows at Michigan Palace bolstered their growing legend. At one point, it outsold their studio albums. Side two of the album, recorded at the Stooges\u2019 final show before breaking up in 1974, finds Iggy Pop in rare form, relentlessly antagonizing the audience as they pelted him with eggs and beer bottles. Pop howls \u201cI never thought it\u2019d come to this, baby!\u201d as the band launches into \u201cLouie Louie\u201d as their final middle finger to the audience. The addition of pianist Scott Thurston pounding away alongside the core quartet adds some surprising musical depth to their proto-punk sludge, but the appeal of Metallic K.O. is in how the lo-fi tapes feel more like a document of a crime scene than a live album.\n\n\n\n39. Frank Zappa \u2013 Sheik Yerbouti (1979)\n\nOne artist who repeatedly blurred the concept of a live album was Frank Zappa, who would often insert studio overdubs over concert recordings for his albums. Sheik Yerbouti epitomized this approach with onstage recordings from New York, London, and Berlin augmented by all manners of dialogue, sound effects, and musical interludes. But off-color hits like \u201cBobby Brown\u201d and the disco parody \u201cDancin\u2019 Fool\u201d made the album the biggest seller of Zappa\u2019s prolific career.\n\n38. Diana Ross \u2013 An Evening with Diana Ross (1977)\n\nAn Evening with Diana Ross was a tour de force show that The Supremes star took around the world as well as to Broadway (where she won a Tony) and to network television (where the special was nominated for an Emmy) before winding up as a live album. Ross hits the expected beats with her solo work, \u201860s Motown hits by the Supremes and others, and a suite of tributes to influences like Billie Holiday and Josephine Baker. But the consummate entertainer also throws in some less expected selections like medleys of songs from A Chorus Line and Harry Nilsson\u2019s 1970 album The Point!\n\n37. Bob Dylan & The Band \u2013 Before The Flood (1974)\n\nIn 1974, Bob Dylan staged his first tour in 8 years, reuniting with the same musicians (now known as The Band instead of The Hawks) who had backed him in the \u201860s. A lot had happened in the intervening years \u2013 Dylan himself went through several metamorphoses, while his touring band had become platinum-selling stars in their own right. Dylan\u2019s new studio album with The Band, Planet Waves, was a hit, but the real news was the tour. Songs Dylan had written during his years away from the road took interesting shapes, including \u201cAll Along the Watchtower,\u201d which was influenced heavily by Jimi Hendrix\u2019s cover. Dylan would also cede the spotlight to The Band to play hits of their own, like \u201cThe Weight\u201d and \u201cUp on Cripple Creek.\u201d\n\n36. Todd Rundgren \u2013 Back To the Bars (1978)\n\nTodd Rundgren spent the mid-\u201870s eschewing the commercial appeal of his earlier work, making multiple conceptual double albums and going prog with his band Utopia. But after 1978\u2019s Hermit of Mink Hollow was hailed as a return to form, Rundgren booked intimate residencies at clubs like The Roxy in L.A. and recorded an equally accessible live album. But alongside his singer-songwriter material, there\u2019s traces of the more oddball Rundgren records like \u201cZen Archer\u201d that made him a cult hero.\n\n35. The Carpenters \u2013 Live At the Palladium (1976)\n\nThe Carpenters ruled AM radio in the \u201870s with gentle soft rock hits. But the sibling duo\u2019s virtuoso musicianship took centerstage on The Carpenters\u2019 frequent tours and network TV specials. Karen Carpenter\u2019s delightful drum solo showcase on Live at the Palladium is as impressive a part of her legacy as any of the heartbreaking ballads she sang.\n\n34. Yes \u2013 Yessongs (1973)\n\nThe double LP live album represents the height of \u201870s rock excess, so leave it to the longwinded prog rockers of Yes to swing for the fences with a triple live album, complete with a Yessongs concert film following it in 1975. The album is culled from multiple tours in 1972, with founding drummer Bill Bruford appearing on some tracks. But when Bruford left the band to join King Crimson after the recording of Close to the Edge, new drummer Alan White had just three days to learn their incredibly complex repertoire before touring began, making White the true MVP of Yessongs.\n\n33. Judas Priest \u2013 Unleashed In the East (1979)\n\nFollowing the lead of Cheap Trick (who\u2019d cemented the \u201cbig in Japan\u201d rock\u2019n\u2019roll clich\u00e9 with At Budokan) Judas Priest reached new heights with a live album recorded in Tokyo in 1979. Like many live albums of the era, Unleashed in the East was notorious for being polished up with studio overdubs, but it\u2019s worth it to hear Rob Halford\u2019s high notes on \u201cVictim of Changes\u201d that much more clearly. Priest showed the range of their influences by giving heavy metal makeovers to Joan Baez\u2019s \u201cDiamonds and Rust\u201d and Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cThe Green Manalishi.\u201d\n\n32. Elton John \u2013 17-11-70 (1971)\n\nAt the peak of Elton John\u2019s imperial phase in 1976, he recorded Here and There, a proper arena-scale live album of his biggest hits. But by Sir Elton\u2019s own admission, his best live performance was captured a half-decade earlier, when his career was just getting off the ground. A month into his first American tour, John gave a live radio performance on New York\u2019s WABC, and the widely bootlegged broadcast prompted an official album release that sold impressively. John\u2019s early performances of songs like \u201cTake Me to the Pilot,\u201d backed only by bassist Dee Murray and drummer Nigel Olsson, have a power trio grit that was lost in his later tours with bigger ensembles.\n\n31. Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young \u2013 4 Way Street (1971)\n\nCSNY\u2019s first concert album was released a year after the quartet\u2019s landmark first album together. But 4 Way Street only repeats two songs from D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu. Instead, the focus is on non-album tracks like scathing protest single \u201cOhio,\u201d and letting each member run through highlights of their individual songbooks with the supergroup\u2019s backing harmonies. Neil Young runs through the freshly minted After the Gold Rush classics \u201cDon\u2019t Let It Bring You Down\u201d and \u201cSouthern Man,\u201d while David Crosby offers up a couple of previously unreleased songs, including the suggestive Byrds outtake \u201cTriad.\u201d\n\n30. AC/DC \u2013 If You Want Blood You\u2019ve Got It (1978)\n\nAC/DC\u2019s only live album with original frontman Bon Scott was recorded in the singer\u2019s native country at the Glasgow stop of the Powerage tour. And for the encore, the Australian band returned to the stage in Scottish football kits. The essence of \u201870s AC/DC is captured in all its bawdy, no-frills glory on If You Want Blood You\u2019ve Got It, even if the song of the same name wouldn\u2019t be released until Highway To Hell two years later. Plus, Angus Young has seldom sounded more maniacal and electrified than he does on his guitar solo on \u201cThe Jack.\u201d\n\n29. Lynyrd Skynyrd \u2013 One More From The Road (1976)\n\nGuitarist Steve Gaines, brother of Lynyrd Skynyrd backing singer Cassie Gaines, was invited to join the band in 1976, weeks before the band recorded their first live album at Atlanta\u2019s Fox Theatre. And One More from The Road became an essential document of Gaines\u2019s talent in his brief time with the band, as Skynyrd barreled through their hits and covered influences like Robert Johnson and Jimmie Rodgers. Sadly, Gaines only got to play on one studio album by the band before the tragic 1977 plane crash that killed him, Cassie Gaines, singer Ronnie Van Zant, and three others.\n\n28. David Bowie \u2013 David Live (1974)\n\nThe two live albums David Bowie released in the \u201870s reflected just how quickly his sound and image evolved throughout the decade. The first, 1974\u2019s David Live, is a farewell to his glam period from the Diamond Dogs tour, while 1978\u2019s Stage captured Bowie in the thick of his Berlin period. And while Stage features a great band playing some of his best material, Bowie himself feels reserved and distant. David Live, however, is Bowie the vocalist at his most expressive, giving an incredible performance of \u201cMoonage Daydream\u201d and offering his own take on \u201cAll the Young Dudes,\u201d the hit he\u2019d written for Mott the Hoople.\n\n27. KISS \u2013 Alive! (1975)\n\nKISS\u2019s first three albums didn\u2019t sell well, but the band built a cult following on tour with the spectacle of face paint, pyro, and fake blood. Their first live album may not have come with a visual of everything that a KISS concert entailed, but it captured the energy and volume of those performances well enough to finally turn KISS into a popular phenomenon, rocketing them into the top 10 and kicking off the band\u2019s brief run of Beatles-esque ubiquity.\n\n26. Parliament \u2013 Live: P-Funk Earth Tour (1977)\n\nGeorge Clinton had a good deal going throughout the \u201870s between Parliament and Funkadelic, essentially the same band with two different names that released albums concurrently on different labels. The distinction between them began to blur more, however, when Parliament-Funkadelic toured as one unified force for the P-Funk Earth Tour in 1976 and 1977, hiring KISS\u2019s set designer Jules Fischer to execute Clinton\u2019s vision of The Holy Mothership landing on the stage. But it was Parliament\u2019s label, Casablanca, that bankrolled the tour and released the live album, which focused on Parliament songs with just one Funkadelic hit, \u201cThe Undisco Kidd.\u201d The album is full of extended medleys and call-and-response grooves like \u201cTear the Roof off the Sucker\u201d that expand on the wild sonic terrain of the group\u2019s studio albums.\n\n25. Elvis Costello and the Attractions \u2013 Live at the El Mocambo (1978)\n\nIn March 1978, Elvis Costello and The Attractions played a show in Toronto that was broadcast on a local radio station, distributed as a promotional live album by Costello\u2019s label in Canada, and widely bootlegged for many years before finally getting a wider release. Live at the El Mocambo is a great snapshot of Costello\u2019s chemistry with his newly formed backing band, as they cranked up the tempo of songs from My Aim Is True and previewed \u201cRadio Radio\u201d along with songs from the upcoming This Years Model.\n\n24. Ike & Tina Turner \u2013 What You Hear is What You Get \u2013 Live at Carnegie Hall (1971)\n\nIke & Tina Turner made eight live albums in the \u201860s and \u201870s, the most successful of which was the gold-selling double LP What You Hear is What You Get. The duo was riding high with their cover of \u201cProud Mary\u201d when they came to Carnegie Hall. But the Turners and the Ikettes also blazed through a set of other inspired covers, including The Rolling Stones, Sly & the Family Stone, and Otis Redding, dedicating the last side of the album to \u201cRespect\u201d and an epic, borderline X-rated \u201cI\u2019ve Been Loving You Too Long.\u201d\n\n23. Willie Nelson \u2013 Willie and Family Live (1978)\n\nWillie Nelson was on fire in 1978. Willie and Family Live was the third multi-platinum album he released that year, after Waylon & Willie with Waylon Jennings and Stardust. Backed by his longtime band The Family (drummer Paul English, bassist Bee Spears, harmonica player Mickey Raphael, and sister Bobbie Nelson on piano), Nelson strums his iconic guitar, \u201cTrigger,\u201d and reaches all the way back to Patsy Cline\u2019s \u201cCrazy\u201d to showcase his two decades of writing hits. But the single from Willie and Family Live that became one of Nelson\u2019s signature songs was a cover, of Johnny Bush\u2019s \u201cWhiskey River.\u201d\n\n22. Rush \u2013 All The World\u2019s A Stage (1976)\n\nFor the first three decades of Rush\u2019s career, they maintained a steady schedule: four studio albums, then a live album, then four more studio records, then another live collection. This pattern began with All The World\u2019s A Stage, recorded on the tour in support of 2112, which was both the band\u2019s proggiest album to date and their most commercially successful. \u201cWorking Man\u201d and \u201cIn The Mood\u201d allowed drummer Neil Peart a chance to put his own spin on the bluesier material from before he joined Rush, while the complex Peart epics \u201c2112\u201d and \u201cBy-Tor and the Snow Dog\u201d showcased the Canadian power trio\u2019s instrumental chops.\n\n21. Bob Marley and the Wailers \u2013 Live! (1975)\n\nBob Marley was the toast of London when he performed at the Lyceum Theatre, covered by Eric Clapton and offered the use of the Rolling Stones\u2019 mobile studio to record his first live album. Running through songs from Burnin\u2019 and Natty Dread, The Wailers played a gorgeous rendition of \u201cNo Woman, No Cry\u201d that became both the song\u2019s most famous recording and Marley\u2019s first major chart hit outside Jamaica.\n\n20. Queen \u2013 Live Killers (1979)\n\nQueen epitomized arena rock in 1979, offering so much triumphant bombast that \u201cWe Will Rock You\u201d is featured twice (once at a much faster tempo). Many of Queen\u2019s songs were purpose-built for the stage, from \u201cLet Me Entertain You\u201d to \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Me Now,\u201d and it\u2019s a joy to hear them thrive in that environment. But the band\u2019s crowd-pleasing instincts belie all sorts of interesting choices in how they presented their catalog onstage. Some of their biggest hits are dispatched in abbreviated two-minute slices, while less famous tunes like \u201cNow I\u2019m Here\u201d and \u201cBrighton Rock\u201d are blown out to lengthy epics.\n\n19. Bill Withers \u2013 Live At Carnegie Hall (1973)\n\nBill Withers only had two studio albums on shelves when he recorded a double live album at Carnegie Hall. But even at that point, his songbook already included timeless tracks like \u201cLean On Me,\u201d \u201cAin\u2019t No Sunshine,\u201d and \u201cGrandma\u2019s Hands.\u201d Withers fleshed out the show with warmly intimate patter between songs, a funky extended vamp on the opener \u201cUse Me,\u201d and five previously unreleased songs. The most enduring of the new cuts was \u201cI Can\u2019t Write Left Handed,\u201d a wry and poignant reflection on the end of the Vietnam War.\n\n18. Joni Mitchell \u2013 Miles of Aisles (1974)\n\nAfter the success of 1974\u2019s Court and Spark, Joni Mitchell went on a rare tour with her backing band from the album, L.A. Express, and recorded her first live album. There\u2019s a beautifully relaxed interplay in the performances on Miles of Aisles, like the way Mitchell\u2019s voice and Robben Ford\u2019s guitar circle around each other at the end of \u201cYou Turn Me On, I\u2019m A Radio.\u201d The live recording of \u201cBig Yellow Taxi\u201d from the album charted higher than the original version did four years earlier, helping make it Mitchell\u2019s signature song.\n\n17. Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band \u2013 \u2018Live\u2019 Bullet (1976)\n\nBob Seger had been Detroit\u2019s hometown hero for over a decade when he finally became a national headliner in the mid-\u201870s. So recording a double album at the local arena, Cobo Hall, created the perfect moment to take Seger to the next level. Summoning all the passion of a true rock\u2019n\u2019roll believer, Seger ran through his back catalog and covers of Ike & Tina Turner, Bo Diddley, and Chuck Berry. And \u201cTurn The Page,\u201d the weary road anthem that missed the charts the first time it was released in 1972, became an FM radio staple, led by Silver Bullet Band saxophonist Alto Reed\u2019s iconic opening riff.\n\n16. Lou Reed \u2013 Rock N Roll Animal (1974)\n\nRock N Roll Animal was Lou Reed\u2019s first live album as a solo artist, but four of the LP\u2019s five tracks were Velvet Underground songs, with only \u201cLady Day\u201d representing the three solo albums he\u2019d released by 1974. Reed\u2019s bombastic backing band (comprised mostly of future Alice Cooper sidemen) was nothing like the Velvets. Guitarists Dick Wagner and Steve Hunter trade solos for 3 minutes over the intro for \u201cSweet Jane\u201d before the song\u2019s main riff comes in. The classic rock treatment of the VU catalog struck a nerve, though, and Rock N Roll Animal achieved something Reed\u2019s previous work never had: a gold record.\n\n15. Peter Frampton \u2013 Frampton Comes Alive! (1976)\n\nMany of the artists on this list launched their careers with live albums, but Peter Frampton is the guy whose career pretty much is his live album. The former Humble Pie guitarist released four relatively unsuccessful studio albums before Frampton Comes Alive!, and even his follow-up album only sold about a tenth as much. But Frampton ruled over 1976 with an irrepressible mix of big hooks and guitar heroics that sounded looser and livelier outside of the studio. Frampton is no master songwriter \u2013 he rips off a Doobie Brothers riff with a wah-wah pedal on a song that\u2019s actually named \u201cDoobie Wah\u201d \u2013 but there\u2019s a durable thrill to the talkbox solo on the epic closer \u201cDo You Feel Like We Do.\u201d\n\n14. Marvin Gaye \u2013 Marvin Gaye Live! (1974)\n\nMarvin Gaye suffered from stage fright and rarely performed during the early \u201870s period when he released some of his most revered albums. But in 1974, Gaye reluctantly began touring for the first time in a half-decade and fans received him with open arms at the Oakland Coliseum Arena. Fresh off Let\u2019s Get It On, Gaye was at his pinnacle as a sex symbol, and he pleaded and teased the audience into such shrieks of ecstasy during \u201cDistant Lover\u201d that the crowd noise was part of the appeal of the song\u2019s live recording, which became a Top 40 hit. But Gaye dispatched his \u201860s hits swiftly in a section of the show that was playfully labeled \u201cFossil Medley\u201d on the album\u2019s tracklist.\n\n13. The Band \u2013 The Last Waltz (1978)\n\nThe Band\u2019s 1976 farewell concert at the Winterland Arena in San Francisco was filmed by Martin Scorsese and became perhaps the most revered concert film of the decade. Of course, the movie also stirred some gossip and controversy \u2013 the cocaine edited out of Neil Young\u2019s nose as well as Scorsese\u2019s friendship with Robbie Robertson coloring his portrayal of The Band \u2013 but the performances themselves are a treasure. The men of the hour are joined by a parade of stars, including the singers they backed in the \u201860s, Bob Dylan and Ronnie Hawkins. But The Band\u2019s unique sound and chemistry is also captured beautifully on performances of \u201cThe Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\u201d and \u201cStage Fright.\u201d\n\n12. Jimi Hendrix \u2013 Band Of Gypsys (1970)\n\nFor nearly two years, Jimi Hendrix labored on a fourth studio album that he wouldn\u2019t live to complete. In the meantime, he owed Capitol Records an album due to a contract dispute, so he delivered a live record of entirely new songs with a new rhythm section (drummer Buddy Miles and bassist Billy Cox) after disbanding The Jimi Hendrix Experience. Recorded on New Year\u2019s Day 1970, the final album Hendrix finished in his lifetime explores a more soulful side, although the bombastic \u201cMachine Gun\u201d reaffirmed his status as an otherworldly wizard with an electric guitar. It was also one of the first examples of a major artist releasing an entirely new set of songs as a live album that had never been released as studio recordings \u2013 an unusual approach that would be used in the following years by Neil Young, Jackson Browne, Ted Nugent, and many others.\n\n11. Tom Waits \u2013 Nighthawks at the Diner (1975)\n\nMany of the albums on this list featured extensive studio overdubs, but only one album was recorded entirely in a studio with a live audience present. When Tom Waits recorded his third album, the Record Plant in Los Angeles was converted into a jazz club, dubbed \u2018Raphael\u2019s Silver Cloud Lounge,\u2019 complete with a bar, tables, and an opening performance by a stripper. With Waits riffing and free-associating over walking basslines and relaxed swing jazz grooves (and the crowd hanging on his every word) the unique atmosphere helped him create one of his loosest, funniest, and most consistently entertaining albums.\n\n10. Neil Young & Crazy Horse \u2013 Rust Never Sleeps (1979)\n\nTwice in the \u201870s, Neil Young released live albums comprised entirely of new material, albeit with very different results. 1973\u2019s Time Fades Away featured Young backed by an all-star band of noted session musicians, The Stray Gators, but the band\u2019s chemistry never gelled, and a disappointed Young let the album go out of print for decades. At the end of the decade, however, Young recorded another live album with Crazy Horse, which was ultimately his biggest commercial success since Harvest. Following the format of the concerts that featured both an acoustic set and an electric set, Rust Never Sleeps opens with the quiet \u201cMy My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)\u201d and closes with its roaring counterpoint \u201cHey Hey, My My (Into The Black).\u201d Rust Never Sleeps did feature some studio recordings, and was mixed with crowd noise low to feel more like a studio album, but a more pure live album from the next tour, Live Rust, followed just five months later.\n\n9. Thin Lizzy \u2013 Live and Dangerous (1978)\n\nThin Lizzy only made a live album because their producer, Tony Visconti, was too busy with other clients to start work on the band\u2019s next studio album. But the tapes frontman Phil Lynott sorted through to assemble a live LP contained firecracker performances showcasing Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson\u2019s twin lead guitar attack. A young American going by \u201cBluesey\u201d Huey Lewis blows a harmonica solo on \u201cBaby Drives Me Crazy\u201d years before he\u2019d become one of the biggest pop stars of the \u201880s. Live rock doesn\u2019t get much better than when the last chord of \u201cCowboy Song\u201d crashes into the first chord of \u201cThe Boys Are Back In Town.\u201d\n\n8. The Grateful Dead \u2013 Europe \u201972 (1972)\n\nThe Grateful Dead may be the most bootlegged band in history, and the faithful fans following them around the country taping and trading shows made them legends. But the Dead\u2019s official live releases have always been an important part of their canon (hence their double inclusion on this list), and by the end of 1972, they had three live albums alongside five studio albums. The triple-LP Europe \u201972 featured the definitive recordings of several new songs that would never appear on studio albums, including \u201cJack Straw\u201d and \u201cBrown-Eyed Woman.\u201d Ron \u201cPigpen\u201d McKernan, who\u2019d leave the band and pass away in the year following the European tour, also co-wrote and sang one of those new songs, \u201cMr. Charlie.\u201d\n\n7. The Ramones \u2013 It\u2019s Alive (1979)\n\nOn the last night of 1977, The Ramones came to London\u2019s Rainbow Theatre and played to a full house of British punks who idolized the American originators. Tommy Ramone was months away from stepping down from the drum stool, and both Johnny Ramone and road manager Monte Melnick singled it out decades later as the best show the original lineup ever played. If the band\u2019s first three studio albums hadn\u2019t stamped The Ramones as rock\u2019s new prophets of speed, simplicity, and brevity, It\u2019s Alive made it official as the band blitzed through 28 anthems in 54 minutes. Little was said between songs besides Dee Dee Ramone\u2019s usual \u201c1-2-3-4!\u201d count off, although Joey Ramone takes a moment to acknowledge the chicken vindaloo he ate before the show.\n\n6. Aretha Franklin \u2013 Amazing Grace (1972)\n\nThe greatest soul singers usually learned their trade in the church choir, and Aretha Franklin was no exception. The daughter of a Baptist minister returned to her roots to record her best-selling album in a small church in Los Angeles after a decade of success in secular music. Franklin still managed to weave a little pop into the proceedings, inserting Carole King\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019ve Got A Friend\u201d into a holy medley with \u201cPrecious Lord, Take My Hand,\u201d but the performance is otherwise gospel through and through. Director Sydney Pollack was on hand to film the performances, but a host of technical problems and legal issues left his Amazing Grace documentary incomplete for decades until its release in 2018.\n\n5. Jackson Browne \u2013 Running On Empty (1977)\n\nRunning On Empty is less a live album than a concept album about touring. The previously unreleased set of songs details all the glory and monotony of a rock tour, with some tracks recorded onstage and others recorded backstage or even on the bus. \u201cThe Road\u201d is the most beautifully realized moment on the album, beginning quietly in a hotel room in Maryland before progressing to a full-band performance in a New Jersey arena. Thanks to the hit title track and the fond ode to his road crew \u201cThe Load-Out,\u201d it became the biggest record of Browne\u2019s career while also being nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammys.\n\n4. Little Feat \u2013 Waiting For Columbus (1978)\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Little Feat were the quintessential \u201870s cult band, routinely blowing bigger bands like the Doobie Brothers off the stage as an opening act but never landing a mainstream hit with their idiosyncratic west coast take on blues rock and swampy New Orleans funk. Waiting For Columbus was their chance to show off the band\u2019s powerful rhythm section and leader Lowell George\u2019s scorching slide guitar on the opening strut of \u201cFat Man in the Bathtub.\u201d The Tower of Power horns took songs like \u201cMercenary Territory\u201d up a notch, while Rolling Stones guitarist Mick Taylor guested on \u201cApolitical Blues.\u201d Waiting For Columbus became Little Feat\u2019s first gold record in June 1979, but there wasn\u2019t much time to celebrate, as George died of a drug-induced heart attack mere weeks later.\n\n3. Cheap Trick \u2013 Cheap Trick At Budokan (1979)\n\nA truly unpredictable sequence of events made the Rockford, Illinois quartet Cheap Trick arena-headlining rock stars in Tokyo before they were known in America. The Japanese music press began covering Cheap Trick after the band toured with Queen, their song \u201cClock Strikes Ten\u201d topped the Japanese pop charts, and the band flew around the world to perform in front of thousands of screaming fans. The energy captured on tape at those shows was so infectious that it finally reached back to America, becoming the band\u2019s first major American hit. Once you\u2019ve heard the joyously swinging Budokan version of \u201cI Want You To Want Me,\u201d you\u2019ll never dream of listening to the comparatively tepid studio recording that missed the charts in 1977.\n\n2. The Who \u2013 Live At Leeds (1970)\n\nSimilarly to how 1967\u2019s The Who Sell Out mimicked a pirate radio broadcast, The Who put a playful black market sheen on their first official live album, with cover art that made it look like a bootleg. Recent decades have brought reissues featuring the full two hours of music The Who played on Valentine\u2019s Day 1970, including the entire Tommy album and its precursor, \u201cA Quick One, While He\u2019s Away.\u201d By comparison, the original 37-minute LP might seem slight, going heavy on nostalgic covers and an epic rendition of \u201cMy Generation.\u201d But in either form, Live At Leeds is a thunderous document of one of rock\u2019s loudest bands at the peak of its powers, perfecting their \u201860s songbook at the dawn of the \u201870s.\n\n1. The Allman Brothers Band \u2013 At Fillmore East (1971)\n\nThe Allman Brothers Band became a word-of-mouth favorite after two studio albums, but more than with any other band of the \u201870s, only a live LP could have packaged their explosive and unique sound well enough to push them to platinum sales for the first time. With two lead guitarists and two drummers, the Allmans produced an enormous sound onstage, with extended instrumental workouts that turned the 5-minute \u201cWhipping Post\u201d into a 23-minute behemoth. Founding guitarist Duane Allman (who said he\u2019d listened to Miles Davis\u2019s Kind of Blue for two years straight) brought the spontaneity of jazz to his twin lead guitar instrumental workouts with Dickie Betts, creating an album that helped birth the jam band genre as much as any Grateful Dead record. Unfortunately, Duane Allman died in a motorcycle crash less than 4 months after the release of At Fillmore East, so although Gregg Allman led the band for several decades with great success after that, At Fillmore East remains the lightning-in-a-bottle moment that crystallized the original lineup\u2019s unique chemistry."}, {"url": "https://www.berklee.edu/careers/roles/recording-group-or-band", "page_content": "Almost all of the world's most recognizable and celebrated musicians are recording artists\u2014but that doesn't mean all recording artists are successful. The definition of a recording artist is simple: a musical artist or group that records and releases music. It doesn't matter whether they're songwriters who create their own material, pop star singers whose songs are written by teams of staff writers, original bands that create unique or niche music, or DJs who create remixes\u2014if they consistently record and release music, they are recording artists.\n\nOnce a musician has cultivated a large fan base, scored several hits, and/or signed with a major label, it's possible to quit the day job and focus on recording, releasing, and performing music.\n\nWhile recording is usually what brings recording artists recognition or even fame, most artists actually spend the bulk of their time performing. Recording an album is a creatively exhausting process, the whole of which\u2014from finding or creating initial material to receiving the final mix\u2014can take anywhere from a month to six months or more. Some artists release multiple albums per year, while others go several years without stepping into the studio, relying on royalties and touring to make a living. Speaking of touring, recording artists spend almost all their time outside of the studio booking shows or tours to perform their recorded songs live. Touring not only helps promote new albums, but also serves as a reliable source of income in a time when recorded music generates less revenue than ever before.\n\nPerhaps the greatest divide in this field is between artists who are signed to record labels and those who are independent. Landing a deal with a record company provides numerous benefits, chief among them access to the label's financial, promotional, and organizational resources. Labels provide managers, search for and license great songs from publishers, hire producers who help select and edit material, book recording studios, pay for mixing and mastering, and market the release through radio promotion, publicity campaigns, and more. In contrast, independent artists need to generate funds themselves or employ impressive ingenuity to record, mix, market, and release their work."}, {"url": "https://www.boomplay.com/artists/2824169", "page_content": "Current #251\n\nAll Time #285\n\nC\u00e9line Marie Claudette Dion (born 30 March 1968) is a Canadian singer. Many of Dion songs become very popular and trendy online with a great number of streaming and downloads on Boomplay. From her humble roots as a French-language teenage pop singer to international superstardom, Canadian singer Celine Dion became a multi-platinum, Grammy-winning crossover success in the '90s after breaking into the English-language market with heartfelt ballads that shined a spotlight on her powerful and inimitable voice.\n\n\n\nNoted for her powerful and technically skilled vocals, Dion is the best-selling Canadian recording artist, and the best-selling French language artist of all time. Her music has incorporated genres such as pop, rock, R&B, gospel, and classical music.\n\n\n\nDion was born in Charlemagne, Quebec, the youngest of 14 children of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se (n\u00e9e Tanguay, 1927\u20132020), a homemaker, and Adh\u00e9mar Dion (1923\u20132003), a butcher, both of French-Canadian descent. She was raised a Roman Catholic in a poor but, by her own account, happy home in Charlemagne.\n\n\n\nCareer\n\nBorn into a large family from Charlemagne, Quebec, she emerged as a teen star in her home country with a series of French-language albums during the 1980s. She first gained international recognition by winning both the 1982 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival and the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest, where she represented Switzerland. After learning to speak English, she signed on to Epic Records in the United States.\n\n\n\nIn 1990, Dion released her debut English-language album, Unison, establishing herself as a viable pop artist in North America and other English-speaking areas of the world. Her recordings since have been mainly in English and French although she has also sung in Spanish, Italian, German, Latin, Japanese, and Chinese.\n\n\n\nDuring the 1990s, she achieved worldwide fame after releasing several best-selling English-language albums in music history, such as Falling into You (1996) and Let's Talk About Love (1997), which were both certified diamond in the US and over 30 million sales worldwide each.\n\n\n\nShe also scored a series of international number-one hits, including \"The Power of Love\", \"Think Twice\", \"Because You Loved Me\", \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\", \"My Heart Will Go On\", and \"I'm Your Angel\". Dion continued releasing French albums between each English record; D'eux (1995) became the best-selling French-language album of all time, while S'il suffisait d'aimer (1998), Sans attendre (2012), and Encore un soir (2016), were all certified diamond in France.\n\n\n\nDuring the 2000s, she built her reputation as a highly successful live performer with A New Day... on the Las Vegas Strip (2003\u201307), which remains the highest-grossing concert residency of all time, as well as the Taking Chances World Tour (2008\u201309), one of the highest-grossing concert tours of all time.\n\n\n\nAchievements\n\nCeline Dion has been honoured with numerous accolades throughout her long standing career. Dion has been recognized all over the world and received various awards including\n\n\u2022 5 Grammy Awards\n\n\u2022 12 World Music Awards\n\n\u20227 Billboard Music Awards\n\n\u2022 6 American Music Awards\n\n\u2022 20 Juno Awards\n\n\u2022 50 Felix Awards and many more.\n\n\u2022 She is the third most awarded artist in Juno Awards history and the most nominated artist ever (75).\n\n\n\nAt age 14, Dion won the gold medal at the 13th Yamaha World Popular Song Festival in Tokyo for an audience of 115 million TV viewers. In 1988, she won the prestigious Eurovision Song Contest for an audience of 600 million TV viewers. In 1999, Dion received a star on Canada's Walk of Fame and was inducted into the Canadian Broadcast Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\nIn January 2004, she was honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The World Music Awards honoured her with the prestigious Chopard Diamond award in 2004 and Legend Award in 2007.\n\n\n\nIn 2013, Dion was awarded the highest rank of the Order of Canada, the Companion of the Order of Canada, by the Governor General of Canada.\n\n\n\nIn 2016, she was honoured by the Billboard Music Awards with an Icon Award.\n\n\n\nIn 2021, Boston's prestigious Berklee College of Music bestowed Dion with her second honorary doctorate in music.\n\n\n\nFollow Boomplay and keep up to date with the latest Dion songs and information.\n\n\n\nDion Songs and Albums\n\n\u2022 Faith\n\n\u2022 Falling In Love Again\n\n\u2022 Falling into You\n\n\u2022 Feliz Navidad\n\n\u2022 Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)\n\n\u2022 God Bless America\n\n\u2022 Hand in Hand\n\n\u2022 Happy To Meet You\n\n\u2022 Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\n\n\u2022 Have a Heart\n\n\u2022 Have You Ever Been in Love\n\n\u2022 Miracle\n\n\u2022 Misled\n\n\u2022 Moi quand je pleure\n\n\u2022 Mon homme\n\n\u2022 My Heart Will Go On\n\n\u2022 My Heart Will\n\n\u2022 Ne partez pas sans moi\n\n\u2022 New Dawn\n\n\u2022 Open Arms\n\n\u2022 Ordinaire\n\n\u2022 Overjoyed\n\n\u2022 Somebody Loves Somebody\n\n\u2022 Sorry for Love\n\n\u2022 A New Day Has Come (Album)\n\n\u2022 Courage (Album)\n\n\u2022 Falling Into You (Album)\n\n\u2022 Lets Talk About Love (Album)\n\n\u2022 Taking Chances (Album)\n\n\u2022 Incognito (Album)\n\n\u2022 One Heart (Album)\n\n\n\nDion songs are included in Boomplay music playlists.

While in the past, artists made sure to release a full-length album every few years, that is no longer the case. Instead, many artists are now releasing shorter, more frequent albums and EPs. With so much music being released today, it\u2019s hard to keep track of how often artists are releasing albums. So, how often do artists release albums nowadays?\n\nThe frequency of album releases varies greatly depending on the artist. Some artists still prefer to release a full-length album every few years, while others may release multiple EPs over the course of a year. Additionally, some artists may choose to release singles rather than albums. Despite this variety, there are some trends in the music industry that you can use to get a better understanding of the frequency of album releases. So, if you\u2019re curious about just how often artists are releasing albums these days, read on to find out.\n\nAverage Artist Albums Released\n\nAn average artist album is one that is released by a musician or band on a regular basis. This could be anything from a one-off EP to a full length LP. The average release rate for an artist album is usually between one and three a year, although this varies depending on the artist and their level of success. Generally, the more popular the artist is, the more albums they are likely to release. Some artists will even release multiple albums in the same year, or even multiple albums simultaneously. The average release rate for an artist album can also depend on the type of music the artist produces. For example, a folk artist may not release as many albums as a hip-hop artist. As a result, it is difficult to determine an exact average for the release rate of artist albums.\n\nNew Artist Music Release Frequency\n\nIn the music industry, new artist music release frequency can vary greatly depending on the artist and their goals. Generally, new artists will release music more frequently in order to build up a fanbase and create more opportunities for exposure. This can include releasing singles or EPs, music videos, and other promotional material. Additionally, some artists may choose to space out their releases, opting to focus on quality over quantity and releasing fewer but more impactful singles. Ultimately, the frequency of new artist music releases is up to the artist and their team, and should be based on the artist\u2019s overall career trajectory and goals.\n\nNumber of Songs Released by Artists Annually\n\nThe number of songs released by artists annually varies greatly depending on the artist. Popular recording artists will typically release several singles, an EP, and an album each year, while more independent artists might only release a few singles, or even just one song. As streaming services become more popular, the number of songs released each year is likely to increase, as artists are able to reach a larger audience and spread their music more easily. Additionally, with more musicians taking advantage of digital production tools, the production time for each song is likely to decrease, resulting in more songs being released annually.\n\nHow Long To Release Album Artist\n\nReleasing an album as an artist usually involves several distinct steps. Depending on the artist\u2019s method of release, the timeframe for releasing an album can vary significantly. Generally, the process involves songwriting, recording, mixing, mastering, artwork design, and distribution.\n\nSongwriting is the first step in the process of releasing an album. The artist must create the music, lyrics, and melodies before they can move on to the recording phase. This process can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months, depending on how much material the artist has created.\n\nAfter the songs have been written, the artist must move on to the recording phase. Depending on the recording setup and budget of the artist, this process can take anywhere from several days to several months. Recording is done in a studio, where the artist works with an engineer to capture the sound of the instrumentation and vocals.\n\nOnce the recording is completed, the artist must move on to mixing and mastering. Mixing is the process of blending and balancing the various elements of the song to create a cohesive whole. Mastering is the process of applying the finishing touches to the mix, such as EQ and compression. This process can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks.\n\nAfter the audio is finished, the artwork must be designed. This step involves creating the album cover, liner notes, and other visual elements. This process can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks.\n\nFinally, the album must be distributed. This step involves making the album available to streaming services, digital stores, and physical retailers. Depending on the methods of distribution chosen by the artist, this process can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks.\n\nIn total, the process of releasing an album can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months. This timeline is dependent on the artist\u2019s process, budget, and methods of distribution.\n\nIn conclusion, the frequency with which artists release albums is largely dependent on their individual preferences and career plans. Some artists may release multiple albums in a single year, while others may stick with releasing one album every few years. It is also important to note that the type of music being released, the genre, and the availability of resources, such as funding and production personnel, can have an effect on the rate of album releases.\n\nOverall, the frequency of album releases is unique to each artist, and while some artists may release albums frequently, others may choose to focus on quality over quantity.\n\nMain Conclusions:\n\n-Frequency of album releases is unique to each artist\n\n-Preferences and career plans affect album release rate\n\n-Genre, availability of resources such as funding, and production personnel also have an effect on album release rate\n\n-Some artists may choose to focus on quality over quantity"}, {"url": "https://hearthemusicplay.com/top-100-albums/", "page_content": "Are you in a music rut?
