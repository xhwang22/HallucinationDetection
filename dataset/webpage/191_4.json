{"Adam Collis moved to New York City to pursue an acting career.": [{"url": "https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-09-28/hollywood-career-change-what-to-consider-when-trying-to-break-in-in-your-40s-and-beyond", "page_content": "Use your life experience \u2014 say, as a teacher or lawyer \u2014 to help you land roles early on, an acting coach suggests.\n\nAngela White remembers being the type of kid who enthusiastically assembled her family in the living room so she could perform a skit or dance.\n\n\u201cI was always dancing,\u201d White said. \u201cYou know, I thought I\u2019d be Janet Jackson\u2019s backup dancer. That was always the dream.\u201d\n\nBut when she moved to West Covina from Compton in the seventh grade, she became the only Black girl in her class. By the time she got to high school, she didn\u2019t feel welcome to perform in drama productions. She worked backstage instead and eventually majored in theater and communications in college, but she ended up being a kindergarten and first grade teacher until her early 40s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI would read [to the kids], and I had all kinds of voices for the characters,\u201d she said.\n\nIn 2018, she decided to give herself the chance to follow her passion. White has since landed two ads \u2014 for a diabetes medication and the massage tool Theragun \u2014 that you might have seen during a commercial break on Hulu.\n\nShannon Sturges \u2014 a teacher, coach and co-owner of Speiser/Sturges Acting Studio \u2014 said a 25-year-old once told her he was too old to begin his acting career.\n\nThat\u2019s not true, she said.\n\nPeople start their acting careers later in life for all sorts of reasons, she said. They may get distracted by life challenges. They may be afraid of putting themselves out there. They may be dissuaded to pursue acting by friends.\n\n\u201cIt seems like such as pie-in-the-sky thing to want to be an actor,\u201d Sturges said.\n\nBut there are always older characters in commercials, films and television shows \u2014 and a need for older people to play them.\n\nIf you want to switch careers and pursue acting, you\u2019ll need to invest in the time to practice your craft and identify your brand. You\u2019ll also need the tenacity to stick with constant auditioning and the rejection that comes with it. The Times spoke with Sturges and two of her students, White and actor Ross Bridgman, to get their advice on how to start.\n\nEnroll in an acting or technique class\n\nBridgman, who is in his 70s, was a practicing lawyer in Ohio for more than 40 years, so he knows how to command the attention of a room.\n\nHe said that when he was a \u201cyounger guy, like a lot younger,\u201d he did musical theater. But he didn\u2019t pursue it as a career because he fell in love and wanted to have financial stability for his future family.\n\nAs a hobby, he continued performing in productions such as \u201cOliver!\u201d \u201cThe Unsinkable Molly Brown\u201d and \u201cCamelot.\u201d He also joined a symphony chorus.\n\nFour years after retiring in 2014, Bridgman enrolled in the Speiser/Sturges Acting Studio. After three days of technique classes, he realized he had serious work to do.\n\n\u201cAll sorts of things were going through my mind, but the one thing that was absolutely clear is: I needed to spend time on my acting chops,\u201d he said.\n\nEventually, you\u2019ll need to get headshots, go to casting calls or find a talent agent, but it was the practice, Bridgmen said, that has helped him land roles since.\n\nUnderstand your strengths\n\nAs in any industry, it\u2019s easier to have an earlier start. But some actors who\u2019ve been in the industry their whole lives can get in a bubble, Sturges said; having other life experiences can work in your favor.\n\nShe recommends capitalizing on those experiences to help brand yourself and set yourself apart. If you were a lawyer, in the medical field or in the military, make that known on your resume. Bridgman has landed roles playing lawyers.\n\nAlso, some actors who started earlier in life can become jaded after being in the industry for a while, Sturges said. Maybe they didn\u2019t reach the level of fame they wanted or don\u2019t feel they should have to audition like everyone else for certain roles. That leaves more opportunity for someone with more energy who is just starting out later in life, Sturges said.\n\nDon\u2019t quit your day job, unless you can\n\nOne of the benefits of starting acting later in life may be that you have been able to achieve some financial stability in your previous career.\n\nBridgman still lives in Ohio. When necessary, he can fly to Los Angeles for an acting gig.\n\nWhen he talks with younger peers, he said a lot of them change course from wanting to be an actor to becoming a camera operator, producer or writer because working for next to nothing and supplementing your income with a service job isn\u2019t always sustainable.\n\n\u201cI am simply not in the same economic condition that I was in when I was graduating from college. Which was zippo money and zippo prospects, other than law school,\u201d Bridgman said.\n\nWhite also isn\u2019t financially dependent on landing acting gigs. But if you\u2019re not financially secure, don\u2019t throw away your safety net, Sturges said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had people say to me, \u2018I\u2019m all in. I quit my job, and I\u2019m going to live in my car,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nInstead of quitting your day job, talk with your employer about your new pursuit and see if there\u2019s the possibility of a flexible schedule, she said.\n\n\u201cPeople are often so supportive,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people who aren\u2019t supportive are usually people who haven\u2019t followed their dreams. A person following their dreams is a threat to those who haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\nCompany Town How to pay your bills when you\u2019re starting out in Hollywood For many people who pursue entertainment as a career, it takes years to get yourself to where you are making money from your creative work. For making money in the meantime, there\u2019s always waiting tables. But more and more people are turning to platforms like TikTok, Twitch and Patreon.\n\nUnderstand the unpredictable nature of an acting career\n\nDon\u2019t expect to land roles right off the bat, Sturges said. There isn\u2019t a set timeline or path to landing an acting job.\n\nLike anyone in the industry, there\u2019s a lot of auditioning and rejection before landing a role. And there are no guarantees.\n\nIf you can enjoy the auditions and the process, it\u2019ll make rejection easier, Sturges said.\n\nWhite loved the four days she spent in Canada (pre-COVID-19 pandemic) to film the prescription drug commercial. She got the star treatment \u2014 being driven around, staying in a hotel and getting fitted for filming day.\n\nBut she also loves the rush of auditioning for a role and getting a callback. It\u2019s all part of the process.\n\n\u201cI just know it happened once, it\u2019s going to happen again, and I\u2019m just going to keep going. I\u2019m not going to stop,\u201d she said.\n\nManage your expectations\n\nWhat does it mean to \u201cmake it\u201d as an actor? Depends on the person.\n\nFor White, it was landing a couple of commercial roles, because it validated her talent, reinvigorated her passion for acting and fueled her motivation to continue down this career path.\n\nBridgman said he\u2019s content with landing as many acting roles as he can after many years of making his passion his hobby. He\u2019s also happy to be doing this in his 70s, because it gets him outside of what his usual social circle would be.\n\nSturges said some of her older students are happy to just land one role, because it fulfills a desire that was buried for so long.\n\nMore advice\n\nDo it for the joy. If you\u2019re expecting to make money or become famous, don\u2019t do it. Bridgman and Sturges said it\u2019s more about the process, the art and enjoying it all.\n\nMarket your talent. Identify what skills and experiences you have that are desirable, Sturges said.\n\nLean into a category. Typecasting is good in the beginning, Sturges said. You want a type, but then you want to be able to break out of that.\n\nBuild a community. Sturges, White, and Bridgman all recommend finding the right agent and building a support system of people who will rally behind you.\n\nDon\u2019t give up. White said however difficult it may be, don\u2019t give up. The right opportunity will present itself if you just keep working toward it."}, {"url": "https://www.actoraesthetic.com/blog/actors-moving-to-nyc", "page_content": "1. The market goes FAST. I mean REALLY fast.\n\nGetting an apartment in NYC is vicious. It\u2019s first-come-first-serve. You have to move at a quick pace.\n\nMy roommate and I were on all the rental sites - Zillow, Naked Apartments, Street Easy. Every day. Constantly checking for new listings in the areas we were looking for, praying for cheaper prices and bigger spaces. We would see listings go up one day and taken down the next\u2026 sometimes within a 24 hour time frame.\n\n2. Beware of scams.\n\nWhen you first move to New York City as an actor, the thing you should really focus on first and foremost is getting yourself a secure & safe place to live in. Be careful of scams and make sure you see the place before you move in.\n\n3. Take into account brokers and broker fees.\n\nThere's no shortage of licensed real estate brokers in New York City\u2014well over 27,000 in fact. So if you're in the market for an apartment for rent, and thinking of hiring a broker to help in your search, the question to ask yourself is this: is a broker's help worth the money for you?\n\nIf you have money up front, a middleman does relieve some stress. NYC brokers can find you deals you wouldn\u2019t be able to find yourself. But they charge fees\u2014usually 15 percent of a year\u2019s rent, though you can occasionally negotiate (which we were able to do.)\n\nOne of the primary functions of a real estate broker is to understand your requirements and desires for your new home\u2014including apartment size, number of bedrooms, your rental budget, building & unit amenities, your preferred neighborhoods.\n\nBasically, a good broker will call you with news of an apartment that satisfies your criteria, meet you in front of the building, unlock the door, and, if you like the place, help you get all the paperwork done to sign a lease.\n\nIf you don't rent the apartment, they will continue to search, and call you every time they find something else on the market for you to look at.\n\nThis sort of NY real estate broker service can be very helpful for people who don't have time to get on the internet and explore the rental apartment listings on sites like this one, or if they are new to the city or moving here for the first time, and are not sure where to start looking\n\n4. Subletting is an option.\n\nSubletting - renting a room without adding your name to the lease - is a popular option for actors. Subletters don\u2019t have to hunt for apartments for nearly as long or jump through as many hoops as a leaseholder would have. You can also try to find sublets in different neighborhoods to see what you like best.\n\nA lot of actors love living in Washington Heights, West/Central Harlem, Morningside Heights and the Upper West Side.\n\nYou can join groups on Facebook such as Gypsy Housing NYC, Ghostlight Housing, NYC Actor Sublet Connection, Columbia Housing etc.\n\n5. What\u2019s a guarantor?\n\nA guarantor is someone who will pay the rent if you\u2019re ever unable to come up with the full amount. Some landlords will require a guarantor if you make below a certain salary. For us, a guarantor must make higher than 40 times the monthly rent.\n\nUsually this is a parent, other trusted relative or friend, or anyone who\u2019s willing to vouch for your rent-paying prowess and possibly help you in a tight spot. For us, it was our dads.\n\n6. Air conditioning is everything.\n\nFinding an apartment in New York City with central air is near impossible.\n\nAround 75% of the buildings in New York City were constructed before 1960. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, central air became mainstream later in the 1960s.\n\nYour best bet is installing a window AC unit\u2026 you\u2019ll thank me later.\n\n7. Avoid moving to NYC without any savings!\n\nNYC is not exactly the most affordable city in the world.\n\nOne thing many actors new to the city can underestimate is just how expensive it is to live here. Honestly, some days it feels like $20 bills are flying out of my pocket at warp speed! Prepare yourself for sticker shock and give yourself a financial buffer with some savings before you arrive.\n\nUnless you are lucky enough to have a good-paying job or to have a fairly well-off family that can help, you\u2019re probably not going to be living in the most luxurious space or neighborhood in the city right away.\n\nWhile there are options for affordable housing that are quite decent, it can take some searching.\n\n8. Take advantage of every deal, discount, etc. that you can!\n\nDid I ever mention that living in New York can be expensive? Yes?\n\nEven for a small room in a building, you\u2019ll be lucky to find one that\u2019s just under $1000 a month. Then, even after thinking about rent, you still need to eat, right? And what about making sure you have enough money left over for taking class, traveling to auditions, seeing shows?\n\nIt\u2019s worth taking advantage of anything that\u2019s free or discounted that\u2019s out there, so you can make the most of what you can. TodayTIx is a wonderful resource for cheap tickets to Broadway shows.\n\n9. Explore New York City!\n\nSo you don\u2019t have work. You don\u2019t have an audition or a rehearsal or a show. What are you going to do?\n\nThere\u2019s always something to do in NYC!\n\nLike anywhere else, it\u2019s healthy to have a nice life where you can relax, socialize, and explore other interests you may have, all outside of the theatre world. In my own specific case, as a blogger and podcaster, I would actually argue that it\u2019s a necessity, for the sake of not just finding inspiration, but also my own sanity.\n\nBe sure to go out, explore and enjoy!\n\n10. Get a MetroCard.\n\nThis one might seem like a no-brainer, at least for anyone who\u2019s visited New York, or any city that relies heavily on public transit."}, {"url": "https://www.wikihow.com/Start-a-Career-in-Acting", "page_content": "read about acting, look out for scams, put in the work, practice reading scripts, and take little roles for practice.\"\n\n...\"\n\n\"I literally just made the decision to pursue acting, and in this article what stood out to me was that I should"}, {"url": "https://amyjoberman.com/should-i-move-to-la-ny-to-make-it-in-acting/", "page_content": "Do You REALLY Have To Move To LA or NY To Make It As An Actor?\n\nIf you're an actor and you're NOT in L.A. or N.Y., you've probably asked yourself these questions:\n\nDo I have to move to Los Angeles or New York City to be successful as an actor?\n\nCan I make it as an actor from where I live now?\n\nHow do I know if a move to L.A. or N.Y. is right for me and my acting career?\n\nThose are all good questions.\n\nAnd there are A LOT of opportunities in L.A. and N.Y. for actors\u2026BUT\u2026\n\nIs a move to LA or NY right for YOU?\n\nThat's really the right question to ask.\n\nIs it right for YOU?\n\nNot some other actor.\n\nNot in general.\n\nFor YOU.\n\nAfter all, a move to a new, bigger city is a big deal.

He joined the American Negro Theater and later began finding roles in Hollywood. Following his performance in the 1963 film Lilies of the Field, he became the first African American to win an Academy Award for Best Actor. He also directed several films, including Buck and the Preacher and Stir Crazy. The acclaimed actor was knighted in 1974 and honored with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009.\n\nEarly Years in Miami and the Bahamas\n\nSidney Poitier was born on February 20, 1927, in Miami, Florida. He arrived two and a half months prematurely while his Bahamian parents were on vacation in Miami. As soon as he was strong enough, Poitier left the United States with his parents for the Bahamas. There, Poitier spent his early years on his father's tomato farm on Cat Island. After the farm failed, the family moved to Nassau, when Poitier was around the age of 10.\n\nIn Nassau, Poitier seemed to have a knack for getting himself into trouble. As a result, his father decided to send the teenager to the United States for his own good and Poitier went to live with one of his brothers in Miami. At age 16, Poitier left the South for New York City, where he worked menial jobs to support himself, until he found his life's passion.\n\nStage Beginnings\n\nPoitier made a deal with the American Negro Theater in New York City to receive acting lessons in exchange for working as a janitor for the theater. He eventually made his way to the ANT stage, filling in for Harry Belafonte in their production of Days of Our Youth. In 1946, Poitier appeared in a Broadway production of Lysistrata to great acclaim. His success in that role landed him another in the play Anna Lucasta, and for the next few years Poitier toured the country with the all-Black production.\n\nSidney Poitier's Films\n\nEarly Career: 'No Way Out' to 'Blackboard Jungle'\n\nPoitier made his Hollywood debut in the 1950 feature film No Way Out, and he followed in 1951 with Cry, the Beloved Country, a drama set in South Africa during the time of apartheid. He enjoyed a career breakthrough in 1955 with the popular Blackboard Jungle, portraying a troubled but gifted student at an inner-city school.\n\nOscar Nom for 'The Defiant Ones' and Win for 'Lillies of the Field'\n\nPoitier's success as an actor reached new heights when he scored an Academy Award nomination for the 1958 crime drama The Defiant Ones, with Tony Curtis. The following year, he lit up the screen as a leading man in the musical Porgy and Bess, co-starring with Dorothy Dandridge. Both this film and his impressive turn in the 1961 film adaptation of A Raisin in the Sun helped make the actor a top star.\n\nIn 1964, Poitier claimed the Best Actor Academy Award for his performance in Lilies of the Field (1963) \u2014 the first win by an African American actor in this category. The accolade helped make Poitier cinema's first Caribbean American superstar, one who consciously defied racial stereotyping.\n\n'Heat of the Night,' 'Guess Who's Coming' and 'To Sir, with Love'\n\nIn 1967, Poitier delivered three very different yet equally strong performances. He played Philadelphia detective Virgil Tibbs in the Southern crime drama In the Heat of the Night. In Guess Who's Coming to Dinner he played a Black man engaged to a white woman in this groundbreaking look at interracial marriage. Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy played his fianc\u00e9e's parents in the film. He also starred as inner-city teacher Mark Thackeray in the British film To Sir, with Love. The film finds Thackeray navigating racial and socioeconomic friction between rebellious and unruly students and winning their respect in the end.\n\nWhile he helped break down the color barrier in film and brought dignity to the portrayal of noble and intelligent characters, Poitier found himself under fire for not being more politically radical in the late 1960s. He was especially upset by a harsh article about him in The New York Times and decided to step out of the spotlight, choosing to live in the Bahamas for a time before making his return to Hollywood.\n\nDirecting Successes: 'Buck and the Preacher' to 'Stir Crazy'\n\nIn 1972 Poitier made his directorial debut and co-starred with his friend Harry Belafonte in the Western Buck and the Preacher. The pair also appeared together in the 1974 comedy Uptown Saturday Night, the first of several Poitier-directed efforts that featured Bill Cosby. In 1980, Poitier helmed the Richard Pryor\u2013Gene Wilder comedy Stir Crazy, which became the highest grossing film by an African American director for many years.\n\n'Shoot to Kill' and Other Late Roles\n\nAfter a roughly 10-year absence from the big screen as an actor, in 1988 Poitier returned with a pair of dramas \u2014 Shoot to Kill and Little Nikita. Other notable later films include Sneakers (1992) and One Man, One Vote (1997). On the small screen, Poitier earned accolades for portraying some of history's famous men. He played U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall in Separate but Equal in 1991 and opposite Michael Caine as South African leader Nelson Mandela in Mandela and De Klerk in 1997.\n\nBooks and Honors\n\nTurning his attention to sharing his many personal experiences, Poitier in 2000 published The Measure of a Man, which was billed as a spiritual autobiography. That same year he picked up a Grammy Award for best spoken word album for the audio version of the book. He later shared his years of wisdom for future generations with 2008's Life Beyond Measure: Letters to My Great-Granddaughter.\n\nPoitier received numerous honors during his legendary career. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the British Empire in 1974, which entitles him to use the title \"sir,\" though he chooses not to do so. In 2009 he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama. Two years later he was feted by the Film Society of Lincoln Center, earning the organization's Chaplin Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nPoitier also served as non-resident Bahamian ambassador to Japan and to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.\n\nMarriages and Children\n\nPoitier was married to Juanita Hardy from 1950 to 1965, and together they had four children: Beverly Poitier-Henderson, Pamela Poitier, Sherri Poitier and Gina Poitier. He is currently married to Canadian-born actress Joanna Shimkus, and they have two children, Anika Poitier and Sydney Tamiia Poitier.\n\nDeath\n\nPoitier died on January 6, 2022. He was 94.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Sidney Poitier\n\nBirth Year: 1927\n\nBirth date: February 20, 1927\n\nBirth State: Florida\n\nBirth City: Miami\n\nBirth Country: United States\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: Hollywood icon Sidney Poitier was the first African American to win an Academy Award for Best Actor, receiving the honor in 1964 for his performance in 'Lilies of the Field.'\n\nIndustries\n\nFilm\n\nAstrological Sign: Pisces\n\nSchools\n\nAmerican Negro Theater\n\nDeath Year: 2022\n\nDeath date: January 6, 2022\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION\n\nArticle Title: Sidney Poitier Biography\n\nAuthor: Biography.com Editors\n\nWebsite Name: The Biography.com website\n\nUrl: https://www.biography.com/actors/sidney-poitier\n\nAccess Date:\n\nPublisher: A&E; Television Networks\n\nLast Updated: January 7, 2022\n\nOriginal Published Date: April 3, 2014\n\nQUOTES"}, {"url": "https://hollywooddynamics.com/i-want-to-move-to-la-to-pursue-an-acting-career/", "page_content": "I'm a 21-year-old Irish girl with a career in music and an international stage touring experience. It's safe to say my dream is to move to LA to pursue an acting career.\n\nIt's a long shot, to be fair, but I'm not going to let it stop me.\n\nHere are a few things I've learnt along the way to help get me where I want to be.\n\n1. Work out your living arrangements\n\nThis may be the most important step you could ever take. You don't want to become a sharecropper living with a string of friends and acquaintances you don't really know.\n\nYou also don't want to buy a bunch of furniture to unpack into a flat you'll be moving out of in a couple of weeks.\n\nBuy a bed, bedding, a dresser, a desk, a mattress, and some other things you'll need as your budget allows.\n\nThen buy a storage locker or a container to store your stuff in for up to six months.\n\nEven if you have to live in a city centre apartment for a while, make sure you have a spot to stash everything you'll need to sustain yourself until you can figure out how to make a living.\n\nIf you can't swing a storage unit or a container, stay with someone you know, or crash with a friend temporarily while you figure out your next move.\n\nYou'll end up saving a lot of money and it will give you more of an opportunity to see what's what.\n\n2. Get a good computer\n\nI know I said you don't want to buy a bunch of furniture, but that's because you want to save money on moving. So instead of buying a couch and a desk and stuff, go to Kmart or Bunnings and buy a cheap computer.\n\nThis will give you a good computer to start with, and then you can decide whether you want to buy a new one, upgrade to a nice one, or save up for a nice one.\n\nIf you can afford a computer and monitor, this will be your best option.\n\n3. Go back to school\n\nThis might not be what you think, but it will also be a good way to save up some money. You'll need a high school diploma to work in a lot of the roles that are available in LA.\n\nIf you want to move, you'll need to start in some entry level job. If you want to move, you'll need to have an entry level job that will start you in the working world.\n\nSo take some time off, or go back to school. You'll save loads of money and time, and you'll end up with a better work ethic than I did.\n\n4. Keep a blog\n\nI used to write a blog about all my adventures in music and travel. So I kept a blog of all my different locations. It made me feel like I had a different life than everyone else.\n\nI could relate to all the people from all the places I went. It gave me perspective.\n\nYou can do this too. It'll get your life on the map and put your face in front of a lot of people who will be curious about you.\n\nPlus, if you can update your website or a blog once every two weeks and email it to people, you're only spending $10 on a monthly hosting and you're building your own audience that way.\n\nSo give it a go.\n\n5. Make a Facebook page\n\nThis is something a lot of people don't know how to do because they are either too proud or don't know how to make something that isn't Facebook.\n\nTo start with, I made a website to promote my book, Flanders Fields. It was basically my book review section.\n\nSo anyone that wanted to check out the book, I linked them to that page, and then at the end I put a link to my Facebook page.\n\nPeople can only book me if they know me on Facebook, and I started out by being active on the page and building a following.\n\nIt was the beginning of my online writing career, and by the time I got around to writing Flanders Fields, I had over 100 likes. Now, I still work my book reviews and events page every few weeks.\n\nI don't do it as much as I should anymore, but I get it updated once or twice a month, and it's only a couple of hundred dollars a month.\n\nYou can also start a Facebook page and put up a one or two sentence paragraph every now and then about your life.\n\nThe idea is to get people to like it so that when you come around with an opportunity, you have an audience of interested people ready to hear about your business.\n\n6. Find a new passion\n\nSome people have a thing, like photography. Or playing video games.\n\nOr making stuff. You should find something that gives you an artistic outlet.\n\nNot everyone is cut out to be a scientist. For me, music was it. You have to find something that you can create that people will love.\n\nI don't mean make something people will love, but just create something people will love.\n\nSomething you can't stop doing and something that's your life's work. If you haven't discovered what your passion is yet, then it's still worth looking.\n\n7. Join one of the free food groups\n\nI joined a free food group where people would cook a massive meal and everyone came over for some eats. It got so big we had to have people mail in their RSVP via Dropbox, and you'd have over 20 people showing up to eat.\n\nSo you want to be involved with a group where people can't stop asking you what they can bring, so it becomes your responsibility to make sure they don't feel bad about bringing something.\n\nI tried that a couple of times but no one was into that. I tried to start a real, organised, paid for dinner and people just refused to come.\n\nThe worst was when I asked if someone could bring hot water for my tea when I was having a late night.\n\nWhen I suggested I would come over and make some tea for her, she was happy to come over with hot water.\n\nEveryone's busy these days, but it's probably not that hard to get started. You don't need to have a massive group.\n\nJust make sure it's one where you can see people that you want to see. A couple of friends that you're always trying to catch up with.\n\nYou'll probably be happier for it.\n\n8. Set up a domain for your online store\n\nWith book sales, there are literally hundreds of different Amazon stores.\n\nIf you start your store from scratch, and you don't buy a domain, you're going to spend forever figuring out where you put that fucking \"buy\" button.\n\nHow the hell do you know what products sell best when you only have a couple of books?\n\nAnd that's why you need a domain.\n\nPeople will make it hard for you to sell if you don't give them a way to do it.\n\nOn your own domain, you can set up an \"add to cart\" or \"buy\" button that will let people browse your book, and then checkout."}, {"url": "https://www.fame10.com/entertainment/15-celebrities-who-dropped-out-of-college-to-pursue-acting-careers/", "page_content": "For many people, college is essential.

If so, should you move to Atlanta?\n\nLet\u2019s talk about that.\n\nBack in 2015, when I was still living in Ohio, I had no idea the film industry even existed in Atlanta. If you\u2019re the same way, then let me help you out and give you a brief history lesson.\n\nIn 2008, Georgia passed a tax credit that gave productions a huge financial incentive to bring their projects to the state. With dollar signs in their eyes, Hollywood producers started bringing big budget productions to Georgia, the vast majority of them to the Atlanta area.\n\nSo now fast forward to 2020. What has happened in Georgia in the past decade? Well, it\u2019s been reported that film and television production has grown to become a $9.5 billion industry in the state.\n\nIn 2016, the year I moved to Atlanta, more major feature films were made in Georgia than in California. Let that sink in.\n\nAnd the movies made in Georgia aren\u2019t some obscure films you\u2019ve never heard of. They are often some of the biggest box office blockbusters year after year including the highest grossing movie of all time, Avengers: Endgame. Yep, shot in Pinewood Studios just south of Atlanta.\n\nProjects Shot in Georgia Since 2008\n\nLet me give you a few more examples of films that were made in Georgia in the past decade.\n\nAvengers Infinity War\n\nAvengers Endgame\n\nBlack Panther\n\nAnt man\n\nAnt man and The Wasp\n\nSpiderman Homecoming\n\nVenom\n\nCaptain America Civil War\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol 2\n\nHidden Figures\n\nSully\n\nPassengers\n\nGodzilla King of Monsters\n\nFast Five\n\nFurious 7\n\nThe Fate of the Furious\n\nI, Tonya\n\nThe Accountant\n\nBad Moms Christmas\n\nHunger Games Catching Fire\n\nHunger Games Mocking Jay\n\nTAG\n\nDoctor Sleep\n\nBaby Driver\n\nPitch Perfect 3\n\nZombieland 2\n\nRichard Jewel\n\nAnd many many many more.\n\nOh wait, those were just the movies. I didn\u2019t mention any shows from the past decade. Ok, well, how about\n\nThe Walking Dead\n\nStranger Things\n\nOzark\n\nThe Vampire Diaries\n\nThe Originals\n\nThe Gifted\n\nMacGyver\n\nThe Resident\n\nGood Girls\n\nKevin Probably Saves the World\n\nCouncil of Dads\n\nDoom Patrol\n\nInsatiable\n\nCobra Kai\n\nDrop Dead Diva\n\nDynasty\n\nTales\n\nBeing Mary Jane\n\nWatchmen\n\nBrockmire\n\nStar Girl\n\nAtlanta\n\nBlack Lightning\n\nLodge 49\n\nHalt and Catch Fire\n\nLegacies\n\nPLUS. ALL of Tyler Perry\u2019s movies and television shows being produced in his massive 330 acre studio log right in the heart of Atlanta.\n\nAll of that and more has happened in Georgia since 2008. Crazy huh?\n\nWhat Does All This Mean for You?\n\nOk, so now back to our original question: Should you move to Atlanta for acting?\n\nWell, ultimately, this is a very personal question and not one that I can answer for you. But what I can do is give you as much information as possible to help you make an informed decision that\u2019s right for your particular situation.\n\nHere are some factors that you should take into consideration before deciding to move to Atlanta.\n\nFirst of all, if you\u2019re still worried that Atlanta is too small of a market compared to say, New York or LA, even though I just gave you that huge list of movies and shows shot here, if you\u2019re still worried that Atlanta doesn\u2019t have enough opportunities for actors, let me put that to rest right now.\n\nThe amount of opportunity here is not just good, it\u2019s actually kind of mind blowing. The sheer volume of auditions I started getting when I first moved here was\u2026 it was actually a bit overwhelming at first.\n\nOf course, I was hoping for more auditions after I moved - especially in TV and film - but even then, it still far exceeded my expectations. Let\u2019s run through some numbers really quick.\n\nHere are the number of film and TV auditions that I\u2019ve received year by year since 2011.\n\nNumber of Film and Television Auditions I Received\n\n\n\n2011 - 1 (I was still living in Ohio at this point)\n\n2012 - 0\n\n2013 - 0\n\n2014 - 3\n\n2015 - 7\n\n2016 - 76 (Moved to Georgia)\n\n2017 - 105\n\n2018 - 92\n\n2019 - 110\n\nWow. I have no other words. I went from getting around one or two film and television auditions per year to over a hundred! 110 auditions in 2019 that\u2019s one every three days!\n\nSo, when I say the amount of opportunity in Atlanta is kind of mind blowing, that\u2019s not an exaggeration. if you\u2019re an actor thinking about moving to Atlanta to further your career and your biggest hangup is that you\u2019re worried about the amount of opportunity, stop worrying. There is a TON going on in Atlanta right now.\n\nAnd if anyone tells you that you HAVE to move to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career, they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. They have no clue.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t move to LA; of course you can. There\u2019s obviously plenty of opportunity for actors in LA as well. I\u2019m just saying there are other options out there. And Atlanta happens to be one of the BEST options.\n\nAtlanta vs. Los Angeles\n\nIs Atlanta Better than LA? Well, that\u2019s an even trickier question because what\u2019s better for one person may not be for someone else. So you\u2019re going to have to define \u201cbetter\u201d for yourself.\n\nBut I will say this, I think for actors who are newer to the industry and who are in the early stages of their careers, Atlanta is a better option than LA.\n\nWhy? Well, for starters, there are fewer barriers to entry in Atlanta. Meaning it\u2019s going to be a little bit easier for a newer actor to get the ball rolling in Atlanta than in LA.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a little bit easier to get their first agent. It\u2019s going to be a little bit easier to get their first auditions. It\u2019s going to be a little bit easier to book their first job. It\u2019s going to be easier because\n\nFewer actors overall. While the population of actors here in Atlanta is growing daily, it still isn\u2019t anywhere near as saturated as LA\n\nAgents here are more willing to take a chance on someone with no experience and are unlikely to completely dismiss someone who has no credits on their resume. In LA, it\u2019s not uncommon for agents to want to see multiple television credits on your resume before they\u2019d be willing to meet with you.\n\nAlso, Atlanta is a Self tape market. The vast majority of our auditions are going to be self taped rather than in person. Now this has advantages and disadvantages but one of the main advantages is that casting directors get to see more actors when they are accepting self tapes. And if you\u2019re a newer actor, that means you\u2019re more likely to get a chance to audition.\n\nAnother reason why Atlanta might be more desirable than LA is the cost of living. The median rent in LA for a 1 bedroom apartment is $2,362. The median rent in Atlanta for a 1 bedroom is $1,590.\n\nIf you're looking to buy, the median home price in Atlanta is $210k compared to $634k in LA.\n\nI\u2019ve heard so many stories of actors who move to LA, blow through all their savings in less than one year, and have to move back home because they can\u2019t afford it.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to break into this business no matter where you are. If breaking into the industry in LA is like fighting a 400lb gorilla. Then breaking in to the industry in Atlanta is like fighting that gorilla\u2019s slightly smaller younger sibling. Either way, you\u2019re still fighting a gorilla. It\u2019s not gonna be easy. But, if given the choice, I\u2019d want to fight the smaller one.\n\nWho Should Go to LA Instead of Atlanta?\n\nOk, so those were some reasons to go to Atlanta. What are some reasons you might want to go to LA instead?\n\nHollywood has a mystique. There\u2019s a romantic idea of moving to Hollywood. If you\u2019re in love with the idea of pursuing your dream in Hollywood, the way the movie La La Land portrays it, then there\u2019s probably nothing I can say that will convince you that any other place might be a better option for your career.\n\nDo you want the lifestyle of LA? Do you want the weather of LA? Do you want to surf every day? Run into a studio exec at a coffee shop? You're not going to get any of that in any other market than LA.\n\nWhat about some actual industry related reasons? Well, if you want to be on a sit-com or a soap opera. LA is the place to be. There are currently (in 2020) zero sit-coms or soap operas being shot in Georgia. So if you are strategically targeting those types of projects above anything else, you will be much better off in Los Angeles.\n\nI should also point out that there is absolutely nothing wrong with moving to LA later in your career. Nobody says that you have to pick a city and live there forever. I know plenty of actors who have moved to LA later on in their careers after they established themselves as bookable actors in Atlanta.\n\nThat being said, I also know actors that were consistently working in LA but elected to move to Atlanta because of the lower cost of living.\n\nMake an Informed Decision\n\nThis post may seem a bit biases because I live in Atlanta, but the last thing I want to do is to twist your arm into moving here. I just want to provide you with information so that you can make a better educated choice when you do decide to move.\n\nI\u2019ve been in Atlanta since 2016 and I have no plans to move to LA, to New York, or anywhere else for that matter. I get great auditions. I\u2019m booking. I get to work on some of the biggest films and television shows in the world. On top of that, I can afford to own a home.\n\nLastly, I LOVE the creative community in Atlanta. From the actors, to the acting teachers, to the agents, to the casting directors, everyone is so unbelievably supportive of one another. In a career that can feel very isolating, knowing that your peers are rooting for you and have your back can make a huge difference.\n\nWherever you decide to go, I wish you the best of luck.

Driver told The Associated Press Wednesday it was his time in the service that gave him the courage he needed to become an actor.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem like a realistic job where I was from, and there wasn\u2019t really a lot of opportunities,\u201d explained Driver. \u201cBut the military kind of stripped you away from \u2013 I think, even if it is an illusion \u2013 being scared of the civilian world.\u201d\n\nHe served for almost three years before being discharged due to an injury. He didn't get a chance to be deployed, Time reported.\n\nDriver said his time in the service helped tear down some of the inhibitions he endured while attempting to pursue an acting career. He even relocated to New York City, convincing himself that if his efforts failed, he\u2019d be OK on the streets.\n\n\u201cYou have that kind of like survival mentality in the military,\u201d said the star. \u201cIt gives you a lot of confidence going back out into the world.\u201d\n\nAnd even though Driver would go on to find fame, he never forgot his roots. Not long after Driver kicked off his acting career, he took action to help his fellow military veterans with his charity, Arts in the Armed Forces. According to the outlet, the organization is dedicated to providing arts programming for active duty service members, veterans, as well as military support staff and their families.\u201d\n\n'BLACKKKLANSMAN' STAR ADAM DRIVER RECALLS KKK PRESENCE IN INDIANA HOMETOWN\n\nDriver insisted he hates the perception that military personnel won\u2019t understand theater.\n\n\u201cIf anything, theater in New York can get a little bit like recycled air,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s amazing how much you take it outside of New York, the language becomes a weapon in a way to different communities [Theater] can help you articulate a feeling in a way that you didn\u2019t have the language for before. And what better community to share that with than the military?\u201d\n\nAnd Driver is always open to new challenges. Most recently, he\u2019s tackling a Lanford Wilson play titled \u201cBurn This,\u201d a 1987 revival about a group of friends and family coping with a tragedy. Driver stars opposite Keri Russell.\n\n\u201cWe only had like three weeks, so to be patient and trust that it would come together eventually was really difficult,\u201d Driver admitted about preparing for his newest role. \u201cI love the potential that it could be a disaster at any minute. You have eight shows a week to try to keep exploring. I love that part of it.\u201d\n\nAnd the efforts are paying off.\n\nADAM DRIVER TALKS 'STAR WARS' ROLE\n\nDriver has received his first Tony nomination for his work on \u201cBurn This,\u201d his third show on Broadway. He was home alone doing the dishes when his agent called with the news about the nod. But since his wife was out of town, Driver had no one to share the news. So he just finished the dishes.\n\nIn 2017, Driver stirred headlines for a completely different reason. He shocked a military family when he turned up to present them with college scholarship for their daughter.\n\nIn a video posted on social media, Driver was spotted driving to Brodheadsville, Penn., where he delivered a scholarship to Hayley Grace Williams, who is studying to become a nurse. Her father was injured during a training exercise before Operation Desert Storm.\n\nThe scholarship came from a partnership between Budweiser and Folds of Honor, a foundation that provides educational scholarships for the children and spouses of disabled and fallen service men and women.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}]}
