Mikel Arteta\u2019s side have nine games left to negotiate as they aim to hold off Manchester City and win the Premier League title for the first time since 2004.\n\nWith Liverpool languishing in eighth place and in the midst of a miserable season, they may never have a better chance of winning at Anfield. Arteta is unlikely to put much weight on the club\u2019s record at Anfield, but it is surprisingly poor.\n\nThe last six Premier League games at Anfield between the two sides have all been won by Liverpool, who have scored 22 goals to Arsenal \u2019s meagre tally of four. The Gunners have not won in the league at Liverpool since way back in September 2012 \u2013 but they did draw back in January 2016.\n\nThe match, on Wednesday, January 16, finished 3-3 following a 90th-minute equaliser from Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen. Three of the current Liverpool squad started that day: Jordan Henderson, James Milner and Roberto Firmino.\n\nBy contrast, none of Arsenal\u2019s starters that day remain at the club. But Arteta will know all about that game, having come on as a late substitute. But for the rest of us, who didn\u2019t play that day, here is the last Arsenal XI to avoid defeat at Liverpool.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nPetr Cech\n\nThe goalkeeper for Arsenal that day was Cech, who was in the first season of his four years at Arsenal after leaving Chelsea. He stayed until 2019 when he retired and moved back to Chelsea as a technical and performance advisor.\n\nThe 40-year-old left Chelsea last summer after the Todd Boehly takeover and now spends much of his time on the ice. Cech now plays for the Chelmsford Chieftains after previously playing for Guildford Phoenix.\n\nHector Bellerin\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe Spaniard was a fan favourite at Arsenal between 2013 and 2022. After spending the 2021/22 season out on loan with Real Betis, he was signed by Barcelona in September.\n\nBellerin joined Sporting on loan in January and is facing an uncertain future, with another move on the cards this summer.\n\nLaurent Koscielny\n\nKoscielny was a familiar presence at the heart of Arsenal\u2019s defence for nine years, between 2010 and 2019. The Frenchman made a whopping 353 appearances for the club before moving back to his homeland with Bordeaux.\n\nHe announced his retirement in March last year and was forced to strongly deny allegations of racism, which had cast a shadow over his final days as a professional.\n\nPer Mertesacker\n\nMertesacker was Koscielny\u2019s long-time partner at the back for Arsenal. The giant German retired back in 2018, after seven years at Arsenal \u2013 but he hasn\u2019t ventured far.\n\nStill only 38, Mertesacker is now the head of the Gunners\u2019 academy, where he is overseeing the development of the next generation.\n\nNacho Monreal\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nAnother long-serving player, Monreal played for Arsenal for six years, between 2013 and 2019. He left for Real Sociedad, where he played for three years before retiring in 2022 due to a knee injury.\n\nHe said at the time: \"My knee sends me a message\u2026 loud and clear; I cannot continue! Do I get mad? NO! I listen to it and accept the situation and thank it for everything. A stage is over. Another starts. I'm happy and feeling good. One more time\u2026 I FEEL GOOD!!! And that gives me peace of mind.\"\n\nAaron Ramsey\n\nRamsey scored Arsenal\u2019s opening goal that day. And the world appeared to be at his feet when he signed for Juventus in 2019, with the Italian club handing him a gigantic contract. But it has not worked out well for the Welsh midfielder.\n\nHe made just 70 appearances in three years in Turin, with injuries limiting him to six goals and six assists in that time. He was loaned to Rangers last year and has now joined Nice, where he plays alongside Ross Barkley and Arsenal loanee Nicolas Pepe.\n\nMathieu Flamini\n\nFlamini spent three years at Arsenal before moving to Crystal Palace and Getafe. He retired from football in 2018 and has embarked upon a remarkable business career ever since \u2013 one which has made him extremely rich.\n\nThe 39-year-old Frenchman set up GF Biochemicals in 2008 out of concern for the planet's future and last year became the chief executive of the biochemical startup he co-founded.\n\nJoel Campbell\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nCampbell, who picked up an assist against Liverpool that day, has played for 11 different clubs \u2013 and he\u2019s still only 30 years old. The Costa Rican winger was loaned out six times during his spell at Arsenal and only made 40 appearances in seven years at the club.\n\nHe is now on loan at Monterey from fellow Mexican side Leon. He has two goals and four assists in 30 games this season.\n\nMesut Ozil\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nOzil left Arsenal under a cloud after failing out of favour at the club. He left for Fenerbahce, but his time in Turkey never went to plan. He moved on to Istanbul Basaksehir before retiring last month.\n\nHe said: \"I've had the privilege to be a professional football player for almost 17 years now and I feel incredibly thankful for the opportunity. But in recent weeks and months, having also suffered some injuries, it's become more and more clear that it's time to leave the big stage of football.\u201d\n\nTheo Walcott\n\nWalcott was at Arsenal for 12 years following a move from Southampton in 2006.

He was born on the 10th of September, 1985 in Tulle. Koscielny is a center back who is currently the vice-captain of the English Premier League team Arsenal.\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchman began his career with Guingamp in 2004 which has produced players like Didier Drogba and Florent Malouda. Koscielny played as a fullback for Guingamp in most of the matches.However, he felt that center back was his forte and this made him join Tours FC to take a chance at center back.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his debut season with Tours FC in 2007, Koscielny showed remarkable progress and played a major role in his team\u2019s promotion to Ligue 1. He was also named in the best XI of the season.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe center back continued his good form with Lorient FC in 2009 where he was regarded as one of the best players in his position. He was developing reputation as a clever and an agile defender. His achievements and footballing potential attracted Arsenal, ultimately moving to the Premier League side for a fee of \u00a38.45 million the following season.\n\n\n\n\n\nDebut\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurent Koscielny had the opportunity to represent Poland but decided to ply his trade with France. He made his first appearance for France on the 9th of February, 2011 in a friendly match against United States. Koscielny played the entire game and his side sealed a 1-0 victory. On the 4th of June, 2016, Koscielny scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland.\n\n\n\n\n\nRise to Glory\n\n\n\n\n\nKoscielny had a great debut season with Arsenal. He was constantly making great tackles and preventing the opposition from penetrating their back line. In 2011, Koscielny had one of his best performances till date that saw Arsenal beat Barcelona 2-1 in the round of 16 Champions League tie.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchman was a great asset to the team as apart from acting as a defender, he had a great goal scoring ability. Till date, Koscielny has scored 24 goals for Arsenal. He is the highest scoring defender for Arsenal in the history of EPL. He is regarded as one of the most important players for Arsenal in the past seven years.\n\n\n\n\n\nKoscielny has won the FA Cup with Arsenal in 2014, 2015 and 2017. He has also won the FA Community Shield in 2014, 2015 and 2017. The center back has made a major contribution in his team\u2019s success in the FA Cup over the years.\n\n\n\n\n\nLow Points\n\n\n\n\n\nKoscielny has got more than thirty yellow cards and as many as five red cards. This has forced him out of a few crucial encounters and has affected the team\u2019s performance. He has missed more games due to suspension and not because of injury.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe center back must work on preventing harsh tackles so as to represent Arsenal in more and more games and increase their chances of winning more trophies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchman is yet to win the Premier League with Arsenal. Although he has won six titles at Arsenal, the coveted Premier League title has eluded him."}, {"url": "https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/news/laurent-koscielny-arsenal-transfer-announcement-20658325", "page_content": "Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nSign up to the free Arsenal newsletter so you don't miss the latest Gunners news, straight to your inbox\n\nLaurent Koscielny enjoyed an extremely successful nine seasons with Arsenal.\n\nBut after three FA Cup triumphs and 353 appearances for the Gunners, Koscielny decided to end his time in England and made the move to return to his native France in the summer of 2019.\n\nThe veteran defender left in controversial fashion, refusing to take part in his side's pre-season tour of the United States, after a bitter dispute with the club over his future, with one year remaining on his contract.\n\nInstead, he decided to stay at home in London having asked the club to release him from his contract, despite Arsenal not wanting to let Koscielny leave on a free transfer.\n\nClick for Sound Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will auto-play soon 8 Cancel Play now Mikel Arteta On Martin Odegaard's Quality\n\nHis actions led to a statement being issued by Arsenal expressing their disappointment, adding that the Frenchman had acted against clear instructions.\n\nEventually, the Gunners parted ways with their captain for a reported \u00a34.6 million fee as Koscielny joined French club, Bordeaux, on a three-year deal, with the defender upsetting fans further with his announcement video in France, peeling off an Arsenal shirt to unveil the Bordeaux jersey.\n\nHis current side sits 13th in Ligue 1 just two points off the relegation play-off spot with one game to go.\n\nAhead of his team's final day fixture with Reims, the 35-year-old has opened up on his future in football.\n\n\u201cI need to be 100% sure that we are in Ligue 1.
