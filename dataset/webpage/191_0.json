My father was a Realtor in Calgary for almost 10 years before moving to Vancouver where he is currently a licensed agent. After only 6 months in the Real Estate industry, my mom had to quit her day job to become my dad\u2019s full time Assistant. I consider myself a Calgarian having lived here since 1989. Before moving to Calgary, we immigrated to Brandon Manitoba.\n\nI didn\u2019t know it then, but my training actually started in high school. Over dinner my parents would discuss real estate stories and news excessively. My dad had the most amazing stories, some I still tell my clients today. My meticulous father is one of the most competent, dutiful and loyal Agents I\u2019ve ever worked with. He truly put his clients first in business. I\u2019m proud to have him as my first mentor stepping into this industry.\n\nAlthough I officially launched my Real Estate career in 2005, I would say the seed of my passion for Real Estate was planted when I purchased my home in 2001. I was 21. Like most buyers, I made extensive sacrifices to buy my first home, including selling my first beloved motorcycle, and working 3 jobs simultaneously for a full year to save up. I couldn\u2019t sleep the night before my possession. I was giddy and excited, overdosed on Better Homes & Garden magazines (Pinterest did not exist in 2001). When my Agent/dad handed me the keys to my first house, the exhilaration I felt is a high a chase through my clients until this very day. When I hand my clients their keys for the first time, I feel the same giddiness and excitement for them. Every hurdle my clients have crossed to buy a home, all the hours spent scrutinizing properties with me by their side, all their dreams come into fruition in this very moment. Whether is a purchase or sale, it\u2019s a big deal. I take my job with all of it\u2019s giddiness seriously.\n\nPrior to obtaining my license to be Realtor, I was a bilingual assistant (ESL), server & bartender, entrepreneur with phone books (if you meet me, ask me about this hilarious 3 year period of my life), and a 3rd year university drop out \u2013 computer science major. I finally had to accept that hours in a lab working on assignments and programming was not me. I craved interaction and found I enjoyed my shifts at Red Lobster more than heading to lectures at the University. Oh and in 2012 I took most of that year off of full time Real Estate. I went back to College. This time Fairview College for my motorcycle mechanics certificate. After I finished, I was employed to work on motorcycles as a junior mechanic 4 days a week while working part time as a Real Estate Agent around those hours. I learned a lot from that experience but mostly my appreciation for my Real Estate career was solidified by the end of 2012.\n\nAt the end of 2012 I joined a mega team. Although I benefited from the success of consistently being one of the top producers on that team, and achieving multiple awards, I was missing something. Remember, I value interaction. Being that busy and closing that many deals in a year, the quality of relationship I had with my clients was not to my satisfaction. There\u2019s a difference between service and relationship. You can have the best of both with the right Agent.\n\nAs of January 1st 2017, I\u2019m a proud Realtor and Managing Partner of The Good Agent Inc. We are well aware of all the reasons people shy aware from Realtors \u2013 we are here to change that!\n\nIn June of 2017, from the help of my wonderful new found work/life balance I was able to achieve, I got married and started a family all at once. I now have one more skill to add to my list of Real Estate Agent skills \u2013 being able to see a home through practical mom eyes. Life is good!"}, {"url": "https://thecinemafiles.com/2017/03/18/5982/", "page_content": "We recently sat down with Adam Collis, Director and Producer of the upcoming Arizona film \u201cCar Dogs\u201d What makes this film special, besides being filmed entirely in Arizona, is that it was made in partnership with the Arizona State University Spark Program. This program utilized a number of ASU students and interns in the creation of the film, offering them invaluable real-world experience.\n\nTCF: Saw the film yesterday, and was really impressed with it. I thought it was fun!\n\nAdam Collis: That\u2019s great. But did you know that that movie was made with 85 students learning feature film making from an Oscar winning cast and crew?\n\nI\u2019ve heard that. I\u2019ve been reading some of the press releases on it.\n\nThat lot was a dilapidated, abandoned dealership with no cars in it.\n\nI was wondering about that. I knew the lot existed but wasn\u2019t sure if it was still going. So how did you get that location, the cars\u2013?\n\nI love that you ask that, \u2019cause I haven\u2019t had a chance to share this story very much. Finding your location when you\u2019re directing a movie is \u2013 for me \u2013 a deeply \u2013 almost spiritual moment. It\u2019s this incredibly meaningful moment. Because it\u2019s the moment where \u2013 the movie that\u2019s been in your head \u2013 all of a sudden, becomes real. I have this thing that I teach my \u2013 all of my film students. It\u2019s called, \u201cthe gap.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe gap\u201d is the abyss that exists between the perfect movie that\u2019s in your head, and the movie you\u2019re able to get onto the screen. And bridging that gap is incredibly difficult. Especially in cinema. There are logistical obstacles, there\u2019re technical obstacles. There\u2019re aesthetic obstacles. But when you\u2019re able to find your location, that\u2019s the first big step that you take to bridging the gap from the perfect\u2013 Because we all have that. I\u2019m sure you have a dozen movies that in your mind are just, \u201cOh my God, this would be so great.\u201d\n\nAbsolutely, yeah.\n\nAnd when it gets articulated, it\u2019s like, \u201cOh my gosh, here\u2019s the set.\u201d And that\u2019s them moment that I had over there on McDowell, right? When I saw this location. I was like, \u201cThis is perfect.\u201d And you \u2013 when you\u2019re making films \u2013 maybe you\u2019ve made some films, and you know what it is to have a location agent. Man, we had a few location agents. This gem of a human being named Rich Heinrich R-I-C-H H-E-I-N-R-I-C-H. And I give that spelling, because man that dude deserves a shout out. Like he saw that we were doing something special and he could feel it. And it was like, \u201cThank you. I\u2019m going to be your location agent. I\u2019m going to help you figure out how to make this and move forward.\u201d\n\nIt was really a special moment for me. \u2018Cause it\u2019s such a great location. All these weird angles and these windows that look out on the Papago Mountains. This is a big Arizona story man, that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to tell people. The film was written by a guy from Scottsdale. Went to ASU. The movie\u2019s set in Scottsdale, based on his like growing up in a dealership in Arizona, right? Shot in Arizona, made by a bunch of students from ASU. Being screened exclusively by Arizona\u2019s own Harkins. I think there\u2019s a great Arizona story that\u2019s being told here, with this new film commissioner we\u2019re hearing about. I think that this could be the beginning of a real explosion of Hollywood invading Arizona. And I\u2019m hoping that this little project that we did can help trigger some of that.\n\nExactly. Now you\u2019ve mentioned Mark King who was the writer of the story, actually grew up in this world of car sales. Watching the film, I immediately wondered how much research had been done because the behind the scenes action seemed very authentic.\n\nIt\u2019s totally real, \u2019cause of Mark. And it\u2019s not biographical per say. I want to protect Mark in that regard. \u2018Cause he always emphasizes, \u201cIt\u2019s not biographical.\u201d But he knew that world inside and out. So it gives this incredibly authentic look behind the scenes, into a world that everybody can relate to. The world of buying a car. Buying a car is an American pastime, man. It\u2019s an American rite of passage. Everybody can relate, right?\n\nIt\u2019s like \u2013 the only 2 things that are more American than buying a car are apple pie and baseball. Then next thing on a list is buying a car. And that\u2019s where I think people really enjoy being able to watch the film and go like, \u201cOh my God.\u201d Everybody can relate to the feeling \u2013 going to buy a car, wondering, \u201cDid I get a good deal, or did I get played?\u201d Car Dogs is a film that shows you whether you got a good deal or got played.\n\nWell you always get played, right? Every time.\n\nPresumably, but as George Lopez liked to say, \u201cThe customer\u2019s always got to feel like they got a good deal.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/movies/billgoodykoontz/2017/03/23/car-dogs-director-adam-collis-interview-arizona-film/99524354/", "page_content": "Bill Goodykoontz\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK\n\nAdam Collis thinks big.\n\nThe director of \u201cCar Dogs,\u201d a dark comedy about a car dealership set in and filmed in Scottsdale that opens in Harkins Theatres across the Valley on Friday, March 24, envisions a lot of success for the film, but not just in the usual make-or-break box-office fashion. The amiable, chatty Collis has more in mind: reinventing the way independent film is made and financed.\n\nRELATED:Arizona-based 'Car Dogs' familiar but fun\n\nCollis, a film professor at Arizona State University, made the movie with 85 ASU interns, as part of the school\u2019s Film Spark program.

If it does well in Phoenix, the hope is that other markets will pick up the film.\n\nThings To Do app: Get the best in events, dining and travel right on your device\n\n\u201cThe really important idea for me is that the people of Phoenix have the chance to enjoy a super entertaining film that has Phoenix all over it \u2026 and in addition to going and watching an entertaining movie that has so much Phoenix in it, there\u2019s also this opportunity to launch a national release that didn\u2019t get launched out of LA or New York,\u201d Collis said. \u201cWe can do it right here. To me that\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nAnd more than that.\n\n\u201cThat is a transformative idea for independent cinema,\u201d Collis said, \u201cif we launch this movie out of Phoenix and all of a sudden Detroit says, what the heck is happening over there in Phoenix, we want to put the movie on our circuit, and all of a sudden a theater chain in Wisconsin says, what\u2019s that \u201cCar Dogs\u201d thing, I want that over here \u2013 and it starts here, at ASU and Phoenix? That changes the game for independent cinema, because that can create a model that we here in Phoenix will be the first mover on, and be able to replicate, but then other markets and other universities could do the same.\u201d\n\nThe film, whose cast includes George Lopez, Nia Vardalos, Octavia Spencer and several other actors whose faces you would recognize, if not their names, is set in a Scottsdale dealership owned by a jerk, played by Chris Mulkey, who will only offer his son (Patrick J. Adams) his own dealership if he and his team can sell 300 cars. In a lengthy interview recently, Collis talked about how the film, written by Mark Edward King, of Scottsdale, came about, and how high his hopes are for it.\n\nQuestion: What made you want to make the film?\n\nAnswer: First and foremost, it\u2019s always great to have a fun movie about a team of car salesmen trying to accomplish this impossible task of trying to sell more cars than have ever been sold in a single day. I go to the movies to be entertained, so to have the opportunity to do a movie that sat at the nexus between \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross\u201d and \u201cOcean\u2019s Eleven,\u201d that sounded like a lot of fun.\n\nThere\u2019s a whole variety of other reasons, not the least of which was the opportunity to explore the moral question of what are you willing to do? Are you willing to do whatever it takes to get what you want in business and in life? And what does that really mean? That\u2019s a big part of what motivated me to do the film.\n\nQ: It\u2019s certainly a relatable experience for most people.\n\nA: One of the most-compelling reasons was because I knew it was a movie everyone can relate to, because nearly everyone has bought a car. It\u2019s an emotional touch point for nearly every American. It\u2019s baseball, hot dogs and buying cars. That what it means to be an American, and the relatability of this car-buying experience was one of the things that really drew me to the material. But I don\u2019t want to be too highfalutin ... I do think that there is a compelling metaphor that the movie makes about the free-market society in which we live and the moral obligation that each of us has to do the right thing in order to have the freedom to preserve that free-market opportunity.\n\nQ: And you had ASU students helping on the set.\n\nA: We didn\u2019t just make a movie and give 85 students the chance to learn feature filmmaking from an Oscar-winning cast and crew. We built an entire supply chain. We built out soup-to-nuts a way to finance movies; the balances, risk and reward; a way to make a movie, where we have a teaching hospital for aspiring filmmakers; but the most important one is we built out an entire launch pad, which is effectively its release mechanism, where we\u2019re partnering with ASU and Harkins \u2026 to launch a movie that, if it gets into orbit, we have the opportunity to expand the release.\n\nQ: Do you have a memorable car-buying experience?\n\nA: The first time I ever bought a car, I actually brought \u2026 my best friend from film school with me. He grew up on a car lot. I said I\u2019ve never done this. I\u2019d just done \u201cSunset Strip\u201d (the first film Collis directed, released on 2000) and made a whole bunch of money and I need to get a vehicle, can you walk me through this? And sure enough, he was guiding me through every step, down to where the car salesman said, \u201cExcuse me, I need to go talk to my manager.\u201d He went to go talk to his manager and (his friend) turned to me and said, \u201cWhat are you willing to pay for this Subaru Outback?\u201d I said this much money. He said write that amount on a check, and when he comes back he\u2019s going to give you a number that\u2019s higher than that, almost certainly and you just need to slide the check across the table and say, \u201cThis is what I am prepared to pay for the car today.\u201d And it literally happened exactly like that. I slid the check across the table and (his friend) knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to resist having the check right there, and sure enough, they took it. And so that was a time that I actually had some guidance. But I think one of fun parts of the movie is making this fun for people who actually buy cars.\n\nQ: Yeah, as fun as that could ever be.\n\nA: What\u2019s been awesome, whether it was at the Phoenix Film Festival or other places we\u2019ve screened the film, is the universal response that I get when I see people walking out of the film and they know that I\u2019m the director and they kind of walk up to me with a big smile on their face and say, oh my God, that\u2019s exactly what happened to me! Or they walk up to me with that big grin on their face because they\u2019ve enjoyed the film and they say, oh my God, I\u2019m so glad I watched your film, I\u2019m about to buy a new car.\n\nQ: Did working with students ever slow down production?\n\nA: There\u2019s no question that it made the production longer. I think that Car Dogs LLC and our amazing investors were inspired by the opportunity to give students the chance to learn filmmaking from an Oscar-winning cast and crew, and they were incredibly generous in allowing us to make the film in Arizona, as opposed to making it in a state with a tax incentive. But the opportunity to give students this incredible experiential learning opportunity \u2026 was inspiring to people, and ASU really owes a debt of gratitude to our \u201cCar Dogs\u201d investors.\n\nYou know, there were some things that came up, just even like loss and damage, students dropping equipment, slowing down production, that we knew could be part of that equation.\n\nQ: They are students, but they\u2019re also part of a real production.\n\nA: By being able to learn in an academic environment, and also to be able to make mistakes without it costing you your job, that\u2019s huge. That\u2019s something I would tell students all the time. They\u2019d make a big gaffe, and it might even cost the production a little something, and I would look at them and I would say, \u201cWhat I\u2019m really happy about right now is that you got to learn from that mistake without having to lose your job. But I want you to know that in the real world that mistake might have cost you your job. And that\u2019s OK in this environment. And if you learn from it and it makes you a better professional when you get out in the real world, then this was all worth it.\u201d\n\nQ: Did it put extra pressure on you, as both director and professor?\n\nA: Day two, for whatever reason my amazing assistant director, Sean Hobin, for reasons that are still a little confusing to me, scheduled our most-complex day, and we had like 40 set-ups, it was the second day, the students were still working it out, and that was a moment where I was like, \u201cOh my God, with all these students are we going to get through this?\u201d But we got through that day and we made our day, and at the end of the production we got everything we wanted shot, and we made our budget, even with the students.\n\nQ: That\u2019s impressive. And the crew must have had to work a little differently, too, at least at first.\n\nA: Our cinematographer on day one asked one of the students to go get a sandbag about 50 yards away. And on a film set you never run, it\u2019s dangerous to run on a film set, but you have to walk with purpose. There is a briskness and speed at which you walk on a set. And so the student took the direction of the cinematographer, David Stump, and went sort of sidling off to get the sandbag as if they might be walking to go get a hoagie. And David just cupped his hands around his mouth and said, \u201cWALK WITH PURPOSE!\u201d\n\nThe students might cost you a little time, but at least they\u2019re excited to be there. They\u2019re really fired up, and they really want to be there. I think that while, sure, you had some on-the-job training that was going on, you had a bunch of students that were pumped.\n\nReach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontz@arizonarepublic.com.

The auto-sales industry is an intimidating one, in which consumer, salesman, dealership and manufacturer are all pitted against one another, each vying for the upper hand in this unnerving game of poker-faced manipulation and negotiation.\n\nFrom the consumer's perspective, the goal is to get the best deal possible \u2014 without getting the wool pulled over your eyes. But what really goes on behind the scenes? Unless you have inside knowledge, it's almost impossible to know.\n\nEnter \"Car Dogs.\"\n\nPlaying at 2 p.m. this Friday, at Hollywood 20, this feature film, starring Patrick J. Adams, Octavia Spencer, George Lopez and others, tells the story of a sales manager at a car dealership who's willing to do whatever it takes to get his own dealership.\n\nWritten by Mark Edward King, who grew up in the business, this film takes an inside look at the inner workings of an industry that everyone has some experience with, but likely very limited knowledge of.\n\nWe recently chatted with director, Adam Collis, who told us about the film's unique inception, the mystique surrounding car sales and how working with executive producer and Sarasota resident James Miller was \"a godsend.\"\n\nHow did this film come about?\n\nI was a visiting film professor at Arizona State University, and I wanted my students to have the opportunity to get production credits and be on a real film set. So, half jokingly, I said to my boss, \"Why don't we make a feature film?\"\n\nWell, he took me seriously. The next thing I knew, we were making a feature film with 85 Arizona State students and some major names attached to it. I was so proud that these students got to learn on an actual film set and not only get academic credit, but get their first feature-film credit; that's such a hard thing to get.\n\nHow did you land on this particular script?\n\nThat's another nice part of the story; the script writer was a student of mine from eight years prior. When he first showed it to me, it was a short, based on his own life. He grew up in Scottsdale, near Arizona State, working at a car dealership.\n\nI thought it was amazing, but he was never able to get it made. So when my boss was asking about scripts, it all came full circle, and I thought of that script from my former student.\n\nWhat about the script stood out to you?\n\nIt was so intense and dramatic. It really captured the drama and intensity of this universe, and it felt so authentic. It's a very exciting look behind the curtain of this industry that every American has encountered but probably doesn't know a lot about. Buying a car is almost a rite of passage in America, so it's fun to peek into that universe and see how things really work behind the scenes.\n\nWhy do you think people will be able to relate to the story?\n\nI think there are universal themes in the story. I love the look at the dog-eat-dog nature of ground-level capitalism. There's such an enormous ethical responsibility responsibility in order for capitalism to work correctly. At its core, this is a morality tale about the challenges that come with this particular industry.\n\nI think a lot of people will relate to the main character's journey, and his struggles with work and family. I think they'll also learn a lot about how this industry really works \u2014 the sales bonuses the salesman get and what goes into the negotiations and making the sale.\n\nWhat was the most interesting thing you learned about the car business?\n\nOh, man, I learned so much. It was really interesting to think that buying a car is sort of the last remaining consumer-level bartering system in America. You don't go to the grocery store and haggle over the price of your pack of gum. It's the one arena still like that, as far as mass consumption goes, and it's fascinating.\n\nI understand there's a Sarasota connection with this film; what was it like working with executive producer and Sarasota resident, James Miller?\n\nAre you familiar with the term, \"deus ex machina?\" It's an old Greek theatrical plot device, in which, at the last minute, a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly and miraculously fixed. It literally means \"machine of the gods.\"\n\nJames Miller was our deus ex machina. He was an absolute godsend, and he undoubtedly saved this film \u2014 period. We're forever grateful to him for all his help.\n\nWhat do you hope audiences will take away from the film?\n\nI hope they find it entertaining, fun and engaging, and maybe they'll stop and reflect on the work/family struggles in their own lives."}], "Adam Collis is a writer": [{"url": "https://dl.acm.org/profile/81350600091", "page_content": "Automatic normalization of author names is not exact.

A bit like a modern Glengarry Glen Ross, the film centers on an auto dealership that must sell 300 cars in 8 hours. In addition to being fast-paced and funny, Car Dogs features an all-star cast that includes Patrick J. Adams, Nia Vardalos, George Lopez, and Oscar-winner Octavia Spencer. Collis told us what it was like working this this stellar ensemble, getting a film made in Arizona, and giving several local filmmaking students the chance to study on an actual movie set.\n\nQ: Have you or anyone close to you ever worked as a car salesman before?\n\nA: The writer \u2013 who I consider to be a close friend \u2013 Mark Edward King actually spent a good deal of time as a car salesman. The only other person close to me that I know sold cars was actually my best friend from film school, Scott Derrickson, who directed Doctor Strange. Scott actually helped me buy my first car. So I was able to get a really good deal on a 1998 Subaru Outback.\n\nQ: Do you still have that car?\n\nA: No. It\u2019s funny that you ask because I eventually sold that car to my auto repair shop, which used it as their temporary car for people who left their cars at the shop. So I do see the old Outback from time to time.\n\nQ: Was the film always going to be set in Arizona?\n\nA: It was always set in Arizona, but we worked very hard to make sure it was shot in Arizona. That wasn\u2019t an easy task because most film productions shoot wherever\u2019s the cheapest to shoot. We felt the combination of grounding the film in those Papago Buttes, Papago Park, surrounding the dealership with those amazing mountains, and also giving our Arizona State University students the chance to learn filmmaking in this teaching hospital for aspiring filmmakers, we thought that was too good of an opportunity to pass up.\n\nQ: Is it safe to say that Glengarry Glen Ross was a big inspiration for this movie?\n\nA: To say the least. Glengarry Glen Ross was the ultimate sales movie. We had a very interesting way that we paid homage to Glengarry Glen Ross with the famous ABC Speech, the Always Be Closing Speech. Originally, the way it was scripted was that Mark the sales manager tells his right-hand man and best friend, Boyd, to go put on a \u201ctraining video.\u201d Then the joke was that Mark comes down to the conference room and the training video is Glengarry Glen Ross. We were too low budget of a film to get the rights to use a big movie, even if it was just a small portion of the movie. So we had to get creative. Now in the movie, the way it\u2019s done is rather than showing the clip from the movie, one of the characters is actually reciting the speech that Alec Baldwin gives, but it\u2019s used in a way to kind of haze and put some heat underneath this new car salesman who hasn\u2019t seen the film. It\u2019s a great example of how you take a difficult situation, get creative, and create something even better.\n\nQ: Would you say the film is something of a departure for Nia Vardalos and George Lopez, who are both best known for straight-up comedy roles?\n\nA: 100%. I think George and Nia are so good in this film and deliver such unexpected performances that their fans will love. This gave them both a chance to really exercise their dramatic chops, but in ways that still keep their characters entertaining and funny.\n\nQ: What was it like working with an Oscar-winning actress like Octavia Spencer?\n\nA: First and foremost it\u2019s just an honor because Octavia was so gracious to me and to all the students. She was really inspired by what we were doing with the teaching hospital for aspiring filmmakers. She\u2019s very easy to communicate with. At the end of the day, pointing the camera at Octavia Spencer is like pointing the camera at a Matisse, or a van Gogh, or any great work of art. Just her presence, she can just sit there and she\u2019s beautiful and mesmerizing to watch. That climatic scene between her and Patrick J. Adams is the one that everybody keeps talking about.\n\nQ: Your last feature film was Sunset Strip in 2000. Why has it taken over a decade and a half to get another feature off the ground?\n\nA: I think it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been on a journey to not just make another movie. I\u2019ve been on a journey to learn how to finance independent features in a more innovative and better way. I\u2019ve been searching for a way to make movies in a better and more innovative way by having this built-in teaching hospital for aspiring filmmakers. Now as we approach the release of the film, I\u2019ve needed the time to take to learn how to create and innovate a new release model for independent films. So I didn\u2019t just go out and try to get a gig as a director. I actually went into business school after graduating from USC Film School and directing Sunset Strip for 20th Century Fox. I realized that I really wanted to learn the business of my business so I went to UCLA and got my MBA and did a six-month study on new business models for independent film. We\u2019ve built a new model, from the way we financed it to the way we made it. Now the way we\u2019re releasing it, ASU and Phoenix have everything with this new, innovative way to release a film. How often have you seen a movie that is launched out of a non-LA, non-New York market that\u2019s going to be in multiple theaters across that single market of Phoenix? If it does well in Phoenix, that would give us the opportunity not only to expand the release, but to say, \u201cHey, we did something extraordinary right here in Phoenix. We made a Hollywood movie that gave all these students this great opportunity to learn filmmaking.\u201d Add to that the fact that it was written by a Scottsdale native, set in Scottsdale, shot in Scottsdale, and being screened at Phoenix\u2019s own Harkins Theatres, that makes for a pretty amazing Arizona story and gives Phoenix folks a good reason to get out there and watch the movie. If that wasn\u2019t reason enough, there\u2019s this incredibly entertaining story about a car sales team having to accomplish task of selling more cars that have ever been sold in a single day.\n\nQ: What other projects do you have in the works right now?\n\nA: I wouldn\u2019t call it in the works, but I will tell you my dream project, which is a big, huge dance musical about funk music saving the planet. I would like to do something really innovative, which would be to have people watching and experiencing this funk dance musical that saves the planet in movie theaters simulcast so that you\u2019d have people in movie theaters all across the country watching and experiencing this dance musical at the same time. The goal of the movie would be to get them all dancing. I think that would be a lot of fun."}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Adam-Collis", "page_content": "Adam Collis is an American filmmaker and actor.

We caught up with Adam last week to talk about the genesis of Car Dogs, the diversity of his cast, and the excitement surrounding this week\u2019s world premiere.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to watch a movie that\u2019s set in Phoenix and was actually shot here, because there are so many shots in this film where I immediately recognize the area and the surroundings. As the director, why was it important for you to shoot here?\n\nAdam Collis: Well, the movie was always set in Phoenix, and it was written by a Scottsdale native, so it almost felt serendipitously destined to be shot here. The film started coming together when, as a professor at Arizona State University, my boss came to me and said that we needed to give internship opportunities to our students, so they could get some real-world experience. And I kind of jokingly said \u201cwell, we could make a feature film, and that would give them all great internship experiences,\u201d and he took me seriously and said \u201cis there a script that you could do?\u201d\n\nI had been here about a year and a half, and I kept thinking about this script by a former student, who I had taught in my very first class in Los Angeles. It was this script called Car Dogs, written by Mark King, a Scottsdale native, and it was set in this car dealership in Scottsdale. And I was thinking \u201cthis could be done relatively inexpensively.\u201d We had just had the financial collapse, so I knew there would be a lot of empty dealerships in the valley and we could get our location.\n\nSo I called Mark to find out if he had every done anything with it, because that was a hot script in Hollywood for awhile. There were names attached to it, and it had a big agency representing it, but like so many projects it came together and then fell apart, so when I called it was available. And I asked if he wanted to come back to his hometown, and make a movie drawn from his own life experiences, with students from his alma mater, and Mark said \u201cof course.\u201d\n\nAnd then we just started putting it together with all of these wonderful ASU connections. Like our casting director, John Jackson \u2013 he\u2019s an ASU alum \u2013 and he\u2019s really what led to the sort of outside-the-box casting of George Lopez. That part was originally written for like a young Ben Affleck type, but John really gets you to think about things in a different way, to think about casting roles in a way that feels real, but unexpected. Nobody was expecting me to cast a 50-year-old Mexican-American comedian in that role.\n\nYeah, he\u2019s fantastic. You almost kind of forget that it\u2019s George Lopez, because the role is so different from the stuff he\u2019s typically recognized for.\n\nAdam Collis: He was just so incredibly directable. He\u2019s such a talented and charismatic guy, he\u2019s the sort of guy you can just train the camera on and let it go. I\u2019m just so delighted, and it was very, very gratifying to be able to work with him.\n\nYou also have Octavia Spencer in this film for a brief role, and coming off this past year\u2019s award season, that\u2019s a pretty high-profile name. How did she get involved?\n\nAdam Collis: This is one of those stories where it\u2019s not what you know, it\u2019s who you know. Josh Hopkins, who plays Reynolds, is someone that I grew up with in Lexington, Kentucky. He\u2019s also an executive producer on the film, and he had known Octavia Spencer for a very long time. There\u2019s a really important, pivotal scene near the end of the film, and it called for someone with Octavia\u2019s gravitas, so I pitched the idea to Josh.\n\nHe reached out to Octavia, and then I had a call with her. We talked for about ten minutes, and she was in, so I thanked her and told her we would see her during production. Well, some time passed and things changed in her schedule, and she told Josh she wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d be able to do it. So Josh came and told me that, and I said \u201cwell, did she tell you definitively that she couldn\u2019t be in the movie?\u201d And he said no, so I begged him to go back to her and explore it again.\n\nHe came back and told me that she wasn\u2019t sure it would fit into her schedule, and once again I said \u201cdid she tell you definitively that she couldn\u2019t be in the movie?\u201d And he said no, so I begged him to go back to her and see what they could work out. Then he comes back a third time and says \u201cOctavia wants to talk to you.\u201d I\u2019ve never shared the contents of that conversation with anyone, but by the end of that twenty minutes, she said \u201cI\u2019ll see you in Phoenix,\u201d so it all worked out for everyone.\n\nAnother great performance in this film comes from Chris Mulkey as the main character\u2019s father.\n\nAdam Collis: He\u2019s the best! Chris Mulkey is the bull, El Toro. You just let him in the ring, and you try your best the guide the bull with your red cape, but the bull probably has better ideas than you have.\n\nThere have been plenty of movies with this sort of villainous businessman archetype, but this guy is the upper echelon. He is such an asshole, and he\u2019s so despicable, but he\u2019s so charismatic that you can\u2019t take your eyes off him.\n\nAdam Collis: You know, when I saw Mulkey\u2019s reel, it wasn\u2019t what I was expecting initially. I think what the writer had in mind was someone much more stoic and stern and manipulative, But I think what Chris brought to it was so much smarter, this guy who\u2019s just such an overwhelming asshole that you\u2019re fascinated to see what he\u2019ll say or do next. Individual politics aside, does that remind us of anyone?\n\nI think there\u2019s something about the spirit of his performance that really speaks to our times. There\u2019s someone who\u2019s so strong in their point of view and so viciously committed to what he believes, regardless of whether or not it screws people over. He\u2019s justified it in his mind, and everything that character does, he believes is okay, because he\u2019s got his own justification and that\u2019s what fuels his intensity. The best bad guys always think they\u2019re the good guys.\n\nHow excited are you for Car Dogs to have its world premiere here in Phoenix?\n\nAdam Collis: Well, the thing I\u2019m most excited about is the thing I\u2019m the most nervous about, and that\u2019s the fact that we\u2019re launching this movie in a completely unique way that depends on the good people of Phoenix to rally around this movie. Movies don\u2019t launch a national release out of Phoenix \u2013 in fact, they don\u2019t launch national releases very often out of anywhere that isn\u2019t New York or Los Angeles. We\u2019re saturating theaters across the valley so we can truly test the market, and so we can truly give the people of Phoenix the chance to decide whether or not this movie goes national.\n\nThis project was born out of the culture of innovation that is Arizona State University. There\u2019s no question about that, and president Michael Crow has created this entrepreneurial, innovative environment, and out of that environment we created a new business model for financing an independent film, and a new professional immersion program. But the biggest innovation is this new way to launch a movie out of the Phoenix market, so that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for the people of Phoenix to come out and support the movie. If it goes national, everything points back here.\n\nThe world premiere of Car Dogs takes place on Monday, March 20th. The film opens in Harkins Theaters throughout the Phoenix area on Friday, March 24."}, {"url": "https://news.asu.edu/content/film-professor-brings-hollywood-listers-tempe", "page_content": "Adam Collis, visiting professor of film directing at ASU, hates the word \u201cconnections,\u2019\u2019 but that\u2019s what the filmmaker and actor taps when he\u2019s lining up Hollywood A-listers to talk with students about filmmaking.
