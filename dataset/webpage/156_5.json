Whenever Beaver's mom, June (the late Barbara Billingsley), went to her husband, Ward (played by the late Hugh Beaumont), with concerns about their son, viewers knew they were in for some sort of \"golly, gee\" predicament poor Beaver had inevitably gotten himself into \u2014 and that dear old Dad would have to fix.\n\nWe can look back on \"Leave It to Beaver\" as a quintessential image of mid-20th-century aesthetics \u2014 the good, which changed television forever, and the cringe, which wasn't OK then and isn't now. On the one hand, the show's sitcom format was foundational for the genre in a way countless other shows have emulated since. On the other hand, its rosy-tinted, picture-perfect suburban America was a filtered view, one in which its citizens were overwhelmingly white and gender roles were unwaveringly rigid.\n\nWith \"Leave It to Beaver\" airing in the infancy of television itself, many decades have passed and much of its adult cast has unfortunately passed away.

So, when a detective tracked him down in the \u201980s when CBS wanted Stevens for its sequel Leave It to Beaver, his wife assured the detective that he had the wrong house.\n\nRusty served in the U.S. Army in 1969 with a military occupational specialty of armor. Though the Vietnam War was in full swing, he never got orders to serve there. So instead, he served in Daley Barracks, Border Guard Unit, Bad Kissingen, West Germany.\n\nEarly Life and Childhood\n\nRusty Stevens was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on November 25, 1948. He grew up in the loving care and protection of his parents.\n\nStevens was a normal kid who attended school and sold newspapers during his free time. He hadn\u2019t acted in a school play or a church skit. However, as his mother admitted, he loved to watch movies and TV Westerns and act out the parts around the house.\n\nRusty Stevens childhood photo\n\nSo, Rusty had been selling newspapers for ten months without anyone paying attention when a children\u2019s talent scout named Lola Moore noticed him. As Lola mentioned, she liked Rusty\u2019s style. Undoubtedly, Stevens\u2019 parents were shocked. Rusty\u2019s mother even gave an interview to the newspaper The Valley Times in 1957, which was the very newspaper her son had been selling. She said,\n\n\u201cThe studio people say he\u2019s a real discovery.\u201d\n\nThat was how Rusty made his TV debut on Leave It to Beaver. He became an instant celebrity as many audiences loved his role as Larry Mondello.\n\nRomantic Affairs and Relationships\n\nTheresa Marinelli (Rusty Stevens\u2019 Wife)\n\nStevens is happily married to Theresa Marinelli. They also have one child together.\n\nCareer\n\nRusty began his career as a child actor in the hit TV series Leave It to Beaver.

Stevens appeared in 68 of the show\u2019s 234 episodes as Theodore \u201cBeaver\u201d Cleaver\u2019s young friend.\n\nAdditionally, the star child also acted in many TV series. According to IMBD, My Three Sons, Perry Mason, and National Velvet are some of the TV shows played by Rusty.\n\nThere was no doubt that Stevens would have made a name for himself in the movie industry had he continued working in his field. But instead, he suddenly left the show, which had given him celebrity status.\n\nAfter he stopped appearing as Larry Mondello, the latest TV appearance he made was in The Rifleman in 1963. After a long time, Rusty reappeared in the 1983 made-for-television reunion movie Still the Beaver.\n\nJerry Mathers searched for decades to reunite with Rusty Stevens.\n\nAfter Rusty Stevens\u2019s parents ended his contract with the show Leave It to Beaver and left Los Angeles, it seemed like everybody forgot about Rusty. However, his old friend and co-star Jerry Mathers had not forgotten his dear friend.\n\nRusty Stevens and Jerry Mathers from Leave It to Beaver\n\nHe kept searching for his old friend and was deeply frustrated when he couldn\u2019t find him. In an interview with The Pantagraph in 1982, Mathers said,\n\n\u201cNobody could find him for the longest time. Everybody lost touch with him.\u201d\n\nHowever, Mathers did not lose hope and left no stone unturned to find his old buddy. Finally, he succeeded in finding Stevens, who was in New Jersey, working as a car insurance salesman.\n\nSo, Jerry persuaded Rusty to participate in 1983 Leave It To Beaver reunion movie, and Rusty did three guest spots on episodes of The New Leave It To Beaver, making his final TV role the same as the first. From then on, the pair of best buddies never lost touch again.\n\nRusty Stevens Movies List\n\nMovie Released Year Role The New Leave It To Beaver 1983-1989 Larry Mondello Still the Beaver 1983 Larry Mondello The Rifleman 1963 Melvin Wagon Train 1962 Johnny Perry Mason 1962 Brucie Hillman My Three Sons 1962 Cletus Bleeker National Velvet 1961 Alvy\u2019s Friend The Jim Backus Show 1961 Alexander \u2018Sandy\u2019 Cleaver Angel 1957-1969 Leave It to Beaver 1957-1960 Larry Mondello Shirley Temple\u2019s Storybook 1960 Stuffy Cole/ Gypsy Boy 77 Sunset Strip 1960 Max Cimarron City 1958 Boy Reading Script Cat On A Hot Tin Roof 1958 Sonny Telephone Time 1958 Fat Boy Racket Squad 1951 Detective Steve\n\nControversy\n\nRusty Stevens had gained massive popularity for his role as Larry Mondello.

According to Rusty himself, the truth is that as his character Larry Mondello became more popular on the show, he was signed to a contract by the show producers. At that time, aside from the cast members, he was the only other actor to be under contract.\n\nAt first, Stevens loved spending most of his time at the studio. However, he started missing his everyday life, where he would go to school and spend time with his family. Rusty kept the frustration inside for a while, but later, he told his parents that he couldn\u2019t handle it anymore.\n\nRusty said he didn\u2019t know to what length his mother might have gone to help him.

Among American adults, you'd probably be hard-pressed to find someone that hadn't at least some familiarity with \"I Love Lucy,\" \"Gunsmoke,\" or \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents.\" Television then, like now, had shows that spanned all genres of interest, ranging from suspense to comedy to Western action/dramas.\n\nShows that centered around family life were also a dominant staple of that era. The decade of the 1950s certainly had its hits in this category, with shows like \"Father Knows Best\" and \"The Adventures of Ozzy and Harriet\" both garnering multiple Emmy nominations and earning high shares of viewers during their respective runs in black and white.\n\nPerhaps the family-centered sitcom that will always be attributed to TV's golden era is \"Leave it to Beaver.\" The show ran over six seasons producing a monumental 236 episodes, each one capturing a pseudo-realistic glimpse into the lives of a \"typical\" 1950s suburban family.\n\nThere are several fascinating tidbits about the show that even the most devoted fans might not be aware of.
