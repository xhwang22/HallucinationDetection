{"Dan Stearns is best known for being the lead singer and guitarist of The Lemonheads.": [{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/24/dan-stevens-people-thought-i-was-crazy-his-journey-from-downton-to-hollywood", "page_content": "Dan Stevens knew little about Watergate before being cast in Gaslit, a new prestige drama about the 1970s American scandal that toppled a president and shook America. The 39-year-old actor, of early Downton Abbey fame, might now be sitting in his very own Los Angeles garden but, as with many Brits, his knowledge of the affair extended only to the most superficial stuff. \u201cI knew it spawned the gate-suffix,\u201d says Stevens, over Zoom. He\u2019s wearing a jazzy Paul Smith shirt, behind him lush leaves and that Hollywood sunshine. \u201cBut you quickly realise there\u2019s a universality to that stupid level of corruption. It\u2019s found in every administration in every country in the world; it just so happens that these guys got caught.\u201d He sees glaring parallels with the British government, or as he put it in a now viral One Show segment: \u201cYou\u2019ve got a criminal for a leader who is wrapped in a messy war, embroiled in a stupid scandal, surrounded by ambitious idiots and really should resign\u2026 Oh no I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s the intro to Boris Johnson.\u201d\n\nAlso starring Julia Roberts and Sean Penn, the five-part series \u2013 based on the highly successful Slow Burn podcast \u2013 sees the often-told story of nefarious political espionage rerun once more, but through the experiences of characters who might otherwise have been considered minor players in a story of high-level Washington rot and paranoia.\n\nThere\u2019s a creative ADHD in me which is terrifying and thrilling\n\n\u201cIt was one of the first times that something played out on television in real time,\u201d says Stevens. \u201cWe\u2019re immune to the hypocrisy of our leaders these days, but back then it was such a scandal. And so much of it was buried.\u201d\n\nRoberts plays Martha Mitchell, the Arkansan socialite and wife of President Nixon\u2019s loyal attorney general, John Mitchell (Sean Penn). Despite party affiliation, she\u2019s the first person to publicly sound the alarm on Nixon\u2019s involvement in Watergate. Stevens, meanwhile, takes on the part of young hotshot Republican lawyer John Dean, who was steadily climbing the ranks of power when the Watergate break-in occurred. There was talk, before filming started, of Stevens meeting with Dean, one of the few surviving figures depicted. Today, he\u2019s a regular face on CNN and the speaker circuit; either national hero or treacherous rat.\n\n\u201cI was keen to sit down with him,\u201d says Stevens \u2013 but somehow, word got out about the lunch date. \u201cThen I was told I\u2019d have to speak with Universal\u2019s lawyers in advance, which I didn\u2019t want to do; I didn\u2019t think it would make the meal taste particularly nice.\u201d Instead, he pored over source material: footage from hearings, newspaper clippings. There was plenty to work from as Stevens set about doing what he always does: throwing himself in at the deep end, and learning on the job.\n\nIn his own words, Stevens was quite the \u201cenergetic\u201d child. Adopted just days after birth, he grew up first in Essex, then Wales and Sussex, as his parents \u2013 both teachers \u2013 moved to follow work. His own school reports, meanwhile, were at least consistent in their content: \u201cDaniel must learn not to distract others\u201d a recurring theme. He\u2019s somewhat guarded when it comes to setting out the full extent of his adolescent indiscretions. He\u2019s blanked out, he says unconvincingly, the details of any major misbehaviour: \u201cLet\u2019s say I was never very good with the institutional side of education.\u201d\n\n\u2018I\u2019d done my fair share of period drama\u2019: Dan Stevens as Matthew Crawley in Downton Abbey. Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy\n\nAt nine, he was sent to boarding school. His parents believed a \u201cfully immersive\u201d education might do them all some good. \u201cIt\u2019s a weird thing,\u201d he says, of the public school system. \u201cThe further you get from it, the more absurd it seems to be to put 60 boys in a house run by teenagers. It takes on its own Lord of the Flies quality \u2013 or character building, as the English like to call it.\u201d\n\nOn a scholarship, he attended Tonbridge School in Kent, where his, let\u2019s say, spiritedness, was quickly channelled into the drama department. \u201cI was shepherded by some great teachers who recognised I could and should act,\u201d Stevens says. \u201cI was nurtured in that direction and kept away from too much trouble, which was an incredible gift.\u201d\n\nIt became clear early on that he was a talent. There was his turn as Professor Higgins in My Fair Lady, but it was a production of Macbeth, when he was 14, which was a truly formative role. After he auditioned for the part of Fleance \u2013 something of a minor character \u2013 his teachers suggested he should, in fact, take the lead.\n\nReading English at Cambridge University, Stevens found the Footlights. \u201cI was doing standup, sketch shows and musical comedy,\u201d he says. Granted, he adds, much of it was mediocre. \u201cI never had ambitions to be a comic,\u201d he continues, \u201cbut I learned a huge amount about stagecraft from doing it: the ability to get up and make words work for an audience, timing, rolling with what makes people laugh.\u201d\n\nIn his final year, Stevens was once again cast as the lead in the Scottish play. And, Cambridge being Cambridge, it just so happened that playing Lady Macbeth was Rebecca Hall, now actor and writer. Back then, however, she was a fellow undergrad drama type, whose father was the revered theatre director Sir Peter Hall.\n\n\u2018He has this extraordinary dedication to his craft\u2019: Dan Stevens in Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga. Photograph: Landmark Media/Alamy\n\n\u201cDan was this striking, oddball guy,\u201d she tells me, the pair are still friends. \u201cHe has always been incredibly dextrous \u2013 his brain works very fast. My father appreciated nimble actors, and Dad spotted that incredibly quickly.\u201d Impressed, Sir Peter offered Stevens a gig playing Orlando in a touring production of As You Like It before graduation. Student life was swapped for treading the boards. \u201cIt was incredible,\u201d Stevens says of the opportunity, \u201ca real apprenticeship in classical theatre, being part of a touring troupe, what I might have been taught at drama school had I gone.\u201d With no formal training, Stevens worked it out as he went along.\n\nHe soon moved to London and carved out a career in the industry. There were West End roles, and plenty of period telly: The Line of Beauty, Sense and Sensibility and The Turn of the Screw to name a few. When, in 2009, auditions for Downton Abbey were being held, it seemed to be a job like any other. \u201cI\u2019d done my fair share of period drama by that point,\u201d he says. \u201cI considered not going up for it, or not doing it when I got it. I felt I\u2019d already done them.\u201d In the end, Stevens decided to do just one more. \u201cNobody knew what it was going to become,\u201d he says. It was commissioned as an eight-part mini-series. \u201cThere was no sense when we were making it that it would be the juggernaut it turned into.\u201d\n\nJulian Fellowes, Downton\u2019s creator and writer, remembers clearly what he saw in Stevens: \u201cDan had this tremendous power on screen and is one of the handsomest men I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d he tells me. \u201cHe had a charming moral decency we felt would work.\u201d\n\nIn late 2012, three seasons in, Downton was still clocking up 10m+ British viewers during its Sunday-night airings; in the US, that figure was hitting a staggering 24m week on week. But while the show was going from strength to strength, Stevens was eyeing up an exit, discontent at the prospect of a lifetime playing floppy-haired, morally decent, period-drama chaps.\n\n\u201cThere were definitely creative itches left unscratched,\u201d Stevens explains of his decision to leave the show, \u201cgenres I hadn\u2019t worked in. Three years were up, that\u2019s what we\u2019d initially signed up for, and the appetite to explore further was too great.\u201d\n\n\u2018You quickly realise there\u2019s a universality to that stupid level of corruption\u2019: Dan Stevens in the new Watergate series Gaslit. Photograph: Hilary Bronwyn Gayle/Starz Entertainment\n\nIt was only close to the start of filming for that third season that Stevens confirmed his departure. Fellowes tells me a major death had already been booked in for episode five, leaving them little room for another. So on Christmas Day 2012, his character, Matthew Crawley, was killed off in a fatal car accident in what was, quite frankly, an ending altogether void of festive cheer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something I expect people to readily understand,\u201d Stevens says of the departure. \u201cSome admire it, others think I was mad: that the part was the greatest thing that could ever happen to me.\u201d\n\nIt takes some self-confidence, surely, to walk away from such a secure spot in a behemoth of broadcasting, at a time when increasingly lucrative contracts were, no doubt, being negotiated once more. \u201cBut the question is what would satisfy you? A bit more money and the same thing for another decade,\u201d Stevens replies, \u201cor the great unknown. The wild west. An open playing field of potential.\u201d\n\nBeing in such a high-profile production also came with attention. \u201cThere was certainly a feeling that such a level of focus from the British tabloid press was not the greatest thing to have in one\u2019s life,\u201d says Stevens. \u201cWe got out of the UK at a time when it wasn\u2019t hugely problematic. And maybe it wouldn\u2019t have been. But there was this fear of raising a family into that environment.\u201d\n\nAt home in Hollywood: Dan Stevens with his wife, Susie Stevens. Photograph: Jeffrey Mayer/WireImage\n\nAnd so, Stevens headed stateside. By that January, he was rehearsing for his broadway debut opposite Jessica Chastain. Then came a movie in Brooklyn. Stevens upped sticks and settled in New York with his wife \u2013 Susie Stevens, a South African Jazz singer and teacher \u2013 and their two oldest children. Six years later, by now with another child, they headed west to LA, where the family has remained.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an imagination in casting here that\u2019s refreshing,\u201d Stevens says. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t been seen doing something, they might be open to seeing you try. There are strict channels in the UK: ah you play posh period dramas? In your box you go. Gritty northerners? That\u2019s what you\u2019ll do\u2026 I could see a world in which sticking around wouldn\u2019t have been satisfying.\u201d\n\nIf a diverse plethora of parts was his ambition, it\u2019s fair to say he has achieved it. From sci-fi (Colossal, Kill Switch) and family blockbusters (Beauty and the Beast, Night at the Museum) to Apostle\u2019s sheer horror, Stevens has grafted to carve out quite an eclectic career. He\u2019s also been dipping his toe back in comedy, earning himself no shortage of admirers, Will Ferrell included. The pair worked together in Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga, which Ferrell also produced. \u201cHe showed up on the first day with this fully fleshed-out character, complete with Russian accent,\u201d Ferrell tells me. \u201cHe was working far harder than I was, whether improvising with me or performing his song and dance numbers. Plus, through the night he was auditioning for other projects; he has this extraordinary dedication to his craft.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to be prepared,\u201d Stevens says, \u201cfor people to be confused by your desire to do both animated family comedy and twisted horror in the same calendar year.\u201d It\u2019s that creative stimulation that he thrives on.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not to say you and I won\u2019t sit down in 10 years when I\u2019ll have been playing the same sitcom character for a decade, and I\u2019ll mutter something about mortgages and school fees\u2026\u201d But honestly? Stevens can\u2019t see that happening. \u201cPossibly there\u2019s a certain creative ADHD in me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve tried all sorts, not all of it successful. It\u2019s terrifying and thrilling, but if the territory is too familiar, I\u2019ll just get bored.\u201d\n\nGaslit premieres on Sunday 24 April on StarzPlay"}, {"url": "https://viralbeliever.com/11-rock-music-legends-who-found-jesus/", "page_content": "Viral Believer sometimes participates in different affiliate programs, including the Amazon Associates program.

But Grand Funk\u2019s success was short-lived, and the band fizzled as the 1980s began. Later in the decade, Farner found a new calling, releasing the Christian rock album \u201cJust Another Injustice.\u201d With songs such as \u201cJudgment Day Blues\u201d and \u201cCome To Jesus\u201d, it was clear Farner had changed. Farner has recorded other contemporary Christian CDs since then, including \u201cIf It Wasn\u2019t For Grace.\u201d\n\nAlice Cooper\n\nCooper is somewhat reluctant to take on the mantle of celebrity \u201cborn-again Christian,\u201d telling Hard Music Magazine, \u201cBeing a Christian is something you just progress in. You learn. You go to your Bible studies. You pray. \u2026 it\u2019s real easy to focus on Alice Cooper and not on Christ. I\u2019m a rock singer. \u2026 I consider myself low on the totem pole of knowledgeable Christians. So, don\u2019t look for answers from me.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a new creature now. Don\u2019t judge Alice by what he used to be. Praise God for what I am now.\u201d\n\nRead more about Alice Cooper Here.\n\nRick Derringer\n\nHe\u2019s remembered primarily for his 1973 hit single Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo, which still gets airplay on classic rock stations, but he\u2019s also played on recordings by Kiss, Alice Cooper, Steely Dan and Cyndi Lauper. Since proclaiming his faith in Jesus several years ago, Derringer has reworked his biggest hit with new wording (\u201cRead the Word, Live it Too\u201d) and recorded contemporary Christian music.\n\nBob Dylan\n\nBob Dylan Considers Himself A Christian and a Jew\n\nDylan\u2019s conversion had a massive impact on his music and the albums that came after \u2013 Slow Train Coming, Saved, and Shot of Love \u2013 were heavily Christian. Decades later, his 2012 release and 35th studio album Tempest followed in a similar vein.\n\nNicko McBrain Iron Maiden\n\nNicko McBrain from Iron Maiden\n\nMcBrain gave his life to Christ in 1999 in an emotional experience after going to church with his wife, Rebecca. As McBrain told Willow Creek Association News, he prayed to receive Christ, and began to read the Bible. \u201cI had this love affair with Jesus going on in my heart,\u201d he said. McBrain still tours with the band, playing the songs that made the band popular. He\u2019s also part of the worship music team at his church in Florida. He believes his seemingly incongruous lifestyle is part of the Lord\u2019s plan. McBrain has given his testimony in front of heavy metal fans, and seen them commit their life to Jesus and he also frequently talks with fellow Iron Maiden members about his beliefs.\n\nKerry Livgren Kansas\n\nKerry Livgren lead guitarist for Kansas\n\nPenning such hits as \u201cCarry On Wayward Son\u201d and \u201cDust in the Wind,\u201d Kerry propelled the band to worldwide success and critical acclaim, with numerous gold and multi-platinum albums, and over 14 million recordings sold to date.\n\nIn 1980, after becoming an evangelical Christian, Kerry Livgren released his first solo work, Seeds of Change, featuring vocalists Ronnie James Dio and David Pack of Ambrosia, Jethro Tull\u2019s drummer Barriemore Barlow, and guest spots by friends from Kansas. Also accompanying the album was Kerry\u2019s autobiographical book of the same name. Together, they expressed the passage and resolution of Kerry\u2019s years-long spiritual journey, often the subject of his songs with Kansas. Following his departure from Kansas in 1983, Kerry recorded his second self-produced album for CBS, Timeline, in the same year. With the musicians involved in that project, he formed the band, AD. Between 1983 and 1986, the band released two albums and toured extensively.\n\nDan Spitz Anthrax\n\nDan Spitz was the lead guitarist of Anthrax\n\nIn 2000, Spitz, who was raised in a Jewish home, became a Messianic Jew, a religious blend that upholds Jewish customs while acknowledging that salvation is only possible by accepting Jesus as one\u2019s savior.\n\nBrian \u201cHead\u201d Welch Korn\n\nBrian \u201cHead\u201d Welch guitarist and co-founder of Korn\n\nIn 2005, Welch found God. He was baptized in the River Jordan in March 2005. As he later explained in a Full Armor of God radio interview. \u201cI was walking one day, just doing my rock and roll thing making millions of bucks, you know success and everything, addicted to drugs and then the next day I had Revelation of Christ and I was like, everything changes right now!\u201d Welch detailed his spiritual awakening in his provocatively titled book, Save Me from Myself: How I Found God, Quit Korn, Kicked Drugs, and Lived to Tell My Story.\n\nLater he returned to playing guitar for Korn but he has not given up on his Christian faith. He still regularly meets with fans after concerts to pray for them and lead them to Christ.\n\nDave Mustaine Metallica and Megadeth\n\nDave Mustaine guitarist for Metallica and Megadeath\n\nBy the early 2000s, Mustaine was sick of touring, tired of his fellow bandmates, and generally down on his life. As Mustaine later told an interviewer, \u201cLooking up at the cross, I said six simple words, \u2018What have I got to lose?\u2019 Afterwards, my whole life has changed.\n\nIt\u2019s been hard, but I wouldn\u2019t change it for anything. Rather than go my whole life believing that there is a God and find out there isn\u2019t, than live my whole life thinking there isn\u2019t a God and then find out, when I die, that there is.\u201d\n\nRingo Starr The Beatles\n\nRingo Starr drummer for The Beatles\n\nRingo was reported to have said, during an interview at a recent event at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles, that he had \u201cfound God\u201d after taking a long and winding road to this change in his life. Reports say that the musician, who has since become teetotal and quit his 60-a-day cigarette habit, says that religion now plays an important role in his life.\n\nRick Wakeman Yes\n\nRick Wakeman keyboardist for Yes.\n\nBy the early 1980s the great keyboard virtuoso was sleeping on park benches. During that time, Wakeman met former model Nina Carter, who helped him rebuild his life. When they decided to marry, Nina insisted on a church wedding. The only place that would perform the ceremony, because both of them were divorced, was Camberley United Reformed Church. The couple married in 1984 and attended worship there.\n\n\u201cWhen I brought my Christianity back into my life, things were going well,\u201d Wakeman says. \u201cI was thinking how I\u2019d managed to pick myself up from the gutter with Nina\u2019s help. And I thought, This is great\u2013but there\u2019s something missing. \u201cBecause I\u2019d had such wonderful teaching from people I\u2019d met in my first 19 years, it was easy for me to know what was missing.\u201d In a Sydney, Australia, hotel room, he reflected on his life and rededicated it to Jesus.\n\nBono U2\n\nPaul David Hewson, known by his stage name Bono, is an Irish singer-songwriter, musician, venture capitalist, businessman, and philanthropist. He is best recognized as the frontman of the Dublin-based rock band U2. Bono was born and raised in Dublin, Ireland, and attended Mount Temple Comprehensive School where he met his future wife, Alison Stewart, and the future members of U2. Bono writes almost all U2 lyrics, frequently using religious, social, and political themes. During U2\u2019s early years, Bono\u2019s lyrics contributed to their rebellious and spiritual tone. As the band matured, his lyrics became inspired more by personal experiences shared with the other members.\n\nBono has been an outspoken Christian during his career. Bono said to RTE last year \u201c[Who is Christ?] is a defining question for a Christian\u2026you\u2019re not let off easily by saying a great thinker or philosopher\u2026he went around saying he was the Messiah\u2026he was crucified\u2026because he said he was the son of God. He either was the son of God\u2026or nuts\u2026 [and] I find it hard to accept that millions of lives\u2026 have felt their lives touched and inspired by some nut. I don\u2019t believe it,\u201d\n\nLou Gramm Foreigner\n\nLou Gramm is an American rock vocalist, and songwriter, best known for being the original lead singer for the British-American rock band Foreigner. Louis Andrew Grammatico was born in Rochester, New York, the son of Nikki, a singer, and Bennie Grammatico, a band leader and trumpeter.\n\nIn an interview he gave with Fox News he was asked about his born again experience. He said, \u201cThat happened just literally before [addiction treatment center] Hazelden. We had played a sold out concert at Madison Square Garden and there was the record company party afterwards that lasted until four or five in the morning. Everybody was in that condition and I ended up back in my hotel room, of course I wasn\u2019t able to sleep. I just started doing a little self assessment and thinking about what I had become and was very upset about it and worried about my children seeing me like this. I finally fell to my knees and asked God to take this plague away from me.\u201d He continues, \u201cI\u2019m a devout born-again Christian. God plays a role in everything I do. I know he gave me life and saved my life. I serve him.\u201d\n\nDave Ellefson Megadeath\n\nDavid Warren \u201cDave\u201d Ellefson is a bassist and founding member of the American thrash metal band Megadeth. He has also been referred to as \u201cJunior\u201d to differentiate him from Dave Mustaine. Ellefson currently resides in Scottsdale, Arizona. In addition to playing bass guitar in Megadeth, Ellefson also has various side projects which include Temple of Brutality, F5, and Killing Machine.\n\nIn a recent interview with Blabbermouth he said, \u201cI think Dave (Mustaine) has been very open about his faith, and I\u2019ve been open about my faith. Certainly me getting sober twenty years is what really led me back into Christian faith, but I always had it as a kid, quite honestly. I was born and raised Christian, and my family went to church on Sunday.\u201d\n\nJohnny Cash\n\nJohnny \u201cJ.R.\u201d Cash was an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, actor and author who was widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. Although primarily remembered as a country music icon, his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel. This crossover appeal won Cash the rare honor of multiple inductions in the Country Music, Rock and Roll and Gospel Music Halls of Fame.\n\nA writer once tried to paint [Johnny] Cash into a corner, baiting him to acknowledge a single denominational persuasion at the center of his heart. Finally, Cash laid down the law: \u201cI\u2014as a believer that Jesus of Nazareth, a Jew, the Christ of the Greeks, was the Anointed One of God (born of the seed of David, upon faith as Abraham has faith, and it was accounted to him for righteousness)\u2014am grafted onto the true vine, and am one of the heirs of God\u2019s covenant with Israel.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d the writer replied.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Christian,\u201d Cash shot back. \u201cDon\u2019t put me in another box.\u201d\n\n\n\nAuthor\u2019s Note:\n\nThere are many great musicians who have found Jesus in their life. It was my desire to try to give a list, although not exhaustive, of some of the legends of rock-n-roll who have found Jesus. Some I did not include due to a lack of what is admittedly a subjective designation of \u201clegendary.\u201d It does not mean that they were not great but from what I could tell, they did not have the popularity or mainstream name recognition that would qualify for that title.\n\nI hope you have enjoyed this list.

Keith Richards\n\nThe lead guitarist of the Rolling Stones, Keith Richards, is thought to be one of the best living guitarists in the world. He has a very distinct guitar sound, and his style is influenced by Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters, and Scotty Moore.\n\nRolling Stone magazine said Richards had created \u201crock\u2019s greatest single body of riffs\u201d and placed him as the \u201c10th greatest guitarist of all time\u201d. Richards wrote fourteen songs with the Rolling Stones lead vocalist Mick Jagger are listed among Rolling Stone magazine\u2019s \u201c500 Greatest Songs of All Time\u201d. The Stones are generally identified as one of the co-founders of rock and roll.\n\n2. Jimmy Page\n\nWidely regarded as one of the most influential rock guitarists alive, Jimmy Page is known for his amazing riffs and solos in songs like Stairway to Heaven, Kashmir, and Rock and Roll. He started playing lead guitar for various bands around London before forming Led Zeppelin, which became one of the most successful bands.\n\nJimmy was voted number two on Gibson\u2019s \u201cTop 50 Guitarists of All Time\u201d list in 2010. In 2007, he was ranked fourth among the \u201c100 Wildest Guitar Heroes\u201d by Classic Rock magazine. He was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame twice, once as a member of the Yardbirds in 1992 and again as a member of Led Zeppelin in 1995.\n\n1. Eric Clapton\n\nConsidered by many to be one of rock\u2019s greatest guitarists, Eric Clapton defined what it meant to play from your heart. His influence and legacy are felt in virtually every guitarist that came after him. From his work with Cream and Derek & The Dominos to his solo career, he has written some of rock\u2019s most powerful songs, including Layla and Tears In Heaven.\n\nAlthough Clapton is often labeled a blues player, he started playing guitar in a rock and roll band. He eventually developed his own style, which has drawn on many different genres of music, including blues, country, and pop.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese guitarists are ranked not only on technical ability but also on influence and impact, combined with musical skill and creative output. The greatest guitarists in history span a variety of music genres and countries. The world\u2019s top guitarists on all instruments come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one thing in common: they all have that spark of creativity that makes them great musicians."}, {"url": "https://www.theringer.com/music/2021/7/21/22586128/steely-dan-popular-cult-favorite-millennials", "page_content": "To look at American society over the past decade\u2014from its memes, to its cultural criticism, to even its electoral politics\u2014one might surmise the nation is consumed by a bitter and Manichean generational struggle, where no quarter is given and none taken over the power baby boomers wield as they cling to institutional power.\n\nMaybe so. But there are notable exceptions, and perhaps the most notable comes from the medium through which the boomers shaped America\u2019s cultural identity for decades: classic rock. Steely Dan, the jazz-rock combo whose musical and lyrical checkpoints include those most boomer-ish of pursuits such as cool jazz, hot guitar licks, tiki drinks, and expensive cocaine, have become an object of millennial obsession, spawning viral tweets, mash-ups, and even a custom run of streetwear emblazoned with their album art. John Mulaney and Nick Kroll wrote a bit based on Steely Dan for their hit Broadway show Oh, Hello. David Crosby, a fellow Boomer icon who\u2019s become a Twitter favorite in his own right, earned blog press with a new Dan-inspired (and cowritten) tune. The list goes on.\n\nEven in their time, Steely Dan were one of rock\u2019s most idiosyncratic outfits\u2014they covered Duke Ellington, peppered their records with references to obscure spiritualist sci-fi authors, and foreswore the big-time arena rock touring circuit at their (and its) peak. Of all this, what about them led millennials to pluck the band from the genre\u2019s back pages, placing them on the shelf of honor next to legacy acts like Fleetwood Mac or Bruce Springsteen who have renewed their cred in a similar fashion?\n\nAttempting to explain why certain music goes in and out of vogue might be, to reference the quote apocryphally attributed to the comedian Martin Mull, like \u201cdancing about architecture.\u201d But in taking a stab at it, it\u2019s only fair to offer the first opportunity to the architect of the music in question: Donald Fagen, Steely Dan\u2019s lead vocalist, co-songwriter, and bandleader, whom I spoke with earlier this summer by phone.\n\n\u201cDevelopmental psychology might figure in,\u201d Fagen wrote to me after our conversation. \u201cKids and teens resent the domination of the parents\u2014they begin as hostages to their dad\u2019s taste in music. Of course they hate it (though, in truth the stuff we wrote used tropes more common to the popular music of their grandpops). As they head into middle age, a lot of kids start to forgive their parents \u2026 so, as the prejudices of their youth crumble a bit, they\u2019re free to be more objective about what they hear\u2014or, they might even have a subliminal, sentimental attachment to sounds they heard in the womb, in the kitchen, in the back seat of their dad\u2019s car\u2014or something like that.\u201d\n\nFagen\u2019s insight is spot on, true to both his body of lyrical work and the sharp cultural criticism he\u2019s written for outlets like Slate and Harper\u2019s Bazaar. Millennials are, of course, growing into their own soft middle age, where one\u2019s identity is less defined by the cultural postures of youth than the big choices one might have made (or not made) while striking them. Their taste, then, is freed up to roam toward what they might have once overlooked as outr\u00e9.\n\nIn that light, it\u2019s easier to see Steely Dan\u2019s music as its savvier observers always have: not a smooth-jazz accoutrement to the spoils of boomer aristocracy, but an \u00fcber-sardonic critique of it. And in addition to the generational shift, there\u2019s an aesthetic one: Pop music, broadly defined, gains its cultural currency through an antagonistic relationship to the status quo. When it comes to the counterculture of the past few decades, Steely Dan\u2019s music has been anything but part of that firmament.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a knee-jerk, reactive way that cultural fashion evolves in its time,\u201d says Robert Christgau, the \u201cdean of American rock critics\u201d and an avowed fan of the Dan. \u201cPunk\u2014now that\u2019s, like, so old hat. Your generation\u2019s immediate elders are always putting it in your face. \u2026 And there\u2019s also indie rock, not quite the same thing, which people are also now finding tedious.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are cycles with things that are completely organic, that\u2019s built into being alive,\u201d he continues. \u201cAnd so far as you\u2019re using your brain, which as a critic, you really should be, music doesn\u2019t suddenly disappear.\u201d\n\nThe music of Steely Dan is now very much un-disappeared, with the help of the aforementioned litany of memes, the archival resource that is Spotify, and a now-immortal (and ubiquitous) clip from The Sopranos featuring James Gandolfini belting out one of their early hits. The band is no stranger to the whims of cultural fashion: rightly celebrated by the 1970s\u2019 savviest critics for their acerbic lyrics, musical creativity, and impeccable songwriting chops, by 2001 their Grammy win for the (excellent) comeback album Two Against Nature was met in the wider culture with utter bewilderment. But their newfound (or rediscovered) popularity isn\u2019t due just to their role in a game of 4-D generational chess or the ever-spinning wheel of pop modishness.\n\nThe spirit of Steely Dan\u2019s music\u2014wry and detached, but in the way only a true-blue bruised optimist can be\u2014is one that\u2019s uniquely suited to a certain kind of music listener and kindred spirit today. Its essence is present in nearly all of the discourse around the band, from the winking acknowledgement of encroaching middle age, to the sardonic cultural criticism that runs through their discography, to an awed, almost jealous appreciation of their peerless chops and the lavish perfectionism afforded by a bygone and less-stingy era of the music industry. And to understand how it\u2019s endured for five decades now since their inception in 1971, you have to go back to those beginnings\u2014when they, too, were on the outside, yearning for something more.\n\nBefore they were Steely Dan, Fagen and the band\u2019s cofounder, Walter Becker, were jazz-loving misfit students at Bard College. As Fagen wrote after Becker\u2019s death in 2017, the two \u201cstarted writing nutty little tunes on an upright piano in a small sitting room\u201d in the late 1960s, bonding over their shared love of \u201cjazz (from the \u201920s through the mid-\u201960s), W.C. Fields, the Marx Brothers, science fiction, Nabokov, Kurt Vonnegut, Thomas Berger, and Robert Altman films.\u201d\n\nTheir hardcore eclecticism was matched with a penchant for black humor that led Jay and the Americans\u2019 bandleader Jay Black to famously dub them the \u201cManson and Starkweather of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll\u201d during the duo\u2019s pre\u2013Steely Dan stint as members of his touring band. That disposition made them somewhat ill-suited for their original career aspiration, Brill Building songwriters for artists like Barbra Streisand (for whom they did, improbably, land a 1971 album track). So they struck out to the West Coast to form the band\u2019s earliest recording incarnation: one that could handle their complex, razorblade-in-a-candy-apple pop songs.\n\nIt\u2019s a theme that would pop up time and time again through their career: the wheels spinning just a little too fast, the frame of reference just a little too off-kilter, the sheet music just a little too complex to be fully appreciated even at the height of their commercial success. There\u2019s \u201cReelin\u2019 in the Years,\u201d a bitter kiss-off to youthful expediency mistook for a straightforwardly nostalgic anthem. Or the title track from Aja, which smuggles extended solos from jazz legends Wayne Shorter and Steve Gadd onto a silky-smooth, multiplatinum pop album. The band\u2019s catalog invites so much graduate-level analysis that some obsessive fans insisted that their biggest chart hit, 1974\u2019s \u201cRikki Don\u2019t Lose That Number,\u201d was a coded primer on how to send marijuana through the mail. (Becker later denied it, asserting the song is as simple of a romantic come-on as it sounds.)\n\n\u201cSomething like \u2018Bad Sneakers,\u2019 you\u2019re taking a very pop melody but finding these different chords that are modifications of quote-unquote \u2018normal\u2019 chords,\u201d says Winston Cook-Wilson, frontman and songwriter for the Dan-influenced New York band Office Culture and host of the Late Era podcast. \u201cThey move to different keys, doing this really, really difficult stuff.\u201d\n\nAs the \u201970s wore on and they racked up the hits, Steely Dan evolved from the idiosyncratic hitmakers behind radio staples like \u201cDo It Again\u201d and the aforementioned \u201cReelin\u2019 in the Years\u201d to an increasingly studio-focused project, their songs becoming more and more complex. Eventually, like the Beatles and Brian Wilson before them, the group ditched touring altogether in favor of their quest for studio perfection. That resulted in the two records that now stand alone in their discography, metonymic for their singular combination of smoothness and acidity: 1977\u2019s Aja and 1980\u2019s Gaucho, the last they would record before a hiatus of more than a decade.\n\nWhen Pitchfork turned its critical eye to the band\u2019s discography for a \u201cSteely Dan Day\u201d in 2019, the critic Alex Pappademas described Gaucho as a \u201cpathologically overdetermined \u2026 flawless-sounding\u201d record \u201cabout breakups and estrangements and encroaching age and the corrosive effects of hard drugs on human fellowship,\u201d \u201cthe most Steely Dan of the Steely Dan albums.\u201d It\u2019s the Steely Dan of Gaucho and its predecessor that\u2019s lived in the cultural imagination for decades: first with audiences\u2019 gross misperception of them as peddlers of inoffensive elevator music, and now as the shared fixation of a generation less obsessed with its predecessors\u2019 frequently affected \u201cauthenticity\u201d and narrow boundaries of taste.\n\n\u201cA cleaner, smoother aesthetic has seeped into a lot of elements of indie rock and pop; it\u2019s more OK for things to be clean,\u201d says Cook-Wilson. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s their history with rap, and Kanye sampling them, which preceded all of this\u2014listening to Steely Dan in some sense aesthetically is like listening to DJ Quik [records] from 1997\u2026 people caught onto the contrast between their whole vibe and the music itself.\u201d\n\nFor some, that was apparent long before their current resurgence. Gary Daly is the lead singer and co-songwriter for the English new wave band China Crisis, who worked with Becker as a producer and guitarist in the 1980s. Daly described how even in the thick of the art-damaged, authenticity-obsessed \u201980s new wave scene, he and his fellow bandmates gravitated toward the Dan.\n\n\u201cMe and Eddie [Lundon, China Crisis co-founder and co-songwriter] were both aware of them as teenagers, we played Aja, and The Royal Scam, and Can\u2019t Buy a Thrill \u2026 we thought we were the future, but what we were actually doing was marrying [our] kind of songwriting with the genius of Walter and the \u201970s,\u201d Daly says. \u201cThat\u2019s why that came about\u2014it had nothing to do with \u2018are they cool or not cool anymore,\u2019 it was like, their records are amazing, and Eddie was well aware this was an absolute triumph, putting these two things together.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s slightly crude, but you could compare what China Crisis did on their stunning, massively underrated, Becker-featuring 1985 gem Flaunt the Imperfection to the most hypermodern form of \u201cputting two things together,\u201d and the one that\u2019s helped bring the band back into the cultural spotlight: the meme.\n\n@inzane_johnny, the influential Instagram meme account from noise veteran John Olson of Wolf Eyes that has more than 100,000 followers, has prominently fused their esoterica to hypermodern meme formats. Grace Spelman, cohost of The Ringer Music Show, started the \u201cPeople Dancing to Steely Dan\u201d account, which flawlessly mashes up real video of people who were very much not dancing to Steely Dan with the band\u2019s music. A small cult quixotically obsesses over the recovery of \u201cThe Second Arrangement,\u201d the hopelessly \u201clost track\u201d seemingly requisite to any band with such a devoted following.\n\n\u201cWhen I started the account I had absolutely no idea how far it would go,\u201d says Alex, a Brooklynite in his 30s who operates the beloved \u201cGood Steely Dan Takes\u201d Twitter account. (Alex requested partial anonymity.) From just a few hundred followers at its inception, the account has gone on to earn nearly 25,000 of them and a Rolling Stone interview with its creator.\n\n\u201cThe Fagen and Becker worldview, there\u2019s sort of this ironic stance that permeates their music, that for certain circles of Twitter is kind of like a prerequisite,\u201d Alex says. \u201cThere are lines of theirs that almost read like tweets \u2026 \u2018From keyboard man in a rock and ska band, to haulin\u2019 boss crude in the big rigs.\u2019 There\u2019s just a certain similarity to the sensibility of the lyrical approach they took.\u201d\n\nFor someone like Ky Francois of 419 Press, a 24-year-old clothing designer in Portland, Oregon, the appeal is both in sensibility and substance.\n\n\u201cI started collecting vinyl in college, like most people, and a friend\u2019s mom gave me Aja, like, \u2018This is something you need in your collection,\u2019\u201d Francois says. \u201cI started looking at the lyrics and the meaning behind them, and I was like, there\u2019s such a polished sound, and they\u2019re talking about just absolute losers, you know? That, to me, was conceptually really interesting; I was like, this is crazy, these guys are geniuses.\u201d\n\nFrancois was so inspired by Aja that he decided to stay after hours at the Portland screenprinting shop where he works and print his very own pair of custom sweatpants emblazoned in garish streetwear-chic neon with its artwork and various lyrics. After a Twitter user reposted Francois\u2019s Instagram post featuring the one-of-one sweats and it went viral, he decided to do three runs of roughly 100 of the sweatpants, all of them selling out within hours.\n\n\u201cI thought I just made something really weird,\u201d Francois says. \u201cIt took on a hypewear look, but it was about this music from the \u201970s and \u201980s \u2026 I just thought, \u2018OK, I\u2019ve got something really wacky for myself,\u2019 and I didn\u2019t realize how many other young people were interested in it as well.\u201d\n\nWhen young people become interested in the music of the past, it tends to reflect an overall trend in culture. Take, for example, the 2000s-era rehabilitation of Bruce Springsteen. The king of the wall-of-sound, heart-on-your-sleeve anthem was then still largely written off as a schlocky 1980s curio, until similarly earnest songwriters like Conor Oberst and the Arcade Fire\u2019s Win Butler began to name-drop records like his homespun opus Nebraska in interviews. Several years later there was the transformation of Fleetwood Mac from Bill Clinton\u2019s favorite nostalgia act to the totemic predecessors of an increasingly gender-integrated rock world (see: \u201cYou Never Knew,\u201d the masterful Tango in the Night homage from L.A. pop-rockers Haim).\n\n\u201cLike, 2016 or \u201917, that\u2019s when I started to see this creep into the discourse,\u201d says Cook-Wilson. \u201cSteely Dan sections at record stores\u2014I buy a lot of records\u2014you\u2019d start to see those empty out \u2026 it was like in the early 2010s, with a record like [Fleetwood Mac\u2019s] Tusk, these records that Mom and Dad had in their collection you suddenly start to pay attention to.\u201d\n\nSo, again: the generational issue. To understand why the music of Steely Dan, a band so representative of their own generation, resonates so strongly with the descendants with whom they\u2019re supposedly at war, one might start by acknowledging that such frameworks are rarely as simple as they might seem. So when we spoke, I posed the question to Fagen: Is there a line going backward through time that transcends such a simplistic narrative, connecting today\u2019s Dan-obsessed youth, their contemporaneous fans, and even pre-rock hipsters like Jean Shepherd, the radio host and writer beloved by Fagen in his childhood (as memorialized in a 2008 Slate essay)?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a general sense of humor that comes with a realization that what you were taught in school about American history was wrong,\u201d Fagen says. \u201cThere was a language we heard in the media, and in articles in the \u201960s, with the space race, and all that kind of stuff, there was a lot of deceit, and I think a lot of the humor was defensive toward what we realized was going on.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hear that with the Beats, Ferlinghetti, and Ginsberg, and what started out as marginal humor, like Jean Shepherd and other people,\u201d he continued. \u201cNow, why has this suddenly become an interest of younger generations? I\u2019m not sure, except that certainly all of that\u2019s just gotten worse.\u201d\n\nIn other words, as long as false optimism, self-delusion, conformism, superficiality, and all of their cousins hold sway in society, there will be Steely Dan People. That is to say, forever.\n\n\u201cSome things that used to seem cool now seem psychotic, and a lot of things that seemed psychotic are accepted,\u201d Fagen says. \u201cIt may have started in the Reagan era, but when they started cutting funds for education \u2026 it changed the values of people, and they seem to be more gullible than they ever were, and they were plenty gullible when I was a kid.\u201d\n\nAs for the peculiarly modern, extremely online form that the current era of Steely Dan fandom has taken, Fagen says he hasn\u2019t seen much of it. I informed him of the outsized cultural space Aja and Gaucho now occupy, including Francois\u2019s sweatpants, which earned a thoughtful-if-nonplussed grunt. But when I asked his overall thoughts about social media as a cultural engine, however\u2014in his 2013 memoir, Eminent Hipsters, he makes numerous derisive references to the inattentive and ungrateful \u201cTV Babies\u201d that peppered his concert audiences\u2014he expressed concern for the hearts and minds of the next generation of fellow-traveling, wary outsiders.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a kid, I didn\u2019t have a lot of friends, so I was alone a lot, and I had my own interests, which were not the interests of many of my peers,\u201d Fagen says. \u201cNow it seems like everything is decided, whether through trolling, or stuff that\u2019s promoted, through a madness of crowds. I think people need to be more alone, and to turn off their phone, and resign from their social media platforms, or else you don\u2019t really find out who you are. You can\u2019t really do it when you\u2019re surrounded by other people.\u201d\n\nThe ethos Fagen cultivated over all those years is best captured by one of their signature songs, whose lyrics have been immortalized maybe more than any in their discography: 1977\u2019s \u201cDeacon Blues,\u201d a semi-autobiographical tale of a sad sack with similar inclinations to Becker and Fagen but who never quite hit it big. In 2015, the duo broke down the song\u2019s origin for The Wall Street Journal:\n\n\u201cThe protagonist in \u2018Deacon Blues\u2019 is a triple-L loser\u2014an L-L-L Loser,\u201d Becker said. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much about a guy who achieves his dream but about a broken dream of a broken man living a broken life. \u2026 A mystical thing takes place and he\u2019s suddenly aware of his surroundings and life, and starts thinking about his options. The \u2018fine line\u2019 we use in the song \u2026 is the dividing line between being a loser and winner, at least according to his own code. He\u2019s obviously tried to cross it before, without success.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay a guy is living at home at his parents\u2019 house in suburbia,\u201d Fagen told the WSJ. \u201cOne day, when he\u2019s 31, he wakes up and decides he wants to change the way he struts his stuff.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re the kind of person who\u2019s read this far into a feature about Steely Dan, you probably know that the \u201cfine line\u201d between a wisecracking, gimlet-eyed social critic and the morose would-have-been of \u201cDeacon Blues\u201d is just one shot of the scotch whiskey invoked in the song\u2019s chorus. The enduring character of Steely Dan\u2019s music that\u2019s allowed it to outlast the cultural small-mindedness that once put them out of fashion, uniting everyone including, as one Twitter user put it, \u201ctrans girls and boomer dads\u201d in shared affection, is thus: The deck is stacked against the sensitive and yearning in this world, and like a doomed member of a Coen brothers ensemble, they\u2019re more likely than not to meet an ignominious end.\n\nBut to face that reality, absent the gullibility and deceit Fagen described to me, is its own reward (perhaps, obviously, by way of inspiring an anti-hero\u2019s ballad as pitch-black as \u201cDeacon Blues\u201d).\n\n\u201cThey were an unidealistic band at the end of a very idealistic period,\u201d says the critic Carola Dibbell. \u201cThat unidealistic quality probably appeals to their young fans today.\u201d\n\nA point well taken. But \u201cidealism\u201d is decidedly different from having \u201cideals.\u201d And if Steely Dan\u2019s music was free of such things, it wouldn\u2019t have the unexpected emotional resonance that pops up on something like \u201cAny Major Dude Will Tell You,\u201d one of their greatest songs and a rare, revealing flip side to the pity party of \u201cDeacon Blues\u201d:\n\nHave you ever seen a squonk\u2019s tears? Well, look at mine\n\nThe people on the street have all seen better times\n\nAny major dude with half a heart surely will tell you, my friend\n\nAny minor world that breaks apart falls together again\n\nIt\u2019s all there: the obscure literary references, the jazz lingo, the insight to see the world\u2019s flaws and the muted optimism to endure it anyway. Brushing aside the tweets, the irony, Tony Soprano, et al., it\u2019s very easy to see why such a sentiment would ring true with a generation desperate for a guiding ethos in a chaotic time. As Good Steely Dan Takes once tweeted, the band \u201cholds up better in 2020 than it did in the \u201970s. We are all suburban losers dreaming of something meaningful now.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn one hand, it\u2019s terrible, terrible music,\u201d Fagen says with his characteristic wryness. \u201cBut on the other hand, the combination of the music, and the lyrics, the contrast, there\u2019s something Brechtian about the whole project that I think is hopefully valuable.\u201d\n\nThe comparison is apt. In a thoroughly irony-poisoned era, one can imagine the overweening saxophone solos, the crooning background singers, the purposely off-putting lyrical references, as almost necessarily provocative for younger listeners to latch on and discover the songs\u2019 core social critique and big-heartedness.\n\nPlenty of Steely Dan\u2019s contemporaries attempted to deliver both, but none of them matched their sui generis, effortless cool. (As their most famous younger fan once put it: \u201cWhen you try hard, that\u2019s when you die hard.\u201d) The Beats, Brecht, and cryptids aside, Becker and Fagen conjured that through the only real form of cross-demographic communication\u2014simply being themselves.\n\n\u201cThese waves have come of affection and loathing over the years. During the punk era, we took a lot of hits, saying we\u2019re only interested in technique, or perfection, or stuff like that,\u201d Fagen says.\n\n\u201cI think they thought we were the Stan Kenton of the time,\u201d he continues, referring to the mid-century big-band leader derided by hardcore jazz fans for an empty, pompous virtuosity. \u201cBut we never felt that at all. I just thought we were making something beautiful.\u201d\n\nAn earlier version of this piece incorrectly attributed a quote to Alex when it belonged to Good Steely Dan Takes.\n\nDerek Robertson is a writer and critic, the digital editor for Indianapolis Monthly, and a contributing editor to Politico Magazine."}, {"url": "https://www.idolbirthdays.net/dan-stearns", "page_content": "Does Dan Stearns Dead or Alive?\n\nAs per our current Database, Dan Stearns is still alive (as per Wikipedia, Last update: May 10, 2020).\n\n\ud83c\udf82 Dan Stearns - Age, Bio, Faces and Birthday\n\nCurrently, Dan Stearns is 161 years, 7 months and 23 days old.

This is someone ready to do nearly anything to avoid conflict, keeping the peace whenever possible\n\n\ud83c\udf19 Chinese Zodiac Signs\n\nDan Stearns was born in the Year of the Rooster.

While the rest of your bandmates can hide behind guitars, drum kits and keyboards, you have to stand there and sing, which means figuring out something to do with your hands while singing and your whole body when not (good luck if you\u2019re not capable of so much as a single dance move). And if you do play an instrument, you\u2019ve got to do that and remember your lyrics simultaneously, which for some is like patting your head while rubbing your stomach. What\u2019s more, if you write songs that mean something to you, every night is not just a gig but a long trip down memory lane, which can be emotionally draining (not much successful rock is built on pleasant life experiences). Some made this list for their skill, some for their style, but all are worthy of going down in history among the best lead singers ever. So here we present the 50 best to step up to a mic stand. Some ground rules: 1. No solo artists. Thus no David Bowie, Elton John, etc. 2. No people from bands in which everyone sings and there is no clear leader. Thus no members of The Beach Boys, The Beatles, The Zombies, The Band\u2026 3. No people who are mainly known for their work on instruments. Thus no Jimi Hendrix, Bill Nelson, etc. By Daniel Margolis Hit \u201cnext\u201d or click the picture to read on\u2026\n\nRelated: The Best Songs of 2014 (So Far)Related: The Best Albums of 2014 (So Far)\n\n50. Rivers Cuomo\n\nBand: Weezer Weezer\u2019s Rivers Cuomo is a top-notch songwriter and an accomplished guitarist, but none of that would matter if it wasn\u2019t for his voice. Cuomo\u2019s quirky confidence has the listener rooting for him almost instantly; his singing the audio equivalent of Jason Schwartzman\u2019s character in Rushmore. Meanwhile, Cuomo is canny enough to utilize his vocals as a key compositional instrument. Listen to the demo of \u201cBuddy Holly\u201d on Alone: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo; he already has every \u201coooeeeooo,\u201d \u201coh oh\u201d and \u201cooo ooo\u201d perfectly in place, all obviously essential to the song. Lyrically, Cuomo expertly tosses around key reference points of suburban masculinity like girlfriends, fathers, stepfathers, the garage, surfboards, vacations and unrequited love. After two perfect initial albums, Cuomo disappeared to go to Harvard and watch Friends reruns for five years, finally returning for a half-dozen albums that seem to make Weezer\u2019s fans more cultishly devoted or pissed off.\n\n49. H.R.\n\nRelated Stories STORY CONTINUES BELOW Green Label - The Best Female Lead Singers\n\nBand: Bad Brains A lot of lead singers face the challenge of fronting a band that shifts genres, but this generally happens over time, either as a subtle expansion of a band\u2019s capabilities or experimentation meant to serve a set of songs or capitalize on a hot musical trend (or both). But D.C. band Bad Brains burst out in the early \u201880s already set on swerving back and forth between hardcore punk and reggae, requiring lead singer H.R. to sing both convincingly \u2013 no easy feat. He did it with no problem; performing the punk songs with an authentic, high-speed yelp and the reggae songs in a soulful voice with just a slight hint of Jamaican Patois. Lyrically, too, H.R. swings both ways, singing about being \u201cBanned in D.C.\u201d for his \u201cAttitude\u201d before addressing Jah at length. The late Adam Yauch was a huge fan, and Beastie Boys went on to take stabs at punk and reggae as well, an approach likely informed by Bad Brains.\n\n48. Milo Aukerman\n\nBand: Descendents No, not Malin Akerman; though if she fronted an SST band, the comments section on the A.V. Club Newswire item announcing it would probably crash the site. Descendents\u2019 front man Milo Aukerman distinguished himself in the annals of American punk by being an unabashed nerd (to be fair, a lot of punks were nerds but took pains to hide that). This was reflected in the band\u2019s music; singing in a gravelly tenor with a bit more charisma than the average punk barker on the band\u2019s 22-minute debut Milo Goes To College, Aukerman delivers lyrics skewering stock punk targets like \u201cParents\u201d but also insists that he\u2019s not a loser or a punk. Descendents, it seemed, aspired to a successful middle-class existence, with Aukerman announcing on \u201cSuburban Home,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want no hippie pad. I want a house just like Mom and Dad.\u201d Just as the album\u2019s title predicted, Aukerman departed to study biology at the University of California, San Diego, eventually earning a Ph.D in biochemistry (blatantly copying him, punk pretenders the Offspring\u2019s frontman Dexter Holland was a Ph.D. candidate in molecular biology at the University of Southern California). After a couple years off, Descendents reconvened to continue inventing pop punk during breaks in Aukerman\u2019s academic career.\n\n47. Keith Relf\n\nBand: Yardbirds It\u2019s difficult for any lead singer to deal with ego clashes with his band\u2019s lead guitarist. So it\u2019s a testament to the Yardbirds\u2019 Keith Relf\u2019s level-headedness that he was able to deal with not one, not two, but three of the most famous guitarists in rock history; Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page. Relf proved a welcoming tour guide for the band\u2019s journey from blues rave-ups through psychedelia and on to the earliest signposts pointing toward hard rock and heavy metal. But his band\u2019s star players consistently decamping for more successful bands left Relf up a creek without a paddle; he died while playing an improperly grounded guitar in 1976.\n\n46. Mary Timony\n\nBand: Helium, Autoclave, Wild Flag Courtney Love was supposed to be the disheveled goddess of \u201890s rock, but the prize actually goes to the superior Mary Timony, who chased Love\u2019s rival Mary Lou Lord out of Helium and commandeered it for two classic albums and a handful of EPs. Backed by an all-male band, including Polvo\u2019s Ash Bowie on lumbering, melodic bass guitar, Timony tears a hole through indie rock on the band\u2019s debut, 1995\u2019s The Dirt Of Luck, via steamrolling tracks like \u201cPat\u2019s Trick\u201d and \u201cMedusa.\u201d But Helium also had a sublimely soft touch where needed, using this to gorgeous effect on \u201cHoneycomb.\u201d Vocally, Timony sticks with an understated, monotone vocal style common to the genre, singing in an upper register only to accent lines here and there. Lyrically, she ranges from personal specifics (\u201call of my friends in L.A. love me more than you\u201d) to ren faire fare like dragons and \u201cMedieval People.\u201d Meanwhile, in concert and in particular in Helium\u2019s videos, Timony played her sleepy Lolita look to the hilt. She looks more like a cool mom with her current band Wild Flag but her enviable songwriting and heartbreaking voice are not at all diminished.\n\n45. Yamantaka Eye\n\nBand: Boredoms Boredoms isn\u2019t really the type of band that has or needs a lead singer, but if it has a frontman, Eye is it. Hailing from Japan, Boredoms started off as a pioneering noise unit in the 1980s, boasting a fluctuating roster of over a dozen members; Eye leading the proceedings with a lot of shouting, screaming, grunting, gargling and fart noises. In the \u201890s, the band edged closer and closer to tunefulness; starting with Chocolate Synthesizer and moving through the Super Roots series before eventually arriving at Vision Creation Newsun. With the band\u2019s newfound sense of sonic purpose, Eye came to sing more, although all with the goal of leading the band through long jams and vocal passages that sounded ceremonial; as if Boredoms was becoming more of a tribe than a band. This culminated with 2005\u2019s Seadrum/House of Sun and the band\u2019s subsequent tours, which saw it abandon conventional instrumentation in favor of three full drum kits played simultaneously and Eye shouting and banging away on a rack of effects and other props; including a giant stand of seven guitars glued together, each tuned to a different note. It\u2019s difficult to imagine the concept of a rock band\u2019s frontman, or even music itself, deconstructed more boldly than this.\n\n44. Mike Patton\n\nBand: Faith No More Mike Patton has fronted a number of bands, but the one that had the most impact is Faith No More. FNM labored in relative obscurity for its first couple albums until the video for \u201cEpic,\u201d a single from the band\u2019s third album, 1989\u2019s The Real Thing, came exploding out of television sets. The clip featured some shocking images \u2013 a fish flopping to death; an exploding piano; a hand with an eye embedded in it spraying green paint and lightning bolts; etc. \u2013 but the thing that stuck with you was Patton himself staring you down to deliver amateurish yet convincingly rapped lyrics and a wailed and grunted chorus of denial: \u201cYou want it all but you can\u2019t have it.\u201d Patton expanded his range on subsequent albums; on Angel Dust he summons up the startling \u201cRV,\u201d a waltz-like carousel worthy of Tom Waits that throws in a big rock moment out of nowhere in the middle of the song. In this century, Patton\u2019s legacy seems assured; a 2006 episode of All My Children, of all things, saw one character snapping at another, \u201cMike Patton is not God.\u201d\n\n43. Damon Albarn\n\nBand: Blur, Gorillaz, The Good The Bad & The Queen, Rocket Juice & The Moon Damon Albarn is a restlessly creative artist who is as at home belting out witty, observational pop songs to a rapturous Glastonbury crowd as he is writing and scoring an opera about an adventuring monkey. Not content with being one of the foremost proponents of the Britpop movement, the high point being the critically acclaimed and commercially adored Parklife and The Great Escape, Albarn then went on to great success with Gorillaz, and continues to pop up with a new supergroup or project every few years. While a new generation of fans may know Albarn for the funky \u201cClint Eastwood\u201d or \u201c19-2000\u201d Albarn\u2019s best work was as the wry, quintessentially British voice of a bored 90\u2019s Britain, and the frenzied reaction to Blur\u2019s reunion shows that this singular band and their legendary are as loved today as they ever were.\n\n42. Layne Staley\n\nBand: Alice In Chains In the 2009 movie Terminator Salvation, John Connor\u2019s father Kyle Reese whines at his evil robot friend Marcus Wright, \u201cC\u2019mon man, we need to get out of L.A.,\u201d and just at that moment Wright fires up a hot-wired jeep and Alice In Chains\u2019 Vietnam anthem \u201cRooster\u201d begins playing from its stereo. The two stare at each other in disbelief for 18 seconds before Reese asks, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d The cybernetic organism answers, \u201cSomething my brother used to listen to.\u201d Exactly; Alice In Chains sounded like something your vaguely menacing sibling in the next room would listen to, and it had a great frontman in Layne Staley. He harmonized perfectly with Chains guitarist and songwriter Jerry Cantrell \u2013 surely a prerequisite for success in this band \u2013 and dug down deeper into a song while singing on his own. When the band softened its sound on the Jar Of Flies EP, Staley shined on the roomier material and AIC scored MTV hits with \u201cNo Excuses\u201d and \u201cI Stay Away.\u201d After a third album with Alice In Chains, he disappeared in 1996 and died of a drug overdose in 2002.\n\n41. Chrissie Hynde\n\nBand: The Pretenders It\u2019d be an insult to say Chrissie Hynde sings like a guy, but she\u2019s sure no shrinking violet. The Pretenders \u2013 a quartet of three English guys and a girl from Akron, Ohio \u2013 got its start as part of the \u201870s U.K. punk scene. Hynde fronted the band singing in an assertive croon that sounded killer over guitar workouts like \u201cTattooed Love Boys\u201d and a great cover of the Kinks \u201cStop Your Sobbing\u201d (Hynde had a kid with Ray Davies the following decade) on the band\u2019s self-titled debut. And when the Pretenders softened its sound on \u201cBrass In Pocket\u201d it scored a top 40 hit; Hynde\u2019s tomboy vocals perfectly expressed the perspective of a working class girl who feels, \u201cI\u2019m special, got to have some of your attention\u201d (to underscore this, the accompanying video had her playing a little-noticed waitress). By the band\u2019s third album, 1984\u2019s Learning To Crawl, Hynde had the balance between rock rebel girl and every-woman appeal down to a science, scoring back-to-back hits with \u201cMiddle Of The Road\u201d and \u201cBack On The Chain Gang.\u201d\n\n40. Julian Casablancas\n\nBand: The Strokes With a casually assured nasal delivery, rock-star good looks and a hedonistic outlook on life, Julian Casablancas and The Strokes, along with his British equivalent Pete Doherty, dominated the early 2000\u2019s with their fuzzy garage rock revival. Albert Hammond Jr, Fab Moretti and Nikolai Fraiture are no doubt excellent musicians, but the focal point of The Strokes has, and always will be Julian Casablancas, the perfect modern frontman, who can give off an air of disinterest in the music industry one moment, and un-ironically proclaim that his legacy will be as one \u201cwho leave clues for the next generation\u2026clues that help feed the human race\u201d the next.\n\n39. Ian Gillan\n\nBand: Deep Purple In 1969, Deep Purple fired its original lead singer Rod Evans and replaced him with Ian Gillan, who brought with him a new bassist, Roger Glover, so the band\u2019s old one, Nick Simper, was sacked as well. The overall personnel change was a good move; it allowed Deep Purple to transform itself from a second-tier psych-rock band into a heavy metal behemoth just as the market was moving in this direction. The band\u2019s first Gillan-led LP was Deep Purple In Rock; the cover of which depicted the band\u2019s members on Mount Rushmore. The music inside was monumental enough to match; particularly Gillan\u2019s contributions. He belted out uptempo rock numbers and thrillingly veered into an upper register whenever he needed to punctuate a line. The album\u2019s chilling centerpiece is \u201cChild in Time\u201d \u2013 a 10-minute protest of the Vietnam War that sees Gillan singing, \u201cSweet child in time you\u2019ll see the line \u2026 I wanna hear you scream!\u201d (Axl must have been taking notes.) Deep Purple wisely soldiered on with this galvanized line-up; Gillan leading the band on massive hits like \u201cHighway Star\u201d and \u201cSmoke On The Water.\u201d He and Glover pulled out of DP in 1973 over tensions with guitarist Ritchie Blackmore. Deep Purple soldiered on with David Coverdale as its frontman but it was never the same; it was Gillan who had shaken it out of the hippie dream as it retooled itself as a competitive band.\n\n38. Rob Halford\n\nBand: Judas Priest Judas Priest\u2019s lead singer Rob Halford spent the first quarter-century of his career in the closet, officially anyway, something he has said caused him sufficient depression to fuel his addiction to drugs and alcohol. But repressed or not, Halford still projected his homosexuality on the customarily macho heavy metal community and fan base. In fronting Priest, he dressed like a leather-clad S&M gay sex fantasy, and the massive success of his band ensured this look became fashionable. In an amusing twist, a peer group that likely would not have accepted Halford\u2019s sexual orientation eagerly accepted, in some cases even appropriated, a look that expressed same. But this never would have come about if not for Halford\u2019s fantastic vocals; he barked, stretched and screamed notes across a four-octave range over Priest\u2019s frenetic, constantly shifting rock anthems. The result was one of the most successful \u2013 both critically and commercially \u2013 British heavy metal bands of the 1970s and \u201880s, guiding the genre from clubs to stadiums and onto MTV\u2019s airwaves.\n\n37. Steve Malkmus\n\nBand: Pavement Pavement\u2019s Steve Malkmus is one of indie rock\u2019s few true alpha males (in speaking to Pitchfork in 2010, he dismissed this as \u201cnot much of a burden, \u2018cause it\u2019s a pretty benign culture, \u2018cause nobody\u2019s gunning for me. Lou Barlow\u2019s not over there going, \u2018Oh, man\u2019), but makes it look easy by projecting a relaxed relatability in his singing. Simply put, he doesn\u2019t try too hard (Pavement\u2019s first drummer once complained that Malkmus can actually play guitar a lot better than he does on its albums), which served to disguise his brilliant songs enough to eschew any resentments that ambition might have invited and ensure the band sounded fun. He generally sings like he just woke up from a nap; only working his way up to a shout in order to honor his influences (the Fall on \u201cTwo States\u201d) or mock his peers (Nirvana on \u201cFlux = Rad\u201d). Malkmus is even capable of reaching deep within himself for gorgeous ballads like \u201cStare\u201d or \u201cStrings Of Nashville\u201d (of course he buried those on the B-sides of singles). His lyrics, meanwhile, are extremely oblique \u2013 Malkmus has said that even if he sits down and looks at them typed out he still has no idea what they mean \u2013 but they sure sound cool.\n\n36. Steve Marriott\n\nBand: Small Faces, Humble Pie Not as well known as many of his peers in \u201860s and \u201870s English rock, Steve Marriott is something of a musician\u2019s musician. No less an authority than Keith Richards once said, \u201cProbably, really, my favorite other bands ever, Steve Marriott\u2019s, very much from the English point of view,\u201d going on to specify his bands were better than Led Zeppelin, the Who and Black Sabbath \u2013 rather esteemed company. He got his start as a child actor before quitting to pursue music (this caused a rather large rift with his parents), presently founding the Small Faces with himself on guitar, Ronnie Lane on bass, Kenney Jones on drums and Ian McLagan on keyboards. The Small Faces were together from 1965 to 1968, making a progression more or less typical of the period; they start off with songs about girls and dancing and quickly work their way up to a psychedelic concept album. But the band sounded crisp and fantastic; particularly Marriott, who inhabits these songs singing at times like a mod dandy but elsewhere stretching out into the rocking rasp that he\u2019d fully explore with his next band. Marriott quit the Small Faces at the end of 1968, frustrated with its pop image and inability to handle his increasingly sophisticated material. Lane, Jones and McLagan snatched Rod Stewart and Ron Wood from the Jeff Beck Group and ditched the \u201cSmall\u201d to form the Faces. Marriott, then, formed Humble Pie with guitarist Peter Frampton, who\u2019d been considered as a member of the Small Faces the previous year. Humble Pie fixed all Marriott\u2019s problems with the Small Faces \u2013 it was a hard rock band. Here, he was free to do nothing but rock and sing songs like he meant it; nothing required a softer touch. That was the only problem with Humble Pie; the abject lack of pop moves meant it was quite earnest in its rockingness; a turn-off for some. Marriott probably never saw quite the success his talent deserved, but his downfall was largely his own doing. Touring America didn\u2019t suit him; he drank too much, did too many drugs and started to exhibit signs of schizophrenia. He alienated his wife, who left him 1973, and his band, which broke up in 1975. He died in 1991 after passing out drunk and alone with a lit cigarette, which set his house ablaze.\n\n35. John Fogerty\n\nBand: Creedence Clearwater Revival Creedence Clearwater Revival\u2019s John Fogerty hails from California, specifically the Bay Area, but listening to his singing you\u2019d never know it. A lot of white musicians who got started in the \u201860s affectedly mimicked black bluesmen, but Fogerty came disturbingly close; he nails most everything about the style, singing in a voice that almost always sounded torn to shreds and even pronouncing every single word \u2013 right down to the syllables \u2013 such that you\u2019d think he was from the American south. As contrived as that might seem, Fogerty had the confidence to pull it off; listening to any CCR album, you never find yourself questioning his authenticity. The band\u2019s earliest albums were very direct, raw blues-rock records, until Fogerty began to experiment with the form; bending it into anthems like \u201cBorn On The Bayou\u201d and \u201cGreen River.\u201d He even got political with \u201cFortunate Son,\u201d the best anti-Vietnam song anywhere in an era full of them, and \u201cRun Through The Jungle,\u201d which captured Fogerty\u2019s thoughts on gun control.\n\n34. Ronnie James Dio\n\nBand: Elf, Rainbow, Black Sabbath, Heaven & Hell, Dio In 1979, Black Sabbath fired Ozzy Osbourne, fed up with his rampant alcoholism. It\u2019s a little surprising that after eight albums, Black Sabbath was willing and able to replace a member as central as its lead singer, but that it did. What\u2019s more, the replacement came from an unlikely source; Ozzy\u2019s future wife Sharon suggested the band hire former Rainbow frontman Ronnie James Dio. It was revitalized as a result. Sabbath\u2019s last three or four albums with Ozzy had seen the band more and more bogged down in studio perfectionism and technique with equal amounts of drug and alcohol abuse and fatigue thrown in. The results were frequently not good; few people are technically in ecstasy while listening to Technical Ecstasy. But with Dio, the band sounded fresh. In the book The Story of Black Sabbath: Wheels of Confusion, Tommy Iommi explains why: \u201cDio would sing across the riff, whereas Ozzy would follow the riff, like in \u2018Iron Man.\u2019 Ronnie came in and gave us another angle on writing.\u201d After two brilliant albums \u2013 Heaven And Hell and Mob Rules \u2013 Dio left in a dispute over mixing a live album. For the next three decades, Dio and Ozzy circled each other as the on-again, off-again lead singers of Black Sabbath, until 2010 when Dio once again thwarted expectations by dying before Ozzy.\n\n33. James Hetfield\n\nBand: Metallica In the earliest days of Metallica, James Hetfield just barked his lyrics; you get the sense that he sang only because someone had to and he was the natural choice as he concentrated on his fretboard a little less. The main thing you notice is how young Hetfield sounds; he was just 19 years old when the band recorded Kill \u2018Em All. As Metallica pounded out more albums, his voice grew deeper and more terrifying, particularly on Master Of Puppets, with Hetfield shining on classics like \u201cThe Thing That Should Not Be\u201d (if you want to hear true evil, buy the 45 RPM pressing of this album and listen to it at 33 1/3 \u2013 Hetfield sounds like a foul demon crawled up out of hell and formed a rock band). Against all odds, Metallica scored an MTV hit with \u201cOne\u201d in 1988; Hetfield really sings and it turned out he was very good at it, slowly building to the frenzied shouting that previously would have served as his starting point. Metallica continued to court commercial success with its self-titled 1991 release, then lost the plot in the latter half of the decade before making a comeback with 2003\u2019s St. Anger, an album largely built around Hetfield\u2019s struggles to come to terms with himself. Lyrically, Hetfield\u2019s previous best work had addressed topics like \u201cnuclear winter and shape-shifting,\u201d to quote Chuck Klosterman, but it turned out self-reflection suited him.\n\n32. Noddy Holder\n\nBand: Slade Despite singing in a voice that generally sounded like he was shouting at the top of his lungs, Noddy Holder led Slade to massive success \u2013 the band even cut a Christmas song fit for the ages. Slade was possessed of a terrific if somewhat rudimentary level of musicianship, and Holder jumped on top of this and punched his fist through every song it recorded; upping the volume on his vocals until it was guaranteed the band\u2019s songs would be bellowed along with in every pub from Wolverhampton to London and well beyond. The key was that Holder was as musical as he was loud; ensuring his high-octane vocals delivered infectious melodies. It helped that his party-anthem lyrics drew a generational line in the sand; witness, he starts \u201cMama Weer All Crazee Now\u201d by sneering the line \u201cI don\u2019t want to drink my whiskey like you do.\u201d And despite all the noize, Holder was able to tone it down when he needed to, like on Slade\u2019s hit ballad, \u201cHow Does It Feel,\u201d which Oasis\u2019 Noel Gallagher called \u201cone of the best songs written, in the history of pop, ever.\u201d He could even act; in the band\u2019s 1975 movie Slade In Flame, Holder\u2019s charisma goes further than the other members in depicting the compromises involved in a well-promoted rock band\u2019s success.\n\n31. Robin Zander\n\nBand: Cheap Trick To truly excel as a frontman, a lead singer needs to be a bit of a pretty boy, and in this arena few can outmatch Cheap Trick\u2019s Robin Zander. Just check out cover of the band\u2019s debut; the other three members look forced into their suits, while Zander looks like he was born in his. His glamorous looks would have been annoying if he didn\u2019t match them with a voice perfectly suited to everything about Cheap Trick; he sings with a sugar-coated sheen where required and then ramps up to raging, yet still note-perfect, boom on short notice. All in all he was a perfect canvas for oddball guitarist and primary songwriter Rick Nielsen\u2019s fixation on sex and romance and heavy bent toward English power pop. And on At Budokan, Zander set the standard for any rock band attempting to communicate with Japanese schoolgirls: \u201cThis next one \u2026 is the first song \u2026 on our new album.\u201d\n\n30. Pete Doherty\n\nBand: The Libertines, Babyshambles Though Pete Doherty may be known for his many run-ins with the law, his crucial role as the former frontman of The Libertines and Babyshambles shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. The singer/songwriter first lent his talents to The Libertines and created a massive fanbase thanks to Doherty\u2019s inexplicably alluring aura, partly created through his uncaring attitude, and his natural ability to craft catchy songs laced with that reckless, punk edge. Unfortunately, as with many rock stars, Doherty succumbed to and became heavily involved with drugs, which led to the breaking up of The Libertines. Eventually, Pete Doherty resurrected his raucous sound with the birth of Babyshambles. Lyrically, Doherty provided for his bands the modus operandi of the punk culture, channelling its very riotous heart and nihilistic soul. While romantic ventures were often cited in his lyrics, mentions of drugs and partying never far behind, and Doherty masterfully ties it all together. Present in his lyrics is a level of sophistication, verging on poetic, but this would often be detracted by show cancellations and Doherty\u2019s trouble with the law. It\u2019s this interesting combination of a creative, intelligent mind and a life marred by drugs that makes Doherty and his music so interesting. Hell, even Kate Moss thought so.\n\n29. Bono\n\nBand: U2 While Queen\u2019s 1985 Live Aid performance was the biggest highlight of the charity concert, a small band from Dublin got a press for the lead singer\u2019s slow dancing with a member of the audience in the middle of their set. Apparently she was having trouble breathing which Bono noticed and pulled her out from the crowd. Whether debating if that is true or not, that moment made U2 rock stars and was a small glimpse at the rock messiah personality that Bono would later embrace, for better or worse. Initially angry and politically charged Bono\u2019s lyrics matured into a more passionate, often spiritual and deeply personal tone. Bono\u2019s energy and emotive voice, when paired with Edge\u2019s unique sound made U2, a hugely popular band who continue to play for massive crowds in cities all around the world. Pretty impressive for a band that\u2019s been together since 1976.\n\n28. Thom Yorke\n\nBand: Radiohead For the first decade of Radiohead\u2019s career, Thom Yorke was famous as the Incredible Sulk; a difficult interview subject and a seemingly mostly unhappy person. But in the past decade a funny thing happened; he\u2019s started to enjoy himself; his performances with Radiohead characterized by goofy grinning and funny dancing. Maybe it\u2019s because in 2006 he finally cut a solo album and then formed a second band \u2013 Atoms For Peace \u2013 with Flea in 2009 and came to realize he\u2019d already been fronting a great band for years. Whatever the reason, Yorke has grown in fits and starts over Radiohead\u2019s quarter-century together, going from a first-class singer-songwriter hiding within a very capable quintet to an irrepressible character in absolute control of his talent. There\u2019s nothing that can be said about his voice or creative prowess that hasn\u2019t already been said. Really, fans of Yorke and his various projects should just be glad he\u2019s beaten back his various states of loathing and settled into a relatively prolific mid-career hot streak.\n\n27. Peter Gabriel\n\nBand: Genesis Prog rock didn\u2019t produce a lot of great lead singers. It was a musical genre so consumed with music theory, technique and equipment that the human voice was treated like a comparatively pedestrian element; just a chore to be attended to. For example, it\u2019s difficult to name anyone who fronted King Crimson, while Pink Floyd cared so little about vocals it let Roger Waters sing entire songs. But Genesis was the exception. It had a perfect lead singer in Peter Gabriel, who boasted an expressive voice and searching intellect. Gabriel even worked costume changes into Genesis\u2019 concerts; dressing up as a fox, a bat, a flower and other characters drawn from his lyrics, which became more and more theatrical as the band proceeded through six albums from 1969 to \u201974. All of this grated on the other band members (would you want to play guitar next to a guy covered in inflatable genitalia?) but they were still devastated when Gabriel announced his intention to leave the band (in Genesis\u2019 VH1 Behind the Music, he says \u201cIt was a bit like telling someone \u2018I\u2019ve decided to kill your child\u2019\u201d). Gabriel and Genesis survived without each other but neither was ever as cool or weird again.\n\n26. Axl Rose\n\nBand: Guns N\u2019 Roses In a 1999 Spin cover story on Guns N\u2019 Roses, Poison\u2019s Brett Michaels described seeing the band in its earliest days, \u201cThere were maybe 15 people in the club and Axl was playing as if he were in front of a million people.\u201d This nicely sums up the drive and determination that make Axl undeniable. Watch any song on GNR\u2019s two-part concert video World Tour 1992 In Tokyo for proof; few people could get onstage wearing nothing but a pair of biker shorts, a leather jacket and a cowboy hat (just one of an array of daringly horrifying outfits Axl sports here) and sell two dozen songs betraying not an ounce of self-doubt. Axl, when performing, clearly believes in himself, and gives audiences no choice but to follow suit. And then there\u2019s his voice. Axl\u2019s mostly associated with his trademark Janis Joplin-esque screech, but his singing is actually much more elastic than that; he ranges from a calm, measured baritone to those high-pitched tones, often in a single song. Lyrically, no one mines personal melodrama better \u2013 any Guns album doubles as a therapy session for Axl, making it all the more impressive that he\u2019s able to rip through these songs in concert night after night. He may be \u201cfucking crazy\u201d but there\u2019s a method to his madness.\n\n25. Morrissey\n\nBand: The Smiths The unmistakeable baritone. The haircut. The lyrics that make you realize, \u201cgee, my day wasn\u2019t so bad after all,\u201d or help you find solace if you have been down. As the lead singer of the Smiths, iconic British vocalist Morrissey built a feverishly loyal fan base and a reputation as one of heartbreak\u2019s greatest troubadours, reshaping the sound of British pop and rock with a vision often as bleak as it was catchy. With an eye for topics often ignored in straightforward pop (child molestation, homosexuality, class, British politics, murder), a great handle on relationship woes, and a tremendously literate wit, Morrissey transformed songs like \u201cHeaven Knows I\u2019m Miserable Now\u201d with black humor, unusual imagery, and the sort of specificity that breathes life into lyrics with the spark of detail. Morrissey\u2019s impact, both as a lead singer and solo artist, wouldn\u2019t likely be as great without his deep, clarion voice, adding weight and subtext to every line. Throughout his career, Morrissey would come to be known beyond the bounds of his music, embroiled in musical feuds, accused of racism, outspoken in politics, and embattled in his quest to keep his private life private.\n\n24. Henry Rollins\n\nBand: Black Flag Confrontational L.A. punk band Black Flag had three lead singers before Henry Rollins joined and fronted the band for its six actual albums. Was he its best frontman? Not according to Rollins himself; he has said The First Four Years, which compiles everything the band did before he joined, is his favorite record by the band. But Rollins had a certain something that was hard to put your finger on. He sure seemed like a jock asshole, but listen to how his vocals on Damaged sound like a man on the verge of leading an aimless civil disturbance. As Flag grew as a band, so did Rollins; his lyrics became increasingly disturbing as the band slowed its tempo, allowing him to be more clearly heard. Rollins\u2019 finest hour with the band was probably Family Man, which was programmed as spoken word on the A-side, instrumental jams on the B-side. Rollins took full advantage of this showcase; delivering brilliant monologues on domesticity, slugs, rats, the telephone book and other aspects of life in the slums of Hollywood. In the process, he set up a second career for himself as a public speaker, a sideline Rollins continues to profit from to this day, making speaking engagements at universities and clubs.\n\n23. Ozzy Osbourne\n\nBand: Black Sabbath Before he was scourge of the Christian right for God knows whatever reason; further before he was sued by the parents of suicidal teenagers; and way before he was a pill-addled reality show dad, Ozzy Osbourne was, quite simply, one of the greatest lead singers of any English band of the 1970s. For whatever reason, critics and audiences viewed Black Sabbath as more extreme \u2013 and the band was therefore more vilified \u2013 than contemporaries like Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, etc. The fact is they mined similar territory, Sabbath was just more in your face about it, and as a result Ozzy\u2019s vocals came across as a shot in the dark, a desperate man striking out across a void. If you listen to him closely on any Sabbath track, he doesn\u2019t sound demonic; far from it, he sounds all too human, he even struggles to nail a note here and there. Further, Ozzy seems less frightening than frightened; check out how after every verse on \u201cBlack Sabbath,\u201d the first track on the band\u2019s first album, Ozzy cries out \u201cOh no!\u201d as if absolutely petrified. What made Sabbath seem evil, really, was its sincerely \u2013 it didn\u2019t bother to couch dark subject matter in any kind of mysticism, instead addressing it head on.\n\n22. Bryan Ferry\n\nBand: Roxy Music Even in the glammed-out rock climate of early-\u201870s England, it must have taken balls to sing like Bryan Ferry; he boldly wears an affected vibrato that makes you want to climb onstage and punch him in the face. But somehow it worked, and over eight albums released in a decade, it was unimaginable to picture the pioneering Roxy Music fronted by anyone but him. Even having lost Brian Eno after its first two albums, Ferry\u2019s vision ensured the band continued at full strength (Eno later called Roxy Music\u2019s first LP without him, Stranded, his favorite). And like any great lead singer, Ferry demonstrated amazing range; for proof, check out \u201cIf There Is Something\u201d on Roxy\u2019s debut. The song starts in the mode of a breezy country rock number and Ferry follows suit; he sounds casual and happy. Then, at 1:38, the song transitions into a somber, epic mood and Ferry makes a jarring shift in tone, singing \u201cI would do anything for you! I would climb mountains! I would swim on the ocean floor,\u201d sounding like a man in the midst of an emotional meltdown. That predilection for romantic melodrama carried over to the band\u2019s album covers, all of eight of which featured women worth fawning over \u2013 and most of the time they were Ferry\u2019s girlfriends.\n\n21. Jeff Mangum\n\nBand: Neutral Milk Hotel Neutral Milk Hotel hasn\u2019t released a proper full-length since 1998\u2019s classic, In the Aeroplane Over the Sea, and Jeff Mangum\u2019s public appearances over the past decade have been impossible to predict, but the man with the instantly recognizable voice has a following forever secured by his contribution to indie music. Off stage he\u2019s an enigmatic, reserved man who keeps his personal life to himself, but he\u2019s got the kind of voice that fills a room and draws attention like a siren, straining itself to that point that sits perfectly on the border of a breaking point. Maybe it\u2019s because of his cult following and enigmatic ways, or maybe it\u2019s despite it, but there\u2019s something magical about Mangum\u2019s delivery that flirts with the stuff folklore is made of.\n\n20. Jack White\n\nBand: The White Stripes, The Raconteurs Over the course of six White Stripes studio albums Jack White cemented his place as one of the most iconic frontmen of the 21st Century. With an instantly recognizable shock of unruly black hair and a raw, strangled delivery, White understood the importance of image and myth, creating an aura of mystery for himself with obfuscatory interview answers, and setting the band apart by only appearing in red, white or black clothing for official duties. But of course you need more than an image to be a great frontman, and Jack White\u2019s frenzied stage presence, incredible guitar skills, and a knack for writing simple but direct lyrics focussing on love, life, and the women in it, mean he is as vital now he\u2019s gone solo as he was when he was ripping through the weighty riffs of \u201cDead Leaves And The Dirty Ground.\u201d\n\n19. Roger Daltrey\n\nBand: The Who At the start of the Who, Roger Daltrey\u2019s role was fairly simple; he stood in front of the band and sang Pete Townshend\u2019s songs, something Townshend himself was too timid to do. In his just published memoirs, Townshend speaks of the confidence the far tougher Daltrey lent him in the band\u2019s earliest days: \u201cJust the fact of Roger speaking to me meant that my life could very well change.\u201d As the \u201860s progressed, Townshend came to sing some of his songs for himself, but Daltrey\u2019s role in the band evolved as well. Townshend describes the singer\u2019s stage presence at Woodstock: \u201cHis long, curly hair looked like golden fire. He was mostly singing with his eyes firmly closed. \u2026 His whirling microphone and mythical poses suggested frustration and pain, his sweat an angelic sheen that evoked an old-master painting.\u201d No one could better describe how Daltrey transformed himself from a mod with a close-cropped haircut to a triumphant golden god whose look Robert Plant closely copied. Daltrey has fronted the Who for five decades now, taking it from maximum R&B though the birth of the concept album and on to hard rock, all the while working with (or around) the whims of the iconoclastic Townshend.\n\n18. David Lee Roth\n\nBand: Van Halen Despite employing a revolving door of lead singers in over three decades as a band, Van Halen\u2019s definitive frontman is David Lee Roth. He may be written off for his clownish antics, but Roth actually sings soulfully when it serves the song (check out how he bends up to a high note on the first line of \u201cHot For Teacher\u201d) and, quite honestly, this band absolutely requires a singer with an outsized personality to command any attention surrounded by Eddie Van Halen\u2019s dazzling guitar playing. Besides, without someone ensuring Van Halen was infused with a lot of fun, the band risked getting bogged down in music theory and might have seen much less success. Whether singing about girls, sex, partying, cars or jumping, DLR always sounds like he\u2019s having the time of his life, a level of energy that\u2019s infectious. And Roth\u2019s spoken banter is often as memorable as any other moment on a Van Halen album; how many singers would use a post-guitar-solo pause in the middle of a song to ask, \u201cHave you seen junior\u2019s grades?\u201d\n\n17. David Byrne\n\nBand: Talking Heads Most lead singers who have the advantage of being brilliant songwriters stack the deck in their favor, writing songs for themselves to sing perfectly suited to their vocal range. But Talking Heads frontman David Byrne wasn\u2019t interested in doing himself such favors, instead writing songs that were mostly just a bit above his range so he\u2019d have to strain and yelp to sing them, creating an audible counterpart for the discomfort his music sought to express. In Talking Heads, Byrne sang about love, as all singers do, but primarily how uneasy it made him and how alien it seemed (\u201cLove \u2192 Building On Fire\u201d). Once he found a girl, she wasn\u2019t conquered but rather placed on a pedestal (\u201cThank You For Sending Me An Angel\u201d). He mostly concerned himself with larger topics \u2013 the government, employment, housing, cities, etc. \u2013 but always maintained a detachment such that they seemed entirely new. In concert, Byrne was always kind of goofy (witness his lamp dance in Stop Making Sense), which translated better in the band\u2019s music videos; its clips for hits like \u201cBurning Down the House\u201d and \u201cWild Wild Life\u201d were staples of the then-nascent MTV.\n\n16. Steven Tyler\n\nBand: Aerosmith Steven Tyler has long been accused of imitating Mick Jagger, who recently responded with an imitation of Tyler when he hosted Saturday Night Live this past May. This is bullshit; Tyler may have copped some of Jagger\u2019s stage moves and outfits in the early days of Aerosmith, but he sounds nothing like him, in fact he sometimes sounds better (it\u2019s difficult to imagine Jagger pulling off the vocal theatrics at the end of \u201cDream On\u201d). Over the course of Aerosmith\u2019s classic six-album run of the 1970s, Tyler handles everything \u2013 scummy slice-of-life recitals, big choruses, ethereal harmonies (check out the bridge on \u201cUncle Salty\u201d) \u2013 with aplomb. He can spit out verbose verbal passages without breaking a sweat; there\u2019s a reason Run-D.M.C. was able to just rap his verses on \u201cWalk This Way.\u201d When Tyler lost his Toxic Twin, guitarist Joe Perry, for five years in the early \u201880s, he was able to keep Aerosmith going without him. But when Tyler left Aerosmith in late 2009 and the band considered continuing without him (even going so far as to audition other singers), it was difficult to imagine how this could possibly work. Tyler was back in the band within four months, demonstrating how essential he is to its identity.\n\n15. Iggy Stooge\n\nBand: The Stooges True, he wasn\u2019t a frontman for long; the Stooges were the Stooges for just two albums before Iggy took over, rechristening the band Iggy and the Stooges for its third and final outing and then launching a long solo career later in the decade. But in the late 1960s and early \u201870s, the Stooges were one of the greatest bands around and Iggy its perfect frontman, stripping away all of the pompousness that had infiltrated (and would continue to infiltrate) rock at that time and replacing it with a primitive language that pointedly restored all of rock\u2019s strengths. Iggy didn\u2019t have the greatest voice in the world, but over a steadily grooving rhythm section and a lot of wah guitar he sounded terrific, singing deceptively simple songs about girls, partying, degradation, boredom, sex and death with refreshing sincerity. Iggy was capable of holding listeners\u2019 attention even without lyrics; some of the most memorable passages of Stooges albums just see him grunting and howling. And despite how it may have seemed, this wasn\u2019t music that was arrived at casually; in the studio, the Stooges labored over songs until they were note perfect, requiring Iggy to sing with his trademark conviction again and again and again (disbelievers should head to The Complete Fun House Sessions for 28 takes of \u201cLoose\u201d). Iggy enjoyed considerable success on his own but it\u2019s fortunate the Stooges have earned some reunion tours so modern audiences can see him in his native habitat.\n\n14. David Yow\n\nBand: The Jesus Lizard The Jesus Lizard\u2019s 2009 reunion tour took audiences back to its 1990s heyday via more than just music; at the band\u2019s performances in clubs and at outdoor music festivals, there was considerable moshing. But in the middle of all the chaos you\u2019d see a funny thing; most of the rapidly aging hipsters slamming into each other were also singing along with every word. Such is the nature of David Yow\u2019s work; it may seem like he\u2019s just rambling and shouting rants, but his vocals and lyrics eventually get buried deep in your brain (this can prove disconcerting; after seeing or listening to the Jesus Lizard, you may find yourself thinking \u201cI CAN\u2019T SWIM! I CAN\u2019T SWIM!\u201d for days on end). He spaces out the insanity when the band is rumbling along at a slow tempo and when it starts to work up a head of steam he rides it sure-footedly, raging right along with it. He never sounds out of breath or control; more like he\u2019s marshalling one of the sharpest, most terrifying bands in existence. He may gain more attention for onstage antics like taking his clothes off and wrapping his penis around the microphone stand (a move called the \u201ctight and shiny\u201d) but Yow is actually one of the finest frontman the \u201890s spit out.\n\n13. Rod Stewart\n\nBand: The Kinks, The Jeff Beck Group, The Faces Hypothetically, you could move Rod Stewart in as frontman for almost any other similar English band of the late 1960s and early 1970s \u2013 the Rolling Stones, the Who, Led Zeppelin, etc. \u2013 and the results, while varying wildly artistically, would be the same commercially. He\u2019s just that good; the quintessential lead singer. He started off in an early version of the Kinks before eventually hooking up with Jeff Beck, freshly sacked by the Yardbirds, to front the imaginatively named Jeff Beck Group. Once this fell apart (Beck and Stewart\u2019s egos proved too big for one band), Stewart snapped up guitarist Ronnie Wood to form the Faces with musicians culled from another freshly disintegrated band; the Small Faces. It was here that Stewart came into his own as a lead singer, fronting the famously disheveled Faces for four albums, his vocals always a nuanced mix of grit and gravitas. Stewart sounds at once fabulous and entirely relatable; he always projects a sense of fraternity. As such, it\u2019s no surprise that the other Faces played on his first four solo albums, recorded concurrent to its existence, creating a shadow history of the band that got Stewart\u2019s solo career off on firm footing.\n\n12. Eric Burdon\n\nBand: The Animals In the 1960s, England produced every imitation of American blues imaginable, but only one man nailed the role of blues shouter, a singer so loud he could be heard over a band without a mic: Eric Burdon. He hit notes, sure, at times even crooned them, but over the course of the Animals\u2019 five albums, his work is typified by singing with equal parts soul and sheer force. His take on \u201cThe House Of The Rising Sun\u201d is so full-throated and wrenching it makes Bob Dylan\u2019s earlier version seem like a mere real estate listing. When the Animals became Eric Burdon and the Animals from 1967 on, Burdon led an entirely new band into the depths of psychedelia. The effects of his continual abuse of LSD are evident, but the voice remains, now expressing the thoughts and feelings of a man slowly losing his grip on reality. The results are fascinating, at times even more harrowing than Syd Barrett at the end of his rope. Burdon pulled it back together for three albums as frontman for the awesome L.A. funk band War before disappearing. In 2000, Burdon told Mojo magazine, \u201cEvery time I get into a London taxi, it\u2019s like, you get in, slam the door, he adjusts the mirror and the next line out of his mouth is, \u2018Fuck me, I thought you were dead!\u2019\u201d\n\n11. Eddie Vedder\n\nBand: Pearl Jam The angry and powerful baritone growls from Eddie Vedder were perfect for the punk-inspired sound of the early 90s grunge movement which was a stark contrast to the overblown and dramatic sound of late 80s mainstream rock music. He brought a raw energy and sense of recklessness to their early live shows often interacting with the crowd (mainly through stage diving and crowd surfing). Their loyal fan base still come out in support of the band\u2019s shows, despite the band\u2019s beef with Ticketmaster. Eddie Vedder is an accomplished songwriter and musician, who tackled social and political issues within his lyrics. He has also collaborated with various other artists on different projects including producing and composing movie soundtracks. He is known to jam with many other bands and artists, most recently seen rocking out with Jay-Z at the Made in America show.\n\n10. Jim Morrison\n\nBand: The Doors As the lead singer of the Doors, Jim Morrison ascended to near deified status, a poet and mystic with a dangerous image and a voice that oozed sexuality, spirituality, and and rock excess. The Doors exploded in 1967, with singles \u201cBreak on Through\u201d (initially a flop), \u201cLight My Fire\u201d (which reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and sold over a million copies), and \u201cThe End\u201d (the Doors\u2019 stunning epic that would become synonymous with the ambiguity and violence of the Vietnam War, due in large part to Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s masterpiece Apocalypse Now). Morrison\u2019s remarkable charisma and striking stage presence made him one of rock\u2019s great pioneers, a writhing, possessed poet dominating the stage to the delight of listeners. A little controversy didn\u2019t hurt either: performing \u201cLight My Fire\u201d on The Ed Sullivan Show, Morrison was asked to change the lyric \u201cyou know we couldn\u2019t get much higher\u201d to \u201cyou know we couldn\u2019t get much better.\u201d Initially agreeing, the singer sang the original lyric during the performance, prompting an enraged Sullivan to cancel six more Doors performances on the show. When the show\u2019s producer told the Doors they would \u201cnever do the Ed Sullivan show again,\u201d legend has it Jim Morrison said: \u201cHey man. We just did the Sullivan Show.\u201d The anecdote humorously encapsulates a life as typified by devotion to the purity of art as the decadence of rock stardom. Morrison often found himself in trouble with the law (often for profanity and indecent exposure) during his all too brief career. At age 27, he died in Paris of a heroin overdose, a tragic seal solidifying his legendary image.\n\n9. Don Van Vliet\n\nBand: The Magic Band When he began his recording career fronting the Magic Band in the mid-1960s, Don Van Vliet aka Captain Beefheart initially presented himself as a bluesman, singing in a voice that called to mind the full-throated roar of Howlin\u2019 Wolf over edgy psych rock typical of the era. Soon, though, Van Vliet flipped this on its ass; he kept the blues element but began to explore more of his five-octave range and use the Magic Band\u2019s songs as vehicles for increasingly bizarre lyrics and spoken word passages. Beefheart couldn\u2019t write music or even really play an instrument, instead dictating his material to patient band members via recorded piano ramblings, whistling or even a looped recording of a bird chirping (one legend has him giving the Magic Band\u2019s members LSD in a field and climbing a tree to teach them songs by improvising on a saxophone). By all accounts he was a tyrannical, even abusive band leader, but if he gets faulted for running the Magic Band like an acid cult he must claim the bulk of the praise for what it accomplished. Over 12 albums released from 1967 to 1982, Captain Beefheart\u2019s work grows restlessly from garage rock nuggets through challenging, jagged music that skirted the edges of jazz to arty, modern rock that hinted at new wave. In 1982, Van Vliet retired to a comfortable career as an abstract expressionist painter before dying in 2010. He never returned to performing again, which is unfortunate, as one suspects he could have been one of the rare \u201860s and \u201870s rockers able to transition through later decades still able to make good music.\n\n8. Black Francis\n\nBand: The Pixies Black Francis\u2019 singing is just fine, but it\u2019s his bone-chilling, primal scream that gave him an edge sharp enough to cut through the noise on the Pixies\u2019 excellent 1988 and 1989 albums Surfer Rosa and Doolittle. He may not have had the off-stage charisma, spotlight, and timing to become an icon of the generation, but he inspired some who did. Kurt Cobain cited the Pixies as a major influence, and without Francis\u2019 over-the-top but perfectly executed yells, shrieks, and screams, that next wave of alternative rock in the \u201990s wouldn\u2019t have been quite the same.\n\n7. Debbie Harry\n\nBand: Blondie There aren\u2019t a lot of high-profile examples of female singers fronting all-male bands in rock history. Janis Joplin held down Big Brother and the Holding Company for just a couple albums before splitting for an obvious solo career, while Grace Slick was only one of the lead singers in Jefferson Airplane. But Debbie Harry was not fucking around; it\u2019s not surprising that it took the punk/new wave era to find a true female lead singer. Check out the cover of Blondie\u2019s landmark Parallel Lines; the five male members of the band goof around in suits and ties in the background while Harry stands in front of them looking fierce in a white dress, clenched fists on her hips, staring straight into the camera with a serious look on her face, daring anyone to question her authority. Vocally, Harry expressed a lot within a limited range; making beautiful and bored sound almost transcendental (Madonna surely took note). In particular, Harry excelled at stepping through the genre-blend of Blondie; going from punk to pop to jazz to disco, even flirting with world music and hip-hop. Her long, loose rap on \u201cRapture\u201d proved an unlikely landmark; the contemporary documentary Style Wars observed that the earliest graffiti artists were obsessed with her.\n\n6. Chris Cornell\n\nBand: Soundgarden The so-called alternative era of the early \u201890s produced no frontman as perfect as Soundgarden\u2019s Chris Cornell. With his giant voice and massive stage presence, he was everything every legendary lead singer who had preceded him embodied in one package. His early work with the band in the late 1980s can be described as somewhat-base hard rock yelps, shouts and screams, but by the time of the band\u2019s massive-selling three-album run of the \u201890s, Cornell had honed all this down to a voice that veered from a mature tenor to a full-throated roar, sometimes simultaneously (check out how he layers the chorus of \u201cBlack Hole Sun\u201d by screaming it back at himself). Lyrically, meanwhile, Cornell was one of the most thoughtful men to ever bound around a stage with long hair and no shirt on, rushing headlong at topics like the futility of existence, abject depression, murder, suicide, messianic behavior, etc. And the very first time Cornell ventured out by himself with the one-off track \u201cSeasons\u201d on the soundtrack to the 1992 film Singles, he accidentally arrived at perhaps the best solo acoustic song of the decade.\n\n5. Bon Scott\n\nBand: AC/DC Over seven albums released in just four years, AC/DC\u2019s original frontman Bon Scott proved himself as one of the dirtiest frontmen in rock, leading the band\u2019s churning guitar duo and thudding rhythm section through an unrelenting run of party anthems and odes to the band\u2019s hard lifestyle, all with a fair amount of good humor (while the other members of the band sneer at the camera on the cover of Highway To Hell, Scott characteristically stands off to the side laughing). Unlike most lead singers hailing from the U.K. during the same era, who did everything they could to sound American, Scott sang with at least a hint of his accent (he was born in Scotland and raised in Australia), lending his vocals further authenticity. He also demonstrates impressive range; AC/DC never bothered with ballads, instead opting for an air of menace when it needed to slow down the tempo (\u201cWhat\u2019s Next To The Moon\u201d is a prime example), and Scott sounds perfectly at home with both those songs and the more high-energy stuff. Scott\u2019s life was tragically cut short \u2013 he died of alcohol poisoning in February 1980; just 33 years old \u2013 but his legacy looms large over the band. His replacement Brian Johnson has served AC/DC well for 35 years now, but it seems clear he was hired because he sings so much like Scott.\n\n4. Kurt Cobain\n\nBand: Nirvana It\u2019s not like there would have ever been a different lead singer of Nirvana; Kurt Cobain wrote almost all the band\u2019s songs and beyond that carefully chose covers perfect for his range and temperament. But the depth of what he accomplished is staggering; he started a band, planted himself in front of it and over three proper albums \u2013 just 35 tracks total \u2013 changed the landscape of modern rock. Lyrically, Cobain painted a vivid picture of what it was like to be a miserable teenager in the \u201880s (\u201cAbout a Girl,\u201d \u201cSchool\u201d), then a fledgling musician in his 20s (\u201cIn Bloom,\u201d \u201cLounge Act\u201d) and then suddenly, uncomfortably, a rock star wondering what happened (\u201cServe the Servants,\u201d \u201cRadio Friendly Unit Shifter\u201d). In between all that, he sang about abuse, alienation, murder, homelessness and the complexities of human emotion. His voice itself sounded punished: Cobain was known for his anguished scream, but he was also capable of deep, ruminative vocals; measured melodies; harmonizing with Dave Grohl; basically whatever a song required. He was an accomplished guitarist but more importantly he knew how to best serve his songs there as well; check out how his solo on \u201cCome As You Are\u201d just repeats the line he\u2019s been singing the whole time \u2013 his standard move (either that or just strangle his guitar and make a lot of noise). And for all the attention paid to his dark side (which, in fairness, his suicide certainly underlined), he had a good sense of humor. See Nirvana\u2019s 1991 appearance on Top Of The Pops, on which Cobain, forced to perform \u201cSmells Like Teen Spirit\u201d yet again, sings the entire thing in a handsome croon that surely had the show\u2019s producers tearing their hair out.\n\n20 THINGS YOU DIDN\u2019T KNOW ABOUT KURT COBAIN\n\n3. Robert Plant\n\nBand: Led Zeppelin According to the 1985 book Hammer of the Gods: The Led Zeppelin Saga, the band\u2019s guitarist Jimmy Page and manager Peter Grant considered replacing lead singer Robert Plant in the initial years of the band\u2019s existence. Oh, what a difference a half-century makes; the band wanted to reform for a tour following a 2007 reunion concert but Plant refused and the entire idea was scrapped. Over the course of eight albums, Plant\u2019s vocals were as integral a part of the band\u2019s sonic identity as Page\u2019s stellar guitar work; whether Zeppelin was playing epic blues covers, massive rock anthems or beautiful acoustic ballads, he sang it all note-perfect. Sure, he got a little annoying in concert \u2013 moaning, mocking orgasms, scat-singing and inserting ad-libs into the lyrics (like asking \u201cdoesn\u2019t anyone remember laughter?\u201d during \u201cStairway To Heaven\u201d) \u2013 but audiences of the era didn\u2019t care; instead they were magnetized by Plant\u2019s long golden locks and stuffed tight jeans. Furthermore, John Bonham is considered perhaps the most important element of Led Zeppelin and it was Plant who placed him there, recommending the then-unknown drummer to Page as the band formed.\n\n2. Freddie Mercury\n\nBand: Queen Much is made of Freddie Mercury\u2019s prowess as a live performer and visual icon; the image of him stalking the stage during Queen\u2019s legendary, short set at Live Aid in 1985 comes to mind \u2013 this is frequently cited as one of the greatest live performances ever. But listening to Queen\u2019s early albums, what you\u2019re struck by is how musical Mercury was; he harmonizes with and weaves in and out of Brian May\u2019s fluid, melodic guitar playing. No one else in Queen really needed to sing; in the studio at least, the band was armed with a chorus of Freddies as he layered his vocals over multiple tracks \u2013 standard practice for a lot of singers, but no one did it better. Lyrically, Queen mined territory similar to other contemporary English bands; mythologizing its homeland and mixing in plenty of odes to sex and fun. As the \u201870s proceeded, the band tended toward theatricality, making use of its instrumental prowess and, in particular, Mercury\u2019s dynamic range to create operatic masterpieces; \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d served as a landmark here. As the \u201880s dawned, Queen even scored a country hit with \u201cCrazy Little Thing Called Love,\u201d which Mercury boasted to Melody Maker that he wrote in under 10 minutes. Mercury\u2019s life was tragically cut short \u2013 he died of AIDS in 1991 \u2013 but the world never let go; over 20 years later, the Queen still reigns.\n\n1. Mick Jagger\n\nBand: The Rolling Stones The Beatles and the Rolling Stones are endlessly compared to one another in mostly idiotic debates that miss a huge difference between the two bands; all four members of the Beatles sang, whereas in the Rolling Stones, vocal duties fell squarely on one man, Mick Jagger. Sure, from 1969 on, Keith Richards sang a song per album, but it was up to Jagger to master all manner of blues, soul and R&B covers in the earliest days of the band and then proceed to convincingly pull off psychedelia, country, hard rock, reggae, punk, disco \u2013 basically any genre the Stones have experimented with in their 50-year evolution as a band \u2013 without even possessing a particularly strong voice. Jagger consistently executes anything the Stones attempt and does it with a mix of charisma and conviction such that he\u2019s become a mystical figure over the years \u2013 the biggest complaint about him is that he\u2019s largely unknowable beyond being really into sex and money (perhaps that\u2019s all we really need to know). Despite this, Jagger is a brilliant subject in interviews; a studied contrast to his partner Richards\u2019 smoker\u2019s lung chuckling and rambling drunken stories, he\u2019s always affable, intelligent and articulate \u2013 you can tell he went to the London School of Economics. All in all, he\u2019s a perfect focal point for one of the best, most fascinating bands in rock history.\n\nRelated: The Best Songs of 2014 (So Far)Related: The Best Albums of 2014 (So Far)"}, {"url": "https://www.famousdetails.com/dan-hawkins/", "page_content": "Dan Hawkins (Guitarist) was born on the 12th of December, 1976.

Here\u2019s what we found.\n\nTop 10 Most Skilled Guitarists\n\n1. Eddie Van Halen\n\nEddie Van Halen is the guitarist, keyboardist, and main songwriter of the band Van Halen.\n\nEddie was accustomed to playing his guitar without the support of a bass guitarist. Because of this, he developed a one-of-a-kind technique that involves placing the guitar pick between his middle fingers.\n\nThis allowed him to gain a wider picking range, hitting multiple strings at once.\n\nAdditionally, he also lets his wrist \u201cfloat\u201d over the bridge, and with every downstroke, he hits an average of two to three notes with each string by using hammer-ons, pull-offs, open strings, and other picking techniques.\n\nTo sum it up, Eddie has a wider picking range, hits multiple strings with every downstroke, plays multiple notes with every string.\n\nCombine all of that with his unbelievably fast picking and fretting fingers, and you get one of the most skillful guitarists to ever walk this earth.\n\n2. Stevie Ray Vaughan\n\nUnfortunately, this next guitar legend died at the young age of 35 years old.\n\nNonetheless, he was still able to garner multiple awards and nominations.\n\nThis includes six Grammys, ten Austin Music Awards, five W.C. Handy Awards, a double-platinum album Texas Flood, and an induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nWhat helped SVR achieve stardom was his versatility in playing the guitar.\n\nHe had the ability to play subtly, slowly, loudly, or aggressively. He also played country, rock and roll, blues, jazz, and sometimes a mixture of all of them.\n\nWhen you see him play, it\u2019s like the guitar is a part of him.\n\nThere was even a time when he played live, broke a string, kept playing, adlibbed the rest of his guitar solo, waited for the pause, and switched guitars without missing a beat.\n\n3. B.B. King\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to answer who the greatest guitarist of all time is, but if you were to ask us who\u2019s the greatest blues guitarist, there\u2019s one name that always comes to mind; B.B. King.\n\nHe is perhaps one of the most expressive guitarists out there, aside from also being an exceptional singer and songwriter.\n\nHis intricate riffs combined with breathtaking vibratos seem like, pardon the lack of a better term, he\u2019s making love to the guitar.\n\nHe also stood out among the other blues players because of his note choices.\n\nMost blues guitarists use the pentatonic scale as passing notes. However, B.B. King uses the notes on the pentatonic scale as if they were part of the main act. This really catches the attention of the listeners as his guitar, Lucille, cries out every note. Thus, earning him the title \u201cKing of Blues.\u201d\n\n4. Tom Morello\n\nBefore modern guitarists started using a dozen pedals for their effects, Tom Morello was already there, doing anything and everything possible to his guitar.\n\nIf you\u2019re not aware, Morello is the lead guitarist and co-founder of Rage Against the Machine, which then switched to Audioslave after the former\u2019s disbandment.\n\nMorello didn\u2019t use a dozen effects pedals.\n\nInstead, he used simple tools and techniques like scratching the strings with his palm, switching the toggle between treble and bass, and a lot more.\n\nThis allows him to make crunchy, heavy sounds while also making his guitar seem like a DJ\u2019s turntable.\n\n5. Slash\n\nSlash is a really charismatic and flashy guitarist at times, which sometimes takes the spotlight off of his skills.\n\nThen again, you didn\u2019t think Guns N\u2019 Roses would reach the popularity they have today if it\u2019s all about appearances, right?\n\nHis timing, combined with his tone, vibrato, and phrasing skills, make it look like playing the guitar should be effortless.\n\nAdditionally, Slash seems to have mastered the exact time of when he should play the instrument and when he shouldn\u2019t. That\u2019s what made him an integral part of the band.\n\nIn fact, when Slash left Guns N\u2019 Roses in 1996, the band started to deteriorate in terms of musical quality.\n\n6. Eric Clapton\n\nWe\u2019re here to tell you that being skillful in the guitar is not always about speed.\n\nEric Clapton is proof of that.\n\nBelieve it or not, Clapton was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame three times! It was once as a member of Cream, once as a member of The Yardbirds, and once as a solo artist.\n\nHe\u2019s a prolific singer and songwriter and has exemplary skills in playing blues vibratos with perfect form and phrasing. He can play multiple genres, and he also has a good command of both the acoustic and the electric guitar.\n\nIn fact, he\u2019s so good at what he does that The Rolling Stones and The Beatles considered him to be part of their respective bands.\n\n7. Tommy Emmanuel\n\nWhen we talk about the most skillful guitarists of all time, we shouldn\u2019t focus merely on electric guitarists.\n\nMoving over to the acoustic department, we have Tommy Emmanuel, arguably the best acoustic guitarist alive today.\n\nHe started playing the acoustic guitar at an early age of four, and from then on, he developed his skills by playing numerous songs from different genres.\n\nHe\u2019s very famous for his fingerpicking skills, and he can make the acoustic guitar sound like a whole orchestra.\n\n8. Keith Richards\n\nWhen we talk about guitar skills, we almost always assume that it\u2019s about fast fretting and picking, making loud and heavy noises.\n\nHowever, \u201cguitar skills\u201d is an extremely broad topic. With that, let\u2019s talk about Keith Richards, the rhythm guitarist of The Rolling Stones.\n\nWhat makes Richards a skillful guitarist is his way of composing riffs.\n\nDespite the riffs and note progressions of The Stones\u2019 songs being relatively easy, Richards knows how to cement them into people\u2019s hearts and minds.\n\nHis compositions are so unique that they make the band stand out. Nonetheless, he is also just as skillful in actually playing the guitar.\n\nOn top of that, he can even make it look so easy.\n\nHe\u2019s one of the few guitarists to receive the \u201cLiving Legend Award\u201d from the ABC network.\n\nAdditionally, Keith Richards is also considered one of the pioneers of the alternative rock genre. It\u2019s just that Richards has a way of expressing deep, dark, and enchanting emotions with his guitar.\n\n9. Jimmy Page\n\nHe may not be the greatest guitar player of all time, but we\u2019re certain that Jimmy Page is the 1970s\u2019 greatest rock guitarist.\n\nSome guitarists gain fame because of their overbearing skills that sometimes overshadow the band\u2019s character.\n\nHowever, Page can fling his guitar solos to the sky while still being grounded in the band\u2019s songs.\n\nIf you listen to \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d by Led Zeppelin, you\u2019ll know what we mean. His guitar-playing skills do not devour the band\u2019s sound, but without them, the sound is incomplete.\n\nHis most famous technique is palm muting the sixth string between multiple notes. His alternate picking is also just as exceptional.\n\nLastly, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, which is more than enough reason to include him on this list.\n\n10. Jimi Hendrix\n\nLastly, we have someone who a lot of people will argue is the best guitarist of all time. Of course, that\u2019s difficult to prove.\n\nHowever, simply hearing his name and instantly recognizing him is proof of this guitarist\u2019s amazing feat.\n\nWe\u2019re talking about none other than Jimi Hendrix.\n\nHendrix died at the age of 27, but his legacy will probably live forever.\n\nThis left-handed guitarist defied the traditional laws of guitar-playing.\n\nHe played lefty on a right-hand guitar by inverting the strings, and he popularized some of the most unusual guitar tricks ever, like playing behind the head or playing with teeth.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not purely what made him famous. It\u2019s his distortion effects, wah-wah pedal, and unconventional choice of notes and progressions that propelled him to the top of the music industry.\n\nIn fact, there\u2019s not a list of \u201cgreatest guitarists\u201d out there that you wouldn\u2019t find Jimi Hendrix.\n\nIf that\u2019s not proof enough, the fact that Lenny Kravitz, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Slash, Red Hot Chili Peppers\u2019 John Frusciante, and a thousand more popular guitarists look up to him is a testament to his legacy.\n\nConclusion\n\nA list of ten is obviously not enough to talk about the world\u2019s most skillful guitarists of all time.\n\nThere are dozens more that we failed to mention here.\n\nHowever, we believe that these people are the ones that really made it to the top.\n\nWho knows? Maybe we\u2019ll see your favorite guitarist on our next list!\n\nLet us know who you think should also be on this list!"}, {"url": "https://www.openculture.com/2018/08/steely-dan-went-seven-guitarists-dozens-hours-tape-get-perfect-guitar-solo-peg.html", "page_content": "It\u2019s easy to call the music of Steely Dan cynical ersatz: slick, clinical jazz-rock, with nary a hair out of place on any of their nine studio albums; soulless soul music beloved by pretentious jerks like the duo in Nick Kroll and John Mulaney\u2019s satirical Broadway show Oh, Hello, a comic play featuring two sleazy 70-something Upper West Side bachelors\u2014failed artists, casual racists, longtime beneficiaries of a rent-controlled apartment, and the two biggest Steely Dan fans you\u2019ll ever meet. But theirs is a purely affectionate homage.\n\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been any good music since Steely Dan,\u201d Mulany half-joked in a recent interview. \u201cThe best music is precise rock-pop-jazz in a studio, on a multitrack.\u201d Every take that calls Steely Dan calculating hipster pretenders and studio perfectionists isn\u2019t wrong, exactly, it\u2019s only that the band already anticipated and surpassed it by couching knowing inauthenticity and subversion in the most finely-crafted pop ever created. It\u2019s hardly an exaggeration to say that nothing in popular music has lived up to their masterpiece, Aja, so arch and shiny that it\u2019s \u201calso kind of punk,\u201d argues Variety\u2019s Chris Morris.\n\nGuitarist Walter Becker, \u201cthe Larry David of Steely Dan,\u201d approached everything with irreverence except the music, writes L.A. Times pop critic Mikael Wood. The same could be said of his bandmate, singer and keyboard player Donald Fagen. If you think you don\u2019t know Steely Dan, you do, from the hundreds of songs that have sampled and copied them, most nicking beats and hooks from Aja. One of those most-sampled songs, \u201cPeg,\u201d also serves as a mini-lesson on the duo\u2019s exacting work ethic and meticulous compositional methods. (See Fagen explain and demonstrate the song\u2019s complex chord voicings above.)\n\nIn a commemoration of Aja\u2019s fortieth anniversary last year, Newseek\u2019s Zach Schonfeld described Becker and Fagen\u2019s \u201codd, neurotic approach\u201d to recording \u201cthat turned the creative pair into musical auteurs of sorts, but made finishing a record nearly impossible.\u201d As you\u2019ll hear musicians like drummer Rick Marotta explain in the \u201cPeg\u201d making-of video at the top, the duo would bring in a crew of top-notch players for a session, then scrap every performance and bring an entirely new band in the next day, unhappy with virtually every take. \u201cEvery track, every overdub,\u201d says engineer Elliot Scheiner, \u201chad to be the perfect overdub. They didn\u2019t settle for anything. They were always looking for the perfect.\u201d\n\nThe almost unlimited power granted them by \u201cguaranteed sales\u201d may have been a \u201clicense for abuse,\u201d as \u201cPeg\u201d rhythm guitarist Steve Kahn tells Schonfield, but it also meant they never had to grudgingly settle for \u201cgood enough.\u201d They acted as curators for the best musicians in the business, figuring out whose distinctive style best fit which song, a process that involved a lot of trial and error. The approach is most evident in the legendary story of \u201cPeg\u201d\u2019s guitar solo, performed on the record by session player Jay Graydon, who made the cut after seven previous guitarists, including Robben Ford and Becker himself recorded hours and hours of tape.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that each of us walked away feeling really good about it,\u201d remembers guitarist Elliot Randall, who had played the solo on \u201cReelin\u2019 in the Years.\u201d But each time, Fagen and Becker knew it wasn\u2019t right. \u201cWe felt silly spending all this money for this one brief blues solo,\u201d Fagen says. When they finally recruited Graydon, he was ecstatic, as he relates in the interview above. \u201cEvery studio guitar player wanted to be on a Steely Dan record,\u201d he says. Finally, it was a match:\n\nFor about an hour and a half, I\u2019m playing my hip, melodic kind of jazz style. Then Donald says to me, \u201cNaw, man. Try to play the blues.\u201d I\u2019m thinking, if I gotta play blues in this solo, I can\u2019t use a B-flat. Because B is in that chord. I can\u2019t use an F unless it\u2019s running through the chord\u2026 So I can make it be a believable seventh chord by using the seventh in part of the line. I play bluesy for a while. I get melodic for a while. I get bluesy again. Then I get melodic and bluesy.\n\nThe brief solo suits the song perfectly, though we might say the same if they\u2019d chosen one of hundreds of other takes. We\u2019ll never know, though we do hear a few failed contenders at the top, and they\u2019re all clearly inferior. After four or five hours of playing, Graydon himself left the studio still not knowing if \u201cit was a keeper.\u201d Then he \u201cturned the radio on one day, and there it is.\u201d He\u2019s since relearned it several times to play for others, including a 2016 documentary about top session players and rock sidemen called Hired Gun.\n\nAs for all the Youtube videos floating around that claim to teach the solo (see one above), Graydon says none of them get it right. But luckily for him, somehow, he did, a lucky break, he says, that easily could have ended up in the bin with the other hundreds of hours of tape cut from the Aja sessions, victims of the ultimate jazz-funk-soul-rock auteurs.\n\nRelated Content:\n\nHow Steely Dan Wrote \u201cDeacon Blues,\u201d the Song Audiophiles Use to Test High-End Stereos\n\nSteely Dan Creates the Deadhead/Danfan Conversion Chart: A Witty Guide Explaining How You Can Go From Loving the Dead to Idolizing Steely Dan\n\nHow Good Are Your Headphones?
