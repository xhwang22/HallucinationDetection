His 113, in just 77 balls, included seven sixes which crashed into various festival tents, endangering ice creams and scorecards alike. His highest score also made easy pickings of a target of 238 and, after Pollock eventually fell going for another whopper, the captain Brett D\u2019Oliveira hurried his side over the line. \u201cAfter the last 10 weeks, where I haven\u2019t scored a bean, I was thinking: \u2018I\u2019ve got in, I\u2019m going to make this count,\u2019\u201d Pollock said. \u201cI owe the team a lot of runs, I had a lot of making up to do.\u201d A three-day victory also for Essex, who wrapped up the remaining four Gloucestershire wickets \u2013 Simon Harmer dusting his lapel with eight for 112, 13 for 156 in the match. The winless Gloucestershire could at least be buoyed by the performance of Zafar Gohar, who hit 81 from 75 balls to ensure Essex needed to bat again. High-scoring draws seemed inevitable at Scarborough, where Surrey\u2019s Rory Burns was finally out for 132, and Yorkshire\u2019s Dom Bess toiled away for five for 126; and Southport, where Keaton Jennings danced to 318 against Somerset, only the sixth Lancashire player to join the triple-century club. There were also centuries for Derbyshire\u2019s Brooke Guest and Leus du Plooy, the Leicestershire trio of Louis Kimber, Wiaan Mulder and Colin Ackermann and Glamorgan\u2019s Eddie Byrom and Sam Northeast.\n\nUpdated at 14.48 BST\n\n13 Jul 2022 16.59 BST Right, I\u2019m going to have to disappear to write up as I have to make a quick getaway today.

Cook\u2019s 73rd first-class hundred came up with a back-foot glide. His 145 made up nearly half of Essex\u2019s total, Zafar Gofar grabbing five for 84. Gloucestershire\u2019s second innings then sank into an inevitability vortex as Harmer, who had taken five wickets in the first innings at Chelmsford, picked up five more. Amar Virdi, on loan to Somerset, didn\u2019t find things as much to his liking as Lancashire\u2019s Luke Wells and Keaton Jennings got stuck into the spinners, putting on 164 at Southport. Wells had to chew his evening meal on 99 not out. There were no easy runs for England\u2019s out-of-sorts Zak Crawley, out dabbing to midwicket for five, but Kent got within a sniff of Northamptonshire thanks to three scores of 63. England\u2019s Alex Lees also fell for single figures in a topsy\u2011turvy Durham scorecard, where a wagging tail gave them a slim lead against Derbyshire. It was the Ed Barnard show again at Merchant Taylor\u2019s School as his unbeaten 69 gave Worcestershire a slim lead over Middlesex, who then built a credible second-innings total with bits and pieces. At Hove, Lewis Kimber and Rishi Patel helped Leicestershire to recover from losing Hassan Azad to the first ball of the innings, after Sussex flogged 589. Ian Holland rediscovered his form with 99 for Hampshire against Warwickshire, while Nottinghamshire suffered an unbecoming collapse against Glamorgan, losing six for 30 after Haseeb Hameed had made a fluent 70. Another former England opener, Rory Burns, finished unbeaten on 94 for Surrey after Adam Lyth and Jonny Tattersall notched up Yorkshire\u2019s first triple-century stand for the sixth wicket.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2021/sep/01/lancashire-v-warwickshire-hampshire-v-yorkshire-and-more-county-cricket-live", "page_content": "1 Sept 2021 17.37 BST Just popping back to say another new ball wicket has fallen at Old Trafford!

I am watching Lancs vs.\n\nWarwickshire out of the corner of my eye. Excellent stuff again from\n\nBohannon. But you notice how slow the scoring is. Therein lies the\n\ndifference between test players and those who never get the call,\n\nperhaps. The test level batsmen would tend to find a way to score at\n\nthis stage of the game. They wouldn\u2019t find the fielders as often. Is\n\nthat part of the reason why Bohannon, with a stack of runs this season,\n\nand a useful spare bowler, isn\u2019t in the picture for an England call-up?\n\nAnd as I write, Vilas at te other end hits 3 fours in an over. Lancs\n\nneed to get a move on because of bonus points and a very, very remote\n\nchance of a win.\u201d Thanks David. I reckon this is screwed on for a draw. The pitch is not helping the scoring rate, for anyone. And with that, Bohannon hits Yates for six to go to 98.

Notts biffed their way to 448, before slicing through the Somerset batting, starting with a wicket in the first over of the reply. Tom Abell, 35, was the only batsman to pass 12, as Somerset slithered to 87 for seven. Luke Fletcher finished with four for 21. James Vince top-scored for Hampshire, as Yorkshire totted up a first-innings lead of 80. Hampshire\u2019s 163 was a recovery of sorts after Ben Coad and Matthew Fisher had reduced them to 16 for three. It was a dry old day at Old Trafford as Warwickshire inched to 371 with the urgency of a milk float. In reply, Lancashire lost George Balderson for a duck, but Josh Bohannon and Luke Wells put on 94 for the first wicket. Bohannon, on a dapper 59, averages 61.8 in the Championship this season. A two-wicket evening burst from Joe Sarro put Sussex in the driving seat at New Road, leaving Worcestershire trailing by 78. Happy days for a young Sussex team with an average age of 19 and not a cap between them. Glamorgan continued their best impression of a line of cascading dominoes after collapsing for the second time in two days. At one point captain Chris Cooke looked around the wreckage of his second innings to find the score 29 for six. He and Andrew Salter had added 42 by the close, but Essex still lead by 115. At Bristol, Gloucestershire were relieved of their burden at 90 for six when bad light stopped play. There were three wickets each for Ben Sanderson and Luke Procter. The Northants captain, Adam Rossington, made 94, his highest score of the season.

As Mr Skinner remembers it, Meyer delivered an over of such balls during which the unfortunate batsman became confused by his unorthodox attack and stood away from his wicket in bafflement, only to see the ball land on top of his middle stump. 'Boss' Meyer, a renowned individual thinker who founded Millfield School, was said to have practiced bowling the high lob while headmaster at Millfield. He was dissuaded from making it his specialty in county cricket by the appearance of Godfrey Evans at the crease. Evans, who enjoyed a joke, swatted Meyer's next over all around the park using his bat one-handed like a tennis racket. So far as we know, this was the last time the high dropping full toss was deliberately used in county cricket. Michael Parkinson, 1999.\n\nIt is said that the late Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had once had the mortification of being dismissed in a similar fashion in a Second-Class match by Bunny Lucas. The freak dismissal is reported to have planted the germ of an idea in the fertile imagination of the prolific author that had resulted in the creation of the fictitious asthmatic schoolteacher with a weak heart named Tom Spedegue, who, despite his physical deficiencies, used to take an interest in cricket.\n\nCricketer himself, and an avid cricket blogger, Martin Moseling, having probed the veracity of the story quoted above from existing match records, finds it to be as much of a figment of Skinner s imagination as the fictitious bowling style of Spedegue, of the looping lobs that were said to land on the stumps of surprised batsmen. In the context of RJO Jack Meyer, however, it may be said to be very much in character for the engaging eccentric.\n\nThe Rev. (Horace) Rollo Meyer, Derbyshire cricketer, and a clergyman of the Church of England denomination, and his wife Arabella Crosbie, n e Ward, welcomed their middle son (out of three) on March 15, 1905 at the Rectory, Ampthill, a town and civil parish in Bedfordshire, between Bedford and Luton. Though the child had been formally christened Rollo John Oliver, he was known universally as Jack. In a treatise entitled The History of Millfield 1935-1970, Barry Hobson goes into considerable detail to depict the life and times of Jack Meyer.\n\nEight-year old Jack joined his elder brother at Stratheden School, Blackheath in 1913, before going on to Haileybury College on a scholarship in 1918. Founded in 1804, the seminary had originally been intended for the education of children of British employees of the East India Company, but was to later open its doors to the offspring of other families as well. The aim of the institution had traditionally been to prepare the students for a life of service , be it in the Church, or in the Armed forces, or in public administration. During his time at Haileybury, Meyer s natural gift and proficiency at almost all ball games was to make him one of the outstanding athletes of the immediate post- World War I era.\n\nMeyer matriculated and went up to Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1923, as a tall, wiry, tense, restless figure aged 18.This was a time when many freshmen at Cambridge and Oxford, particularly if they had happened to be good players, would be happy to just be awarded a Blue, and perhaps cater to their scholastic attainments by merely passing the Responsions, the first of three levels of examinations that needed to be passed successfully for a university degree.\n\nIn an article entitled Rollo Meyer: Visionary and Founder of Millfield School, PJ Lennon writes that, while at Cambridge, 18-year-old Meyer had struck up a firm friendship with Tom Lowry, later to captain New Zealand and to play the first 7 Tests played by his country. Meyer and Lowry founded the Hellfire Club at Cambridge. According to Richard H Thomas in All Out Cricket, the initiation ceremony that Meyer and Lowry had thought of consisted of the incumbent blowing three smoke rings and then spitting through the rings.\n\nMeyer was to himself admit later: In those days there were very few who were trying to get both Blues and degrees, and it was rather easy to get offers of jobs. By 1926 his profile boasted a cricket Blue in all three years and a Half-Blue for racquets, backed up by an Honours Degree in English Literature. At this pint of his life he began to think that he was now ready to make a living for himself. He began by driving a lorry during the Great Strike of 1926.\n\nCricket occupied a lion s share of his time during his tenure at Cambridge, Meyer winning his first Blue in his freshman year. He made his First-Class debut playing for Cambridge against Lancashire at Fenner s in 1924; he scored a duck but picked up 5 wickets in the match including 4 for 51 in the first innings. Between 1924 and 1926 he played 30 First-Class matches for his university, scoring 609 runs at 15.22, with a solitary fifty, and capturing 133 wickets at 23.66, with best figures of 7 for 24, against Leicestershire in his penultimate year.\n\nHis sporting prowess helped him to accept an offer from Harrow to help the master in charge of racquets. This provided Meyer the opportunity of playing Minor Cricket for Hertfordshire during the school holidays, and subsequently also playing 2 First-Class games for Minor Counties. His profile lists 29 Second-Class games for Hertfordshire between 1923 and 1929, during which he is seen to have scored 1,437 runs at 35.92 with 5 centuries, and 142 wickets at 18.52.\n\nMeyer gradually developed into a right-handed batsman, particularly renowned for his stylish straight- and on-driving. His bowling, however, was another matter altogether. In the words of David Foot: The daring variety of his bowling, during which he could summon up late swing and bamboozling medium-paced leg-breaks (often six different balls in an over), was inclined to look more of a lark. Meyer would often keep Somerset wicketkeeper Wally Luckes completely in the dark about what he was about to send down to the batsman, explaining that even at the point of delivering the ball, he would often not be sure himself of what he was about to bowl.\n\nAgainst the visiting South Africans at Lakenham in 1924, his bowling was good enough on behalf of the Minor Counties team to net him 6 for 60, his victims including George Hearne, Fred Susskind, Dave Nourse, Herbie Taylor, and Bob Catterall. He dismissed Catterall in the second innings as well. He also performed well with bat, scoring 26 and 30 in a game that the Minor Counties won by 25 runs.\n\nOn the lookout for a means of making a living after emerging from Cambridge in 1926, Meyer s Haileybury connections stood him in good stead, and he was prevailed upon, while he was at Harrow, to accept a situation in the cotton trade as a trainee broker, and shortly found himself on a steamer, bound for India. The young man arrived at erstwhile Bombay in due course.\n\nMeyer, the fresh Cambridge Cricket Blue, and perhaps yet to get over his youthful naivety, thus found himself in the midst of a critical politico-economic meltdown, a situation that he found difficult to adjust to. The ongoing Indian National Movement, which had received a setback with the demise of CR Das in 1925, was reignited with the appointing of the Simon Commission in 1927, there being no Indian member nominated in the seven-member panel. Several prominent Indian political leaders began to intensify the demand for the full independence of India. Things were to come to a head with the Salt March by Mahatma Gandhi on March 12, 1930.\n\nIn this bewildering maelstrom of political events, Meyer found solace in the familiar ambience of cricket fields, and required very little cajoling to join the ranks of the Europeans in the Bombay Quadrangular, in vogue at the time, in the absence of any formally structured regional First-Class cricket tournament in India at the time.\n\nMeyer was to play 6 matches for the Europeans between 1926-27 and 1934-35, scoring 304 runs at 25.33, with a highest of 85. His four fifties came in successive matches: 50 against Muslims in 1927-28, 66 against Parsees in 1928-29, 85 against Parsees in 1929-30, and 51 in his last game for the Europeans, against Hindus, in 1934-35.\n\nHis bowling on behalf of the Europeans brought him 50 wickets at 15.28, his best figures being 9 for 160, against Muslims at Bombay Gymkhana (later to stage the very first Test match of all on Indian soil), in 1927-28. Perhaps a little elaboration may be in order here, considering the importance of the game in the context of Meyer s First-Class cricket career.\n\nWhen skipper Mohammad Vishram won the toss for the Muslims and decided to take strike, he would probably not have imagined that the innings would be over in a mere 28.3 overs, with the total reading 59. The only man in double figures was Mohammad Hussain, brother of the SM Hadi. Hussain barely made it into double figures with a score of 10. Bowling unchanged from one end, Meyer accounted for 7 of the wickets at a personal cost of only 28.\n\nThe Europeans replied with 217, with William Cullen s 79 being the only individual fifty. That left the Muslims with a deficit of 158 when they began their innings on the second day. To their credit, they hey ended the day at 216 for 5, with Dilawar Hussain on 18 and Vishram on 8.\n\nThe fall of Hussain s wicket at 248 brought Abdus Salaam to the wicket. Salaam (111) was the next to go, at 435, but not before the seventh-wicket stand with the skipper had realised 187. The next three batsmen on the card were all dismissed for ducks, the valiant skipper remaining undefeated on 75. The innings folded up at 437, with Meyer capturing 9 for 160, his best First-Class figures. His 16 wickets in the game were achieved at a cost of 188.\n\nMeyer s match haul of 16 for 188 was the second-best individual performance with the ball for any First-Class game played in India at the time, after the 16 for 69 by Frank Tarrant for England against India at Bombay Gymkhana in 1915-16.\n\nIn the last innings of the game, the winning target for the Europeans was 280. Bolstered by 120 by Cullen and a fourth-wicket stand of 82 with Meyer (50), followed by a fifth-wicket stand of 80 with Gaillard (33*), the Europeans were able to win the game by 4 wickets.\n\nIn India, the young Meyer gradually came into contact with another section of the Indian populace, the so-called upper class, members of the princely and royal families, heads of the largely independent Princely States of India at the time, under the benign titular jurisdiction of the British Viceroy. This segment of the Indian population, however, was keen to follow British values and customs, and was anxious for their progeny to be educated in the best public schools and colleges of England, so that, in addition to a proper English education, they could be initiated into the various British sports that these upper class Indians found so appealing.\n\nMeyer s cricket connections in India brought him into contact with one such royal luminary at this time. Ranjitsinhji advised the young Meyer to opt out of his unrewarding and uninspiring job as a cotton broker, and to concentrate his energies on tutoring the young scions of the royal families in their quest for a holistic British education. In 1929, Ranji offered Meyer a teaching assignment at his own Princely State School, an offer that Meyer was quick to accept.\n\nThus it was, says Barry Hobson, that the man who had rejected offers of teaching posts at both Eton and Harrow in 1926, began his career in education three years later, first at Limbdi, then at Porbandar, and in 1932 as Headmaster of the Palace School at Dhrangadhra.\n\nThe move to Dhrangadhra in 1932 was prompted by the fact that by now, Meyer had already met Joyce, daughter of English parents, but brought up in considerable comfort in India surrounded by a plethora of servants and ayahs, and had been married to her in 1931, was in need of a more permanent situation. The Maharajah of Dhrangadhra had initially created the Palace School for the education of his own children and for the children of his Ministers and civil servants. In 1932, there were about a hundred students in the seminary.\n\nIn his later years, Meyer was to reminisce: I found myself teaching some twenty or so boys and girls with age range of twenty two down to three and an IQ range of eighty to one hundred and forty. Half of them knew no English and I knew no Gujarati. A method of graded small group tuition had to be devised to meet the situation. This was to form the basis of his teaching later at Millfield School.\n\nMeyer s alternative career, and one that was to earn him great fame and honour in his later years, was thus launched in a small princely state of India, under the colonial Eastern Kathiawar Agency, in what is now Saurashtra. The royal ruler of the state went under the honorific title of Maharaja Sri Raj Sahib, and was entitled to a salute of 13 guns.\n\nThese events in Meyer s life, though financially and altruistically rewarding for him, did not, in any way, divert his mind from cricket. When the Ranji Trophy first got underway in 1934-35, Meyer was to be found leading the Western India team against Sind in the second game of all in the history of the tournament.\n\nGhulam Mohammad won the toss for Sind at Karachi. Sind did not last long, the only man in double figures being Naoomal Jaoomal (63), just over half the team total of 125. Narsingrao Kesari captured 5 for 12, while skipper Meyer held 3 catches. Meyer (20) then added 47 for the first wicket with Faiz Ahmed (62). Western India responded with 219, Naoomal Jaoomal taking 5 for 78.\n\nUnder a handicap of 94 runs, the Sind second innings total was 210, Naoomal Jaoomal (53) scoring his second fifty of the match. Resuming at 81 for 5 on the final day, Western India won by 4 wickets; Meyer top-scored with 29.\n\nMeyer played his second (and last) Ranji Trophy match against Bombay at Bombay Gymkhana Ground. Winning the toss, Dattaram Hindlekar and Vijay Merchant added 141 for the second wicket, and Bombay amassed 377. Amar Singh (4 for 93) and Meyer (3 for 111) were the main wicket-takers.\n\nIt was a sorry procession as the Western India, wickets fell in a flurry. The only saving grace was 82 from Sorabji Colah in a very inadequate total of 154; Meyer contributed 1. Bombay were then bowled out for 164, captain LP Jai scoring 55. Brothers Amar Singh (6 for 71) and Ladha Ramji (4 for 29) shared the wickets.\n\nSet a target of 388, Western India were dismissed for 241, conceding a 146-run victory. Standing tall amongst the ruins of the innings, Meyer, opening the batting, scored 91, his highest individual First-Class score till date. Rather surprisingly opening the bowling, Merchant had figures of 4 for 31. This was to be the last First-Class match played by Meyer in India. Being a man proficient in many sports, Meyer was to become the Indian National Champion at racquets and billiards.\n\nBy 1935, Joyce and Jack had two young daughters, Jillian and Jaqueline. The Maharajah of Dhrangadhra was anxious that his three sons should be imbued with a proper British education and upbringing and urged Meyer to exert himself to prepare them for the better known English public schools and for subsequent admission to Oxford or Cambridge. Seizing the opportunity, Meyer decided to leave Indian shores behind after a nine-year sojourn, and to go back to the country of his birth.\n\nThe next phase of the life of Meyer takes us back in time to the year 1889, and to one William Stephens Clark, who had been the guiding light of the shoe-making firm of C and J Clark for the past 25 years. William chose to build the family mansion in Street, a large village and parish town of Somerset, in the year mentioned. Over time, Clark s estate, known as the Mill s Field estate, was to include a stable block, a well-laid-out kitchen garden, and a cottage for the gardener. It was to also include certain features not usually seen in Victorian mansions, like secret doors, staircases and passages. The estate also boasted a Swiss chalet, an open-air swimming pool, and a small boat-house.\n\nIn 1935, the Rev. Horace Rollo and Arabella Meyer rented the property, now known as Millfield, for residential purposes. They welcomed Joyce, Jack, their two granddaughters, and Jack s retinue of Indian students at the estate. Meyer s Indian wards, seven in number, included six princelings in 1935, the three sons of the Maharajah, three of their cousins, and the child of one commoner.\n\nThe school had a relatively humble beginning on June 6, 1935, primarily as an institution where, under the guidance of Meyer, the Indian boys were to cram for admission into British Public Schools. Joyce and Jack adopted the role of tutor-guardians and provided a home from home for the young Indian students throughout their time in England.\n\nDuring his stint at Dhrangadhra, apart from academics, Meyer had tried to inculcate interest in his students in such diverse activities as horse-riding, shooting, swimming, cricket, tennis, and gardening, as part of the British education philosophy of men sana in corporesano a healthy mind in a healthy body. A groom was engaged at Millfield to look after the horses, and a group of gardeners was employed to help the Indian students to continue their training in gardening. A fairly large number of domestic staff members were employed to cater to the personal needs of these youngsters of royal blood.\n\nThe eldest Prince of Dhrangadhra, who had been barely 12 when he had arrived in England in 1935, went on to succeed his father in 1942 as His Highness the Maharajah Sairaj Megharajji. He was to recall his experiences at Millfield at a later date as follows: The old school (in India) was co ed , from the start! However its distaff side was left behind when, in 1935, the School was translated overseas trans-shipped, in functioning order, with principal, preceptors, pupils and staff, 30 together with its peculiar proclivities (minus the horses!) and transplanted in England, to become and blossom, as the Millfield School!\n\nDespite the humble beginning, Millfield began to blossom, becoming one of the first independent schools to become co-educational in 1939. It is on record that Martin, son of the then Deputy Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, had joined Millfield in 1942 in the hope of being able to overcome his dyslexic status. By the time he had completed his university education, Millfield had gained the reputation of becoming the first educational institution in England to deal successfully with the issue of dyslexia among children.\n\nIn a message, Craig Considine, Headmaster of Millfield, has this to say about the present status of the school: The original aim was to introduce the boys, ages between 8 and 15 to the English education system and create a home from home . As it was summer when the six young princes arrived in Somerset, everyone set about preparing a cricket pitch. Eighty years later, sport, along with the arts, academic curriculum and co curriculum remains a significant feature of Millfield s excellent all round education. Today at Millfield we have come a long way from those rudimentary beginnings and enjoy outstanding sport facilities and we no longer expect pupils to construct a cricket pavilion or campus as part of their induction!\n\nIt was now 1936, and, with the onset of summer, it was time to bring the cricket creams out again.At the age of 31, Meyer found himself making his County Championship debut in 1936, when the season was already well underway, for Somerset against Northamptonshire at Bath. Considering that his school was running fairly smoothly by now, Meyer could indulge in cricket only during the school holidays.\n\nMeyer was fortunate to be making his debut for Somerset at this time, the team already having in its ranks players of the calibre of opener Frank Lee; swashbuckling Harold Gimblett, in his second First-Class season; Reggie Ingle, in his penultimate season as Somerset skipper; legendary all-rounder Arthur Wellard; and long-suffering wicketkeeper Wally Luckes, among others. Somerset won by 105 runs, Wellard contributing 70 in the first innings and capturing 6 for 54 and 6 for 69. Gimblett scored a scintillating 143 in the second innings, sharing a first-wicket stand of 114 with Lee (53). Meyer s contributions were 16 and 22, and 28 overs for no wicket.\n\nThis period was also, perhaps, the dawn of his legendary eccentricity. Foot cites an incident of Meyer of once holding up play in a championship match against Northamptonshire after he had dropped a catch offered by Dennis Brookes off Wellard, and then going up to the bowler with a 1 note in hand and profuse apologies for his lapse in the slips.\n\nThere is a story of a championship game being played in uncertain weather in which Somerset had taken field with ten men, Meyer following shortly carrying a red umbrella. He was known to roam the grounds of his school with his golf kit on hand and to occasionally practise driving the ball into his own living room through the open window. One wonders what Joyce would have thought of all this.\n\nHis inaugural season with Somerset was to prove quite profitable for him. He made his bones with Somerset in his second game of the season, a home match against a strong Yorkshire team led by Brian Sellers, although the visitors won the game quite convincingly by an innings and 152 runs. Meyer had figures of 5 for 111 in the first innings, and top-scored with 43 and 32 out of 116 and 94.\n\nIt was August 29, and the schoolmaster s mind was at rest with the holiday season upon him. The adversaries this time were Lancashire, who batted first and put up 423, Cyril Washbrook scoring 103 as Bill Andrews captured 6 for 126 for Somerset.\n\nSomerset replied with 253, Mandy Mitchell-Innes (127) contributing just over half the total. Following on, they were 122 for 5, still 48 in arrears. Meyer stood tall, first adding 90 for the sixth wicket with John Barnwell, then adding a further 72 runs with Wellard. When time ran out on the drawn game, Meyer was left undefeated on 202, scored in 225 minutes, his highest First-Class score.\n\nIn all, between 1936 and 1949, Meyer played 65 matches for Somerset, scoring 2,929 runs at 28.16, with 2 centuries. He also had 16 fifties, and held 33 catches. His 133 wickets for Somerset came at 28.31, and his best analysis of 7 for 74 came against Northamptonshire in 1947. He was captain of Somerset for 26 matches.\n\nMillfield, Meyer s brainchild, was something out of the ordinary with respect to its teaching principles. The aim of the school, according to Lennon, was to nurture talent by providing the very best facilities in teaching and coaching and to provide opportunities in which young people can exercise and explore their abilities; and to give awards to those in financial need.\n\nKnown affectionately and respectfully as the Boss at Millfield, Meyer followed the Robin Hood principle in which affluent families often subsidised the education of deserving children of less privileged families. Meyer s progressive and liberal attitude towards education resulted in the likes of Sean Connery, Elizabeth Taylor, Charlie Watts, King Hussain of Jordan, and Adnan Khashoggi to entrusting their offspring to his care.\n\nSeveral students of Millfield grew to become well-known sporting personalities, including Welsh rugby legend Gareth Edwards, and cricketers Ian Botham, Craig Kieswetter, Peter Denning, Simon Jones, Ben Hollioake, David Engrave, Lilly Allen, Oliver Reid, and Peter Roebuck.\n\nWriting in The Independent, Stephen Chalke had this to say about the first meeting between Roebuck and Meyer: Roebuck, one of six born to schoolteacher parents, caught the cricket bug as a young boy in Bath. He applied for a scholarship to Millfield, the sports-centred independent school run by the eccentric Jack Meyer, a former Somerset captain whose greeting to the 13-year-old entering his study was to throw an orange at him. Well caught, he said. But you should have thrown it back. Roebuck was in, so were both his parents as teachers, and they were given a house in nearby Street. Meyer, ever an unconventional thinker, appealed greatly to the youngster.\n\nRoebuck, himself a complex character forever fighting his own demons, and later to die by his own hand under tragic circumstances, called his mentor a gambler, golfer, chess player, scholar, scrounger and crossword-solver . Referring to his captaincy of Somerset in 1947, Roebuck was to later say, surprise was his weapon, experiment his fancy, dullness his enemy but inconsistency his weakness .\n\nAnother Somerset player who enjoyed a special relationship with Meyer was Gimblett, another man who was to go through troubled times himself. In Gimblett s own words: By the end of 1953 the world was closing in on me.\n\nFollowing Christmas of that year, Gimblett was on sleeping pills and had to spend 16 weeks in a psychiatric hospital. By 1954, when Gimblett had parted ways with Somerset, and had applied for a teaching job at Millfield, Meyer not only gave him the situation, but also took his son in as a pupil. Gimblett was to spend twenty years at Millfield. He used to say that Meyer could charm the hairs off a gooseberry. Despite best efforts, however, and despite using all his charm, Meyer was not able to reinstate Gimblett in the Somerset team.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II in 1939, many of the male members of the Millfield staff, led by Meyer himself, volunteered for military service. Meyer, 34 and already in the grip of lumbago, was sent back to his campus. He was later given a Royal Air Force Volunteer Service commission as a Flying Officer, later upgraded to Flight Lieutenant, and given the responsibility of organising and commanding the Glastonbury and Street Schools Squadron of the Air Training Corps as part of the British war effort.\n\nIn 1967, Queen Elizabeth II appointed Jack Meyer an OBE for services to education. A compulsive gambler, an unsubstantiated story says that his tenure at Millfield was to end rather abruptly in 1971 when he became involved in an imbroglio involving an all-night gambling session and a bag containing school fees.\n\nMeyer moved to the idyllic settings of Greece in 1973 to become the Headmaster of a school just outside Athens called St. Lawrence College, home to about 770 students between the ages of 3 and 19. Founded by Galinos Karakostas with the idea that the students would be brought along traditional British principles, the chemistry between the founder and Meyer turned out to be beneficial for the students."}, {"url": "https://www.sportsadda.com/cricket/features/highest-individual-score-first-class-cricket", "page_content": "Former West Indies cricketer Brian Lara holds the record for the highest individual score in first-class cricket.\n\nWhile playing for Warwickshire, Lara smashed an unbeaten 501 against Durham in a County Championship match at the Edgbaston Cricket Ground in Birmingham in 1994.\n\nInterestingly, it remains the only quintuple-hundred to be registered in First-Class cricket history.\n\nLara\u2019s record-breaking innings was laced with 62 fours and 10 sixes.

But slowly Essex\u2019s hopes of stealing a win grew with back-to-back 50 run partnerships.\n\nWalter converted his overnight 49 to a half-century with the fifth ball he\u2019d faced \u2013 a cut to the boundary to reach the milestone in 74 deliveries. He and Allison negotiated the second new ball on their way to a 58-run stand for the eighth wicket.\n\nWalter departed for a career-best 77 when the impressive Brydon Carse angled across and found an edge behind.\n\nAllison then moved to his maiden career fifty, from 144 balls, as he and Sam Cook continued to tick along.\n\nAfter an extended interval to pay respect to Prince Phillip, Carse ended Allison\u2019s resolve by striking him in front of middle stump four balls after the resumption before Cook edged behind for 37. Carse returning figures of five for 82.\n\nDay 2\n\nScott Borthwick and Brydon Carse took two wickets apiece for Durham to leave Essex facing a first home LV= Insurance County Championship defeat for almost three years.\n\nLeg spinner Borthwick, who had handed the visitors the advantage with a first-innings 100, claimed Ryan ten Doeschate and Adam Wheater in quick succession, after quick Carse had broken a 103-run stand between half-century maker Dan Lawrence and Tom Westley.\n\nEssex, who last lost at the Cloudfm County Ground, Chelmsford in June 2018, ended the day on 208 for six, with a slender lead of 45.\n\nEarlier, Stuart Poynter scored 52 not out, Matt Salisbury made his highest first-class score and Simon Harmer produced his 21st five-wicket haul for Essex as Durham boasted a 163 run first-innings lead.\n\nAfter 18 wickets had fallen on an eccentric first day, Essex would have expected to take the final two Durham wickets quickly.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t to happen as Poynter, Salisbury and Chris Rushworth batted throughout the morning session to score 111 runs, and take the lead to 163.\n\nPoynter and Salisbury had serenely sailed through the majority of the session with a club-record ninth-wicket partnership against Essex of 94.\n\nSalisbury, who started his career at Essex, had matched his more recognised partner as he passed his previous best first-class score of 37.\n\nBut on 41 he became Harmer\u2019s fifth scalp of the innings when he guided the ball straight to Ryan ten Doeschate at short leg.\n\nRushworth arrived to help guide Poynter to an eighth red-ball half-century, from 100 balls, before the number 11 unfurled three boundaries including a beautiful cover drive off Harmer.\n\nSam Cook rounded off the innings two and a half overs into the second new ball, as Rushworth edged to Alastair Cook at first slip \u2013 Sam Cook returning three for 57, while Harmer\u2019s final analysis was five for 79.\n\nEssex\u2019s nightmare first morning, where they slumped to 36 for five, looked in danger of being replicated when Nick Browne was bowled by Rushworth and Alastair Cook chipped to midwicket.\n\nBut from 19 for two, Lawrence and Westley recovered with a sublime 103-run stand to drag Essex back towards equality.\n\nLawrence, who made his Test debut over the winter, looked supreme scoring 12 boundaries in his 76 \u2013 his fifty coming up in 93 balls.\n\nWestley was more stoic in his scoring, working almost exclusively with his favourable legside before he wafted outside his off stump to nick Carse to first slip to spark a flurry of wickets.\n\nCarse then added Lawrence to his victims as he persuaded the batter to pick out Will Young on the deep midwicket boundary.\n\nEssex edged themselves into the lead four down lost ten Doeschate with lead on one \u2013Borthwick taking a stunning return catch from a low full toss, before the captain found Wheater\u2019s outside edge.\n\nDay 2: Stuart Poynter\n\nDay 1\n\nScott Borthwick collected his first century since returning to Durham after Essex were skittled out for under 100 at the Cloudfm County Ground, Chelmsford for the first time since 2014\n\nBorthwick returned to his home county this winter after four seasons at Surrey before scoring exactly 100 \u2013 his first hundred for the club since May 2016 \u2013 as Durham ended the day 144 for seven, with a 48 run lead.\n\nDefending Bob Willis Trophy and LV= Insurance County Championship champions Essex were skittled for 96 \u2013 with the 94 scored against Derbyshire in 2014 the last time they had been routed for under three figures.\n\nChris Rushworth and Brydon Carse both claimed three wickets, while former Essex paceman Matt Salisbury and Ben Raine also took two apiece.\n\nEssex had won the toss and elected to bat first, on pitch and in conditions not dissimilar to the one which saw 993 runs in a dull draw the week before, but they lost Nick Browne to the third ball of the match, as the opener chopped Rushworth on.\n\nTom Westley, on the back of a double century against Worcestershire last week, and Alastair Cook both departed in quick succession \u2013 the former caught behind while expansively driving at Salisbury and the latter lbw.\n\nThe hosts slumped to 36 for five as Carse claimed two wickets in an over when Paul Walter dragged on and Ryan ten Doeschate attempted to duck but periscoped the ball to third slip.\n\nCarse provided more heat as he struck Adam Wheater on the hip and shoulder, as the wicketkeeper and Dan Lawrence battled to put on 38.\n\nAfter lunch, Essex lost three wickets for two runs as the collapse returned, falling from 74 for five to 76 for eight.\n\nWheater tentatively prodded to second slip, Lawrence was bowled, and Simon Harmer rocked onto the back foot and edged to a stooping first slip.\n\nRushworth and Carse cleared up the tail with Ben Allison caught behind and Sam Cook bounced out.\n\nA similar wicket tumble was threatened by Durham when Alex Lees edged behind in the fourth over to hand Sam Cook his 100th first-class wicket for Essex, but Borthwick and Will Young raced past the home side\u2019s score in 27 overs.\n\nWhatever gremlins Essex had found evaded Borthwick has he stormed to a 64-ball half-century, brought up with a sweet sweep.\n\nHarmer struck in consecutive overs as Young turned around the corner to Lawrence at leg slip and David Bedingham skied to mid-off.\n\nJack Burnham and Ned Eckersley also departed, before Borthwick raised his bat on a popular 118-ball hundred \u2013 after back-to-back boundaries off Allison.\n\nBorthwick was bowled by a ball that barely bounced before Carse shouldered his arms at a sharp turner after Lawrence entered due to bad light.\n\nFive overs were lost for a delay for bad light but in a 2.4 over return, Raine edged Harmer to first slip \u2013 the spinner ending the day with figures of four for 41.\n\nDay 1 reaction: Scott Borthwick"}, {"url":

Fans around the country will always fondly remember him for his silken wristwork and ability to create magic out of nowhere with the willow in hand.\n\nOne of the greatest captains India has ever produced, the Hyderabadi was also a brilliant fielder who manned the point and cover regions. Azharuddin is the only player in Tests to have scored centuries in each of his first three Tests.,\n\nBy scoring his 22nd hundred in what turned out to be his final Test match, Azharuddin became the only Indian among five players overall to have scored hundreds in their first and last Tests.\n\n9.

His highest score was 252 not out came against Cambridge University when on a tour of England.\n\nOne of the greatest batsmen India has ever produced, Umrigar's exploits on the cricket ground during the late 1940s to the early 1960s earned him plentiful plaudits. He was also a more than decent bowler, as his 325 wickets at the first-class level would suggest.\n\nUmrigar, the first Indian player to score a Test match double century, was known for his commanding drives as well as for his ability to hook and pull fearlessly in an era where there were no helmets for protection.\n\n8. Dilip Vengsarkar (Bombay, India)\n\nDilip Vengsarkar\n\nOne of the foremost exponents of the drive, Dilip Vengsarkar, stands eighth in the list of all-time leading Indian run-scorers in first-class cricket.\n\nMaking his debut in 1975, the right-hander notched up 17868 runs in 260 first-class appearances at an average of 52, scoring 55 centuries and 87 half-centuries.\n\nIn Test cricket, Vengsarkar scored 6,868 runs at an average of 42.13 in 116 games, tallying 17 centuries and 35 half-centuries in the longest format of the game. In domestic competitions for Bombay, Vengsarkar lent solidity to the middle order.\n\nOne of Vengsarkar's final defiant innings in his first-class career came in an enthralling 1991 Ranji Trophy final. Chasing a 355-run target in 70 overs on the final day against Haryana, Vengsarkar's unbeaten 139 took Bombay to the precipice of an unlikely win before last man Abey Kuruvilla was run out three runs away from the finish line.\n\nHis century in the final earned the then 35-year-old Vengsarkar a spot in India's 1992 tour of Australia, where the right-hander scored a half-century in the first Test in Sydney before retiring.\n\nAfter his retirement, Vengsarkar was the chief selector of the Indian team for a while.\n\n7. GR Viswanath (Mysore, India)\n\nGR Viswanath\n\nGundappa Rangnath Vishwanath stands seventh in the list of India's all-time leading run-scorers in first-class cricket. He piled up 17,970 runs in first-class cricket at an average of 40.93 in 308 games,\n\nThe elegant batsman who turned up for Mysore (later called Karnataka), was renowned for his stylish square cuts. In 91 Tests, Viswanath scored 6,080 runs at an average of 41.93.

Hazare, along with his namesake Vijay Merchant, were two of India's premier batsmen of their era. Hazare, who passed away in 2004 in Vadodara, would be remembered for his exploits in India's first tour of Australia in 1947/48.\n\n5. Wasim Jaffer (Mumbai, Vidarbha, India)\n\nWasim Jaffer\n\nWasim Jaffer stands fifth in the list of India's all-time leading run-getters in first-class cricket.\n\nThe Mumbai stalwart is the all-time top-scorer in the Ranji Trophy.

With five Test centuries, Jaffer may consider himself a tad unfortunate for not featuring in more Tests for his country.\n\nThe Mumbaikar, who has won the most Ranji Trophy titles by any player, was Mumbai's captain when they won their 38th and 39th Ranji Trophy titles in the competition.\n\n4. VVS Laxman (Hyderabad, India)\n\nVVS Laxman\n\nVangipurappu Venkata Sai Laxman, a stylish batsman from Hyderabad, took a particular liking to Australia in international cricket. He stands fourth in the list of all-time leading run-scorers in first-class cricket in India.\n\nWith 19730 runs to his name, a tally that includes 55 centuries and 98 centuries, Laxman was a vital cog in the Hyderabad, South Zone and India teams. The right-hander, who has a top-score of 333 in first-class cricket, scored a record 1415 runs in the 1999-00 Ranji Trophy.\n\nLaxman had one of his most memorable moments when he scored a magnificent 281 against Australia in the 2001 Kolkata Test. Batting out the entire fourth day of that Test along with Dravid, India became only the third team to win a Test after following-on.\n\nWristy flicks and glances off the hips were a hallmark of Laxman's game. The Hyderabad player scored over 8700 runs in 134 Tests, scoring 17 centuries and 56 fifties in the longest format of the game.\n\n3.

Sachin Tendulkar (Mumbai, India)\n\nSachin Tendulkar\n\nSachin Tendulkar is a complete batsman of his generation and a man who 'was not just a cricketer, but an emotion,' according to noted commentator Harsha Bhogle.\n\nThe diminutive Mumbaikar comes second in the list of most first-class runs by an Indian player. Tendulkar scored 25396 first-class runs in 310 games at an average of 57.84, with 81 centuries and 116 half-centuries, in a career spanning almost a quarter-century. A record 15921 of these runs came in Test matches alone.\n\nTendulkar, who is also the all-time top-scorer in ODIs, was strong off the front foot, particularly his straight drives. The first player to score a double century in ODIs, Tendulkar, was also noted for his leg-glances.\n\nHis highest first-class score of 248 not out came against Bangladesh in the 2004 Test in Dhaka, a game India won by an innings and 140 runs.\n\n1.

Gavaskar's 10122 runs in Tests consist of 34 three-figure scores and 45 half-centuries.\n\nGavaskar is one of five players in Test history to have scored a fourth-innings double hundred, and is the only Indian among three players to hit hundreds in both innings of a Test match on three occasions.\n\nHis record is awe-inspiring as he primarily played in an era of uncovered pitches, and often played without a helmet.\n\nPoll : 0 votes"}, {"url": "https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/this-day-that-year-brian-lara-historic-501-highest-first-class-score-1686144-2020-06-06", "page_content": "By India Today Web Desk: On this day in history, legendary batsman Brian Lara broke another record when he notched up the highest first-class score in cricket history. His iconic 501 not out came just 2 months after his record-breaking triple in Test cricket.\n\nOn June 6 in 1994, Lara scored 501 not out for Warwickshire against Durham at Edgbaston.

In 48 Tests for the West Indies, he scored 2,160 runs at an average of 25.71 with three tons and nine fifties. Ganga is more remembered as a leader and his most memorable moment came during the Champions League Twenty20 in 2009 when he led Trinidad and Tobago to the final. An articulate speaker, he is now a commentator. Nishad Pai Vaidya looks back at Ganga\u2019s cricketing journey.\n\nA batsman with more grit and determination than the typical Caribbean flair, Daren Ganga was one interesting player during his days. The orthodox and copybook approach was often contrasting, as the man at the other end, Chris Gayle, fancied whacking every ball out of the ground. However, in the 48 Tests that he played, Ganga maintained his approach and did not fall prey to any temptations. It is surprising that he ended with an average of only 25.71 in Test cricket, but his sharp cricketing brain would mark him as one of the best leaders in recent times in Caribbean cricket.\n\nBorn in Barrackpore, Trinidad on January 14, 1979, Ganga grew up in an East Indian community. In an interview with ESPNcricinfo, he recalls watching Indian movies as a child and that was one way he connected to the origins of his ancestors. But, cricket was a passion and was a sport his whole family took to. Moving through the ranks at an early age, he played for South and Central Trinidad three days shy of his 17th birthday and scored 80. A few days later, he was in the Trinidad Under-19 squad.\n\n[inline-quotes]West Indies also witnessed a leader in Ganga. The fact that he had led West Indies A and a few age group sides had kept him in the reckoning and he had impressed with his tactical skills. [/inline-quotes]\n\nGanga made his First-Class debut against Guyana in the red Stripe Cup in 1996-97 and scored 17 and two on debut. He continued to play age group cricket through the year and was then a part of the West Indies Under-19 team alongside Gayle, Marlon Samuels, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Sylvester Joesph to name a few for the 1998 World Cup in South Africa. Consistent performances in age group cricket and a decent First-Class season that saw him score his maiden ton, as he also made it to the West Indies side for the tough tour to South Africa, before he turned 20.\n\nThe maiden sojourn to South Africa was forgettable for Ganga. In three Tests, he could only muster 75 runs and then his three One-Day Internationals (ODIs) also didn\u2019t yield too many runs. He toured New Zealand in late 1999 and then got an opportunity in Australia in 2000-01. On a tough tour for the West Indies, Ganga impressed with his patience and stoic technique. He didn\u2019t have too many big scores, but when he got starts, he did show some qualities of a good opener. The first fifty in Test cricket finally came against Zimbabwe in 2001 at Bulawayo. On the same tour to Zimbabwe, Ganga scored three fifties in the ODI tri-series which also featured the hosts and India.\n\nHowever, the tough run continued with the sporadic fifties and Ganga had to wait to shine. Then finally, when Australia toured the West Indies in 2003, he hit back to back Test tons to roar back into form. Batting at No 3 at Guyana, he had a sterling 185-run stand with Brian Lara and completed his first Test ton. He followed that up with another big stand with Lara in the Trinidad Test as he moved his way to 117.\n\nDaren Ganga (centre) scored a memorable hundred against Australia in Guyana, forging a wonderful partnership with Brian Lara (left) \u00a9 Getty Images (File Photo)\n\nGanga continued to remain in the West Indies\u2019 scheme of things and even toured South Africa for the second time. But, his form was inconsistent and by mid-2004, he was out of the side yet again. After those two tons against Australia, he had managed a highest of 73 against Zimbabwe. In early 2005, he scored 265, his highest First-Class score to return to the West Indies side against South Africa but made a duck and was dropped. He finally returned to the side for a good time in 2006 during the tour to New Zealand.\n\nWhile the big scores didn\u2019t come his way, Ganga did show good grit on his return. When India toured, he scored 135 in the third Test at St Kitts and 60 not out in the second innings. On a tough track at Jamaica in the next Test, his innings of 40 was a proof of his quality. With those performances, he truly established himself and later on the tour to Pakistan, he scored 82 and 81, which showed that he was well and truly in the scheme of things. As a result, he was also named the West Indies Player\u2019s Associations (WIPA) Test Player of the Year. He returned for the ODIs on the tour but could not establish himself in the side.\n\n[read-also]6080,6193[/read-also]\n\nWest Indies also witnessed a leader in Ganga. The fact that he had led West Indies A and a few age group sides had kept him in the reckoning and he had impressed with his tactical skills. While on the tour to England in 2007, when Sarwan had a nasty injury, Ganga was asked to lead the side for the remainder of the Test matches. West Indies could not win them, but they showed resolve and fight in those games, nearly coming close in a tough run-chase at Manchester. On a personal note, the only highlight for him on the tour was an innings of 49 and 31 not out at Lord\u2019s.\n\nGanga then moved to South Africa in 2007-08 with a bit of pressure. This time, the inconsistency got the better of him as he could score only 117 runs in six innings and was dropped from the side. That was his last outing in international cricket. It ended where it all started almost a decade ago.\n\nFor Trinidad and Tobago, Ganga continued to remain a vital cog in their unit and led them to victory in the regional T20 tournaments. It was with a team of dashers that he entered the inaugural Champions League Twenty20 (CLT20) in India in 2009. The less fancied team stunned the world with a breathtaking performance and saw the emergence of Kieron Pollard and Adrian Barath to name a few. His team went through to the final and was easily the most popular unit of the tournament. As a captain, he led from the front and became the face of the team and essayed a crucial knock in the semi-final. The defeat in the finals was difficult to take, but it was a memorable performance.\n\nGanga continued to lead Trinidad and Tobago and returned for the tournament in 2011. However, their spirit wasn\u2019t enough this time and they couldn\u2019t replicate that famous performance. In November 2011, he quit as captain and has only played a few games since.\n\nGanga has since donned the role of a commentator and is seen at various cricketing events around the world. An articulate speaker, he had pursued law during his playing days and also runs the Daren Ganga Foundation, which looks after underprivileged kids."}]}
