Rickard\n\nDonald Mackinnon (1892-1965), pastoralist and diplomat, was born on 30 April 1892 at Prahran, Melbourne, eldest of six children of Victorian-born parents Donald Mackinnon, barrister, and his wife Hilda Eleanor Marie, n\u00e9e Bunny. His grandfathers were Daniel Mackinnon and Frederick Bunny; Rupert Bunny was his uncle. After attending Melbourne Church of England Grammar School, young Donald boarded at Geelong Church of England Grammar School where he won prizes for Latin and Greek, edited the school magazine and was a prefect. He enrolled in law at the University of Melbourne and entered Ormond College in 1910. From 1911 to 1913 he read classics at New College, Oxford, but did not graduate.\n\nHaving served (from 1911) in the ranks of the King Edward's Horse, Mackinnon was commissioned in March 1914. He was sent to the Western Front in April 1915. Wounded on 29 March 1916, he was evacuated to London. In 1916-17 he commanded reserve units in Ireland. He returned to France as a captain in 1918 and, following the Armistice, again embarked for Ireland. At All Saints Church, Grangegorman, Dublin, on 12 June 1917 he had married Minella Beatrice Seymour with the rites of the Church of Ireland.\n\nBy 1919 Mackinnon was back in Australia. He drove cattle on his uncle's property, Marion Downs, near Boulia, Queensland, then moved to Melbourne where he completed (by correspondence) a course in accountancy. Failing to secure management of any of the family properties, and spurred by his wife's unhappiness in Melbourne, he took her to England in 1924. He worked for the Union Cold Storage Co. Ltd in London's Smithfield market. Following his divorce, he married Mary Hindle James, a 27-year-old physiotherapist, on 10 September 1927 at the register office, St Marylebone.\n\nWhen the meat merchants, Vestey Bros Ltd, offered Mackinnon an opportunity to represent their interests in Argentina, he sailed for Buenos Aires in 1929. Appointed a director (1937) of Anglo Frigorifico, he was widely respected in commercial circles. During World War II he was a member of 'Los Tamberos', a clandestine organization formed to combat the activities of Germans in Argentina. Despite his British connexions, he retained a strong sense of his nationality and wanted to expand trade between Australia and South America. He later claimed that he had 'been selling Australia in one form or another since 1929'.\n\nIn 1946 Mackinnon returned home. Settling on the family property, Marida Yallock, near Terang, Victoria, he soon became involved in local politics and was elected president of the Terang branch of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia. He joined the State executive of the Liberal Party and was its vice-president in 1948. That year cabinet appointed him to the Victorian Inland Meat Authority. In August 1949 he won the presidency of the Liberal and Country Party of Victoria. He was a co-opted member of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization's advisory council in 1952-57.\n\nMackinnon had gained extensive knowledge of South America's primary and secondary industries, of its politics, and of the international trade in meat. This expertise, and his knowledge of Spanish and Portuguese, proved assets when he was posted (1957) as Australian minister to Brazil. In 1958 he was appointed C.B.E. and promoted ambassador. His 'unusual but completely effective' approach to diplomacy was praised. Returning to Victoria in 1960, he led the Australian trade mission to South America in 1962.\n\nA tall man of military bearing, Mackinnon had a purposeful manner, a quiet sense of humour and an ability to communicate ideas. He was forthright, energetic and gentlemanly. Initially a small 'l' Liberal, he grew suspicious of government subsidies and in 1964-65 opposed the introduction of a reserve-price scheme for wool. At the same time, however, he feared that the Liberal Party would be unduly influenced by big business. Described as a 'driving force' in the party, he worked closely with leading members of the parliamentary wing, including Sir Robert Menzies. Mackinnon advised the Federal treasurer Harold Holt on rural policy and lent his support to the aspiring Andrew Peacock.\n\nA director of Trufood of Australia Pty Ltd, Mackinnon was a member of the Australian Primary Producers' Union and president (1964) of the Melbourne Club. His newspaper articles (1960-62) provided a lively commentary on South American trade, politics and social issues. He died on 2 May 1965 at Terang and was buried in the local cemetery with Presbyterian forms; his wife, daughter and two sons survived him, as did the daughter of his first marriage."}, {"url": "https://ourhistory.is.ed.ac.uk/index.php/Donald_Mackinnon_(1839-1914)", "page_content": "Professor of Celtic, 1882-1914\n\nDonald Mackinnon was born in Kilchattan on Colonsay, in the Hebrides, on 18 April 1839. He was educated locally and then later, from the age of eighteen, at the Church of Scotland Training College, Edinburgh, which was a popular route to studying at Edinburgh University. Between 1860 and 1863 he was engaged as a school-teacher in Lochinver, Sutherlandshire, where he made a close study of the dialects and literature of the North Highlands.\n\nMackinnon studied at the University of Edinburgh where he obtained the degree of M.A. in 1870. Earlier, in 1869, he had become Clerk to the Church of Scotland's Educational Scheme, and in 1872 he was Clerk to the Endowed Schools and Hospitals Commission. After the passing of the Education Act, and on the formation of the School Board of Edinburgh, Mackinnon was appointed as its first Clerk and Treasurer. This was a difficult time to hold such a position because Scottish Education was in the transition stage from control by the Churches to control by elected bodies.\n\nIn 1882, he became the first Professor of Celtic at Edinburgh University, and he held the chair until 1914. His experience and acquaintance with the North Highlands served him in his capacity as member of the Crofters Royal Commission chaired by Lord Napier in 1883. Mackinnon's contribution to the Commission's Report was impressive enough to speed up subsequent legislation for the improvement of conditions for Scotland's crofters. Among his publications were the Reading book for the use of students of the Gaelic class at Edinburgh University (1889), and On the dialects of Scottish Gaelic .\n\nProfessor Donald Mackinnon died in Balnahard on Colonsay on 25 December 1914."}, {"url": "https://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/mackinnon-donald-7397", "page_content": "by Geoffrey Serle\n\nDonald Mackinnon (1859-1932), politician, was born on 29 September 1859 at Marida Yallock, Boorcan, Victoria, eldest son of Daniel Mackinnon and his wife Jane, n\u00e9e Kinross. He was educated at Geelong Church of England Grammar School and Trinity College, University of Melbourne. A family friend (Professor) Herbert Strong introduced him to New College, Oxford, where his first tutor and later friend was W. A. Spooner (famed for 'Spoonerisms'). Mackinnon's first impression of Oxford was that 'the young men here seem to be very effeminate, they are painfully fond of laughing at nothing and talk in a very affected way'. He studied classics and jurisprudence; a serious student, he had hopes of second-class honours but took a 'good' third-class B.A. in 1883. At 5 ft 11 in (180 cm) and 11\u00bd stone (73 kg) he rowed, was on the fringe of the university cricket team as a round-arm bowler, and learned French and German in long vacations on the Continent. He was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple in 1883 and admitted to the Victorian Bar next year.\n\nIn Melbourne Mackinnon built a modest Bar practice while writing for the Argus and Australasian. He joined the Melbourne and Bohemian clubs, and went in for amateur theatricals but regretted having to 'waste' many evenings on 'dinners, routs, dances and fool-playing generally' at the height of the boom. In 1889 Chief Justice George Higinbotham selected him to assist in his massive consolidation of the Victorian statutes; they worked together far into the night for many months. Higinbotham later commended his fidelity, industry, skill and exact knowledge.\n\nOn his father's death in 1889 Mackinnon inherited Marida Yallock, which his brother William Kinross Mackinnon (1861-1943) managed for most of his life. On 19 August 1891 at All Saints Church of England, St Kilda, he married Hilda Eleanor Marie Bunny, daughter of Brice Bunny and sister of Rupert Bunny.\n\nDespite his pastoral background and wealth, Mackinnon became a radical liberal politician. Although wide reading had induced well-informed, liberal and tolerant views, in the late 1880s he was considering standing for Western District constituencies in the pastoral interest and was perturbed by the rise of the Shearers' Union. It is likely that his association with the great popular tribune Higinbotham so changed his outlook that he accepted the traditions of radical Victorian liberalism as expounded also by Alfred Deakin and Henry Bournes Higgins. The collapse of the boom and the subsequent terrible depression further shaped his mind.\n\nAfter standing unsuccessfully in 1897 for Prahran, where he was president of the Australian Natives' Association branch, Mackinnon was narrowly elected in 1900 as 'the next best thing to a Labor man'. Supporting the Turner and Peacock ministries in 1900-02, he served usefully on royal commissions into the University of Melbourne and local government. After losing office to (Sir) William Irvine the Peacock Liberals provided only weak opposition. Early in 1904 Peacock passed the leadership to Mackinnon and the Progressive Liberal Association, linked with the Federal Deakinites, was formed.\n\nMackinnon condemned both government and railway strikers in 1903 for class hatred. He had strongly opposed Irvine's constitutional reform measures, holding that the Legislative Assembly must predominate over the Legislative Council whose veto power should be reduced to one of delay. He supported direct taxation, raising the threshold of income taxation to \u00a3200 a year, and religious instruction in schools; he opposed gambling which should be kept 'as disreputable as possible'. He favoured extension and strengthening of the Factories Act: the state had a duty to protect the weak. Above all he was a land reformer, supporting closer settlement and compulsory acquisition. 'The history of all countries shows that the occupying peasantry or yeomanry are the very salt of the country'. According to (Sir) Frederic Eggleston, Mackinnon was full of 'zeal to reform his own class and interest'. He 'remains an aristocrat, but some of Higinbotham's democracy hangs about him still', the Bulletin conceded.\n\nThe Mackinnon Liberals polled much better at the June 1904 election, but won fewer seats in the smaller reformed House, becoming generally known as 'the Victorian XI'. They sympathized with the Labor Party and often voted with it, but could not stomach Labor's extra-parliamentary organization and the pledge. Moreover Labor's fast-growing support threatened them. By early 1907 the government of (Sir) Thomas Bent, who had succeeded Irvine, was losing support and Mackinnon as Opposition leader agreed to a fusion or coalition. The Liberals gained little other than further factory legislation. The vital issues were the land valuation bill (the basis for a future land tax), under Mackinnon's control as minister without portfolio, and the Western District land scheme. Bent withdrew both pieces of legislation and in October 1908 Mackinnon, Peacock and George Swinburne resigned in disgust. Bent soon lost office and an election, and John Murray formed a ministry. Mackinnon claimed a victory for land reform, but it was a dying issue. During 1909, as fusion proceeded, his group lost its identity in a broadened Liberal Party.\n\nMackinnon remained a back-bencher until 22 December 1913 when, after a seven-month overseas trip, he became attorney-general, solicitor-general, minister of railways and vice-president of the Board of Land and Works in the Watt and subsequent Peacock ministries. He took particular satisfaction in presiding over (Sir) Leo Cussen's further consolidation of the statutes and, on the outbreak of war, carrying anti-profiteering measures.\n\nWhen Peacock was forced to reconstruct his ministry in November 1915, Mackinnon was content to withdraw and concentrate, with conspicuous success, on chairmanship of the Victorian recruiting committee. From May 1916 he was also chairman of the State War Council, primarily concerned with repatriation. After the failure of the conscription referendum, on 29 November Mackinnon was appointed Commonwealth director-general of recruiting, without pay. He set up a structure of central recruiting committees in every Federal electorate and local government area, and recruiting officers in towns. He travelled constantly to speak and confer, and himself wrote many propagandist pamphlets and articles. His policy was that recruiting must be persuasive and conciliatory, not offensive to anyone.\n\nMackinnon was perhaps the sanest man in the country on the issues which were bitterly dividing the nation. He criticized the British Army Council's demand in mid-1916 for 175,000 additional troops within a year as an 'over-estimate' and 'a hindrance and discouragement to recruiting'. He often asserted that those still advocating conscription were wrecking recruiting; he reprimanded hecklers of Labor speakers who shared his platform. The second referendum of December 1917 made his task even more difficult. He fought for increased allowances for soldiers' dependants, criticized unrealistically high medical standards for recruits, condemned the conscriptionist Melbourne press for belittling the voluntary movement, attacked the censorship for not permitting the people to know how serious the war situation was. He recognized how extraordinary it was that so many had volunteered. Mackinnon chaired the governor-general's almost useless conference on recruiting in April 1918 and earned James Scullin's tribute that 'he had acted throughout in an absolutely impartial way'. His elder sons had been serving with the British Army; the younger died from illness in August. In November the government formally thanked him for his 'sturdy optimism' and 'unfailing perseverance'.\n\nEarly in 1919 he took a long holiday in Tasmania but had energy enough to write articles describing the State. On return he chaired the soldier settler qualification committee, then on 5 June his friend Premier (Sir) Harry Lawson called on him to take over soldier settlement as minister without portfolio. Still a yeoman idealist at heart, Mackinnon threw himself into the work, searching crown lands all over Victoria for possible new farms and negotiating for purchase and compulsory acquisitions. The number of intending settlers and the speed of their repatriation was unexpected, but in fifteen months he settled some 4000 ex-servicemen. He was now, rather than a social reformer, an exponent of 'Australia Unlimited', a 'wholehogger' on immigration with visionary hopes of thickly settling the Riverina by joint planning with New South Wales and extending Victorian railways to the Northern Territory and western Queensland. But, to wide distress, he lost Prahran at last at the October 1920 election to Labor.\n\nIn twenty years as a parliamentarian Mackinnon had been a minister for five years. He never quite lived up to popular expectations. He was too much an intellectual, too principled, too conciliatory, suspect because of his background, insufficiently a demagogue, to be adequately equipped as a political leader. In his early days he was widely regarded as being an idealistic crank. But his integrity and unpretentiousness gave him moral authority; his manner displayed him as 'a sensible man talking plainly and tolerantly to sensible people'.\n\nFrom June 1923 to November 1924 Mackinnon was Australian commissioner in the United States of America, promoting trade and closer relations; he believed he did something to put Australia on the map. He knew Franklin Roosevelt and foretold his greatness. On his return he unsuccessfully sought National Party pre-selection for the Federal seat of Henty, stood as an Independent Nationalist and lost decisively to (Sir) Henry Gullett. In the next few years he travelled extensively by motor in the outback.\n\nIn his later years Mackinnon's chief interest was Geelong Grammar School whose council he had joined in 1909 and of which he was chairman from 1922. He took the lead in the appointment as headmaster from 1930 of (Sir) James Darling with whom he then worked in close co-operation. His other favourite activity was his active presidency, since 1906, of the Victorian Cricket Association. He continued as chairman of directors of the Equity Trustees, Executors & Agency Co., the Victorian Insurance Co. and the Talbot Colony for Epileptics. He was also president of the Victorian Scottish Union and chairman of trustees of Scots Church, Melbourne; his Christian faith was central to his philosophy. Like his great Victorian exemplars, he refused any honour (except a French decoration). In 1931 Herbert Brookes described him as 'one of the finest democrats this country has thrown up from the native soil' and recalled that both of them had imagined when young that Australia could be made a paradise.\n\nMackinnon died in Melbourne of cardiac disease on 25 April 1932, and was cremated. His wife and three sons and two daughters survived him. His son Donald (1892-1965) was a pastoralist and ambassador to Brazil; Ewen Daniel (1903-1983) was a grazier, Federal Liberal member of parliament and ambassador to the Argentine, Peru and Uruguay; and Kenneth Wulsten, Q.C. (1906-1964), was prominent at the English Bar. Mackinnon's estate was sworn for probate at \u00a3142,262. In his will he had provided for the statue of Higinbotham which stands adjacent to the Treasury Building, Melbourne. Mackinnon's portrait by Rupert Bunny is at Marida Yallock.\n\nHis brother James Curdie (1865-1957) was educated at Geelong Grammar and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. In his youth he managed the family property, Marion Downs, in western Queensland. In partnership with William and Edward Manifold and his brother William, he purchased Wyangarie station on the Richmond River, New South Wales, and by 1916 had managed its subdivision into one hundred dairy farms. He became chairman of directors of the Union Trustee Co. of Australia, Strachan & Co. Ltd, and Trufood of Australia Ltd. He did not marry."}, {"url": "https://www.giffordlectures.org/lecturers/donald-mackenzie-mackinnon", "page_content": "Norse-Hulse Professor of Divinity, Cambridge\n\nBio\n\nDonald MacKinnon was educated at Cargilfield School Edinburgh (1921\u201326) Winchester College (1926\u201331) and New College Oxford (1931\u201335) where he also held a scholarship and graduated in both Greats and Theology.
