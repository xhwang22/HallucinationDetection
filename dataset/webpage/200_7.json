At 30 years old, Koscielny is a fantastically experienced center back at the club level, although he has already been surpassed by Varane for international appearances.\n\nDespite making just 23 appearances for his country, Koscielny has played over 300 matches for the first team at club level. Since moving from France in 2010, he has plied his trade in Arsenal\u2019s back line, sometimes slotting in at right back, but more often at center back (ESPN). He has been a central figure for the Gunners since his arrival, and Arsenal have endured great success since his arrival.\n\nKoscielny\u2019s style of play can be considered traditional. Alongside Per Mertesacker, his powerful but slow moving center back partner at Arsenal, Koscielny has proven his fleet of foot and good tactical awareness. He is also quite useful from corner kicks in attack as well. He has even scored 15 goals in his time at Arsenal, none bigger than the one below, which not only demonstrates his offensive ability but also his clutch ability in big game situations.\n\nKoscielny equalizes for Arsenal in the FA Cup final (YouTube)\n\nHow to cite this article: \u201cProjected France Starting XI at Euro 2016\u201d Written by Jeremy Roth and David Talpalar (2016), European Cup 2016 Guide, Soccer Politics Blog, Duke University, http://sites.duke.edu/wcwp/tournament-guides/european-cup-2016-guide/identity-and-the-french-national-team/notable-players-in-the-projected-french-squad-with-african-heritage/laurent-koscielny/ (accessed on (date))."}, {"url": "https://www.sportingnews.com/us/l-koscielny/news/koscielny-to-retire-from-france-national-team-after-world-cup/1pf9qzov1feoz1ncl3qcryyzlg", "page_content": "Laurent Koscielny has decided the 2018 World Cup in Russia will be his last for country, announcing his retirement from international football following the tournament.\n\nFrance 11/2 to win the World Cup\n\nThe Arsenal and France defender has represented Les Bleus on 49 occasions but is now ready to step back from the international game.\n\n\"Yes I think (I will retire from France),\" Koscielny told a press conference. \"I have six months left to enjoy my time with France.

However, Koscielny has always had the desire to prove himself:\n\n\u201cMy career is unusual, I arrived in professional football when I was 18. I didn\u2019t play for the France youth teams. I never thought I would be here today at this club (Arsenal).\u201d\n\nNow a much improved player, Koscielny is entering a stage of his career where he is now seen as the senior player for club and country. The consistency of his performances have been noted by team mate Gabriel, who referred to Koscielny as an ideal role model, saying:\n\n\u201cHe has been showing throughout the season that he can be one of the best, or is one of the best, defenders in the world. I feel very happy and want to train more and more every day to be better in every match to make sure I can get to his level.\u201d\n\nCapped 29 times for France, Koscielny has emerged as a potential captain for Arsenal for the upcoming 2016/17 season with Mikel Arteta leaving and Per Mertesacker\u2019s first team role diminishing.\n\nThe EUROs could be the perfect platform for Koscielny to prove his captain credentials to both Arsene Wenger and Arsenal fans, with the latter still needing convincing despite their admiration for Koscielny as a player.\n\nKoscielny\u2019s defensive partnership with Per Mertesacker has proven to be an ideal combination in recent years, with the former\u2019s pace and recovery runs complimenting Mertesacker\u2019s superb reading of the game.\n\nMoreover, Mertesacker\u2019s leadership qualities enable Koscielny to focus on his own performance, with the World Cup winner using his excellent vocal skills to organise the defenders and play a key role off the pitch.\n\nHowever, Mertesacker\u2019s influence on the team is now decreasing, as the German gets older, leaving the captain\u2019s armband up for grabs.\n\nFuture Arsenal captain?\n\nWith well over 200 appearances for the north London club, Koscielny should be one of the favourites for the captaincy. However, there are concerns about his lack of vocal skills, with even Wenger stating that the Frenchman is not a \u201creal commander\u201d.\n\nDuring the 2015/16 season Wenger gave Koscielny the captain\u2019s armband, perhaps with a view to seeing how he could handle the role. The 2-0 win away at Bournemouth (7th February, 2016) was Koscielny\u2019s first experience of captaining Arsenal in a league game, a much more enjoyable experience compared to the 3-2 defeat against an injury-hit Manchester United.\n\nThe closing months of the season saw Koscielny regularly lead out his team, following in the footsteps of great Arsenal captains such as Tony Adams and Patrick Vieira.\n\nArsenal fans long to see a captain in the mould of those mentioned, individuals who motivated the dressing room and challenged teammates. The problem is Koscielny is not this type of individual, as he himself explains:\n\n\u201cThere is no point to talk too much, anyway. It has to be at the right time, for the right thing and the right way too. Sometimes, also, you don\u2019t need to talk. Just a look or a gesture is enough. I\u2019m more like that.\u201d\n\nThe injury situation with France has forced Laurent Koscielny to take added responsibility. Euro 2016 therefore might just go some way to proving to Arsenal fans that they do have a natural leader in their ranks.\n\nRecent comments from Koscielny offer hope that the Frenchman is embracing his senior role for club and country, with the Arsenal centre-back supportive of teammate Adil Rami in the press, saying:\n\n\u201cI have spoken with Adil, our midfielders, with Hugo (Lloris), we are trying to bed him in. As I said to him, you have to stay calm, he has had a great season with Sevilla, he is capable of having great matches, it is just a question of being calm and positive. We are here to help him. I believe in him, we are all together.\u201d\n\nT o win the EUROs France will require Laurent Koscielny to be at his very best, protecting the likes of Rami, Mangala and Umtiti.\n\nThe Arsenal centre-back is one of the first names on Deschamps\u2019 team sheet. A commanding performance this summer might also make him the clear favourite to be the next permanent Arsenal captain.\n\nArsene Wenger and Arsenal fans will be watching closely.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @JustFootball or Facebook for the latest football news, analysis and opinion during Euro 2016 and beyond.\n\n(main image credit: Ian Latham via Flickr.)"}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/laurent-koscielny/", "page_content": "Laurent Koscielny ( French pronunciation: [lo\u0281\u0251\u0303 kosj\u025bl\u0272i]; born 10 September 1985) is a French footballer who plays as a centre-back for English club Arsenal and the France national team. Koscielny is the vice-captain of Arsenal. He has been described as a clever, agile and ball-playing defender.\n\nKoscielny was born in the city of Tulle and began his football career playing for a host of amateur and youth clubs such as Brive, Tulle Corr\u00e8ze and Limoges. In 2003, he moved to Guingamp, where he made his professional debut the following year. Koscielny joined Tours for an undisclosed fee to play in the third tier of the French league in 2007 and enjoyed promotion with his new side before being named in the Ligue 2 Team of the Season the following campaign. In 2009, newly promoted Ligue 1 side Lorient signed Koscielny for around \u20ac1.7 million, and his performances caught the eye of Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who signed him in 2010. Since then, he is regarded as one of the best players in his position in the Premier League.\n\nKoscielny was first called up to the French national team on 4 February 2011 and has since represented the country at UEFA Euro 2012, UEFA Euro 2016, and at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Prior to his call-up for France, he was also eligible to play for Poland, as a result of his family roots.\n\nClub career\n\nEarly career\n\nKoscielny was born in Tulle, Corr\u00e8ze. His career began in 2004 with Guingamp, a team that had produced such talents as Didier Drogba and Florent Malouda. Three years later, Koscielny was forced to take stock and drop down to the French third tier. He made 47 appearances for Guingamp, between 2004 and 2007, mostly as a right fullback.\n\nIn 2007, Koscielny joined Tours FC, deciding that he wanted a chance at centre back. He showed remarkable improvement in aerial ability and positional awareness that limited him to just three yellow cards. During the 2008\u201309 season, Koscielny made 34 Ligue 2 appearances, scoring 5 goals from defence, and was named in the division's best XI at the end of the season.\n\nLorient\n\nOn 16 June 2009, newly promoted Ligue 1 side FC Lorient signed Koscielny on a four-year contract for around \u20ac1.7 million. He established himself as a starter and played in his preferred centre-back position. Over one season at the club, he scored 3 goals in 35 appearances. On 7 March 2010 Koscielny tapped in his first Ligue 1 goal against Olympique Marseille at Stade V\u00e9lodrome in the 65th minute in a 1\u20131 draw. Koscielny became a fan favourite when he scored his second goal with a header deep in injury time against Montpellier in a 2\u20132 draw after a cross from Olivier Monterrubio.\n\nHe scored another against Bordeaux after 11 minutes. However, he received a red card 15 minutes later for a foul in the penalty area against his future Arsenal teammate Marouane Chamakh. Koscielny helped Lorient to finish the campaign in 7th place; its best finish in Ligue 1. An impressive season culminated in reports from French daily Ouest-France that the defender was training with the Arsenal reserves ahead of an official announcement. On 6 July 2010, Koscielny agreed personal terms with Arsenal. Arsenal's initial offer for Koscielny was believed to be in the region of \u00a34 million, while they were then prepared to do a deal that would also involve youngster Francis Coquelin moving on loan in the opposite direction, which Lorient rejected. During the summer transfer window of 2010 reports began to emerge in late June that a deal had been reached to bring Koscielny to Arsenal for a reported sum of \u00a38.45 million.\n\nArsenal\n\n2010\u201311 season\n\n\"I don't believe any French player would have refused to come and play for Arsenal. It took me four years to go from the bench of Ligue 2 to Arsenal so it is a great achievement. I have been on the crest of a wave for the last few years. But it is just the beginning; I haven't proved anything yet. Arsenal is a reference for football.\" Laurent Koscielny\n\nArsenal confirmed the signing on 7 July 2010 and Koscielny was handed the club's number 6 shirt, previously worn by Philippe Senderos, who had moved to Fulham earlier in the summer. Wenger explained he bought Koscielny due to the fact he added height to the team and Arsenal were low on centre backs. Koscielny made his debut against Barnet in a pre-season friendly in July 2010. One month later in his competitive debut against Liverpool at Anfield, he was sent off in the 94th minute for a second bookable offence. Both of his yellow cards were shown beyond 90 minutes. The game ended in a 1\u20131 draw with both teams having debut players sent off. He scored his first goal for Arsenal on 11 September 2010, in a 4\u20131 win against Bolton Wanderers.\n\nKoscielny made his debut in European competition on 15 September 2010, when he partnered S\u00e9bastien Squillaci in a 6\u20130 win over Braga at the Emirates Stadium. Koscielny was praised for performances against Sunderland and made a brilliant tackle against Tottenham Hotspur to stop Aaron Lennon from scoring during their Football League Cup tie. On 27 October, he blocked a shot off the line and provided an assist to Theo Walcott against Newcastle United in the fourth round of the League Cup, where Arsenal went on to win the match 4\u20130 at St James' Park. Koscielny was given a straight red card in Arsenal's 0\u20131 loss at home against Newcastle United on 7 November 2010. This was his second sending off of the season.\n\nKoscielny playing for Arsenal on 10 September 2011 against Swansea City.\n\nOn 25 January 2011, Koscielny scored the second goal in the 3\u20130 win over Ipswich Town in the League Cup semi-final second leg win at the Emirates Stadium. Throughout January 2011, Koscielny and Johan Djourou were a part of a defence that did not concede a goal in the Premier League. On 1 February, he scored his third goal of the season, which proved to be the winner in a 2\u20131 turn around victory over Everton. Koscielny had arguably his best performance to date for Arsenal in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16 match against Barcelona. The match ended in a 2\u20131 home win for Arsenal. Koscielny's performances were applauded and praised in many media reports of the game. Former Arsenal defender, Martin Keown, said his performance was \"impressive\" and \"magnificent throughout\". On 27 February, in the last minute of the 2011 Football League Cup Final, Koscielny was involved in a mix-up with his goalkeeper Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny, which resulted in Birmingham City striker Obafemi Martins scoring the winning goal.\n\n2011\u201312 season\n\nKoscielny and Fernando Torres in a Premier League match on 21 April 2012.\n\nKoscielny started the 2011\u201312 season alongside Thomas Vermaelen in central defence. Koscielny was injured and taken off the pitch 10 minutes into a 2\u20130 home loss to Liverpool on 20 August 2011. However, he returned to the starting line-up Arsenal's biggest ever Premier League defeat, losing 8\u20132 to Manchester United at Old Trafford.

With manager Arsene Wenger opting to play Gabriel Paulista ahead of vice-captain Per Mertesacker, Koscielny began appearing as captain in February, due to injuries to other captains Santi Cazorla & Mikel Arteta.

He is vice-captain of Arsenal.\n\nBorn in Tulle, Koscielny began his football career playing for a host of youth clubs before moving to Guingamp in 2003, where he quickly progressed through the youth ranks, making his professional debut the following season. After becoming frustrated at being played out of position as a right back, he joined Tours for an undisclosed fee, quickly establishing himself as the team\u2019s star player in his desired position, ultimately aiding in the club\u2019s promotion into Ligue 1, while also being named in the Ligue 2 Team of the Season.[3] Koscielny continued his impressive performances following a \u20ac1.7 million transfer to fellow French outfit Lorient in 2009, receiving multiple plaudits for his performances, largely cultivating a reputation as a clever, agile, ball-playing defender.[3] His achievements and footballing potential attracted Arsenal, ultimately moving to the Premier League side for a fee of \u00a38.45 million the following season.\n\nFollowing his arrival to England, Koscielny has widely been regarded to be one of the best players in his position, as well as one of the best in the world.[4][5] He has since established himself as a core component in the Arsenal first team, as well as contributing with a host of individual performances, including aiding in ending the club\u2019s nine-year trophy drought, scoring a crucial equalizer en route to winning the FA Cup in 2014. He was also crucial in further club successes that followed, winning another two FA Cups and the FA Community Shield on three occasions.\n\nDespite having the ability to represent Poland, Koscielny instead decided to represent France, and first appeared up for the national team against Brazil in February 2011.[6] Koscielny has since become a regular starter for the nation in every major tournament that they have appeared in, including UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup, while also leading France to the final of UEFA Euro 2016. He scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland in 2016,[7] and has since amassed forty-nine appearances for the national side.\n\nPrior to the beginning of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Koscielny announced that he would be retiring from international football after the competition, and thus no longer be playing for France.\n\nKoscielny was born in Tulle, Corr\u00e8ze. His career began in 2004 with Guingamp, a team that had produced such talents as Didier Drogba and Florent Malouda. Three years later, Koscielny was forced to take stock and drop down to the French third tier. He made 47 appearances for Guingamp, between 2004 and 2007, mostly as a right fullback.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2007, Koscielny joined Tours FC, deciding that he wanted a chance at centre back. He showed remarkable improvement in aerial ability and positional awareness that limited him to just three yellow cards. During the 2008\u201309 season, Koscielny made 34 Ligue 2 appearances, scoring 5 goals from defence, and was named in the division\u2019s best XI at the end of the season.\n\nArsenal confirmed the signing on 7 July 2010 and Koscielny was handed the club\u2019s number 6 shirt, previously worn by Philippe Senderos, who had moved to Fulham earlier in the summer. Wenger explained he bought Koscielny due to the fact he added height to the team and Arsenal were low on centre backs.[10] Koscielny made his debut against Barnet in a pre-season friendly in July 2010. One month later in his competitive debut against Liverpool at Anfield, he was sent off in the 94th minute for a second bookable offence. Both of his yellow cards were shown beyond 90 minutes. The game ended in a 1\u20131 draw with both teams having debut players sent off.[11] He scored his first goal for Arsenal on 11 September 2010, in a 4\u20131 win against Bolton Wanderers.[12]\n\nKoscielny made his debut in European competition on 15 September 2010, when he partnered S\u00e9bastien Squillaci in a 6\u20130 win over Braga at the Emirates Stadium. Koscielny was praised for performances against Sunderland and made a brilliant tackle against Tottenham Hotspur to stop Aaron Lennon from scoring during their Football League Cup tie. On 27 October, he blocked a shot off the line and provided an assist to Theo Walcott against Newcastle United in the fourth round of the League Cup, where Arsenal went on to win the match 4\u20130 at St James\u2019 Park. Koscielny was given a straight red card in Arsenal\u2019s 0\u20131 loss at home against Newcastle United on 7 November 2010. This was his second sending off of the season.\n\nKoscielny playing for Arsenal on 10 September 2011 against Swansea City.\n\nOn 25 January 2011, Koscielny scored the second goal in the 3\u20130 win over Ipswich Town in the League Cup semi-final second leg win at the Emirates Stadium. Throughout January 2011, Koscielny and Johan Djourou were a part of a defence that did not concede a goal in the Premier League. On 1 February, he scored his third goal of the season, which proved to be the winner in a 2\u20131 turn around victory over Everton. Koscielny had arguably his best performance to date for Arsenal in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16 match against Barcelona. The match ended in a 2\u20131 home win for Arsenal. Koscielny\u2019s performances were applauded and praised in many media reports of the game. Former Arsenal defender, Martin Keown, said his performance was \u201cimpressive\u201d and \u201cmagnificent throughout\u201d.[13] On 27 February, in the last minute of the 2011 Football League Cup Final, Koscielny was involved in a mix-up with his goalkeeper Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny, which resulted in Birmingham City striker Obafemi Martins scoring the winning goal.[14]\n\n2011\u201312 season\n\nKoscielny and Fernando Torres in a Premier League match on 21 April 2012.\n\nKoscielny started the 2011\u201312 season alongside Thomas Vermaelen in central defence. Koscielny was injured and taken off the pitch 10 minutes into a 2\u20130 home loss to Liverpool on 20 August 2011. However, he returned to the starting line-up Arsenal\u2019s biggest ever Premier League defeat, losing 8\u20132 to Manchester United at Old Trafford. On 17 September, Koscielny scored an own goal as Arsenal lost 4\u20133 to Blackburn Rovers in the Premier League. He went on to be named man of the match away at Olympique Marseille in the Champions League, where Arsenal won 1\u20130 at the Stade V\u00e9lodrome, keeping their first clean sheet in a Champions League away game since 18 August 2009 against Celtic, where the Gunners had won 2\u20130.\n\nOn 29 October, Koscielny received praise for his solid performance in Arsenal\u2019s 5\u20133 away win against Chelsea.

The rugged centre-back has not stopped climbing the football ladder ever since.\n\nOne outstanding campaign in Brittany was enough to convince Ars\u00e8ne Wenger to bring him to north London, where he initially showed promise before truly excelling last term as Arsenal FC's most used and arguably most consistent defender. Laurent Blanc rewarded the 26-year-old for his outstanding form by handing him a first France cap against the United States last November, then named the pacy, tenacious stopper as one of only three centre-backs in his UEFA EURO 2012 squad.\n\nA suspension for Philippe Mex\u00e8s means Koscielny's inexorable rise should continue on Saturday when he is expected to make his competitive international bow in the quarter-finals against Spain. Not that he seems at all fazed by the thought of taking on Andr\u00e9s Iniesta and friends in the biggest game of his career so far. Having spent several years fighting his way through the lower leagues, he simply wants to savour the occasion. \"Ever since I left Tours, I've had a positive attitude,\" Koscielny told UEFA.com. \"I had some difficult times at the beginning of my career. I know it's not easy to be a footballer. Your career can be over very quickly \u2013 or it can go the other way. So I'm trying to enjoy every moment.\"\n\nIf Blanc had any doubts about bringing the inexperienced defender to Poland and Ukraine, he would surely have been reassured by his commanding displays for the Gunners in the UEFA Champions League over the last two seasons. \"I'm fortunate to be playing for a very prestigious club,\" the defender mused. \"I give my all every weekend so that I can continue playing in and enjoying the big games \u2013 especially the Champions League games against Europe's very best teams. I'm just really happy to have this job.\"\n\nKoscielny nevertheless had a bumpy ride in his first Premier League campaign. Indeed, life in England got off to an inauspicious start when received his marching orders away to Liverpool FC after handling the ball as a certain Fernando Torres raced past him. \"My memories of that game are mixed,\" he said. \"I was making my debut in a legendary stadium and we got a good draw, but I was sent off at the end.\" Torres has since joined Chelsea FC, where he has been less prolific, yet Koscielny will not be taking the Spaniard lightly at the Donbass Arena. \"Torres is a great player and a great goalscorer. Great strikers never die,\" he warned. \"They sometimes fall asleep for a bit, but they wake up sooner or later.\"\n\nTorres will not be the only familiar Spanish face for France's No21 in Donetsk. Koscielny's first captain at Arsenal, Cesc F\u00e0bregas, may also line up for the opposition \u2013 and the Frenchman is looking forward to catching up with the FC Barcelona midfielder. \"Cesc's a great player,\" he enthused. \"He's skilful and reads the game well. It'll be nice to see him. I'll try to talk to him before and after, but our friendship will be put to one side during the match.\"\n\nThe last time Koscielny faced Spanish opposition, F\u00e0bregas was lining up alongside him. Although Arsenal lost on aggregate to Barcelona on that occasion, their rookie centre-back played superbly well and says he will draw on that experience on Saturday. \"Many of Spain's players are from Barcelona,\" he noted. \"I'm familiar with their style and that could help. I know it won't be easy against the European champions, but we have our own qualities. I hope the best team wins.\" Whatever happens, Koscielny will savour the moment."}, {"url": "https://metro.co.uk/2022/01/22/why-ex-arsenal-captain-laurent-koscielnys-return-to-france-hasnt-worked-out-15957535/", "page_content": "Laurent Koscielny has been axed by Bordeaux (Picture: Getty)\n\nSuch weird and wonderful events happen in the transfer window. In France, certain players are being ordered to leave before they have even found a club for which to sign.\n\nLast week the Bordeaux president and owner Gerard Lopez phoned the agent of club captain Laurent Koscielny and told him his client was no longer wanted. The 36-year-old former Arsenal skipper has not, it is understood, provided the standards of performances on the pitch or leadership off it the club expected of him. Bordeaux want him out before the end of the month.\n\nKoscielny played 51 times for France. He is Bordeaux\u2019s highest-profile player. The story caused a stir.\n\nLaurent Koscileny left Arsenal in acrimonious circumstances two years ago\n\nTwo days on, the former Gunners defender had his say. \u2018They gave me no reason for their decision,\u2019 he told French sports daily L\u2019Equipe. \u2018They just said it was their new strategy.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a slap in the face. But I\u2019m a fighter and I\u2019ll continue to fight. In training, I\u2019m still giving my all.\u2019\n\nIn such impasses, PR machines whir into action. To intimations that have somehow made their way into the press that he enjoys a tipple with friends and family on his days off, Koscielny drily replied: \u2018Of course I like wine. I live in a wine region.\u2019\n\nBordeaux are 19th in Ligue 1. Only St Etienne sit below them in the standings. Koscielny has admitted he could have played better this season.\n\nIf form was the only metric that mattered, however, the entire squad would be up for sale. So what\u2019s the real reason behind Bordeaux banishing him?\n\nBordeaux are struggling at the foot of Ligue 1 this season (Picture: Getty)\n\nMoney, of course. Koscielny signed for Bordeaux from Arsenal in 2019, when the club was under different ownership. Then Covid-induced income losses and the collapse of a TV deal hit French football.\n\nWhen the owners for whom Koscielny signed pulled out last summer, the club nearly went under. New owner Lopez is scrabbling to make savings. Projected 2021-22 losses are estimated at between \u00a333million and \u00a354m.\n\nRevenue raising is the priority. Koscielny\u2019s contract belongs in a different era. Five other Bordeaux players have been told to find new employers. One of them, Nigeria winger Samuel Kalu, agreed this week to join Watford for \u00a33.5m. For the balance sheet, it\u2019s a start.\n\nThe on-pitch impact is another matter. Last weekend \u2014 without Koscielny \u2014 Bordeaux lost 6-0 at Rennes. It was the club\u2019s heaviest league defeat since 1986.\n\nBordeaux are one of France\u2019s great clubs. In the 1980s, under future World Cup-winning manager Aime Jacquet, sides containing midfield greats Alain Giresse and Jean Tigana won three league titles.\n\nA young Zinedine Zidane thrilled fans when Bordeaux reached the 1995 Uefa Cup final. Under Laurent Blanc, \u2018les Girondins\u2019, as they\u2019re known \u2014 a reference to the Gironde region in which Bordeaux is based \u2014 were crowned champions in 2009.\n\nSuch glories are a long way off. Relegation is a likelier prospect now.\n\nWherever he watched last weekend\u2019s match \u2014 if, indeed, he watched it at all \u2014 Koscielny might have concluded a fresh start elsewhere would be welcome.\n\nMORE : Transfer news live: Man Utd pull out of Erling Haaland race as Arsenal wait on Dusan Vlahovic decision\n\nMORE : Fiorentina chief deals huge blow to Arsenal\u2019s hopes of signing Dusan Vlahovic"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/@gentie/history-of-laurent-koscielny-5047b6fe8a03", "page_content": "History Of Laurent Koscielny gentie \u00b7 Follow \u00b7 Feb 13, 2018 10 min read -- Listen Share\n\nLaurent Koscielny (French pronunciation: [lo\u0281\u0251\u0303 kosj\u025bl\u0272i]; born 10 September 1985) is a French professional footballer who plays as a centre back for English club Arsenal and the France national team. He is vice-captain of Arsenal.\n\nBorn in Tulle, Koscielny began his football career playing for a host of youth clubs before moving to Guingamp in 2003, where he quickly progressed through the youth ranks, making his professional debut the following season. After becoming frustrated at being played out of position as a right back, he joined Tours for an undisclosed fee, quickly establishing himself as the team\u2019s star player in his desired position, ultimately aiding in the club\u2019s promotion into Ligue 1, while also being named in the Ligue 2 Team of the Season.[3] Koscielny continued his impressive performances following a \u20ac1.7 million transfer to fellow French outfit Lorient in 2009, receiving multiple plaudits for his performances, largely cultivating a reputation as a clever, agile, ball-playing defender.[3] His achievements and footballing potential attracted Arsenal, ultimately moving to the Premier League side for a fee of \u00a38.45 million the following season.\n\nFollowing his arrival to England, Koscielny has widely been regarded to be one of the best players in his position, as well as one of the best in the world.[4][5] He has since established himself as a core component in the Arsenal first team, as well as contributing with a host of individual performances, including aiding in ending the club\u2019s nine-year trophy drought, scoring a crucial equalizer en route to winning the FA Cup in 2014. He was also crucial in further club successes that followed, winning another two FA Cups and the FA Community Shield on three occasions.\n\nDespite having the ability to represent Poland, Koscielny instead decided to represent France, and first appeared up for the national team against Brazil in February 2011.[6] Koscielny has since become a regular starter for the nation in every major tournament that they have appeared in, including UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup, while also leading France to the final of UEFA Euro 2016. He scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland in 2016,[7] and has since amassed forty-nine appearances for the national side.\n\nPrior to the beginning of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Koscielny announced that he would be retiring from international football after the competition, and thus no longer be playing for France.\n\nKoscielny was born in Tulle, Corr\u00e8ze. His career began in 2004 with Guingamp, a team that had produced such talents as Didier Drogba and Florent Malouda. Three years later, Koscielny was forced to take stock and drop down to the French third tier. He made 47 appearances for Guingamp, between 2004 and 2007, mostly as a right fullback.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2007, Koscielny joined Tours FC, deciding that he wanted a chance at centre back. He showed remarkable improvement in aerial ability and positional awareness that limited him to just three yellow cards. During the 2008\u201309 season, Koscielny made 34 Ligue 2 appearances, scoring 5 goals from defence, and was named in the division\u2019s best XI at the end of the season.\n\nArsenal confirmed the signing on 7 July 2010 and Koscielny was handed the club\u2019s number 6 shirt, previously worn by Philippe Senderos, who had moved to Fulham earlier in the summer. Wenger explained he bought Koscielny due to the fact he added height to the team and Arsenal were low on centre backs.[10] Koscielny made his debut against Barnet in a pre-season friendly in July 2010. One month later in his competitive debut against Liverpool at Anfield, he was sent off in the 94th minute for a second bookable offence. Both of his yellow cards were shown beyond 90 minutes. The game ended in a 1\u20131 draw with both teams having debut players sent off.[11] He scored his first goal for Arsenal on 11 September 2010, in a 4\u20131 win against Bolton Wanderers.[12]\n\nKoscielny made his debut in European competition on 15 September 2010, when he partnered S\u00e9bastien Squillaci in a 6\u20130 win over Braga at the Emirates Stadium. Koscielny was praised for performances against Sunderland and made a brilliant tackle against Tottenham Hotspur to stop Aaron Lennon from scoring during their Football League Cup tie. On 27 October, he blocked a shot off the line and provided an assist to Theo Walcott against Newcastle United in the fourth round of the League Cup, where Arsenal went on to win the match 4\u20130 at St James\u2019 Park. Koscielny was given a straight red card in Arsenal\u2019s 0\u20131 loss at home against Newcastle United on 7 November 2010. This was his second sending off of the season.\n\nKoscielny playing for Arsenal on 10 September 2011 against Swansea City.\n\nOn 25 January 2011, Koscielny scored the second goal in the 3\u20130 win over Ipswich Town in the League Cup semi-final second leg win at the Emirates Stadium. Throughout January 2011, Koscielny and Johan Djourou were a part of a defence that did not concede a goal in the Premier League. On 1 February, he scored his third goal of the season, which proved to be the winner in a 2\u20131 turn around victory over Everton. Koscielny had arguably his best performance to date for Arsenal in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16 match against Barcelona. The match ended in a 2\u20131 home win for Arsenal. Koscielny\u2019s performances were applauded and praised in many media reports of the game. Former Arsenal defender, Martin Keown, said his performance was \u201cimpressive\u201d and \u201cmagnificent throughout\u201d.[13] On 27 February, in the last minute of the 2011 Football League Cup Final, Koscielny was involved in a mix-up with his goalkeeper Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny, which resulted in Birmingham City striker Obafemi Martins scoring the winning goal.[14]\n\n2011\u201312 season\n\nKoscielny and Fernando Torres in a Premier League match on 21 April 2012.\n\nKoscielny started the 2011\u201312 season alongside Thomas Vermaelen in central defence. Koscielny was injured and taken off the pitch 10 minutes into a 2\u20130 home loss to Liverpool on 20 August 2011. However, he returned to the starting line-up Arsenal\u2019s biggest ever Premier League defeat, losing 8\u20132 to Manchester United at Old Trafford. On 17 September, Koscielny scored an own goal as Arsenal lost 4\u20133 to Blackburn Rovers in the Premier League. He went on to be named man of the match away at Olympique Marseille in the Champions League, where Arsenal won 1\u20130 at the Stade V\u00e9lodrome, keeping their first clean sheet in a Champions League away game since 18 August 2009 against Celtic, where the Gunners had won 2\u20130.\n\nOn 29 October, Koscielny received praise for his solid performance in Arsenal\u2019s 5\u20133 away win against Chelsea. He scored his first goal of the season on 2 January 2012 in a 2\u20131 away defeat against Fulham. He scored his first Champions League goal against A.C. Milan in a 3\u20130 victory in the round of 16 second leg. On 13 May 2012, he scored the winning goal in a 3\u20132 victory against West Bromwich Albion to ensure that Arsenal finished third in the Premier League. He was voted as the team\u2019s fourth most important player by the fans in Arsenal\u2019s Player of the Season poll for his performances throughout the 2011\u201312 season.[15]\n\n2012\u201313 season\n\nOn 24 July 2012, Koscielny signed a new long term contract with Arsenal.[16][17][18] His first goal of the season was a late equaliser against champions Manchester City on 23 September 2012 in a match which ended 1\u20131.[19] On 30 October, he scored a header from a corner in the 88th minute against Reading in the Football League Cup, helping Arsenal come back from 4\u20130 down to eventually win the game 7\u20135.[20]\n\nOn 13 March 2013, Koscielny scored against Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena in the UEFA Champions League Last 16. His goal put Arsenal 2\u20130 ahead on the night and level at 3\u20133 on aggregate, but they still exited the competition on the away goals rule.[21]\n\nOn 19 May, Koscielny scored the winning goal as Arsenal beat Newcastle United 1\u20130 at St James\u2019 Park in their final Premier League fixture of the season to secure a fourth-placed finish and qualification to the 2013\u201314 UEFA Champions League play-off round.[22]\n\nKoscielny was voted as Arsenal\u2019s second best player of the season.[23]\n\n2013\u201314 season\n\nKoscielny started the 2013\u201314 season by conceding a penalty and getting sent off in Arsenal\u2019s 3\u20131 Premier League opening day defeat at home to Aston Villa.[24] However, his partnership with Per Mertesacker saw the Gunners achieve the joint-best defensive record in the Premier League at the halfway point of the season, as the team topped the table.[25]\n\nOn 22 February 2014, Koscielny scored his first goal of the season in a 4\u20131 defeat of Sunderland.[26] In the team\u2019s penultimate home match, Koscielny scored his second goal of the season in a 3\u20130 win against Newcastle United.[26]\n\nOn 9 May 2014, Koscielny signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal.[27]\n\nOn 17 May, Koscielny scored Arsenal\u2019s equalising goal as the team came from 2\u20130 down to defeat Hull City 3\u20132 in the 2014 FA Cup Final, winning his first piece of silverware with the club.[28]\n\n2014\u201315 season\n\nKoscielny and Kieran Gibbs playing for Arsenal in a match against Chelsea on 5 October 2014\n\nOn 16 August 2014, Koscielny opened his goal-scoring account for the season, scoring Arsenal\u2019s first goal in the 2014\u201315 Premier League. The goal was header from a free-kick in first half stoppage time against Crystal Palace at the Emirates Stadium.[29] After sustaining an achilles tendon injury during the October international break, Koscielny was absent from the Arsenal team for seven weeks.[30] On 29 November, he returned to Arsenal\u2019s starting line-up alongside Per Mertesacker in central defence, as the Gunners kept a clean sheet in a 1\u20130 victory against West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns.[31] In the team\u2019s following fixture at home to Southampton, Koscielny helped Arsenal to record a second consecutive clean sheet and 1\u20130 win.[32]\n\nOn 11 January 2015, Koscielny scored the first goal in a 3\u20130 win over Stoke City.[33] On 18 January, he started in central defence as Arsenal shut out defending champions Manchester City to win 2\u20130 at the City of Manchester Stadium.[34] On 10 February, he scored the opening goal as Arsenal defeated Leicester City 2\u20131.[35] On 30 May 2015, Koscielny was selected to start in the 2015 FA Cup Final, playing the full 90 minutes in a 4\u20130 defeat of Aston Villa at Wembley Stadium.[36]\n\n2015\u201316 season\n\nKoscielny started every game in the first month of the season, excluding a 0\u20130 draw with rivals Liverpool at Emirates Stadium,[37] due to an injury. Koscielny played a vital part as Arsenal won 5 games out of six in October to go second in the Premier League, with Koscielny scoring in successive Premier League wins against Everton and Swansea.[38][39] With manager Arsene Wenger opting to play Gabriel Paulista ahead of vice-captain Per Mertesacker, Koscielny began appearing as captain in February, due to injuries to other captains Santi Cazorla & Mikel Arteta. This ended after a 3\u20132 defeat to Manchester United, when Koscielny missed four games through injury, including a North London derby at White Hart Lane.[40] He returned in a 3\u20131 away defeat to Barcelona in the Champions League, as Arsenal exited the competition at the round of 16 for the sixth season running.[41] Koscielny scored his fourth of the season in a 3\u20133 draw with West Ham.[42]\n\n2016\u201317 season\n\nKoscielny started his first game of the season in a goalless draw against Leicester City. On 10 September, he was given the role of captain and scored a fine overhead kick to equalize for the Gunners in a game which they then won 2\u20131 against Southampton making him Arsenal\u2019s highest goal scoring defender in EPL history, with the landmark achieved on his 31st birthday.[43] Koscielny was involved in a controversial incident at the end of Arsenal\u2019s 1\u20130 win over Burnley, in which Koscielny and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain were involved in a goal which appeared to be scored from an offside position after hitting Koscielny\u2019s arm. Neither the perceived deliberate handball or offside offenses were deemed to be infringements and the goal was later correctly credited to Koscielny.[44][45][46] On 12 January 2017, Koscielny, alongside teammates Francis Coquelin and Olivier Giroud signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal.[47] Two days later, he made his 200th appearance for Arsenal in the Premier League on a 4\u20130 away victory against Swansea City.[48][49]\n\nOn the last day of the 2016\u201317 season he received red card for a tackle on Enner Valencia of Everton. Arsenal lost an appeal and Koscielny was banned for three games, meaning he would miss FA Cup final.[50]\n\nAlthough he was absent from the FA Cup final and the Community Shield, Koscielny lifted both trophies alongside Per Mertesacker.\n\nKoscielny was called up to the French national team on 3 February 2011. Before his call up for France, Koscielny was also eligible to play for Poland and initially considered applying for Polish citizenship.[6] In August 2010, it was reported that he had not submitted an application and cancelled a meeting with Poland national team coach Franciszek Smuda in Warsaw on 7 August. Koscielny later declared that his priority was to play for France.[53]\n\nKoscielny was called up to the French team for the first time on 3 February 2011, for the team\u2019s friendly versus Brazil on 9 February.[54][55] Koscielny made his first appearance for les Bleus in a friendly match against the United States on 11 November, playing the entire match in a 1\u20130 win.\n\nHe made his first appearance in a major tournament during UEFA Euro 2012, when he played the entire match in a 2\u20130 defeat to Spain in the quarter-finals but was voted Man of the Match by the French media. On 15 November 2013, he was sent off in a 2014 World Cup qualifying play-off against Ukraine.\n\nOn 13 May 2014, Koscielny was named in Didier Deschamps\u2019 squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.[56] He made his FIFA World Cup debut as a substitute for the injured Mamadou Sakho in a 5\u20132 defeat of Switzerland in the team\u2019s second group match.[57] He was then named in the starting line-up for the next match against Ecuador, helping the team to a clean sheet in a 0\u20130 draw.[58] On 4 June 2016, Koscielny scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland."}, {"url": "https://www.just-football.com/2016/06/euro-2016-laurent-koscielny-leadership-france-arsenal/", "page_content": "by Adam Boufkir\n\nT he France squad named by Didier Deschamps for the European Championships is brimming with attacking talents capable of winning matches, making the host nation one of the favourites to win the competition.\n\nAntoine Griezmann, Anthony Martial, Paul Pogba, Dimitri Payet and Kingsley Coman are just some of the high profile names expected to light up the tournament for Les Bleus, who seek to win their first major European trophy since Euro 2000.\n\nDespite this flair in attack, and the power provided by Blaise Matuidi and N\u2019Golo Kante in midfield, Deschamps has had to contend with various issues at the heart of his defence.\n\nInjuries to Aymeric Laporte (Athletic Bilbao), Kurt Zouma (Chelsea) and Raphael Varane (Real Madrid) combined with the ineligibity of Mamadou Sakho (Liverpool) have limited the options available, forcing call-ups for Adil Rami and Eliaquim Mangala.\n\nLaurent Koscielny: France\u2019s unsung key man\n\nOne mainstay in the centre of the France defence is Arsenal\u2019s Laurent Koscielny, who, aged 30, is now in the prime years of his career and will be expected to lead the defensive line.\n\nHeureux et fier de participer \u00e0 cet @UEFAEURO ! #FiersdetreBleus ?????? merci \u00e0 tous pour votre soutien ! pic.twitter.com/k6ApbIKvgk \u2014 Koscielny (@6_LKOSCIELNY) May 12, 2016\n\nRegarded as one of the best defenders in the Premier League, Koscielny\u2019s aggressive style of defending has proved a big hit amongst Arsenal fans since he signed from Lorient in 2010 for under \u00a310 million.\n\nThe Frenchman has had to recover from numerous setbacks in his Arsenal career though, from his red card debut at Liverpool to a costly error in the League Cup Final defeat to Birmingham City in 2011. However, Koscielny has always had the desire to prove himself:\n\n\u201cMy career is unusual, I arrived in professional football when I was 18. I didn\u2019t play for the France youth teams. I never thought I would be here today at this club (Arsenal).\u201d\n\nNow a much improved player, Koscielny is entering a stage of his career where he is now seen as the senior player for club and country. The consistency of his performances have been noted by team mate Gabriel, who referred to Koscielny as an ideal role model, saying:\n\n\u201cHe has been showing throughout the season that he can be one of the best, or is one of the best, defenders in the world. I feel very happy and want to train more and more every day to be better in every match to make sure I can get to his level.\u201d\n\nCapped 29 times for France, Koscielny has emerged as a potential captain for Arsenal for the upcoming 2016/17 season with Mikel Arteta leaving and Per Mertesacker\u2019s first team role diminishing.\n\nThe EUROs could be the perfect platform for Koscielny to prove his captain credentials to both Arsene Wenger and Arsenal fans, with the latter still needing convincing despite their admiration for Koscielny as a player.\n\nKoscielny\u2019s defensive partnership with Per Mertesacker has proven to be an ideal combination in recent years, with the former\u2019s pace and recovery runs complimenting Mertesacker\u2019s superb reading of the game.\n\nMoreover, Mertesacker\u2019s leadership qualities enable Koscielny to focus on his own performance, with the World Cup winner using his excellent vocal skills to organise the defenders and play a key role off the pitch.\n\nHowever, Mertesacker\u2019s influence on the team is now decreasing, as the German gets older, leaving the captain\u2019s armband up for grabs.\n\nFuture Arsenal captain?\n\nWith well over 200 appearances for the north London club, Koscielny should be one of the favourites for the captaincy. However, there are concerns about his lack of vocal skills, with even Wenger stating that the Frenchman is not a \u201creal commander\u201d.\n\nDuring the 2015/16 season Wenger gave Koscielny the captain\u2019s armband, perhaps with a view to seeing how he could handle the role. The 2-0 win away at Bournemouth (7th February, 2016) was Koscielny\u2019s first experience of captaining Arsenal in a league game, a much more enjoyable experience compared to the 3-2 defeat against an injury-hit Manchester United.\n\nThe closing months of the season saw Koscielny regularly lead out his team, following in the footsteps of great Arsenal captains such as Tony Adams and Patrick Vieira.\n\nArsenal fans long to see a captain in the mould of those mentioned, individuals who motivated the dressing room and challenged teammates. The problem is Koscielny is not this type of individual, as he himself explains:\n\n\u201cThere is no point to talk too much, anyway. It has to be at the right time, for the right thing and the right way too. Sometimes, also, you don\u2019t need to talk. Just a look or a gesture is enough. I\u2019m more like that.\u201d\n\nThe injury situation with France has forced Laurent Koscielny to take added responsibility. Euro 2016 therefore might just go some way to proving to Arsenal fans that they do have a natural leader in their ranks.\n\nRecent comments from Koscielny offer hope that the Frenchman is embracing his senior role for club and country, with the Arsenal centre-back supportive of teammate Adil Rami in the press, saying:\n\n\u201cI have spoken with Adil, our midfielders, with Hugo (Lloris), we are trying to bed him in. As I said to him, you have to stay calm, he has had a great season with Sevilla, he is capable of having great matches, it is just a question of being calm and positive. We are here to help him. I believe in him, we are all together.\u201d\n\nT o win the EUROs France will require Laurent Koscielny to be at his very best, protecting the likes of Rami, Mangala and Umtiti.\n\nThe Arsenal centre-back is one of the first names on Deschamps\u2019 team sheet. A commanding performance this summer might also make him the clear favourite to be the next permanent Arsenal captain.\n\nArsene Wenger and Arsenal fans will be watching closely.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @JustFootball or Facebook for the latest football news, analysis and opinion during Euro 2016 and beyond.\n\n(main image credit: Ian Latham via Flickr.)"}, {"url": "https://www.sportingnews.com/us/l-koscielny/news/koscielny-to-retire-from-france-national-team-after-world-cup/1pf9qzov1feoz1ncl3qcryyzlg", "page_content": "Laurent Koscielny has decided the 2018 World Cup in Russia will be his last for country, announcing his retirement from international football following the tournament.\n\nFrance 11/2 to win the World Cup\n\nThe Arsenal and France defender has represented Les Bleus on 49 occasions but is now ready to step back from the international game.\n\n\"Yes I think (I will retire from France),\" Koscielny told a press conference. \"I have six months left to enjoy my time with France.
