Well, it sounds kind of boring, but it would be accurate. Buehrle surpassed the 200 inning mark for the 14th consecutive season in a 1-0 victory against the Seattle Mariners on Wednesday night.\n\nHe's just the seventh pitcher to do it since 1901, and all of the others are in the Hall of Fame. He seldom gets mentioned in the same circles as Warren Spahn, Don Sutton, Gaylord Perry, Phil Niekro, Christy Mathewson and Greg Maddux, but his effective durability is among the best who have ever pitched. And he's never gotten the volume of postseason opportunities as, say, Andy Pettitte \u2014 but he's been no less valuable during the regular season.\n\nSo it's not just longevity, which sometimes is used as a degrading code word. Buehrle has been very good, too. Note another impressive milestone for Buehrle he achieved against the M's: He's the first pitcher to record at least 200 innings with 61 or fewer walks in 14 straight years. The person he surpassed: Cy Young.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT\n\nCall Buehrle \"Mr. Accurate,\" too. Even if that also sounds kind of boring. Geez, Buehrle, c'mon.\n\nIt's kind of amazing, though, giving the biblical amounts that pitchers used to pitch 100 years ago (and even more recently), that there aren't more than seven pitchers who have gone 200 innings 14 straight times.\n\n(AP)\n\nBuehrle said he wasn't sure, in the middle of the season, if he'd make it to 200.\n\nVia MLB.com:\n\n\"I think when I had two or three starts in a row I had three innings, four innings, mixed a six-inning game in there, I kind of, I don't want to say gave up, I said, 'Hey it's not going to happen.' I did the math and said I have eight starts, I need so many innings, I didn't like my chances. It means a lot because I put this goal on myself in Spring Training.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe's probably not going to Cooperstown. Only once has Buehrle gotten significant AL Cy Young Award votes; in 2005. He led the league in starts twice, in innings twice, in batters faced twice. In WHIP, once. Made the top 10 in ERA four times. He's made five All-Star teams, won four Gold Gloves. He'd be a below-average Hall of Famer. He ranks 90th on the JAWS meter, which measures peak performance for wins above replacement level among pitchers. He's better than Whitey Ford and 13 others who are in the Hall, though.\n\nIn reaching these milestones, Buehrle might not immortalize himself with the highest honors or the most fabulous nicknames (How about \"Mr. Fabulous\"?!\"), but he does ink himself in the record books. People will know. Mark Buehrle was darned good.\n\nMore MLB coverage at Yahoo Sports:\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nDavid Brown is an editor for Big League Stew on Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?

The raw numbers say that he was an average or slightly below-average pitcher for the bulk of his Braves career. His ERA is worse than the league average, but that\u2019s park effects; adjust for that, and it\u2019s average. He didn\u2019t strike a lot of people out and thus allowed a lot of balls in play. Considering the defense behind him, that was not ideal. I expect that the two thoughts that crossed Mahler\u2019s mind most when he was on the mound in those years were \u201cPlease hit it to Hubbard\u201d and \u201cHow did he drop that?\u201d\n\nRick was signed as an undrafted free agent out of Trinity University in 1975. He dominated the low minors but ran into a speedbump in Richmond in 1977. He righted the ship and spent the next three years pitching the International League to a standstill with only 15 relief appearances in the majors in 1979 and two in 1980 to show for it. Bobby finally gave him a full chance in 1981 and he responded by going 8-6 with a 2.80 ERA, pitching both relief and in the rotation.\n\nRick wasn\u2019t as good in 1982 and wound up spending most of 1983 back in Richmond. From 1984 to 1988 he was the workhorse of the big league staff. He pitched very well in the first two years, a combined 30-25 with a 3.32 ERA (well below the league considering the park). The team collapsed anyway, and Mahler had a rough time the next two seasons, even falling out of the rotation in 1987. He rebounded some in 1988, putting up an ERA right about the average, but that team was so bad he went 9-16 anyway. He left as a free agent after the season, but was more or less washed up. After a couple of seasons in Cincinnati and a half season with the Expos, he was released.\n\nThe Braves brought Mahler back (middle of a pennant drive, though nobody quite believed that in June of 1991) but he really had nothing left. Mostly he pitched relief, but did make two starts. In one of them, against the Pirates on July 29, he went six innings, allowed two runs, and got the win. But he wiped out in his second start, against the Giants, and that was the last appearance of his career.\n\nSo, how does he rank? Hard to say. He pitched a lot of innings for the Braves. Only four men (you probably know who) have pitched more for the team since 1966. On the other hand, those innings were largely piled into a five-year stretch where the team went 341-465, so what good were they? He wasn\u2019t an ace, really, he was just the best that they had. The only positive category in which he ever led the league was starts, twice. On the other hand, he led the league in hits allowed four times, earned runs allowed twice, and losses once.\n\nI tend to think that given a real defense behind him, Rick Mahler would have won a lot of games. The Braves\u2019 defense was very bad, and he was a guy who needed a good defense. In a way, it\u2019s surprising that he did as well as he did. Tom Glavine couldn\u2019t have won with the defense Mahler had to work with. In point of fact, he didn\u2019t; he only became Tom Glavine when they were replaced with real infielders. Think on it: if Mahler could put up average ERAs with Bob Horner, Ken Oberkfell, and the Dysfunctional Duo (Ramirez and Thomas) behind him, what could he have done with Lemke and Pendleton?\n\nBut in the end, he didn\u2019t get that chance, and with the hand he was dealt he was ordinary. At any rate, I still don\u2019t really know where to rank him. It\u2019s possible that he really doesn\u2019t belong, but I just couldn\u2019t see it.\n\nRick Mahler Statistics \u2013 Baseball-Reference.com"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/rick.mahler/1946793", "page_content": "Rick Mahler\n\nbaseball player\n\nAugust 5, 1953 (age 51) Austin, Texas , United States\n\nThe two had previously been teammates playing for the Triple-A Richmond Braves.
