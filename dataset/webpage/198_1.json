He also had an apprenticeship at the Jacques Fath fashion house.\n\nUpon completing his apprenticeship, Givenchy moved to a number of fashion houses, including Robert Piguet in 1946, Lucien Lelong and Elsa Schiaparelli in 1947.\n\nShortly after joining the Schiaparelli Boutique at the Place Vend\u00f4me, he became the Artistic Director. He moved on from this with the hope of creating a modern and current style, and founded the Givenchy house on Rue Aldred de Vigny in 1952.\n\nHe started his iconic debut collection \u2018The Separates\u2019 supported by his team that included Philippe Venet and Bettina Graziana.\n\nPeople loved the simple materials, flowing skirts and elegant blouses (specifically the \u2018Bettina blouse\u2019, and it freed women from the constrictive, \u2018frumpy\u2019 looks of the time.\n\nAs soon as the collection was launched, people knew his name and had high expectations for future collections by Givenchy.\n\nGivenchy met Audrey Hepburn in the summer of 1953, who wore several Givenchy pieces for Sabrina, an American rom-com movie she starred in.\n\nThis was the beginning of a great friendship and many collaborations between Givenchy and Audrey Hepburn. Hepburn was very fond of Givenchy and his work, and once said \u2018Givenchy is far more than a couturier - he creates personalities\u2019.\n\nGivenchy dedicated his first perfume, L\u2019Indertit, to Audrey Hepburn in 1957, and she became the face of it.\n\nOne of Givenchy\u2019s idols was Cristobal Balenciaga, who was known as the King of Fashion. The same year he met Audrey Hepburn, he met Cristobal Balenciaga in New York, and the two shortly became good friends.\n\nAfter a long, extremely successful career spanning over 40 years, Givenchy retired in 1955.\n\nSome of the world\u2019s best designers succeeded him, including Alexander McQueen, Riccardo Tisci, and John Galliano. Hubert De Givenchy lived until the old age of 91. He passed away peacefully on the 10th of March 2018 in Paris.\n\nThe Rise Of Givenchy\n\nGivenchy is a popular French brand known for its haute-couture clothes, accessories, cosmetics, and perfumes.\n\nThe first collection, \u2018Separates\u2019 featured iconic designs that offered women a stylish alternative to the restrictive clothing available at the time.\n\nThis introduced a new era to French fashion, with slender hips, long necks, and slim silhouettes becoming the look everybody aspired for.\n\nGivenchy introduced a shirtdress in 1955, which was immediately sought after. Audrey Hepburn was his muse for the shirtdress, and she helped him create this groundbreaking style.\n\nIn 1958, Givenchy popularized the short skirt, which essentially revolutionized women\u2019s fashion at the time.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just women that Givenchy catered for. In 1969, Givenchy launched the \u2018Givenchy Gentleman\u2019 line, which was well received from men all over France.\n\nHe then went on to develop a scent under the same name, which was released in 1975. You can still buy variations of the scent today, and it\u2019s still popular around the globe. In 1988, Givenchy fell under the LVMH umbrella.\n\nWhat Is Givenchy Known For?\n\nGivenchy and Audrey Hepburn had a great friendship and this is one of the many things that people think of when they hear Givenchy.\n\nThe perfume L\u2019Indertit is a product of this friendship, and it became her signature scent.\n\nSince this iconic perfume, all Givenchy fragrances have managed to cultivate the same elegance as L\u2019Indertit, enhancing feminine beauty.\n\nAudrey Hepburn\u2019s Little Black Dress\n\nAnother famous collaboration between Givenchy and Audrey Hepburn is the little black dress worn by the actress in the 1961 classic Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s.\n\nThe opening scene of the film is iconic - Holly Golightly (Hepburn\u2019s character in the film) steps out of a taxi wearing a long black satin dress holding a coffee and croissant.\n\nThis dress is considered one of the most influential dresses in costume design.\n\nAlthough Coco Chanel introduced the concept of a little black dress in 1920, Givenchy modernized it and brought it into popular culture.\n\nBaby Doll Dress\n\nGivenchy reformed the look of women\u2019s waistlines - as well as introducing shirt dresses to the women of France, he also introduced the baby doll dress.\n\nInspired by friend and idol Balenciaga, Givenchy made the dress to free women of the uncomfortable clothing available at the time.\n\nThe design of the babydoll dress is said to have come from a dream of Givenchy\u2019s, where a woman was free and no longer constrained by layers of uncomfortable fabric.\n\nThe babydoll dress was freeing, comfortable, and stylish. The ultra-light style enabled women to move freely without restrictions, and without having to lift layers of skirt.\n\nBalloon Coat\n\nAnother one of Givenchy\u2019s freeing and liberating designs is the balloon coat.\n\nThis was extremely popular upon launching and was created around the same time as the babydoll dress, inspired by the same dream of the free woman.\n\nThe coat was launched in the early 1960s and set the tone for the decade.\n\nThe sloped shoulders and wide, free silhouette was seen in various fashion pieces of the \u201960s, and it\u2019s all down to the Givenchy balloon coat.\n\nGivenchy Today\n\nClare Waight Keller became the artistic director of Givenchy haute couture and women and men\u2019s ready-to-wear collections in 2017.\n\nClaire Waight Keller is a British stylist and designer with plenty of professional experience, having been artistic director of Pringle of Scotland, and more notably, Chlo\u00e9.\n\nShe replaced Riccardo Tisci, becoming the first female artistic director of Givenchy.\n\nIn 2018, American actress Meghan Markle married Prince Harry in a dress designed by Givenchy. This dress was seen by millions and was stylishly simple and elegant.\n\nGivenchy clothes are available all around the globe and through many retailers including the Givenchy store, and online retailers such as Geometra Fashion."}, {"url": "https://brandwick.com/givenchy-brand-evolution/", "page_content": "Givenchy: Brand Evolution Published on:\n\nGivenchy is a French luxury fashion and perfume house founded by Hubert de Givenchy in 1952. It is among the most recognizable brands in the world today, and it is a symbol of French haute couture. Its clientele includes celebrities, including Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, and Jackie Kennedy.\n\nToday, Givenchy is owned by the LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy) group and is a leading fashion brand in over 70 countries.\n\nOrigin of Givenchy\n\nIn 1952, when French designer Hubert de Givenchy was 24 years old, he established his fashion house in Paris, France, called the \u201cHouse of Givenchy.\u201d\n\nFirst collection and the iconic Bettina blouse\n\nIn 1953, Givenchy presented his first collection Les S\u00e9parables with some floaty skirts and puffy blouses made from raw cotton. Due to a scarcity of funds in the initial days, the first collection was made of men\u2019s white shirt material.\n\nThis collection included the iconic \u201cBettina blouses,\u201d named after the model Bettina Graziani. It is an elegant white linen creation with eyelet embroidery, a high neckline, billowing sleeves, and a fitted waist.\n\nGivenchy achieved critical acclaim, with Vogue magazine praising his \u201cwonderful first collection.\u201d The New York Times magazine published an article entitled \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d l\u2019Album du Figaro also wrote a feature stating, \u201cIn one night, Hubert de Givenchy became one of fashion\u2019s most famous children with his first collection.\u201d\n\nAudrey Hepburn: the muse that changed fortunes\n\nAudrey Hepburn escalated to become one of the most influential women in his life. Presidents\u2019 wives, duchesses, and queens considered it an honor to get their dresses and accessories at Givenchy, but he created his chef\u2019s d\u2019oeuvres devoting to only Audrey.\n\nShe came to him being a young unknown American actress looking for suitable costumes for her character in the movie \u2018Sabrina.\u2019 Subsequently this movie received only one Oscar \u2013 for costumes. Later on Hubert de Givenchy confessed he considered Audrey an ideal image of the woman he wanted to create dresses for.\n\nL\u2019Interdit: the first perfume\n\nIn 1957, Givenchy launched his first perfume, \u201cL\u2019Interdit,\u201d (which means \u201cforbidden\u201d in French), dedicated to his muse Audrey as a personal scent.\n\nL\u2019Interdit is a floral fragrance that is both elegant and sensual. The fragrance\u2019s top notes include orange blossom, bergamot, and mandarin, which give it a fresh and citrusy scent. The fragrance\u2019s heart is composed of jasmine, rose, and tuberose, giving it a feminine and floral character. The fragrance\u2019s base notes include vetiver, patchouli, and musk, which add depth and complexity to the scent.\n\nDawn of the \u201clittle black dress\u201d\n\nIn 1961, Hepburn wore Givenchy\u2019s famous \u201clittle black dress\u201d and the large-brimmed hat in the film \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s,\u201d which became an iconic fashion movement and made the brand famous across the globe.\n\nIt is a simple yet chic dress with a fitted silhouette, a scoop neckline, and short sleeves.\n\nThe dress became popular in the 1950s and 1960s and has remained a classic piece of fashion ever since. It is often cited as an essential item in a woman\u2019s wardrobe due to its versatility and timeless style.\n\nThe mere mention of Audrey Hepburn brings back an image of a beautiful lady wearing a long black dress and pearls outside Tiffany\u2019s store, which can be attributed to the art that Givenchy produced.\n\nGentleman Givenchy\n\nIn 1969, Givenchy introduced their men\u2019s collection \u2013 \u201cGentleman Givenchy.\u201d\n\nIn the same year, Givenchy launched a new line of ready-to-wear clothing called \u201cGivenchy Nouvelle Boutique.\u201d This marked a significant departure from the brand\u2019s traditional haute couture focus and aimed to make high fashion more accessible to a broader audience.\n\nNow a part of the LVMH family\n\nIn 1988, Givenchy got acquired by luxury conglomerate LVMH.\n\nGivenchy spa\n\nIn 1991, a Givenchy spa was opened to bring more comfort and beauty to women\u2019s lives.\n\nBye Hubert de Givenchy, hello Galliano\n\nIn 1995, Hubert de Givenchy retired from fashion and was succeeded by British designer John Galliano, who only stayed for two seasons.\n\nThe Galliano effect\n\nIn 1996, John Galliano brought a more theatrical style with bold colors, intricate beading and embroidery, and over-the-top embellishments.\n\nHe introduced \u201cRocky Horror Picture Show\u201d inspired Fall/Winter 1996 collection, which featured avant-garde designs that were both playful and subversive. The collection included corsets, fishnet stockings, and leather jackets, all designed to push traditional fashion\u2019s boundaries.\n\nFurther, Galliano was replaced by Alexander McQueen, who also left after two seasons. One of his collection \u201cIt\u2019s a Jungle out There\u201d became famous.\n\nJulien Macdonald and intricate patterns\n\nIn 2001, American origin Julien Macdonald was introduced as a new chief designer. He was the former assistant to Givenchy. He brought a more youthful and glamorous approach to the designs during his tenure, incorporating bold patterns and high-octane embellishments, intricate embroidery, beading, metallic fabrics, and shiny sequins to create intricate patterns and textures on clothing to give them a futuristic edge.\n\nMacdonald\u2019s designs for Givenchy were often inspired by pop culture and music, with nods to rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and punk. He was known for using animal prints, leather, and feminine silhouettes to create a unique and memorable aesthetic.\n\nReincarnation of the logo\n\nThe Givenchy logo in use was created by Paul Barnes in 2003. The Givenchy logo is simplistic yet attractive. It comprises four \u2018G\u2019 alphabets coming together to create a bigger square.\n\nNightingale and Pandora\n\nIn 2005, Givenchy launched its first line of handbags, the \u201cNightingale\u201d and \u201cPandora.\u201d\n\nNew dynamism and energy with Riccardo Tisci\n\nItalian designer Riccardo Tisci was appointed as creative director until 2017. He brought a new edgy and dark aesthetic to the brand, blending high fashion and streetwear elements. Also, he introduced religious and tribal iconography, bold prints, and graphic elements, such as stars and stripes, to create a sense of dynamism and energy in his designs.\n\nTisci was also known for his collaborations with other artists and designers, such as the photographer Marina Abramovic and the streetwear brand Nike. These collaborations helped push traditional fashion\u2019s boundaries and showcase Givenchy\u2019s ability to innovate and experiment with new ideas and concepts.\n\nFirst female artistic director\n\nIn 2017, Tisci left the brand and was succeeded by Clare Waight Keller, who became Givenchy\u2019s first female artistic director.\n\nWaight Keller brought a more feminine and romantic approach to the brand\u2019s designs through elegant and sophisticated silhouettes, which she combined with intricate embroidery and delicate lace to create a romantic and ethereal aesthetic. She also incorporated elements of streetwear and sportswear into her designs, giving them a contemporary edge.\n\nWaight Keller was known for her attention to detail and her use of high-quality fabrics and materials. She often collaborated with artisans and craftspeople to create unique and one-of-a-kind pieces.\n\nAt the royal wedding\n\nIn 2018, Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, wore a Givenchy wedding dress for her wedding to Prince Harry. Clare Waight Keller, the creative director of Givenchy, designed the dress.\n\nThe dress was made from a double-bonded silk cady fabric, featuring a boat neckline and long sleeves. The silhouette was simple and elegant, with a fitted waist and a flowing train over five meters long. The veil was made of silk tulle and featured hand-embroidered flowers from all 53 Commonwealth countries.\n\nThe dress was also seen as a tribute to the minimalist aesthetic of Givenchy founder Hubert de Givenchy. It cemented the brand\u2019s reputation as a go-to for modern and sophisticated bridal wear.\n\nThe futuristic Givenchy\n\nIn 2020, Matthew M. Williams, an American designer known for his streetwear brand Alyx, was appointed as the new creative director of Givenchy.\n\nHis appointment was seen as a reflection of Givenchy\u2019s desire to appeal to a younger and more diverse audience. He has incorporated sportswear, utilitarianism, and technology elements into his designs, giving them a modern and edgy feel.\n\nWilliams has also collaborated with other designers and artists to bring new perspectives and ideas to the brand. He has worked with the artist Sterling Ruby to create a capsule collection that explores the intersection of fashion and art. He has also collaborated with the Japanese designer Yoon Ahn to create a jewelry line for the brand.\n\nConclusion\n\nGivenchy has been worn by many famous people throughout its history, including Audrey Hepburn, Jackie Kennedy, Grace Kelly, and Meghan Markle.

His family line is Venetian. The designer trained at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris.\n\nGivenchy met Hepburn during the shooting of the movie Sabrina (1953). He designed the iconic black dress that Hepburn wore in Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s (1961). She became the face of Givenchy\u2019s perfume collection.\n\nGivenchy was a disciple of Spanish couture designer Cristobal Balenciaga. Together, they set the tone for high fashion in the 1950s.

His menswear and couture collections shown together in Paris on 20 January were his last collection as a Givenchy designer. It is understood that Tisci\u2019s final designs will be seen on the red carpet \u2013 at present, gowns for the Grammy awards and the Oscars, created by Tisci with Givenchy, are being made by the atelier.\n\nTisci\u2019s replacement is still unknown, but several high-profile designers are currently on the market including Hedi Slimane, who left Saint Laurent last year, and Clare Weight Keller, who announced last week that she would be leaving Chlo\u00e9.

Photograph: David Fisher/REX/Shutterstock\n\nIt is rumoured that Tisci exited Givenchy to take up a new role at Versace. While the Italian brand\u2019s representatives declined to comment, Women\u2019s Wear Daily reported last month on speculation of talks between the designer and the brand. Tisci, who was born in northern Italy, is friends with Donatella Versace and \u2013 in a move that puzzled some insiders \u2013 cast her in a Givenchy campaign in 2015. At the time of the campaign, Versace commented: \u201cRiccardo Tisci is extremely talented and, above all, my dear friend. We are family. I want to get rid of the old system, work together, support each other and make fashion a true global community.\u201d\n\nThe Tisci reign was lucrative for Givenchy, which is owned by the LVMH luxury conglomerate. It is thought that the house expanded sixfold during the time he was the designer, with employees rising from 290 in 2005 to more than 930 now.\n\nBernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH, said in a statement: \u201cThe chapter Riccardo Tisci has written with the house of Givenchy over the last 12 years represents an incredible vision to sustain its continuous success, and I would like to warmly thank him for his core contribution to the house\u2019s development.\u201d Tisci\u2019s comments gave nothing away: \u201cI want to thank the LVMH group and monsieur Bernard Arnault for giving me the platform to express my creativity over the years.

Photograph: Etienne Laurent/EPA\n\nDuring his time at Givenchy, Tisci revived the house for a new generation of luxury consumers. He injected streetwear into a house that previously (whether under its founder Hubert de Givenchy or other designers including Alexander McQueen or Julian McDonald) had glamour at its heart.\n\nIf, once, Givenchy\u2019s heyday was seen to be Audrey Hepburn dressed by Hubert in the 1960s, Tisci \u2013 well-known as a hip-hop fan \u2013 rewrote the script by adding gritty street culture elements far from the rarified world that Hepburn had known.\n\nDuring his tenure, Tisci introduced a gothic feel (autumn/winter 2012) to an aesthetic influenced by the Mexican subculture chola, with styling that resembled singer FKA Twigs (autumn/winter 2015). His menswear collection, which he started at Givenchy in 2008, became a highlight, with collections influenced by basketball, the American flag and graffiti. His rottweiler T-shirts, for autumn/winter 2012, became a cult item.\n\nDonatella Versace in the Givenchy 2015 ad campaign.

He was one of the first designers to cast a transgender model: Lea T appeared in the autumn/winter 2010 Givenchy campaign. Tisci is democratic in his muses, being one of the first designers to embrace reality TV star Kim Kardashian, following a friendship with her husband Kanye West. He designed Kardashian\u2019s wedding dress when the couple were married in 2015.\n\nAccording to sources, his departure is effective as of 31 January following the expiration of his employment agreement."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/14/interview-burberry-designer-riccardo-tisci", "page_content": "On the evening I interview Burberry\u2019s chief creative officer Riccardo Tisci, London has an atmosphere close to boiling point. A stone\u2019s throw away from the brand\u2019s HQ, Boris Johnson has just entered 10 Downing Street for the first time, to jeers from protesters. Anti-Brexit demonstrators roam Parliament Square. Commuters on their way home try to manage the late July heatwave, some with ice lollies, others with pints. Some have given up entirely and are just sitting on the pavement, totally frazzled.\n\nFrazzled is not a word that gets much use at the top of Burberry Towers. The rooftop is all members\u2019 club discretion \u2013 bleached wood furniture, bowls of gigantic roses and perfectly chilled, iced sparkling water. The designer has specified this location, where some might have suggested their office, maybe, or a carefully chosen buzzy restaurant. If Burberry is a brand based on a very British weather system of cloudy with a chance of rain, Tisci is different. Born near Lake Como in Italy, he\u2019s accustomed to sunshine.\n\nThis becomes clear when he sits down and launches into his summer plans. \u201cI am going to Como to celebrate my birthday,\u201d he says. \u201cThen Mykonos\u2026 Me and all best friends who live in different countries, we meet there in August. A nice villa in the middle of nowhere\u2026 I love it. If you want to go and eat fish, you go and eat fish; if you want to sleep, you sleep; or if you want to get drunk all together \u2013 it\u2019s nice. The sea, the food, the fish, the tomatoes, everything.\u201d These words tumble out of Tisci\u2019s mouth, and he finishes with a grin, and a sip of the iced coffee he arrived with. Anyone after more of this scenario would do well to join 2.5m others and follow Tisci on Instagram. This year\u2019s destinations include a boat in Ibiza (he is pictured topless, wetsuit pulled down to his waist) and New York for Pride (surrounded by friends, all in hotpants). Or look up his 40th birthday in Ibiza \u2013 a decadent affair with Kate Moss, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner and Naomi Campbell attending.\n\n\u2018When you do well for yourself in France you get the Chanel bag, in England you get the Burberry trench\u2019.

He carries a Burberry bumbag with a packet of American Spirit peeking out. If you didn\u2019t know he was a designer, you might think he worked in the music industry.\n\nThis look signals that Tisci is a departure for Burberry. Google Image Christopher Bailey, the previous chief creative officer for 17 years, and you\u2019ll see what I mean. Bailey is much more a crisp shirt and occasional blazer kind of man, the uniform of the discreetly wealthy. Bailey\u2019s collections reflected this taste, too. They often came with a blue-chip British bookish reference \u2013 the Bloomsbury group, say, or David Hockney \u2013 and a BBC Radio 6 Music-approved sound: Paloma Faith, Keane, Jake Bugg. Samantha Cameron and Kate Middleton wore the clothes.\n\nAnd Bailey\u2019s Burberry was successful. Thanks to him, the brand is now Proper Fashion, with the London fashion week show a hot ticket every season. But Bailey\u2019s Burberry was not really cool. Tisci, by contrast, is one of fashion\u2019s current arbiters of that intangible quality. Previously the creative director of Givenchy for 12 years, he designed the wedding outfits for his good friends Kanye and Kim, and has a long-running collaboration with Nike. Madonna, Frank Ocean and Marina Abramovi\u0107 are part of his friendship group (he bought a house with the artist). Since Tisci joined Burberry last year, the brand has worked with MIA (even persuading the edgy musician to appear in the slightly cheesy format of a Christmas advert) and dressed Gen Z favourites Ariana Grande, Rihanna and Gigi Hadid. Such is Tisci\u2019s influence that model Freja Beha Erichsen \u2013 who is Kind of a Big Deal in fashion, with 24 Vogue covers to her name and a starring role in Burberry\u2019s autumn ad campaign \u2013 rejigged her schedule to be part of this shoot.\n\nRiccardo Tisci with his good friends Kanye West and Madonna. Photograph: Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nAt Givenchy, Tisci turned a couture relic most associated with Audrey Hepburn\u2019s LBDs into the height of millennial cool \u2013 specifically appealing to the hypebeast demographic who might also wear streetwear labels Supreme and Palace. Originally known for his gothic aesthetic, streetwear started appearing on the catwalk around 2011. Hypebeasts swiftly signed up \u2013 they loved the T-shirts with a snarling rottweiler print, the basketball vests, the plaid shirt with studs. And at around \u00a3360 for one of those T-shirts, they were within reach \u2013 more affordable than a four-figure gown, anyway. This was part of the strategy \u2013 that, and his duties as a good uncle. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go home for Christmas and have my sisters\u2019 kids say, \u2018It\u2019s beautiful, what you do, but I can\u2019t afford it,\u2019\u201d Tisci explains. \u201cThat killed me. I wanted them to come to me and say, \u2018I have been saving money to buy the Bambi T-shirt.\u2019\n\n\u201c[At first], nobody was caring about it. Slowly but slowly, it was selling, selling, getting bigger,\u201d Tisci continues. \u201c[Then] everybody wants a piece and everybody starts doing it. I don\u2019t mind it because whenever the younger generation talk about that, they always mention my name.\u201d Tisci\u2019s success meant high street brands started producing their own take. You might not know his name but he is the reason you have a statement sweatshirt, the reason the phrase \u201cposh tracksuit trousers\u201d is not an oxymoron.\n\nReworking the check. Tisci\u2019s Burberry designs bring the classic to the radar of a new generation.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that Tisci is intrigued by a part of Burberry\u2019s history that was, until now, a touchy subject: its association with \u201cchav\u201d culture. In 2002, actor Danniella Westbrook was snapped in a Burberry check skirt with matching handbag. Her daughter wore a matching kilt, and sat in a Burberry check pushchair. The label was also spotted on football terraces. By being associated with the working-classes, the luxury brand was seen as losing its way. While check had already been reintroduced by Bailey, with a 2018 collaboration with streetwear designer Gosha Rubchinskiy, Tisci has reassessed the idea of \u201cchav\u201d. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t say it, but last season it was a little bit the inspiration,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it is great because I come from the streets.\u201d The AW collection, entitled Tempest, included streetwear, sophisticated classics and that oh-so-familiar check, reworked with a darker khaki and the punchy graphics that Tisci fans flock to.\n\nDesigners from humble backgrounds are nothing new \u2013 Alexander McQueen, Vivienne Westwood, Bailey himself - but Tisci has a genuine rags to riches story. Born in 1974, he grew up the youngest child \u2013 and only boy \u2013 of nine children. He wore his sisters\u2019 pink hand-me-downs to school. His father died when Tisci was four and the siblings had to work to keep the family afloat. He has spoken before about one meal a day being the norm, how he was helping his uncle with plastering from the age of 11. It\u2019s all a long way from rooftops with a view of the Houses of Parliament.\n\nTisci\u2019s unlikely success is, he says, down to \u201cangels I have crossed in my life\u201d. The first arrived when he stopped attending primary school. \u201cThe teachers came to my house, Miss Besio and Mr Borriero. They said to my mum, \u2018Your son needs to study because he has something different to all the other children.\u2019\u201d Tisci stayed in school. This continued in London \u2013 on an internship, fellow designer Antonio Berardi saw his illustrations and sent Tisci to renowned fashion college Central Saint Martins. While there, tutor Willie Walters ensured he received a grant so he was able to study. Tisci was made creative director of Givenchy in 2005, aged 29. \u201cI am a self-made person,\u201d he says now, with a drag of an American Spirit. \u201cMy mum gave me love but that is the only thing she gave me.\u201d (Tisci is prone to these telenovela-ish soundbites, which is understandable when you find out he has a story worthy of a box set.)\n\nRihanna wears a Burberry trench on stage at a Fenty Beauty event. Photograph: Mark Ganzon/Getty\n\nTisci sees a kindred spirit in Thomas Burberry, who started the eponymous brand in 1856, at the age of 21, in the far from fashionable environs of Basingstoke. He invented gabardine, the waterproof fabric that went on to be used for the trenchcoat, in 1879. Adopted by explorers and intrepid types including Ernest Shackleton and Betty Kirby-Green, Burberry trenches were worn in the trenches in the first world war. By 1965, it\u2019s said that one in every five coats exported from the UK was made by Burberry. These days, the brand employs around 10,000 people and is the only luxury fashion brand in the FTSE 100. It also looms large in British style. In the time I have been working on this interview, I have seen Tisci-designed Burberry tote bags on the tube, the check on a woman\u2019s scarf in the supermarket, a trench, with rolled-up check sleeves, in a cocktail bar.\n\nTisci says Thomas is central to his reworking of Burberry, so much so that he changed the Burberry logo \u2013 with the help of Peter Saville \u2013 to feature the founder\u2019s initials. \u201cThe company should still be an institution but at the same time we need to have the perception of human,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a business company.\u201d That may seem a bit soppy to any board members reading this, but his nose for hits is well-known \u2013 Burberry\u2019s share price went up 5% when his appointment was announced. There\u2019s still work to do, though: even after a 4% rise in sales, analysts at the Bernstein Group downgraded Burberry to \u201cunderperform\u201d in August.\n\nTisci\u2019s track record for courting millennials suggests this is just a blip. He\u2019s started Burberry\u2019s B Series which plays into the \u201cdrop\u201d culture of streetwear \u2013 a new product is released on the 17th of each month (August\u2019s was a dog hoodie, personalisable with the lucky pooch\u2019s name), and reliably sells out in minutes. Another addition is T-shirts, scarves and bags covered in unicorns. If that sounds like a cynical ploy to appeal to fans of emojis and pool inflatables, the story has the authenticity this cohort highly prizes. A search of the archive revealed an alternative insignia from the brand\u2019s famous knight \u2013 a unicorn, designed by Burberry for his family. \u201cIn the day it was a horse, in the night it became a unicorn,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cI thought it was a very beautiful thing. In a way, it\u2019s very relatable to what happened in my life\u2026 My sisters were like Thomas Burberry. During the day, they have to be strong warriors, but in the night they would take off all this armour and be very sweet mothers to me.\u201d\n\nFamily comes first for Tisci. He remains very close to his mother, who is now 90. His formative experiences of fashion came from watching his eight sisters \u2013 who, he says, are four pairs of best friends \u2013 get ready to go out, when he was a child. \u201cThey would be in the bathroom, putting makeup on. I was sitting on the bathtub thinking, one day I can go out and meet the people around the world.\u201d\n\nTisci has said before that he took the Givenchy job so he could buy his mother a house. His break with the brand was also prompted by family \u2013 at the funeral of his brother-in-law in 2016, he realised his mother was getting older, his nieces and nephews were growing up. And he wanted in. \u201cI wanted to be the son of my mother, the brother of my sister, that I have never been really because life never gave me the opportunity,\u201d he says. He quit Givenchy the following spring. The announcement went out while he was in a desert in Algeria, with his phone switched off.\n\nSitting back. Model Freja Beha Erichsen wearing Burberry. Photograph: Shaniqwa Jarvis/The Guardian\n\nThe next year was low-key. He had, he says, \u201cno agenda\u201d. \u201cLike anyone when you are busy, you have a PA, a PR,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes you want to go to buy your toothpaste, you want to discover what is the new cream for your skin, not always have somebody going for you.\u201d He slept a lot and he travelled, going to Portugal with his family and backpacking around Costa Rica. That is, until Burberry called. Tisci was brought back to fashion by the man who brought him into it in the first place \u2013 Marco Gobbetti, now CEO of Burberry (with an annual salary of \u00a37.3m, as was recently revealed), but then at Givenchy. \u201cMarco is the person who saved my career and gave me the opportunity to be who I am today,\u201d Tisci says, with that frisson of drama. The trench was also enticing. \u201cWhen you behave well at school, in France you get the Chanel bag,\u201d he says. \u201cIn England you get the Burberry trench. It\u2019s something I discovered here. Adele told me the first thing she bought when her first single came out was a Burberry trench.\u201d Tisci\u2019s first collection for Burberry featured 20 trenches.\n\nBut will the perception of a brand \u2013 and an item \u2013 so associated with Britishness change post-Brexit? \u201cBritish is not my culture but I am representing a very important British house,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cFor me to celebrate Britishness and bring it to America, China, it\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\nI would guess Tisci was Remain \u2013 inclusivity and diversity are his MO. He championed casting people of colour well before the rest of fashion woke up to the idea. He also cast his friend Lea T, a trans woman, in an ad campaign in 2010, helping her financially and opening the door to models such as Hari Nef, Andreja Pejic and Nathan Westling. \u201cI got so much shit. You cannot imagine,\u201d he says. \u201cThank God we had people like Oprah Winfrey who said, \u2018Stop a second, he is doing something that is right.\u2019 When somebody more powerful says something, it changes.\u201d Family Tisci were a support network, too. \u201cWhen she [Lea T] decided to become a woman and her family didn\u2019t accept her, my mum took her to our house and she lived with us,\u201d he says. \u201cShe treated Lea as a daughter. Lea still says, \u2018Your mum is the first person to call me she, not he.\u2019\u201d\n\nTisci is definitely an ally to a socially aware generation (Burberry\u2019s policy of burning clothes and its use of fur ended soon after he joined). But he doesn\u2019t always get it right. There was a skirmish after the autumn show when model Liz Kennedy compared the fastening on a hoodie to a noose on social media. \u201cSuicide is not fashion,\u201d she wrote. \u201cRiccardo Tisci and everyone at Burberry it is beyond me how you could let a look resembling a noose hanging from a neck out on the runway.\u201d While other brands have seen items that cause offence reach stores \u2013 both Gucci and Prada have had scandals around designs with racist imagery \u2013 this was swiftly shut down. In a statement, Tisci said, \u201cIt does not reflect my values nor Burberry\u2019s and we have removed it from the collection.\u201d\n\nThe good ship Burberry: Tisci brings a twist to Burberry\u2019s heritage with graphic prints and a new logo. Photograph: Shaniqwa Jarvis/The Guardian\n\nWhile Tisci says he isn\u2019t a political person, he does concede he has a platform. \u201cIf it\u2019s to fight for rights, to help people, I am the first one,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it\u2019s about going to sit at a table and talk about money, numbers and power, that is, like you say here, not my cup of tea.\u201d\n\nNow back in London for over a year, Tisci lives in Mayfair (he did consider Marylebone, where his friend Madonna has a house), trains every day in a local gym and watches what he eats. Then, once in a while, he lets himself go. Tisci has gone to raves, festivals \u2013 \u201cI never thought I would be a festival person\u201d \u2013 and gigs: Rosal\u00eda, the buzzy Spanish singer, Bj\u00f6rk, Primal Scream. The evening we speak, he is having drinks with singer Dua Lipa. Next up, his birthday, celebrated quietly with family. I\u2019m not taking his word for it \u2013 it\u2019s all documented on Instagram a few days later.

His Fall-Winter 2017 menswear collection and Spring couture collection\u2014shown together last month in Paris\u2014will be his last. According to WWD, the split is amicable and came at the end of his existing contract.\n\nTisci's tenure at the house was the perfect storm of creativity and commercial viability, and he delivered collections that were often dark and brooding and undeniably luxe, but that yielded pieces guaranteed to sell out as soon as they hit shop floors. His string of highly identifiable hits, including his infamous animal tees (sharks and Rottweilers chief among them), his Madonna-and-child\u2013printed sweatshirts and T-shirts, his razor-cut suits that instantly gave any man a sharp silhouette, his fashion shows that mixed models with \"regular\" street-cast people, and, of course, his putting Kanye in a kilt. His work has been consistent street-style fodder.\n\nAdditionally, Tisci was one of the first designers at a high-end label to embrace and appropriate streetwear, a movement that's had a lasting effect. Tisci's celebrity fans include Kanye West, David Beckham, Victor Cruz, and Justin Bieber, to name a few. In one of the most publicized coups of his tenure at the brand, Tisci designed both Kim Kardashian's dress and Kanye West's tuxedo for their 2014 wedding ceremony. \"When I started at Givenchy, I was bored with fashion for men,\" Tisci told us in 2012. \"Street culture? They don\u2019t care. They don\u2019t give a shit. They wear what they want. Bermuda, big and small. T-shirt oversize or T-shirt tiny. Prints. Bombers.\"\n\nRumor has it that Tisci will head to Versace, though there is no confirmation as of yet. The designer has had a long relationship with the house's current designer, Donatella Versace, even going so far as to cast her in a recent ad campaign. \"It\u2019s not that I invented hot water,\" he explained to us of his creative process and popularity. \"It\u2019s just, I\u2019m very honest with my style and with what people want in the street.\"\n\nUp Next: Behind-the-Scenes with Kanye West"}, {"url": "https://graziamagazine.com/articles/riccardo-tisci-givenchy-best-artistic-collaborators/", "page_content": "\n\nThe Givenchy Spring Summer 2016 show was art directed by Tisci\u2019s close collaborator, Marina Abramovi\u0107\n\nCredit: Victor Virgile/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s likely that, when reflecting on the defining characteristics of his incredible 12-year tenure at Givenchy, people will recall the connections that Riccardo Tisci made with others as readily as they will his breathtaking takes on haute couture and ready-to-wear.\n\nAmongst his contemporaries, the well-connected designer was an early champion of diversity and often unconventional beauty, assembling what he called a \u2018gang\u2019 that included transgender model and muse Lea T, Naomi Campbell, Joan Smalls, as well as the musicians ANOHNI and Li Yuchun, amongst others. Tisci was also quick to align himself with celebrities of an ilk that many at the time wouldn\u2019t dream of associating with, creating moments that would guarantee his place in the firmament of fashion and culture.\n\nAnd while his high-profile collaborations \u2013 Nike, Beyonc\u00e9, Madonna, Kanye West and Jay Z \u2013 garnered the Italian designer a great deal of popular acclaim, his many endeavours into other, more quiet creative realms suggested Tisci was interested in much more than high wattage moments.\n\nBelow, revisit five of Riccardo Tisci\u2019s most memorable artistic collaborations over the course of his time at Givenchy.\n\nMarina Abramovic\n\nOn occasion of his tenth year at Givenchy in 2015, Tisci decamped to New York\u2019s Pier 26 to present his women\u2019s spring/summer 2016 collection on the anniversary of 9/11 in the shadow of the Freedom Tower.\n\nTisci\u2019s black-and-white show was art directed by the controversial performance artist Marina Abramovic, who stationed silent performers throughout the show, which for the first time was also open to the public. Their austere performances and Tisci\u2019s universally praised collection of couture-worthy looks proved to be a fitting tribute to the city and an industry that had so warmly embraced him over the course of the last decade.\n\nTisci and Abramobic\u2019s relationship was also the focus of a great deal many more memorable moments during his time at Givenchy. The designer enlisted the artist to feature in his guest-edited \u2018Religion\u2019 edition of Visionaire in 2011, which featured a Piet\u00e0 style image of Ambramovic and Tisci \u2013 the designer posing as if breastfeeding from the artist.\n\nIn a much more subdued image, Abramovic also starred in the brand\u2019s Spring/Summer 2013 advertising campaign, shot by Tisci\u2019s good friends, Mert & Marcus.\n\n\n\nPerformers overlook the runway at the Givenchy Spring Summer 2016 fashion show during New York Fashion Week on September 11, 2015\n\nCredit: Catwalking/Getty Images\n\nKehinde Wiley\n\nFor An Economy of Grace, Kehinde Wiley\u2019s first body of work dedicated to all female subjects, the artist asked Tisci to create custom-made couture gowns for each of his street cast models.\n\nPosed in a manner that replicated the historical portraits of society women seen by the artist at the Louvre by artists like Jacques-Louis David, Thomas Gainsborough and John Singer Sargent, among others, the women ranged from Rikers Island prison guards to teen mothers. It was the artist\u2019s intention to create \u201ca rightful place for them within art history, which has to date been an almost exclusively white domain.\u201d\n\n\n\nA work from Kehinde Wiley\u2019s An Economy of Grace, The Two Sisters, 2012, oil on linen, 96\u2033 x 72\u2033\n\nCredit: Courtesy of the artist\n\nBenjamin Shine\n\nIn 2013, Tisci created a line of sweatshirts with the British-born, Canberra-based artist Benjamin Shine, featuring the kind of Madonna-and-Child iconography informed by Tisci\u2019s strict Catholic upbringing that the designer so heavily drew on for his collections \u2013 only this time rendered in the artist\u2019s signature tulle formations.\n\nThe following year, Tisci created the first instalment of what would become an ongoing and extremely popular collaboration with Nike, drawing on another reliable component of his design oeuvre \u2013 think Fall 2013\u2019s now iconic Bambi sweatshirts and the seasonal variations that have followed.\n\nShine\u2019s collaboration with Tisci also paved the way for his incredible collaboration with John Galliano and Maison Margiela\u2019s most recent Artisanal collection.\n\n\n\nCredit: Courtesy of the artist/Givenchy\n\nPaul Veroude\n\nRumours of Tisci\u2019s departure from Givenchy have been percolating for years. It was at the time that he showed his Spring 2015 Menswear collection that they reached a fever pitch, the intimation being that he was Gucci-bound (Frida Giannini presented what would be her final menswear collection for Gucci the week prior).\n\nIt was in Paris that week, however, that Tisci would issue something of a statement to the contrary.\n\nIn a vast hanger, Tisci\u2019s models circled a deconstructed Cessna that had been \u201cexploded\u201d by the Dutch artist Paul Veroude, whose work celebrates the power of machinery through the process of deconstruction. The almost anatomical, worshipful diagram was also something of a cipher for Tisci\u2019s pious sartorial precision and devotion to his craft.\n\n\n\nAt the Spring 2015 Givenchy menswear show, Dutch sculptor Paul Veroude deconstructed a Cessna for an installation commissioned by the house\n\nCredit: Michel Dufour/Wireimage\n\nM/M Paris\n\nA more surreptitious, though nonetheless significant, collaboration has been the one Tisci has enjoyed with M/M Paris, the creative consultancy helmed by Michael Amzalag and Mathias Augustyniak.\n\nThe acclaimed design duo designed all of Tisci\u2019s show invitations for the house for the duration of his tenure at Givenchy and in 2013, in occasion of their 20th anniversary, Amzalag and Augustyniak released The Givenchy Files to celebrate their ongoing collaboration: a hardback, limited edition tome amassing their always memorable designs for the Parisian house.\n\n\n\n\u201cCelebration\u201d: M/M Paris\u2019s invitation for Riccardo Tisci\u2019s 10th anniversary show, featuring a likeness of Tisci\u2019s chief muse, Italian supermodel Mariacarla Boscono\n\nCredit: M/M Paris/Instagram\n\nTile image: Catwalking/Getty Images\n\nCover image: Courtesy of Benjamin Shine/Givenchy"}]}
