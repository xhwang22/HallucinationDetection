{"Philip of France was a patron of the University of Paris.": [{"url": "https://www.sorbonne.fr/en/the-sorbonne/history-of-the-sorbonne/la-fondation-de-la-sorbonne-au-moyen-age-par-le-theologien-robert-de-sorbon/", "page_content": "The fact that Paris asserted itself as the capital of France was made possible by the development and reputation of the University of Paris, which came into being during the 12th century as a result of the continuous growth of the Parisian schools that were grouped together on the hill called the Montagne Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve. These schools provided instruction at three levels: Baccalaur\u00e9at (grammar, dialectics, rhetoric), Licence (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music) and Doctorate (medicine, canon law, theology).\n\nThis success soon made it necessary to adopt, at the beginning of the 13thcentury, an organised structure. Consequently, King Philippe Auguste decided to provide the teachers and students with suitable living conditions and to guarantee with diplomas the quality of their education, which was then becoming a new means of social mobility. So the schools\u2019 organisation system was redefined in accordance with two major principles. The first one was the grouping together of teachers and students in a community called universitas that was governed by statutes setting out the rules of communal life within a shared system of education. The second principle was that of self-government, which was guaranteed in the early part of the 13th century by three official texts: in 1200, a diploma by Philippe Auguste; in 1215, a confirmation by the papal legate; in 1231, the papal bull entitled ParensScientarium by Pope Gregory IX.\n\nThus, the university became a legal entity, benefited from privileges and acquired a seal bearing the inscription: \u201cUniversitatis magistorum et scolarium parisiensium\u201d. It was also in the 1240s that the first mentions were made of a rector, a Master of Arts (ma\u00eetre-\u00e8s-arts) elected head of the university by his peers.\n\nIn the following years, the students formed four \u201cnations\u201d depending on where they came from: French, Norman, Picard and English. As for the schools, they came together to form \u201cfaculties\u201d: liberal arts, medicine, canon law and, above all, theology \u2013 the most important science of all, it was believed. While there may not be any reliable statistics, it is certain that hundreds of teachers and thousands of students attended the Parisian schools at that time.\n\nAs early as the 13th century, the university community was European. The shared teaching model and command of Latin made exchanges easier. Teachers were called on to give lessons all over Europe and were often accompanied by their students. Thisperegrinatio academica (academic mobility) made possible the construction in Europe of the knowledge upon which the Christian West is founded. For example, the University of Paris played host to the Swabian theologian Albert the Great and then to his Italian disciple, Thomas Aquinas, who was one of the leading lights in theologian and humanist thought in Europe.\n\nThe \u201cpoor students\u201d received full board in colleges founded by generous donors. The Sorbonne takes its name from a college created in 1253 by Robert de Sorbon, the chaplain and confessor of the then king, Saint Louis, who confirmed its foundation in 1257. Thanks to a royal donation, the school was established in a backstreet called the Rue Coupe-Gueule (\u201cCut-Face Street\u201d) on the northern side of the Montagne Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve. This street later became the Rue de la Sorbonne.\n\nLike in the other colleges, the teachers and students formed a secular religious community. Living off their own private income, they could devote themselves to attending and giving free lessons that enabled pupils from all social categories to benefit from this instruction. Merely twenty or so at the beginning, then only around thirty later, the number of the so-called socii was never greater than that throughout the Middle Ages. To this must be added a varying number \u2013 maybe a hundred or so permanently \u2013 of paying \u201cguests\u201d and \u201creaders\u201d that were allowed to use the library.\n\nAccommodating rich and poor, irrespective of family or geographical background, and using criteria of intellectual excellence, the Coll\u00e8ge de Sorbon soon made a name for itself as an elite school. Equality, Collegiality, Morality, Studies \u2013 these were the college\u2019s rules and they are repeated in the famous Latin motto: \u201cVivere socialiter et collegialiter et moraliter et scholariter\u201d. Even though theology was also taught in many convents, the Coll\u00e8ge de Sorbon became one of the principle colleges of the Faculty of Theology, along with theColl\u00e8ge de Navarre, the Coll\u00e8ge du Cardinal Lemoine and the Coll\u00e8ge des Cholets. For a long time, however, these colleges remained places where one could simply study and be accommodated and it was not until the 16th century that the Sorbonne acquired professorships.\n\nBy the end of the Middle Ages, the University of Paris had become the biggest cultural and scientific centre in Europe, attracting some 20,000 students. It owed its reputation to the prestige of its teachers but also to its libraries the quality of which was equalled only by the papal library. The University of Paris was the cradle of the \u201csecond French humanism\u201d in the 15th century and it was in the Sorbonne in 1469 that the first printing press in France was installed by King Louis XI\u2019s librarian, Guillaume Fichet, and by the college prior, Jean Heynlin."}, {"url": "https://brewminate.com/a-history-of-the-medieval-university-of-paris/", "page_content": "The historic University of Paris first appeared in the second half of the twelfth century.\n\nCurated/Reviewed by Matthew A. McIntosh\n\nPublic Historian\n\nBrewminate\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe historic University of Paris (French: Universit\u00e9 de Paris) first appeared in the second half of the twelfth century, but was in 1970 reorganized as 13 autonomous universities (University of Paris I\u2013XIII). The university is often referred to as the Sorbonne or La Sorbonne after the collegiate institution (Coll\u00e8ge de Sorbonne) founded in 1257 by Robert de Sorbon, but the university as such was older and was never completely centered on the Sorbonne. Of the thirteen current successor universities, four have a presence in the historical Sorbonne building, and three include \u201cSorbonne\u201d in their names.\n\nMain buildings of the University of Paris I Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne, former Faculty of Law and Economics of the University of Paris. Place du Panth\u00e9on, Paris / Photo by Marie-Lan Nguyen, Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe original university had four faculties: Arts, Medicine, Law, and Theology. \u201cThe students there were divided into four nationes according to language or regional origin. This faculty and nation system of the University of Paris (along with that of the University of Bologna) became the model for all later medieval universities in Europe.\u201d- says Kennith Fletcher, editor from write my college essay company. Remarkable for its teaching, the University of Paris also played an important role in both religious and political affairs in France. However, with the French Revolution the ancient University of Paris was swept away along with the Ancien R\u00e9gime,becoming part of the University of France. Reestablished in 1886, without its faculty of theology and with the addition of new faculties such as science, the university became secular. Still it again became a preeminent academic center, not just of France but of Europe as a whole in the mid-twentieth century.\n\nAfter the protests of 1968, which the University was significantly involved in, however, the French higher education system was again reformed, and the University of Paris was separated into 13 universities. Thus, despite their historical ties and some administrative functions of the Acad\u00e9mie of Paris with offices in the Sorbonne, there is currently no University of Paris system that binds the universities at an academic level. Yet, the ideal of the University of Paris, the archetype of so many significant universities and the center of such historical intellectual development, continues to inspire and inform many. For although reform, such as that invoked by the French Revolution, has often been necessary in history to remove corrupt and outdated institutions, the wisdom and spirit of their founders is often of eternal value to humankind.\n\nThe Sorbonne, Paris, in a seventeenth century engraving / Wikimedia Commons\n\nSimilar to the other early medieval universities (University of Bologna, University of Oxford), but unlike later ones (such as the University of Prague or the University of Heidelberg), the University of Paris was only later established through a specific foundation act (such as a royal charter or papal bull). The university grew up in the latter part of the twelfth century around the Notre Dame Cathedral as a corporation similar to other medieval corporations, such as guilds of merchants or artisans. In fact, the medieval Latin term universitas actually had the more general meaning of a guild, and the university of Paris was known as a universitas magistrorum et scholarium (a guild of masters and scholars).\n\nThe university had four faculties: Arts, Medicine, Law, and Theology. The faculty of Arts was the lowest in rank, but also the largest as students had to graduate from there to be admitted to one of the higher faculties. The students there were divided into four nationes according to language or regional origin, those of France, Normandy, Picard, and England, the last one of which later came to be known as the Alemannian (German) nation. Recruitment to each nation was wider than the names might imply: the English-German nation in fact included students from Scandinavia and Eastern Europe. The faculty and nation system of the University of Paris (along with that of the University of Bologna) became the model for all later medieval universities.\n\nThe Original Schools\n\nThree schools were especially famous at Paris, the palatine or palace school, the school of Notre-Dame, and that of Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve. The decline of royalty inevitably brought about the decline of the first. The other two, which were very old, like those of the cathedrals and the abbeys, were only faintly outlined during the early centuries of their existence. The glory of the palatine school doubtless eclipsed theirs, until in the course of time it completely gave way to them.\n\nThe first renowned professor at the school of Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve was Hubold, who lived in the tenth century. Not content with the courses at Li\u00e8ge, he continued his studies at Paris, entered or allied himself with the chapter of Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve, and attracted many pupils via his teaching. Distinguished professors from the school of Notre-Dame in the eleventh century include Lambert, disciple of Filbert of Chartres; Drogo of Paris; Manegold of Germany; Anselm of Laon. These two schools attracted scholars from every country and produced many illustrious men, among whom were: Saint Stanislaus of Szczepan\u00f3w, Bishop of Krak\u00f3w; Gebbard, Archbishop of Salzburg; St. Stephen, third Abbot of C\u00eeteaux; and Robert d\u2019Arbrissel, founder of the Abbey of Fontevrault. Three other men who added esteem to the schools of Notre-Dame and Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve were William of Champeaux, Peter Abelard, and Peter Lombard.\n\nHugo of St-Victor / Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe school of St-Victor then arose to rival those of Notre-Dame and Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve. It was founded by William of Champeaux when he withdrew to the Abbey of St-Victor. Its most famous professors are Hugh of St-Victor and Richard of St-Victor.\n\nOriginally instruction comprised grammar, rhetoric, dialectics, arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy (trivium and quadrivium). To the higher instruction belonged dogmatic and moral theology, whose source was the Scriptures and the Fathers, and which was completed by the study of Canon law. The plan of studies expanded in the schools of Paris, as it did elsewhere. A Bolognese compendium of canon law called the \u201cDecretum Gratiani\u201d brought about a division of the theology department. Hitherto the discipline of the Church had not been separate from so-called theology; they were studied together under the same professor. But this vast collection necessitated a special course, which was naturally undertaken first at Bologna, where Roman law was taught. In France, first Orl\u00e9ans and then Paris erected chairs of canon law. Before the end of the twelfth century, the Decretals of Gerard (or Girard) La Pucelle, Mathieu d\u2019Angers, and Anselm (or Anselle) of Paris, were added to the Decretum Gratiani. However, civil law was not included at Paris.\n\nIn the course of the twelfth century, medicine also began to be publicly taught at Paris: the first professor of medicine in Paris records is Hugo, physicus excellens qui quadrivium docuit.\n\nTwo things were necessary to be a professor: knowledge and appointment. Knowledge was proved by examination, the appointment came from the examiner himself, who was the head of the school, and was known as scholasticus, capiscol, and eventually as \u201cchancellor.\u201d This appointment was called the license to teach. The license had to be granted freely. No one could teach without it; on the other hand, it could not be refused when the applicant deserved it.\n\nThe School of St-Victor, which shared the obligations as well as the immunities of the abbey, conferred the license in its own right; the school of Notre-Dame depended on the diocese, that of Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve on the abbey or chapter. The diocese and the abbey or chapter, through their chancellor, gave professorial investiture in their respective territories where they had jurisdiction.\n\nBesides Notre-Dame, Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve, and St-Victor, there were several schools on the \u201cIsland\u201d and on the \u201cMount.\u201d \u201cWhoever,\u201d says Crevier \u201chad the right to teach might open a school where he pleased, provided it was not in the vicinity of a principal school.\u201d Thus a certain Adam, who was of English origin, kept his \u201cnear the Petit Pont\u201d; another Adam, Parisian by birth, \u201ctaught at the Grand Pont which is called the Pont-au-Change\u201d (Tuilier, 1997 vol. I, 272).\n\nMeeting of doctors at the university of Paris. From a medieval manuscript / Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe number of students in the school of the capital grew constantly, so that eventually the lodgings were insufficient. French students included princes of the blood, sons of the nobility, and the most distinguished youths of the kingdom. The courses at Paris were considered so necessary as a completion of studies that many foreigners flocked to them. Popes Celestine II, Adrian IV, and Innocent III studied at Paris, and Alexander III sent his nephews there. Illustrious German and British students included Otto of Freisingen, Cardinal Conrad, Archbishop of Mainz, St. Thomas of Canterbury, and John of Salisbury; while Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve became practically the seminary for Denmark. The chroniclers of the time call Paris the city of letters par excellence, placing it above Athens, Alexandria, Rome, and other cities. Poets said the same thing in their verses, and they compared it to all that was greatest, noblest, and most valuable in the world.\n\nThe three schools of Notre-Dame, Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve, and St-Victor may be regarded as the triple cradle of the Universitas scholarium, which included masters and students; hence the name University.\n\nOrganization in the Thirteenth Century\n\nIn 1200, King Philip II issued a diploma \u201cfor the security of the scholars of Paris\u201d that made the students subject only to ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The provost and other officers were forbidden to arrest a student for any offense, unless this was done to hand over the culprit to ecclesiastical authority. The king\u2019s officers could never lay hands on the head of the schools unless they had a mandate from an ecclesiastical authority.\n\nIn 1215, the statues of the Apostolic legate, Robert de Cour\u00e7on, dealt with three principal points regarding the moral and intellectual part of university instruction: the conditions of the professorate, the matter to be treated, and the granting of the license. To teach the arts it was necessary to have reached the age of twenty-one, after having studied these arts at least six years, and to take an engagement as professor for at least two years. For a chair in theology the candidate had to be thirty years of age with eight years of theological studies, of which the last three years were devoted to special courses of lectures in preparation for the mastership. Lastly, purity of morals was as important as reading. Priscian\u2019s \u201cGrammar,\u201d Aristotle\u2019s \u201cDialectics,\u201d mathematics, astronomy, music, certain books of rhetoric and philosophy were the subjects taught in the arts course; to these might be added the Ethics of the Stagyrite and the fourth book of the Topics. The license was granted, according to custom, gratuitously, without oath or condition, and instruction was also free. However, it was often necessary to depart from the rule. Thus the pope authorized Pierre Le Mangeur to levy a moderate fee for the conferring of the license. Similar fees were exacted for the first degree in arts and letters.\n\nIn 1229, a denial of justice by the queen led to suspension of the courses, known as the University of Paris strike of 1229. The pope intervened with a Bull that began with lavish praise of the university: \u201cParis,\u201d said Gregory IX, \u201cmother of the sciences, is another Cariath-Sepher, city of letters.\u201d He compared it to a laboratory in which wisdom tested the metals which she found there, gold and silver to adorn the Spouse of Jesus Christ, iron to fashion the spiritual sword which should smite the inimical powers. He commissioned the Bishops of Le Mans and Senlis and the Archdeacon of Ch\u00e2lons to negotiate with the French Court for the restoration of the university. The year 1230 came to an end without any result, and Gregory IX took the matter directly in hand by a Bull of 1231 addressed to the masters and scholars of Paris. Not content with settling the dispute and giving guarantees for the future, he empowered the university to frame statutes concerning the discipline of the schools, the method of instruction, the defense of theses, the costume of the professors, and the obsequies of masters and students (expanding upon Robert de Cour\u00e7on\u2019s statutes). Most importantly, the pope recognized in the university or granted it the right to suspend its courses, if justice were denied it, until it should receive full satisfaction.\n\nThus the University of Paris, which in general was the model for other universities, assumed its basic form. It was composed of seven groups, the four nations of the faculty of arts, and the three superior faculties of theology, law, and medicine. Church officials lavishly praised the university: St. Louis, in the diploma which he granted to the Carthusians for their establishment near Paris, speaks of this city, where \u201cflow the most abundant waters of wholesome doctrine, so that they become a great river which after refreshing the city itself irrigates the Universal Church.\u201d\n\nColleges\n\nThe Old Sorbonne before the fire in 1670 / Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe scattered condition of the scholars in Paris often made lodging difficult. Some students rented rooms from townspeople, who often exacted high rates. This tension between scholars and citizens would have developed into a sort of civil war if Robert de Cour\u00e7on had not found the remedy of taxation. It was upheld in the Bull of Gregory IX of 1231, but with an important modification: its exercise was to be shared with the citizens. The aim was to offer the students a shelter where they would fear neither annoyance from the owners nor the dangers of the world. Thus were founded the colleges, which were not usually centers of instruction, but simple student boarding-houses. Each had a special object, being established for students of the same nationality or the same science. They also enabled students to use their time more wisely, sometimes under the guidance of resident masters.\n\nFour colleges appeared in the twelfth century; they became more numerous in the thirteenth, including Coll\u00e8ge d\u2019Harcourt (1280) and the Coll\u00e8ge de Sorbonne (1257).\n\nThe Sorbonne today / Wikimedia Commons\n\nBesides the famous Coll\u00e8ge de Sorbonne, other collegia provided housing and meals to students, sometimes for those of the same geographical origin in a more restricted sense than that represented by the nations. There were eight or nine collegia for foreign students: the oldest one was the Danish college, the Collegium danicum or dacicum, founded in 1257. Swedish students could, during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, live in one of three Swedish colleges, the Collegium Upsaliense,the Collegium Scarense, or the Collegium Lincopense, named after the Swedish dioceses of Uppsala, Skara, and Link\u00f6ping, the cathedral schools of which the scholars had presumably attended before travelling to Paris. The Scottish college or Collegium scoticum was founded in 1325 and the German College, Collegium alemanicum, is mentioned as early as 1345. The Lombard college or Collegium lombardicum was founded in the 1330s. The Collegium constantinopolitanum was, according to a tradition, founded in the thirteenth century to facilitate a merging of the eastern and western churches. It was later reorganized as a French institution, the Coll\u00e8ge de la Marche-Winville. The Coll\u00e8ge de Montaigu was founded by the Archbishop of Rouen in the fourteenth century, and reformed in the fifteenth century by the humanist Jan Standonck, when it attracted reformers from within the Roman Catholic Church (such as Erasmus and Loyola) and those who subsequently became Protestants (John Calvin and John Knox).\n\nHastings Rashdall, in The Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages (1895), which is still a standard reference on the topic, lists some 70 colleges of the university from the Middle Ages alone; some of these were short-lived and disappeared already before the end of the medieval period, but others were founded in the Early modern period, like the Coll\u00e8ge des Quatre-Nations.\n\nFifteenth Century\n\nRector of the University of Paris and Doctor of the Sorbonne / Wikimedia Commons\n\nIn the fifteenth century, Guillaume d\u2019Estouteville, a cardinal and Apostolic legate, carried out a project to reform the university, correcting its abuses and introducing various needed modifications. This reform was less an innovation than a recall to the better observance of the old rules, as was the reform of 1600, undertaken by the royal government, with regard to the three superior faculties. For the faculty of arts, however, the reform of 1600 introduced the study of Greek, of the French poets and orators, and of additional classical figures like Hesiod, Plato, Demosthenes, Cicero, Virgil, and Sallust. The prohibition to teach civil law was never well observed at Paris, but in 1679 Louis XIV authorized the teaching of civil law in the faculty of decretals. Thus, the name \u201cfaculty of law\u201d replaced that of \u201cfaculty of decretals.\u201d The colleges meantime had multiplied; those of Cardinal Le-Moine and Navarre were founded in the fourteenth century. The Hundred Years\u2019 War was fatal to these establishments, but the university set about remedying the injury.\n\nRemarkable for its teaching, the University of Paris played an important role in many areas: in the Church, during the Great Schism; in the councils, in dealing with heresies and deplorable divisions; in the State, during national crises; and though under the domination of England it dishonored itself in the trial of Joan of Arc, it rehabilitated itself by rehabilitating Joan. Proud of its rights and privileges, it fought energetically to maintain them, hence the long struggle against the mendicant orders on academic as well as on religious grounds. Hence also the shorter conflict against the Jesuits, who claimed by word and action a share in its teaching. It made liberal use of its right to decide administratively according to occasion and necessity. In some instances it openly endorsed the censures of the faculty of theology and pronounced condemnation in its own name, as in the case of the Flagellants.\n\nIts patriotism was especially manifested on two occasions. During the captivity of King John, when Paris was given over to factions, the university sought to restore peace; and under Louis XIV, when the Spaniards crossed the Somme and threatened the capital, it placed two hundred men at the king\u2019s disposal and offered the Master of Arts degree gratuitously to scholars who should present certificates of service in the army.\n\nReferences\n\nFerruolo, Stephen. 1985.

They replaced the former University of Paris, one of the archetypal European universities, founded about 1170.\n\nThe medieval University of Paris grew out of the cathedral schools of Notre-Dame and, like most other medieval universities, was a kind of corporate company that included both professors and students. With papal support, Paris soon became the great transalpine centre of Christian orthodox theological teaching. At the end of the 13th and during the 14th centuries, it was the most celebrated teaching centre of all Christendom. Its famous professors included Alexander of Hales, St. Bonaventure, Albertus Magnus, and Thomas Aquinas.\n\nMore From Britannica education: The French universities\n\nThe university was originally divided into four faculties: three \u201csuperior,\u201d theology, canon law, and medicine; and one \u201cinferior,\u201d arts. In the faculty of arts, the trivium (grammar, rhetoric, and dialectic) and the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music) were taught together with general scientific, literary, and general culture. Aristotelian philosophy was an especially important field of study in the arts faculty. Each faculty was headed by a dean, and the dean of the faculty of arts had by the 14th century become the head of the collective university under the title of rector.\n\nMany colleges were built to accommodate the students. The most celebrated was the Sorbonne, founded by the theologian Robert de Sorbon about 1257. Because its halls were the scene of numerous theological disputations, the name Sorbonne became a popular term for the theological faculty of Paris.\n\nThe University of Paris remained a spokesman for Roman Catholic orthodoxy, and its educational program, which was founded on scholastic dialectics, became rigidly fixed. As a result, the university made little contribution to the humanistic studies of the Renaissance, and the university subsequently declined under the impact of the Reformation and the ensuing Counter-Reformation. With the French Revolution (1789\u201399) and Napoleon\u2019s subsequent reorganization of many of France\u2019s institutions, the University of Paris became one of the academies of the newly created University of France. Among its several faculties were some that were later abandoned (e.g., theology in 1886), and others, such as science and pharmacy, that were new. Teaching at the university had by then become secular\u2014that is, independent of political or religious doctrine.\n\nAt mid-20th century (when the University of France, as a central organizing body, had given place to the Ministry of Public Instruction), the University of Paris had again become a preeminent scientific and intellectual centre. The most distinguished professors lectured there, and there were more than 600 professorial chairs. In May 1968 a protest initiated by students at the Sorbonne grew into a serious national crisis. This led to a major educational reform that decentralized schools and gave students greater participation in university administration."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Philip-II-king-of-France", "page_content": "Philip II , byname Philip Augustus, French Philippe Auguste , (born August 21, 1165, Paris , France\u2014died July 14, 1223, Mantes), the first of the great Capetian kings of medieval France (reigned 1180\u20131223), who gradually reconquered the French territories held by the kings of England and also furthered the royal domains northward into Flanders and southward into Languedoc. He was a major figure in the Third Crusade to the Holy Land in 1191.\n\nWhen the count of Flanders allied himself with the Champagne faction , there followed a serious revolt against the king. In the Peace of Boves, in July 1185 (confirmed by the Treaty of Gisors in May 1186), the king and the count of Flanders composed their differences (which had been chiefly over possession of Vermandois, in Picardy) so that the disputed territory was partitioned, Amiens and numerous other places passing to the king and the remainder, with the county of Vermandois proper, being left provisionally to Philip of Alsace. Thenceforward the king was free to run against Henry II of England.\n\nWhen Henry II of England arrived in Normandy, perhaps with the intention of responding to an appeal by the house of Champagne, Philip II entered into negotiations with him and, at Gisors on June 28, 1180, renewed an understanding that Louis VII had reached with him in 1177. As a result, the house of Champagne was politically isolated, and Philip II was making all decisions for himself and acting as he saw fit when his father died, on September 18, 1180, leaving him sole king in name as well as in fact.\n\nPhilip was the son of Louis VII of France and Adela of Champagne. In order to be associated as king with his father, who had fallen mortally ill, he was crowned at Reims on November 1, 1179. His uncles of the house of Champagne\u2014Henry I, count of Champagne; Guillaume, archbishop of Reims; and Thibaut V, count of Blois and Chartres\u2014hoped to use the youthful king to control France. To escape from their tutelage , Philip on April 28, 1180, married Isabella, the daughter of Baldwin V of Hainaut and the niece (through her mother) of Philip of Alsace, the count of Flanders, who promised to give the king the territory of Artois as her dowry.\n\nTerritorial expansion\n\nHenry\u2019s French possessions\u2014the so-called Angevin empire, consisting of Normandy, Maine, Anjou, and Touraine, with Aquitaine in the hands of his son, the future Richard I the Lion-Heart of England, and Brittany ruled by another son, Geoffrey (died 1186)\u2014all were a constant menace to the French royal domain. Furthermore, there were long-standing disputes over the Vexin (between Normandy and the \u00cele-de-France), Berry, and Auvergne.\n\nPhilip II launched an attack on Berry in the summer of 1187 but then in June made a truce with Henry, which left Issoudun in his hands and also granted him Fr\u00e9teval, in Vend\u00f4mois. Though the truce was for two years, Philip found grounds for resuming hostilities in the summer of 1188. He skillfully exploited the estrangement between Henry and Richard, and Richard did homage to him voluntarily at Bonmoulins in November 1188. Finally, by the Treaty of Azay-le-Rideau, or of Colombi\u00e8res (July 4, 1189), Henry was forced to renew his own homage, to confirm the cession of Issoudun, with Gra\u00e7ay also, to Philip, and to renounce his claim to suzerainty over Auvergne. Henry died two days later.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Before his departure, he made the so-called Testament of 1190 to provide for the government of his kingdom in his absence. On his way to Palestine, he met Richard in Sicily, where they promptly found themselves at variance, though they made a treaty at Messina in March 1191. Arriving in Palestine, they cooperated against the Muslims at Acre, until Philip fell ill and made his illness a pretext for returning to France, quite determined to settle the succession to Flanders (Philip of Alsace had just died on the Crusade) while Richard was still absent. Thus, by the end of 1191, Philip II was back in France.\n\nIn spite of promises he had made in the Holy Land, Philip at once prepared to attack the Plantagenet possessions in France. Informed of this, Richard also left the Crusade but was taken prisoner while on his way back by the duke of Austria, Leopold V of Babenberg. Philip did everything he could to prolong his rival\u2019s captivity, but Richard was at last set free (1194) and went to war against Philip. The French king suffered a number of defeats (from that at Fr\u00e9teval in July 1194 to that at Courcelles in September 1198) in a series of campaigns that were occasionally punctuated by negotiations. It was fortuitous for Philip, however, when Richard was killed in April 1199.\n\nRichard\u2019s brother John was by no means as formidable a fighter. Moreover, his right to Richard\u2019s succession could be contested by Arthur of Brittany, whose father had been senior to John. To secure the succession, therefore, John came to terms with Philip: by the Treaty of Le Goulet (May 22, 1200), in return for Philip\u2019s recognition of him as Richard\u2019s heir, he ceded \u00c9vreux and the Norman Vexin to Philip; agreed that Issoudun and Gra\u00e7ay should be the dowry of his niece Blanche of Castile, who was to marry the future Louis VIII (Philip\u2019s son by Isabella of Hainaut); and renounced any claim to suzerainty over Berry and Auvergne.\n\nShortly afterward, however, John entered into conflict with the Lusignan family of Poitou (in Aquitaine), who appealed to Philip as overlord. When he was summoned to appear before the royal court as a vassal of the French crown, John did not present himself, and Philip, in April 1202, pronounced John\u2019s French fiefs forfeit and undertook to carry out the sentence himself. He invaded Normandy, overran the northeast, and laid siege to Arques, while Arthur of Brittany, the son of Geoffrey, who died some years before, campaigned against John\u2019s supporters in Poitou; but John, marching south from Maine, captured Arthur at Mirebeau (August 1). In fury, Philip abandoned the siege of Arques and marched southwestward to Tours, ravaging John\u2019s territory on his way before returning to Paris. Guillaume des Roches, the powerful seneschal of Anjou, who had taken John\u2019s side, came to terms with Philip in March 1203.\n\nResuming operations against Normandy, Philip occupied the towns around the great fortress of Ch\u00e2teau-Gaillard, to which he laid siege in September 1203, having overruled Pope Innocent III\u2019s attempts to mediate. John, who is reported to have murdered Arthur of Brittany in April, retired to England in December, and Ch\u00e2teau-Gaillard fell to Philip in March 1204. Rouen, the Norman capital, surrendered in June, after 40 days\u2019 resistance.\n\nAfter his conquest of Normandy, Philip subdued Maine, Touraine, Anjou, and most of Poitou with less difficulty (1204\u201305), though the castles of Loches and Chinon held out for a year. He sought to secure his conquests by lavishing privileges on the towns and on the religious houses but otherwise left the local barons in power. Unrest, however, was endemic in Poitou, and in June 1206 John landed at La Rochelle. After a campaign in the south, he turned north toward the Loire. At Thouars in October 1206, he and Philip made a two-year truce, leaving John in possession of the reconquered Poitevin lands. In the following year, however, Philip invaded Poitou again; and, after a further campaign in 1208, only the south and part of the west of Poitou remained loyal to John (with Saintonge, Guyenne, and Gascony).\n\nPhilip next hoped to exploit the dispute between John and Pope Innocent III. While Innocent was threatening to declare John unfit to reign (1212), plans were being made for a French landing in England and for the accession of Philip\u2019s son Louis to the English throne. The plans had to be dropped when John made his submission to the pope (1213). Throwing himself into schemes for revenge, John formed a coalition against France: the Holy Roman emperor Otto IV, the count of Flanders (Ferrand, or Ferdinand, of Portugal), and the count of Boulogne (Raynald, or Renaud, of Dammartin) were to invade the Capetian territory from the northeast while John attacked from the west, with the help of his Poitevin barons.\n\nJohn landed at La Rochelle in February 1214 and advanced into Anjou but was put to flight by Louis at La Roche-aux-Moines on July 2; his confederates were completely defeated by Philip in the decisive Battle of Bouvines on July 27. The Anglo-Angevin power in France and the coalition had both been broken in one month. Thus Philip, who, in 1213, had transferred Brittany to his cousin Peter of Dreux, was left without any significant opposition to his rule in France.\n\nIt was not only at the Plantagenets\u2019 expense that Philip enlarged the royal domain. His claim to Artois through his first marriage and his gains by the settlement of 1185\u201386 have been mentioned above, and he subsequently proceeded, step by step, to acquire the rest of Vermandois and Valois. His insistence on his suzerainty over vacant fiefs and on his tutelage over minors and heiresses was particularly effective with regard to Flanders, where two successive Flemish counts, Philip of Alsace (died 1191) and Baldwin IX (died c. 1205) had left no male issue.\n\nThough he did not personally take part in the Crusade proclaimed by Pope Innocent III against a Cathari religious sect in Languedoc, Philip allowed his vassals and knights to carry it out. Simon de Montfort\u2019s capture of B\u00e9ziers and Carcassonne (1209) and his victory at Muret over Raymond VI of Toulouse and Peter II of Aragon (1213) prepared the way for the eventual annexation of eastern Languedoc to the royal domain six years after Philip\u2019s death and for the union of northern and southern France under Capetian rule."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/place/Paris/Medieval-development-and-discord-12th-century-to-16th-century", "page_content": "In 1469, during Louis XI \u2019s reign (1461\u201383), the Sorbonne installed the first printing press in Paris. Otherwise this was a period of intellectual stagnation. Churches were rehabilitated and new houses were built, however; from 1480 splendid private mansions began to appear, such as the H\u00f4tel de Sens and the H\u00f4tel de Cluny.\n\nIn 1429 Joan of Arc failed to capture Paris. Only in 1436 did it fall to the legitimists, who welcomed Charles VII in person in 1437. Successive disturbances had reduced the population, but the Anglo-French truce of 1444 allowed Charles to begin restoring prosperity.\n\nThe dynastic and political vendetta between the Burgundian and the Armagnac faction (1407\u201335) had continual repercussions in Paris, where the butchers and skinners, led by Simon Caboche , momentarily seized power (1413). The resumption of the Hundred Years\u2019 War by the English in 1415 made matters worse. After a revolt of the Parisians (1418), the Burgundians occupied Paris; the Anglo-Burgundian Alliance (1419) was followed by the installation of John Plantagenet, duke of Bedford , as regent of France for the English king Henry VI (1422). Whereas Charles VI had lived in his father\u2019s H\u00f4tel Saint-Paul, Bedford lived in the H\u00f4tel des Tournelles, on the southeastern edge of the Marais, which was to be the Paris residence of later kings until 1559. During the reign of Charles VI, construction began on the Notre-Dame Bridge (1413).\n\nIn 1382 a tax riot grew into a revolt called the \u201cMaillotin uprising.\u201d The rioters, armed with mauls (maillets), were ruthlessly put down, and the municipal function was suspended for the next 79 years. It was not until 1533, when Francis I ordered the teetering House of Pillars replaced by a new building, that a monarch manifested an encouraging interest in municipal government.\n\nIn the 14th century the development of Paris was hindered not only by the Black Death (1348\u201349) but also by the Hundred Years\u2019 War (1337\u20131453) and by internal disturbances resulting from it. The provost of the merchants in 1356 was \u00c9tienne Marcel , who wanted a Paris as rich and free as the independent cities of the Low Countries . He gave the House of Pillars to the municipal government , and he slew the Dauphin\u2019s counselors in the palace throne room and took over the city. Marcel showed great executive skill and equally great political stupidity and allied himself with the revolting peasants (the Jacquerie), with the invading English, and with Charles the Bad , the ambitious king of Navarre. While going to open the city gates to the Navarrese in 1358, Marcel was slain by the citizens.\n\nDuring the reign of Philip II (1179\u20131223), Paris was extensively improved. Streets were paved, the city wall was enlarged, and a number of new towns were enfranchised. In 1190, when Philip II went on a crusade for a year, he entrusted the city\u2019s administration not to the provost but to the guild. In 1220 the crown ceded one of its own precious rights to the townsmen\u2014the right to collect duty on incoming goods. The merchants were also made responsible for maintaining fair weights and measures . The King\u2019s formal recognition of the University of Paris in 1200 was also a recognition of the natural division of Paris into three parts. On the Right Bank were the mercantile quarters, on the island was the cit\u00e9, and the Left Bank contained the university and academic quarters. Numerous colleges were also founded, including the Sorbonne (about 1257).\n\nFrom Renaissance architecture to beautification schemes (15th century to 18th century)\n\nThe influence of the Italian Renaissance on town architecture appeared in the new building for the accounting office and in the reconstruction of the Notre-Dame Bridge (1500\u201310) in Louis XII\u2019s reign. Under Francis I (1515\u201347) this influence grew stronger, finding notable expression in the new H\u00f4tel de Ville. Furthermore, whereas from Charles VII\u2019s time the kings of France had preferred to reside in Touraine, Francis returned the chief seat of royalty to Paris. With this in mind he had extensive alterations made to the Louvre from 1528 onward. The new splendour of the monarchy, which was well on its way toward absolute rule, was reflected in the way Paris developed as the capital of an increasingly centralized state. The population increased and the town expanded again. Rigorous measures were taken to stamp out Protestantism, which first appeared in Paris during Francis I\u2019s reign.\n\nThe Renaissance in Paris culminated with Henry II, who made his solemn entry into the capital in 1549. The new impulse given to building mansions for the nobility and bourgeoisie began to transform Paris from a medieval to a modern city. In 1548 the Brothers of the Passion began performing secular plays at the H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne, in the rue Fran\u00e7aise, thus inaugurating the first theatre in Paris.\n\nThe transfer of the royal residence from the H\u00f4tel des Tournelles to the Louvre, signaling the development of the neglected western outskirts of Paris, was completed after Henry II\u2019s death in 1559. Catherine de M\u00e9dicis began to build the Tuileries Palace, the gardens of which became a meeting place for elegant society. Classical taste was brilliantly exemplified by the Pont-Neuf, begun in 1577.\n\nIn the mid-16th century the Wars of Religion broke out in France between Roman Catholics and Huguenots, which in Paris brought about the Massacre of St. Bartholomew\u2019s Day (1572); the Day of the Barricades (1588), when the Catholic League rose against Henry III; and the long resistance of the Parisians to the Protestant Henry of Navarre, who succeeded as Henry IV in 1589. Henry IV\u2019s siege in 1590 was unsuccessful, and only after his conversion to Catholicism did Paris submit to him (1594).\n\nIn Louis XIII\u2019s reign (1610\u201343) Paris expanded farther. On the Left Bank, outside the wall, the queen mother, Marie de M\u00e9dicis, built the Luxembourg Palace, with its spacious gardens; along the Right Bank, west of the Tuileries, she laid out the Cours-la-Reine as a promenade for carriages. While the Marais north of the Place Royale was being reclaimed and developed, two uninhabited islets east of the cit\u00e9 were united to form the \u00cele Saint-Louis. On the western fringe of the town, a quarter with straight streets was laid out north of Richelieu\u2019s new palace, the Palais-Cardinal (1624\u201336; later the Palais-Royal), which also had a magnificent garden; west of this there was more building and a new fortification was erected.\n\nThe war of the Fronde (1648\u201353) was the major event of the first two decades of Louis XIV\u2019s reign. From 1661, when Cardinal Mazarin died and Louis started his personal rule, Paris was dedicated to reflecting the glory of the monarch, even though he was early resolved to establish himself and the seat of his government outside of Paris (he chose Versailles). For the planning of the new splendours of Paris, the greatest part of the credit must go to Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the king\u2019s superintendent of buildings.\n\nWork on the Louvre had been resumed in 1624 and was completed by Claude Perrault\u2019s magnificent colonnade (1667\u201374). The Tuileries Palace was altered and sumptuously decorated. Beyond its gardens to the west, outside the walls of Paris, the tree-planted avenues of the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es were laid out (1667); these were complemented, at the opposite end of Paris, by the Cours de Vincennes.\n\nIn 1702 the Marquis d\u2019Argenson (Marc Ren\u00e9 de Voyer), who as lieutenant general of police succeeded the provosts of Paris, raised the number of districts from 16 to 20 (15 on the Right Bank, five on the Left). Paris had nearly 600,000 people, and from the Left Bank new suburbs were advancing toward the villages on the surrounding hills.\n\nDuring the 18th century a great deal was done to improve and beautify Paris. Louis XV\u2019s temporary residence in the Tuileries during his younger days encouraged development nearby, so that the Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 expanded and became, like the Faubourg Saint-Germain, an aristocratic quarter. The garden of the Palais-Royal became a centre of elegant society. The Grands Boulevards began to be bordered with houses, including some fine mansions, and the eastern stretch became a fashionable promenade with little theatres and caf\u00e9s. Villas built by nobles and financiers were scattered around this outlying sector. On the Left Bank the southern course of boulevards was laid out and the routes were lined with trees and houses. Some of the houses that had been built earlier on the bridges were razed in 1786\u201388; others remained until 1808. Water was supplied to both banks by two fire pumps, developed by Jacques-Constantin P\u00e9rier and his father, Auguste-Charles. The wall of the farmers-general, built in the 1780s to facilitate the levying of duties on imports, represented the extension and the unity of Paris."}, {"url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/intellectual-culture-in-medieval-paris/university-of-paris-in-the-thirteenth-century/019E132463B709849AF1EA31C0FDC676", "page_content": "A new kind of career, an academic career, had become possible in the twelfth-century schools. Only loosely tied to existing institutions, however, it involved a high level of risk, and the careers of specific individuals were potentially short lived. Students had a large say in who would find an audience, and those who wished to make the transition from student to master often did so by competing with their masters. At the same time, schoolmen were vulnerable to a monastic critique which insisted that religious knowledge could only be acquired by the virtuous, and that teachers must take responsibility for the effect they had on their students. Monasteries provided institutional guarantees of virtue and responsibility for reception which the schoolmen conspicuously lacked. The first part of this chapter will focus on the institutional development of a university in Paris. This involved the stabilization of the academic career, with masters asserting control over students, and the appropriation of key monastic ideals to establish a new discourse that allowed the university to negotiate a privileged position in society. The emergence of the university did not, however, bring an end to intellectual differences. Very different approaches to knowing, especially knowing about God, will be illustrated in the second and third parts of the chapter by exploring the work of Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventure, two of the most outstanding thinkers of the thirteenth century, both of whom spent significant parts of their careers in Paris. The fourth and final part of the chapter will look at moments when intellectual difference led to conflict and condemnation.\n\nInstitutionalization, cultural identity and a new discourse of learning\n\nIn the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, scholars in a few places began to adopt forms of collective organization that embraced or to some extent replaced the schools which had flourished independently for many years. They joined together in corporations or guilds that came to enjoy formal legal standing, and acquired rights and privileges. With hindsight it is possible to identify the emergence of the earliest universities, although no one could have offered this interpretation at the time. On the other hand, contemporaries were aware that changes were taking place, and they described the new institutions of learning as studia generalia. In other words, they perceived certain places as general centres of learning.1 If the term signified more than a vague recognition of prestige, it probably referred to their ability to attract students and masters from across Europe, and their capacity to offer teaching in advanced subjects like theology, law and medicine, as well as the arts. The word \u2018universitas\u2019 was not applied specifically to institutions of learning; it was a very general term that could be used to describe any corporate body with legal rights, and it is a matter of chance that vernacular versions of the word have survived to refer exclusively to institutions of higher education.2\n\nThe process by which the first universities emerged is difficult to analyse because very little evidence survives. Historians have nevertheless tried to explain this process and to discover the origins of the medieval university, essentially offering three types of explanation. First, the emergence of universities has been explained in terms of conflict between scholars and both local ecclesiastical authorities and the town authorities. In response to these conflicts, the scholars acted collectively to protect themselves, and in the course of these conflicts they gained privileges from kings, popes and emperors.3 The second type of explanation stresses debates amongst learned men, and especially the development of shared educational ideals to which the emerging universities gave expression.4 The third approach treats the university as a product of its urban environment. Scholars deliberately copied artisans and merchants, their classrooms were like workshops, they sold knowledge in the way that artisans and merchants sold their goods, and the university was therefore a guild like any other trade guild.5 Recent scholarship has tended to acknowledge a measure of validity in all three approaches.6\n\nThe gradual emergence of studia generalia is generally associated with Bologna, Paris and Oxford. From early in the thirteenth century, further universities were established in two ways. Some were set up by masters and students migrating from an existing university, usually in response to conflict with local authorities. Thus, for example, Cambridge was created by scholars from Oxford (1209\u201314), Padua by scholars from Bologna (1222), and Orl\u00e9ans and Angers by Parisian scholars (1229\u201331). Other universities were deliberately founded by a major secular or ecclesiastical authority, often for specific political reasons. The earliest examples were Naples, set up by Emperor Frederick II in 1224, and Toulouse, created by the papacy in 1229. By 1300 there were at least eighteen universities in western Europe.7 Amongst the earliest universities, Bologna and Paris were the most influential in terms of organization and structure, offering two very different models which later universities imitated, while developing their own manifold variations.\n\nIt is worth considering Bologna briefly in order to appreciate what was distinctive about Paris. The studium generale at Bologna was pre-eminent in the study of law, and students exercised a significant measure of control, although perhaps not as much as once thought.8 The crucial steps towards collective organization were taken by law students who had come from elsewhere to study in Bologna. Because they were not citizens of Bologna, they lacked the protection which citizenship gave to both person and property. Most of the students of Roman law were laymen and therefore did not enjoy the benefits of clerical status either. Moreover, many were mature adults from wealthy families, and had already acquired political and administrative experience. In order to secure a measure of protection for themselves, the law students formed loose associations which were defined approximately by the students\u2019 places of origin, and were termed \u2018nations\u2019. More substantial corporations, or universitates, were also established, each run by a student elected as rector. In the early thirteenth century there were four such corporations, but by the middle of the century there were two: the universitas citramontanorum for law students from Italian towns other than Bologna, and the universitas ultramontanorum for law students who had come from north of the Alps. Bolognese students were denied full membership of any of these groups.\n\nThese developments were not welcomed by the commune of Bologna. In the conflict between the student corporations and the commune, the students wielded considerable power by threatening to leave the city to study elsewhere, which would deprive the masters and the city as a whole of their money. This was not an idle threat, and a group of students departed to Vicenza in 1204. The town tried to deprive the students of this power by regulating the oaths which they took. Thus the town statutes of 1211 and 1215 prohibited students from swearing that they would leave Bologna at the bidding of a particular individual. In 1217 and 1220 the commune tried to make the rectors take oaths not to leave Bologna to study elsewhere. In the face of this hostility, the students appealed to the pope. A combination of papal pressure and the fear of losing more business persuaded the commune to give in, or at least to compromise. By 1245, or even a few years earlier, foreign students were granted some of the legal rights enjoyed by citizens. The jurisdiction of the rectors was largely acknowledged in the town statutes. The statutes of the student corporations were recognized by the commune in the early 1250s. During the second half of the thirteenth century, another student corporation was formed, a university of arts and medicine.\n\nThese developments left the masters of Bologna in a weak position. Initially they did not seek collective organization because they were mostly citizens of Bologna and therefore enjoyed legal protection. The commune imposed its authority on them at an early stage, from 1189 requiring them to swear that they would only teach in Bologna. In 1219 Pope Honorius III decreed that the licence to teach should be granted by the archdeacon of Bologna, who became known as the chancellor. The masters were financially dependent, however, on fees paid by the students and, as a result, the student corporations exercised, at least in theory, a large degree of control over the masters. To give just a few examples of the many regulations, every year the students elected the masters who were to teach, and these masters had to take an oath subjecting themselves to the rector. A master could not leave Bologna even for a matter of days without permission from both his students and the rector. Masters were fined if they did not begin and end their lectures on time, or if they failed to cover the required ground by set dates. If a master did not attract an audience of more than five students, he was fined as if he himself had been absent. Four students were elected to monitor the masters and to report infringements; to keep the masters continuously on their toes, they were not told which students had been elected to perform this role. Whether or not student corporations fully exercised the power that these rules suggest, towards the end of the thirteenth century the commune established salaried lectureships, which deprived the student corporations of their financial clout and put the city authorities in a position to control education in Bologna.\n\nThe studium generale at Paris, however, was run by its masters whose pre-eminence in arts and theology was internationally recognized. The early contribution of Abelard and others has been mentioned, as has the significance of papal protection. Exactly when and why the masters began to act collectively is unclear, but key steps must have been taken during the second half of the twelfth century. Unlike the masters of Bologna who were citizens of that town, most were not from Paris, and it has often been surmised that they acted to protect themselves. They were also in a stronger position to impose themselves on the students because many of them held ecclesiastical benefices and did not therefore rely entirely upon fees, while most of the students were significantly younger than their counterparts in Bologna. Whatever the precise circumstances in which the masters began to act corporately, the key surviving documents bearing witness to and formally establishing their rights and privileges were largely the product of conflict with the local town and ecclesiastical authorities. The three most significant documents were the charter granted by Philip Augustus in 1200, the statutes issued by Robert of Courson in 1215 and the bull Parens scientiarum of 1231.\n\nThe crisis of 1200 began when a German student sent a servant to buy wine, and the innkeeper tried to overcharge him. The student and some of his friends assaulted the innkeeper and smashed up the inn. The innkeeper went to the royal provost of Paris, who led an attack on the hostel in which a number of German students were residing. Several students were killed. The Paris masters immediately went on strike, suspending all lectures and threatening to leave unless the king punished the provost and his men. The king immediately came down on the side of the university. The provost and his men were imprisoned for life, and the king granted a charter protecting the scholars in the future. The charter included the following provisions: all citizens were obliged to report crimes they saw a layman commit against a scholar; they had to help arrest the criminal and testify in court; the royal provost and the city\u2019s magistrates were prohibited from arresting scholars or seizing their goods. The charter concluded by ordering the provost and people of Paris to take a public oath to abide by the charter, and requiring every new provost to repeat the oath before an assembly of scholars.9 The masters and students had thus expressed their solidarity through collective action, and the king had recognized them as a distinct group, awarding them special status in relation to the people of Paris and his own officials. This status was reaffirmed by public ritual every time a new provost assumed office and performed the highly symbolic act of oath-taking.10\n\nAt some point before 1208\u20139, the masters in Paris drew up a set of statutes that does not survive. This is apparent from a bull, Ex litteris vestre, sent by Pope Innocent III to the masters of theology, canon law and arts at that time. The bull noted that some masters of arts had deviated from established practices by wearing inappropriate dress, failing to observe due order in lectures and disputations, and neglecting to attend funerals. The masters had responded by unanimously selecting eight colleagues to address these issues in statutes, and requiring everyone to take an oath to observe them. When a certain master G. had refused, the masters had deprived him of membership of their body. This master had now submitted, and the point of the bull was to allow his readmission.11 Clearly the masters were capable of taking collective action on their own account, and the pope was willing to back them up.\n\nThe first surviving statutes date from 1215 and were issued by Robert of Courson as a papal legate. These statutes were partly shaped by conflict with both the town and the local ecclesiastical authorities, although there was much that reflected a consensus amongst the scholars themselves. They were certainly not imposed on the academic community by the papal legate because Robert had taught theology in Paris for many years and the opening section of the document makes it clear that he had been instructed to consult, presumably with his former colleagues: \u2018Let all know that, since we have had a special mandate from the pope to take effective measures to reform the state of the Parisian scholars for the better, wishing with the counsel of good men to provide for the tranquility of the scholars in the future, we have decreed and ordained in this wise.\u201912 Furthermore, the following statutes, which were addressed to \u2018all the masters and scholars of Paris\u2019, dealt with matters that had long been of concern, including the issues known to have been the subject of the lost statutes produced by the scholars independently. In many respects they have to be interpreted as the product of cooperation as much as conflict.13\n\nModern readers are often struck by the statutes\u2019 apparent lack of organization.14 The way in which the statutes were set out, however, reveals a great deal about the mindset of those responsible for them. The first section concerned the process of becoming a master of arts and then teaching the arts:\n\nNo one shall lecture in the arts at Paris before he is twenty-one years of age, and he shall have heard lectures for at least six years before he begins to lecture, and he shall promise to lecture for at least two years, unless a reasonable cause prevents, which he ought to prove publicly or before examiners. He shall not be stained by any infamy, and when he is ready to lecture, he shall be examined according to the form which is contained in the writing of the lord bishop of Paris, where is contained the peace confirmed between the chancellor and scholars by judges delegated by the pope, namely, by the bishop and dean of Troyes and by P. the bishop and J. the chancellor of Paris approved and confirmed. And they shall lecture on the books of Aristotle on dialectic old and new in the schools ordinarily and not ad cursum. They shall also lecture on both Priscians ordinarily, or at least on one. They shall not lecture on feast days except on philosophers and rhetoric and the quadrivium and Barbarismus and ethics, if it please them, and the fourth book of the Topics. They shall not lecture on the books of Aristotle on metaphysics and natural philosophy or on summaries of them or concerning the doctrine of master David of Dinant or the heretic Amaury or Mauritius of Spain.15\n\nThere had long been complaints that scholars set about teaching when they were too young, when they had not studied for long enough, and when their behaviour was morally deficient. The statutes immediately set appropriate standards and indicated how magisterial candidates would be scrutinized by alluding to the resolution of a bitter conflict that had recently occurred between the scholars and the chancellor of the cathedral of Notre Dame, John of Candeilles. At issue were the way in which the chancellor exercised his right to grant the licence to teach, and the extent of his powers of jurisdiction over scholars. Previous chancellors had worked harmoniously with the scholars, but John was the first of a number of chancellors and bishops of Paris who tried to control the scholars by undermining their independence. The scholars appealed to Pope Innocent III, who backed them wholeheartedly. In 1212, after noting that he had seen nothing like this when he had studied at Paris, he ordered the bishop, dean and archdeacon of Troyes to censure the chancellor if he did not abandon the practices which offended the scholars. After a process of arbitration, it was the bishop of Paris, Peter of Nemours, who in 1213 recorded the settlement to which the statutes referred. When granting the licence to teach, the chancellor was not to exact oaths of fidelity or obedience, nor was he permitted to charge. His powers to imprison and fine scholars were also carefully circumscribed. Further rules about the granting of the licence to teach were also imposed for as long as John remained chancellor. They ensured that the licence would be given to anyone deemed fit by the masters, although John could still grant licences to candidates who did not have their backing.16 This dispute was over well before 1215, and it was not the immediate trigger for the granting of the statutes, but the masters took care to see that the settlement in their favour was embedded within the statutes. New masters were also obliged to teach, or to be \u2018regent\u2019 masters, as they were called, for a minimum of two years.\n\nThis section of the statutes then dealt with the teaching that a master of arts should undertake, sorting out matters of curriculum and timetable. Set texts were specified for key subjects: the relevant works by Aristotle for dialectic; two parts of a work by Priscian and part of a work by Donatus, referred to as the Barbarismus, for grammar; Aristotle\u2019s Topics for practising the construction of certain types of argument. Dialectic and grammar were clearly established as the core subjects because they were to be taught ordinarily rather than ad cursum. Ordinary lectures contained in-depth analysis and were given by masters, while lectures ad cursum offered more general summaries, and were usually given by bachelors as part of the process by which they qualified to become masters.17 Lectures on rhetoric, the remaining part of the trivium, and the quadrivium could be delivered on feast days, along with ethics and further practice at grammar and argument. The section concluded by prohibiting lectures on Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics and natural philosophy, along with works by recently condemned heretics, thus repeating a ban that had been issued by various bishops in 1210.18\n\nThe start of the second section did not specify whether it concerned students and masters of arts or all the students and masters, but particular rules within it were directed at students and masters of specific subjects.\n\nIn the principia and meetings of the masters and in the responsions and oppositions of the boys and youths there shall be no drinking. They may summon some friends or associates, but only a few. Donations of clothing or other things as has been customary, or more, we urge should be made, especially to the poor. None of the masters lecturing in arts shall have a cope except one round, black and reaching to the ankles, at least while it is new. Use of the pallium is permitted. No one shall wear with the round cope shoes that are ornamented or with elongated pointed toes. If any scholar in arts or theology dies, half of the masters of arts shall attend the funeral at one time, the other half the next time, and no one shall leave until the sepulture is finished, unless he has reasonable cause. If any master in arts or theology dies, all the masters shall keep vigils, each shall read or cause to be read the Psalter, each shall attend the church where is celebrated the watch until midnight or the greater part of the night, unless reasonable cause prevent. On the day when the master is buried, no one shall lecture or dispute.19\n\nThis section thus began by seeking to regulate conduct. First, the statutes tried to limit the festivities that took place at key transitional moments in a student\u2019s career. After receiving his licence to teach, a new master was admitted into the corporation of masters by means of inception, which meant acting as a master for the first time in special disputations, sometimes called \u2018principia\u2019. Before becoming a master, a student had to become a bachelor. The \u2018responsions and oppositions\u2019 almost certainly refer to the examination process during which the candidate was obliged to respond to questions and then \u2018determine\u2019 a disputation. Arts students usually became bachelors at the age of about eighteen or nineteen.20 The statutes permitted new masters and bachelors to celebrate their success, but there was to be no drinking and the scale was to remain modest.21 Charitable giving, however, was strongly encouraged. Dress regulations for masters of arts were then set out. The last part of the section stipulated the funerary practices to be followed when students and masters in arts and theology died. This was a significant step in establishing the university\u2019s status as a corporate body. Religious ritual served to generate a sense of community in a way that was already characteristic of urban guilds and religious confraternities.22\n\nThe next two sections concerned all the students and masters. The first bluntly confirmed that they owned a meadow that was also claimed by the abbey of Saint Germain. The second addressed a range of issues, including some of fundamental importance to the constitution of the university.\n\nEach master shall have jurisdiction over his scholar. No one shall occupy a classroom or house without asking the consent of the tenant, provided one has a chance to ask it. No one shall receive the licentiate from the chancellor or another for money given or promise made or other condition agreed upon. Also, the masters and scholars can make both between themselves and with other persons obligations and constitutions supported by faith or penalty or oath in these cases: namely the murder or mutilation of a scholar or atrocious injury done a scholar, if justice should not be forthcoming, arranging the prices of lodgings, costume, burial, lectures and disputations, so, however, that the university be not thereby dissolved or destroyed.23\n\nThe first sentence set down one of the key organizational principles of the university. A student joined the university by submitting to a particular master who accepted responsibility for him. At the lowest level, the university was composed of masters, each with a number of individual students clustered round him. The next sentence addressed a matter of importance in the relations between the university and the people of Paris. The university owned very little in the way of buildings, so classrooms and accommodation had to be rented. Here masters and students were reminded that they must negotiate reasonably with property owners. At this point the statutes turned abruptly to relations with the local ecclesiastical authorities, stating explicitly the key principle at stake in the conflict with the chancellor to which allusion had already been made: the chancellor had to grant the licence to teach without charging money or imposing any other kind of obligation. This was followed by the line of greatest constitutional significance in the whole document since it recognized the university as a legal corporation. The masters and students could make their own rules, require members of their body to take oaths to obey these rules, and punish those who transgressed them. Moreover, they could make legally binding agreements with other parties. This was the case with regard to a list of issues that, in addition to several matters already treated in the statutes, included the killing or injuring of scholars, and rent control. The power of the corporation was, however, limited in one important respect. The university was not to be \u2018dissolved or destroyed\u2019 as a consequence of their actions, which meant that they could not go on strike and leave to study elsewhere. As we shall see, this was soon to prove their strongest weapon.\n\nAfter these crucial rulings for the whole body of students and masters, the statutes turned specifically to the theologians.\n\nAs to the status of the theologians, we decree that no one shall lecture at Paris before his thirty-fifth year and unless he has studied for eight years at least, and has heard the books faithfully and in classrooms, and has attended lectures in theology for five years before he gives lectures himself publicly. And none of these shall lecture before the third hour on days when masters lecture. No one shall be admitted at Paris to formal lectures or to preachings unless he shall be of approved life and science. No one shall be a scholar at Paris who has no definite master.24\n\nThis section thus established a minimum age and length of study for those wishing to become masters of theology. It then settled a timetabling issue that was of fundamental importance to the smooth running of the university. Many masters of arts were also students and bachelors in the faculty of theology, so they had to be able to teach classes in arts and attend classes in theology. The statutes ruled that theology lectures had to be given after 9.00 a.m., which meant that masters of arts could teach earlier in the day before pursuing their studies in theology.25 Two basic principles for admission to the faculty were then articulated. The first presumably applied to both masters and students: the faculty would only admit men whose virtue and learning had been found satisfactory. The second stated that every student had to be attached to a particular master, an issue that had already been touched upon with regard to the whole university. Finally, Robert of Courson declared that all who deliberately broke these rules were to be excommunicated \u2018unless within fifteen days of the offense they have taken care to emend their presumption before the university of masters and scholars or other persons constituted by the university\u2019.26\n\nThe statutes gave papal recognition to the students and masters of Paris as a legal corporation while also expressing a complex sense of identity. By defining their privileges and regulating their activities, the statutes not only recognized the solidarity of the students and masters as a single body, but also articulated relations between various parts of the university and between the university and others, especially the chancellor and the townspeople. As already noted, however, the way in which they did this is confusing to modern readers because the overall shape of the document is unclear. Individual sections treat in quick succession issues that would seem to be unconnected. The same issues crop up in several places. Some matters are handled with considerable brevity, to the point of seeming cryptic. Hugely significant privileges and rules are treated on a par with relatively minor matters. Having set out rules for dress, funerals and lectures, the statutes declare that the students and masters can make their own rules on just these points. It has been suggested that the statutes lack order because there was very little time in which to consult colleagues and put the document together.27 This explanation does not seem entirely convincing when historians have so little difficulty recasting the material under a series of thematic headings: governance, town\u2013gown relations, conduct and so on. If Robert and his former colleagues had wanted to do this, it would not have been beyond them to recast the material as efficiently as historians do when they offer thematically structured accounts of the statutes. It may therefore be that the conceptual frameworks that seem obvious to modern academics were either not so readily apparent in 1215 or were not thought desirable.\n\nAt this point it is worth recalling two aspects of the monastic critique of the twelfth-century schools. Monks like Bernard of Clairvaux and William of Saint Thierry had insisted that life and learning were intimately connected, that a man had to live virtuously if he were to think correctly, and that meaningful scholarship could only take place within a properly regulated environment. Moreover, a master had to take responsibility for his audience, only teaching those who had undergone the necessary intellectual and moral formation. The statutes clearly sought to regulate the moral behaviour of students and masters, and to establish a formal bond between each master and his students. These regulations were not just about maintaining order, although they were certainly about that. Much more importantly, they were designed to instil the virtues necessary for good learning and to ensure the proper relationship between master and audience. Rules about conduct and behaviour were therefore interspersed with rules about, for example, curriculum precisely because life and learning were understood to be linked. Due weight must also be given to the moral significance of those rules that are not obviously about virtuous behaviour. One of the most commonly condemned manifestations of pride, for example, was the tendency to move on too quickly from one area of study to another. The statutes tackled this when setting minimum ages and periods of study for those who wished to become masters. One of the most frequently identified manifestations of the vice of curiosity was the tendency not to move on from one area of study to another, for example the inclination to carry on studying logic for its own sake rather than moving on to apply logical skills in theology. The timetabling regulations did everything possible to make it easy for arts masters to study theology. The point has been made that the statutes responded to many of the criticisms that had been directed at the schools.28 More than that, they were built around the idea that intellectual and moral formation were inseparable, and that masters had to be responsible for their effect on their audience. In other words, the public vision of the university, the one authorized by the papacy, was fundamentally shaped by key monastic ideals.\n\nThis marked a hugely significant change in the intellectual culture of western Europe. It was not that students and masters henceforth lived and behaved like monks: they did not. At a theoretical level, however, universities were no longer vulnerable to the kind of criticism that had been leveled at the schools in the twelfth century. Actual departures from the ideals articulated in the statutes could be treated as disciplinary issues rather than matters of principle. Virtuous scholars, on the other hand, might be compared to monks. As Rutebeuf, the thirteenth-century vernacular poet, observed, \u2018To one who should wish to live uprightly is there any life so pleasant as is that of true scholars? \u2026 They can not allow themselves to sit long enough at the table. Their life is as well governed as that of any monastic order.\u201929 Universities were ideologically safe from the point of view of those who lived according to a religious rule, and they could now seek to be involved. The arrival of the friars will be considered shortly. In 1237 the general chapter of the Cistercian order authorized the foundation of a Cistercian house in Paris, and in 1256 Guy de l\u2019Aum\u00f4ne became the first Cistercian master of theology at Paris.30\n\nThe university had now received privileges from the king in 1200 and the pope in 1215, but its standing was by no means secure. The bishop of Paris and his chancellor simply did not accept the corporate independence of the students and masters. At one point they excommunicated the whole university on the grounds that it had contravened an earlier ordinance against conspiracies by making constitutions without the consent of the bishop, chapter or chancellor, even though this was just what the 1215 statutes had said they could do. The university had to call repeatedly for papal intervention, and a bull of 1219 insisted that the university could not be excommunicated as a whole without papal permission.31 Matters came to a head, and the university all but disintegrated, in 1229. The crisis began in a tavern in the Rue Saint Marcel with yet another argument over a bill. This led to a series of increasingly violent clashes. Complaints were made to the bishop and the papal legate, Romano, cardinal of Saint Angelo. Romano had himself suffered from scholarly mob violence in 1225 when he had broken the university\u2019s seal and banned the university from making another one. This was one of the few issues on which the pope had backed the local ecclesiastical authorities against the university, which only received the right to have a seal in 1246. Possession of a seal was, however, of great symbolic importance for any corporate body. In reprisal for breaking their seal, a crowd of armed students and masters had attacked Romano\u2019s residence and only dispersed when royal troops came to his rescue.32 Unsurprisingly, the papal legate was as keen as the bishop to act against violent scholars. They turned to Louis IX\u2019s regent, Blanche of Castille, for action. She sent in the provost and his men who killed several students, some of whom had apparently not been involved in the previous disorder. The masters suspended their lectures, but their complaints to the bishop and legate fell on deaf ears. They therefore announced that if they did not receive satisfaction within a month from Easter no one would be allowed to study or teach in the city or diocese of Paris for the next six years, nor would they return after that period of time unless their grievances were adequately addressed. The regent, the bishop and the papal legate remained unmoved, and so the majority of students and masters departed in what is often called the \u2018great dispersion\u2019, pursuing their studies in a range of other cities in western Europe.33\n\nMobility was one of the most powerful weapons that the students and masters could wield.34 Once it became clear that they had not made an idle threat, the authorities started to take action. In August 1229 Louis IX confirmed the privileges granted by Philip Augustus in 1200.35 Pope Gregory IX went into overdrive, reproaching the bishop of Paris for letting matters get out of hand, recalling his legate, ordering the bishops of Le Mans and Senlis and the archdeacon of Ch\u00e2lons sur Marne to act as judges in what he termed the dispute between the king and the students and masters, exhorting the king and the queen mother to recall the scholars and give them justice, reassuring the departed scholars that the matter was being investigated in full, and eventually summoning the bishop of Paris, William of Auvergne, and his chancellor, Philip, to see him in person.36 It took two years to sort everything out, and the university resumed its teaching in 1231. In April and May of that year, Gregory IX issued a series of bulls establishing order, the most important of which was Parens scientiarum, \u2018Parent of sciences\u2019.37\n\nUnlike the statutes of 1215, Parens scientiarum was a carefully crafted and brilliantly assured piece of writing. The grand opening, however, has generally been ignored, perhaps because the standard edition in Denifle and Chatelain\u2019s Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis fails to identify the authoritative sources embedded within it and upon which it is modelled.38 This is unfortunate because it made a powerful claim to authority, and set out the heart of Gregory IX\u2019s message.\n\nParens scientiarum Parisius velut altera Cariath Sepher, civitas litterarum,[39] cara claret, magna quidem sed de se majora facit optari docentibus et discentibus gratiosa, in qua utique tamquam in officina sapientie speciali habet argentum venarum suarum principia, et auro locus est in quo rite conflatur,[40] ex quibus prudentes eloquii mistici[41]murenulas aureas vermiculatas argento[42] cudentes et fabricantes monilia ornata lapidibus pretiosis, immo nulli pretio comparandis sponsam Christi decorant et decorant. Ibi ferrum de terra tollitur,[43] quia dum terrena fragilitas fortitudine solidatur, lorica fidei, gladius spiritus et cetera inde fit christiane militie armatura, potens adversus aereas potestates. Et lapis calore solutus in es vertitur,[44] quia corda lapidea Sancti Spiritus afflata fervore dum ardent, incendunt et fiunt predicatione sonora preconantia laudes Christi.\n\nThis dense passage is difficult to translate, not least because the final line is open to two possible interpretations that are given as alternatives below.45\n\nParis, parent of sciences, like another Cariath Sepher, city of letters, and precious, shines forth. It is great indeed but concerning itself raises hopes for greater things that are pleasing to those who teach and those who learn, where, surely as if in wisdom\u2019s special workshop, there is a mine for silver, and a place for gold which they refine, from which those prudent in mystical eloquence, stamping ornaments of gold, studded with silver, and making necklaces elaborately, adorn and make beautiful the bride of Christ with precious stones, or rather stones beyond price. There iron is taken out of the earth, because when its earthly fragility is solidified by firmness, from it is made the breastplate of faith, the sword of the spirit, and other armour of Christian soldiery, potent against the aerial powers. And copper is smelted from the ore, because while stony hearts burn, blown on by the fervour of the Holy Spirit, they take fire \u2026\n\na. and are made to proclaim the praises of Christ with resonant preaching. [or/and] b. and by preaching are made resonant, proclaiming the praises of Christ.46\n\nIn a way the message was plainly stated. The university was associated with wisdom, and it was credited with producing precious adornments for the spouse of Christ, in other words the church. It also manufactured the armour and weaponry that the church needed in its fight against evil. The first element of complexity came with the final line. Read one way, those who studied at the university were transformed by the Holy Spirit to become preachers. Read another way, they were transformed by preaching as well as the Holy Spirit. Both readings make grammatical sense, so it is likely that both occurred to contemporaries and were perhaps intended by those responsible for the text. There is therefore a double meaning rather than ambiguity: university scholars were transformed into preachers by preaching.\n\nThere was, however, a great deal more to this opening passage. Embedded within it was a string of quotations from the Old Testament: Joshua, Judges, Song of Songs, and above all Job. There was also a phrase from a work by Rupert of Deutz. While it is impossible to be certain that it was taken directly from there, Rupert had commented on and deployed several of the passages of the Old Testament quoted in Parens scientiarum, so there may be a connection awaiting further explanation.47 More importantly, there were also verbal echoes of Gregory the Great\u2019s Moralia in Job, an authoritative work with which many members of the university were bound to be familiar, and upon which the opening passage of the bull clearly drew for its essential themes.48 In a general sense, this use of authorities enhanced the dignity of the university, and indeed Gregory IX had used biblical texts to bolster the standing of the university in a number of his letters since 1229.49 More specifically, however, two messages were driven home.\n\nFirst, Parens scientiarum clearly gestured towards the monastic view of learning. The opening passage contained a line from the Song of Songs, the text upon which learned monks so often worked. The only \u2018contemporary\u2019 writer to be quoted, Rupert of Deutz, was a monk. Much more significantly, however, three quotations were taken from Job 28.1\u20132, and Gregory the Great\u2019s commentary on this passage was highly pertinent. He began his discussion of Job 28.1, \u2018there is a mine for silver, and a place for gold which they refine\u2019, by remarking: \u2018In silver eloquence is customarily designated, in gold brightness of life or of wisdom.\u201950 He went on to attack heretics whose pride led them to neglect the sacred books, and to repeat Paul\u2019s injunction to avoid \u2018profane novelties of speaking\u2019.51 In the context of learning, Gregory\u2019s emphasis on the importance of a good life, and his distrust of pride and novelty, had much in common with the monastic critique of the twelfth-century schools. By associating the university with an authoritative expression of this complex of ideas, Parens scientiarum stressed the way in which it had taken on board the monastic ideals of learning, and repeated the message conveyed by the 1215 statutes.\n\nSecond, Parens scientiarum introduced a theme that had been missing from the 1215 statutes: the idea of transformation. Monks like William of Saint Thierry had envisaged radical transformation in their ascents to God, and now transformation re-entered the frame. In a way this was another nod to monastic ways of thinking, except that a very different transformation was envisaged. The university was not directly responsible for transforming the individual soul in its relationship with God. Rather Parens scientiarum highlighted a transformation that revolved around preaching. In particular it stressed the way in which the university served the church by turning men into preachers, and Gregory the Great\u2019s commentary on Job underpinned this theme too. Commenting on the lines from Job quoted in Parens scientiarum, Gregory the Great stressed the importance of the unity of the church and, building on the line \u2018iron is taken out of the earth\u2019 (Job 28.2), deployed martial imagery to advocate the defence of the faith. Above all, he took the theme of transformation from the words of Job and applied them to the process of becoming a preacher.\n\nFerrum de terra tollitur. Ac si aperte dicat: Fortes uiri qui acutissimis linguarum gladiis in hac acie defendendae fidei ferrum fiunt, aliquando terra in infimis actionibus fuerunt. Peccanti quippe homini dictum est: Terra es et in terram ibis. Sed de terra ferrum tollitur, cum fortis propugnator Ecclesiae a terrena quam prius tenuit actione separatur. Non ergo in eo debet despici quicquid fuit, qui iam coepit esse quod non fuit. An non Matthaeus in terra inuentus est, qui terrenis negotiis implicatus telonii usibus seruiebat? Sed de terra tultus, in fortitudine ferri conualuit, cuius uidelicet lingua quasi acutissimo gladio euangelii administratione Dominus infidelium corda transfixit; et qui infirmus prius despectusque fuerat per terrena negotia, fortis postmodum factus est ad caelestia praedicamenta.\n\nVnde adhuc subiungitur:\n\nEt lapis solutus calore, in aes uertitur. Tunc lapis calore soluitur, cum cor durum atque a diuini amoris igne frigidum eodem diuini amoris igne tangitur, et in feruore spiritus liquatur, ut ad sequentem uitam desideriorum aestu ardeat, quam prius audiens insensibilis manebat. Ex quo ardore scilicet et emollitur ad amorem, et roboratur ad operationem; ut sicut prius durus fuerat in amore saeculi, ita se postmodum fortem exserat in amorem Dei; et quod ante audire renuebat, iam et credere et praedicare incipiat. Lapis ergo solutus calore, in aes uertitur, quia dura mens superni amoris igne liquefacta ad ueram fortitudinem commutatur, ut peccator qui prius insensibilis exstiterat, postmodum et per auctoritatem fortis et per praedicationem sonorus fiat.52\n\nIron is taken out of the earth.\n\nAs if he said in plain speech: \u2018men of strength, who by the sharpest swords of their tongues are become iron in this pitched battle of the defending of the faith, were one time but \u2018earth\u2019 in the lowest sphere of actions.\u2019 For to man on his sinning it was spoken; Earth thou art, and unto earth shalt thou return. But \u2018iron is taken out of the earth,\u2019 when the hardy champion of the Church is separated from an earthly course of conduct, which he before maintained. Accordingly he ought not to be contemned in any thing whatever, that he was, who has already begun to be that which he was not. Was not Matthew found in the earth, who, involved in earthly matters, served the business of the receipt of custom? But having been taken out of the earth, he was strengthened into the forcibleness of iron, in that by his tongue, as by the sharpest sword, the Lord in the enforcing of the Gospel pierced the hearts of unbelievers. And he that before was weak and contemptible by his earthly occupations, was afterwards made strong for heavenly preachings. Hence it is yet further subjoined; And the stone being melted with heat is turned into brass.\n\nThen is \u2018the stone dissolved with heat,\u2019 when the heart that is hard and cold to the fire of divine love is touched by that same fire of divine love, and melted in the glowing warmth of the Spirit, that to the life that follows it should burn with the heat of its longings, which life on hearing of before, it remained uninfluenced. By the power of which same heat, he is at once softened down to love and invigorated to practice, that as before he was hard in the love of the world, so he should afterwards give himself out strong unto the love of God, and what he declined to give ear to before, he should henceforth begin both to believe and to preach. And so, the stone being dissolved with heat is turned into brass, because the hardened mind, being melted by the fire of love from Above, is changed to true strength. So that the sinner that was before unmoved should afterwards be made at once strong in respect of authority, and sounding in respect of preaching.53\n\nThe last line of this passage, \u2018ut peccator qui prius insensibilis exstiterat, postmodum et per auctoritatem fortis et per praedicationem sonorus fiat\u2019, could be deemed to have the same ambiguity or double meaning as Parens scientiarum. The translation quoted above, \u2018So that the sinner that was before unmoved should afterwards be made at once strong in respect of authority, and sounding in respect of preaching\u2019, has the sinner transformed into a preacher, but he could also be \u2018made strong by authority and resonant by preaching\u2019. Earlier in the passage, however, there is no such possibility: \u2018fortis postmodum factus est ad caelestia praedicamenta\u2019 (translated above as \u2018he \u2026 was afterwards made strong for heavenly preachings\u2019) and \u2018et quod ante audire renuebat, iam et credere et praedicare incipiat\u2019 (\u2018and what he declined to give ear to before, he should henceforth begin both to believe and to preach\u2019) both clearly indicate a transformation that produces preachers.\n\nThe opening passage of Parens scientiarum was clearly modelled on Gregory\u2019s Moralia in Job. Relatively succinct in itself, it thus invoked a much more substantial vision of the way in which men could be changed to become preachers. While true to the statutes of 1215 in its commitment to key monastic ideals, it added a strong statement of the transformative power of the university. Perhaps this emphasis on transformation owed something to monastic culture, but it also marked the university out as very different. Parens scientiarum explained that the university\u2019s transformative power enabled the university to produce preachers, and thus to assist the church in its pastoral mission. In part this was a response to the particular crisis that the pope had been working to resolve: the friars\u2019 refusal to suspend teaching and to disperse from Paris had generated tensions between the friars and the secular masters, and it made sense for the pope to stress their common purpose. But it was also a huge programmatic statement. This was not an isolated expression of the university\u2019s obligation to train preachers, and preaching was soon established as an enduring feature of university life. Moreover, the Parisian masters of theology in the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries repeatedly asserted their deep commitment to preaching, as a technique by which they would teach their students, as a key aspect of the pastoral work that they would teach their students to perform, and as the means by which they and their students would bring about reform of both clergy and laity.54 The opening of Parens scientiarum was the most public expression of their ideal. It also made the point that when people dealt with the students and masters of Paris, they had to realize that they were not dealing with a disorderly mob, whatever the immediate appearances, but with a body of great religious significance.\n\nParens scientiarum then tackled a series of issues that had caused problems in the past, beginning with the granting of teaching licences by the chancellor. Every chancellor had to take an oath only to grant licences to teach theology and canon law to those who were worthy. To establish whether or not a candidate was worthy, he had, \u2018in the presence of all masters of theology in the city and other respectable and learned men by whom the truth can be learned\u2019, to \u2018make diligent inquiry as to the life, knowledge, facility, and also the promise and hope of success and other points which are required in such cases\u2019. For their part, masters of theology and canon law had to swear to \u2018furnish faithful testimony on the aforesaid points\u2019. The chancellor was further bound to observe the confidentiality of these references. Regarding licences in arts and medicine, the chancellor made a similar promise to \u2018examine the masters in good faith\u2019 and \u2018admit only the deserving\u2019.55\n\nNext, the bull recognized the university\u2019s status as a legal corporation. They were granted \u2018the function of making due constitutions or ordinances\u2019 regarding a list of issues much like that contained in the 1215 statutes, and \u2018of duly punishing rebels against those constitutions or ordinances by expulsion from your society\u2019. But Gregory went a step further than the 1215 statutes.\n\nAnd if it chance that the rental of lodgings is taken from you or that \u2013 which God forbid \u2013 injury or enormous excess be inflicted on you or any of you, such as death or mutilation of a limb, unless, after due complaint has been lodged, satisfaction is given within fifteen days, it shall be permitted to you to suspend lectures until condign satisfaction is given. And if any of you shall have been unjustly imprisoned, it shall be right for you, unless the injury ceases when complaint is made, to stop lectures immediately, if it shall seem expedient.56\n\nGregory thus acknowledged their right to strike, officially granting them the power that had been specifically denied in the statutes of 1215, and that had just proved so effective.\n\nThe way in which the bishop of Paris exercised his jurisdiction had caused many problems, and the bull now turned to this thorny matter. The bishop of Paris was ordered to punish wrongdoers in a manner such that \u2018the honour of the scholars is preserved and crimes do not remain unpunished\u2019. Any scholar arrested on \u2018probable suspicion\u2019 had to be granted bail. If a scholar had to be incarcerated, it had to be in the bishop\u2019s prison because the chancellor was forbidden to have a prison. No scholar was to be arrested for debt. There was to be no charge for lifting a ban of excommunication. Returning to the licence to teach, the chancellor was not to exact any kind of oath or payment in return for the licence.57 The bull made it clear, however, that the university had a responsibility to maintain order amongst its members. The summer vacation was not to last for more than a month, and bachelors were permitted to continue lecturing in that time. Scholars were not to bear arms in the town, and the university was not to defend \u2018disturbers of the peace and of studies\u2019. Scholarly privileges were not to be accorded to men who pretended to be scholars but did not in fact go to classes or acknowledge any master.58 In short, the university had to do its part to prevent rowdy behaviour escalating into a crisis, and to ensure that it did not inadvertently protect young men who were not studying at all. Doubtless this part of the bull addressed some of the concerns of the bishop, king and townspeople.\n\nThe bull then turned to the curriculum. It did not attempt to set out complete programmes of study for each subject; full regulations about what was to be studied, and how long was to be spent at each stage, were drawn up and frequently revised within the various faculties during the thirteenth century.59 Two instructions were, however, given to masters of arts. The first concerned the set texts to be used in ordinary lectures on grammar. The second offered the prospect that the ban on teaching Aristotelian natural philosophy might soon be relaxed: the prohibited books were not to be used until they had been \u2018examined and purged from all suspicion of errors\u2019, a task that was never in fact accomplished by the committee that Gregory subsequently established.60 For those studying and teaching theology, a major issue was addressed. They were to \u2018strive to exercise themselves praiseworthily in the faculty which they profess and not show themselves philosophers but endeavour to know God\u2019 and to \u2018dispute in the schools concerning those questions only which can be settled by theological works and the treatises of the holy fathers\u2019.61 This was an attempt to define the subject matter and methods appropriate for study in the faculty of theology, and Gregory IX had already made his point to the masters of theology in a letter of 1228.62\n\nThere followed a section concerning the property of scholars who died without leaving a will. The bull established procedures for notifying the heirs and giving them the opportunity to claim the property, otherwise it was to be used for the benefit of the deceased\u2019s soul.63 Finally, the bull called on the king to respect the privileges of the masters and students, and to fine those who wronged them. In making this point, the bull returned to its opening theme. The masters and students who had been wronged and who had left the university seemed \u2018to have pled not so much their own case as the common cause\u2019. The pope gave his orders to the king \u2018with the general need and utility of the church in view\u2019.64 The university\u2019s privileges had to be respected because of its value to the whole church.\n\nHaving examined Philip Augustus\u2019 charter of 1200, the statutes of 1215, and Parens scientiarum, and the circumstances in which these documents were produced, it is clear that the students and masters of Paris were frequently treated as a single community, and that they were capable of collective action. More than that, the masters were recognized as a legal corporation and exercised their powers accordingly. Within the university as a whole, there were groups studying and teaching the arts, theology, canon law and medicine.65 Each student was also attached to a particular master. This does not, however, constitute a full picture of the way the university was developing, and it is important to grasp its rapidly growing complexity.\n\nMost strikingly, the documents considered thus far made no mention of the nations that were emerging in the first decades of the thirteenth century. The masters of arts divided themselves into four nations, with arts students gaining affiliation by association with their masters. Exactly when and how this took place is not known: the earliest reference to the nations dates from 1222 and there is firm evidence for a well-developed system by 1249, but their composition and structure continued to evolve in the course of the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries. The four nations were France, Picardy, Normandy and England. Each was a very rough and somewhat arbitrary geographical grouping. Thus by the early fourteenth century the French nation consisted of masters not only from the Ile de France but also from the south of France, Spain, Italy, Greece and the East. The masters of the Picard nation came from the north of France and the Low Countries. The Norman nation was made up of masters from Normandy and Brittany. The English nation included not only English masters but masters from Germany and elsewhere in northern and eastern Europe. Each nation was a distinct and largely autonomous corporation, with its own assembly, seal, statutes, financial arrangements, records and elected officials. Each nation elected a proctor who summoned and chaired the assembly, and carried out key administrative and disciplinary functions. The system was highly democratic in that proctors were entirely subject to their assemblies and held office for no more than a month or six weeks. Together the nations constituted the faculty of arts whose rector was elected by the proctors or four other representatives chosen by the nations. The rector\u2019s period of office was also limited to a month or six weeks until it was extended to three months in 1266. The nations were responsible for organizing the teaching in the arts faculty. They maintained the schools in which the arts students were taught, mostly on the Rue du Fouarre, or \u2018street of straw\u2019, so named because of the straw on which the students sat. They allocated teaching space to the masters, collected fees from the students, and organized payment of the masters. Students were not, however, obliged to attend the schools of their own nation. Many other aspects of life also revolved around the nations. Each nation employed messengers, termed nuntii volantes or \u2018flying messengers\u2019, who travelled between Paris and the lands from which the scholars came, bearing letters, property and money. Eventually they also established arrangements with bankers and merchants in Paris, called nuntii maiores or \u2018greater messengers\u2019, who provided banking services for the masters and students of the nation, arranging the transfer of funds from their families in the territories of the nation, changing money and making loans. The nations also provided the focus for the religious life of their members. The nations celebrated their own patron saints. By the fourteenth century, and probably earlier, the nations made payments to their masters for attending masses and fined them if they failed to turn up. Unsurprisingly, many masters and students felt an overwhelming sense of loyalty to their nation. Throughout the thirteenth century there were conflicts between the nations, some of them extremely violent. They were usually caused by arguments about which nation a particular master should join, disputes over the election of the rector, or the French nation\u2019s resentment that it had no more power than each of the other nations even though it had many more members. In many respects the nations shaped the everyday lives of the majority of masters and students in the university.66\n\nThe faculty of arts developed at the same time as the nations of which it was composed. Its status as a legal corporation with an elected rector at its head was well established by the middle of the thirteenth century. The masters teaching theology, canon law and medicine remained informal groupings until the second half of the century when they too produced written statutes, acquired seals and elected officers, including deans to preside over them. It is impossible to offer statistical analysis of the university in the thirteenth century for lack of evidence; there are, for example, no matriculation records. Nevertheless, it is clear that the faculty of arts was far larger than the others. Taking students and masters together, it has been estimated that the faculty of arts made up about two-thirds of the university. As far as masters were concerned, there were probably never more than ten to sixteen in any one of the higher faculties at any one time, whereas there were probably well over a hundred arts masters. Perhaps because the faculty of arts was so much larger, and perhaps also because the other faculties developed so much later, the rector, the elected head of the faculty of arts, came increasingly to act as the head of the university as a whole. By the end of the thirteenth century, all four faculties were well established as independent corporations. There was, however, a measure of interpenetration. As already mentioned, many students and bachelors in the higher faculties were also masters of arts, and until they became masters in these higher faculties they remained members of their nations in the faculty of arts, at once subject to their jurisdiction and active participants in their governmental processes. Furthermore, students in the faculty of arts had to take an oath of obedience before they could become bachelors. In the developed form of this oath, they had to swear obedience to the rector, whatever their future position might be. Many of the secular masters in the higher faculties, as well as many of the students and bachelors, were therefore bound to the rector by this oath. The federal structure of the university was most strikingly revealed at its general assembly or congregation. It was composed of all the regent masters, chaired by the rector. When a matter required discussion, each nation of the faculty of arts and each of the higher faculties considered the matter separately. Their views were reported by their proctors or deans. The four nations and the three higher faculties cast one vote each, and the decision was carried by the majority of these seven votes.67\n\nWithin and sometimes cutting across the structure of faculties and nations, were a growing number of colleges. The earliest were charitable foundations, developed from or modelled on hospitals, and providing little more than basic accommodation and a small financial grant for a limited number of poor scholars. The first, which became known as the Coll\u00e8ge des Dix-Huit, was set up in 1180 by an Englishman, Jocius of London, on his way back from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. He visited the Hospital of the blessed Mary of Paris, and saw within it a room customarily occupied by poor clerks. Acting on the advice of the dean and chancellor of Paris, he purchased the room for the accommodation of eighteen scholars who would also receive a monthly payment from the alms given to the hospital. In return, the scholars were obliged only to participate in the funerary rituals of those who died in the house and to say nightly prayers. Other colleges were soon established. Some of them admitted only scholars studying a particular subject. Thus the Coll\u00e8ge de Sorbonne, founded around 1257 by the theologian Robert of Sorbon with the active support of Louis IX, provided initially for sixteen theology students, four from each nation, and later for a total of thirty-six. Other colleges only admitted scholars from a particular region. The College of the Treasurer, for example, was founded in 1268 to house and support twelve students of theology and twelve of the arts, all to be \u2018chosen, when the need arises, by the two archdeacons of Grand-Caux and Petit-Caux\u2019, and all to originate \u2018from Grand-Caux and Petit-Caux, if in those two places they find sufficient and fit persons, or if not in the two Caux, at least from the whole diocese of Rouen\u2019.68 Some of these later colleges were highly complex institutions. The Sorbonne in particular regulated the lives of its members in great detail and required them all to participate in its internal management by holding various offices in turn. It also gave a great deal of support to their studies, providing an excellent library and even running special classes for extra revision and practice. The overwhelming majority of students rented houses in groups, boarded with masters, or lodged with townspeople, but for a few the colleges provided essential material support and in some cases even dominated their domestic and scholarly routines.69\n\nA much more challenging degree of complexity was presented by the growing involvement of the friars and other religious orders within the university.70 The friars included some of the university\u2019s most outstanding theologians, but also threatened the means by which the emerging university was asserting its autonomy. Both the Franciscan and the Dominican orders expanded dramatically in the first two decades of the thirteenth century, espousing voluntary poverty and undertaking a universal preaching mission. Right from the start, the Dominicans valued learning and set out to establish themselves in Paris and Bologna. They developed a hierarchical system of schools within the order, with the best students ending up at one of their top schools. Unlike Dominic, Francis had not himself set much store by formal learning, and the Franciscans were much slower to establish a system of education. Before long, however, they too were active as scholars in Paris. Neither order permitted its members to study or teach in the faculty of arts; they came to Paris to study theology. The rest of the university made them welcome, and friars were taught by secular masters of theology. The Dominicans received the house of Saint Jacques and associated rights partly from Jean de Barastre, a secular master of theology who had been asked to teach in their school by Pope Honorius III, and partly from the university as a whole. The Franciscans set up a new convent, the Grand Couvent des Cordeliers, with financial assistance from the king. The friars were not, however, fully tied into the emerging structure of the university. Unless a friar had been a master of arts before converting, for example, he had not taken the oath to obey the statutes of the university that masters of arts took upon inception. As the university\u2019s structure emerged, and as the university acted to assert its privileges, such anomalies began to matter. A critical point was reached when the university went on strike in 1229: the friars refused to suspend their studies, and even opened their schools to secular students who wished to continue their studies in Paris. Moreover, Roland of Cremona was granted the first Dominican chair in theology. After the masters and students returned in 1231, the Dominicans kept their chair and the mendicant schools remained open to secular students. Tension mounted thereafter not only because the friars clearly could not be relied upon to support a strike, but also because their success was damaging the careers of the secular masters. The friars were attracting growing numbers of students, thus reducing the income received by the secular masters of theology. Moreover, by converting secular masters of theology, the friars gained more chairs. In 1231 Alexander of Hales entered the Franciscan order to become the first Franciscan master of theology at Paris. Around the same time John of Saint Giles dramatically took the habit of the Dominicans in the middle of a sermon, thus creating a second Dominican chair of theology. It is not known exactly how professorial succession functioned, but it was clearly accepted that when a chair fell vacant it passed to a master from the same order. When secular masters converted, they therefore reduced the number of chairs available for secular scholars, thus damaging their career opportunities.\n\nThe resentment felt by the secular scholars was soon combined with the sense of grievance held more widely by the secular clergy whose authority and income were diminished when friars, backed by successive popes, preached, heard confession and received pious donations from the laity. Longstanding resentment turned into bitter conflict during the 1250s. Apparently the friars deemed it inappropriate to ask for magisterial status, and the chancellor in 1250 effectively excluded them by only granting a teaching licence if petition were made. Pope Innocent IV ordered the chancellor to grant the licence to any member of a religious order whom he considered to be qualified, whether or not a request had been made. In 1252 the secular masters of theology passed a statute according to which a member of a religious order could only be admitted if his order had a college in Paris, and each college could only have one chair in theology, which threatened the second Dominican chair. At Lent in 1253 disorder in the streets resulted in the provost\u2019s men killing one scholar and arresting others. The university suspended studies until justice was done, but the mendicant masters refused to join the strike, seriously undermining its effect. When the university required all masters to take an oath to act together to obtain justice, the friars again refused and were expelled from the university. In April 1253, the university passed a statute obliging all masters to take an oath to obey the statutes and to go on strike when instructed by the university. The Franciscans eventually agreed, but the Dominicans did not. The Dominican masters were therefore not only expelled but also excommunicated. The Dominicans appealed to Innocent IV, who lifted the ban of excommunication and instructed the university to readmit the Dominicans. The university did not comply, however, and in 1254 it aired its complaints in a letter addressed to all the prelates and scholars in Christendom. The general resentment of the friars seemed to be having an effect when Innocent IV issued the bull Etsi animarum, withdrawing the privileges of the friars with regard to preaching and hearing confession. But Innocent died in December 1254, to be succeeded by Alexander IV who backed the friars in all respects. In April 1255 he came down hard on the University of Paris with the bull Quasi lignum vitae. In it he ordered the reinstatement of the Dominican masters. He instructed the chancellor to grant the teaching licence to as many qualified candidates as he saw fit, thus removing the limit that had been placed on the number of masters from religious orders. Finally, he ruled that studies could only be suspended when such action had the support of two-thirds of the masters in each faculty, which, because of their numbers in the faculty of theology, ensured that the friars and the other religious orders could prevent the university going on strike. When the university refused to obey, all the masters and scholars were excommunicated. They responded by announcing the dissolution of the university and giving up all privileges that had been granted to it, so that there was now no body to which the friars could be readmitted.\n\nThe escalating conflict was accompanied by a polemical battle of increasing bitterness. Secular masters attacked the ideals of voluntary poverty that underpinned the mendicant orders. They also sought the condemnation of the Liber introductorius in evangelium aeternum (\u2018Introduction to the Eternal Gospel\u2019), a work written by a Franciscan studying in Paris called Gerard of Borgo San Donnino, in which he built on the apocalyptic theories of Joachim of Fiore to argue that the Bible had been superseded by the works of Joachim and the clergy by the friars. The most vocal secular master was William of Saint Amour, whose De periculis novissimorum temporum (\u2018On the Perils of the Last Times\u2019) was condemned by the pope in 1256. During the second half of the decade, the secular masters were worn down by constant papal pressure, one after the other accepting the terms of Quasi lignum vitae and seeking absolution. The founding of the College of the Sorbonne was probably a constructive attempt to address the anxieties of the secular theologians in a manner that would not lead to more conflict. After Alexander IV\u2019s death in 1261, his successor, Urban IV, adopted a much more conciliatory attitude, confirming the privileges of the university. It was apparently accepted that the Dominicans should have two regent masters of theology, while the other religious orders could only have one. This was, however, a very uneasy compromise, no more stable than before the open conflicts of the 1250s. Those conflicts had brought about one very significant shift: the university had previously received almost unqualified papal backing in its struggles to be free of episcopal authority, but now the secular masters and students had been on the wrong end of papal authority, while establishing common cause with secular bishops and clergy in their opposition to the friars. The university\u2019s role in ecclesiastical politics was never again to be as straightforward as it had been in the first half of the thirteenth century. Moreover, the tensions between the secular members of the university and the friars remained, and were to flare up on many future occasions. It was impossible to escape from the problems caused by the friars and members of other religious orders who wished to be part of the university and yet to retain their identity as members of wider religious communities.\n\nThe secular students and masters were not, however, \u2018pure\u2019 members of the university, unconnected with the wider world. On the contrary, their need for financial support constantly reminded them of the groups to which they belonged or with which they were associated outside the university. The cost of university education was high, and probably increased from the middle of the thirteenth century. Many scholars depended on their families for money and material assistance. Most were from lesser noble families or the wealthy urban classes. Great noble families rarely sent their sons to university until much later. Few from the peasantry or the poorer urban classes could find the means to attend university, and even fewer could stay at university for long enough to become masters in the higher faculties, though there were some striking exceptions. Model letters reflect the way in which scholars found it necessary to seek assistance from their parents, siblings and clerical uncles. Another source of income was the holding of ecclesiastical benefices. A scholar might be permitted to employ another cleric to do the work while he himself was non-resident because he was at university. He paid less than the income he received, and kept the difference for himself. It is not known how many students and masters were funded in this way, but successive popes strongly encouraged the practice. In 1219, for example, Honorius III issued the bull Super speculam, permitting clerics to be non-resident for five years while studying theology at Paris, a privilege that was soon applied to other universities. Many popes granted benefices to individuals so that they might continue their studies, though whether or not an individual actually received his benefice depended on the local bishop\u2019s readiness to comply with papal wishes. Popes were even prepared to allow some scholars to hold more than one benefice at the same time, a financial necessity if the income from a single benefice was insufficient. From the early fourteenth century, universities regularly sent the pope ranked lists, or rolls (rotuli), of candidates for benefices. This funding mechanism was used to support not only theologians, but also men studying the arts and canon law. Many scholars therefore held offices in churches outside Paris and, despite their non-residence, were drawn into the local politics of the communities of which they were now members. Financial support was also provided by wealthy patrons. Royal backing could be very generous. While Henry III of England directed most of his educational patronage to Oxford, he nevertheless gave money to several Parisian students. At the end of the thirteenth century, Philip IV of France made systematic payments to scholars at Paris, as well as to two colleges, and it may be that this practice had begun earlier in the century. Other patrons included nobles, high-ranking churchmen, prominent townspeople and rich academics. Sometimes they simply funded individuals for a period of time. On occasion, however, especially in their wills, they established \u2018flying scholarships\u2019, or bursae volantes. Income from property or invested capital was used to provide grants to scholars, termed \u2018flying scholarships\u2019 because the holder did not have to live in a specific college. Usually, however, certain conditions had to be met: these might include coming from a particular area, attending a specific university, studying a particular subject, being studious or being poor. Financial management and responsibility for selecting holders was generally placed in the hands of the founder\u2019s family or representatives of an ecclesiastical institution. To give just one example, in her will of 1273 Margaret, countess of Flanders and Hainaut, left \u00a3300 from which the annual income was to be given to students from Flanders and Hainaut studying at Paris as chosen by either the chancellor of Paris, the Dominican prior, a representative of the Franciscans, or by two of these three. While patrons may have been primarily motivated by charity, the recipients of their generosity were bound to feel informal ties of obligation and to be drawn into the political, regional or ecclesiastical networks through which patronage operated.71\n\nThere was another important respect in which students and masters looked beyond the university to a wider world: very few scholars spent their entire lives at university. Most students studied for only a few years, with no intention of \u2018completing\u2019 the formal course. Only a tiny minority went on to teach as masters, and many masters left after a brief spell as regents, often the minimum required by the statutes. A relatively small number of secular masters of theology spent their whole careers as regent masters. Otherwise, even those who enjoyed substantial teaching careers usually departed well before the end of their working lives. Some went to take up teaching posts elsewhere, but increasing numbers worked in secular and ecclesiastical government. Masters had extremely good career prospects in the church, many becoming prelates, and others taking up positions in cathedral chapters. The French and English kings also employed increasing numbers of men who could claim the title of \u2018master\u2019, with the English kings using them in far greater numbers for most of the thirteenth century. It is much harder to track the careers of those who did not become masters, but there is little doubt that many of them staffed the growing bureaucracies of ecclesiastical and secular government.72 In some cases this basic career pattern has made it possible for historians to explore the role of ideas in politics by studying both the academic work of individual scholars and their subsequent actions in high office.73 It also meant that the university had a substantial number of alumni, some of whom were very powerful men. In the fourteenth century there were occasions when the university tried to force such men to act in the university\u2019s interests by reminding them of oaths they had taken to uphold the university\u2019s privileges and statutes, and charging them with perjury when they did not take the steps required of them.74 No such case is known in the thirteenth century, but there were frequent contacts between the university and its former members, and occasions when the latter looked to the university for support. In the 1280s bitter conflict again broke out between the secular clergy of France and the friars. The secular clergy maintained that, despite papal privileges permitting friars to preach and hear confession without authorization from the local clergy, all members of the church were still bound to confess all their sins to their own parish priests every year. Both the friars and the secular clergy wanted to be able to claim the support of the university. In 1286 the prelates of the kingdom of France met at Paris and summoned all the masters and students from all the faculties to hear their case. Four archbishops and twenty bishops were present. The archbishop of Bourges, Simon of Beaulieu, explained that they had come to complain to the masters and students about the friars\u2019 insolence \u2018because what we are, you will be; for I believe that there is not a prelate amongst us today who has not been taken from this university\u2019.75 Clearly the archbishop expected the masters and students to look into their own futures, and to identify with the interests of the secular prelates. Earlier in the century, Robert of Courson had been well aware of the extent to which this might be the case, and had made it clear that to study theology in order to achieve promotion to a prelacy was to commit mental simony.76 Many, however, were attracted to the university precisely because of the career opportunities that they expected or hoped to be on offer as a result.77 Even those who espoused the ideals of Parens scientiarum expected men transformed by the university to leave. The university was always fundamentally outward-looking.\n\nThe university that emerged in Paris in the late twelfth century and continued to develop throughout the thirteenth century was radically different from the schools that had preceded it. The university had become established as a corporation enjoying privileges granted by the king and pope. Students undertook programmes of study which, if they chose to complete them and if they did so successfully, led to the award of degrees. The degree qualified the master to teach, and he was obliged to do so for a minimum period, so the system perpetuated itself, turning the most successful students into masters through a systematic process of scholarly formation. Masters, rather than students, now had control. While there might still be competition for students, they were no longer the decisive source of funding, and they no longer made and broke magisterial careers. Students advanced their careers not by competing with their masters, but by competing with each other, in large part for the approval of their masters. They accepted the authority of their masters because they hoped to wield the same authority in their turn. The time it took to gain academic credibility was critical. The twelfth-century student felt that he was ready to assume magisterial status so quickly that he could rival his master, and the master had no means of restraining him, and limited power to offer eventual reward. The thirteenth-century student was slowed down by the structured curriculum and the need to overcome the series of obstacles that led to degrees, and the master could make him wait as he went through that sequence of stages before eventually enjoying magisterial status in the next academic generation.78\n\nEvery aspect of both study and life was regulated by the institution, and this institutional regulation was of huge ideological significance. Beginning with the statutes of 1215, the university\u2019s formal documents adopted key monastic values with regard to learning: the belief that only by living virtuously was it possible to think properly, and that masters had to accept responsibility for their impact on their students. In 1231 Parens scientiarum added the powerful vision of the university transforming the men who studied there, turning them into preachers. These formal pronouncements gave the university ideological security, freeing the scholars from the monastic critiques of the twelfth century. In so doing, it also opened the university up to monks and friars. Whatever the ideological debt to monastic culture, however, the secular masters and students were not turned into monks. The university was an extremely complex community of communities, offering masters and students a range of identities. The university as a whole was a single community. Within it, there were other communities, and communities within communities, and communities overlapping with each other: faculties, nations and colleges. There were also communities that straddled the university\u2019s conceptual boundaries: the friars and the other religious orders. All of these communities were solemnly defined, with legal privileges and rules, and capable of collective action. Formal documents drew up boundaries, created rituals of great symbolic importance, established routine practices, and claimed loyalty at times of crisis, constructing powerful identities for their members. Underpinning all these structures, each master was surrounded by the students who gained admission to the university by association with him. Individuals, moreover, were members of groups that existed with varying degrees of formality primarily outside the university: families, local churches and patronage networks. Former members of the university offered a vision of the careers that might be taken up when men left the university, and suggested their future interests. Being a member of the university therefore meant very different things for different men. The multiplicity of communities did not go unnoticed. Philip the Chancellor, who held office at the time of the \u2018great dispersion\u2019 in 1229, complained in a sermon that to make a universitas out of diverse nations was to create a monster. It was a monster with four heads, namely the four faculties.79\n\nUnsurprisingly, in view of its structural disjunctures, the university environment was at times highly volatile. There were moments of conflict when individual masters and students had to decide where their loyalties lay: when nation fell out with nation, when secular clerics felt threatened by the friars, or when students brawled with townspeople, to give a few of the most common examples. It might seem as if the instability of the twelfth-century schools had not entirely disappeared, but that would be to underestimate the extent to which, through a process of institutionalization, the university had become a locus of power and authority, both within the institution itself and in relation to the rest of society. Individuals were tied into the corporate structure by statutes and oaths. If a man stayed in the university for any length of time, he soon acquired a stake in its continued existence. As he worked his way through the curriculum and up the career ladder, he took on responsibility for teaching, and assumed offices within the various communities of which he was a member, thus gaining status and authority. Whatever the individual\u2019s fate, however, the major conflicts had become collective rather than individual. There was, moreover, a permanence to the university as a community, and to the manifold communities that it embraced. However desperate the rhetoric of the moment, after the \u2018great dispersion\u2019 ended in 1231 the existence of the various corporate bodies was not seriously threatened. The university was culturally distinct, protected by a discourse that combined monastic ideals with a bold claim to transform men into agents of the church\u2019s pastoral mission, and it was not going to go away.\n\nThe intellectual excitement of the twelfth-century schools is readily detected in narrative accounts of particular lives, some of which were explored in the first chapter. The thirteenth-century university generated no such material, but the mountain of academic work that survives in written form testifies to the intellectual commitment of its scholars. Aristotle\u2019s philosophical and scientific works were still being rediscovered and translated from Greek and Arabic, and they were read and interpreted in conjunction with the work of Arab and Jewish scholars who had already grappled with these texts. There are many fine surveys of developments in philosophical and theological thought in the thirteenth century, and just as many brilliant monographs on individual thinkers. The focus here will be on two figures whose influence on others was recognized in the thirteenth century and later, and who articulated different approaches to knowing. Bonaventure was deeply influenced by Augustine and in many respects represented the theological mainstream in the thirteenth century, although there has been much disagreement about the nature of his response to Aristotle and the extent to which he incorporated Aristotelian ideas.80 Thomas Aquinas, however, unquestionably made systematic use of Aristotle to create a powerful synthesis of different traditions."}, {"url": "https://www.catholiceducation.org/en/education/catholic-contributions/the-catholic-church-and-the-creation-of-the-university.html", "page_content": "The substantial output of medieval scholarship that was produced in the twentieth century should have put this inane caricature to rest once and for all, but here we have another case of specialized knowledge that hasn\"t managed to trickle down to the general public.\n\nIt was, after all, in the High Middle Ages that the university came into existence. The university, which developed and matured at the height of Catholic Europe, was a new phenomenon in European history. Nothing like it had existed in ancient Greece or Rome. The institution that we recognize today, with its faculties, courses of study, examinations, and degrees, as well as the familiar distinction between undergraduate and graduate study, comes to us directly from the medieval world. And it is no surprise that the Church should have done so much to foster the nascent university system since, according to historian Lowrie Daly, it was \"the only institution in Europe that showed consistent interest in the preservation and cultivation of knowledge.\"\n\nThe precise origins of the very first universities are lost in obscurity, though the picture becomes ever clearer as we move into the thirteenth century. We cannot give exact dates for the appearance of universities at Paris and Bologna, Oxford and Cambridge, since they evolved over a period of time \u2014 the former beginning as cathedral schools, and the latter as informal gatherings of masters and students. But we may safely say that the process occurred during the latter half of the twelfth century.\n\nIn order to identify a particular medieval school as a university, we look for certain characteristic features. For one thing, a university possessed a core of required texts, on which professors would lecture and to which they would add their own insights. A university was also characterized by well-defined academic programs lasting a more or less fixed number of years, as well as by the granting of degrees. The granting of a degree, since it entitled the recipient to be called master, amounted to admitting new people to the teaching guild. Although the universities often struggled with outside authorities for self-government, they generally attained it. They also desired and received legal recognition as a corporation.\n\nThe papacy played a central if not exclusive role in the establishment and encouragement of the universities. Naturally, the granting of a charter to a university was one indication of this papal role. Some 81 universities had been established by the time of the Reformation. Of these 33 possessed a papal charter, 15 a royal or imperial one, 20 possessed both, and 13 had none. In addition, it was the accepted view that a university could not award degrees without the approbation of pope, king, or emperor. Pope Innocent IV officially granted this privilege to Oxford University, for example, in 1254. The pope (in fact) and the emperor (in theory) possessed authority over all of Christendom, and for this reason it was to them that a university typically had to turn for the right to issue degrees. Equipped with the approval of one or the other of these universal figures, the university\"s degrees would be respected throughout all of Christendom. Degrees awarded only by the approval of national monarchs, on the other hand, were considered valid only in the kingdom in which they were issued.\n\nIn certain cases, including in particular the universities at Bologna, Oxford, and Paris, the master\"s degree entitled the bearer to teach anywhere in the world (ius ubique docendi). It was in Pope Gregory IX\"s document pertaining to the University of Toulouse in 1233 where we first see the formula, and this document became a model for the future. The idea was that such scholars could freely join other faculties in western Europe, though in practice each institution preferred to examine the candidate itself before admitting him. Still, this privilege, conferred by the popes, doubtless played a significant role in encouraging the dissemination of knowledge and fostering the idea of an international scholarly community.\n\nAnd it is no surprise that the Church should have done so much to foster the nascent university system since, according to historian Lowrie Daly, it was \"the only institution in Europe that showed consistent interest in the preservation and cultivation of knowledge.\"\n\nThe papal role was not confined to these matters, but extended to a great many others as well. A glance at the history of the medieval university reveals that conflicts between the university and the people or government of the area were not uncommon. Local townsmen were frequently ambivalent in their posture toward university students: on the one hand, the existence of the university was a boon for local merchants and for economic activity in general since the students brought money to spend, but on the other, university students then as now could be irresponsible and unruly. As a modern commentator puts it, inhabitants of medieval university towns loved the money but hated the students. As a result, students and their professors were often heard to complain about the treatment they received.\n\nIn this atmosphere, the Church provided special protection to university students by offering them what was known as benefit of clergy. Clergymen in medieval Europe enjoyed a special legal status in that, first, it was an extraordinarily serious crime to lay a hand on them, and second, they had the right to have their cases heard in an ecclesiastical rather than a secular court. University students, as actual or potential clerical candidates, would also enjoy these privileges. Secular rulers often extended similar protections \u2014 as when, in 1200, Philip Augustus of France granted and confirmed such privileges to students of the University of Paris, permitting them to have their cases heard in what would certainly be a more sympathetic court than that of the local town.\n\nThe popes intervened on behalf of the university on numerous occasions, as when Pope Honorius III (1216-27) sided with the scholars at Bologna in 1220 against infringements on their liberties. When the chancellor of Paris insisted on an oath of loyalty to himself personally, Pope Innocent III (1198-1216) intervened. Later, when the Bishop of Paris and the chancellor of the university continued to encroach upon the institutional autonomy of the institution, it was the Pope, Gregory IX, who in 1231 issued the bull Parens Scientiarum on behalf of the masters of Paris. In this document the Pope effectively granted the University of Paris the right to self-government, whereby it could make its own rules pertaining to courses and studies. The Pope also granted the university a separate papal jurisdiction, thus emancipating the institution from the interference of what had been an overbearing diocesan authority. \"With this document,\" writes one scholar, \"the university comes of age and appears in legal history as a fully formed intellectual corporation for the advancement and training of scholars.\" The papacy, writes another, \"has to be considered a major force in shaping the autonomy of the Paris guild [i.e., the organized body of scholars at Paris].\"\n\nIn that same document, the Pope also granted a privilege known as cessatio \u2014 the right of the university to suspend its lectures and to go on a general strike. Just cause included such grounds as \"refusal of the right to fix ceiling prices for lodgings, an injury or mutilation of a student for which suitable satisfaction had not been given within fifteen days, [or] the unlawful imprisonment of a student.\" By supporting the universities in their right to suspend lectures and stating reasons that would constitute adequate justification for so doing, the Pope made an important contribution to the cultivation of the kind of peaceful and settled environment that conduces to scholarship and learning.\n\nIt became common for universities to bring their grievances to the Pope in Rome. On several occasions, the pope even intervened to force university authorities to pay professors their salaries; Popes Boniface VIII, Clement V, Clement VI, and Gregory IX all had to take such measures. Little wonder, then, that one historian has declared that the universities\" \"most consistent and greatest protector was the Pope of Rome. He it was who granted, increased, and protected their privileged status in a world of often conflicting jurisdictions.\"\n\nAt these great institutions students studied not only many of the standard liberal arts disciplines but also civil and canon law, natural philosophy, medicine, and theology. As the universities took shape in the twelfth century they were the happy beneficiaries of the fruits of what some scholars have called the renaissance of the twelfth century. Massive translation work brought forth many of the great works of the ancient world that had been lost to Western scholarship for too many centuries, including the geometry of Euclid, the logic, metaphysics, natural philosophy, and ethics of Aristotle, and the medical work of Galen. Legal studies began to flourish as well, particularly at Bologna, when the Digest, the key component of the sixth-century Emperor Justinian\"s Corpus Juris Civilis (a compendium of Roman law, much admired from its origins to the present day), was rediscovered.\n\nAt these great institutions students studied not only many of the standard liberal arts disciplines but also civil and canon law, natural philosophy, medicine, and theology.\n\nThe distinction between undergraduate and graduate education was made in the early universities more or less as it is today. And as today, some places were especially known for academic distinction in particular subject areas \u2014 Bologna thus became renowned for the graduate study of law, as did Paris in theology and the arts.\n\nThe undergraduate, or artist (that is, a student of the liberal arts), attended lectures, took part in occasional disputations in class, and attended the formal disputations of others. His professors \u2014 or masters, as they were known \u2014 typically lectured on an important text, often drawn from classical antiquity. There was heavy emphasis on Aristotle. Alongside their commentaries on these ancient texts, professors gradually began to include a series of questions to be resolved through logical argument. Over time, the questions essentially displaced the commentaries. Here was the origin of the question method of scholastic argument, of the kind found in St. Thomas Aquinas\" Summa Theologiae.\n\nSuch questions were also posed in what was known as the ordinary disputation. The master would assign students to argue one or the other side of a question. When their interaction had ceased, it was then up to the master to \"determine,\" or resolve, the question. To obtain the Bachelor of Arts degree, a student was expected to determine a question by himself to the satisfaction of the faculty. (Before being permitted to do so, however, he had to prove that he possessed adequate preparation and was fit to be evaluated.) This kind of emphasis on careful argument, on marshaling a persuasive case for each side of a question, and on resolving a dispute by means of rational tools sounds something like the opposite of the intellectual life that most people associate with medieval man. But that was how the degree-granting process operated. (I myself have taken mischievous delight at imagining poor Messrs. Knight and Lomas trying to defend their anti-Catholic nonsense before an audience of true scholars.)\n\nOnce the student had determined, therefore, he was awarded the Bachelor of Arts degree. The process would typically take four to five years. At that point, the student could simply declare his education completed, as most bachelors of arts do today, and look for remunerative work (even as a teacher, perhaps in some of the lesser schools of Europe) or decide to continue his studies and pursue a graduate degree. The so-called master\"s degree, to which satisfactory completion of his graduate study entitled him, would render him qualified to teach within the university system.\n\nIn order to begin further studies on the road to becoming a qualified teacher, or simply to pursuing desirable posts in civil or ecclesiastical service, the prospective master had to demonstrate competence within the canon of important works of Western civilization. This was before he petitioned for his license to teach, or licentiate, which was awarded between the bachelor\"s and master\"s degrees. We get some idea of the advanced student\"s background from a modern historian\"s overview of texts with which that student was expected to be familiar:\n\nAccording to historian of science Edward Grant, the creation of the university, the commitment to reason and rational argument, and the overall spirit of inquiry that characterized medieval intellectual life amounted to \"a gift from the Latin Middle Ages to the modern world\u2026though it is a gift that may never be acknowledged.\n\nAfter his bachelorship, and before he petitioned for his license to teach, the student must have \"heard at Paris or in another university\" the following Aristotelian works: Physics, On Generation and Corruption, On the Heavens, and the Parva Naturalia; namely, the treatises of Aristotle On Sense and Sensation, On Waking and Sleeping, On Memory and Remembering, On the Length and Shortness of Life. He must also have heard (or have plans to hear) On the Metaphysics, and have attended lectures on the mathematical books. [Historian Hastings] Rashdall, when speaking of the Oxford curriculum, gives the following list of works, to be read by the bachelor between the period of his determination and his inception (mastership): books on the liberal arts: in grammar, Priscian; in rhetoric, Aristotle\"s Rhetoric (three terms), or the Topics of Boethius (bk. iv.), or Cicero\"s Nova Rhetorica or Ovid\"s Metamorphoses or Poetria Virgilii; in logic, Aristotle\"s De Interpretatione (three terms) or Boethius\" Topics (bks. 1-3) or the Prior Analytics or Topics (Aristotle); in arithmetic and in music, Boethius; in geometry, Euclid, Alhacen, or Vitellio, Perspectiva; in astronomy, Theorica Planetarum (two terms), or Ptolemy, Almagesta. In natural philosophy the additional works are: the Physics or On the Heavens (three terms) or On the Properties of the Elements or the Meteorics or On Vegetables and Plants or On the Soul or On Animals or any of the Parva naturalia; in moral philosophy, the Ethics or Economics or Politics of Aristotle for three terms, and in metaphysics, the Metaphysics for two terms or for three terms if the candidate had not determined.\n\nThe process for acquiring the licentiate generally consisted of another demonstration of knowledge and a commitment to certain principles of university life. Once this process was complete, the license was officially awarded. At Ste. Genevi\u00e8ve, the person to be licensed knelt in front of the vice-chancellor, who said:\n\nI, by the authority vested in me by the apostles Peter and Paul, give you the license for lecturing, reading, disputing, and determining and for exercising other scholastic and magisterial acts both in the faculty of arts at Paris and elsewhere, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.\n\nThe precise length of time that typically passed between reception of the licentiate and reception of the master\"s degree (which apparently required knowledge of a wider array of books) is difficult to determine, but one reasonable estimate is that it ranged between six months and three years. One candidate, who had perhaps already read all the required books, is recorded as having received both distinctions on the same day.\n\nThe university and the intellectual life it fostered played an indispensable role in Western civilization. Christopher Dawson observed that from the days of the earliest universities \"the higher studies were dominated by the technique of logical discussion \u2014 the quaestio and the public disputation which so largely determined the form of medieval philosophy even in its greatest representatives. \"Nothing,\" says Robert of Sorbonne, \"is known perfectly which has not been masticated by the teeth of disputation,\" and the tendency to submit every question, from the most obvious to the most abstruse, to this process of mastication not only encouraged readiness of wit and exactness of thought but above all developed that spirit of criticism and methodic doubt to which Western culture and science have owed so much.\"\n\nAccording to historian of science Edward Grant, the creation of the university, the commitment to reason and rational argument, and the overall spirit of inquiry that characterized medieval intellectual life amounted to \"a gift from the Latin Middle Ages to the modern world\u2026though it is a gift that may never be acknowledged. Perhaps it will always retain the status it has had for the past four centuries as the best-kept secret of Western civilization.\""}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Philip-III-duke-of-Burgundy", "page_content": "Philip III, byname Philip the Good or French Philippe Le Bon, (born July 31, 1396, Dijon, Burgundy [now in France]\u2014died June 15, 1467, Bruges [now Brugge, Belgium]), the most important of the Valois dukes of Burgundy (reigned 1419\u201367) and the true founder of the Burgundian state that rivaled France in the 15th century.\n\nPhilip was the son of John the Fearless and Margaret of Bavaria. When he became duke of Burgundy at the age of 23, his first aim was to extricate himself as expeditiously as possible from the French affairs in which his father, Duke John, had been embroiled and that had led to his assassination in 1419. Holding the dauphin Charles (later Charles VII of France) answerable for his father\u2019s murder, Philip signed the Treaty of Troyes with King Henry V of England in 1420, a treaty in which the queen of France, Isabella of Bavaria, conferred succession to the French crown on Henry and partitioned France among England, Burgundy, and her disinherited son, the dauphin Charles.\n\nPhilip paid little attention to potential conquests in France and preferred to remain uncommitted there. He maintained his alliance with England\u2014apart from a break in 1435\u201339, when he tried but failed to conquer Calais\u2014but seldom gave England serious help against France. On the other hand, especially after 1435, when he acknowledged Charles as king of France and accepted his disavowal of the murder of John the Fearless, he did his best to be on reasonably good terms with the king of France. His real interests lay not in France but in the development of his own territories.\n\nBehind an impressive, if bizarre, facade of courtly splendour and chivalrous festivity, Duke Philip the Good was an aggressive opportunist who, especially in the first half of his ducal reign, concentrated on the task of attacking and swallowing up his smaller neighbours. Namur was purchased in 1421; Hainaut fell to Burgundian arms in 1427; the rich duchy of Brabant was taken over in 1430; and the combined counties of Holland and Zeeland were conquered in a long series of personally led and bitterly contested campaigns between 1424 and 1433. The crowning achievement of Philip\u2019s policy of territorial expansion was his conquest of the duchy of Luxembourg in 1443.\n\nIt was under Philip that the richness and extravagance of court life in the Middle Ages reached its apogee. Philip, whose personal tastes in clothes were relatively simple, loved to surround himself with all the pomp and pageantry that the age could command. In 1430 he founded a new order of chivalry, a Burgundian version of the British Order of the Garter, called the Toison d\u2019Or, or Golden Fleece, membership of which was limited to 24 noblemen of proven valour and wide renown. Court was held at Brussels or Bruges, in Brabant and Flanders, respectively; or at Hesdin or Lille, in northeastern France; or at some other centre.\n\nThe best artists of the day were employed by Philip to paint his banners and pennons, to decorate his palaces and carriages, and to illuminate what was probably the finest collection of picture books ever put together. The artist Jan van Eyck accompanied a ducal embassy to Portugal to paint the king\u2019s daughter Isabella, so that Philip could see her likeness before committing himself to marrying her. Sculptors worked on tombs at Philip\u2019s command, and exquisite tapestries were embroidered under his personal supervision. A host of musicians, jewelers, goldsmiths, and other craftsmen and artists were employed at his court. The bawdy stories exchanged by Philip and his courtiers after dinner were collected into Les Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles, or \u201cThe Hundred New Short Stories.\u201d\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Other entertainment was held from time to time in the form of tournaments or passages of arms, and Duke Philip\u2019s courtiers roamed about Europe issuing challenges and doing battle with their colleagues from other lands.\n\nDuke Philip was tall, handsome, and bony in figure; his face was long and lean, with a high forehead, prominent nose, and bushy eyebrows. Excellent in health, he enjoyed hunting, tennis, archery, and jousting in his youth, but he turned in his later years to making clogs, repairing broken glasses, and soldering broken knives. His many natural children caused the bishop of Tournai (himself born to unmarried parents) to criticize him for what the ecclesiastic called \u201cthe weakness of the flesh.\u201d Some were brought up at court; others went into the church. His mistresses were kept out of affairs of state, and it was mere geographic convenience and economy that caused him to maintain several at once in the different towns where he held court. Self-assured and flamboyant almost to the end, he died, possibly of pneumonia, at Bruges in 1467."}, {"url": "https://static.hlt.bme.hu/semantics/external/pages/Petrus_Hispanus/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Paris.html", "page_content": "\"University of the Sorbonne\" redirects here. It is not to be confused with Sorbonne University or other universities\n\nThe University of Paris (French: Universit\u00e9 de Paris), metonymically known as the Sorbonne ( French: [s\u0254\u0281b\u0254n]), was a university in Paris, France, active 1150\u20131793, and 1806\u20131970.\n\nEmerging around 1150 as a corporation associated with the cathedral school of Notre Dame de Paris, it was considered the second oldest university in Europe.[1] Officially chartered in 1200 by King Philip II of France and recognised in 1215 by Pope Innocent III, it was later often nicknamed after its theological College of Sorbonne, in turn founded by Robert de Sorbon and chartered by French King Saint Louis around 1257.[citation needed]\n\nInternationally highly reputed for its academic performance in the humanities ever since the Middle Ages \u2013 notably in theology and philosophy \u2013 it introduced several academic standards and traditions that have endured ever since and spread internationally, such as doctoral degrees and student nations. Vast numbers of popes, royalty, scientists, and intellectuals were educated at the University of Paris. A few of the colleges of the time are still visible close to Pantheon and Luxembourg Gardens: Coll\u00e8ge des Bernardins (18, rue de Poissy 75005), Hotel de Cluny (6, Place Paul Painleve 75005), College Sainte Barbe (4, rue Valette 75005), College d'Harcourt (44 Boulevard Saint-Michel 75006), and Cordeliers (21, Rue Ecole de Medecine 75006).[2]\n\nIn 1793, during the French Revolution, the university was closed and by Item-27 of the Revolutionary Convention, the college endowments and buildings were sold.[3] A new University of France replaced it in 1806 with four independent faculties: the Faculty of Humanities (French: Facult\u00e9 des Lettres), the Faculty of Law (later including Economics), the Faculty of Science, the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Theology (closed in 1885).\n\nIn 1970, following the May 1968 events, the university was divided into 13 autonomous universities. Although all the thirteen universities that resulted of the original University of Paris split can be considered its inheritors, just three universities of the post-1968 universities embodied direct faculties successors while inheriting the name \"Sorbonne\", as well as its physical location in the Latin Quarter: the Pantheon-Sorbonne University (Paris I; law); University of Paris III: Sorbonne Nouvelle; and Paris-Sorbonne University (Paris IV; humanities).[4][5][6][7]\n\nFrom 2010, University of Paris successors started to reorganise themselves into different groups of universities and institutions (COMUE) that later were upgraded to \"p\u00f4les de recherche et d'enseignement sup\u00e9rieur\". As a result, various university groups exist in the Paris area, among them Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, Sorbonne Universities, the University of Paris-Saclay, Paris Lumi\u00e9res, Paris-Seine, and so on.[8]\n\nIn January 2018, two of the inheritors of the old University of Paris, Paris-Sorbonne University and Pierre and Marie Curie University, merged into a single university called Sorbonne University.[9][10][11] In 2019, two other inheritors of the University of Paris, namely Paris Diderot University and Paris Descartes University, are also expected to merge.[12]\n\nOrigins [ edit ]\n\nIn 1150, the future University of Paris was a student-teacher corporation operating as an annex of the Notre-Dame cathedral school. The earliest historical reference to it is found in Matthew of Paris' reference to the studies of his own teacher (an abbot of St. Albans) and his acceptance into \"the fellowship of the elect Masters\" there in about 1170,[13] and it is known that Pope Innocent III completed his studies there in 1182 at the age of 21.\n\nThe corporation was formally recognised as an \"Universitas\" in an edict by King Philippe-Auguste in 1200: in it, among other accommodations granted to future students, he allowed the corporation to operate under ecclesiastic law which would be governed by the elders of the Notre-Dame Cathedral school, and assured all those completing courses there that they would be granted a diploma.[14]\n\nThe university had four faculties: Arts, Medicine, Law, and Theology. The Faculty of Arts was the lowest in rank, but also the largest, as students had to graduate there in order to be admitted to one of the higher faculties. The students were divided into four nationes according to language or regional origin: France, Normandy, Picardy, and England. The last came to be known as the Alemannian (German) nation. Recruitment to each nation was wider than the names might imply: the English-German nation included students from Scandinavia and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe faculty and nation system of the University of Paris (along with that of the University of Bologna) became the model for all later medieval universities. Under the governance of the Church, students wore robes and shaved the tops of their heads in tonsure, to signify they were under the protection of the church. Students followed the rules and laws of the Church and were not subject to the king's laws or courts. This presented problems for the city of Paris, as students ran wild, and its official had to appeal to Church courts for justice. Students were often very young, entering the school at 13 or 14 years of age and staying for six to 12 years.\n\n12th century: Organization [ edit ]\n\nThree schools were especially famous in Paris: the palatine or palace school, the school of Notre-Dame, and that of Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve Abbey. The decline of royalty brought about the decline of the first. The other two were ancient but did not have much visibility in the early centuries. The glory of the palatine school doubtless eclipsed theirs, until it completely gave way to them. These two centres were much frequented and many of their masters were esteemed for their learning. The first renowned professor at the school of Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve was Hubold, who lived in the tenth century. Not content with the courses at Li\u00e8ge, he continued his studies at Paris, entered or allied himself with the chapter of Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve, and attracted many pupils via his teaching. Distinguished professors from the school of Notre-Dame in the eleventh century include Lambert, disciple of Fulbert of Chartres; Drogo of Paris; Manegold of Germany; and Anselm of Laon. These two schools attracted scholars from every country and produced many illustrious men, among whom were: St. Stanislaus of Szczepan\u00f3w, Bishop of Krak\u00f3w; Gebbard, Archbishop of Salzburg; St. Stephen, third Abbot of C\u00eeteaux; Robert d'Arbrissel, founder of the Abbey of Fontevrault etc. Three other men who added prestige to the schools of Notre-Dame and Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve were William of Champeaux, Ab\u00e9lard, and Peter Lombard.\n\nHumanistic instruction comprised grammar, rhetoric, dialectics, arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy (trivium and quadrivium). To the higher instruction belonged dogmatic and moral theology, whose source was the Scriptures and the Patristic Fathers. It was completed by the study of Canon law. The School of Saint-Victor arose to rival those of Notre-Dame and Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve. It was founded by William of Champeaux when he withdrew to the Abbey of Saint-Victor. Its most famous professors are Hugh of St. Victor and Richard of St. Victor.\n\nThe plan of studies expanded in the schools of Paris, as it did elsewhere. A Bolognese compendium of canon law called the Decretum Gratiani brought about a division of the theology department. Hitherto the discipline of the Church had not been separate from so-called theology; they were studied together under the same professor. But this vast collection necessitated a special course, which was undertaken first at Bologna, where Roman law was taught. In France, first Orl\u00e9ans and then Paris erected chairs of canon law. Before the end of the twelfth century, the Decretals of Gerard La Pucelle, Mathieu d'Angers, and Anselm (or Anselle) of Paris, were added to the Decretum Gratiani. However, civil law was not included at Paris. In the twelfth century, medicine began to be publicly taught at Paris: the first professor of medicine in Paris records is Hugo, physicus excellens qui quadrivium docuit.\n\nProfessors were required to have measurable knowledge and be appointed by the university. Applicants had to be assessed by examination; if successful, the examiner, who was the head of the school, and known as scholasticus, capiscol, and chancellor, appointed an individual to teach. This was called the licence or faculty to teach. The licence had to be granted freely. No one could teach without it; on the other hand, the examiner could not refuse to award it when the applicant deserved it.\n\nThe school of Saint-Victor, under the abbey, conferred the licence in its own right; the school of Notre-Dame depended on the diocese, that of Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve on the abbey or chapter. The diocese and the abbey or chapter, through their chancellor, gave professorial investiture in their respective territories where they had jurisdiction. Besides Notre-Dame, Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve, and Saint-Victor, there were several schools on the \"Island\" and on the \"Mount\". \"Whoever\", says Crevier \"had the right to teach might open a school where he pleased, provided it was not in the vicinity of a principal school.\" Thus a certain Adam, who was of English origin, kept his \"near the Petit Pont\"; another Adam, Parisian by birth, \"taught at the Grand Pont which is called the Pont-au-Change\" (Hist. de l'Univers. de Paris, I, 272).\n\nThe number of students in the school of the capital grew constantly, so that lodgings were insufficient. French students included princes of the blood, sons of the nobility, and ranking gentry. The courses at Paris were considered so necessary as a completion of studies that many foreigners flocked to them. Popes Celestine II, Adrian IV and Innocent III studied at Paris, and Alexander III sent his nephews there. Noted German and English students included Otto of Freisingen, Cardinal Conrad, Archbishop of Mainz, St. Thomas of Canterbury, and John of Salisbury; while Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve became practically the seminary for Denmark. The chroniclers of the time called Paris the city of letters par excellence, placing it above Athens, Alexandria, Rome, and other cities: \"At that time, there flourished at Paris philosophy and all branches of learning, and there the seven arts were studied and held in such esteem as they never were at Athens, Egypt, Rome, or elsewhere in the world.\" (\"Les gestes de Philippe-Auguste\"). Poets extolled the university in their verses, comparing it to all that was greatest, noblest, and most valuable in the world.\n\nThe Sorbonne covered by snow.\n\nAs the university developed, it became more institutionalized. First, the professors formed an association, for according to Matthew Paris, John of Celles, twenty-first Abbot of St Albans, England, was admitted as a member of the teaching corps of Paris after he had followed the courses (Vita Joannis I, XXI, abbat. S. Alban). The masters, as well as the students, were divided according to national origin,. Alban wrote that Henry II, King of England, in his difficulties with St. Thomas of Canterbury, wanted to submit his cause to a tribunal composed of professors of Paris, chosen from various provinces (Hist. major, Henry II, to end of 1169). This was likely the start of the division according to \"nations,\" which was later to play an important part in the university. Celestine III ruled that both professors and students had the privilege of being subject only to the ecclesiastical courts, not to civil courts.\n\nThe three schools: Notre-Dame, Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve, and Saint-Victor, may be regarded as the triple cradle of the Universitas scholarium, which included masters and students; hence the name University. Henry Denifle and some others hold that this honour is exclusive to the school of Notre-Dame (Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis), but the reasons do not seem convincing. He excludes Saint-Victor because, at the request of the abbot and the religious of Saint-Victor, Gregory IX in 1237 authorized them to resume the interrupted teaching of theology. But the university was largely founded about 1208, as is shown by a Bull of Innocent III. Consequently, the schools of Saint-Victor might well have contributed to its formation. Secondly, Denifle excludes the schools of Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve because there had been no interruption in the teaching of the liberal arts. This is debatable and through the period, theology was taught. The chancellor of Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve continued to give degrees in arts, something he would have ceased if his abbey had no part in the university organization.\n\n13th\u201314th century: Expansion [ edit ]\n\nMeeting of doctors at the University of Paris. From a 16th-century miniature.\n\nIn 1200, King Philip II issued a diploma \"for the security of the scholars of Paris,\" which affirmed that students were subject only to ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The provost and other officers were forbidden to arrest a student for any offence, unless to transfer him to ecclesiastical authority. The king's officers could not intervene with any member unless having a mandate from an ecclesiastical authority. His action followed a violent incident between students and officers outside the city walls at a pub.\n\nIn 1215, the Apostolic legate, Robert de Cour\u00e7on, issued new rules governing who could become a professor. To teach the arts, a candidate had to be at least twenty-one, to have studied these arts at least six years, and to take an engagement as professor for at least two years. For a chair in theology, the candidate had to be thirty years of age, with eight years of theological studies, of which the last three years were devoted to special courses of lectures in preparation for the mastership. These studies had to be made in the local schools under the direction of a master. In Paris, one was regarded as a scholar only by studies with particular masters. Lastly, purity of morals was as important as reading. The licence was granted, according to custom, gratuitously, without oath or condition. Masters and students were permitted to unite, even by oath, in defence of their rights, when they could not otherwise obtain justice in serious matters. No mention is made either of law or of medicine, probably because these sciences were less prominent.\n\nIn 1229, a denial of justice by the queen led to suspension of the courses. The pope intervened with a Bull that began with lavish praise of the university: \"Paris\", said Gregory IX, \"mother of the sciences, is another Cariath-Sepher, city of letters\". He commissioned the Bishops of Le Mans and Senlis and the Archdeacon of Ch\u00e2lons to negotiate with the French Court for the restoration of the university, but by the end of 1230 they had accomplished nothing. Gregory IX then addressed a Bull of 1231 to the masters and scholars of Paris. Not only did he settle the dispute, he empowered the university to frame statutes concerning the discipline of the schools, the method of instruction, the defence of theses, the costume of the professors, and the obsequies of masters and students (expanding upon Robert de Cour\u00e7on's statutes). Most importantly, the pope granted the university the right to suspend its courses, if justice were denied it, until it should receive full satisfaction.\n\nThe pope authorized Pierre Le Mangeur to collect a moderate fee for the conferring of the license of professorship. Also, for the first time, the scholars had to pay tuition fees for their education: two sous weekly, to be deposited in the common fund.\n\nRector [ edit ]\n\nThe university was organized as follows: at the head of the teaching body was a rector. The office was elective and of short duration; at first it was limited to four or six weeks. Simon de Brion, legate of the Holy See in France, realizing that such frequent changes caused serious inconvenience, decided that the rectorate should last three months, and this rule was observed for three years. Then the term was lengthened to one, two, and sometimes three years. The right of election belonged to the procurators of the four nations.\n\nFour \"nations\" [ edit ]\n\nMap showing the territories covered by the four nations of the University of Paris during the Middle Ages.\n\nThe \"nations\" appeared in the second half of the twelfth century. They were mentioned in the Bull of Honorius III in 1222. Later, they formed a distinct body. By 1249, the four nations existed with their procurators, their rights (more or less well-defined), and their keen rivalries: the nations were the French, English, Normans, and Picards. After the Hundred Years' War, the English nation was replaced by the Germanic. The four nations constituted the faculty of arts or letters.\n\nThe territories covered by the four nations were:\n\nFaculties [ edit ]\n\nTo classify professors' knowledge, the schools of Paris gradually divided into faculties. Professors of the same science were brought into closer contact until the community of rights and interests cemented the union and made them distinct groups. The faculty of medicine seems to have been the last to form. But the four faculties were already formally established by 1254, when the university described in a letter \"theology, jurisprudence, medicine, and rational, natural, and moral philosophy\". The masters of theology often set the example for the other faculties\u2014e.g., they were the first to adopt an official seal.\n\nThe faculties of theology, canon law, and medicine, were called \"superior faculties\". The title of \"Dean\" as designating the head of a faculty, came into use by 1268 in the faculties of law and medicine, and by 1296 in the faculty of theology. It seems that at first the deans were the oldest masters. The faculty of arts continued to have four procurators of its four nations and its head was the rector. As the faculties became more fully organized, the division into four nations partially disappeared for theology, law and medicine, though it continued in arts. Eventually the superior faculties included only doctors, leaving the bachelors to the faculty of arts. At this period, therefore, the university had two principal degrees, the baccalaureate and the doctorate. It was not until much later that the licentiate and the DEA became intermediate degrees.\n\nColleges [ edit ]\n\nRue Saint-Jacques and the Sorbonne in Paris\n\nThe scattered condition of the scholars in Paris often made lodging difficult. Some students rented rooms from townspeople, who often exacted high rates while the students demanded lower. This tension between scholars and citizens would have developed into a sort of civil war if Robert de Cour\u00e7on had not found the remedy of taxation. It was upheld in the Bull of Gregory IX of 1231, but with an important modification: its exercise was to be shared with the citizens. The aim was to offer the students a shelter where they would fear neither annoyance from the owners nor the dangers of the world. Thus were founded the colleges (colligere, to assemble); meaning not centers of instruction, but simple student boarding-houses. Each had a special goal, being established for students of the same nationality or the same science. Often, masters lived in each college and oversaw its activities.\n\nFour colleges appeared in the 12th century; they became more numerous in the 13th, including Coll\u00e8ge d'Harcourt (1280) and the Coll\u00e8ge de Sorbonne (1257). Thus the University of Paris assumed its basic form. It was composed of seven groups, the four nations of the faculty of arts, and the three superior faculties of theology, law, and medicine. Men who had studied at Paris became an increasing presence in the high ranks of the Church hierarchy; eventually, students at the University of Paris saw it as a right that they would be eligible to benefices. Church officials such as St. Louis and Clement IV lavishly praised the university.\n\nBesides the famous Coll\u00e8ge de Sorbonne, other collegia provided housing and meals to students, sometimes for those of the same geographical origin in a more restricted sense than that represented by the nations. There were 8 or 9 collegia for foreign students: the oldest one was the Danish college, the Collegium danicum or dacicum, founded in 1257. Swedish students could, during the 13th and 14th centuries, live in one of three Swedish colleges, the Collegium Upsaliense, the Collegium Scarense or the Collegium Lincopense, named after the Swedish dioceses of Uppsala, Skara and Link\u00f6ping.\n\nThe Coll\u00e8ge de Navarre was founded in 1305, originally aimed at students from Navarre, but due to its size, wealth, and the links between the crowns of France and Navarre, it quickly accepted students from other nations. The establishment of the College of Navarre was a turning point in the University's history: Navarra was the first college to offer teaching to its students, which at the time set it apart from all previous colleges, founded as charitable institutions that provided lodging, but no tuition. Navarre's model combining lodging and tuition would be reproduced by other colleges, both in Paris and other universities. [18]\n\nThe German College, Collegium alemanicum is mentioned as early as 1345, the Scots college or Collegium scoticum was founded in 1325. The Lombard college or Collegium lombardicum was founded in the 1330s. The Collegium constantinopolitanum was, according to a tradition, founded in the 13th century to facilitate a merging of the eastern and western churches. It was later reorganized as a French institution, the Coll\u00e8ge de la Marche-Winville. The Coll\u00e8ge de Montaigu was founded by the Archbishop of Rouen in the 14th century, and reformed in the 15th century by the humanist Jan Standonck, when it attracted reformers from within the Roman Catholic Church (such as Erasmus and Ignatius of Loyola) and those who subsequently became Protestants (John Calvin and John Knox).\n\nAt this time, the university also went the controversy of the condemnations of 1210\u20131277.\n\n15th\u201318th century: Influence in France and Europe [ edit ]\n\nThe Old Sorbonne on fire in 1670.\n\nThe Sorbonne, Paris, in a 17th-century engraving\n\nIn the fifteenth century, Guillaume d'Estouteville, a cardinal and Apostolic legate, reformed the university, correcting its perceived abuses and introducing various modifications. This reform was less an innovation than a recall to observance of the old rules, as was the reform of 1600, undertaken by the royal government with regard to the three higher faculties. Nonetheless, and as to the faculty of arts, the reform of 1600 introduced the study of Greek, of French poets and orators, and of additional classical figures like Hesiod, Plato, Demosthenes, Cicero, Virgil, and Sallust. The prohibition from teaching civil law was never well observed at Paris, but in 1679 Louis XIV officially authorized the teaching of civil law in the faculty of decretals. The \"faculty of law\" hence replaced the \"faculty of decretals\". The colleges meantime had multiplied; those of Cardinal Le-Moine and Navarre were founded in the fourteenth century. The Hundred Years' War was fatal to these establishments, but the university set about remedying the injury.\n\nBesides its teaching, the University of Paris played an important part in several disputes: in the Church, during the Great Schism; in the councils, in dealing with heresies and divisions; in the State, during national crises. Under the domination of England it played a role in the trial of Joan of Arc.\n\nProud of its rights and privileges, the University of Paris fought energetically to maintain them, hence the long struggle against the mendicant orders on academic as well as on religious grounds. Hence also the shorter conflict against the Jesuits, who claimed by word and action a share in its teaching. It made extensive use of its right to decide administratively according to occasion and necessity. In some instances it openly endorsed the censures of the faculty of theology and pronounced condemnation in its own name, as in the case of the Flagellants.\n\nIts patriotism was especially manifested on two occasions. During the captivity of King John, when Paris was given over to factions, the university sought to restore peace; and under Louis XIV, when the Spaniards crossed the Somme and threatened the capital, it placed two hundred men at the king's disposal and offered the Master of Arts degree gratuitously to scholars who should present certificates of service in the army (Jourdain, Hist. de l'Univers. de Paris au XVIIe et XVIIIe si\u00e8cle, 132-34; Archiv. du minist\u00e8re de l'instruction publique).\n\n1793: Abolition by the French Revolution [ edit ]\n\nrue des \u00c9coles. The Sorbonne as seen from\n\nThe ancient university disappeared with the ancien r\u00e9gime in the French Revolution. On 15 September 1793, petitioned by the Department of Paris and several departmental groups, the National Convention decided that independently of the primary schools,\n\n\"there should be established in the Republic three progressive degrees of instruction; the first for the knowledge indispensable to artisans and workmen of all kinds; the second for further knowledge necessary to those intending to embrace the other professions of society; and the third for those branches of instruction the study of which is not within the reach of all men\".\n\nMeasures were to be taken immediately: \"For means of execution the department and the municipality of Paris are authorized to consult with the Committee of Public Instruction of the National Convention, in order that these establishments shall be put in action by 1 November next, and consequently colleges now in operation and the faculties of theology, medicine, arts, and law are suppressed throughout the Republic\". This was the death-sentence of the university. It was not to be restored after the Revolution had subsided, no more than those of the provinces.\n\nThe university was re-established by Napoleon on 1 May 1806. All the faculties were replaced by a single centre, the University of France. The decree of 17 March 1808 created five distinct faculties: Law, Medicine, Letters/Humanities, Sciences, and Theology; traditionally, Letters and Sciences had been grouped together into one faculty, that of \"Arts\". After a century, people recognized that the new system was less favourable to study. The defeat of 1870 at the hands of Prussia was partially blamed on the growth of the superiority of the German university system of the 19th century, and led to another serious reform of the French university. In the 1880s, the \"licence\" (bachelor) degree is divided into, for the Faculty of Letters: Letters, Philosophy, History, Modern Languages, with French, Latin and Greek being requirements for all of them; and for the Faculty of Science, into: Mathematics, Physical Sciences and Natural Sciences; the Faculty of Theology is abolished by the Republic. At this time, the building of the Sorbonne was fully renovated.[19]\n\nMay 1968\u20131970: Shutdown [ edit ]\n\nIn 1966, after a student revolt in Paris, Christian Fouchet, minister of education, had proposed \"the reorganisation of university studies into separate two- and four-year degrees, alongside the introduction of selective admission criteria\" as a response to overcrowding in lecture halls.[20] Dissatisfied with these educational reforms, students began protesting in November 1967, at the campus of the University of Paris in Nanterre;[21] indeed, according to James Marshall, these reforms were seen \"as the manifestations of the technocratic-capitalist state by some, and by others as attempts to destroy the liberal university\".[22] After student activists protested the Vietnam War, the campus was closed by authorities on 22 March and again on 2 May 1968.[23] Agitation spread to the Sorbonne the next day, and many students were arrested in the following week.[24] Barricades were erected throughout the Latin Quarter, and a massive demonstration took place on 13 May, gathering students and workers on strike.[25] The number of workers on strike reached about nine million by 22 May.[21] As explained by Bill Readings:\n\n[President Charles de Gaulle] responded on May 24 by calling for a referendum, and [...] the revolutionaries, led by informal action committees, attacked and burned the Paris Stock Exchange in response. The Gaullist government then held talks with union leaders, who agreed to a package of wage-rises and increases in union rights. The strikers, however, simply refused the plan. With the French state tottering, de Gaulle fled France on May 29 for a French military base in Germany. He later returned and, with the assurance of military support, announced [general] elections [within] forty days. [...] Over the next two months, the strikes were broken (or broke up) while the election was won by the Gaullists with an increased majority.[26]\n\n1970: Division [ edit ]\n\nFollowing the disruption, de Gaulle appointed Edgar Faure as minister of education; Faure was assigned to draft reforms about the French university system, with the help of academics.[27] Their proposal was adopted on 12 November 1968;[28] in accordance with the new law, the faculties of the University of Paris were to reorganize themselves.[29]\n\nSome of the new universities took over the old faculties and the majority of their professors: social sciences by Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne University;[30] law by Panth\u00e9on-Assas University;[31] humanities by Sorbonne Nouvelle[6][4] and Paris-Sorbonne University; natural sciences by Paris Descartes University[32][4] and Pierre and Marie Curie University.[33]\n\nThe thirteen successor universities to the University of Paris are now split over the three academies of the \u00cele-de-France region.\n\nMost of these successor universities have the joined the six groups of universities and (higher education) institutions in the Paris region, created in the 2010s.\n\nUse of the buildings [ edit ]\n\nFollowing the May 1968 events, French higher education was reorganized in the Faure law of November 12, 1968.[34][35][36] Some of the 13 autonomous universities created after the breakup of the University of Paris maintained operations in the Sorbonne building and decided to keep the word Sorbonne in their names: The University of Paris 1 (Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne), the University of Paris 3 (Sorbonne-Nouvelle) and the University of Paris 4 (Paris-Sorbonne). Two other universities maintained operations in the building but opted to abandon the name: the University of Paris 5 (Paris Descartes) and the University of Paris 7 (Paris Diderot).[37]\n\nTwo additional higher education institutions also remained active in the historical Sorbonne building: the Ecole des chartes and the Ecole pratique de hautes \u00e9tudes.[37] Furthermore, the University of Paris 2 (Panth\u00e9on-Assas), while not based in the Sorbonne building, does operate from the Panth\u00e9on site across the Cujas street.[38]\n\nThe common heritage and estate of the University of Paris (including the Sorbonne building) was not divided and instead placed under the authority of a common administration: the Chancellerie des Universit\u00e9s de Paris, whose headquarters are also located in the Sorbonne building.[34][39]\n\nThe building as a whole is then a common asset of the 13 successor universities of the University of Paris, and particularly the monumental sections are not attributed to any single university (but shared by all of them): the Sorbonne Chapel, the Cour d'honneur, the P\u00e9rystile and the Grand amphith\u00e9\u00e2tre.[37][40]\n\nSome of the dependencies are administered by one of the successor universities (while remaining a common asset). The library of the Sorbonne (Biblioth\u00e8que Interuniversitaire de la Sorbonne) is a common library of the universities Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne, Sorbonne-Nouvelle, Sorbonne-Universit\u00e9, Paris Descartes and Paris Diderot, administered by Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne.[41]\n\nThe classrooms, libraries and administrative offices are attributed to the Universities maintaining operations in the building: Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne, Sorbonne-Nouvelle, Sorbonne-Universit\u00e9 (which also has its headquarters), Paris Descartes and Paris Diderot. All of them also operate in other campuses established across Paris.\n\nThe name and brand Sorbonne [ edit ]\n\nDespite being a highly valued brand, the Sorbonne universities did not register their names as trademarks until the 1990s. Over the following years, they established partnerships, merging projects and associated institutions with the name Sorbonne, sometimes triggering conflicts over the usage and ownership of the name.\n\nAfter the Faure law of 1968, Parisian universities \u2013 as other universities in other French cities \u2013 received names composed of their city of origin and a number.[34]They also chose an accompanying name and they usually go together in official documents, and colloquially may be referred as one or the other (\"Paris 1\" or \"Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne\"):\n\nHowever, almost 30 years went by without any of them registering their names as a trademark. The first one to do it was the University of Paris 4 Paris-Sorbonne, who trademarked the name Universit\u00e9 de Paris-Sorbonne in 1996, followed by the registration of the updated logos over the next decade.[42] It was followed by Sorbonne-Nouvelle and Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne[42] in 1999.[43] In 2007 Paris 4 trademarked also the brand \"La Sorbonne\". In 2006 it had granted permission to the authorities of Abu Dhabi to use the brand Sorbonne in the entire Middle east region; the \"Sorbonne Abu Dhabi\" logo was trademarked in 2007,[42] blocking other Sorbonne universities from doing the same.[44] This last initiative triggered a crisis with the other Sorbonne universities, forcing the French authorities to intervene.[45]\n\nThe local governments of Paris and the \u00cele de France region threatened to block the merger of Paris 2, Paris 4 and Paris 6, who had trademarked the brand \"Universit\u00e9 de la Sorbonne\",[42] if they persisted in taking over the name Sorbonne for themselves at the expense of the other Sorbonne universities.[46][47][48][49][50]\n\nLater the merging project advanced only between the Universities of Paris 4 and Paris 6[51] but was forced to reconsider the name Sorbonne Universit\u00e9. The compromise in 2010 consisted of adding a \"s\" at the end of the name of the project (the future merged University would be named later), making it Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s.[34][42] In 2018 the project effectively merged the former universities of Paris 4 and 6, taking the name \"Sorbonne-Universit\u00e9\" with or without the hyphen.[52] In line with the naming convention and with the former crisis of 2006 in the background, the number in the name disappears and the accompanying name becomes \"Sorbonne Universit\u00e9\", replacing \"Paris-Sorbonne\" and \"Pierre et Marie Curie\".\n\nThe new naming is then \"Universit\u00e9 Sorbonne Universit\u00e9\" or \"Universit\u00e9 Sorbonne-Universit\u00e9\"[52] though colloquially and in most communications, and in registered trademarks[42] is simply \"Sorbonne Universit\u00e9\". The first \"University\" in the name refers to the fact that it is a University \u2013 only public higher education institutions are allowed to use that term in France[53]\u2013 and the second \"University\" comes from the naming convention of adding a name after the City-number designation. Currently Sorbonne-Universit\u00e9 is the only Sorbonne university not using a number in its name.\n\nThe University of Paris 2 (Panth\u00e9on-Assas) trademarked the brand \"Universit\u00e9 Sorbonne-Assas\" in 2007 and \"Sorbonne-Assas\" in 2013.[42]\n\nSpecific programs and institutions [ edit ]\n\nOther mergers or association projects [ edit ]\n\nNotable people [ edit ]\n\nFaculty [ edit ]\n\nAlumni [ edit ]\n\nNobel prizes [ edit ]\n\nAlumni [ edit ]\n\nThe university counts 50 Nobel Prize winners, placing it in 14th position globally, and 2nd outside of the English-speaking world.

Founding\n\nThe University of Paris is a public university that was already well established decades before it was formally \"founded\" by the Catholic Church and recognized by King Philip II in 1200, and the recognized by Pope Innocent III 15 years later. Such a sequential pattern for recognition was common among medieval colleges and universities. Originally, the university was formally under the governance of the Church, and it was known as \"a guild of masters of scholars\" that would serve as a model for universities to come. The university developed as a corporation around the Notre Dame Cathedral. When it was just founded, it had four Faculties, namely those of Arts, Medicine, Law, and Theology. Students were divided according to regional origin, into the four nations of France, Normandy, Picardy, and England.\n\n4. History\n\nIn the 12th Century, three schools within the university were famous in Paris. These were the Palace School, the School of Notre Dame, and the School of Sainte-Genevieve Abbey. With the decline of the royalty in France, the latter schools surpassed the Palace School in significance, and attracted famous scholars. In that period, the university offered mostly humanistic instruction, comprised by grammar, rhetoric, dialectics, music, astronomy, and geometry. Later on, in the 13th Century, the Faculties of Theology, Canon Law, and Medicine gained superiority. Four colleges were gradually formed, and the university assumed the basic form it carried from that point on. In 1968, after the May 6th student and worker revolts that spread across France, the university was reorganized into 13 separate campuses, numbered as University of Paris I through XIII. Commonly, people refer to Paris I as the University of Paris, Pantheon-Sorbonne University, or La Sorbonne.\n\n3. Structure\n\nThe University of Paris, in its current form, has 13 universities. These include Patheon-Sorbonne University, Pantheon-Assas University, Sorbonne Nouvelle University. Paris-Sorbonne University, Rene Descartes University, Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University, Denis Diderot University, University of Vincennes in Saint-Denis, Paris Dauphine University, University of Paris Ouest, University of Paris Sud, University of Paris Est, and University of Paris Nord. Each university has its own expertise and governance. For example, Paris Five is known for its strength in social sciences and clinical health, while Paris Seven is known for its teachings in sciences and psychology.\n\n2. Rankings\n\nEach of the thirteen universities has its own ranking, with any of them being ranked among top universities, not only in France, but across the world as a whole. According to both the World University Rankings and the Academic Ranking of World Universities, Paris VI--University of Paris Sud ranks the highest among the thirteen, occupying number 120 and number 41, respectively. Paris IV--University Paris-Sorbonne is ranked 222nd in the world, followed by Paris I--Pantheon-Sorbonne University, ranking 240th in the world, and Paris VII--University Paris Diderot, ranking 261st. Although traditionally known aggregately for philosophy and literature, the 13 universities of University of Paris are now important homes for research in clinical health, psychology, medicine, and much more.\n\n1. Alumni\n\nThe University of Paris has left a rich and profound legacy. It has produced many accomplished and renowned politicians, writers, philosophers, and celebrities. One of the most prominent theologians, John Calvin, attended the University of Paris in the 16th Century. Former President of France Francois Mitterrand studied law and politics at the University of Paris himself. Famous \"New Wave\" director Jean-Luc Godard, philosopher Paul Ricour, economist Gerard Debreu, and political scientist Jeane Kirkpatrick are all also listed among the many famous alumni of the University of Paris. Furthermore, it has also educated and helped to inspire 51 Novel Prize winners, spanning the fields of Physics, Literature, Chemistry, and Economics alike."}], "Philip of France founded the Abbey of St. Denis.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/place/Saint-Denis-France", "page_content": "Saint-Denis, city, a northern suburb of Paris, Seine-Saint-Denis d\u00e9partement, \u00cele-de-France r\u00e9gion, north-central France. The city lies on the right bank of the Seine River. Until the mid-19th century, when industries developed there, it was only a small township centred on its famous abbey church, which had been the burial place of the kings of France. The church is of major importance in the history of architecture, being the first major edifice marking the transition from the Romanesque to the Gothic style and serving as a model for most of the late 12th-century French Gothic cathedrals, including those at Chartres and Senlis. The city also has a reputation for its fairs and traditional celebrations, such as those of Lendit (a medieval fair of the Paris region).\n\nKing Dagobert I founded the abbey in the 7th century and built it over the tomb of St. Denis, patron saint of France. The town gradually grew up around the abbey. Abbot Suger (1136\u201347) built a new basilica for the abbey that incorporated and adapted part of an earlier church built during the Carolingian empire (751\u2013987). Suger\u2019s church was to transform Western architecture; the Gothic stylistic elements that mark it as a transitional structure can best be seen in the chancel and the ambulatory with its famous stained-glass windows. The west facade (1137\u201340) was much restored during the 19th century by Eug\u00e8ne-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc. The choir, apse, and nave were rebuilt in the Gothic style under Louis IX (1214\u201370).\n\nFor 12 centuries, except for a few kings of the Merovingian (500\u2013751) and Capetian (987\u20131328) dynasties, all the French kings\u2014from Dagobert I (reigned 629\u2013639) to Louis XVIII (reigned 1814\u201324)\u2014as well as their close relatives and a number of their outstanding subjects, were buried in the basilica. During the French Revolution (1787\u201399), their tombs were desecrated and removed, but they were later reassembled in the church and now constitute a remarkable collection of French funerary sculpture. The monuments on all the tombs of the predecessors of Louis IX (St. Louis; reigned 1226\u201370) were carved under his orders and are of little interest except for that of Dagobert, which has lively sculptures. After Philip III (died 1285), the recumbent statues had faces copied from death masks; most of them are striking portraits. During the Renaissance, the mausoleums were elaborate and highly decorated. They are mostly on two levels; on the upper level the monarchs are represented kneeling in court dress, while on the lower level, they are shown lying naked in the rigidity of death. The most remarkable Renaissance tombs include those of Louis XII (1498\u20131515), Anne of Brittany, Francis I (1515\u201347), Claude of France, Henry II (1547\u201359), and Catherine de\u2019 Medici. The crypt, which Suger built around the foundations of the Carolingian church, contains some Merovingian sarcophagi.\n\nSeveral monastic buildings were added to the abbey complex in the 18th century. These were transformed by Napoleon I into a school for daughters of members of the Legion of Honour, which they remain.\n\nSituated on the main railway line north of Paris and traversed by the Saint-Denis Canal, the suburb is an important industrial and administrative centre. It is home to the University of Paris VIII (one of the successors of the former University of Paris); one of France\u2019s major sports stadiums, Stade de France; and the Municipal Museum, which has a section devoted to the 20th-century poet Paul \u00c9luard, who was born in Saint-Denis.

Indeed, as we read in the Gestes des Francs: \u2018The kingdom having been divided between the sons of Lothaire, grandson of Clovis, Charibert and Gontrand received for their kingdom the provinces of the Celts and the Aquitans and one of them, Charibert, installed for him the royal seat, namely in Paris and extended his kingdom as far as the river Garonne. For his part, Gontrand established the royal seat in Orleans for him and received for his kingdom, Burgundy, which is a part of the Celtic.\u2019 Certainly, these kings did not receive any blessing or crown from the Archbishop of Reims, but it was through the priest\u2019s provinces they ruled that they were raised and crowned.\u201d\n\n5 Hincmar of Reims ( Cum uero pervenissent ad baptisterium, clericus, qui chrisma ferebat a populo est interceptus, ut ad fontem venire nequiuerit.

The fact is that Westminster became the place of consecration and burial of the English monarchy, while Saint-Denis became only a royal mausoleum.

Then he hurried to the blessed Dionysius, for common report and frequent experience had taught him that he was the particular patron and, after God, the foremost protector of the realm. Offering prayers and gifts, he begged him from the bottom of his heart to defend the kingdom, to keep safe his person, and to resist the enemy in his customary way. For the French have a special privilege from him: if another kingdom should dare invade theirs, the relics of that blessed and wonderful defender himself, together with those of his companions, are placed on the altar in order to defend the kingdom; and the king had this done with solemnity and devotion in his presence. He then took from the altar the standard belonging to the county of Vexin, which he held as a fief from the church, and gazed upon it. Taking it up as he had vowed, as if from his lord, so to speak, he rushed out against [\u2026]\u201d; \u201cQuod cum domino regi Ludovico intimorum relatione innotuisset, tam strenue, quam audacter delectum quem non exspectat cogit, nobiles asciscit, causam exponit.

He and his companions, Rusticus and Eleutherius, were martyred for their faith, after being beheaded by a sword. He is thought to have been killed during the persecution of Christians by the Roman Emperor Decius, this is why he is often depicted with his head in his hands. The first Abbey of St. Denis was founded in the 7th Century, by King Dagobert (629-639). It was built over the tomb of St. Denis, who is the patron saint of France.\n\nBy 1100, rib vaulting was already in use in England and in Italy. This creates crisscross lines of penetration, which are underlined by a system of ribs, clearly dividing the surface of the vault into triangular sections. With rib vaulting, the weight is channelled to the ground along the pillars and columns, so that the space can be opened up and greater heights achieved. By 1125, this system of diagonal ribs was adopted in Normandy. The pointed arch had also been known to Romanesque builders, before the end of the 11th Century. It had been used first in Islamic architecture of the near east in the 8th Century, and was in use through Egypt, Tunisia and Sicily under Arab rule. The exact course of its migration to Western Europe is not certain, but it is certainly speculated upon. Depending on what countries documents you are reading, you can find an argument for the pointed arch being used first in most Western European countries. One suggestion, is that it was first used in Sicily, before the conquest of the island by the Normans, in the late 11th Century. It is also thought to have been used at Cluny, in Burgundy, in the new church in 1088, but this was in large part destroyed during the French Revolution. By the 1130\u2019s, it is widely thought that the pointed arch had spread to many parts of France, Burgundy, Provence, Poitou, Aquitaine, Paris, and some parts of England. There is an abundance of evidence that the pointed gothic arch was in wide spread use by the 1130\u2019s, and yet it is also widely claimed, that St. Denis in Paris was the birthplace of Gothic.\n\nPerhaps we have to split the idea of Gothic architecture, from the pointed arch itself. Gothic rose out of the world of the Romanesque, and this new style of gothic is widely claimed to have originated in Paris around 1140. St. Denis in Paris is still proclaimed as the parent of all gothic cathedrals. While it can certainly be argued that the pointed arch did not originate in France, the ideas of gothic itself seems to have. The first Gothic age produced the Cathedrals of Notre Dame in Paris, Laon, Chartres, Bourge, Reims, Amiens and Beauvais. By the mid 12th Century, gothic had become a vital movement and expression, it had made great leaps in both artistic and technical innovation. Gothic continued its evolution, with new generations of builders who achieved new ideas, they made advances in the mechanics of stone construction, that allowed more light to enter a building, and more space was created. It is that idea of pushing the boundaries, opening the space, which originated in France. Limiting this invention to the pointed arch, is missing what Gothic truly is. The use of the pointed arch, simply provided the physics that allowed them to create new rules of construction.\n\nJohn Henry Parker wrote a book called 'Gothic Architecture\u2019, which was published in 1870, where he clearly proposes after his 30 years of study, that the style of Gothic did not originate in France at all, but instead originated in England. He argues, that the parts of St. Denis which were built by Abbot Suger, were not those which are gothic at all. He goes on to state that the parts of Canterbury Cathedral, which were built by William the Englishman (1186-1183), are more advanced in the Gothic style than the parts of St. Denis, built by William of Sens under Suger\u2019s instruction (1140-1145). This shows clearly what history always teaches us - the more we think we know, the less we really do. There is, almost always, something that will challenge the very facts we have come to rely on. I can\u2019t say if John Henry Parker is correct, but it is certainly interesting to read his thoughts.\n\nKing Louis VI of France, first met the soon-to-be Abbot Suger, when they were both students, attending the monastic school at the Abbey of St. Denis, just outside Paris. Although Suger was of a much humbler status than the Dauphin Louis, these lines were often blurred in a monastic scholarly setting. They became friends at a young age, a friendship that would last a lifetime. Suger was born in 1081, when King Philip I was King of France, he came to the monastic school at St. Denis at the age of 10. In 1106, Suger took his vows as a monk, and from the start he is said to have showed a fairness that was often lacking in church administration. He was given the task of administrator of St. Denis, which meant it was his responsibility to investigate and alleviate financial troubles, in the districts under the Abbey\u2019s control. The Abbey was the owner of many land holdings, and as such would be entitled to a percentage of anything made or grown on its lands. However, many of the local clergy were not as fair, and peasants were often allowed to keep only a small portion of the food they laboured to create. Suger discovered that formerly prosperous areas, suddenly reduced contributions to St. Denis, because the local church officials were demanding too much from the people in its parish. He addressed this by reducing their obligations. He also showed his ideals of fairness later, when he led a peasant army against a Baron who had been looting farms. Suger appears to have acted in good faith, when new property was acquired, it was rented at fair prices. Suger embarked upon a program of reconstruction and rehabilitation of old buildings, measures were taken against reckless deforestation, tenants were settled in many places, so as to transform cornfields and vineyards from what had been once wasteland, however, many of his biographers were also his fans, so we have to be careful in raising him overly high. However, his diplomatic skills lead to his appointment, by his friend King Louis VI, as Ambassador to the Pope. In 1122, at 40 years of age, he was appointed as the new Abbot of St. Denis.\n\nIn 1124, King Louis VI made his way from the Palace to the Abbey of St. Denis, upon the news that the country was about to be invaded, by the alliance between the English King Henry I and Henry V, Emperor of Germany. King Louis went to pray at the shrine of St. Denis, who was thought to be the protector of France. He also went to consult with his friend, Abbot Suger, on the matter, as he was unprepared for battle. He also pledged a generous donation to the Abbey, if France was delivered safely though these troubled times. Abbot Suger wisely advised the King not to engage the invading army with his weaker forces, but instead counselled the King to call an assembly of the most powerful churchmen and landowners in France, asking for a supply of money and men. France was at this time only a small country, and not what it has become today, but Suger had a plan. While the King would prepare for war, Suger would sell the war, to the French people, as being against St. Denis himself, and against everything French. Suger turned the invasion into a Holy War, and involved Pope Calixtus II, a man who originally was from Burgundy, and whose sympathies would lie with France. His diplomacy united the French against a common enemy, and the attacking forces dissipated. Bloodshed was avoided, and Suger had proven himself a worthy opponent and successful diplomat. Abbot Suger became, after the King, the most powerful man in France. King Louis VI was also a man of his word, and although a battle had not been fought, the King still considered himself victorious and he donated a fortune to the Abbey of St. Denis, which he proclaimed to be the religious capital of the Kingdom, also awarding it an annual income.\n\nThe Abbey of St. Denis now had the most popular shine in France, but in the early 12th Century, it didn\u2019t look the part. The religious buildings were old, small and run down. The Abbey also had other relics to look after - it was said there was a nail from the true cross, and a thorn from the Crown of Thorns. All these relics attracted pilgrims, who brought with them financial offerings that the Abbey needed. The popularity of these artifacts drew such great crowds, that on several occasions, bystanders were trampled to death, by mobs stampeding to pray before the relics. I won\u2019t even comment on that. The volume of visitors were also a threat to the building itself, which was not large enough to accommodate them. By the mid-12th Century, Abbot Suger believed that it was his job to create a new church, to both house the relics, and better service the brethren of the Abbey. It is thought that he possessed an unusual combination of piety and worldliness, he was smart and savvy, he was well travelled and powerful, and he now had the funds and position to transform the Abbey of St. Denis. He wanted to rebuild portions of the Abbey Church, and chose to use innovative structural and decorative features to achieve this, and in 1125 he announced his intention.\n\nAlthough funds were gathered, Suger delayed the start of the building works, it is unknown for what reason, but a ceremony did finally mark the occasion of the start of construction, which began with the new choir on the 14th of July 1140. This was attended by King Louis VII, courtiers, Archbishops and priests, who encircled the site and walked through the foundation trenches, singing the 86th Psalms. It was said that King Louis VII removed his ring and tossed it into the mortar which would be used to join the stones, others followed suit, tossing their jewellery into the mortar.\n\nAbott Suger\u2019s announcement to rebuild the Abbey of St. Denis, received an overwhelmingly positive response. He was given gifts of money, land, and jewels. Pilgrims with no money would offer their labour. Always the businessman, Suger relieved the town of St. Denis from their tax obligations, and the townspeople were so moved, that they took up a collection for the building work. Suger did not just hire a master mason to build his new church, he oversaw the construction himself, which was unusual at the time. He selected the stone and wood himself, which Suger describes in his writings:\n\n\u2018I began to think in bed that I myself should go through all the forests in these parts\u2026Quickly disposing of other duties and hurrying up in the early morning, we hastened with our carpenters, and with the measurements of the beams, to the forest called Iveline. When we traversed out possessions in the valley of Chevreuse we summoned the keepers of our own forests as well as those who knew about the other woods, and questioned them under oath whether we could find there, no matter with how much trouble, any timbers of that measure. At this they smiled or rather would have laughed at us if they had dared; they wondered whether we were quite ignorant of the fact that nothing of the kind could be found in the entire region\u2026 However, we began with the courage of our faith as it were, to search through the woods; and toward the first hour we had found one timber adequate to the measure. By the ninth hour or sooner we had, through the thickets, the depths of the forests and the dense, thorny tangles, marked down twelve timbers\u2019\n\nSuger would later be credited with creating the Gothic movement, which swept through and defined, the greatest buildings of Europe. This was certainly not what he set out to achieve. His one and only plan, was to build a church that was worthy of St. Denis. It was only shortly after he was appointed as Abbot, that he embarked on his plans for his new church. An extravagance which prompted his receipt of a letter from Barnard of Clairvaux, the founder of the minimalistic Cistercian order. Suger moderated his ways, to a point, he was clearly intelligent and learned how to work within the system. He and Barnard of Clairvaux became friends, even if they often disagreed. Suger wrote that:\n\n\u2018As for myself, I declare that it has always seemed right to me that everything which is most precious should above all add to the celebration of the Holy Eucharist. If golden cups, golden phials and small golden mortars were used, in obedience with the Word of God and by the command of the Prophet\u2026Should we dispose of the golden vases and precious stones and all that creation holds most valuable? Those who criticize us claim that this celebration needs only a holy soul, a pure mind and a faithful intention. We are certainly in complete agreement that these are what matter above all else. But we believe that outward ornaments and scared chalices should serve nowhere so much as in our worship, and this with all inward purity and all outward nobility.\u2019\n\nSuger\u2019s importance as a diplomat cannot be over stated, he was one of the most trusted advisors to the King, Louis VI. When Pope Innocent II sought refuge in France, it was Abbot Suger who was appointed by the King to receive him. A few months before King Louis VI of France died, he visited Abbot Suger at St. Denis, and prayed in the crypt, in the burial chapel of the kings of France under the present choir.\n\nIn 1137, Abbot Suger\u2019s lifelong friend, King Louis VI of France died, leaving his young son King Louis VII as his heir. He, along with his new wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, would now rule France. Abbot Suger retained his position as a trusted advisor to the new King. When King Louis VII went on the Second Crusade to the Holy Land, in 1147, Suger was named as regent of France, while the King was away for more than two years. While western Europe would like to take complete credit for Gothic Architecture, it is often forgotten that it was the second crusade, of the 12th Century, that inspired it. The crusaders returned home with reports of architecture, which they said was more impressive than anything they had seen in Christendom. The pointed arches, and slender columns, which seemed to reach forever upwards. Abbot Suger, being Regent at this time, would certainly have spoken to men who had gone on Crusade, and with his mind once again thinking of his new church, it is highly likely that some of the images described to him, were incorporated into the new building.\n\nIn designing the new church, Abbot Suger created a place of symmetry, its ideas built on basic geometric shapes, with circles, squares and triangles, which repeated themselves with a duplicative effect, that was both grand and subtle. He was also interested in light, believing that the divine intellect illuminated the human mind, and that the physical light he could create in the church, would lead the way to the mystical light of God. He wrote:\n\n\u2018The church shines with its middle part brightened. For bright is that which is brightly coupled with the bright. And which the new light pervades. Bright is the noble work enlarged in our time. I, who was Suger, have been leader while it was accomplished.\u2019\n\nGothic itself was finding its way, and while the previously used rounded arches produced the half cylinder shape, their construction created a heaviness of stone, and greatly increased the natural thrust of all vaulted structures. To build higher and prevent the thrust of the vaults from pushing the walls downward or outward, the builders began to brace the exterior of the walls with vertical supports, known as buttresses. The buttress was adapted by Gothic builders, and it became a distinguishing aspect of the Gothic period, although it may be lesser known than the ribbed vault or the pointed arch. The three together became the signature elements of the Gothic style, which were joined later by a variation of the buttress, known as the 'flying buttress\u2019, because it would not be attached to the building directly, but via a decorative feature which would support the building. The pointed arch had the significant advantage of being stonger. It transferred the weight in a different way, more of the weight was pushed downwards, rather than outwards. With the use of pointed arches, builders were now able to support the weight with a series of piers. These piers, or supporting columns, were much less bulky than would have previously been required in Romanesque barrel vaults. Ceilings could now be built higher, and the use of rib vaulting now allowed more slender support columns, so the walls of the building would now be pierced with windows allowing more light to enter.\n\nOn the 11th of July 1144, Abbot Suger\u2019s new church, although not finished, was dedicated with a grand ceremony. The King, Louis VII, was in attendance accompanied by his Queen at the time Eleanor of Aquitaine, and many of the nobles. The dedication ceremony seems to have inspired the same enthusiasm as the foundation ceremony. The King was said to have been particularly pleased, and even Bernard of Clairvaux was in attendance. Although he had sometimes criticized Suger for his lavishness, he praised the building. Suger was not allowed to boast of his accomplishments but he had inscribed over the entrance door:\n\n\u2018Marvel not at the gold and the expense, but at the craftsmanship of the work, Bright is the noble work; but being nobly bright, the work should brighten the minds, so that they may travel, through the true light, The dull mind rises to truth through that which is material.\u2019\n\nThe rebuilding work in the choir was done between 1140-1144, and it was upon this completion that the dedication, or consecration, celebration took place. After the dedication, word of the new church of St. Denis quickly spread throughout France. At the time, nobody called it gothic, that term wouldn\u2019t be used for hundreds of years. When the term Gothic was first used, during the late Renaissance period, it was used as an insult and reference to the barbaric Goths who had overrun Rome. At this time, the new style was known as \u2018Novum Opus\u2019, meaning new work. They would have been better off using a word like \u2018recreated\u2019, as nothing was really new, the same wood, stone and lime were still being used, but now they had a new way of using them. Many of the old materials, from older buildings, were being recycled into new Gothic style buildings. This new way of combining materials into the \u2018gothic\u2019 fashion, would go on for hundreds of years.\n\nAbbot Suger had two ambitions in his life, both of which he was successful in achieving. He wanted to strengthen the power of the Crown of France, and he wanted to improve the Abbey of Saint Denis. For Suger, these ambitions did not conflict with each other, but were simply separate aspects of one ideal, in which he wholeheartedly believed. He believed that the King of France, and in particular his personal friend King Louis VI, was God\u2019s representative, and as his friend the King had invested him with the \u2018defence of the church and the poor' at his coronation, he felt he had a sacred duty to unify the nation whose symbolism was vested in the Abbey of St. Denis. Suger never ceased to promote the interests of the Abbey of St. Denis, and he completely believed this was in alignment with the will of God. He believed that material beauty could be used as a vehicle for spiritual beatitude. Instead of being forced to flee from its temptations, as the Cistercians and Barnard of Clairvaux professed, he felt it would bring people into the church itself, and over time he was proved to be correct. No matter what anyone\u2019s spiritual beliefs are, or lack thereof, the Abbey church of St. Denis does bring in visitors, even today.\n\nSuger would later write about the new church he would create, and we see Suger walk the diplomatic tightrope in his writings. In the 12th Century, churchmen were supposed to live a simple life of self-discipline and personal sacrifice, and all the other churchmen around them were watching them. Abbot Suger followed this, but he also loved the extravagant and the beautiful. Suger was a powerful man, and yet he absolutely felt he needed to justify everything he created. Nothing was for him, nothing his idea, it was all God\u2019s plan, done through God and with his approval, and we see this repeatedly in his writings. Even the very idea of writing down what he created, he could not take the credit for, although you don\u2019t get the impression that they had to twist his arm, he tells us that:\n\n\u2018In the twenty-third year of our administration, when we sat in the general chapter, conferring with our brethren about matters both common and private, these very beloved brethren and sons began strenuously to beseech me in charity that I might not allow the fruits of our so great labours to be passed over in silence; and rather to save for the memory of posterity in pen and ink, those increments which the generous munificence of Almighty God had bestowed upon this church, in the time of our prelacy, in the acquisition of new assets as well as in the recovery of lost ones, in the multiplication of improved possessions, in the construction of buildings, and in the accumulation of gold, silver, most precious gems and very good textiles\u2026.We thus devoutly complied with their devoted and reasonable requests, not with any desire for empty glory nor with any claim to the reward of human praise and transitory compensation.\u2019\n\nAbott Suger\u2019s writings have a bit of flourish about them, but he is trying to, in his own way, document his life\u2019s work, the rebuilding of the Basilica of St. Denis. He clearly tells us, how important this was to him, and it is pretty amazing that his writings have survived. In the mid 12th Century, he writes that:\n\n\u2018because of the age of the old walls and their impending ruin in some places, we summoned the best painters I could find from different regions, and reverently cause these walls to be repaired and becomingly painted with gold and precious colours. I completed this all the more gladly because I had wished to do it, if ever I should have an opportunity, even while I was a pupil in school.\u2019\n\nAt times, in his writings, it seems that Suger almost ties himself in knots trying to not take credit for any of the construction:\n\n\u2018We hurried to begin the chamber of divine atonement in the upper choir where the continual and frequent victim of our redemption would be sacrificed in secret without disturbance by the crowds. And, as is found in our treaties about the consecration of this upper structure, we were mercifully deemed worthy -God helping and prospering us and our concerns \u2013 to bring so holy, so glorious, and so famous a structure, to a good end, together with our brethren and fellow servants; we felt all the more indebted to God and the Holy Martyrs as He, by so long a postponement had reserved what had to be done for our lifetime and labours. For who am I, that I should have presumed to begin so noble and pleasing an edifice, or should have hoped to finish it, had I not, relying upon the help of Divine mercy and the Holy Martyrs, devoted my whole self, both with mind and body, to this very task? But he who gave the will also gave the power; because the good work was in the will therefore it stood in perfection by the help of God.\u2019\n\nAbbot Suger fell ill with a fever, in the autumn of 1150. In his own theatrical way, he asked to be led to the brethren, and while weeping implored the monks to forgive him for everything, in which he might have failed the community. But he also prayed to be spared, until the end of the festive season\n\n\u2018lest the joy of the brethren be converted into sorrow on his account.\u2019\n\nHis wish was granted, and he survived until the 13th of January 1151, when he took his last breath.\n\nI will not go too far into Suger's writings, as he does tend to go on a bit, but his description of the creation of a new shrine to house the relics of St. Denis is, to my knowledge, unique in its existence. But to anyone interested, Suger\u2019s writings have been translated into a book titled, \u201cAbbot Suger: on the Abbey Church of St. Denis and its Treasures\u201d. He described moving the body of St. Denis as follows:\n\n'Since it seemed proper to place the most sacred bodies of our Patron Saints in the upper vault as nobly as we could, and since one of the side tablets of their most sacred sarcophagus had been torn off on some unknown occasion, we put back fifteen marks of gold and took pains to have gilded its rear side and its superstructure throughout, both below and above with about fourty ounces of gold. Further we caused the actual receptacles of the holy bodies to be enclosed with gilded panels of cast copper and with polished stones, fixed close to the inner stone vaults, and also with continuous gates to hold off disturbances by crowds; in such a manner, however that reverend persons, as was fitting, might be able to see them.'\n\nThe Basilica Church of St. Denis was rebuilt, almost completely, between 1136 and 1270. Its dimensions are 108 meters (354 feet) in length, 39 meters (127 feet) width, and 86 meters (282 feet) in height. The first phase of the rebuilding work started at the west front, which was built 1135-1140. The west front is divided into three sections, with the central section being the largest. This clear, vertical, division into three, became a common element in the development of Gothic architecture. It is also interesting to note, that art students are taught that things in triplicate are more pleasing to the human eye. There were once two towers on the west front, of which only one remains. The second and larger, missing tower, was dismantled in 1846, after storm damage and a botched attempt to rebuild it.\n\nThe second phase of building work at the church, was the east end. This was begun in 1140, and it is here that we see all the new elements of the gothic style of architecture being combined. It is thought that this may have been the result of Suger\u2019s fascination with light, but that is probably conjecture. When you look back to the 12th Century, the absolute truth is an impossibility, just as today, people wrote and said what was expected of them. They had their own thoughts and motivations, but their words and actions is all we have to go on, and we can only surmise their intentions. Suger may have picked his wood and stone, but he did not cut and install it himself. While given the credit, the people who actually did the work are virtually forgotten, their names unknown, and it may well have been a master mason who came up with the ideas that made Suger\u2019s church come together. However it all came together, the rebuilding of the choir, at the east end of the church, may well be the first time that the elements of gothic architecture, the pointed arch, the ribbed vault and the buttress worked together as one. All three of these elements had previously existed independently in building techniques, but their combination at St. Denis, is why it has come to be known as the birthplace of Gothic.\n\nAfter Suger\u2019s death, the work on the Abbey church stopped, and it did not resume until 1231. The nave of St. Denis, with its massive slender windows, was not completed until 1281. The church remained virtually unchanged from then, until the 18th Century. Throughout its history, St. Denis has been closely associated with the Royal House of France. Since the reign of Dogobert I, in the 7th Century, almost every French King has been buried in the Basilica of St. Denis. In total, 42 Kings, 33 Queens, 63 Princes and Princesses, and 10 nobles of France, are buried in St. Denis, not to mention the Bishops and Abbots who are also there. With the Abbey of St. Denis being the burial place of the Kings of France, I could have gone down the story of any of their lives and it would have filled this section, but with so many, there was no way to choose, so it seems to make sense to me to focus on Abbot Suger, who was the primary creator of the church. However, before I close this section, I don\u2019t want to completely leave out all the burials which took place here.\n\nFor 1200 years, with a few exceptions, the Kings of France have been buried at Saint Denis. There are more than 70 effigies in the basilica, and the church is considered today to be the most important assembly of funerary sculptures, which date from the 12th to the 16th Centuries. The funeral effigies of Francis I of France, or Henry II of France and Catherine of Medici, and Louis XII and Anne of Brittany, as well as lesser-known figures, reside here. The dynasties of the Merovingian, Carolingian, Capetian, Valois, Valois-Angouleme and Bourbon, reside in St. Denis.\n\nThe tomb of Louis XII and Anne of Brittany, may be the largest in St. Denis Basilica. The tomb was commissioned in 1515, after the death of Louis XII at the age of 52. His Queen, Anne of Brittany, had died one year previously, at the age of 36. The tomb was unveiled in 1531, and represents a distinctive change in style from the medieval effigies that were seen previously, where the focus is on a depiction of a single person. It is a unique interpretation of the cadaver tomb. Although the interior of the tomb does show this, above, King Louis is seated, with his Queen, Anne, kneeling, and both have their hands clasped in prayer. The arches of the tomb contain a number of statues which depict the apostles, and the seven cardinal virtues.\n\nOn 31st of July 1793, during the French Revolution, it was decided that all the royal tombs would be opened and destroyed. This reminder of the Ancient Regime was not only desirous to be rid of, but it was thought that the tombs may contain valuables, and the Revolution was in need of money. Some of the larger monuments were removed first, and many of the old graves were opened. Among them were the graves of Philippe III of France (1245-1285), Pepin the Short, who reigned (751-768), and Queens Isabelle d\u2019Aragon (1248-1271) and Constance de Castille (1136-1160), as well as Louis VI (1081-1137).\n\nIn October of 1793, the desecration of the Abbey of St. Denis\u2019 tombs continued, with more recent tombs being opened. As they opened these graves, they also removed everything of value, including the lead from the coffin itself. The remains of the deceased were collected, and tossed into a large pit outside, which was covered with slaked lime. The destruction continued through January of 1794, with many more graves of Kings, Queens and nobles being desecrated. However, some of the monuments, which were thought to have been skilfully made, were transferred to the Musee des Monuments Francais.\n\nThe funeral statues of Marie Antoinette and King Louis XVI of France, were commissioned by Louis XVIII, in 1815. Different sculptors were chosen for each of the statues, with Pierre Petiotot creating the statue of the Queen, and Edme Gaulle creating that of the King. Petitot completed his statue in 1819, however Gaulle did not finish his work on the King until 1831. The statues were originally located in the crypt but were moved in 1975, to their current location in the Saint-Louis Chapel.\n\nThe Abbey was saved by Napoleon Bonaparte, who appointed Francois Debret to restore the church to its former glory. Debret was more interested in creating something than restoring it, and what he created was a feeling of medievalism, but that did not return what had been lost. He was eventually replaced by Eugene Emmanuel Voillet-le-Duc, who did what he could to fix Debret\u2019s mistakes, and his, more accurate reconstruction, is what we see today.\n\nWhen it comes to the funerary monuments at St. Denis, it is difficult to work out how many of these monuments are authentic, and how many have been re-created. It does appear that most of what we see today, are the monuments which were not destroyed, but moved to the Museum of Monuments, but I have not taken this on a case-by-case basis. The monuments, which had been sent to the Musee des Monuments Francais, were returned to St. Denis in 1816, and established in the crypt. This brought tourists to St. Denis, and is thought to have helped to ignite an interest in the Middle Ages. In 1828, two altars were created on each side of the choir, and the monuments were moved from the crypt to their current locations."}, {"url": "https://www.catholic.com/encyclopedia/abbey-of-saint-denis", "page_content": "Saint-Denis, Abbey of, is situated in a small town, to which it has given its name, about four miles north of Paris. St-Denis (Dionysius), the first Bishop of Paris, and his companions, martyred in 270, were buried here and the small chapel built over the spot became a famous place of pilgrimage during the fifth and sixth centuries. In 630 King Dagobert founded the abbey for Benedictine monks, replacing the original chapel by a large basilica, of which but little now remains. He and his successors enriched the new foundation with many gifts and privileges and, possessing as it did the shrine of St-Denis, it became one of the richest and most important abbeys in France. In 653 it was made exempt from episcopal jurisdiction. A new church was commenced in 750 by Charlemagne, at the consecration of which Christ, according to popular tradition, was supposed to have assisted in person. During the ninth century irregularities crept in and the monks transformed themselves into canons with a relaxed rule. Abbot Hilduin tried in vain to reform them and was obliged to retire for a time, with a few of the more fervent monks, to a neighboring priory. At length, however, he succeeded in bringing about a better state of things and was able to resume the government of his abbey. From that time forward its splendor and importance continued to increase under the wise rule of a succession of great abbots, to whom the right of pontificalia was granted by Alexander III in 1179. Most famous perhaps amongst these was Suger, the thirty-sixth of the series (1122-52). Besides being a great ecclesiastic he was also a great statesman and acted as Regent of France whilst King Louis VII was absent at the Crusades. The present church of St-Denis was commenced by him about 1140 and marks the beginning of the Gothic tendency in architecture and its transition from the Romanesque style. Further additions and alterations under succeeding abbots resulted in producing one of the finest Gothic buildings in France (see Gothic Architecture).\n\nThe abbey figured prominently in the history of France and its abbots were for several centuries amongst the chief seigneurs of the kingdom. The \u201cOriflamme\u201c, originally the banner of the abbey, became the standard of the kings of France and was suspended above the high altar, whence it was only removed when the king took the field in person. Its last appearance was at the battle of Agincourt in 1415. Joan of Arc hung up her arms in the church of St-Denis in 1429. Many kings and princes and other noble persons were buried there and three of the Roman pontiffs stayed in the abbey at different times: Stephen II in 754, Innocent II in 1131, and Eugenius III in 1146. Another great abbot, Matthieu de Vendome, acted as administrator of the kingdom when St. Louis went to the Crusades in 1269. After the Council of Trent the Abbey of St-Denis became the head of a congregation of ten monasteries, and in 1633 it was united, with its dependent houses, to the new Congregation of St-Maur, when its conventual buildings were entirely reconstructed. In 1691 Louis XVI suppressed the abbacy and united the monastery with its revenues to the royal house of noble ladies at St-Cyr, founded by Madame de Maintenon. The abbey was finally dissolved at the revolution, when much damage was done to the church and tombs. It was subsequently restored, under Napoleon III, by Violletle-Duc. The relics of St-Denis, which had been transferred to the parish church of the town in 1795, were brought back again to the abbey in 1819. It is now a \u201cnational monument\u201d and one of the show-places of Paris. Many of the chartularies and other manuscripts relating to its history are now either in the Archives Nationales or the Bibliotheque Nationale.\n\nG.

It is centred on its famous abbey church, which had been the burial place of the kings of France. The church is of major importance in the history of architecture, being the first major edifice marking the transition from the Romanesque to the Gothic style and serving as a model for most of the late 12th-century French Gothic cathedrals, including those at Chartres and Senlis.\n\nKing Dagobert I founded the abbey in the 7th century and built it over the tomb of St. Denis, the patron saint of France. The town gradually grew up around the abbey. Abbot Suger (1136-47) built a new basilica for the abbey that incorporated and adapted part of an earlier church built during the Carolingian Empire (751-987). Suger's church was to transform Western architecture; the Gothic stylistic elements that mark it as a transitional structure can best be seen in the chancel and the ambulatory with its famous stained-glass windows. The west fa\u00e7ade (1137-40) was much restored during the 19th century by Eug\u00e8ne-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc. The choir, apse, and nave were rebuilt in the Gothic style under Louis IX (1214-70).\n\nFor 12 centuries, except for a few kings of the Merovingian (500-751) and Capetian (987-1328) dynasties, all the French kings - from Dagobert I (reigned 629-39) to Louis XVIII (reigned 1814-24) - as well as their close relatives and a number of their outstanding subjects, were buried in the basilica. During the French Revolution, their tombs were desecrated and removed, but they were later reassembled in the church and now constitute a remarkable collection of French funerary sculpture. The monuments on all the tombs of the predecessors of Louis IX (St. Louis; reigned 1226-70) were carved under his orders and are of little interest except for that of Dagobert, which has lively sculptures. After Philip III (d. 1285), the recumbent statues had faces copied from death masks; most of them are striking portraits. During the Renaissance, the mausoleums were elaborate and highly decorated. They are mostly on two levels; on the upper level the monarchs are represented kneeling in court dress, while on the lower level, they are shown lying naked in the rigidity of death. The most remarkable Renaissance tombs include those of Louis XII (1498-1515), Anne of Brittany, Francis I (1515-47), Claude of France, Henry II (1547-59), and Catherine de M\u00e9dicis. The crypt, which Suger built around the foundations of the Carolingian church, contains some Merovingian sarcophagi.\n\nSeveral monastic buildings were added to the abbey complex in the 18th century. These were transformed by Napoleon I into a school for daughters of members of the Legion of Honour (L\u00e9gion d'Honneur), which they remain.\n\nYou can find more information on the Cathedral in its home page (external link).\n\nRecommended viewing from the collection:\n\nStatistics\n\nThe Web Gallery of Art contains 47 images of Saint-Denis Cathedral and its artworks.

The current Gothic cathedral was built in the 12th century. The Kings of France and their families were buried for centuries at the Basilica of Saint-Denis and it is often referred to as the \u201croyal necropolis of France.\u201d The remains of all but three monarchs of France from the 10th century until 1789 are interred at the Basilica of Saint-Denis. The basilica is named after Saint Denis, a patron saint of France, who became the first Bishop of Paris in the third century. He was decapitated on the hill of Montmartre and is said to have carried his head to the site of the current church, indicating where he wanted to be buried.\n\nA shrine-mausoleum was erected on the site of Saint Denis\u2019 grave in about 313 AD. It was enlarged into a basilica with the addition of tombs and monuments and became a place of pilgrimage during the fifth and sixth centuries. Dagobert, King of the Franks (reigned 628 to 637) re-founded the church as the Abbey of Saint-Denis, a Benedictine monastery, and commissioned a new shrine to house Saint Denis\u2019 remains. Abbot Suger (lived c. 1081 \u2013 1151), a confidant of French kings and Abbot of Saint-Denis from 1122, began work around 1135 to rebuild and enlarge the Abbey of Saint-Denis into the Gothic cathedral we see today.\n\n********************\n\nCoronations of the Queen of France\n\nNot all Queens of France, wives of the Kings of France, were crowned. A queen\u2019s coronation could take place years after her marriage or her husband\u2019s accession to the throne. Queens of France were crowned either together with their husband at Notre-Dame de Reims, or alone at Sainte-Chapelle or the Basilica of Saint-Denis. Marie de Medici, the wife of King Henri IV, was the last of Queen of France to be crowned. She was crowned ten years after her marriage and her husband was assassinated the day after her coronation.\n\nThe Queens of France who were crowned at the Basilica of Saint-Denis include the following:\n\n********************\n\nDestruction and Restoration\n\nDuring the French Revolution, the remains of French royals were desecrated and some tombs and effigies were destroyed. By the decree on August 1, 1793, the National Convention ordered: \u201cThe tombs and mausoleums of the former kings, mounted in the Church of Saint-Denis, in temples and in other places, across the entire Republic, will be destroyed.\u201d This occurred systematically from August 1793 \u2013 October 1793. The remains of 46 kings, 32 queens, and 63 other royals were thrown into two large pits in the monks\u2019 cemetery adjacent to the Basilica of Saint-Denis and covered in quicklime and soil. A combination of seventy effigies and tombs were saved because of the efforts of archaeologist Alexandre Lenoir who claimed them as artworks for his Museum of French Monuments.\n\nNapoleon I, Emperor of the French reopened the Basilica of Saint-Denis in 1806 but left the royal remains in their mass graves. One of the first things King Louis XVIII, a younger brother of the guillotined King Louis XVI, did after the Bourbon Restoration in 1814 was to order a search for the remains of his brother and sister-in-law, King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette. They had been originally been buried in the cemetery at the Madeleine Church and covered with quicklime. The few remains that were found were reburied at the Basilica of Saint-Denis on January 21, 1815, the twenty-second anniversary of King Louis XVI\u2019s execution.\n\nIn 1817, King Louis XVIII ordered the mass graves adjacent to the Basilica of Saint-Denis to be opened but due to the damage from the quicklime, identification of the remains was impossible. The remains were collected into an ossuary, a site serving as the final resting place of human skeletal remains, in the crypt of the basilica. Large marble plates on either side of the gated door leading to the crypt are engraved with the names of those whose remains are buried in the crypt. The seventy effigies and tombs that Alexandre Lenoir saved were returned to the Basilica of Saint-Denis and are now mostly in their original places.\n\n********************\n\nThe Heart of Louis-Charles, Dauphin of France, son of King Louis XVI\n\nLouis-Charles, Dauphin of France, son of King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette, and sometimes called King Louis XVII, died from tuberculosis on June 8, 1795, at the age of ten while imprisoned at the Temple, the remains of a medieval fortress in Paris. He was buried at the Cimeti\u00e8re Sainte-Marguerite in Paris in a grave without any marker. However, before Louis-Charles was buried, an autopsy was performed. Following the tradition of preserving royal hearts, Louis-Charles\u2019s heart was removed and smuggled out during the autopsy by Dr. Philippe-Jean Pelletan, a royalist, who then preserved the heart in alcohol. After the Bourbon Restoration in 1815, Dr. Pellatan offered the heart to Louis-Charles\u2019 paternal uncle King Louis XVIII but he refused because he could not bring himself to believe that it was the heart of his nephew. Following the July Revolution in 1830, Dr. Pelletan\u2019s son found the heart in the remnants of a looted palace and placed it in the crystal urn where it still resides. After the death of Dr. Pelletan\u2019s son in 1879, Eduard Dumont, a relative of Dr. Pelletan\u2019s wife, took possession of the heart.\n\nIn 1895, Carlos, Duke of Madrid, the Legitimist claimant to the French throne, accepted the heart from Eduard Dumont. The heart was kept at Schloss Frohsdorf near Vienna, Austria. Upon the death of his father Carlos, Duke of Madrid in 1909, Jaime, Duke of Madrid, the next Legitimist claimant to the French throne, inherited the heart and gave it to his sister Beatriz.\n\nDuring World War II, Schloss Frohsdorf suffered damage and the heart was rescued by descendants of Carlos, Duke of Madrid and ultimately came into the possession of his granddaughter Princess Marie des Neiges Massimo. In 1975, the princess offered the heart to the Memorial of Saint-Denis in Paris, the organization that oversees the royal graves at the Basilica of St. Denis. The heart was placed in an underground crypt at the basilica where the remains of French royals that were desecrated during the French Revolution were subsequently interred.\n\nIn 2004, DNA tests using mitochondrial DNA proved the heart really did belong to Louis-Charles. Comparison samples were taken from descendants of Marie Antoinette\u2019s sisters, members of the Bourbon-Parma family including Queen Anne of Romania who was born a Princess of Bourbon-Parma, and a strand of Marie Antoinette\u2019s hair. With the approval of the French government, the Legitimists organized a ceremony at the Basilica of St. Denis on June 8, 2004, the 209th anniversary of Louis-Charles\u2019 death. His heart was placed in a niche near the graves of his parents Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette whose remains were transferred to the basilica in 1815.\n\n********************\n\nRoyal Burials\n\n*Unofficial Royalty article\n\nhttps://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_des_personnes_enterr%C3%A9es_dans_la_basilique_Saint-Denis\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

The building is of unique importance historically and architecturally, as its choir completed in 1144 is considered to be the first Gothic church. The site originated as a Gallo-Roman cemetery in late Roman times. The archeological remains still lie beneath the cathedral; the people buried there seem to have had a faith that was a mix of Christian and pre-Christian beliefs and practices. Around 475 St. Genevieve purchased some land and built Saint-Denys de la Chapelle. In 636 on the orders of Dagobert I the relics of Saint Denis, a patron saint of France, were reinterred in the basilica.\n\nThe basilica became a place of pilgrimage and the burial place of the French kings, with nearly every king from the 10th to the 18th centuries being buried there, as well as many from previous centuries. Saint-Denis soon became the abbey church of a growing monastic complex.\n\nIn the 12th century the Abbot Suger rebuilt portions of the abbey church using innovative structural and decorative features. In doing so, he is said to have created the first truly Gothic building. Before the term 'Gothic' came into common use, it was known as the 'French Style' (Opus Francigenum). The basilica\"s 13th-century nave is also the prototype for the Rayonnant Gothic style, and provided an architectural model for cathedrals and abbeys of northern France, England and other countries.\n\nAs it now stands, the church is a large cruciform building of 'basilica' form; that is, it has a central nave with lower aisles and clerestory windows. It has an additional aisle on the northern side formed of a row of chapels. The west front has three portals, a rose window and one tower, on the southern side. The eastern end, which is built over a crypt, is apsidal, surrounded by an ambulatory and a chevet of nine radiating chapels. The basilica retains stained glass of many periods (although most of the panels from Suger\"s time have been removed for long-term conservation and replaced with photographic transparencies), including exceptional modern glass, and a set of twelve misericords.\n\nReferences:"}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/saint-denis-en-france-abbey", "page_content": "SAINT-DENIS-EN-FRANCE, ABBEY OF\n\nOne of the oldest of the Parisian abbeys, located a short distance from the city of Paris, especially noted as the repository of the tombs of French monarchs. The basilica was erected on the site where, according to tradition, the body of the martyred Bishop St. denis was buried (c. 273). The Abbot hilduin (819) gave currency to the erroneous identification of the Parisian martyr with pseudo-dionysius the Areopagite. Hilduin also reformed the abbey and is thought to have visualized Saint-Denis as a second Rome. Some have seen in this the beginnings of gallicanism. It was again reformed by odilo of cluny in 1008. The Benedictines took over the abbey in 656 and remained there until 1792.\n\nThe history of the abbey is inextricably bound up with that of the French kings, its greatest benefactors. King Dagobert I (d. 639) endowed it and aided in the reconstruction of the church. He and his successors were buried there. pepin the Short (d. 768) also began the rebuilding of parts of the structure that was completed under charlemagne. The Capetians similarly maintained close ties with the abbey. louis vi (d. 1137) adopted its standard, the Oriflamme, as the banner of the kings of France, and he chose as his principal adviser Abbot suger, who served also as administrator of the kingdom in the succeeding reign, while louis vii was absent on the Second crusade (1147\u201349). Under Abbot Suger, reconstruction of the basilica was begun June 9, 1140; it was he who collected and continued the chronicles of the abbey. In the 13th-century reconstruction under its architect, Pierre de Montereau, the abbey took on the characteristic features of the Gothic style, for which it became noted. louis ix (d. 1270) treasured the abbey for this reason as one of the most precious of French monuments.\n\nThe later history of the abbey is a record of additions, demolition, reconstruction, and decline. During the Hundred Years' War, ramparts and towers were added; and the abbey was successively captured and recaptured by Armagnacs, English, and Burgundians. During this time, many of its monuments and possessions disappeared, including several royal tombs. The church was further pillaged during the civil and religious wars of the 16th and 17th centuries. During this time some of the 13th-century buildings were demolished and replaced by others inspired by classical models. In 1528 Saint-Denis became a commendatory abbey; in 1691 the title and office of abbot were suppressed and were replaced by that of prior. However, the abbey suffered the greatest destruction and desecration in the 18th century. In 1700 demolition of the claustral building was begun, and in 1771 the western fa\u00e7ade was enlarged. In 1781 a black and white pavement was added to cover up the 12th-century pavement. The church was pillaged between 1792 and 1794, following the overthrow of the monarchy. Equally damaging to the early church were the well-intended efforts at restoration made by napoleon i and his successors. Between 1847 and 1879 Viollet-le-Duc carried on the work of reconstruction. The abbey suffered further damage in the bombardment of Paris in 1871 and in the 20th-century wars.\n\nBibliography: Source. suger, Abbot Suger on the Abbey Church of St. Denis and Its Art Treasures, ed. and tr. e. panofsky (Princeton 1946).

The introduction of a choir with ambulatory and radiating chapels, which defines church plans for the next four centuries, is found at the Church of Sainte-Foy at Conques, built between 1039 and 1065 and the contemporary Church of Notre\u2013Dame at Paray\u2013le\u2013Monial.\n\n1095 At Clermont, Pope Urban II calls for a holy war, later known as the First Crusade. Spurred by appeals from the Byzantine emperor Alexios Komnenos and reports of difficulties from Christian pilgrims in the Holy Land, the West launches a military campaign to wrest the holy city of Jerusalem from Muslim control. While armies are assembled, a \u201cPeople\u2019s Crusade\u201d sets out, terrorizing Jews on their route. Poorly armed and disorganized, most never reach enemy territory; those who do, perish at the hands of a superior Muslim force. On July 15, 1099, the main Crusader forces led by the nobility take Jerusalem.\n\nfrom 1100 Extensive programs of architectural sculpture are initiated throughout the country. The earliest capitals with narrative decoration appear in Chauvigny around 1080, bearing the signature of their sculptor Gofridus, and at Cluny and Saint-Beno\u00eet-sur-Loire around 1100. Imposing sculptural reliefs decorate the tympana set over doors of churches such as V\u00e9zelay (ca. 1120) and Autun (ca. 1120\u201335) in Burgundy, Moissac (ca. 1115\u201330) in the south, and Chartres (ca. 1150) just west of Paris. The first jamb statues flanking doors adorn the west facades\u2014the principal church entrances\u2014of the royal abbey of Saint-Denis by 1140 and of Chartres Cathedral by 1150.\n\n1112 Saint Bernard (1090\u20131153) joins the abbey of C\u00eeteaux, founded in 1098 near Dijon in an effort to adhere more strictly to Benedictine rule and to restore monastic rigor. Bernard founds the abbey of Clairvaux in 1115. Under his leadership, the Cistercian order flourishes, with 350 houses at his death in 1153. Concerned with maintaining orthodoxy, Bernard becomes involved in the fight against heresy in southwestern France and, in 1146 at V\u00e9zelay, calls for the Second Crusade. In a famous diatribe, he criticizes sculpture in churches and monasteries as distracting both for the clergy and the faithful.\n\nJuly 1137 Eleanor of Aquitaine marries the man who, two months later, becomes King Louis VII of France. She brings to the marriage the duchy of Aquitaine\u2014a far larger domain than that possessed by the French kings. Their marriage is annulled in 1152, and Eleanor immediately marries Henry Plantagenet, who becomes Henry II, king of England, in 1154. This marriage brings Aquitaine, Normandy, and England under one rule, marking the beginning of English presence in France. Eleanor\u2019s court at Poitiers becomes a great center for poetry and culture.\n\n1140\u20131150 Abbot Suger (ca. 1081\u2013ca. 1151), advisor to Louis VI and Louis VII, begins to remodel the royal abbey church of Saint-Denis outside Paris, the burial site of French rulers since Carolingian times. In 1144, Louis VII and Eleanor of Aquitaine attend the consecration of the choir, remarkable for its open, light-filled spaces. Suger\u2019s architectural innovations spell out the basic principles of Gothic architecture. The abbot also commissions precious objects to furnish the abbey, believing, as he explains in his own written account of the building and refurbishment of Saint-Denis, that only the finest materials are worthy of God.\n\n12th century Paris nurtures a considerable community of scholars, including Peter Abelard, Peter Lombard, and John of Salisbury. It becomes the leading center in Europe for the study of theology and the liberal arts. The university of Paris is founded between 1150 and 1170.\n\nca. 1150\u20131300 Bishops and architects around Paris experiment with architectural forms as they compete to create ever larger and taller churches, such as the Cathedral of Saint-Stephen, Bourges. The collapse in 1284 of the 64-meter-high vault of the Cathedral of Saint-Pierre Beauvais marks the technical limits of Gothic architecture.\n\n1180 Philip Augustus (d. 1223) ascends to the French throne. During his reign, official documents begin to speak of \u201ca king of France\u201d rather than \u201cthe king of the Franks.\u201d Philip augments the royal domain through marriage and conquest, extending his territorial influence to much of what is modern-day France. He reforms his administration, increases the royal treasury, and builds extensive defenses. In establishing the court permanently at Paris in 1194, he secures its place as the capital.\n\n13th century Spreading the weight of vaults over a series of ribs, columns, and pilasters, Gothic architecture allows the dissolution of the wall. Windows in cathedrals and churches are filled with stained glass; the shimmering colored light transfigures the vast interiors. Depicting biblical stories, scenes from the lives of the saints, or single figures, stained-glass windows complement the sculptures on the exterior and the rites and ceremonies observed within.\n\n1209 The Albigensian Crusade is launched by Pope Innocent III with the help of Cistercian monks. While the original spark for this war springs from papal desire to extinguish the growing problem of heresy in the region surrounding Toulouse, the political struggle between the independent southern territories and lords from northern France, joined after 1226 by Louis VIII, plays itself out in a war. In 1229, Count Raymond VII of Toulouse, who had been Louis VIII\u2019s main adversary, is compelled to cede territory to the king\u2019s control.\n\nca. 1210\u20131250 Artists at Chartres install an elaborate and extensive program of stained-glass windows in the cathedral under construction there. In addition to religious and historical subjects, the intensely colored windows depict numerous scenes of tradespeople at work, including bakers, furriers, wheelwrights, and weavers. These tradespeople were likely contributors\u2014through hefty taxes\u2014to the construction of the church.\n\n1226 Louis IX (d. 1270), grandson of Philip Augustus, becomes king. A pious man involved in works of charity and with a strong sense of his responsibilities, he exemplifies the virtues of the Christian knight. A protector both of the university and the arts, Louis IX makes Paris a thriving cultural center. Having bought the Crown of Thorns from the Byzantine emperor in 1237, Louis IX commissions the Sainte-Chapelle, his royal chapel on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 in Paris, as its reliquary. During his long reign, the capital becomes a center for the production of all precious arts: manuscript illumination, ivory carving, and goldsmiths\u2019 work. Louis is canonized in 1297, less than thirty years after his death.\n\n1274 The Capetian kings foster national unity through the use of one language. The monk Primat translates the Grandes chroniques de France, a manuscript written at Saint-Denis celebrating the Capetian dynasty, from Latin into French.\n\n1300s With 20 million inhabitants, France is reputed the most powerful nation in Europe, as compared to Germany with a population of 14 million and England with 4 million.\n\n1309\u20131367 Due in part to political insecurity in Italy, the French pope Clement V takes up residence in Avignon, which at the time belongs to the count of Provence, a vassal of the king of France. The papal court at Avignon attracts intellectuals and artists from France and Italy, among them Petrarch and Simone Martini.\n\n1320s Endemic wars and the development of sea trade contribute to the decline of the annual fairs held in the county of Champagne east of Paris. Diverse wares such as Flemish cloth and tapestry work, Chinese silk, Egyptian satin, Eastern spices, furs from the North, and even wax from Russia had been available at these fairs, which made the region a crucial center of international commerce and banking since the late eleventh century.\n\n1328 Philip VI, the first French king from the Valois branch of the Capetian dynasty, ascends to the French throne.\n\n1348 The Black Death reaches France, killing, according to chronicler Jean Froissart, a third of the population."}, {"url": "https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/477724", "page_content": "Resources for Research\n\nThe Met's Libraries and Research Centers provide unparalleled resources for research and welcome an international community of students and scholars.\n\nThe Met Collection API is where all makers, creators, researchers, and dreamers can connect to the most up-to-date data and public domain images for The Met collection.
