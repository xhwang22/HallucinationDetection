This can be particularly difficult for lead vocalists going in to work with another artist or producer, but can also apply to an instrumentalist taking on a lead role.\n\nYou may have been booked for a recording session, or are getting into recording work and don\u2019t quite understand what you should be asking for or are entitled to for your performance on the recording.\n\nHere we have provided some guidance and questions for you to ask the engager, in order for you to make an informed decision and understand where it might be necessary to negotiate.\n\nThis guidance includes:\n\nHere we explain the contractual differences between a session musician and a featured recording artist.\n\nContracting as a session musician\n\nA session musician is a performer who plays a musical instrument or performs vocals in a live or recorded session or gig, is not a featured artist (usually the artist or band whose name the track is released under), and is generally engaged on a session by session basis.\n\nSession musicians can be engaged directly by a production company or record label, but are often engaged via a fixer (also known as a contractor) who has signed an agreement with the MU.\n\nA session musician should sign a consent form for the session work they are engaged for, which would grant a particular set of rights. For example, a BPI/MU session form might be signed for a commercial audio release, but further fees would be due if that recording was picked up for something else, like synchronisation into a TV show or film.\n\nIt is therefore important to establish what specific rights a session musician would be granting, as they will each attract a different fee. Where fees for the secondary and further use of recordings are due, the MU have a mandate to collect and distribute those fees to session musicians.\n\nThe collective agreements that session musicians are engaged under, are negotiated by the MU with record companies, film producers, broadcasters etc and include minimum rates for the musicians to be paid. As these are minimum rates, musicians of course have the right to negotiate higher if they wish.\n\nOnce they have provided the relevant consent and performed on the recording, the session musician is paid their session fee, and the relevant rights being paid for are granted to the engager. Where applicable the session musician is entitled to Equitable Remuneration, which can be collected and distributed through PPL, but there would usually be no ongoing royalty from use of the master recording as is normally the case in a featured artist\u2019s deal.\n\nThe session fee is paid and, unless there is a further use required down the line as outlined above, that is the deal done and the engager has nothing further to pay the musician/vocalist.\n\nContracting as a featured recording artist\n\nGenerally, a featured artist is the artist or band whose name a track is released under. Often featured artists will be contracted to an ongoing arrangement with a record label, but they may have agreements with another recording rights holder or in the case of self-releasing artists, be the exclusive rightsholder themselves.\n\nIn each of these cases this would normally mean that the featured artist is entitled to royalty income from exploitation of the recording, with ownership of the recording usually sitting with whoever paid for them to be created.\n\nWhere there is an ongoing agreement between the featured artist and a recording rights holder, and that company owns the recordings, it is likely the deal would encompass all uses of the recording. The agreement itself will include terms which clarify how the performer will be paid for each specific use. For example, where income is generated through sales/streams of the recording, the featured artist would receive income based on an agreed royalty rate.\n\nAlternatively, an artist that owns their recordings may decide to licence certain rights to labels/recording rights holders or licensees, so they can provide assistance in areas such as distribution, administration and marketing. Again, the agreement would clarify how the performer would be paid for each specific use.\n\nMany featured artist deals will also include advances, which can be recouped against income generated through the recording.\n\nThe terms and royalty rates in a featured artist agreement can vary, and are agreed through the individual negotiation of that contract. This is unlike the session musician deals which have set minimum terms, agreed through the MU\u2019s collective agreements.\n\nA performer has the right to be credited whether they are a featured artist or session musician, but in practice this will be in different ways. A featured performer engaging on a session should expect to be a named artist on the recording, and the same would apply if they are recording with another featured artist. Their name would be included directly alongside other artists\u2019 names, or as a \u2018featuring\u2019 artist.\n\nThis is different for session musicians, who would not be a named artist on the track. However, a label would be expected to use their reasonable endeavours to credit the session musicians\u2019 performance in the liner notes, or digital equivalent for the release.\n\nCredits are also gathered by companies such as Jaxsta who work to build complete sets of credit data for recordings, and this would be for all performers involved. DDEX (Digital Data Exchange) are an organisation that work to create standards for digital data internationally, in order to make data more accurate and the exchange of that data more efficient.\n\nDigital Service Provider (DSP) Crediting\n\nIf you have agreed to be a featured performer on the recording and would like any streams to be counted towards your artist page on the DSP\u2019s (Spotify, Apple Music etc) you use, you can request to be listed on the priority artist section. This is handled at the upload stage by the label or distributor, so can be discussed directly with them, and ensures that the stream count on your monthly listeners will be increased by the streams of that recording.\n\nIf you are not listed on the priority artist section, you should still be credited in the \u2018Appears on\u2019 section on Spotify or other DSP equivalent to that, but the streams would not count towards your monthly listeners. It should be considered that in some cases, although you are credited as featuring, you may not wish to be closely associated to the track on the DSP. You could for example have played a lead role, but it is not the genre/sound you want related to your own artist page or \u2018Popular\u2019 section on the DSP. Therefore, you would not ask to be registered on the priority artist line and would stay on the \"Appears on\"section.\n\nIt is also worth noting that if you are listed in the priority artist section, it does not affect the streaming numbers or associated pages of any other artist on the recording. It is purely to receive streaming stats based on recordings you have performed on.\n\nIn many territories across the world, a performer has the right to Equitable Remuneration (sometimes referred to as Neighbouring Rights) when a sound recording they performed on is played or broadcast to the public.\n\nIn most cases in the UK, these rights are administered by PPL, who collect and distribute the royalties to the rights holder, featured performers and non-featured performers (session musicians). The money is split 50/50 between the rights holder (often a record label) and the performers. The performer's 50% is then split further, with the featured performers receiving a larger cut than the non-featured performers, usually split around 65/35.\n\nThe right to Equitable Remuneration cannot be assigned to another party and can be a valuable income source for both featured artists and session musicians. Therefore, it is important for performers to register with PPL and claim against any tracks they performed on, that are registered.\n\nWhen entering discussions to perform and record with an artist or producer, it is important to determine whether you will be contracted as a session musician or featured artist, and whether you believe that the role expected of you, fits with that offer.\n\nThe nature of the work might make this easy to determine. You could perhaps be told that you will be a named artist on a single, which would make a featured artist deal appropriate. Or that you are performing alongside a number of other musicians as backing vocalists, in the same session musician role.\n\nHowever, it is not always that straightforward, particularly when a performer is asked to take on a lead role, or the information you have received does not provide clarity.\n\nIn those cases, the deal may require negotiation and questions can be put to the engager that will allow you to position yourself better within those discussions.\n\nQuick checklist: Identify your role \u2013 Are you a lead performer or soloist? Backing performer perhaps, or performing as part of an ensemble or group? What is the nature of the work? \u2013 Who is it for and how will the recording be used? What\u2019s the deal? \u2013 How is the deal structured, what will you be paid and is it being contracted as session work, or featured? Who will be your main point of contact? \u2013 Who can you ask questions relating to the work? Who will your contract be with? What\u2019s happening at the session? \u2013 Once the work has started, is your role what they said it would be? Does the deal need to change or be discussed further?\n\nIt is important to discuss the matter before agreeing to the work if you think the terms are not quite right, and to make sure you and the engager are on the same page. Here are some questions that will allow you to position yourself better during your discussions.\n\nDoes the information provided by the engager give you an indication of your role, and whether you will be contracted as a session musician or featured artist?\n\nUse the definition guidance provided above and information in the engager\u2019s offer to establish how they will be contracting you. Or, is there more information they need to provide around the nature of the work and what will be expected of you within the session? How will you be remunerated for your work and what contract are they suggesting you sign \u2013 an MU session agreement or a bespoke featured contract perhaps? If key information has not been provided, ask for it.\n\nWhat is the nature of the work and how will the recording be used?\n\nHow the finished recording or track will be used will not determine whether the agreement should be a session or featured contract, but in some cases might provide some indication. If the recordings are not linked to a commercial release and are only to be exploited through other areas such as synchronisation and broadcast, it might highlight that it is session-based work. This could be the recording of a film score, production music, jingles or even advertising work, often performed by session musicians for the specific purpose of synchronisation and broadcast.\n\nIf you are taking on a lead role, how is your deal being structured to compensate for that?\n\nThis could be by contracting you as a featured artist, with a fee paid, plus ongoing royalty income (points) from exploitation of the recording. Or if agreed that you are not quite taking on a featured role but providing lead, could you be engaged as a session musician but still agree an ongoing royalty anyway? Consider all options and remember that these deals can be structured in a number of different ways if taking on a lead role, so you are free to negotiate.\n\nBear in mind that what you agree may also affect how your performance is classified for PPL purposes, and therefore your share of equitable remuneration for subsequent broadcast/public performance of the recording. Remember that for members, any agreement that you are offered can be sent to the MU and checked through the Contract Advisory Service. Or even if you have just been approached with an offer you wish to discuss, the MU can talk you through it.\n\nIf other musicians are being engaged, do they have the same role as you and how does their role differ?\n\nThis information might not be apparent when you are first approached by the engager, but it is worth checking what other musicians/vocalists are involved in the session and what roles they will have. For example, it might be that you are providing vocals alongside other backing vocalists, which would suggest you would be working as a session performer. On the other hand, you might be provided with information that highlights that you are taking on more of a lead/featured role.\n\nWhen you are at the session, is your role what they said it would be?\n\nConsider whether you are being asked to do anything additional to what was agreed before the session. Are you now being asked to take on a lead role perhaps or even to get involved creatively? If you are, it needs to be acknowledged and discussed at the earliest possible stage. Approach the situation with the engager and see how you can be appropriately remunerated for that role. On the performance side, it could be negotiating royalty income (points) from exploitation of the recording.\n\nIf involved creatively you might be in a position to agree a writer\u2019s share. Those that have created any part of a song/composition have the right to a percentage, which would need to be agreed between yourself and the other writers. Those involved in the writing are free to negotiate song splits/percentages as they feel necessary and come to an agreement on what all writing parties think is fair. An MU Song Share Agreement can then be signed to confirm the details.\n\nIt can be difficult to immediately come to an agreement while in the session, but if approached in the correct manner, all parties should be able to have an open discussion about how the agreement has developed and what else needs to be put in place. If agreeing to anything while in the session, always try and get something in writing."}, {"url": "https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beau+Brummels/+wiki", "page_content": "The Beau Brummels were an American rock band, formed in San Francisco in 1964. The band's original lineup included Sal Valentino (lead vocals), Ron Elliott (lead guitar and main songwriter), Ron Meagher (bass guitar), Declan Mulligan (rhythm guitar, bass, harmonica), and John Petersen (drums). The Beau Brummels were discovered by Autumn Records, where Sylvester Stewart\u2014later known as Sly Stone\u2014produced the group's early recording sessions. Initially, the band's musical style blended beat music and folk music, and has been described as early and influential folk rock. Much like their contemporaries, The Byrds, their early music drew comparisons to the Beatles. Their later work incorporated other music genres such as psychedelic rock and country rock.\n\nThe Beau Brummels broke into the mainstream with their debut single, \"Laugh, Laugh\", for which they would later be credited for setting the aesthetic foundation for the San Francisco Sound. The band's popularity continued with the subsequent album, 1965's Introducing the Beau Brummels, and the Top 10 single \"Just a Little\". The group's commercial success declined by the following year, at which time the financially struggling Autumn label was acquired by Warner Bros. Records. After recording an album of cover songs, Beau Brummels '66, the band released a pair of critically acclaimed albums: Triangle in 1967 and Bradley's Barn in 1968.\n\nThe band underwent several personnel changes, beginning with Mulligan's departure in 1965. Guitarist Don Irving joined the band in late 1965 when Elliott began to suffer seizures resulting from a diabetic condition, leaving him unable to tour with the band. Shortly after the release of Beau Brummels '66, Irving left the group when he was inducted into the armed forces. Petersen left to join Harpers Bizarre, reducing the Beau Brummels to a trio for the recording of Triangle. Meagher was drafted for military service in 1968, leaving Valentino and Elliott as the only remaining band members. The duo worked with prominent Nashville session musicians to record Bradley's Barn before parting ways in 1969 to focus on solo material and participate in projects by other artists. The five original Beau Brummels reformed in 1974, and the band released an eponymous album the following year."}, {"url": "https://jukebugs.com/the-beau-brummels-members-of-the-rock-band-where-are-they/", "page_content": "It\u2019s difficult to speak about music in the 1960/1970s without mentioning The Beau Brummels. The band is especially recognized in the evolution of the country-rock music genre and what has come to be referred to as the San Francisco Sound.\n\nThe band whose original lineup was made up of a group of friends were discovered by local disc jockeys with a new record label looking for musicians to sign. In their early career, their sound was a blend of folk and beat music but as their career progressed, they incorporated various musical genres like country rock and psychedelic rock.\n\nThe band was active between 1964 to 1969 and then 1974 to 1975. Some of their well-received songs like Laugh, Laugh has made it to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the songs that shaped Rock and Roll. During the height of their popularity, they were considered teen idols and appeared on various television music variety shows like Shindig, American Bandstand, Hullabaloo, and films like Wild Wild Winter and Village of Giants.\n\nWho are the members of The Beau Brummels Rock Band?\n\nSal Valentino was the brain behind the band when it first began. He was the one who dreamed of it before going on to introduce others to form The Beau Brummels.\n\nHe began to perform at a young age with a series of appearances on television. His performances got him a regular gig at a club (El Cid, San Francisco). To form a much-needed band he called on his childhood friend Ron Elliot who was a guitarist and songwriter. Ron then recruited the other members which included Declan Mulligan (singer/ rhythm guitarist), Ron Meagher (bassist), and Victor Savant (pianist).\n\nAs they performed at the club, they got a more lucrative deal to perform at another club (Morocco Room, San Mateo, California. The owner of the club (Rich Romanello) invited disc jockeys Tom Donahue and Bobby Mitchell to listen to them at the club as they were looking for new acts to sign to their upcoming record label (Autumn Records). They quickly signed them and their early records were produced by Sly Stone.\n\nThe Beau Brummels band\u2019s original members include the following\n\nSal Valentino as lead vocalist, tambourine. (1964- 1969, 1974-75)\n\nRon Elliott as lead guitarist, backing vocals and occasional lead vocals. (1964- 1969, 1974-75)\n\nRon Meagher as bassist and backing vocals (1964- 1967, 1974)\n\nDeclan Mulligan as the rhythm guitarist, backing vocals and harmonica.(1964- 1965, 1974-75)\n\nJohn Peterson as the drummer. (1964- 1966, 1974-75)\n\nThe subsequent members of The Beau Brummels include\n\nDon Irving as guitarist and backing vocals. (1965-1966)\n\nDan Levitt played the banjo and guitar (1974-1975)\n\nPeter Tepp played the drums for their 1975 tour.\n\nAs much as they tried to keep it together, the band naturally went through changes in personnel over time. Mulligan left the band in 1965 and was replaced by Don Irving.\n\nElliott left the group next as he constantly suffered seizures due to his diabetic condition. So he had difficulty touring with the band.\n\nIn 1966, Irving got inducted into the armed forces so had to leave. Peterson left the band to join Harpers Bizarre. Meagher was also drafted into the military.\n\nIn 1974, four of the original members with a new member came together to work on another album which was then released in 1975.\n\nWhere are they?\n\nAfter recording a self-titled studio album that was released in 1975, The Beau Brummels members split up again but continued to appear in several incarnations between the late 1970s to the mid-1990s. They featured in shows alongside The Dinosaurs, The Smithereens, and performed at shows like the Baypop Festival 2000, Summer of Love Festival 2002.\n\nDespite the band split of several years, Valentino didn\u2019t release his first solo album until 2006. The album was titled Dreamin\u2019 Man and he went ahead to release two more solo albums in late 2006 and 2008. Unfortunately, John Peterson died on the 11th of November 2007 due to a heart attack.\n\nAs recently as 2013, the original band members came together again to record a studio album that was released on Bay Sound Records in March. The new album contained fifteen songs written by Elliott and some drum tracks recorded by late Peterson in 1965. They did the re-recording of some of their well-known songs including \u201cLaugh, Laugh\u201d, \u201cJust a Little\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Talk to Strangers\u201d.\n\nAlthough the band members continue to concentrate on their individual lives and careers, the band remains a favorite for Classic Rock Lovers."}, {"url": "https://music.metason.net/artistinfo?name=Ron%20Meagher", "page_content": "ArtistInfo App\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nArtistInfo for iOS and ArtistInfo for Mac are presenting musicians, composers and producers that are envolved in the musical work that you are listening to in Apple Music, iTunes, or Spotify.

It\u2019s a common belief that the need for a stand-in studio musician in recording sessions has decreased over the last ten years, in large due to the effects of technological advancements and shift to sample-based productions.\n\nOn the other hand, \u200bthe need for session musicians in musical performances has increased, compensating for reduction in studio session work. \u200bOverall, the growth projected for the next 10 years is just slightly behind the average across all industries.\n\nWork opportunities for musicians and vocalists are expected to increase by around 6% by 2026, according to the \u200bU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u200b. To put that in perspective, the projected growth rate for all occupations in this time frame is 7%.\n\nA session musician can be hired by anybody that needs to record music: a band, music producer, music contractor, even a video producer. Therefore, their duties vary based on a type of job he or she is hired for, but their skills remain in high demand.\n\nIn this article, we are going to cover all the basics you should know if you are seeking to become a session musician or hire one.\n\nWhat is a Session Musician?\n\nA session musician is a singer or an instrumentalist, such as guitar player, piano player, etc., hired by a band, producer, artist or record label to \u200bperform music in a studio recording session\u200b. That\u2019s why session musicians are very often also called \u201cstudio musicians\u201d.\n\nDuring the 1950\u2019s and 60\u2019s, this job was very popular and almost every local scene (especially in New York, Los Angeles, and Nashville) had its session musicians they worked with on a regular basis. Of course, every one\u2019s goal was to get into one of these \u201cA-list\u201d circles. They pay was high and consistent.\n\nWith growth of the music industry and globalization, a session musician\u2019s work expanded to include supporting artists on tours as a band musician and musical performances for live events, amongst others.\n\nWhat Makes a Good Session Musician?\n\nWhat makes a session musician different from others is the \u200bquality of musicianship\u200b and versatility\u200b. The ability to deliver professional quality studio tracks fast, in various settings, is the cornerstone of every session musician.\n\nSession musicians are hired only because their skills are above other musicians out there and the quality they produce is better. \u200bThose two attributes make them more expensive as well, so artists treat them as an investment into their music.\n\nMost of these musicians specialize in playing an instrument of their choice, yet some of them are multi-skilled and can play several instruments or perform several roles, such as recording tracks, helping with arrangements, writing out scores, etc.\n\nApart from having the needed musical skills, \u200b\u201cA-list\u201d session musicians\u200b have strong interpersonal skills and maintain a professional way of behavior.\u200b In this job, it is really important to make sure that \u200byou are a person a band and recording studio would like to work with.\u200b\n\nBe someone that is nice, easy-going, and comes to rehearsals on time. This might not seem that important, but you\u2019ll be surprised how much people appreciate reliable and likable musicians. When time is money, professional behavior matters a lot. Let\u2019s dive deeper.\n\nHow to Become a Session Musician?\n\nWell, there is not an exam you can take to become a session musician, though there are university programs related to the career. It mainly requires you to be at the right place at the right time and stand out from others. Of course, networking makes a huge difference, as we\u2019ll mention.\n\nThe only prerequisites for being a successful session musician are to be a top-notch expert in your instrument, have vast musical knowledge you can easily reference and strong understanding of music theory. There is no certification required or available.\n\nYou have to be able to improvise on the spot, to play whatever genre is needed without having any issues with it. You have to be ready (and able) to play any style of music, to cope with any type of musician, and be open to various types of session work.\n\nThe next really important step in becoming a session musician is \u200bnetworking\u200b. Try to get to know different players, introduce yourself and give your details out, etc. Go to different gigs and shows, watch bands and meet fellow players. Don\u2019t be shy to reach out to \u200blocal recording studios or offer your services online (check out \u200bCraiglist\u200b in a big city like New York to see this in action).\n\nFurthermore,\u200b \u200byou should work on self-advertising online with a music marketing plan.\u200b Be present on social media or create your own website\u200b. Create a profile on Youtube or Facebook and document all sorts of things you are doing as a musician in general and specifically as a hired gun.\n\nThink of it as an \u200bonline portfolio\u200b and proof of claims on your resume that, of course, needs to be updated regularly. You\u2019re building confidence that you are who you claim to be for your potential employers.\n\nAll these tips improve the odds of you being the right person at the right place at the right time \u200bas\u200b \u200bmore people are going to be aware of you, your skills and expertise. As they say in business, be everywhere at all times (omni-present marketing).\n\nSession Musician Jobs & Salary\n\nBeing a session musician is basically a freelance job, however it is not impossible to make a good living in this profession. The rates session musicians charge can be fixed, but more often they are hourly and, of course, depend on the musicians\u2019 experience and expertise.\n\nThat being said, the hourly rates can range from minimum wage to a couple hundred bucks per hour. \u200bAll in all \u2013 the more gigs you manage to book, the more you can earn, especially as you build relationships with the same clients over time.\n\nAs you prove your worth to a studio and all of its own clients, it becomes more valuable to pay you the higher rate you\u2019re asking than to gamble having to bring in and build rapport with a new studio musician.\n\nData from the \u200bU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u200b states the following earnings for session musicians:\n\nMedian Annual Salary: $58,552 ($28.15/hour)\n\n$58,552 ($28.15/hour) Top 10% Annual Salary: $152,547 ($73.34/hour)\n\n$152,547 ($73.34/hour) Bottom 10% Annual Salary: $21,632 ($10.40/hour)\n\nWhen it comes to similar professions, here\u2019s a salary comparison chart:\n\nMusic director or composer: $49,630\n\n$49,630 High school (music) teacher: $60,320\n\n$60,320 Middle school (music) teacher: $58,600\n\nThere is one thing to keep in mind if you opt-in to work as a session musician: \u200bThis job usually requires some additional expenses like purchasing instruments and maintaining them, recording equipment, licenses, and travel expenses.\n\nSession Musician Credits & Royalties\n\nDespite the fact that session musicians work behind the scenes, they are very well-known and appreciated within the music industry. Furthermore, some of them managed to be publicly recognized like \u200bThe Wrecking Crew\u200b (there\u2019s also a \u200bdocumentary movie\u200b about them), \u200bThe Funk Brothers\u200b or the infamous \u200bToto\u200b.\n\nPopularity will get you more gigs, but not necessarily income from credits and royalties.\n\nIn most cases, session musicians are paid through a \u200bWork For Hire Agreement\u200b \u200bwhich means that they provide a service and that they don\u2019t have the rights to claim the copyright of the song. Major record labels\u200b, however, usually provides 1-2% royalty for a session musician who worked on a full album, sometimes even on a single track.\n\nWhen it comes to live performances, a session musician co-owns the copyright of the recording.\n\n\u201cCo-ownership of copyright means that you have the right of consent regarding how the recording is used, whether it be for radio play, use in commercials, film or any other medium. You are also entitled to any royalties generated from the use of the recording. You will not be entitled to anything, if you have agreed to a flat session fee and signed a session musician\u2019s release.\u201d -\u200b explains \u200bMusic Industry Inside Out\u200b.\n\nIs Being a Session Musician Right For You?\n\nIf you decide to take your chances in this career path, without any doubts \u2013 you need to work hard.

He has long hair!\"[1] After joining the band, Meagher proved to be important to the band's image, as he was one of the first American rock musicians with Beatlesque hair.[2] In addition to providing backing vocals, Meagher sang lead on occasion, as on \"They'll Make You Cry,\" a song from the band's 1965 debut album, Introducing the Beau Brummels.[2] Meagher appeared with the band in the 1965 science-fiction/comedy movie Village of the Giants, which was featured in a 1994 episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000.[3] He remained with the band as it reduced from a quintet to a trio by 1967's critically acclaimed album Triangle.[4]\n\nDuring the recording of the band's next album, 1968's Bradley's Barn, Meagher was drafted, becoming one of the few musicians from a well-known rock band to serve in the military at the height of the Vietnam War.[2] Over the next three decades, Meagher has also participated in several Beau Brummels revivals, most notably in the mid-1970s when the band released a 1975 self-titled reunion album.[5] After he was discharged two years later, Meagher played in the Black Velvet Band with former Beau Brummels bandmate Declan Mulligan.[2]\n\nDiscography\n\nMain article: The Beau Brummels discography\n\nReferences"}]}
