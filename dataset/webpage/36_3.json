Manilal, eminent botanist, describing the efforts the latter had taken to translate Hendrik van Rheede\u2019s Hortus Malabaricus (Garden of Malabar), a 17th century classic in Latin on the flora in the Western Ghats.\n\n\u201cThe efforts taken by Mr. Manilal then are unimaginable now. Learning Latin, an alien language, and translate that book into English. Later, translating it into Malayalam. Ordinary people cannot do such things,\u201d Mr. Raveendran said. He was speaking at an event organised by the Kozhikode Corporation and other organisations to honour Mr. Manilal, who was recently awarded the Padma Shri.\n\n\u201cIt is too late a recognition for him. He should have got this award long ago and he deserves even bigger awards,\u201d the Mayor said. Mr. Raveendran spoke about the mental trauma that Mr. Manilal had to endure when a publisher promised to bring out the translation, but did not give him the credit after doing it.\n\nHistorian M.G.S. Narayanan, who was also present, appreciated Mr. Manilal for his work in botany. Mr. Narayanan also recalled Mr. Manilal\u2019s term as the Head of the Department in the subject at Calicut University."}, {"url": "https://researchmatters.in/news/prof-k-s-manilal-among-padma-awardees-2020-under-science-and-engineering", "page_content": "Bengaluru\n\n26 Jan 2020\n\nAmong the illustrious list of Padma awardees for 2020 declared on the eve of Republic Day, the Government of India has announced Padma Shri to Prof Kattungal Subramaniam Manilal under Science and Engineering discipline. He is among the eight of 118 Padma Shri awardees under this discipline.\n\nPadma Awards are one of the highest civilian Awards in India. The Awards are given in various disciplines spanning the fields of art, social work, public affairs, science and engineering, trade and industry, medicine, literature and education, sports and civil service. \u2018Padma Vibhushan\u2019 is awarded for exceptional and distinguished service; \u2018Padma Bhushan\u2019 for distinguished service of a high order and \u2018Padma Shri\u2019 for distinguished service in any field. Among the 7 Padma Vibhushan, 16 Padma Bhushan and 118 Padma Shri Awards that the President of Indian approved this year, only 33 have been awarded to women.\n\nProf K. S. Manilal is a botanist and taxonomist, best known for his research, translation, and annotation of Hendrik van Rheede\u2019s 17th century Latin botanical treatise, Hortus Malabaricus. The document extensively details the biodiversity and medicinal properties of over 700 indigenous plants in the Malabar region of Kerala.\n\nBefore Manilal\u2019s translation of this enormous 12 volume document into English and Malayalam, most of the information in this Latin treatise had largely remained inaccessible to the world. Manilal also authored 198 published research papers and 15 books on taxonomy and botany, of which a significant proportion was devoted to discussing the medico-botanical aspects, or the historical, socio-political and linguistic significance of Hortus Malabaricus.\n\nAlong with his students, Manilal has discovered around 14 species of flowering plants and recorded the existence of nearly 1,000 flowering plant species, including some like the Malabar Daffodil, which was previously thought to be extinct. Currently, he is an Emeritus Professor of botany at Calicut University, Kerala. He is also credited for establishing the Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy.\n\nEarlier, Prof K S Manilal was featured under Ek Pradarshini - The Best of Indian Science exhibits during the Nobel Prize Series - India 2018 held at Goa. The National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) at Bengaluru had also held an exhibition of Hortus Malabaricus in 2008."}, {"url": "https://gulfnews.com/world/asia/india/india-fruit-seller-who-built-a-school-man-who-treats-elephants-among-padma-awardees-1.83565469", "page_content": "New Delhi: A man who cures elephants, a fruit seller who built a school, a former revenue officer who started libraries for tribal children, and a botanist who translated a 17th century Latin botanical treatise are among the lesser-known Padma Shri awardees for the 2020.\n\nPresident Ram Nath Kovind presented them the awards at the civil investiture ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhavan on Monday.\n\nKovind presents Padma Shri to Himmataram Bhambhu for Social Work, in New Delhi on Monday. Image Credit: ANI\n\nHimmatram Bhambhu from Rajasthan\u2019s Nagaur district has not just raised a forest with 11,000 trees on 25 bigha land in a village near Nagaur but has planted more than 500,000 trees in five years. His fights for saving the environment includes taking cudgels on behalf of the wild animals against hunters and poachers and being more vigilant than the Forest Department.\n\nNo wonder, the local environment hero, Bhambhu was recipient of what is now called the \u2018People\u2019s Padma\u201d. Bhambhu was one of the 60 people who received Padma Shri award for 2020 on Monday from the President.\n\nBut he is not the only lesser known person in the list.\n\nClad in a simple white cotton shirt and a dhoti, when Harekala Hajabba from Mangalore in Karnataka walked to receive the Padma Shri award at the august assembly in Rashtrapati Bhavan, the audience erupted in little louder claps for him than others.\n\nAfter all, not every day you meet a humble fruit seller with meagre earnings who has spent his life savings to build a school for the children of his village that did not have one.\n\nHis \u2018Gaon Chhodab Nahi\u2019 song from the last decade made him famous in the development sector but for the 1948-born folk-singer Madhu Mansuri Hasmukh from Jharkhand, keeping the flame alive for traditional songs from his region, earned him the prestigious award.\n\nAnother Padma Shri awardee Professor K.S. Manilal is a name to reckon with in the field of botany but not for the masses. The award recognises his tremendous work as a botanist and taxonomist, for his research, translation and annotation of Hendrik van Rheede\u2019s 17th century Latin botanical treatise documenting extensive details of Kerala\u2019s 700 indigenous plants and discovery of 14 species along with his students.\n\nFormer revenue officer turned educationist, Kerala-born Sathyanarayanan Mundayoor started 13 libraries and the Home Library Movement in remotest villages in Arunachal Pradesh. The septuagenarian spent more than three decades in creating awareness and interest for reading in children of tribal areas there.\n\nAnd then there is the terracotta artist V.K. Munusamy from Villianur village, near Puducherry, who is known not just for making miniatures as small as 1.5 inches and dramatic life-size terracotta statues but also training scores of others to earn livelihood.\n\nSimilar is the case of fish farmer Bata Krishna Sahoo, who received Padma Shri for animal husbandry. He has, from his own pockets, trained several college students and farmers in spawn production (eggs of aquatic animals) by traditional breeding methods."}, {"url": "https://vsktelangana.org/prof-k-s-manilal-indias-hitherto-unrecognised-botanist-bestowed-with-padma-shri", "page_content": "Prof Manilal was honoured with Netherland\u2019s highest civilian order, the Order of Orange-Nassau, in 2012, for his outstanding contributions to Botany and Taxonomy\n\n\u201cSometimes I do feel recognition has come from outside but not our own people,\u201d renowned botanist and taxonomist Prof KS Manilal had told a reporter six years ago. Finally, his motherland has recognised his academic contributions. This year, on the eve of the Republic Day, India\u2019s hitherto unrecognised botanist has been bestowed with Padma Shri.\n\nProf Manilal is a well-known botanist and taxonomist outside India. He is best known for his research, translation and annotation of \u2018Hortus Malabaricus\u2019, the 17th century Latin botanical treatise on medicinal properties of over 700 indigenous plants in Kerala.\n\nProf Manilal translated the 12-volume book into Malayalam and English. Until his translations came to light, the content of this Latin treatise had remained inaccessible to the world. Manilal also authored 198 published research papers and 15 books on taxonomy and botany.\n\nProfessor Kattungal Subramaniam Manilal was born in Kochi, as one of three children born to Advocate Kattungal A Subramaniam and K. K. Devaki on September 17, 1938.\n\nAccording to a brief biographical note, Manilal\u2019s interest in Hortus Malabaricus developed in his childhood as he was inspired by his father, whose avid reading habits and enthusiasm for sociology exposed Manilal to a collection of books, and more specifically newspaper cuttings on Hortus Malabaricus during the late 1940s and 1950s.\n\nIn 2018, Prof Manilal told The Hindu that it was a bunch of Latin words from \u2018Hortus Malabaricus\u2019 that changed the course of his life\u2019s work: \u201cThe plant\u2019s part if applied on the left toe improves the clarity of vision in the right eye.\u201d Due to his curiosity to know more about the content of the Latin treatise, he embarked on the new project, devoting almost 40 years of his academic career. \u201cOf course, they knew the plant\u2019s medicinal properties. But what struck me was the link between the left toe and the right eye,\u201d he says.\n\nManilal was not just translating the magnum opus of Hendrik van Rheede but as a botanist, he explored the geography mentioned in the book, rediscovering and verifying the 740-odd species mentioned in it. \u201cThe location where some plants were found was mentioned. So that helped. In other instances, the plants had migrated. In the sense, they were not found at the location mentioned in the volume but in nearby areas. I could find all except one, a plant called \u2018chentani,\u2019\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nProf. Manilal, along with with his students, has discovered around 14 species of flowering plants, and recorded the existence of nearly 1,000 flowering plant species, which were thought to be extinct. Currently he is an Emeritus Professor of Botany at the Calicut University, Kerala.\n\nProf Manilal has been now awarded Padma Shri under Science and Engineering category. As the botanist who made significant contributions to his discipline, Prof Manilal was not recognised by his motherland until now. Remember, the land of Hendrik van Rheede recognised the academic contributions of Prof. Manilal eight years ago!

The Padma awards (Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan) are three of the highest civilian awards in India, after Bharat Ratna, which recognises some major contributions to various fields like science, social work, literature, sports, medicine, and art.\n\nFrom ensuring that all the nominees are deserving, to being able to attend the award ceremony in-person, the Narendra Modi govt has drastically changed the way Indian citizens interact with the prestigious Padma Awards. What does celebrity Karan Johar share in common with hoi polloi Tulasi Gowda and Sharif Chacha? Now, a Padma Shri Award. The number of awardees with a modest background was so significant that it is safe to say that the Padma Awards 2021 was an astonishingly non-elitist ceremony.\n\nFelicitating the Grassroot Heroes\n\nTulsi Gowda from Karnataka was honoured with the Padma Shri award for social work. She is known for being a barefooted environmentalist who has planted close to 30,000 saplings and has also been actively involved in several environmental conservation activities since the last six decades. Right from an early age, she was passionate about planting and nurturing plants and trees.\n\nHarekala Hajabba, a senior citizen orange vendor who hails from Karnataka's Mangalore district was the recipient of the Padma Shri for his contribution to rural education. He built a fully-functioning school in the Harekala-Newpadpu village of Mangalore. The institution educates 175 underprivileged and poor students from the village. He himself has never been to school and is illiterate. The ambition to revolutionise primary education in his village dawned upon him in the year 1978 when a tourist asked him the cost of oranges and he was unable to comprehend the language and therefore, could not reply.\n\nAir marshal Dr. Padma Bandopadhyay was awarded the Padma Shri too. She held the title of being the first female officer deployed in the Indian air force (IAF) to receive a promotion and be elevated to the rank of an air marshal, which is a three-star rank.\n\nFolk artist Manjamma Jogati, who also happens to be transgender, received a Padma Shri in recognition of her contribution to the art form. For Manjamma, who has now entered her 60s, the honour comes after years of financial and societal struggle. Amid social exclusion, poverty and even being a victim of rape, Jogati found refuge in art forms- Janapada songs and, Jogati Nritya, the former being Kannada language sonnets praising numerous female deities. Jogati is the first transgender member of the highly acclaimed Karnataka Janapada Academy.\n\nMohammed Sharif a.k.a Sharif Chacha who hails from Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh was awarded the Padma Shri. The 83 year old who formerly worked as bicycle mechanic has been performing the last rites of close to 25,000 unclaimed bodies across all religions in his hometown for over 30 years.\n\nBhuri Bai, another Padma Shri awardee from Jhabua, Madhya Pradesh holds the title of being the first woman in the Bhil community of the district to paint on canvas and paper. Initially, she was employed in the labour force as a construction worker who earned Rs 6 per day. It was here that she got the chance to meet her mentor Jagdish Swaminathan, who encouraged her to paint after spotting her talent in the field. She has made some noteworthy contributions preserving and teaching the style of traditional Bhil paintings.\n\nProfessor Ram Yatna Shukla was conferred with the Padma Shri in the field of literature and education. He is the president of Kashi Vidvat Parishad and is widely called \u201cAbhinav Panini\u201d in an attempt to acknowledge his works to come up with new methods to teach as well as modernise Vedanta and Sanskrit grammar.\n\nRajasthan\u2019s Himmatram Bhambhu, another Padma Shri awardee, has not just nurtured a forest from scratch by planting approximately 11,000 trees on a 25 bigha land situated near his village in Nagaur, but has also given life to more than 5 lakh trees in the past five years. Being a resident of a state where malpractices like poaching, illegal smuggling of blackbucks, chinkaras, peacocks, and other animals is massively rampant, Himmataram has served as an important tool in the attempts to eliminate such issues in the district.\n\nProfessor K S Manilal was also awarded the Padma Shri in exchange for his contributions as taxonomist and botanist. His works include the translation, annotation and research of Hendrik van Rheede's Latin botanical treatise of the 17th century which documents profound details with respect to the discovery of 14 new species and 700 indigenous plants in Kerala.\n\nThe government conferred the Padma Shri upon Krishnammal Jagannathan, who works as a social worker and travels to various remote rural areas in India bringing a positive change in the form of social, economic as well as political transformation by promoting the Gandhian ideal of ahimsa or non-violence. She has worked tirelessly for the betterment of the poverty stricken and landless labourers. As a young girl, she has also shared the stage alongside Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nAndhra Pradesh\u2019s Dalavayi Chalapathi Rao, a renowned artist of leather puppetry, which is a rare shadow puppetry craft in Anantapur (Andhra Pradesh) was honoured with the Padma Shri.\n\nM K Kunjol was a recipient of the Padma Shri for his using his rights as an activist and advocating justice for Dalits, his efforts to voice his displeasure over police atrocities that were taking place against Dalits and other lower caste members. He has played an instrumental role in promoting the writings of Ayyankali and BR Ambedkar among the masses.\n\nPadma Shri awardee Rahibai Soma Popere, a tribal farmer who belongs to Mahadeo Koli, a small tribal community in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra is popularly known as the \u2018seed mother\u2019 for her endeavour in favour of organic or native seeds. Her crusade against the usage of pesticides and fertilisers along with hybrid seeds which was a primary cause of illnesses among several children in her locality was able to bring about some meaningful changes in the lives of many.\n\nDr Kushal Konwar Sarma, also known as the \u2018elephant man of India\u2019 and the \u2018elephant surgeon\u2019, is a professor of surgery and radiology and veterinarian in Assam. He has generously treated and cured over 600 elephants in the state and has also saved as many as 140 rogue bull elephants.\n\nA New Step Forward?\n\nAn award system that previously signified elitism and feudalism and was deemed highly inaccessible for the masses has now taken a new shape and this positive change initiated by the current government is worth appreciating. The Padma Awards 2021 also highlighted the vast diversity of India, cutting across all the cultures and identities, which forms the very foundation of this nation. We wish to see more such awardees coming from modest backgrounds being recognised for their grassroot level work in the coming years.\n\n0 comments\n\nLeave a comment"}, {"url": "https://www.gkgigs.com/padma-shri-award-recipients/", "page_content": "Last Updated: 28 March 2023\n\nThe Padma Shri Award is the fourth-highest Civilian Award of the Republic of India.\n\nPadma Shri Award was instituted on 2nd January 1954 and awarded to Citizens of India and Foreigners in recognition of their \u201cDistinguished Contribution in Various Spheres of Activity\u201d, without distinction of Race, Occupation, Position, or Sex.\n\nSome of the activities for which the Padma Shri Award is awarded are Arts, Civil Service, Education, Literature, Medicine, Public Affairs, Science, Engineering, Social Work, Sports, &Industry, etc\n\nThe Award is preceded by the Bharat Ratna Award, the Padma Vibhushan Award, and the Padma Bhushan Award.\n\nPadma Shri Award was given to 17 Recipients when it was first instituted in 1954.

After the freedom struggle, he became a part of the Bhoodan movement of Acharya Vinoba Bhave and Jayhaprakash Narayan.

Fondly called Ramettan, the 75-year-old has been instrumental in saving 35 species of rice varieties.\n\nTo the many who approach him to buy rice, he poses one condition: that they should cultivate the rich and return with the seeds.
