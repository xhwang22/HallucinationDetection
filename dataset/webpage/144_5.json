In 1883 he became manager of the Baltimore Orioles of the American Association. He appeared as a backup catcher that season, and also played two games in 1886, but otherwise did not take the field After leaving the Orioles following the 1891 season, he managed the Washington Senators (1892), Louisville Colonels (1893-1894) and Brooklyn Bridegrooms (1897-1898). His career managerial record consists of 632 wins and 810 losses. His best finish was third place with the 1887 Orioles.

Hence, personality psychologists now refer to \"subclinical\" manifestations of things like psychopathy and narcissism as less extreme versions of what are usually considered personality disorders. The \"subclinical\" part means that these traits can appear in people who are otherwise well adjusted in their daily lives.\n\nA recently published study examined how the colorful or histrionic personality fits with the traits from the Big Five model. The colorful personality combines socially desirable and undesirable traits and seems to have a family resemblance to members of the infamous \"Dark Triad\" of personality, particularly narcissism, although with distinctive features. From an evolutionary perspective, the colorful personality seems to involve a fast life history strategy, in which a person aims to extract social resources from others while giving as little as possible in return. People with colorful personalities might be able to do this because they are charismatic and charming and therefore might beguile people into overlooking their other character flaws.\n\nSource: The Peacock Masquerade by Nocturnal-Rapture\n\nPersonality disorders are long-standing, deeply ingrained patterns of behaving and relating. The traditional diagnostic view sees them as discrete categories that people either do or do not fit into. However, there is evidence that personality disorders involve extreme manifestations of traits found in most people. For example, each personality disorder can be described in terms of how its profile fits into the well-known Big Five model of personality with its five broad factors\u2014extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to experience. Each of these factors can be further broken down into a number of more specific traits. One common approach assigns each of the five factors six facets, so that the total model has 30 facets. Hence, personality disorders can be understood in regard to their typical facet profile (Bagby, Costa, Widiger, Ryder, & Marshall, 2005).\n\nAlthough personality disorders as such are maladaptive, many people who are reasonably well-adjusted have traits that resemble less extreme forms of these syndromes. For example, subclinical narcissism may be viewed as a less extreme form of narcissistic personality disorder. These subclinical syndromes have been called \"dark side\" traits because they may become problematic at times, particularly when a person is under pressure or stress (Furnham, 2014).\n\nA very interesting paper recently looked at the Big Five profile of the subclinical form of histrionic personality disorder, also known as the colorful personality (Furnham, 2014). People with this personality profile have a very strong motivation to seek approval, are good at calling attention to themselves, have a flair for the dramatic, dress to impress, and are often the life of the party. Among their strengths, they are fun, entertaining, flirtatious, and make an impression. Among their weaknesses, they are disorganized, do not listen to feedback, overcommit themselves, and are very self-aggrandizing.\n\nFurnham\u2019s study assessed more than 5,000 people in Britain, mostly in middle-class occupations, such as management. The study found that the colorful personality profile was associated with higher levels of extraversion and openness to experience, and with lower levels of neuroticism and agreeableness. The study also looked at the 30 facets of the Big Five to produce a more detailed profile, finding that the colorful personality was associated with a distinctive blend of socially desirable and undesirable traits.\n\nIn summary, people with the colorful personality tended to be:\n\nHigh in all facets of extraversion : They were typically gregarious, assertive, enthusiastic, and excitable.\n\n: They were typically gregarious, assertive, enthusiastic, and excitable. High in most facets of openness to experience , and so were generally imaginative, emotionally expressive, artistic, inquisitive, and willing to try new things.\n\n, and so were generally imaginative, emotionally expressive, artistic, inquisitive, and willing to try new things.

Mixed in tendencies regarding agreeableness : They were very low in straightforwardness, modesty and compliance, suggesting that they are manipulative, arrogant and boastful, and have little respect for following rules. On the other hand, they can also be somewhat trusting, helpful, and kind-hearted, perhaps when it suits them.\n\n: They were very low in straightforwardness, modesty and compliance, suggesting that they are manipulative, arrogant and boastful, and have little respect for following rules. On the other hand, they can also be somewhat trusting, helpful, and kind-hearted, perhaps when it suits them. Finally, in regards to conscientiousness, they tend to be ambitious and sure of their abilities, but also to be disorderly and undisciplined: They do not plan ahead, and tend to be lax about keeping their obligations.\n\nSource: PHOTOCREO Michal Bednarek/Shutterstock\n\nThe overall impression one gets of people who fit this profile is that they seem like rather selfish individuals who put on a good show, but are more concerned with satisfying their own ambitions than they are with making a substantive contribution to society. They may be entertaining and fun to be around, but do not necessarily care about doing high-quality work or meeting social obligations when it does not suit them.\n\nThe colorful personality seems to have a great deal in common with socially exploitative trait profiles known as \"dark personalities\" (Paulhus, 2014). The most well-known taxonomy of these profiles is the \"Dark Triad\"\u2014psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and narcissism. (More recently, sadism has been added to this list to create a \"Dark Tetrad.\") The colorful personality seems to share a great deal in common with narcissism in that both are driven by a desire to be regarded as special and manifest a strong degree of psychological entitlement\u2014that is, the belief that one is deserving of special treatment. However, compared to the narcissistic personality, the colorful personality tends to be more gregarious, warm, and tender-minded, if also more disorganized (Furnham & Crump, 2014), suggesting a somewhat distinctive profile.\n\nThe various dark personalities are distinct from each other, but have considerable overlap, and there are a number of theories about what constitutes their common core. One is that a common feature of all members of the Dark Triad is a low level of the characteristic known as honesty-humility, which manifests as the willingness to exploit other people for selfish gain (Paulhus, 2014). Honesty-humility is a feature of the six-factor HEXACO model of personality, one of the main alternatives to the Big Five model. However, in the 30-facet model, honesty and humility are basically identical to the agreeableness facets of, respectively, straightforwardness and modesty.[1] As noted, people with the colorful personality are strikingly low in these facets, just like people with Dark Triad traits.\n\nAnother theory proposes that while low honesty-humility is a common factor of the Dark Triad, its core consists of a callous disregard for the needs of others (Jones & Figueredo, 2013). I do not think it is clear that the colorful personality is quite this callous, though, since the profile is also positively associated with the tender-mindedness facet of agreeableness. That is, even though they tend to be self-centered, they might not be quite as malicious as other Dark Triad types.\n\nDepending on one\u2019s perspective, the colorful personality may or may not belong with the Dark Triad, but it does seem to have a family resemblance.\n\nAnother perspective that may be helpful for understanding the colorful personality is life history theory. According to this approach, people may vary in regard to whether they have more of a fast or a slow life history strategy.\n\nThe slow strategy is mutualistic: It emphasizes cooperation with other people for mutual benefit.\n\nstrategy is mutualistic: It emphasizes cooperation with other people for mutual benefit. The fast strategy is antagonistic: It emphasizes using other people to extract resources while attempting to minimize the cost to the self. (In other words, try to get as much as possible while giving as little as possible in return.)\n\nAntagonistic strategies are risky, so a challenge for fast strategists is how to extract resources from others without incurring punishment. People with a warrior-hawk approach use intimidation and aggression to get their way (Book, Visser, & Volk, 2015). This strategy is associated with psychopathy\u2014and extremely risky. Less aggressive strategies involving good social skills, such as the ability to persuade others to give in to one\u2019s demands, might be more socially acceptable and involve less risk. Selfish individuals may be more likely to succeed at manipulating others if they are charming and entertaining. By presenting an attractive fa\u00e7ade, they may become popular and influential. This may compensate for their lack of more substantial contributions, their unreliability, and their failure to meet social obligations.\n\nIn a previous post, I noted that fast and slow strategies each seem to be associated with a mixture of attractive and undesirable traits. People who match the slow pattern tend to be reliable and honest, yet shy, socially awkward and self-effacing. Those who match the fast strategy tend to be more socially skilled and charming, yet selfish and deceitful. The colorful personality seems to match this latter pattern: Their life strategy might be to get their way through theatricality and charm. Other people might find them so entertaining that they are willing to overlook their repeated failures to measure up to a reasonable standard of social responsibility. Delroy Paulhus (2014) has suggested that each of the dark personalities may thrive in a specific niche where their traits prove useful. This may also apply to the colorful personality, as it has been suggested that they make good sales people, but terrible managers (Furnham, 2014).\n\n[1] Proponents of the HEXACO argue that straightforwardness and modesty are not properly facets of agreeableness and therefore should be considered a separate factor. However, this is a technical debate that would lead off topic so I will not get into it at this time.\n\nOther Posts about Dark Personalities\n\nReferences\n\nBagby, R. M., Costa, P. T., Widiger, T.

Literally. He played for the Hartford Dark Blues (1874), Keokuk Westerns (1875) and New York Mutuals (1875) of the National Assn. and the Baltimore Orioles (1883, 1886) of the American Assn. He also managed the Orioles (1883-91), Washington Senators (1892), Louisville Colonels (1893-4) and Brooklyn Bridegrooms (1897-8).\n\nA New York native, Barnie started playing on local teams in 1870 before turning pro. He joined Hartford in 1874 and, as a rookie, led the league\u2026 in strikeouts (with 13). He also had a .184/.188./.226 slash line. The following season, he played in 10 games for the Keokuk (Iowa) Westerns, hitting .111. The Westerns folded after going 1-12 in their first 13 games, and Barnie signed on with the Mutuals as a backup to catcher/manager Nat Hicks. He had 5 hits in 34 at-bats for New York, bringing his 1875 batting average up to .129. Barnie would go on to insert himself into a few games when he was managing the Orioles and even had a .200 average in 17 games in 1883. All total, he hit .171 in 83 career games, with 55 hits, 23 RBIs and 32 runs scored.\n\nBarnie finished his full-time playing career in independent leagues. While nursing a hand injury in 1877 while playing for Buffalo of the League Alliance in 1877, the 24-year-old was given his first change to manage a ballclub. He\u2019d play a few seasons more, including the San Francisco Knickerbockers of the Pacific League, but his future in baseball would lie in managing.\n\nBarnie was a part of The Baseball Convention of 1881, which gave rise to the American Association as a competitor to the National League. Earlier that year, he\u2019d helped organize the Eastern Championship Association and ran the Brooklyn Atlantics team, so he was already familiar with getting a new league off the ground. He wanted a team of his own, but his financial backing was lacking. He and his partner A.J. Houck did get the Baltimore franchise in late 1882, and Barnie would spend the next 9 years as its manager.\n\nThe Orioles didn\u2019t see that much success under Barnie\u2019s tenure as part owner and manager, finishing as high as third just once. The Baltimore Sun said, \u201c\u2026his kind-hearted and easy-going ways causing players to impose on him and preventing him from making changes at times that would have been of benefit.\u201d He was succeeded by Ned Hanlon who, in his quietly ruthless way, made the changes that needed to be made for the good of the team. The Orioles would go on to win the AA championship three times under Hanlon.\n\nBarnie agreed to helm the NL\u2019s Senators in 1892. That arrangement lasted just 2 games. It seems like there was a power struggle between Barnie and the new owner. The Boston Globe reported on January 7 that Washington\u2019s shareholders put Barnie in charge of the club. Ten days later, though, it was reported that George Wagner had acquired 26 of the 29 shares, giving him absolute power. The Senators started the season with two losses, and Barnie, though he said he was given the change to manage for the whole season, was let go. No reason was given for his termination, he said.\n\nBarnie spent the rest of his life bouncing between managerial assignments in the National League and independent leagues. His time in Louisville ended when the 1895 Colonels won just 35 games while losing 95. His final run in the National League with the Bridegrooms lasted until 1898, when he was fired by Brooklyn as one of Charles Ebbets\u2019 first moves as the new owner. In 14 years as a pro manager, he went 470-548 for a .462 win %. He was credited with mentoring stars like King Kelly, Matt Kilroy and Mike Griffin. Ironically, Griffin would eventually be Barnie\u2019s replacement as the Brooklyn manager, following Ebbets\u2019 short-lived attempt at managing his own team.\n\nBarnie kept managing in the Eastern League, first in Springfield and then, until his death, in Hartford. Though he was said to be the \u201cpicture of health\u201d when he went to attend an Elks meeting in Atlantic City in early July 1900, he took ill. He returned to Hartford and died there on July 15 of pneumonia. He was 47 years old. Barnie is buried in the Paterson Family plot in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\nOddly, it was the second time that an Elks meeting in Atlantic City proved to be disastrous to his health. Barnie, along with several others, was injured in a stage collapse at an Elks meeting in 1896. He had been entertaining the crowd by singing when the accident occurred. His obituary stated that he never fully recovered from his unspecified injuries.\n\nAdvertisement"}, {"url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/SnuffySmith", "page_content": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/SnuffySmith\n\nSnuffy Smith is a long-running American daily comic strip about a hillbilly community.\n\nCreated by Billy DeBeck as Take Barney Google, F'rinstance (subsequently shortened to Barney Google) and launched in 1919, the strip originally starred the eponymous character, a diminutive sportsman involved primarily in prize-fighting and horseracing, much to the chagrin of his larger, more imposing wife Lizzie Google (or \"the sweet woman\"). While initially only moderately successful, it reached mainstream popularity early in The Roaring '20s with the introduction of Barney's broken-down horse Spark Plug, further fuelling a gradually-mounting cultural interest in continuity-laden comics such as Toots and Casper and Tillie the Toiler and making \"Sparky\" a popular nickname for boys (including future cartoonist Charles Schulz), while a song about Barney and his \"goo-goo-googly eyes\" became a smash hit in 1923. Lizzie Google vanished from the strip shortly afterwards, cementing the now-single Barney's racing ventures (and navigation of 1920s urban society) as its central premise. While the strip would attain immense mainstream popularity through this shift, DeBeck nonetheless opted to modify the strip's premise further in 1927 by recasting Barney and Spark Plug as intercontinental travellers as opposed to solely denizens of the racing circuit.\n\nIn response to a gradual decline in readership during the early 1930s, however, DeBeck, aided by his newfound assistant Fred Laswell, introduced the volatile hillbilly Snuffy Smith and his extended family to the strip within a 1934 storyline in which Barney travels to the rural town of \"Hootin' Holler\" to claim inherited property. While Snuffy's introduction successfully revitalized readership, Hootin' Holler became the strip's permanent setting and Barney gradually moved Out of Focus and was eventually written out of the strip entirely (save for rare cameo appearances) in favor of the by then more popular Snuffy around 1954. The official name of the strip remains Barney Google and Snuffy Smith, even though the former character hasn't been a regular for 60 years.\n\nThe Smith clan is:\n\nSnuffy, the patriarch. A thieving moonshiner.\n\nLoweezy, the matriarch. Is the actual caretaker.\n\nJughaid, the nephew. Usually seen in a coonskin cap.\n\nTater, the baby.\n\nThe strip has the distinction of being the oldest currently-running daily comic in newspaper print in the U.S., as The Katzenjammer Kids (first launched in 1897) ran only on Sundays by the point of its cancellation in 2006, while the still-running Gasoline Alley (begun in 1918) ran originally as a Sunday-only panel.\n\nTropes featured include:"}, {"url": "https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/barnibi01.shtml", "page_content": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhen was Billy Barnie born?\n\nBilly Barnie was born on January 26, 1853.\n\nWhere was Billy Barnie born?\n\nBilly Barnie was born in New York, NY.\n\nHow tall was Billy Barnie?\n\nBilly Barnie was 5-7 (170 cm) tall.\n\nHow much did Billy Barnie weigh when playing?\n\nBilly Barnie weighed 157 lbs (71 kg) when playing.\n\nHow many seasons did Billy Barnie play?\n\nBilly Barnie played 4 seasons.\n\nIs Billy Barnie in the Hall of Fame?\n\nBilly Barnie has not been elected into the Hall of Fame.\n\nWhat position did Billy Barnie play?\n\nBilly Barnie was a Catcher and Rightfielder.\n\nHow many hits did Billy Barnie have?\n\nBilly Barnie had 55 hits over his career.\n\nHow many home runs did Billy Barnie have?\n\nBilly Barnie had home runs over his career.\n\nWhat was Billy Barnie's average?\n\nBilly Barnie had a .171 average over his career.\n\nHow many teams has Billy Barnie played for?\n\nBilly Barnie played for 4 teams; the Hartford Dark Blues, New York Mutuals, Keokuk Westerns and Baltimore Orioles.\n\nWhen did Billy Barnie retire?\n\nBilly Barnie last played in 1886.\n\nWhat are Billy Barnie's nicknames?\n\nBald Billy is a nickname for Billy Barnie."}, {"url": "https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2565094/what-the-moneyball-cast-is-doing-now-including-brad-pitt", "page_content": "In September, we'll hit the ten-year anniversary of Moneyball, Bennett Miller's superb baseball drama starring and produced by Brad Pitt.

Moneyball was met with both acclaim and box office success, later receiving six Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nIt's hard to believe that it's been nearly a decade since Moneyball debuted in theaters, but it's a credit to its timeless quality that it holds up \u2014 quite well, in fact! But, what is the cast doing now, including Jonah Hill, Robin Wright, and Chris Pratt? A hell of a lot has changed since this Oscar-nominated sports movie hit theaters. Let's take a look!\n\nBrad Pitt (Billy Beane)\n\nAs Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics who adopts an unlikely strategy to form a competitive team, Brad Pitt plays our lead character in Moneyball. And, he received two Oscar nominations, for Best Picture and Best Actor. Previously, Pitt was nominated for his supporting role in 12 Monkeys and his titular turn in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Additionally, as a producer, he was nominated for The Big Short and 12 Years a Slave, the latter for which he won. Last year, Pitt won another Oscar for his supporting turn in Once Upon a Time ... In Hollywood. He also starred in Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Inglorious Basterds, Fight Club, Se7en, and the Ocean's movies.\n\nMost recently, Brad Pitt starred in and produced Ad Astra.

Their history is fast becoming one of the legends of the Old West. Horace Austin Warner Tabor was a school teacher in Vermont. With his first wife and two children he left Vermont by covered wagon in 1855 to homestead in Kansas. Perhaps he did not find farming to his liking, or perhaps he was lured by rumors of fortunes to be made in Colorado mines. At any rate, a few years later he moved west to the small Colorado mining camp known as California Gulch, which he later renamed Leadville when he became its leading citizen. \u201cGreat deposits of lead are sure to be found here.\u201d he said.\n\nAs it turned out, it was silver, not lead, that was to make Leadville\u2019s fortune and wealth. Tabor knew little about mining himself, so he opened a general store, which sold everything from boots to salt, flour, and tobacco.\u300eIt was his custom to \u201cgrubstake\u201d prospective miners, in other words, to supply them with food and supplies, or\u201cgrub\u201d, while they looked for ore, in return for which he would get a share in the mine if one was discovered.\u300f\u2460He did this for a number of years, but no one that he aided ever found anything of value.\n\nFinally one day in the year 1878, so the story goes, two miners came in and asked for \u201cgrub\u201d. Tabor had decided to quit supplying it because he had lost too much money that way. These were persistent, however, and Tabor was too busy to argue with them. \u201cOh help yourself. One more time won\u2019t make any difference,\u201d He said and went on selling shoes and hats to other customers. The two miners took $17 worth of supplies, in return for which they gave Tabor a one-third interest in their findings. They picked a barren place on the mountain side and began to dig. After nine days they struck a rich vein of silver. Tabor bought the shares of the other two men, and so the mine belonged to him alone. This mine, known as the \u201cPittsburgh Mine,\u201d made 1 300 000 for Tabor in return for his $17 investment.\n\nLater Tabor bought the Matchless Mine on another barren hillside just outside the town for $117 000. This turned out to be even more fabulous than the Pittsburgh, yielding $35 000 worth of silver per day at one time. Leadville grew. Tabor became its first mayor, and later became lieutenant governor of the state.\n\n\u25c61. Leadville got its name for the following reasons EXCEPT ______.\n\nA. because Tabor became its leading citizen\n\nB. because great deposits of lead is expected to be found there\n\nC. because it could bring good fortune to Tabor\n\nD. because it was renamed\n\n\u25c62.

Tabor made his first fortune ______.\n\nA. by supplying two prospective miners and getting in return a one-third interest in the findings\n\nB. because he was persuaded by the two miners to quit supplying\n\nC. by buying the shares of the other\n\nD. as a land speculator\n\n\u25c64. The underlying reason for Tabor\u2019s life career is ______.\n\nA. purely accidental\n\nB. based on the analysis of miner\u2019s being very poor and their possibility of discovering profitable mining site\n\nC. through the help from his second wife\n\nD. he planned well and accomplished targets step by step\n\n\u25c65.

Created by Texan teacher Sheryl Leach in 1987, Barney started out as a regionally successful home video series called Barney and the Backyard Gang before being picked up by the network for a regular series. The inspiration behind the show's creation was that there weren't many programs that educated young children at the time note Sesame Street was aimed at preschool and early school-age children at the time Leach made that criticism, as she found it too complex for younger children. Starring the title character as a friendly authority figure, a surrogate for the young girls in the form of Baby Bop, two other dinosaurs named B.J. and Riff (introduced 2006), and an ever-shifting cast of young kids, its setting was once a elementary school, but switched to a local park beginning with season 7. The story (such that it is) focuses largely on the importance of imagination and delivering Aesops suitable for very young children.\n\nThe show has had a mammoth amount of merchandise in dolls, clothing, blankets, CDs, and virtually everything else a kid can use. There has also been a 1998 theatrically released film called Barney's Great Adventure, as well as countless home videos, a prime-time special, and a series of stage shows toured worldwide.\n\nThe show is infamous for not exactly being very well-liked beyond its target audience and its Periphery Demographic, to the point that anti-Barney humor became a borderline fad in The '90s (and a modern-day tell-tale sign of an Unintentional Period Piece). As for parents, well, 30 minutes of free babysitting buys you a LOT of tolerance.\n\nIn 2015, Mattel announced that it will reboot the property with 9 Story Media Group. However, 9Story acquired the global distribution rights to most of the past seasons later on.\n\nIn an effort to boost ratings, Universal Kids started airing the show on December 17, 2018.\n\nIn 2019, a second theatrical film was announced, with Daniel Kaluuya producing.\n\nIn November 2021, a documentary chronicling Barney's history was announced. The documentary - I Love You, You Hate Me - premiered on Peacock on October 12, 2022.\n\nIn 2023, Mattel announced a makeover for the Barney franchise which includes a new CG-animated series known as Barney's World, which is co-produced by Corus Entertainment's Nelvana as well as other media such as YouTube content. It's currently slated to premiere on Cartoon Network's preschool block Cartoonito and stream on Max in the US.\n\nThese examples are Stu-u-u-pendous!:"}, {"url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones", "page_content": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones\n\n\n\nThey're the modern Stone Age family!\n\nFrom the... town of Bedrock,\n\nThey're a page right out of history!\n\nLet's ride... with the family down the street,\n\nThrough the... courtesy of Fred's two feet!\n\nWhen you're... with the Flintstones,\n\nHave a Yabba-Dabba-Doo time!\n\nA Dabba-Doo time!\n\nWe'll have a gay ol' time! \u2014 \"Meet the Flintstones\", the theme used for seasons 3-6 note The first two seasons used an instrumental theme .

Usually an animal was shown rigged to perform some menial task, e.g. a baby mammoth used as a vacuum cleaner, a parrot used as a recording device, etc. The animal then usually makes an Aside Comment about their lot in life.note Said comment is usually either a bad pun or some variation on the phrase \"It's a living!\"\n\nThe other half was your typical sitcom material, springing from the antics of boorish Fred Flintstone \u2014 based on Ralph Kramden in The Honeymooners \u2014 who was constantly hatching insane schemes with his diminutive neighbor Barney Rubble and subsequently getting them both into trouble with their wives, Wilma and Betty. Later in the series the Flintstones had a daughter, Pebbles; this inspired the Rubbles to adopt a son, the comically super-strong Bamm-Bamm. Dino and Hoppy were the respective family pets.\n\nThe original series, which aired for six seasons (1960\u201366) on ABC, was the most successful prime-time animated show ever until The Simpsons debuted in 1989. The latter broke the former's record with the Season 8 episode \"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\" and for syndicated reruns, the opening Couch Gag has the Simpsons finding the Flintstones already sitting in their living room. The Flintstones was also the first animated sitcom to be nominated for a Primetime Emmy, which opened the door for a lot of animated sitcoms (mostly Family Guy and The Simpsons) to have the same opportunity. The show was also the first to have an animated character (Wilma) be openly pregnant. Of course this was probably the result of something else that no other TV show since about 1948 had done: Wilma and Fred were shown sleeping in the same bed, together.\n\nLike many very popular shows from the 1960s and '70s, The Flintstones just would not die. The original series has continued in syndicated reruns for decades, and its characters have lived on in any number of subsequent forms, from Saturday morning cartoons featuring teenaged versions of Bamm-Bamm and Pebbles (the latter voiced by Sally Struthers) through a pair of live-action movies, all the way to a breakfast cereal which is still marketed in the early 21st century (and which is the occasion for continuous new Flintstones animation), plus the chewable vitamins. The year 2016 in particular saw a resurgence of the franchise in multiple media: first, a Chinese bootleg of the NES game The Flintstones: The Rescue Of Dino & Hoppy received Memetic Mutation on the Internet (especially the theme song) thanks to the works of Vinesauce and SiIvaGunner. That game actually received a sequel on the NES, The Flintstones: The Surprise At Dinosaur Peak! Unrelated to both, the series also got the same year a Darker and Edgier reboot as comic book published by DC Comics.\n\nIn 2021, it was announced that an Elizabeth Banks-produced Distant Sequel, Bedrock, had been picked up by Fox and would be jointly produced by Fox Entertainment and Warner Bros. Animation.\n\nHanna-Barbera has produced shows similar to this, such as The Jetsons (The Flintstones in the future), Where's Huddles? (The Flintstones with football players), Wait Till Your Father Gets Home (The Flintstones meets All in the Family), and The Roman Holidays (The Flintstones in the era of the Roman empire).\n\nThe Flintstones provides the name for the following tropes:\n\n\"Flintstones, meet the Flintstones, they're a modern Trope Age family\":\n\nopen/close all folders\n\nA to I\n\nJ to P\n\nR to Z\n\nFlintstones! Meet the Flintstones!\n\nThey're the modern Stone Age family!\n\nFrom the... town of Bedrock,\n\nThey're a page right out of history!\n\nSomeday... maybe Fred will win the fight,\n\nThen that... cat will stay out for the night!\n\nWhen you're... with the Flintstones,\n\nHave a Yabba-Dabba-Doo time!\n\nA Dabba-Doo time!\n\nWe'll have a gay ol' time!\n\n\n\nWe'll have a gay ol' time!!\n\nFred: \"WIIIIILLLLLMAAAAAAA!!!\""}]}
