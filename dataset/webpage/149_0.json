Every Tagged as Cheese\n\nFood & Drink Have we missed something?\n\nThey can be found in the supermarket, they are often a common appearance during the holidays, and if you\u2019re like many people, you may be wondering precisely what purpose they serve?! That\u2019s right, this is all about that mysterious, delicious party food called the Cheeseball!\n\nFor those who are considering just how many occasions really call for a bit of cheddar cheese rolled in roasted almond slices, the people who support National Cheeseball Day believe that the answer is ALL of them!\n\nAlso, don\u2019t forget that cheeseballs can also be those little, round, shockingly orange corn puffs that are covered with powdered cheese! Definitely a younger person\u2019s idea of what a cheese ball is, this is still a legitimate snack to appreciate.\n\nWhichever style is chosen or preferred, National Cheeseball Day celebrates these odd little culinary mainstays and encourages everyone to explore the history behind them and how they came to be what they are today.\n\nWho knows? National Cheeseball Day may even find a lot of unlikely people creating their own cheeseballs and adding them to their regular fare!\n\nHistory of National Cheeseball Day\n\nThe background of National Cheeseball Day starts at an unusual point in history\u2013when the first cheese ball appeared at, perhaps one of the most unexpected of places, the White House.\n\nIn the early 1800s, there was a farmer by the name of Elisha Brown, Jr. who was seeking to present an unusual gift to then President of the United States, Thomas Jefferson. So it was this desire that allowed an unbelievably massive ball of cheese to wind up on the White House lawn.\n\nHow massive? 1,235 pounds to be exact! Now that is a huge ball of cheese. It\u2019s a little wonder that it eventually became known as \u201cThe Mammoth Cheese\u201d.\n\nFrom that point, the cheese ball seemed to have disappeared into culinary history for nearly 150 years. It then had the good fortune to resurface in 1944 in a book by Virginia Safford called Food of My Friends. In this book, a recipe was included for the Cheese Ball, and it wasn\u2019t long after that it found itself a staple of cuisine.\n\nCan it truly be considered a cuisine, though? Well, that description does seem to require that there is more than one variation, doesn\u2019t it? And the experience of most people, is that they have probably only seen the variety that\u2019s rolled in toasted almonds. Believe it or not, though, there are hundreds of varieties of cheese balls available for every imaginable occasion!\n\nCheeseballs can be made of almost any kind of cheese, and then rolled in almost anything that can be imagined! Perhaps there isn\u2019t even an \u201calmost\u201d to be said here. Some people have made cheese balls rolled in crushed Oreos, sparkly confetti topping, diced onions, peppers and garlic.\n\nAnything that goes well with cheese (and perhaps a few things, like Oreos, that wouldn\u2019t normally be thought of as \u2018good with cheese\u2019?) can be repurposed into the coating for a cheese ball.\n\nGetting creative and exploring new tastes, while also offering a nod to the classics, is what Cheese Ball Day is all about!\n\nHow to Celebrate National Cheeseball Day\n\nCelebrating National Cheeseball Day means not only eating cheeseballs, but also enjoying other \u2018cheesy\u2019 things as well! Try out these ideas:\n\nEnjoy Eating a Cheese Ball\n\nThe best way to celebrate National Cheeseball Day is simply to indulge in the delicious treat that is the cheeseball. Get your favorite dipping implement, whether that\u2019s crackers, bread, or even bits of meat, and go to town with a cheese ball.\n\nOther delectable items that can be dipped into a cheeseball include:\n\nSlices of apple or pear\n\nPretzel sticks or pretzel twists\n\nToasted mini bagel chips\n\nPita triangles\n\nFresh vegetables (carrot sticks, celery sticks, cauliflower)\n\nGraham Crackers (for the sweeter cheese balls)\n\nMake a Cheese Ball at Home\n\nDo a little bit of research and create a unique, culinary cheeseball creation at home to share it with friends, family, neighbors or coworkers. Remember, little events like this are always popular at the office, and imagine how many types of cheese balls can be discovered then! (Or\u2026 maybe there will just be a lot of almond covered ones.)\n\nA traditional cheese ball appetizer includes ingredients such as cream cheese, cheddar cheese, brie, sour cream, garlic powder and other spices. Some people like to create a spicy version that uses hot pepper sauce. Other people like to include a splash of Worcester sauce. Add Thai Sweet Chili sauce and serve with wontons!\n\nThrow a Cheeseball Party\n\nFor those people who have a collection of friends who enjoy a \u2018fortified blog of cream cheese\u2019, the only option is to grab a friend and host a fun and exciting cheese ball party!\n\nOf course the main food that is served must be cheeseballs, but that doesn\u2019t\u2019 have to be boring. There can be cheeseballs made in the normal way, but other options include an Asian theme, Pepper Jack, Hawaiian theme (with pineapple, of course), Cranberry Pecan and even dessert cheeseballs made with Oreo cookies!\n\nAt this party, feel free to watch Alvin and the Chipmunks 2 film, which features an excellent scene where Alvin converts the song \u201cStayin\u2019 Alive\u201d into an entire montage about being a Cheese Ball Man!\n\nSince the theme of the party is everything cheese, have guests wear their \u2018cheesiest\u2019 clothes, and don\u2019t forget to play \u2018cheesy\u2019 music! In addition to Alvin\u2019s Cheese Ball song, try a variety of songs such as these:"}, {"url": "http://www.celebrateboston.com/sites/granary-burying-ground-elisha-brown.htm", "page_content": "Elisha Brown Grave\n\nIn 1769, Elisha Brown and his family performed one of the earliest American acts of defiance against the British Empire.

Hargus Taylor, 1979\n\n9 Jan. 1723\u20136 Mar. 1799\n\nElisha Battle, planter, revolutionary patriot, and state legislator, was born in Nansemond County, Va. He was the fifth child and third son of William and Sarah Hunter Battle. Earlier paternal and maternal ancestors had emigrated from Yorkshire, England, in the mid-seventeenth century, his grandfather, John Battle, settling on a two-hundred-acre estate on the west bank of Nansemond River in Nansemond County, Va. In 1663 this same John Battle obtained a royal patent for 640 acres of land on Pasquotank River in North Carolina. Here Elisha Battle's father, William, was born in 1682. In 1690, upon the death of his father, William returned to Nansemond County, where he continued to reside until his death in 1749.\n\nBy deed of record dated 17 Aug. 1747, Elisha Battle purchased four hundred acres on the north side of Tar River, in Edgecombe County, from Samuel Holliman. This purchase formed the nucleus of Cool Spring Plantation, near the present town limits of Rocky Mount, to which Battle moved with his family in late 1747 or early 1748. Subsequent purchases made Battle a large and prosperous landholder. He soon gained a reputation as a man of honest conviction, sound judgment, and considerable native ability.\n\nAccording to an early biographer, Battle was appointed justice of the peace in about 1756, retaining this position until the infirmities of old age forced him to relinquish it in 1795. By 1759 he was serving as a justice for Edgecombe county court (later the inferior court of pleas and quarter sessions). He was one of five commissioners appointed in 1760 to \"found and lay out\" the town of Tarboro.\n\nThe same early biographer indicates that Battle was elected to represent Edgecombe in the colonial House of Commons as early as 1771, though his first recorded appearance there is during the assembly that convened in New Bern, 4\u201321 Dec. 1773. With the threat of impending warfare, Battle was named chairman of Edgecombe's committee of safety (1774\u201375). He also represented his county in the provincial congresses that met in Halifax in April 1776 and in November 1776.\n\nWith the establishment of an independent state government, Elisha Battle was elected to represent Edgecombe County in the state senate, 1777\u201381, 1783, and 1785\u201387. He served as chairman of the committee of the whole during much of the session of the constitutional convention, convened in Hillsborough in July 1788. With the majority of the delegates, Battle held that it would be too dangerous to adopt the proposed federal constitution without amendments to reserve and secure certain rights to the individual states. Accordingly, he voted to postpone adoption until such amendments were effected.\n\nIn 1742, Battle married Elizabeth Sumner, a first cousin to Brigadier General Jethro Sumner, who served in the Continental Army under Washington. To their union were born eight children: Sarah, who married Jacob Hilliard and, afterward, Henry Horn; John, who married Frances Davis; Elizabeth, who married Josiah Crudup, Jr.; Elisha, who married Sarah Bunn; William, who married Charity Horn; Dempsey, who married Jane Andrews; Jacob, who married Penelope Edwards; and Jethro, who married Martha Lane.\n\nBattle united with the Falls of Tar River Baptist Church in 1764, attaining prominence in the affairs of his local congregation and the larger denomination. He served as a deacon and as a clerk at Falls of Tar River. He was also instrumental in the organization of the Kehukee Baptist Association in 1769, serving that body occasionally as moderator and as clerk. He was buried on the family plantation."}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Elisha-Warfield-Jr-M-D/4844238263470092903", "page_content": "About Elisha Warfield, Jr., M.D.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisha_Warfield\n\nElisha Warfield, Jr. (February 5, 1781 - May 15, 1859) was an American physician and a Thoroughbred racehorse owner and breeder whom Thoroughbred Heritage calls \"one of the most important early figures in Kentucky racing and breeding.\"\n\nEarly life and education\n\nBorn in Maryland, Elisha, Jr. moved with his family to Lexington, Kentucky when he was nine years old. He was tutored privately and obtained a degree in medicine from Transylvania University.\n\nOn January 15, 1805, he married Maria Barr, with whom he had ten children. Their daughter Mary Jane Warfield married Cassius Marcellus Clay, who became a prominent politician and abolitionist in Kentucky.\n\nWarfield became a very successful medical practitioner in Lexington. He was selected as the first Professor of Surgery and Obstetrics at the newly established medical school at Transylvania University.\n\nActive in community development, in 1830 Elisha Warfield was a founding shareholder of the Lexington & Ohio Railway Company. In 1834 it connected Lexington to the state capital of Frankfort, Kentucky.\n\nThoroughbred horses\n\nAround the time of his marriage, Elisha Warfield began racing and breeding Thoroughbred horses. In 1809 he was one of the founding members of the Lexington Jockey Club, consisting of owners of the racehorses and breeding farms.\n\nIn 1821 Warfield decided to devote his energies to breeding, training and racing Thoroughbreds full time. In 1826, he was one of the founders of the Kentucky Association, which built a horse racetrack on land adjacent to his stud farm.\n\nKnown as The Meadows, Warfield's stud farm was located on Winchester Pike on the Northeast side of Lexington. It was where he bred Lexington, a U.S. Racing Hall of Fame Thoroughbred stallion. Foaled at The Meadows on March 29, 1850, and originally named Darley, the colt was very successful on the racetrack, winning six of his seven starts. As a breeding stallion, he is considered one of the greatest in United States history. Between 1861 and 1878, Lexington was ranked as the leading sire in North America a record sixteen times, of which fourteen were consecutive years. As of 2008, Lexington's record remains intact.\n\nWarfield and his brother Benjamin, an attorney, were members of the group that founded Lexington Cemetery in 1849. Elisha Warfield was buried here following his 1859 death at his Lexington home.\n\nThe Meadows stud farm was eventually sold, with portions of the property parceled off. Prominent Kentucky horseman Daniel Swigert owned the stud for a time before selling it in August 1888. Increased population in the city put pressure on surrounding real estate. Developers acquired the property in 1945 and subdivided it for residential use as The Meadows."}]}
