Last weekend, two genuine highlights took centre stage as the 2014 season draws to a close: the FIM Superbike World Championship (WSBK) visited Magny-Cours (FR), while Silverstone (GB) hosted the penultimate round of the British Superbike Championship (BSB). Both events yielded victories for customer teams supported by BMW Motorrad Motorsport. Sylvain Barrier (FR) won the EVO class in the WSBK on his BMW S 1000 RR, and Ryuichi Kiyonari (JP) stepped onto the top step of the podium in the BSB.\n\nFIM Superbike World Championship in Magny-Cours.\n\nLast weekend featured the final European round of the 2014 FIM Superbike World Championship (WSBK) for the experts at BMW Motorrad Motorsport. The \u201cCircuit de Nevers Magny-Cours\u201d (FR) hosted the 11th of this season\u2019s 12 rounds. Sylvain Barrier (FR) of the BMW Motorrad Italia SBK team had been looking forward to his home event for a long time \u2013 and claimed another success. The conditions were far from easy though: Friday and Saturday were dry, but the rain arrived on Sunday. However, Barrier refused to allow the perilous conditions to knock him off his stride in the opening race. He won the EVO class (tenth overall) on his BMW S 1000 RR EVO. He led the EVO field again in race two, until he fell victim to the extremely slippery track, crashing out and damaging the handlebar on his bike. Barrier was forced to retire as a result.\n\nBMW Team Toth once again fielded two BMW S 1000 RRs in Magny-Cours. Imre Toth (HU) came home 20th and 13th. Gabor Rizmayer (HU) crashed out in the opening race, but bounced back to produce a strong ride on his EVO version of the bike in race two. He finished third in the EVO class and 12th overall. The season finale of the WSBK takes place in Doha, Qatar, on 2nd November.\n\nFIM Superstock 1000 Cup in Magny-Cours.\n\nThe FIM Superstock 1000 Cup (WSTK) held the finale of its 2014 season in Magny-Cours, where it shared the bill with the WSBK. The rain also resulted in miserable conditions and numerous retirements in the Superstock race. Federico Sandi (IT/Team Motoxracing) ploughed on regardless, however. He finished fifth on his BMW HP4 \u2013 his best result of the season. The second best-placed BMW Motorrad privateer was Federico d\u2019Annunzio (IT/FDA Racing Team) who came home tenth. Remo Castellarin (IT/Cast16 Corse) and Robert Muresan (RO/H-Moto Team) failed to finish.\n\nBritish Superbike Championship in Silverstone.\n\nWhen it comes to excitement, the penultimate round of the British Superbike Championship (BSB) in Silverstone (GB) will take some beating. Ryuichi Kiyonari (JP / Buildbase BMW Motorrad) and his rivals put on an unforgettable show as the race for the title neared its thrilling conclusion. In the first of the two races on Sunday, Kiyonari was embroiled in a thrilling three-way battle for the win with Shane Byrne (GB) and Josh Brookes (AU). The lead changed hands no fewer than six times on the last lap alone. The trio was separated by just 0.368 seconds as they crossed the line. Kiyonari finished a hair\u2019s breadth behind winner Byrne, crossing the line in second place, just 0.084 seconds after his biggest rival for the title.\n\n\u201cKing Kiyo\u201d took his revenge in race two. The Japanese BMW S 1000 RR rider took an early lead and had the upper hand in another breath-taking duel with Byrne. This time it was Kiyonari who crossed the finish line first \u2013 0.074 seconds ahead of his rival. The weekend\u2019s results have catapulted Kiyonari into the top 15 in the BMW Motorrad Race Trophy standings. He currently lies 11th (see below for standings).\n\nKiyonari\u2019s team-mate James Westmoreland (GB) claimed top-ten finishes in both races, coming home eighth and tenth. Patric Muff (CH / Batham\u2019s Prize Winning Ales) was 14th and 13th. One race was held in the BSB Superstock class. Hudson Kennaugh (ZA / Linxcel Moto Racing) finished third on his BMW S 1000 RR to claim a place on the podium.

Another title win for the BMW S 1000 RR: French rider Sylvain Barrier was crowned champion at the season finale of the 2012 FIM Superstock 1000 Cup at Magny-Cours (FRA). For his BMW Motorrad Italia GoldBet STK Team it was the second title win in three years competing in the series, after the triumphant season with Ayrton Badovini (ITA) back in 2010.\n\nIn the season\u2019s ten races, 23-year old Sylvain celebrated four victories, which was more than any other rider. In total, the Frenchman rode his RR to six podium finishes and claimed seven pole positions. Over the course of the year, he also showed his spirit to never give up. He fought his way back to the top after a setback halfway through the season when he suffered a severe shoulder injury that put him a long way back in his title campaign. At the penultimate round two weeks ago at Portim\u00e3o (POR), Sylvain retook the lead by finishing the race in second. He arrived with an advantage of three points to his closest rival at the season finale on home soil. At the last race of the year he secured the title by claiming another podium and finishing second. The first to congratulate him straight after the finish line was his mentor, double Superbike world champion James Toseland (GBR).\n\n\u201cI still cannot believe I won the title,\u201d Sylvain enthused. \u201cThe hard work done with the team throughout the season has paid off and I want to thank the guys, my family, James, the Clinica Mobile and everyone who supported me during the year. It was a tough race, but I was feeling very comfortable on the bike from the warm-up. I rode very carefully on the first two laps because the rear tyre was not warmed up properly and also Eddi La Marra and Bryan Staring had already crashed. I tried to maintain the gap I had with the following riders and at the same I concentrated on making the tyres work properly and did not push to the limit. It's been a fabulous week-end and I am over the moon!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe result achieved today in the FIM Superstock 1000 Cup is amazing,\u201d said Andrea Buzzoni, General Manager BMW Motorrad Italia. \u201cWe built on our success from 2010 and won the title again thanks to a very high-level team, a rider of unquestionable talent \u2013 who was able to grow and mature even more \u2013 and a bike that proved once more to be the best not only in the worldwide market but also on track.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re extremely happy about Sylvain\u2019s Superstock 1000 Cup title win, especially if we consider the fact that three rounds ago we were 31 points behind in the standings,\u201d commented Serafino Foti, BMW Motorrad Italia GoldBet Superbike Team Sporting Director. \u201cThe credit for this achievement goes to all the people who supported us, to our sponsors, to BMW and especially to the team that has done an incredible job. Sylvain brilliantly kept total concentration in both tough and important times and very well deserved the title.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0149565EN/bmw-motorrad-hp-racesupport-celebrates-2013-superstock-1000-title-for-bmw-hp4", "page_content": "The Munich specialists accompanied Sylvain Barrier on his way to his second win of the FIM Superstock 1000 Cup.\n\nMunich, 8th October 2013. When Sylvain Barrier (FRA) crowned himself champion at the penultimate round of the 2013 FIM Superstock 1000 Cup at Magny-Cours (FRA), the experts of BMW Motorrad HP RaceSupport celebrated with him and his BMW Motorrad GoldBet STK Team. The Munich specialists played an important part in this success which was Sylvain\u2019s second consecutive title and BMW Motorrad\u2019s third championship win in the series. The FIM Superstock 1000 Cup replaced the European Superstock Championship in 2005 and is held at European rounds of the FIM Superbike World Championship. The BMW Motorrad GoldBet STK Team entered the series in 2010 and was crowned champions in 2010, 2012 and 2013.\n\nWhile the first two titles were won with the BMW S 1000 RR, the team contested this season with the brand new BMW HP4. One of the special features of the bike is the electronic damping system DDC and the FIM Superstock 1000 Cup was the first international championship in which this innovative technology was successfully used. Thus, the BMW HP4 is the first ever bike equipped with an electronic damping system to win an international championship in the history of two wheel racing. One of the main tasks for BMW Motorrad HP RaceSupport this year was to adapt the newly developed BMW HP4 and DDC to the special requirements in racing \u2013 on the international stage and in numerous national series. The Munich specialists work very closely with the BMW Motorrad GoldBet STK Team and are on site at all races being a part of the squad.\n\nThe specialists and the team used the pre-season tests in winter to gain first impressions of what is required to make the BMW HP4 and the DDC a winning racing package. Back in Munich, the data were analysed and the preparation was continued. The work turned out to be impressively successful. Already at the season opener at Arag\u00f3n (ESP) in April, the BMW HP4 was the bike to beat, with Sylvain being fastest in all sessions and claiming the first ever international race win of the bike and the innovative DDC. Over the course over the season, BMW Motorrad HP RaceSupport continuously developed in close collaboration with R&D in Munich further adaptions and helped the team to prepare the bike for every single rounds. This close co-operation led to continued success. Sylvain has won five of the nine races contested so far, some of them in a dominant manner. At the penultimate round last weekend at Magny-Cours, a fourth place finish was enough for Sylvain to secure the early title win. He leads the Riders\u2019 classification with an advantage of 33 points meaning he can no longer be overtaken at the final round at Jerez (ESP).\n\n\u201cWe are more than happy and proud to celebrate the early title win with Sylvain and the BMW Motorrad GoldBet STK Team\u201d, commented Berthold Hauser, General Manager BMW Motorrad HP Race Support. \u201cThe 2013 FIM Superstock 1000 Cup was the first international championship in which the BMW HP4 was fielded and in which the newly developed DDC was used. This meant that before the season started, we had no references of how competitive our package is in comparison with our competitors. In addition, it is no easy task to adapt new bikes and technologies not only to the special requirements of racing in general, but also to the riding style of each rider and to the individual characteristics of each single race track. With no data available from the previous years, setting up the bike and the electronics is a new challenge at every round. But the very close co-operation of our specialists department, the racing team and the R&D department of BMW Motorrad Motorsport at Munich and the unwavering commitment of every single one involved in this project paved the way to success. Thanks to everybody who was part of this exciting experience which led to such a great result. The reward for this effort is winning the crown with one race to go \u2013 and we are delighted that we contributed our part to this success.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/sylvain-barrier/", "page_content": "Sylvain Barrier (born 20 October 1988 in Oyonnax) is a French motorcycle racer.

It\u2019s been a fabulous week-end and I am over the moon!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe result achieved today in the FIM Superstock 1000 Cup is amazing,\u201d said Andrea Buzzoni, General Manager BMW Motorrad Italia. \u201cWe built on our success from 2010 and won the title again thanks to a very high-level team, a rider of unquestionable talent \u2013 who was able to grow and mature even more \u2013 and a bike that proved once more to be the best not only in the worldwide market but also on track.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re extremely happy about Sylvain\u2019s Superstock 1000 Cup title win, especially if we consider the fact that three rounds ago we were 31 points behind in the standings,\u201d commented Serafino Foti, BMW Motorrad Italia GoldBet Superbike Team Sporting Director. \u201cThe credit for this achievement goes to all the people who supported us, to our sponsors, to BMW and especially to the team that has done an incredible job. Sylvain brilliantly kept total concentration in both tough and important times and very well deserved the title.\u201d"}, {"url": "http://bikeland.org/news-story.php?newsID=78459", "page_content": "Sylvain Barrier Joins Yamaha's Superstock 1000 Line-Up 2015-04-09 02:40\n\nYamaha is proud to announce that two-time Superstock 1000 Champion Sylvain Barrier has been added to Yamaha\u2019s competitive line-up for the FIM Superstock 1000 Cup, starting this weekend with the opening round at MotorLand Arag\u00f3n.\n\n\n\nBarrier will join Michele Magnoni as a full-time rider for the G.M Racing team and is sure to play a key role in further developing the all-new YZF-R1M as Yamaha hunts for glory in the STK1000 series.\n\n\n\nThough the Frenchman hasn\u2019t tested the YZF-R1M before, his high-level of experience in the Superbike and STK1000 class still makes him a force to be reckoned with.

After picking up three podiums across two seasons, the French rider moved up to the FIM Superstock 1000 Cup, where he truly began to hone his talents. Entering the series in 2008, Barrier finally managed to clinch the title in 2012, becoming a two-time winner the following year.\n\nSuccess in STK1000 earned him a move up to WorldSBK at the end of 2013. However, injuries at the start of the following year \u2013 first at the opening round in Australia, followed by a car accident back in France \u2013 meant that Barrier was only able to take part in the final six rounds of 2014. An unsuccessful return to STK1000 in 2015 led to another shot at WorldSBK in 2016 with Pedercini Racing; yet injury hit the Frenchman once again, leaving him on the sidelines after just three rounds.\n\nReturning to the championship in 2019 for two wildcard appearances, Barrier will join the series as a full-time entry in 2020 alongside Brixx Performance, competing onboard a Ducati V4 R."}]}
