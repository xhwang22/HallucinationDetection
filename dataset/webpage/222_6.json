{"Millicent Shelton directed Girlfriends.": [{"url": "https://millicentshelton.com/bio/", "page_content": "Millicent Shelton is an award-winning Director. In a very short time, she has established herself a noteworthy director in Television having directed an array of comedies and dramas, including, Empire, American Crime, The Flash, Black-ish, Ballers, Scandal, 30 Rock, Parenthood, and the pilot episode of Awkward. Originally the St. Louis native enrolled in Princeton University to become a lawyer. In her junior year, Shelton signed up for a \u201chands on summer film course at NYU, where she quickly discovered her passion for directing. While at NYU, Shelton received the Willard T.C. Johnson fellow award for her outstanding student work, which landed Shelton her first music video directing job for the Salt-N-Peps hit, \u201cExpressions.\u201d That groundbreaking video led to a decorated music video producing and directing career creating over 100 music videos.\n\nIn 2009, Shelton was the first African American woman to receive a primetime EMMY nomination for Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series for the \u201cApollo Apollo\u201d episode of NBC\u2019s 30 Rock. She was also the first recipient of the NAACP Image Awards for Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series for The Bernie Mac Show. In 2010, Ms. Shelton won a Peabody award and a second NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Directing in a Dramatic Series for an episode of Men Of A Certain Age. In 2014, she won a third NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series for The Hustle.\n\nRepresentation:\n\nICM \u2013 Dan Norton 310.550.4471\n\nRain Management \u2013 Anne Damato 310.954.9520\n\nDel, Shaw, Moonves, Tanaka & Finkelstein \u2013 Nina Shaw 310.979.7920"}, {"url": "https://www.dga.org/Craft/DGAQ/All-Articles/1202-Spring-2012/Close-Up-Millicent-Shelton.aspx", "page_content": "Spring 2012\n\n\n\nMillicent Shelton\n\nBalancing Act\n\nAs an active episodic TV director going from show to show, Millicent Shelton has a sometimes crazy schedule. She wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\n\nBy Margy Rochlin\n\n\n\nKEEPING HER COOL: Shelton tries to find comedy in the chaos and defuse tension with laughter.\n\nMillicent Shelton found herself walking onto the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank and wondering for a second, \u201cWhere am I again?\u201d For Shelton, this sort of momentary geographic disconnect means that business is booming. Over the past seven years, Shelton has directed a far-flung variety of episodic TV shows, from her Emmy-nominated installment of NBC\u2019s 30 Rock to TNT\u2019s now-defunct rumination on the male midlife crisis, Men of a Certain Age, to 90210, the CW\u2019s glossy update of the classic Aaron Spelling teen soap.\n\n\u201cI love being a guest director. I love it,\u201d Shelton says sitting in the dining room of her spacious townhouse seizing a quiet moment for dinner while her 4-year-old twins are asleep upstairs. \u201cI have director\u2019s [attention deficit disorder],\u201d says Shelton who possesses the perfect attributes for someone whose occupation involves only occasionally returning to the same set twice: an upbeat outlook, bottomless reserves of energy, a restless mind, and a love of prepping. \u201cI get bored if I have to do the same thing over and over again. I love jumping around to different shows and different styles of shooting.\u201d\n\nBut back in 2005, Shelton\u2014whose earliest credits include writing and directing music videos for chart-toppers such as Salt-N-Pepa, R. Kelly, and Aaliyah\u2014didn\u2019t immediately grasp the rich possibilities of what a helmer-for-hire could contribute to an established, long-running television series. \u201cIn music videos it was all about being original, it was all about me, my vision,\u201d says Shelton. \u201cWhen I started doing television I thought my job was to disappear. I thought it was about doing their show the way they\u2019d always done it. Then I learned that\u2019s not what they want. They want me to stay within the box of their show but to give it the Millicent twist.\u201d\n\nWhat Shelton quickly found was that by throwing herself into full-bore research mode\u2014meticulously watching as many previous episodes as she could and poring over old scripts\u2014when she hit the set she could easily discern when to shoot a scene in the pre- ordained style of the show and where she could insert a creative flourish. Whenever possible, Shelton worked with actors who might have gone on autopilot to help bring nuances to a performance. Often without anyone noticing, she\u2019d slip in what she considers her signature\u2014a cinematic wide shot such as the one featured in an episode of Californication. \u201cIt was sort of an homage to Beverly Hills Cop,\u201d says Shelton, referring to a fleeting bit of footage in an exchange at a firing range between David Duchovny\u2019s dissipated Hollywood screenwriter character and a bonkers rap magnate.\n\nIt was on her second episodic gig ever\u2014The Bernie Mac Show\u2014when it dawned on Shelton that she also had the right upbringing for someone who would often find herself face to face with the behavioral unpredictability of talent. From Day One until the Martini Shot, Mac, the sitcom\u2019s creator and star, found reasons to carp at Shelton. \u201cI thought, \u2018Oh my God. He hates me.\u2019 But I got through it. On the last day, Bernie took me aside and said, \u2018You have thick skin. I like you.\u2019 It was a test,\u201d says Shelton. She passed, crediting both her internal grit and tendency to see humor in pandemonium, something she learned from being the youngest of four children in her St. Louis household. \u201cI got picked on a lot. I can deal with an actor who\u2019s having a bad day, missing their kids, being in a bad mood. It isn\u2019t personal. I try to defuse things with laughter. I find comedy in a lot of chaos. Things are going crazy and everybody else is freaking out, and I\u2019m like, \u2018This is kind of funny.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe way Shelton tells the story of how she ended up in show business definitely has its elements of slapstick. After getting her undergraduate degree in English from Princeton and at occupational loose ends, Shelton\u2019s older sister urged her to send a resume to her friend David Lee\u2019s brother, Spike. The next thing she knew, Shelton was the most overly educated production assistant in the wardrobe department of Lee\u2019s 1989 race relations drama, Do the Right Thing. When that wrapped, she landed a spot in wardrobe at The Cosby Show. In the hopes of using a short film she was making to get into film school, she solicited her blunt-speaking boss as a test audience of one. \u201c[Bill Cosby] gave me some really harsh criticism,\u201d says Shelton with a weak smile, \u201cwhich I needed to hear, but I recut it and submitted it to Tisch [School of the Arts at NYU] and I got in.\u201d\n\n\n\nShelton working with Virginia Madsen on the cable movie Hornet's Nest.\n\nNo one can say it has always been easy. After her 1998 hip-hop road trip feature debut, Ride, which she wrote and directed, performed weakly at the box office, Shelton found it a struggle to get work. But instead of complaining she went back to the drawing board and shadowed veteran director and Guild first vice president Paris Barclay (NYPD Blue, Sons of Anarchy) for three years. \u201cA lot of people\u2014black, white, and other, men and women\u2014don\u2019t succeed because they give up. I didn\u2019t give up,\u201d says Shelton, a member of the DGA\u2019s African American Steering Committee, which, in addition to tributes and educational events, actively explores ways to assist the Guild in improving employment opportunities for members of color. \u201cOpening your show up to different vantage points actually can be a really good thing,\u201d says Shelton, who when confronted by doubters uses herself as a case in point. \u201cI\u2019m an African-American female. You wouldn\u2019t think I\u2019d do so well on a show called Men of a Certain Age. You wouldn\u2019t think that would be a match. But it was a great match.\u201d\n\nOver the past several months, Shelton has directed the pilot episode from MTV\u2019s Awkward and a TV movie of best-selling crime novelist Patricia Cornwell\u2019s Hornet\u2019s Nest for TNT. In 12 hours or so, she\u2019ll be directing an episode of Harry\u2019s Law. But it\u2019s 8 p.m. now and she still has prep work to attend to.\n\nSuddenly, a loud thumping noise can be heard as Shelton\u2019s husband sprints up the stairs: one of her twins is out of bed and apparently practicing Gymboree moves. Meanwhile, Wookie, her fluffy white Shih Tzu, begins, for reasons unknown, excitedly racing around in circles. \u201cYou should see it here at breakfast,\u201d jokes Shelton, who makes mornings at the Sheltons\u2019 sound like a night at Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a juggling act. But I love my kids and I love what I do,\u201d says Shelton who\u2019d like to get 10 minutes or so with some other female directors with young kids and swap tips on time-management and motherhood. \u201cEveryone always asks me, \u2018How do you do it?\u2019\u201d she laughs. \u201cAnd I always say, \u2018I drink a lot of espresso and I don\u2019t sleep much.\u2019\u201d"}, {"url": "https://paw.princeton.edu/article/millicent-shelton-88-excels-directors-chair", "page_content": "Courtesy Millicent Shelton\n\nEmmy-nominated writer and director Millicent Shelton \u201988 has directed music videos for the likes of R. Kelly and Mary J. Blige, along with episodes of The Flash, 30 Rock, Ballers, Scandal, Black-ish, and several other TV shows. But she doesn\u2019t have a single body of work that\u2019s her favorite.\n\n\u201cI see fault in everything I direct,\u201d Shelton explains. \u201cWhen I don\u2019t, then I will retire.\u201d\n\nA few do stand out, including American Crime, The Flash, Black-ish, and Men of a Certain Age. One of the highlights of Shelton\u2019s career was being the first African-American woman to earn a Primetime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series with 2009\u2019s 30 Rock episode \u201cApollo, Apollo.\u201d The plot revolved around Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) turning 50 and featured the Muppets and Adam West.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still bummed that I didn\u2019t win! I honestly don\u2019t think about being one of the few African-American female directors while I\u2019m on-set. I think it would be too depressing. I focus on the job and the craft. I want to be the best director possible \u2014 period,\u201d Shelton says. \u201cIt was an honor to be nominated but very sobering to realize that I was the first one and it was 2009! One day, I plan to win that damn Emmy.\u201d\n\nShelton with Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson on the set of Ballers. Courtesy Millicent Shelton\n\n\u201cWhen I returned to Princeton, [Sitney] taught me almost everything I know to this day about film theory,\u201d Shelton says.\n\nHer first job in the film industry was as a wardrobe production assistant on 1989\u2019s Do the Right Thing, written and directed by Spike Lee, who was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nWorking on the film was a transformative experience. Shelton slept on the floor of her sister\u2019s Brooklyn brownstone and worked for nothing until earning a promotion to production assistant (\u201ca very small paycheck, but it at least put food in my mouth,\u201d she says). \u201cI had never been on a film set before or with \u2018real\u2019 actors. It was amazing to see Ossie Davis transform into Da Mayor as he walked down the street to the set,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI learned so much \u2014 and it was the hottest summer in New York City!\u201d\n\nAfterward, Shelton co-wrote a script with music producer Hurby Azor for hip-hop duo Kid \u2019n Play. Although it was never completed, the project led to her directing the videos for two Salt-n-Pepa songs, \u201cExpressions\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s Talk About Sex.\u201d She eventually founded her own production company and directed almost 100 music videos.\n\nShelton wrote and directed the 1998 comedy feature Ride. However, the script was changed in pre-production without her knowledge, souring her experience on the project and disillusioning her with the film industry. Actor Dean Cain \u201988, a friend and classmate, encouraged her to try directing television.\n\nSince then, she\u2019s directed more than 60 TV episodes, spanning drama, comedy, and action. \u201cI think the knowledge of all three has made me a better director,\u201d she says. \u201cI can bring heart to a comedy, momentary lightness to a drama, and both to an action show. It keeps everything fresh for me.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/millicent_shelton", "page_content": "Highest Rated: 31% End of the Road (2022)\n\nLowest Rated: 31% End of the Road (2022)\n\nBirthday: Not Available\n\nBirthplace: St. Louis, Missouri, USA\n\nHaving already made her career as a prolific director of music videos, in the mid-2000s Millicent Shelton turned her attention to television directing.

Our readers would love to get to know you a bit better. Can you tell us a bit of the \u2018backstory\u2019 of how you grew up?\n\nI grew up in St. Louis way out in the suburbs. I went to college at Princeton university in new jersey and every weekend I\u2019d ride the train to New York City to hang out. It only made sense for me to move to new york after graduation and eventually earn my master's in film from NYU while directing music videos to pay the bills.\n\nCan you share a story with us about what brought you to this specific career path?\n\nI had to decide what I was going to major in at Princeton. I grew up believing that I wanted to be a lawyer but after interning for a summer at a law firm, I knew that was not the job for me. My mother told me to select a field that I loved but I had no clue what that was. It took me a while to do some soul searching. I remembered that I enjoyed creative writing. I took a summer course at NYU to explore what it was like to create a short film from a writer\u2019s perspective and ended up loving being a director. By the end of the summer, i knew that there was no other job but directing for me.\n\nCan you share the funniest or most interesting story that occurred to you in the course of your filmmaking career?\n\nOne of my craziest experiences on set came during the filming of \u201cend of the road.\u201d I had just called cut on a scene with beau bridges outside of our motel location and we started to set up for the next scene when suddenly the blue sky turned brown, and we were hit with high winds mixed with sand so thick that you couldn\u2019t see 3 feet in front of you. It\u2019s called a \u2018haboob\u2019 which is a crazy intense dust storm. It lasted for 45 minutes then suddenly stopped and the most breathtaking sunset appeared. We filmed the SUV driving up to the motel in that light.\n\nWho are some of the most interesting people you have interacted with? What was that like? Do you have any stories?\n\nI have worked with so many brilliantly talented people. It was a dream of a lifetime to work with Al Pacino on \u201cHunters\u2019. Every time I search for a visual film reference, one of his films appears! He\u2019s been in so many iconic movies, its mind-blowing. He was a truly lovely actor who was collaborative and giving. There was a moment the first day that we worked together that I thought maybe I shouldn\u2019t give Al Pacino a note, but that\u2019s my job as a director. I gave him notes but I made sure that they were smart notes that I could back up and notes that would further enhance the magic that he naturally creates. He gave me a big hug on his last day and said, \u201cI\u2019d like to work with you again, kid.\u201d I liked that he called me kid. It would be a blessing to work with Al again.\n\nNone of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?\n\nMy favorite professor at NYU was Nick Tanis. He taught me how to transform my daydreams into filmable images. Paris Barclay has been my mentor for years. I shadowed him off and on for 3 years trying to get my first break as a director in episodic television. On the first episode that I was hired on, Paris promised the producers that he would guide me through it and be there if I froze up then privately he told me that I could handle the job on my own which I did. Until covid, I was having an annual breakfast with David Nutter who is also a mentor to me. He was instrumental in helping me to move into action television and was a sounding board for me during my first pilot. There are countless other people that have helped me, but it would take up pages and pages! I am a driven person but have had lots of help along the way.\n\nCan you please give us your favorite \u201clife lesson quote\u201d? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?\n\n\u2018Never give up\u2019 is my favorite quote. I started directing during a time when women and especially women of color were not welcomed with open arms as Hollywood television directors. There were lots of doors that were not open. I wanted to give up a lot, but that quote would ring through my head. My testimony is that I am here today because I had blind faith and perseverance and did not give up on my dream.\n\nI am very interested in diversity in the entertainment industry. Can you share three reasons with our readers about why you think it\u2019s important to have diversity represented in film and television? How can that potentially affect our culture?\n\nI wholeheartedly believe in diversity. To me, diversity is a little bit of everyone, inclusive of all races, gender, and LGBTIQQ+. It\u2019s important because cinema should be reflective of real life and our world is diverse. The more we have diverse voices behind the screen, the more our stories will ring true and have realistic characters, dialogue, and actions. The more that we explore diverse stories, the more that we realize that despite our ethnic or socio-economic differences, we are all very much the same. Family is family. Fear is fear. Love is love.\n\nWhat are some of the most interesting or exciting projects you are working on now?\n\nBeing able to shepherd \u2018end of the road\u2019 has been a wonderful experience that I am very proud of. It was great to collaborate with queen Latifah again. We worked together to create a black family with a female matriarch who is a smart, strong, mama bear willing to do whatever is necessary to protect her family. After this, I am in development on a Josephine Baker limited series with Ruth Negga attached in the leading role. I am super excited about that. We\u2019re looking to delve deeper into Josephine than ever before. I can\u2019t wait to see what ruth does with this part. She\u2019s amazing!\n\nWhich aspect of your work makes you most proud? Can you explain or give a story?\n\nI am most proud of my ability to collaborate with actors. They are the conduit for the soul of the characters and I respect their position. I love hearing their point of view and then working to make sure that the feeling that they desire to convey is truly coming through. Both queen Latifah and Chris \u2018Ludacris\u2019 bridges were laser-focused on representing their characters in their truest light. They trusted me to give them feedback in order to make their performances stronger. Another actor that I\u2019ve worked with is Forest Whitaker. He is the king of nuanced performances. When I worked with him on \u2018empire\u2019, I noticed that he would subtly change his performance with each take. We\u2019d discuss it after each take and then land on the read that we both felt sold the story and character best.\n\nOk super. Here is the main question of our interview. What are your \u201c5 things I wish someone told me when I first started\u201d and why? Please share a story or example for each.\n\nGet sleep because production will seep into your dreams, and you will never have a sound sleep again. Trust your gut because you must stand up or fall down based on your own thoughts not because someone told you to do it. Be fearless. A healthy amount of fear is normal but don\u2019t be too scared that it limits your ability to dream outside of the box. Listen to everyone. This doesn\u2019t mean doing everything that everyone suggests but be smart enough and open enough to hear thoughts that may lead you to something great. Learn to say \u2018no.\u2019 it\u2019s actually a secret power.\n\nWhen you create a film, which stakeholders have the greatest impact on the artistic and cinematic choices you make? Is it the viewers, the critics, the financiers, or your own personal artistic vision? Can you share a story with us or give an example of what you mean?\n\nWhen I create, I can\u2019t think about what critics will say or it would make my mind spin. I read the material, daydream about it, and try to stay true to it. My goal is to take the 2-dimensional words off the page and breathe life into their 3-dimensional existence with the help of actors and amazing crew members. I like to say that as a director, \u2018i service script.\u2019\n\nYou are a person of great influence. If you could start a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. :-)\n\nMy movement would be for equality and parity for all. In particular, a woman\u2019s right to choose how she uses her body.\n\nWe are very blessed that some of the biggest names in business, vc funding, sports, and entertainment read this column. Is there a person in the world, or in the US whom you would love to have a private breakfast or lunch with, and why? He or she might see this. :-)\n\nI would like to sit down and have a quiet lunch with president Barrack Obama. I can\u2019t imagine the stories he has to share but I know they are deep.\n\nHow can our readers further follow you online?\n\nThey can follow me on instagram at @shelton9mil. I try to keep it updated!\n\nThis was very meaningful, thank you so much! We wish you continued success!"}, {"url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/30-rock-director-millicen_n_303837", "page_content": "Director Millicent Shelton, 43, became an African-American first when she received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series for NBC's \"30 Rock.\" The award show may be over, but Shelton breaks down barriers and Hollywood's tough lessons.\n\nESSENCE.COM: Congratulations on your nomination.

She\u2019s also a fan of The Walking Dead, and she\u2019ll be forever known as the director who brought \u201cScars\u201d to life.\n\nWe had a chance to speak with Millicent Shelton about her experience directing \u201cScars\u201d and she shared some keen insight into her process in crafting the episode, along with the great lengths that production took to prepare everyone for such challenging scenes.\n\n(Sarabeth Pollock): What went through your head when you read the script for \u201cScars?\u201d\n\n(Millicent Shelton): Well, I\u2019ve seen all of the episodes leading up to season 9, and then I read the scripts for the episodes leading up to mine. But as you can see mine doesn\u2019t really have lots to do with the Whisperers. I had to read it a couple of times to really see how it moved through times. I like working on tough episodes and this was a tough episode. I really liked having this challenge.\n\nOne of the questions I\u2019ve heard around the fandom is why this episode came at this point in the season. From a narrative perspective, do you think it had to come now, rather than sooner in the season?\n\nMy guess is that the whole arc of the Whisperers had to be established in order to make it payoff at the end [of \u201cScars\u201d]. To jump in during the middle of that might have jeopardized what was going on with the bigger arc of the season. This is giving the history of why the walls are up, and why Michonne is so guarded and why the scars are there. When you see someone has a scar you don\u2019t usually talk to them about it and you don\u2019t know the effect of it. That\u2019s what this episode is about, the physical and emotional scars ever since Jocelyn came back into her life.\n\nHaving an actress like Rutina Wesley in this episode was so key, because the former True Blood star plays straight so well and doesn\u2019t reveal a lot of emotion, so for Michonne to be so excited to see her and then have her betray her was so powerful.\n\nFor us, it was really important that they came across as old friends. It\u2019s like you grow up with someone and go off to different colleges and move to different cities and then you see each other and pick things right where you left off, like time hasn\u2019t passed. When you see that scene in the kitchen you see that, and there\u2019s no indication that something is going to happen. It\u2019s authentic. So when the turn does happen you\u2019re just shocked and heartbroken.\n\nShelton continued by talking about how the authenticity of Michonne\u2019s friendship with Jocelyn played heavily into the scene where they were being branded.\n\nFor me, the most powerful thing was to be in the room with them when she was getting branded. When Michonne was getting branded Danai leaned into it. The camera operator was actually standing right next to Ru and Danai leaned so far forward that [Rutina] took a step back. She wasn\u2019t supposed to be in the shot but he got that profile show of Danai screaming in her face, and it was so powerful. I just let it go. You could see the energy in the room. Ru just took it all, and then after I said cut she was just a wreck because all of that energy went right into her body.\n\nThat scene, I said to Danai, was my homage to Scarface. That scene when he\u2019s being cut with the chainsaw. And even in Scarface you don\u2019t see that he\u2019s being cut into pieces because it\u2019s all in his face. The horror of the moment plays on Michonne\u2019s face and that was just the most amazing moment being in the room for that.\n\nPeople will be talking about the powerful emotions in this episode, and you had to do it all with so many children around. Are they aware of how big the scene is? How did you make it all happen?\n\nWe were really conscious of [what was happening in this episode] and wanted to make sure we did no damage to these young actors. In the casting process the parents we made aware of what this episode was about. Once they were cast, each one of them had to sit down with a psychologist individually to go through the scenes and the script to make sure they understood that these stories aren\u2019t real.\n\nBefore we shot we had a meeting in a conference room with the parents, the kids, the AD, myself and the actors and producers and we talked them through every single thing. All of the choreography was discussed with the stunt coordinator. Everybody knew everything so that when we were on set there were no concerns or issues.\n\nWhen we were on set they were all comfortable, we had rubber knives and they knew the stunts so it was fine.\n\nWhat was it like having so many kids on set?\n\nThat was crazy. Matthew Goodwin is an amazing AD and he scheduled all of it. There were lots of body doubles.\n\n\u201cScars\u201d is really an amazing episode because it\u2019s gory but you don\u2019t see it. So much of what happens is implied but you don\u2019t actually see a lot of actual gore, which really serves to highlight things like the blood on Michonne\u2019s stomach. It\u2019s such a masterfully crafted episode.\n\nThank you! It was always written to be the juxtaposition between the kids and the walkers. I augmented it a bit when we were storyboarding, but I do think it was smart that that was the way to show it. One of my main concerns was that Michonne is not a monster and she wasn\u2019t just just killing kids. She had no choice. She did it to save her daughter and to save her unborn child and to save herself. We had to make sure that the kids were totally feral, and that they were no going to give up so she had no choice. Danai kept saying \u201cplease stop, please stop\u201d but on set we kept telling the kids not to stop. And we wanted to make sure the audience saw that she had no choice and she was definitely not enjoying this.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting, too, because Daryl had no part in killing the children. He came into it seeing the aftermath.\n\nRight. The episode is called \u201cScars\u201d but it\u2019s not just about the physical scars. It\u2019s about the emotional scars. Even though Daryl didn\u2019t have to physically do anything to the kids, he was scarred emotionally.\n\nNegan revealed to Michonne that he has told Judith everything he did, including killing Glenn and Abraham. Knowing that Michonne has been keeping secrets from Judith to protect her, was this scene something that had to happen to trigger Michonne and show her that Judith might be able to look past whatever she\u2019s hiding?\n\nYeah, and it also shows that a wound is still a wound. That psychological wound is still there. There\u2019s a moment at the end of the scene where Negan looks at Michonne and goes \u201cOh, you don\u2019t know where your daughter is\u201d and that opens the wound right there. She\u2019s good at covering her pain up but he sees right through it. And you can see it in her eyes, you know she\u2019s in pain.\n\nDo you think it was important for the story that it was her worst enemy who managed to see right through her?\n\nYes. And he\u2019s the one who\u2019s behind bars but she\u2019s the one who is trapped.\n\nYou\u2019re going to go down as the director who worked with two Judiths in this episode, which was huge story for Cailey Fleming\u2019s Judith because up until now we\u2019ve only ever seen her as a total badass. We see her vulnerability for the first time.\n\nShe\u2019s an amazing young actor, I have to say. And when we see her on that rock when she\u2019s talking about when they stopped caring about Carol, there were so many tender moments. When she\u2019s on the lake with Daryl, and he\u2019s imitating how she\u2019s sitting. She\u2019s just so amazing, I mean, she went toe to toe with Danai. She\u2019s just a very advanced actress for her age.\n\nI talked to her like I talk to the other actors. I don\u2019t talk down to kids, so we just talked about what was going on with the scene and she was just so good.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint there were so many moving pieces to this episode. Most shows don\u2019t deal with multiple realities or timelines. You\u2019ve directed an episode of The Flash with multiple universes, and now this episode of The Walking Dead has different timelines. Can you talk about the challenge of moving between timelines?\n\nThe hair and makeup and wardrobe were important, and again Assistant Director Matthew Goodwin was so helpful in dealing with the timelines. The biggest thing that I wanted to focus on was that the transitions between timelines were clear, so no one would be sitting there wondering what was happening. I wanted it to be clear.\n\nWhen we jump around, back and forth, we use something to show the change in time. I tried to ground people in something that was familiar.\n\nOne of the biggest tells was Michonne\u2019s pregnancy. What was it like for her to be so pregnant on set?\n\nI know that thing was heavy! There was a fake belly when she was smaller, like one of those pillow things. But when she had to be cut Greg Nicotero had to build her something and it had the texture of chicken cutlets, like a really soft fabric. It went over her head and arms like a glove, so that you could see her skin because it was a pregnancy belly.\n\nThis is going to go down as one of the most powerful episodes of The Walking Dead ever.\n\nThis is a character study of Michonne. She has been one of the strongest characters on television that I\u2019ve seen. She\u2019s always been impenetrable but this episode does show her psychological wounds and being able to be broken like we\u2019ve never seen before. It gives us great insight into her character, and I think it\u2019s a very positive thing.\n\nIt was such a pleasure to talk with Millicent Shelton about her episode of The Walking Dead. You\u2019ll be able to see her work again soon soon on the hit FOX show 9-1-1, where she directed an upcoming episode titled \u201cFight or Flight.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://thetvdb.com/series/girlfriends", "page_content": "A new season may be added only after the completion of the previous season, and after the new season has been announced.

Shelton is an American music video, television and film director.Shelton began her career as a wardrobe production assistant on the Spike Lee film Do the Right Thing (1989).

She wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\n\nBy Margy Rochlin\n\n\n\nKEEPING HER COOL: Shelton tries to find comedy in the chaos and defuse tension with laughter.\n\nMillicent Shelton found herself walking onto the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank and wondering for a second, \u201cWhere am I again?\u201d For Shelton, this sort of momentary geographic disconnect means that business is booming. Over the past seven years, Shelton has directed a far-flung variety of episodic TV shows, from her Emmy-nominated installment of NBC\u2019s 30 Rock to TNT\u2019s now-defunct rumination on the male midlife crisis, Men of a Certain Age, to 90210, the CW\u2019s glossy update of the classic Aaron Spelling teen soap.\n\n\u201cI love being a guest director. I love it,\u201d Shelton says sitting in the dining room of her spacious townhouse seizing a quiet moment for dinner while her 4-year-old twins are asleep upstairs. \u201cI have director\u2019s [attention deficit disorder],\u201d says Shelton who possesses the perfect attributes for someone whose occupation involves only occasionally returning to the same set twice: an upbeat outlook, bottomless reserves of energy, a restless mind, and a love of prepping. \u201cI get bored if I have to do the same thing over and over again. I love jumping around to different shows and different styles of shooting.\u201d\n\nBut back in 2005, Shelton\u2014whose earliest credits include writing and directing music videos for chart-toppers such as Salt-N-Pepa, R. Kelly, and Aaliyah\u2014didn\u2019t immediately grasp the rich possibilities of what a helmer-for-hire could contribute to an established, long-running television series. \u201cIn music videos it was all about being original, it was all about me, my vision,\u201d says Shelton. \u201cWhen I started doing television I thought my job was to disappear. I thought it was about doing their show the way they\u2019d always done it. Then I learned that\u2019s not what they want. They want me to stay within the box of their show but to give it the Millicent twist.\u201d\n\nWhat Shelton quickly found was that by throwing herself into full-bore research mode\u2014meticulously watching as many previous episodes as she could and poring over old scripts\u2014when she hit the set she could easily discern when to shoot a scene in the pre- ordained style of the show and where she could insert a creative flourish. Whenever possible, Shelton worked with actors who might have gone on autopilot to help bring nuances to a performance. Often without anyone noticing, she\u2019d slip in what she considers her signature\u2014a cinematic wide shot such as the one featured in an episode of Californication. \u201cIt was sort of an homage to Beverly Hills Cop,\u201d says Shelton, referring to a fleeting bit of footage in an exchange at a firing range between David Duchovny\u2019s dissipated Hollywood screenwriter character and a bonkers rap magnate.\n\nIt was on her second episodic gig ever\u2014The Bernie Mac Show\u2014when it dawned on Shelton that she also had the right upbringing for someone who would often find herself face to face with the behavioral unpredictability of talent. From Day One until the Martini Shot, Mac, the sitcom\u2019s creator and star, found reasons to carp at Shelton. \u201cI thought, \u2018Oh my God. He hates me.\u2019 But I got through it. On the last day, Bernie took me aside and said, \u2018You have thick skin. I like you.\u2019 It was a test,\u201d says Shelton. She passed, crediting both her internal grit and tendency to see humor in pandemonium, something she learned from being the youngest of four children in her St. Louis household. \u201cI got picked on a lot. I can deal with an actor who\u2019s having a bad day, missing their kids, being in a bad mood. It isn\u2019t personal. I try to defuse things with laughter. I find comedy in a lot of chaos. Things are going crazy and everybody else is freaking out, and I\u2019m like, \u2018This is kind of funny.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe way Shelton tells the story of how she ended up in show business definitely has its elements of slapstick. After getting her undergraduate degree in English from Princeton and at occupational loose ends, Shelton\u2019s older sister urged her to send a resume to her friend David Lee\u2019s brother, Spike. The next thing she knew, Shelton was the most overly educated production assistant in the wardrobe department of Lee\u2019s 1989 race relations drama, Do the Right Thing. When that wrapped, she landed a spot in wardrobe at The Cosby Show. In the hopes of using a short film she was making to get into film school, she solicited her blunt-speaking boss as a test audience of one. \u201c[Bill Cosby] gave me some really harsh criticism,\u201d says Shelton with a weak smile, \u201cwhich I needed to hear, but I recut it and submitted it to Tisch [School of the Arts at NYU] and I got in.\u201d\n\n\n\nShelton working with Virginia Madsen on the cable movie Hornet's Nest.\n\nNo one can say it has always been easy. After her 1998 hip-hop road trip feature debut, Ride, which she wrote and directed, performed weakly at the box office, Shelton found it a struggle to get work. But instead of complaining she went back to the drawing board and shadowed veteran director and Guild first vice president Paris Barclay (NYPD Blue, Sons of Anarchy) for three years. \u201cA lot of people\u2014black, white, and other, men and women\u2014don\u2019t succeed because they give up. I didn\u2019t give up,\u201d says Shelton, a member of the DGA\u2019s African American Steering Committee, which, in addition to tributes and educational events, actively explores ways to assist the Guild in improving employment opportunities for members of color. \u201cOpening your show up to different vantage points actually can be a really good thing,\u201d says Shelton, who when confronted by doubters uses herself as a case in point. \u201cI\u2019m an African-American female. You wouldn\u2019t think I\u2019d do so well on a show called Men of a Certain Age. You wouldn\u2019t think that would be a match. But it was a great match.\u201d\n\nOver the past several months, Shelton has directed the pilot episode from MTV\u2019s Awkward and a TV movie of best-selling crime novelist Patricia Cornwell\u2019s Hornet\u2019s Nest for TNT. In 12 hours or so, she\u2019ll be directing an episode of Harry\u2019s Law. But it\u2019s 8 p.m. now and she still has prep work to attend to.\n\nSuddenly, a loud thumping noise can be heard as Shelton\u2019s husband sprints up the stairs: one of her twins is out of bed and apparently practicing Gymboree moves. Meanwhile, Wookie, her fluffy white Shih Tzu, begins, for reasons unknown, excitedly racing around in circles. \u201cYou should see it here at breakfast,\u201d jokes Shelton, who makes mornings at the Sheltons\u2019 sound like a night at Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a juggling act. But I love my kids and I love what I do,\u201d says Shelton who\u2019d like to get 10 minutes or so with some other female directors with young kids and swap tips on time-management and motherhood. \u201cEveryone always asks me, \u2018How do you do it?\u2019\u201d she laughs. \u201cAnd I always say, \u2018I drink a lot of espresso and I don\u2019t sleep much.\u2019\u201d"}, {"url": "https://thetvdb.com/series/girlfriends", "page_content": "A new season may be added only after the completion of the previous season, and after the new season has been announced.

Our readers would love to get to know you a bit better. Can you tell us a bit of the \u2018backstory\u2019 of how you grew up?\n\nI grew up in St. Louis way out in the suburbs. I went to college at Princeton university in new jersey and every weekend I\u2019d ride the train to New York City to hang out. It only made sense for me to move to new york after graduation and eventually earn my master's in film from NYU while directing music videos to pay the bills.\n\nCan you share a story with us about what brought you to this specific career path?\n\nI had to decide what I was going to major in at Princeton. I grew up believing that I wanted to be a lawyer but after interning for a summer at a law firm, I knew that was not the job for me. My mother told me to select a field that I loved but I had no clue what that was. It took me a while to do some soul searching. I remembered that I enjoyed creative writing. I took a summer course at NYU to explore what it was like to create a short film from a writer\u2019s perspective and ended up loving being a director. By the end of the summer, i knew that there was no other job but directing for me.\n\nCan you share the funniest or most interesting story that occurred to you in the course of your filmmaking career?\n\nOne of my craziest experiences on set came during the filming of \u201cend of the road.\u201d I had just called cut on a scene with beau bridges outside of our motel location and we started to set up for the next scene when suddenly the blue sky turned brown, and we were hit with high winds mixed with sand so thick that you couldn\u2019t see 3 feet in front of you. It\u2019s called a \u2018haboob\u2019 which is a crazy intense dust storm. It lasted for 45 minutes then suddenly stopped and the most breathtaking sunset appeared. We filmed the SUV driving up to the motel in that light.\n\nWho are some of the most interesting people you have interacted with? What was that like? Do you have any stories?\n\nI have worked with so many brilliantly talented people. It was a dream of a lifetime to work with Al Pacino on \u201cHunters\u2019. Every time I search for a visual film reference, one of his films appears! He\u2019s been in so many iconic movies, its mind-blowing. He was a truly lovely actor who was collaborative and giving. There was a moment the first day that we worked together that I thought maybe I shouldn\u2019t give Al Pacino a note, but that\u2019s my job as a director. I gave him notes but I made sure that they were smart notes that I could back up and notes that would further enhance the magic that he naturally creates. He gave me a big hug on his last day and said, \u201cI\u2019d like to work with you again, kid.\u201d I liked that he called me kid. It would be a blessing to work with Al again.\n\nNone of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?\n\nMy favorite professor at NYU was Nick Tanis. He taught me how to transform my daydreams into filmable images. Paris Barclay has been my mentor for years. I shadowed him off and on for 3 years trying to get my first break as a director in episodic television. On the first episode that I was hired on, Paris promised the producers that he would guide me through it and be there if I froze up then privately he told me that I could handle the job on my own which I did. Until covid, I was having an annual breakfast with David Nutter who is also a mentor to me. He was instrumental in helping me to move into action television and was a sounding board for me during my first pilot. There are countless other people that have helped me, but it would take up pages and pages! I am a driven person but have had lots of help along the way.\n\nCan you please give us your favorite \u201clife lesson quote\u201d? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?\n\n\u2018Never give up\u2019 is my favorite quote. I started directing during a time when women and especially women of color were not welcomed with open arms as Hollywood television directors. There were lots of doors that were not open. I wanted to give up a lot, but that quote would ring through my head. My testimony is that I am here today because I had blind faith and perseverance and did not give up on my dream.\n\nI am very interested in diversity in the entertainment industry. Can you share three reasons with our readers about why you think it\u2019s important to have diversity represented in film and television? How can that potentially affect our culture?\n\nI wholeheartedly believe in diversity. To me, diversity is a little bit of everyone, inclusive of all races, gender, and LGBTIQQ+. It\u2019s important because cinema should be reflective of real life and our world is diverse. The more we have diverse voices behind the screen, the more our stories will ring true and have realistic characters, dialogue, and actions. The more that we explore diverse stories, the more that we realize that despite our ethnic or socio-economic differences, we are all very much the same. Family is family. Fear is fear. Love is love.\n\nWhat are some of the most interesting or exciting projects you are working on now?\n\nBeing able to shepherd \u2018end of the road\u2019 has been a wonderful experience that I am very proud of. It was great to collaborate with queen Latifah again. We worked together to create a black family with a female matriarch who is a smart, strong, mama bear willing to do whatever is necessary to protect her family. After this, I am in development on a Josephine Baker limited series with Ruth Negga attached in the leading role. I am super excited about that. We\u2019re looking to delve deeper into Josephine than ever before. I can\u2019t wait to see what ruth does with this part. She\u2019s amazing!\n\nWhich aspect of your work makes you most proud? Can you explain or give a story?\n\nI am most proud of my ability to collaborate with actors. They are the conduit for the soul of the characters and I respect their position. I love hearing their point of view and then working to make sure that the feeling that they desire to convey is truly coming through. Both queen Latifah and Chris \u2018Ludacris\u2019 bridges were laser-focused on representing their characters in their truest light. They trusted me to give them feedback in order to make their performances stronger. Another actor that I\u2019ve worked with is Forest Whitaker. He is the king of nuanced performances. When I worked with him on \u2018empire\u2019, I noticed that he would subtly change his performance with each take. We\u2019d discuss it after each take and then land on the read that we both felt sold the story and character best.\n\nOk super. Here is the main question of our interview. What are your \u201c5 things I wish someone told me when I first started\u201d and why? Please share a story or example for each.\n\nGet sleep because production will seep into your dreams, and you will never have a sound sleep again. Trust your gut because you must stand up or fall down based on your own thoughts not because someone told you to do it. Be fearless. A healthy amount of fear is normal but don\u2019t be too scared that it limits your ability to dream outside of the box. Listen to everyone. This doesn\u2019t mean doing everything that everyone suggests but be smart enough and open enough to hear thoughts that may lead you to something great. Learn to say \u2018no.\u2019 it\u2019s actually a secret power.\n\nWhen you create a film, which stakeholders have the greatest impact on the artistic and cinematic choices you make? Is it the viewers, the critics, the financiers, or your own personal artistic vision? Can you share a story with us or give an example of what you mean?\n\nWhen I create, I can\u2019t think about what critics will say or it would make my mind spin. I read the material, daydream about it, and try to stay true to it. My goal is to take the 2-dimensional words off the page and breathe life into their 3-dimensional existence with the help of actors and amazing crew members. I like to say that as a director, \u2018i service script.\u2019\n\nYou are a person of great influence. If you could start a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. :-)\n\nMy movement would be for equality and parity for all. In particular, a woman\u2019s right to choose how she uses her body.\n\nWe are very blessed that some of the biggest names in business, vc funding, sports, and entertainment read this column. Is there a person in the world, or in the US whom you would love to have a private breakfast or lunch with, and why? He or she might see this. :-)\n\nI would like to sit down and have a quiet lunch with president Barrack Obama. I can\u2019t imagine the stories he has to share but I know they are deep.\n\nHow can our readers further follow you online?\n\nThey can follow me on instagram at @shelton9mil. I try to keep it updated!\n\nThis was very meaningful, thank you so much! We wish you continued success!"}, {"url": "https://www.allamericanspeakers.com/celebritytalentbios/Millicent+Shelton/409890", "page_content": "Millicent B.

That opportunity served as a springboard to a directing career of her own across music videos, television, and film. Her direction of the 30 Rock episode \u201cApollo, Apollo\u201d would make her the first Black woman to receive an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series.\n\nWith Netflix\u2019s End of the Road (currently streaming), Shelton again works with star and producer Queen Latifah. In the film, Latifah plays Brenda, a recently widowed mother who loses her home in Los Angeles. After deciding to move home to Houston, Brenda travels across the Southwest with her brother (Ludacris) and two children (Mychala Lee, Shaun Dixon). On the journey, they run afoul of a major crime boss thanks to a bag of money that holds the potential to change their lives. The film asks viewers to experience the world through the eyes of this troubled Black family as they hold together in the face of traumatic danger.\n\nHere, in an interview with Awards Daily, Millicent Shelton talks about what drew her to the project and what it\u2019s like to work with Queen Latifah both in front of and behind the camera. She talks about the film\u2019s vivid color palate and the joyous luck in finding four actors who held so much natural chemistry together. Finally, she talks about the importance of inclusivity and the recent conversation around two major television series \u2014 HBO\u2019s House of the Dragon and Amazon Studio\u2019s The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power \u2014 who cast Black actors in major roles within the series.\n\nAwards Daily: I\u2019d like to start with recent controversies related to specific audiences rejecting inclusive efforts on such major projects as Rings of Power and House of the Dragon. How do you as a filmmaker react to that in a modern filmmaking environment? Does it make you even more determined to pursue inclusive projects?\n\nMillicent Shelton: It does. I tend to be a little bit of a rebel. I like to push against what people perceive as the norm. So the perception we have had in television and cinematically has been very Caucasian. Not only are white Americans used to that, but so are Black Americans or Asian Americans or Latino Americans. That\u2019s how a lot of body dysmorphia happens to Black girls and Latino girls and Asian girls. They don\u2019t see people like them represented as images of beauty. There\u2019s a movement now to change that.\n\nI honestly think that\u2019s what our country fought for \u2014 to have representation and freedom. If we\u2019re going to truly embrace what we say this country is about which is about embracing diversity and about the melting pot, then we should embrace that in front of and behind the camera as well. I honestly believe that we are stronger when we are like that. To me, diversity is not making an all Black film, not that I\u2019m against that. I think diversity is a mix of everybody, and it\u2019s not just different colors. It\u2019s also different religions. It\u2019s different sexual preferences. It\u2019s diversity of all, and that\u2019s what makes us as a country stronger because we get to experience a lot of different people\u2019s perspectives. I think that our creativity is better that way.\n\nIn this film, we had a mix of everyone in all key positions. We really functioned that way. I like to say that we were a crew that went through a lot of strenuous situations. We survived it as a team, and we survived it as a family. We were a very diverse family, but we survived it as a family.\n\nAD: So you have a Brazilian production designer and an Asian American cinematographer. The film has a very international visual flair. The roadside motel, in particular, doesn\u2019t look like any I\u2019ve ever seen. In fact, the entire color palate for the film is incredibly vibrant and bursting with deep, vivid colors.\n\nMS: [The motel room] is my Brazilian production designer. It\u2019s interesting because we kept looking for motel rooms, and we could not find them. They\u2019re all too little. So we decided to build it, but we had seen a reference for this one in a motel that doesn\u2019t exist anymore. It had cherubs on the wall, and that was it \u2014 Lucio\u2019s [Seixas, production designer] brain started to go. Our whole vision for this film was exaggerated reality. I wanted to push it outside of the realm of just playing on normal. So the idea of making these rooms a little over the top I embraced. We embraced the color too because we wanted extreme colors. That was kind of tough because we were shooting in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and a lot of the buildings there are beige. So, we found a gas station with a lot of color and a motel with a lot of color. Then, we added the neon tubes all around. Some people are freaked out by the color palette in this movie, but as an artist, I think sometimes we should push the boundaries of what people find to be regular.\n\nAD: The film offers this theme of the lack of connectivity, that lack of civilization, where the characters are left to their wits that have been dulled by modern technology. What was it about End of the Road that attracted you as a director?\n\nMS: What originally attracted me was the opportunity to work with Queen Latifah again. We\u2019ve sort of known each other from music videos in New York for a while, worked together on Star, and then the opportunity to work with her again\u2026 I just love working with her. Since this movie, we\u2019ve worked together on an episode of Equalizer. She\u2019s a wonderful talent. I read the script because she was attached to it. When I read it, I could relate to this woman who was reeling from the loss. The family was torn apart and found their way back to each other. From adversity, the family actually becomes stronger, and I could relate to that story. I wanted to tell that story, particularly about a Black family but it\u2019s not a story that\u2019s unique to a Black family. However, what they face going through these desolate areas with the racism that happens, both covert and overt, is something that Black people experience in the United States whether anybody wants to admit it or not. That\u2019s something that\u2019s our reality, and I wanted to be able to show that.\n\nAD: As you\u2019ve mentioned, you have worked with Queen Latifah multiple times. What was it like working with her as both an actress and as a producer on this film?\n\nMS: She functions primarily as an actress. She doesn\u2019t throw the weight of the producer title on you. She comes in with a pure heart, and she really is in the state of mind of an actress. When we got into post-production, then she went into producer mode and was really helpful in supporting me through getting this film done. So, it actually worked really well. But as an actress, she shows up prepared, and she\u2019s willing to get feedback. She\u2019s willing to give feedback, which I think is great. I love to get feedback from actors because I really admire what actors bring to the table as they bring a different sensibility than even the writers or the director brings because they live through the spirit of a character. When I hear what their thoughts are about the words and what\u2019s happening to that character, I really take that to heart. I find that it makes all the scenes better.\n\nAll the times in the movie where she makes reference to her dead husband, that\u2019s all Latifah. I lost my mother a month before we went into prep on this movie, and so I was reeling from that loss. She said, \u2018You know, when you lose somebody, you talk to them. They stay with you.\u2019 And so we talked about it. We picked moments in the film when Brenda would say something to her husband. That\u2019s how those moments came alive. That\u2019s all from the actor having a thought about the spirit of the character.\n\nAD: The film rises on those moments of that core family group. How did you work with those four actors to build that incredible chemistry that really comes across on screen?\n\nMS: The chemistry actually was there naturally. It\u2019s interesting. Queen Latifah actually recommended Ludacris for the role of Reggie. After the first time I talked to him, I was like he\u2019s Reggie. He\u2019s not really Reggie in real life, but when we were talking about it, he understood Reggie. The next person that we cast was Mikayla, who plays the daughter, and she just stood out amongst everybody. She\u2019s a wonderful actress. I just actually got to work with her again on a couple of episodes of Truth Be Told for Apple. We did a lot of chemistry test reads with her and the potentials for the brother, and Shawn read and it was just immediately chemistry. You just saw brother and sister. They went at it. They were ad libbing, and they just went at it. It was just like another brother and sister. Then, we had a cast dinner a few nights before the first day of shooting. It was just those four characters, and we had a really lovely long dinner. We just were all talking about our lives and our dreams and kind of where we came from. They started to bond as a family, and the rest was just magic. They really felt like a real family. They had nicknames for each other and everything.\n\nAD: Last question for you: let\u2019s say you have the keys to the kingdom. You\u2019ve worked in television, you\u2019ve worked in streaming, you\u2019ve worked in film, and you\u2019ve worked in music videos. You\u2019ve done a little bit of everything. If there were no barriers and budget wasn\u2019t a concern, then what would be your dream project?\n\nMS: I have a dream project right now I want to do. I want to do a limited series about Josephine Baker starring Ruth Negga. That\u2019s what I want to do.\n\nEnd of the Road is now streaming exclusively on Netflix."}]}
