{"George Milne played two further matches in the 1891 season and two in the 1892 season.": [{"url": "https://sabr.org/journal/article/1891-winter-meetings-the-making-of-the-big-league/", "page_content": "This article was written by John Bauer - Dennis Pajot\n\nThis article was published in Baseball\u2019s 19th Century Winter Meetings: 1857-1900\n\nThe end of the Brotherhood war restored the status quo ante: two major leagues, the National League and the American Association, atop the sport\u2019s pyramid. Yet, the principals of both leagues spent more of 1891 continuing war rather than securing an enduring peace.\n\nThe restoration of the two-league system proved untenable for the longer term. The 1891-1892 offseason resulted in the end of the familiar, and witnessed the creation of a single major league encompassing most of the great cities of the East and Midwest. To achieve this, baseball\u2019s magnates engaged in a series of moves and countermoves, originally intended to thwart their rivals, but ultimately leading to a 12-team partnership that endured for eight years.\n\nResolution of the 1891 League pennant\n\nBefore planning for the 1892 season, the League needed to resolve unfinished business from its 1891 campaign. The final standings showed Boston in first place with a .630 winning percentage (87-51) and Chicago in second place at .607 (82-53). Chicago alleged, however, that Boston\u2019s championship resulted from a corrupt bargain in a late-September series between Boston and New York. Chicago accused the Giants of not trying to win in order for Boston to secure the title at its expense. Boston, in the midst of a late-season charge to the pennant, swept five games from a weakened Giants squad over three days from September 28 through 30. Boston Globe columnist Tim Murnane judged the series \u201ca farce,\u201d declaring, \u201cI never saw a worse exhibition of baseball put up by a professional team in fielding and base running than the Giants gave here in the last five games.\u201d1\n\nThe complaints about the Giants\u2019 conduct related to personnel absences and substitutions: Amos Rusie not pitching, Roger Connor missing for three games, Danny Richardson being taken out for the final two games, \u201cunknown amateur\u201d Buster Burrell catching instead of regular Dick Buckley, and Buck Ewing not playing. Further, two games had been added to the series, making up dates lost earlier in the season in New York. While League rules required the consent of two-thirds of the clubs in order to schedule the extra games and the requisite six clubs consented, Chicago was not asked. New York manager Jim Mutrie noted that he scheduled the extra games for the financial benefit of the Giants.2 He explained away the personnel decisions, noting that Rusie was left at home at the pitcher\u2019s request and with President John B. Day\u2019s consent; Buckley was injured; and Connor was allowed to rest.3 While individual circumstances might be explained away, rumors that the series was taken off poolroom gambling boards helped fuel suspicion.4\n\nNew York\u2019s Executive Committee, which included J. Walter Spalding, brother of the former Chicago president, met in early October to consider the accusations. Seven players, among them Ewing, Connor, and Rusie, \u201cassert[ed] that they played with as much desire and with every effort to win games from the Bostons as any other games that they ever played.\u201d5 The committee\u2019s report to the club\u2019s board of directors exonerated the Giants players from the charges of crookedness. The Board accepted the report, which it forwarded to League President Nick Young, and also adopted a preamble and resolution stating that the club was not weakened for the purpose of losing games.\n\nChicago President James Hart led the charge against New York. The Giants were predictably indignant over Hart\u2019s claims, believing their reputations damaged, and one player claimed to have consulted an attorney.6 Heading into the League\u2019s November meeting, The Sporting News suggested the non-awarding of the pennant as a possible outcome, but doing so might acknowledge the occurrence of fraud.7 Indeed, during the November 11 meeting at New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue Hotel, Hart prosecuted the case against the Giants and sought to have the extra games thrown out.\n\nConsidering the charges, the League Board made several findings that it forwarded to the League as a whole. The Board determined two \u201cdouble games\u201d in Boston to be legal. Because six clubs consented, Chicago\u2019s approval was unnecessary. The weakened condition of the team was not known to management, and the Giants were considered to be complete with the exception of Rusie and Ewing.8 In fact, Rusie had not been effective in earlier games against Boston, so his excuse was not consequential.9 Ewing, in fact, was injured. As for Connor, the Giants excused their first baseman for the first day of the series, and a railroad wreck delayed Connor\u2019s arrival by a day. Buckley was injured by a foul tip in the first game, rendering him unavailable for the remainder of the series. The Board subsequently adopted a resolution awarding the pennant to Boston, a decision ratified by the League delegates.10\n\nAggressive moves and countermoves between NL and AA clubs\n\nConcurrent with the League resolving the controversy over last season\u2019s championship, the League and Association engaged in a series of moves and countermoves with continuing hostilities in mind. In truth, the latest round of bad blood traced its roots to the beginning of the prior season when the Association withdrew from the National Agreement in a dispute over two players awarded to League clubs at the conclusion of the Brotherhood war.\n\nAs the 1891 season came to a close, overall dissatisfaction had clubs considering their options and otherwise preparing for renewed conflict. Baltimore considered jumping from the Association to the League (with Kansas City eyeing an open spot in the Association), and Brooklyn was said to be considering moving back to the Association because profits had not materialized as hoped.11 Aside from membership shifts, each side appeared to be bracing for a settling of accounts.\n\nAmong League teams, Boston and New York wanted a \u201cwar of extermination,\u201d although Brooklyn, Cincinnati, Chicago, and Pittsburgh desired peace.12 The Association appeared to be planning major moves into Chicago and New York as a means of challenging the League. Philadelphia Athletics (AA) President J. Earle Wagner favored fighting the League, claiming that the League talked settlement while trying to induce clubs like Baltimore and St. Louis to jump.13\n\nAssociation expansion plans advanced rapidly with respect to Chicago. Association President Zach Phelps, Wagner, and Boston\u2019s Julian Hart met with Chicago interests on October 8. Within one week, articles of incorporation for the new club were filed and capital stock was established at $50,000.14 Rumors circulated that several Colts players, including pitcher Bill Hutchinson, were looking to jump across town.15 Fred Pfeffer was also expected to jump, amid reports that he would manage the new club. Poaching players was made easier by the Association no longer being party to the National Agreement. Relations were so strained that the hitherto annual postseason contest between the respective champions, both Boston clubs in this case, did not occur with Young declaring that the lack of an Agreement made such a series impossible.\n\nVarious permutations for an expanded Association were reported. One rumor suggested an expanded circuit that would include Chicago, Kansas City, Omaha, and Minneapolis-St. Paul. Another, reported to be the favored choice of Phelps and the Browns\u2019 Chris Von der Ahe, would have seen an expanded Association embracing New York, Brooklyn, Kansas City, Cincinnati, and Chicago.16\n\nThe Association had no shortage of suitors. Phelps claimed he received an application from Sioux City.17 Buffalo wanted in. Kansas City wanted in, and its president, J.W. Speas, stated that Phelps informed him that club\u2019s application would be considered at the next Association meeting.18 Kansas City was eager to escape the Western Association, with the city stated to be \u201cclamoring for major league privileges \u2026 undoubtedly sick and tired of the fluctuation of a minor league.\u201d19 At the same time, an eight-team grouping remained just as likely, leading to questions about which club would be dropped to accommodate Chicago.\n\nThe Association met at the Wellington Hotel in Chicago on October 23. In addition to the eight holdovers from the 1891 season and prospective newbies from Chicago, representatives from Kansas City and Minneapolis attended at the Association\u2019s special invitation.20 Phelps, who would be re-elected as Association president, struck an aggressive tone against the League. Noting the League\u2019s disputed pennant, Phelps delivered a report that \u201cdeveloped into a scathing arraignment of the League and its alleged methods\u201d21 and offered congratulations to his members in avoiding such chaos. Phelps stated that peace overtures involving League counterparts failed, which \u201cmakes necessary and proper that we formulate and execute our plans for the ensuing season without the expectation of any alliance.\u201d22\n\nAfter the business formalities, the Association proceeded with implementing its Chicago expansion plans. On Von der Ahe\u2019s motion, Chicago\u2019s application was accepted. One of Chicago\u2019s backers, George H. Williams, declared the action \u201ca body blow to the National League.\u201d23 Pfeffer\u2019s appointment as manager and captain was later confirmed.\n\nOpposition was rumored from Milwaukee and Columbus, the clubs most threatened with contraction if the Association continued as an eight-team circuit.24 Milwaukee had only recently joined the AA for the final 36 games of the 1891 season after King Kelly\u2019s money-losing Cincinnati entry suspended operations in August. For its part, Columbus smelled a rat and felt \u201cmarked as a lamb of slaughter\u201d25 when the Association also voted to eliminate gate-sharing for visiting teams. Milwaukee and Louisville may have felt similarly uneasy with the move seen as targeting low-drawing clubs for a freeze-out; however, if Association owners wanted to shed clubs, it would be necessary to pay for the privilege for eliminating any clubs deemed in compliance with Association rules.26 Phelps floated the idea of a 10-team Association, remarking that \u201c[t]he Columbus folks are too suspicious.\u201d27\n\nThe Association reached no definitive conclusions about its structure during the Chicago meeting. Von der Ahe, Philadelphia\u2019s Billy Barnie, and Columbus\u2019 Gus Schmelz were appointed to a committee to consider the question of league size. Kansas City, Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Buffalo submitted applications, and Brooklyn and Indianapolis reportedly wanted membership.28 Of the applicants at the Wellington Hotel, Speas assured a \u201cwild\u201d reception in Kansas City and Minneapolis\u2019s Hy Hack offered \u201cnot the slightest doubt\u201d that $60,000 in stock would be taken by Twin Cities interests.29\n\nOn the player front, the two sides both sought to recruit talent from the other league while retaining their own talent. The Association adopted Barnie\u2019s resolution to blacklist 10 players who purportedly jumped contracts to sign with League clubs. St. Louis appeared in danger of losing most of its team to the League, and Charles Comiskey weighed offers from League clubs in Cincinnati and Philadelphia to pay what Von der Ahe would not.30\n\nWhen Comiskey appeared likely to sign with Cincinnati, Von der Ahe declared he had no objection and added that Reds President John T. Brush will be \u201cbadly fooled\u201d if he expects Comiskey to win the pennant.31 In turn, the Athletics successfully recruited Connor and Richardson from the Giants with offers of three-year contracts. Others were also interested in raiding the Giants.\n\nRecently deposed Giants manager Jim Mutrie assisted Association efforts to plant a new club in Manhattan. Reports stated that Mutrie, having secured $30,000 of the $50,000 believed necessary to do so, was searching for a place to play.32 Mutrie said he could raise money for a franchise and that several sites for grounds were available. In a few days there were preliminary discussions on leasing grounds on the bluff just west of the Polo Grounds. Association backers in New York apparently made an offer to Rusie, and the New York Times named Buckley, Jack Glasscock, Charley Bassett, Jim O\u2019Rourke, and Tim Keefe as likely to join Rusie on Gotham\u2019s nonexistent Association team. Most saw this as a huge bluff on the part of the Association, \u201cintended to force the League to come down off its high horse and agree to terms favorable to the Association.\u201d33\n\nNew Giants manager Pat Powers, taking over from Mutrie, faced an urgent need to thwart player defections. Boston\u2019s Arthur Soden expressed a willingness to help his rival. He claimed to have spoken with Day about a deal for Mike \u201cKing\u201d Kelly, but \u201cif the transfer is made it will be solely because of Boston\u2019s desire to assist the New York club.\u201d34 The Giants also eyed Columbus\u2019s Jack Crooks as well as Hughie Jennings and Harry Taylor from Louisville.\n\nElsewhere, Bill Dahlen claimed he was underage when he signed his contract with the Colts in order to jump to Milwaukee.35 Chicago\u2019s Hart, already annoyed about Dahlen, also considered seeking an injunction to stop Pfeffer from setting up shop across town. Pfeffer, on the other hand, received favorable legal advice to the effect that his prior contract with Hart contained a defective option clause.36 Rumors had Jake Beckley leaving Pittsburgh to join Pfeffer\u2019s new team.37 By mid-November, The Sporting News tallied the defections at 11 moving from the League to the Association, with seven moving in the opposite direction.38\n\nMovement toward the big league\n\nAs readily as the rival leagues prosecuted their war on each other, peace negotiations occurred in the background. The two sides had met informally and intermittently since the summer without success, but those contacts never died completely. In early November, Boston rivals Soden and Charles Prince held several informal peace conferences, the primary subject matter of which appeared to be the formation of a single 12-team league.39 Similarly, Von der Ahe reportedly traveled east to meet with an unnamed League acquaintance with a peace conference the likely outcome.40\n\nWith both leagues only one year removed from the Brotherhood war, it seemed likely that the \u201cbad financial condition of baseball in general have caused backers of clubs to look forward to the conference with considerable pleasure.\u201d41 The players, profiting from high salaries through the interleague conflict, were not likely to share any enthusiasm among the magnates for peace.\n\nPrince attended the League\u2019s annual meeting on November 12, and met with several League dignitaries, including Soden, Walter Spalding, Brush, Brooklyn\u2019s Charley Byrne, Philadelphia\u2019s Al Reach, and Cleveland\u2019s Frank Robison.42 Discussions occurred about possible settlements to two-team situations presently in Boston and Philadelphia. Prince was amenable to selling out to the Triumvirs, but price needed to be decided. Reach and John I. Rogers were receptive to Philadelphia as a two-team city, which seemed consistent with an Athletics team looking to play ball.\n\nClub Treasurer George Wagner, brother of President Earle, said, \u201c[W]e want peace. We think there is room for us in the baseball business, and we have as much right to enter into baseball as any other business. \u2026 We are not looking to get the best deal, but we want a fair, equitable settlement.\u201d Wagner claimed the Athletics made a little money in 1891 and said he was looking forward to the new season.43\n\nIt became quickly apparent, however, that peace was not imminent. The leagues\u2019 principals talked peace while continuing to posture. Soden stated that \u201c[t]he League is in a good position for a fight, and I am confident we can stand it better than the Association. I certainly hope for a settlement, as the present condition of affairs hurts the game.\u201d44 Von der Ahe declared that the Association\u2019s willingness to compromise hinged on its getting the better of any deal.45 Moreover, with the Association holding 51 percent of each club\u2019s stock in trust, any potential defector would be thwarted. The meeting broke up on November 13 without a settlement of differences, with peace deemed \u201capparently as far off as ever.\u201d46\n\nAfter the League meeting, reports varied about the prospects for a settlement. Receiving no further proposals from the League, however, Phelps envisioned an independent 10-club Association.47 The Association president saw \u201cno probability of a consolidation,\u201d which would \u201cresult disastrously to base ball.\u201d48 Von der Ahe favored a 12-club Association with Kansas City, Brooklyn, and New York completing the circuit.\n\nDisputes within Brooklyn\u2019s ownership group threatened to have the collateral effect of opening a new front in any League-Association conflict. Discouraged by infighting among the Grooms owners, Gus Abell reportedly met with an Association representative about backing a rival club in Brooklyn.49 Schmelz proposed 16 clubs divided into two leagues with the teams drawn by lot from a hat.50\n\nOn the League side, Hart believed there would be a 12-team combination, although he personally favored an eight-team league.51 Robison favored settlement: \u201cThe obstacles are such as can be overcome if business judgment prevails.\u201d52 President Young agreed with the 12-club sentiment, declaring, \u201cI am still and always shall be for harmonious action between the associations.\u201d53\n\nAt the start of December, momentum increased toward consolidation of some sort but there remained many open questions. Some of these questions were stated in the most general sense; for example, with respect to the Association, \u201cit is plain to be seen that the Association magnates \u2026 do not know just what they want.\u201d54 There existed no agreement on the number of clubs or who would buy out whom and in which cities. Additionally, issues that helped define the differences between the leagues, such as Sunday baseball and admission prices, would require resolution.\n\nPreparations within the Association were beginning to bring about a merger. In early December, Von der Ahe traveled to Columbus to get an idea of what it would take to buy out that club. The Columbus people expressed a willingness to sell \u201cat a reasonable figure.\u201d55 The Association was apparently attempting to settle matters with Milwaukee at the same time. A Milwaukee law firm received a communication from some Eastern men, instructing the firm to buy a controlling interest in the Brewers at any price. A proposition was laid before the directors of the club, who considered it and offered to sell a controlling interest of the stock for $25,000, with the proviso that the club should remain in Milwaukee. If not, the stock was not for sale.56\n\nOn December 4 George Wagner agreed to head a committee to talk of a merger. With his lawyer, Frank S. Elliott, Wagner traveled to St. Louis to talk with Von der Ahe. The next day, Byrne, Brush, and Robison met Wagner, Elliott, and Von der Ahe.\n\nAfter a two-day session, a tentative agreement for the basis for a merger was brought about. This proposed agreement called for four Association clubs (Baltimore, Washington, St. Louis, and Louisville) to be admitted to the new 12-club League. Philadelphia, Columbus, and Milwaukee were to be bought out. The Chicago AA club was to be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred. Sunday games would be optional with each club. The general admission fee would be 50 cents, with 25-cent seating an option for any club desiring it. Gate receipts would be divided for 10 years upon the basis of a 45/45 split, the remaining 10 percent going into a league guarantee fund. Regarding players, all contracts would be honored as they stood, with each club retaining 15 players. The remaining players would be turned over to the league to be assigned to teams that were willing to assume the existing contracts. All disputes over players were to be referred to an arbitration committee of two disinterested men, who would select a third when no agreement could be reached. A double-season plan was recommended, as were adoptions of measures for the protection of all minor leagues.\n\nByrne was delegated to present these plans to the Eastern clubs of the League, while Brush and Robison were to sell the proposal to the Western clubs of that circuit. Wagner and Francis Richter, editor of Sporting Life (who was instrumental in bringing the agreement about) were to get Baltimore and Washington in line and explain all to Charles Prince in Boston. Von der Ahe was assigned the task of meeting with AA President Phelps, getting the Louisville club on board, and settling with Columbus, Milwaukee, and Chicago.57\n\nOn December 11 Prince, Albert Spalding, his brother Walter, and Day met Wagner, Byrne, and Richter in New York. The above agreement was explained and approved. Wagner and Richter then met with Harry Von der Horst of Baltimore and secured his hearty approval of the deal. Rogers was also satisfied with everything, except the settlement to be made with the Wagner brothers in Philadelphia. Von der Ahe quickly and quietly arranged everything with the Louisville people, and managed to make terms with the Columbus ownership.58 Columbus was a sticky point in any merger proposal, as club President Conrad Born was saying, \u201cWe won\u2019t sell out at any price and they can\u2019t force us out. We propose to stick it out until the cows come home.\u201d59 Soon, however, Born said that if the other clubs made a bona-fide proposition to buy the club, it \u201cwould be carefully considered.\u201d60\n\nLeague and Association magnates agreed to meet in Indianapolis on December 15 in what was expected to be the definitive meeting on consolidation. The division within the League about Sunday baseball, however, threatened hopes for a settlement. Presented with the question of whether League clubs were willing to play Sunday games in cities where allowed by authorities, there was an even split. Brooklyn, Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh (all of which were former Association cities) consented to Sunday baseball, with Boston, Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia opposed.\n\nFor their part, Association clubs in Philadelphia and Boston appeared ready to relent on achieving a one-team solution. Earle Wagner was willing to buy or sell out to the Phillies or complete a merger with his rivals.61 Boston\u2019s Prince was losing more money than he liked, and his employers were telling him he spent too much time on baseball. If his partners agreed, Prince was willing to sell out to the Triumvirs.62 If an amalgamation was truly at hand, that left the question of which clubs would be dropped. Speculation now focused on some combination of Columbus, Milwaukee, Louisville, and Washington. There also remained the issue of the new Association entry in Chicago, which had just approved architect John Addison\u2019s plans to construct grounds at a cost of $26,000.63\n\nDuring the Indianapolis conference, the magnates finalized an agreement on a 12-club consolidated league. With 17 clubs existing in the two leagues before the meeting, five required disposal. Milwaukee and Columbus indeed were dropped. The Brewers would have their franchise fee (paid upon joining the AA in August 1891) returned and additional costs in building a team for the 1892 season reimbursed, totaling approximately $10,000.64 Milwaukee was expected to rejoin the Western Association.\n\nVon der Ahe and Columbus officials were charged with agreeing on a price for the Solons, which was ultimately settled at $18,000.65 It was reported Prince was in the hole anywhere from $12,000 to $20,000 on his baseball ventures in Boston, and \u201chad all the annoyance that he could stand in the business.\u201d He reportedly held two-thirds of the stock in the Reds \u2014 178 out of 300 shares.66 The Triumvirs bought out the Boston Reds for $37,500. The Wagners received $50,000 for their franchise, with the Phillies contributing $25,000 of the payoff.67 For the trouble of selling out, George Wagner intended to take over Washington (which he did) and took Billy Barnie with him to serve as manager.\n\nChicago\u2019s Association club would never play a game, but its backers were to be returned the money spent launching the club, believed to be around $10,000.68 Williams was not mollified, blaming the Association\u2019s \u201ccon men\u201d and adding, \u201cWe are made the victims, and it is very shabby treatment from a crowd of men we supposed to be friends and partners.\u201d69 Von der Ahe adopted a different approach, stating that \u201cby the removal of the weak spots and a general cleaning out of both organizations, the union of the two is the best result that could be obtained.\u201d70 These events occurred during the Gilded Age, after all. For an estimated $130,000, baseball had a trust to call its own.71\n\nDespite the framework agreed in Indianapolis, questions lingered about the viability of certain clubs. First, the combined league appeared not to have shed all of the weak spots as Von der Ahe claimed. Although the Colonels survived the chop, there was \u201ca strong feeling against Louisville.\u201d72 Sentiment in certain League quarters favored admitting Buffalo ahead of Louisville. There were also doubts about Baltimore\u2019s competitiveness in the new circuit, and there was recognition that Washington required strengthening.73 Wagner intended to remedy the latter.\n\nAlso, as expected, Sunday baseball proved an issue. Thinking that clubs like St. Louis, Cincinnati, and Louisville required Sunday baseball as a matter of survival, there was movement toward allowing former Association (and particularly Western) clubs to continue playing on Sundays.74 The issue was whether Eastern clubs would be willing to play Sunday games during any Western road swings. Boston and New York were not. Before leaving Indianapolis, the magnates stated that Sunday baseball would be a local option.\n\nDevelopment of the structure for the National League and American Association of Base Ball Clubs\n\nThe Indianapolis meeting, which began with a general agreement on consolidation and contraction, morphed into an organizational meeting for formalizing the new structure. To complete the formalities, the Association appointed a committee of Von der Ahe, Von der Horst, and Elliott, and the League appointed a similar committee of Byrne, Brush, and Robison.\n\nOver December 17 and 18, the magnates formally established the \u201cNational League and American Association of Baseball Clubs\u201d and adopted its constitution, which included several elements of the St. Louis pre-merger conference. Young was named president, secretary, and treasurer of the new league (which was really an expanded National League rather than a merger of two leagues). Phelps lost his job, but received the compensation of being named one of two legal advisers to Young; Philadelphia\u2019s Rogers was the other.\n\nThe constitution provided for a 10-year period of existence, with the clubs bound together by the so-called ironclad provision that required unanimous consent to drop a fellow club. Otherwise, league membership could be terminated only upon resignation, failing to present a team at the start of the season, allowing the sale of pools at club grounds, and throwing games or permitting the throwing of games. Midseason vacancies, if they occurred, could be filled by a three-fourths vote. Clubs granted themselves territorial exclusivity for five miles beyond city limits and the ability to reserve up to 15 players each season.\n\nWith respect to admissions, gate receipts were to be divided evenly after 10 percent (later increased to 16 percent) was deducted for a league maintenance fund to pay for the costs of consolidation, and general-admission prices were set at 50 cents with special admission prices of 25 cents for some areas of the grounds.75 Home teams would be required to provide a dressing room for visiting clubs at their grounds, a change intended to address complaints from hotels refusing service to baseball clubs due to spikes tearing up carpets and players riding elevators in dirty clothes.76\n\nCommittees were appointed to address scheduling, players, rules, and a new national agreement. The drawing of lots determined the composition of the new board of directors, which led to a grouping of Brush, Von der Ahe, Hart, Von der Horst, Soden, and a Washington representative to be named later (who turned out to be Michael Scanlan).77 The scheduling committee was charged with submitting schedules of 132 and 154 games for consideration in March. The committee on players met in executive session before leaving Indianapolis to begin dealing with those who jumped leagues as well as those left without a club because of consolidation.\n\nOn December 18 at 10:30 A.M., the Association met to dissolve formally. After some minor business, at 11:10, Phelps asked if there was any further business. There was no response, but Von der Ahe wept and Barnie mournfully sighed. Phelps then said: \u201cI declare the American Base-Ball Association adjourned sine die.\u201d The meeting of the new NL/AA was adjourned that afternoon. By the following morning, all owners and representatives were gone, except a few who stayed to tie up loose ends. The editor of Sporting Life ended his report on the meeting with: \u201cAll\u2019s well that ends well.\u201d78\n\nVon der Ahe, perhaps the man whose name was most associated with the American Association, had this to say: \u201cI feel sorry that the Association fell through, and at the same time am glad that we see our way clear to make money for ourselves as well as the players. I am confident that the League end of the new body are acting in good faith, for there is no object nor reason for them to do otherwise.\u201d\n\nVon der Ahe talked a little on the settlement for the clubs left out, particularly Chicago: \u201cThe circumstances surrounding the deal are peculiarly unfortunate for Chicago, but there was no underhand work at all, and the necessities of the situation were such that, work it anyway you chose, you couldn\u2019t retire Mr. Williams without incurring his anger and humiliation. I admit that I may have made a number of mistakes in the preliminary work of closing out the retiring cities, but the errors were brought about through anxiety on my part to make harmony all around.\u201d79\n\nPlayer allocations\n\nIn the agreement players under contract on December 5 remained with the clubs with which they had signed. All contracts signed after this date were declared null and void. Each club submitted a list of 15 players under contract, or desired. The remaining players were to be placed in a pool and later assigned to teams by Young and Phelps, doing the best they could to equalize the strength of all teams. Previously signed players of the dropped clubs could not be held to their contracts. Once this was completed, it was felt (at least by Sporting Life) that the allotment of players \u201cwas made so judiciously that all clubs are placed on a fair fighting basis.\u201d80\n\nIn early January, Young and Phelps prepared a plan of allocation for players. The notable assignments included Pfeffer and Dahlen returned to Chicago, Harry Lyons to New York, Hugh Duffy to Boston, and Duke Farrell to Pittsburgh, and Danny Richardson would be joining Wagner in Washington.\n\nThe allocation plan annoyed many of the affected parties. Pittsburgh President William Temple received Farrell but was about to be asked to return John Grim to Louisville. He was not satisfied by the explanation that Pittsburgh received Farrell in order to facilitate Grim\u2019s move. Temple dropped his claim to Grim, but weighed legal action over Lyons.81 Temple argued that Lyons was improperly assigned, but the League Board tabled his claim in March, effectively ending the matter.82\n\nPfeffer refused to return to Chicago, asserting, \u201cI will not play under Anson another year, and my release is the only thing that will satisfy me.\u201d83 He also preferred to attend to business interests in Louisville.\n\nAlthough negotiations dragged on for months, the Colonels sent Jim Canavan and $1,000 to Chicago in April to secure Pfeffer. The Richardson case occupied the magnates for part of the March annual meeting. Signed originally by Wagner to play for the Athletics, Richardson was scheduled to join Wagner in Washington. Richardson now wanted to return to New York, and Day wanted him back. Richardson announced he would not play for the Senators for a million dollars, but Wagner declared, \u201cI will not let go of the man.\u201d84 New York attempted to reach a deal for Richardson before the start of the season, but failed. With the start of the season approaching, Richardson signed with Washington.\n\nFormulation of a new National Agreement\n\nAfter Indianapolis, as chair of the relevant committee, Rogers began preparing a draft National Agreement. In late January, without consulting his fellow committee members Young and Phelps, Rogers released his draft to much derision. Rogers claimed Brush pushed him to release the document and stated that his draft was intended to \u201cevoke amendments and modifications,\u201d but \u201cthe contents \u2026 are obnoxious to several elements in the big league as well as to all minor leagues.\u201d85\n\nOpposition centered around three issues: fees for drafting a minor-league player being too low, fees for receiving the protection of the Agreement being too high, and the lack of restrictions on midseason drafting.86 Minor-league clubs were concerned that their squads would be decimated by midseason procurement of their players by League clubs. Speaking for the Western League clubs, Kansas City\u2019s Speas said the new league would oppose the agreement. Hart and Robison informed Rogers of their opposition to the agreement, and Brush, who apparently instigated the draft\u2019s release, was also reported to be opposed.\n\nA drafting session on a new National Agreement was set for the March 1 League meeting. Phelps and Rogers presented different versions of prospective agreements, and a five-man committee led by Byrne was appointed to resolve matters. When presented for adoption the next day, the new agreement significantly reduced the amount of protection money from minor-league clubs, as Class-A league clubs (assumed to be the Western League and Eastern Association) would pay $150 each and Class-B league clubs (everyone else) would pay $75 each. Drafting would be allowed from October 1 to February 1, and the minor leagues would submit their reserve lists on or before October 10. League clubs would pay $1,000 for players drafted from Class-A clubs and $500 for players from Class-B teams. Organized Baseball had its governing document.\n\nMinor rules changes for the 1892 season\n\nAfter Indianapolis, the rules committee of Reach, Von der Horst, and Brush evaluated possible changes to the game on the field. Some proposals were more radical than others. The Sporting News reported that the rules committee would be asked to consider a proposal to remove the pitcher from the batting lineup. This was not a designated-hitter proposal before its time, but would have relied on the other eight players to handle the batting.87 Ultimately, the rules committee agreed on relatively minor changes.\n\nMaking its report during the League meeting on March 2, the committee proposed placing the players\u2019 benches 25 feet from the baseline; providing the umpire with discretion to declare a forfeit if teams engaged in \u201cdilatory practices\u201d to get a game called on account of rain or darkness; and declaring that the umpire is the \u201cabsolute judge of the plays\u201d and that only the captain may approach the umpire to seek an interpretation of the playing rules.88 Additionally, a batter would be entitled to only two bases if the ball cleared a fence less than 235 feet from home plate. Otherwise, the batter would be credited with a home run.\n\nFurther, a baserunner would be credited with a stolen base when he advanced more than one base on a single or infield out and when he advanced a base on a fair or foul fly out, \u201cprovided there is a possible chance and a palpable effort made to retire him.\u201d89 In another rule, that batter was to be called out if he attempted to hinder the catcher from catching or throwing the ball \u201cby stepping outside the lines of his position or otherwise obstructing or interfering with that player.\u201d A batter was to be allowed first base if \u201chis person or clothing\u201d was hit by a pitched ball \u201cexcepting hands or forearms, which makes it a dead ball.\u201d A baserunner was now declared out for hindering a fielder, and all runners had to return to the bases last held.90 The League approved these proposals.\n\nBy a vote of 10 to 2 (with Cleveland and Philadelphia in the minority), the League rejected a proposal to decrease the number of balls required for a walk from four to three.91 Young had forwarded to Reach a new point system for scoring victories that would have awarded between one and four points across a range of one- to eight-run wins.92 The proposal appeared not to have advanced beyond the rules committee.\n\nSchedule development\n\nThe schedule committee (Byrne, Hart, and Von der Ahe) dealt with two primary issues in devising the League\u2019s fixtures for 1892. The first issue concerned the length of the schedule. The committee was charged with presenting two scheduling models, with the 154-game schedule emerging as the preferred option. Some believed that increasing the length of the season could lead to a split schedule (which had been discussed in early December), with Chicago\u2019s Hart among the proponents.\n\nThe second issue related to Sunday baseball. In mid-January, Byrne stated that most clubs communicated their preferences regarding Sunday baseball. Comments ran the spectrum: Some wanted to play on Sundays, some would do so away from home, and others refused to play on Sunday at all. It was not clear whether the schedule would include Sunday games or whether clubs would have to agree mutually to move games to Sunday.\n\nThe scheduling committee met several times during February. Baltimore, Washington, St. Louis, Cincinnati, and Louisville, all cities with former Association ties, declared for Sunday baseball; Brooklyn and Pittsburgh backed off their earlier interest.93\n\nMeeting on March 1, the committee considered a draft schedule prepared by St. Louis\u2019s George Munson and Brooklyn\u2019s Charles Ebbets.94 With only minor changes as well as confirmation that preferred holiday dates were spread among clubs, the committee advanced the schedule for League adoption. There were few notable complaints beyond New York and Brooklyn\u2019s displeasure that their home dates conflicted 63 times. Accordingly, on March 3, the League adopted a schedule of 154 games divided into two distinct competitions. The first half would begin April 12 and conclude July 13, and the second half would run from July 15 through October 15, with the champions of each half to meet in a postseason series.\n\nThe 154-game schedule would be the longest in the League\u2019s history, but the slate was seen as appropriate for the era. \u201cIn this busy, bustling age of American ideas, push and energy, 154 games are not considered too many to play in one championship season.\u201d95\n\nThe magnates approached 1892 with a sense of optimism. Conflict from the previous two seasons appeared relegated to the past, and the League believed the foundation existed for a return to the heyday of the 1880s. \u201cSo, if 1892 is not the most successful and greatest base ball year the game has ever had, it will indeed be strange.\u201d96 By that standard, as events did not unfold as hoped, 1892 would prove \u201cstrange\u201d indeed.\n\nSources\n\nIn addition to the sources cited in the Notes, the author also consulted:\n\nAlexander, Charles C.

The AA admitted the Quakers as part of the \u201cpostwar settlement\u201d that ended the PL, and the Wagners\u2019 club adopted the Athletics name.

Born in 1861 and educated at four public schools and at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, Randolph played for the University in two matches against Oxford University in December 1889 and in March 1891, a match postponed three times from December due to fog.\n\nHis play for Cambridge, Blackheath and Kent was sufficiently impressive for the England selectors to choose him as their sole centre in a three-man back line for the internationals against Scotland and Ireland in March 1890. Both matches were won without a try being conceded, but these were to be his only England caps. His claim to fame would rest on his exploits for two invitation teams for which he played with particular distinction.\n\nOn 27 December 1890 he was selected to play in the first ever Barbarians rugby team against Hartlepool Rovers under the captaincy of Andrew Stoddart. He scored a try in that match and then played in the three remaining matches of the inaugural season of the Barbarians - a draw against Bradford, a 3-7 loss to a very strong Cardiff side packed with Welsh internationals, and a convincing 11-0 victory over Devonshire in which he also scored a try.\n\nThese were Randolph's only matches for the Barbarians, but his younger brother Fitzmaurice 'Ferdie' Aston born two years later in 1871 followed him as a three-quarter in playing for Blackheath and was picked for the Barbarians against Dublin University in December 1891. He played four more matches for the Barbarians before the end of the 1891-92 season after which he emigrated to South Africa where he and his elder brother established their long-lasting reputations.\n\nThe first pioneering tour by a combined British team to South Africa took place 130 years ago. Twenty one players were chosen to tour under the captaincy of the great Scottish three-quarter Bill Maclagan and the party included eight capped players, four each from England and Scotland including Randolph Aston. Ten of the 21 players had links with Cambridge University, so there was considerable rugby expertise within the overall group of players.\n\nThe 1891 tour comprised 20 matches and Randolph played in the centre of the three-quarter line in every match including the three test matches. He scored thirty tries, a record for a player in a touring team in South Africa unmatched to this day. Despite the extraordinary difficulties the tourists encountered in travelling around South Africa and their hectic social engagements between games, they won every match and conceded only one try during the tour. They left a huge legacy to the game of rugby in South Africa and Randolph Aston reached heights of true greatness.\n\nRL Aston\n\nHis opponent in the test series and future Springbok captain, Basil Heatlie said:\n\n\"Aston weighed over fifteen stone. He had a great reach and took his passes accurately from practically any angle or height. In fact, I remember seeing him pick up a pass at his toes as easily as most men would take one waist-high. He was the finest centre I have ever seen.\"\n\nIf Randolph's rugby career after returning from South Africa no longer reached the heights after he became a schoolmaster at Tonbridge School, his younger brother's career was taking shape.\n\nFerdie Aston emigrated to South Africa at the end of the 1892 season and he quickly made an impression in rugby circles. He played for Swifts rugby club in Queenstown and was picked for the Border province in their first Currie Cup side in 1893. He moved to Griqualand West for the 1894-95 season and captained the province in five matches towards the end of the season. He moved again at the end of the season to play for Wanderers rugby club in Johannesburg and was selected to play and captain Transvaal in 1896.\n\nRugby in South Africa had made enormous strides by the time the second British side toured in 1896. This was a stronger team with a substantial Irish contingent of players under the captaincy of the forward John Hammond, a tourist in 1891 and subsequently the manager of the 1903 touring team. They played 21 matches including four tests, the last of which brought South Africa their first victory in an international match.\n\nAs captain of Transvaal, Ferdie Aston was not only chosen to play for South Africa in the first test, he was also appointed captain. He led the Springboks in the first three tests and, although succeeded by Barry Heatlie as captain for the fourth and final test at Newlands, he remained in the side throughout the series, one of only two players to do so. His ferocious tackle of the Lions and England centre JF 'Fred' Byrne just before half-time in the final test directly led to the try by half back Alf Larard that gave the Springboks their 5-0 victory.\n\nHe also played three further matches against the Lions and Danie Craven described him as:\n\n\"A tall fellow, long in the leg, he had a natural swerve and sidestep. He probably made far more tries than he scored himself, being a born leader and a team man.\"\n\nLike many of his South African contemporaries, Ferdie's rugby career stalled due to the Boer War and, with no incoming tours, his international career ended in 1896 although he played on for Transvaal until 1898. He is known to have played rugby after the war ended, but his days as a top-level provincial and international player were over.\n\nThe Aston brothers hold a unique place in rugby history and it is fitting that their contribution to the development and growth of the game in South Africa has always been acknowledged.\n\nSources:"}, {"url": "http://www.englandfootballonline.com/Seas1872-00/1891-92/M0044Wal1892.html", "page_content": "This international association match took place at Wrexham on Saturday, in the presence of a great number of spectators. The weather was fine, and the ground in fair condition. Wales set the leather rolling, but Cotterill seized and brought it towards the goal, Powell saving in fine style, and giving the first of a series of proofs that Wales was stronger in the back division. Another try to lower England's colours was made, but Toone was too quick, and presently hands was given to Wales, when Cotterill seized the ball and put it across, and from this shot it was put through, and the first goal was scored for England. After the kick-off the ball was taken towards the English goal, but was soon got away. W. Owen and W. Lewis took a smart run down, but then failed to act together, and lost a good opportunity of scoring. Lewis made another effort to lower the enemy's flag, but a foul was the only result, and from this there came nothing. Schofield showed his nimbleness about this time, and tried to pass Powell, who resented the proposal, and checking the swift Stoke man, sent away the ball into safe quarters. From this time play was very general in character. The Welsh goal was visited, but Mills-Roberts proved very efficient, and when the compliment was returned Toone, when his services were required, proved true. Half-time was then called, leaving England with the only goal scored.\n\nResuming play W. Lewis made a fine run, and after it was replied Jenkins showed some capital play. Schofield, who received the ball from the backs, made a beautiful run down, but failed to gain anything. B. Lewis tried one of his runs, but he was not any more successful than Schofield, who tried again with the like result. The Welsh team made several lively attacks upon their opponents' citadel, which was in danger more than once. The play was lively for a short time, but presently it fell into its old styles, there was much running from end to end of the field, but neither side showed anything worth noting. Henfrey made a very fine shot, which did not score, and W. Lewis was fouled by Dunn in a dangerous attempt. Presently Henfrey shot in and scored.\n\n\n\nAt Wrexham, there was a numerous company to witness the match between these elevens...\n\nAt length Cotterill, who had previously run the ball close up to the posts, once more got in possession of it and registered the first goal for the visitors...\n\n...Henfrey then passed the ball to Gosling, who kicked it against one of the posts ; but Sandilands immediately afterwards sent it under the crossbar...\" - The Times, Monday, 7 March 1892\n\n\n\nEngland gained revenge for the previous year's Calcutta Cup defeat to beat Scotland 5-0 at Raeburn Place in Edinburgh and win the rugby union 'Triple Crown' without conceding a single point in the championship, a feat that has never been equalled.\n\n\n\nIt was on 5 March 1892 that the inquest into the Cleckheaton Chimney Disaster of the previous week was resumed. A 150-foot Yorkshire flannel manufacturer's mill chimney which had been visibly deteriorating was undergoing repairs when it collapsed onto the workplace, killing 15 people. The verdict, three weeks later, was that it was an accident, but the owners should not have let the chimney get into such a terrible state.\n\n"}, {"url": "http://englandfootballonline.com/Seas1872-00/1891-92/M0044Ire1892.html", "page_content": "morning, and put up at the Hotel Shaftesbury, and afterwards drove to Bangor in one or Mr. Braithwaites well-appointed four-horse brakes.\"\n\nMatch Report - Dublin Daily Express, Monday, 7 March 1892 In Other News..... Ireland again sustained defeat to-day in the eleventh international contest with England, which took place on the Cliftonville grounds, Belfast. The weather was most favourable, the ground was in excellent condition, and the match throughout was a splendid exposition of Association football. The English team was a very fine combination, and was said authoritatively to be the best that has ever done battle against Ireland. The Irish team was an excellent one, and played well throughout the match. The Irish captain winning the toss, Devey kicked off for England. The visitors at once started to press, Holt sending in some hot shots. The Irish team now put in some good work, M'Keown showing up well. S Torrans gave a splendid centre to Stanfield who shot hard, Rowley just saving, and no more, the ball going into touch. Clugston was called upon several times to save some of Daft's splendid shots. Peden, Ireland's principal forward, when on the ball got an ugly kick from Cox on the leg. The play was suspended, the injured player being carried off the field. A medical examination showed that Peden's ankle had sustained a severe twist. The referee decided to give a foul for the offence, but that was poor compensation for the loss of a first-rate forward. Play was resumed by Dalton, who had run the entire length of the field. The play for a time was very vigorous on either side, several capital shots being saved by Clugston. Athersmith, however, sending well across the goal mouth, Daft headed through, scoring first for England. No further scoring took place till half-time, when England was leading by 1 goal to nil. The second half was in a large measure a repetition of the first. Gaffikin got away in midfield, and tackling Holt passed to Stanfield, who dribbled up the field, until knocked over by Whitten. The English right wing raced down the field, and Athersmith cantering very swiftly across the goal mouth Daft caught the leather on the fly, and promptly scored the second goal for England. Clugston, whose play throughout was excellent, had to save several lightning shots by the English forwards. Holt got his leg injured by G Gaffikin, but no foul followed, as the injury was the result of an accident. No further scoring was made and the match ended in another victory for England.\n\n\n\n\"Many thousand spectators visited the Cliftonville Ground, Belfast, to witness the 11th annual match between England and Ireland...\n\nAt length, a little before the first half of time had elapsed, Athersmith muddled the ball to Daft, who butted it between the posts, thus securing the first goal for the visitors...\n\n...The English resumed their attacks, and Daft, who had the ball well passed to him, sent it under the cross-bar, thus registering the second goal...\" - The Times, Monday, 7 March 1892\n\nEngland gained revenge for the previous year's Calcutta Cup defeat to beat Scotland 5-0 at Raeburn Place in Edinburgh and win the rugby union 'Triple Crown' without conceding a single point in the championship, a feat that has never been equalled.\n\n\n\nIt was on 5 March 1892 that the inquest into the Cleckheaton Chimney Disaster of the previous week was resumed. A 150-foot Yorkshire flannel manufacturer's mill chimney which had been visibly deteriorating was undergoing repairs when it collapsed onto the workplace, killing 15 people. The verdict, three weeks later, was that it was an accident, but the owners should not have let the chimney get into such a terrible state.\n\nDomestic Football Results (5 March 1892) Teams in a silver box denotes a player representing England Football Association Challenge Cup Semi-final replay:\n\nNottingham Forest 1\n\nWest Bromwich Albion 1\n\nMolineux Ground, Wolverhampton (15,930)\n\nH iggins ~ Bassett Forest had Albert Smith and Tinsley Lindley in their line-up.

All remaining games were played on Saturdays, apart from one on a Tuesday in March, six on Mondays in April (including three on Easter Monday) and three on Good Friday. The FA Cup took precedence on Saturdays from the first round on 16 January 1892 to the final on 19 March 1892. Rounds were played each fortnight with replays on the Saturday in-between, and a semi-final second replay on a Wednesday, with a spare third week before the final. The last league game was played on Saturday, 30 April 1892 (Burnley 1-2 Sunderland).

In 1894 teams began to play with five on a side when the playing area was less than 1,800 square feet (167.2 square metres); the number rose to seven when the gymnasium measured from 1,800 to 3,600 square feet (334.5 square metres) and up to nine when the playing area exceeded that. In 1895 the number was occasionally set at five by mutual consent; the rules stipulated five players two years later, and this number has remained ever since.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nSince Naismith and five of his original players were Canadians, it is not surprising that Canada was the first country outside the United States to play the game. Basketball was introduced in France in 1893, in England in 1894, in Australia, China, and India soon thereafter, and in Japan in 1900.\n\nWhile basketball helped swell the membership of YMCAs because of the availability of their gyms, within five years the game was outlawed by various associations because gyms that had been occupied by classes of 50 or 60 members were now monopolized by only 10 to 18 players. The banishment of the game induced many members to terminate their YMCA membership and to hire halls to play the game, thus paving the way to the professionalization of the sport.\n\nOriginally, players wore one of three styles of uniforms: knee-length football trousers; jersey tights, as commonly worn by wrestlers; or short padded pants, forerunners of today\u2019s uniforms, plus knee guards. The courts often were of irregular shape with occasional obstructions such as pillars, stairways, or offices that interfered with play. In 1903 it was ruled that all boundary lines must be straight. In 1893 the Narragansett Machinery Co. of Providence, Rhode Island, marketed a hoop of iron with a hammock style of basket. Originally a ladder, then a pole, and finally a chain fastened to the bottom of the net was used to retrieve a ball after a goal had been scored. Nets open at the bottom were adopted in 1912\u201313. In 1895\u201396 the points for making a basket (goal, or field goal) were reduced from three to two, and the points for making a free throw (shot uncontested from a line in front of the basket after a foul had been committed) were reduced from three to one.\n\nBaskets were frequently attached to balconies, making it easy for spectators behind a basket to lean over the railings and deflect the ball to favour one side and hinder the other; in 1895 teams were urged to provide a 4-by-6-foot (1.2-by-1.8-metre) screen for the purpose of eliminating interference. Soon after, wooden backboards proved more suitable. Glass backboards were legalized by the professionals in 1908\u201309 and by colleges in 1909\u201310. In 1920\u201321 the backboards were moved 2 feet (0.6 metre), and in 1939\u201340 4 feet, in from the end lines to reduce frequent stepping out-of-bounds. Fan-shaped backboards were made legal in 1940\u201341.\n\nA soccer ball (football) was used for the first two years. In 1894 the first basketball was marketed. It was laced, measured close to 32 inches (81 cm), or about 4 inches (10 cm) larger than the soccer ball, in circumference, and weighed less than 20 ounces (567 grams). By 1948\u201349, when the laceless molded ball was made official, the size had been set at 30 inches (76 cm).\n\nThe first college to play the game was either Geneva College (Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania) or the University of Iowa. C.O. Bemis heard about the new sport at Springfield and tried it out with his students at Geneva in 1892. At Iowa, H.F. Kallenberg, who had attended Springfield in 1890, wrote Naismith for a copy of the rules and also presented the game to his students. At Springfield, Kallenberg met Amos Alonzo Stagg, who became athletic director at the new University of Chicago in 1892. The first college basketball game with five on a side was played between the University of Chicago and the University of Iowa in Iowa City on January 18, 1896. The University of Chicago won, 15\u201312, with neither team using a substitute. Kallenberg refereed that game\u2014a common practice in that era\u2014and some of the spectators took exception to some of his decisions.\n\nThe colleges formed their own rules committee in 1905, and by 1913 there were at least five sets of rules: collegiate, YMCA\u2013Amateur Athletic Union, those used by state militia groups, and two varieties of professional rules. Teams often agreed to play under a different set for each half of a game. To establish some measure of uniformity, the colleges, Amateur Athletic Union, and YMCA formed the Joint Rules Committee in 1915. This group was renamed the National Basketball Committee (NBC) of the United States and Canada in 1936 and until 1979 served as the game\u2019s sole amateur rule-making body. In that year, however, the colleges broke away to form their own rules committee, and during the same year the National Federation of State High School Associations likewise assumed the task of establishing separate playing rules for the high schools. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Rules Committee for men is a 12-member board representing all three NCAA divisions. It has six members from Division I schools and three each from Divisions II and III. It has jurisdiction over colleges, junior colleges, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), and Armed Forces basketball. There is a similar body for women\u2019s play."}, {"url": "https://hampshirechesshistory.co.uk/hampshire-county-matches-1891-92/", "page_content": "The Hampshire County Chess scene picked up steam with four matches in the 1891 \u2013 92 season. After only playing Sussex previously two new opponents were met, Surrey and Wiltshire. The Wiltshire match turned into an annual event up to the 1st World War and always seemed to have been held in Salisbury. Hampshire shared wins against Surrey and won both their matches against Sussex and Wiltshire.\n\nFor the record of Hampshire County matches and links to any articles I have written the table on the Hampshire County Chess Matches page will detail these. The Hampshire County Chess History page summaries the leagues Hampshire have played in and the successes Hampshire have achieved. Both of these are available from the menu at the top of the site as well.\n\nHampshire \u2013 Surrey 28 Nov 1891 \u2013 Woking\n\nThis match may actually sit better in the 1890 \u2013 1891 season but as I am sticking to the format we use currently I have left in the 1891 \u2013 1892 one. It would seem Joseph Blake was known as a very strong player as the report in the Blandford Weekly News stated that his defeat was the surprise of the match.\n\nFrank Elwell had played on board seven and four in the two matches against Sussex earlier in the year. For this match he was on board three thus showing his improving strength. He would soon move to board two where he would remain for the majority of this county career. He played on board one when JH Blake when did not play and board three when Sir George Thomas, WH Winter, CHOD Alexander or WJ Fry played (towards the end of his playing career) were in the team.\n\nThe match was very close, but Surrey won by the smallest of margins.\n\nCOUNTY CHESS MATCH. HAMPSHIRE v. SURREY. A match between twenty representative players of these counties was played at Woking on Saturday. The bulk of the games were started at 4 p.m., and resulted in a win for Surrey by one game. The surprise of the evening was the defeat of Mr JH Blake (Southampton) by Mr HS Ward.

Playing these matches at home for any County is a large advantage, probably even more so in 1892 than now. This was certainly the view from Sussex\u2019s\u2019 point of view as reported in the Croydon Observer. Although going to the point of stating the missing players is probably stretching the point a bit too much!\n\nPortsmouth was on Saturday last the scene of an encounter between Hampshire and Sussex, with 23 players aside, the unexpected result being that the former county gained a decisive victory by 15\u00bd games to 7\u00bd. One naturally looks for some explanation of a victory that not even a Hampshire enthusiast could say properly represented the true relative strengths of the two counties, and a glance at the composition of the Sussex team throws considerable light upon the matter.\n\n\n\nNot one player the portion of the county east of Brighton, except Mr J Chandler, of Lewes, took part in the contest, and as this means that Messrs Cheshire, Womersley, Colborne. Hall, and Elsden, of Hastings, Mr WT Pierre of East Grinstead, and Rey HA Adams, of Eastbourne, together with Mews, AA Bowley, W Mead, R Lucas, and L Leuliette of Brighton were not in the team while Hampshire were even more strongly represented than against Surrey in the recent match at Woking.\n\n\n\nWe think the great difference in the scores is explained. The two \u201cgiants,\u201d Messrs Blake and Wilson drew once more, but Mr Butler defeated Mr Elwell who is looked upon as the second champion of his county. We think this match is an apt illustration of the necessity of playing all county matches midway between the rival centres, otherwise the chances seem to heavily against the visiting county, that the match is practically decided when the locale is agreed upon. Croydon Observer \u2013 Friday 22 January 1892\n\nThe view from the Southern Echo did not stress this point, but mentioned that both sides were without some of their strongest players. As usual it is interesting to see the reporting from both sides, but I agree that a venue in the middle would be more suitable. Although one of the reasons Hampshire left the SCCU 90 years later was due to the majority of the matches having to be played in London.\n\nINTER-COUNTY CHESS MATCH HAMPSHIRE v. SUSSEX. This important county contest took place on Saturday at the rooms of the Portsmouth Chess Club. Hampshire was again victorious, winning 13 games and drawing 5, thus scoring 15\u00bd to their opponents\u2019 7\u00bd. Both sides played without some of their best men; the prevailing sickness and bad weather accounting for many absentees.\n\n\n\nThe second half of the Hampshire team scored remarkably well; the players from the Isle of Wight and Bournemouth did not lose a game. Matches are to be played by the Hants Club in the spring against Wiltshire at Salisbury, and against Surrey at Winchester. Southern Echo \u2013 Monday 18 January 1892\n\nThe player\u2019s clubs were detailed in the Newspaper, and from the Hampshire side Portsmouth and Southampton had the largest representatives, but the Isle of Wight had three players (being held in Portsmouth would have helped their participation). For Sussex Brighton had ten players and Petworth four.\n\nBoard Hampshire Club Hants Result Sussex Club Sussex Result 1 JH Blake Southampton \u00bd WV Wilson Brighton \u00bd 2 FJH Elwell Southampton 0 HW Butler Brighton 1 3 T Crassweller Portsmouth 1 WR Andrews Brighton 0 4 EL Raymond Portsmouth 1 Oxley Brighton 0 5 Dr H de Fonmartin Portsmouth \u00bd JW Bridger Petworth \u00bd 6 WC Kenny Southampton 1 J Chandler Lewes 0 7 E Clayton Portsmouth 1 W Bridger Petworth 0 8 WH Curtis Bournemouth 1 Field Brighton 0 9 A Asher Southampton 0 Schlesinger Brighton 1 10 HD Osborn Ryde \u00bd Redman Horsham \u00bd 11 W Bowyer Southampton \u00bd Rev E I Crosse Henfield \u00bd 12 J Fewings Southampton 1 CJA Wade 0 13 S Solomons Havant 0 Revd WH Cooper Copthorne 1 14 PT Balshaw Portsmouth \u00bd J Dewdney Portslade \u00bd 15 EP Westlake Southampton 1 H Nash Horsham 0 16 Piercy Bournemouth 1 JP Morris Brighton 0 17 Taylor Jnr Southampton 1 Penfold Steyning 0 18 P Larminie Portsmouth 1 Lippart Petworth 0 19 AW Wheatstone Portsmouth 1 P Arnold Petworth 0 20 W Brock Bishop\u2019s Waltham 0 H Cooper Copthorne 1 21 FA Joyce Newport 1 Duff Barnett Brighton 0 22 JS Flower Ryde 1 Shaw Brighton 0 23 Dr Pearse Portsmouth 0 J Kirke Brighton 1 Total 15\u00bd Total 7\u00bd\n\nHampshire v Wiltshire \u2013 6 Apr 1892 \u2013 Salisbury\n\nThe next match was against Wiltshire and this would turn into an annual friendly match until the start of the first World War. Interestingly this reverted back to the first matches where if time allowed two games were played and both counted for the final result. As this tended to be more prevalent on the lower boards this put more emphasise of having a strong lower half of the team.\n\nHampshire did win the match 16\u00bd \u2013 12\u00bd despite defaulting two boards (and three games in total) and Wiltshire scoring 6 points from the bottom 9 results. The Western Gazette had an excellent match result. Also of note was that the match was played at the Red Lion hotel in Salisbury, this hotel celebrated its 800th birthday in 2000 making it Europe\u2019s oldest purpose built hotel.\n\nCHESS MATCH. WILTSHIRE VERSUS HAMPSHIRE. Under the auspices of the County Chess Association Wiltshire and Hampshire, a match took place the Red Lion Hotel, Salisbury, on Wednesday, between twenty one selected players from each county. Two of the Hampshire players failed to put in an appearance. On the whole the games were well contested, the visitors gaining well-earned victory.\n\n\n\nThe games were played in the large dining-room of the hotel, the arrangements of Mr Wilkes, the proprietor, meeting with the approval of both contestants and the few outsiders present who witnessed the games. Play commenced shortly before three o\u2019clock, and terminated at six and resulted as follows: Wiltshire 12\u00bd Hampshire, 16\u00bd. Before separating, Mr HJ King president of the Wiltshire Association, proposed \u201cThe health of the visiting players, and congratulated them upon their victory. That was the first match between the two Associations but hoped it would become an annual one, and that on the next occasion Wiltshire would turn the tables upon their opponents\u201d.\n\n\n\nMr. Chipperfield (Southampton), as president the Hampshire Association, in responding, said he echoed the wish of Mr. King that the tables on the next occasion might be turned, the Wiltshire men he wished \u201cmore strength to their elbow.\u201d Several of the visitors left by the evening train, but others remained and spent a pleasant night in the city. The members of the Wiltshire Association, including these of the Salisbury Chess Club in particular, are to be congratulated the consummation of so successful and pleasant a gathering. Western Gazette \u2013 Friday 08 April 1892\n\nAnother longer report was in the Salisbury Times was fascinating, especially on the games claimed by default, the captains, the normal points on the weakness of the local team and the mediocre! ability of the Hampshire tail. I think claiming the second game of Miss Rooper by default was a little harsh, as not all players played two games!\n\nDespite some of the players being able to fit two games in there were a number of games (mainly by the stronger players) which had to be adjudicated. This included the top two boards (which only played the one game) and these were adjudicated by the players from the other top board i.e. board one players adjudicated the board two game and vice versa.\n\nAn interesting Chess Match took place at the Red Lion Hotel, Salisbury, on Wednesday afternoon, between teams arranged by the Wiltshire Chess Association and the Hampshire Chess Association. This was the first time those two counties have met to try their strength, although it has always been thought that Hampshire could produce a stronger team than Wiltshire.\n\n\n\nSalisbury was fixed upon as the locale for the game as being the most convenient centre for the players from both counties. The arrangements were made by Mr. A. Scbomberg, of Trowbridge, Hon. Sec. of the Wiltshire Association, assisted by Mr. CJ Woodrow, Hon. Sec. of the Salisbury Chess Club. Originally it was intended to play twenty each side; but on the arrival of some of the Hampshire players it was stated that their team would consist of twenty-one. Wiltshire, therefore, agreed to increase their number by one, and the play was arranged accordingly.\n\n\n\nTwo of the Hampshire team Mr F Budden, of Bournemouth, and Mr. WH Curtis, of Bournemouth did not put in an appearance, so that Mr CJ Woodrow of Salisbury, the Rev SJ Buchanan, of Salisbury, who were to have been respectively pitted against them, claimed and were allowed one game each, making two for Wiltshire default The Rev CJ F Welsh of Warminster, captained the Wiltshire team, and Mr JH Blake of Southampton, player of considerable reputation, was captain of the visitors.\n\n\n\nThe Wiltshire team was unusually weak, several of the best players from different parts of the county being unable to attend. The tail end of Hampshire also included several players of only mediocre ability. Play began at three o\u2019clock. It was agreed to conclude at six o\u2019clock and that no second game I should be commenced after five o\u2019clock.\n\n\n\nNineteen players each side, arranged in order of their merit, settled down to play shortly after three; Mr. Welsh was matched against Mr. Blake and some clever play was expected. The President of the Wiltshire Association (M HJ King, of Wilton) had as his opponent Mr FH Elwell, of Southampton, a gentleman who is a smart player, especially when it is borne in mind that he is very young man.\n\n\n\nIt was noticed that there was one lady player, Miss Rooper, of Bournemouth, who was opposed Mr W Gibbs, of Warminster. Silence having been strictly enjoined, the match went on quietly until shortly after four when the first report was given one to Hampshire. Mr Trantrum having won game against Mr Parker. Three games then fell in succession to the home team and at half-past four the score was Wiltshire three, Hampshire one. Miss Rooper played well the first part the game and made some brilliant attacks, being repulsed and Mr Gibbs assuming the aggressive, it was found that her defence was weak, and she soon succumbed, and left without embarking on the second game.\n\n\n\nAt five o\u2019clock Hampshire was leading, the visitors having gained five games against Wiltshire\u2019s four. A stubbornly-fought game between Mr Sargent and Mr Leonard was drawn, and the adjudicators declared the second game, which was unfinished at six o\u2019clock, a draw. Just before five o\u2019clock Mr. Hammick and Mr. Martin\u2019s game ended a draw, and those players began the second game a few minutes before the hour. The second game like the first was drawn. Retrieving his defeat on the first game, Mr Parker won his second by queening a pawn.\n\n\n\nAt twenty minutes after five the score stood Hampshire seven, Wiltshire six. The two games claimed by default were now entered on the card, and the revised report was Wiltshire eight Hampshire seven. Mr. Wheatstone beating Mr. Gregory equalised the score making it eight against eight. A drawn game followed, leaving the teams still equal.\n\n\n\nSeveral players having finished their first games too late to begin the second interest was concentrated in the games at the top of the table. Mr Blake, who had the move, several times attacked with his queen on black\u2019s king\u2019s side but by careful play he was again and again compelled to retire. In point of pieces the players at this stage of the game, about, half-past five, were equal, and without a fluke, draw seemed inevitable. The most exciting game was that at number two table between Mr. King and Mr. Elwell, where good play had been shown on both sides. The latter had a piece to the good, but his opponent had the advantage of several strongly, placed pawns with a good chance of queening one of them. At six o\u2019clock Mr. King had four pawns against a bishop and a single pawn. Mr. Blake and Mr. Welsh judged the second table game, and after some discussion the former agreed with the Wiltshire Captain that Mr. King was bound to queen one of his pawns and thus win the game, a decision which gave satisfaction to both sides. The game was therefore scored to Wiltshire.\n\n\n\nMr King and Mr Elwell adjudicated upon the game between Mr Welsh and Mr Blake, and gave it as a draw. The unfinished game between Rev CC Clarke and Mr GR Sloper, was awarded to the latter, and Mr Asher\u2019s against Mr Cooke was given in favour of the visitors. Wiltshire claimed and was allowed another game by default in consequence of the lady not playing her second game. Soon after six the result was declared to be as follows : Salisbury Times \u2013 Friday 08 April 1892\n\nBoard Hampshire Team Hants Result Wiltshire Team Wiltshire Result 1 JH Blake Southampton \u00bd Revd CJF Welsh Warminster \u00bd 2 FJH Elwell Southampton 0 HJ King Wilton 1 3 F Budden (def) Bournemouth 0 CJ Woodrow Salisbury 1 4 WC Kenny Southampton 1 A Schomberg Trowbridge 0 5a GR Sloper Southampton 1 Revd CC Clarke Salisbury 0 5b GR Sloper Southampton 1 Revd CC Clarke Salisbury 0 6 WH Curtis (def) Bournemouth 0 Revd SJ Buchanan Salisbury 1 7 A Thompson Bournemouth 0 Revd AB Thynee Trowbridge 1 8a W Bowyer Southampton 1 Revd WH Cooper Chippenham 0 8b W Bowyer Southampton \u00bd Revd WH Cooper Chippenham \u00bd 9 A Asher Southampton 1 O Cooke Wilton 0 10 R Chipperfield Southampton 1 F Sutton Salisbury 0 11 WB George Romsey 1 WH Jackson Salisbury 0 12a P Larminie Portsmouth 1 W Bruges Trowbridge 0 12b P Larminie Portsmouth \u00bd W Bruges Trowbridge \u00bd 13a Leonard Bournemouth \u00bd J Sargent Salisbury \u00bd 13b Leonard Bournemouth \u00bd J Sargent Salisbury \u00bd 14 W Brock Bishop\u2019s Waltham 1 Dr Hinton Warminster 0 15 AW Wheatstone Portsmouth 1 A Gregory Trowbridge 0 16 FA Joyce Isle of Wight 1 Dr HJ Manning Salisbury 0 17a Revd D Scott Bournemouth 0 HB Gummer Salisbury 1 17b Revd D Scott Bournemouth 0 HB Gummer Salisbury 1 18a Miss Rooper Bournemouth 0 W Gibbs Warminster 1 18b Miss Rooper (def) Bournemouth 0 W Gibbs Warminster 1 19 P Cummins Portsmouth 1 T Brinsmead Salisbury 0 20a F Martin Portsmouth \u00bd WM Hammick Salisbury \u00bd 20b F Martin Portsmouth \u00bd WM Hammick Salisbury \u00bd 21a Trantrum Bournemouth 1 L Parker Salisbury 0 21b Trantrum Bournemouth 0 L Parker Salisbury 1 Total 16\u00bd Total 12\u00bd\n\nThe Salisbury Times published the board two game, which was correctly adjudicated as a win for Wiltshire.

This time Hampshire were comfortable winners 12 \u2013 7, playing in Winchester rather than Woking helped the home team. The Hampshire team were not notably stronger that the previous match but Surrey having to travel to Winchester were not able to field their best team.\n\nOne strange change for Surrey was that HS Ward played on board fifteen rather than the board one he played on in the first match! Again the match report in the Croydon Observer was critical of the location, as this stopped them fielding their strongest team. Some other highlights from the report was that on board one a headache was the main reason for the Surrey loss and that the Philidor was an obsolete opening even in 1892! Although the result of this game was a draw. The Croydon Observer Chess reports are certainly interesting reading.\n\nOn Saturday last a team of Surrey players journeyed to Winchester to meet the representatives of Hampshire in a friendly match. In spite of the distance from town, the Surrey team was fairly strong, including as it did Messrs H Jacobs, Vyne, Taylor, Mollard, and Sargent, while Mr Ward-Higgs of \u201cCity of London\u201d renown appeared for the first time for his county, and if only such regular players as Messrs B. McLeod, Keliher, Rees, and Braund had been able to join in the match, Surrey would, no doubt, have been able to claim the victory.\n\n\n\nThe Hampshire team was about the same as usual, the only changes being on the last four or five boards. It was regrettable that the train was late at Winchester, as it so shortened the time for play that no less than eight games out of the twenty-one had to be submitted to a hurried adjudication.\n\n\n\nIn two of these eight games, namely, in those between Messrs Jacobs and Blake, and Messrs Ward-Hiiggs and Elwell, no decision was arrived at, the positions being therefore sent to a professional. Of the other six, four were given as wins for Hampshire, and two as drawn. At the present moment it will be seen that the score is ten games to nine in favour of Hampshire, and as Surrey only claims draws in the two undecided games the result of the match will certainly be a victory in favour of Hampshire although the score is not settled. (It seems these went Hampshire\u2019s way, as the final score was 12 \u2013 9 \u2013 webmaster.)\n\n\n\nTurning to the individual games, on Board 1 Mr Blake played a Roy Lopez against Mr Herbert Jacobs, who selected a Mortimer\u2019s Defence. Mr Jacobs did not play up to his usual form, evidently suffering from a severe headache, and in the position left for the professional to adjudicate he is the exchange behind, although there are certain compensations, which make a definite decision difficult.\n\n\n\nOn Board 2 Mr 1 Vyne met his old opponent, Lieutenant Chepnell, and by playing the Ruy Lopez succeeded in reversing the verdict of the home match at Woking Mr Ward-Higgs had also to meet the Ruy Lopez and a most determined game ensued, the Surrey player being a Pawn behind at adjudication time.\n\n\n\nMr Raymond tried the obsolete Philidor against Mr Taylor, and after some interesting play a draw resulted. On Board 5 Mr Bollard encountered a Ruy Lopez played by Mr Crasweller, and when Messrs Blake and Jacobs came to adjudicate they found the Surrey cup-holder a Pawn in arrears and awarded the game to his opponent a decision to which Mr Mollard greatly demurred. Messrs Sargent and Eklund had for once to submit to an adverse decision of the adjudicators, and it is not until we get to Mr Marfleet on Board 10 that Surrey really began to hold her own. Messrs Dufreane, H Hill, and Barton played rapidly and brilliantly, while Mr Harold Jacobs. after losing considerable ground, achieved an ingenious draw.\n\n\n\nConsidering the wearying railway journey, and the fact of playing off their own ground, Surrey are to be congratulated upon making so good a score against such a powerful team as Hampshire can now put in the field, and we trust that the time will come when matches played mid-way will equalize these disadvantages.

The Hampshire players that stood out were:\n\nWC Kenny played four games on boards 4, 6 and 7 and only dropped half a points. Southampton Chess Clubs WC Kenny would play for Hampshire more than 50 times until 1913, normally on the top five boards.\n\nAW Wheatstone won his three games on the lower boards\n\nGR Sloper won three games and lost one, although two of his wins were in the Wiltshire match\n\nP Larminie won two games and drew one\n\nAlthough some players would not be regular Hampshire players, the season contained a number of players who would be the mainstay of the Hampshire team for a long time. As well as the expected JH Blake and FJH Elwell (age 22) this included FA Joyce, WC Kenny, GR Sloper and T Crassweller among others.\n\nOne final point, it was not a good season for the Hampshire Revd\u2019s \u2013 as they failed to score a point from their three games. The Revd\u2019s for the opposition did far better scoring 50%.\n\nHants Player Win Percentage Points Scored Games Played WC Kenny 87.5% 3.5 4 AW Wheatstone 100.0% 3 3 GR Sloper 75.0% 3 4 P Larminie 83.3% 2.5 3 FA Joyce 62.5% 2.5 4 W Bowyer 62.5% 2.5 4 JS Flower 100.0% 2 2 T Crassweller 100.0% 2 2 FJH Elwell 50.0% 2 4 JH Blake 50.0% 2 4 W Brock 50.0% 2 4 Dr H de Fonmartin 75.0% 1.5 2 EL Raymond 75.0% 1.5 2 HD Osborn 75.0% 1.5 2 A Asher 50.0% 1.5 3 E Clayton 50.0% 1.5 3 R Chipperfield 50.0% 1.5 3 S Solomons 50.0% 1.5 3 EP Westlake 100.0% 1 1 J Fewings 100.0% 1 1 Mahoney 100.0% 1 1 P Cummins 100.0% 1 1 Piercy 100.0% 1 1 PJ Dancer 100.0% 1 1 Taylor Jnr 100.0% 1 1 TW Rebbeck 100.0% 1 1 F Martin 50.0% 1 2 Leonard 50.0% 1 2 Lieut CH Chepmell 50.0% 1 2 PT Balshaw 50.0% 1 2 Trantrum 50.0% 1 2 WB George 33.3% 1 3 WH Curtis 33.3% 1 3 A Thomson 50.0% 0.5 1 Dr De Von Martin 50.0% 0.5 1 F Budden 0.0% 0 2 Miss Rooper 0.0% 0 2 Revd D Scott 0.0% 0 2 A Thompson 0.0% 0 1 Dr Pearse 0.0% 0 1 GH Piercy 0.0% 0 1 H Larmehae 0.0% 0 1 Revd E Wells 0.0% 0 1\n\nSummary\n\nThere was some close attention being paid to the matches in the English Southern Counties and the following summary in May 1892 was published in the unlikely Sussex Agricultural Express of the five counties which had played matches. This is only a rough estimate of the playing strength and performance of the Counties and as stated previously if you were playing at home this was a big advantage.\n\nThat said, it does look that Hampshire were performing the best of all the counties, as even their one loss was only by one point.\n\n1892 County Matches Summary \u2013 Sussex Agricultural Express\n\nGallery\n\nClick on the pictures to open in full screen.\n\nHants v Surrey Nov 1891 Blandford Weekly News \u2013 Thursday 03 December 1891 Hampshire v Sussex 16 Jan 1892 \u2013 Southern Echo \u2013 Monday 18 January 1892\n\nAcknowledgements and Sources"}, {"url": "https://www.bathrugbyheritage.org/content/heritage-topics/match-reports/1891-1892", "page_content": "1891-1892\n\n26/9/1891\n\nTRIAL MATCH held on Kensington Meadows.\n\nThe opposing XV\u2019s were designated Backs v Forwards.\n\nBacks:- Crouch (Back), W Pattinson, G L Strachan, B H Vincent, E C Rogerson (three-quarter-backs),\n\nM W Dixon and W R Mackay (half-backs), W Dawson, G Bryar, W A Coles, W Smith, F J Batt and W Marsden.\n\nForwards:- A D Ford (back), R A Dobbin, P A Dykes, H Luckman (three-quarter backs), G G Vincent and\n\nH Hancock (half-backs), F Soane (Captain), F Derrick, G Hardcastle, A Waller, R T Dykes, Thompson and\n\nC H Melsome (forwards)\n\nBoth teams looked a little rusty and it was Melsome, an \u2018Association\u2019 man, who scored the first try of the season\n\nThe \u2018Backs\u2019 won by two goals and two tries (14) to four tries and one penalty goal (11). Soane, Pattinson, Dixon, the Vincents, Hancock, Thompson and Mackay were prominent.\n\n3/10/1891\n\nv Taunton, Home. Won 10-2. Team:- A D Ford (back), G L Strachan, W Pattinson, T C Rogerson (three-quarter backs), W R Mackay and M W Dixon (half-backs), W E Thompson, B H Vincent, F Derrick,\n\nW A Coles, F Soane, V Soane, C Banks, F China, and E C Rogerson (forwards).\n\nPlay was an hour late due to trains delay. \u201cBath kicked off, and it was not long before Pattinson showed himself to be in his old form, and put in some useful runs. Following up one of these, G.G. Vincent took the ball close up to the Taunton goal line in the far corner, and Soane, always on the alert, rushed the ball over and falling upon it secured the first try. It appeared to be almost impossible to obtain a goal, but Vincent succeeded in putting the oval neatly over the cross bar, and the five points were registered amid loud applause. Strachan, Vincent, and Pattinson put in some conspicuous work, and Dixon, who played a magnificent game throughout, was always where he was wanted, and by smartly passing the ball to the three-quarter backs when it rolled out of the scrums rendered valuable aid. Erratic passing and mistakes on the part of Banks compelled the home club to touch down twice in self defence, and shortly afterwards the visitors also had to save. Just before half time a rush by Taunton forwards resulted in a try being obtained by Fowler, but Haslam\u2019s kick proved a failure. Soon after resuming Taunton secured a place for offside and though a penalty goal looked inevitable the kick did not score. Close forward play near the touchline on the river side occupied considerable time and once or twice the visitors were dangerously near getting in. Pattinson, however, got away with a dashing run and the leather was taken into the Taunton 25. Here Vincent got possession and obtained a try which he converted into a goal. Nothing further was scored and Bath won a capital match by ten points to two. Of the Bath team F Soane, Vincent, Rogerson and China, were most conspicuous amongst the forwards, Dixon and Mackay were sure half-backs, the former as we have mentioned before being invaluable. Of the three-quarters Pattinson and Strachan were the best though Rogerson did well; Banks is hardly fitted for the position. Ford proved a fairly good full back.\u201d\n\n17/10/1891\n\nv Clifton (Oakfield), Home. Won 11-0. (1 goal and 3 tries to nil). Team:- A D Ford, D G Astley,\n\nG L Strachan, W Pattinson, P A Dykes, M W Dixon, W R Mackay, F Soane, V Soane, E C Rogerson, R Dykes,\n\nW C Thompson, F China, L Loy and B I Vincent. A capital game despite the slippery ground conditions.\n\nStrachan obtained an early try, followed by Frank Soane after a forward dribble. (Bath 4 \u20130 at half time)\n\nIn the second half Strachan ran in from 50 yards for a converted try, followed by Vincent. Clifton rallied towards the close, but: \u201cthe Bath backs were too well on the alert\u2026\u201d\n\n24/10/1891\n\nv Cardiff (2nd XV), Away. Lost 5-16. Team:- A D Ford, W Pattinson, P A Dykes, G L Strachan,\n\nM W Dixon, W R Mackay, F Soane, E C Rogerson, B H Vincent, D G Astley, J W Hooper, F Derrick, W A Coles, W E Thompson and L Loy. Cardiff won by two goals and three tries to one goal. The Cardiff ground was in very bad condition, with some areas under water. In the heavy conditions, Bath were at some disadvantage against lighter and more skilful opponents. Cardiff scored three tries in the first 25 minutes, but Bath rallied and contained play in the home quarter. From the restart, Bath managed to hold the lively Cardiff outfit, until they got around full-back Ford for a converted try. Shortly afterwards, Pattinson picked up smartly and with a fine run, secured a try for Bath, for Vincent to convert. Cardiff scored another second-half goal.\n\nSoane, Vincent and Coles were outstanding in the forwards, and Pattinson was Bath\u2019s best back.\n\n31/10/1891\n\nv Swindon Rangers, Home. Won 20-0. (Two goals, five tries). Team:- A D Ford, W Pattinson,\n\nW R Mackay, G L Strachan, F A Dykes, J Miller, G G Vincent, F Soane, J Timmins, L Loy, F China, J W Hooper, F A Coles, E C Rogerson, and B H Vincent. Tries by Vincent, Pattinson (2), Strachan, Mackay, Dykes and Rogerson. Swindon were outmatched and spent most of the game on the defensive.\n\n7/11/1891\n\nv Weston-super-Mare, Away. Won 20-0. Team:- Ford, Strachan, Pattinson, Ashley, Mackay, Dixon, Parham, Soane, Rogerson, Coles, Alexander, Hooper, Thompson, Vincent and China.\n\nAnother one-sided first half: Bath scored following a free kick. After lemons, Bath scored a second after loose Weston play and again two minutes later for a try which was goaled. \u201cThe visitors, continuing to play pluckily and dextrously, in a short space of time again increased their score with a try, which, however, was not improved upon. Strachan, for the visitors, distinguished himself by dropping a goal, and just before the call of time, after some unique passing by the Bath men, another goal was added to the score.\u201d\n\n14/11/1891\n\nv Bath College, Away. Won 14-2. (2 goals and 2 tries to a try) Selected Team:- Ford, Coningham, Astley, Pattinson, Mackay, T Parham, Dixon, V Soane, China, Alexander, Vincent, Coles, Rogerson, Hooper and Thompson. Astley had a splendid game and Tommy Pareham made some of his typical dodgy runs. The College boys put up a creditable performance. (Dykes actually played, but it was not recorded who dropped out.)\n\nIn fact, Dykes scored an early try, but Vincent failed with the kick. \u201cThe College re-started, and Pattinson picked up in mid-field, but was collared. Mackay scored (secured), however, and passed to Vincent, who crossed the line. The kick was a difficult one, and the attempt to convert was unsuccessful. Play was then of a very give and take nature, until the College dribbled away from a scrum in mid-field, and Bernard got in. Taylor failed to secure the major point. Bath then pressed and the College touched down. The game still continued most exciting, but the College cleared their lines several times in succession capitally, and nothing further was scored until half-time, the teams changing ends with Bath leading by 4 points to 2. Upon resuming, Vincent got in, and kicking the goal as well, put his side 7 points ahead. From this point, however, the collegians played with re-doubled energy, tackling grandly, passing well, and giving Ford plenty of work to do. The Bath men, being much heavier than their opponents, were considerably handicapped by the state of the ground, but ultimately Astley broke away from a scrum in mid-field, and again got in, Vincent converting.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust before the close of the match Mackay received an injury to his knee, and was assisted from the field. The collegians played well throughout, Ford doing especially well at half-back.\u201d\n\n14/11/1891\n\nOn the same afternoon, The Hermitage School beat Bath 2nd XV 40-0. Bath played two men short.\n\nBateman scored five tries for the school, who fielded an outstanding XV, several of whom were, or were to become, Bath players: Swabey (Captain), Bateman, Perreau, Strachan, Fanshawe, B Bateman, Robinson, Dufton, Carey, Rogers, D\u2019Aguilar, Graham, Applegate, Muster and Northey.\n\n21/11/1891\n\nv Widcombe Institute on Claverton Down. Won 42-0. (6 goals and 6 tries)\n\nBath Team:- A D Ford, W Pattinson, G L Strachan, A Perreau, T N Parham, G G Vincent, F Soane, J W Hooper, F China, T Alexander, E C Rogerson, J L Fry, G Bryar, B H Vincent, and H G Sheldon.\n\nThe Institute XV:- J Fry, A Canning, C Crouch, W England, C Banks, A Turvey, J Ascott, J Gibbs (Captain),\n\nH Lavis, T Hancock, H Uphill, W Lane, C Williams, E Dyke, G Trobridge and J Ruddick.\n\nThe Bath three-quarter backs had a field day.\n\nBath tries were secured by Strachan (4), B H Vincent (3), Perreau, Pattinson, Parham, China and Soane. Widcombe\u2019s Crouch and Williams were injured during the play, and the Institute were considerably weakened by their absence.\n\n28/11/1891\n\nv Clifton, Oakfield, Away. Won 7-0. (a goal, a try and 3 minors to nil (1 minor).) Team:- Ford, G L Strachan, Pattinson, Burt, Clarke, G G Vincent, Bryar, E C Rogerson, V Soane, W A Coles, L J Fry, F China,\n\nJ W Hooper, Fletcher and L Loy.\n\nBath sent a weakened side to Clifton, where the ground was in very bad condition; play was largely confined to the forwards. Oakfield had slightly better of the early exchanges, but there were no first-half points. \u201cOn changing over Bath began to press, and after several attempts Pattinson, with a dodgy run, scored behind the posts, Strachan converting. Shortly afterwards Pattinson again got in, but no goal resulting\u2026\u201d\n\n5/12/1891\n\nv Weston-super-Mare, Home. Cancelled as Weston were unable to raise a team.\n\n12/12/1891\n\nClifton telegraphed to say they could not raise a team.\n\n19/12/1891\n\nv Bristol, Home. Lost 0-27. Team:- A D Ford, W Pattinson, T C Rogerson, G L Strachan, J MacTier, M W Dixon, T N Parham, E C Rogerson, J W Hooper, T Alexander, W A Coles, F China, Derrick, R H Lloyd and V Soane. Frank Soane was playing for South v North, England Trial.\n\nThere was a large concourse to watch a particularly strong Bristol side. The encounter was of an \u201cexceedingly fast description.\u201d They were said to have provided the finest exhibition of three-quarter play seen in the West of England. Bath played a good, but uphill game, in which Pattinson, Strachan, MacTier were prominent.\n\n26/12/1891\n\nv Cardiff cancelled due to frost.\n\n7/1/1892\n\nv Bridgwater, Away. Won 19-0. Team: F Swabey, Strachan, Perreau, Dobbin, McTier, M W Dixon,\n\nG G Vincent, F Soane, B H Vincent, E G Rogerson, E Dixon, China, Kemble, Doveton and Barnes.\n\nOn a dull day, and short of several first choice players, Bath had easily the best of the game, winning by three goals and two tries to nil. Actual scorers not recorded.\n\n9/1/1892\n\nBath provided three representatives for the Somerset v Yorkshire clash, in Strachan, Vincent and Soane. Bath felt that they would particularly miss Soane, for their proposed fixture with Clifton: \u201cIf Soane does one thing more than another, he keeps his men well together, and never relaxes a single effort until the game is finished, which, as every football player knows, are valuable qualities in a captain\u2019s composition.\u201d\n\nBath v Clifton. Selected team:-F Swabey, W Pattinson, J MacTier, T C Rogerson, B Hodge, T N Parham, G G Vincent, E C Rogerson, F China, E C Barnes, T Alexander, J H Doveton, J L Fry, S Carey and W A Coles.\n\nThis game appears to have been cancelled.\n\n23/1/1892\n\nv Bristol, Away at Kingswood. Lost 7-10. Team:- F Swabey, Pattinson, T C Rogerson, A Perreau, Strachan, Parham, Vincent, F Soane, E C Rogerson, J W Hooper, A W Ford, F China, T Alexander, W A Coles, and C E Barnes.\n\nBath tries by Ford and Pattinson, with one converted by Strachan. Bristol tries by Lockyer and Flowers, converted by Ashford.\n\nBath were leading at the close of the game, but the referee allowed extra time, and in those additional minutes Bristol won. Bath appealed that the pass to Ashford was forward \u2013 but it was all to no avail!\n\n28/1/1892\n\nv Cheltenham at Henrietta Park. Bath won this first encounter by 2 goals and 6 tries, 22 points to a try, 2 points. It was the first fixture between these two clubs.\n\nTeam: Pinch, B H Vincent, Pattinson, Helps, Clarke, G G Vincent, T Parham, F Soane, (Capt.) Coles, Fry,\n\nR Dykes, P Dykes, T B Timmins, Melsome and Roberts.\n\n\u201cThe ground was heavy and slippery and on the whole the match cannot be described as exciting. For only a brief period-in the first half- was Bath hardly pressed and then Cheltenham brought the attack to a successful issue with a try obtained by Bennett, but Cooke failed to convert. For Bath Pattinson got in twice, Soane twice, Parham, B H Vincent, G G Vincent and Fry once each. The play was remarkable for repeated exhibitions of clever passing on the part of the Bath backs who had matters pretty much their own way. The try by G Vincent was particularly popular as he has played capitally in several matches, B H Vincent converted one of the goals and Pattinson the other.\u201d\n\n6/2/1892\n\nv Swindon Rangers, Away.

Team:- A D Ford, Pattinson, Walker, Mackay, Parham, Miller, F and V Soane, Rogerson, Hooper, Alexander, China, Coles, Melsome, and Doveton.\n\nA large company of spectators visited Kensington Meadows to see Bath overwhelm their visitors.\n\n\u201cWalker eventually got hold of the leather, and with a smart run secured the first try for the home team. F Soane failed to convert. Parham again grounded the ball, which was splendidly placed by Miller. Parham was soon behind the posts again, but the try was not converted. From an admirable pass by Pattinson, another point was recorded by the home captain, and splendidly placed by Millard. At the call of half-time, Bath led by 2 goals, 3 tries.\n\nPlay being resumed, the visitors became weaker than ever and very rarely crossed the centre line. The home team, however, continued with renewed vigour, and succeeded during the second portion of the game and adding 8 extra tries and another goal thus winning by 3 goals and 11 tries to nil. Bath, who were strongly represented, played an admirable game throughout, and their passing was excellent.\u201d\n\n27/2/1892\n\nv Taunton, Away.

Home. Won 19-0. Team:- Swabey, Doveton (senior), Perreau, B H Vincent, Pattinson, Parham, G G Vincent, Carey, Rogerson, Hooper, Coles, China, Alexander, C Doveton and Melsome.\n\nPlayed at Kensington in front of a large company of spectators: \u201cFor some time the game was very even, neither side scoring, but after Pattinson obtained a try for Bath and B H Vincent converted, the Widcombe men fell off somewhat in their play, though they still stubbornly fought their opponents. The match resulted in a win for Bath by 19 points (three goals and two tries to nil).\n\nParham obtained three tries, B H Vincent one and Pattinson one. Widcombe several times looked like scoring, and once took the ball over the Bath goal line as a result of a capital run by Canning, but the referee upheld an objection on the ground of \u201coff side.\u201d The Widcombe forwards played with plenty of vigour and often forced the Bath \u2018pack,\u2019 but they lacked pace in their backs. The tackling of the visitors was very good. Bath played the team announced with the exception of Strachan and Soane, whose places were taken by Doveton se., and Carey.\u201d\n\n26/3/1892\n\nv Cardiff Rangers, Home. Won 18-2.Team:- Swabey, Strachan, Pattinson, Perreau, B H Vincent,\n\nG G Vincent, T N Parham, F Soane, Alexander, Coles, Carey, Melsome, C Doveton, W Downton and Hooper. Tries by Parham (2), G G Vincent, B H Vincent, Soane and Pattinson.\n\nThe visitors were the first to score with a try by Wilding. \u201cCardiff did not hold the advantage long for the home team soon secured a series of tries. Pattinson got behind from a pass out and after an ineffectual attempt at goal by Strachan, Pattinson nearly went over the Cardiff line again, and Soane succeeded in scoring a try. Parham and the Vincents also got in and in one instance a goal was obtained, Bath leading at half-time by a goal and four tries to a try. Upon resuming the visitors played up with more determination and for a considerable period were within the home 25. Just before call of time, however, the ball was worked down in close proximity to the visitors\u2019 goal and Parham getting possession slipped in between the posts. A goal resulted, Bath thus winning by two goals and four tries to a try.\u201d\n\nFOR THE RECORD\n\nBath concluded a very successful season, as out of 26 matches arranged 18 were played, 14 won, 3 lost. 1 drawn; the three lost being with Cardiff once and Bristol, the draw taking place v Swindon Rangers (return). The Club scored 38 goals (one dropped), 49 tries, and 285 points as against 9 goals, 14 tries, and 73 points.

It is a burden which they carry throughout their lives, and we must be thankful to them.\n\nManin, as quoted in Tarkovsky's diaries, 1970.\n\nAcross the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes.\n\nJames Joyce's Ulysses\n\n... she took up her interrupted mathematical investigations, actually more as a way of passing the time than with an expectation of success. But to her not inconsiderable surprise, in the few hours of a single morning she brought to completion, except for some insignificant details, the work she had left lying untouched for several months. This unexpected solution came about with the help of one of those ideas that lie outside the norm and of which one might say, not that they show up when one no longer expects them but rather that their startling effulgence reminds one of the sudden radiance of the beloved who has been there all along among the others before the perplexed suitor ceases to understand how she could have thought any others his equal. Such inspirations involve more than the intellect --- there is always some prerequisite of passion at work.\n\nRobert Musil, The Man without Qualities\n\nI had been to school most all the time ... and could say the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirty-five, and I don't reckon I could ever get any further than that if I was to live forever. I don't take no stock in mathematics, anyway.\n\nHuckleberry Finn.\n\nNear the end of the lecture, the speaker said that he would conclude the proof with some hand-waving. Cartan obviously did not approve. He turned to me and said: \"Now I understand why Indian Gods have so many hands; they want to give proofs in n-dimensions.\"\n\nNarasimhan (NAMS 2010, Sept, p.955).\n\nI need more hands. Michael Freedman lecturing on the proof of the four-dimensional Poincar\u00e9 conjecture (2020).\n\nA mathematician is so rare an animal that he deserves to be preserved, be it only on the score of curiosity.\n\nSimone Weil (as quoted on p.396 of the P\u00e9trement biography).\n\nMathematical laws may be discovered by man, but they are not created by man, nor even by God. That two plus two equals four is not a decree of God that He is free to change into two plus two equals three, or five. I perceive the mathematical laws as being part of the very nature of God--a tiny part, certainly, the most superficial in some sense, and the only part accessible to reason alone.\n\nGrothendieck, La Clef des Songes (via Juan Antonio Navarro Gonzalez)\n\nBut then I felt possessed by an aura of inspiration that allowed me to improvise credible answers and miraculous lucky guesses. Except in mathematics, which not even God could make me understand.\n\nGabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Living to Tell the Tale, p204.\n\nT.S. Eliot\n\nUnfortunately [mathematics is] only beautiful to the initiated, to the people who do it. It can't really be understood or appreciated much on a popular level the way music can. You don't have to be a composer to enjoy music, but in mathematics you do.\n\nJohn Tate.\n\nThe danger to society is not merely that it should believe wrong things, though that is great enough; but that it should become credulous, and lose the habit of testing things and inquiring into them; for then it must sink back into savagery.\n\nWilliam Kingdon Clifford (of Clifford algebras).\n\nPhysics is very interesting. There are many, many interesting theorems. Unfortunately, there are no definitions.\n\nDavid Kazhdan.\n\nJohn Baez suggests that this explains the synergy between category theory and physics: category theory has many many interesting definitions, but no theorems.\n\nAn absence of proof is a challenge; an absence of definition is deadly.\n\nDeligne on his attempt to understand how physicists could make correct predictions in classical algebraic geometry.\n\nEarly on I noticed that mathematicians live in a world inaccessible to common mortals ... They are a special breed possessed by an intense cerebral life; simultaneously living on two distinct levels of consciousness, they are at once present and able to carry on normally and yet are immersed in the abstractions that form the core of their lives.\n\nFran\u00e7oise Ulam (Stanislaw Ulam's wife).\n\nI came into the room, which was half dark, and presently spotted Lord Kelvin in the audience and realised that I was in for trouble at the last part of my speech dealing with the age of the earth, where my views conflicted with his. To my relief, Kelvin fell fast asleep, but as I came to the important point, I saw the old bird sit up, open an eye and cock a baleful glance at me! Then a sudden inspiration came, and I said Lord Kelvin had limited the age of the earth, provided no new source (of energy) was discovered. That prophetic utterance refers to what we are now considering tonight, radium! Behold! the old boy beamed upon me.\n\nErnest Rutherford\n\nEvery mathematician worthy of the name has experienced, if only rarely, the state of lucid exaltation in which one thought succeeds another as if miraculously, and in which the unconscious (however one interprets that word) seems to play a role.\n\nAndr\u00e9 Weil\n\n... it is impossible to explain honestly the beauties of the laws of nature in a way that people can feel, without their having some deep understanding of mathematics. I am sorry, but this seems to be the case.\n\nRichard Feynman er...\n\nIn the broad light of day mathematicians check their equations and their proofs, leaving no stone unturned in their search for rigour. But, at night, under the full moon, they dream, they float among the stars and wonder at the miracle of the heavens. They are inspired. Without dreams there is no art, no mathematics, no life.\n\nAtiyah (NAMS Jan 2010 p.8).\n\nI still say to myself when I am depressed, and find myself forced to listen to pompous and tiresome people, \"Well, I have done one thing you could never have have done, and that is to have collaborated with both Littlewood and Ramanujan on something like equal terms.\"\n\nHardy, Apology, Sect. 29.\n\nThe problem with the global village is all the global-village idiots.\n\nAttributed to Sidney Coleman in arXiv:1108.2700.\n\n[or worse Paul Krugman, blog April 8 2011.Bill Clinton (Sept. 6, 2012, Democratic Convention).\n\nDo not work within two hours of a substantial meal; blood cannot be in two places at once.\n\nJ.E. Littlewood, in Littlewood's miscellany, p199.\n\nCertainly the best times were when I was alone with mathematics, free of ambition and pretense, and indifferent to the world.\n\nLanglands, in Mathematicians: An Outer View of the Inner World, p142.\n\nMathematics has been for me, not only a profession, but also my preferred hobby. ... Again and again I have been guided by a sense of the architecture of this edifice, to which we continue to add new wings and new floors while renovating the parts already constructed, into feeling that certain problems had priority as opening new perspectives or establishing a new foundation for future constructions. This is the professional point of view, but happily these problems were those that attracted me the most. In other instances I was not guided by such motives, being attracted only by curiosity, by the need to know the answer to an enigma, without reference to its importance in a general context. Borel, \u0152uvres IV, p376.\n\nEven God wouldn't get a grant today because somebody on the committee would say, oh those were very interesting experiments (creating the universe), but they've never been repeated. And then someone else would say, yes and he did it a long time ago; what's he done recently? And a third would say, to top it all, he published it all in an un-refereed journal (The Bible).\n\nSydney Brenner.\n\nIt is while doing mathematical research that one truly comes to see the beauty of mathematics. It faces you in those moments when the underlying simplicity of a question appears and its meaningless complications can be forgotten. In those moments a piece of a colossal logical structure is illuminated, and some of the meaning hidden in the nature of things is finally revealed.\n\nRuelle, The Mathematician's Brain, p130.\n\nA lifetime of mathematical activity is a reward in itself.\n\nJohn Tate, on receiving the Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement.\n\nThe laws of mathematics are very commendable, but the only law that applies in Australia is the law of Australia.\n\nMalcolm Turnbull, Prime Minister of Australia\n\nIs there anything the National Forest Service can do to change the course of the earth's orbit around the sun?
