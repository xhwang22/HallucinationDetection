The first in her family to graduate from university, Ameer has earned a bachelor of health studies, graduating summa cum laude, and is the recipient of the Murray G. Ross Award.\n\nThe award, which is typically presented during spring convocation, recognizes one student for outstanding academic excellence and significant contributions to the University and campus life. It is considered one of York University\u2019s highest honours for a graduating student.\n\nAmeer, who specialized in health-care management, says she feels honoured to win the award and \u201cbe part of an extraordinary group of students who previously won.\u201d And though it was her own dedication to academia and university life that earned her the recognition, she credits her mentors \u2013 Lynda Van Dreumel (undergraduate program director, School of Health Policy and Management); Professor Ellen Schraa (School of Health Policy and Management); and York University President and Vice-Chancellor Rhonda L. Lenton \u2013 for their guidance throughout her undergraduate journey.\n\nShe describes her academic experience at York as one rich with hands-on learning and experiential education (EE) opportunities. During her years of study within the School of Health Policy and Management, she contributed to the development of course designs and potential placements for a practicum course. She also provided advice on ways to increase EE initiatives and suggested opportunities that would enrich the Health Studies program.\n\nHer academic performance is notable, and in her first year Ameer was admitted to the Golden Key International Honours Society for ranking among the top 15 per cent of students in the Faculty of Health. She has earned a place on the Dean\u2019s Honour Roll every year, and in her final year was named the top graduating student in the Health Studies program based on her academic achievements and contributions made to improving undergraduate student life on campus.\n\nAmeer is a recipient of the Canadian International Model United Nations (UN) Organization Award for the best health policy recommendations in the World Health Organization committee, and the Outstanding Delegate Award for her debate performance at the Ryerson Model United Nations Conference in 2018. York has recognized her with the York University Continuing Student Scholarship for academic achievements, as well as the Calumet and Stong College Leadership Award for contributions to the Faculty of Health.\n\n\u201cMy passion for social impact and helping others inspired me to pursue a degree in health studies,\u201d she says, adding that combined with her interest in business leadership, health-care management felt like the right fit. In her fourth year, she completed a practicum at the Toronto Grace Hospital in downtown Toronto, where she worked on a research project to improve family and patient experience.\n\nAlso heavily involved in extracurricular and leadership opportunities on campus, Ameer contributed to campus life through several student clubs and organizations. In her second year, she served as president of Doctors without Borders and as vice-president of York\u2019s Model United Nations team. During the past two years, she worked closely with the University, serving as a president\u2019s ambassador, student-alumni ambassador and student representative on York\u2019s Marketing Committee. She was also selected to represent Canada at the United Nations Youth Assembly taking place at the UN headquarters in New York City.\n\n\u201cMy extracurricular activities allowed me to create a connection between what I was learning in the classroom and real-world events,\u201d says Ameer. \u201cIn my second year, I took a health policy course, while at the same time volunteering with the Heart and Stroke Foundation to persuade legislators to implement a value-added tax on all vaping products in Ontario. My extracurriculars helped shape my academic success, as I developed a new way of thinking about course material. I understood how my coursework directly impacted everyday decisions in health care and solutions that could be created to address challenges.\u201d\n\nAmeer says her most valuable learning experience at York didn\u2019t take place in lecture hall, but instead at a place that represents the future of the University: the grounds for the Markham Centre Campus. In October 2020, she was invited as the student representative for the campus groundbreaking ceremony, where she was asked to speak.\n\n\u201cI was given the opportunity to present what the Markham Campus means to the student body and the future of York University,\u201d she says. \u201cI was truly humbled to share the platform with the President of York University, Rhonda Lenton, along with several cabinet ministers from the federal and provincial governments. Throughout my undergraduate degree I developed an interest in law and politics, so being able to share the platform with politicians made me realize that one day I could become a politician myself.\u201d\n\nThe experience had a great impact on Ameer, and she plans to attend law school and run for public office in the future, as well as contribute time as a volunteer to non-profit organizations and community groups to further her interest in social justice.\n\n\u201cYork University is a second home for me and holds a special place in my heart,\u201d she says. \u201cThe community is so tightly knit, where everyone wants to help one another and become changemakers in their field. We are a close family who have each other\u2019s backs and are willing to step up when it is time for action.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://educationnewscanada.com/article/education/level/university/1/907968/health-studies-graduate-recognized-with-murray-g-ross-award.html", "page_content": "Sorry, this is not allowed\n\n\n\nYou have requested a Web page or resource that you aren't allowed to access.

Do we write doctoral degree or doctorate degree? What is the difference between a Ph.D. and an M.D., and when should the credentials appear in our writing?\n\nWe\u2019ll address such questions to provide direction you can apply.\n\nWhat Is a Doctor?\n\nDoctor is an academic title that originates from the Latin equivalent for \u201cteacher.\u201d It represents someone who has earned a doctoral degree, which is the highest academic distinction awarded by a college or university. A person with a doctorate has completed coursework, exams, a dissertation, and an articulated reasoning for that dissertation.\n\n\u201cDoctor\u201d has been used as an academic title in Europe since the 13th century, when the first doctoral distinctions were given. Today, the contracted Dr. or Dr also represents someone who has obtained a doctorate in a field of study; an individual can be a \u201cdoctor\u201d without a distinction in medicine. For example, someone might earn a Ph.D. (Doctor of Philosophy) in history or economics.\n\nNote that doctoral degrees are further distinguished into different types as well. The following are just a few of the titles bestowed:\n\nD.D. Divinitatis Doctor (Doctor of Divinity) D.D.S. Doctor of Dental Surgery D.O. Doctor of Osteopathy D.V.M. Doctor of Veterinary Medicine J.D. Juris Doctor (Doctor of Law) M.D. Medicinae Doctor (Doctor of Medicine) Ph.D. Philosophiae Doctor (Doctor of Philosophy)\n\nIn speech, we would refer to the person with a doctorate in medicine and the person with a doctorate in history as \u201cdoctor.\u201d The distinctions \u201cDr.,\u201d \u201cM.D.,\u201d and \u201cPh.D.\u201d are not interchangeable in writing, however.\n\nOnly an individual who has earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree would be identified as having a \u201cPh.D.\u201d; this person has established specialized knowledge in a particular area but typically cannot treat patients or prescribe medications. Someone who holds an \u201cM.D.\u201d has earned a Doctor of Medicine degree, meaning the person has completed medical school, can diagnose and treat patients, and can prescribe medications. A person can hold both an M.D. and a Ph.D.\n\nWe would not use Dr. before the names of those who hold only an honorary doctorate. We also would not continue using the title in references following the first one (e.g., Dr. Emily Branson on first mention and then Branson, Ms. Branson, or Mrs. Branson).\n\nDoctoral and Doctorate: Placement and Address in Writing\n\nAccording to The Associated Press Stylebook, if mentioning a degree is needed to establish someone\u2019s credentials, the preferred form is to forgo an abbreviation and instead use as phrase such as Emily Branson, who has a doctorate in philosophy.\n\nIf referring to multiple individuals with a doctorate, we can revert to the abbreviation to make the content less cumbersome. The abbreviation would follow the person\u2019s full name and be set off with a comma: Emily Branson, Ph.D.; Roger Pendleton, Ph.D.; and Len Bryant, Ph.D.\n\nIf the individual holds a doctorate in medicine or psychology, dentistry, or veterinary medicine, we would place the abbreviated title \u201cDr.\u201d before the name: Dr. Anthony Fowler.\n\nWe would not spell the title before the name: Doctor Anthony Fowler would be incorrect. We also would not combine the title \u201cDr.\u201d with another distinction that may have been earned: e.g., Dr. Anthony Fowler, D.D., would be incorrect.\n\nLikewise, we would drop titles such as Mr., Mrs., and Ms. if another title is used.\n\nCorrect: Harold H. Johanssen, Ph.D. Incorrect: Mr. Harold H. Johanssen, Ph.D.\n\nThe names of academic degrees and honors should be capitalized when they follow someone\u2019s name, whether abbreviated or written in full:\n\nBryan F. Wing, Doctor of Dental Surgery Bryan F. Wing, D.D.S.\n\nStyle for punctuation of an abbreviated degree can vary. The Chicago Manual of Style recommends omitting periods unless they are required for consistency or tradition (i.e., use PhD in most references). The Associated Press on the other hand favors retaining the periods (Ph.D.). With that being said, you can choose your treatment according to your personal preference or the style guidelines you follow.\n\nSo Is It Doctoral Degree or Doctorate Degree?\n\nYou may have noticed that we\u2019ve been italicizing the words doctoral and doctorate in our discussion. These are all examples of how doctoral and doctorate can be applied with precision in your writing.\n\nIn being precise, you can use doctorate as the identifying noun and doctoral as the identifying adjective (descriptor) of anything that relates to a doctorate. In other words, a doctorate is a doctoral degree. A doctorate would also have included a doctoral dissertation.\n\nThe AP Stylebook recommends not using capitals for degrees expressed in general terms (doctorate, doctoral degree) but using them when capitalizing specific degrees (Doctor of Dental Surgery, Doctor of Philosophy).\n\nAP and CMOS agree that the field of study be written in lower case except when it contains a proper noun (e.g., Ph.D. in history, Ph.D. in French).\n\nRelated Topics\n\nCapitalization of Academic Degrees\n\nIs It Associate Degree or Associate\u2019s Degree?\n\nIs It Bachelors Degree or Bachelor\u2019s Degree?\n\nIs It Masters Degree or Master\u2019s Degree?\n\nIf the article or the existing discussions do not address a thought or question you have on the subject, please use the \"Comment\" box at the bottom of this page."}, {"url": "https://www.findaphd.com/guides/what-is-a-phd", "page_content": "The PhD can take on something of a mythic status. Are they only for geniuses? Do you have to discover something incredible? Does the qualification make you an academic? And are higher research degrees just for people who want to be academics?\n\nEven the full title, \u2018Doctor of Philosophy\u2019, has a somewhat mysterious ring to it. Do you become a doctor? Yes, but not that kind of doctor. Do you have to study Philosophy? No (not unless you want to).\n\nSo, before going any further, let's explain what the term 'PhD' actually means and what defines a doctorate.\n\nWhat does PhD stand for?\n\nPhD stands for Doctor of Philosophy. This is one of the highest level academic degrees that can be awarded. PhD is an abbreviation of the Latin term (Ph)ilosophiae (D)octor. Traditionally the term \u2018philosophy\u2019 does not refer to the subject but its original Greek meaning which roughly translates to \u2018lover of wisdom\u2019.\n\nPhD vs doctorate\n\nA doctorate is any qualification that awards a doctoral degree. In order to qualify for one you need to produce advanced work that makes a significant new contribution to knowledge in your field. Doing so earns you the title 'Doctor' \u2013 hence the name.\n\nSo, what is the difference between a PhD and a doctorate? A PhD is a type of doctorate.\n\nThe PhD is the most common type of doctorate. It is awarded in almost all subjects at universities around the world. Other doctorates tend to be more specialised or for more practical and professional projects.\n\nEssentially, all PhDs are doctorates, but not all doctorates are PhDs.\n\nHow long is a PhD?\n\nThe typical length of a PhD is three to four years full-time, or five to six years part-time. How long it takes to complete your PhD will depend on the structure of your programme, your funding arrangements and any additional training you're required to complete.\n\nDo you need a Masters to get a PhD?\n\nNot necessarily. It's common for students in Arts and the Humanities to complete an MA (Master of Arts) before starting a PhD in order to acquire research experience and techniques. Students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) don't always need an MSc (Master of Science) to do a PhD as you'll gain training in lab techniques and other skills during your undergraduate degree.\n\nWhether a Masters is a requirement for a PhD degree also varies by country. Australian PhDs may require a Masters as the equivalent of their own 'honours year' (where students work on research). US PhD programmes often include a Masters.\n\nWe have a whole guide dedicated to helping you decide whether a PhD without a Masters is the right route for you.\n\nThe origin of the PhD\n\nDespite its name, the PhD isn't actually an Ancient Greek degree. Instead it's a much more recent development. The PhD degree as we know it was developed in nineteenth-century Germany, alongside the modern research university.\n\nHigher education had traditionally focussed on mastery of an existing body of scholarship and the highest academic rank available was, appropriately enough, a Masters degree.\n\nThe PhD degree was brought in as the focus shifted more onto the production of new knowledge and ideas."}, {"url": "https://philosophy.utoronto.ca/st-george/graduate/admission/", "page_content": "The department admits students to two degree programs: Master of Arts (MA) (Philosophy OR Philosophy of Science Concentration) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD, four-year OR five-year streams).\n\nApplications for 2023-24 are now CLOSED.\n\nPlease read this page carefully for instructions on how to apply. You can also learn more in the School of Graduate Studies\u2019 Admissions Guide.\n\nNote that students applying for admission should not submit GRE scores.

We strongly encourage international applicants to apply to the PhD program rather than the MA. Canadian citizens and permanent residents are very welcome to apply to either program.\n\nCohort Sizes\n\nAbout 12 new PhD and 15 new MA students enroll each year. Typically, the MA students are domestic, with the majority being admitted to our Philosophy Concentration, and the remainder to our Philosophy of Science Concentration. All students entering both programs are guaranteed funding to cover tuition and living expenses. For details, see our funding and fellowships page.\n\nApplicants who have questions about admissions are encouraged to carefully read through the following sections:\n\n1. Admissions Requirements\n\nAdmission to the MA program (Philosophy Concentration, hereafter \u2018Philosophy\u2019) requires a bachelor\u2019s degree from a recognized university. The applicant must have a strong background in philosophy (roughly equivalent to an undergraduate major), with minimum average grades of mid-B in the applicant\u2019s overall program and A- in the philosophy courses.\n\nAdmission to the MA program (Philosophy of Science Concentration, hereafter \u2018Philosophy of Science\u2019) requires a bachelor\u2019s degree from a recognized university. The applicant must have strong interest in philosophy (evidenced in an excellent writing sample, personal statement, and letters of reference) and a superior academic background in either philosophy or, typically, a subject in the natural or social sciences, with minimum average grades of A-.\n\nOur one-year MA program (Philosophy) is intended primarily for those seeking only a more comprehensive and concentrated training in philosophy than undergraduate study permits. The MA also serves as preparation for a PhD program; graduates of the Toronto MA program have gone on to top philosophy PhD programs in Canada and internationally, as well as to law school and careers in government, business and the non-profit sector.\n\nOur one-year MA (Philosophy of Science) is intended primarily for those seeking a more comprehensive and concentrated training in philosophy and the philosophy of science than undergraduate study permits. The concentration also serves as preparation for a PhD program; like other graduates of the Toronto MA (Philosophy), graduates of the MA (Philosophy of Science) will be competitive for application to PhD programs in Canada and internationally, as well as to law school and careers in government, business and the non-profit sector.\n\nAdmission to the PhD program requires either a bachelor\u2019s degree or a master\u2019s degree in philosophy from a recognized university.\n\nA student seeking admission on the basis of a bachelor\u2019s degree must have a strong background in philosophy (roughly equivalent to at least an undergraduate major), with minimum average grades of B+ in the applicant\u2019s overall program and A- in the applicant\u2019s philosophy courses.\n\nA student seeking admission on the basis of a master\u2019s degree in philosophy must have an average grade of at least an A- in that master\u2019s program. The PhD program is intended primarily for those interested in teaching philosophy and doing advanced philosophical research. Applicants must satisfy the Admissions Committee that they are capable of independent research in philosophy at an advanced level.\n\nNote that admission to our MA and PhD programs is highly competitive and selective. Students who wish to be considered for both graduate-level programs should apply to the PhD program. You do not need to submit two applications \u2013 simply indicate that you are open to being considered for both.\n\nNote to international applicants\n\nThe academic records of applicants who completed their final degree(s) at a non-Canadian university will be evaluated to determine their equivalency to a University of Toronto four-year bachelor\u2019s degree and a minimum academic standing of A-. Please refer to the School of Graduate Studies website to verify your qualifications.\n\n2. Application Procedures\n\nNote: The required documents and application procedures are the same for the MA and PhD programs.\n\nThe application and all supporting documents except for English Proficiency Test scores (TOEFL, etc.) must be submitted through the School of Graduate Studies Online Admission Application page:\n\nSGS Online Admission\n\nMore detailed application instructions\n\nYou may need to disable pop-up blockers in your browser if you have difficulty completing the online process.\n\nIf you are applying to our MA program, you will be asked to choose between MA (Philosophy) and MA (Philosophy of Science) .\n\nand . If you are applying to the PhD program, you will be asked to choose between two versions of it: PhD (direct entry) \u2013 Philosoph y, and PhD \u2013 Philosophy . The former is our standard 5-year PhD program, which requires two years of coursework; The latter is our 4-year PhD program, which is designed for students entering with an MA in philosophy and requires one year of coursework. If you are uncertain about which program you would like to apply to, select the 5-year PhD, even if you already have an MA.\n\ny, and .\n\nFrom the following seven areas, select the one that best characterizes your proposed research area:\n\nAncient Philosophy Medieval Philosophy 17th and 18th Century Philosophy Continental Philosophy Analytic Metaphysics/Epistemology/Philosophy of Science Analytic Philosophy of Language/Philosophy of Mind/Logic Ethics/Political Philosophy/Aesthetics\n\nThe selection above will just determine which members of the Admissions Committee initially review your file; students are at liberty to change their focus of study once admitted.\n\nIf you are applying for external funding (e.g., SSHRC), check the box on your application next to \u201cAwards/Scholarships/Fellowships applied for and related to this application.\u201d This box is for record-keeping purposes only; the status of any external funding applications is not a consideration that is taken into account during our admissions process.\n\nSupporting documents\n\nAll submitted documents must be in PDF format. The Statement of Interest is a statement of about 300 words which indicates your areas of interest in philosophy at the graduate level. If there is information about you that you would like the committee to have, but that cannot be included elsewhere in the application, you may include it here. The Writing Sample is a piece of your written work in philosophy (in English or French), such as a term paper. Submit one writing sample only, preferably not exceeding 15 pages double-spaced (this excludes Notes and Bibliography). The writing sample should be as recent as possible and should provide evidence of your ability to do philosophy at an advanced level. All students applying to the PhD are advised to submit a writing sample in one of their proposed areas of research interest. MA students with a strong sense of their proposed areas of research interest are likewise counseled to do so. All applicants are required to upload one electronic or scanned transcript from each post-secondary institution attended. The School of Graduate Studies online application instructions explain how to do this (details TK). Admissions decisions will be made on the basis of the scanned transcript; however, if you accept an offer of admission, you will then be required to send official paper transcript(s) to our department. Graduate Record Exam (GRE) scores are not required and will not be reviewed for admission. Scores on English Proficiency Tests: All applicants whose primary language is not English or who have not completed an undergraduate or graduate degree at an institution recognized by the University of Toronto in which the language of instruction is English must satisfy the School of Graduate Studies requirements for English-Language Proficiency; scores should be reported electronically to the University of Toronto (Enrolment Services) by the testing agency. Letters of Recommendation: Applicants must provide contact information for at least two, but preferably three, philosophy instructors who have indicated they are willing to write a recommendation. On completion of the application form, the University of Toronto online system will generate a notification to those referees, requesting letters from them. Referees may upload their letters of recommendation before the applicant has paid their application fee. As letters of reference are due at the same time as all supporting materials with the application \u2013 by the next deadline in January 2023 \u2013 it is important to request them from your referees as early in the process as possible. Email addresses for referees should be institutional. If one (at a maximum) of your referees does not have access to an institutional email, please have them submit their letter as a pdf, signed and on institutional letterhead. Please note that referees using an institutional email may simply type or copy and paste a signed and dated letter of reference. We do not accept letters of reference from Interfolio. Curriculum Vitae: Applicants should submit an up-to-date CV.\n\nIf you have further questions related to your application, please see Admissions FAQ for Prospective Graduate Students.\n\nApplying for the application fee waiver and unsure where to upload your documents? Please follow the steps below:\n\nUpload your transcripts under \u201cAcademic History\u201d -> \u201cAdd Institution.\u201d The transcript drop box is at the bottom of that page. You should upload a transcript for each academic institution you have attended/are attending. These transcripts can be unofficial at this point, although official transcripts will be required to register. Upload your statement of interest (used to indicate why you are applying for a fee waiver, and how you belong to an equity-seeking group) under \u201cFaculty Instructions: PHL\u201d -> \u201cAdditional Requirements.\u201d Follow the instructions to upload your statement of interest.\n\nNote: After learning that you have received a fee waiver, you can choose to submit a new statement of interest that reflects only your research interests and other information you seek to share with the admissions committee as a whole.\n\n3. Application Deadline\n\nThe closing date for applications for 2023-24 is Monday, January 9, 2023, 11:59 p.m. EST. Processing of applications will begin after this deadline, and decisions will be announced by mid-March. You can check the status of your application on the School of Graduate Studies website after the 3rd week in January. The status of your application will be updated from \u201cDocuments Pending\u201d to \u201cUnder Review\u201d by mid-February. Your application is complete, however, and you needn\u2019t take any further action unless and until you are notified of your admission by our department. This will happen via email.\n\n4. Visiting and Special Students\n\nGraduate students wishing to take one or more graduate courses offered by the department as non-degree students should apply for admission as Special Students.
