Nate was a curious boy who loved airplanes and wanted to be a pilot, like his older brother. When he was 19 Nate signed up for the US Army to serve in World War II and learn to fly airplanes. But when a previous infection in his leg flared up, he was not allowed to fly. However, in his three years in the Army, he did learn a lot about airplanes and how to fix them.\n\nAfter he left the Army, a missionary asked Nate to come to Mexico to fix a badly damaged airplane. Nate went and decided to serve Christ by being a missionary pilot. He married his girlfriend, Marjorie, and headed for the South American country of Ecuador to open a new Missionary Aviation Fellowship station. Nate\u2019s job was to fly missionaries into remote jungle villages and bring them supplies. This was a very dangerous job. But when a crash left Nate with a broken back and badly sprained ankle, he recovered and got right back to flying.\n\nThe supplies that Nate dropped off would often get caught in trees or broken as they fell from the airplane. So Nate invented a bucket drop system. By flying in tight circles a bucket containing supplies could be lowered from the airplane and the bucket would remain still so the missionaries could easily unload it. He also invented a dual injection engine to make flying safer. His inventions are still being used today.\n\nNate and four of his friends had a burden to reach a remote people group called the Aucas. These people were very dangerous, known for killing anyone who dared come into their territory. Using Nate\u2019s bucket system, the missionaries spent three months sending gifts to the Aucas in an expression of friendliness. The Aucas started sending gifts back. The missionaries decided to land the plane on a sand bar and make contact with the Aucas. This would be Nate\u2019s last flight. He and his friends were all killed by the Aucas\u2019 spears.\n\nNate died serving the Lord and taking the gospel where it had never been taken before. But that\u2019s not the end of the story. Nate\u2019s sister, Rachel, along with Elisabeth Elliot, whose husband had also been killed by the Aucas, went back to the Aucas and shared the gospel with them. Because of the love they showed the tribal people, many believed in Jesus and were saved\u2014including some of the very people who had killed Nate and his friends.\n\nThis is the reconstructed frame of Nate Saint's plane used in missionary work in Ecuador. It is currently on display at Mission Aviation Fellowship headquarters.\n\nNate\u2019s son, Steve, joined his Aunt Rachel each summer in the jungle among the tribe that killed his dad. But because he understands the love and grace of God, Steve is friends with the very men who killed his dad and who are now his brothers in Christ. Steve and his sister were even baptized by several Auca believers in the river beside the place where their father died. Steve still lives among these people.\n\nNate\u2019s death was not a waste. God used his and his friends\u2019 deaths to help the gospel grow among the Aucas\u2014the people they loved.\n\nFun Facts about Nate Saint\n\nNate had six brothers and one sister.\n\nNate\u2019s grandfather was a successful inventor, just like Nate.\n\nAs a kid, Nate built an 8-foot sailboat and took apart a car engine just to put it back together again.\n\nLearn More"}, {"url": "https://missionsbox.org/missionary-bio/nate-saint/", "page_content": "\u201cPeople who do not know the Lord ask why in the world we waste our lives as missionaries. They forget that they too are expending their lives \u2026 and when the bubble has burst, they will have nothing of eternal significance to show for the years they have wasted.\u201d \u2013 Nate Saint\n\nHis Early Life and Times\n\nNate Saint was born in 1923 near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The seventh of eight children, he was raised in a devout Christian home.\n\nLike many young men in the first half of the 20th century, he was fascinated with airplanes. In 1930, at the age of seven, one of his older brothers gave him a ride on a plane. Three years and some thrilling flights later, his brother let him take the controls on a flight. From that time on, he was fascinated, not only with airplanes; he became fascinated with flying.\n\nIn 1942, at the age of 19, Nate enlisted in the U.S. Army where he expected to become a pilot during World War II. Unfortunately, due to a lingering infection, the Army would not allow him to fly. Nate turned that into an opportunity to become an aviation mechanic. He learned valuable lessons in that position that he would use later.\n\nHis Unexpected Life in Aviation\n\nFollowing Nate\u2019s three years in the military, he obtained a commercial pilot\u2019s license and enrolled at Wheaton College. During that time, his father made him aware of the newly established Christian Airmen\u2019s Missionary Fellowship (CAMF) which eventually became the Mission Aviation Fellowship.\n\nThe MAF began transporting missionaries into hard-to-reach places in the jungles of Mexico, Peru, and Ecuador. While at Wheaton, Nate committed his life to serving the Lord as a missionary and missions pilot. He so with the understanding that the work would be dangerous. In one year alone, 51 people died in missionary plane crashes in the jungle. In 1948, Nate and his wife traveled to Ecuador to open an MAF base at Shell Mara.\n\nHis Eventful Life in Ecuador\n\nMissions work in Ecuador did not start well for the avid missionary pilot. In December of his first year, the plane he was piloting crashed after a powerful downforce of wind drove it into the ground. Nate suffered a broken back and other injuries that kept him in a body cast for six months.\n\nThe bulk of Nate\u2019s work was transporting missionaries to villages that would otherwise have taken many days to reach traveling on foot. Once they were in place, he delivered food and supplies for their sustenance and work. Often supplies included medicines and medical equipment they would use to treat illnesses in the tribes to which they ministered.\n\nNate solved one of the early problems in jungle missionary aviation while serving the Lord in Ecuador. Pilots would drop supplies in predetermined locations, but some supplies were destroyed when the hit the ground, and more ended up in the treetops of the jungle canopy. Nate devised a method of safely and efficiently lowering supplies using a bucket and a rope while circling overhead. Not only were the supplies delivered, but the missionaries were able to send messages and other items up to the plane using the device.\n\nNate described his life in Ecuador this way:\n\n\u201cIt is our task to lift these missionaries up off those rigorous, life-consuming, and morale-breaking jungle trails\u2014lift them up to where five minutes in a plane equals twenty-four hours on foot. The reason for all this is not a matter of bringing comfort to the missionaries. They don\u2019t go to the steaming, tropical jungles looking for comfort in the first place. It\u2019s a matter of gaining precious time, of redeeming days and weeks, months and even years that can be spent in giving the Word of Life to primitive people.\u201d[1]\n\nHis Eventual Loss in Ecuador\n\nNate and four other missionaries had developed a burden to reach the Aucas, a reclusive tribe of native Indians known to kill others found in their territory. The Ecuadorian government had been considering sending troops in to subdue the natives.\n\nNonetheless, Nate, Jim Elliot, Ed McCully, Peter Fleming, and Roger Youdarian began an effort to break through to the tribe. They started by making flights over the village, dropping gifts from pots and pans to trinkets. Having received what they considered a warm response, they determined that it was time to meet the Aucas in person.\n\nOn January 8, 1956, the five landed the plane on a strip of side alongside a river near the village. They were to make scheduled radio calls to their families back at the airfield compound, but no transmissions were ever made. The Aucas had massacred Nate and the others and left their bodies in the river and along the beach.\n\nThe story made major headlines, including an entire photo spread in Life magazine.\n\nHis Eternal Legacy\n\nJesus said that \u201ceven the gates of Hell shall not prevail\u201d against the Kingdom of God and His Church. Indeed, the spears of the Aucas could not. Instead of retreating in fear and defeat, the effort to reach the Aucas continued, including the personal ministry of Nate\u2019s son Steve and sister Ruth and Jim Elliot\u2019s wife Elisabeth, each of whom eventually lived with and ministered to the Aucas.\n\nTheir continued work has created an eternal legacy as many of the Aucas natives have accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior over the years, including six of the men who participated in the raid and killed Nate and his fellow missionaries.\n\nThe Indians told their families that they were puzzled at why the men did not fight but willingly gave up their lives. Their amazement opened the door for the women to tell them that the men were there to tell them about Jesus Christ who \u201cfreely allowed his own death\u201d to ransom them from sin and its inevitable price.\n\nRachel Saint spent the rest of her natural life with Wycliffe Bible Translators among the Aucas and is buried in Ecuador.\n\nKimo, the pastor of the tribe, requested the honor of baptizing Steve and Kathy, Nate\u2019s children, to demonstrate their reconciliation through Christ. The pastor had been a member of the killing party.\n\nGikita, the leader of the attack, died a believer at the age of 80. He said that he was \u201ceager to go to Heaven and live peacefully with the five men who came to tell them about Creator God.\u201d[2]\n\nAs Nate Saint said, \u201cWhen life\u2019s flight is over, and we unload our cargo at the other end, the fellow who got rid of unnecessary weight will have the most valuable cargo to present to the Lord.\u201d\n\n[1] Jungle Pilot: The Life and Witness of Nate Saint, Russell T.

He was accompanied by four others: Jim Elliot, Pete Fleming, Ed McCully, and Roger Youderain. All five were killed while attempting to evangelize the Huaorani people through efforts known as Operation Auca.\n\nEarly Life\n\nNate Saint was born in 1923. When he was seven he took his first plane ride with his brother Sam, who would eventually become a commercial pilot for American Airlines. While in the airplane he discovered a love of flying.\n\n\u200d\n\nHis family was somewhat unusual. His brothers made a sleeping patio on the roof of their home, and his dad built a roller coaster in the backyard.\n\n\u200d\n\nWhen he joined the army he was stationed in Las Vegas NV, but was transferred to several other locations over the years. A leg injury from a sledding accident caused him some problems while he was in the army. About a year before he was discharged, he almost died while climbing a mountain in Yosemite National Park. After that incident he learned to live life to the fullest.[1]\n\n\u200d\n\nWhen Nate was asked by a friend to fix a plane somewhere in Mexico, he finally agreed. After he repaired the plane, he discovered a need for his skill in the field of mission-work and also a new awareness of the value of missions. After going to Wheaton College, Nate married Marjorie Farris (commonly called Marj) in 1948 and eventually moved to Shell Mera, Ecuador. Here, Nate built his family a house which would also serve as a guesthouse and a radio center with the other missionaries.[2]\n\nLife in Ecuador, Meeting the Huaroni\n\nIn September 1955, Nate was joined by his teammates, Jim Elliot, Ed McCully, Pete Fleming, and Roger Youderian. Saint finally found a Huaorani settlement while searching by air. To reach the tribe, Saint and the team lowered gifts to the Huaorani in a bucket tied to the plane.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Huaorani were widely feared by other Ecuadorians, because they combined a desire to be left alone with a willingness to use force. They attacked and killed any intruders without provocation. Nevertheless, the tribe was excited on receiving the gifts and gave some gifts back.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the missionaries decided to try to meet the Huaorani on the ground; and, on January 3, 1956, using the beach as a landing strip, they set up camp four miles from the Huaorani settlement.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Nate Saint Died\n\nTheir initial contact was encouraging; however, on Sunday, January 8, 1956, the entire team was killed on the beach (known as \"Palm Beach\") when armed Huaorani met and speared them.[3] Nate Saint was the first of the five missionaries to be speared to death.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaint and the other four men became famous worldwide as a result. Life magazine published a 10-page photo essay on the story, which was also covered in Reader's Digest and many other publications. Today, a small school for missionary children in Shell, Ecuador, bears Nate Saint's name. After 51 years, the school has closed in 2017 due to falling enrollment.\n\n\n\n\n\nRachel Saint, Nate's sister, continued the mission efforts to the Huaorani, which eventually came to fruition. This resulted in many of these natives becoming Christians, including those who had killed Saint.[3]\n\n\n\n\n\nNate Saint's Family\n\nParents:\n\nLawrence Saint\n\nKatherine Saint\n\nSpouse:\n\nMarjorie Saint\u200d\n\nChildren:\n\nKathy Saint Drown\n\nSteve Saint\n\nPhilip Saint\n\nSiblings:\n\nRachel Saint\n\nSam Saint\n\nPhil Saint\n\nDan Saint\n\nDave Saint\n\nSteve Saint\n\nBen Saint\n\nRecommended Resources on Nate Saint\n\nNate Saint Movies\n\nNate Saint Books\n\nNate Saint Quotes\n\n\"People who do not know the Lord ask why in the world we waste our lives as missionaries.

Rachel Saint lived with the Huaroni two years after he died. She served as a missionary to Peru before later joining Nate in Ecuador. Nate had six brothers and one sister. Nate\u2019s father, Lawrence Saint, was a famous stain-glass artist, who worked on the Washington National Cathedral. His father was also a painter, specializing in landscape painting and silhouette cutting. As a kid, Nate built an 8-foot sailboat and took apart a car engine just to put it back together again.\n\nSources\n\nThis information is provided under the Wikipedia Creative Common License."}, {"url": "https://www.cram.com/essay/Nate-Saint-Research-Paper/F6A49A3F02926351", "page_content": "\n\nNate Saint was born on August 30, 1923, grew up in Philadelphia P.A. and his parent\u2019s names were Lawrence and Katherine Saint.

French explorers and fur traders were trading with the Miami Indians by the 1700s. French records were recorded in Montreal, Canada and will be found in their archives. The Fort Wayne outpost was built in the Northwest Territory by General Anthony Wayne in 1794. Indiana (land of the Indians) become a state December 11, 1816. Allen County was established from Delaware and Randolph counties April 1, 1824. Records that survive prior to 1824 will be found in those counties. There are not many records available for this early time period. Birth records were not required by law until 1882 and were not consistently recorded until the early 1900s. Many early records when they exist were kept by whoever recorded them such as an early doctor or minister of the gospel who usually took them to the last county or state they lived in. As a result, even when physical records still exist, they appear to be lost when stored in different county archives, or not-so-obvious places.\n\nEarliest Known Recorded Births\n\nObviously, the Indians or Native Americans were already here and having children born for generations prior to European settlement. We are not aware of any records for Indian births however. Some early Europeans records survive to this day.\n\nThe Johnston Farm & Indian Agency on Facebook posted that the first 4 of the 15 Johnston children were the first white children born at Fort Wayne to Rachel Robinson and John Johnston appointed in 1802 as the US Factor to the Indians at Fort Wayne.\n\nIf you know of other early birth records for Fort Wayne and Allen County, Indiana, please Contact Allen INGenWeb .\n\nSubstitutes for birth records:\n\nCemetery records found in the office of larger cemeteries can include birth and death information, newspaper obituaries and death certificates. Sexton burial records can often be found at the office of the sexton when a phone number is posted on a sign in the cemetery. Sexton records are sometimes kept by the nearest public business to the cemetery for rural cemeteries. Contacting a local funeral home is another way to find sexton records. Census records have general information listing ages after 1850, with the 1900 census listing the birth month and year Church records for baptisms, marriages, and burials are sometimes available depending on denomination. Records are often sent to the church denomination archive for disbanded churches. Anabaptist churches such as Amish, Brethren and Mennonites generally do not record member information. Funeral homes sometimes have records for older out-of-business funeral homes merged into that funeral home. Similar to doctor and minister records, funeral home records may have been lost when the owner died, retired or otherwise shut down the business. Land and tax records will not give birth information, but can indicate if the parents were living in Allen County. Marriage records in the court house should have birth information for both people. Newspapers often printed birth notices, but they are not indexed or otherwise easily available for Allen County Newspaper obituaries are sometimes the only source of birth or death information with the details ranging from a basic death notice in early newspapers to a short detailed family history more often found in rural newspapers.\n\nNaming Conventions\n\nGenealogy: Naming Conventions posted Jun 2, 2020 by Allen County Public Library on YouTube\n\nWhat's in a name?

A leg injury from a sledding accident caused him some problems while he was in the army. About a year before he was discharged, he almost died while climbing a mountain in Yosemite National Park. After that incident he learned to live life to the fullest. In September 1955, Nate was joined by his teammates, Jim Elliot, Editor McCully, Pete Fleming, and Roger Youderian. Saint finally found a settlement while searching by air. To reach the tribe, Saint and the team lowered gifts to the Huaorani in a bucket tied to the plane. The Huaorani were widely feared by other Ecuadoreans, because they combined a desire to be left alone with a willingness to use force. They attacked and killed any intruders without provocation. Nevertheless, the tribe was excited on receiving the gifts and gave some gifts back. Finally, the missionaries decided to try to meet the Huaorani on the ground. And, on January 3, 1956, using the beach as a landing strip, they set up camp four miles from the Huaorani settlement. Their initial contact was encouraging. However, on Sunday, January 8, 1956, the entire team was killed on the beach (known as \"Palm Beach\") when armed Huaorani met and speared them.

(WANE) \u2014 Nate Moellering, like many others, never looked like someone who was a drug addict, but he dealt with the same struggles many others have faced.\n\nHe was introduced to prescription opioids in high school when he had three separate shoulder surgeries from playing football. He quickly learned the pills didn\u2019t impact his physical pain, but helped his mental and emotional pain a great deal.\n\nHe began to experiment. It started with marijuana and other pills and quickly snowballed. Everything helped his inner demons that worried about what other people thought of him, and what he didn\u2019t like about himself.\n\n\u201cI remember in the same year, I went from a scholarship college athlete to living in a homeless shelter in Indianapolis and doing heroin on the train tracks with someone right above tent city,\u201d Moellering said.\n\nHe\u2019d ultimately overdose a handful of times. His final two overdoses occurred in the same 24 hour period. Both times, first responders had to bust down doors just to get to him.\n\nTo put it frankly, Nate got so low that he had lost the will to live.\n\n\u201cI felt so bad about myself and I felt so hopeless that it was worth risking death in order to just not feel this pain anymore,\u201d Moellering said.\n\nBut the tides started to change for him after that final overdose. Officer Mark Gerardot with Fort Wayne Police Vice and Narcotics decided to go to the call out where Nate had OD\u2019d, despite having worked a full day plus overtime.\n\nGerardot met Nate, and rather than taking him to jail for using illegal drugs, he made a different call. He sat and talked with Nate for two hours about his life and how he\u2019d reached that point.\n\n\u201cI looked at Nate like I was looking at a lot of human beings at the time, which is this is one of my fellow people on the planet and how do we just turn our back on it and walk away from somebody who\u2019s come to this point in their life,\u201d Officer Garardot said.\n\nHaving recently been in touch with an individual who was running a treatment center, Officer Gerardot connected him with Nate and got him to a treatment center in Florida. That person went on to become the owner of Fort Wayne Recovery.\n\nNate figured he had nothing else to lose, so he gave it a try and quickly started to make progress in rehab. He stayed in contact with Officer Gerardot and kept him up to date on how he was doing.\n\nThey formed a bond you don\u2019t often see: a police officer and someone on the other side of the law becoming friends. Officer Gerardot would go on to attend Nate\u2019s wedding, and they\u2019re still friends to this day.\n\n\u201cIf I spent my whole career, and I only helped one person and it was Nate. The difference that has made, has made my whole career worthwhile,\u201d Officer Gerardot said.\n\n\u201cIt means the world to me,\u201d Moellering said of his friendship with Officer Gerardot.\n\nNot only did that night make a difference in keeping Nate alive, it made a difference because of what he would go on to do.\n\nNate\u2019s time at the rehab center in Florida led to a job offer. Nate\u2019s current position is the Community Outreach Director for Fort Wayne Recovery and Allendale Treatment.\n\nHe uses his past as a tool to show people that there is a way out of the darkness. He shares his story wherever he can. He and Officer Gerardot have even done speaking engagements together to show other police officers their success story.\n\n\u201cI think everything I went through was for a reason, and that reason was so I could help somebody else and that\u2019s the whole point of doing this story,\u201d Moellering said.\n\nHe knows the chance of helping someone dealing with addiction is higher when they\u2019re getting help from someone who\u2019s been in that same spot.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not a bad person for struggling. They may have done some bad things, but it\u2019s never to late to turn it around while you\u2019re still breathing,\u201d Moellering said."}, {"url": "https://www.famousbirthdays.com/people/nate-saint.html", "page_content": "About\n\nEvangelical Christian missionary pilot who was killed in Ecuador during the effort known as Operation Auca.

The waters, spanned by 21 bridges, divide the city into three parts. The place was prominent in frontier history. In the late 17th century the French built a trading post (later fort) at this natural stronghold on the site of Kekionga (or Kiskakon), once the chief town of the Miami Indians. It was attacked and taken by the English (1760) and then by Miami and Ottawas under Pontiac (1763). A log stockade constructed in 1794 by General Anthony Wayne after the Battle of Fallen Timbers, near what is now Toledo, Ohio (reconstructed 1975), gave the town its name.\n\nFort Wayne\u2019s industrial growth began with the building of the Wabash and Erie Canal in the 1830s and was stimulated in the 1850s when the railway came. The city\u2019s easy access to raw materials and markets has encouraged the manufacture of a wide range of vehicles; metal, plastic, and rubber products; machinery, including automotive and electrical equipment and parts; and tools and dies. Fort Wayne is noted as a centre of higher learning; its institutions include Concordia Theological Seminary (1846), Indiana Institute of Technology (1930), Indiana University\u2013Purdue University Fort Wayne (1917), and the University of St. Francis (1890).

Missionary supply pilot Nate Saint whistled as he loaded his plane and helped the young boy and his mother aboard. Within minutes after his perfect take-off, however, Nate knew they were in trouble. A strong gust of wind roared over the mountains and slammed into his plane, forcing it downward. Nate did his best to control the plane, but it plunged, crashing into the field below.\n\nNate slowly awakened to the bright light and white walls of an Ecuadoran hospital. His passengers were not seriously hurt, but Nate had a broken back and badly sprained ankle. He would spend the next month in the hospital and five months after that in a body cast.\n\nCan you imagine wanting to fly again after that? The accident did not stop Nate. He could not wait to get back in his plane. He knew being a jungle pilot was dangerous: (fifty-one people died in jungle plane crashes within six months after his accident.) Even still, Nate was sure God had called him to do this work.\n\nSleeping on a Flat Roof\n\nNate Saint grew up near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was a very curious child, much like his grandfather, who was a very successful inventor. As a result, Nate's mother felt it was important to let her children try out new ideas.\n\nOne day, Nate's older brothers asked their mother if they could sleep on the roof of their house. She agreed and had a carpenter build cots and a fence on the flat part of the roof. The Saints spent many nights sleeping under the open sky of their new rooftop bedroom.\n\nTen Year Old Pilot? Well, Almost...\n\nNate Saint was only seven years old in 1930, when his older brother, Sam, a pilot, took him on his first airplane ride. At ten, Sam even allowed Nate to help fly the plane on a short flight. And guess what? Nate decided that day that he wanted to be a pilot when he grew up, just like his big brother.\n\nA Horrible Infection\n\nWhen Nate was 14 years old, he became very ill. The doctor noticed a small, red cut on his leg from sledding the week before. The doctor said an infection had spread from the cut to the bone in Nate's leg. Because there was no cure for infections back then, the doctor prescribed plenty of rest and hoped Nate's body would be strong enough to fight off the infection. Otherwise, he could die.\n\nNate's leg ached so badly, he could not get out of bed for weeks. He spent a lot of time praying, reading his Bible and thinking of inventions. The infection eventually went away, but it would return later and change Nate's life.\n\nWings for Nate\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Nate Saint joined the Army. The world was at war, and he hoped to become a fighter pilot. But just one day before he was to begin pilot's training, he began to feel sick. He noticed that the old scar on his leg had turned red. The infection had come back after five years. Can you believe that? Nate couldn't.\n\nThe army told Nate he was no longer fit to be a fighter pilot. He was very sad, but he didn't stay sad long. Instead, he used his time learning to fix airplanes. He would look for another way to learn to fly.\n\nServing God from the Sky\n\nAfter leaving the armed forces, Nate got his commercial pilot's license, hoping to become an airline pilot like his brother Sam. However, one day a missionary called Nate and asked him to come to Mexico to fix a plane that had crashed in the jungle. Nate went, fixed the badly damaged plane and decided to become a missionary pilot instead.\n\nAs a missionary supply pilot, Nate spent a lot of time delivering food and medical supplies to missionary families. He also flew the missionaries to villages that would have taken them many days to walk to in the thick jungle. In addition, he invented several safety devices to help make jungle flights safer.\n\nNate often had to drop supplies out of the plane while he was flying over a village, because there was no place to land the plane. The goods would often get stuck in the treetops or end up broken on the ground. So Nate invented a way to lower supplies in a bucket attached to his plane by a rope. The bucket would hang completely still as Nate circled overhead, allowing the missionaries to remove their supplies.\n\nNate's Final Flight\n\nOne day while flying over the jungle, Nate noticed a village that he had not seen before. It belonged to a Stone Age Indian tribe known then as the Aucas (Ow-cuz), known now as the Waodani (Wah-oh-dah-nee). The Aucas had killed every outsider they'd found in their territory. Nate and four other missionaries began planning a way to tell the Aucas about Jesus.\n\nFor several months, Nate flew over the village, dropping gifts to the Aucas to show friendliness. After much prayer, he and the others decided to land on a beach near the Auca village. They built a tree house to sleep in until they could see if the Indians were friendly. The Aucas were not friendly, though. They attacked the missionaries, killing them all. U.S. Army officials later went to the beach, found the bodies of the five missionaries and quickly buried them. The Waodani have since become a friendly tribe. Many are now Christians.\n\nNate Saint may not have been fit to be a fighter pilot, but he was more than able to fly for God. Because of his death at the hands of the Auca Indians, many others have been inspired to give their lives to be used by God, too. His sister, Rachel Saint, lived with the Waodani for 40 years until she died in 1994. Nate's son, Steve Saint, became a pilot just like his dad. He and others continue the work among the Waodani today.\n\nMake It Real! Questions to make you dig a little deeper and think a little harder.\n\nAfter the Aucas killed the first five missionaries, how do you think the other missionaries had enough courage to go and live among the Aucas? Have you ever done anything for God that you were scared to do? What inventions do you think have been the most useful for helping to spread the Gospel around the world? Why? Why do you think the Aucas were so ferocious at first and refused the offer of friendship extended to them by the missionaries?\n\nSuggested reading:\n\nNate Saint: On a Wing and a Prayer by Janet & Geoff Benge (Christian Heroes Then and Now series, YWAM Pub.)The Fate of the Yellow Woodbee by Dave & Neta Jackson (Trailblazer Books, Bethany House)Jungle Pilot by Russell T.

Read the last post in the Missionary Mindset series here.\n\nGod uses the smallest details, like the interests and abilities of one man, to bring about extraordinary changes in the lives of many. That\u2019s the story of Nate Saint\u2014a man who soared to great heights to share the gospel in one of the most dangerous parts of the world.\n\nNate\u2019s Background\n\nNate Saint was born to Lawrence and Katherine Saint in 1923. The Saint family was one of faithful Christians who were deeply devoted to living in complete surrender to Jesus Christ. Because of this, Nate grew up with a firm foundation of faith and a lasting conviction to serve the Lord.\n\nWhen Nate was just seven years old, he took his very first flight in his brother\u2019s airplane. A spirit of adventure was instantly instilled in Nate, and he knew just what he wanted to do with his life. He wanted to fly like his brother. Little did Nate know how the Lord would later use his love for flying.\n\nAt 19 years old, Nate joined the armed services to pursue Air Corps training. He desired to serve his country through aviation, and the talent to do so. Though his time in the army took him all over the United States and even across the globe, Nate was never one to lose his spiritual grounding. It was the call of Christ that gave Nate a sense of purpose.\n\nHowever, that purpose was questioned as Nate faced an unexpected trial. While training with the Air Corps, a recurring infection Nate had dealt with in the past came back once again. This infection was quickly diagnosed, and Nate was dismissed from the Air Corps \u2026 crushing his dreams of becoming a fighter pilot.\n\nIt was in this time of hopelessness that the Lord began revealing a much bigger purpose for Nate\u2019s life.\n\nWith more time on his hands, Nate directed his energy towards airplane mechanics. Nate discovered that this skill came naturally to him as he learned to fix airplanes in difficult\u2014if not impossible\u2014circumstances.\n\nNate\u2019s Legacy\n\nAfter marrying his sweetheart, Marjorie Farris, the Lord began opening doors for Nate. Instead of serving just the United States, Nate was presented with the opportunity to serve the nations by becoming a full-time missionary pilot. Without second thought, he committed to this position. Nate and his wife packed up their lives to halfway across the globe to Ecuador.\n\nThe work there was plenty and Nate was equipped and ready to help fly missionaries to various destinations in the jungle and deliver supplies and resources to missionary families.\n\nHowever, in 1948, Nate set off to make another one of his deliveries. Just minutes after a perfect takeoff, Nate knew something was amiss. His plane began to rapidly descend, and crashed in Quito, Ecuador. Even after months spent in the hospital and bed-ridden at home, Nate\u2019s desire to reach the lost for Christ kept him going.\n\nHe returned to his work as a pilot more confident than ever.\n\nIn his faithful and fearless service, Nate helped pioneer missions in hard to reach areas, namely the thick of the jungle. What would take 40 days of land travel, Nate could accomplish within in a matter of hours. This inspired Nate to invent more effective ways delivering supplies and reaching the lost. Among these inventions was the famous \u201cbucket dropping system,\u201d that missionary pilots still use to this day.\n\nThis very system was the backbone to \u201cOperation Auca.\u201d\n\nWhile flying one day, Nate noticed a village he had never before seen. This village was home to the Indian tribe known as the Aucas\u2014a tribe characterized by their violent killing patterns. Despite the prevalent dangers, Nate, along with four others\u2014Jim Elliot, Pete Fleming, Ed McCully, and Roger Youderian\u2014set out to bring the good news of Jesus to the unreached.\n\nFor months, these five men flew over the village and lowered gifts to the Auca Indians as a sign of friendly contact. As the gifts were well received by the tribe, the men began preparation for face-to-face contact.\n\nOn January 8, 1956, Nate flew with the four others to Palm Beach\u2014an area near the Auca village. Despite hopeful initial meetings, all five men were martyred on the beach.\n\nThankfully, the story does end there. Rachel Saint\u2014Nate\u2019s sister\u2014as well as Elisabeth Elliot\u2014Jim\u2019s wife\u2014continued their loved ones\u2019 mission work. By the grace of God and the power of the Holy Spirit, these women were able to bring the good news of Christ to the Auca tribe. Many in the tribe were saved, including six of the killing party.\n\nMore Inspiration from Nate\n\n\u201cWhen life's flight is over, and we unload our cargo at the other end, the fellow who got rid of unnecessary weight will have the most valuable cargo to present the Lord.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf God would grant us the vision, the word sacrifice would disappear from our lips and thoughts; we would hate the things that seem now so dear to us; our lives would suddenly be too short, we would despise time-robbing distractions and charge the enemy with all our energies in the name of Christ. May God help us ourselves by the eternities that separate the Aucas from a Comprehension of Christmas and Him, who, though he was rich, yet for our sakes became poor so that we might, through his poverty, be made rich.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd people who do not know the Lord ask why in the world we waste our lives as missionaries. They forget that they too are expending their lives... and when the bubble has burst they will have nothing of eternal significance to show for the years they have wasted.\u201d\n\nRead the next Missionary Mindset here."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/nate.saint/2095622", "page_content": "Nate Saint\n\naviator\n\nAugust 30, 1923 (age 32) Hershey, Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n\nWhile in the airplane he discovered a love of flying.

One of my favorite memories of Mincaye is when we were taking him back to the jungles after a speaking tour in 2005. My dad was in the copilot seat, I was in the next row and Mincaye was right behind me. It dawned on me, as we were flying out, that 50 years prior to that moment in time, my grandfather, Nate, was flying over those same jungles to try to find the Waodani who were now part of our family. In front of me was his son and behind me was the man who killed him. Only God can write a story like that.\n\nIn a nutshell, what does ITEC do? What sets it apart from other missions organizations?\n\nITEC was the Waodanis\u2019 idea. They told my family to move down after Aunt Rachel died to teach them to do what foreigners knew how to do (things like medical care, dental care, aviation). ITEC develops tools and training systems by changing our tools for a developing world context, trains indigenous Christ followers to meet felt needs in their communities as a door opener to share the gospel, and equips others to do the same both domestically and abroad. This reduces dependency on foreigners and foreign missionaries, long- and short-term, and empowers native peoples to take ownership of their buildings, businesses and projects.\n\nAs a third-generation missionary, did you grow up assuming you would go into missions? How did you go about determining God\u2019s specific leading in your life? What encouragement or advice would you give young adults seeking God\u2019s will in their decisions?\n\nWhen I was in my mid-20s, I told God that I was willing to go anywhere and do anything He wanted me to do except to work at ITEC. A few years later, I erased the line in the sand and said that I was willing to do anything, anywhere (even ITEC) as long as the Lord would show me enough so that I could be obedient. I asked Him to write His story with my life.\n\nAsk God to use your life to tell His story and that you will do whatever He asks as long as He shows you enough so that you can be obedient to whatever is the next step. This does not mean we don\u2019t plan, but we must write our plans in pencil, submitting them to the Lord, being willing to follow Him rather than what we think is best.\n\nWhat role can young adults fill in missions? If someone does not believe they are called into full-time missions, what would you say to them about ways they could still be involved?\n\nThe Great Commission is not a call to some Christ followers, it is a call to all Christ followers. John Piper said that all Christians have one of three roles to play in missions: 1) Go; 2) Send; 3) Disobey. God can use single adults, married adults and families who are willing to be used to reach the world. It might mean to make a lot of money while living a modest lifestyle to significantly support missionaries and missions organizations. It might be as a businessperson who never leaves their country or a doctor who works in their home country but uses their skills to train indigenous Christ followers in rural areas to meet needs in their communities 1-2 weeks per year.\n\nYour family\u2019s story is well-known around the world. What is it like for you to be a part of that legacy? How is your family different \u2014 how are you different \u2014 because of something that happened decades before you were even born?\n\nMany people talk about the legacy I have. Some people ask what it is like to live in the shadow of my grandfather and my dad. I can\u2019t be Nate Saint or Steve Saint, and God hasn\u2019t asked me to be them. But they can\u2019t be Jaime Saint, either. God wants to write my story His way, and I will leave the impact and results up to Him. He is the Author and the Finisher of our faith.\n\nMy family is no different than any other. We are normal people. God chose to use our family to write a story that has been used to challenge people to give their lives to the Lord in service. We don\u2019t get caught up in the hype or succumb to those who would want to put us on a pedestal. We want our lives to point people to Christ, and we will trust Him to use us as He sees fit.\n\nCopyright 2021 Lauren Dunn.

Drown remembers asking her grandmother to tell stories from her childhood in Ecuador, all of which involved snakes, monkeys, and trips on the Amazon River.\n\n\u201cIt was never weird for me to hear the story of Nate Saint,\u201d said Drown. \u201cMy sisters and I would always ask my grandmom to tell us about her childhood in Ecuador. But she never shied away from talking about Nate and the other missionaries. I grew up with a special section on my family's bookshelf full of biographies about my great-grandfather and the story of Operation Auca.\u201d\n\nIt is a famous and inspiring story. In 1955, a then 32-year-old Nate Saint saw the Huaorani settlement in the jungles of Ecuador near Shell Mera, where he and his family lived. Despite the tribe\u2019s reputation for extreme isolation and violence, Saint, alongside Jim Elliot, Ed McCully, Pete Fleming, and Roger Youderian attempted to contact the tribe. Eventually, they were able to interact with three members of the Alca Indians after landing their plane in Palm Beach.\n\nThrough a series of misunderstandings, a group of Huaorani men attacked the missionaries, spearing all five to death on January 8, 1956.\n\nAfter this horrific event, several of the missionaries' wives and sisters, including Rachel Saint and Elizabeth Elliot, radically chose to remain in the jungles of Ecuador with their young children to continue to evangelize to the Huaorani people. Now, over 65 years later, their work has led to the conversion of many members of the tribe, including the killing party.\n\n[Photo Credit: Saint Family] Kathy and Steve Saint, children of Nate Saint, baptized by members of the Huaorani tribe on Palm Beach where their father was martyred\n\n\u201cI think the story is so impactful because it shows redemption at work,\u201d said Drown. \u201cThe men who killed my great-grandfather baptized Nate Saint\u2019s children--Steve and my grandmother--on Palm Beach only a few years later. Mincaye, the man who killed Saint, became like a surrogate father to Saint\u2019s children and is truly part of our family.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Mincaye came to Drown\u2019s family reunion, a gathering of all the relatives of the five missionaries killed during Operation Auca.\n\nBut Sarah-Kate Drown is also the paternal granddaughter of Frank Drown, a missionary who served in Ecuador in the 1950s and was a close friend of Nate Saint.\n\n\u201cMy family has roots in missions in Ecuador,\u201d said Drown. \u201cFrank Drown was on the search party for Nate Saint and the other missionaries' bodies, so both my grandparents actually grew up knowing each other in Ecuador.\u201d\n\n[Photo Credit: Saint and Drown Family] Nate Saint (left), the pilot for Operation Acua, and Frank Drown (right), Sarah-Kate's great-grandfathers, both served as missionaries in Ecuador\n\nDrown and her siblings visited Ecuador and the Huaorani tribe for the first time in the summer of 2021, a year after Mincaye\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cI grew up with an image in my head but staying with the tribe in person was a crazy experience,\u201d said Drown. \u201cIt was bittersweet to finally visit these people that feel like family, to see Mincaye\u2019s home like he had seen ours, but for him not to be there.\u201d\n\nDespite language and cultural barriers, Drown and her family were able to witness the long-term impact of project Acua.\n\n[Photo Credit: Drown Family] .

MAF leaders from Ecuador and abroad shared at the event.\n\n\n\nNenquimo now pastors a Waodani church on the edge of the jungle and shared about how the story of his grandfather and Nate Saint became more real to him as he grew older. Nenquimo eventually decided to become a Christian and help his fellow Waodani learn more about the Gospel.\n\n\n\nAccording to MAF, Chris Nevins, founder of the non-profit group Fuel the Mission, oversaw the construction project, which took four months to complete and utilised about 20 percent of the lumber from the original house. Due to a severe infestation of flying termites in the house, Nevins estimated that it would have collapsed within a year without intervention.\n\n\n\n\"Instead of working 10-12 hours a day on something that doesn't matter that much, this was an opportunity for us to do something that really mattered,\" said Nevins.\n\n\n\n\"This house represents a powerful story that has inspired and encouraged so many people in missions. We know that God didn't want this story to just go away,\" he said.\n\n\n\nDuring the four months Nevins has been working on the project, he estimated more than 400 people from various organisations and mission teams have visited the house due to the story popularised by the 2006 motion picture, \"The End of the Spear.\"\n\n\n\nAs a result, Nevins and his team of eight Ecuadorians and other short-term work crews preserved the front two rooms in the house.\n\nThe radio room displayed prominently in the movie, as well as the kitchen captured in a famous 1956 Life magazine photo, were restored to look much like they did when Nate Saint first built the house in 1948.\n\n\n\nNevins also converted a front storage room into a historical display of MAF and Saint in Ecuador, which includes a display of Ecuador's stamp collection honoring Saint.\n\n\n\n\"We are thankful to God for the team at Fuel the Mission and the many volunteers who worked on the house,\" said Dan Whitehead, the US manager of the MAF programme in Ecuador, adding: \"They turned this building into useful space that will be used for many years to come.\"\n\n\n\nIn past decades, the house was used as a guesthouse and was occupied some 300 nights a year by missionaries going in and out of the Amazon jungle. It now will have one small upstairs apartment, with the remaining space used for meetings and MAF offices.\n\n\n\nFounded in 1945, MAF transports missionaries, medical personnel and supplies, performs disaster relief work, and conducts thousands of emergency medical evacuations in remote areas.\n\n\n\nMAF also provides distance learning services, as well as telecommunications services such as satellite Internet access, high-frequency radios, electronic mail and other wireless systems."}, {"url": "https://www.epm.org/blog/2019/Jun/26/update-mincaye", "page_content": "When I was a brand new Christian in 1969 I heard the story of the five missionary martyrs in Ecuador. It had a powerful effect on my life, one that has never diminished.\n\nSome years ago Steve Saint (Nate Saint\u2019s son) and I became friends. He came to my home church within a week of the 50th anniversary of the death of those missionaries, and I interviewed him and Mincaye, the former warrior who speared to death both Nate Saint and Ed McCully. Steve McCully, Ed\u2019s son, also came to our church that weekend, and after the service we all had lunch together at the home that Jim Elliot grew up in, here in Portland, Oregon. That\u2019s where I met Bert and Colleen Elliot, who I later wrote about.\n\nMincaye came to Christ, and for many years now he has been a transformed man. He is a delightful brother who is a joy to be with. Of all the people I\u2019ve met and spent time with, one I felt the most privileged to meet was Mincaye.\n\nSteve Saint calls Mincaye \u201cfather\u201d and Steve\u2019s children call him \u201cgrandfather.\u201d Years after the killings, Mincaye baptized Steve Saint and his sister, and then years later still, he baptized Jamie Saint and his brother. What can account for the reality of grace and forgiveness and transformation, and the closeness of these relationships, but the power of God and the gospel of Christ? There is no other explanation.\n\nHere is an excerpt from that interview, with Mincaye urging us to walk God\u2019s trail:\n\nAnd if you\u2019re interested, here\u2019s the full video of the interview:\n\nI recently read this update from Joni Eareckson Tada, sharing how earlier this year Mincaye, now about 90 years old (dates of birth were uncertain in his tribe), was fitted for a wheelchair by Wheels for the World, an outreach of Joni and Friends (a wonderful ministry EPM highly recommends). Thinking of time Nanci and I have spent with both Mincaye and Joni stirs my heart!\n\nI\u2019m Joni Eareckson Tada sharing a follow-up to Jim Elliot\u2019s story. You know the background well. In the mid-50s, Jim Elliot and four other missionaries, including their pilot, Nate Saint, left for Ecuador to evangelize the Huaorani, an ancient tribe never reached by man. They made contact with the tribe from the airplane using a loudspeaker and a basket to pass down gifts. After several months, the missionaries decided to build a base just a short distance from the village. Encouraged by one or two friendly encounters, they began plans to visit the Huaorani. Then in January 1956, they landed a plane on a small beach in the river near the village. At first, the Huaorani seemed friendly, but raising their spears, they attacked, and Jim Elliot was, that day, the first of the five missionaries to be speared to death, including Nate Saint, the pilot. It was a tragic massacre, but the blood spilled by those martyrs provided a seed for the gospel to go forth, because not long after that, Mincaye, one of the Huaorani men who speared to death Nate Saint, he became a Christian. The word of God spread and many years later Mincaye became an elder in the village church. He later said of the change in his tribe, \u201cWe acted badly, badly, until they brought us God\u2019s carvings (that\u2019s the Bible). Then, seeing his carvings and following his good trail, now we live happily and in peace.\u201d Years later, Mincaye met the young son of Nate Saint whom he had murdered. Steve Saint and his family had come to live among the Huaorani. Because he had killed Steve\u2019s father, Mincaye felt a special responsibility in helping to raise him. A kinship bond was formed and Mincaye adopted Steve as his tribal son. In 1995 when Steve was older and brought his family to live permanently with the tribe, Mincaye considered Steve\u2019s children as his grandchildren. It is an amazing story of God\u2019s healing, grace and mercy \u2013 this man, Mincaye, who was rescued from savagery and heathenism is part of Nate Saint\u2019s family, the man he murdered many decades ago. I had the blessing of meeting Steve and Mincaye years later at a big event in Holland organized by Billy Graham. And, over the years, we\u2019ve stayed in touch, Steve and I. That is why, not long ago Steve Saint called our ministry at Joni and Friends. He let us know that Mincaye is now 90 years old with very weak legs, unable to walk and he needs a wheelchair. Steve asked: \u201cCan you help us find a wheelchair that would be suitable for rugged terrain in Ecuador?\u201d Well, I tell you what, our \u2018Wheels for the World\u2019 team was happy to provide just the right wheelchair for Steve to take with them to Ecuador for Mincaye. We normally don\u2019t provide individual wheelchairs to people overseas, but this was an extraordinary case. And I\u2019m so proud of our \u2018Wheels for the World\u2019 team because they bent over backward and worked so hard to provide just the right wheelchair. If you\u2019d like to see a photo of Mincaye in his brand new chair, I\u2019ve posted it on our radio page today at joniradio.org. I am also posting a photo of the wonderful Wheels for the World team, our friends and our staff who put this wheelchair together. If the story of Steve Saint or Jim Elliot has inspired you over the years, then you know all about this remarkable man, Mincaye. Please pray for him as it is not easy to be 90 years old and live with pain, especially in a jungle. Pray that his spirits remain bright, and that the wheelchair will be a testimony of God\u2019s grace and provision and that the church in that area will continue to grow. Pray for him and his congregation in Ecuador.\n\nRandy Alcorn (@randyalcorn) is the author of over sixty books and the founder and director of Eternal Perspective Ministries."}, {"url": "https://www.missionhills.org/faith-heroes-pt6-nate-saint/", "page_content": "Heroes of the faith\n\nPart 6\n\nBorn in the Pennsylvania countryside in 1923, Nate Saint grew up in a creative family that encouraged out-of-the-box thinking. Anytime one of their eight children came up with a wild idea, Mr. and Mrs. Saint would enthusiastically help them bring it to life. From an outdoor \u201csleeping room\u201d on their second-story roof to a double-track roller coaster in the backyard, the Saint family was always looking for that next adventurous creation they could work on together. Growing up in such a home, it is no surprise that from the time Nate was a small child he found pure joy in the process of inventing, building, and then using his creations. But he discovered his true passion at seven years old.\n\nMany are the plans in a person\u2019s heart, but it is the Lord\u2019s purpose that prevails.\n\nFrom the moment Nate\u2019s big brother hoisted him up into the cockpit of his Challenger biplane, he was hooked. When his brother let him take the controls when he was ten years old, he decided that no matter what his future held, airplanes would be a part of it. But at 14, a leg injury that led to a chronic infection threatened his future as a pilot. Being bedridden, his family would try to find ways to comfort and occupy him. His older sister, Rachel, would read him missionary stories and his father would often stop in to pray with him. It was during this time that the seed of mission work was planted in his heart.\n\n\u201cHe now has my life.\u201d\n\nA New Year\u2019s Eve church service and a letter from his father changed the course of Nate\u2019s life. In the early hours of New Year\u2019s Day 1945, as he emerged from the Zoller Gospel Tabernacle in Detroit, Nate felt a new conviction to surrender all his dreams and plans to God and step out in faith to tell unreached peoples about the Good News. Shortly thereafter, he received a letter from his father with a news article about a Christian missionary organization that was looking for pilots. Suddenly he realized that God had been preparing him all along for this purpose. In his letter asking to join the organization, he stated, \u201cI have been interested in missionary work for some time, but the Lord owned only my finances. He now has my life.\u201d\n\nThere is no greater love than to lay down one\u2019s life for one\u2019s friends.\n\nNate joined Missionary Aviation Fellowship and eventually moved to Ecuador with his new wife, where they established a mission base at Shell Mera. The Shell Oil company had abandoned this location due to a violent local tribe known to those in the area as the \u201cAuca\u201d which means \u201csavage.\u201d Nate and four other missionaries all felt drawn to these people and prayed for them daily. They began planning ways to reach the tribe. The men knew from the start that this was a dangerous mission, and all agreed that sharing the Gospel with them was worth any risk, even death.\n\nFaith, hope, love\u2026and forgiveness.\n\nAfter a few successful flying interactions\u2014thanks to some of Nate\u2019s creative inventions\u2014the men decided to set up camp nearby in hopes of making physical contact with the tribe. The Auca, or Waorani as they called themselves, misinterpreted their presence and, as was their custom, attacked the men. All five missionaries were killed. But this is not the end of the story. Even in their grief, the families of these men\u2014including Nate\u2019s older sister Rachel\u2014continued reaching out to the Waorani. Through their continued love and forgiveness, many of the tribe came to know Christ.\n\nWhat a rich story of God\u2019s goodness and providence through all life\u2019s ups and downs! And what courage that not only Nate and the other men displayed, but also their families in returning to the men who had brutally killed their loved ones in order to finish the job the men had started!

Saint is named after his uncle who served as a missionary and was martyred alongside Jim Elliot by the Auca Indians in South America in 1956. In this interview, Saint talks about how his faith informs creativity, relationships and problem solving at work.\n\nTranscript:\n\nNate Saint: If you\u2019re a believer in Christ, that comes first. You can\u2019t compromise your beliefs for your workplace.\n\nI\u2019m Nate Saint. I\u2019m the CEO of Iron Mountains LLC. We are a company in Morgantown, Pennsylvania. We have a group of product designers and marketing folks. We develop children\u2019s products: car seats, high chairs, strollers, playpens, that type of thing.\n\nMost of the products that we develop are for the Graco brand, Graco Children\u2019s Products. We want products that serve people well, that make their lives easier, make their lives more enjoyable, and help them raise their families well. That\u2019s part of our mission really \u2013 to make great products that serve people well.\n\nMy father worked for Graco for about 45 years. My dad invented the first wind-up baby swing. It was called the swing-o-matic. It was Graco\u2019s first product in the juvenile industry.\n\nI started off working as a janitor in Graco when I was in high school. When I was in college I would work summers in the model shop at Graco. Then after a few years at Cessna after college I came back to Graco and began working in product development.\n\nThe idea for the Pack-n-Play came from actually one of our competitors. At the time Pack-n-Play was invented there were traditional a-frame play yards, and another competitor came out with a product that was a little bit longer \u2013 it was more rectangular in shape \u2013 but it packed into just a bag. They created a market because we began seeing their product grow and grow. But it had one problem: it had 19 pieces, and it took 5 minutes to assemble.\n\nI think innovation and invention is really spurred by need. So when you see a product that is doing really well and yet it has \u2013 not a flaw \u2013 but it can be improved, that\u2019s what\u2019s driving my mind. How can we take this product that people love the folded size but it takes 5 minutes to put together, how can we make that much quicker and easier to do? That\u2019s the motivation for the Pack-n-Play.\n\nWhen I had time to sketch, I had sketched a lot of different ideas. Eventually one of them is now what became the Pack-n-Play.\n\nWe are really blessed to have great people here. They\u2019re gifted people, skilled people, people who get along well and respect each other. And that\u2019s really important. That really makes for an atmosphere that people can be creative.\n\nI think God gives us the creative ideas that we come up with. I know we have to work hard. You could almost say that God invented creativity. And creativity, I believe, is a gift that he gave me, gave to others in this world. He gave us the drive to create things and he gave us the ability to create things.\n\nJohn would be one of our newer design engineers.\n\nJohn: I design primarily swings. I\u2019ve been working the past 5 years on baby swings.\n\nNate Saint: And then Rob and I have worked together for many years \u2013 probably 25 or so. Rob is a very gifted engineer.\n\nRob: It\u2019s always been kind of an honor to work with Nate because of his nature and because of his ethics. I think he really sets a tone for Iron Mountain. He\u2019s a very kind person and a very honest person.\n\nNate Saint: One of my favorite scriptures is from James. It says, \u201cBut the wisdom from above is first pure and peaceable, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering without hypocrisy.\u201d And then it says, \u201cand a seed whose fruit is righteousness is sewn in peace by those who make peace.\u201d I believe that if we can have a peaceful atmosphere \u2013 not that everything is always going to be peaceful \u2013 but if we can aim toward that, that\u2019s a powerful thing.\n\nThe opportunity that I\u2019ve had to share my faith typically comes when an employee has a difficult situation. They may come into my office and say, \u201cI\u2019ve got problems at home \u2013 my brother is doing this\u2026\u201d So I\u2019ll talk to them about it, and I\u2019ll say, \u201cCan I pray with you?\u201d They typically are open to that.\n\nI grew up in a family that had a lot of Christian ministry emphasis. Christian ministry was highly revered in my family. And so I kind of assumed that that\u2019s where God would take me. And yet I watched my father work in business and I began to realize that maybe that\u2019s a calling as well.\n\nThat was emphasized when I was at LeTourneau, because LeTourneau had a strong emphasis of working out our faith, living out our faith in the workplace.\n\nThere was a time that I was back in my Graco days \u2013 it would have been several times \u2013 where we just had a problem that we did not have a solution for. And maybe we had a production deadline coming up \u2013 I don\u2019t remember the specifics \u2013 but I remember we gathered some of the guys that were Christians and said, \u201cLet\u2019s pray. We don\u2019t have a solution. We\u2019re stuck between a rock and a hard spot here.\u201d And God gave us solutions. And he continually gives us solutions.\n\nIf I create something, if I invent something, my response is gratitude towards God, because that\u2019s a gift he gave me.\n\nI\u2019m excited about the future. Our challenge is, as product developers, how are our products going to reach the consumer? How are they going to decide which product to buy? That\u2019s a challenge we see coming. And we haven\u2019t really figured that one out yet. God willing we will.\n\nI think it\u2019s important that we realize that personal success is not \u201cDid I climb the ladder?\u201d or \u201cDo I make more money?\u201d It has to do with my walk with Christ. Am I fulfilling his calling for me in my life?\n\nThis video serves as an illustration of the power of prayer at work in \"God's guidance in our work (Psalm 25)\" in Psalms and Work at www.theologyofwork.org.\n\nSpecial thanks to the Center for Faith & Work at LeTourneau University.
