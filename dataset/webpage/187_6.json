Lansing Eastern\u2019s Sam Vincent was selected in the spring of 1981 as the recipient of the first award.\n\n\n\nThe Retro Mr. Basketball project, launched in 2010, will span ten seasons. The program is designed to honor the state's top senior prep basketball players from the years 1920 through 1980, In 2010, BCAM recognized seniors from 1920, 1930, 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970 and 1980. This year, the organization honors seniors from 1923, 1933, 1943, 1953, 1963 and 1973. In 2019, the list will be complete, with the total number of \"Mr. Basketball\" award winners numbering 100.\n\n\n\nAs with the modern-day honor, the goal is to focus on high school careers. Hence, information pulled from All-State, All-Area, All Conference and All-Tournament teams is used to guide the committee as they select nominees for the award. Mid-year graduates are considered for the award in their last full-year of high school basketball. (See the 1953-54 class for two examples).\n\n\n\nWhile gathering statistical information on players from the 1920s and 1930s presents challenges, BCAM did not want to avoid honoring athletes from the era when the center jump was a dominate feature of the game.\n\n\n\n\u201cBCAM has considered trying to go back to years previous to 1981 and coming up with players that would have been named Mr. Basketball if there was such an award at the time,\u201d notes BCAM executive director Tom Hursey. \u201cThe Retro Mr. Basketball project accomplishes this goal. The basketball fans of Michigan will enjoy going back in time and either agreeing with or finding fault with our committee\u2019s winners. Either way it will be fun reminiscing about days gone by.\u201d\n\n\n\n(Winners of the \"Retro\" Mr. Basketball award are listed first in ALL CAPS, followed in alphabetical order by those selected by the committee as nominees.)\n\n\n\n1979-80\n\nTIM MCCORMICK \u2013 CLARKSTON, 6-10\u00bd\n\nMcCormick earned top All-State honors from the Detroit Free Press, the Detroit News, and the Associated Press.

It left an impact both in the United State and globally that the game of basketball benefits from today, and put up some insane numbers while doing it.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about the 1992 U.S. men\u2019s basketball team:\n\nMORE: Did Michael Jordan really block Isiah Thomas from making 'Dream Team' roster?\n\nWhy was the 'Dream Team' formed?\n\nBasketball became a sport in the Summer Olympics in 1936, and the United States won gold in seven consecutive Olympics before the Soviet Union upset the U.S. in a controversial 51-50 finish in 1972.\n\nCommunist countries used professional players while the United States played amateur players, and Yugoslavia won gold in 1980 and the Soviet Union in 1988. After the United States took bronze in 1988, and in response USA basketball worked with NBA commissioner David Stern to allow professional players to play.\n\nThat came at the perfect time, because the NBA was full of legendary players at the time.\n\nWhy was it called the 'Dream Team'?\n\nOn Feb. 18, 1991, the Sports Illustrated cover featured five members of the team in Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Karl Malone, Charles Barkley and Patrick Ewing with the words \"Dream Team\" across the front. It\u2019s one of the most iconic covers in the magazine\u2019s history and created excitement for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.\n\nLiving the Dream. This Sports Illustrated cover was signed by six members of the Dream Team (and let's not forget the Admiral): Charles Barkley, Magic Johnson, Patrick Ewing, David Robinson, Michael Jordan and Karl Malone. pic.twitter.com/aSqDsoIv4C \u2014 PSAcard (@PSAcard) March 5, 2019\n\n'Dream Team' roster, 1992 Olympics\n\nThe cover preceded the selection show on Sept. 21, 1991, when the first 10 members of the \"Dream Team\" were announced.\n\nHere's the full roster of the 1992 \"Dream Team\" (in alphabetical order):\n\nCharles Barkley, PF, Phoenix Suns\n\nThe 11-time All-Star won NBA MVP honors in 1993 with the Phoenix Suns.\n\nLarry Bird, SF, Boston Celtics\n\nThe three-time NBA champion and three-time MVP was 35 years old.\n\nPatrick Ewing, C, New York Knicks\n\nThe 7-foot center was a 11-time All-Star with the New York Knicks.\n\nMagic Johnson, PG, Los Angeles Lakers\n\nJohnson, a five-time NBA champion and three-time MVP, played on the team despite abruptly retiring in 1991 after contracting HIV.\n\nMichael Jordan, SG, Chicago Bulls\n\nJordan was a six-time NBA champion, five-time MVP and a member of the gold-medal team in 1984.\n\nKarl Malone, PF, Utah Jazz\n\nMalone was a 14-time All-Star and two-time MVP who ranks in NBA history in points scored.\n\nChris Mullin, SF, Golden State Warriors\n\nMullin was a five-time All-Star and one of the best shooters of the 1990s.\n\nScottie Pippen, SF, Chicago Bulls\n\nPippen was a six-time NBA champion and seven-time All-Star as Jordan's wingman in Chicago.\n\nDavid Robinson, C, San Antonio Spurs\n\n\"The Admiral\" was the 1995 NBA MVP and a two-time NBA champion with the Spurs.\n\nJohn Stockton, PG, Utah Jazz\n\nThe 10-time All-Star is the NBA's all-time leader in assists.\n\nThe \"Dream Team\" later added two more players to fill out the roster, including one player from the NCAA:\n\nClyde Drexler, SG, Portland Trail Blazers\n\nDrexler was a 10-time All-Star who later won a NBA championship with Houston in 1995.\n\nChristian Laettner, PF, Duke Blue Devils\n\nThe lone college player on the team led Duke to back-to-back national championships in 1991-92.\n\nWho was left off the 'Dream Team'?\n\nThe \"Last Dance\" has rekindled the controversy with Detroit's Isiah Thomas, who was left off the team. Thomas was a 12-time All-Star and two-time NBA champion, but a feud with Jordan and Pippen stemming from their rivalry in the Eastern Conference was seen to be the root of the Detroit star being left off the team.\n\nLSU's Shaquille O\u2019Neal, who was picked No. 1 in the 1992 NBA Draft, was left off in favor of Laettner. O\u2019Neal played on Dream Team II in 1996 and still claims that team would beat the original Dream Team.\n\nWho coached the Dream Team?\n\nDetroit coach Chuck Daly was the head coach of the \"Dream Team,\" which made the Thomas drama that much more intriguing. Lenny Wilkens, who ranks second all time in NBA history with 1,332 wins, was the assistant coach from the NBA ranks.\n\nDuke's Mike Krzyzewski and Seton Hall coach P.J. Carlesimo were also on the staff.\n\n'Dream Team' stats: 1992 Olympic dominance, by the numbers\n\nOn June 28, 1992, Team USA opened with a 136-57 blowout against Cuba in the Tournament of the Americas. That showed the Dream Team at full strength.\n\nThey finished the Tournament of Americas with a 6-0 record and won those games by an average of 51.5 points per game.\n\nTournament of Americas\n\nWINNER SCORE LOSER SCORE MARGIN USA 136 Cuba 57 79 USA 105 Canada 61 44 USA 112 Panama 52 60 USA 128 Argentina 87 41 USA 119 Puerto Rico 81 38 USA 127 Venezuela 80 47\n\nThat full-scale domination continued at the Olympics in Barcelona. The Dream Team finished 8-0 and beat Croatia 117-85 in the gold medal game.\n\nTeam USA won those eight games by an average of 43.8 points per game.\n\n'Dream Team' 1992 Olympics results\n\nWINNER SCORE LOSER SCORE MARGIN USA 116 Angola 48 68 USA 103 Croatia 70 33 USA 111 Germany 68 43 USA 127 Brazil 83 44 USA 122 Spain 81 41 USA 115 Puerto Rico 77 38 USA 127 Lithuania 76 51 USA 117 Croatia 85 32\n\nWho led the 'Dream Team' in scoring?\n\nCharles Barkley led the Dream Team with 16.3 points per game and 6.7 rebounds per game. He is best-remembered for his response to a question he was asked about Angola before the first game in the Olympics.\n\n\"I don't know anything about Angola,\" Barkley said. \"But Angola's in trouble.\"\n\n'Dream Team' legacy & impact on basketball\n\nThe Dream Team \u2014 especially the impact of Jordan\u2019s popularity \u2014 helped contribute to the globalization of basketball in the NBA.\n\nForeign players have become a huge part of the game. Yao Ming and Andrea Bargnani have been No. 1 picks, and Dirk Nowitzki and Giannis Antetokounmpo have won the NBA MVP award since.\n\nTeam USA also have dominated Olympic Basketball with professional players. They have won five gold medals since the Dream Team; the only loss coming in 2004 when it finished with the bronze.\n\nThe Dream Team was elected to the FIBA Hall of Fame."}, {"url": "https://www.detroitpslbasketball.com/?page_id=122", "page_content": "Southwestern\u2019s Jalen Rose was a two-time member of the Detroit News\u2018 All-State Dream Team (1990 and 1991).

He had 44 receptions for 922 yards and 12 TDs, averaging more than 20 yards a reception. Defensively, he was in on 86 tackles from his outside linebacker position, making 18 for lost yardage, including 15 1-2 sacks.\n\n\"Rayshawn made a lot of big catches, even in double coverage,\" Sexton coach Dan Boggan said. \"He's a great athlete with legit 4.46 speed and can cover well or play the run.\"\n\nWilborn will play at Central Michigan.\n\nOFFENSIVE LINEMEN\n\nCole Chewins, 6-7, 230, Sr., Clarkston\n\nChewins was a dominant blocker on Clarkston's offensive line, helping Clarkston repeat as Division 1 state champions with an unbeaten record while averaging 37 points a game. He also had 27 tackles at the defensive end and used his size to become a disruptive force, batting down two passes in the state title game win over Saline while also blocking a field goal.\n\n\"Cole was a three-year, two-way starter for us,\" said Clarkston coach Kurt Richardson. \"He's a great blocker and is committed to Miami of Ohio as a tight end.\"\n\nJohn Keenoy, 6-3, 290, Sr., East Kentwood\n\nKeenoy made the move to center after playing tackle his previous three years and was a big reason East Kentwood had its best season in more than a decade, earning a regional title for the first time since 2003 for a spot in the Division 1 semifinals in Tony Kimbrough's first year as head coach.\n\nKeenoy led the way for East Kentwood to average 36.5 points and rush for more than 3,000 yards.\n\n\"He's really smart and we wanted him to play center so he could make calls at the line, change protections and he did a great job for us,\" Kimbrough said. \"He's a special player and his ability to get to the next level as a blocker was huge. He led us to a great run.\"\n\nKeenoy will play next year at Western Michigan.\n\nDavid Moorman, 6-5, 290, Sr., Northville\n\nMoorman was a physical presence on the offensive line, helping Northville average nearly 30 points a game.\n\n\"He's such a dominant blocker, when he run-blocks he absolutely buries people,\" Northville coach Matt Ladach said. \"He's really good in pass protection too, has good feet and good technique.\"\n\nMoorman will play at Wisconsin.\n\nMichael Onwenu, 6-2, 340, Jr., Detroit Cass Tech\n\nOnwenu is a mammoth force on the line, helping Cass Tech pile up huge yards and points, including a path for Mike Weber to pile up 2,265 yards rushing and 29 TDs on the way to a PSL championship. On defense, he causes problems by clogging up the middle.\n\n\"He's big and strong and gives his all while playing on both sides of the ball,\" Cass Tech coach Thomas Wilcher said. \"He is a great player that works hard on run blocking and pass blocking with the ambition to become the greatest.\"\n\nOnwenu already has multiple offers, including Ohio State, Michigan, Miami, NC State and Illinois.\n\nLogan Slaughter, 6-4, 270, Sr., Mendon\n\nSlaughter was an intimidating force on both sides of the ball. A two-year captain, he helped Mendon to a 46-4 record and a state title during his four-year varsity career. He dominated opponents as an offensive lineman and had 51 tackles, nine for lost yardage, including five sacks.\n\n\"We ran behind him most of the time and he collected 28 pancake blocks,\" Mendon coach John Schwartz said. \"He played defensive end and defensive tackle and we positioned him where we felt people wanted to attack. He's also a good student with a 3.9 grade-point-average.\"\n\nSlaughter will play next year at Central Michigan.\n\nQUARTERBACK\n\nAlex Malzone, 6-2, 205, Sr., Birmingham Brother Rice\n\nMalzone completed 64.9 percent of his passes, throwing for 2,998 yards and 38 TDs with just 5 interceptions.\n\nMalzone was at his best against Division 3 state champion Orchard Lake St. Mary's, first throwing for a school-record 419 yards and 4 TDs in a 28-20 Week No. 6 Catholic League win, then connecting on 21-of-27 for 271 yards and 4 TDs in a 35-28 Prep Bowl comeback victory.\n\n\"Alex is a great competitor,\" Rice coach Dave Sofran said. \"He worked hard and was a leader by example. He never missed a practice and would stay after practice to get extra throws in. He made other players better around him.\"\n\nMalzone will play at Michigan.\n\nRUNNING BACKS\n\nAlex Grace, 6-1, 205, Sr., Saginaw Swan Valley\n\nGrace shattered the state's single-season rushing record last year with 2,952 yards, than used his sub-.4.4 speed to set another state record this season by rushing for 200 or more yards in eight straight games, finishing the season with 2,426 yards (10.1 average per carry) and 36 TDs and picking up 7,541 for his career, third most in state history. He also had 32 tackles and five sacks from the linebacker spot.\n\n\"What makes him so tough is his ability to run both physical inside and be able to get outside with his speed and then break away,\" Swan Valley coach Ken Bourbina said. \"Opponents have put nine or 10 in the box and he's still found a way to get yards.\"\n\nGrace will play at Western Michigan.\n\nMike Weber, 5-10, 205, Sr., Detroit Cass Tech\n\nWeber entered his senior season with goals of becoming a 2,000-yard rusher while leading his team to a state championship. He reached one, rushing for 2,265 yards and 29 TDs, but came up short of earning his team a state title. He had a career-high 404 yards rushing and 5 TDs in a regional final win over Chippewa Valley.\n\n\"He rushed for over 5,500 yards and 55 TDs during his career, always working hard to become the best player on the team,\" praised Cass Tech coach Thomas Wilcher. \"He showed the ability to overcome the odds of being a targeted runner, picking up big yards while everyone knows he's going to get the ball.\"\n\nWeber committed to Michigan prior to the season, but then de-committed and will make his announcement during the Army bowl in early January. Ohio State, USC, Michigan State are among the teams still in the hunt.\n\nKhari Willis, 6-0, 190, Sr., Jackson Lumen Christi\n\nWillis had 1,262 yards and 22 TDs his junior season, then more than doubled his rushing total this season (2,810, 31 TDs) while averaging nearly 12 yards per carry. In his final game, a 27-26 regional final loss to eventual Division 6 state champion Monroe St. Mary Catholic Central, Willis rushed for a career-high 420 yards on 50 carries.\n\n\"He's as close to the complete package as you'll ever get and as great as an athlete and player he is, he's an even better person and he's unique that way,\" Lumen Christi coach Herb Brogan said. \"He showed great leadership. He's strong and has great acceleration and we rode him all year.\"\n\nWillis will play at Michigan State.\n\nDEFENSIVE LINEMEN\n\nJosh Alabi, 6-5, 285, Sr., Detroit Cass Tech\n\nAlabi, a three-year starter, helped Cass Tech rush for nearly 3,000 yards this season to earn a PSL championship and a state semifinal appearance. He was also a disruptive force in the middle of the defensive line, making 25 tackles, including a half dozen sacks.\n\n\"He's big, fast, strong and a hard worker,\" Cass Tech coach Thomas Wilcher said. \"He has developed into a great run blocker. He's one of the top linemen to ever play at Cass Tech and is also an excellent defensive player as well.\"\n\nAlabi will play next year at Ohio State.\n\nMike Danna, 6-3, 230, Sr., Warren De La Salle\n\nDanna came back from a broken leg to help De La Salle win the Division 2 state championship. He had 53 tackles in eight games, including four sacks in a district championship game win over Detroit East English and seven tackles and three more sacks to end Birmingham Brother Rice's 33-game winning streak in the regional championship game.\n\n\"He's the difference between us being a good team and a great team,\" DeLaSalle coach Paul Verska said. \"He also played offensive guard for us in the title game. He's a quiet, confident young man who leads by example and when he talks, everyone else listens.\"\n\nDanna will play at Central Michigan.\n\nBryce Witham, 6-4, 245, Sr., Grand Rapids West Catholic\n\nWitham was an impact player on both sides of the ball, helping West Catholic earn a Division 5 state championship after losing in the title game a year ago. He had 81 tackles, including 23 for lost yardage while recovering two fumbles. He also had 42 receptions at tight end for 764 yards and 16 TDs.\n\n\"Bryce was a force on the offensive line and defenses had a tough time matching up against him,\" West Catholic coach Dan Rohn said. \"He's also a fierce pass rusher who often demands double teams.\"\n\nWitham has received offers from Minnesota, Central Michigan, Toledo and Southern Mississippi.\n\nLINEBACKERS\n\nSam Heyboer, 6-4, 210, Sr., Grand Rapids South Christian\n\nHeyboer caused havoc throughout the playoff run for South Christian, beginning with a 12-tackle, three-sack effort in the opener against Allendale and ending with a two-sack, forced fumble performance in the title game win over Lansing Sexton, including a sack which led to a fumble with four minutes left in the 28-27 win. He had 112 tackles for the season, 22 1-2 for lost yardage, 11 sacks.\n\n\"Not very many people are going to be able to run the ball on the outside on Sam,\" South Christian coach Mark Tamminga. \"He's so long and so strong, it's very tough for teams to run on him. He gets on blocks and gets off them so fast, and he's making a lot of big plays. He has become a much more physical player.\"\n\nEric Rogers, 6-2, 230, Jr., Warren De La Salle\n\nRogers was a dominant force, making more than 100 tackles with 15 for lost yardage. He also forced three fumbles and recovered two. He made a team-high nine tackles in the Division 2 state title game win over Muskegon Mona Shores, including a sack, and one stop to keep Mona Shores short of first down yardage on a fake punt.\n\n\"Eric Rogers is a tough, physical downhill linebacker who played all year with a sprained shoulder, playing with pain and never missing a down,\" DeLaSalle coach Paul Verska said. \"He's one of the best linebackers in the state, a reason the mailbox is getting filled with letters every day \u2026 from all over, Alabama, Mississippi State, you name it.\"\n\nRogers, a four-star recruit, is being recruited by several Big Ten schools, including Michigan State. Michigan and Ohio State.\n\nT.J. Smith, 6-1, 205, Sr., Muskegon\n\nSmith had a nose for the ball, getting in on 126 tackles, including 19 for lost yardage and five sacks to help Muskegon reach the Division 3 state championship game. He played well in the title game against Orchard Lake St. Mary's, recovering a fumble on a goal line stand in the 7-0 loss.\n\n\"T.J. started 28 games for us the last two years and led us in tackles both seasons,\" Muskegon coach Shane Fairfield said. \"He's a phenomenal football player and has outstanding football instincts that can't be coached. He was a serious sideline-to-sideline linebacker who was a great cover guy as well.\"\n\nSmith is being recruited by Stoney Brook, Ferris State and other Division II schools.\n\nTyriq Thompson, 6-1, 220, Sr., Detroit King\n\nThompson was an exceptional athlete, showing his versatility by playing multiple positions, including linebacker, tight end and running back. When numerous running backs were out with injuries in Week No. 3, Thompson came in and delivered with 205 yards on 18 carries, also scoring in the same game on an interception return. He had 72 tackles, 12 for loss, including 10 1-2 sacks. He also rushed for 466 yards and 8 TDs.\n\n\"He's a great athlete and has the ability to play in space and stop the run and the pass,\" King coach Dale Harvel said. \"He's versatile and can play multiple positions which makes him special.\"\n\nThompson will play next year at Michigan State.\n\nDEFENSIVE BACKS\n\nDonnie Corley, 6-2, 180, Jr., Detroit King\n\nCorley, who transferred from Wyandotte, had a big season for King at both sides of the ball. He had 62 receptions for 1,100 yards and 16 TDs. On defense, he made 38 tackles and had 11 interceptions, returning seven of them for scores.\n\n\"He's our best receiver, best DB and a very good kick returner,\" said King coach Dale Harvel. \"He does everything at an elite level and has the ability to make big plays in so many different ways, as a receiver, defensive back and return man. He has a great nose for the ball and is very efficient at running his routes\"\n\nCorley has been offered by Notre Dame, Michigan State, Arizona State, Michigan, LSU, Mississippi State, Wisconsin and several other schools.\n\nJohn Kelly, 5-10, 195, Sr., Oak Park\n\nKelly, a three-year starter, was one of most versatile players in the state with his ability to play multiple positions. He ran for 1,312 yards on 138 carries and scored 25 TDs. He was also in on 39 tackles from his defensive back position, returning one interception for a TD. He returned one punt for a TD and two kickoffs for scores.\n\n\"He has great versatility,\" said Oak Park coach Greg Carter of Kelly. \"He might be the best running back I've ever coached and he could play inside linebacker, safety, wherever, just a great football player.\"\n\nKelly is being recruited by Michigan State, Minnesota, Michigan and Western Michigan.\n\nTony Poljan, 6-7, 230, Jr., Lansing Catholic Central\n\nPoljan was a dominant force on both sides of the ball, leading Catholic Central to the Division 5 state championship game. He threw for 2,806 yards and 35 TDs (just three interceptions), completing 65 percent of his passes. He rushed for 1,060 yards and 23 TDs.

He also did a great job on defense and was a physical presence from his strong safety position.\"\n\nPoljan has already received offers in basketball from Central Michigan, Toledo and Air Force and has been recruited by several schools for football as well.\n\nTyson Smith, 5-11, 180, Sr., Orchard Lake St. Mary's\n\nSmith used his speed and great cover ability to intercept 8 passes to help St. Mary's earn a spot in the Catholic League championship game, a loss to Birmingham Brother Rice, before going on to win a Division 3 state championship where he made a tackle for loss yardage early in the game to set the tempo in the 7-0 win over Muskegon.\n\nSmith also showed his ability to be an impact player on offense, catching a 60-yard TD pass for the difference in an opening-game win over Southfield.\n\nSmith will play next year at Michigan State.\n\nATHLETE\n\nD.J.

The Wolves had a target on their back coming in as the defending state champs and won several close games by eight or fewer points, including the 33-25 state title win over Saline.\n\n\"I'm just happy for our kids and our community,\" Richardson said. \"My assistant coaches do a tremendous job and we won this the old-fashioned way, all these kids are homegrown, playing together since they were seven or eight years old and I think that's really something that makes it special. They had great coaching from parents as they came through the program and they're just an outstanding group of kids. They've raised the bar for the younger kids and hopefully this sets a great example for them to follow.\"\n\ndavid.goricki@detroitnews.com\n\ntwitter.com/DavidGoricki"}, {"url": "https://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/high-school/2021/12/09/detroit-news-michigan-high-school-football-dream-team-2021/8857191002/", "page_content": "Your subscription supports:\n\nAccurate, fact-based journalism without an agenda, so you get the information you need to make informed decisions.\n\nAccurate, fact-based journalism without an agenda, so you get the information you need to make informed decisions.\n\nColumns that cover the things that matter to our community, from reporters Daniel Howes, Nolan Finley, Maureen Feighan and Bankole Thompson.\n\nColumns that cover the things that matter to our community, from reporters Daniel Howes, Nolan Finley, Maureen Feighan and Bankole Thompson."}, {"url": "https://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/high-school/2019/04/11/detroit-news-dream-team-all-state-boys-basketball-teams/3438933002/", "page_content": "David Goricki of The Detroit News selects the top boys basketball players in the state.\n\nDream Team\n\nEMONI BATES\n\n6-9, Fr., F, Ypsilanti Lincoln\n\nBates was a freshman phenom \u2014 the top-rated player in the nation in the 2022 class \u2014 who had the flair for the dramatic, knocking down a 3-pointer in the final seconds in a 58-55 regional semifinal win over Ann Arbor Skyline, then tipping in a missed shot as time expired in an 81-79 regional title game win over Detroit Catholic Central. He averaged 28.5 points and 10.2 rebounds to help Lincoln not only win its first regional, but also its first state championship in school history with a 64-62 win over U-D Jesuit.\n\n\u201cEmoni is an exceptional gifted player,\u201d said Coach Jesse Davis. \u201cHe\u2019s as tall as a big man with a skill set like a guard. What makes him special is his ability to put the ball in the basket where he can score at all 3 levels. He plays the game with the mentality of Kobe Bryant.\u201d\n\nDYLAN JERGENS\n\n6-0, Sr., G, Marcellus Howardsville Christian\n\nJergens became the first player since Richie Jordan of Fennville in 1965 to average 40 points when he averaged 40.5 points, scoring 971 points this season (98 3-pointers) and 2,782 for his career, placing him third all-time in state history behind Jay Smith (2,841, Mio, 1976-79) and Mark Brown (2,789, Hastings, 1982-85).\n\n\u201cHe just put a lot of hard work into his game, even when he was in second grade, he played on our sixth-grade team and you could tell he was special, where he hung with them and was one of the better players,\u201d coach Tim Jergens said of his son, who also averaged 6.9 rebounds, six assists and 4.7 steals. \u201cHe could always shoot and just always practiced to get better. When he was in junior high he played on the junior varsity team and averaged 25 points. Then, as a freshman he averaged 20 on the varsity team, then continued to get better, being able to score in multiple ways. He\u2019s a great passer, too, and I don\u2019t think he gets enough credit for that.\u201d\n\nJergens will play at Central Michigan as a preferred walk-on.\n\nMore: Jergens of tiny Howardsville Christian has shot at Michigan career scoring record\n\nCARLOS \u201cSCOOBY\u201d JOHNSON\n\n6-6, Jr., F, Benton Harbor\n\nJohnson followed up his sophomore year where he led Benton Harbor to a Class B state championship with a strong junior year, averaging 30.4 points, 13.3 rebounds, 5.5 assists, three steals and three blocks while getting an offer from Michigan.\n\n\u201cCarlos is a position-less winner who excels at ever facet of a game, a three-level scorer with a college-ready frame,\u201d coach Corey Sterling said.\n\nJALEN TERRY\n\n5-11, Jr., G, Flint Beecher\n\nTerry averaged 22.5 points, seven rebounds, 5.7 assists and 3.6 steals to help Beecher earn a No. 6 ranking in The News Super 20 before a loss to Detroit Edison in a Division 3 state quarterfinal. He committed last week to play at Michigan State.\n\n\u201cHe can shoot the ball from NBA range, he handles the ball very well and can get to the glass,\u201d coach Mike Williams said. \u201cHis athleticism is out of this world, there\u2019s nothing that he can\u2019t do on the basketball court. Every night that we played, it was the other team\u2019s state championship game. We played 26 games and I\u2019d say we played one bad quarter all year. He not only increased his points, but he increased his rebounds, assists and steals and his turnovers went down. He was the key that drove the engine.\u201d\n\nROMEO WEEMS\n\n6-7, Sr., F, New Haven\n\nWeems became the first player from Macomb County to win Mr. Basketball, finishing his career with a 99-7 record, and leading New Haven to a Class B state championship in 2017. He averaged 26.2 points, 10.8 rebounds, 4.2 steals, 3.5 assists and two blocks his senior year to win another regional title.\n\n\u201cRomeo has improved the most over the years with his shooting with his ability to hit the 3-point shot,\u201d coach Tedaro France said. \u201cHe has turned into one of the top shooters around, and becoming a great shooter really took his game to another level with already being able to do so many things on the basketball court. What is unique and special about Romeo is his versatility on the court and his ability to defend and play all five positions at a high level.\u201d\n\nWeems, who scored 2,151 career points, will play next year at DePaul.\n\nCoach of the Year\n\nJESSE DAVIS\n\nYpsilanti Lincoln\n\nDavis, in his fourth year as head coach, guided Lincoln (23-4) to its first league (SEC White) title in 15 years, then first regional championship before going on to earn the Division 1 state championship at the Breslin Center in a thrilling 64-62 upset win over U-D Jesuit, with Jalen Fisher making a 15-footer as time expired.\n\n\u201cThis was a special team mainly because of our experience,\u201d said Davis who added 6-9 freshman phenom Emoni Bates to the mix to get things done. \u201cTahj Chatman was a four-year starter, Amari Frye was a three-year starter, Jalen Fisher a two-year starter and Cam Johnson a three-year varsity player who was a key player as a sixth man.

She scored 41, making 10 of 15 3-pointers in an opening-game 73-70 win over two-time defending Class B state champion Detroit Country Day.\n\n\u201cHer strength is her toughness,\u201d Coach Jarvis Mitchell said. \u201cShe can take the ball to the basket, hit the perimeter shot or find an open teammate off penetration.\u201d\n\nClegg will play at Clemson.\n\nJaida Hampton, 5-11, Sr., G-F, East Lansing\n\nHampton was named Miss Basketball, averaging 15 points and six rebounds to help East Lansing reach the Class A state championship game.\n\n\u201cHer body of work is just so incredible,\u201d coach Rob Smith said. \u201cShe shot 16 percent from 3 (point-range) as a freshman and she was putting up about 46 percent from the arc (this season), and just to see that kind of commitment to growth and improvement has been enjoyable for us and very rewarding.\u201d\n\nHampton will play at Wichita State.\n\nRickea Jackson, 6-3, Jr., G-F, Detroit Edison\n\nJackson has the size to play in the post, the skills to play point and the quickness to score in transition. She averaged 22.3 points, 10.4 rebounds and two blocks to help Edison repeat as Class C state champions.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s so versatile, her length as a guard, her aggressiveness as a forward or a post and she can rebound and shoot, just multi-talented,\u201d coach Monique Brown said.\n\nJackson has offers from multiple Division I programs, including Tennessee, Ohio State, Michigan, Michigan State, Texas and Florida.\n\nKaela Webb, 5-7, Sr., G, Detroit Country Day\n\nWebb averaged 17 points, four assists and three rebounds and was like a coach on the floor for Country Day and showed the ability to take over a game like she did in the Class B state championship-game win over Jackson Northwest. She sparked an 8-2 third-quarter run to open up a 50-39 lead while her teammate Jasmine Powell was forced to the bench in foul trouble.\n\n\u201cKaela was a special player since she got here, had a great attitude, always talked to the girls, tried to promote the right message and her teammates paid attention,\u201d coach Frank Orlando said of Webb, who helped Country Day win three state championships in her four years.\n\nWebb will play at Providence.\n\nCoach: Monique Brown, Detroit Edison\n\nBrown guided Edison to its second straight Class C state championship, avenging its lone loss with a 51-34 victory over Ypsilanti Arbor Prep for the right to raise the ultimate trophy. Edison also owned wins over Class A state champion Saginaw Heritage and Class B state champ Detroit Country Day.\n\n\u201cOur team showed great maturity and a great ability to overcome adversity and with one freshman, eight sophomores, one junior and two seniors our team is still considered young,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe won seven close games, two being in overtime, and we were down in the last minute of the game in four of them.\u201d\n\nMore:Detroit News All-Area boys basketball teams\n\nMore:Detroit News All-Area girls basketball teams\n\nCLASS A\n\n\u25a0Moira Joiner, 5-9, Jr., G, Saginaw Heritage: 16 points, 8 rebounds, 6 assists, 4 steals\n\n\u25a0Jordan Lewis, 5-10, Sr., G, Detroit King: 15 points, 10 rebounds, 5 assists\n\n\u25a0Kayla Luchenbach, 6-2, Sr., F, Clarkston: 14 points, 8.5 rebounds, 2.6 blocks (Oakland)\n\n\u25a0Destiny Strother, 5-9, Jr., G, Flint Carman-Ainsworth: 19.2 points, 5.6 rebounds, 3.4 assists, 3 steals\n\n\u25a0Alyza Winston, 5-6, Jr., G, Muskegon: 21.5 points, 5 assists, 4 rebounds\n\nSecond team: Jasmine Clerkley, 5-10, So., G-F, Okemos;
