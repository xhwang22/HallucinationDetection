According to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, they are going to speak to Dallas Mavericks assistant coach Jamahl Mosley, Milwaukee Bucks assistant coaches Darvin Ham and Charles Lee, and Denver Nuggets assistant coach Wes Unseld, Jr. this week.\n\nMosley and Unseld Jr., are also serious head coaching candidates for the Orlando Magic job, sources tell ESPN. \u2014 Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn) July 5, 2021\n\nOf the four coaches on this list, Lee was not mentioned previously as someone who interviewed with the Wizards already so I will focus this piece mostly on him.\n\nLee is one of the NBA\u2019s rising young assistant coaches, having served with the Atlanta Hawks from 2014-18 and the Bucks since 2018 where they have advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time since 1974.\n\nThat said, Lee is best known as a high school basketball star, where he played guard at Quince Orchard High School in Gaithersburg, Md. and then at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania for college. While at Bucknell, the Bison advanced to the second round of the NCAA tournament in 2005 and 2006.\n\nAfter his college days ended, Lee played professionally in Israel, Belgium and Germany before beginning his coaching career, starting as an assistant Bucknell and eventually to the NBA.\n\nWojnarowski stated (and I\u2019ll emphasize it) that these aren\u2019t necessarily the only coaches who are getting a second interview. They are just the ones who have been \u201cleaked\u201d to the reporters.\n\nHow would you feel about Lee coming to D.C.? Let us know in the comments below.

Read more CHARLES FOX / Staff Photographer\n\nRumor has it -- one certainly worth checking out -- that the Penn Quakers plan to play basketball inside the Palestra this winter.\n\nSure enough, a quick visit last week confirmed it. There were basketballs and ballplayers and even new windows, making the old barn maybe a little more stylish, yet without taking away any ambience.\n\nGo back 19 months \u2026 to the last time any meaningful hoops game was played inside the place. There was no way to know obviously that the cancellation of the 2020 Ivy League tournament would precede the cancellation of the entire 2020-21 Ivy season, the only Division I league to sit out.\n\n\u201cThe Palestra is amazing,\u201d said Penn junior Lucas Monroe, sitting on a bleacher seat the other day. \u201cNo one really got to say their goodbyes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Collin Gillespie back at Villanova\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting on the men\u2019s side is that no opponent can really put a proper Penn scouting report together.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the crazy thing,\u201d Quakers coach Steve Donahue said this week. \u201cOnly three guys played college basketball 20 months ago. A bunch of new guys.\u201d\n\nNew, but not in the traditional sense. Michael Wang is listed as a senior, but he hasn\u2019t played since a flashy start to his freshman year in 2018-19, when the 6-foot-10 forward had to be central to every scouting report, especially after scoring 14 points and adding six rebounds when Penn took out Villanova at the Palestra. That season, Wang was Ivy League rookie of the week three times and Big 5 player of the week once, all before Christmas. Tendinitis put him out for the entire next season, before the pandemic took out another year. What to expect of Wang? We\u2019ll see.\n\nHe isn\u2019t even the biggest mystery. Jonah Charles showed up in 2019 and looked like a game-changer, an instant starter at a wing forward. Then Charles broke his foot in preseason, never played. What to expect? We\u2019ll see.\n\nThen there\u2019s Jelani Williams, who was tagged with being someone special, a guard with a big-time future, except he\u2019s had three ACL tears, going back to his senior year of high school.\n\n\u201cI just thought that he would be the guy we\u2019d build the program around,\u201d Donahue had said last year.\n\nFour years later, maybe he will be. Williams is not only playing, he\u2019s a captain.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely some parts of his game that have benefited greatly from all he\u2019s been through,\u201d Donahue said, speaking about his ability to see a game, and just his overall poise and maturity. \u201cIt\u2019s fun watching him in the last month or so, kind of chipping away at what he\u2019s really going to look like.\u201d\n\nA bunch of the Quakers players stayed in the city last year, finding games where they could, often at the 76ers Fieldhouse in Wilmington, where a strong collection of overseas players was often also there working out.\n\n\u201cOnly three guys played college basketball 20 months ago. A bunch of new guys.\u201d Steve Donahue, Penn coach on his roster of unknowns\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the same, no crowd -- everything that goes into a college basketball game, we weren\u2019t getting that,\u201d Monroe said. \u201cIt\u2019s just pickup, but at least we were able to play with our teammates. We\u2019d have five every time, play with each other, run our stuff.\u201d\n\nThat part is interesting, that they\u2019d try to run as a team.\n\n\u201cMost of the time,\u201d Monroe said. \u201cSometimes they would split us up. They would get annoyed about us, split us up at times.\u201d\n\nDuring the spring semester, Donahue explained that Penn had essentially a three-month training camp.\n\n\u201cThat never happened in my career,\u201d Donahue said. \u201cWe actually got better. I\u2019m curious what I feel about it a year from now. I think the best way to get better is not to worry about games.\u201d\n\nBut, he added, they still mostly scrimmaged.\n\n\u201cWe tried to do as much game simulation \u2026 we did most of our coaching through games, scrimmaging,\u201d Donahue said. \u201cWe figured we played as many as 15 to 18 games, the equivalent. Same this fall. We had referees in twice a week. We\u2019re not just checking the ball up. It\u2019s different, for instance, when there is pressure D, getting the ball inbounds.\u201d\n\nIn some ways, Donahue said, he believes basketball has an advantage over a lot of other team sports.\n\n\u201cThese guys play 365 and they weren\u2019t going to stop because of the pandemic,\u201d Penn\u2019s coach said, ready to see what this all amounts to as the games get closer to counting."}, {"url": "https://pennathletics.com/sports/2019/6/12/penn-athletics-facilities-Palestra-bio.aspx?id=590", "page_content": "True to its nickname, The Palestra is one of the most sacred facilities in college basketball. In fact, no other arena has hosted more visiting teams, more regular season or postseason men's basketball competition, or more NCAA Tournament games than The Palestra.In 1939, the National Association of Basketball Coaches created a single-elimination tournament in order to crown a true national champion. Today, we know this as the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. Since its inception, The Palestra has hosted a total of 48 NCAA tournament games, more than any other U.S. arena, including 5 East Regionals, 12 First Round series, and play-in games on 2 separate occasions:\n\nThe NCAA has since targeted much larger venues for tournament host sites. However, that hasn't stopped postseason basketball from making its way to campus. The final Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) national championship game was held in The Palestra in 1982. Rutgers defeated Texas, 83-77. Several conferences have also held their respective tournaments at The Palestra over the years. In 1985, the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) brought their six-team tournament to University City. North Carolina A&T defeated Howard in the finals, earning them an automatic bid to March Madness. The Atlantic 10 also hosted the quarter and semifinal rounds (as well as first round games in some years) of their annual tournament at the Palestra from 1989 to 1995.\n\n\n\nIn 2017, the Ivy League debuted Ivy Madness, their first-ever postseason tournament to determine both the men's and women's NCAA automatic qualifier. The Palestra was home to the inaugural tournament, where the Princeton men and Penn women were crowned champions. The tournament returned a year later, this time sending the Penn men and Princeton women to the NCAA tournament. After it's second year, the tournament relocated to Yale and later announced that it would continue to rotate between the other Ivy League schools. Prior to the tournament, a one-game, neutral site playoff game was occasionally needed as a tiebreaker to determine who would represent the Ivy League at NCAAs. The Palestra was used as the neutral site on multiple occasions, most recently in 2015 as Harvard defeated Yale.\n\nIn addition to postseason play, many teams have also hosted regular season home games at The Palestra. During the 2008-09 season, Saint Joseph's played all of their home games at The Palestra while Michael Hagan Arena (formerly Alumni Memorial Fieldhouse) was being renovated. Similarly, many local schools, when not playing each other, still host an occasional non-conference home game at the Palestra: Drexel: Robert Morris (2007), Loyola-Maryland (2007), Penn State (2015)\n\nRobert Morris (2007), Loyola-Maryland (2007), Penn State (2015) La Salle: Oklahoma State (2010), Robert Morris (2011), Rider (2011), Penn State (2012), Miami (2015), Bucknell (2019)\n\nOklahoma State (2010), Robert Morris (2011), Rider (2011), Penn State (2012), Miami (2015), Bucknell (2019) Saint Joseph's: Davidson (2004), Ohio State (2005), Penn State (2007), Rutgers (2010), Loyola-Chicago (2018)\n\nDavidson (2004), Ohio State (2005), Penn State (2007), Rutgers (2010), Loyola-Chicago (2018) Temple: Virginia Tech (2009), St. John's (2009), Maryland (2012)\n\nVirginia Tech (2009), St. John's (2009), Maryland (2012) Villanova: Towson (2008), Rhode Island (2008)\n\n\n\nIn 2007, ESPN Classic debuted a feature documentary called The Palestra: Cathedral of Basketball. The film was written, produced, and directed by Penn Women's Basketball alum, Mikaelyn Austin C'04, and traces the evolution of college basketball through the rise of the most storied arena in the country. The documentary features voiceover by NFL Films' Harry Kalas,\n\n\n\nBack to Top Penn State has also brought various Big Ten opponents to University City, including Michigan State in 2017 and Iowa (led by former Quaker, Fran McCaffery) in 2020. In 2018, the Centennial Conference hosted five regular season games in The Palestra. The day featured two men's and women's doubleheaders \u2013 Gettysburg versus Ursinus and Washington College versus Dickinson \u2013 followed by a single men's game between McDaniel and Muhlenberg.In 2007, ESPN Classic debuted a feature documentary called.

In 1968, the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) brought the third annual Intercontinental Cup to Philadelphia. The semifinals of the third annual tournament were held in The Palestra. Game one featured two European Champions Cup teams, as Real Madrid (ESP) defeated Simmenthal Milano (ITA). In game two, Botafogo (BRA), representing the South American Club, fell to the Akron Goodyear Wingfoots (USA), representing the National Alliance of Basketball Leagues (NABL).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2011, the National Basketball Association began a 161-day lockout, delaying the start of the regular season until December 25. During this hiatus, a group of NBA players and supporters organized a series of exhibition games. On September 25, the Battle of I95 took place in The Palestra, featuring Team Melo vs. Team Philly . Comprised of players with connections to Philadelphia, Team Philly included Kyle Lowry, Tyreke Evans, Hakim Warrick, Lou Williams, Jason Thompson, Dionte Christmas, Mark Tynsdale, Aaron Owens, Mardy Collins, Wayne Ellington, and Ronald \"Flip\" Murray. Team Melo, led by Carmelo Anthony, featured those with Baltimore roots: Gary Neal, Josh Selby, Donte Green, and Gary Forbes. Superstars Lebron James and Chris Paul also joined Team Melo as surprise guests. Team Philly defeated Team Melo, 131-122.\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\nIn recent years, many professional organizations have utilized The Palestra as a practice facility. Numerous NBA teams have hosted closed practices at Penn prior to competing in regular season games against the 76ers. In October 2017, the 76ers hosted their annual Blue and White Scrimmage at The Palestra. The event was free to the public and featured various performances, fan contests, and a lot of free swag. Players such as Ben Simmons, J.J. Redick, T.J. McConnell, Markelle Fultz, and more offered fans an exclusive glimpse of the team prior to the start of the season, while an injured Joel Embiid entertained the crowd from the sidelines.\n\nHIGH SCHOOL HOOPS\n\nIn addition to collegiate and professional basketball, The Palestra has been home to various high school competitions. The Philadelphia Catholic League (PCL), a high school sports league comprised of Catholic schools with-in the city and surrounding suburbs, is a long-standing Philadelphia tradition. Since the early 20th Century, the Catholic League basketball playoffs have been held in The Palestra. The annual event features the boy's semifinal games, as well as girls and boy's finals a few days later. Similarly, the Philadelphia Public League \u2013 the organizing group for all public and charter school athletics in Philadelphia and surrounding suburbs \u2013 has hosted numerous boys' and girls' basketball playoff games at The Palestra. PIAA State playoff games have also been held at The Palestra on multiple occasions, including the 1996 state semifinals featuring Kobe Bryant and Lower Merion High School.\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\nMuch like Kobe Bryant, numerous basketball stars have competed at The Palestra before going pro. Before attending the University of Pennsylvania, former Quaker and Philadelphia Warrior, Ernie Beck played at The Palestra for West Catholic in the PCL championship. Overbrook High School brought several future stars to The Palestra, including Wilt Chamberlain, Walt Hazzard, Ralph Heyward, Wayne Hightower, and more. In 2002, a 17-year old Lebron James visited The Palestra with St. Vincent-St. Mary High School. They defeated Philadelphia's Strawberry Mansion High School, 85-47. Many more college and professional stars have showcased their talents at The Palestra in the early years of their careers, and there's certainly more to come in the future.\n\nBEYOND BASKETBALL\n\nBasketball isn't the only sport to compete in The Palestra. Penn Wrestling has hosted their home competitions in the historic arena since its opening. In addition to regular season dual meets, the Keystone Classic \u2013 an annual, season-opening tournament \u2013 has also called The Palestra home since 1995. And much like basketball, Penn Wrestling has hosted several postseason competitions in The Palestra, including the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association (EIWA) championships on multiple occasions.\n\n\n\nIn 1974, women's volleyball was officially recognized as an intercollegiate sport by the University of Pennsylvania. Penn volleyball has called The Palestra home ever since, hosting local, Ivy League, and nationally recognized opponents on the historic court. Similarly, Penn Gymnastics hosts many of their competitions in the Palestra. Fans visiting campus for a gymnastics meet often find the lower bleachers are pushed in, creating more space for the bars, beam, floor and vault. Over the years, postseason gymnastics has also been hosted in The Palestra, including the Ivy Classic championship, the Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference (ECAC) championships, and even the USA Gymnastics Collegiate Nationals.\n\n\n\nThe Palestra has also played host to some miscellaneous sporting events. In 1973, the Virginia Slims World Championship Series made its way to Philadelphia. As the official site of the women's tennis tournament, The Palestra floor was covered with removable, carpet tennis courts. From 1973 to 1979, The Virginia Slims of Philadelphia brought a line-up of female tennis stars to Penn's campus,\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\nThe Palestra has also played host to some miscellaneous sporting events.

The team\u2019s leading scorer, Charlie Lee, didn\u2019t know it at the time, but he was making history as the first Black player to participate in a college game in the state of Georgia.\n\nBy Bob Herzog\n\nNearly 60 years later, pioneer Rhody basketball player Charlie Lee remembers the mystery as much as the history.\n\n\n\nLee became the first Black player to participate in a college basketball game in the state of Georgia when he and his University of Rhode Island teammates faced tiny Oglethorpe University in Atlanta before an overflow crowd on Dec. 29, 1961. Oglethorpe, with an enrollment of only 350, surprisingly defeated the bigger school from up north, 64-47, with Black fans\u2014also attending a college basketball game in Georgia for the first time\u2014among those in the crowd that gave Lee a standing ovation as the Rams walked off the court. Lee, the team\u2019s leading scorer in his junior season but playing that night on a sprained ankle, was held to only 7 points. He appreciated the crowd\u2019s gesture but only much later was he able to appreciate his role and the significance of the moment. Why? Because, according to Lee, he didn\u2019t know he had just made history. \u201cI never knew that it was the first time that ever occurred in Georgia. It never entered my mind. No one told me,\u201d Lee, 81, says in a telephone interview from his home in Raleigh, N.C. \u201cFor some reason the athletic director and the coach never mentioned to me that when we played Oglethorpe in Atlanta, this was going to be a historic event.\u201d Perhaps the University felt the need to protect Lee and his teammates because of the racial conditions that existed in the South in those days and did not want to put undue pressure on the young student-athletes. The reasons for the silence were never made public. But even though Lee said he didn\u2019t know he would be breaking a color barrier in the game, he and the other Rams knew of the segregation that existed then. The point was made strongly the night before the game when a friend of some URI players who lived in Atlanta spoke to the team in the Oglethorpe dormitory where they were staying. \u201cWe mentioned we were going to catch a bus to go downtown, and he said, \u2018You\u2019ll see the white people sitting in the front and the Black people sitting in the back,\u2019\u201d Ron Rothstein \u201964 recalls by phone from his home in Miami. Rothstein, 78, was the Rams\u2019 sophomore point guard that season, and eventually coached in the NBA for 22 seasons, including four as a head coach. He earned three NBA championship rings as an assistant with the Miami Heat, for whom he stills works as a TV analyst. \u201c\u2018The white people will stand in the front rather than sit in the empty seats in the back.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor some today, it may be hard to believe that was the case as recently as 1961. In fact, the first URI player to board the bus, Danny Nilsson \u201964, seeing that there were no empty seats in the front, calmly walked to the back of the bus and sat down among the Black riders. The other four players followed. \u201cBlond hair, blue eyes, milky white skin. That was Danny,\u201d remembers Rothstein. \u201cYou should have seen the looks. But nothing happened. We just got looks.\u201d\n\nRothstein says the players\u2019 friend also told them about something more sinister than seating arrangements on public transportation. \u201cHe said to make sure someone watches the parking lot. If you see buses coming in, it\u2019s the Ku Klux Klan and there\u2019s going to be a problem,\u201d Rothstein says. \u201cWe told the last guy on the bench, who never played, that when we were warming up, \u2018You\u2019re going to be in the lobby until the game starts. If there are buses coming in, you better let us know.\u2019\u201d There were no buses.\n\nRecalling the Oglethorpe game, Lee says, \u201cThere were no incidents before, during, or after the game. No derogatory remarks by the players or the fans, none whatsoever. But I didn\u2019t have the kind of performance that I wanted, and we lost the game.\u201d\n\nLee (foreground) on the court at Oglethorpe University on Dec. 29, 1961. Connie and Charlie Lee at their home in Raleigh, N.C.\n\nLee says he did not learn of his role as a trailblazer until his mother sent him an article a month later from Jet magazine. \u201cThe magazine said it was the first time an intercollegiate sporting event was integrated in the state of Georgia. That was it. That\u2019s how I found out,\u201d Lee says. \u201cSo I didn\u2019t think of myself as a pioneer. Being from the Northeast, it was no big deal playing an integrated basketball game. We did it all the time.\u201d\n\nLee did not see the Sports Illustrated item in the weekly magazine\u2019s Jan. 8, 1962, edition that read, \u201cBefore a packed house in Atlanta, Charlie Lee of Rhode Island made history. The Negro Ram star competed in the first non-segregated collegiate athletic contest in Georgia, possibly opening the way for the acceptance of Negro players on southern teams. Oglethorpe, the host team, beat the Yankee Conference champions 64-47.\u201d \u201cOf course, I feel a sense of pride, but there is a little bit of frustration and anger,\u201d Lee admits. \u201cI was upset that they never told me before or after. Why didn\u2019t they say anything to me? You know something? Nobody made a big deal about that back then.\u201d\n\nBut the media once again helped to shine a light on Lee\u2019s accomplishment some years later when The Providence Journal published an article about race and college basketball, highlighting the importance of Texas Western (now the University of Texas at El Paso) and its all-Black starting team defeating mighty all-white Kentucky in the 1966 NCAA Tournament championship game. \u201cThe paper, says Lee, \u201ctold the story of the all-Black team from Texas that made history, and wrote, \u2018What about Charlie Lee?\u2019 That\u2019s when it came to the forefront for me.\u201d\n\nWith a chuckle, Lee repeats, \u201cWhat about Charlie Lee! When you\u2019re young and na\u00efve, it doesn\u2019t dawn on you. But as the years pass by, it does. You don\u2019t realize the magnitude of what just happened, and the historical perspective associated with it.\u201d\n\nFor the mild-mannered Lee, a native of Englewood, N.J., who is happily retired after a long career working for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, it took until this past winter to share his place in history with his family. But only after an inquiry from his wife, Connie, whose church, the Church of God of Prophecy in Robbins, N.C., was organizing a project for Black History Month in February.\n\n\u201cThe church was doing articles about certain events that occurred in our lifetime. She was asked to think about a significant achievement in Black history, so I said, \u2018Tell them about your husband!\u2019\u201d Lee says with a laugh. \u201cI told her the story and she had no idea. I never talked about it.\u201d\n\nLee, who played for URI from 1960\u201363 and averaged 16 points and six rebounds per game during his varsity career, still laughing, describes his wife\u2019s reaction. \u201cShe was aghast. She said, \u2018Oh, wow!\u2019 and she rushed to share the story with the rest of the family. Some of my nieces and nephews said to me, \u2018You\u2019re famous!\u2019 I just laughed and said, \u2018You know, it happened a long time ago.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut the impact and memories linger. \u201cWhen I told my grandson about it, he got kind of wide-eyed,\u201d Lee says. \u201cHe was ecstatic when he heard my story, and he went right out and shared it with his friends. He\u2019s 6 feet, 6 inches tall and played ball at Fayetteville State. He coached a little AAU basketball and he told some of his coaching friends. That made me feel good; gave me a sense of pride.\u201d\n\nRon Rothstein \u201964 at work as a TV analyst for the Miami Heat. Rothstein (#10) playing against Providence College in the 1960s.\n\nThe events of that winter also gave Lee and his teammates some firsthand, eye-opening experiences about race relations in the South in the early 1960s. A week after their game in Atlanta, the Rams flew to Miami for a game against the University of Miami, where Lee recalls spending much of his time soaking his sprained ankle in a whirlpool. They stayed at the Lombardy Inn Hotel in Miami Beach, and were given most of the week off to enjoy themselves. \u201cIt turns out that even in Miami, they had racial restrictions back then,\u201d Lee says.\n\nThat became quite evident the first night in Florida. \u201cA bunch of us go out to eat, including Charlie,\u201d Rothstein recalls. \u201cWe go walking down the street and everybody\u2019s looking at us. Well, we\u2019re a basketball team. Everybody\u2019s 6-foot-3 or bigger\u2014except me (Rothstein is 5-foot-8). So it\u2019s not unusual to get stares. We go out and we\u2019re walking around town.\u201d\n\nThe URI contingent was unaware that the stares from locals had little to do with seeing a group of tall basketball players. \u201cWell into the 1980s, there was a law on the books in Miami Beach that Blacks weren\u2019t allowed on the streets after sundown,\u201d Rothstein says. \u201cWe go to a place called Wolfies. It was like a Jewish deli\u2014it was a popular spot. We walk in. All the heads turn. We thought it was because we\u2019re a basketball team, but the truth was, nobody ever saw a Black guy in Wolfies at night. It was different times. Everybody\u2019s looking at Charlie. But we don\u2019t know that. We were very na\u00efve. We had no understanding. We found that out after the fact. But nothing bad happened.\u201d\n\nLee says he was unaware that his saga had been told by Rothstein during a postgame segment called \u201cSpeak the Truth\u201d last season on a Miami Heat TV broadcast. \u201cWith all that went on in the nation with the racial strife, they asked each of the broadcasters for a story that concerns racism,\u201d Rothstein says. \u201cThat segment on Charlie was part of a postgame show, and it eventually got to YouTube.\u201d\n\nWhen Lee reflects on those events from 60 years ago, he is touched by the solidarity shown by his teammates on the streets of Atlanta and Miami and by Rothstein\u2019s airing and sharing of those moments. \u201cThe thing I remember about that Miami incident is how upset my teammates were,\u201d Lee says. \u201cOf course it makes me feel good that they had my back.\u201d\n\nLee, choked up, adds, \u201cProbably the most emotional thing for me is the fact that a former teammate [Rothstein] who had a lot of success in the NBA remembered me.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Rothstein\u2019s revelation started a serendipitous chain reaction. Lee and his family got to watch the segment on YouTube and bask in the afterglow of a slice of history that Lee himself could not enjoy the first time around. And Rothstein got to reconnect with a teammate he had lost touch with years ago and did not even know was still alive. The two shared a long, emotional telephone conversation this summer.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t live in Charlie\u2019s skin, so how could I really know how he felt?\u201d Rothstein asks. \u201cWe never gave it a real thought\u2014about race. It was basketball. You go out and play. There weren\u2019t that many Black players then, certainly not like today, but it\u2019s not like I never played against Black players \u2026 I don\u2019t know if proud is the right word, but I was always glad I took part. It was constructive history, so to speak.\u201d\n\nIt is history that still resonates today. \u201cThere is a mix of emotions that comes with learning about Charlie Lee breaking the color barrier for the state of Georgia,\u201d says Shane Donaldson \u201999, URI\u2019s current assistant athletic director, media relations. \u201cOn one hand, it is a point of pride for the University to have a direct connection to such a significant moment in Georgia\u2019s history. On the other hand, it was only 60 years ago. Charlie Lee, his URI teammates, and the Oglethorpe community took a significant first step, but given the social unrest we continue to see in the country today, there is clearly still work to be done.\u201d\n\nFor Lee, the game against Oglethorpe provides a historical footnote to a successful college basketball career that he now can proudly share with his family and friends. He says he is not an intense college basketball fan, despite living close to bluebloods Duke and North Carolina, but pays attention during the NCAA Tournament.\n\nIt\u2019s when watching March Madness on TV that Lee allows himself to rewind his URI playing days. \u201cYou know, I played against some Hall of Famers. I\u2019ll have a conversation with friends and I\u2019ll say, \u2018I remember playing against Rick Barry at Miami. I remember playing against Lenny Wilkens at Providence College\u2014and they had a center named John Thompson.\u2019 When I look back, I realize I had a pretty interesting career.\u201d\n\nOne that made a little history along the way. \u2022\n\nBob Herzog retired in 2018 after a 46-year career as a sports journalist.

As one of the shortest power forwards in the league, yet the most outspoken, Barkley's skills dominated many players. His type of play was more concerned with rebounds instead of points, but he received numerous accolades throughout his career. He played with the Philadelphia 76ers from 1984 to 1992. He retired from basketball in 2000 and was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2006. In his later life, the former athlete still maintains celebrity status with his acts of charity and his novice experience as a sports television broadcaster.\n\nBiography:\n\nCharles Barkley, one of the most well-known yet controversial players in the National Basketball Association (NBA), overcame adversity from the instant he was born on February 20, 1963, in Leeds, Alabama, to Charcey Glenn. As a baby, Barkley suffered from anemia and required a blood transfusion at the age of six weeks. Barkley's parents were very young when he was born and, while he was still a baby, his parents separated and got a divorce. Barkley's mother later remarried his stepfather. Throughout grade school, his mother, stepfather, and grandmother raised him. A tragic automobile accident would later take his stepfather's life.\n\nBarkley let nothing stand in his way as his emotional and economic disadvantages persevered into his teen years. As a heavy 5'10\" child, he fell short in his efforts to make his high school varsity basketball team. This minor setback did not hinder the determined young player; everyday Barkley trained for his next chance to make the squad. When junior year came about, Barkley earned a spot on the high school's reserve team. During the summer before his senior year, he had a major growth spurt, growing to 6'4\", though still small for a power forward. With Barkley's new body, he averaged 19.1 points and 17.9 rebounds a game. These led his team to a 26-3 record and to the Alabama state semifinals. During the state semi-final game, Barkley had 26 points and Auburn University assistant coach, Sonny Smith, recruited the young player.\n\nWhile playing for Auburn junior year, he was named Southeastern Conference Player of the Year while helping the school to its second-best win-loss record in 25 years. In 1984, Barkley was invited to come to the Olympic trials where he made the preliminary squad, but was cut by the coach, Bob Knight, after a few snide remarks made by Barkley about the coach. Barkley left Auburn early after his junior year to enter the NBA draft where he was the fifth overall pick by the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nBarkley joined some of the most well-respected players in basketball history: Moses Malone, Julius Erving, and Maurice Cheeks. With concerns about Barkley's \"uncoachable\" reputation and heavy-set body structure, playing time for the rookie was limited as were his statistics: 14 points and 8.6 rebounds per game. This became an issue as the novice player bumped heads with head coach, Billy Cunningham.\n\nProblems with Barkley's overconfident attitude continued to rise. Remarks made during and after games sparked conflict among teammates and with the Philadelphia fans. While alienating himself from the city and team, Barkley said, \"I don't have to please the public to win, I just have to do my job.\" Luckily for Barkley, he was one player who could back these statements up through his outstanding playing abilities.\n\nBarkley became even more controversial for his views on the status of players in society. He was well known for his view of separating basketball players from role models. Barkley asked rhetorically, \"A million guys can dunk a basketball in jail; should they be role models?\" He further opined: \"I think the media demands that athletes be role models because there's some jealousy involved. It's as if they say, this is a young black kid playing a game for a living and making all this money, so we're going to make it tough on him. And what they're really doing is telling kids to look up to someone they can't become, because not many people can be like we are. Kids can't be like Michael Jordan.\" Mixed reactions came from the public on Barkley's viewpoint. Some felt that Barkley was being irresponsible for not caring about being a role model and others that respected Barkley's forthrightness.\n\nFor a second chance as an olympian, Barkley joined the United States \"Dream Team\" in the 1992 Summer Olympics. This new setting gave the talented player a chance to create controversy at the international level. Barkley created this new spotlight by elbowing an Angolan player and drew a technical foul for talking to fans. He received mixed reactions at these games as fans cheered and booed his entrance onto the court. Barkley was a key asset to the Dream Team as he racked up the most points on the squad and brought home a gold medal.\n\nThough achieving All-Star status from 1987-1991, and Player of the Year honors in 1989-1990, tensions persistently grew after Barkley's first year with the Sixers. After comments reflecting the team in a negative image, Barkley was fined for more than $3000. One of the most notorious and talked about moment in Barkley's career is known as the \"Spitting Incident.\" This occurrence ignited when a fan yelled racial remarks at Barkley and in return Barkley spat at the fan, missing him and hitting a little girl. Macnow and Kram quote Barkley's response in the Sporting News as, \"If I play with emotion I'm a hotdog. That's okay, because I know if I don't play with emotion, I won't play anywhere near my ability. If I play nonchalantly, I can't play right. Am I not supposed to play with emotion?\" In the social aspect, Barkley apologized to the girl and became life long friends with her and her family. For the basketball associating, the act plagued a harmful hype that reflected on the 76ers, and Barkley was traded to the Phoenix Suns, at the end of the 1991 to 1992 season.\n\nWith a blank slate playing for the Suns, Barkley was a perfect fit to the missing piece of the puzzle. His skills meshed well with his teammates, making them a real championship contender. Barkley's first season with Phoenix in 1992 to 1993, showed that Barkley was maturing, not only as he reached a peak in his performance as a player, but as he helped motivate the other players. This time of personal growth eventually helped him earn the league's Most Valuable Player award.\n\nWith talk of retirement to the press, Barkley stayed focused to pursue his goal of a NBA National Championship. In 1993, Barkley met his biggest challenge when he faced friend and challenger, Michael Jordan on the Chicago Bulls. The two-year title defending Bulls initially took a quick two game lead in the series of seven. Barkley did not back down as he led his team through retaliation by winning the next two games of the series. To Barkley's deep regret, Chicago took the series in game six in a blockbuster ending, winning by one point.\n\nThe 1993 to 1994 season, as announced by Barkley, was supposed to be his final year of play before his retirement from the league. However, Barkley had a change of heart and in 1996 was traded to the Houston Rockets where he finished out his final years in the league. During Barkley's last years as a Rocket, he participated in the films He Got Game and Space Jam along with other former basketball players. Barkley retired from the NBA due to a torn quadriceps tendon in 2000 as one of four players in NBA history to attain 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists throughout his career. In 2006, Barkley was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nSince Barkley's retirement from basketball, the star has continued to hold his place in the public eye. His book, I May Be Wrong but I Doubt It was published in 2002. In his book, he addresses weighty issues with a light touch and prefers to stir people to think by making them laugh. There's nothing Charles Barkley shies away from here\u2014not race, not class, not big money, not scandal, not politics, not personalities, nothing. Barkley signed on to host a talk show on TNT in 2003 called Listen Up! In 2004, he was a part of the movie, The Year of Yao. He currently works for the network as a studio analyst for \"Inside the NBA\". He also remains married to his wife, Maureen Blumhardt, with whom he has one child.\n\nBarkley is a known philanthropist and demonstrated his charitably in many cases. As a regular at Saloon restaurant, Barkley struck up a friendship with busboy, Christian Abate. Abate, majoring in education at Temple University, ran into financial troubles and had to take leave from his studies. When Barkley asked Abate about school, the unfortunate circumstance was revealed to Barkley. Barkley made an offer to pay his tuition and by the end of the meal, Abate accepted. The commitment to education is important to Barkley as he has given one million dollars to his high school in Alabama, a million to Corningstone High School in Alabama, and another million to Auburn University.\n\nAlong with Barkley's present endeavors, he has experienced a gambling problem. He admits that he has lost an estimated ten million dollars in gambling. Barkley told ESPN News, \"My agent has really worked with me to try to get it where I can go and gamble and have fun. That's easier said than done.\" Barkley acknowledges that he has a gambling problem, but he can afford it. Barkley makes it clear that he will remain aware of this difficulty and will try to gain more control over it, but he will not completely give it up. Trouble didn't stop with his gambling addiction; on New Year's Eve in 2008, Barkley was arrested on a DUI suspicion in Scottsdale, Arizona, with a blood-alcohol content double the legal state limit. He was ordered to spend 36 hours at Tent City Jail and undergo an alcohol-treatment program. After successfully completing his time, he was released.\n\nHe has also often mentioned the possibility of running for the governorship of Alabama in 2014."}], "Charles Lee was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers in the second round of the 1998 NBA draft.": [{"url": "https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/34136938/sources-los-angeles-lakers-acquire-orlando-magic-no-35-pick-2022-nba-draft", "page_content": "The Los Angeles Lakers traded into Thursday night's NBA draft, acquiring the Orlando Magic's No. 35 for a future second-round pick and cash.\n\nThe Lakers used the 35th overall pick to select shooting guard Max Christie out of Michigan State.\n\nOrlando will receive the better of either the Lakers' or Washington's second-round pick (which is owed to Los Angeles) in 2028, the Magic announced.\n\nThe deal allowed the Lakers to buy their way back into the draft after trading away both of their own picks. Los Angeles' eighth overall pick went to New Orleans as part of the Pelicans' mammoth haul from the trade of Anthony Davis, while the Lakers' second-round pick was moved in that same multiteam deal to Washington before eventually ending up with San Antonio.\n\nThe Lakers also are signing Scotty Pippen Jr., the son of NBA Hall of Famer Scottie Pippen, and Syracuse sharpshooter Cole Swider to two-way contracts, sources told ESPN's Dave McMenamin on Thursday night.\n\nOrlando still had the first and 32nd overall selections in the draft.\n\nThe Lakers' perpetual win-now mentality around LeBron James left them without control of their own first-round pick for the fourth consecutive season, but their acquisition of this high-second-round pick allowed their strong scouting department to make a contribution to that quest.\n\nThe franchise has a solid record of drafting good players and signing quality undrafted talent over the past decade despite meager draft resources. The Lakers have picked up Kyle Kuzma, Ivica Zubac, Talen Horton-Tucker, Alex Caruso, Svi Mykhailiuk and Austin Reaves from the lower reaches of the draft pools over the past six years.\n\nLos Angeles is in need of low-cost roster depth after finishing 33-49 and missing the play-in tournament this year. If Russell Westbrook exercises his $47 million player option, the Lakers will be above the salary cap from their commitments to James, Davis and Westbrook alone.\n\nIn another move, the Cleveland Cavaliers acquired the No. 49 pick from the Sacramento Kings in exchange for the rights to Sasha Vezenkov, it was announced.\n\nVezenkov, 26, was a first-team All-EuroLeague forward this season. He was the 57th pick in the 2017 NBA draft.\n\nThe Cavaliers ended up with four picks in Thursday night's draft: Nos. 14, 39, 49 and 56.\n\nAfter winning just 22 games in 2020-21, the Cavs went 44-38 last season under coach J.B. Bickerstaff and barely missed the playoffs. They made the play-in tournament but lost to Brooklyn and Atlanta. This year is the first time the Cavs haven't drafted in the top five since 2018.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1936111-where-did-all-the-la-lakers-draft-picks-go", "page_content": "Associated Press\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have made numerous transactions with their draft picks in the last decade, but no one is entirely sure where they all went.\n\nChampionship contenders will occasionally make small deals involving their picks because they typically choose late in the draft. In the case of the Lakers, they mixed and matched over the course of the last 10 years.\n\nLos Angeles made an appearance in the 2004 NBA Finals and then opted to dismantle their core in the offseason. Mitch Kupchak traded away Shaquille O\u2019Neal in a move that signaled the Lakers would become Kobe Bryant\u2019s team.\n\nWith Bryant as the focal point of the franchise, the Lakers made moves to build around the 2-guard. It had an uneven record in the draft during the Bryant era, which prompted a few curious decisions.\n\nLost Picks\n\nShaquille O\u2019Neal wanted out of Los Angeles in the worst way, and the Lakers obliged. David DuPree of USA Today provided the details at the time: \u201cO'Neal, disheartened at the departure of coach Phil Jackson and at the Lakers' refusal to give him a contract extension, demanded a trade the day after the season ended.\u201d\n\nThey traded him to the Miami Heat for Caron Butler, Brian Grant, Lamar Odom, a 2006 first-round pick (that eventually became Jordan Farmar) and a 2007 second-rounder (Renaldas Seibutis).\n\nWith O\u2019Neal gone, the Lakers unloaded the elder statesmen on the team in an effort to give Kobe Bryant some young players that could get up and down the court.\n\nCharles Krupa/Associated Press/Associated Press\n\nThus, the Purple and Gold traded away Rick Fox, Gary Payton and a 2006 first-round pick (later became Rajon Rondo) to the Boston Celtics for Chucky Atkins, Jumaine Jones and Chris Mihm.\n\nNeedless to say, Los Angeles likely wants that deal back. The fascinating aspect involving Rondo is that, had the Lakers kept the pick, it\u2019s quite possible they would not have selected him.\n\nPhil Jackson might have found it difficult to incorporate a point guard with no jump shot into his Triangle Offense. Rondo flourished in Boston because they put the ball in his hands, but he would have been a spot-up option more than anything with Bryant running the show.\n\nStill, in the event management brought Rondo to L.A., he probably would have become a slightly better version of Smush Parker for the Lakers. After leaving the Lake Show, Parker had some rather choice words for Bryant and it became a very public feud.\n\nOddly enough, Rondo eventually had a rift with a Hall of Fame guard of his own. Chris Mannix of Sports Illustrated shed some light on the situation at the time:\n\nYet as the years went by and Rondo's role with the team increased, the two drifted apart and the animosity grew. Sources say Rondo's rapid ascension irked Allen, and that as the relationship deteriorated, Allen felt the fallout was spilling onto the court. According to sources, at least once last season the two had to be separated in the locker room because Allen believed Rondo was intentionally looking him off.\n\nRay Allen reportedly departed from the Celtics partly because of his relationship with the former Kentucky Wildcat, per Yahoo Sports' Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nThe real issue for the Lakers is the fact that they lost an asset. Had Rondo not fit in the team\u2019s system, his potential probably still would have attracted suitors. From there, the Lakers could have traded him for another good young player or a draft pick.\n\nInstead, they have nothing left from that transaction, and that is not the only time such has happened. The Lakers also drafted Toney Douglas and Patrick Beverley in 2009 but instead of keeping them, Kupchak traded them both away for future picks that became Andrew Goudelock and Ater Majok. Yikes.\n\nGoudelock suited up in 41 games and is now out of the league. Majok never played for the Lakers. Essentially, Bryant and company got no return whatsoever on their investments, and yet, it would occur once more.\n\nThe front office traded away Chris Mihm during the 2008-09 season to the Memphis Grizzlies for a 2013 second-round pick.\n\nThey never actually received it because Memphis made sure it was top-55 protected. When Los Angeles was not busy making costly decisions such as these, they instead focused their sights on the wrong young players in the draft.\n\nBad Selections\n\nSelecting players coming out of college or from the international scene is a skill. It\u2019s not always evident to figure out which athletes have both the drive to succeed coupled with the talent needed to become a good professional player but some general managers have a knack for it.\n\nThe evidence of the last decade suggests Mitch Kupchak is not one of those types. There are simply too many of his selections that are out of the league.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to pick one or two players and then watch them get phased out because they are not talented enough, but the Lakers have seen this reproduce itself time and time again.\n\nFor instance, the Lakers selected Marcus Douthit in the second-round of the 2004 NBA draft and never saw him suit up once, not even for another team in the association.\n\nJavaris Crittenton was picked in the first-round and is now out of the league. To be fair, his reasons go beyond basketball. Still, look at the rest of guys L.A. picked in the second-round that are no longer members of the NBA (or who have never been):\n\nVon Wafer (2005, 39th overall)\n\nSun Yue (2007, 40th overall)\n\nJoe Crawford (2008, 58th overall)\n\nDevin Ebanks (2010, 43rd overall)\n\nDerrick Caracter (2010, 58th overall)\n\nAlex Oriakhi (2013, 57th overall)\n\nIn addition, the Lakers drafted Darius Morris. He was in danger of not being part of any team this season, but he signed on to play with the Philadelphia 76ers. He was waived early during the 2013-14 campaign and then caught on with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nTo be fair, the Lakers also added players that are still on the team today in the form of Robert Sacre and Ryan Kelly. They are marginal talents likely destined to remain in reserve roles during their respective careers.\n\nThe final \u201cbad\u201d transaction technically has an incomplete grade considering the youth of the athletes involved.\n\nThe Lakers traded away Jason Kapono, Luke Walton, a 2012 first-rounder (became Jared Cunningham) and a 2013 first (Nemanja Nedovic) for Ramon Sessions and Christian Eyenga in 2012.\n\nLos Angeles has nothing left from the swap, which makes it a poor decision. Should either Cunningham or Nedovic actually become good rotation players, it will simply make the franchise look a little worse in terms of their long-term planning.\n\nSmooth Moves\n\nThe Lakers have had numerous misses with their draft picks, but they have also made some moves that paid off. Mitch Kupchak selected Andrew Bynum in the 2005 draft, and his play allowed the Purple and Gold to secure back-to-back titles.\n\nAlonzo Adams/Associated Press/Associated Press\n\nRonny Turiaf, Jordan Farmar and Sasha Vujacic played alongside Bynum, and they provided key second-unit minutes to help the team win championships (Turiaf was only present for 2008 title). The Lakers drafted all three of them and made one big trade that put them over the hump: the Pau Gasol deal.\n\nThe Lakers traded Kwame Brown, Javaris Crittenton, Marc Gasol (drafted in 2007), Aaron McKie, a 2008 pick (turned into Donte Greene) and a 2010 first-rounder (Greivis Vasquez was later selected) to the Memphis Grizzlies for Pau Gasol and a 2010 second-rounder (Devin Ebanks).\n\nThe Lakers gave up two really intriguing talents in Marc Gasol and Vasquez, but one must assume that the Buss family is quite happy with the way things turned out. The transaction was the envy of the league, and it led to LakerLand getting back to the Promised Land.\n\nThe Future\n\nThe Lakers are one of the worst teams in the league, and that might be a good thing, surprisingly. According to ESPN.com\u2019s Chad Ford (subscription required), the 2014 NBA draft might be the deepest the league has ever seen, and Los Angeles has a shot at a lottery pick.\n\nCharlie Neibergall/Associated Press\n\nThat\u2019s a godsend for the franchise because they will clear the books this summer in an effort to acquire a free agent. The Lake Show should have roughly $26 million in cap room, provided they renounce all of their free agents.\n\nA great pick could accelerate the process whereby the franchise becomes competitive again. This offseason is likely the best bet the organization has as it pertains to the draft because their future picks are all going elsewhere.\n\nHere\u2019s a compilation obtained from Real GM:\n\n2014 second-rounder to Milwaukee Bucks\n\n2015 first-rounder to Phoenix Suns\n\n2015 second-rounder to Orlando Magic\n\n2017 first-rounder to Orlando Magic\n\nThe Lakers have a small window to potentially contend with Kobe Bryant. His contract runs out at the end of 2015-16 and it\u2019s safe to say he will retire then. If the Lakers want to give him a shot at a final ring, the upcoming draft is where the future starts.\n\nThe picks in ensuing seasons come with several qualifiers, which means there is a good chance the Lakers will not be adding any young, talented and cheap players through the draft before 2017 potentially."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/36192329/2023-nba-draft-complete-order-all-58-picks", "page_content": "After completion of the NBA play-in tournament, we now know the teams who'll be participating in the NBA draft lottery, giving us a better picture of the complete pick order for the 2023 NBA draft.\n\nThe top three teams on the board and worst three teams in the league this season -- the Detroit Pistons, Houston Rockets and San Antonio Spurs -- each have a 14% chance to land the No. 1 overall pick and the chance to draft Victor Wembanyama. The Pistons are just two years removed from having the top pick, when they selected Cade Cunningham in 2021. The Rockets last had the top pick in 2002 (Yao Ming), and the Spurs haven't landed the top pick since 1997 (Tim Duncan).\n\nOther teams that will be paying significant attention to the lottery are the Chicago Bulls and Dallas Mavericks.

Whether its style of play or the type of players they employ, pro sports is repetitive. A few years ago it was the Miami Dolphins and the wildcat offense. Suddenly, other NFL teams started using it.\n\nIn the NBA, it is small-ball. Pro teams also dip into a developmental program repeatedly for prospects and young talent like when John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Pattrick Patterson, Eric Bledsoe, and Daniel Orton were all selected in the first round of the 2010 NBA Draft from Kentucky University.\n\nPro sports franchises also find themselves repeatedly finding top-notch talent from the same gene pool or families. The NHL had the Sutter brother. There were six of them Duane, Daryl, Brent, Brian, Ron, and Rich.\n\n70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now\n\nThere were the Sedin twins Daniel and Henrik. There is also the Staal brothers Eric, Marc, Jordan, and Jared. In baseball, the Molina brothers Benji, Yadier and Jose all played back-catcher. Joe and Phil Niekro and Justin and Melvin Upton are a couple of other examples of outstanding multiple family members starring in MLB. The NBA has its fair share of family successes and here is a quick look at ten of them.\n\n#1 Cheryl and Reggie Miller\n\nBasketball Hall of Fame Enshrinement Ceremony\n\nA collegiate star at USC averaging 23.6 points and 12 rebounds over four seasons Cheryl Miller has been a female standout in the basketball world. She is a 2 time NCAA Champion.\n\nRepresenting her country, the USA, she has been a member of the USA Women's National Basketball team that won gold at the 1984 Summer Olympics, the 1983 Pan American Games, the 1986 Goodwill Games, and the FIBA World Championship for Women.\n\nCheryl Miller is still the record holder in a number of categories for the USC Trojans. Those categories are in points (3,018, 23.6 ppg), rebounds (1,534, 12.0 rpg), field goals made (1,159), free throws made (700), games played (128), and steals (462).\n\nShe has held a number of coaching positions since her playing days and was the Phoenix Mercury\u2019s head coach and general manager in the WNBA from 1997-2000. Miller has also been a sideline reporter having worked for numerous cable Networks. Cheryl Miller has also been inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and the Women\u2019s Basketball Hall of Fame. Currently, Miller is the head coach for the University of Cal State Los Angeles.\n\nCheryl is the sister of Reggie Miller. Reggie Miller is debatably the best player to ever wear an Indiana Pacers uniform where he starred in the NBA from 1987-2005. Reggie Miller amassed 25, 279 points in the NBA and made 2,560 three-point shots for 2nd all time. He was also a 5 time NBA All-Star.\n\nOne of his many outstanding accomplishments was scoring 8 points in 9 seconds in a playoff game against the NewYork Knicks.\n\nMiller was known for a tireless work ethic and was a difficult man to guard. He constantly ran off of multiple screens to create space for catch and shoot opportunities. If defenders did manage to crowd him, he would find a way to use the defender\u2019s aggression against him and get to the foul line.\n\n#2 T-Mac and Vince Carter\n\n2005 NBA All-Star Game\n\nIn the early years of the Toronto Raptors' existence, the one thing the Toronto Raptors did well was draft well. In 1998, it was the decision to draft and trade Antwan Jamison in the 4th spot of the draft for Golden State\u2019s selection Vince Carter.\n\nHowever, in 1997 the Raptors also drafted Tracy McGrady. Toronto fans who remember those days can only look back now and reminisce on what could have been. These two cousins left NBA fans with many moments of nostalgic pleasure.\n\nMcGrady left Toronto, in the summer of 2000, for Orlando in a sign and trade. While in Orlando, McGrady became the NBA\u2019s Most Improved Player in 2001 and won the NBA scoring title in 2003 and 2004 with scoring averages of 32.1 and 28 points per game respectively. McGrady was also a seven-time NBA all-star but retired from the NBA in August of 2013.\n\nWhile McGrady\u2019s career is over, though it was outstanding, his cousin Vince Carter is now in his 21st season in the Association. While Carter has never won a scoring title, he has had his share of scoring exploits over the years. He is currently ranked 26th all-time in scoring in the NBA, just 51 points behind Jerry West.\n\nCarter has left us with his electric 2000 slam dunk contest victory at the All-Star festivities that year. Carter, like cousin T-Mac, will almost assuredly be honored in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\n#3 Klay and Mychal Thompson\n\nKlay Thompson and Family Discuss their Foundation and Partnership with Opus Bank\n\nKlay Thompson has been starring in the NBA for the Golden State Warriors since he was drafted by them in 2011, after three collegiate seasons for the Washington State Cougars.\n\nSince then, the 6\u20197 shooting guard has become a three-time NBA champion and a 4 time NBA All-star. He has managed to carve out his own space in the conversation for best sharpshooters in the game. His career averages of 19.2 ppg and shooting field goal average of 45.8% overall and 42.2% from the 3-point arc (coming into this season) for his career is outstanding.\n\nHis success is made even more remarkable by the fact that Golden State employs stars like Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala, and Draymond Green. He plays with a lot of superstars of the game and fits right in. For example in the Western Conference Final last season with Houston already up 3-2 and winning game 6 by 17 points, Thompson knocked down 9 three-pointers for 27 of his 35 points to help Golden State stay alive, winning game 6 of that series 115-86.\n\nThompson\u2019s five three-pointers in a win over the Sacramento Kings back on October of 2018 helped put him 21 st all-time on the 3 point shots made list.\n\nHowever, before Klay Thompson began entertaining us with his sharpshooting his father Mychal Thompson had a successful 13 year NBA career. Mychal Thompson, a 6\u201910 center played for the Portland Trail Blazers, San Antonio Spurs and Los Angeles Lakers between 1979-1991.\n\nLike his son, after him, Mychal Thompson won the NBA championships with the Lakers in 1987 and 1988. The Thompson\u2019s are now the 4th father-son duo to win NBA Championships but are the only ones to do it back to back (Mychal 1987-88 and Klay in 2017and 2018). In his career season, Mychal Thompson averaged 13.7 ppg. and 7.4rpg.over 935 NBA contests.\n\n#4 The Curry Family\n\nGolden State Warriors v Atlanta Hawks\n\nThe patriarch of this family is Dell Curry. At age 54 he is a color commentator for the Charlotte Hornets. Drafted at number 15 by the Utah Jazz in the 1986 NBA Draft Dell Curry played for the Jazz, Cavaliers, Charlotte Hornets, Milwaukee Bucks, and Toronto Raptors in his career.\n\nA prospect who played college ball for Virginia Tech, Dell Curry compiled a scoring average of 11.7 points per game over his career in which he played in 1,083 games. He was recognized in 1994 as the NBA\u2019s 6th man of the year when he averaged 16.3 ppg for the Charlotte Hornets. Dell Curry was known for a very accurate shot and a super quick release. He did not need much space or time to let shots fly.\n\nIts no wonder then that one of his sons, Stephen Curry can shoot the lights out and with unlimited range. The 30-year-old point guard was considered too small for the NBA but the 6\u20193 190lb superstar has become a three-time NBA Champion, an NBA scoring champion in 2016, a two time NBA Most Valuable Player award winner in 2015 and 2016, and the NBA leader in steals for 2016.\n\nHe has earned a number of other distinctions but his 10 year NBA career is not over with more chapters to be written as he and the Warriors attempt to three-peat as NBA Champions this year. Before the start of this season, Curry has a scoring average of 23.1 ppg on 47.7% shooting overall.\n\nStephen Curry\u2019s younger brother Seth Curry is also in the NBA currently with the Portland Trailblazers. Seth, after leaving Duke University, has bounced around the NBA a bit having played for Memphis, Cleveland, Phoenix, Sacramento, Dallas, and now the Portland Trail Blazers. So far this season Seth Curry has played in 36 games averaging 17.4 minutes per game and 6 ppg.\n\n#5 The Gasol Brothers\n\nMemphis Grizzlies v Chicago Bulls\n\nPau and Marc Gasol were great national team players for their native land of Spain. After three years playing for FC Barcelona, it was Pau Gasol who made his way to the NBA first getting drafted 3rd overall in 2001 by the Atlanta Hawks who traded his draft rights to the Memphis Grizzlies for Shareef Abdur Rahim. The 7\u20190 center/power forward is now in his 19th NBA season currently a member of the San Antonio Spurs roster.\n\nHowever, along the way he has been named a two time NBA Champion in 2009-10, a 6 time NBA all-star and the NBA rookie of the year in 2002. Besides his two NBA Titles won as a member of the Los Angeles Laker, Pau has a career average of 17.3 ppg. and 9.3 rpg.\n\nHe has played in 1208 NBA games so far. In addition to a good field goal percentage overall for his career at 50%, he has shot a solid 36.9% from behind the arc. Gasol brings an inside out approach to the game and is a skilled big man.\n\nHis brother Marc Gasol, 4 years younger at age 34 has spent his entire career in Memphis where his brother got his start. Marc Gasol averages 15.7 ppg. and 7.7rpg. over his 11 year career with the Grizzlies. Gasol was originally drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers in 2007 who traded his rights to the Grizzlies. Together, the Gasol brothers have played 1,965 NBA games in the regular season and 30 NBA seasons.\n\n#6 The Lopez Brothers\n\nLos Angeles Lakers v Chicago Bulls\n\nBrook and Robin Lopez both entered the NBA in the 2008 NBA draft. Brook was selected first at number 10 by the then-New Jersey Nets and Robin went 5 spots later at 15 to the Phoenix Suns.\n\nBrook and Robin are both 7\u20190 270-pound centers. Brook has had the more distinguished career with 17.6ppg. and 6.6rpg. for his career. Now playing for his 4th team in 11 years, (currently with the Milwaukee Bucks), Brook Lopez has reinvented his game.\n\nA large center he has always been physical around the basket in terms of low post play and rebounding. Brook added a three-point shot to his repertoire of skill sets and it's just deadly accurate. He has shot 34.6%, 34.5%, and 37.4% from behind the arc starting two seasons ago and including this season.\n\nRobin Lopez, since being drafted, has been a solid role player. He has career averages 8.9 ppg and 5.3rpg. Robin also averages 1.2 blocks per game as well. Since being drafted by Phoenix, he has also played for the New Orleans Hornets (now Pelicans), Portland Trail Blazers, New York Knicks and is now in his third year with the Chicago Bulls. At age 30, Robin has seen his minutes per game get cut down to 16.4 from 26.4 minutes per game last year.\n\n#7 The Bryant Family\n\nUtah Jazz v Los Angeles Lakers, Game 2\n\nOne of the greatest all-time NBA players is the offspring of one Joe \u201cJellybean\u201d Bryant who was drafted by the Golden State Warriors 14th overall in the 1975 NBA Draft. He played in 606 NBA games for the Philadelphia 76ers, the San Diego Clippers and the Houston Rockets. He was a member of the 1976-77 76ers squad that competed for the NBA title losing to the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nAfter his final NBA season in 1983 with Houston, Bryant sought basketball employment overseas playing 7 seasons in Europe. After his playing days, he entered the coaching ranks where he has had two stints as the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks head coach\n\nWithout diminishing his basketball playing and coaching careers Joe Bryant\u2019s greatest contribution to basketball is his offspring known as the \u201cblack mamba\u201d, one Kobe Bryant. Kobe Bryant was drafted by the Charlotte Hornets and sent to the Los Angeles Lakers for center Vlade Divac.\n\nKobe Bryant brought championship basketball back to the Lakers in the early 2000s. Overall Kobe Bryant would help the Lakers win 5 NBA Championships 2000-2002 and again in 2009 and 20010.\n\nKobe Bryant was an 18 time NBA all-star, a 2 time NBA Finals MVP, 2008\u2019s Most Valuable Player and he was a 4 time NBA All-Star Game MVP. Kobe Bryant ended his career as the 3rd highest scorer all-time in the NBA with 33,643 points.\n\nOne of his greatest scoring outburst came against the Toronto Raptors in 2006 when he torched the Raptors for 81 points. Kobe Bryant played 20 years, 1346 regular season games and 220 playoff games with a scoring average of 25 ppg.\n\n#8 The Barry Family\n\nSan Antonio Spurs v Atlanta Hawks\n\nRick Barry is the patriarch of an NBA family that has brought fans a lot of great basketball. Now 74 years old, the 6\u20197 205 pounds small forward was drafted way back in 1965 by the then San Francisco Warriors 2nd overall. In a career that spanned 15 years, Barry lit up the score sheets in both the NBA and ABA.\n\nHis NBA scoring average was 23.2 ppg. He also dished 5.1 apg. and grabbed 6.7 rpg. In all, he played in 794 NBA games. Barry was an offensive beast during his time. He was an ABA Champion in 1969 and an NBA Champion and Finals MVP in 1975. Barry was an 8 time NBA All-Star and a 4 time ABA All-Star.\n\nRick Barry had 4 male children. They are Scooter, Drew, Brent, and Jon Barry. All four of his boys wound up playing basketball. Scooter Barry won titles in the CBA (The Continental Basketball Association). Drew Barry was drafted in 1996 in the second round 57th overall by the Seattle Supersonics. Drew Barry would play for the Fort Wayne Fury in the CBA and for the Supersonics, Hawks and Golden State Warriors between 1997-2000.\n\nBrent Barry played in the NBA from 1995-2009. During that time he suited up for the Clippers, Heat, Bulls, Supersonics, Spurs, and Rockets. Brent played 912 NBA games with a scoring average of 9.3ppg.\n\nBrent would join his father in winning NBA titles as a member of the Spurs in 2005 and 2007. Brent was originally drafted by the Denver Nuggets 15th overall in 1995 but was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers. Brent Barry, a 6\u20197 shooting guard had hops too. He won the 1996 Slam Dunk Contest in the NBA.\n\nJon Barry was drafted 21st overall in 1992 by the Boston Celtic. He was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks. Jon Barry, a 6\u20194 shooting guard played 16 NBA seasons and in 821 NBA games. He was primarily a backup guard never actually playing more than an average of 24 minutes per game which he did in the 2001-02 season.\n\n#9 The Walton Family\n\nNBA Finals Game 7: Boston Celtics v Los Angeles Lakers\n\nBill Walton played collegiate basketball for the UCLA Bruins from 1971-1974 before he was made the #1 pick at the 1974 NBA draft by the Portland Trail Blazers. Walton a 6\u201911 center would win two NBA titles in his 10 seasons in the NBA.\n\nHe was also named the Finals MVP during the 1977 NBA Finals leading the Portland Trail Blazers to the title. His second title came in 1986 as a member of the Boston Celtics when he also won the sixth man award that year.\n\nWalton was also named the NBA\u2019s MVP for 1978, was a 2-time all-star and was the blocks and rebounding leader in the NBA for 1977. He finished his career with a 13.3 ppg. average and 10.5 rpg. average. After retirement, Bill Walton has been an NBA color commentator on CBS, NBC, ESPN, and ABC. Since 2012 he has been a basketball commentator for the PAC-!2 collegiate network.\n\nHis son Luke Walton was drafted in the 2nd round of the 2003 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Lakers. Luke, like his father, has won two NBA titles as a member of the 2009 and 2010 Los Angeles Lakers. Always a role player, Luke Walton carved out an 11-year career playing for the Lakers and Cleveland Cavaliers. While Luke\u2019s career totals are not impressive, there is much to be said for a player who can stay in the Association for 11 seasons.\n\nLuke Walton was an assistant coach with the 2015 NBA Champion Golden State Warriors. Further, during the Warriors record-setting season with 73 wins, Walton coached more games 43 than head coach Steve Kerr at 39. Since the 2016-17 NBA season, Walton has been the head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n#10 The King Brothers\n\nBernard King\n\nBernard King was drafted 7th overall in 1977 by the then New York Nets who later became the New Jersey Nets. Bernard King was a 6\u20197 small forward who became a 4 time NBA All-Star. King also was the NBA scoring champion in 1985.\n\nHe played 14 seasons for the Nets, Jazz, Warriors, Knicks, Bullets(now the Wizards), and ended his career in 1993 playing for the Nets again. During his career, he averaged 22.5 ppg on 51.8% field goal shooting.\n\nWhile playing for the Knicks in 1985 Bernard King suffered what should have been a career-ending injury. He tore his knee cartilage, ACL and broke a bone in his right leg. In 1985 he was averaging 32.9 ppg. when the injury occurred. He missed the following season and only managed to play in 6 games in the 1986-87 season.\n\nHis younger brother was a highly touted prospect out of the University of Maryland. Albert King was also drafted 10th overall in 1981 by the New Jersey Nets. Albert King spent 9 years of his 11-year career in the NBA with a 12.1 ppg. average.\n\nAfter 6 seasons in New Jersey, he spent one season each with Philadelphia, San Antonio and wound up his career after one season in Washington. In 1989 after the NBA season he signed with Italian basketball club Olimpia Milano winning a title there.\n\nThere are a number of other families that have put in outstanding work in the NBA. Dominique and Gerald Wilkins, Ed and George Mikan, Horace and Harvey Grant, Jim and John Paxton, and Chuck and Wesley Person are just a few of the other families considered when thinking about this topic.\n\nThis was by no means an exhaustive list and was compiled in no particular order. However, it was an interesting look at past and present stars of the NBA and how the Association among other sports leagues fish in the same pool over and over looking for talent. In this case, it\u2019s the same gene pool.\n\nPoll : 0 votes"}, {"url": "https://nba.nbcsports.com/2022/05/13/add-bucks-assistant-charles-lee-to-list-of-lakers-coaching-candidates/", "page_content": "MIAMI \u2014 Erik Spoelstra, Michael Malone, and their staffs have been pouring over film and losing sleep, trying to come up with adjustments. Minor tweaks that can give their team even a little edge.\n\nBut four games into a series, there are not a lot of secrets left. Everyone knows what is coming. It is often more about execution and effort over adjustments.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a little bit of both,\u201d the Heat\u2019s Haywood Highsmith said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely some things we can adjust on, and then it\u2019s also about a little bit more effort and just doing more.

Somehow.\n\nDenver\u2019s defense has been impressive in these Finals, holding Miami to a 111.1 offensive rating through three games (for comparison, that is 7.2 below their offensive rating against Boston).\n\nPart of the reason is that Nikola Joki\u0107 can be a better rim protector and defensive player than people give him credit for. Another key is Malone has been able to lean hard into more defensive-based lineups because the two-man game of Jamal Murray and Joki\u0107 has been all the offense the Nuggets need.\n\nThe Murray/Jokic pick-and-roll has been a masterclass in this series \u2014 the Nuggets have a 126 offensive rating this series when running that play. In Game 3, the Denver stars ran 32 pick-and-rolls, and those plays were the foundation of each of them getting a 30-point triple-double (the first teammates to have a 30+ point triple-double in any NBA game).\n\nNikola Jokic and Jamal Murray are the first pair of teammates with triple-doubles in Finals history! Jokic: 32 PTS, 21 REB, 10 AST\n\nMurray: 34 PTS, 10 REB, 10 AST DEN/MIA Game 4: Friday, 8:30pm/et on ABC pic.twitter.com/0hLcPvv0zN \u2014 NBA (@NBA) June 8, 2023\n\n\u201cI mean, the Murray/Jokic two-man game is a pretty hard action to stop,\u201d Haywood Highsmith said. \u201cBut we got great defensive players, got some of the great two-way players in this game, Jimmy [Butler] and Bam [Adebayo], so we\u2019re gonna figure it out. We got a lot of different bodies we can throw at Murray as well.\u201d\n\nMiami may need to sell out to stop Joki\u0107 and Murray and force any other Nugget to beat them. The Heat did blitz the pick-and-roll more in the fourth quarter of Game 3, but that led to Christian Braun cuts to the basket and Denver buckets. Miami may have to live with some of that, they have to keep Murray in particular in check (it feels like Joki\u0107 will get his no matter what).\n\n\u201cWhatever you do, you just can\u2019t do it all the time,\u201d Spoelstra said of defending the Nuggets duo. \u201cThere\u2019s no absolutes when you get to this level. It\u2019s the highest level of competition. You\u2019re getting the highest level of execution. Understanding what they\u2019re trying to get to, and we try to get them out of their comfort zones as much as possible.\n\n\u201cThe first half, they really got to that two-man action quite a bit. They were getting a lot of traction, so they didn\u2019t need to go to any other part of their playbook.\u201d\n\nMiami needs to see the rest of that playbook.\n\n2) Miami has to make shots, rebound, set defense\n\nThe best way for Miami to limit the Jokic/Murray action and the Denver offense in general is to slow the game down. Make them go against a set defense every time down. That didn\u2019t happen enough in Game 3 \u2014 Denver was free-flowing on offense when Miami needs the game played in the mud.\n\nFor the Heat to change that dynamic two key things need to happen.\n\nFirst, Miami has to make shots. It\u2019s simplistic but it\u2019s true. Denver isn\u2019t going to run if they are taking the ball out of the net.\n\nThat starts with 3-pointers, because as has been noted everywhere the Heat are 6-1 when they shoot 45% or better from 3 this postseason (including Game 2 against the Nuggets), and unreasonably hot shooting has sustained their run to the Finals. The Heat starters were 5-of-19 (26.3%) from beyond the arc in Game 3, which is simply not good enough \u2014 Max Strus, Gabe Vincent and the rest of the role players must step up and knock down shots. However, the bigger concern in Game 3 was the Heat shooting 38.2% within eight feet of the basket. The Nuggets\u2019 size is clearly bothering the Heat. Jimmy Butler needs to get downhill and then make the shots, Bam Adebayo has to get the floater to fall, and the Heat need to attack and get to the free throw line.\n\nSecond, the Heat can\u2019t let the Nuggets win the rebounding battle by 25. Denver\u2019s size advantage has played out in this series in many ways (including how they contested 3s in Game 3), but it is most clearly on the glass. Miami is getting one shot and they\u2019re done, but the Nuggets grabbed the offensive rebound on 36.1% of their missed shots in Game 3, and if you give them that many second chances you will pay.\n\nIt will take gang rebounding and effort, but the Heat must be stronger on the glass.\n\n3) Vaughn Dalzell\u2019s betting recommendations\n\nOver/Under: The total continues to drop from game-by-game starting at 219.5 then going from 216.5 to 214.5 and now 210.5 for Game 4. Denver and Miami have struggled with consistency when it comes to scoring, Miami a little more than Denver. The Nuggets are shooting 51% to Miami\u2019s 41% from the field and averaging 10 more free-throw attempts per game. The pace and tempo of this series has barely changed through three games and if it wasn\u2019t for Miami\u2019s 38-point fourth quarter in Game 2, the Under would be 3-0 in this NBA Finals. I will keep riding the Under.\n\nPlayer Props: In this series there have been four players worth betting overs; Jamal Murray, Nikola Jokic, Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo. On the other hand, there have been some very good fade prospects for unders such as Kevin Love, Max Strus, Caleb Martin, Michael Porter Jr. and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who are all shooting 31% or worse from the field. When betting player props in the NBA Finals, keep it simple stupid (KISS).\n\n(Check out more from Dalzell and the team at NBC Sports Edge.)"}, {"url": "https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2022/5/12/23068924/lakers-charles-lee-head-coach-interview-permission-bucks-assistant-report", "page_content": "The Los Angeles Lakers have added another Milwaukee Bucks assistant coach to their list of candidates for their head coach opening as they have requested to interview Charles Lee, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic. The team also previously requested and was granted permission to interview Darvin Ham, also on the Bucks coaching staff.\n\nThe Lakers have requested permission to interview Milwaukee Bucks assistant Charles Lee for their head coaching job, sources tell @TheAthletic @Stadium. \u2014 Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) May 12, 2022\n\nLee may be the less-heralded of the Bucks assistants between him and Ham but he has still had more than his fair share of interviews over recent seasons and is certainly qualified to take the next step. This offseason, Lee has interviewed with the Hornets for their coaching vacancy but was more notably considered one of the frontrunners for the Pelicans head coach position last offseason. Reports indicated that the decision for New Orleans came down to Willie Green and Lee.\n\nUnlike his colleague Ham, Lee is not a former NBA player. After a four-year career at Bucknell, he spent four years playing overseas before returning to his alma mater as an assistant coach in 2012. Lee would join Mike Budenholzer\u2019s staff in Atlanta in 2014 and stayed on his staff in the transition to Milwaukee.\n\nKevin Pelton of ESPN included Lee in his recent annual look at the top NBA coaching prospects:\n\nAnother Bucks assistant, Charles Lee, has established himself as a multitool coach who projects confidence, emotional and tactical intelligence and affability. Colleagues marvel at his ability to relate to everyone, be it a two-way player (Lee played professionally overseas for four seasons) to an owner (he worked as a trader on Wall Street). A number of executives and coaches say that had Lee played one minute in the NBA (or had NBA bloodlines), he\u2019d be gainfully employed as a head coach today. Such is the case in the NBA circa 2022, where owners and front offices increasingly favor those who have an NBA entry on Basketball Reference.\n\nLee also sat down with Mike Vorkunov of The Athletic in March as part of their \u201cNBA 40 under 40\u201d series to discuss his desire to become an NBA head coach.\n\nFor the Lakers, Lee becomes the sixth coach the team has reportedly sought to interview, joining Warriors assistant Kenny Atkinson as the latest on that list. He\u2019s also the fourth assistant coach \u2014 joining Ham, Atkinson and Adrian Griffin \u2014 the team has reached out to.\n\nFor more Lakers talk, subscribe to the Silver Screen and Roll podcast feed on iTunes, Spotify, Stitcher or Google Podcasts.

He mostly started with the Lakers, but coming off the bench has increased his impact. Clarkson averaged 18.4 points, 4.0 rebounds and 2.5 assists in 68 games this season, only one of which he started.\n\nNew York Knicks forward Julius Randle was named the 2021 Most Improved Player and an NBA All-Star. Randle always had the mentality and the physicality to hold his own, but developing more offensive moves has made him an undeniable threat that fans, players and coaches bore witness to heading into the playoffs. Randle led the Knicks to their first playoff appearance since the 2013-14 season.\n\nLakers Lakers look to answer Suns\u2019 effort, energy in Game 2 The Phoenix Suns issued a warning to the Lakers in Game 1: be ready or be left behind. The Lakers expect to improve in Game 2 on Tuesday.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans forward Brandon Ingram was named the NBA most improved player and an All-Star in 2020. Ingram had the length and athleticism to play in the league when the Lakers drafted him No. 2 overall in 2016, but by adding muscle and more shot attempts to his resum\u00e9, he elevated his game. Although the Pelicans failed to reach the playoffs in 2021, they have created a new young core that includes Zion Williamson along with former Lakers Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart and Ingram.\n\nIn 2019, guard D\u2019Angelo Russell was named an NBA All-Star as a part of the Brooklyn Nets. Russell, now with the Minnesota Timberwolves, has always been a prominent scoring threat, especially from long range. Adding the ability to attack the basket and create for his teammates has rounded out his game.\n\nRussell has been around the league, playing with the Nets, the Golden State Warriors and the Timberwolves since leaving the Lakers. His stint with the Warriors was an attempt to alleviate the stress of not having Klay Thompson in the lineup and creating the possibility of a third splash brother. But, that didn\u2019t last long as he played only 33 games before being traded to Minnesota. Russell did average the most points of his career (23.6) with the Warriors. Russell\u2019s career averages sit at 17.6 PPG, 3.6 RPG and 5.3 APG.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe young core has grown enormously after leaving the Lakers, proving themselves to be valuable NBA players with bright futures.\n\nPlayers drafted by the Lakers since 2014 now playing for other teams\n\nLonzo Ball, Pelicans: Drafted No. 2 overall in 2017; Traded with Ingram, Hart and first-round picks to the Pelicans in a three-way deal for Anthony Davis in 2019.\n\nThomas Bryant, Wizards: Drafted No. 42 in 2017; Waived in 2018.\n\nJordan Clarkson, Jazz: Drafted No. 46 in 2014; Traded to the Cavaliers in 2018.\n\nJosh Hart, Pelicans: Drafted No. 30 in 2017; Traded to the Pelicans in the three-way deal for Davis in 2019.\n\nBrandon Ingram, Pelicans: Drafted No. 2 overall in 2016; Traded to the Pelicans for Davis in 2019.\n\nSvi Mykhailiuk, Thunder: Drafted No. 47 in 2018; Traded with a second-round pick to the Pistons for Reggie Bullock in 2018.\n\nLarry Nance Jr., Cavaliers: Drafted No. 27 in 2015; Traded with Clarkson to the Cavaliers for Channing Frye, Isaiah Thomas and a first-round pick (Wagner) in 2018.\n\nJulius Randle, Knicks: Drafted No. 7 in 2014; Signed a free-agent deal with the Pelicans in 2018.\n\nD\u2019Angelo Russell, Timberwolves: Drafted No. 2 in 2015; Traded with Timofey Mozgov to the Nets for Brook Lopez and a first-round pick (Kyle Kuzma) in 2017.\n\nMoe Wagner, Magic: Drafted No. 25 in 2018; Traded to the Wizards in the three-way deal for Davis in 2019.\n\nIvica Zubac, Clippers: Drafted No. 32 in 2016; Traded with Michael Beasley to the Clippers for Mike Muscala in 2019.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://behindthebuckpass.com/2022/05/12/los-angeles-lakers-request-interview-milwaukee-bucks-charles-lee/", "page_content": "The NBA coaching carousel is in full rotation despite the limited number of openings at the moment and two Milwaukee Bucks assistants are in the thick of it.\n\nDarvin Ham has already interviewed or been requested to interview for all three vacancies (the Sacramento Kings job has already been filled) and now it appears as though Charles Lee will get interviewed by all three teams. According to Shams Charania of The Athletic, the Los Angeles Lakers have requested an interview with Lee.\n\nReactions to the Los Angeles Lakers requesting an interview with Milwaukee Bucks assistant Charles Lee\n\nLee had interviewed for the now-filled Kings job and is still in contention for the Charlotte Hornets position, along with Ham. The Lakers were the lone team that Lee had yet to meet with and it appears as though that is going to change.\n\nLee, 37, is one of the youngest candidates in this head coaching cycle and has gotten plenty of attention from teams before. He was reportedly a finalist for the Washington Wizards\u2019 head coaching vacancy (along with Ham, once again) before they went with Wes Unseld Jr.\n\nHe has been with Bucks head coach Mike Budenholzer since 2014 with the Atlanta Hawks after playing overseas for four years. He started his coaching career in college at his alma mater of Bucknell before joining Budenholzer.\n\nAlthough Ham gets most of the attention as a coaching candidate, Lee has been interviewed for almost all the same jobs. Teams see Lee\u2019s potential and it\u2019s only a matter of time before he gets his chance.\n\nI don\u2019t like just tossing the \u201cplayer\u2019s coach\u201d label on a Black candidate, but from the things we\u2019ve seen from Lee, the players do all seem to love him and get along with him very well. He did get the chance to be the head coach of the Hawks\u2019 Summer League team in 2017 which featured DeAndre\u2019 Bembry, John Collins, and Taurean Prince that posted a modest 3-2 record.\n\nIn ranking the three positions, I had the Lakers second, slightly ahead of the Kings and behind the Hornets by a significant margin.\n\nIf I were a young, up-and-coming coaching candidate, this would not be the job I\u2019d want. Sure, it\u2019s the Lakers and there\u2019s name value there, but it also comes with a ton of dysfunction. The Buss family has some weird public rivalry with Klutch Sports and LeBron James over who really has control over personnel, you\u2019ll get undermined to the media by James, Anthony Davis, and Russell Westbrook (if he\u2019s still around), and if you don\u2019t win immediately, the fans will call for your head.\n\nThe only upside is that you have a chance to win right away because of James and Davis, but with how things are being handled, how the roster is constructed, and James\u2019 looming threat of leaving at a moment\u2019s notice, is it worth the risk?\n\nStill, the allure of having that head coaching job and being in Los Angeles is strong for any up-and-coming coach. I\u2019m a big believer in fit and opportunity, so I hope Lee (as well as Ham) factor that in when making the choice.\n\nThis is all assuming either get offered one of the two (or both) of the head coaching vacancies. We\u2019ve seen both assistants get close in the hiring process before and come up short.\n\nGood luck to both Charles Lee and Darvin Ham in their interview process. As much as we love them as assistants with the Milwaukee Bucks, it would be nice to see them succeed as head coaches too!"}, {"url": "https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/7/29/22601417/lakers-free-agency-joel-ayayi-austin-reeves-chaundee-brown-mac-mcclung", "page_content": "The Los Angeles Lakers may have not had a single pick in the 2021 NBA Draft, but that didn\u2019t stop the team from being busy on Thursday night.
