The following thoughts on adaptation come from my personal experience of adapting the novel The Metal Girl into the film project \u201cMetal Girl\u201d.\n\nFrom Novel to Screenplay\n\nNovels and films are such different species that it can feel unnatural to marry them. After the adaptation, the only thing they will share will be a story, the setting, and the characters. A novel is a completed art form. One author writes the book, and one reader reads the book one at a time. If it\u2019s a successful book, many people, even millions of people will read that same book. While each reader will see the story through their own imagination and personal interpretation, the printed words will never change.\n\nVery few people will ever read the original screenplay. The screenplay will evolve with input from collaborations between the director and the creative team, from pre- to post-production. The screenplay is a fluid and ever evolving document.\n\nAdapting a novel to a film is rather like renovating a house: you will have to destroy it from the inside before you re-build it into something beautiful again. Trust me\u2014I\u2019ve done both.\n\nThe challenge in adapting the novel for a film is how to stay true to the source as you proceed to bend it into the medium of film. The first thing to consider is adapting prose to dramatic writing and the limitations of the screenplay format\n\nFrom Prose to Screenplay Format\n\nTo adapt the prose into a screenplay, you have to think about the story differently, as a series of scenes in three dimensions. Also, to accommodate the average length of a film\u2013one hour and forty-five minutes\u2013most working screenplays are between approximately 90 and 105 pages. The narrative of an average 300-500 page novel simply won\u2019t fit. Something\u2014a lot\u2014has to go. How does one tell a novel length story in a 100 page script?\n\nEfficiently, Using the Language of Film\n\nWhen I adapted The Metal Girl, early on it became quite clear to me that I needed to step away from the novel as written and think about re-telling the same story, this time using pictures, music, sound, and color. How would I tell that story, what would it look like, and how would those characters come to life on the screen?\n\n\n\nPlanning the Adaptation: Structure\n\nWhat elements of the story would stay and which could I cut out? Which characters, events, locations? What parts could I eliminate and what parts did I have to keep to portray the theme of the story and the main character\u2019s story arc?\n\nWhat would change, and what would stay the same? This is not always evident at first. Through all the versions of the script, some events, situations, characters in the novel will be lost, but at the same time, other elements that were not in the original story might be added for dramatic effect. Further changes will occur over the course production and editing of the film.\n\nBeginning, Middle, End\n\nThe first consideration is the structure of the film story, which may have to differ from the structure of the novel. Deciding on the best timeline for the events of the story in the film is the first thing to adapt. Surprise is an important element of screenwriting, the twists and turns of the plot, which is one of the devices that holds the attention of the film viewer but one that isn\u2019t always present in a book.\n\nA novel also has to move forward, but doesn\u2019t have to build on emotion in the same way as a film. A film takes the audience on an emotional ride. The film must hold you in your seat in rapt attention for one sitting of 90 to 105 minutes. So the screenplay must be structured in such a way as to build towards a dramatic, emotional climax that is resolved by the end. The words on the page don\u2019t need to do that. The book can be of interest and engaging but we can put it down and come back to it later.\n\nFor example, in the novel The Metal Girl, one very important event in the development of the female protagonist\u2019s character happened in the early part of the novel. But in the screenplay \u201cMetal Girl\u201d, for dramatic purposes, I put off that moment, building up to that point later in the story. When the moment occurs in the film, the audience is ready for her emotional response, and it becomes a turning point for the development of her character and the arc of the story.\n\nCharacters\u2014Subtracting and Adding\n\n\n\nIn the same way that the narrative structure may have to change, in the screenplay you may have to make changes with characters in the novel, especially if there are a lot or there are many incidental characters. For the reasons of character development, the story arc, and the time constraints of a film, incidental characters need to be kept to a minimum. Some characters in the novel fell away because I didn\u2019t need them as they weren\u2019t a crucial part of the story. In the novel they may have added another color in the development of the main character or texture to the story, but in the film they were unnecessary extra and distracting details.\n\nThe lead character in the novel The Metal Girl has no name because she is the anonymous first person narrator who tells the story as a more mature woman looking back on her 25-year-old self. I wanted her to be a more universally relatable character and not live in a box of race or ethnicity. Also, the novel\u2019s structure is in the vein of a mock-memoir. But obviously a nameless character was not going to work for a film, so she became Charlotte.\n\n\n\nAnother situation is that some new characters may appear in the script to move the narrative forward, as the film will have a different story arc than the novel. Another reason that one might add characters and scenes that don\u2019t appear in the novel is to translate internal thoughts into dialogue. For example, The Metal Girl is written in the first person. Because the entire story is coming from the narrator\u2019s mind, including her commentary on various situations, I sometimes chose to create characters that didn\u2019t exist in the book for Charlotte to interact with in order to turn her thoughts into dialogue and her internal emotional state into her responses to other people.\n\n\n\nKeeping what works\n\n\n\nIn spite of what I said above, sometimes what is written in the novel works perfectly well in the screenplay and on screen. After all the film is based on the novel, and you want to keep as much of the flavor of the original story as possible. In \u201cMetal Girl\u201d some of the dialogue in the screenplay comes directly from the novel. Parts of the books\u2019 first person narrative were used as bits of voiceover, and some scenes and dialogue were lifted directly as they were written in the novel. If it works, use it.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nJudy Sandra is a director, writer, producer, and author. The screenplay \u201cMetal Girl\u201d is an adaptation of her coming-of-age novel The Metal Girl.

The first thing to consider is adapting prose to dramatic writing and the limitations of the screenplay format\n\nFrom Prose to Screenplay Format\n\nTo adapt the prose into a screenplay, you have to think about the story differently, as a series of scenes in three dimensions. Also, to accommodate the average length of a film\u2013one hour and forty-five minutes\u2013most working screenplays are between approximately 90 and 105 pages. The narrative of an average 300-500 page novel simply won\u2019t fit. Something\u2014a lot\u2014has to go. How does one tell a novel length story in a 100 page script?\n\nEfficiently, Using the Language of Film\n\nWhen I adapted The Metal Girl, early on it became quite clear to me that I needed to step away from the novel as written and think about re-telling the same story, this time using pictures, music, sound, and color. How would I tell that story, what would it look like, and how would those characters come to life on the screen?\n\nPlanning the Adaptation: Structure\n\nWhat elements of the story would stay and which could I cut out? Which characters, events, locations? What parts could I eliminate and what parts did I have to keep to portray the theme of the story and the main character\u2019s story arc?\n\nWhat would change, and what would stay the same? This is not always evident at first. Through all the versions of the script, some events, situations, characters in the novel will be lost, but at the same time, other elements that were not in the original story might be added for dramatic effect. Further changes will occur over the course production and editing of the film.\n\nBeginning, Middle, End\n\nThe first consideration is the structure of the film story, which may have to differ from the structure of the novel. Deciding on the best timeline for the events of the story in the film is the first thing to adapt. Surprise is an important element of screenwriting, the twists and turns of the plot, which is one of the devices that holds the attention of the film viewer but one that isn\u2019t always present in a book.\n\nA novel also has to move forward, but doesn\u2019t have to build on emotion in the same way as a film. A film takes the audience on an emotional ride. The film must hold you in your seat in rapt attention for one sitting of 90 to 105 minutes. So the screenplay must be structured in such a way as to build towards a dramatic, emotional climax that is resolved by the end. The words on the page don\u2019t need to do that. The book can be of interest and engaging but we can put it down and come back to it later.\n\nFor example, in the novel The Metal Girl, one very important event in the development of the female protagonist\u2019s character happened in the early part of the novel. But in the screenplay \u201cMetal Girl\u201d, for dramatic purposes, I put off that moment, building up to that point later in the story. When the moment occurs in the film, the audience is ready for her emotional response, and it becomes a turning point for the development of her character and the arc of the story.\n\nCharacters: Subtracting and Adding\n\nIn the same way that the narrative structure may have to change, in the screenplay you may have to make changes with characters in the novel, especially if there are a lot or there are many incidental characters. For the reasons of character development, the story arc, and the time constraints of a film, incidental characters need to be kept to a minimum. Some characters in the novel fell away because I didn\u2019t need them as they weren\u2019t a crucial part of the story. In the novel they may have added another color in the development of the main character or texture to the story, but in the film they were unnecessary extra and distracting details.\n\nThe lead character in the novel The Metal Girl has no name because she is the anonymous first person narrator who tells the story as a more mature woman looking back on her 25-year-old self. I wanted her to be a more universally relatable character and not live in a box of race or ethnicity. Also, the novel\u2019s structure is in the vein of a mock-memoir. But obviously a nameless character was not going to work for a film, so she became Charlotte.\n\nAnother situation is that some new characters may appear in the script to move the narrative forward, as the film will have a different story arc than the novel. Another reason that one might add characters and scenes that don\u2019t appear in the novel is to translate internal thoughts into dialogue. For example, The Metal Girl is written in the first person. Because the entire story is coming from the narrator\u2019s mind, including her commentary on various situations, I sometimes chose to create characters that didn\u2019t exist in the book for Charlotte to interact with in order to turn her thoughts into dialogue and her internal emotional state into her responses to other people.\n\nKeeping what works\n\nIn spite of what I said above, sometimes what is written in the novel works perfectly well in the screenplay and on screen. After all the film is based on the novel, and you want to keep as much of the flavor of the original story as possible. In \u201cMetal Girl\u201d some of the dialogue in the screenplay comes directly from the novel. Parts of the books\u2019 first person narrative were used as bits of voiceover, and some scenes and dialogue were lifted directly as they were written in the novel. If it works, use it.\n\nAbout Judy Sandra Judy Sandra is a director, writer, producer, and author. The screenplay \u201cMetal Girl\u201d is an adaptation of her coming-of-age novel The Metal Girl.

But crossing that bridge is no easy venture.\n\nScreenwriting is a visual medium, so those writing screenplays do not have the benefit of being able to write detailed back stories and inner thoughts of characters. Every single line of scene description and dialogue translates to the screen, which is why screenwriters can\u2019t go into such detail. They have 90-120 pages \u2014 give or take \u2014 to convey a visual story. One page equals one minute of screen time.\n\nWith short stories and novels, authors don\u2019t have those restraints. You can go into detail describing a character\u2019s wardrobe, mannerisms, and background. You can write long prose detailing a particular location. You can spend pages and pages on those elements without worrying about pacing and lack of engagement. With short stories and novels, most readers revel in those details.\n\nWith screenplays, those reading them don\u2019t have the time. They are blueprints utilized within a collaborative medium where literally hundreds of people will work to make those visuals come to life. Authors of short stories and novels rely only on the reader\u2019s imagination and the help the author can give to feed that imagination with details.\n\nSo making the jump from short stories and novels to screenplays is a huge undertaking, even for the most skilled authors.\n\nHere are some of the greatest examples of famous authors that became screenwriters \u2014 and how they fared.\n\nAgatha Christie\n\nAgatha Christie is the best-selling novelist of all time \u2014 known for her 66 detective novels and 14 short story collections.\n\nShe was born on 15 September 1890 in Torquay, Devon, South West England. She taught herself to read by the age of five. In 1902, Christie was sent to Miss Guyer\u2019s Girls School in Torquay, but didn\u2019t like the discipline. In 1905, she was sent to Paris and educated at Mademoiselle Cabernet\u2019s, Les Marroniers, and then Miss Dryden\u2019s \u2014 the last of which was a finishing school.\n\nChristie published her first book \u2014 The Mysterious Affair at Styles \u2014 in 1920. Her first successful novel was The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, written in 1926. It was always remembered by Christie as one of her favorites. That same year, her mother died and she discovered that her husband had been having an affair with another woman. She disappeared \u2014 clearly traumatized \u2014 and was missing for ten days until she was found in a hotel registered under the name of her husband\u2019s mistress. She divorced in 1928 and remarried in 1930. That year, she released Murder at the Vicarage and it became another instant classic. The book introduced Miss Jane Marple, one of Christie\u2019s most utilized and celebrated characters that appeared in dozens of her novels and short stories.\n\nChristie would go on to become known as the \u201cQueen of Crime\u201d with her writings selling more than 2 billion copies worldwide. She was also a renowned playwright as well. Her play The Mousetrap opened in 1952 at the Ambassador Theatre and holds the record for the longest unbroken run in a London theater, with more than 8,800 showings over the course of 21 years.\n\nShe never liked the many adaptations of her work to the big and small screen. But, unbeknownst to most, she did dabble in screenwriting. Christie adapted her story The Wasp\u2019s Nest for a television play, which was broadcast live in 1937. Through the 1940s, she was reportedly penning many addition TV scripts, but rarely showed them to anyone in the industry. It was almost like a hobby for her. In the early 1960s, Christie partnered with MGM to adapt the Charles Dickens novel Bleak House for the big screen. Dickens was one of her favorite authors. She wrote what recollections stated was an overly long screenplay and sent it to MGM with a note stating that she knew it needed to be shortened. The script was never produced.\n\nHer work continues to be adapted to film. Murder on the Orient Express was remade in 2017 (it had been adapted before in 1974), directed by Kenneth Branagh. Branagh is also directing an adaptation of her novel Death on the Nile. It has also been announced that Ben Affleck is attached to direct and star in the adaptation of her novel Witness for the Prosecution.\n\nGeorge R.R. Martin\n\nMartin is most known as the creator of Game of Thrones \u2014 specifically through his successful series of A Song of Ice and Fire novels.\n\nHe graduated from Northwestern University in journalism. He then dabbled in teaching while making an effort to be a fiction writer, writing short stories primarily in the science fiction genre. His first story to be nominated for the Hugo Award and Nebula Awards was With Morning Comes Mistfall, published in 1973 in Analog magazine. His first novel, Dying of the Light, was published in 1977.\n\nHis genre novels led him to Hollywood as he was staffed as a writer and executive story consultant for the revival of The Twilight Zone in the 1980s. When CBS cancelled that show, he wrote for the science fiction show Max Headroom. Sadly, the show was cancelled before his scripts went into production. He then was hired as a writer and producer on the dramatic fantasy series Beauty and the Beast. In 1989, he became the show\u2019s co-supervising producer and wrote 14 of its episodes.\n\nHe would return to the literary storytelling landscape with some horror short stories and working as a book series editor. In 1996, showcasing a love of the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, Martin wrote A Game of Thrones, the first book in the A Song of Ice and Fire novels.\n\nThe series would later be picked up by HBO and the rest is Golden Globe and Emmy Award-winning history.\n\nWhile Martin made a grand effort as a screenwriter within the television industry, we\u2019re still waiting to see if he can truly deliver on a big cinematic project.\n\nJoan Didion\n\nDuring the turbulent times of the 1960s and 1970s, Didion became a cultural icon with her work as a columnist, editor, essay writer, novelist \u2014 and later a screenwriter. She graduated from UC-Berkeley in 1956 and later worked at Vogue magazine shortly after graduation. She started as a copywriter and then moved her way up the ladder to become an editor until 1963. Her first novel was Run River (1963), a portrait of a marriage with wrong turns and betrayals \u2014 all of which played as a commentary on the history of California. In 1968, she wrote a collection of magazine columns that were published under the title Slouching Towards Bethlehem \u2014 the columns established Didion as an essayist that was reflective of her era. Her second collection \u2014 The White Album (1979) \u2014 continued to showcase her perspective of the turbulent 1960s.\n\nShe wrote short novels like Play It as It Lays (1970), A Book of Common Prayer (1977), Democracy (1984), and The Last Thing He Wanted (1996) \u2014 as well as the essays Salvador (1983), Miami (1987), and Where I Was From (2003). She would later write essays centered on U.S. politics, all of which were collected in Political Fictions (2001). One of the standout pieces of that political collection covered the 2000 U.S. presidential election.\n\nShe was a true voice of her generation and her gender throughout an impressive career. But she didn\u2019t stop there. Didion also wrote screenplays with her husband. The Year of Magical Thinking (2005) was a memoir she wrote, recounting her marriage and the mourning of losing her husband. It won a National Book Award and she later adapted it for the stage in 2007.\n\nMovies like Panic in Needle Park (1971), Play It as It Lays (1972 adaptation of her own novel), A Star Is Born (1976), True Confessions (1981), and Up Close and Personal (1996) were a collection of noteworthy and heralded cinema, cementing her status as a talented writer on multiple platforms. She was honored with the National Humanities Medal in 2013.\n\nMario Puzo\n\nLong before Francis Ford Coppola brought the life of Mafia gangsters to the big screen, Puzo wrote the original novel, The Godfather.\n\nPuzo drew heavily from his upbringing in the Hell\u2019s Kitchen neighborhood of New York City. He graduated from the City College of New York and later joined the United States Army Air Forces in World War II, only to never see combat due to his poor eyesight.\n\nHis first short story, The Last Christmas, was published in American Vanguard in 1951. His first book, The Dark Arena, was later published in 1955.\n\nHe later worked in publishing as a writer and editor \u2014 and also wrote World War II adventure pulp serials under the pseudonym Mario Cleri for True Action.\n\nIn 1969, The Godfather was published and stayed on the New York Times best-seller list for months. Puzo was hired by Paramount Studios to write the script for the big screen adaptation, for which he won an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. Puzo and Coppola would go on to work on the film\u2019s two successful sequels as well.\n\nBut his screenwriting didn\u2019t stop there. He wrote the original draft of the film Earthquake and then went on to write the script for Richard Donner\u2019s Superman. He also collaborated on the stories for the 1982 film A Time to Die and the 1984 Francis Ford Coppola film The Cotton Club.\n\nPuzo\u2019s screenwriting skills are clearly evident, having adapted his own novels to the big screen and also writing one of the greatest superhero movies of all time. However, if you read his drafts you\u2019ll quickly see that within the realm of screenwriting, he did tend to take his literary writing and apply it to sometimes overwritten screenplay drafts.\n\nMichael Crichton\n\nCrichton is perhaps best known for his blockbuster best-sellers like Jurassic Park, Sphere, and Disclosure, all of which (and many more) would go on to be adapted into major feature films.\n\nHe attended Harvard, at first pursuing an understudy degree in literature until he decided to switch tracks towards a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in biological anthropology. He later attended Harvard Medical School, all while beginning to publish novels under various pseudonyms like John Lange and Jeffrey Hudson.\n\n\u201cMy feeling about the Lange books is that my competition is in-flight movies. One can read the books in an hour and a half, and be more satisfactorily amused than watching Doris Day. I write them fast and the reader reads them fast and I get things off my back,\u201d Crighton once told The New York Times.\n\nIn 1968, he published the novels Easy Go and A Case of Need using his real name.\n\nIn 1969, The Andromeda Strain was published and launched his career as he became a best-selling author. Other successful novels would follow, including the aforementioned Sphere, Jurassic Park, and Disclosure.\n\nHis turn at screenwriting started in the 1970s after he became a best-selling novelist. He wrote three episodes of the series Insight, and also made his directing debut with the TV movie Pursuit, which was based on his novel Binary.\n\nHe then made the jump to the big screen, writing and directing the 1973 science fiction western-thriller film Westworld. Other films that he both wrote and directed were The Great Train Robbery (1979), Looker (1981), Runaway (1984) and Physical Evidence (1989). He also wrote the screenplays for Extreme Close-Up (1973) and Twister (1996). He then went back to television as the creator and executive producer of the celebrated television drama ER, based on a pilot script he wrote in 1974.\n\nNeedless to say, he was a blockbuster writer for novels, film, and television. Crichton not only wrote some quality screenplays \u2014 he also managed to take on the reins of director and executive producer. Impressive, to say the least.\n\nGillian Flynn\n\nFlynn shot to fame when her third novel, Gone Girl, became an international sensation. But before that novel took off, she worked in journalism.\n\nShe first received her undergraduate degrees in English and journalism at the University of Kansas. She then lived in California for two years writing for a human resources trade magazine until she moved to Chicago and attended and earned a master\u2019s degree from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University. In 1998 she was hired by Entertainment Weekly as a featured writer \u2014 later becoming a lead television critic and writer for feature films. She was laid off by the company in 2008.\n\nDuring Flynn\u2019s Entertainment Weekly days, she was working on her own writing in the form of novels. She wrote Sharp Objects, which was published in 2006, and then went on to write Dark Places (2009) and Gone Girl (2012). The latter would earn her the number one spot on the New York Times Hardcover Fiction Bestseller list for eight weeks. Gone Girl would go on to sell two million copies in print and digital editions in 2012 alone, according to the book\u2019s publisher.\n\nFox paid $1.5 million for the screen rights to Gone Girl and later hired Flynn to write the screenplay for the cinematic adaptation. The film was directed by David Fincher, becoming a box office hit with critical acclaim. Flynn\u2019s screenwriting work for the film adaptation was nominated for a Golden Globe, Writers Guild of America Award and BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. She also co-wrote a film adaption of the ITV series Widows with Viola Davis set to star.\n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald\n\nFitzgerald is now widely known as having written one of the greatest American novels \u2014 The Great Gatsby.\n\nBefore that, he was a Princeton student that later dropped out after being put on academic probation when his studies became less of a priority as he pursued his passion for writing. He then joined the Army and floundered after his service, working in an advertising agency while continuing to write short stories.\n\nHe moved back in with his parents as he revised a novel that would become This Side of Paradise. The novel was picked up by Scribner\u2019s and then published in 1920. It was an instant success, selling 41,075 copies in the first year alone. He was finally a successful writer with a steady income. He would later befriend celebrated author Ernest Hemingway while living in Paris.\n\nLike many writers during the 1920s and 1930s, Fitzgerald made a living writing short stories for such magazines and would also sell his stories and novels to Hollywood studios. He struggled through alcoholism and his wife\u2019s mental illness, all of which sadly lead to further financial struggles.\n\nWhile his passion was with his novels, he was forced to continue to work in Hollywood. In 1937 he signed an exclusive writing contract with MGM. It was there that he earned his highest annual income up to that point \u2014 $29,757. As a screenwriter, he wrote a draft of Gone with the Wind (which was never filmed), rewrites on Madam Curie, and other uncredited work until his contract was terminated in 1939. He then went freelance and wrote Winter Carnival, but his screenwriting career would never go on to flourish as he went on an alcoholic binge which eventually led way to poor health and his eventual death in 1940.\n\nThe popularity of The Great Gatsby wouldn\u2019t occur until after Fitzgerald died. It is now one of the most celebrated novels in literature and a definitive literary piece of his era. While he surely did his time as a contracted studio screenwriter, his screenwriting never matched his literary relevance.\n\nMargaret Atwood\n\nAtwood is often referred to as Canada\u2019s most famous author. She has written award-winning poetry, short stories and novels, most notably The Circle Game (1966), The Handmaid\u2019s Tale (1985), The Blind Assassin (2000), Oryx and Crake (2003) and The Tent (2006). Her writing has been translated into many different languages.\n\nShe was born in Ottawa, Ontario Canada on November 18th, 1939 and began writing plays and poems at the age of six. She graduated with honors from Victor College in the University of Ontario in 1961 with a Bachelor of Arts in English and also minored in both philosophy and French. Later that year, after she won the E. J. Pratt Medal for her privately printed book of poems \u2014 Double Persephone \u2014 she studied at Harvard\u2019s Radcliffe College where she earned a master\u2019s degree in 1962 and began her doctoral studies at Harvard University for two years \u2014 but Atwood did not finish her dissertation.\n\nThroughout her literary career, she would also go on to teach at a number of colleges and universities in both Canada and the United States. If that wasn\u2019t enough, Atwood also invented and developed the LongPen and its associated technologies that facilitate the remote robotic writing of documents.\n\nAlthough she is known as a science fiction novelist and visionary, Atwood rejects this notion by calling her work speculative fiction, saying, \u201cScience fiction has monsters and spaceships; speculative fiction could really happen.\u201d\n\nHer most celebrated novel \u2014 The Handmaid\u2019s Tale \u2014 was adapted into the 1990 film of the same name starring Natasha Richardson, Faye Dunaway, Aidan Quinn, and Robert Duvall. The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and Alias Grace each became miniseries in 2017 as well. Atwood didn\u2019t write scripts for any of these adaptations. However, she did first try her hand at screenwriting by penning a television episode of the 1981 Canadian series For the Record, as well as an episode of the 1987 BBC series Screen Two. She recently optioned a TV movie she wrote called The Heart Goes Last to MGM Television, telling the story of a couple that takes part in a social experiment involving them living in prison.\n\nWilliam Faulkner\n\nFaulkner\u2019s work was first published during the decades of the 1920s and 1930s, but his popularity wouldn\u2019t truly soar until he won the 1949 Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nA Fable (1954) and his last novel The Reivers (1962) both won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, but his most popular novels were The Sound and the Fury (1929), As I Lay Dying (1930), and Light in August (1932). His first published short story, A Rose for Emily, remains to be one of the most famous short stories written by any American.\n\nHe was educated at the University of Mississippi, but didn\u2019t even last a year when, like Fitzgerald, he dropped out with dreams of making a living as a writer. And much like Fitzgerald, Faulkner would struggle to make ends meet until he was offered a contract with MGM to write screenplays. He worked with legendary director Howard Hawks and they quickly became friends. Hawks\u2019s brother even became Faulkner\u2019s Hollywood agent, leading Faulkner to a successful screenwriting career from the 1930s through the 1950s.\n\nHis screenwriting credits include Today We Live, The Road to Glory, Submarine Patrol, Drums Along the Mohawk, Air Force, To Have and Have Not, and The Big Sleep.\n\nJohn Steinbeck\n\nIn his writing career, Steinbeck wrote 27 books, including 16 novels, six non-fiction books, and two collections of short stories \u2014 and in 1962 he would win the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nHe studied English Literature at Stanford University, but after a few years he left the school with no degree, instead choosing to move to New York in hopes of a writing career. He worked odd jobs while struggling to get his writing published, but later moved to Southern California, taking on a tour guide and caretaker job at Lake Tahoe.\n\nHis first novel, Cup of Gold, was published in 1929, but it wasn\u2019t until 1935 when he finally found success after years of struggling through The Great Depression. His Tortilla Flat became a successful novel, winning the California Commonwealth Club\u2019s Gold Medal and later going on to be adapted into a film of the same name starring Spencer Tracy, Hedy Lamarr, and John Garfield in 1942.\n\nBut it was his later work \u2014 known as the \u201cCalifornia novels\u201d \u2014 where Steinbeck truly made a name for himself. Of Mice and Men and The Grapes of Wrath were the standouts, and emulated Steinbeck\u2019s own observations of The Great Depression.\n\nWhile he didn\u2019t write the screenplays for the film adaptations of those books, he was always on set as they were both in production at the same time. He would alternate days between the two sets.\n\nHe did dabble in screenwriting with movies like The Forgotten Village and Viva Zapata!, but his Hollywood days were rightfully overshadowed by his literary work.\n\nCormac McCarthy\n\nMcCarthy is one of this generation\u2019s greatest literary voices and his novels have been adapted into some of the best films in the last decade. His fifth novel, Blood Meridian, was featured within the 2005 Time Magazine\u2019s list of the 100 Best English-language Books Since 1923. His novel All the Pretty Horses won both the U.S. National Book Award and National Book Critics Circle Award. Unlike his previous novels at the time, All the Pretty Horses was a publishing sensation. It became a New York Times bestseller and sold 190,000 copies in hardcover within the first six months of publication, finally giving McCarthy the wide readership that had eluded him for so many years.\n\nThe breakthrough novel was later adapted into a feature film directed by Billy Bob Thornton, starring Matt Damon. His No Country for Old Men \u2014 originally written as a screenplay \u2014 was adapted into the 2007 feature film of the same name, adapted by Joel and Ethan Coen, and went on to win four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nRead The Script Lab\u2019s From Script to Screen: No Country for Old Men\n\nHis novel The Road was celebrated with international acclaim, winning a Pulitzer Prize and then later adapted into a feature film starring Viggo Mortensen.\n\nEarly on in his adult life, he attended the University of Tennessee from 1951\u20131952 and then 1957\u20131959 but like Fitzgerald and Faulkner before him, he never graduated.\n\nDespite the cinematic success of the movie adaptations of his novels, McCarthy had never been paid for writing a screenplay \u2014 until 2012 when McCarthy sold his original screenplay, The Counselor, to producers that later attached director Ridley Scott to direct. With a star-studded cast, the film went into production quickly. When it was released in 2013, it was critically panned. Most would love to see him try his hand at screenwriting again, but hopefully in better fashion next time around.\n\nTruman Capote\n\nCapote first flourished as a short story writer, published in magazines like The Atlantic Monthly, Harper\u2019s Bazaar, Harper\u2019s Magazine, Mademoiselle, The New Yorker, Prairie Schooner, and Story.\n\nHis novella Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s and novel In Cold Blood stand out as his most signature work, but it was his fame as a celebrity that drove most headlines during his time. His social circles included those from Hollywood, royalty, and members of high society.\n\nHe was never formerly educated after high school. He worked as a copyboy for The New Yorker for two years until he left for Alabama to live with relatives while writing his first novel, Summer Crossing. That novel was never published during his lifetime and was later discovered and published posthumously in 2005.\n\nOne of his most famous short stories, Miriam (published in 1945) earned him a contract with Random House to write a novel with an advance of $1,500. Other Voices, Other Rooms was published in 1948, made The New York Times bestseller list, and stayed on that list for nine weeks, selling more than 26,000 copies.\n\nCapote\u2019s sole screenplay was a co-writing venture for John Huston\u2019s Beat the Devil (1953). He did attempt to write a screenplay adaptation of The Great Gatsby, which Paramount was looking to produce, but his draft was rejected. So while he mingled with the Hollywood elite, it was clear that his place was behind the typewriter writing short stories and novels, as opposed to movies.\n\nRay Bradbury\n\nBradbury\u2019s name is synonymous with science fiction. He is perhaps the most celebrated name of the genre. He is most known for his novel Fahrenheit 451 (1953), as well as his science-fiction and horror-story collections, The Martian Chronicles (1950), The Illustrated Man (1951), and I Sing the Body Electric (1969).\n\nAfter high school, he had no formal education. From 1938 to 1942 he sold newspapers around Los Angeles to support himself while writing. In 1941 he celebrated his first paid gig when the pulp magazine Science Stories published his short story Pendulum. By the end of 1942, he was a working writer, publishing short stories of horror and science fiction to various pulp magazines. It was The Martian Chronicles that shot him to fame, followed by Fahrenheit 451 three years later.\n\nIn the 1950s, Bradbury\u2019s work was adapted into pulp comic books and televised science fiction and horror anthologies. In the 1960s, the trend continued with his work adapted into Rod Serling\u2019s The Twilight Zone series. As the decades went on, his work was adapted for the big screen as well.\n\nBradbury rode his genre fame to a successful career as a screenwriter. From 1985 to 1992, Bradbury hosted a syndicated anthology television series of his own \u2014 The Ray Bradbury Theater \u2014 where he adapted 65 of his stories.\n\nHis additional screenwriting work included further adaptations of his own work with the 1993 animated television version of The Halloween Tree, The 1998 film The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit, among others.\n\nHis most infamous screenwriting job came in 1953 when he teamed with director John Huston to adapt Moby Dick for the big screen. The two had a horrible working relationship and the film would go on to fail at the box office.\n\nBradbury excelled in adapting his work to television, but we never had the pleasure of seeing a hit Hollywood movie written by the science fiction legend.\n\nJ.K. Rowling\n\nRowling has sold an astronomical 400 million plus copies of her novels. Her Harry Potter franchise is the best-selling series of books in history and the film adaptations comprise one of the most successful cinematic franchises the big screen has ever seen.\n\nYears before Harry Potter, she took the entrance exams for Oxford but was not accepted, instead enrolling in the University of Exeter for a B.A. in French and Classics. She worked at Amnesty International in London and then at the Chamber of Commerce in Manchester.\n\nHowever, seven years after graduating high school, Rowling had hit on hard times. Her marriage had failed and she was a jobless single parent diagnosed with clinical depression and \u2014 in her words \u2014 on the verge of suicide. During this time, she wrote Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone on an old typewriter. Twelve publishing houses rejected her submissions until Bloomsbury decided to publish the magical novel. The rest is literary and cinematic history.\n\nDespite having overall script approval for each of the uber-successful film adaptations, Rowling never wrote a script for any of them. Her sole screenwriting credit came in 2016 when she wrote a script based off of her Harry Potter supplementary book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. The film adaptation of the same name went on to become a box office success, launching a new Harry Potter universe franchise with four additional films in development, all of which she is currently attached to write.\n\nWilliam Goldman\n\nGoldman is famous for both his literary accomplishments, as well as his cinematic screenwriting. He has won two Oscars as a screenwriter. One for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and another for All the President\u2019s Men. His novels include Marathon Man and The Princess Bride, both of which he adapted to film.\n\nEarlier in life, Goldman received a B.A. from Oberlin College in 1952 and then enrolled in the Army. He was sent to work at the Pentagon until his discharge as a Corporal in 1954. From there he went to Columbia University, earning an M.A.\n\nHe wrote short stories throughout his time in school, but never was able to get them published anywhere. He initially had little to no interest in screenwriting. He wanted to focus on poetry, short stories, and novels.\n\nGoldman wrote his first novel, The Temple of God, in three weeks. A publisher agreed to pick it up for publishing if Goldman could double the length. He did and the novel went on to become a moderate success in paperback. He followed that book up fifty weeks later with Your Turn to Curtsy, My Turn to Bow \u2014 which he apparently wrote in just a week. His third book, Soldier in the Rain, was a success in paperback as well and led to a film adaptation. Goldman didn\u2019t write the script for that film.\n\nHe was enlisted by actor Cliff Robertson to adapt a short story in a film and also did some rewrites on one of the actor\u2019s other films in development. The short story adaptation was shelved in favor of another writer after Robertson disliked Goldman\u2019s draft.\n\nGoldman later made a pitch to producer Elliott Kastner to make a film of the Lew Archer novels of Ross Macdonald. Kastner chose the novel The Moving Target and hired Goldman to adapt it. The retitled film, Harper (1966), was a success at the box office and established Goldman as a screenwriter.\n\nHe wrote one novel after that film and then couldn\u2019t decide on what to write next, so he turned back to screenwriting and wrote his first original screenplay, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. It sold for $400,000 \u2014 the highest payment for a script at that time.\n\nAfter this, Goldman would bounce back and forth from screenplays to novels \u2014 even adapting his own work successfully with the likes of Marathon Man and The Princess Bride. With many other hits, in both the literary and cinematic platforms, Goldman would go on to be known as one of the greatest screenwriters in the history of cinema, as well as one of the American greats in literature as well.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n\nAs you can see, some authors made a successful transition to and from screenwriting, while others sadly failed. Hollywood and the literary industry can be two very different beasts. But they also have their similarities.\n\nShort stories are often more cinematic than most novels, thus they afford the screenwriter certain freedoms while adapting. So, for screenwriters and producers especially, instead of looking for highly unattainable \u2014 and sometimes unadaptable \u2014 novels on bestseller lists, they seek out those amazing and more accessible short stories, novellas, and even flash fiction.\n\nIf you have short stories with cinematic potential, consider ScreenCraft\u2019s Cinematic Short Story Competition.\n\nWith a judging panel that includes editors from Random House Studios, Tin House Magazine, and Harper\u2019s Magazine, the competition is looking for short stories (not screenplays) with special cinematic potential. Whether you\u2019re writing flash fiction or a novella, they want to read your story. The grand prize winner will receive $1,000 and personal introductions to literary agents, managers, producers and publishers. The top five finalists will be read by our network of over 40 literary and entertainment industry professionals.

But sweating, stammering Charlie feels this assessment is too mild: \"It's self-indulgent! It's narcissistic! It's solipsistic! It's pathetic! I'm pathetic and I'm fat and pathetic!\"\n\nNot to mention bald and unable to relate to women. This is a bold and dynamic role Kaufman has written for himself: the hero as chump, and chump as hero, hunched miserably over his typewriter. No glitzy AppleMac G4 for this wordsmith. It's an entertaining tale of Hollywood paranoia and the career neurosis of a screenwriter, with Kaufman not floating face down in the pool, but raging and staggering round, whingeing and whimpering, avoiding his agent's calls, beating his head against the wall, obsessed with the challenge of writing a film about flowers and conveying their vast evolutionary narrative.\n\nHe has accepted a lucrative commission to adapt Susan Orlean's book The Orchid Thief, and after struggling for months discovers that the screenplay he actually wants to write is the story of his failure to adapt it. What chutzpah it must have taken for the real Kaufman actually to submit this screenplay to his employers, and what an incredible testament to the clout wielded by Kaufman and director Spike Jonze that this is the movie that got made.\n\nSo Kaufman cheekily writes himself into his script, or rather writes himself writing himself into his script - a paunchy loser who can't get a girlfriend. But he also creates a doppelganger, an alternative self whom he both despises and wants to be. Donald is an easygoing, sexually successful idiot who is also writing a boneheaded by-the-numbers screenplay with the aid of a raft of self-help manuals and Robert McKee's screenwriting course. It turns out to be an appalling serial-killer flick called The 3, in which the psycho is a literary critic called the Deconstructionist who cuts little pieces off his victims.\n\nSo much for the metatext. The central story, which is thoroughly upstaged and made to look very boring by the hilarious Kaufman brothers, is about Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep). She is a New Yorker staffer who writes a classy, well-turned article, and then a classy, well-turned book, about charismatic, gap-toothed orchid-poacher John Laroche, played by the perennially excellent Chris Cooper. Laroche's attractive, passionate approach to life makes Susan ask herself hard questions about her own sterile existence. And the \"adaptation\" of the title is made to earn its keep as a Darwinian metaphor for how flowers adapt - and also how the heart itself adapts.\n\nIt's all beautifully acted, but I didn't care about Susan and John and their tremulous relationship, laden with supercilious, middlebrow significance. They weren't on screen for a single minute without me wondering: \"Yes, yes, but what's happening with Charlie and Donald? Is Charlie going to get back together with Amelia? How about that cute waitress?\" This is the problem with \"levels of reality\". As Clive James wrote, there's always one which is really real, and the story of the two writers is so funny and seductive that Meryl Streep's plotline, like her 19th-century existence in Karel Reisz's The French Lieutenant's Woman, is bound to look distant and inert.\n\nCage gives one of the best performances of his recent career as the Kaufmans. He's a natural in this role, especially when that great horse face breaks into an ingratiating grin, but he's also very good at Charlie's fastidious horror at Donald attempting to use Hollywood insider jargon. He winces when his brother airily refers to \"the industry\" and when Donald blunders into his bedroom and asks if he wants to listen to his \"pitch\", Charlie all but screams: \"Don't say that!\"\n\nCharlie's current discontents get traced back to the genesis of his breakthrough work, Being John Malkovich, and there's a forbidden thrill in seeing fragments of this masterpiece crop up here - particularly Malkovich himself imperiously ordering people about during the restaurant scene - while the fictional Kaufman tries waving to the stars before being brusquely ordered off the set. It's a very tasty postmodern treat, and so is Charlie's final indignity: having to swallow his pride and attend the screenwriting seminar run by Robert McKee (Brian Cox). It is here that Charlie learns that he will have to insert the hackneyed elements that he has affected to despise: the big resolve, the overcoming of difficulties and the learning of life lessons, etc.\n\nWhen so many screenplays fall apart in the final act, there's something piquant in the fact that Adaptation does too. A very strange, frantically melodramatic ending brings Susan Orlean, John Laroche and the Kaufmans together in real time for a big showdown, for which this quirky, brainy comedy has certainly not prepared us adequately. But the ending isn't the problem - the problem is that 50% of the movie doesn't come to life. The whole story of John Laroche and Susan Orlean is placed a double-step away from us, and Orlean's own apparently effortless existence as a writer looks implausibly bland compared to Charlie's uproarious rage and impotence over the blank sheet of paper.\n\nPerhaps Adaptation wantonly mystifies the writer's work, making Charlie Kaufman's task look more wretchedly impossible than it actually is. He did, after all, do a straight job of adapting Chuck Barris's Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. But it's a funny, complex take on the idea of storytelling, the tyranny of three-act narrative and how the movies absorb literary properties. Adaptation is like a funky flip-side to The Hours. Probably more profound, too."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-lifestyle-california-richard-carpenter-karen-carpenter-c3d79d349ec958a2146804b95ee04f18", "page_content": "Richard Carpenter poses at his home in Thousand Oaks, Calif., on Friday, Sept. 10, 2021.

This was a chance to do something different.\n\n\u201cIt was the focus on the music itself, that\u2019s primarily it,\u201d Carpenter told the AP as he sat at his piano in his Southern California home. \u201cIt touches on things that we hadn\u2019t touched on before or that if we had, it had been ignored.\u201d\n\nIt has the heft and visual history of a coffee table book, but it\u2019s also a nearly note-for-note musical biography of the pair that goes back to their childhood lives in New Haven, Connecticut, where Richard Carpenter found the seeds of the group\u2019s sound in his father\u2019s records and a toy jukebox.\n\nHe cites some unexpected influences, including another man-and-woman duo, Les Paul and Mary Ford, whose early experimenting with vocal overdubs and layered harmonies electrified him.\n\n\u201cIt made a profound impression on me, that ooh-ah, ooh-ah. I was maybe 5 or 6,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cI had no idea how all this was done. I just knew it was different and that I really liked it. And many years later, of course, it came up in my mind while I was arranging a lot of things that I wrote the harmonies for.\u201d\n\nHe credits a less famous name with a well-known sound, choral arranger Judd Conlon, whose work appeared in Disney\u2019s \u201cPeter Pan\u201d and \u201cAlice in Wonderland.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis arranging style for multi-vocals was tight,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cThey were very close harmonies, which had a great big effect on me.\u201d\n\nThe book makes clear that their elaborate, multi-layered recordings were made while the young duo maintained a staggering schedule of touring and television appearances.\n\nIt gives an accounting of nearly every rainy day and Monday they spent in a hectic 1970, the year \u201c(They Long to Be) Close to You\u201d became their breakthrough hit. Somehow amid it all they recorded their third album, 1971\u2032s \u201cCarpenters,\u201d known to fans as the tan album and regarded by many as their best.\n\nThe Carpenters were often derided as makers of schmaltzy throwaway hits. But the book argues they were great creators of fully formed albums, with an incredible run of records between 1970\u2032s \u201cClose to You\u201d and 1973\u2032s \u201cNow & Then,\u201d the concept album that solidified their global stardom.\n\n\u201cWe had so many hit singles, and usually right in a row, that we tended to be dismissed again by our detractors as a singles band,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cWe sold millions of albums.\u201d\n\nCarpenter\u2019s ear for finding hits, often in unlikely places, was as essential as his ear for making them.\n\nHe found \u201cSuperstar,\u201d the Carpenters song probably most beloved of younger generations, when he heard Bette Midler sing it on \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201d He came across \u201cWe\u2019ve Only Just Begun\u201d in a bank commercial before they made it a hit.\n\nWhen he heard them, he knew just what to do with them.\n\n\u201cIf the song hit me, whether it was one of mine or say one that I\u2019d heard, like \u2018We\u2019ve Only Just Begun,\u2019 or \u2018Rainy Days and Mondays\u2019 or \u2018Superstar,\u2019 if the song had it, my arrangement just took place immediately,\u201d Carpenter said.\n\nAnd he knew a song was useless if it didn\u2019t match his sister\u2019s stunning alto voice.\n\n\u201cI could give you a list of songs that I heard on the radio that I went right out and bought and yet knew would not work for Karen and me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat we were brother and sister just had a whole lot to do with it.\u201d\n\nHe also reconsidered his musical catalog on the forthcoming \u201cRichard Carpenter\u2019s Piano Songbook.\u201d He reimagines several of the band\u2019s biggest hits for solo piano on the album slated for a January release.\n\nAmid all the looking back, Carpenter recently made his first visit in some 30 years back to what was once the studios of A&M Records in Hollywood. It now belongs to Jim Henson Company and the Muppets, who have changed it very little.\n\nIt was an emotional trip.\n\n\u201cWe spent so much of our lives there that it was just like returning home,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the book\u2019s publisher is Princeton Architectural Press, not Princeton University Press, and \u201cCarpenters\u201d was the duo\u2019s third album, not their second.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton on Twitter: https://twitter.com/andyjamesdalton"}, {"url": "https://www.npr.org/2022/03/27/1088946140/oscars-2022-jane-campion-best-director-power-of-the-dog", "page_content": "Jane Campion is now the third woman to win the best director Oscar\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Neilson Barnard/Getty Images Neilson Barnard/Getty Images\n\nJane Campion has won this year's best director Oscar for helming the Western drama The Power of the Dog. She is now the third director who is a woman to win an Oscar, following Kathryn Bigelow (in 2010 for The Hurt Locker) and Chlo\u00e9 Zhao (in 2021 for Nomadland).\n\nCampion also wrote the screenplay based on Thomas Savage's 1967 novel of the same title. The story is set in 1925, about two Montana ranchers: Benedict Cumberbatch plays a cruel, complicated cowboy who is enraged when his brother (Jesse Plemons) brings home a wife (Kirsten Dunst) and her son (Kodi Smit-McPhee). All four were nominated for top acting Oscars.\n\n\"I'm not telling one of the crusty old Western stories,\" she told NPR. \"You know, from deep in the mythology where it's really only told from a kind of alpha male perspective.\"\n\nThe 67-year-old director shot the film on location in New Zealand, where she was born. She told NPR she loved cowboys and cowboy stories as a girl. \"We used to organize vegetable boxes to be like horses and then sit on them and ride and pretend that we were riding across the American West.\"\n\nIn 1993, Campion directed The Piano, which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, making her the first woman to win the award.

Campion was also nominated for best director, but lost the award to Steven Spielberg for Schindler's List.\n\nCampion had been the category frontrunner throughout this awards season. She won top prizes at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and the Director's Guild Awards.

Charlie has only scorn for McKee and great doubts about Donald's story idea, which involves a madman and a woman who are the same person with multiple personalities. But how, asks Charlie, do you put them in the same scene together, when one has the other locked in the basement?\n\nCharlie sweats blood over his screenplay. His copy of the book is thick with Post-It notes, the text painted with yellow and red high-lighters. He has highlighted about everything. In a sneaky way, a good part of the movie is just Charlie reading the book to us. Then he develops an erotic fixation with the author Susan (Meryl Streep), masturbating while imagining her bending tenderly to administer to him. He even flies to New York to meet her, but is paralyzed with shyness.\n\nThe third major character is John Laroche (Oscar winner Chris Cooper), a swamp rat with no front teeth, who lives at home with his dad and describes himself as \"probably the most brilliant man I know.\" At one time, he tells Susan, he had the largest collection of Dutch mirrors in the world. At another, he had a rare collection of tropical fish. He is the only man he knows who can breed the rare Ghost Orchid under glass. When he tires of an obsession, he drops it cold. \"Finished with fish,\" he says, and in context, it's one of the movie's funniest lines.\n\nHaving placed these characters onstage (as well as a studio executive played by Tilda Swinton, an agent played by Jay Tavare and various Indians and park rangers), Kaufman intercuts their scenes with scenes of himself creating them, and scenes from a McKee story conference. He lists all the things he hates in blockbusters: the chase, the shootings, the sex.\n\nAnd now I must tread carefully, so as not to spoil surprises (everything I've described so far is just the setup). Without going into details, what Kaufman does is create scenes that merge fact with his creative despair, his erotic imagination and the very kinds of scenes he loathes. Some of these scenes are possibly libelous. The real Orlean and Laroche must have signed waivers abandoning every possible legal recourse; they were very good sports. The scenes are also wildly audacious and hilarious, and you have the instinct that a few of them, such as Laroche driving Orlean in his van and taking her into the swamp, are \"based on\" truth.

In 1999, he adapted his 1985 novel The Cider House Rules into a screenplay. The film version, which starred Toby McGuire and Michael Caine, did very well and has endured almost as well as the book has. Irving received the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for his work. Many people wish he could have adapted more of his books for the screen.\n\nGone Girl by Gillian Flynn\n\nBook Buttons Embed ISBN: 9781594136054\n\nOne of the most popular books and movies of 2015 falls into the same category. Gillian Flynn began writing while working as a journalist for Entertainment Weekly. When the rights to her book were sold, she wanted to adapt it herself and director David Fischer didn\u2019t object. This proved to be a wise choice. Flynn did not receive an Oscar nomination for her work on the screenplay, but many thought she should.

Such was the case for Stephen Chbosky. Chbosky started his career as a screenwriter while dabbling in directing.

With the help of director Francis Ford Coppola, Punzo crafted a masterful screenplay that followed his skillful novel very closely.

Dahl didn\u2019t write the catchy songs that have become so popular, but that doesn\u2019t mean the film wasn\u2019t great. Both the book and it\u2019s adaptation have endured over decades, so much so that it was remade in 2005, although that version did not do as well, likely because it was missing Dahl\u2019s personal touch.\n\nFeatured image courtesy of thefilmexperience.com."}]}
