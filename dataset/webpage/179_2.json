But the free silver views of Mr. Sewall had at that time caused him to be classed by many of his friends in the East as a man who had gone wild on money questions. As a result of Mr. Cleveland's opposition to silver, Mr. Sewall fought against his renomination. He worked unceasingly for Cleveland's defeat at Chicago, standing for David B. Hill to the end but then came into line and helped elect the nominee. He never ceased to be an active member of the party. He was the unanimous choice of his party in Maine for United States Senator in 1892, and the attempt to turn him down at the State Convention by a resolution denouncing his free silver views failed.\n\nMr. Sewell was a delegate to the National Democratic Convention at Baltimore in 1872; at Cincinnati in 1880 and 1884; at St. Louis in 1888; and at Chicago in 1892 and 1896. At Chicago in July, 1896, he was one of the few advocates from New England of the free and unlimited coinage of silver. He was selected by the convention as their candidate for the office of Vice-president of the United States, and in an interview at the time voiced his sentiments on the platform as follows:\n\n\"There are thousands of business men in the East who are turning away from the single gold standard. It is not a class issue. In my opinion there is not a legitimate business in this country but that would be benefited by the restoration of silver to its rightful place in our national currency.\n\n\"I have been an advocate of silver ever since Congress\n\ndemonetized that metal in 1873. I held at the time that a mistake had been made, and have had no reason since to change my mind. \"There are two sides to every question, and as an individual banker I have a perfect right to take a position opposite to those who constitute the majority in the banking business. As I said before, this is not a technical question nor a class issue.\" Upon his return to his home in Bath he received an ovation from his fellow citizens long to be remembered by the staid people of that maritime town. The mayor warmly welcomed the nominee, and Mr. Sewall in the course of his reply to the warm welcome, said: \"It was a great convention, yet it did not seem to me to be a partisan one. It seemed more like the uprising of the people, and they seemed to be controlled by one idea, and that idea has filled me for years. They knew that this country is in deep distress, that it has been in distress for years, and that the great trouble is with our monetary system; and they believe as I believe, that there is only one remedy. They entertain no dishonest or dishonorable idea, but they demand that we be carried back to the money of our fathers, to that monetary system under which this government flourished for so many years, and they believe that is the only road to prosperity.\" \"The keynote of the Chicago platform is found in the Declaration of Independence. It simply implies that wherever the Government comes in contact with the citizen, wherever the citizen touches the Government, that all stand upon a common level, and there shall be equal rights to all and special privileges to no one. \"\u2014William J.

Sewall never held elective office, although he was a member of the Democratic National Committee from 1888 to 1896.\n\nArthur Sewall's main claim to fame had been as an exceptionally successful, wealthy shipbuilder and New England industrialist. He was a director of the Maine Central railroad and President of the Bath National Bank for years. His selection is believed to have been an effort to win votes among conservative and New England members of the party who were disturbed by the populist aspects of William Jennings Bryan. Arthur Sewall is also one of the few politicians to be an adherent of Swedenborgianism, a religion based on the writings of Swedish theologian Emanuel Swedenborg.\n\nHis main vice-presidential opponent, Garret A.

He was a lineal descendant of Henry Sewall, mayor of Coventry, England, one of whose grandsons was married to Jane Dummer, and emigrated to Newbury, MA, in 1634. Samuel Sewall, who settled at York, ME, in 1708, had two sons: David, first U.S. judge for the district of Maine, appointed by Washington, and Dummer Sewall, a distinguished soldier and the great grandfather of Arthur Sewall. The latter obtained a lieutenancy under Amherst in the Canada campaign, and in 1775 joined the revolutionary army as a lieutenant colonel. After the adoption of the constitution of Massachusetts, he was elected a senator from the state; he was also a memebr of the state convention which ratified the Constitution of the United States. The father of Arthur Sewall was one of the earliest and most prominent shipbuilder of Bath. He built his first ship, the Diana, a vessel of 199 tons burden, in 1823, and in 1841 launched the ship Rappahannock, which though of little over 1,000 tons burden, was at that time the largest ship afloat. He also held large interest in railroad and other important corporations. As his sons completed their education they joined their father in business, and Arthur on leaving shchool was sent in the interests of the firm to Prince Edward Island to buy timber for the shipyard at Bath. Returning, he entered the employs of his father's firm in 1853, and in 1854 formed, with his elder brother, the firm of E. & A. Sewall, which took over the business of the old firm of William D. Sewall and Clark & Sewall. On the death of the elder brother, in 1879, the name of the firm was changed to Arthur Sewall & Co., being made up of the senior partner, with his nephew, Samuel S. Sewall, and his second son, William D. Sewall. Since January, 1855, when the brothers launched their first ship, the Holyhead, a vessel of over 1,100 tons, one ship a year, on an average, has been built in the sewall shipyard. The largest and the best built wooden ships in the world are the product of this yad. With the giant Roanoke this era of ship-building was closed, and the firm turned its attention to building steel vessels, the ship Dirigo, launched in 1894, being the first of its class followed in quick succession by others of the largest size. Mr. Sewall had supreme faith in the ultimate maritime supremacy of the United States, and lost no opportunity, by public and private effort, to forward this end. He was prominent in other fields of commercial and industrial enterprise; was a director in the Maine Central railroad, and its president for nine years, 1884-93; was also president of the Eastern railroad, and the Boston and Maine, and director in the Mexican Central and other roads. He was president of the Bath National Bank, holding the office for 29 years, to the time of his death. He was the leader of the Democratic party in Maine, but held only minor political offices; was a delegate to the national Democratic convention at Baltimore in 1872; to that at Cincinnati in 1880, and delegate-at-large to that which nominated Cleveland in 1884. In 1888 he attended the convention at St. Louis, where he was elected a member of the Democratic national committee, and was a member of its executive committee for the campaign of that year. At the Chicago convention of 1892 he was elected to the same office. In 1896 he was nominated for the vice-presidency on the ticket with William J. Bryan. He was also a delegate to the national convention of 1900, and there elected again a member of the national committee. He was married in 1859, to Emma Duncan, daughter of Charles Crooker, a ship-builder and merchant, of Bath, ME, and, like her husband, a descendant of Samuel Sewall, of York. They had three sons, two of whom are living: Harold, consul-general at Samoa under Cleveland and Harrison; attached to the Berlin commission for the settlement of the Samoan affairs, and minister to Hawaii, under McKinley, to the time of its annexation, and William D.

Mr Burrough by his speech, prayer, protestation of his innocence, did much move unthinking persons, which occasions their speaking hardly concerning his being executed\u201d (Sewall 353.)\n\nA month later, on September 19, 1692, Giles Corey was pressed to death in a field in Salem, which Sewall also noted in his diary:\n\n\u201cMonday, Sept. 19, 1692, About noon, at Salem, Giles Corey was pressed to death for standing mute, much pains was used with him two days, one after another, by the court and Capt. Gardner of Nantucket who had been of his acquaintance: but all in vain.\u201d (Sewall 364.)\n\nSewall discussed Giles Corey in his diary again the following day:\n\n\u201cSept. 20. Now I hear from Salem that about 18 years ago, he was suspected to have stamped and pressed a man to death but was cleared. Twas not remembered till Anne Putnam was told of it by said Corey\u2019s spectre the Sabbath day night before the execution\u201d (Sewall 364.)\n\nAbout a month later in October of 1692, the Court of Oyer and Terminer was dissolved by Governor Phipps which Sewall also noted in his diary:\n\n\u201cOct. 29. Mr Russell asked whether the Court of Oyer and Terminer should sit, expressing some fear of inconvenience by its fall. Governour said it must fall\u201d (Sewall 368.)\n\nIn November of 1692, Sewall was appointed to the Superior Court of Judicature.\n\nSamuel Sewall After the Salem Witch Trials:\n\nOn January 14, 1697, the Massachusetts Bay Colony held a day of fasting in honor of the innocent people who were hanged during the Salem Witch Trials.\n\nOn that day, Sewall stood in front of the congregation at the South Church in Boston while Reverend Samuel Willard read Sewall\u2019s public apology for his role in the Salem Witch Trials.\n\nThe apology read:\n\n\u201cSamuel Sewall, sensible of the reiterated strokes of God upon himself and family, and being sensible, that as to the guilt contracted, upon the opening of the late commission of Oyer and Terminer at Salem (to which the order for this day relates) he is, upon many accounts, more concerned than any that he knows of, desires to take the blame and shame of it, asking pardon of men, and especially desiring prayers that God, who has unlimited authority, would pardon that sin and all his other sins, personal and relative: and according to his infinite benignity, and soveraignty, not visit the sin of him, or any other, upon himself or any of his, nor upon the land: But that he would powerfully defend him against all temptations to sin, for the future, and vouchsafe him the efficacious saving conduct of his word and spirit\u201d (Graham 45.)\n\nSewall was the only Salem Witch Trials judge to apologize. Many of the people involved in the trials acknowledged that mistakes were made and innocent people were hanged. What prompted Sewall to apologize and not the other judges is not exactly known.\n\nSewall also published his first book in 1697, which was titled Phaenomena Quaedam Apocalyptica ad Aspectum Novi Orbis Configurata.\n\nSamuel Sewall, illustration, published in The Border Wars of New England, circa 1897\n\nIn 1700, Sewall published The Selling of Joseph, which was an essay criticizing slavery and was one of the first of its kind.\n\nDuring his career, Sewall also presided over the trial of several pirates in Boston, such as Jack Quelch, whom he tried and sentenced to death in 1704.\n\nQuelch\u2019s piracy case was considered controversial at the time because Quelch was tried under admiralty law and thus without a jury, which many colonists considered illegal.\n\nSewall became of a Judge of Probate for Suffolk County in 1715.\n\nIn October of 1717, Sewall\u2019s wife Hannah died after a brief illness after which Sewall wrote in his diary:\n\n\u201cGod is teaching me a new lesson; to live a widower\u2019s life. Lord help me to learn; and be a sun and shield to me, now so much of my comfort and defense are taken away\u201d (Graham 32.)\n\nIn 1718, Sewall became a Chief Justice of the Superior Court of Judicature.\n\nSewall unsuccessfully courted Katherine Winthrop in 1719 and then remarried later that year, to Abigail Woodmansey Tilley but she died less than six months later in 1720.\n\nIn 1721, Sewall published A Memorial Relating to the Kennebeck Indians, which argued in favor of the humane treatment of Native Americans.\n\nSewall remarried again in 1722, to Mary Gibbs, but still mourned his first wife, Hannah, each year on the anniversary of her death.\n\nIn 1725, Sewall declined re-election to the Governor\u2019s Council.\n\nOn January 1, 1730, Samuel Sewall died in Boston, Massachusetts at the age of 78 years old.\n\nSources:\n\nGraham, Judith S.

He served for many years as the chief justice of the Massachusetts Superior Court of Judicature, the province's high court.BiographySewall was born in Bishopstoke, Hampshire, England, on March 28, 1652, the son of Henry and Jane (Dummer) Sewall. His father, son of the mayor of Coventry, had come to the English North American Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1635, where he married Sewall's mother and returned to England in the 1640s.Following the Restoration of Charles II to the English throne, the Sewalls again crossed the Atlantic in 1661, settling in Newbury, Massachusetts. It is there the young Samuel \"Sam\" grew up along the Parker River and Plum Island Sound.Like other local boys, he attended school at the home of James Noyes, whose cousin, Reverend Thomas Parker, was the principal instructor. From Parker, Sewall acquired a lifelong love of verse, which he wrote in both English and Latin. In 1667 Sewall entered Harvard College, where his classmates included Edward Taylor and Daniel Gookin, with whom he formed enduring friendships. Sewall received his first degree, a BA, in 1671, and his MA in 1674. In 1674 he served as librarian of Harvard for nine months, the second person to hold that post. That year he began keeping a journal, which he maintained for most of his life; it is one of the major historical documents of the time. In 1679 he became a member of the Military Company of Massachusetts.Sewall's involvement in the political affairs of the colony began when he became a freeman of the colony, giving him the right to vote. In 1681 he was appointed the official printer of the colony. One of the first works he published was John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress. After John Hull died in 1683, Sewall was elected to replace him on the colony's council of assistants, a body that functioned both as the upper house of the legislature and as a court of appeals. He also became a member of Harvard's Board of Overseers.Sewall's oral examination for the MA was a public affair and was witnessed by Hannah Hull, daughter of colonial merchant and mintmaster, John Hull. She was apparently taken by the young man's charms and pursued him. They were married in February 1676. Her father, whose work as mintmaster had made him quite wealthy, gave the couple \u00a3500 in colonial currency as a wedding gift. Biographer Richard Francis notes that the weight of this amount of specie, 125 pounds (57 kg), may have approximated the bride's weight, giving rise to Nathaniel Hawthorne's legend that the gift was her weight in coins. Sewall moved into his in-laws' mansion in Boston and was soon involved in that family's business and political affairs. He and Hannah had fourteen children before her death in 1717, although only a few survived to adulthood.He also entered local politics and was elevated to the position of assistant magistrate in the judiciary. In 1692 he was one of the nine judges appointed to the court of Oyer and Terminer in Salem, charged with trying those from Salem Town and elsewhere who were accused of witchcraft. His diary recounts many of the more famous episodes of the trials, such as the agonizing death under torture of Giles Corey, and reflects the growing public unease about the guilt of many of the accused. Sewall's brother Stephen had meanwhile opened up his home to one of the initially afflicted children, Betty Parris, daughter of Salem Village's minister, Samuel Parris, and shortly afterward Betty's \"afflictions\" appear to have subsided.Sewall was perhaps most remarkable among the justices involved in the trials in that he later regretted his role, going so far as to call for a public day of prayer, fasting, and reparations. Following the dissolution of the court, the Sewall family was blighted by what Sewall thought to be punishments from God. In the five years after the Trials, two of Sewall's daughters and Hannah's mother died, and Hannah gave birth to a stillborn child. What convinced Sewall of his need for public repentance was a recitation of Matthew 12:7, \"If ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless\". Not only had Sewall's home life been shaken, but in the years after the Trials, the people of Massachusetts came to see them as the culmination of a generation-long series of setbacks and ordeals, notably the Navigation Acts, the declaration of the New England Dominion, and King Philip's War. He saw this as a sign not that witchcraft did not exist, but that he had ruled on insubstantial evidence. He records in his diary that on 14 January 1697, he stood up in the meeting house he attended while his minister read out his confession of guilt.In 1693 Sewall was appointed an associate justice of the Superior Court of Judicature, the province's high court, by Governor Sir William Phips. In 1717, he was appointed its chief justice by Governor Samuel Shute.Sewall died in Boston, Massachusetts, on January 1, 1730, aged 77, and was interred in the family tomb at Boston's Granary Burying Ground.Sewall married three times. Hannah Hull, his first wife, died in 1717; two years later, in 1719, Sewall married Abigail (Melyen) Woodmansey Tilley, who died seven months later. In 1722, he married Mary (Shrimpton) Gibbs, who survived him. His nephew, Stephen, also served as a Massachusetts Chief Justice, as did his great-grandson Samuel.Views and writingsApart from his involvement in the Salem witch trials, Sewall was liberal in his views for the time. In 1700, he wrote and published The Selling of Joseph, a tract which argued a biblically-based case that slavery was unjustified and sinful. It was the first anti-slavery document ever published in New England and in North America broadly. Written like a sermon, Selling argued that \"Liberty is in real value next unto Life: None ought to part with it themselves, or deprive others of it, but upon the most mature Consideration.\" Enslaving people of Black African descent was contrary to God's design for the world because according to scripture, all humankind were \"the sons of Adam\" and \"of One Blood\" and had the same right to freedom. Freedom, including for Black Americans, Sewall wrote, should be valued more than profit. His title referred to the biblical story of Joseph, son of Israel, whose brothers unjustly sold him into slavery, comparing the enslavement of Black Americans to Joseph's own unjustified bondage. Selling still propagated a segregationist perspective, and Sewall claimed that Black Africans could not peacefully live among white New Englanders. Nevertheless, his argument against slavery was, at least according to one historian, a \"courageous\u2026 public stand\".Sewall had published Selling in response to learning that Boston judge John Saffin had refused to release a Black indentured servant named Adam and intended to perpetually enslave Adam. After Selling was released, Saffin issued a rebuttal arguing that social hierarchies were necessary and that enslaving Black Americans was divinely ordained. Adam was set free after a lengthy trial, but Saffin's rebuttal held greater sway among Bostonians, and chattel slavery persisted in Massachusetts. Selling was only reprinted twice (one in the 1700s and again in 1863), and it became an obscure document. Sewall's own nephew, also named Samuel Sewall, rejected his uncle's arguments against chattel slavery and continued participating in it as a business.His essay Talitha Cumi, first published in 1725, refers to the \"right of women.\" When the periwig became fashionable in New England, Sewall condemned the fashion vehemently, in contrast to Cotton Mather, who saw no reason why a Puritan should not wear a wig. Sewall's Journal, kept from 1673 to 1729, describes his life as a Puritan against the changing tide of colonial life as the devoutly religious community of Massachusetts gradually adopted more secular attitudes and emerged as a liberal, cosmopolitan-minded community.Cultural influenceThe Crucible (1996 film): Judge Samuel Sewall was played by actor George Gaynes. Notably, he is the first judge to begin doubting the circumstances, and by the end of the film, he is asking his superior, Judge Danforth, to end the trials as he and the townspeople have tired of the deaths and executions brought on by the court.BibliographyWorks written by Sewall include:The Revolution in New England Justified, 1691Phaenomena quaedam Apolyptica, 1697 online text (PDF version)The Selling of Joseph, 1700Proposals Touching the Accomplishment of Prophecies, 1713Diary of Samuel Sewall, 1674\u20131729.

Upon the Restoration of the Monarchy with Charles II\u2019s accession to the throne, the Sewall family emigrated to New England. There, Sewall continued his education and graduated from Harvard in 1674 with an MA. Soon thereafter, he married Hannah Hull (d. 1717), daughter of the wealthy John Hull (1624\u20131683), Master of the Mint of Massachusetts Bay Colony. Sewall remained in Boston, where he took his place as one of its wealthiest citizens. Despite his wealth, Sewall devoted much of his life to public service, a life he recorded in his now famous Diary.\n\nSewall managed Boston\u2019s printing press and served as deputy of the General Court in 1683 and as member of the Council from 1684 to 1686. He helped negotiate a restoration of the Massachusetts Charter, causing him to stay in England almost a full year. A new Charter was granted in 1692; it named Sewall as member of the Council, a position he held for thirty-three years. Also in 1692, he was appointed justice of the Superior Court; he eventually rose to be chief justice of Massachusetts (1718\u20131728).\n\nSir William Phips (1651\u20131695), the new governor of Massachusetts, placed Sewall as one of the three judges at the Salem witch trials (1692\u20131693) that condemned twelve people to death, eleven by hanging and one by pressing. Four years later, Sewall became the only one of these three judges to recant his judgment.\n\nIn 1700, he published what is thought to be the first American antislavery tract: The Selling of Joseph: A Memorial. Its title derives from the Biblical account of Joseph being sold into slavery in Egypt by his own brothers. The title speaks to Sewall\u2019s view that God\u2019s covenant with Adam and Eve gave all their \u201cheirs\u201d liberty. He countered arguments claiming blacks\u2019 descent from Noah\u2019s cursed son Ham\u2014 condemned to be slave to his brothers\u2014and pointed to the Bible\u2019s prohibition against kidnapping, an act by which most blacks were enslaved. Sewall maintained his views against slavery in the Boston News-Letter (June 12, 1706) and expanded upon them in his Diary. This Diary, which he kept from 1673 to 1729, was not published until 1787.\n\nForasmuch as Liberty is in real value next unto Life: None ought to part with it themselves, or deprive others of it, but upon most mature Consideration.\n\nThe Numerousness of Slaves at this day in the Province, and the Uneasiness of them under their Slavery, hath put many upon thinking whether the Foundation of it be firmly and well laid; so as to sustain the Vast Weight that is built upon it. It is most certain that all Men, as they are the Sons of Adam, are Coheirs; and have equal Right unto Liberty, and all other outward Comforts of Life. GOD hath given the Earth [with all its Commodities] unto the Sons of Adam, Psal 115. 16. And hath made of One Blood, all Nations of Men, for to dwell on all the face of the Earth; and hath determined the Times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation: That they should seek the Lord. Forasmuch then as we are the Offspring of GOD &c. Act 17.26, 27, 29. Now although the Title given by the last ADAM, doth infinitely better Mens Estates, respecting GOD and themselves; and grants them a most beneficial and inviolable Lease under the Broad Seal of Heaven, who were before only Tenants at Will: Yet through the Indulgence of GOD to our First Parents after the Fall, the outward Estate of all and every of the Children, remains the same, as to one another. So that Originally, and Naturally, there is no such thing as Slavery. Joseph was rightfully no more a Slave to his Brethren, then they were to him: and they had no more Authority to Sell him, than they had to Slay him. And if they had nothing to do to Sell him; the Ishmaelites bargaining with them, and paying down Twenty pieces of Silver, could not make a Title. Neither could Potiphar have any better Interest in him than the Ishmaelites had. Gen. 37. 20, 27, 28. For he that shall in this case plead Alteration of Property, seems to have forfeited a great part of his own claim to Humanity. There is no proportion between Twenty Pieces of Silver, and LIBERTY. The Commodity it self is the Claimer. If Arabian Gold be imported in any quantities, most are afraid to meddle with it, though they might have it at easy rates; lest if it should have been wrongfully taken from the Owners, it should kindle a fire to the Consumption of their whole Estate. \u2019Tis pity there should be more Caution used in buying a Horse, or a little lifeless dust; than there is in purchasing Men and Women: Whenas they are the Offspring of GOD, and their Liberty is,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Auro pretiosior Omni.\n\nAnd seeing GOD hath said, He that Stealeth a Man and Selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to Death. Exod. 12.16. This Law being of Everlasting Equity, wherein Man Stealing is ranked amongst the most atrocious of Capital Crimes: What louder Cry can there be made of the Celebrated Warning,\n\nCaveat Emptor!\n\nAnd all thing considered, it would conduce more to the Welfare of the Province, to have White Servants for a Term of Years, than to have Slaves for Life. Few can endure to hear of a Negro\u2019s being made free; and indeed they can seldom use their freedom well; yet their continual aspiring after their forbidden Liberty, renders them Unwilling Servants. And there is such a disparity in their Conditions, Color & Hair, that they can never embody with us, and grow up into orderly Families, to the Peopling of the Land: but still remain in our Body Politick as a kind of extravasat Blood. As many Negro men as there are among us, so many empty places there are in our Train Bands, and the places taken up of Men that might make Husbands for our Daughters. And the Sons and Daughters of New England would become more like Jacob, and Rachel, if this Slavery were thrust quite out of doors. Moreover it is too well known what Temptations Masters are under, to connive at the Fornification of their Slaves; lest they should be obliged to find them Wives, or pay their Fines. It seems to be practically pleaded that they might be Lawless; \u2019tis thought much of, that the Law should have Satisfaction for their Thefts, and other Immoralities; by which means, Holiness to the Lord, is more rarely engraven upon this sort of Servitude. It is likewise most lamentable to think, how in taking Negros out of Africa, and Selling of them here, That which GOD ha\u2019s joyned together men do boldly rend asunder; Men from their Country, Husbands from their Wives, Parents from their Children. How horrible is the Uncleanness, Mortality, if not Murder, that the Ships are guilty of that bring great Crouds of these miserable Men, and Women. Methinks, when we are bemoaning the barbarous Usage of our Friends and Kinsfolk in Africa: it might not be unseasonable to inquire whether we are not culpable in forcing the Africans to become Slaves amongst our selves. And it may be a question whether all the Benefit received by Negro Slaves, will balance the Accompt of Cash laid out upon them; and for the Redemption of our own enslaved Friends out of Africa. Besides all the Persons and Estates that have perished there.\n\nObj. 1. These Blackamores are of the Posterity of Cham, and therefore are under the Curse of Slavery. Gen. 9.25, 26, 27.\n\nAnsw. Of all Offices, one would not begg this; viz. Uncall\u2019d for, to be an Executioner of the Vindictive Wrath of God; the extent and duration of which is to us uncertain. If this ever was a Commission; How do we know but that it is long since out of date? Many have found it to their Cost, that a Prophetical Denunciation of Judgment against a Person or People, would not warrant them to inflict that evil. If it would, Hazael might justify himself in all he did against his Master, and the Israelites, from 2 Kings 8. 10, 12.\n\nBut it is possible that by cursory reading, this Text may have been mistaken. For Canaan is the Person Cursed three times over, without the mentioning of Cham. Good Expositors suppose the Curse entailed on him, and that this Prophesie was accomplished in the Extirpation of the Canaanites, and in the Servitude of the Gibeonites, Vide Pareum. Whereas the Blackmores are not descended of Canaan, but of Cush. Psal. 68. 31. Princes shall come out of Egypt [Mizraim] Ethopia [Cush] shall soon stretch out her hands unto God. Under which Names, all Africa may be comprehended; and the Promised Conversion ought to be prayed for. Jer. 13, 23. Can the Ethiopian change his skin? This shews that Black Men are the Posterity of Cush: Who time out of mind have been distinguished by their Colour. And for want of the true, Ovid assigns a fabulous cause of it.\n\nSanguine tum credunt in corpora summa vocato \u00c6thiopum populos nigrum traxisse colorem. Metamorph. lib.2.\n\nObj. 2. The Nigers are brought out of a Pagan Country, into places where the Gospel is Preached.\n\nAnsw. Evil must not be done, that good may come of it. The extraordinary and comprehensive Benefit accruing to the Church of God, and to Joseph personally, did not rectify his brethrens Sale of him.\n\nObj. 3. The Africans have Wars with one another: our Ships bring lawful Captives taken in those Wars.\n\nAnsw. For ought is known, their Wars are much such as were between Jacob\u2019s Sons and their Brother Joseph. If they be between Town and Town; Provincial, or National: Every War is upon one side Unjust. An Unlawful War can\u2019t make lawful Captives. And by Receiving, we are in danger to promote, and partake in their Barbarous Cruelties. I am sure, if some Gentlemen should go down to the Brewsters to take the Air, and Fish: And a stronger party from Hull should Surprise them, and Sell them for Slaves to a Ship outward bound: they would think themselves unjustly dealt with; both by Sellers and Buyers. And yet \u2018tis to be feared, we have no other kind of Title to our Nigers. Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the Law and the Prophets. Matt. 7. 12.\n\nObj. 4. Abraham had servants bought with his Money, and born in his House.\n\nAnsw. Until the Circumstances of Abraham\u2019s purchase be recorded, no Argument can be drawn from it. In the mean time, Charity obliges us to conclude, that He knew it was lawful and good.\n\nIt is Observable that the Israelites were strictly forbidden the buying, or selling one another for Slaves. Levit. 25. 39, 46. Jer. 34. 8\u2014\u201422. And GOD gaged His Blessing in lieu of any loss they might conceipt they suffered thereby. Deut. 15. 18. And since the partition Wall is broken down, inordinate Self love should likewise be demolished. GOD expects that Christians should be of a more Ingenuous and benign frame of spirit. Christians should carry it to all the World, as the Israelites were to carry it one towards another. And for men obstinately to persist in holding their Neighbours and Brethren under the Rigor of perpetual Bondage, seems to be no proper way of gaining Assurance that God ha\u2019s given them Spiritual Freedom. Our Blessed Saviour ha\u2019s altered the Measures of the Ancient Love-Song, and set it to a most Excellent New Tune, which all ought to be ambitious of Learning. Matt. 5. 43, 44. John 13. 34. These Ethiopians, as black as they are; seeing they are the Sons and Daughters of the First Adam, the Brethren and Sister of the Last ADAM, and the Offspring of GOD; They ought to be treated with a Respect agreeable.\n\nServitus perfecta voluntaria, inter Christianum & Christiainum, ex parte servi patientis saepe est licita, quia est necessaria: sed ex parte domini agentis, & procurando & exercendo, vix potest esse licita: quia non convenit regulae illi generali:\n\nQuaecunque volueritis ut faciant vobis homines, ita & vos facite eis.

He is perhaps best known for making a dramatic public apology for the role he played as a judge in the Salem witch trials, which resulted in the executions of nineteen people. Sewall is also famous for his diary, a remarkable work that spans more than fifty years and provides modern historians with a vivid picture of life in Puritan New England. (The Puritans were a Christian group who observed strict moral and spiritual codes; they controlled social and political life in Massachusetts.) Sewall also was one of the first colonists to speak out against the keeping of African slaves.\n\nBegins long public career\n\nSamuel Sewall was born in Hampshire, England, on March 28, 1652, the son of Henry and Jane (Dummer) Sewall. When he was nine years old, his parents emigrated (moved from one country to another) to Newbury, Massachusetts, where he was educated at a private school. In 1671 he graduated from Harvard College with a bachelor's degree and three years later earned a master's degree from the same institution. Sewall was then ordained a minister, but he left the church to go into business when he married Hannah Hull in 1675. Sewall's father-in-law, John Hull, was the master of the mint (a government agency that prints money) for the Massachusetts Bay Colony and therefore had extensive connections in the business community. At Hull's urging, Sewall moved to Boston in 1681 to take over management of the colony's printing press. By the early 1690s he was a prominent figure in Boston business and political circles. He was a banker, publisher, international trader, and member of the colonial court. Although Sewall had no formal legal training, he also served as a judge (at that time a law degree was not required).\n\nSewall began his long career as a government official in 1683, when he was appointed to the general court. The following year he was elected to the Massachusetts council (governing body). While visiting England on business in 1684, he became involved in unsuccessful efforts to convince British officials to maintain the Massachusetts Bay Colony charter in its present form. Massachusetts Bay was the only self-governing English colony in America (see John Winthrop entry). However, Britain revoked the charter because Massachusetts Bay officials were illegally operating a mint. They were also basing voting rights on religious affiliation instead of property ownership and discriminating against Anglicans (members of the Church of England, the official religion of the country); the majority of the Massachusetts colonists were Puritans.\n\nThe Salem witch trials\n\nIn 1691 Britain forced the Massachusetts Bay Colony to accept a charter that united it with Plymouth (see William Bradford entry) and Maine (see Ferdinando Gorges box in Thomas Morton entry) to form the Massachusetts colony. Under the new charter, church membership could no longer be a requirement for voting, although Congregationalism (a branch of Puritanism organized according to independent church congregations) remained the established (official) church. Sewall was named a councilor (advisor) in the new royal government, a position he held until 1725, when he decided not to seek reelection.\n\nHistorians note that the loss of the original charter led to widespread anxiety in Massachusetts, which may be one of the main reasons for the infamous witchcraft hysteria that followed. Puritan officials believed the colony was under an evil spell cast by witches (people, usually women, with supernatural powers), who had signed a compact with the Devil, the ultimate evil force. Witches were supposedly seeking revenge on particular members of the community. According to the Puritans, the compact empowered a witch to perform such acts as causing a child's death, making crops fail, preventing cream from being churned into butter, or producing sterility (inability to conceive offspring) in cattle. They also believed witches entered the bodies of animals and became beings called \"familiars\" who prowled around undetected. Yet the witches could be discovered through other forms of witchcraft. The prominent Puritan leader Increase Mather (see box in Cotton Mather entry) wrote Remarkable Providence, a handbook on how to identify a witch. He actively supported holding trials to rid the colony of witches.\n\n\"the blame and shame of it\"\n\nSamuel Sewall regretted his participation as a judge in the Salem witch trials of 1692\u201393. On January 14, 1697\u2014a special day of atonement set aside by the Massachusetts legislature\u2014Sewall stood and faced the congregation in the Old South Church at Boston. The Reverend Samuel Willard then read aloud this statement Sewall had written:\n\nSamuel Sewall, sensible of the reiterated [repeated] strokes of God upon himself and his family; and being sensible, that as to the guilt contracted, upon the opening of the late Commission of Oyer and Terminator [the court that conducted the witchcraft trials] at Salem (to which the order for this day relates), he is, upon many accounts, more concerned than any that he knows of, desires to take the blame and shame of it, asking pardon of men, and especially desiring prayers that God, who has an unlimited authority, would pardon that sin and all his other sins; personal and relative: And according to his infinite benignity [kindness], and sovereignty [supreme power], not visit the sin of him, or of any other, upon himself or any of his, nor upon the land: But that He [God] would powerfully defend him against all temptations to sin, for the future; and vouchsafe him the efficacious [having the power to produce a desired effect], saving conduct of his word and spirit.\n\nReprinted in: Gunn, Giles, ed. Early American Writing. New York: Penguin Books, 1994, pp. 246\u201347.\n\nIn June 1692, when the Puritans decided to hold formal witch trials in Salem, Massachusetts governor William Phips appointed Sewall as a special commissioner (judge) on the court. Meeting in July and August, Sewall and the other judges interrogated suspected witches and gave them a chance to reject the validity of their compact with the Devil. A suspected witch was usually falsely accused by other members of the community, and soon widespread accusations paralyzed the area. If the suspects opened themselves to God, they would be reaccepted into the community. But many did not repent. The court ultimately sentenced nineteen people, most of whom were women, to death. The executions were carried out in September: eighteen were hanged and a man was crushed to death. Almost immediately Sewall began to regret the role he played in this tragedy, and the guilt weighed increasingly upon his conscience. In fact, he felt he had greater responsibility in the matter than any of the other judges.\n\nRecants role in trials\n\nBy 1697 Massachusetts officials realized that witchcraft hysteria was out of control and that the trials had been a terrible mistake, so the legislature designated January 14 as a special day of atonement (expression of regret and request for forgiveness). Taking this opportunity to make a public confession of his sins, Sewall wrote an admission of error and guilt. Then he stood and faced the congregation in the Old South Church at Boston as the Reverend Samuel Willard read the statement aloud. Sewall was the only judge who publicly admitted his own guilt. Increase Mather and his son Cotton, who were a motivating force behind the witch hunts, eventually were instrumental in bringing the trials to an end. Yet the Mathers expressed their doubts only in published written works.\n\nOpposes slavery\n\nAfter Sewall made his public apology he continued to be a part of governmental affairs and held various judicial offices. He also became involved in abolitionist (antislavery) efforts. In 1700 he published The Selling of Joseph, an essay in which he argued against the keeping of African slaves. Now considered one of the earliest antislavery statements, it is frequently reprinted in American history and literature texts. (Quaker minister John Woolman (see entry) is credited with organizing the first successful abolitionist movement, in 1743.) Sewall also advocated that Native Americans be placed on reservations and taught the English language and social customs. Colonial governments had been adopting this policy since the mid-1600s. The reservation system eventually resulted in the total extinction of the Native American way of life by the early nineteenth century.\n\nWrites famous diary\n\nSewall wrote numerous historical and religious works as well as unpublished poetry during his lifetime. He is best known, however, for his diary, in which he gave a vivid picture of Puritan life in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century New England. (The diary spans the period from 1674 to 1729; there were no entries from 1677 to 1685.) Sewall was married three times. Hannah Sewall, with whom he had fourteen children, died in 1717. In 1719 he wed Abigail Melyen, who died the following year. One of the most amusing passages in Sewall's diary is his account of courting (seeking to marry) Katherine Winthrop. He wrote that he gave her such gifts as sermons, gingerbread, and sugared almonds. Yet she would not be won over unless he promised to wear a wig and buy a coach. Finally unable to reach a marriage agreement with Winthrop, Sewall turned his affections elsewhere and, at age seventy, took Mary Gibbs as his third wife. He died eight years later, in 1730.\n\nfrom The Selling of Joseph\n\nSamuel Sewall had long been troubled by the practice of slavery in the American colonies, but he had never acted on his views. Then, while he was serving as a judge in the Massachusetts General Court, he had to make a decision on a petition to free an African couple who were being held in bondage. Sewall therefore resolved to issue a public statement against the holding of African slaves. The result was The Selling of Joseph (1700), which is considered one of the earliest expressions of the abolitionist cause. The Joseph in the title is one of the heroes in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament of the Bible. The favorite son of Jacob and Rachel, Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers. They were jealous of his ambitions and the coat of many colors that Jacob had given to him.\n\nIn the opening of The Selling of Joseph Sewall argued that \"originally, and naturally, there is no such thing as slavery. Joseph was rightfully no more a slave to [his brothers] than they were to him; and they had no more authority to sell him than they had to slay him. . . . 'Tis pity there should be more caution used in buying a horse, or a little lifeless dust, than there is in purchasing men and women. . . .\" Sewall went on to compare Joseph's situation with that of African slaves: \"It is likewise most lamentable to think how, in taking negroes out of Africa and selling of them here, that which God has joined together men do boldly rend asunder; men from their country, husbands from their wives, parents from their children. How horrible is the uncleanness, immorality, if not murder, that the [slave] ships are guilty of that bring great crowds of these miserable men and women [to America]. . . . \"\n\nReprinted in: Gunn, Giles, ed.

He was a lineal descendant of Henry Sewall, mayor of Coventry, England, one of whose grandsons was married to Jane Dummer, and emigrated to Newbury, MA, in 1634. Samuel Sewall, who settled at York, ME, in 1708, had two sons: David, first U.S. judge for the district of Maine, appointed by Washington, and Dummer Sewall, a distinguished soldier and the great grandfather of Arthur Sewall. The latter obtained a lieutenancy under Amherst in the Canada campaign, and in 1775 joined the revolutionary army as a lieutenant colonel. After the adoption of the constitution of Massachusetts, he was elected a senator from the state; he was also a memebr of the state convention which ratified the Constitution of the United States. The father of Arthur Sewall was one of the earliest and most prominent shipbuilder of Bath. He built his first ship, the Diana, a vessel of 199 tons burden, in 1823, and in 1841 launched the ship Rappahannock, which though of little over 1,000 tons burden, was at that time the largest ship afloat. He also held large interest in railroad and other important corporations. As his sons completed their education they joined their father in business, and Arthur on leaving shchool was sent in the interests of the firm to Prince Edward Island to buy timber for the shipyard at Bath. Returning, he entered the employs of his father's firm in 1853, and in 1854 formed, with his elder brother, the firm of E. & A. Sewall, which took over the business of the old firm of William D. Sewall and Clark & Sewall. On the death of the elder brother, in 1879, the name of the firm was changed to Arthur Sewall & Co., being made up of the senior partner, with his nephew, Samuel S. Sewall, and his second son, William D. Sewall. Since January, 1855, when the brothers launched their first ship, the Holyhead, a vessel of over 1,100 tons, one ship a year, on an average, has been built in the sewall shipyard. The largest and the best built wooden ships in the world are the product of this yad. With the giant Roanoke this era of ship-building was closed, and the firm turned its attention to building steel vessels, the ship Dirigo, launched in 1894, being the first of its class followed in quick succession by others of the largest size. Mr. Sewall had supreme faith in the ultimate maritime supremacy of the United States, and lost no opportunity, by public and private effort, to forward this end. He was prominent in other fields of commercial and industrial enterprise; was a director in the Maine Central railroad, and its president for nine years, 1884-93; was also president of the Eastern railroad, and the Boston and Maine, and director in the Mexican Central and other roads. He was president of the Bath National Bank, holding the office for 29 years, to the time of his death. He was the leader of the Democratic party in Maine, but held only minor political offices; was a delegate to the national Democratic convention at Baltimore in 1872; to that at Cincinnati in 1880, and delegate-at-large to that which nominated Cleveland in 1884. In 1888 he attended the convention at St. Louis, where he was elected a member of the Democratic national committee, and was a member of its executive committee for the campaign of that year. At the Chicago convention of 1892 he was elected to the same office. In 1896 he was nominated for the vice-presidency on the ticket with William J. Bryan. He was also a delegate to the national convention of 1900, and there elected again a member of the national committee. He was married in 1859, to Emma Duncan, daughter of Charles Crooker, a ship-builder and merchant, of Bath, ME, and, like her husband, a descendant of Samuel Sewall, of York. They had three sons, two of whom are living: Harold, consul-general at Samoa under Cleveland and Harrison; attached to the Berlin commission for the settlement of the Samoan affairs, and minister to Hawaii, under McKinley, to the time of its annexation, and William D.

He served for many years as the chief justice of the Massachusetts Superior Court of Judicature, the province's high court.\n\nSamuel Sewall was born in Bishopstoke, Hampshire, England, on March 28, 1652, the son of Henry and Jane (Dummer) Sewall. His father, son of the mayor of Coventry, had come to the English North American Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1635, where he married Sewall's mother, and returned to England in the 1640s. Following the restoration of Charles II to the English throne, the Sewalls again crossed the Atlantic in 1661, settling in Newbury, Massachusetts. It is there the young Samuel \"Sam\" grew up along the Parker River and Plum Island Sound. Like other local boys he attended school at the home of James Noyes, whose cousin, Reverend Thomas Parker, was the principal instructor. From Parker Sewall acquired a lifelong love of verse, which he wrote in both English and Latin.\n\nIn 1667 Sewall entered Harvard College, where his classmates included Edward Taylor and Daniel Gookin, both of whom he formed enduring friendships with. Sewall received his first degree, a BA, in 1671, and his MA in 1674. In 1674 he began keeping a journal, which he maintained for most of his life; it is one of the major historical documents of the time.\n\nSewall's involvement in the political affairs of the colony began when he became a freeman of the colony, giving him the right to vote. In 1681 he was appointed the official printer of the colony; one of the first works he published was John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress. After John Hull died in 1683, Sewall was elected to replace him on the colony's council of assistants, a body that functioned both as the upper house of the legislature and as a court of appeals. He also became a member of Harvard's Board of Overseers.\n\nSewall's oral examination for the MA was a public affair, and was witnessed by Hannah Hull, daughter of colonial merchant and mintmaster John Hull. She was apparently taken by the young man's charms, and pursued him; they were married in February 1676. Her father, whose work as mintmaster had made him quite wealthy, gave the couple \u00a3500 in colonial currency as a wedding gift. (Biographer Richard Francis notes that the weight of this amount of specie, 125 pounds (57 kg), may have approximated the bride's weight, giving rise to Nathaniel Hawthorne's legend that the gift was her weight in coins.) Sewall moved into his in-laws' mansion in Boston, and was soon involved in that family's business and political affairs. He and Hannah would have fourteen children before her death in 1717, although only a few survived to adulthood.\n\nHe also entered local politics, and was elevated to the position of assistant magistrate in the judiciary that in 1692 judged the people in Salem accused of witchcraft. His diary recounts many of the more famous episodes of the Trials, such as the agonizing death under torture of Giles Corey, and reflects the growing public unease about the guilt of many of the accused. Sewall was perhaps most remarkable among the magistrates involved in the trials in that he was the only magistrate who, some years later, publicly regretted his role, going so far as to call for a public day of prayer, fasting, and reparations. In Salem, Sewall's brother Stephen had opened up his home to one of the initially afflicted children, Betty Parris, daughter of Salem Village's Reverend Samuel Parris, and shortly afterward Betty's 'afflictions' appear to have subsided.\n\nIn 1693 Sewall was appointed an associate justice of the Superior Court of Judicature, the province's high court, by Governor Sir William Phips. In 1717, he was appointed its chief justice by Governor Samuel Shute. Poem by Nehemiah Hobart in Latin, printed by Samuel Sewall, Boston, 1712\n\nSewall died in Boston, Massachusetts, on January 1, 1730 at age 77 and was interred in the family tomb at Boston's Granary Burying Ground.\n\nSewall married three times. Hannah Hull, his first wife, died in 1717; two years later, in 1719, Sewall married Abigail (Melyen) Woodmansey Tilley, who died seven months later. In 1722, he married Mary (Shrimpton) Gibbs, who survived him. His nephew Stephen also served as a Massachusetts chief justice, as did his great grandson Samuel.\n\nApart from his involvement in the Salem witch trials, Sewall was somewhat liberal in his views for the time. In The Selling of Joseph (1700), for instance, he came out strongly against slavery, making him one of the earliest colonial abolitionists. There he argued, \"Liberty is in real value next unto Life: None ought to part with it themselves, or deprive others of it, but upon the most mature Consideration.\" He regarded \"man-stealing as an atrocious crime which would introduce among the English settlers people who would remain forever restive and alien,\" but he also believed that \"There is such a disparity in their Conditions, Colour, Hair, that they can never embody with us, and grow up into orderly Families, to the Peopling of the Land.\" Although holding such segregationist views, he maintained that \"These Ethiopians, as black as they are; seeing they are the Sons and Daughters of the First Adam, the Brethren and Sisters of the Last ADAM, and the Offspring of God; They ought to be treated with a Respect agreeable.\"\n\nHis essay \"Talitha Cumi\", first published in 1725, refers to the \"right of women.\" When the periwig became fashionable in New England, Sewall condemned the fashion vehemently, in contrast to Cotton Mather, who saw no reason why a Puritan should not wear a wig.\n\nHis Journal, kept from 1673 to 1729, describes his life as a Puritan against the changing tide of colonial life, as the devoutly religious community of Massachusetts gradually adopted more secular attitudes and emerged as a liberal, cosmopolitan-minded community. As such, the diary is an important work for understanding the transformation of the colony in the decades before the American Revolutio\n\nSamuel Sewall (/\u02c8su\u02d0\u0259l/; March 28, 1652 \u2013 January 1, 1730) was a judge, businessman, and printer in the Province of Massachusetts Bay, best known for his involvement in the Salem witch trials,[1] for which he later apologized, and his essay The Selling of Joseph (1700), which criticized slavery.[2] He served for many years as the chief justice of the Massachusetts Superior Court of Judicature, the province's high court.\n\nSources\n\nSee also:"}, {"url": "https://thehistoryjunkie.com/samuel-sewell-and-the-salem-witch-trials/", "page_content": "Samuel Sewall was a judge during the Salem Witch Trials that took place in Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1692.

As the Populist Party nominee, Bryan had another running mate as well, Thomas E. Watson. Sewall never held elective office, although he was a member of the Democratic National Committee from 1888 to 1896.\n\nArthur Sewall's main claim to fame had been as an exceptionally successful, wealthy shipbuilder and New England industrialist. He was a director of the Maine Central railroad and President of the Bath National Bank for years. His selection is believed to have been an effort to win votes among conservative and New England members of the party who were disturbed by the populist aspects of William Jennings Bryan. Arthur Sewall is also one of the few politicians to be an adherent of Swedenborgianism, a religion based on the writings of Swedish theologian Emanuel Swedenborg.\n\nHis main vice-presidential opponent, Garret A. Hobart (Rep), was also an Eastern banker and industrialist who had served on his party's national committee.\n\nSewall was Bryan's running mate for the first of Bryan's three times as the Democratic presidential nominee. He died not long after Bryan was nominated for the second time in 1900.\n\nSewall's grandson, Sumner Sewall, served as Governor of Maine from 1941 to 1945, as a Republican.\n\nLegacy\n\nIn 2008, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch referenced Sewall in an article criticizing Senator John McCain's selection of Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice presidential candidate in the 2008 presidential election, saying he had picked \"the least qualified running mate since the Swedenborgian shipbuilder Arthur Sewall ran as William Jennings Bryan's No. 2 in 1896.\""}]}
