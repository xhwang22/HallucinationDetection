{"George Hubbard Clapp was a member of the Union League of Philadelphia and the Philadelphia Club.": [{"url": "https://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/essays/union-league-of-philadelphia/", "page_content": "Essay\n\nThe Union League of Philadelphia, organized in 1862 as a political club for the support of the Union cause during the Civil War, developed into the premier urban social club of Philadelphia. Over time, it also became an important supporter of Republican political candidates and policies locally and nationally, acquired a significant collection of art and sculpture, and established various relief and civic programs for soldiers, veterans, and youth in the Philadelphia area.\n\nAt the time of Union League\u2019s founding, Philadelphia was still a divided city with many economic, social, and cultural ties to the South. Indeed, before 1860 Philadelphia, with its proximity to the slaveholding South, had developed into what Pennsylvania political leader Alexander K. McClure (1828-1909) called \u201cthe great emporium of Southern commerce.\u201d Although Philadelphia had been the home of the earliest American anti-slavery society, the Pennsylvania Abolition Society, its record as a haven of abolitionist feeling was never significantly high. In the election of 1860, it gave Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln only a token majority of 2,039 votes out of over 76,000 cast. When civil war broke out in 1861, pro-Union Philadelphians were incensed that Philadelphians \u201cwho were almost in league with the Southern traitors were walking with heads high among our people.\u201d\n\nThe League Takes Shape\n\nIn November 1862, a small group of pro-Union Philadelphians met at the home of George H. Boker (1823-90), Philadelphia poet and playwright, at 1720 Walnut Street to form a \u201cUnion Club\u201d that would act as a social successor to the Wistar Party (a voluntary association of prominent Philadelphia \u201cgentlemen\u201d who were members of the American Philosophical Society but had broken up over sectional issues) and an alternative to the politically-divided Philadelphia Club. But men like Boker thought a more politically active group was needed, and at the Union Club\u2019s meeting of December 27, 1862 (at the home of Dr. John Forsyth Meigs [1818-82] at 1208 Walnut Street), adopted articles of association for an additional \u201cUnion League of Philadelphia.\u201d Like the Union Club, the league\u2019s only condition of membership was \u201cunqualified loyalty to the government of the United States, and unwavering support of its efforts for the suppression of the Rebellion,\u201d but its primary task was activist: \u201cto discountenance and rebuke by moral and social influences all disloyalty to the Federal government \u2026 .\u201d As a headquarters, the league initially rented space in the Hartman Kuhn mansion at 1118 Chestnut Street.\n\nThe league\u2019s first general meeting for business convened on January 22, 1863, and elected former U.S. Treasury Secretary William Morris Meredith (1799-1873) as its first president and George H. Boker, the first secretary. Its first project was a series of pro-Union publications that could be distributed across the North by direct mail. Eventually, over the course of the war, the League\u2019s Board of Publication issued over four and half million copies of 145 separate pamphlets, and employed a staff of twelve just to handle distribution. The league also raised money to provide bonuses for soldier recruitment, and in 1863 sponsored the organization of five Black regiments (3rd, 6th, 8th, 22nd and 25th U.S. Colored Troops) in Philadelphia and a \u201cFree Military School\u201d to train their officers. On June 16, 1863, the league played host to President Lincoln, visiting Philadelphia just after his nomination for a second term as president. By the end of the war, the league\u2019s membership had grown to over a thousand, with almost half that number serving at some point in uniform.\n\nThe prestige it had successfully amassed during the war assured the league, and the Republican Party, a dominant place in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania politics, and helped usher in a Republican ascendency in Philadelphia that prevailed with little interruption for nine decades. As one indication of its self-confidence and status, the league built a new League House at Broad and Sansom Streets, turning away from the popular Greek revival style of Philadelphia\u2019s pre-war architecture in favor of a lavish Second Empire building. The league, meanwhile, endorsed Radical Reconstruction, including Black civil rights, and made streetcar desegregation in Philadelphia one of its most successful post-war campaigns. In retaliation, an arsonist attacked the league\u2019s new house on September 7, 1866, forcing the rebuilding of the upper floors and delaying its reopening until 1867.\n\nIn the post-Reconstruction decades, the league began a lengthy self-transformation into a cultural as well as a political institution. In 1882, the league established its own Art Association, which not only bought art works for the League House, but made the league the most important sponsor of city-wide art exhibitions until the opening of the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the 1920s. In 1880, the league began purchasing properties along Moravian and Sansom Streets in preparation for constructing its first annex. In 1909 the cornerstone of the league\u2019s final addition (extending to Fifteenth Street) was laid, with the Philadelphia architectural prodigy Horace Trumbauer (1868-1938) as its designer.\n\nAt the turn of the century, the league remained politically prominent in Republican politics at all levels. Of the seven governors of Pennsylvania between Reconstruction and 1906, five were league members. In Philadelphia, one of the league founders, Morton McMichael (1807-79), was elected mayor in 1866, and of the next eleven mayors up to 1916, eight were active Union Leaguers. But in the twentieth century, as the Republican ascendency built by the Civil War passed from the scene, the Union League lost its political influence, and increasingly turned inward as a refuge for the city\u2019s business elites. After 1916, not a single Republican mayor of Philadelphia was a league member, and eventually, not a single member of the Republican City Committee; only one governor thereafter, William Sproul (1870-1928), belonged to the league.\n\nThe onset of the Great Depression jolted the league, and although the league was the first civil organization in the city to raise money for unemployment relief, the league itself suffered a 17 percent decline in active membership. It was also sharply critical of the New Deal policies of Democratic president Franklin D. Roosevelt; indeed, league president Otto Robert Heligman (1879-1941) called for the league\u2019s rolls to be purged of any members who had voted for Roosevelt. When Roosevelt was reelected as president in 1936, a jubilant throng of Roosevelt supporters paraded down Broad Street to the league, where Democratic City Committee chairman John B. Kelly (1889-1960) climbed up the front portico of the League House and tore down the league flag.\n\nThe two world wars brought the league back into action as a visible patriotic organization. As Judge William W. Porter (1856-1928) reminded the league\u2019s annual meeting after America\u2019s entrance into the First World War in 1917, the founders of the league had never said a word about creating a \u201csocial\u201d club. \u201cLiberty Loans\u201d managed by the league raised $17 million to support American involvement, and 200 of the league\u2019s 2,600 members served in uniform. When the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought the United States into the Second World War, the league once again launched large fund-raising campaigns, and 187 league members joined the armed forces.\n\nIn 1959, facing the consequences of declining membership and significance, league president James M. Anderson (1900-77) appointed a committee to invent ways of keeping the league vital. Anderson chose for the committee chair J. Permar Richards (1915-2004), a former Olympic rower, and when Richards became league president in 1967, he aggressively expanded the league\u2019s activities calendar to keep members\u2019 attention from straying too much to the suburbs. In 1972, William Thaddeus Coleman Jr. (b. 1920), who later served as secretary of transportation under President Gerald Ford, became the league\u2019s first Black member. In 1975, league president Burton Etherington (1909-2006) set aside the requirement (in place since 1893) that prospective members identify themselves as having never voted other than Republican for a state or national office. In 1982, President Perrin C. Hamilton (1921-2005) recommended admission of women members. At a stormy general meeting on January 11, 1983, to the dismay of Hamilton, 60 percent of the members present voted the measure down. The threat of legal action pushed the question back to the forefront of league attention, and at the behest of President Robert G. Wilder (1915-2002), the league membership reversed itself on May 19-20, 1986, paving the way for Mary G.H. Roebling (1905-1994) to become the league\u2019s first woman member. The league\u2019s first woman president, Joan Carter (b. 1943), was elected in 2011.\n\nThese changes set the stage in the 1990s for the most dramatic recruitment campaign the league had sustained. While many historic urban clubs of the Northeast, unable to offer activities that would attract clientele to a downtown location, closed their doors between 1990 and 2010, the league aggressively marketed itself as a downtown event and hotel location. It transformed its overnight accommodations into the Inn at the Union League, revamped its dining facilities, established a Heritage Center to house its archives and mount exhibits, and acquired its own parking garage. The league\u2019s Youth Work Foundation, which began as an initiative of league president Millard D. Brown (1882-1957) in 1946 to promote \u201cgood citizenship\u201d among Philadelphia\u2019s youth, was by 2016 partnering with fifty-two Philadelphia organizations to recognize more than 250 high-schoolers at an annual \u201cGood Citizen Day\u201d at the league. In 2012, the Platinum Clubs of America ranked the league as the country\u2019s number-one city club. The league\u2019s prosperity is a marker of how a private institution can play a public role in the life of the city, and serve simultaneously a social and a civic goal without subtracting from either.\n\nAllen C.

Lincoln, in fact, was the first gold medal recipient.\n\nTickets to the dinner honoring the Florida politician cost $160 per person and reportedly sold out quickly, with reservations limited to a member and one guest.\n\nIt\u2019s DeSantis\u2019s own presumed presidential ambitions \u2014 and his current race \u2014 that have some members perturbed. At least five members are thought to have expressed their dismay to the league board, and one is thought to have resigned from the club over the issue.\n\n\u201cDeSantis is running for governor and he has an opponent, and they\u2019re essentially endorsing his candidacy by giving him an award without polling the rest of the members of the Union League,\u201d Thomas McGill, a Union League member, told The Philadelphia Tribune.\n\nBeyond that, DeSantis has courted controversy in recent weeks, most notably after organizing for Venezuelan migrants to be flown to Martha\u2019s Vineyard, ostensibly to demonstrate that highly liberal areas aren\u2019t sincere in their support. After staying at a church for two nights, the newcomers were ferried to a military base in Cape Cod, and are expected to leave the base by the end of October.\n\nOn a local tip, DeSantis has been a vocal backer of Pa. gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano, who has vowed to make Pennsylvania the \u201cFlorida of the North.\u201d\n\nDistaste with an award recipient hasn\u2019t surfaced like this recently, even when the Union League has honored other nationally known conservatives with similar political views.\n\nJeff Sessions, former President Donald Trump\u2019s first attorney general, received the League\u2019s Lincoln Award in 2018, joining past honorees that include Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito \u2014 all figures who match or surpass DeSantis in their fervor across a gamut of issues, from immigration to anti-LGBTQ policy.\n\nThe group\u2019s members are known to be conservative, and have been for a long time now. What is the Union League, anyway? Here\u2019s a rundown.\n\nInside cover to the program for a Lincoln birthday dinner held at the Union League in 1894 Credit: Wikimedia Commons / NYPL\n\nAn abridged history of war and bounty\n\nIn December 1862, a local forerunner called the Union Club officially became the Union League, part of a wider network of leagues founded in the early 1860s to support Lincoln and the Union effort in the Civil War.\n\nPhilly\u2019s was the first urban group of its kind, but the first union league overall was founded a few months earlier by abolitionists in Pekin, Illinois.\n\nOriginally, there was a $25 entrance fee, roughly equivalent to $700 today. That was also the price of annual membership. One hundred men signed on as original members, and shortly thereafter began meeting at the original headquarters at 1118 Chestnut St. Their motto was (and still is) \u201cAmor Patriae Ducit,\u201d or \u201cLove of Country Leads.\u201d\n\nYearly dues (and various other donations) went towards the Union effort in many ways, including:\n\nRecruiting nine infantry regiments and one cavalry regiment through the bounty system\n\nPrinting millions of pamphlets spreading news and propaganda for the Union cause\n\nSupporting loyalist political candidates, like Pennsylvania Gov. Andrew Curtin\n\nAfter the war, the League essentially became a club for deep-pocketed Republicans navigating the Reconstruction Era. It has remained a meeting ground for monied Philadelphians \u2014 especially lawyers and politicos. The membership is considered influential, as it holds the lifeblood of political campaigns: enough liquidity to make significant financial contributions, infused with a smattering of upper crust clout.\n\nFamed Gilded Age architect Horace Trumbauer was a Union League member. In 1905 he won a design competition, and was selected to create substantial additions to the building at 140 S. Broad. The renovations, a masterclass in Beaux-Arts architecture, extended the structure to take up a whole block. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\n\nThe league\u2019s Republican bent continued into the 20th century, and survived the midcentury realignment of the two major U.S. political parties. Richard Nixon, as vice president, was a guest of honor in 1954, and George G.W. Bush received the Union League gold medal in 1987 when he was second in command. His son, former President George W. Bush, as well as Dubya\u2019s Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, are also past recipients.\n\nDrawing of the Union League in the 1891 British publication \u2019King\u2019s Hand-book of the United States\u2019 Credit: Wikimedia Commons / British Library\n\nA bastion of traditionalism that still forbids jeans\n\nOrganized as a 501(c)(7) nonprofit, Philly\u2019s Union League is one of the few remaining from the original 1860s cohort, with peers still kicking in New York and Chicago.\n\nLike many old money institutions in the U.S., it\u2019s experiencing some change, while also holding on to aspects of its past.\n\nThat there\u2019s even a kerfuffle over honoring DeSantis illustrates that the club has recently become more inclusive politically \u2014 as well as in some other ways.\n\nThe institution had been a bastion of white Protestant traditionalism, not welcoming its first Black member until 1972 or letting women become members until the mid-1980s. In recent decades, gender and racial diversity have improved, though hard numbers aren\u2019t publicly available.\n\nA conservative dress code has loosened across some of the organization\u2019s facilities, but at the League House on South Broad, jeans are still strictly forbidden.\n\nHere\u2019s how one becomes a member:\n\nFirst, know someone in the League who can serve as your primary \u201cProposer\u201d\n\nAttend a reception for potential members\n\nRequest and complete a proposal \u2014 what it asks or entails is not public record\n\nFind six sponsors, all willing to write letters of recommendation for you, and add them to your proposal\n\nImpress in your interview\n\nPay your dues \u2014 Dues vary based on age and other factors, but the initiation fee is $7,500 and annual dues are $6,227 for standard membership\n\nToday the club notes that there are over 4,000 members, a higher point for a group that was around 2,000 members or less for much of its history.\n\nBenefits include access to five other Union League facilities in the region, including golf courses in Torresdale and South Jersey; members-only events; and reciprocal entry to more than 170 private clubs of a similar pedigree around the world.\n\nThese days, the South Broad clubhouse is also known for its in-house cuisine, prepared primarily by executive chef Martin Hamann, with guest chefs working specific dinners.\n\nIn addition to continuing to support the military, the league has become a philanthropic and historical institution. Since the 1940s, it has fiscally supported students through various scholarships. It formed the Abraham Lincoln Foundation, providing public education on Philadelphia\u2019s contribution to the Civil War and the conflict itself over the years. In 2019, the three foundations that did this work coalesced into The Union League Legacy Foundation, which forwards their initiatives through one body.\n\nThe League House on South Broad can also be rented for events, which organizations like the Philadelphia Police Foundation regularly do for fundraising galas."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/16/us/about-philadelphia-admit-women-a-gentlemen-s-club-resists.html", "page_content": "On Monday the league will decide whether to bow to that pressure, the second time in three years it has considered the question. In January 1983, league members turned down the change by a vote of 609 to 430. This time it is given a much better chance of passing.\n\nUnlike 1983, the league now has a legislative and economic gun to its head, said Robert Wilder, the group's president, who opposed the idea then, but now supports it. Squeezed between declining membership and rising costs, he said the club had the choice of either ''marching with honor into the 20th century'' or ''being dragged screaming and kicking.''\n\nIn the club's halls, that choice has sparked as polarizing a debate as any issue in its 124-year history. Many of the 1,934 members have raised reverence for tradition into an ecumenical religion.\n\nThey have banded together as the Union League Preservation Committee and have denounced proponents' ''appeasement'' of the Council. In a letter to the club's membership, they said that any failure to fight the Council would open the league to public scrutiny, ''And that, gentlemen, will be the end of the league as we know it,'' they said in the letter.\n\n''The male bastion is hampered by the frivolities of women,'' said Jack Ferguson, a longtime member who is the owner of a suburban advertising company. ''Women aren't interested in being members, they're just interested in asserting their right. They're just interested in proving they're tough.''"}, {"url": "https://popularbio.com/george-hubbard-clapp/", "page_content": "Updated On April 30, 2023\n\nGeorge Hubbard Clapp estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.

That spirit of inclusion and equal opportunity remains part of the club\u2019s DNA today as it prepares to host the 2022 PGA WORKS Collegiate Championship (PWCC).\n\nFormerly known as the PGA National Minority Collegiate Championship, the 54-hole tournament set for May 2-4 will be played on courses donated by the Union League \u2013 Union League Liberty Hill and the Union League Golf Club of Torresdale. In its 35th year, the annual Championship is open to all minority-serving institutions with a focus on Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\n\n\u201cThis is a big thing for us,\u201d said Sean Palmer, the Director of Golf at Union League. \u201cThe PGA of America is trying to take this event from what it used to be and elevate it into something bigger and better. We love a challenge like that.\u201d\n\nConsidered the No. 1 City Club in the country, the Union League opened in 1862 and comprises 4,000 of the most philanthropic people in the Philadelphia area. Union League officials and the Philadelphia PGA Section discussed the infrastructure needed to hold what has been called the most diverse and culturally significant tournament in golf.\n\n\u201cThey needed two golf courses and banquet facilities,\u201d Palmer said. \"That fits very well for what we can offer. In the last couple of years since George Floyd, a lot of organizations have put statements out there and really didn't take much action. We thought this is a great opportunity to take action and actually do something.\"\n\nThe tournament will be played on two Union League courses \u2013 Liberty Hill, a Gary Player design, and Torresdale. Each offers a distinctly different test.\n\n\"There's not a lot of courses like [Liberty Hill] in the Philadelphia area with this much real estate,\" Palmer said. \"It\u2019s a big modern golf course with large fairways, large bunkers and large greens.

Union League members also helped identify participants who could benefit from the event.\n\n\u201cWe want to help make sure the event is as impactful as possible,\u201d Palmer said.\n\nThe Union League is also waiving food and beverage expenses and its membership has raised $1.4 million to support PGA WORKS and HBCU golf programs. The club and the Philadelphia PGA are also coordinating Youth Day, where kids from area First Tee programs and other youth golf organizations will interact with PGA Professionals and get exposed to the latest golf equipment and technology.\n\nThe Union League\u2019s support is welcomed by PGA Member Scooter Clark, who played in the inaugural PGA National Minority Collegiate Championship and has been the tournament director since 2018.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve carried out this mission through the lens of inclusion and community engagement,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThey\u2019re a very inclusive club that wanted to celebrate their 160th anniversary by hosting this championship.

Pennsylvania was the first state to pass any antislavery legislation, doing so all the way back in 1780, nearly a decade before Americans would even adopt the United States Constitution. Partly due to these facts, Philadelphia was also home to one of the largest free African American communities in the country. But just because there was disdain for the institution of slavery in Philadelphia, that did not lead to overwhelming support of Abraham Lincoln in the 1860 Presidential Election. Nearly half of Philadelphians voted for some combination of Southern Democrat John C. Breckinridge, Northern Democrat Stephen A. Douglas and Constitutional Union nominee John Bell, with Lincoln winning Philadelphia by only a few thousand votes.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1860 election however, as the United States descended into Civil War, some Philadelphians made an effort to erase the political divisions within the city and unite Philadelphia behind the Union war effort. In 1862, a group of Pro-Union Philadelphians founded the Union League of Philadelphia . The only condition for joining the Union League was \u201cunqualified loyalty to the government of the United States, and unwavering support of its efforts for the suppression of the Rebellion.\u201d\n\nThe Union League published hundreds of thousands of informational pamphlets in its efforts to educate citizens throughout the North and bring them to back to support the Union cause. The Union League also encouraged members to refuse to conduct business or associate with anyone who was not loyal to the United States government. The Union League encouraged free African Americans in the city to join the cause, starting a black military school to train officers and sponsoring five regiments that fought in the Civil War.\n\nThe Union League of Philadelphia became such an important institution that it would be visited by none other than Abraham Lincoln himself. Throughout the Civil War, the Union League did not have a grand hall to call their own however, they simply rented space in a mansion on Chestnut street. It was not until after the Civil War that the Union League began to build their grand Second Empire Styled Home on Broad Street that it still houses the Union League in to this day. Because even though the Civil War had ended, the Union League still felt it had plenty of work to do. In the years following the Civil War, the Union League of Philadelphia would fight for a radical reconstruction of the American South that included civil rights for African Americans, and at home in Philadelhia, the Union League successfully worked to desegregate Philadelphia\u2019s street cars.\n\nWhat to See\n\nWhile the Union League of Philadelphia is today more of a civic institution than a major political power broker, it is still a private club. Many parts of the building are only accessible to Union Club members. Luckily, one of the most impressive parts of the Union League Building is the grand exterior architecture that can be seen by anyone walking by their home on Broad Street. The ornate stone work and stately mansard roof helps make the Union League one of the most impressive buildings gracing the Avenue of the Arts.\n\nThere is however one way for non Union Club members to get to many parts of this historic gem and that is to become a guest in the Union League\u2019s hotel! The Inn at the League is a well appointed hotel that is centrally located in Center City Philadelphia. It also allows guests to access many rooms that would otherwise only be accessible by Union Club members. Keep in mind though, even if you are not a member, you still need to heed the Union League\u2019s dress code if you stay at the hotel. There is an entrance that allows you to enter and exit the building without enforcing the dress code, but otherwise if you explore outside of your hotel room, you will need to be dressed appropriately in business attire.\n\nAdditionally, once a year, on a date that closely coincides to Abraham Lincoln\u2019s February 12th Birthday, the Union League of Philadelphia celebrates Lincoln Day and hosts an open house! On this day, the Union League is open to the public for free, regardless of whether or you have a membership. There are even free tours given on Lincoln Day, giving visitors a unique opportunity to learn about the history of this unique organization and the ornate architectural masterpiece it is housed in.\n\nInsider Info\n\nThe Union League is hardly the only Civil War monument or memorial that you can find in Philadelphia. In Fairmount Park, the grand gateway to West Fairmount Park is the \u201cSmith Memorial Arch\u201d which was built for the 1876 Centennial Exhibit as a Memorial of all of the Civil War heroes hailed from Philadelphia.\n\nSpeaking of Prominent Civil War figures from Philadelphia, you can find statues of two of them prominently in front of Philadelphia\u2019s City Hall. The statues are of two Union Generals, both seated upon their horses. One statue is of Philadelphian George McClellan who briefly served as the Union General in Chief. The other is of John Fulton Reynolds, a Philadelphian who was originally born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Reynolds was a respected Union General who died in action on the first day of the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\nHow to Get There\n\nThe Union League of Philadelphia is centrally located just a couple of blocks south of Philadelphia\u2019s City Hall. For guests of The Constitutional Walking Tour , the walk to the Union League is a fairly easy one. Starting from the National Constitution Center , where all of our tours begin and end, just head south on 6th Street to Chestnut Street. Turn right and head east down Chestnut until you reach Broad Street. The Union League will be to your left on the next block at Sansom Street.\n\nThe Union League is also directly next to the Walnut Locust Station of the Broad Street Line (subway) and easily reached by car as numerous parking garages can be found in the surrounding blocks.\n\nAdditional Information\n\n140 S.

EST\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Good morning. Welcome to my hanging. (Laughter and applause.) Thank you for coming and thank you for your warm welcome.\n\nFirst, I'd like to compliment Mark Carder. He did a really fine job with a challenging subject. (Laughter.) I was taken aback by how much gray paint you had to use. (Laughter.) It speaks more about my job than yours. (Laughter.) But thanks a lot, it's been a joy to work with you and I'm confident this portrait will stand the test of time.\n\nI want to thank Fred and Frank for welcoming me here. I thank you for the medal. I'm keeping pretty good company, which I will speak about in a minute.\n\nFirst of all I do want to thank the board of directors of The Union League for taking time out of your Saturday to be here. And I appreciate all the guests who have come, as well.\n\nI particularly want to say thanks to my friend, Arlen Specter, for joining us. (Applause.) It's been a joy working with you -- most of the time. (Laughter.) He's a pretty independent-minded fellow -- (laughter) -- who is honest and decent. (Applause.) And like me, he married very well. (Laughter.) So Joan, thanks for being here, and I appreciate -- I appreciate you supporting this good man during some very difficult times. (Applause.)\n\nI thank the Hoopers, for paying for this work. (Applause.) I thank Jim Straw and the Abraham Lincoln Foundation and the Foundation members who are here today. I appreciate you preserving the legacy of a -- of a good man.\n\nI am -- it turns out this award had been given to folks I have had the honor of serving with: Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Don Rumsfeld, Secretary Tom Ridge -- three good men who are dedicated and patriot public servants.\n\nI'm especially proud to be a co-recipient with a guy I call \"41.\" (Applause.) The 1987 Gold Medal Award Winner -- a guy I call \"dad,\" you call him \"President Bush.\" We owe our achievements to the same savvy political counselor and firm disciplinarian: Barbara. (Laughter and applause.) And they're both doing well, by the way. (Applause.) Mother is coming out of the hospital. I hope they don't put this on TV, but she's a tough old bird -- (laughter) -- whose spirits are soaring high.\n\nThe motto of The Union League is \"Love of Country Leads.\" You obviously love our country because you continue to lead in ways that make Philadelphia a more compassionate place, and I want to thank you for that. I appreciate the fact that you have mentoring programs and internships and scholarships. That basically says the dream is for all who live in this country. I thank you for your efforts to preserve historical treasures. One can learn a lot from the past, and The Union League is doing its part to tell the true story of our great nation.\n\nIn short, I thank you for your service to your community and our country.\n\nI also thank you for preserving the legacy of Abraham Lincoln. I'm about to be a member of the Ex-President's Club, so I'll just call him \"Abe.\" (Laughter.) If he were around I could say, you call me \"W.\" (Laughter.) I don't know if you know this or not, but there's a place in the Oval Office where the President puts the most influential President -- portrait of, I guess you'd say \"influential President.\" I'm somewhat conflicted about the \"influential President,\" so I say, 41's portrait hangs in my heart, 16 hangs on the wall. (Applause.)\n\nI found it interesting that the League was founded in 1862, to support President Lincoln in a time when his leadership was deeply controversial. (Laughter.) I know how he felt. (Laughter.)\n\nBut the principles on which he stood have stood the test of time: All men are created equal under God, he said, unflinchingly throughout his presidency. (Applause.) Liberty is given to every man, woman and child on the face of the earth. I believe, like Lincoln, there is an Almighty - (applause) - and a gift of that Almighty to every man is freedom. He has taught Presidents that you must act on your principles and make tough decisions, regardless of the political consequences. (Applause.)\n\nI have been a - I have drawn strength from his example. I have learned lessons by reading about Abraham Lincoln. And I want to thank you for preserving his legacy. (Applause.)\n\nAnd most importantly, I thank you for your kind words and your heartfelt prayers during the last eight years. It has been -- somebody said, what's it's like to be President? I said, some days you're happy, some days not so happy -- every day joyous to serve the United States.\n\nGod bless you, and God bless our country. (Applause.)\n\nEND 10:46 A.M.
