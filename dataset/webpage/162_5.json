McClendon also served as the interim head football coach at the University of Georgia for the final game of the 2015 season, the TaxSlayer Bowl.\n\nEarly life and playing career\n\nMcClendon played high school football at Benjamin E. Mays High School in Atlanta, Georgia. He played wide receiver at the University of Georgia and graduated in 2005. He was part of a senior class that won 44 games, which was the most in Georgia history until the national championship-winning Class of 2022. As a senior in 2005, McClendon caught the game-winning touchdown pass from DJ Shockley with 3:18 left in Georgia's 14\u20137 win over Georgia Tech. After college, he spent one summer with the Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL).\n\nCoaching career\n\nGeorgia\n\nMcClendon began his career at Georgia as a graduate assistant and was promoted to running backs coach when Tony Ball was moved to wide receivers coach. From 2009 to 2013 he served as the running backs coach for Georgia, but was reassigned to wide receivers coach in 2015 after Thomas Brown was hired from the Wisconsin Badgers. From 2013 to 2015 McClendon served as the recruiting coordinator for Georgia. On January 12, 2015, he was promoted and given the title of assistant head coach.

McClendon was initially set to be the co-offensive coordinator for the Miami Hurricanes before Georgia offered him a position on its coaching staff. He replaced Cortez Hankton, who left Georgia for the same position at LSU. This is McClendon's second coaching stint with the Bulldogs, as he served under former Georgia head coach Mark Richt from 2007-2015.\n\nPersonal life\n\nMcClendon is married to the former Amber Arnold of Atlanta.

All six of those scores, including the game winner against Georgia Tech, came during his senior season. From there it was the NFL, playing one season for the Chicago Bears before returning back to Athens to coach under Mark Richt.\n\nMcClendon was a graduate assistant during the 2007 and 2008 seasons until he was promoted into the role of running backs coach in 2009.

Salary details for McClendon have not yet been made available by the university. The Mays High School (Atlanta, Ga.) product joins the Bulldog staff after an extremely short stint (less than four weeks) at Miami where he held the co-offensive coordinator and wide receivers coach titles.\n\nMcClendon was the receivers coach at Oregon in 2020 and 2021. He was also the Ducks' interim head coach when Mario Cristobol left to take the Miami job. He was at South Carolina for the four seasons prior to that where he was hired by Will Muschamp, a current assistant coach on Georgia's defensive staff. McClendon held the co-offensive coordinator title at South Carolina in 2016 and 2017. He then became the offensive coordinator and play caller in 2018 and 2019 before being relieved of his duties.\n\nDuring his time with the Gamecocks McClendon helped develop current NFL wideouts Deebo Samuel and Bryan Edwards.

Edwards stayed for the 2019 season and had over 800 yards receiving in that season, too.\n\nHis coaching career began at UGA in 2007 as a graduate assistant. He spent two seasons in that role before being promoted by Mark Richt to the on-field staff in 2009 as running backs coach. McClendon coached running backs from 2009 to 2014 and grew into one of the nation's top recruiters.\n\nMcClendon had a huge hand in Georgia winning out in the hotly tested recruitments of prospects like Isaiah Crowell, Isaiah Wynn, Keith Marshall, Todd Gurley, Sony Michel, and Nick Chubb among others. He was moved to coach wide receivers in 2015 to make room for Thomas Brown to join the coaching staff, but he spent just one season in that role before Richt was fired and most of the staff was let go. McClendon stayed on with the Bulldogs for the 2015 TaxSlayer Bowl and helped lead the team to a victory over Penn State.\n\nMcClendon is the son of UGA running back great Willie McClendon and joined the UGA football team as a player in 2002. He spent four years with the program and was a part of two SEC Championship teams in 2002 and 2005. Smart was the running backs coach on that 2005 team while McClendon was the team's second-leading receiver behind Leonard Pope. After his time at UGA as a player, McClendon was picked up by the Chicago Bears but didn't make it to the 2006 season with the team before he was let go."}, {"url": "https://ugawire.usatoday.com/2022/01/30/georgia-football-brings-back-wr-coach-bryan-mcclendon-uga/", "page_content": "Multiple reports have confirmed Georgia has hired Bryan McClendon as receivers coach replacing Cortez Hankton, who left for the same position at LSU.\n\nMcClendon is a Mays High School (Atlanta) graduate who played receiver for the Bulldogs from 2002 to 2005 before transitioning to a graduate assistant coach.\n\nMcClendon coached running backs and receivers in his first stint at Georgia under head coach Mark Richt and later served as interim head coach in the 2015 TaxSlayer Bowl after Richt\u2019s departure.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s Kirby Smart brings McClendon back to Athens just four weeks after McClendon was named co-offensive coordinator and receivers coach at Miami under new coach Mario Cristobal, who brought McClendon with him to Miami from Oregon where he served in the same capacity.\n\nBefore his stint in Eugene, McClendon coached three seasons at South Carolina where he served as co-offensive coordinator and receivers coach and eventually was named offensive coordinator in 2019.\n\nMcClendon brings recruiting prowess and experience to the Georgia receiver room, which is looking to replace some serious talent.\n\nStar George Pickens is headed to the NFL draft and Jermaine Burton is headed to Tuscaloosa via the transfer portal, along with two other receiver reserves in Justin Robinson and Jaylen Johnson."}]}
