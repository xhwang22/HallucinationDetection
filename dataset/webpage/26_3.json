{"Thomas Harriot was an important figure in the scientific revolution of the 17th century.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Harriot", "page_content": "Thomas Harriot, also spelled Hariot, (born 1560, Oxford, Eng.\u2014died July 2, 1621, London), mathematician, astronomer, and investigator of the natural world.\n\nLittle is known of him before he received his bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of Oxford in 1580. Throughout his working life, he was supported by the patronage, at different times, of Sir Walter Raleigh and Henry Percy, the 9th earl of Northumberland; he was never, after his student years, affiliated with an academic institution or commercial organization. From 1585 to 1586 he participated in Raleigh\u2019s colony on Roanoke Island, and he may have visited Virginia as early as 1584; upon his return, he published A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia (1588). This was his only work published during his lifetime. Very soon after the Virginia sojourn, Harriot was living on and surveying Raleigh\u2019s estates in Ireland.\n\nBritannica Quiz Astronomy and Space Quiz\n\nIn 1595 Percy settled upon Harriot an estate in Durham, England, and soon provided him with a house near London, which he also used as a scientific laboratory to pursue original research in astronomy, meteorology, optics, and what are now characterized as pure and applied mathematics. In particular, he performed experiments in ballistics and the refraction of light. He was one of the first, if not the first, to consider the imaginary roots of equations. Much of his earliest as well as latest mathematical work bore on questions of navigation, including such issues as the construction of rhumb lines (or loxodromes) on sailing charts. He also devised a novel form of cross-staff, an early navigational instrument. (See navigation: latitude measurements.) Although, after his early voyages, he pursued a life of research, it was not a life free of turmoil, since his principal patron, Raleigh, was imprisoned in 1603 in the Tower of London on orders of King James I of England. Harriot witnessed Raleigh\u2019s execution in 1618. In the turmoil following the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605, Harriot was arrested upon suspicion of having cast the king\u2019s horoscope, though he was soon released. (Percy, as a co-conspirator in the plot, joined Raleigh in the Tower of London.) From the early 1590s, Harriot had developed a reputation for atheism and was referred to rather obliquely as a conjurer by Raleigh\u2019s enemies. However, there is nothing in Harriot\u2019s writings or those of his friends to substantiate any non-Christian beliefs; the accusations may merely reflect his likely belief in atomism, which at the time was considered by some to obviate the necessity for the existence of God.\n\nConcurrently with Galileo Galilei\u2019s introduction of telescopic observations of the heavens in 1609, Harriot commenced telescopic observations, some systematic, others not. He drew charts of the Moon, followed the paths of the moons of Jupiter, and observed sunspots. He also observed comets.\n\nDuring his lifetime Harriot was known in England among the philosophically inclined, and his reputation extended to the continent to the extent that the astronomer Johannes Kepler initiated a correspondence with him. His only other book, however, was the posthumously published Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas Resolvendas (1631; \u201cApplication of Analytical Art to Solving Algebraic Equations\u201d). (The editor of this work introduced the signs \u2219 for multiplication, > for greater than, and < for less than.) Although Harriot published little and kept some of his studies secret, such as the discovery of the sine law of refraction (now known as Snell\u2019s law), his work was not done in isolation; he drew around himself a group of admiring scholars, at least some of whom were cognizant of some of his discoveries. In subsequent centuries Harriot was never forgotten, but it has been mainly since the mid-20th century that scholars have made close and systematic studies of his thousands of pages of manuscripts and uncovered the full extent of his investigations."}, {"url": "https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Harriot/", "page_content": "20\n\n1577\n\n1560\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1580\n\n1583\n\n1587\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1584\n\n1585\n\n86\n\n9\n\n1585\n\n19\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1586\n\n1586\n\n1588\n\n1589\n\n1590\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1590\n\n1595\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1597\n\n1597\n\n1601\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1621\n\n20\n\n1637\n\n1590\n\n1590\n\n1607\n\n1600\n\n1599\n\n1600\n\n24\n\n1603\n\n(\n\n)\n\n4\n\n1605\n\n27\n\n1621\n\n1605\n\n1605\n\n1606\n\n(\n\n)\n\n17\n\n1607\n\n(\n\n)\n\n26\n\n1609\n\n9\n\n5\n\n6\n\n17\n\n1610\n\n10\n\n20\n\n1611\n\n32\n\n17\n\n1610\n\n26\n\n1612\n\n199\n\n8\n\n1610\n\n18\n\n1613\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1614\n\n1618\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1618\n\n1603\n\n29\n\n1618\n\n1613\n\n1615\n\n(\n\n)\n\n12\n\n1591\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1998\n\n(\n\n)\n\n4\n\n(\n\n)\n\na , b , c a, b, c a , b , c\n\n( x \u2212 a ) ( x \u2212 b ) ( x \u2212 c ) = 0 (x - a)(x - b)(x - c) = 0 ( x \u2212 a ) ( x \u2212 b ) ( x \u2212 c ) = 0\n\n(1631)\n\n10\n\nwas a mathematician and astronomer who founded the English school of algebra. He is described inby Fauvel and Goulding as:-yet his name has only recently become widely known, and even now his achievements are not fully appreciated by most mathematicians.We know very little of Harriot's youth. In fact all that is known is that on FridayDecemberhe matriculated at the University of Oxford with an entry in the official records giving his age as seventeen, his father as a plebeian, and his birthplace Oxfordshire. It is from this record that his date of birth is deduced to beand we know that his father was a \"commoner\" but the very fact that Harriot was entering Oxford means that it is unlikely that he came from the poorest classes. Despite extensive searches of the Oxfordshire records, no further information concerning his birth or parentage has been foundalthough a number of possible relatives have been identifiedAs an undergraduate at Oxford, Harriot was a student at St Mary's Hall. He became friends with Richard Hakluyt and Thomas Allen, both lecturers at the university, but not at St Mary's Hall. Harriot graduated inand went to London. It is not clear exactly what he did in his first few years there but, probably from late, he entered Sir Walter Raleigh's service. Hakluyt, dedicating a preface to Raleigh in February, wrotesee for example:-Harriot wrote a text called Arcticon which was never published and unfortunately no copies have ever been found. This work was essentially his lecture course given at Durham House, Raleigh's lodgings in The Strand in London, where Harriot lived at this time. The lectures were given to the seamen who were being gathered by Raleigh to participate in his expeditions to the New World. Pepper describes the advances in navigational techniques made by Harriot by the time he wrote Arcticon:-As Roche notes in:-It was not only as a navigational instructor that Raleigh employed Harriot. He was involved with the design of the ships for Raleigh's expeditions as well as being involved in the construction of the vessels and selecting the seamen. He was Raleigh's accountant, being responsible for obtaining funding for the expeditions and keeping all the accounts.Raleigh had the captains Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe make an expedition to Roanoke Island off the coast of North Carolina in. Although there is no direct evidence that Harriot made this voyage, Quinn inargues convincingly that he was one of those making this preliminary survey. Harriot was certainly on a voyage to Virginia organised by Raleigh in. He sailed from Plymouth onAprilon board the Tiger and his observations of a solar eclipse onApril have allowed modern scientists to compute the exact position of the ship on that day. Harriot made many notes during his time in the New World, being particularly interested in the language and customsparticularly the eating habitsof the inhabitants. The object of the voyage was to colonise the New World but it was not successful in this aim.Drake was engaged in sea battles with the Spanish when he learnt that they intended to prevent the British colonists becoming established. Although Drake met up with the colonists, in Junethere were severe storms and there was a hurried return to England by Harriot and most of the party. Harriot, together with Drake's ships, landed at Portsmouth in Julyand he went immediately to Raleigh to report on the expedition. He published A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia in, a book in which he recommends the smoking of tobacco which he himself had learnt to do in Virginia. However, he also wrote a full account of the voyage which, for some reason, he never published and, despite strenuous attempts to find a copy, seems lost.By the time Harriot had returned, Raleigh had turned his attention to Ireland. Harriot carried out surveys of the Lismore estate, which was owned by Raleigh, beginning in. Nine years later he was still involved in working out the acreage of plots being leased on the estate. However the political situation was about to change and this would have dramatic implications for Harriot.Already in thes there were allegations against Raleigh of atheism. The charges were against Raleigh's school and \"the conjurer that is master thereof\". Harriot felt that this was a reference to him and he discussed the allegations with John Dee who also felt that the charges might relate to him. There is no reason to believe that Harriotor Raleighwere atheists but certainly they were free thinkers and Harriot's scientific approach to the world was, to say the least, viewed with great suspicion by the church. As well as problems caused by allegations, Dee and Harriot discussed scientific and mathematical matters in thes.Harriot had now moved from working for Raleigh to working for Henry Percy, Duke of Northumberland. The Duke had around him a circle of friends who were scholars, many of whom held a atomistic views. Raleigh's life became so chaotic that Harriot had sought the support of a patron who could provide more stability for his scientific pursuits. Inthe Duke made property in Durham over to Harriot and he moved up the social ladder becoming a member of the \"landed gentry\". Harriot also later held estates in Cornwall and Norfolk. Not long after the Durham transaction, the Duke gave Harriot the use of one of the houses on the estate at Syonnear Kew outside Londonwhich Harriot used both as a residence and as a scientific laboratory.We certainly know from manuscripts which survive that Harriot was engaged in deep studies of optics at Syon by. Although init states that he had discovered the sine law of refraction of light before, in fact we now know that the precise date of Harriot's important discovery was July. As with all his other mathematical discoveries, however, Harriot did not publish his findings. It is somewhat ironical, however, that Snell to whom the discovery of this law is now attributedwas not the first to publish the result. Snell 's discovery was in, aboutyears after Harriot's discovery, but the result was not published until Descartes put it in print inOne of the optical problems which Harriot did study in thes was Alhazen 's problem. He gave a solution to Alhazen 's problem which involved considering an equivalent problem, namely the problem of the maximum intercept formed between a circle and a diameter of a chord rotating about a point on a circle. The author ofconjectures that Harriot may have used infinitesimal techniques in demonstrating the equivalence of these problems, and certainly we know that Harriot introduced ideas later rediscovered by Barrow Optics was not the only topic to occupy Harriot during this period. He had been asked by Raleigh in the earlys to apply his mathematical skills to the science of gunnery. At this time ideas of the trajectory taken by a projectile were still dominated by Aristotle 's thinking. Harriot resolved the forces acting on the projectile into horizontal and vertical components. He understood that air resistance acted throughout the whole flight, and that gravity acted on the vertical component. He came very close to a vector analysis solution of the problem of finding the velocity of the projectile and, certainly by, he came to the conclusion that the path of the projectile was a tilted parabola . He made one error, however,:-Other topics which Harriot began to work on beforewere problems of chemistry. He worked intensively on chemistry for almost exactly a year from Mayto Mayand, although his experiments were conducted with a new scientific precision, he made no discoveries of particular note.Raleigh had been a particular favourite of Elizabeth I and, when she died onMarch, it was clear that Raleigh's fortunes would change. Perhaps it is less clear that Harriot, by this time not so closely associated with Raleigh, would find problems too. James I became king and he quickly saw Raleigh as someone opposed to his claims to the throne. Henry Percy, the Duke of Northumberland, had taken care to put himself on a good footing with James with a letter of support for him only days before Elizabeth died. In July plots were discovered against James and Raleigh was arrested and charged with high treason.Raleigh attempted suicide but failed. He then sought Harriot's help in obtaining evidence on his behalf. Raleigh was convicted and sentenced to death by hanging. Poor Harriot was singled out in the judgement as being an atheist and an evil influence. His attempts to help Raleigh had been based on Christian principlesto which undoubtedly he adheredbut this had rather damaged Raleigh as Harriot was seen an atheist using Christian principles for convenience. Harriot was devastated and for about a year undertook no new scientific work as he tried to come to terms with what was happening. Raleigh received a last-minute reprieve from the death sentence but was imprisoned in the Tower of London.Another plot was to lead to further trouble. OnNovemberGuy Fawkes and others were arrested for attempting to blow up the Houses of Parliament. Four others, including Thomas Percy, the grandson of Henry Percy, were also arrested as the main conspirators. Harriot was held on suspicion of being involved and imprisoned in the Gatehouse. He was interrogated on the charge that he had cast a horoscope of King James in an attempt to use magical powers to influence the King's future. OnNovember Henry Percy, Harriot's patron, was also put in the Tower where he remained untilwhen he was released. No evidence seems to have been found against Harriot and, although he remained in the Gatehouse for some while writing several letters requesting his release, he was a free man probably by the end ofAs soon as he was released, Harriot returned to his work on optics. He now considered more complex systems and employed Christopher Tooke as a lens grinder from early. His work on light now moved to the dispersion of light into colours. He began to develop a theory for the rainbow and, by Kepler had heard of the remarkable results on optics achieved by Harriot. Kepler wrote to Harriot, but the correspondence never really achieved any significant exchange of ideas. Perhaps Harriot was too wary of the difficulties that his work had nearly brought on him, or perhaps he didas he claimed to Kepler ) still intend to publish his results if his health permitted. still intend to publish his results if his health permitted.\n\n\n\nThe appearance of a comet attracted Harriot's attention and turned his scientific mind towards astronomy. He observed a comet on The appearance of a comet attracted Harriot's attention and turned his scientific mind towards astronomy. He observed a comet on 17 September September 1607 from Ilfracombe which would later be identified as from Ilfracombe which would later be identified as Halley's Comet. 's Comet. Kepler had discovered the comet six days earlier but it would be the observations of Harriot and his friend had discovered the comet six days earlier but it would be the observations of Harriot and his friend ( and student and student ) William Lower which eventually were used by William Lower which eventually were used by Bessel to compute its orbit. to compute its orbit.\n\n\n\nHis astronomy brought back to the fore, Harriot went on to make the earliest telescopic observations in England. On His astronomy brought back to the fore, Harriot went on to make the earliest telescopic observations in England. On 26 July July 1609 at at 9 p.m. he sketched the Moon which was at that time p.m. he sketched the Moon which was at that time 5 days old, viewing it through a telescope with a magnification of days old, viewing it through a telescope with a magnification of 6 .

I saw but one and that alone\n\nhe must have already been aware of\n\n's discovery. As with all his scientific discoveries, Harriot did not publish his results. These observations of Jupiter's moons were made between\n\n17\n\nOctober\n\n1610\n\nand\n\n26\n\nFebruary\n\n1612\n\n.\n\nHe was the first to discover sunspots, making\n\n199\n\nobservations between\n\n8\n\nDecember\n\n1610\n\nand\n\n18\n\nJanuary\n\n1613\n\n. The first observation of sunspots was made while he was observing Jupiter's moons. From the data he collected he was able to deduce the period of the Sun's rotation. However, around this time his scientific work basically came to an end. He seems to have had his spirits brought low by the deaths of his friends and lost the spirit to continue research\n\n(\n\nwhich had brought him much trouble despite his lack of publications\n\n)\n\n.\n\nOf the few pieces of work done by Harriot after\n\n1614\n\n, one was his observation of another comet in\n\n1618\n\n(\n\nthere were three visible comets that year and Harriot observed the third\n\n)\n\nfrom Syon House. In\n\n1618\n\nRaleigh, who had been shown the clemency of imprisonment in\n\n1603\n\nrather than death, was put to death. Raleigh was executed on\n\n29\n\nOctober\n\n1618\n\nin a public execution, with Harriot present to witness the event. However, by this time Harriot was already suffering from the cancer of the nose which eventually led to his death.\n\nThe cancer seems to have started around\n\n1613\n\n, about the time when Harriot lost interest in pushing forward his mathematical and scientific research. He consulted the top specialist in\n\n1615\n\nwho wrote report on the consultation. He described Harriot as\n\n(\n\nsee for example\n\n)\n\n:-\n\n... a man somewhat melancholy. ... A cancerous ulcer in the left nostril eats up the septum of his nose and in proportion to its size holds the lips hard and turned upwards. It has gradually crept well into the nose. This evil the patient has suffered the last two years.\n\nHarriot would suffer this \"evil\" for a further three years before the cancer took his life.\n\nThere are a few other major mathematical achievements due to Harriot which we should mention. He exhibited the logarithmic spiral as the\n\nof a\n\non a sphere, a projection he proved to be\n\n. The loxodromes are the straight lines on the\n\nmap, which Harriot computed with great precision. In fact in order to achieve this degree of precision, Harriot introduced finite-difference interpolation.\n\nThere is an interesting history to a problem which has only recently been solved, yet originated with Harriot. Raleigh asked Harriot to solve certain problems regarding the stacking of cannonballs. On a manuscript dated\n\n12\n\nDecember\n\n1591\n\n(\n\nSunday\n\n)\n\n, Harriot set out a table to answer Raleigh's questions. He shows how, if the number of cannonballs is given, one can compute the number of cannonballs to be placed in the base of a pyramid with a triangular, square or oblong base. Raleigh posed a second question, which Harriot also answered, namely given the pyramid of cannonballs, compute the number in the pile.\n\nHarriot was too much the mathematician to stop there, however. From a study of how the cannonballs could fill space, he considered the implications for the\n\nof matter which he believed in. Later, in his correspondence with\n\nabout atomic theory, Harriot mentioned the packing problem.\n\ncould not solve the problem but he believed that the densest packing of spheres would be attained if in each layer the centres of the spheres were above the centres of the holes in the layer below. This seems intuitively obvious, but resisted proof until\n\n1998\n\nwhen Thomas Hales of the University of Michigan\n\n(\n\nwith the help of hours of computer generated data\n\n)\n\nfinally proved the conjecture.\n\nThe one part of Harriot's work which we have not yet described is the mathematical work for which, in some ways, he is best known, namely his work on algebra. He introduced a simplified notation for algebra and his fundamental research on the theory of equations was far ahead of its time. As an example of his abilities to solve equations, even when the roots are negative or imaginary, we reproduce his solution of an equation of degree\n\n4\n\n. The example in question is in his own handwriting and reproduced in\n\n.\n\naaaa - 6aa + 136a = 1155 ------------------------------------ aaaa -2aa + 1 = 4aa -136a + 1156 aa - 1 = 2a - 34 33 = 2a - aa aa - 2a = -33 aa - 2a + 1 = +1 - 33 a - 1 = \u221a-32 1 - a = \u221a-32 a = 1 + \u221a-32 a = 1 - \u221a-32 ------------------------------------ aa - 1 = 34 - 2a aa + 2a = 35 aa + 2a + 1 = 1 + 35 a + 1 = \u221a36 a = \u221a36 - 1 = 5 ------------------------------------ -a - 1 = \u221a36 a = -\u221a36 - 1 = -7\n\n.\n\nHarriot invented certain symbols which are used today. However, the symbols < for \"less than\" and > for \"greater than\" were not due to Harriot\n\n(\n\nas is often claimed\n\n)\n\n, but were introduced by the editor of Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas Resolvendas\n\n\u24c9 ( The analytical art by which algebraic equations can be resolved )\n\n- Harriot himself used different symbols. There is still scholarly debate on how much Harriot was influenced by\n\n, or whether notation and ideas introduced by\n\nwere learnt by him from Harriot.\n\nAs we have seen from the example above, Harriot did outstanding work on the solution of equations, recognising negative roots and complex roots in a way that makes his solutions look like a present day solution. He made the observation that if\n\na , b , c a, b, c a , b , c\n\nare the roots of a\n\nthen the cubic is\n\n( x \u2212 a ) ( x \u2212 b ) ( x \u2212 c ) = 0 (x - a)(x - b)(x - c) = 0 ( x \u2212 a ) ( x \u2212 b ) ( x \u2212 c ) = 0\n\n. This is a major step forward in understanding which Harriot then carried forward to equations of higher degree.\n\nAlthough he was far ahead of his time, his work had far less influence than it should have done since, as we have remarked repeatedly above, he published no mathematical work in his lifetime. Even his work on algebra Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas Resolvendas\n\n(1631)\n\nwas published\n\n10\n\nyears after his death and was edited by people who did not fully appreciate the depth of his work. For example, it does not discuss negative solutions.\n\nReferences (show)\n\nJ A Lohne, Biography in Dictionary of Scientific Biography ( New York 1970 - 1990) .\n\nSee THIS LINK.

He left behind some 8,000 pages of scientific research, but it is only in recent decades that scholars have uncovered their treasures.\n\nAnd what they show is that Harriot independently made many significant discoveries now attributed to other, more famous scientists. Some scholars have called him \u201cthe English Galileo\u201d and \u201cthe greatest British mathematical scientist before Newton\u201d.\n\nYet Harriot died without publishing a single word of this extraordinary output. His tale reminds us that, while we may sometimes think science progresses through a series of famous pioneers who single-handedly overturn entrenched beliefs, the story is rarely so simple.\n\nWhat did Harriot discover?\n\nFor instance, we learn in school that Galileo Galilei initiated telescopic astronomy and discovered the law of falling motion. But Harriot independently did both of these things.\n\nHe also deduced fledgling general laws governing the motion of everyday objects, again independently of Galileo, and before Ren\u00e9 Descartes. (Half a century later, Isaac Newton developed the definitive laws of motion.)\n\nHarriot studied light, too, discovering the secret of colour and the nature of the rainbow before Newton, and finding the law of refraction (which we know today as Snell\u2019s law) before the Dutch astronomer Willebrord Snell.\n\nHe also made a mathematical study of population growth before Thomas Malthus, developed a completely symbolic form of sophisticated algebra before Descartes, discovered binary arithmetic before Gottfried Leibniz, and took steps on the road to calculus with his work on infinite series.\n\nThe law of falling bodies\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 2008 that Harriot\u2019s work on gravity was fully reconstructed, by the German scholar Matthias Schemmel.\n\nAs Schemmel pointed out, Harriot and his contemporary Galileo were heirs to essentially the same body of knowledge. It\u2019s perhaps not so surprising, then, that they made some of the same breakthroughs. There are plenty of examples of independent co-discoveries in history, most famously that of calculus by Newton and Leibniz.\n\nThe law of falling motion says that without air resistance all objects, no matter their size or mass, fall from the same height at the same rate.\n\nLegend has it Galileo dropped balls from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to study how they fell. Nobody knows if this is true, but Harriot had the same idea: he recorded the time, in pulse beats, that it took for different objects falling from as high as 55\u00bd feet (about 17 metres) to reach the ground.\n\nRead more: Copernicus' revolution and Galileo's vision: our changing view of the universe in pictures\n\nBoth Harriot and Galileo devised more accurate experiments, however, from which they derived a mathematical understanding of how things fall.\n\nThis combination of experiment and mathematics is now the accepted way to derive a law of nature. Quantifying observations means others can test the results, and use them to make useful predictions.\n\nHarriot and Galileo were not the first to understand the role of observation and mathematics in this context, of course. But they were among the most successful of the pre-Newtonian pioneers.\n\nGalileo didn\u2019t publish his work on gravity until after Harriot had died, and there\u2019s no evidence that the two men ever met or corresponded.\n\nThe law of refraction and the shape of the rainbow\n\nThe German astronomer Johannes Kepler, however, did correspond briefly with Harriot. Kepler had been working on the nature of light and vision when word reached him that Harriot had unravelled two mysteries: the law of refraction, and why the rainbow has its magical colours and its unique shape.\n\nThe law of refraction describes how light bends when it passes from one medium into another, which explains how an image can be focused by a glass lens or why your leg looks wobbly when you dip it in a swimming pool.\n\nHarriot derived this law 20 years before Snell, but there\u2019s a popular belief that the 10th-century Baghdad-based scholar Ab\u016b Sa\u02bfd al-\u02bfAl\u0101\u02be ibn Sahl beat even Harriot. This is not quite right: Ibn Sahl is a notable pioneer whose geometrical diagram of light focussed by a lens gives, in hindsight, the correct refractive path. But there\u2019s no evidence he deduced his result from experiment, or that he understood the general properties of refraction.\n\nJudging from his surviving papers even Snell failed to generalise his result, which he, like Ibn Sahl, never wrote as the neat trigonometric equation we use today. Harriot, by contrast, did: his derivation of the general law of refraction is another example of his rigorous blend of experiment and mathematics.\n\nRead more: Curious Kids: Why are rainbows round?\n\nHarriot\u2019s other adventures\n\nIf only Harriot had published! In the early stage of his career, though, he was bound by commercial secrecy, for his first patron was the controversial statesman and entrepreneur Sir Walter Raleigh. Harriot was also busy dodging heretic hunters and sailing the high seas as Raleigh\u2019s navigational advisor.\n\nRaleigh had delusions of empire and glory, and wanted to establish a trading colony in today\u2019s USA before the Spanish beat him to it. The one work Harriot did publish in his lifetime was \u201ca brief and true report\u201d on the economic potential of Raleigh\u2019s chosen American site.\n\nHarriot\u2019s contribution to colonialism has justly attracted its share of criticism. Nonetheless, his report is still widely praised for its sympathetic depiction of the way of life of the North Carolina Algonquian people, as it was when Europeans first set foot on their land. Harriot learned the local language, and enjoyed much about the year he spent living with the Algonquians.\n\nWhat he loved doing most, though, was mathematics and physics. He was neither flamboyant nor ambitious, and when he was wrongfully imprisoned through an unlucky connection with the Gunpowder Plot (a failed attempt to assassinate King James I), he told his jailers he just wanted\n\nto live a private life for the love of learning that I might study freely.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the late 1590s Harriot had found a second patron, Henry Percy, the ninth earl of Northumberland. It was then that he was able to study the mysteries of nature and the marvels of mathematics for their own sakes, rather than the \u201capplied\u201d work he had done for Raleigh.\n\nHaving two generous patrons meant Harriot did not need to publicise his discoveries to attract funding, the way Galileo did. Nor did he care about fame, despite being urged by friends to claim his priority. His manuscripts do contain several almost finished treatises, but it seems he was so busy doing science that he never managed to put his results together for the printer.\n\nAfter his death, well-meaning scholars carved up his manuscripts in an attempt to study and publish them. In the process, however, all the papers disappeared, seemingly lost forever. Then, 150 years later, the Hungarian astronomer Franz Xaver Zach discovered them, locked safely away in Northumberland\u2019s castle.\n\nMost of the papers were then given to the British Museum. They are now in the British Library, where I had the privilege of studying them. (They\u2019re also available online.)\n\nAs for Harriot, no-one knows much about him as a person \u2013 not even his birthday. Nevertheless, he has fascinated scholars for the past half century (as I discovered some years ago when I set out to bring his story to a wider, non-specialist readership).\n\nThat\u2019s because despite the lack of biographical data, those precious manuscripts show that what mattered most to Harriot himself was mathematics and science. Four hundred years on, his mix of genius and dedication is something to honour."}, {"url": "https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/hariot-thomas-ca-1560-1621/", "page_content": "Oxford and Durham House Hariot enters the historical record with his matriculation at Oxford in 1577 at the age of seventeen. His tentative date of birth is based on this information. Notes written at the time indicate that he was raised in Oxfordshire and his father was a commoner. Nothing else for certain is known about his early life. Hariot arrived at Oxford with exceptional talents in mathematics and the sciences, but at a time when these subjects were not particularly valued. This was beginning to change, however, as English adventurers began to recognize the connection between mathematics and the navigational arts necessary to further the nation\u2019s developing interests in colonization, piracy, privateering, and trade, especially in North America. At Oxford, Hariot met Richard Hakluyt (the younger), who went on to edit the influential Principall Navigations of the English Nation (1589), a polemic on behalf of future English colonization disguised as a history of past English successes. Hariot also probably knew Thomas Allen, an Oxford faculty member who collected the latest manuscripts, books, and instruments connected with mathematics and astronomy. After receiving a BA from Oxford in 1580, Hariot relocated to London, where his interest in applying mathematics and astronomy to questions of navigation brought him to the attention of Walter Raleigh. A favorite of Queen Elizabeth I, Raleigh had obtained permission to establish English colonies in North America. By 1583, Hariot was serving Raleigh at his London residence, Durham House, by focusing on open-sea navigation. The Portuguese and Spanish understood how to cross the Atlantic Ocean to the New World, but the English, with notable exceptions such as Sir Francis Drake, did not and were forced to hug the coasts. Before he could teach it, Hariot needed to master the subject himself, and he set about collecting, building, and learning to use standard navigational instruments, including the astrolabe, cross staff, and sextant. He studied the mathematics required to determine one\u2019s position in the open ocean, collected the best sea charts and maps, and learned the basics of astronomy necessary to navigate by the stars, moon, and sun. He then began lecturing to Raleigh\u2019s sea captains on these subjects in his room at Durham House and collected the knowledge in the now-lost Arcticon. Raleigh was planning to attempt a colony on the mid-Atlantic coast of North America and in 1584 sent a reconnaissance voyage that landed on Roanoke Island. There, commanders Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe met and returned to England with two Virginia Indians, Manteo and Wanchese. Recognizing that communication with the Indians would be crucial for a successful colony, Hariot worked with the two men and learned to speak their form of the Algonquian language. Hariot even developed his own phonetic alphabet, which allowed him to record the sounds of Algonquian words and to create a now-lost English-Algonquian dictionary. Hariot\u2019s work in this area made him one of the most advanced linguists of the day and recommended him as a member of Raleigh\u2019s Roanoke expedition in 1585.\n\nRoanoke and A briefe and true report A briefe and true report of the new found land of Virginia The Roanoke colonists were mostly military men, the most prominent exceptions being Hariot and the artist John White, who had served as expedition artist on one of Martin Frobisher\u2019s voyages to Greenland. The colonists arrived at Roanoke late in June 1585, but one of their ships ran aground and they lost much of their provisions. After the departure in August of the colony\u2019s two commanders, Sir Richard Grenville and Thomas Cavendish, Ralph Lane assumed governorship, and his relations with the local Indians were friendly at first. The situation deteriorated, however, as the Englishmen failed to find reliable sources of food, and when Sir Francis Drake arrived in June 1586, Lane decided to return the surviving colonists to England. The year had not been a waste for Hariot, though. With the help of Manteo and Wanchese, and in the company of John White, he had explored the area surrounding Roanoke and, with White, joined a party that sailed north to the Chesapeake Bay and up the Elizabeth and Nansemond rivers, even encountering the Chesapeake Indians at their principal town of Skicoac. He and White used these travels to collaborate on the first accurate maps of the east coast of North America. Using angle-measuring tools to establish latitude and longitude, Hariot mapped out triangle-shaped areas and either recorded these angles in a notebook for later use or, while in the field, sketched these triangles directly onto a sheet of paper attached to a plane table. White, an accomplished painter and illustrator, then finished the maps. While some of the White-Hariot maps remained in manuscript form and did not receive wide circulation, others\u2014such as the small map of Roanoke Island and the large map of the entire Outer Banks region\u2014appeared in Theodor de Bry\u2019s illustrated edition of Hariot\u2019s A briefe and true report of the new found land of Virginia, becoming models for their time of accurate cartography in the New World. A briefe and true report was, perhaps, Hariot\u2019s most important contribution to England\u2019s colonization efforts. First published in 1588, it appeared again the next year as part of Richard Hakluyt (the younger\u2019s) Principall Navigations. Hakluyt then convinced de Bry to publish a third version as the initial volume in his America series. This last includes etchings of the White-Hariot maps as well as etchings based on White\u2019s watercolor portraits of Virginia Indians and scenes of Indian life. Published in English, French, German, and Latin, the de Bry version enjoyed a wide European audience. While the Report is sometimes considered scientific, it is more accurately viewed as commercial discourse. Throughout, Hariot argues four related points. First, the 1585 colony failed because many members of the colony were unprepared for the rigors of colonization. Although these men slandered the colony and its leaders upon arriving home, in Hariot\u2019s view Raleigh\u2019s colonization program should be allowed to continue. Second, the Roanokes and other Indian tribes are not to be feared by the English, who possess superior technology and culture. Third, the land in Virginia is abundant enough to provide future colonists with adequate food and building materials. And fourth, Virginia offers a less expensive source for a wide range of trade goods, including shipping supplies, dyes for the cloth industry, and wine.\n\nLater Years In 1595, Hariot received land from Henry Percy, ninth earl of Northumberland, to allow him to continue his scientific and mathematical work. Percy was imprisoned in 1605 for his connection to the Gunpowder Plot, an attempt on the life of King James I on behalf of greater freedom for English Catholics. Hariot\u2019s connection to Percy also landed him in prison, but only briefly. (Percy\u2019s younger brother George was one of the original Jamestown colonists.) Sir Walter Raleigh also ran afoul of the king and was beheaded in 1618. In the meantime, Hariot pursued his interest in astronomy. His unpublished notes on the appearance of Halley\u2019s Comet in 1607 were later used to accurately calculate its orbit. In 1609, he used a telescope of his own making to sketch the moon\u2014four months before the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei more famously accomplished the same feat. In 1610, he was the first to observe sunspots, and in 1611, he produced the first map of the moon. Hariot died in London on July 2, 1621, of cancer of the nose, probably caused by heavy tobacco use. A posthumous work, Artis Analyticae Praxis, published in 1631, helped to establish the English school of algebra."}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00283-019-09904-9", "page_content": "Thomas Harriot (1560-1621). Who was he? From somewhere deep in our granular memories of historical figures we recall that he might have been a scientist, or a mathematician, or perhaps a philosopher. It turns out he was all three and more. Add astronomer, navigational researcher, cartographer, linguist, and explorer to his CV and you have a strikingly notable figure. Add mapping the moon\u2019s surface, telescopic studies of sunspots, calculating the periods of revolution of Jupiter\u2019s moons, and discovering the laws of free fall to his lifetime achievements, and you have a picture of a major biography. He corresponded with Johannes Kepler, discovered Snell\u2019s law before Willebrord Snellius (Snell) did, and discovered properties of the prism and the nature of the rainbow long before Newton was born. So why do we know so little about him?\n\nHarriot never published his work, except for one 48-page booklet, A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia.Footnote 1 He worked on a large number of manuscripts that were never published. Publishing was just not his thing. Rather, he followed his intellectual passions wherever they led, with a humble indifference to deserved credit. Perhaps that is why his contributions to mathematics, physics, and astronomy were so forgotten, until now with Robyn Arianrhod\u2019s publication of Thomas Harriot: A Life in Science. On April 9, 1585, a three-masted sailing ship named the Tiger left the safety of Plymouth on the southwest coast of England and headed for the open ocean.\n\nRight there, from that first sentence, and on through the next 265 pages, the extraordinary portrait of Thomas Harriot expands like the vast unexplored sea between England and Roanoke Island to take us on a journey through an adventurous life of geographic and scientific exploration.\n\nWhen Harriot was just a boy, English explorers were searching the northernmost parts of North America for quick routes from England to the riches of silks and spices of Asia. Then, in 1580, Francis Drake circumnavigated the globe, plundering some Spanish treasure ships en route. But North America was still just a watering hole and trading stop, and so Sir Walter Raleigh planned other quests. He sent a fleet of seven ships under the command of his cousin Sir Richard Grenville to America, expecting to establish a base, form a colony, and found an English settlement. Only four ships made it to that long, thin series of islands we now call the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Harriot, at the age of twenty-five, along with 160 passengers and crew, was on the overcrowded Tiger. He was often up on deck acting as navigational consultant, taking astronomical readings, and experimenting with ways to improve his instruments for navigating. When he was not required for these activities, he used the time to observe the ship itself, recording the technical terms for its various parts, noting details of ropes and rigging, mulling over the ideal ratio between a ship\u2019s dimensions and the height of its masts, and generally taking note of the day-to-day work of the crew.\n\nNavigating across vast expanses of ocean was often a trial-and-error enterprise confounded by unexpected winds and storms. In 1569, the Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator created a conformal map projection of the world that later became the standard for nautical navigation. The map locally preserved angles with the meridians while distorting the sizes of objects as latitudes increased from the equator toward the poles. Mercator was not the first to project the curved world onto a plane. Fourteen centuries earlier, the Greco-Roman mathematician astronomer Ptolemy had done something similar, but not with a world that circled the entire spherical globe. The so-called Mercator projection was a cylindrical projection: wrap the globe in a cylinder meeting at the equator, and from that globe\u2019s center, project the points of the surface of the globe onto the wrapped cylinder. Then uncurl the cylinder. Once it is lying flat, you have a Mercator map of the globe. That idea solved a significant problem. If a ship kept its bearing as if it were to sail straight according to a compass, let\u2019s say making an angle \u03b1 northeast with respect to the lines of longitude, the ship would actually follow a spiral path on its course toward the North Pole without ever getting there. To help sailors adjust navigation, Mercator created a corrective chart that represented the spiral path as the straight line it intuitively seemed to be, using straight lines on the flat map to represent longitudes that are not evenly spaced; rather, they increase in spacing as one moves northward. It seemed a strange spacing to be used for navigational purposes, a spacing that, it appeared, no one other than Mercator understood mathematically, until Harriot figured it out using clever tools of trigonometry to provide the first full mathematical solution. Later, he was the first to mathematically find the length of the spiral curve itself, which is today called a loxodrome, or rhumb line. It was the first ever calculation of the exact length of a curve.\n\nAlmost nothing is known about Harriot\u2019s early life. Even the exact date of his birth is not recorded where it should be. Records show that he was a commoner, so he must have been quite intelligent as a young lad to be admitted to Oxford at seventeen years of age and attain a degree in 1580. Yet Thomas Harriot is a biography of an enigmatic character whose mind was filled with both intellectual and geographical adventure when he arrived in London with an Oxford bachelor of arts degree and little else\u2026 and soon attracted a wealthy patron: the tall and dashing Walter Raleigh. Thanks to Robyn Arianrhod and her careful research, we now have a brilliant picture of the man brought to life through his accomplishments, from the moment he sailed to the Outer Banks and spent time on Roanoke Island creating a thirty-six-letter phonetic alphabet to record the native Algonquian language.\n\nThe one part of Harriot\u2019s mathematical work for which he is best known is his work on algebra, in which he did fundamental research on the theory of equations and solutions of equations having negative or imaginary roots. For this he concocted new symbols, and used them to their full advantage. Arianrhod tells us: He was arguably the best algebraist of the early seventeenth century, in the decades between Vi\u00e8te\u2019s death in 1603 and the rise of Descartes in the late 1630s.\n\nHarriot was living at a time when mathematical symbols were beginning to find their way into conventional mathematics. He was just twelve years old when Rafael Bombelli\u2019s 1572 L\u2019Algebra was published with symbols representing exponents indexed by numerals. Five years later he was admitted to Oxford. Even by that time, Simon Stevin\u2019s L\u2019Arithm\u00e9tique, with its sophisticated use of symbols, had not yet appeared.\n\nAs late as the early seventeenth century, mathematics writing in Europe was still essentially rhetorical, although in some countries, certain frequently used words had already been abbreviated. Later, those abbreviated words became further abbreviated, and by the 1630s, through the writings of Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te, Simon Stevin, and eventually Harriot and Descartes, the abbreviations became so compacted that all the once-apparent connections to their origins became lost forever.\n\nToday we have the symbolic expression x2 \u2212 2x + 1, which draws the mind from the special circumstance to the general form ax2 + bx + c, so we can conceive of x2 \u2212 2x + 1 as merely a representative of the species. In Harriot\u2019s time, some writers would still write what we know to be (x + a)2 = x2 + 2ax + a2 as The square of the sum of the unknown quantity and a number equals the sum of the squares of the unknown and the number, augmented by twice the product of the unknown and the number.\n\nBut symbolic notation had already taken form in the writing of powers of a variable as repeated letters, so that, for instance, an would be written as a juxtaposition of n copies of the letter a. Just imagine what the mind had to transcend in order to process natural language with all its ambiguities while manipulating words in order to convince oneself of how true the equation is! As late as 1591, Vi\u00e8te would have written the polynomial x2 \u2212 3x + 9 as A quad \u2212 3 in A+9 plano. Harriot would have written that same polynomial as xx \u2212 3x + 9. Like Vi\u00e8te, Harriot manipulated algebraic equations without the use of power indexing, which came only later. Until that point in time, mathematicians were interested in the zeros of polynomials\u2014that is, in the numbers that would make the polynomial equal to zero.\n\nHarriot had the ingenious idea of first setting the polynomial equal to zero, thereby setting up an equation, a polynomial equation, and asking for the numbers that satisfy the equation, something we now do naturally. It was not just a grammatical difference. It opened a door to a whole new way of thinking about polynomials. Harriot saw that a polynomial could be built up from a product of its factors, just as a compound number could. For example, because x4 \u2212 4x3 \u2212 19x2 + 106x \u2212 120 = 0 factors into linear polynomials as (x \u2212 2)(x \u2212 3)(x \u2212 4)(x + 5), the polynomial can equal zero only for the values of x that make one of the factors equal to zero, namely 2, 3, 4, and \u20135.\n\nIt was a game-changer\u2014the problem of finding zeros of polynomials quickly became the problem of factoring polynomials. It was a slight grammatical maneuvering that advanced the possibility that every polynomial equation has a root, possibly a real number or a complex number. Proving this fact generally with satisfactory rigor was beyond seventeenth-century means.\n\nSuch a general proof would have to wait almost two hundred years, when it would take on the general form that we now know as the fundamental theorem of algebra. Setting polynomials to zero gave mathematicians a sense of proper algebraic form. By putting all terms to the left side of an equation and leaving an isolated zero on the right, the form comes to the forefront, that is, the equation x2 + 3x + 2 = 0 falls into a category recognizably distinct from, say, 3x + 2 = 0, and the equation 5x3 + 2x2 + 3x + 2 = 0 falls into a third category. Algebra was not just about equations, but also about forms.\n\nAlgebra was just one of Harriot\u2019s many interests and talents. On the pages of Thomas Harriot you get a mathematician with a probing mind who sees the world as his laboratory. When coming to refraction, for example, Harriot looked at the printed works of others and found errors. So he took his own measurements one day, then the next, then the next days for ten days. He would repeat his measurements for months and years before accepting them as true gauges of nature that were somewhat independent of atmospheric and geological variables. He was aware of the possibility of hidden variables and waited to have enough repetitions to be satisfied that his data were sufficiently accurate.\n\nHe immersed a staff in water and marked off the positions of the images as they appeared when viewed through the water. He was surely not the first to perform such an experiment; curious Babylonians must have done the same. Arianrhod\u2019s book reads smoothly through the more technical arguments, so that the reader feels that everything is visual and easy. We might not know exactly how Harriot got his refraction data, but Arianrhod tells us that we can perform the experiment at home. \u201cYou can get the idea by immersing a straw in a flat-bottomed glass of water,\u201d she tells us before giving the details of how to collect the data. \u201cHarriot marked off these points carefully, and repeated the process as he changed the angle of the staff.\u201d She illustrates this with a diagram (Figure A). Figure A The path of a light ray passing from air to water. (Redrawn from Figure 16b of the book under review, adapted from Harriot\u2019s manuscript BL Add MS 6789 f406r. Courtesy of Robyn Arianrhod.) Full size image\n\nIn the figure, the light ray is traveling from air to water (a denser medium) contained in the rectangle bcd. Harriot is tracing the ray from the water to the air (from d to a) when i < r. The immersed segment of the staff appears bent upward (segment bf) compared with the actual immersed portion of the staff (bd). The line abf is the line of sight to the refracted image as the ray passes from water to air (and to the observer\u2019s eye). Harriot measured bd, cd, and bf. Since sin r = bc/bf and tan i = bc/cd, one can find i and r from trigonometric tables.\n\nHarriot had access to such tables. The first trig table was compiled as far back as the second century b.c.e. by Hipparchus of Nicaea and extended by Ptolemy in the second century c.e. It was done by tabulating the corresponding values of the arcs and chords of a series of angles. Al-Khwarizmi also produced tables of sines, cosines, and tangents in the ninth century, and new versions by Vi\u00e8te and Clavius were published in the 1580s, so Harriot was well aware that he could convert all of his markings into trigonometric quantities. Without measuring any angles directly, he was able to make a table of angles of incidence and refraction from his linear measurements. He knew that sin r = bc/bf and tan i = bc/dc, and from this he deduced the sine law of refraction. He also showed that each pair of refractive media has a particular ratio of sines, or as we say today, every medium has a characteristic index of refraction.\n\nThroughout every mathematical and scientific explanation, Arianrhod keeps us well informed and interested, as if she were talking directly to us. She says: you will notice by experimenting with a straw, it takes a skilled and patient experimenter to take reasonably accurate measurements giving one pair of angles, let alone for the large number needed to uncover the law of refraction. That is likely why few, if any, of Harriot\u2019s peers had studied refraction in this meticulous way. She is inviting us to perform the simple experiment ourselves. What a wonderful experiment this is for middle-school math students to learn Snell\u2019s law as n 1 sin i = n 2 sin r, where n 1 and n 2 are the respective indices of refraction.\n\nWe now know the law from the Fermat principle, which tells us that light travels on whatever path takes the least time. By that principle, it is relatively easy to see the beautiful formula that ties refraction angle i to incidence angle r. However, Harriot did not know of Fermat\u2019s principle, since Pierre de Fermat had not yet been born when Harriot was performing his light experiments in 1597. So he had to approach the problem another way. Arianrhod tells us that many scientists before Harriot carried out similar experiments and came upon inaccurate or invalid results. Ptolemy somehow believed, incorrectly, that the angle of refraction has a direct, essentially proportional, relationship with the angle of incidence. This is approximately true for small angles, but hardly true, even approximately, in general. And back in the thirteenth century, Roger Bacon wrote a treatise on refraction through lenses. But those experiments were, for the most part, understood to be thought experiments, not \u201crigorous, repeated practical ones.\u201d\n\nThe beauty of this biography is that it gives us the whole person on balance, with almost equal attention to extensively varied exploits. The first third of the book is adventurous, with an expedition to Virginia and lively glimpses into Harriot\u2019s teachings of astronomy and navigation in the era of European exploration of the Americas. Then we come to his infatuations with algebra and rainbows, and his correspondence in Latin with Johannes Kepler on elliptical planetary motion, the atomic theory of matter, and the different ways in which cannonballs could be stacked to fill space. In 1591, Harriot worked out a formula giving the number of spheres that could be stacked on a given area and height, a formula that had become useful in models of atomic packing. He mentioned the packing problem to Kepler, pointing out that the most stable way to stack cannonballs on ships was also the densest packing of spheres, accomplished by placing each layer so that the centers of the spheres were above the centers of the holes in the layer below. That was an intuitive conjecture, but Kepler could not prove it. Five years after his correspondence with Harriot, he wrote an essay, The Six-Cornered Snowflake, on why snowflakes always have sixfold symmetry, which includes Harriot\u2019s principle of the best way to stack cannonballs on ships.Footnote 2 For the next 410 years it was known as Kepler\u2019s conjecture. It even found its way into a part of Hilbert\u2019s eighteenth problem. In 1998, Thomas Callister Hales, of the University of Michigan, provided evidence of its validity by a computer analysis of all possible individual cases, and a formal proof was accepted in 2017.Footnote 3\n\nBesides delicately describing Harriot\u2019s treatments of polynomials, refractions, notational innovations, and sphere packing, Arianrhod deftly communicates to us Harriot\u2019s interests in language, analytic geometry, binomial coefficients, the binomial theorem, projectile motion, spherical triangles, solar rotation, the orbit of Halley\u2019s comet, the shape of a rainbow, compound interest, quantitative analysis of population growth, sunspots, and moon mapping. Woven through all this math and science is a dynamic history, including the tale of Harriot\u2019s brief imprisonment for his coincidental connection with Guy Fawkes and Thomas Percy, coconspirators of the Gunpowder Plot to assassinate King James I, and a discussion of the work of many renowned scientists, mathematicians, and thinkers of the time.\n\nI learned much from the many enjoyable hours I spent reading this captivating book.

A telescopic device appears to have been constructed by the noted English polymath Leonard Digges (1515\u2013c. 1559) as early as the first half of the 1500s and later reiterated by his son, Thomas Digges, in a communication dated to 1571:\n\n[H]is divine mind aided with this science of Geometrical mensurations, found out the quantities, distances, courses, and strange intricate miraculous motions of these resplendent heavenly Globes of Sun, Moon , Planets and Stares fixed, leaving the rules and precepts thereof to his posterity. Archimedes also (as some suppose) with a glass framed by revolution of a section Parabolicall, fired the Roman navy in the sea coming to the siege of Syracuse. But to leave these celestial causes and things done of antiquity long ago, my father by his continual painful [painstaking] practices, assisted with demonstrations Mathematical, was able, and sundry times hath by proportional Glasses duly situate in convenient angles, not only discovered things far off, read letters, numbered pieces of money with the very coin and superscription thereof, cast by some of his friends of purpose upon downs in open fields, but also seven miles off declared what hath been done at that instant in private places.\n\nThis intriguing tract, which appears on page 5 of the preface to his posthumously published book Pantometria (1571), provides the modern reader with an intriguing glimpse of a telescopic device made with lenses and mirrors. In a lively debate that took place in March 1993 organized by the Scientific Instrument Society (SIS) and held at Burlington House, London, Colin Ronan spoke in favor of the existence of such an early telescope, while the late Professor Gerard Turner, based at the Museum for the History of Science, Oxford, UK, provided a robust counterpoint. During the debate, a replica of the alleged Digges telescope was presented to all in attendance.\n\nThe device consisted of a simple biconvex objective lens, the light of which was incident to a focusing mirror that relayed the image to the eye. Mounted inside a wooden tube, the device magnified 11 times and did produce an enlarged image, but with a very narrow field of view, and was additionally plagued by chromatic aberration \u2013 a consequence of using a singlet lens as an objective. There is, as yet, no consensus on whether such a telescope ever saw the light of day.\n\nHarriot and his assistant, Christopher Tooke, set up a telescope magnifying 6 times on the grounds of Syon Park, and on the clement evening of July 26, 1609, turned it on a five-day-old crescent Moon, immediately sketching what he saw. Various lunar \u2018seas\u2019 are included in these lunar portraits, including the Mare Crisium, Tranquilitatis and Fecunditatis, as well as some rugged lunar features situated along the terminator, which modern scholars have identified as Theophilus and Cyrillus. Curiously, this first sketch does not record any craters, although 6\u00d7 is certainly large enough to resolve several of the more prominent ones.\n\nOut of sheer curiosity, in a separate investigation, this author used a modern spyglass with an uncoated, 1-inch diameter object glass, also having a magnification of 6\u00d7, in the wee small hours (01:30 h UT) of January 1, 2016, to record observations of the last quarter Moon and Jupiter, as they cleared the treetops in the eastern sky. Like Harriot\u2019s telescope, the spyglass gave an erect, correctly orientated image but enjoyed a much larger field of view (approximately 4 angular degrees). Nonetheless, this author could confirm that many lunar craters can indeed be observed with a steady hand, as well as clearly showing various maria . Turning to Jupiter, then just a few degrees above the Moon, the telescope could clearly reveal four Galilean satellites all to one side of the planet (Fig. 1.3).\n\nFig. 1.3 The author\u2019s 6\u00d7 achromatic spyglass used to corroborate Harriot\u2019s observations. (Image by the author) Full size image\n\nIt will come as somewhat of a surprise to the contemporary reader not acquainted with a Galilean telescope that, despite its very low magnifying power, its field of view was very restrictive \u2013 typically just over half the diameter of the full Moon! As a result, Harriot could not have seen the entire countenance of the lunar crescent even at the low magnifications his telescopes delivered. Incredibly, though, Harriot made many more drawings of the Moon, some of which display finer cartographic details than Galileo\u2019s later drawings, but they were frustratingly left undated. When we take into account the radically different personalities of both Galileo (explored in the next chapter) and Harriot, we can see that both men had entirely different modi operandi. Harriot, having spent time in Virginia, was a draughtsman and well acquainted with mapmaking. His methods were slow and methodical. Harriot was categorically not seeking fame and fortune in the same way that Galileo was, and, according to Dr. Chapman , because Harriot had two high profile friends on \u2018death row\u2019 in the Tower, he had little desire to make himself conspicuous.\n\nBy the closing weeks of 1609, Harriot dispatched Tooke, his able technician, to the residence of Sir William Lower at Trefenti, Carmarthenshire, South Wales, instructing him to fashion several other Galilean cylinders in order that he and his philosophical chums, a one Mr. Vaughan and Mr. Protheroe (and possibly a few others), could begin their own telescopic investigations of the Moon and other celestial bodies. The surviving exchanges between Harrriot and the \u2018Carmartenshire philosophers,\u2019 clearly unveil their avowed acceptance of the Copernican system, as well as Kepler\u2019s elliptical theory of planetary orbits. This meeting may well be first known record of an astronomical society, the members of which were to confirm Galileo\u2019s monumental telescopic work by observing the large Jovian satellites and the erstwhile \u201cinvisible\u201d stars in the Pleiades.\n\nOver the next few years, Harriot was to complete his now famous Moon maps, as well as embarking on a detailed study of the Sun. His method involved observing the intensely bright solar disk, when it was near the horizon and veiled behind mist and thin cloud (the reader should, under no circumstances, attempt such an observation!). Harriot is credited as the co-discover of sunspots, recording them at or about the same time as Galileo, and possibly earlier than Christopher Scheiner (1573\u20131650) and Johannes Fabricius (1587\u20131616), who themselves yielded additional evidence against the time-honored cosmology of Ptolemy (Fig. 1.4).\n\nFig. 1.4 Christoph Scheiner (1573\u20131650), the Jesuit priest and astronomer, with his telescope shown on his left. (Image courtesy of Wiki Commons. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoph_Scheiner#/media/File:Scheiner_christoph.gif) Full size image\n\nOver the next 2 years, Harriot was to carry out some 450 observations of the Sun and its dark spots, never once claiming their discovery for himself, studying how they moved across its otherwise brilliant face, breaking up and sometimes even disappearing. Indeed, modern scholars were able to establish a solar rotation period of 27.154 days from Harriot\u2019s drawings \u2013 uncannily close to the modern accepted value of 27.2753 days. This affirms the accuracy and attention to detail so central to Harriot\u2019s methodology.\n\nAccording to Dr. Chapman , Tooke may have made improvements to the basic Dutch trunke, and referring to a study conducted by the distinguished historian of astronomy and cosmology, the late Professor John North (1934\u20132008) identified no less than six telescopes associated with Harriot and the \u2018Trefentine\u2019 philosophers, which ranged in power from 6\u00d7 up to 50\u00d7. Tooke is likely to be among the first bona fide telescope makers in Britain, a tradition that was to be continued over the following centuries.\n\nAlthough Harriot embraced the Christian message from his youth, even writing the Lord\u2019s Prayer in the Algonquin language , some scholars have suggested that he may have experienced a brief religious hiatus as he approached middle age. Doubtless, the revolution heralded by the application of the telescope to the celestial realm had raised new questions in the minds of his learned contemporaries. Why were the astronomical bodies puckered and imperfect? How did God create everything from nothing? Was His divine hand needed at every stage, from the formation of atoms to the completion of worlds? Was the allegory of the universe even attributed to a personal God or was it merely blind chance? These questions weighed heavily in the mind of Thomas Harriot.\n\nDr. Chapman acknowledges that nothing firm can be adduced from Harriot\u2019s surviving notes and correspondences, but he is inclined to the view that the world\u2019s first telescopic astronomer re-embraced his Christian heritage in the final decade of his life, as evidenced by his 1615 correspondence with the king\u2019s physician, Sir Theodore Mayerne, who assured Harriot of the certainty of the existence of one all-powerful God. From his days in Virginia, Harriot had taken to \u2018drinking\u2019 tobacco smoke, as his contemporaries had referred to it. Earlier physicians had hailed the new wonder drug as an effective remedy to counter the \u201cdangerous moist humors of the body.\u201d But three decades of heavy inhalation of tobacco smoke was to take its toll on Harriot\u2019s health, and he developed a cancerous lesion on his nose.\n\nBecause many tumors of this sort have a tendency to metastasize, spreading to other organs of the body via the lymph nodes, Harriot was arguably history\u2019s first clearly attested tobacco-induced cancer victim, dying on July 2, 1621. He was laid to rest at his local Parish Church of St. Christopher-le-Stocks, located in the heart of the city of London. And while the church was razed to the ground by the Great Fire of 1666 and another resurrected on the original site by none other than Sir Christopher Wren (1632\u20131723), this too was eventually demolished in 1781 in order to make way for a grand new building that would became the headquarters of the Bank of England. In the 1970s, however, the gravestone dedicated to Thomas Harriot was recovered, and, in his honor, a new plaque carrying his gravestone inscription was unveiled inside the bank.\n\nIt is difficult to crystallize the legacy of Thomas Harriot, being so far removed from him in time, but these words come to mind; learned, diligent, enterprising, kind, loyal, uncompetitive, humble and God-fearing. Despite not marrying and raising children, he lived a fulfilled life without a bad word to say about his fellow men, rendered all the more remarkable owing to his great wealth and lifelong connection with the rich and powerful."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/science/Scientific-Revolution", "page_content": "The sudden emergence of new information during the Scientific Revolution called into question religious beliefs, moral principles, and the traditional scheme of nature. It also strained old institutions and practices, necessitating new ways of communicating and disseminating information. Prominent innovations included scientific societies (which were created to discuss and validate new discoveries) and scientific papers (which were developed as tools to communicate new information comprehensibly and test the discoveries and hypotheses made by their authors).\n\nThe Enlightenment , like the Scientific Revolution, began in Europe . Taking place during the 17th and 18th centuries, this intellectual movement synthesized ideas concerning God, reason, nature, and humanity into a worldview that celebrated reason. This emphasis on reason grew out of discoveries made by prominent thinkers\u2014including the astronomy of Nicolaus Copernicus and Galileo , the philosophy of Ren\u00e9 Descartes , and the physics and cosmology of Isaac Newton \u2014many of whom preceded the Enlightenment.\n\nScientific Revolution is the name given to a period of drastic change in scientific thought that took place during the 16th and 17th centuries. It replaced the Greek view of nature that had dominated science for almost 2,000 years. The Scientific Revolution was characterized by an emphasis on abstract reasoning, quantitative thought, an understanding of how nature works, the view of nature as a machine , and the development of an experimental scientific method .\n\nThe growing flood of information that resulted from the Scientific Revolution put heavy strains upon old institutions and practices. It was no longer sufficient to publish scientific results in an expensive book that few could buy; information had to be spread widely and rapidly. Natural philosophers had to be sure of their data, and to that end they required independent and critical confirmation of their discoveries. New means were created to accomplish these ends. Scientific societies sprang up, beginning in Italy in the early years of the 17th century and culminating in the two great national scientific societies that mark the zenith of the Scientific Revolution: the Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge , created by royal charter in 1662, and the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences of Paris, formed in 1666. In these societies and others like them all over the world, natural philosophers could gather to examine, discuss, and criticize new discoveries and old theories. To provide a firm basis for these discussions, societies began to publish scientific papers. The old practice of hiding new discoveries in private jargon, obscure language, or even anagrams gradually gave way to the ideal of universal comprehensibility. New canons of reporting were devised so that experiments and discoveries could be reproduced by others. This required new precision in language and a willingness to share experimental or observational methods. The failure of others to reproduce results cast serious doubts upon the original reports. Thus were created the tools for a massive assault on nature\u2019s secrets.\n\nScientific Revolution , drastic change in scientific thought that took place during the 16th and 17th centuries. A new view of nature emerged during the Scientific Revolution, replacing the Greek view that had dominated science for almost 2,000 years. Science became an autonomous discipline , distinct from both philosophy and technology , and it came to be regarded as having utilitarian goals. By the end of this period, it may not be too much to say that science had replaced Christianity as the focal point of European civilization. Out of the ferment of the Renaissance and Reformation there arose a new view of science, bringing about the following transformations: the reeducation of common sense in favour of abstract reasoning; the substitution of a quantitative for a qualitative view of nature; the view of nature as a machine rather than as an organism; the development of an experimental, scientific method that sought definite answers to certain limited questions couched in the framework of specific theories; and the acceptance of new criteria for explanation, stressing the \u201chow\u201d rather than the \u201cwhy\u201d that had characterized the Aristotelian search for final causes.\n\nThe Scientific Revolution began in astronomy. Although there had been earlier discussions of the possibility of Earth\u2019s motion, the Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus was the first to propound a comprehensive heliocentric theory equal in scope and predictive capability to Ptolemy\u2019s geocentric system. Motivated by the desire to satisfy Plato\u2019s dictum, Copernicus was led to overthrow traditional astronomy because of its alleged violation of the principle of uniform circular motion and its lack of unity and harmony as a system of the world. Relying on virtually the same data as Ptolemy had possessed, Copernicus turned the world inside out, putting the Sun at the centre and setting Earth into motion around it. Copernicus\u2019s theory, published in 1543, possessed a qualitative simplicity that Ptolemaic astronomy appeared to lack. To achieve comparable levels of quantitative precision, however, the new system became just as complex as the old. Perhaps the most revolutionary aspect of Copernican astronomy lay in Copernicus\u2019s attitude toward the reality of his theory. In contrast to Platonic instrumentalism, Copernicus asserted that to be satisfactory astronomy must describe the real, physical system of the world.\n\nThe reception of Copernican astronomy amounted to victory by infiltration. By the time large-scale opposition to the theory had developed in the church and elsewhere, most of the best professional astronomers had found some aspect or other of the new system indispensable. Copernicus\u2019s book De revolutionibus orbium coelestium libri VI (\u201cSix Books Concerning the Revolutions of the Heavenly Orbs\u201d), published in 1543, became a standard reference for advanced problems in astronomical research, particularly for its mathematical techniques. Thus, it was widely read by mathematical astronomers, in spite of its central cosmological hypothesis, which was widely ignored. In 1551 the German astronomer Erasmus Reinhold published the Tabulae prutenicae (\u201cPrutenic Tables\u201d), computed by Copernican methods. The tables were more accurate and more up-to-date than their 13th-century predecessor and became indispensable to both astronomers and astrologers.\n\nDuring the 16th century the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, rejecting both the Ptolemaic and Copernican systems, was responsible for major changes in observation, unwittingly providing the data that ultimately decided the argument in favour of the new astronomy. Using larger, stabler, and better calibrated instruments, he observed regularly over extended periods, thereby obtaining a continuity of observations that were accurate for planets to within about one minute of arc\u2014several times better than any previous observation. Several of Tycho\u2019s observations contradicted Aristotle\u2019s system: a nova that appeared in 1572 exhibited no parallax (meaning that it lay at a very great distance) and was thus not of the sublunary sphere and therefore contrary to the Aristotelian assertion of the immutability of the heavens; similarly, a succession of comets appeared to be moving freely through a region that was supposed to be filled with solid, crystalline spheres. Tycho devised his own world system\u2014a modification of Heracleides\u2019\u2014to avoid various undesirable implications of the Ptolemaic and Copernican systems.\n\nAt the beginning of the 17th century, the German astronomer Johannes Kepler placed the Copernican hypothesis on firm astronomical footing. Converted to the new astronomy as a student and deeply motivated by a neo-Pythagorean desire for finding the mathematical principles of order and harmony according to which God had constructed the world, Kepler spent his life looking for simple mathematical relationships that described planetary motions. His painstaking search for the real order of the universe forced him finally to abandon the Platonic ideal of uniform circular motion in his search for a physical basis for the motions of the heavens.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

With these two laws, Kepler abandoned uniform circular motion of the planets on their spheres, thus raising the fundamental physical question of what holds the planets in their orbits. He attempted to provide a physical basis for the planetary motions by means of a force analogous to the magnetic force, the qualitative properties of which had been recently described in England by William Gilbert in his influential treatise, De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus et de Magno Magnete Tellure (1600; \u201cOn the Magnet, Magnetic Bodies, and the Great Magnet of the Earth\u201d). The impending marriage of astronomy and physics had been announced. In 1618 Kepler stated his third law, which was one of many laws concerned with the harmonies of the planetary motions: (3) the square of the period in which a planet orbits the Sun is proportional to the cube of its mean distance from the Sun.\n\nA powerful blow was dealt to traditional cosmology by Galileo Galilei, who early in the 17th century used the telescope, a recent invention of Dutch lens grinders, to look toward the heavens. In 1610 Galileo announced observations that contradicted many traditional cosmological assumptions. He observed that the Moon is not a smooth, polished surface, as Aristotle had claimed, but that it is jagged and mountainous. Earthshine on the Moon revealed that Earth, like the other planets, shines by reflected light. Like Earth, Jupiter was observed to have satellites; hence, Earth had been demoted from its unique position. The phases of Venus proved that that planet orbits the Sun, not Earth."}, {"url": "https://lens.monash.edu/@science/2021/07/26/1383475/the-scientific-genius-who-eschewed-fame-remembering-thomas-harriot-400-years-on", "page_content": "Four hundred years ago, on 2 July, 1621, a remarkable Englishman named Thomas Harriot died in London. He left behind some 8000 pages of scientific research, but it\u2019s only in recent decades that scholars have uncovered their treasures.\n\nAnd what they show is that Harriot independently made many significant discoveries now attributed to other, more famous scientists. Some scholars have called him \u201cthe English Galileo\u201d and \u201cthe greatest British mathematical scientist before Newton\u201d.\n\nYet Harriot died without publishing a single word of this extraordinary output. His tale reminds us that, while we may sometimes think science progresses through a series of renowned pioneers who single-handedly overturn entrenched beliefs, the story is rarely so simple.\n\nWhat did Harriot discover?\n\nFor instance, we learn in school that Galileo Galilei initiated telescopic astronomy and discovered the law of falling motion. But Harriot independently did both of these things.\n\nThomas Harriot\u2019s 1609 map of the Moon, drawn by observing through a telescope. Image: Wikimedia\n\nHe also deduced fledgling general laws governing the motion of everyday objects, again independently of Galileo, and before Ren\u00e9 Descartes. (Half a century later, Isaac Newton developed the definitive laws of motion.)\n\nHarriot studied light, too, discovering the secret of colour and the nature of the rainbow before Newton, and finding the law of refraction (which we know today as Snell\u2019s law) before the Dutch astronomer Willebrord Snell.\n\nHe also made a mathematical study of population growth before Thomas Malthus, developed a completely symbolic form of sophisticated algebra before Descartes, discovered binary arithmetic before Gottfried Leibniz, and took steps on the road to calculus with his work on infinite series.\n\nThe law of falling bodies\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 2008 that Harriot\u2019s work on gravity was fully reconstructed, by the German scholar Matthias Schemmel.\n\nAs Schemmel pointed out, Harriot and his contemporary Galileo were heirs to essentially the same body of knowledge. It\u2019s perhaps not so surprising, then, that they made some of the same breakthroughs. There are plenty of examples of independent co-discoveries in history, most famously that of calculus by Newton and Leibniz.\n\nThe law of falling motion says that without air resistance, all objects, no matter their size or mass, fall from the same height at the same rate.\n\nLegend has it Galileo dropped balls from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to study how they fell. Nobody knows if this is true, but Harriot had the same idea \u2013 he recorded the time, in pulse beats, that it took for different objects falling from as high as 55\u00bd feet (about 17 metres) to reach the ground.\n\nRead more: Copernicus' revolution and Galileo's vision: Our changing view of the universe in pictures\n\nBoth Harriot and Galileo devised more accurate experiments, however, from which they derived a mathematical understanding of how things fall.\n\nThis combination of experiment and mathematics is now the accepted way to derive a law of nature. Quantifying observations means others can test the results, and use them to make useful predictions.\n\nHarriot and Galileo weren\u2019t the first to understand the role of observation and mathematics in this context, of course. But they were among the most successful of the pre-Newtonian pioneers.\n\nGalileo didn\u2019t publish his work on gravity until after Harriot had died, and there\u2019s no evidence that the two men ever met or corresponded.\n\nThe law of refraction and the shape of the rainbow\n\nThe German astronomer Johannes Kepler, however, did correspond briefly with Harriot. Kepler had been working on the nature of light and vision when word reached him that Harriot had unravelled two mysteries \u2013 the law of refraction, and why the rainbow has its magical colours and unique shape.\n\nThe law of refraction describes how light bends when it passes from one medium into another, which explains how an image can be focused by a glass lens, or why your leg looks wobbly when you dip it in a swimming pool.\n\nA diagram from Ibn Sahl\u2019s 10th-century treatise on optics showing the path of light refracted by a lens. Image: Wikimedia\n\nHarriot derived this law 20 years before Snell, but there\u2019s a popular belief that the 10th-century Baghdad-based scholar Ab\u016b Sa\u02bfd al-\u02bfAl\u0101\u02be ibn Sahl beat even Harriot. This is not quite right \u2013 Ibn Sahl is a notable pioneer whose geometrical diagram of light focused by a lens gives, in hindsight, the correct refractive path. But there\u2019s no evidence he deduced his result from experiment, or that he understood the general properties of refraction.\n\nJudging from his surviving papers, even Snell failed to generalise his result, which he, like Ibn Sahl, never wrote as the neat trigonometric equation we use today. Harriot, by contrast, did. His derivation of the general law of refraction is another example of his rigorous blend of experiment and mathematics.\n\nRead more: Curious Kids: Why are rainbows round?\n\nHarriot\u2019s other adventures\n\nIf only Harriot had published! In the early stage of his career, though, he was bound by commercial secrecy, for his first patron was controversial statesman and entrepreneur Sir Walter Raleigh. Harriot was also busy dodging heretic hunters, and sailing the high seas as Raleigh\u2019s navigational advisor.\n\nThomas Harriot published only one work in his lifetime \u2013 a report on his stay in North America in the 1580s. Image: Wikimedia\n\nRaleigh had delusions of empire and glory, and wanted to establish a trading colony in today\u2019s US before the Spanish beat him to it. The one work Harriot did publish in his lifetime was \u201ca brief and true report\u201d on the economic potential of Raleigh\u2019s chosen American site.\n\nHarriot\u2019s contribution to colonialism has justly attracted its share of criticism. Nonetheless, his report is still widely praised for its sympathetic depiction of the way of life of the North Carolina Algonquian people, as it was when Europeans first set foot on their land. Harriot learned the local language, and enjoyed much about the year he spent living with the Algonquians.\n\nWhat he loved doing most, though, was mathematics and physics. He was neither flamboyant nor ambitious, and when he was wrongfully imprisoned through an unlucky connection with the Gunpowder Plot (a failed attempt to assassinate King James I), he told his jailers he just wanted ...\n\n\u201c... to live a private life for the love of learning that I might study freely\u201d.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the late 1590s, Harriot had found a second patron, Henry Percy, the ninth earl of Northumberland. It was then that he was able to study the mysteries of nature and the marvels of mathematics for their own sakes, rather than the \u201capplied\u201d work he had done for Raleigh.\n\nHaving two generous patrons meant Harriot didn\u2019t need to publicise his discoveries to attract funding, the way Galileo did. Nor did he care about fame, despite being urged by friends to claim his priority. His manuscripts do contain several almost-finished treatises, but it seems he was so busy doing science that he never managed to put his results together for the printer.\n\nAfter his death, well-meaning scholars carved up his manuscripts in an attempt to study and publish them. In the process, however, all the papers disappeared, seemingly lost forever. Then, 150 years later, the Hungarian astronomer Franz Xaver Zach discovered them, locked safely away in Northumberland\u2019s castle.\n\nMost of the papers were then given to the British Museum. They\u2019re now in the British Library, where I had the privilege of studying them. (They\u2019re also available online.)\n\nAs for Harriot, no one knows much about him as a person \u2013 not even his birthday. Nevertheless, he\u2019s fascinated scholars for the past half-century (as I discovered some years ago when I set out to bring his story to a wider, non-specialist readership).\n\nThat\u2019s because despite the lack of biographical data, those precious manuscripts show that what mattered most to Harriot himself was mathematics and science. Four hundred years on, his mix of genius and dedication is something to honour.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Conversation."}, {"url": "https://global.oup.com/academic/product/thomas-harriot-9780190271855", "page_content": "\"While other historians less literate in science and mathematics might have written Harriot's biography in a different manner, she has provided to us a well-written guide to this mysterious scientist who measured everything during the six productive decades of his life.\" - Larry E.

Thomas Harriot: A Life in Science is a wonderful combination of biography, history, and popular science that pulses with the spirit of its time.\" \u2014Jessie Childs, author of God's Traitors\"\n\n\"The story of Thomas Harriot's life and works, was it not so well documented by such a respected scholar as Dr. Arianrhod, could easily be thought a work of pure fiction - and extravagant, scarcely believable fiction at that. Yet it is all true. That Dr. Arianrhod has devoted the time and effort in bringing him back to us through this absolutely captivating biography is something for which we should all be deeply grateful, and in similar gratitude, we owe it to the memory, indeed, the unrelentingly curious and inquiring spirit, of Thomas Harriot himself, to read it.\" - The Well-Read Naturalist"}, {"url": "https://euro-math-soc.eu/review/thomas-harriot", "page_content": "As a young mathematician and astronomer, Thomas Harriot (c. 1560-1621), was hired by Sir Walter Ralegh, to train the captains of the ships ready to cross the Atlantic and claim some territory for England in the New World. Ralegh was a poet, politician, and frequenter of the court of Queen Elisabeth I. The faith of the two man was entangled since. A first expedition brought two native Americans back to England and Harriot learned their language and invented a phonetic alphabet to write it down. He even crossed the ocean himself to visit their home land during a second expedition. After his return, he wrote the only book published during his life: The Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia (Virginia named after Elisabeth, the virgin queen). He continued working for Ralegh as a land surveyor. Later Harriot got employed by Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland. With observations and tedious computations he improved his skills as an astronomer, a mathematician, and a physicist.\n\nElisabeth, the short tempered virgin queen, depended on trusted advisors like Ralegh and Percy, but when Ralegh got married without her consent, she considered it treason. The period was turbulent with many political en religious tensions for example with the catholic Queen Mary of Scots, and hence also with France and Spain resulting in naval battles. Privateering was a lucrative pastime for the crew of the ships that were exploring the New World. Political compromises and treason, spying and conspiracies, were common games for Queen Elisabeth and her successor King James. Take on top of that the emergence of the scientific revolution of the 17th century, and the exploration of the North and South Americas, and Arianrhod has all the ingredients to write a thrilling and adventurous novel about it, and so he did. Only it is all based on true and well documented facts.\n\nArianrhod has found a good balance between explaining the mathematical and astronomical work of Harriot, and sketching what happened on a political and personal level of the main characters that he describes in the turmoil of events at the end of the 16th and the early 17th century. These main characters whose fortunes and misfortunes are told, are besides Harriot mainly Ralegh and to some extend also Percy but there are many others as well. Too many to keep track of if this were a fiction novel, but real life is not that simple. A name list in the appendix with one line description per name might have been welcome for a reader not so familiar with the period, its politics and its science.\n\nIt is characteristic of many biographers that they bring an idolatrous glorification of their subject. Somehow this struck me in this book too. It is clear that Arianrhod describes Harriot and Ralegh as the worthy heroes with almost sacred virtues. For example the attitude that Harriot and Ralegh have towards the native Americans, considering them as friends and treating them with respect, leaving their dignity is unusual for that time. The devotion of Ralegh for his queen, even when she locked him up in the Tower of London for many years (as she also did with Percy) is outspoken. His continued attempts to colonise parts of North and South America to flatter the Queen (which both turned out to be disastrous) and the noble way he behaved on the scaffold when he was beheaded under King James I are almost beyond human limits.\n\nHarriot fell under the bad faith of his employers when they were accused of treason, and that shone on him and his work and ideas were scrutinized for possible atheistic elements. He was even imprisoned for a short while on the charge that he had cast an horoscope on King James during the Gunpowder Plot. However, he always tried to stay somewhat in the shadow, concentrating on his scientific work, and so he escaped most of the misfortunes that befell on his employers and could have been his faith too. This is one element of excitement, but the whole book is a thriller: will the pioneers survive crossing the ocean, will they survive in the midst of unknown tribes, will the prisoners of the Tower be executed, will the catholic Gunpowder Plot or the courtier's Main Plot against King James be a success, will the war at sea with Spain be won, will the money be raised for yet a new expedition,... all components that can bring some tension in an engaging story told with brio. That is why, besides Harriot, Ralegh, and Percy, many other (mostly political and scientific) characters are staged in this complicated interplay of intrigues. And Arianrhod is not the first to use these elements in a book. He suggests that Shakespeare has used some of the events described here as scenes in his plays.\n\nWhen it comes to Harriot himself, these parts of the book are mainly about his scientific achievements. The reader is instructed about how Harriot explained the seamen what they should know to find the position of his ship, and how they could compute it in an efficient way. We learn about his study of the loxodromic curve and the equiangular spiral, how he unravelled the secret of the Mercator projection, how he measured the acceleration of free falling objects to study gravitation and how he computed the trajectory of a canon ball (that was before Newton formulated his laws of motion). Harriot studied the precession of the Earth and the Gregorian calendar, the refraction of light and gave an explanation for the rainbow. We read about his atomistic views, his exploration of probability theory, and of course his astronomical computations and his study of sunspots. He produced a map of the moon and he had some correspondence with Kepler. He was also one of the first to simplify algebra by introducing symbolic notation: he used letters for variables, he had a notation for exponents, a variant of our equal sign,... Arianrhod places all his discoveries in context, sometimes going back to Greek antiquity or by discussing contemporaries or scientists who came after Harriot who discovered the same things independently, and whose name became attached to these results.\n\nIt is a shame that Harriot did not publish more because that would certainly have given him a reputation comparable to Galileo, Kepler, and cartographers and mathematicians of his time. When at the age of sixty he seemed to be ready to start rounding up his work and publish it, he got health problems. It might have been a kind of cancer that started with his nose that finally killed him. It is not unlikely that it was caused by excessively smoking tobacco. Allegedly he, and his employer Ralegh, are responsible for introducing pipe smoking in England. He made his testament and asked some friend to order his notes and publish them posthumously. However not much came out of that. His notes got lost until they were rediscovered at the end of the 18th century, but again, it took a long time before it was recognized that Harriot had a lot of results that we now know by the name of other scientists, while Harriot had these already much earlier. Slowly Harriot's achievements were realized by historians analysing his notes that are now fully digitized and made available through the European Cultural Heritage Online.\n\nTo conclude: this is a marvelous book because of the engaging way it is told, very much unlike a dull biography with an enumeration of facts. Moreover it is also well documented by additional material to be found in the last 100 pages of the book. There you can find a number of graphic illustrations that are needed to understand some of the mathematics that are discussed. These are moved to the appendix probably to allow the reader to skip some of the mathematics if he or she is not interested. Many of these extra pages are filled with notes that explain some background or give the origin of a quote or a justification for a statement in the text. Of course the list of primary and secondary sources used are there too, and a well stuffed index of names and subjects. A warmly recommended read about England in the period of Shakespeare, shortly before Newton, with in the background a turbulent dance of politics, when war could still be avoided by marriage, but fighting over colonizing the Americas, and over religious controversies never ceased. On this canvas Arianrhod paints the bubbling emergence of the Scientific Revolution to which Harriot was a silent contributor."}]}
