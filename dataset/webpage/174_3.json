{"Vagos Motorcycle Club have a rivalry with the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club.": [{"url": "https://www.history.co.uk/shows/outlaw-chronicles-hells-angels/articles/history-of-the-vagos-mc", "page_content": "History of the Vagos MC\n\nThe year is 1965. USA are in the middle of the Vietnam War, Martin Luther King has recently marched from Selma to Montgomery and Roger Miller\u2019s \u2018King of the Road\u2019 is number one. Thirteen bikers meet on the corner of Eighth and Davidson in San Bernardino, California to form the Vagos Motorcycle Club, beginning a history that would involve drug trafficking, clashes with the police and a violent rivalry with the Hells Angels.\n\nThe elected president was Rudy Esparza, nicknamed Puro, who led the new club in selecting their name. Other names considered included Coffin Dogers MC and Satan\u2019s Saints MC, but Vagos MC, Spanish for vagabond, was chosen. Their new patch, a red devil on a green background, was inspired by an image of a devil in LIFE magazine entitled \u2018Return from hell.\u2019\n\nMore Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs (OMGs) were established in the 1960s than in any other decade. The outlaw status is given to groups who are not sanctioned by the American Motorcyclists Association (AMA). They are also known as 1%ers, a term which originated after the Hollister biker riot in 1947 when the AMA allegedly claimed the 99% of bikers were law abiding citizens, although the AMA have no record of issuing this as an official or public statement.\n\nBikers would often move between clubs or find their club being absorbed into a larger club. Puro had previously been with the Psychos MC and others joined from clubs including El Diablo MC. The question of whether the Vagos would absorb or be absorbed was very quickly answered as more Chapters sprang up across California. In 2014 the FBI listed the Vagos as one of the largest Outlaw Motorcycle Groups in Western America with 600 members in 24 Chapters throughout America, as well as Chapters in Canada, Mexico and Europe.\n\nThe Mafia on wheels?\n\nDescribed by Vagos infiltrator Charles Falco as \u201cthe mafia on wheels\u201d the Vagos have more than earned their 1%er patch. Drug related arrests have been made throughout their colourful history. In 1987 the head of the South Bay Chapter and President of the Desert Hot Springs Chapter along with three others all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute methamphetamines. Over 40 pounds of cocaine and eight pounds of methamphetamines (and a rocket launcher!) were seized in a 2011 raid. And in 2014 four Vagos members were arrested by the FBI for selling methamphetamines.\n\nAlongside money laundering and weapons trafficking, the Vagos are also known for their general violence, especially with rival OMGs. As the Vagos attempted to expand their territory tension erupted between them and other OMGs most notably the Hells Angels. In 2001 a bloody melee broke out between the Vagos and the Angels in the Californian city of Costa Mesa. And in 2010 an argument over which gang got to hang out in the Starbucks in Santa Cruz escalated. A brawl outside the coffee shop led to a gunfight in Chino Valley, several drive by shootings and a bitter feud.\n\nThe authorities have successfully infiltrated the Vagos a number of times. George Rowe, a street criminal whose friend had disappeared after an incident with the Vagos, volunteered to go undercover as part of Operation 22 in 2003. His evidence gathered over 3 years resulted in 42 arrests and convictions for crimes as serious as murder. Whilst Charles Falco worked his way up to number two of the Victorville Chapter and provided the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) gathering enough information to make 62 arrests for crimes including assault and murder. Fun fact, both Rowe and Falco have written books about their experiences and actually appear as characters in each other\u2019s books.\n\nHowever the Vagos have their own weapon in their ongoing battle with the police- the lawsuit. In 1990 the Vagos sued the police and received a $2 million settlement claiming they were targets of massive police abuse in the early eighties. And in 2010 when the Vagos were blamed for a spree of homemade booby traps that targeted the police, they once again sued and received a settlement that included a public statement and the return of property seized the previous year.\n\n1%ers\n\nAs with all criminal groups the Vagos don\u2019t advertise their more notorious crimes. Their PR website vagosmcworld.com, presents them as a club rather than a gang. Their consistent response to arrests is that it is not all of their members committing crimes, but a few bad apples. So, organised crime syndicate or a club where just 1% of the 1%ers are giving them a bad name\u2026?"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/hells-angels-vagos-shooting-vegas-motorcycles-8749ff62558bc897bdd75661688eb6c7", "page_content": "FILE - Richard Devries, 66, makes his initial court appearances in Henderson Justice Court Thursday, June 2, 2022, in Henderson, Nev.

Her ruling followed a March 31 hearing with attorneys and defendants in the case.\n\nAttorney Richard Schonfeld, representing Devries, said Monday he was pleased the judge \u201cgranted important aspects of my motion.\u201d He had argued that the indictment was too broad and should be dismissed or revised.\n\nProsecutors Michael Dickerson and Michael Allmon said they were looking at the ruling and declined immediate comment. They could appeal Jones\u2019 decision to the Nevada Supreme Court.\n\nAttorneys for the other defendants did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nDevries and the men identified as Hells Angels members or associates \u2014 Russell Smith, Stephen Alo, Cameron Treich, Taylor Rodriguez, Aaron Chun and Rayann Mollasgo \u2014 still face prosecution on charges including attempted murder, conspiracy to commit murder, battery and assault with weapons. Each has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Each could face up to 40 years in prison if convicted of attempted murder with a weapon.\n\nThe judge instructed prosecutors to revise the indictment. A hearing in the case remained scheduled Wednesday.\n\nPolice said seven people were treated at hospitals for wounds or injuries following the gunfire that erupted among motorcycle riders on Interstate 11 in Henderson after a Memorial Day weekend ceremony at a veterans cemetery in Boulder City.\n\nSchonfeld argued March 31 that Mollasgo, a Hells Angels associate but not a full member, was treated for a gunshot wound, and that police at the scene examined handguns that some of the alleged Vagos had with them, but returned them.\n\n\u201cThe grand jury doesn\u2019t know that a Hells Angels-affiliated individual (was) shot and that four Vagos members had firearms concealed on their person,\u201d Schonfeld said. He argued that prosecutors failed to present \u201dexculpatory evidence\u201d that might cast doubt on the charges they were seeking.\n\nFour motorcycles had gunshot damage, according to evidence, and police found 25 bullet casings on the freeway near where the gunfire took place. Schonfeld told the judge the indictment did not specify what person was alleged to have fired which shots, or which bullets hit which motorcycle.\n\nMollasgo\u2019s lawyer, Augustus Claus, told Jones that his client had become a member of the Hells Angels chapter less than a week before the shooting, but he was accused of a conspiracy with other members dating to 2019.\n\nSchonfeld and Tom Pitaro, attorney representing defendants Russell Smith and Stephen Alo, told the judge that prosecutors never presented evidence that their clients had any intent or agreement to commit a crime.\n\n\u201cRiding (motorcycles) in a group does not show a conspiracy to commit a violent act of shooting (or) attempted murder,\u201d Pitaro said."}, {"url": "https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2022-05-31/police-report-describes-vagos-bikers-ambush-by-hells-angels", "page_content": "By KEN RITTER, Associated Press\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 A Memorial Day weekend shooting on a Las Vegas-area freeway was an apparent ambush by Hells Angels members on rival Vagos biker gang members returning from a veterans cemetery ride, according to a police report made public Tuesday.\n\nRichard John Devries, who police identified as the Las Vegas Hells Angels chapter president, and club recruits Russell Smith and Stephen Alo were arrested late Sunday, several hours after the shooting on U.S. 95, according to Henderson police reports.\n\nAt least six of the seven people taken to hospitals with wounds or injuries following the midday Sunday gunfire were Vagos members or affiliates, the report said.

Santa Cruz Deputy Police Chief Steve Clark analyzed the situation for Reuters, saying, \"It was all about who would be allowed to hang out at the Starbucks downtown... Only in Santa Cruz would you have biker wars over who's going to control pumpkin spice lattes.\" In this case, it was the Vagos who were encroaching on turf that had been considered part of Hells Angels territory.\n\nThe fight spread to other states and continued to escalate. In August 2010, 27 members of the Vagos and the Hells Angels were arrested in Arizona for taking part in a shoot out that resulted in at least five wounded victims. According to CBS News, the violent confrontation took place shortly after the Vagos moved in nearby to a house owned by the Hells Angels. At least 50 rounds of ammunition were exchanged between the two gangs during a house party, reports CBS affiliate KPHO.\n\nThe violence crossed state lines again and turned deadly in September 2011.

He and thousands of other bikers were in Sparks, Nevada for the annual \"Street Vibrations\" biker festival when a skirmish between the Hells Angels and the Vagos erupted on the floor of the John Ascuaga's Nugget Casino Resort in Sparks. In addition to Pettigrew, two Vagos members were wounded but taken to the hospital in stable condition, according to the Mercury News.\n\nThe next day, another motorcyclist was shot in the stomach by someone driving a car, reports ABC News.

He asked the jury to remember the testimony of the man who endured kicks while on the ground.\n\nPolice asking members and associates of Bandidos Motorcycle Club for help in quadruple murder\n\n\u201cI was going to be killed that night,\u201d Kennedy said, quoting Robert Wiggins\u2019 testimony. \u201cThe only reason I\u2019m here is because someone saved my life.\u201d\n\nClosings by other defense attorneys are scheduled Thursday, followed by prosecutor John Han\u2019s case summary.
