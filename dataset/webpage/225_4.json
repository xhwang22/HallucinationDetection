{"Hisashi Iwakuma was an American League (AL) All-Star in 2013.": [{"url": "https://theathletic.com/2147688/2020/10/19/appreciating-hisashi-iwakumas-memorable-mariners-moments/", "page_content": "The Mariners weren\u2019t entirely sure what they were getting when they signed Japanese pitcher Hisashi Iwakuma to a one-year deal in January 2012.\n\nIwakuma, a right-hander, had a decorated past in Japan and a history of durability, but he was four months shy of his 31st birthday when he signed with Seattle. And on top of that, he was coming off a season where a sore right shoulder limited him to 17 starts and his diminished velocity raised red flags.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeattle\u2019s caution was revealed in the terms of Iwakuma\u2019s deal with the team \u2014 one year and $1.15 million, though the contract did come with incentives that could garner Iwakuma an additional $3 million. In an offseason where the Mariners had chased free agent slugger Prince Fielder, the deal for Iwakuma felt, well, a little underwhelming.\n\nBut over parts of the next six seasons, Iwakuma \u2014 who on Monday announced he will retire following the end of the season in Japan \u2014 not only proved a value for Seattle but provided plenty of memorable moments along the way, accumulating a 16.9 WAR and a 3.42 ERA before heading back to his home country in 2018.\n\n\u201cKuma is a warrior, is my best way to put it,\u201d Mariners manager Scott Servais said in 2018. \u201cHe\u2019d come into a ballgame and you\u2019d look up in the first or second inning and think, \u2018My gosh, he doesn\u2019t have much today. How\u2019s he going to get through it?\u2019 And he\u2019d find a way.\u201d\n\nIwakuma was an All-Star and finished third in the American League Cy Young Award voting in 2013 when he had a 2.66 ERA. Two years later, he tossed the fifth no-hitter in franchise history. In September 2018, a year after undergoing shoulder surgery, Iwakuma decided to head back to Japan to finishing pitching where he started. He\u2019s on the roster of the Tokyo Giants but has yet to pitch this season because of lingering shoulder issues.\n\nAs for his time in Seattle, Iwakuma said it was an unforgettable chapter in his professional and personal life.\n\n\u201cThis is a city that I played for, for seven years and a city that I not only lived in, it\u2019s by far the best city that I can think of,\u201d Iwakuma said in September 2018 through his interpreter, Antony Suzuki. \u201cThe city has treated me well. The fans were great. I only have good memories here.\u201d\n\nWe decided to pay homage to Iwakuma\u2019s time in Seattle by breaking down his three best starts with the Mariners (sorted by Baseball-Reference\u2019s game scores).\n\n3. Sept. 25, 2013 vs. Royals (Game score: 82)\n\nHis line: 8 innings, 4 hits, 0 earned runs, 1 walk, 9 strikeouts\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was Iwakuma\u2019s final start in his best season with the Mariners, who would finish 71-91 \u2014 20 games ahead of the Astros (!). This was a pretty nice Royals lineup Iwakuma had his way with. Alex Gordon, Billy Butler, Eric Hosmer, Salvador P\u00e9rez, Mike Moustakas \u2014 a lot of these guys helped the Royals win the World Series two years later, but this loss eliminated the Royals from the postseason. Iwakuma got 13 swinging strikes and 17 called strikes while the Mariners turned two double plays behind him. In many ways, it was the perfect finish to an almost perfect season for Iwakuma, who was 4-0 with a 1.62 ERA over his final eight starts and didn\u2019t allow a run in 23 consecutive innings over his last three games. Get this: He was the only big-league pitcher in 2013 to have two streaks of 20-plus scoreless innings. \u201cHe\u2019s special,\u201d Mariners third baseman Kyle Seager said.\n\n2. Aug. 19, 2014 at Phillies (Game score: 85)\n\nHis line: 8 innings, 4 hits, 0 earned runs, 0 walks, 11 strikeouts\n\nFacing a less-than-stellar lineup (the Phillies finished 2014 with a 73-89 record), Iwakuma carved up the Fightins with an outing that was equal part dominant and efficient, as 74 of the 96 pitches he threw were for strikes over his eight innings of work. The Phillies were guessing all night, as evidenced by the 23 called strikes he amassed. Iwakuma\u2019s split-finger fastball proved devastating, especially against a team not used to seeing him \u2014 remember, this was interleague play. Only one player on the roster, Ben Revere, had ever faced Iwakuma. This was just the third interleague start in Iwakuma\u2019s career. The results of those three starts? Twenty-two scoreless innings. \u201cHe was outstanding,\u201d Seattle manager Lloyd McClendon said. \u201cHe commanded all of his pitches. He was in and out and up and down.\u201d\n\n1. Aug. 12, 2015 vs Orioles (Game score: 91)\n\nHis line: 9 innings, 0 hits, 0 earned runs, 3 walks, 7 strikeouts\n\nYou were waiting for this one, right? Iwakuma authored the fifth no-hitter in franchise history during a Wednesday afternoon game against the Orioles, who weren\u2019t actually awful in 2015 (finishing 81-81). He became just the second Japanese pitcher in Major League history to throw a no-hitter (Hideo Nomo was the first to do so in 2001). The funny thing (well, sort of funny) was that Iwakuma was neither overpowering (seven strikeouts), nor supremely in command (three walks). But he was plenty good, getting 19 swinging strikes. Said Orioles manager Buck Showalter after the game. \u201cHe didn\u2019t miss.\u201d There were no real close calls in the field for Iwakuma. Seager made a nice over-the-shoulder catch for the first out in foul territory to start the ninth inning, and the n0-no was complete when Iwakuma got Gerardo Parra to line out softly to center fielder Austin Jackson. This was the first American League no-hitter since F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez threw a perfect game against the Rays on Aug. 15, 2012. \u201cI can\u2019t find the words to express my feelings,\u201d Iwakuma said after the game. \u201cI\u2019m truly happy.\u201d\n\n(Photo of Iwakuma: Otto Greule Jr / Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/i/iwakuhi01.shtml", "page_content": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nHow old is Hisashi Iwakuma?\n\nHisashi Iwakuma is 42 years old.\n\nWhen was Hisashi Iwakuma born?\n\nHisashi Iwakuma was born on April 12, 1981.\n\nWhere was Hisashi Iwakuma born?\n\nHisashi Iwakuma was born in Higashi Yamato, Tokyo.\n\nHow tall is Hisashi Iwakuma?\n\nHisashi Iwakuma is 6-3 (190 cm) tall.\n\nHow much did Hisashi Iwakuma weigh when playing?\n\nHisashi Iwakuma weighed 210 lbs (95 kg) when playing.\n\nHow many seasons did Hisashi Iwakuma play?\n\nHisashi Iwakuma played 6 seasons.\n\nIs Hisashi Iwakuma in the Hall of Fame?\n\nHisashi Iwakuma has not been elected into the Hall of Fame.\n\nWhat position did Hisashi Iwakuma play?\n\nHisashi Iwakuma was a Pitcher.\n\nHow many strikeouts did Hisashi Iwakuma have?\n\nHisashi Iwakuma had 714 strikeouts over his career.\n\nHow many teams has Hisashi Iwakuma played for?\n\nHisashi Iwakuma played for 1 team, the Seattle Mariners.\n\nHow many World Series has Hisashi Iwakuma won?\n\nHisashi Iwakuma has never won a World Series.\n\nWhen did Hisashi Iwakuma retire?\n\nHisashi Iwakuma last played in 2017.\n\nWhat are Hisashi Iwakuma's nicknames?\n\nKuma is a nickname for Hisashi Iwakuma."}, {"url": "https://www.mlb.com/player/hisashi-iwakuma-547874", "page_content": "2017\n\nHisashi Iwakuma\u2026he and his wife, Madoka, have the three kids, daughter Uta, son Towa and daughter Rima\u2026attended Horikoshi High School\u2026played in 2004 Athens Olympics and 2009 World Baseball Classic\u2026originally selected by Osaka Kintetsu in fifth round of the 1999 NPB amateur draft\u2026nicknamed \"Kuma,\" which is Japanese for \"Bear.\"\n\nWas 0-2 with a 4.35 ERA (15 ER, 31.0 IP) with 16 strikeouts in 6 starts with Seattle\u2026 underwent arthroscopic right shoulder debridement surgery on September 27\u2026surgery was performed by Dr. Keith Meister in Dallas, Texas\u2026on 10-day DL May 10 (retro to May 7) with inflammation in right shoulder before being transferred to 60-day DL on July 24\u2026 sent on rehab assignment on June 14 and made two starts with High-A Modesto, going 0-1 with a 6.00 ERA (4 ER, 6.0 IP) before recall (but not activation) from rehab on June 22.\n\n2016\n\nThe Totals - Was 16-12 with a 4.12 ERA (91 ER, 199.0 IP) with 147 strikeouts and 46 walks in 33 starts...Team Leader - Led the Mariners in wins (16), starts (33), innings (199.0) and strikeouts (147)...

The deal includes a one-year contract for 2016 and options for the 2017 and 2018 seasons. Financial terms were not announced.\n\n\"We said from the start that Kuma was a priority for us,\" Dipoto said in a statement. \"Obviously, the developments from the last few days allowed us to get back in the game. It's a credit to our ownership -- to Howard Lincoln, to Kevin Mather, to our entire ownership group -- that we were able to get aggressive and find a way to bring Kuma back to the Mariners. We're all thrilled. This is a big move for us.\"\n\nIwakuma was a priority for Seattle in the offseason, but the Dodgers and Iwakuma struck a deal Dec. 6, a pact reportedly for three years and roughly $45 million.\n\nHowever, the deal was never completed. A source told ESPN's Mark Saxon earlier Thursday that it was in jeopardy after the Dodgers reviewed Iwakuma's physical.\n\nThe Japan-based Jiji Press first reported Thursday that the Dodgers were backing away after the physical.\n\nHisashi Iwakuma's deal with Seattle is a one-year contract for 2016 with options for the 2017 and 2018 seasons. Otto Greule Jr./Getty Images\n\nThe medical issue revealed by the physical is not yet known.\n\nDipoto's announcement that Iwakuma would be rejoining the Mariners sparked raucous applause at their holiday party:\n\nIwakuma, who turns 35 in April, was 9-5 with a 3.54 ERA in 20 starts last season for the Mariners, including the first no-hitter of his career in August against Baltimore, and was 4-2 with a 2.17 ERA over his final seven starts. He was limited by a strained lat muscle last season.\n\nIwakuma has pitched his entire career in the majors with Seattle, going 47-25 with a 3.17 ERA in 111 games. He was an All-Star in 2013 and became the second Japanese-born pitcher to throw a no-hitter, joining Hideo Nomo. Since being moved into Seattle's rotation on July 2, 2012, Iwakuma has the fourth-best ERA in the American League at 3.09. When healthy, he has been a stabilizing part of Seattle's rotation, often slotting behind ace Felix Hernandez.\n\nJerry Dipoto delivers a special gift to the front office at the #Mariners holiday party: Kuma is back. pic.twitter.com/8Bo8Y93ub2 \u2014 Seattle Mariners (@Mariners) December 18, 2015\n\nThe Mariners also traded for left-handed starter Wade Miley from Boston after it appeared they had lost Iwakuma to Los Angeles.\n\nIwakuma's return all but sets Seattle's rotation going into spring training. Iwakuma and Hernandez will be the anchors, and they will be joined by Miley; Nathan Karns, who was acquired in a November trade; and young standout Taijuan Walker.\n\n\"We feel like this really puts a finishing touch on what we think has been a very productive offseason,\" Dipoto said.\n\nThe Dodgers would have had to forfeit their No. 25 overall pick in June's draft had they signed Iwakuma because he rejected the Mariners' $15.8 million qualifying offer in November.\n\nLos Angeles continues to look for help in its rotation, which now includes Clayton Kershaw, Brett Anderson, Alex Wood and, it hopes, Hyun-Jin Ryu, who is coming off May shoulder surgery.\n\nThe Dodgers swapped three prospects for three other prospects in a three-team deal with the Cincinnati Reds that sent All-Star third baseman Todd Frazier to the Chicago White Sox on Wednesday.\n\nThat deal could be the precursor to a larger trade.

And he'd find a way.\n\n\"His feel to pitch, to maneuver through a lineup, to get out of trouble and make pitches when he has to, when his back is to the wall, Kuma can really pitch.

He doesn't possess a blazing fastball that blows up radar guns while blowing hitters away. And he certainly doesn't fall into the big-name-that-can't-be-ignored category.\n\nIt's not Justin Verlander. Or Yu Darvish. Or even Felix Hernandez.\n\nAnd Max Scherzer can take his 10-0 record and shove it.\n\nNo, the hurler who deserves to be the AL starter at next month's Midsummer Classic is none other than...\n\nHisashi Iwakuma.\n\nSure, you know the name. And you should at least be able to recognize that Iwakuma pitches for the Seattle Mariners. You may even be vaguely aware of the kind of season he's having.\n\nBut unless you're a Mariners fan or perhaps an owner of Iwakuma on your fantasy team\u2014and if so, congratulations\u2014then you probably think this suggestion is ridiculous.\n\nHere's why it's anything but.\n\nFirst, a little Iwakuma info to help you get to know the guy who may well wind up winding up for the AL team at Citi Field on July 16.\n\nAs alluded to above, Iwakuma is no young pup. In fact, he turned 32 back in April. The right-hander, born in Tokyo, spent a decade pitching in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball, where he was one of that league's best arms. Last year was Iwakuma's first in Major League Baseball, while this is his first as a full-time starter.\n\nAlso as mentioned, Iwakuma's average fastball doesn't even crack the 90-mph mark (per FanGraphs), which makes what he's doing, like stuff in the video below, all the more noteworthy.\n\nWhy haven't you heard more about Iwakuma? Probably because he was overshadowed by Darvish as a Japanese import during the 2011-12 offseason.\n\nBeyond that, Iwakuma actually spent the first part of 2012 hidden in the Mariners bullpen for some reason. He only pitched in five of Seattle's first 54 games a year ago, and he didn't enter the rotation until last July.\n\nAlso? Not for nothing, but the guy is on the Mariners. Not only are the M's a bad baseball team for the umpteenth consecutive season, they're also on the West Coast. In other words, many of Seattle's games are just getting started after plenty of folks\u2014even real baseball fans\u2014in earlier time zones have already begun dreaming about the latest gem twirled by Clay Buchholz or Chris Sale.\n\nNow, because so few of you actually have a real idea of what Iwakuma's been up to through the first two-and-a-half months of the 2013 season, feast your eyes on this table:\n\nThose numbers cover the most basic stats, and as you can see, Iwakuma basically aces them all.\n\nLet's delve a little deeper, though. Here's a chart showing where Iwakuma ranks among AL arms in some of the more advanced metrics:\n\nOkay, so Iwakuma doesn't dominate these stats quite as much, but he's still in the top 20 in all of them and in or around the top 10 in many.\n\nAnd now for the doozy.\n\nThis next table lists all of the pitchers in the Junior Circuit who currently meet all of the following benchmarks...\n\nan ERA of 2.50 or lower\n\na walk rate of 2.5/9 or lower\n\na strikeout rate of 8.0/9 or higher\n\na FIP of 3.50 or lower\n\nof 3.50 or lower an xFIP of 3.50 or lower\n\nof 3.50 or lower a WAR of 2.0 or higher\n\nThat's right: Only three AL starters hit each and every one of those standards.\n\nGoing by those cutoffs\u2014which are admittedly somewhat arbitrary and yet also extremely impressive\u2014you could make just as strong a case for either Hernandez, Iwakuma's rotation-mate, or the White Sox's Sale.\n\nSale, though, gets knocked down a peg because, great as he's been, he's also thrown far fewer innings\u2014just 85.1\u2014due in part to missing a start in late May with left shoulder tendonitis.\n\nHey, when you're splitting hairs, that sort of thing counts.\n\nOf course, many would argue that the pitcher who should start is Darvish, given his otherworldly combination of hype, power fastball, never-ending repertoire\u2014and the fact that he leads all of baseball with 137 strikeouts (12.2 per nine).\n\nThat, no doubt, is the sort of arm fans want to watch fire pitches at the best hitters the National League has to offer at the outset of the All-Star Game.\n\nWhat's fascinating in the Darvish-Iwakuma debate is the coincidence of things.\n\nAs referenced briefly above, both Darvish and Iwakuma hail from Japan, dominated the NPB circuit for several years and then came over to MLB in within a couple weeks of each other.\n\nDarvish, you'll remember, was the big name who got the big pub\u2014and the big money, thanks to the $111 million-plus commitment from the Rangers\u2014whereas Iwakuma was basically an afterthought, especially after he had failed to agree with the Oakland Athletics the previous winter after posting.\n\nAnd here we are, 18 months later, and the All-Star starter debate in the AL may well come down to...Darvish and Iwakuma.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that there's still time.\n\nTime for Iwakuma, Darvish, Hernandez, Sale, as well as any of the others mentioned above\u2014or any other stud AL starters you can think of\u2014to take a few more turns and really make their case for toeing the rubber in the bottom half of the first inning of the All-Star Game next month.\n\nBut as much as he's flown under the radar, both among his countrymen and his teammates, here's hoping Iwakuma gets consideration.\n\nHe deserves it.\n\nAll statistics come from Baseball Reference and FanGraphs; WAR statistics come from FanGraphs."}, {"url": "https://www.thescore.com/mlb/news/1603785", "page_content": "With his attempted major-league comeback from injury hitting a bit of a snag, longtime Seattle Mariners pitcher Hisashi Iwakuma has decided to head back home.\n\nThe Mariners announced Wednesday that Iwakuma - who hasn't pitched in the big leagues since last season due to a shoulder injury - has decided to abandon his comeback attempt and leave the organization after seven years, putting an end to his Major League Baseball career.\n\nPer the team, the 37-year-old Iwakuma plans to continue pitching in his native Japan, where he starred for 11 years before jumping across the Pacific in 2012. The Mariners were his only MLB team.\n\n\"(MLB is) a very tough league to compete in,\" Iwakuma said. \"Obviously, we all know that I came here to challenge how much I could do here. It worked out very well for me and being able to wear a Mariners uniform for 7 years, that's something special for me.\"\n\nIwakuma had re-signed with the Mariners on a minor-league deal over the winter only a few months after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder. While Seattle hoped the pitcher would be able to join the rotation at some point this year, Iwakuma's 2018 season ultimately consisted of two rehab appearances with Class-A Everett last month.\n\nBefore injuring his shoulder in 2016, Iwakuma was a mainstay in Seattle's rotation for five seasons, and was named an American League All-Star in 2013. The highlight of his MLB career undoubtedly came on Aug. 12, 2015, when he no-hit the Baltimore Orioles at Safeco Field.\n\nIwakuma ends his big-league career having compiled a 63-39 record with a 3.42 ERA, 714 strikeouts, and 185 walks over 883 2/3 innings. His 1.14 WHIP ranks as the lowest in Mariners franchise history."}, {"url": "https://www.mlb.com/news/seattle-mariners-pitchers-felix-hernandez-hisashi-iwakuma-selected-to-all-star-game/c-52928696", "page_content": "SEATTLE -- Felix Hernandez earned his third straight American League All-Star bid and fourth overall on Saturday and this time \"The King\" will have some company as teammate Hisashi Iwakuma also was selected for the July 16 game in New York.\n\nHernandez has been the Mariners' lone All-Star representative the past two years, but Iwakuma also had his name called during Saturday's MLB All-Star Selection Show presented by Taco Bell after an outstanding first half.\n\nMariners manager Eric Wedge informed Hernandez and Iwakuma of their All-Star nods in a team meeting before Saturday's game against the Reds.\n\n\"The guys were really excited for both of them, but they've been down this road with Felix before,\" Wedge said. \"For Kuma, it was a pretty neat experience. It was just nice to see how genuine their teammates were and excited for them, so that was a neat thing to be a small part of.\"\n\nHernandez said he plans to actually pitch in the game this year, as the past two seasons he didn't participate after throwing for Seattle on the final regular-season game before the break.\n\nIwakuma likely faces that fate this year as he's scheduled to throw his final start before the break on Sunday, July 14 against the Angels at Safeco Field. Hernandez is scheduled to start the prior game against the Angels, giving him an extra day of rest.\n\n\"It's unfortunate not being able to pitch,\" Iwakuma said through translator Antony Suzuki. \"But then at the same time, you want to enjoy every moment being an All-Star -- enjoy the atmosphere.\"\n\nIwakuma was a three-time All-Star in Japan, but this is his first Major League selection after signing with Seattle last season.\n\nHernandez wasn't selected for the team in 2010, when he went on to win the AL Cy Young Award. He pitched one perfect inning in his first trip in 2009 in St. Louis, needing just seven pitches to set down Orlando Hudson, Albert Pujols and Justin Upton, but otherwise has been limited to a sideline role at the game.\n\nIn 2011, MLB rules precluded pitchers who threw on the final Sunday before the game to participate. Last year, the rules were changed to allow participation, but Rangers manager Ron Washington elected not to use Hernandez in the game after he'd thrown 113 pitches in a complete-game outing on the last day before the break against the A's.\n\nHernandez, who signed a seven-year, $175 million contract extension this spring, has again been one of the AL's premier starters as he's posted an 8-4 record with a 2.69 ERA in 18 games with 130 strikeouts and 24 walks in 123 2/3 innings. Although this will be his fourth appearance, Hernandez was still honored by the selection.\n\n\"It's always exciting,\" Hernandez said. \"To be a part of the All-Star Game with all those guys, it's always fun.\"\n\nHernandez threw his first perfect game last season and since '09 has the second-lowest ERA in the Majors behind only Clayton Kershaw and the second-most strikeouts and games pitched behind Justin Verlander.\n\nOnly four Mariners have been selected to more All-Star Games in franchise history: Ichiro Suzuki and Ken Griffey Jr. at 10 each, Edgar Martinez with seven and Randy Johnson with five. Alex Rodriguez earned four All-Star berths while with Seattle.\n\nIwakuma and Hernandez rank 1-2 in the AL in ERA, with Iwakuma leading the way with his 2.60 mark in 18 starts. The 32-year-old from Japan has posted a 7-4 record and has the lowest WHIP (walks plus hits per inning) at 0.88.\n\nWedge referred to his All-Star pitching duo as \"masters of consistency.\"\n\n\"You just feel good when they go out there,\" he said. \"That's how you want to get with all your guys, but you know that they're going to be consistent. More times than not, they're not going to beat themselves. And they're very different in regards to how they pitch and what they do, but they've both gotten to the point where they've mastered what they do.\"\n\nIwakuma has struck out 103 batters with just 18 walks in 121 1/3 innings. He began last year in long relief in his first experience in the Majors, but he's gone 15-7 with a 2.62 ERA in 33 starts since moving into the Mariners' rotation on July 2, 2012.\n\nIwakuma has the lowest ERA among all AL pitchers with at least 15 starts since last year's All-Star break at 2.56, with Boston's Clay Buchholz second at 2.83 and teammate Hernandez third at 2.84.\n\nThe Mariners haven't had a position player in the All-Star Game since 2010, the last of Suzuki's 10 consecutive appearances in the Midsummer Classic. Seattle sent three pitchers in 2011 -- Hernandez, Michael Pineda and Brandon League -- and Hernandez was the team's lone representative the past two years.\n\nFor Iwakuma, who said he is looking forward to learning from his peers in New York, his first All-Star appearance was made even better by the fact he'll be joined by Hernandez.\n\n\"There is a special feeling with that because we've fought together, one and two,\" Iwakuma said. \"And we've gone through a lot of challenges together already.

The shoulder was found to have some structural damage, which is especially troubling for a player approaching his 37th birthday. Iwakuma's peripherals had been in steady decline in recent seasons, with his once-elite walk rate more than tripling since 2014 (from 1.1 BB/9 to 3.5). Meanwhile, his strikeout rate has fallen from an already-modest level, down to just 4.7 K/9 in the abbreviated sample last season, and his home-run rate has gradually ticked up (to 2.03 HR/9). Prime Iwakuma wouldn't have been worth stashing for two months, and this lesser version certainly isn't, so he should be left for the waiver wire in nearly all leagues to begin the season. He agreed to return to the Mariners on a minor-league deal after the team declined his $10 million option.\n\nHe signed with the Mariners amid whispers that his throwing shoulder was compromised, and though Iwakuma posted the highest ERA of his MLB tenure in 2016, he also pitched 199 innings -- the second-highest total of his five years in the bigs. His fastball lost another half-tick of velocity while the strikeouts dropped from the steady 21.5 percent of the previous three seasons to a mere 17.6 percent. Strikeouts were never a big part of Iwakuma's value proposition in fantasy, but he maintained his stinginess for walks last season and the baseline skills are largely intact from the pitcher that was a plus in the WHIP category for three years. The Mariners were also careful with his workload, capping him at 102 or fewer pitches in every start, and there is little reason to expect that to change, so he needs to be efficient with pitch counts in order to get through the sixth inning. Treat Iwakuma as a low-upside source of innings and wins late in drafts.\n\nA blindspot in the fantasy world is understanding the residual effects of injuries. Too often we as a community think that if a player is on the field, he is healthy, but injuries can have an impact beyond the DL time. That has been the case with Iwakuma over the last two seasons as finger and lat injuries have cost him chunks of each season and likely played a role in the increased ERA when he was on the mound. In his excellent 2013 campaign, we saw the very best of Iwakuma as he maximized his skill set for 33 starts. In his 48 starts since, the base skills are actually better (6.3 K/BB compared to 4.4 in 2013), but the smaller samples have shrunk his margin for error and his off-days have hit the bottom line harder. In 2013, he allowed five or more earned runs in a start just three times. He\u2019s had eight such starts the last two seasons. With his return to Seattle during the offseason, you should pay for the premium WHIP that he can provide.\n\nIwakuma missed the first month of the season last year with a finger injury, but when he returned it was business as usual. Iwakuma dominates with impeccable control. His 1.1 BB/9 was second in baseball and his 7.3 K/BB was third. Groin and back injuries and fatigue knocked him off his game down the stretch, however. In his last seven starts, he was rocked for a 7.88 ERA, and he walked nine in that stretch, only three fewer than he had walked in his previous 21 starts. Despite the ugly finish, Iwakuma's FIP was 3.32. He returns this season to take his place as the second starter in the rotation behind Felix Hernandez, giving the Mariners an excellent one-two punch.\n\nA strong finish to the 2012 campaign springboarded Iwakuma into 2013 where he dominated from start to finish. Iwakuma finished second in the AL in WHIP, third in ERA, BB/9, BAA and innings, and fourth in K/BB. Had it not been for Max Scherzer's dream season, he might have won the Cy Young award. As it was, he finished third in the AL voting. A groundball pitcher, Iwakuma has a solid strikeout rate (7.6 K/9) with great control (1.7 BB/9). He went through a summer stretch where his ERA peaked over 3.00, but he straightened out by posting a 2.14 ERA over his final 13 starts, including scoreless outings in four of his last five for another strong finish to the season. Iwakuma proved one of the best fantasy values last season, considering his average draft position. He won't be as profitable this year \u2013 and it could go the other way \u2013 but he should still turn in another quality season.\n\nIt's not often a player goes from a complete non-factor to a $14 million contract in six months, but that was Iwakuma's fate in 2012. Iwakuma signed with Seattle out of Japan as a starting pitcher but was relegated to the bullpen to begin the season. It took 15 games for him to see his first action, and by June 1 - 54 games into the season - he had made just five appearances, mostly in low-leverage long-relief situations. He finally got his chance to start, though, in July, when the Mariners jettisoned Hector Noesi, and he more than held his own. He has good control (2.65 BB/9) and a decent strikeout rate (7.39), posting a 2.65 ERA in 16 starts. While his season home/road split is stark, as a starter he fared much better (2.56/2.80 ERA, .243/.254 BAA), and as a groundball pitcher (65.4 percent) he shouldn't be impacted by Safeco Field's reconfiguration this season. In addition to his two-year contract signed shortly after the season ended, Iwakuma enters spring training with a rotation spot locked up and looks like a good fantasy value this season.\n\nIwakuma is considered to be Japan's best pitcher behind Yu Darvish and signed a one-year deal with the Mariners after becoming an international free agent. He tried to move to MLB last season but he wasn't able to agree to a contract with Oakland after the A's won his rights via the posting system. Iwakuma posted a somewhat disappointing season in 2011, with his 2.42 ERA tempered by a 6-7 record over only 119 innings pitched. He missed two months last season with a shoulder ailment, but returned in July and remained in his team's rotation through the remainder of the season. When he's on his game, Iwakuma has proven capable of using his forkball to generate plenty of swinging strikes and groundballs against NPB competition. The key to his MLB success will be continuing to command his forkball with the slightly different Major League baseball. Iwakuma doesn't have a great strikeout rate (just 6.8 K/9IP last season), but could provide quality innings as Seattle's No. 3 or 4 starter.\n\nIwakuma was made available via the posting system by his team, the Rakuten Golden Eagles, and Oakland won the negotiating rights to the Japanese star with a bid reportedly in the $19 million range. After an apparently contentious series of negotiations, the two sides were unable to work out a deal, so Iwakuma will remain with Rakuten and the A's got their money back. Iwakuma will meet the service time requirements for international free agency early in 2011, and has already announced plans to move over to MLB. The groundballer had a very good year in 2010 with a 2.82 ERA and 1.095 WHIP in 201 innings pitched. He's considered to be Japan's best pitching prospect behind Yu Darvish, so he's one to keep an eye on with 2012 in mind."}, {"url": "https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Hisashi%20Iwakuma", "page_content": "Hisashi Iwakuma (\u5ca9\u9688 \u4e45\u5fd7)\n\nBats Right, Throws Right\n\nRight, Right Height 6' 3\", Weight 210 lb.\n\n6' 3\", 210 lb.

He is the son-in-law of Koju Hirohashi.\n\nIwakuma was the 5th-round pick of the Kintetsu Buffaloes in the 2000 NPB draft. Spending most of his rookie year in the minors, he joined the team's rotation in '02, going 8-7 with a 3.69 ERA. In 2003 Iwakuma established himself as Kintetsu's ace, going 15-10 with a 3.45 ERA. He was sixth in the Pacific League in ERA and fourth in wins despite playing on a fifth-place team. Iwakuma did even better in '04, with a 15-2, 3.01 season. He led the PL in wins, was second to Daisuke Matsuzaka in ERA and didn't suffer a defeat till after the All-Star Game (starting off the year 12-0). The rest of the Kintetsu staff went 46-68 during the year.\n\nIwakuma received even more fame after the 2004 season. When the Buffaloes announced a merger with the Orix Blue Wave, Kintetsu's ace said he would not play for the new team. The merged Orix Buffaloes selected him in a draft of the former Buffalo and Blue Wave players, but Iwakuma continued his refusals. The usually-docile players' union threw their weight behind Iwakuma and the Buffaloes relented, letting Iwakuma go to the expansion Rakuten Golden Eagles instead.\n\nIwakuma's first season with Rakuten paled statistically in comparison with his last Kintetsu season. He was clearly the ace of the new squad though - his 4.99 ERA was the best by a starter and his 9-15 record gave him more wins than the next two pitchers combined. He also threw half of the team's 18 complete games. Hisashi did not pitch much in 2006, going 1-2 with a 3.72 ERA in six games. Shoulder injuries and new rules about pitch deliveries limited his effectiveness and playing time.\n\nIwakuma went 5-5 with a 3.40 ERA in 2007. After his three ineffective seasons from 2005-2007, Iwakuma turned things around in a big way in 2008. He went 21-4 with a 1.87 ERA. He edged Yu Darvish by .01 for the PL lead in ERA, led the league in innings (201 2/3), was third with 159 strikeouts (trailing Toshiya Sugiuchi and Darvish) and tied for second with two shutouts. That earned him Pacific League MVP honors. He became just the third MVP in Nippon Pro Baseball history from a 5th-place team, following Hiromitsu Ochiai (1982) and Hiromitsu Kadota (1988. Iwakuma also won the Sawamura Award as the best pitcher in Japan. No one had won 21 games in a NPB season since Yoshinori Sato in 1985.\n\nIwakuma pitched for the Japanese national team in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. He went 1-1 with a 1.35 ERA, allowing only 12 hits in 20 innings while striking out 15. He lost a 1-0 duel to Jung-keun Bong of South Korea, giving up a 4th-inning run on a walk to Jong-wook Lee and hits by Keun-woo Jeong and Tae-kyun Kim. He tossed a scoreless 7th inning in a win over Cuba. Iwakuma started the second game against Cuba, a make-or-break game; he tossed only 69 pitches in six shutout innings before Toshiya Sugiuchi completed the whitewash. It was the earliest Cuba had ever been eliminated from a major baseball tournament. Iwakuma then got the call from Tatsunori Hara to start the finale against South Korea. He allowed only one run in the first 7 innings (a homer by Shin-soo Choo) before giving up a second score in the 8th; he left with a 3-2 lead but Yu Darvish blew the save. Japan went on to win in the 10th. Iwakuma led the tournament in innings (20) and was second to Darvish in strikeouts. He made the All-Tournament team alongside fellow pitchers Daisuke Matsuzaka and Bong. Matsuzaka beat him out for MVP honors, but said that Iwakuma deserved them more.\n\nIwakuma fell to 13-6, 3.25 in 2009. He was 7th in the PL in ERA (between D.J. Houlton and Takayuki Kishi), tied for 5th in wins (with Kishi and Satoshi Nagai) and allowed a league-worst 179 hits. He rebounded a bit at 10-9, 2.82 in 2010, finishing 4th in ERA behind Darvish, Masaru Takeda and Masahiro Tanaka. He was 4th in innings (201), was 7th in losses, tied Chihiro Kaneko for second with 184 hits allowed (only Hideaki Wakui was worse), fanned 153 (7th-most) and had a 1.09 WHIP (4th after Darvish, Yoshihisa Naruse and Takeda).\n\nIwakuma with Seattle\n\nFollowing the 2010 season, Iwakuma's name was placed on the posting system by the Golden Eagles. The Oakland Athletics posted the highest bid to secure the right to negotiate a major league contract with him. Iwakuma turned down a 4-year, $15,250,000 offer from Oakland and opted to remain with Rakuten. He missed part of the season with a shoulder injury, being sidelined from May 18th to July 26th. He had been 3-2, 1.72 in 6 starts before the injury, and went 3-5, 2.87 after his return. He became a free agent after the season, and this time truly made the jump across the Pacific Ocean, signing with the Seattle Mariners. Surprisingly, he only agreed to a one-year contract worth $1.5 million, with potential performance bonuses of $3.4 million, much less than what he had turned down a year earlier. However, he explained that having a good relationship with a team - something he had not felt with Oakland - was more important than the money. He added that he and his family had taken an immediate liking to the city of Seattle and that he was looking forward to being a teammate of the great Ichiro Suzuki.\n\nIwakuma's time in the major leagues did not start off well. He pitched poorly during the Mariners' spring training in 2012, forcing the hand of manager Eric Wedge who announced he would not be part of the team's starting rotation to start the season. The plan was to use him in the bullpen to allow him to build back strength in his shoulder. Thus, he was on the M's special 28-man roster for their season-opening series against the Oakland Athletics in his native Japan, but in one of three spots designated as being ineligible to play during the Series, even though he made the trip across the Pacific Ocean. It took him until April 20th to make his debut, when he pitched four innings in relief of Hector Noesi and Erasmo Ramirez in a game against the Chicago White Sox. He was outstanding, only giving up a single hit during his stint; it was a solo homer by Adam Dunn, although it made little difference in the final 7-3 score in favor of the White Sox. He was the last player from all 30 teams' opening day rosters to make his season debut. He won his first game as a starter on July 30th, beating the Toronto Blue Jays, 4-1. In that game, he set a Mariners rookie record with 13 strikeouts, after surrendering a leadoff homer to Rajai Davis to start the game. He settled down nicely after that rough start, giving up no more runs in completing 8 innings, before turning the ball to Josh Kinney. He had been inserted in the starting rotation just before the All-Star break, but had had to fly back to Japan to be at the side of his ill father only a few days before. He ended the season with a record of 9-5, 3.16, in 30 games, with 16 starts, pitching 125 1/3 innings and striking out 101.\n\nIwakuma started the 2013 season as one of the best pitchers in the major leagues, placing his name among the ERA leaders from the start. He had a scoreless string of 23 2/3 innings in June, only broken by an unearned run allowed to the Houston Astros on June 10th, in a game he won, 3-2. That win improved his record to 7-1 and lowered his ERA to 1.79, trailing only Clay Buchholz's 1.71 at that point of the season. He finished the year at a very solid 14-6, 2.66 with a 1.01 WHIP and 185 K in 219 2/3 IP. He was chosen for the 2013 All-Star Game but did not play due to the Sunday starter rule; Chris Tillman replaced him. He finished among the 2013 AL leaders in ERA (3rd behind Anibal Sanchez and Bartolo Colon), wins (tied for 8th), WHIP (2nd to Max Scherzer), fewest hits per 9 IP (4th behind fellow ex-PL star Darvish, Scherzer and Justin Masterson), fewest walks per 9 (3rd behind David Price and Colon), innings (3rd behind James Shields and R.A. Dickey) and ERA+ (138, 6th, between Chris Sale and Shields). He was third in voting for the 2013 AL Cy Young Award, behind Scherzer and Darvish.\n\nPreparing for spring training in 2014, Iwakuma injured a finger while working out in southern California in January. He showed up in camp wearing a splint due to a strained tendon and had to lay off throwing for a month. The Mariners then announced that as a result, he would not be ready for the start of the season. As a result, he only made his first start on May 3rd, then had back-to-back starts of 8 innings without allowing a run in his second and third outings of the season. After a couple of games in which he was touched for 9 runs in 15 innings and suffered two losses, he bounced back with a gem on June 4th when he shut out the Atlanta Braves for seven innings, combining with two relievers for a 2-0 win. He ended the season with an excellent record of 15-9, 3.52 in 28 starts, and 154 Ks in 179 innings. He tied for 8th in the 2014 AL in wins, was 4th in WHIP (behind teammate Felix Hernandez, Sale and Garrett Richards), was second in walk rate (behind Phil Hughes) and was second in K:BB ratio (also behind Hughes).The Mariners were hoping to take a step forward in 2015 and were counting on Hisashi as one of the team's pillars, but after making only three starts in April, with a record of 0-1 and a 6.61 ERA, he went on the disabled list and was out until July 6th. he was roughed up in his first start back, allowing 5 runs in as many innings to the Detroit Tigers, increasing his ERA to 7.17, but then began pitching well after that. On August 12th, he threw a no-hitter against the Baltimore Orioles, allowing 3 walks and striking out 7, in what was the first complete game and shutout of his big league career. The Mariners won the game, 3-0, as he improved to 4-2 on the year and lowered his ERA to 3.86. He was the second Japanese-born pitcher to throw a no-hitter, after Hideo Nomo. He finished the season with a record of 9-5, 3.54 in 20 starts, logging 129 2/3 innings.\n\nIwakuma became a free agent after the 2015 season and was sought after by the Los Angeles Dodgers, who were looking to strengthen their starting rotation following the departure of co-ace Zack Greinke through free agency. The two sides came to a preliminary agreement on a three-year contract worth $45 million, but after two weeks of intense negotiations, they were unable to agree on the final details of the deal and the Mariners took advantage of the snag to scoop him up back into the fold, inking him on December 17th to a guaranteed one-year contract with two option years. So back he went to Seattle in 2016, but he started off slowly as by mid-May, he was only 1-4 with a 4.38 ERA in 8 starts. However, he won his last three starts of the month, then after going 2-2 in his first four June starts, began a tremendous streak on June 28th, when he beat the Pittsburgh Pirates, 5-2. Starting with that game, he won 7 of 8 starts, topped off with a 3-0 win over the Detroit Tigers on August 8th in which he tossed 7 shutout innings. The streak improved his record to 13-7 while lowering his ERA to 3.79. He ended the season at 16-12, 4.12.\n\nIn 2017, Iwakuma was set back by injuries and made only 6 starts, going 0-2, 4.35. He underwent major shoulder surgery in September and as a result missed all of 2018 after some setbacks while rehabbing in the minors. At 37, there was some question as to whether he would try to make a comeback. He stated that September that he would likely pursue his career back in Japan.\n\nIn 2021, he returned to the Mariners as a special assignment coach.\n\nNotable Achievements [ edit ]\n\nAL All-Star (2013)\n\n15 Wins Seasons: 2 (2014 & 2016)\n\n200 Innings Pitched Seasons: 1 (2013)\n\nFurther Reading [ edit ]\n\nGreg Johns: \"Iwakuma feels Seattle is right place for him: 'It all worked out,' righty says of Mariners reaching out to him after deal with Dodgers fell through\", mlb.com, December 18, 2015.

He tied for 8th in the 2014 AL in wins, was 4th in WHIP (behind teammate Felix Hernandez, Sale and Garrett Richards), was second in walk rate (behind Phil Hughes) and was second in K:BB ratio (also behind Hughes).The Mariners were hoping to take a step forward in 2015 and were counting on Hisashi as one of the team's pillars, but after making only three starts in April, with a record of 0-1 and a 6.61 ERA, he went on the disabled list and was out until July 6th. he was roughed up in his first start back, allowing 5 runs in as many innings to the Detroit Tigers, increasing his ERA to 7.17, but then began pitching well after that. On August 12th, he threw a no-hitter against the Baltimore Orioles, allowing 3 walks and striking out 7, in what was the first complete game and shutout of his big league career. The Mariners won the game, 3-0, as he improved to 4-2 on the year and lowered his ERA to 3.86. He was the second Japanese-born pitcher to throw a no-hitter, after Hideo Nomo. He finished the season with a record of 9-5, 3.54 in 20 starts, logging 129 2/3 innings.\n\nIwakuma became a free agent after the 2015 season and was sought after by the Los Angeles Dodgers, who were looking to strengthen their starting rotation following the departure of co-ace Zack Greinke through free agency. The two sides came to a preliminary agreement on a three-year contract worth $45 million, but after two weeks of intense negotiations, they were unable to agree on the final details of the deal and the Mariners took advantage of the snag to scoop him up back into the fold, inking him on December 17th to a guaranteed one-year contract with two option years. So back he went to Seattle in 2016, but he started off slowly as by mid-May, he was only 1-4 with a 4.38 ERA in 8 starts. However, he won his last three starts of the month, then after going 2-2 in his first four June starts, began a tremendous streak on June 28th, when he beat the Pittsburgh Pirates, 5-2. Starting with that game, he won 7 of 8 starts, topped off with a 3-0 win over the Detroit Tigers on August 8th in which he tossed 7 shutout innings. The streak improved his record to 13-7 while lowering his ERA to 3.79. He ended the season at 16-12, 4.12.\n\nIn 2017, Iwakuma was set back by injuries and made only 6 starts, going 0-2, 4.35. He underwent major shoulder surgery in September and as a result missed all of 2018 after some setbacks while rehabbing in the minors. At 37, there was some question as to whether he would try to make a comeback. He stated that September that he would likely pursue his career back in Japan.\n\nIn 2021, he returned to the Mariners as a special assignment coach.\n\nNotable Achievements [ edit ]\n\nAL All-Star (2013)\n\n15 Wins Seasons: 2 (2014 & 2016)\n\n200 Innings Pitched Seasons: 1 (2013)\n\nFurther Reading [ edit ]\n\nGreg Johns: \"Iwakuma feels Seattle is right place for him: 'It all worked out,' righty says of Mariners reaching out to him after deal with Dodgers fell through\", mlb.com, December 18, 2015.

Beyond signing Iwakuma in 2012, the club successfully signed Ichiro Suzuki in \u201800 and Kikuchi in \u201819, and it was believed to be the runner-up for Shohei Ohtani in \u201917.\n\n\n\nIwakuma was among Japan\u2019s top pitchers before joining Seattle as an international free agent in 2012, having won the Pacific League MVP Award in \u201908. The right-hander retired from professional baseball in October after experiencing prolonged shoulder injuries, an issue that dated back to when he first signed with Seattle ahead of his age-31 season. His final appearances as a professional came for the Yomiuri Giants in '19.\n\n\n\nBut when healthy, Iwakuma was one of the Mariners\u2019 most effective pitchers over his six seasons in Seattle (2012-17), going 63-39 with a 3.42 ERA in 150 games, including 136 starts. The \u201813 All-Star\u2019s career ERA is tied for the lowest in club history (min. 500 innings) with Randy Johnson, Felix Hernandez and James Paxton. He was voted the most valuable Mariners pitcher in \u201913 and \u201916 by the Seattle chapter of the Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America, and he was a finalist for the AL Cy Young Award in \u201913.\n\n\n\nIwakuma is most immortalized for throwing the fifth no-hitter in club history on Aug. 12, 2015, against Baltimore, when he joined Hideo Nomo as just the second Japanese-born pitcher to throw a no-no in the Majors.\",\"type\":\"text\"}],\"contentType\":\"news\",\"subHeadline\":null,\"summary\":\"SEATTLE -- The Mariners are bringing back a familiar face, as the club announced Tuesday that it has hired former pitcher Hisashi Iwakuma as a special assignment coach.

He's now 14-6 with a 2.66 ERA.\n\nEric Karabell calls Iwakuma his fantasy MVP among pitchers, but that's factoring in Iwakuma's relatively low average draft position. Eric's also right about this: Max Scherzer will probably win the award easily thanks to his sterling 21-3 record.\n\nBut whether Scherzer should be a lock is no longer such a sure thing.\n\nIwakuma ranks third in the AL in ERA (just behind the 2.64 marks of Bartolo Colon and Anibal Sanchez, both of whom have pitched far fewer innings), second to James Shields in innings pitched, second to Scherzer in opponents' OBP, third to Yu Darvish and Scherzer in batting average allowed and fourth in strikeout/walk ratio behind David Price, Chris Sale and Felix Hernandez.\n\nIn terms of Baseball-Reference WAR, however, it's not a two-pitcher race but a three-pitcher one:\n\nSale: 7.2 WAR (11-13, 2.97 ERA)\n\nIwakuma: 7.0 WAR (14-6, 2.66 ERA)\n\nScherzer: 6.7 WAR (21-3, 2.90 ERA)\n\nThe raw totals are close: Sale has allowed 77 runs in 209 innings, Iwakuma has allowed 69 in 219 2/3 and Scherzer has allowed 73 in 214 1/3. The statistical edge Sale and Scherzer have over Iwakuma is strikeouts -- 240 for Scherzer, 221 for Sale, 185 for Iwakuma.\n\n(For the record, Iwakuma is rated much lower via FanGraphs WAR, which focuses on strikeouts, walks and home runs as opposed to actual run prevention. Scherzer, however, has pitched slightly worse with runners on base, or at least had worse results, than Iwakuma. For example, Iwakuma has allowed 25 home runs, but 19 have been solo shots. He's allowed a .228 average with the bases empty but .184 with runners in scoring position. Scherzer has allowed a .186 average with the bases empty versus .223 with runners in scoring position.)\n\nOne thing I like to look at is starts allowing two runs or fewer. You should win most of those starts; allow three and it's more of a 50-50 proposition; allow four or more, and you rarely win (only three pitchers have won at least four games this year when they allowed four-plus runs and only five, including Scherzer, have won three).\n\n<!-poll1-->Record when allowing two runs or fewer:\n\nScherzer: 20 starts, 15-1, four no-decisions, 1.61 ERA\n\nSale: 14 starts, 9-3, two no-decisions, 0.98 ERA\n\nIwakuma: 20 starts, 12-1, seven no-decisions, 0.97 ERA\n\nIwakuma has pitched better than Scherzer in his good starts yet has three fewer wins. In fact, he's had four no-decisions when allowing zero runs. (All three pitchers have had seven starts allowing four runs or more.)\n\nSo yes, Scherzer has had better run support. Really, you can dissect this a lot of ways and all three are pretty even. But I suspect if you put Scherzer on the Mariners, we wouldn't be talking about a landslide Cy Young vote.\n\n(For the record, I'd probably go Scherzer, Iwakuma, Sale, Darvish and Hernandez on my five-pitcher ballot. But maybe that's the Mariners fan in me not trying to be biased.)"}, {"url": "https://thisgreatgame.com/seattle-mariners-top-5-pitchers/", "page_content": "Felix Hernandez (2005-19)\n\nThe hefty (6\u20193\u201d, 225 lbs.) right-hander became an instant ace for the Mariners upon his debut at 19 midway through the 2005 season, becoming the first teenager to win a major league game in over two decades, not allowing an extra-base hit through his first 30.2 innings, and taking a no-hitter into the seventh inning in a late-season game at Toronto. It didn\u2019t take long for Mariners fans to anoint him as King Felix.\n\nHighly sought in the majors in his native Venezuela, Hernandez signed with the Mariners at age 16, rejecting higher bids from other clubs (including the New York Yankees) because his idol was then-current Mariners pitcher and fellow Venezuelan Freddy Garcia. After his impressive rookie debut, Hernandez slumbered in 2006 to a 12-14 record and subpar 4.52 ERA, suggesting that some additional growing up was needed; gradually that occurred, as his numbers continued to improve with each passing year. By 2009, he was a legitimate Cy Young Award candidate with a league-high 19 wins (against just five losses) and a sharp 2.49 ERA. A year later, he won the award with a stellar 2.27 mark despite an average 13-12 record\u2014a reflection of the awful support he received from an inept Mariners offense. It was also a fact realized by voters who, in an earlier time when analytics weren\u2019t highly embraced to determine a player\u2019s genuine contribution, would not have given him the honor.\n\nIn 2014, Hernandez copped his second ERA title with a career-best 2.14 mark, thanks in part to the help of a scoring review that converted four earned runs he allowed in his next-to-last start into unearned tallies to give him a slim edge over the White Sox\u2019 Chris Sale. (He barely lost out on receiving his second Cy, as Cleveland\u2019s Corey Kluber managed a few more votes.)\n\nThe Mariners latched onto Hernandez\u2019s popularity by naming Section 150 at Safeco Field King Felix\u2019s Court; spectators there were given yellow T-shirts, foam crowns and yellow \u201cK\u201d cards to hoist when Hernandez pitched. The Court was rewarded on August 15, 2012 when Hernandez threw the Mariners\u2019 first-ever perfect game, retiring all 27 Tampa Bay batters he faced.\n\nHernandez provided a more unexpected highlight with the bat during a 2008 interleague contest against the Mets at New York when, in his only official at-bat of the year, he hit a grand slam. It was the first slam hit by an AL pitcher since 1971, and the first home run in general ever hit by a Mariners pitcher.\n\nIn 2016, Hernandez, became the Mariners\u2019 all-time leader in wins and strikeouts; he held the top spot on the ERA list until his final season at Seattle, when years of wear and tear finally exhausted his greatness.\n\nRandy Johnson (1989-98)\n\nRandy Johnson (1989-98)\n\nIn 1989, the lowly Mariners brought in Ken Griffey Jr. to anchor their offense for years to come. It would also be the same year they would discover their ace for the next decade in the tall, intense southpaw from California nicknamed The Big Unit.\n\nBrought to Seattle in a midseason trade that sent Mariners star pitcher Mark Langston to Montreal, Johnson came with a wicked fastball often timed up to 100 MPH and delivered with long arms in a wild, flailing pitching motion that would lead umpire Durwood Merrill to describe him as a \u201cbig hairy half-tarantula.\u201d But as with the Expos, Johnson was wild, easily leading the American League in walks over each of his first three full years with the Mariners\u2014issuing a career-high 152 in 1991\u2014leaving him as nothing more than a sensational .500 pitcher with the occasional burst of greatness, such as his first of two career no-hitters in 1990 (walking six, naturally).\n\nThat changed once Johnson mastered a hard slider to go with his blazing fastball; opposing batters previously intimidated by his wildness now feared him in other ways as the walks decreased, the strikeouts increased, the earned run averages shrank and the wins began piling up. Starting in 1993, Johnson began a five-year stretch in which he was 75-20, led the AL thrice in strikeouts (including 308 K\u2019s in 1993), won an ERA title with a 2.48 mark in 1995 (on a superlative 18-2 mark to win his first Cy Young Award) and captured his first 20-win effort in 1997, losing just four games with a 2.28 ERA that would be the lowest of his career. Johnson represented the Mariners in four All-Star Games, starting two\u2014and was well remembered in 1993 for throwing a heater three feet over the head of Philadelphia\u2019s John Kruk, who couldn\u2019t help but smile and repeatedly tug at his shirt to pantomime a beating heart.\n\nWith a year left before free agency in 1998, Johnson expressed his displeasure when he heard the Mariners weren\u2019t going to resign him; the lame duck status affected him, winning just nine of 19 decisions with a 4.33 ERA. Dealt away at the trading deadline to Houston, the Big Unit had a sensational short tenure with the Astros, going 10-1 with a 1.28 ERA before signing on with Arizona and winning four more Cys\u2014and a World Series, in 2001\u2014for the Diamondbacks, on his way to a lifetime 303-166 record and a place in Cooperstown.\n\nJamie Moyer (1996-2006)\n\nJamie Moyer (1996-2006)\n\nAfter a 10-year struggle to find solid footing as he led a journeyman existence playing for five different teams, the left-handed Moyer came to Seattle, refined his pitching repertoire and found both stability and success for the next decade\u2014producing a 145-87 mark for the Mariners that included his only two 20-win campaigns.\n\nOn the radar gun, Moyer was never to be confused with Johnson as he threw a fastball that rarely reached 90 MPH. But the left-hander developed a tremendous change-up considered one of the most effective ever, causing as much headaches for right-handed batters (who typically hit lefties better) as those who hit left. Debunking perception even further, Moyer pitched no worse for the Mariners in the Kingdome (embraced by hitters) than at pitching-friendly Safeco Field after the team\u2019s 1999 relocation there.\n\nMoyer won 20 games for the first time in 2001, at the age of 38\u2014adding another three victories without a loss in the Mariners\u2019 otherwise unsuccessful bid to secure their first AL flag following a 116-46 season. Two years later, Moyer reached 20 again\u2014becoming the fifth pitcher, after Hall of Famers Cy Young, Pete Alexander, Warren Spahn and Phil Niekro, to reach the milestone after turning 40. A year later in 2004, Moyer finally had his first losing season with the Mariners\u2014allowing a major league-worst 44 home runs, a dubious apex in a career in which he would later set the all-time mark for most career blasts allowed at 522. In 2006, Moyer was traded in midseason to the Phillies, and his career lasted all the way to the age of 49 when he finally ran out of gas for the Colorado Rockies."}]}
