USA are in the middle of the Vietnam War, Martin Luther King has recently marched from Selma to Montgomery and Roger Miller\u2019s \u2018King of the Road\u2019 is number one. Thirteen bikers meet on the corner of Eighth and Davidson in San Bernardino, California to form the Vagos Motorcycle Club, beginning a history that would involve drug trafficking, clashes with the police and a violent rivalry with the Hells Angels.\n\nThe elected president was Rudy Esparza, nicknamed Puro, who led the new club in selecting their name. Other names considered included Coffin Dogers MC and Satan\u2019s Saints MC, but Vagos MC, Spanish for vagabond, was chosen. Their new patch, a red devil on a green background, was inspired by an image of a devil in LIFE magazine entitled \u2018Return from hell.\u2019\n\nMore Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs (OMGs) were established in the 1960s than in any other decade. The outlaw status is given to groups who are not sanctioned by the American Motorcyclists Association (AMA). They are also known as 1%ers, a term which originated after the Hollister biker riot in 1947 when the AMA allegedly claimed the 99% of bikers were law abiding citizens, although the AMA have no record of issuing this as an official or public statement.\n\nBikers would often move between clubs or find their club being absorbed into a larger club. Puro had previously been with the Psychos MC and others joined from clubs including El Diablo MC. The question of whether the Vagos would absorb or be absorbed was very quickly answered as more Chapters sprang up across California. In 2014 the FBI listed the Vagos as one of the largest Outlaw Motorcycle Groups in Western America with 600 members in 24 Chapters throughout America, as well as Chapters in Canada, Mexico and Europe.\n\nThe Mafia on wheels?\n\nDescribed by Vagos infiltrator Charles Falco as \u201cthe mafia on wheels\u201d the Vagos have more than earned their 1%er patch. Drug related arrests have been made throughout their colourful history. In 1987 the head of the South Bay Chapter and President of the Desert Hot Springs Chapter along with three others all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute methamphetamines. Over 40 pounds of cocaine and eight pounds of methamphetamines (and a rocket launcher!) were seized in a 2011 raid. And in 2014 four Vagos members were arrested by the FBI for selling methamphetamines.\n\nAlongside money laundering and weapons trafficking, the Vagos are also known for their general violence, especially with rival OMGs. As the Vagos attempted to expand their territory tension erupted between them and other OMGs most notably the Hells Angels. In 2001 a bloody melee broke out between the Vagos and the Angels in the Californian city of Costa Mesa. And in 2010 an argument over which gang got to hang out in the Starbucks in Santa Cruz escalated. A brawl outside the coffee shop led to a gunfight in Chino Valley, several drive by shootings and a bitter feud.\n\nThe authorities have successfully infiltrated the Vagos a number of times. George Rowe, a street criminal whose friend had disappeared after an incident with the Vagos, volunteered to go undercover as part of Operation 22 in 2003. His evidence gathered over 3 years resulted in 42 arrests and convictions for crimes as serious as murder. Whilst Charles Falco worked his way up to number two of the Victorville Chapter and provided the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) gathering enough information to make 62 arrests for crimes including assault and murder. Fun fact, both Rowe and Falco have written books about their experiences and actually appear as characters in each other\u2019s books.\n\nHowever the Vagos have their own weapon in their ongoing battle with the police- the lawsuit. In 1990 the Vagos sued the police and received a $2 million settlement claiming they were targets of massive police abuse in the early eighties. And in 2010 when the Vagos were blamed for a spree of homemade booby traps that targeted the police, they once again sued and received a settlement that included a public statement and the return of property seized the previous year.\n\n1%ers\n\nAs with all criminal groups the Vagos don\u2019t advertise their more notorious crimes. Their PR website vagosmcworld.com, presents them as a club rather than a gang. Their consistent response to arrests is that it is not all of their members committing crimes, but a few bad apples. So, organised crime syndicate or a club where just 1% of the 1%ers are giving them a bad name\u2026?"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/hells-angels-vagos-shooting-vegas-motorcycles-8749ff62558bc897bdd75661688eb6c7", "page_content": "FILE - Richard Devries, 66, makes his initial court appearances in Henderson Justice Court Thursday, June 2, 2022, in Henderson, Nev.

Her ruling followed a March 31 hearing with attorneys and defendants in the case.\n\nAttorney Richard Schonfeld, representing Devries, said Monday he was pleased the judge \u201cgranted important aspects of my motion.\u201d He had argued that the indictment was too broad and should be dismissed or revised.\n\nProsecutors Michael Dickerson and Michael Allmon said they were looking at the ruling and declined immediate comment. They could appeal Jones\u2019 decision to the Nevada Supreme Court.\n\nAttorneys for the other defendants did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nDevries and the men identified as Hells Angels members or associates \u2014 Russell Smith, Stephen Alo, Cameron Treich, Taylor Rodriguez, Aaron Chun and Rayann Mollasgo \u2014 still face prosecution on charges including attempted murder, conspiracy to commit murder, battery and assault with weapons. Each has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Each could face up to 40 years in prison if convicted of attempted murder with a weapon.\n\nThe judge instructed prosecutors to revise the indictment. A hearing in the case remained scheduled Wednesday.\n\nPolice said seven people were treated at hospitals for wounds or injuries following the gunfire that erupted among motorcycle riders on Interstate 11 in Henderson after a Memorial Day weekend ceremony at a veterans cemetery in Boulder City.\n\nSchonfeld argued March 31 that Mollasgo, a Hells Angels associate but not a full member, was treated for a gunshot wound, and that police at the scene examined handguns that some of the alleged Vagos had with them, but returned them.\n\n\u201cThe grand jury doesn\u2019t know that a Hells Angels-affiliated individual (was) shot and that four Vagos members had firearms concealed on their person,\u201d Schonfeld said. He argued that prosecutors failed to present \u201dexculpatory evidence\u201d that might cast doubt on the charges they were seeking.\n\nFour motorcycles had gunshot damage, according to evidence, and police found 25 bullet casings on the freeway near where the gunfire took place. Schonfeld told the judge the indictment did not specify what person was alleged to have fired which shots, or which bullets hit which motorcycle.\n\nMollasgo\u2019s lawyer, Augustus Claus, told Jones that his client had become a member of the Hells Angels chapter less than a week before the shooting, but he was accused of a conspiracy with other members dating to 2019.\n\nSchonfeld and Tom Pitaro, attorney representing defendants Russell Smith and Stephen Alo, told the judge that prosecutors never presented evidence that their clients had any intent or agreement to commit a crime.\n\n\u201cRiding (motorcycles) in a group does not show a conspiracy to commit a violent act of shooting (or) attempted murder,\u201d Pitaro said."}, {"url": "https://www.rgj.com/story/news/2022/06/02/prosecutor-hells-angels-vagos-freeway-highway-95-shooting-act-revenge/7487389001/", "page_content": "HENDERSON \u2014 Authorities suspect a Memorial Day weekend shooting on a Southern Nevada highway involving longtime rival motorcycle gangs was an act of retaliation and could be \"part of a larger case,\" a Clark County prosecutor revealed in court Thursday.\n\nAccording to Chief Deputy District Attorney Danielle Chio, a Vagos biker killed a Hells Angels member last month in San Bernardino, California \u2014 the birthplace of the Vagos Motorcycle Club in the mid-1960s.\n\n\"The concern is that there's retaliatory shootings going back and forth between the two jurisdictions and between the two clubs,\" Chio said, although she did not disclose further details about last month's killing.\n\nThe latest violent encounter unfolded Sunday morning on a stretch of U.S. Highway 95 in Henderson, a suburb located just outside Las Vegas.\n\nNew details emerge\n\nThe Hells Angels bikers, Chio said, were lying in wait on the side of the freeway as their rivals returned to the area from Arizona and neighboring Boulder City after participating in an annual group ride honoring veterans.\n\nSeven people were injured in the shooting, six of whom are affiliated with the Vagos Motorcycle Club, authorities have said. During the apparent ambush, Chio revealed, one of the bullets travelled across the highway and struck a vehicle parked outside a nearby church.\n\nAfter the shooting, according to Chio, the Hells Angels bikers headed toward a Harley-Davidson dealer, where they attempted to hide their bikes before fleeing the area.\n\nThose new details emerged Thursday during an arraignment hearing in Henderson Justice Court for 66-year-old Richard Devries, president of the Hells Angels Las Vegas chapter, and recruits Russell Smith, 46, and Stephen Alo, 26.\n\nThe trio have been in police custody since their arrests Sunday evening, each held on $380,000 bail.\n\nBail arguments\n\nDuring Thursday's hearing, Chio asked Justice of the Peace David Gibson to raise bail to $1 million, while defense lawyers Richard Schonfeld and Tom Pitaro argued for lower bail, calling the $380,000 collateral \"excessive.\"\n\nThe judge ultimately denied both requests, keeping bail at $380,000 \u2014 which Gibson described as a \"big enough number\" that would \"make somebody think again\" before committing a crime.\n\n\"I believe that there is clear and convincing evidence that all of these defendants are a danger to the community,\" Gibson said.\n\nAccording to the defense attorneys, none of the defendants have a serious criminal record, and, therefore, do not pose a risk to the community. In addition, the lawyers said, their clients have deep ties to the community.\n\nDevries, a military veteran who, according to Schonfeld, was honorably discharged, has lived in Nevada for close to two decades.\n\nAlo, meanwhile, is employed and married with one daughter. He has been a Nevada resident nearly his entire life, Pitaro said. Similarly, Smith is married, employed and owns his Southern Nevada home.\n\n\"When we look at the stability factors,\" said Pitaro, who is representing both Alo and Smith, \"how do we predict the future based upon the past? All three of these men, quite truthfully, your honor, have nothing in their past that would give the court a concern for the future.\"\n\nGibson responded: \"I can't predict the future, but I can kind of control it.\"\n\nThe rivalry\n\nDevries, Alo and Smith are scheduled to return to court on June 14.\n\nBoth Vagos and the Hells Angels, which was founded in Fontana, California, in the late 1940s, are classified as outlaw motorcycle gangs by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nTheir violent rivalry can be traced back to the Vagos gang's attempts to expand its territory, authorities have said, including a push about a decade ago into the Hells Angels' long-claimed territory of Santa Cruz.\n\nBy late 2011, the turf war would spill into Nevada, where a shootout between the clubs broke out inside a Sparks casino that ended with the death of Hells Angels leader Jeffrey Pettigrew.\n\nRio Lacanlale is the Las Vegas correspondent for the Reno Gazette Journal and the USA Today Network.

The club has around 1,000 members and is one of the largest outlaw motorcycle clubs in the United States.\n\nThe Vagos are one of the most feared outlaw motorcycle clubs in the world. They are known for their violence, drugs, and racism. The club has been involved in a number of high-profile killings, shootings, and brawls. In fact, the club has been so violent that the FBI has classified them as a \u201cmajor criminal organization.\u201d\n\nThe Vagos are a close-knit club and members are fiercely loyal to one another. New members are often required to do menial tasks such as cleaning the club\u2019s headquarters or running errands for the older members.\n\nThe Vagos Motorcycle Club is not just a group of bikers who like to ride motorcycles.

It is safe to say, however, that there is some rivalry between the two groups.\n\nThe Vagos are a motorcycle gang that was formed in the 1960s. The Hells Angels are the largest and most well-known motorcycle gang in the world. There is certainly some competition between the two groups, as each wants to be the most dominant motorcycle gang in the world.\n\nThere have been clashes between the two groups in the past, and there is certainly potential for more clashes in the future. It is important to note, however, that not all members of the Vagos and the Hells Angels are rivals. In fact, many members of the two groups get along well and even cooperate with each other.\n\nSo, are the Vagos and the Hells Angels rivals?\n\nThere is certainly some rivalry between the two groups, but it is not always clear-cut.

They are considered a \u201cone percenter\u201d gang, meaning that they are not part of the mainstream society. The Vagos are known for their criminal activities, which include drug trafficking, extortion, and murder.\n\nThe gang has been active since the 1960s, and their membership has grown to include thousands of members. The Vagos are most active in California, Nevada, and Arizona, but they have a presence in many other states.\n\nThe Vagos are considered a major threat to public safety, and law enforcement officials are working to crack down on their activities. In recent years, the gang has been involved in several high-profile crimes, including the murder of a sheriff\u2019s deputy in California.\n\nThe Vagos are a dangerous gang, and anyone who is associated with them should be aware of the risks.

This is a question that has been asked by many people over the years. There is no simple answer to this question, as there is no one answer that fits all Vagos. Some members of the gang may be white, while others may be of a different race or ethnicity.\n\nThe Vagos gang was formed in the 1960s in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles. It is believed that the gang was originally formed by a group of Mexican-American teenagers who were looking for a way to express their dissatisfaction with society. The Vagos soon began to engage in a variety of criminal activities, including drug trafficking, robbery, and murder.\n\nThe gang has since grown in size and spread to other parts of the United States. Today, the Vagos are believed to have a membership of around 10,000 people. The gang is particularly active in the states of California, Nevada, and Oregon.\n\nThe Vagos gang is not a monolithic organization. It is made up of a variety of different members with different backgrounds and beliefs. Some members of the gang may be white, while others may be of a different race or ethnicity.\n\nWhether or not the Vagos are a white gang is a matter of debate. There is no definitive answer to this question. Some people may consider the Vagos to be a white gang because the majority of its members are white, while others may not consider the gang to be white because it includes members of other races and ethnicities.\n\nUltimately, the answer to this question depends on your definition of a white gang. If you consider a white gang to be a gang whose members are all white, then the Vagos are not a white gang. However, if you consider a white gang to be a gang whose members are predominantly white, then the Vagos may be considered a white gang.\n\nWho are the enemies of the Vagos?\n\nThe Vagos are a motorcycle gang that has been around for over 50 years. They have a long list of enemies, including the Hells Angels, the Outlaws, and the Bandidos.\n\nThe Hells Angels are the Vagos\u2019 number one enemy. They are a rival motorcycle gang that was formed in California in 1948. The two gangs have been fighting for control of the drug trade since the 1970s.\n\nThe Outlaws are another rival motorcycle gang that was formed in Illinois in 1935. They are also fighting for control of the drug trade with the Vagos.\n\nThe Bandidos are a motorcycle gang that was formed in Texas in 1966. They are the biggest rival of the Vagos, and are also fighting for control of the drug trade.\n\nWho is the leader of the Vagos MC?\n\nThe Vagos Motorcycle Club (VMC) is a one percenter motorcycle club that was formed in 1965 in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles, California. The club is made up of Hispanic and Latino riders, and is considered to be one of the most violent outlaw motorcycle gangs in the US. The club\u2019s president is currently unknown, as the club is believed to be a highly-secretive and tightly-run organization.\n\nThe Vagos MC is known for its involvement in a wide range of criminal activities, including drug trafficking, gun running, prostitution, and murder. The club is also known for its brutal and violent initiation rituals, which have resulted in several deaths. In recent years, the Vagos MC has been involved in a number of high-profile clashes with rival gangs, including the Hells Angels, the Mongols, and the Bandidos.\n\nThe Vagos MC is considered to be one of the most dangerous motorcycle gangs in the United States, and its president is a highly-secretive and powerful figure. The club is believed to have a strong presence in California, Nevada, and Arizona, and is known for its involvement in a wide range of criminal activities.\n\nWho is the most feared motorcycle club?\n\nThe most feared motorcycle club in the world is the Hells Angels. This club was founded in 1948 and is considered to be the first motorcycle club in the United States. They have a long and dark history, and are known for their violence and criminal activities.\n\nThe Hells Angels are a worldwide organization, with chapters in over 100 countries. They are known for their brutal violence and for their connections to organized crime. In the United States, they are most well-known for their connections to drugs and prostitution.\n\nThe Hells Angels are considered to be one of the most dangerous motorcycle clubs in the world. They have a history of violence and crime, and are known for their willingness to use force to get what they want. They are also known for their strict rules and for their loyalty to one another.\n\nIf you are ever in a situation where you come into contact with the Hells Angels, it is best to stay away.
