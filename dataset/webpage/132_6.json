{"Carpenter's work on The Avengers was highly acclaimed.": [{"url": "https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/john-carpenter-analyzing-his-style-and-growing-influence/", "page_content": "Establishing Geography with Long Takes\n\nThe bravura opening shot of 1978\u2019s Halloween perfectly established the prowling tone of Carpenter\u2019s game-changing slasher film. In what recalls the controversial subjective moments of Michael Powell\u2019s Peeping Tom (1960), the sequence takes us on a first-person tour of the Myers household; we become unwitting spectators as a young woman gets dressed and is then brutally knifed to death. It\u2019s only a short while later that Carpenter reveals the truth: the killer is an innocent-looking boy\u2013Michael, who will return as a full-grown masked maniac later in the film.\n\nTo a modern eye used to Steadicam sequences and unaware of Halloween\u2019s history, this may not look all that impressive. But consider this: Halloween in its entirety was shot for a tiny $325,000. The opening Myers household sequence wasn\u2019t shot until the last day of Halloween\u2019s brisk production; by this point, Carpenter would probably have been wise to shoot the scene in a more conventional style. Instead he had camera operator Ray Stella creep around the Myers house with a heavy Panaglide camera, through the kitchen, up the stairs, as the crew hurried around behind him, shifting lights and bits of equipment out of his way.\n\nFar more than a gimmick, Halloween\u2019s long opening take is an example of Carpenter\u2019s interest in using the camera to establish the geography of a setting. Cinematographer Dean Cundey was key to this, and it could be argued that much of Carpenter\u2019s work simply wouldn\u2019t have been the same without him. The ingenious use of lighting, framing, and long tracking shots gave Halloween a sophistication that was sorely lacking in most cheap horror films both before and afterward.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Halloween was commissioned as the kind of drive-in movie that would make a few dollars and swiftly disappear; Carpenter and co-writer Debra Hill wound up putting far more artistry and thought into the movie than its premise necessarily deserved\u2013including that opening sequence, which is inspired by Orson Welles\u2019 groundbreaking A Touch of Evil. What could have been another forgettable babysitters-in-peril flick became something with an almost supernatural power.\n\nCarpenter did a similar thing in his first professional feature film, Assault on Precinct 13, where the deliberately paced build-up introduces the police building of the title. We may not consciously notice what Carpenter\u2019s doing, but he\u2019s establishing the layout in the audience\u2019s mind of a remote police precinct: a location that will soon become a battleground.\n\nIn The Thing, Carpenter again uses a Steadicam and long takes to establish the geography of his Antarctic outpost setting. We grow to understand the way narrow, sparse corridors connect up the kitchen, recreation room, and living quarters. We can see that the base is large enough that people (and dogs) could, if they chose to, sneak around it without being seen. And like Halloween, the use of those long, low takes establishes the sense of foreboding and impending violence."}, {"url": "https://www.gamesradar.com/john-carpenter-interview-halloween-kills/", "page_content": "Our John Carpenter interview first appeared in Total Film magazine \u2013 subscribe to the magazine here for more exclusive news, reviews, and features.\n\nHang out on Film Twitter long enough and you\u2019ll eventually stumble across someone posing this chin-scratcher: \u2018Which director is responsible for the longest, unbroken run of classic movies?\u2019 There are cases to be made for plenty of filmmakers: Coppola, Kurosawa, Nolan, Villeneuve; but few hold a pumpkin-encased candle to John Carpenter. Between 1976\u2019s Assault On Precinct 13 and 1988\u2019s They Live, Carpenter made 12 films, most of which are considered all-timers today, even if they were rarely recognised as such by contemporary audiences and critics.\n\nCarpenter was prolific, and then some. A multi, multi, multi-hyphenate, he habitually directed, wrote, produced and composed the music for his features. He was 28 years old when he penned the screenplay for Precinct 13 in eight days, and just 30 when he changed horror forever with Halloween. He was a wunderkind to make Damien Chazelle look like a late bloomer. Today he\u2019d be inundated with rich contracts to helm blockbuster franchise fare, or treated with the auteur reverence of a Tarantino. In 1982, after The Thing bombed, he was dumped as the director of Firestarter.\n\nIf Carpenter wasn\u2019t sufficiently celebrated in his heyday, there\u2019s no danger of that anymore. During an hour-long chat in late June, Total Film freely throws around words like \u2018masterpiece\u2019 and \u2018magnum opus\u2019 when describing his work \u2013 praise he accepts graciously, but not all that comfortably. Following a string of flops in the \u201990s, Carpenter fell out of love with movie making. His relationship to his work is complicated to say the least. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not the biggest fan of talking about [my films],\u201d Carpenter says over the phone from his home. \u201cBut let\u2019s do it.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s one project Carpenter is buzzed to talk about today, it\u2019s Halloween Kills. The belated sequel to Halloween (2018) sees Carpenter return as both composer and executive producer. David Gordon Green, the new trilogy\u2019s director, values Carpenter\u2019s input above almost anyone else, telling TF: \u201cIt\u2019s not like a committee of faceless studio executives giving you notes, it\u2019s the genius that created the franchise! It makes you look good.\u201d Carpenter, rather modestly, sees his role as EP a different way: \u201cEverybody comments when the movie\u2019s done. So I do the same as everyone else. It\u2019s tedious, but that\u2019s the way it goes.\u201d\n\nHe may not be prepared to pat his own back, but Carpenter will enthusiastically heap praise on others: Green is a \u201cspectacular director!\u201d, and Halloween Kills \u201ca slasher movie times 10!\u201d It\u2019s a film he\u2019s thrilled to be associated with, especially because he no longer has to \u201csuffer under the pressure of directing\u201d and can work on the film in a capacity he still enjoys \u2013 as the maestro behind its nostalgic, menacing score, alongside his son Cody and godson Daniel Davies. \u201cWe tried some different sounds this time. We let the movie guide us,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s great fun. I\u2019m very, very proud of this score \u2013 and the movie. This is what horror films should be.\u201d\n\n(Image credit: Universal)\n\nThis is what horror films should be. John Carpenter\n\nIn a different life, Carpenter may have followed in the footsteps of his father and become a music professor himself, but a viewing of Forbidden Planet in 1956 set him down a different path. \u201cIt was mind-blowing to me,\u201d he recalls. \u201cEverything about it, especially because it had an electronic soundtrack. It was like I just got dosed with LSD. I thought, \u2018Wow, I have to do this.\u2019\u201d At the USC School of Cinematic Arts he \u201clearned how to do the plumbing\u201d and started work on what would become his first feature film \u2013 sci-fi comedy Dark Star. Shot in pieces over four years for a grand total of $60,000, Carpenter considers Dark Star a \u201cstudent film made into a feature film\u201d, though few student films are now regarded as cult classics.\n\nCarpenter followed up Dark Star with the Rio Bravo-inspired Assault On Precinct 13 in 1976. Other than a brouhaha with the MPAA, who took issue with the still-shocking scene in which Frank Doubleday\u2019s Warlord guns down a young girl in cold blood while she clutches an ice cream, Carpenter remembers the film \u2013 his first shot to a schedule in just 20 days \u2013 as extraordinarily hard work: \u201cI had no idea how tough it was going to be. But I got to use Panavision widescreen, which I loved.\u201d\n\nThe next 12 years would prove the most fruitful, and demanding, of Carpenter\u2019s career for a simple, but surprising reason. \u201cOnce I started [making movies], I was afraid I wasn\u2019t going to get to do it again,\u201d he admits. \u201cMy whole goal in life was to be a professional movie director, and make a living at it. So when a movie came along, or two movies, I\u2019d say yes. I worked like a dog.\u201d In 1978 Carpenter shot both Halloween and Elvis \u2013 a three-hour TV movie with dozens of locations and speaking parts. \u201cI was so tired. But I just couldn\u2019t say no. Especially when you\u2019re young and starting out, you can\u2019t say no.\u201d\n\nDespite the pressure to come, Carpenter remembers Halloween as the most fun he ever had directing. \u201cThat was a blast. We were just a bunch of kids making a movie. Nothing has been like it ever since. It\u2019s always been pain!\u201d Halloween would go on to be a phenomenon, yet it was anything but a success from where Carpenter was standing. \u201cI thought I\u2019d made a bomb in Halloween. Seriously, I did,\u201d he says, doubling down. \u201cInitially, it was a regional release. And it got a bunch of bad reviews. Some of them I took to heart: \u2018Carpenter does not do well with actors.\u2019 Ugh, my God.\u201d It was only after the film's New York release that word of mouth picked up. \u201cBut at the time I did not know, so I was still taking jobs right and left.\u201d\n\nOn the heels of Halloween, The Fog became one of Carpenter\u2019s few undisputed box-office hits, but it was nearly a wreck, with Carpenter deeply unsatisfied with his first cut of the film. \u201cI was too heavy-handed in some areas. I had fucked it up, to be honest with you. And I realised, \u2018I can\u2019t let this out this way. I have to do better.\u2019 So we did.\u201d As for the notoriously naff 2005 remake: \u201cI was delighted, because I didn\u2019t have to do anything and I got paid again \u2013 that was just wonderful!\u201d\n\n(Image credit: AVCO Embassy Pictures/Studiocanal/Rialto Pictures)\n\nThere\u2019s probably a third or maybe even fourth story about Snake. John Carpenter\n\nCarpenter\u2019s defining collaborator during the \u201980s was a former Disney kid called Kurt Russell. The pair became \u201cfast friends on the basis of professionalism\u201d during the making of Elvis and would reunite on Escape From New York which, with a budget of $6m, was Carpenter\u2019s most ambitious project at the time. Working with Ernest Borgnine and western icon Lee Van Cleef thrilled Carpenter, while Escape From LA remains his only sequel as a director. Does Snake Plissken hold a special place in his heart? \u201cHe\u2019s a character that Kurt is passionately fond of. He convinced me to do the sequel,\" he says. \"There\u2019s probably a third or maybe even fourth story about Snake. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll ever make it, but I think that he deserves it.\u201d\n\nThe Thing \u2013 or rather the reception to The Thing \u2013 would prove a turning point in Carpenter\u2019s career. Shooting on location in Alaska, and with Rob Bottin\u2019s demanding special effects, could have been a disaster, but Universal were \u201cvery supportive\u201d having gone through a similar experience with Jaws \u2013 a film that turned out OK for all involved. Where the studio did have major problems was with the film\u2019s nihilistic ending. \u201cWe actually came up with the final lines up there on location,\u201d Carpenter recalls. \u201cUniversal, once they saw what we\u2019d done, said, \u2018Can\u2019t you be triumphant here?\u2019 I had a lot of pressure to change it.\u201d Needless to say, Carpenter stuck to his guns. And what cut the deepest about The Thing\u2019s commercial failure is that the film was exactly the movie Carpenter envisioned, no compromises. \u201cIt was hated by everybody when it came out because it was so dark. It\u2019s the end of everything. I mean, come on!\u201d\n\nWhile it wasn\u2019t the end of Carpenter\u2019s career, it certainly felt that way for a while. \u201cI was fired off of Firestarter because of The Thing. They kicked my butt to the pavement. So I was looking for a job, and I did Christine.\u201d A year later Carpenter would be back in Hollywood\u2019s good graces after helming Starman \u2013 a film outside his wheelhouse, but one he found mainstream success with. \u201cIt was an opportunity to do a romance. It\u2019s amazing that it came along. Jeff was incredible to work with.\u201d\n\nBridges was Oscar-nominated for his performance, and Starman\u2019s success allowed Carpenter to get another leftfield project off the ground: Big Trouble In Little China. \u201cI loved kung fu movies right from the first one I saw \u2013 Five Fingers Of Death. Oh my God, it was just a joy.\u201d Shooting Big Trouble\u2026 was similarly joyous for Carpenter, but the same can\u2019t be said for working with 20th Century Fox on the film - a fraught experience that caused Carpenter to step away from major studio moviemaking. \u201cOn Big Trouble\u2026 I was working with the head of a studio who was an intentionally cruel human being. I just didn\u2019t want to deal with that any more.\u201d\n\n(Image credit: 20th Century Studios)\n\nI loved kung fu movies right from the first one I saw John Carpenter\n\nCarpenter temporarily found a home at independent production company Alive Films, who offered him a simple deal: a thrifty $3m budget in return for complete creative control. Prince Of Darkness was the first project to result \u2013 a Quatermass-inspired collision of theology and theoretical physics. Darkness was swiftly followed by They Live \u2013 a \u201cprimal scream against Reaganomics\u201d that has become increasingly relevant over the years, something that amuses Carpenter because \u201cIt has a big fight in the middle that has nothing to do with anything!\u201d Imagery from They Live has been utilised in anti-capitalist protest art, but in recent years Carpenter has found himself stamping out incorrect readings of his work. \u201cThe right wing is trying to adopt that movie for its own. They think that the aliens are Jewish. For fuck\u2019s sake \u2013 come on, you idiots!\u201d\n\nIn retrospect They Live was the end of an era. It would take four years for his next film \u2013 Memoirs Of An Invisible Man \u2013 to reach screens, and the films that followed largely failed to capture the creative spirit of his \u201980s heyday. He eventually burned out following 2001\u2019s Ghosts Of Mars (\u201cI don\u2019t like getting up in the morning. I\u2019d rather sleep in.\u201d), and wouldn\u2019t direct a feature film again until 2010\u2019s The Ward. What was it that tempted him back? \u201cThe pressure. Just pressure,\u201d he admits. \u201cAnd I got to work with some really talented young ladies.\u201d\n\nThings changed drastically for Carpenter in 2015, after he survived a \u201cpretty serious illness\u201d. In the years since he\u2019s focused on the things that make him happy: namely videogames (he's currently whiling away the hours with Assassin's Creed: Valhalla and Fallout '76) and music. Earlier this year, he put out his fourth studio album, Lost Themes III, and in addition to his work on the new Halloween trilogy, Carpenter says he\u2019s agreed to score another movie later this year. He doesn\u2019t rule out a return behind the camera either. \u201cI\u2019m working on it. I\u2019m always thinking about it. I\u2019m always looking out for a project that would be great. I would do it, sure, but the conditions have to be right. There has to be enough money, and there has to be enough time.\u201d He even has an idea, and he\u2019s only half-joking: \u201cKurt\u2019s Santa Claus now \u2013 I want to try to get him to play an evil Santa Claus! I think he\u2019d be great.\u201d\n\nAs for Halloween, with the final film in David Gordon Green\u2019s trilogy due out in 2022, Carpenter could be about to leave Haddonfield behind for good. But, ever the realist, he doesn\u2019t see this as the end of the road for Michael Myers. \u201cI\u2019d like to caution you that if Halloween Kills and Halloween Ends make money, I don\u2019t know that you really have seen the end [laughs]. Maybe of my involvement! Maybe they will say, \u2018We want a fresh approach. Let\u2019s get this bum out of here!\u2019 Whatever\u2026 See, I\u2019ve changed my whole feel later in life. I embrace everything. Everything is wonderful.\u201d\n\nHalloween Kills reaches UK and US cinemas October 15.

Billed as \u201cEarth\u2019s mightiest super-heroes,\u201d the team was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, and it debuted in The Avengers no. 1 (September 1963).\n\nUnderstand the scientific and fictional explanation behind the powers of Marvel Comics' Avengers See all videos for this article\n\nInspired by the success of DC Comics\u2019 Justice League of America, which featured characters such as Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman, Marvel sought to unite its biggest names in a single book. The Avengers, however, was anything but a carbon copy of Justice League. Marvel\u2019s team was characterized by internal conflict, and it owed its existence largely to the machinations of a villain. Loki, the Norse god of mischief, maneuvers his half brother, the thunder god Thor, into a battle against the Hulk. This fracas also attracts the attention of Iron Man and the crime-fighting duo of Ant-Man and the Wasp. Although this quartet at first believes the Hulk to be the villain responsible for an act of railway sabotage, Loki quickly emerges as the real culprit and suffers a decisive defeat. Before the heroes disperse, Ant-Man suggests that they make their association a permanent one, and the Avengers (a name suggested by the Wasp) are born.\n\nBritannica Quiz Marvel or DC?\n\nThe team\u2019s lineup changed almost immediately, with the departure of the Hulk and the induction of Captain America, who had been frozen in a block of ice since the end of the World War II.\n\nIn its next roster shuffle, The Avengers further distinguished itself from Justice League of America by questioning the idea of heroism itself. Whereas the JLA members were all unambiguously heroic, more than a few Avengers started their careers as villains. When Thor, Giant-Man (the former Ant-Man, who would later change his name again to Goliath), and the Wasp simultaneously leave the team, Captain America finds himself heading a new squad of Avengers, each of whom has a checkered past. The bow-wielding Hawkeye previously fought against Iron Man, whereas Quicksilver, a mutant speedster reminiscent of DC\u2019s Flash, and the Scarlet Witch, a young woman with the power to alter probabilities, had been members of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants along with their father, Magneto. The theme of redemption is reinforced when Wonder Man, introduced as a villain in The Avengers no. 9 (October 1964), returns from the dead as a hero and takes his place in the Avengers\u2019 ranks.\n\nFrom its inception, The Avengers was a hit, and the series\u2019 initial success doubtless owes much to the power-packed renderings of Kirby, who had not only cocreated Captain America with writer Joe Simon in 1941 but had also collaborated with Lee on such Marvel mainstay titles as The Fantastic Four, The Incredible Hulk, and Journey into Mystery. Artist Don Heck ably took over the penciling reins after Kirby\u2019s departure, and Lee continued writing the book until he handed the series off to Roy Thomas in 1966. Over the next several years Thomas worked with such notable Marvel artists as Heck, John Buscema, Gene Colan, Barry Windsor-Smith, Sal Buscema, and Neal Adams, whose brief run on the title in 1971 is widely regarded as among the finest Avengers work ever done.\n\nUnder Thomas\u2019s direction, story arcs in The Avengers became increasingly complex and character-oriented, flowering into a superpowered melodrama of operatic proportions. The \u201cKree-Skrull War,\u201d an intergalactic saga that placed the Avengers at the centre of a battle between two alien races, was perhaps the finest expression of this trend. Among the many notable characters introduced during Thomas\u2019s tenure were such team members as the Vision (an emotionally tortured android with the ability to make himself intangible) and such villains as the Grim Reaper (the vengeance-crazed brother of Wonder Man) and Ultron (a world-conquering robot who sought to destroy his creator, Hank Pym, the former Ant-Man). Thomas left the series after issue no. 104 (October 1972), to be succeeded by Steve Englehart, who authored a seminal time-travel arc involving the villain Kang the Conqueror and his time-displaced doppelgangers Rama-Tut and Immortus. Other writers in this period included Jim Shooter\u2014who crafted \u201cthe Korvac Saga,\u201d a massive tale involving cosmic forces that span the entire Marvel Universe\u2014Roger Stern, and John Byrne.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

By the mid-1980s the New York-based team had reached such unwieldy proportions that a second squad\u2014the West Coast Avengers\u2014was formed in Los Angeles, under the initial leadership of Hawkeye. In 1989 a team of misfits styling itself as the Great Lakes Avengers debuted, but it never achieved official standing with either of the bicoastal teams. The 1990s was replete with Avengers miniseries and other ancillary titles executed by various creative teams, including Kurt Busiek\u2019s hugely popular, time-spanning Avengers Forever (1998\u201399). Busiek chronicled most of the team\u2019s adventures in The Avengers from 1997 to 2002, collaborating with artists such as George P\u00e9rez, Stuart Immonen, and John Romita, Jr., before leaving the series in the hands of writer Geoff Johns. In 2002 writer Mark Millar and artist Bryan Hitch collaborated on a reinvention of the Avengers for Marvel\u2019s \u201cUltimate\u201d line. Titled The Ultimates, the book boasted strong sales throughout its run, but initial critical enthusiasm waned as the series progressed.\n\nA young team of superheroes bands together in Young Avengers, a series that debuted in 2005. The book was praised for its light tone and its realistic depiction of relationships, particularly that of same-sex couple Hulkling and Wiccan. During Marvel\u2019s \u201cCivil War\u201d event (2006\u201307), two rival teams of Avengers emerged. Iron Man organized the official team, the Mighty Avengers, who supported and enforced the Superhuman Registration Act, a law that mandated that superheroes divulge their identities to the government. In contrast, the New Avengers were an underground team of heroes who opposed the act and included Luke Cage, Spider-Man, and Wolverine as members. Later, Norman Osborn, the original Green Goblin, became a high ranking government official and organized his own Dark Avengers, including disguised supervillains. After Osborn fell from power, there was again one Avengers team, although it was not long before secondary Avengers squads emerged once more. Debuting in 2010 were Avengers Academy, which detailed the Avengers\u2019 training program for young superhumans; Secret Avengers, about a superhuman team of covert operatives; and a relaunched New Avengers. Following the events of the Avengers vs. X-Men crossover in 2012, Uncanny Avengers launched with a lineup that included members of both of Marvel\u2019s premier super teams.\n\nThe Avengers were depicted in numerous animated films and television series, and the team made its live-action film debut in The Avengers (2012). Directed and cowritten by Joss Whedon, the creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the film united the various properties in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a blockbuster production that was a hit with both fans and critics. The Avengers earned more than $1.5 billion worldwide, making it one of the top-grossing films of all time. Whedon and cast reunited for the sequel, The Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), which was the screen debut of one of the group\u2019s most-implacable foes. Joe and Anthony Russo, who had helmed the Marvel films Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) and Captain America: Civil War (2016), took over in the director\u2019s chair for Avengers: Infinity War (2018). Eighteen films over the span of 10 years had built up to Avengers: Infinity War, whose story pitted virtually every major character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe against the Mad Titan, Thanos. That massive narrative arc was concluded with Avengers: Endgame (2019)."}, {"url": "https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/astro/people/stanway/sciencefiction/cosmicstories/the_avengers_and", "page_content": "The Avengers was a 1960s British spy thriller television series in which the lead character was a gentlemanly secret agent, John Steed, who worked with a succession of unusual and free-thinking assistants. (Note for children and Americans: very definitely not the same as Captain America and co, and the reason the first Avengers film was renamed \"Avengers Assemble\" in the UK!). Like a lot of television serials of this epoch, the series straddled categories, with elements of science fiction, fantasy, crime drama, surrealism and humour all mixed in with Cold War intrigue. The humour and science fiction became more prominent as the series progressed through an eight year run between 1961 and 1969, and a revival in 1976-1977. Given the series' setting in contemporary Britain (at the time it was made) the science fiction in The Avengers was primarily expressed in the form of technological innovations which either run amok or are deliberately deployed by individuals seeking revenge, political goals, financial gain or personal advancement. The consequences may be felt by individual victims, members of families or professions, sectors of society, or have global military and political implications. Examples of such science fiction elements include laser cannons (\"From Venus with Love\"), computer intelligence (\"Who Killed Poor George/XR40\", \"Killer\"), robots (\"The Cybernauts\"), soporifics (\"The Morning After\", \"Sleeper\"), pesticides (\"The Grandeur that was Rome\", \"Silent Dust\"), new materials (\"Immortal Clay\", \"Propellant 23\") or infectious agents (\"The Golden Eggs\", \"Not to be Sneezed At\"). The increasing prevalence of such science fiction plots was due at least in part to public demand: The Stage and Television Today noted in December 1966 that this was a deliberate decision by the programme makers in response to the popularity of two SF-heavy episodes (\"A Surfeit of H20\" and \"The Man-Eater of Surrey Green\") in the previous series. Inevitably these SF elements were most often used as plot devices to lead to investigative confusion or humour, or to highlight the insanity of the central (often mad scientist) protagonists. Although some of the newer materials and medical innovations proposed were conceivable given the rapid pace of 1960s scientific development, many of the other innovations are wildly implausible by the standards of the science of the time, let alone today\u2019s understanding, and there is no indication that the writers were invested in seriously exploring plausible futures. By the end of each episode the science fiction elements would usually be destroyed or proven ineffective, and there would be no long-term consequences of the invention or discovery. So, if the SF elements of The Avengers are relatively trivial compared to some of the more serious science fiction of the time and since - essentially science fantasy rather than science fiction - why am I talking about this series?\n\nWell, as always, the first reason is that it\u2019s just good plain fun. The other reason, equally important, is that it\u2019s made me think about what I\u2019ll call the imminence of scientific discovery in the popular consciousness at the time. Science in twenty-first century Britain tends to fall into two broad categories: There\u2019s the highly technical, intensely difficult innovation which occurs in teams based in university laboratories, government facilities or major industries, and which requires many years of training to participate in. Into this category we might put major projects like vaccine research or the detection of gravitational waves.\n\nAnd there\u2019s the black-box technology used in the every day, for which styling and colour is often more important and relevant to most consumers than the underlying principles on which the devices work. Into this category we might put the brightly coloured smartphones, laptops, cars or other consumer electronics. In neither of these roles does scientific discovery appear accessible to average members of the public. Even where it is having an immediate impact on people\u2019s lives (as in the case of the current covid pandemic), scientific innovation is something done elsewhere, by someone else and its details are fully expected to surpass an average understanding. Most progress is incremental, with few truly revolutionary breakthrough technologies (although the shiny-incomprehensibility of smartphones may well fall into this category). It\u2019s interesting to compare that with the state of public engagement with science in the 1960s. Big projects certainly existed in the mid-twentieth century, with the Space Race perhaps exemplifying this. There was also consumer technology starting to come onto the market, particularly in the form of telecommunications and home appliances. However in contrast to the highly miniaturised electronics of the current day, the majority of home equipment was at least broadly understandable to members of the public. This was an era when children\u2019s comics could print cut-away diagrams of the inner workings of devices, a radio set could be built from a simple kit and an owners' manual was sufficient to repair or service a car, rather than needing a computer to access and reprogramme sealed electronics units. During the 1950s and 60s, Penguin imprint Pelican Books published a long-running and successful series of popular science paperbacks for a general audience with titles like \"Plastics in the Service of Man\" (Couzens & Yarsley 1956), \"Organic Chemistry Today\" (Gibbs 1961) and \"The Boundaries of Science\" (Pyke 1963) - there is an implicit assumption that technical information was not just accessible to everyone, but applicable. The potential for grass-roots scientific breakthroughs - made by anyone, anywhere was articulated by a financier in the Avengers episode \"Death of a Batman\" (1963): \"These men, the scientist and engineers, they\u2019re our only hope - don\u2019t you see that? We lent capital to a man in a small garage in Cricklewood, and today his electronics firm is the finest in the country\u2026. there isn\u2019t a rocket or a missile in the Western World that doesn\u2019t owe something to him and to us.\" In this context, science was something happening all around, and involving everyone. Counterintuitively then, despite the narrative of constant scientific advancement, knowledge of practical science was far more part of the everyday world - more imminent - fifty years ago than it is now.\n\nThe prevalence of science fiction themes and elements in The Avengers then reflects the extent to which members of the viewing public expected their lives to be changed by a rapid succession of technical innovations, and the extent to which scientific information formed part of a popular discourse. While many of The Avengers\u2019 inventions were wildly unfeasible from a technical point of view, the idea that one person could come up with life-changing innovations, often working in private, sometimes just in their home or office, was close enough to plausibility for audiences to accept and enjoy the storylines. The range of areas involved - from cybernetics to microbiology - makes clear just how many different aspects of life were seen as being in (or vulnerable to) flux. It\u2019s also worth looking at the scientists in The Avengers, and what we can learn from them - always taking into account the comic exaggeration that was so frequent in the series and turned many of the supporting characters into caricatures. In his essay \u201cThe Medium is the Message\u201d (1994, The Avengers Programme Guide), Keith Topping noted that \u201cany analysis of the 1960s usually has to conclude that whilst the era produced scientific wonder, the public was so frightened of out-of-control technology that such advances were regarded as little more than another step towards Armageddon\u201d. That pretty much aligns with my own reading of the series: The Avengers both recognises the fantastic potential of science (exploring the opportunities of automation and disease mitigation) and betrays a deep unease about its potential for misuse (whether deliberate or accidental). As to the roots of this unease? Well, there are two strong hints implicit in the series itself. The first of these is the obvious: the Cold War themes which drive a large fraction of episodes articulate the constant fear of nuclear catastrophe that the public of the 1960s lived under, a fear closely associated with innovations in physics and engineering. The second hint can perhaps be found in the juxtaposition between protagonist Steed and his successive colleagues. Steed exemplifies the role of a traditional English Gentleman - urbane, publicly educated, champagne-drinking, affluent, well-dressed and never incorrect. By contrast first Cathy Gale, then Emma Steed, Tara King, Mike Gambit and Purdey (setting aside for a moment the first formative season) are modern, up-to-date, fast-moving and exciting. They exemplify the pace of change not only driven by technical innovation but also fundamental alterations of the class system, agricultural reform, wealth redistribution, welfare systems, gender politics and societal norms. Through comparison with the stable figure of Steed, they highlight rate at which the world and society in the United Kingdom were having to adapt and the inevitable accompanying fear of the unknown and its hazards. Many of these other changes were explored alongside the scientific in the series. And the scientists themselves? Well the majority fall into the classic stereotypes: educated white men, either white haired and arrogant, or young and rebellious. Many fit the trope of the helpless genius overtaken by events, while others are (or aspire to be) criminal masterminds. A handful follow another familiar trope: that of the rational scientist who prioritises logic over emotion, always to their cost and that of those around them. But there is nonetheless a nod towards some democratisation of science in The Avengers. A handful of female scientists appear - for example the episode \u201cThe White Dwarf\u201d (1963) features both women scientists and an astronomer of Indian extraction, while in \u201cFrom Venus with Love\u201d (1967) a woman named Venus Brown is described as having studied at Jodrell Bank. There are also a number of private or small-time inventors, from a range of backgrounds.\n\nAll in all then, The Avengers is not exactly SF (just as it\u2019s not exactly spy-fi, or crime fiction, or\u2026 just about any single category). It has to be interpreted through the mask of humour and exaggeration. It nonetheless offers some interesting insights into how science and scientists were perceived in its time.\n\n\"The Avengers and the Imminence of Science in 1960s Britain\", Elizabeth Stanway, Cosmic Stories blog, 30th May 2021."}, {"url": "https://www.practicalclassics.co.uk/articles/restoration-projects/hillman/", "page_content": "RESTO HERO \u2013 HILLMAN AVENGER\n\nA broad South Yorkshire voice booms across the car park at the Elsecar Heritage Railway station. \u2018They were reet good, them!\u2019 belts the stranger, pointing at the gleaming golden paintwork of our Hillman Avenger. The middle-aged gent\u2019s enthusiastic outburst continues as he approaches: \u2018Mine was a dark orangey brown colour with a vinyl roof. If I\u2019d bothered to pay extra, I\u2019d have got the brushed nylon seats but I had a wife and baby to feed.\u2019\n\nIntroducing himself as a volunteer at the Heritage Railway, Michael greets us with warm handshake and peers through all the car windows before declaring to owner Howard Hargate, that it was one of the best vehicles he\u2019d ever owned. \u2018It was a shame when we got rid. We moved house but it wouldn\u2019t fit in the garage so I replaced it with a Sunbeam. That were basically a chopped Avenger, weren\u2019t it?\u2019 Howard nods and the strangers begin a conversation bursting with affectionate memories of this most underrated of British saloons.\n\nGet Practical Classics magazine delivered to your door every month with a subscription!\n\nFOND MEMORIES\n\nI step back and listen, enjoying the stories as the chatter quickly escalates into rich nostalgia and shared experiences of life in South Yorkshire, each element punctuated with great bursts of laughter. It is the soundtrack of a million car shows and car parks. The wistful chatter about old vehicles like this one is powerful and priceless. They are real cars and we can all relate to their intended purposes: From school runs and family holidays to motorway business blasts. Cars like this helped to make Britain function properly.\n\n\u2018Everyone remembers the Cortina and the Marina but the Avenger is the great forgotten classic\u2019 says Howard. \u2018They were really popular and well liked at the time yet not many people appreciate them now.\u2019 However, judging by the reaction we\u2019re getting, they sure remember them. \u2018People see it at shows and go crazy. You can see them grinning a mile off as they come over and tell me they used to have one and love it\u2019.\n\nThe Avenger was the first car Howard ever worked on, as a 15 year old apprentice in the service department of JC Snell in Barnsley - the local Chrysler dealership. \u2018They even sent me to the engine plant in Coventry for a week, so I could see how they were put together\u2019. Evidently, that kind of thing really helps when you\u2019re carrying out a restoration, with Howard\u2019s knowledge of Avengers resulting in the acquisition and restoration of the perfect example.\n\nAZTEC AVENGER\n\n\u2018My mum passed away in 2012 and left me a little bit of money so it was my wife, Julie, who suggested I should buy something special for myself.\u2019 No MGB or TR6 for Howard, though: \u2018No other car even entered my head. I knew exactly what I wanted. It had to be an Avenger.\u2019 Having begun his Avenger love affair many years ago in a Super 1500, Howard was determined to find a top notch GLS. \u2018The one with the velour seats and a bit of wood grain on the dash!\u2019 However, he settled for his 35,000 mile Aztec Gold Super which he found in Ireland. The first owner had cherished his Avenger from 1971 to 2005. \u2018It was shipped over and arrived on a wet Wednesday night on the back of a car transporter. It was dark and wet and horrible but the car started first time and I was able to drive it.\u2019\n\nThe weather wasn\u2019t kind to Howard on the journey home. \u2018It was a truly terrible night. The car was all steamed up and the single speed wipers were going at full speed!\u2019 Once back inside his garage, he discovered the Avenger was in need of work. \u2018The more I looked, the more rust bubbles I found. The front wings were shot, the back of the sills were bad, the rear arch was on its way and there were some generally poor repairs about the place.\u2019\n\nWORLD CAR\n\nLike many cars of the era, the Hillman Avenger had a fabulous talent for rusting quite spectacularly. Yet the Avenger formed part of an ambitious programme for its maker. This was an early example of \u2018the world car\u2019 \u2013 aimed at markets across the planet in various guises. Built in Ryton, Linwood, Iran and New Zealand, it was sold in South Africa, South America, the US and Canada. Because of this, there was a need to accommodate locally produced engines so the Avenger had a simple mechanical layout. It was lighter and cheaper to produce than the Hunter (Arrow) and with a smaller amount of sheet metal, fewer welds were needed during production. Stuff like that really mattered with a car intended to take on the world.\n\nAs was quite usual for the era, costs were tight and this crept into the product line in bemusing ways. \u2018During the first two years of production, they put the Avenger badge only on the nearside of the car, where pedestrians could see it and identify it\u2019 laughs Howard. \u2018Costs wouldn\u2019t permit them to put the badge on both sides.\u2019\n\nHowever, there were flourishes of brilliance in the design \u2013 particularly for a mainstream 70s saloon. More advanced than anything leaf-sprung, the Avenger\u2019s four-link rear suspension and front anti-roll bars gave it a composed driving edge over rivals, whilst fashion consultants had been brought in by Chrysler to help the colour and trim studio predict material trends. Launched a year before in 1969, the rival Maxi might have been smarter in concept, it looked a bit stumpy alongside the swanky flanks of the Avenger \u2013 the last car to be developed by Rootes before Chrysler took over. \u2018I\u2019ve had a Mk3 Cortina, an 1800 and a Marina but they just weren\u2019t the same\u2019 says Howard. \u2018The Avenger is just so much fun to drive. The engine is basic but they do go very well.\u2019\n\nEnjoying the read? Why not buy a full issue of Practical Classics magazine! Because nothing beats paper right?\n\nTHE BIG REVIVAL\n\nThat all-iron overhead valve unit needed to come out of Howard\u2019s car though. He stripped and decoked it, refurbished the carb and then gave it new valve seals, a new head gasket and painted the block. \u2018I did the engine bay while I had the chance too \u2013 cleaned it up like new.\u2019 Stripping the car down in his garage at home wasn\u2019t easy. \u2018It\u2019s just a normal household garage so I can just about do what I need to do!\u2019\n\nLuckily, Howard got permission to do the rest of the job at a spare workshop, owned by his employers. It gave him some much-needed space. \u2018The refurbishment was supposed to take a few months but it ended up taking six!\u2019 Following extensive work on the Avenger\u2019s bodywork and the fierce slaying of the rust, it was respray time. \u2018I wanted it perfect and I just didn\u2019t have the talent\u2019 admits Howard. So he took it to a specialist. \u2018I felt bad as I kept badgering the lad to get the car back. But when I look at the job he\u2019s done \u2013 it\u2019s just incredible. I showed the car at the NEC in 2013 and a bloke commented on the car, saying it\u2019s the best respray he\u2019s seen in 30 years of being in the motor trade.\u2019\n\nThe paint job is indeed very impressive, even under these grey drizzly South Yorkshire skies. It\u2019s a car with hidden depths and deserves much greater recognition. \u2018My favourite detail is the hockey-stick rear light units. It\u2019s a shame when they lost those in 1976. The new rear lights they installed leaked water into the electrics, which you never had with these original models.\u2019\n\nBADGE ENGINEERING\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s for that reason the Avenger fell off the radar so quickly. As well as the taming of that distinctive styling, the later model suffered from a bit of an identity crisis, when it was rebadged as a Chrysler in 1976 and then rebadged again in 1979 as a Talbot (when Chrysler dumped their European division onto Peugeot Citroen PSA a year earlier). The Avenger finally died when PSA closed the Linwood factory in \u201881.\n\nAmid all the kerfuffle with Talbot, Howard decided on a change of career in 1984, when he became a driving instructor for the ambulance service. \u2018The Avenger bug never went away though. I ended up owning five of them.\u2019 This includes Howard\u2019s daily driver, a red Avenger Estate and, of course, this beautiful Aztec saloon.\n\nThe sun makes a brief appearance as we say our goodbyes and as if to signal the end of the day, a steam train whistle sounds nearby. Elsecar is a volunteer run line built to serve the local coalfields and ironworks. It\u2019s easy for some of us to forget we\u2019re standing in the heart of one of Britain\u2019s biggest former engine rooms.

I could understand the creature\u2019s ferocity and psychological warfare, but it was an incomplete picture, and a gaping hole in my cinephilia I didn\u2019t correct until now. Carpenter\u2019s 1982 classic is beloved by several of my counterparts within the film community, and as a John Carpenter fan myself, it was perennially on my to-watch list. Through a few quick internet searches, it\u2019s apparent that this is a beloved film, confirmed by a societal, if not cultish appreciation for Carpenter and his ethos. The Thing, the titular character and the film itself, has an omnipresence and stealth method of assimilation. Perhaps that\u2019s just Carpenter\u2019s genius, or it\u2019s the fact that a villain so stirring, so gloriously disturbing, paired with a compelling story, is once in a lifetime. The climactic moments scattered throughout the action in The Thing are disturbing and awe-inspiring, and the world of film is indebted to Carpenter.\n\nI started the film from its beginning, prepared with a wide-eyed fascination, eager to bring my husband on the journey, anticipating the moves of the creature and excitement that piqued my interest long ago. I felt the same pangs of admiration with each sound queue, and body horror visual. It\u2019s a feeling that only happens when you\u2019re really wowed by something so landmark, so revolutionary. If any scene is deserving of wide-spread acclaim, it\u2019s when the remaining survivors are tied up to test their infection rate, peak abyss in the psychological descent of Antarctic crew. The surviving men angered and shaking while R.J. MacGready tests blood samples to see if The Thing has co-opted another body is as potent a scene as Christopher Walken\u2019s final moments in The Deer Hunter souped-up with immaculate special effects. We were hooked, with each phase of the plot more cunning and intriguing than the next, even if there were some motifs that felt familiar.\n\nThe familiarity astounded me upon this 2020 watch, and I could tell that the amount of theme, plot, and character was heavily borrowed. After my husband and I brainstormed, we realized how much culture had taken from The Thing beyond homage or allusion. That sort of admiration doesn\u2019t usually bother me, but when I realized The Thing\u2019s original 1982 reviews were less than stellar, I was angered. Why was it that The Thing was not critically acclaimed at its time of release, and why do we laud content like Stranger Things or the body of work from Guillermo Del Toro when it is not only an homage, but a true lift-and-shift into a globally-marketed film or television show? Carpenter had this same situation with his other films, and the next generation continued to create work with nods to his originals.\n\nStranger Things (2019) | Netflix\n\nThe critical history of The Thing and Carpenter\u2019s 1970s-1980s work is mixed, with an underlying dismissal of his horror prowess as exploitative. With a retrospective eye, and after a blackout period in the 2000s, his position of influence has been reassessed in popular culture with appropriation of his work, and a devoted, outspoken following. The next generation understood his nuances, and the complexities of horror as a relatable subject. \u201cIt is always flattering to have somebody copy you,\u201d he\u2019s quoted in response to the iterations and allusions from countless other films such as Friday the 13th (1980) influenced by Carpenter\u2019s Halloween (1978) or The Purge: Anarchy (2014) from They Live (1988).The irony is that his successors often received the immediate critical embrace he did not. If anything, it\u2019s bizarre that The Thing is not in the pantheon of films that transcend their genre like Alien or Terminator. Yet alas, the critical eye in the 1980s was not onboard, and for whatever reason, John Carpenter could not transcend the genre. Much like Tarantino borrows heavily from 1970s exploitation films and wins Oscars, we\u2019re living with the same circumstances within the horror genre.\n\nYet Carpenter himself doesn\u2019t seem to mind this all too much. The humility of the director is apparent in his interviews, poking fun at his categorization:\n\n\u201cIn England, I\u2019m a horror movie director. In Germany, I\u2019m a filmmaker. In the US, I\u2019m a bum.\u201d\n\nDisembodied Head with Spider Legs from The Thing | Universal Pictures\n\nAs a fan, I think he deserves more than this. Hopefully one day the powers that be create an honorary Oscar or at least give him a shot at the Criterion Collection. He is not only a filmmaker, but an auteur and an inspiration. You\u2019ll find an entire generation of horror filmmakers who have found his work as inspiring and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s or Vittorio De Sica\u2019s.

Tell us, what does a carpenter like yourself do here in the city of Rome?\n\nWell, first I should say that there are many different types of carpenters and woodworkers in Rome. While we all practice the ars fabrilis, really what we do is quite different.\n\nI am a conductor, or contractor. I oversee the construction of large houses and buildings, a position of authority I\u2019ve achieved after countless years demonstrating my craftsmanship and ability, first as an apprentice and then as a foreman working under a contractor myself. Now, the manual work I oversee is performed by slaves and apprentices, who are themselves often supervised by other specialists I employ.\n\nWe have many different specialties. My brother Lucius, for instance, is an excellent faber navalis, a shipwright. He helps maintain the triremes that have allowed the powerful Roman navy to conquer all challengers in the Mediterranean. And my neighbor Marcus is a plostrarius, a maker of the wagons and wagon wheels used to transport merchandise throughout the city and beyond. There are many other woodworkers, including those that make furniture, chests, and boxes, and those who specialize in buying and selling wood. All of us are members of the collegium fabrum tignuariorum, the woodworkers\u2019 guild.\n\nYou see, wood is one of the most important resources we have in all of the Empire. While the wealthy families of this city may look down on us common craftsmen, their homes, chariots, ships, bridges, and household items are made of wood and crafted by us. From the largest aqueducts to the smallest hair combs, this empire is essentially built from wood.\n\nWhat types of wood do you use to build such works?\n\nI typically work with the wood of the silver fir, the abies alba. It is common in this region, and grows large but not so large that it is impossible to fell. Some woodworkers will also use maple or birch, and for smaller handcrafted items, we will often use buxus, or boxwood.\n\nBecause these trees only grow outside of the city, I don\u2019t go to chop them down myself. Instead I purchase the wood I need from the abietarius, who specializes in procuring and selling wood to craftsmen like myself. What he cannot sell for proper woodworking he sells as firewood, which we use in our homes. We also use the wood to fire pottery and create charcoal to forge iron and bronze.\n\nAs cities around the empire grow, I am hearing that the abietarius and his men have to travel further and further into the countryside to obtain timber, as the trees surrounding Rome are simply gone. This is worrisome, as it is taking much longer to obtain both wood for building and firewood and the price has increased significantly.\n\nWhat are some of the most important tools for your work?\n\nTools are precious to a Roman carpenter, and each of mine are handmade and actually quite valuable. Back in my officina I have many tools, some of which I use everyday and some of which I need but once or twice a year.\n\nThe ones carpenters use most often are the malleus and the clavus, what you would call a hammer and nail. I also have a number of regulae\u2014rulers\u2014for measurements. Different specialists use a range of tools. Those working with heavy beams and timbers use a large saw called a serra, while those whose work is more detailed\u2014like the pectinarius, the comb maker\u2014would use a scobina to carve and shape the wood. Some of the tools we use in Rome don\u2019t even look so different than those that you carry today.\n\nYou\u2019ve clearly mastered the art of carpentry, but you mentioned that you still don\u2019t get a lot of respect from the city\u2019s wealthy elite. Why is that?\n\nLife in this Empire is guided by social structures, especially in the city of Rome. You can find everyone from the lowest slave to the emperor himself here.\n\nWork for us carpenters, while we are free citizens, revolves around serving the wealthy ruling class. Not all of them are patricians. In fact, the majority of the men in the Senate come from plebeian families. Still, those at the top are so caught up in the scandal and intrigue of the palace, their constant power struggles, and avoiding any real work that they hardly have time to notice the carpenters building their villas.\n\n2,000 years from now, what should people remember about carpenters in the Roman Empire?\n\nI am sure that nowhere else in the world is there a carpentry practice as advanced as what we have here in Rome right now. I\u2019m willing to bet it stays that way for quite a while. I hope that we Roman carpenters are remembered as highly skilled craftsmen who took great pride in the detail and execution of our work."}, {"url": "https://marvelousvideos.com/john-carpenters-the-thing/", "page_content": "When John Carpenter directed this famous sci-fi horror thriller, he was only 34 years old. Many have lauded it as the best film in the genre over time, with credit going to John Carpenter\u2019s direction, Rob Bottin\u2019s fantastically horrific creature effects, and class acting from Kurt Russell and others.\n\nThe dark topic and grim aspects of claustrophobia, mistrust, and paranoia were not well received by critics and audiences when The Thing was initially released. They were also critical of the film\u2019s monster, which many felt was too visceral and forced.\n\nPeople became more used to sci-fi as time passed, and they recognised the film\u2019s originality and ingenuity. Quentin Tarantino, Neill Blomkamp, and Guillermo del Toro, among others, have cited John Carpenter\u2019s The Thing as a source of inspiration. The film is based on the novella Who Goes There by John W. Campbell.\n\nThe Thing From Another World, a black-and-white sci-fi film based on Campbell\u2019s work, was released in 1951, however it was just a loose adaptation. When John Carpenter was approached to produce a remake, he decided to stay true to the source material and, as a result, did Campbell\u2019s book justice.\n\nWe\u2019ll take you on an exciting behind-the-scenes tour of this fantastic film in this video, and we\u2019ll tell you facts that are as fascinating as the film itself. So get your winter coats on, turn down the lights, and prepare to be introduced to John Carpenter\u2019s The Thing.\n\nTobe Hooper\u2019s Moby Dick from Antarctica vs. John Carpenter\u2019s Shapeshifter\n\nDavid Foster and Lawrence Turman first discussed filming The Thing in the 1970s, when they wanted to adapt John W. Campbell\u2019s novella Who Goes There. Universal obtained the rights soon after, but it would be a few years before production could begin.\n\nCo-producer Stuart Cohen\u2019s first option was John Carpenter, but Carpenter was just an independent director with no experience with big-budget monster movies in 1976. Universal, understandably, did not want Carpenter to direct the film, preferring instead Tobe Hooper, who had recently filmed The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.\n\nHooper failed to impress the producers because his idea of the film was totally different from what was desired. In Stuart Cohen\u2019s own words, Hooper wanted to make the film more like Moby Dick of Antarctica with an Ahab-like character who would battle a huge beast.The major issues with Hooper\u2019s outlook of The Thing were that the monster wouldn\u2019t shapeshift, and the prime themes of paranoia and suspicion were missing.\n\nIt was 1979, and John Carpenter had already given moviegoers the famous smash Halloween in 1978, and Ridley Scott\u2019s 1979 Alien had been a huge hit. These events reignited talk about The Thing at Universal, and they decided to move ahead with Mr. Carpenter this time.\n\nJohn Carpenter was apprehensive about taking the job because he wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d be able to top Howard Hawks\u2019 1951 film The Thing From Another World. Carpenter was such a fan of Hawks that in his film Halloween two of the characters, Tommy and Laurie, watch The Thing From Another World. A few years later, he was actually directing The Thing. That\u2019s some coincidence.\n\nThe Cast Almost Died On Their Way To Filming\n\nThe producers hoped that the majority of the filming had taken place on sets, but Carpenter was a perfectionist. He insisted on using real settings, and he had an advantage because to the tremendous success of his earlier picture Halloween. The bosses wanted to conserve money, but Carpenter eventually won them over.\n\nThe cast and crew were scheduled to travel to a spot along the Canadian coast for the shoot. They travelled from Los Angeles to Vancouver, but terrible weather prevented them from flying any further. The final step of the journey required taking a bus.\n\nThe six-hour ride turned out to be one of the scariest moments for all of them when the bus slid on the snowy road towards the unprotected side of the road. Had the bus fallen down, they\u2019d have crashed in a 500-foot deep embankment. Thankfully, the driver regained control of the bus, and everyone was safe. However, most of the interior scenes were shot in a refrigerated soundstage.\n\nRob Bottin and His Deadly Dedication\n\nBottin was only 21 when he joined Carpenter\u2019s team, but he and Carpenter had previously collaborated on the 1980 picture The Fog. Carpenter intended The Thing to be a singular creature, whereas Bottin wanted it to be a constantly developing beast. Bottin was in charge of a 35-person crew during the design phase, which he hadn\u2019t done before, but he hadn\u2019t worked on a big-budget film either.\n\nBottin had a big hand in the design of the Thing. For example, it was his idea to give the monster shapeshifting abilities such as the ability to turn chests into huge mouths with razor-sharp fangs or the ability to grow spider legs from a person\u2019s head.\n\nHe explained that the Thing got these abilities as a result of thousands of years of evolution and traveling to different parts of the galaxy.Carpenter ultimately accepted Bottin\u2019s ideas because they did not depict the creature as a guy in a suit.\n\nOnce the designs were finalized, Bottin started the task of bringing them to life. He was furiously dedicated to his craft and spent almost a year working rigorously: he would sleep on the sets or in locker rooms and it\u2019s not difficult to understand that a 21-year-old can fail to take care of himself.\n\nIn the final few days, he had to be hospitalized for exhaustion, bleeding ulcers, and double pneumonia. It was now that Bottin sought the help of legendary creature designer Stan Winston. It was Winston who created the Dog Thing but didn\u2019t accept credit for his work and maintained that Bottin was the one who deserved it. Ultimately, Stan Winston was thanked in the credits for his immense and timely assistance.\n\nThe Dog Thing and The Double Amputee\n\nAs previously stated, Stan Winston volunteered to assist Bottin and Carpenter create the Dog Thing during the last stages of creation. Winston chose a hand puppet over a more complex mechanical monster since he had less time on his hands.\n\nThe dog was to be played by make-up artist Lance Anderson, thus a clay cast of his head and legs was produced. The eyes were operated by radio, and the countless tentacles were controlled by cable from beneath the dog kennel.\n\nThe dog thing was being shot at, if you recall. Anderson had to wear a helmet to shield himself from the gunfire-stimulating explosive squibs. The moment ended up being one of the best in the movie.\n\nAnother peculiar and interesting part was the chest chomp scene in which Norris turns out to be the Thing. Dr. Copper attempts to revive Norris using a defibrillator on his chest. In doing so, Norris\u2019s chest opens up and takes the form of a huge mouth with sharp teeth that chomp Dr. Copper\u2019s hands. Bottin was the mind behind this imaginative scene.\n\nHe called in a double amputee body double and fixed two fake arms on his shoulders, and these were made out of wax, rubber, and Jell-o. The arms were placed inside the mechanical mouth and as the teeth sunk into the arms, the body double moved away. This gave the idea that the arms of Dr. Copper were chopped off.\n\nThe Thing About Dynamites, Kurt Russell and John Carpenter\n\nIt\u2019s a well-known truth that John Carpenter enjoys things that are authentic. Kurt Russell\u2019s character throws a stick of dynamite at Palmer in the Palmer Thing sequence. The dynamite was genuine, which may surprise you.\n\nThe explosive detonates, and MacReady is blasted back. Kurt Russel knew the dynamite stick was real, but he had no idea how powerful it was. He was blasted back by the explosion after failing to move out of the blast radius. Fortunately, he was not seriously injured.\n\nThe entire incident was captured on film, and Carpenter considered it to be incredibly compelling, so he decided to include it in the movie. Apart from the bus accident, this was another near-fatal accident related to The Thing.\n\nCarpenter seems to be the master of improvisation and shifting. In the initial few minutes of the film, we are taken to a burned-down Norwegian base. Strangely, this was the last sequence to be shot.\n\nCarpenter and his crew didn\u2019t wish to spend more money for an entirely new Norwegian base. So, after the American base was actually blown up and destroyed at the film\u2019s end, what was left of the base was used to shoot the initial sequence.\n\nThe Extraterrestrial Stole The Thing\u2019s Thunder\n\nCarpenter was apprehensive about how the audience would react to the final product when he took over the project. But as the shoot progressed, he grew more confident. The Thing lacked humour and comedy as a film, but it made up for it with other potent ingredients such as revolutionary paranoia, stunning visual effects, and a sense of endless loneliness and helplessness.\n\nHowever, it was released only two weeks after Steven Spielberg\u2019s 1982 film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. While Spielberg\u2019s film featured a friendly alien, Carpenter\u2019s featured a savage one who was murdering people and plotting to take over the planet. E.T. had a happy ending, while The Thing\u2019s left people scratching their heads.\n\nNaturally, these contrasts got reflected in the way audiences perceived the two films. Carpenter\u2019s fell flat on its face, at least in the initial days after release. The kid-friendly E.T appealed more to the parents as well. However, as time passed, The Thing earned a little short of $20 million.\n\nThe Cold Reaction of Critics\n\nThe tHing received a cold reception from critics and sci-fi lovers alike, not just general audiences. Although the special effects were praised for their technical brilliance, they were also criticised for being overly forceful and visually loud.\n\nAlmost none of these critics could grasp the film\u2019s entire use of paranoia and distrust, despite the fact that these elements were among the most important in making the picture a classic in the future. While some thought it was a funny Alien rip-off, others thought the violence was forced and needless.\n\nWe are of the opinion that John Carpenter\u2019s The Thing was an untimely masterpiece- critics had never seen anything so brilliant and failed to comprehend that brilliance. Years later, if we are making a video dedicated to this sci-fi horror classic, it is solely because it deserves respect.\n\nThe Characters Were Killed In More Ways Than One\n\nFor a variety of reasons, several scenes were cut from the script. They\u2019d have too much dialogue at points, which would slow the tempo and lessen the element of suspense, and they\u2019d be eliminated from the screenplay at other times because they were too pricey.\n\nIn addition, despite the fact that the jump-scare scenes from Carpenter\u2019s Halloween have been duplicated in numerous horror films, he wanted to stay away from tropes like this. Several other scenes were also added to the film that were not part of the original script. MacReady\u2019s monologue was included in this.\n\nFuchs\u2019s charred remains are found and hint that he died off-screen. But in an alternate scene, his body was impaled on a wall with a shovel. Nauls simply disappears in the film, but in the script, he was to appear as a huge mass filled with tentacles; something on the lines of the Dog Thing.\n\nBennings\u2019 death probably saw the most number of changes. Bennings was scripted to be pulled under the ice by the alien, and then he was to appear at different parts of the film with successively progressed stages of assimilation. However, he was simply filmed as being killed by an unknown person.\n\nThis didn\u2019t throw light on how assimilation kills the victim. So, Bennings was fitted with rubber tentacles and monster gloves and then they covered him in K.Y. Jelly and orange dye. By doing this, Carpenter could show the effects of partial assimilation.\n\nJohn Carpenter\u2019s The Thing is More Than a Remake\n\nChristian Nyby and Howard Hawks released The Thing From Another World in 1951, based on John W. Campbell\u2019s 1938 novella \u201cWho Goes There.\u201d The Thing by John Carpenter and Nyby\u2019s film are based on the same source material, although they are totally distinct films.\n\nThe primary plot of Nyby\u2019s film is based on a novella about a group of scientists discovering an alien life form in an ice setting, but Nyby converted it into a monster movie starring James Arness as a giant extraterrestrial monster.\n\nCarpenter didn\u2019t want to compete with the Nyby-Hawks film because he respected it too much. So, Carpenter stuck to the novella\u2019s original story and focussed on the compelling idea that the alien can shapeshift into any living creature around it.\n\nJohn read the novella a few times and drew parallels between it and Agatha Christie\u2019s 1939 mystery novel And Then There Were None. Christie\u2019s classic was also made into a 2015 television series and dealt with a group of ten eccentric strangers invited into a mansion.\n\nUpon arrival, they were treated with darkness and soon, bodies started piling up. The surviving guests realize that there\u2019s a killer among them. Naturally, Carpenter made a gruelingly grim film by blending both pieces of literature.\n\nTo appreciate The Thing, it is crucial to grasp and embrace that darkness. Something that the critics back in 1982 failed to do.\n\nPost Production Pressure and Publicity Stunts\n\nProducer David Foster went to see E.T. since the movie would be preceded by a trailer for The Thing, and he wanted to see how the public reacted. He was discouraged by the frigid response, which mirrored the film\u2019s cold environment.\n\nAs a last-ditch effort to rekindle public interest, a slew of adjustments were made to the film\u2019s publicity. They switched from a black-and-white to a coloured poster.\n\nThe tagline for Alien was coined by Stephen Frankfort, who said, \u201cIn space, no one can hear you scream.\u201d He also came up with the original tagline for Carpenter\u2019s The Thing, which was \u201cMan is the warmest place to hide.\u201d\n\nBut the executives wanted to exhaust and capitalize on the popularity of Ridley Scott\u2019s Alien. So, they changed the tagline to \u201cThe ultimate in alien terror.\u201d The famous horror Magazine Fangoria held a drawing contest in 1981 and asked people to draw what the Thing would look like. The winners would earn a trip to Universal Studios. John attempted to get the title of the film changed from The Thing to Who Goes There but it was too late.\n\nInterestingly, the winning submission of the Fangoria contest was uploaded on Instagram in 2018. It doesn\u2019t resemble anything like what was shown in the film, but we can not deny that this was a terrifying alien. It looks as if Medusa mated with a Xenomorph.\n\nThe Alternate Ending That Never Came To Life\n\nThe Thing\u2019s ending is unmistakably dark and ambiguous, which raised a few eyebrows, the most concerned of which was editor Todd Ramsey. He asked John Carpented to shoot a different conclusion, one that was less dismal and happier.\n\nJohn consented, and he filmed a sequence in which MacReady was eventually rescued and transported to a room where he was given a blood test to determine whether or not he was infected. The film ends after MacReady passes the test. This scene, on the other hand, never saw the light of day, and it\u2019s probably for the best.\n\nWe believe the entire objective of the video was to demonstrate that the all-male crew had no idea what was going on or who was their ally and who was their foe. And, Carpenter wanted to make his audience feel exactly what the characters were feeling, a sense of morbid confusion, suspicion, and ambiguity."}, {"url": "https://hbr.org/2019/07/marvels-blockbuster-machine", "page_content": "Idea in Brief The Problem In the movie business, sequels seldom perform as well as the originals\u2014with critics or commercially. That makes it very difficult to create a franchise. Why It Happens When making sequels, filmmakers err on the side of caution in balancing continuity with renewal. As a result, they experience diminishing returns. The Solution The Marvel Cinematic Universe, perhaps the most successful franchise of all time, strikes the right balance by (1) selecting for experienced inexperience, (2) leveraging a stable core, (3) continually challenging the formula, and (4) cultivating customers\u2019 curiosity.\n\nIn just a decade Marvel Studios has redefined the franchise movie. Its 22 films have grossed some $17 billion\u2014more than any other movie franchise in history. At the same time, they average an impressive 84% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes (the average for the 15 top-grossing franchises is 68%) and receive an average of 64 nominations and awards per movie. Avengers: Endgame,released in the spring, has won rave reviews and generated so much demand that online movie ticket retailers had to overhaul their systems to manage the number of requests.\n\nKevin Feige, the head of Marvel Studios, offered a deceptively simple explanation in Variety: \u201cI\u2019ve always believed in expanding the definition of what a Marvel Studios movie could be. We try to keep audiences coming back in greater numbers by doing the unexpected and not simply following a pattern or a mold or a formula.\u201d The secret seems to be finding the right balance between creating innovative films and retaining enough continuity to make them all recognizably part of a coherent family.\n\nAchieving that balance is far more difficult than it sounds. Just making a movie successful enough to support a franchise is hard: Six of the eight worst-performing big-budget films in 2017 were meant to start new franchises. And even if the first movie does well, the sequels usually don\u2019t: Most franchises see a steady decline in critics\u2019 scores after the first movie, which is ordinarily reflected in their commercial performance. The director of Iron Man, Jon Favreau, has observed, \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to keep these franchises from running out of gas after two [movies]. The high point seems to be the second one, judging by history.\u201d Reinforcing this point, Ed Catmull, Pixar\u2019s CEO, describes movie sequels as a form of \u201ccreative bankruptcy.\u201d That may explain why Pixar has produced sequels for only four films.\n\nRelated Video Loading... Save\n\nSave Share\n\nSo far, Marvel has not had that problem. Twenty-two movies in, the organization is still able to renew the notion of what a Marvel movie can be. When Black Panther was released, in early 2018, setting box office records, critics described it as a \u201csea change\u201d and a \u201croyally imaginative standout\u201d that provided \u201ca vibrant but convincing reality, laced with socially conscious commentary.\u201d As Ty Burr put it in the Boston Globe, \u201cThe movie doesn\u2019t reinvent the superhero genre so much as reclaim and reenergize it\u2014archetypes, clich\u00e9s, and all\u2014for viewers hungry to dream in their own skin\u2026.The film doesn\u2019t feel like the usual corporate franchise contact high but, rather, the work of a singular sensibility.\u201d Yet, as other critics commented, the film was still somehow unmistakably Marvel.\n\nHow and why does Marvel succeed in blending continuity and renewal? To answer that question, we gathered data on each of the 20 Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) movies released through the end of 2018, analyzing 243 interviews and 95 video interviews with producers, directors, and writers, and 140 reviews from leading critics. We digitally analyzed the scripts and the visual style of each movie and examined the networks of 1,023 actors and 25,853 behind-the-camera workers from movie to movie. Our analysis of this data suggests that Marvel\u2019s success is rooted in four key principles: (1) select for experienced inexperience, (2) leverage a stable core, (3) keep challenging the formula, and (4) cultivate customers\u2019 curiosity. In the following pages we will explore these principles, showing not only how Marvel applied them but also how they explain the success of companies in very different domains.\n\n1. Select for Experienced Inexperience\n\nIn movies, whom you hire is a big part of what you get. And as the saying goes, \u201cThe best predictor of future performance is prior performance.\u201d Marvel Studios subverts this maxim in a fascinating way: When hiring directors, it looks for experience in a domain in which Marvel does not have expertise.\n\nOf the 15 MCU directors, only one had experience with the superhero genre (Joss Whedon had helped write the script for the movie X-Men and had created a critically acclaimed comic book arc for Marvel). Instead they had deep knowledge in other genres\u2014Shakespeare, horror, espionage, and comedy. They often came from the indie scene. This experience allowed them to bring a unique vision and tone to each film: Thor: The Dark World has Shakespearean overtones; Ant-Man is a heist film; Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a spy movie; Guardians of the Galaxy is a giddy space opera. What\u2019s more, most of the directors were used to working under tight budgets (their pre-MCU film budgets were about one-seventh the size of their MCU budgets).\n\nA good example is Marvel Studios\u2019 first movie, Iron Man (2008), which was a double bet on Favreau as director and Robert Downey Jr. as lead actor. Favreau came from an indie background with small but critically acclaimed movies, including Swingers, Elf, and Zathura: A Space Adventure. He was known for his ability to build interesting characters and for his smart dialogue. He had no experience working on blockbuster superhero action movies, with their dazzling visual technology. Downey had demonstrated his bona fides as a great actor, perhaps most notably in Chaplin, but he was equally well known for his relapses into drug abuse and had never been cast as a lead in a major action movie. Each brought experience and inexperience, and as a result, according to the Iron Man costar Jeff Bridges, a Hollywood veteran, the production sometimes felt like \u201ca $200 million student film.\u201d\n\nBut the combination worked. The film critic Roger Ebert described the experience portion of the equation this way: \u201cTony Stark is created from the persona Downey has fashioned through many movies: irreverent, quirky, self-deprecating, wise-cracking. The fact that Downey is allowed to think and talk the way he does while wearing all that hardware represents a bold decision by the director, Jon Favreau.\u201d Ebert went on to illustrate the benefit of Favreau\u2019s inexperience with the superhero genre: \u201cA lot of big budget f/x epics seem to abandon their stories with half an hour to go, and just throw effects at the audience. This one has a plot so ingenious it continues to function no matter how loud the impacts, how enormous the explosions.\u201d\n\nMarvel has made similar choices for its other movies. Guardians of the Galaxy was directed by James Gunn, who had made a name for himself with small-budget horror movies. Gunn successfully cast Chris Pratt, the self-described \u201cpet fat guy\u201d from the television comedy Parks and Recreation, as a superhero and built the movie around 1970s songs. Taika Waititi, who came from a background in wacky comedy and character studies and had no superhero genre experience, directed Thor: Ragnarok. He made a point of creating distance from the first two Thor movies and pitched the new movie as a sizzle reel overlaid with Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cImmigrant Song.\u201d The New York Post\u2019s critic observed, \u201c[Waititi], arriving with a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of tiny and wonderful indies, launches one of Marvel\u2019s blandest characters on a candy-colored interplanetary romp\u2026.It\u2019s witty, it\u2019s weird and it goes against decades of bloated, overserious comics fare.\u201d Critics saw it as bringing a welcome dose of self-parody to the MCU.\n\nSuperhero movies were once the kiss of death for actors with artistic ambitions.\n\nMarvel Studios grants directors a large degree of control, especially in areas where they have experience. Favreau, Gunn, and Waititi describe being given surprising freedom and encouragement to make their own thing. In a 2008 interview Favreau said, \u201cWe could sit in the trailer with the Marvel guys, with the producers and the actors, and talk about what the scenes should be based on, what we\u2019ve shot and what we\u2019ve learned, and there\u2019s a flexibility of material, so in a lot of ways there\u2019s a lot of freedom to try things different ways\u2026a real sense of freshness and discovery in this project.\u201d At the same time, Marvel maintains close control over the blockbuster aspects of the movie, providing a lot of direction on special effects and logistics. Feige explained in 2013, \u201cWhen we bring in the filmmaker, it\u2019s to help us do something different with all of those resources.\u201d The combination is potent for both parties: Directors see an average surge of 18 percentage points in their Rotten Tomatoes ratings between their previous film and their MCU film.\n\nThe movie business is not the only industry to take this approach: Energy companies hire meteorologists to help them move toward sustainable energy solutions; hedge funds have hired top-notch chess players with advanced pattern recognition abilities; consulting firms have renewed their offerings by hiring fashion designers and anthropologists. Cirque du Soleil hired Fabrice Becker, who had won an Olympic gold medal in freestyle skiing for France at the 1992 Winter Olympics, as its creative director. Patagonia\u2019s founder, Yvon Chouinard, said in a 1992 profile in Inc., \u201cI\u2019ve found that rather than bring in businessmen and teach them to be dirt bags, it\u2019s easier to teach dirt bags to do business.\u201d For Patagonia the \u201cdirt bag\u201d experience\u2014frugally pursuing outdoor sports with a passion\u2014provides deep knowledge of customers, products, and ways to convert others to a sustainable viewpoint.\n\nA good example is provided by Outfit7, one of the fastest-growing multinational family-entertainment companies on the planet, founded by eight Slovenians. It is best known for its worldwide phenomenon Talking Tom, whose apps top the global charts with close to 10 billion downloads. When a group of Asian investors acquired the company, they appointed the 32-year-old \u017diga Vavpoti\u010d as chairman of the board. Vavpoti\u010d had joined Outfit7 in 2014 and claimed never to have downloaded a computer game before. But he did have deep expertise working in NGOs and with social entrepreneurs. The mix of technological inexperience and entrepreneurial experience allowed him to focus on the scaling-up process without getting bogged down in debates about technology.\n\nFew companies are prepared to take this sort of gamble. Research on employee onboarding shows that most either select for experience that overlaps with their existing knowledge base or\u2014even when selecting for experience that does not\u2014become so preoccupied with socializing the new employee that they effectively neuter the value of his or her outside expertise. They\u2019re missing a significant opportunity, as Marvel has demonstrated.\n\n2. Leverage a Stable Core\n\nTo balance the new talent, voices, and ideas it brings into each movie, Marvel holds on to a small percentage of people from one to the next. The stability they provide allows Marvel to build continuity across products and create an attractive community for fresh talent.\n\nWe compared overlap between movies in the staff of the core creative group (typically about 30 people for each film) with overlap in the full crew (about 2,500 people) and found significantly more in the core. On average, about 25% of a core group overlaps from one movie to the next (with a range of 14% to 68%), and the full crew averages an overlap of 14% (with a range of 2% to 33%). Predictably, movies in a series exhibit more core-group overlap: For example, from Captain America: The Winter Soldier to Captain America: Civil War it was 68%, and from Iron Man to Iron Man 2 it was 55%.\n\nA stable core supports renewal, because it exerts a kind of gravitational effect. People not in the core are keen to join it. For example, superhero movies were once seen as the kiss of death for actors with high artistic ambitions. But Academy Award winners such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Anthony Hopkins, Forest Whitaker, and Lupita Nyong\u2019o have all played roles in the MCU. Cate Blanchett, another Oscar winner, described in a 2017 interview what she liked about joining the MCU: \u201cVery early on, I threw a lot of ideas into the ring with Taika and with the Motion Capture people and the Special Effects crew and then they took [my ideas] and ran with [them]. It\u2019s like what if I shot this out? What if I play with my cape? Could stuff come out of that?\u201d\n\nIn hindsight, these actors\u2019 attraction to the reach and resources of the world\u2019s most successful cinematic universe may not seem surprising. But the gravitational pull seems to have been there from the start. Interviewed on the set of the first Iron Man, Paltrow said she had \u201csigned in blood\u201d for three movies\u2014something she had never done before. Actors such as Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, and the leads of Guardians of the Galaxy have echoed her reasons for doing so in interviews: They feel invited and empowered to \u201cdo their thing,\u201d to explore and collaborate in building nuanced and interesting characters. Yet another Academy Award winner, Brie Larson, signed up for seven movies as Captain Marvel.\n\nEven collaborators who may have had a negative experience with Marvel seem open to returning. Zak Penn, a renowned screenplay writer (who cowrote Steven Spielberg\u2019s Ready Player One), provides a case in point. Recruited to write the script for The Incredible Hulk, he ended up having to fight over screenplay credits with the film\u2019s lead actor, Edward Norton. Penn then spent several years writing a screenplay for The Avengers, only to have Whedon come on board as the director and subsequently rewrite it from scratch. Many creatives would refuse future collaborations after experiences like those. Yet Penn is reportedly writing a top-secret screenplay for Marvel.\n\nThe top soccer clubs in the UEFA Champions League during the past decade have prospered with a similar approach. Barcelona in its period of world dominance (2008\u20132015) maintained continuity by growing young stars from its own academy and keeping the central line of the team year after year while incorporating new stars (Luis Su\u00e1rez, Neymar) to complement the core group. Real Madrid had traditionally paid big money to bring in superstars, so-called gal\u00e1cticos. After 2003 this strategy backfired as the club repeatedly struggled to reach the final stages of the Champions League. Then the club switched to an approach like Barcelona\u2019s, growing a core of young players mixed with stars and intermediate players and a stable management team led by Zinedine Zidane, a former player. Real Madrid went on to win the Champions League an unprecedented three times in a row (2016\u20132018). Its starting lineup was almost exactly the same each season, making it the most stable top club in all Europe. Stability allowed both clubs to better absorb new supporting players.\n\nAn example from a different field is Broken Social Scene, a band that acts more like a \u201cmusical collective.\u201d It started as a duo, but its albums include collaborating artists from other bands who rotate in and out of Broken Social Scene. For example, the group\u2019s second album featured 11 musical artists. Eight years later it released an album that featured 28. The original duo acts as the core, and the other artists act as the periphery.\n\nBusiness organizations such as 3M and Nestl\u00e9 embrace a similar strategy. Their classic organizational structures are overlaid with networks of teams, and the networks are monitored to ensure steady evolution\u2014new members enter and others leave. Organizations that preserve the core, revitalize the periphery, and understand relationship networks can enable renewal, dynamism, and flexibility. They can attract an influx of new ideas while enabling continuity by keeping the overall organizational structure almost intact.\n\n3. Keep Challenging the Formula\n\nOrganizations are often loath to abandon what made a creative product successful. But Marvel Studios\u2019 directors all speak about a willingness to let go of the winning ingredients in prior MCU movies. Peyton Reed, the director of Ant-Man and the Wasp, spoke in 2018 about how his movie departed from those that directly preceded it (Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War): \u201cWe wanted to [be] in the crime genre in terms of structure and looking to stuff like Elmore Leonard novels and movies like Midnight Run and After Hours\u2026. We always knew we were coming out after Panther and Infinity War\u2026. We all felt like, \u2018Okay\u2026.This feels organic to what we were already doing, but it\u2019ll also be a stark contrast to what came before.\u2019\u201d\n\nTo determine whether this was more than lip service, we analyzed all the movies in the MCU to see if there was evidence of their being formulaic. Were people really just watching the same movie over and over again?\n\nAt first the answer seemed to be yes. All MCU movies deliver superheroes, villains, and a third act featuring climactic battles that often rely heavily on computer-generated effects. Each movie also has a cameo appearance by the late Stan Lee, the writer of many of the original comic books. But a closer inspection revealed something more complex. We experience movies through the drama they generate as well as the visual story they tell. To understand those dimensions, we conducted a computerized text analysis of the script of each movie and a visual analysis of its images. We also analyzed the elements that leading critics singled out as somehow challenging or renewing the superhero movie genre. Our goal was to get a deeper look at whether the movies differed in terms of their dramatic, visual, and narrative elements.\n\nOur script analysis reveals that Marvel movies showcase differing emotional tones (the balance between positive and negative emotion verbally expressed by the characters). For example, Iron Man 2 contains a lot of humor, including a scene in which Nick Fury tells Iron Man, who is sitting inside a large doughnut that acts as a sign for a diner, \u201cSir, I\u2019m going to have to ask you to exit the doughnut!\u201d In contrast, the next movie, Thor, which centers on Thor\u2019s disappointing his father and being cast out of his presence, is darker and sadder.\n\nThe movies are also visually different. The largest variations include those from Captain America: The Winter Soldier to Guardians of the Galaxy to Avengers: Age of Ultron. The plots of the first and the third take place on Earth, whereas Guardians takes place in space and on alien planets.\n\nFurthermore, the movies that achieve the highest critical (and audience) ratings are the very ones that are viewed as violating the superhero genre. The Incredible Hulk and the first two Thor movies are variously described by critics as \u201cboringly formulaic\u201d and \u201conly involving for the very young\u201d; the audience is \u201chammered with one clich\u00e9 after the other\u201d and with an exhaustive \u201cvisual extravaganza.\u201d By contrast, the critics found Iron Man notable for introducing realism and unusual depth and authenticity in the main character, Guardians of the Galaxy for its refreshing use of 1970s songs and its celebration of misfits, Doctor Strange for its artsy visuals and brainy tone, Spider-Man: Homecoming for inviting fantasies of neighborhood responsibility rather than intergalactic ultraviolence, and Black Panther for its social commentary and characters with political consciousness.\n\nNot only do audiences appear to tolerate Marvel\u2019s constant experimentation, but it has become a critical element of the MCU experience: Fans go to the next film looking for something different. In contrast, franchises that have stuck closer to a winning formula run into trouble when they attempt to renew themselves.\n\nTake Star Wars: The Last Jedi. It was critically acclaimed for visuals that were strikingly different from those of earlier movies in the franchise and for a willingness to break with the dramatic arc of prior movies. But long-loving fans of the franchise saw these violations as unacceptable\u2014a sacrilege. Consequently, more than 100,000 of them signed a petition on Change.org asking Disney to strike the film from the Star Wars canon. Actors portraying some of the new characters were harassed and bullied online. Star Wars movies had followed a formula that limited directors\u2019 ability to offer innovations to the audience. Trying something new led to a backlash because the franchise\u2019s fans hadn\u2019t been looking for anything new.\n\nWhat the MCU experience shows is that franchises benefit from continual experimentation. This lesson seems to hold outside the movie business as well. For instance, the Spanish clothing retailer Zara constantly releases short runs of new clothes based on recent trends, often from haute couture fashion houses. Zara\u2019s competitors expect their customers to visit two or three times a year, but Zara\u2019s customers may visit up to five times as often, because they expect the new offerings to violate the assumptions of the old.\n\n4. Cultivate Customer Curiosity\n\nAt its best, Marvel Studios provokes an intense interest in characters, plotlines, and entirely new worlds. Its whole universe has the feel of a puzzle that anyone can engage with. Moviegoers become active participants within a larger experience.\n\nMarvel cultivates curiosity in several ways. One is by engaging customers indirectly as coproducers through social media interactions. This approach is rooted in a long Marvel tradition of supporting the growth of fan communities by, for example, including letters columns at the back of comic books. The columns allowed fans to perform in public and creators to respond to fan feedback. Continuing this tradition, Favreau and other Marvel directors make a point of using social media to stay in touch with the hard-core fan base of comic books, picking up insights from chat rooms and message boards.\n\nMarvel systematically builds anticipation for its coming films by putting \u201cEaster eggs\u201d in its current releases that suggest a future product without giving away the story. The most obvious example is its famous post-credits scenes. The first of these was shown at the end of Iron Man, where S.H.I.E.L.D.\u2019s Nick Fury, played by Samuel L. Jackson, is introduced, suggesting to fans that Iron Man may be part of a larger universe. The movies also present semiconcealed onscreen elements and references that only die-hard fans will notice\u2014or story lines and character development that play out across several movies and products. For example, the Infinity Gauntlet, a weapon that figures heavily in the 19th film, can be seen in the background in Thor, the fourth film. A similarly important weapon, the Staff of the Living Tribunal, was casually introduced in Doctor Strange and may foreshadow the presence of a new character\u2014named the Living Tribunal\u2014in future movies. In Thor: The Dark World a chalkboard is filled with equations, one of which references a comic book arc about Doctor Strange\u2019s trapping the Incredible Hulk, potentially foreshadowing a plot twist.\n\nThe Stars in Marvel\u2019s Cinematic Universe The distribution of key characters across 22 feature films illustrates a balance between continuity and renewal.\n\n\n\nDevoted comic book fans are given countless other nods, along with hidden and overt references to other movies, internal or external to the universe. Critics and commentators are quick to pick up the more obvious ones, including inspirations from Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Maltese Falcon, and Star Wars in Guardians of the Galaxy and the many allusions to James Bond movies in Black Panther. For dedicated fans, a host of blogs and specialized sites offer opportunities for much more engagement. Black Panther alone has several dozen such sites, where people comment on everything from comic book visuals, an overt reference to the self-lacing sneakers in Back to the Future Part II, allusions to African culture, and the significance of the opening scene in Oakland (where the director, Ryan Coogler, grew up, and the group the Black Panthers originated) to subtle (or not) nods to Wales\u2019s independence and Trump\u2019s wall against Mexico.\n\nOther organizations, too, have grown their innovation universes by curating a sense of mystery and curiosity. The notion of Easter eggs originated in the 1979 video game Adventure and has since expanded to other video games, comics, home media, and software products. Google uses this mechanism to spark playfulness in workers, and it recently celebrated the 20th anniversary of its search engine with a series of nostalgia-inducing Easter eggs.\n\nNike\u2019s Jordan brand generates curiosity with hidden features in each new release of its shoes\u2014Braille dots on the tongue spelling out \u201cJordan,\u201d a window providing a glimpse of a carbon fiber shank, quotations about overcoming failure laser-etched on the sole. Indeed, Nike uses many of the strategies Marvel does\u2014details that link products together, secrecy before product launches, and a broad-based online consumer network that provides feedback and, in Nike\u2019s case, allows customers early access to limited-run sneakers.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nMost approaches to sustaining creativity and innovation focus on building a culture or following a process. Those approaches are useful, but they miss a key fact: In many contexts a successful product imposes constraints on what might follow. The four Marvel Cinematic Universe principles will help companies move beyond those constraints\u2014but they must be applied as a whole. Selecting for experienced inexperience (principle #1) without a strong, sustained commitment to challenging the formula (principle #3) and a stable core crew (principle #2) will mean only that the people you get won\u2019t be able to do what you want them to do. Similarly, a lack of commitment to challenging the formula (principle #3) will undermine the potential for cultivating customer curiosity (principle #4): Clever Easter eggs cannot compensate for a formulaic movie or a dull product line. If a company succeeds in firing on all these cylinders at once, it will build a sustainable and ever-renewing innovation engine."}], "Carpenter was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best British Screenplay in 1967.": [{"url": "https://www.bafta.org/film/awards/2022-nominations-winners", "page_content": "Explore the nominations and winners for the 2022 EE British Academy Film Awards, celebrating the very best in film of the past year.\n\nScroll down to view the full list, or click images below to reveal category nominations.\n\nThe EE BAFTAs took place on Sunday 13 March will be broadcast on the BBC in the UK and around the world.\n\nEE Rising Star Award | How to watch the Awards where you are | Further information for press & media"}, {"url": "https://www.bafta.org/television/awards/tv-2022", "page_content": "Explore the winners of the 2022 Virgin Media British Academy Television Awards and the British Academy Television Craft Awards.\n\nScroll past the gallery for the lists in full.\n\nThe Virgin Media BAFTA TV Awards take place on Sunday 8 May on BBC One at 18.00 BST, hosted by Richard Ayoade.

Any concerns that there would not be a sufficient number of strong contenders to populate the award proved wide of the mark, and few would begrudge a nomination to any of the titles that emerged from the complicated two-step nominating process.\n\nFor this endlessly intriguing category, the top five titles in round one \u2014 voted by the large opt-in British chapter \u2014 are automatically nominated. Last year those are presumed to be The Father, Promising Young Woman, The Mauritanian, Rocks and then Saint Maud or The Dig. Then a jury picks five more titles \u2014 out of the films that land in places 6-20 in the votes by the British chapter. Last year the jury additions were likely to have been His House, Mogul Mowgli, Limbo, Calm With Horses and then Saint Maud or The Dig.\n\nAlthough some titles were clearly among the voters\u2019 five favourites and others were evidently jury additions, overall the 10 nominated films seemed a nicely coherent set, all offering an indie sensibility, and not too wildly contrasting in budget \u2014 at least compared to some recent years when the list of six nominees appeared notably lopsided.\n\nTitles of scale\n\nThis time around, the 10 nominees for outstanding British film may offer bigger contrasts in scope and scale \u2014 especially if Cary Joji Fukunaga\u2019s No Time To Die makes the list. Casino Royale was nominated for this category in 2007, and Skyfall won in 2013 \u2014 back when there were only five nominees, and a totally different nominating process.\n\nBut No Time To Die is not the only major studio film in contention: so too is Ridley Scott\u2019s House Of Gucci, which Bafta has qualified as British \u2014 the essential test being that films must have significant creative involvement by individuals who are British or UK-resident. The $75m-budget film from Bron Studios, Scott Free Productions, MGM and Universal Pictures would certainly throw a glamorous firecracker into the mix. If nominated, Joe Wright\u2019s Cyrano \u2014 based on the Broadway-transferred stage musical of the same name \u2014 would likewise add razzle dazzle.\n\nLess generously budgeted but amply credentialed is Kenneth Branagh\u2019s Belfast, with a cast including Jamie Dornan, Caitriona Balfe, Judi Dench and Ciaran Hinds. Considered a frontrunner across multiple categories for Bafta and Oscar, it would be a shock if not nominated for this particular award. Bafta voters are also likely to rally around The Duke, the final feature from Roger Michell, starring Jim Broadbent and Helen Mirren.\n\nSimilarly, Pablo Larrain\u2019s Spencer, starring Kristen Stewart, is likely to feature across multiple categories, and it has been qualified as British. So too has Rebecca Hall\u2019s Passing \u2014 set and filmed in New York \u2014 another film likely to figure strongly at this year\u2019s awards.\n\nWhat, then, about Edgar Wright\u2019s Last Night In Soho, one of the more ambitious and generously bud\u00adgeted films in the mix this year? Wright\u2019s Shaun Of The Dead was nominated for best British film in 2005, while Baby Driver picked up Bafta nominations for editing (which it won) and sound in 2018. Locksmith Animation\u2019s Disney-distributed Ron\u2019s Gone Wrong is another film with commercial ambition that\u2019s in the mix \u2014 although the best animated film category looks the more likely path to a nomination. Disney has also qualified Cruella as a British film \u2014 the source material and setting are certainly that, but somehow this Hollywood studio-backed film from producers Marc Platt, Andrew Gunn and Kristin Burr, directed by Sydney-born Craig Gillespie, isn\u2019t quite what we picture when considering this particular Bafta category.\n\nFive titles likely to be added by the jury, as long as they make the top 20 in round-one voting, all performed powerfully in this year\u2019s British Independent Film Awards (Bifas) nominations: Aleem Khan\u2019s After Love starring Joanna Scanlan as a woman discovering secrets about her recently deceased husband; Joanna Hogg\u2019s autobiographical The Souvenir: Part II; Sean Durkin\u2019s The Nest, with Jude Law and Carrie Coon; Philip Barantini\u2019s Boiling Point, shot in one continuous take and starring Stephen Graham negotiating a challenging night in his busy restaurant; and Clio Barnard\u2019s Bradford-set romantic drama Ali & Ava, starring Adeel Akhtar and Claire Rushbrook.\n\nHogg\u2019s original The Souvenir, it\u2019s true, picked up a bunch of Bifa nominations, and was then totally shut out at Bafta, but that was back when the outstanding British film category boasted only six nominees. With its expansion to 10, Part II now has a better chance of inclusion.\n\nMarley Morrison\u2019s Sweetheart, which won the Bifa for breakthrough producer (Michelle Antoniades) and breakthrough performance (Nell Barlow) has its best chance in Bafta\u2019s entirely juried outstanding British debut award, where it will face competition from After Love, Passing, Prano Bailey-Bond\u2019s Censor, Aml Ameen\u2019s Boxing Day, Reggie Yates\u2019 Pirates, Aneil Karia\u2019s Surge and more besides. Barantini\u2019s debut feature Villain received a theatrical release into 10 cinemas in February 2020, so Boiling Point will not count as his debut.\n\nEva Husson\u2019s excellent Mothering Sunday, scripted by Alice Birch, produced by Number 9 Films and with a cast including Odessa Young, Josh O\u2019Connor, Colin Firth and Olivia Colman, was shut out of the Bifa nominations \u2014 possibly because the 1924-set Graham Swift adaptation felt to those voters as more appropriate for the Baftas. By extension, the film now has its chance to shine, although the category is already looking mighty competitive.\n\nTerence Davies\u2019 Benediction did pick up Bifa nominations (for screenplay and costume design), and a sympathetic jury could well add it for this award \u2014 although the film is most admired for Jack Lowden\u2019s performance as First World War poet Siegfried Sassoon. Similarly, Harry Wootliff\u2019s True Things was Bifa-nominated for actress Ruth Wilson, and it\u2019s quite possible the Bafta jury will be pulled in its direction. Wootliff was nominated for outstanding debut in 2020 for her feature Only You.\n\nAlso nominated for outstanding debut \u2014 and in fact the winner of that category in 2019 \u2014 was Beast, written and directed by Michael Pearce. The filmmaker returns with the US-set Encounter, starring Riz Ahmed as a former marine who whisks away his young sons from the home of his ex-partner to save them from an alien invasion of parasitic micro-organisms. The Amazon-backed film has not landed as a major force this awards season, and Ahmed in actor has the best shot at a nomination.\n\nWill Sharpe\u2019s The Electrical Life Of Louis Wain is provoking mixed responses, and faces the challenge that lead actor Benedict Cumberbatch is strongly in the awards mix for another title: Jane Campion\u2019s The Power Of The Dog.\n\nOperation Mincemeat, John Madden\u2019s tale of Second World War derring-do, has plenty of Bafta-appealing credentials, including a cast led by Colin Firth and Matthew Macfadyen; the film has been deemed eligible for this year\u2019s awards despite a late move to an April release. Christian Schwochow\u2019s Munich: The Edge Of War starring George MacKay, Jannis Niew\u00f6hner and Jeremy Irons may not hold quite enough sway with either voters or jury. Then there is Claire McCarthy\u2019s The Colour Room, about pioneering ceramic artist Clarice Cliff and starring Phoebe Dynevor and Matthew Goode \u2014 which may be considered a tad too conventional to go the distance at Bafta.\n\nTrue love\n\nLast year, no documentaries made it onto the 10-strong nominee list for outstanding British film, but in 2020 For Sama was nominated, as was McQueen in 2019 and Notes On Blindness in 2017. This year, Andrea Arnold\u2019s Cow might find favour with the jury \u2014 the director was nominated for this category twice before, in 2010 with Fish Tank (which won) and in 2017 with American Honey. Or maybe the jury will prefer the film that won the best British documentary Bifa: Paul Sng and Celeste Bell\u2019s Poly Styrene: I Am A Clich\u00e9 \u2014 as long as it first makes the top 20 in the category in round one voting. As always, just getting the attention of voters can be half the battle."}, {"url": "https://www.bafta.org/film/awards/2021-nominations-winners", "page_content": "Explore the nominations and winners for the 2021 EE British Academy Film Awards, celebrating the very best in film of the past year.\n\nScroll down to view the full list, or click images below to reveal category nominations.\n\nThe EE BAFTAs took place the weekend of 10 and 11 April 2021 and was broadcast across the BBC in the UK and around the world.\n\nEE Rising Star Award | Read the official awards brochure | How to watch the Awards where you are | Photo gallery | Additional documentation for press & media"}, {"url": "https://www.npr.org/2023/02/20/1158270039/all-quiet-wins-7-baftas-including-best-film-at-u-k-film-awards-ceremony", "page_content": "'All Quiet' wins 7 BAFTAs, including best film, at U.K. film awards ceremony\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Vianney Le Caer/Vianney Le Caer/Invision/AP Vianney Le Caer/Vianney Le Caer/Invision/AP\n\nLONDON \u2014 Antiwar German movie \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" won seven prizes, including best picture, at the British Academy Film Awards on Sunday, building the somber drama's momentum as awards season rolls toward its climax at next month's Oscars.\n\nIrish tragicomedy \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" and rock biopic \"Elvis\" took four prizes each.\n\n\"All Quiet,\" a visceral depiction of life and death in the World War I trenches based on Erich Maria Remarque's classic novel, won Edward Berger the best director award. Its other trophies included adapted screenplay, cinematography, best score, best sound and best film not in English.\n\nAustin Butler was a surprise best actor winner for \"Elvis.\" Baz Lurhmann's flamboyant musical also won trophies for casting, costume design and hair and makeup. Cate Blanchett won the best actress prize for orchestral drama \"T\u00e1r.\"\n\nMartin McDonagh's \"Banshees,\" the bleakly comic story of a friendship gone sour, was named best British film.\n\n\"Best what award?\" joked McDonagh of the film, which was shot in Ireland with a largely Irish cast and crew. It has British funding, and McDonagh was born in Britain to Irish parents.\n\n\"Banshees\" also won for McDonagh's original screenplay, and awards for Kerry Condon as best supporting actress and Barry Keoghan for best supporting actor.\n\nThe prizes \u2014 officially the EE BAFTA Film Awards \u2014 are Britain's equivalent of Hollywood's Academy Awards and will be watched closely for hints of who may win at the Oscars on March 12.\n\nMadcap metaverse romp \"Everything Everywhere All at Once,\" the Academy Awards front-runner, was the night's big loser, winning just one prize from its 10 BAFTA nominations, for editing.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Vianney Le Caer/Vianney Le Caer/Invision/AP Vianney Le Caer/Vianney Le Caer/Invision/AP\n\nActor Richard E. Grant was a suave and self-deprecating host \u2014 with support from TV presenter Alison Hammond \u2014 for the ceremony at London's Royal Festival Hall, where the U.K's movie academy heralded its strides to become more diverse but said there was more to be done.\n\nGrant joked in his opening monologue about the infamous altercation between Will Smith and Chris Rock at last year's Oscars.\n\n\"Nobody on my watch gets slapped tonight,\" he said. \"Except on the back.\"\n\nGuests and presenters walking the red carpet on the south bank of the River Thames included Colin Farrell, Ana de Armas, Eddie Redmayne, Brian Cox, Florence Pugh, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Cynthia Erivo, Julianne Moore and Lily James.\n\nHeir to the throne Prince William, who is president of Britain's film and television academy, was in the audience alongside his wife, Kate. William wore a tuxedo with black velvet jacket, while Kate dressed in a floor-length Alexander McQueen dress that she also wore to the 2019 BAFTAs.\n\nHelen Mirren paid tribute to William's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, who died in September. Mirren, who portrayed the late monarch onscreen in \"The Queen\" and onstage in \"The Audience,\" called Elizabeth \"the nation's leading lady.\"\n\nBritain's film academy introduced changes to increase the awards' diversity in 2020, when no women were nominated as best director for the seventh year running and all 20 nominees in the lead and supporting performer categories were white.\n\nThis year there were 11 female directors up for awards across all categories, including documentary and animated films. But just one of the main best-director nominees was female: Gina Prince-Bythewood for \"The Woman King.\"\n\nBAFTA chairperson Krishnendu Majumdar said the academy's soul-searching had been \"a necessary and humbling process.\" He said the \"vital work of leveling the playing field\" would continue.\n\n\"West Side Story\" star Ariana DeBose opened the show by performing \"Sisters are Doin' it for Themselves,\" with an added rap shoutout to some of the nominated women, including Blanchett, Michelle Yeoh and Viola Davis.\n\nBlanchett said it had been \"an extraordinary year for female performers. To be counted among them is really special.\"\n\nIt was a strong year for Irish actors at the BAFTAs, with Deryl McCormack up for the BAFTA Rising Star award \u2014 though he lost out to Emma Mackey \u2013 and Condon, Keoghan, Farrell and Brendan Gleeson all getting acting nominations for \"Banshees.\"\n\nMcCormack hailed the event as \"the Irish BAFTAs.\"\n\n\"It is a small country, but to see the talent that comes out of it is quite amazing,\" he said.\n\nWriter-director Charlotte Wells won the prize for best British debut for the affecting father-daughter drama \"Aftersun.\" Three-time Oscar winner Sandy Powell became the first costume designer to be awarded the academy's top honor, the BAFTA fellowship.\n\nThe harsh world outside showbiz intruded on the awards when Bulgarian journalist Christo Grozev, who works for investigative website Bellingcat, said he was now allowed to attend the awards because of a risk to public security. He features in \"Navalny,\" a film about jailed Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny that won the best documentary BAFTA.\n\n\"Navalny\" producer Odessa Rae dedicated the award to Grozev, \"our Bulgarian nerd with a laptop, who could not be with us tonight because his life is under threat by the Russian government and Vladimir Putin.\"\n\nJamie Lee Curtis, a supporting actress nominee for \"Everything Everywhere,\" said the chance awards season provides to celebrate cinema was more important than who wins.\n\n\"It's a moment of celebration in the midst of everything,\" Curtis told The Associated Press on the red carpet. \"It's hard out there.
