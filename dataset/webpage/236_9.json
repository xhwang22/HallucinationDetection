Get a glimpse into the basic do\u2019s, don\u2019ts and philosophies of software engineering, plus a bit of the history that holds up the field.\n\nCLEAN CODE BY ROBERT C. MARTIN\n\nThis classic software engineering book was written in 2002 by Robert C. Martin, one of the creators of the agile method. The book\u2019s popularity spawned an entire series, also written by Martin, that includes books on clean architecture and clean agile. But it\u2019s Clean Code that has maintained its relevance over the years by focusing on how to write code that is easy to read and maintainable \u2014 not just for the sake of the application, but for other engineers who will work on the code in the future. The book sprinkles in Java code snippet examples to illustrate its points, so it\u2019s especially helpful for beginning Java developers.\n\nBuy: Bookshop, Amazon\n\nTHE MYTHICAL MAN-MONTH BY FREDERICK BROOKS, JR.\n\nThis book suggests best practices for effective project management, like standardizing documentation and tooling across teams and fostering constant team communication \u2014 all of which are still relevant in the workplace today.\n\nAuthor Frederick Brooks, Jr. published the first edition of this book in 1975, practically prehistoric times for books about software project management. The title refers to a phenomenon Brooks observed while managing the development of the S/360 mainframe computer at IBM in the 1960s. The costs of software projects were calculated by how many \u201cman-months\u201d they took to complete \u2014 that is, how many months it would take for a full-time software engineer to finish a project. When projects fell behind, managers solved the problem by adding additional engineers and developers to the team. Brooks pointed out that this practice, counterintuitively, actually delayed projects further because of the cost of training new developers.\n\n\u201cSome people have called the book the \u2018bible of software engineering,\u2019\u201d Brooks said in an interview with Fortune magazine in 2005. \u201cI would agree with that in one respect: that is, everybody quotes it, some people read it, and a few people go by it.\u201d\n\nBuy: Bookshop, Amazon\n\nSoftware Engineering Books on Coding Style\n\nAs a software engineer, there\u2019s no substitute for knowing how to write clean, readable code. These books will steer you toward programming best practices and help you avoid pitfalls that turn codebases into spaghetti code. They\u2019ll also reduce the amount of hair-pulling future engineers will have to suffer through after you\u2019ve left and someone else takes over the codebase.\n\nA PHILOSOPHY OF SOFTWARE DESIGN BY JOHN OUSTERHOUT\n\nWritten by computer science professor and respected software engineer John Ousterhout, A Philosophy of Software Design introduces programming principles that lead to good, maintainable programs, such as finding the right level of abstraction for your code. This 2018 book is a relative newcomer to the software engineering book club, but it\u2019s already a heavyweight contender. It also isn\u2019t tied to a particular programming language, which helps it be less prescriptive and more widely applicable.\n\nBuy: Amazon\n\nCode Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction by Steve McConnell\n\nA practical guide for intermediate software engineers, Code Complete outlines the fundamentals of coding and software construction in a digestible way. This book covers best practices for code organization, variable naming, loop layouts and more programming specifics \u2014 backed with findings from studies in the field. McConnell also provides real-life examples of coding cases, so readers can follow along for practice. The book\u2019s second edition in particular is recommended, as it adds up-to-date practices and examples in relevant programming languages like C++ and Java.\n\nBuy: Bookshop, Amazon\n\nWORKING EFFECTIVELY WITH LEGACY CODE BY MICHAEL C. FEATHERS\n\nFor those who know how to approach legacy code in the right way, untangling it can actually be an exciting adventure. This book helps readers get there by teaching them to use extensive testing to examine and stabilize confusing legacy code. Being asked to update and maintain an existing application that has been humming away in a dusty server for years is not high up on most software engineers\u2019 wish lists, but most engineers have to deal with it at some point in their careers, and this book will make the process of taming legacy code a whole lot smoother.\n\nBuy: Bookshop, Amazon\n\nSoftware Engineering Books on Design Patterns\n\nDesign patterns are one of the most important tools in a software engineer\u2019s tool belt. Picking the right pattern to structure your code gets at the fundamental question of how to put software together and prevent future problems that need fixing.\n\nDESIGN PATTERNS: ELEMENTS OF REUSABLE OBJECT-ORIENTED SOFTWARE BY ERICH GAMMA, RICHARD HELM, RALPH JOHNSON AND JOHN VLISSIDES\n\nThis book covers three \u201ctypes\u201d of design patterns: creational design patterns that allow engineers to initialize new objects in different ways, structural design patterns for different ways of prototyping and behavior design patterns that model different actions. The authors use examples to illustrate the differences between each pattern, which makes it easy for readers to match the right pattern to their situation.\n\nWhile the book was published in 1994, a lifetime ago in the quickly-changing world of software engineering, it\u2019s still relevant and useful for software engineers learning to structure their programs. The four authors \u2014 Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides \u2014 are widely known in the software development world as the Gang of Four, a nickname that underscores the seminal nature of the book.\n\nBuy: Bookshop, Amazon\n\nHEAD FIRST DESIGN PATTERNS BY ERIC FREEMAN and ELISABETH ROBSON\n\nThe authors go through 13 essential patterns, starting with the most widely used ones, and provide plenty of examples to illustrate, explain and examine how to spot programming situations that can best take advantage of the pattern, making for a fun read on software engineering. The authors\u2019 love for design extends beyond the subject matter to the layout of the book, and they take great care to avoid pages that look like walls of text. Instead, reading this book feels like going through a well-designed PowerPoint presentation. It has informative, hand-drawn diagrams and lots of fun illustrations to keep the reader engaged enough to learn everything the book has to offer.\n\nBuy: Bookshop, Amazon\n\nMore on SoftwareLearning UML Diagrams Will Make You a Better Developer\n\nSoftware Engineering Books on DevOps and Security\n\nSoftware engineering teams have realized that the most important software concerns shouldn\u2019t just be talked about \u2014 they should be brought into project planning from the beginning and integrated into the engineering and development lifecycles using automated DevOps processes. That\u2019s why at some companies the traditionally separate DevOps and security teams have started to work together more closely as DevSecOps.\n\nPRO GIT BY SCOTT CHACON AND BEN STRAUB\n\nThis free 2014 book covers most of the Git commands engineers need to know for their day-to-day work in the Git Basics and Git Branching sections. Beyond that, readers can also learn about setting up their own dedicated Git servers and using off-the-shelf Git services. Let\u2019s face it: Git is confusing. That\u2019s why taking a deep dive into the change tracking software\u2019s functionalities can be helpful for software engineers.\n\nFree: Git\n\nTHE DEVOPS HANDBOOK BY GENE KIM, JEZ HUMBLE, PATRICK DEBOIS AND JOHN WILLIS\n\nThis book defines the concept of DevOps by explaining its motivations and goals, and ties those concepts to real-world scenarios by describing DevOps transformations that have taken place at various companies. The authors share many different ways teams can implement DevOps in their workflows, but they also caution teams against trying to change all their processes at once \u2014 it\u2019s better to establish feedback loops and a practice of continuous improvement. DevOps is a relatively new discipline that\u2019s still seeing continuous innovations. In 2021, the authors published a second edition, only a few years after the first edition came out in 2016.\n\nBuy: Bookshop, Amazon\n\nTHE WEB APPLICATION HACKER\u2019S HANDBOOK BY DAFYDD STUTTARD AND MARCUS PINTO\n\nThis book, by web application security experts Dafydd Stuttard and Marcus Pinto, explores the inherent vulnerabilities in web applications and examines different attack vectors commonly used by attackers. New web application vulnerabilities are discovered and patched regularly, but security is still a constant concern because attackers are always looking for new ways to exploit software. At the same time, many well-known and preventable attacks continue to pose threats for websites that weren\u2019t developed with a security mindset. Engineers and developers can learn about the dangers present in each layer of their applications and pick up tips on staying vigilant throughout the development process.\n\nBuy: Bookshop, Amazon\n\nMore on Software5 Git Commands That Don\u2019t Get Enough Hype\n\nSoftware Engineering Books on Front-End Development\n\nSometimes it seems like back-end development gets all the love. While there are plenty of books on back-end coding patterns and architectures, developing code on the front end often feels more like the wild west. Here are some books that provide solid front-end fundamentals and help keep software engineers grounded in a corner of the software world that sees constant technical innovations.\n\nCSS IN DEPTH BY KEITH J. GRANT\n\nThis 2018 book by web developer Keith Grant takes readers through all aspects of the language, starting with the fundamentals and moving into complex concepts like responsive design and scaling up with CSS. There\u2019s not a lot of hand-holding when it comes to using cascading style sheets, the programming language that determines much of a website\u2019s look and feel. Compared with other corners of software development, CSS has seen relatively few changes since its debut in the 1990s. That\u2019s partly because CSS is pretty self-explanatory \u2014 after all, any changes engineers or developers make are instantly reflected on the browser. But for those working on sophisticated, user-facing web applications, CSS can get quite complex and become unmanageably messy if users aren\u2019t careful.\n\nBuy: Bookshop, Amazon\n\nINCLUSIVE DESIGN PATTERNS BY HEYDON PICKERING\n\nThis book helps front-end developers do just that, sharing resources about accessibility standards and giving advice on how to design websites in ways that make incorporating accessibility concerns into the development process easier. Web accessibility still has a long way to go, but engineers and developers have increasingly recognized its importance. It\u2019s not enough to do accessibility audits after a software program is already written \u2014 at that point, it becomes much harder to make any real changes. The best time to think about accessibility is at the beginning, during the design phase before any code is written.\n\nBuy: Amazon\n\nYOU DON\u2019T KNOW JS YET BY KYLE SIMPSON\n\nThis series of books is devoted to the JavaScript language, which powers the modern, interactive web experiences we\u2019ve all come to expect on the web. JavaScript behaves differently from other programming languages. It has a lot of unexpected behaviors that the author, software developer Kyle Simpson, pulls apart and explains. The first book (You Don\u2019t Know JS Yet: Get Started) dives into the history and function of the language, and the other books touch on specific language features, with almost an entire book dedicated to its complex async properties. Regardless of whether you\u2019re a novice programmer or an experienced one, you\u2019ll probably finish the series knowing a lot more about JavaScript than you did before.\n\nFree (First Edition): GitHub\n\nBuy (Second Edition): Bookshop, Amazon\n\nMore on Web AccessibilityHow Web Accessibility Democratizes the Internet\n\nSoftware Engineering Books on Project Management\n\nProject managers specialize in scoping out projects and keeping projects running on track, but software engineers should also be well versed in project management best practices. That\u2019s because running a project successfully is a team effort, and nothing impacts software teams more than setbacks caused by poor project management. These books address common problems that occur when people work together on building software and offer suggestions on how to make it work more smoothly.\n\nRAPID DEVELOPMENT BY STEVE MCCONNELL\n\nThis book leans into the details of project management than The Pragmatic Programmer \u2014 it devotes an entire (necessary) chapter on the perils of estimating software timelines and covers other problems endemic to software projects like scope creep and team building. Steve McConnell is also the author of Code Complete, which rivals Clean Code as engineers\u2019 holy text on coding styles, but in this book he turns his attention to project management styles. Rapid Development was published in 1996 \u2014 before agile \u2014 but McConnell still discusses many different ways of approaching lifecycle planning, ranging from pure waterfall to iterative methods like evolutionary prototyping that resemble agile.\n\nBuy: Bookshop, Amazon\n\nTHE PRAGMATIC PROGRAMMER BY ANDREW HUNT AND DAVID THOMAS\n\nIn this book, the authors cover common issues that can lead the best engineering teams astray. They offer teachings on things like improving team communication to avoid duplicate work or capturing accurate requirements before coding. There\u2019s also some technical advice for engineers, like how to write flexible code or do exception handling properly, but always from a big-picture perspective of how to successfully steer a team through a project.\n\nIn an interview for the book\u2019s 20th publication anniversary last year, authors Andrew Hunt and David Thomas sounded surprised that their book about avoiding common project management and team dynamics problems is still so relevant to software teams working today.\n\n\u201cThe names have changed, the tech has changed \u2014 but the problems, the wrong approaches, the things that cause difficulty are largely identical,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cIt\u2019s still people and we\u2019re still making very similar mistakes that we were making 20 years ago.\u201d\n\nBuy: Bookshop, Amazon\n\nSoftware Engineering Books for Reviewing Computer Science\n\nMany software engineers would prefer to put their computer science textbooks behind them, but it\u2019s not a bad idea to learn more about computer science concepts. These books will help engineers gain more insight into how their programs work under the hood.\n\nCODE: THE HIDDEN LANGUAGE OF COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE BY CHARLES PETZOLD\n\nThis 1999 book by programmer Charles Petzold is for those who have ever stopped in the middle of programming and stared at their laptop, wondering, \u201cHow is this working?\u201d It focuses on the relationship between software and hardware, making readers comfortable with the technical details behind logic gates before moving on to computer memory, processors and operating systems. Petzold manages to do all this without intimidating readers with technical speak \u2014 instead, he relates hardware and software concepts to other types of languages people have invented to communicate, like Morse code and Braille, and helps readers revel in the wonder of these inventions.\n\nBuy: Bookshop, Amazon\n\nTHE ALGORITHM DESIGN MANUAL BY STEVEN SKIENA\n\nThis book by computer science professor Steven Skiena focuses on the origin stories of well-known algorithms like Quicksort, rather than in-depth analysis of their mathematical properties.\n\n\u201cAlgorithms textbooks generally present important algorithms as a fait accompli, obscuring the ideas involved in designing them and the subtle reasons why other approaches fail,\u201d Skiena writes in the book.\n\nInstead, this book tries to show that algorithms are created out of a real need for them, usually after many false starts. Skiena presents \u201cwar stories\u201d about how select algorithms were invented \u2014 by real-world programmers who got stuck when they realized their problem couldn\u2019t be solved with any current solutions, and that they needed to come up with a novel solution on their own.\n\nBuy: Amazon\n\nTHE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE BY BRIAN KERNIGHAN AND DENNIS RITCHIE\n\nWritten by one of the creators of the actual C programming language, Dennis Ritchie, and co-author Brian Kernighan, this book was first published in 1978 and introduces the programming language in a clear and concise way. Because C is such a low-level language, readers can learn about many aspects of programming that are hidden in higher-level programming languages, like memory allocation and garbage collection. It also marks the first appearance of the \u201cHello, World\u201d example program. It can be worthwhile to get to know a programming language really well. For software engineers interested in doing a deep dive into C \u2014 a popular, low-level programming language used in high-performance applications like operating systems and compilers \u2014 this slim volume is a great option.\n\nBuy: Bookshop, Amazon"}, {"url": "https://www.eecs.mit.edu/research/explore-all-research-areas/programming-languages-and-software-engineering/", "page_content": "We develop new approaches to programming, whether that takes the form of programming languages, tools (like compilers), or methodologies (like ways to collect requirements or formulate designs). Advances in these ingredients can improve many aspects of applications and systems infrastructure.\n\n\n\nNew programming languages can improve developer productivity and allow new categories of users to tackle complex programming challenges. Improved compilers can boost program performance through automatic program analysis and transformation. Formal methods can build confidence in system correctness through logical arguments about complex code bases (whether through automated reductions to harness SMT solvers or through more manual construction of proofs of deeper properties using computer proof assistants like Coq).\n\n\n\nProgramming tools are relevant to most parts of computer science, and this area is therefore rich in collaborations with others, including the two-way interplay between machine learning and programming. Another popular thread is applying formal methods to classes of hardware and software systems whose correctness and security matter most: computer processors, operating systems, databases, and cryptographic libraries.\n\nFaculty Find faculty working in programming languages and software engineering"}, {"url": "https://www.thomasnet.com/articles/other/best-computer-engineering-books/", "page_content": "Guides\n\nWelcome to the Thomas guide to the best computer engineering books 2023.

Thus, developers in the industry often have different skill sets and expertise centering around various things, such as building software or consumer-facing websites, maintaining network or cyber security, building and managing computer information systems, and more.\n\nThere are three primary types of software engineering:\n\nOperational - This level of software engineering focuses more on how the software product will work and interact within its system. It emphasizes software usability, functionality, reliability, and cost \u2014 such as ensuring it falls within budget. Operational software engineering may also consider the risks posed by the software product.\n\nTransitional - The transitional side of software engineering looks at how the product reacts when moved from one environment (or system) to another. It also looks at a software product\u2019s flexibility and scalability.\n\nMaintenance - Software engineering maintenance, or recurrent software engineering, looks at how software functions inside an existing system despite any changes over time.\n\nThere is a wide range of software engineering jobs that often fall within one of the three types above. It\u2019s also worth noting that software engineers can work with the front or back end \u2014 or be full-stack developers. There are also other jobs, like DevOps or QA engineers.\n\nBest Software Engineering Books to Read\n\nAuthor: Gayle Laakmann McDowell\n\nGayle Laakmann McDowell Publisher: CareerCup; Sixth Edition\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that might intimidate professionals, it\u2019s the job interview process.

Amazon also has their list of best selling computer programming books. I've also blogged on the topic in the past: \"Six must have computer science books\" and \"What makes a good (tech) book read?\" Many of the books I own where purchased based on specific topics of interest and of need. My library is filled with many technical books that I use as references. In general, I like books that are small (a quick read) and focused (they get right to the point). Lately, I've started thinking more about my list of best authors instead of just best books. A great author (and industry luminary) has worthwhile information to impart and also has important things to say. If I enjoy one of their books, I usually check out their other books and often buy all of them.\n\nI've created my top eleven list (in alphabetical order by last name) of best programming and software engineering book authors (some are a combination of authors that often write together as well as individually) and listings of some of their definitive works. My top eleven list (if 11 is good enough for Spinal Tap it is also good enough for me.) is based on:\n\nTheir body of written and presented work - books, articles and presentations\n\nTheir contributions to programming's state-of-the-art\n\nSpecific books that \"stand the test of time\"\n\nTheir involvement in our craft and industry\n\nIf I'll read anything they publish\n\nThe person (many that I've met and some I wish I could meet).\n\nKent Beck\n\nKent Beck used to live in the Santa Cruz mountains near where I work and live. I first met Kent Beck at one of the ACM OOPSLA conferences. He was talking about a book by an Architecture professor and architect, Christopher Alexander (A Timeless Way of Building), and how the book was influencing his approach to design with Patterns. Kent also stopped by our company to talk with the R&D team. I've been bumping into Kent ever since at industry events. Kent always challenges assumptions about software engineering and programming. He always makes me stop and think about why what we do.\n\nJon Bentley\n\nI have been an ACM member since 1972 when I joined as a student member while I was at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Jon Bently's column, Programming Pearls, appeared in the Communications of the ACM montly magazine. The columns provided keen insights into the little algorithmic nuggets that we use (or should use) in our programs. Those columns have been collected into the \"Programming Pearls\" and \"More Programming Pearls\" books. \"Writing Efficient Programs\" The other book that greatly influenced my programming career when I made the move from assembly language programming to using higher level languages. Using compilers and profilers can help us write faster and smaller code. This book trained my mind to think efficient before and during the programming process. I first met Jon Bentley when he was the keynote speaker at the Second Annual Software Development Conference at the San Francisco Marriott. His talk was about \"Little Languages\". That keynote has driven me to strive for simplicity in programming langauges and application architectures. It was also an important early step in understanding how to embed languages and application engines into my programs.\n\nGrady Booch, Ivar Jacobson and Jim Rumbaugh\n\nIn the early years of object-oriented programming there were many books on object-oriented analysis and design. Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobsen and Jim Rumbaugh each had their own books and methods. Finally, they got together to combine their approaches into the Unified Modeling Language (UML). I would see them at the many object programming conferences including OOPSLA. I've especially enjoyed my many meetings and conversations with Grady Booch. We were always bumping into each other in airport waiting rooms around the world. Thanks to the three amigos and many other industry members, UML is alive and well as an industry standard specification as part of the OMG set of specifications.\n\nFrederick P. Brooks Jr.\n\nI wrote my first program (a prime number generator) using Fortran on the IBM 360/40 mainframe computer at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. I still can't believe that this fall it will have been 41 years since I keypunched my first line of code. After graduation I went to work at TRW in Los Angeles. At TRW all of the project planning schedules were broken down into man-hours, man- days and man-months. One of the first non-textbook computer books I bought as a professional programmer was the \"Mythical Man Month\". The essays helped my improve my software engineering skills on both the large and small projects that I was working on. The book became even more valuable when I made the leap from the technical to the management track (even though I continue to program today). Fred Brooks has a new book, just published this year, called \"The Design of Design\" with even more essays about design, collaboration, and case studies. I love Brooks' use of essays - they are short, contain complete thoughts, include notes and references."}, {"url": "https://www.springer.com/journal/11086", "page_content": "Programming and Computer Software is an international peer-reviewed journal devoted to problems in all areas of computer science: operating systems, compiler technology, software engineering, artificial intelligence, etc. The journal welcomes manuscripts from all countries.\n\nPEER REVIEW\n\nProgramming and Computer Software is a peer reviewed journal.

It works within a set of guidelines, best practices, and techniques that have been meticulously honed over the years, transforming as software and technology change. Software engineering leads to the emergence of a product that is steadfast, effective, and efficient at what it does. Software engineering encompasses two parts, namely software, and engineering.\n\nSoftware is a compilation of triggers, documents, and codes that does a particular job and fill a specific need whereas Engineering is the creation of products with the help of best practices, principles, and methods. Software engineers have a comprehensive understanding of programming languages, computer operating systems, and software development, and they use the principles of engineering for software creation. By using these engineering principles in each stage of the development process, from necessity analysis to the software process, they can construct personalized systems for each client. A software engineer will start with a detailed study of needs and work along the development process in a methodical way. There are many kinds of software that a software engineer can devise, like OS, computer games, network control systems, business applications, and middleware.

The book has two editions and the second edition has several key changes including some new coding examples. The target audience of Refactoring is beginners, so you\u2019ll grasp the concepts even if you have limited software engineering experience. All technical jargon is explained in a clear way.\n\nFowler and Beck emphasise the importance of keeping code easy to understand and modify in the future. This is fundamental to good programming practice. Throwing light on the second edition of the book, Fowler reiterated that it is primarily for relatively new developers.\n\nIntroduction to Algorithms\n\nAuthors: Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald Rivest and Clifford Stein\n\nIf algorithms are your cup of tea, this book should be considered a must read. From multithreaded algorithms, to polynomial-time algorithms and string matching, you\u2019ll learn all there is to know about data structuring as it pertains to software engineering.\n\nThe first half of the book explains basic concepts. But the second half contains advanced topics that seasoned engineers will appreciate. Apart from learning fundamental algorithm topics, you can also cement your knowledge through the tests provided in the book. Additionally, the book gives a window into how algorithmic techniques translate into an actual workplace. This book is particularly helpful for those who are preparing for algorithm-related interviews.\n\nYou might find the book to be slightly expensive, but it\u2019s worth every penny due to its extremely specialized content.\n\nClean Code\n\nAuthor: Robert Cecil Martin\n\nIf you\u2019re new to software engineering, then Clean Code will provide you with a solid foundation in best coding practices. More experienced programmers should also find some value, as this book will act as an excellent refresher.\n\nClean Code discusses various aspects of engineering, including testing, variable names, and functions. In addition, the book provides a clear set of rules to help new programmers develop good coding techniques from the very beginning.\n\nSince the book is Java-centric, it can be slightly hard to follow for those who don\u2019t have a good understanding of Java. Nevertheless, you can learn some invaluable lessons about functions, comments, formatting, error handling and boundaries if you go through the book thoroughly. This quote explains the author\u2019s perspective: \u201cTo write clean code, you must first write dirty code and then clean it.\u201d\n\nWorking Effectively with Legacy Code\n\nAuthor: Michael Feathers\n\nThe material in this book has been taken from the author\u2019s Object Mentor seminars. The chapters are not too lengthy, and engineers will appreciate that both Java and C++ are used for examples.
