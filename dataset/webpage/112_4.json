And gymnast Katelyn Ohashi\u2019s campaign to secure fair pay for NCAA athletes.\n\nWe explore the ways in which the sports industry has failed to make way for women. Why almost all current sports science is based on men. And why conventional coaching has led to a sordid history of harming female athletes.\n\nIn addition, Lindsay recounts what it\u2019s actually like to work at The New York Times in our post-truth, \u2018fake news\u2019 world.

There were the paparazzi as he escorted her away, her pink hair flowing and sequins pasted around her eyes.\u201d\n\nShe continued about her love life days back in college and said,\n\n\u201cI dated this normal, mystery man for seven years. Our relationship lasted all of college, and then a few years more. (A popular song from back then described being \u201ccaught in a bad romance.\u201d) As you can guess from the fact that you\u2019ve probably never heard of me, I\u2019m not famous. So suddenly it\u2019s like I\u2019m star-gawking by proxy (yes I know there\u2019s another word for that). But there\u2019s almost no way to avoid it.\n\nIt it obvious that after ending a relationship, the next thing every person would do is immediately block him or her. Same Crouse had no idea whatsoever about what\u2019s going on his ex\u2019s life. She said,\n\nI don\u2019t follow my ex on social media. We were \u201cfriends\u201d on Facebook.

And she\u2019s even named after her father\u2019s writing partner, Howard Lindsay.\n\nIn addition to \u201cLife With Father,\u201d the Crouse-Lindsay team was responsible for such archly American standards as \u201cState of the Union\u201d (1945), \u201cCall Me Madam\u201d (1950) and \u201cMr. President,\u201d as well as the books for the musicals \u201cAnything Goes\u201d (1934) and \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d (1959).\n\nBut for all the legacy she carries in her name, Lindsay Crouse has never performed in one of her late father\u2019s plays--until now, that is. She appears in journalist-playwright Sidney Blumenthal\u2019s adaptation of \u201cState of the Union,\u201d which kicks off the L.A. Theatre Works season of live radio theater at the Doubletree Guest Suites hotel in Santa Monica on Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemembered by many as a 1948 movie featuring Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, the 1946 Pulitzer-winning play is a comedy about a presidential candidate, his estranged wife and a newspaper publisher who is also vying for the man\u2019s affections. It\u2019s pointedly political, filled with thinly veiled allusions to the events of the day.\n\nFor Lindsay Crouse, though, the political is also personal. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to be learned about [my father] from working on his plays,\u201d the actress says during a recent conversation at her Westside home. \u201cIt tells me both that it was a different world that he inhabited and that his attitude toward it was quite amazing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a naivete about government [and] politics in the play which doesn\u2019t exist anymore, but which is still valuable because there\u2019s a tremendous longing for it, for a kind of leadership that cuts through this massive weight of bureaucracy, party politics, self-interest and big business,\u201d she continues.\n\n\u201cThese plays are lifted up by a kind of buoyancy and renewal. I wonder whether we think that\u2019s possible now.\u201d\n\n*\n\nBorn to onetime journalist Crouse and his wife, Anna, who was 25 years his junior, Lindsay Crouse grew up in a New York household frequented by the likes of Fredric March, Edna Ferber, Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein, Irving Berlin and many others. The family living room functioned as a kind of salon, where the composers, lyricists and performers would often gather and try out their latest songs and other material.\n\n\u201cLooking back on it now, it seems like a time of amazing accomplishments,\u201d Crouse says. \u201cI envy the bubbling up of life that was always happening in this wonderful group of people.\n\n\u201cAnd these guys had so much fun!\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd the fun and the hopefulness and the humanity are in the plays.\u201d\n\n\u201cState of the Union,\u201d which was a hit when it opened on Broadway, was written before Lindsay Crouse was born, during the year in which President Roosevelt died and Harry S. Truman assumed the Oval Office.\n\nThe play\u2019s events, however, allude to Wendell Willkie, the utility company head who became the surprise Republican candidate for president in 1940. \u201cThis is a play about a businessman who is a dark-horse candidate,\u201d says Blumenthal, a widely known author-commentator and political correspondent for the New Yorker. \u201cHis appeal is not only that he speaks his mind, but that he\u2019s outside of politics.\u201d\n\nSo, with an enduring type like that as its central figure, it\u2019s easy to see why \u201cState of the Union\u201d remains viable. \u201cThe political motivations really come out in high relief when you make the play contemporary, which shows how vital the play is,\u201d Blumenthal says. \u201cThe sensibilities, mores, references and many things in politics change, but a good deal about this endures.\u201d\n\nLindsay Crouse didn\u2019t get around to reading \u201cState of the Union\u201d until she was a teenager, not long before her father died in 1966. But she never discussed this particular work with him.\n\n\u201cI talked to him a lot about theater and was constantly at the theater seeing things that he wrote, but I don\u2019t remember talking with him specifically about his playwriting,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really old enough to be having those kinds of talks with him.\u201d\n\nCrouse went on to study choreography at Harvard. Afterward, she returned to New York and took up her acting career, working at respected off-Broadway theaters such as Circle Repertory and Yale Repertory during the \u201870s.\n\nDuring the late \u201870s and throughout the \u201880s, Crouse worked in both theater and movies. Her films include \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men\u201d (1976), \u201cThe Verdict\u201d (1982) and \u201cPlaces in the Heart\u201d (1984), for which she received an Academy Award nomination.\n\nIn 1992, Crouse, who is now in her 40s, moved to Los Angeles, prompted in part by her divorce from playwright David Mamet. She became a founding member of the Matrix Theatre in 1993, but since then has been concentrating on film and TV to be home at night with her daughters, now 14 and 8 years old.\n\nYet the more Crouse works, the more she misses the kind of women\u2019s roles her father and Lindsay wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see in what regard women were held in the \u201840s,\u201d she says. \u201cWomen were not in the same position they are now, but there\u2019s a lot of wonderful writing for women--and for women who were not 20--at that time.\u201d\n\nNowadays, it\u2019s a vastly different story. \u201cWomen are unbelievably muzzled at this time in this culture,\u201d Crouse says. \u201cIn the parts I receive, the women are assigned powerful positions--executives, lawyers or whatever--but they\u2019re not given much to do. They don\u2019t have the real force behind them to create change.\u201d\n\n* \u201cState of the Union,\u201d L.A.

She recalls saying to Sanford Meisner: \u201cI\u2019m coming as an acolyte. I want to find out what acting is ... I\u2019m submitting.\u201d At the time, Crouse was an accomplished actor who had explored techniques of actor training at The Stella Adler Conservatory and The Stanislavsky Institute and, for many years, with Uta Hagen at The HB Studios. Crouse\u2019s decision to devote herself to her artistic development\u2014at a risky and critical juncture in her professional life\u2014is a tribute to her courage, integrity, and commitment. Crouse uses that impressive conviction to immerse herself in the circumstances of a role. For Sidney Lumet\u2019s film The Verdict (1982), Crouse studied with a voice coach for hours to perform the small but crucial part of Caitlin, an Irish character. This scrupulous dedication to truthfulness conforms with Crouse\u2019s ardent beliefs about the ethics of acting. She says an actor shouldn\u2019t \u201ctake an average, but... get out there and go as far as [you] can.\u201d Crouse fulfills that credo in performances that radiate with the intense light of her passion and intelligence.\n\nKeywords\n\nTheater Club\n\nIrish Character\n\nElectric Chair\n\nMidlife Crisis\n\nAccomplished Actor\n\nThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

So in 2015, I began following Lindsay\u2019s career. As I watched her work mature and profile grow, I eagerly awaited each new article \u2014 and anticipated an opportunity to share her experience and insight on the podcast.\n\nToday is that day. And it\u2019s everything I hoped it would be.\n\nWe begin with Lindsay\u2019s personal trajectory from Rhode Island roots and attending Harvard to landing a job at the most prestigious newspaper in the world.\n\nWe discuss maternity rights and the gender wage gap by going behind the scenes on Nike\u2019 relationship with pregnant athletes. The controversies surrounding Alberto Salazar and the Nike Oregon Project. The personal stories shared by Mary Cain, Kara Goucher, Alysia Monta\u00f1o and Allyson Felix. And gymnast Katelyn Ohashi\u2019s campaign to secure fair pay for NCAA athletes.\n\nWe explore the ways in which the sports industry has failed to make way for women. Why almost all current sports science is based on men. And why conventional coaching has led to a sordid history of harming female athletes.\n\nIn addition, Lindsay recounts what it\u2019s actually like to work at The New York Times in our post-truth, \u2018fake news\u2019 world. The unique pressures that accompany breaking big stories. And how she manages to balance everything \u2014 and still kick serious ass in running.\n\nThe ongoing impact of Lindsay\u2019s journalism is immeasurable. So it was an absolute honor and a delight to sit down with her.\n\nAudio Note: Because this conversation transpired at the New York Times offices (as opposed to my studio), we did not film the conversation. In addition, it was recorded in mid-October and thus not current with the immediate news cycle.\n\nI can\u2019t say enough good things about Lindsay and the work she is doing to advance the role and voice of women in sports. I love this conversation. I sincerely hope you do as well.\n\nPeace + Plants,"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lindsay-and-Crouse", "page_content": "Lindsay and Crouse, American duo responsible for coauthoring humorous plays and collaborating on theatrical productions. Howard Lindsay (b. March 29, 1889, Waterford, New York, U.S.\u2014d. February 11, 1968, New York, New York) and Russel Crouse (b. February 20, 1893, Findlay, Ohio, U.S.\u2014d. April 3, 1966, New York, New York) were notable both for their continual successes and for the way they complemented each other\u2019s talents.\n\nPrior to meeting Crouse, Lindsay had already gained experience as an actor, director, and playwright, traveling for 42 weeks in the production of Polly of the Circus. Crouse\u2019s early experience was primarily journalistic, although he did write a libretto for The Gang\u2019s All Here (1931), which ran for only two weeks. He also wrote several nostalgic books in the early 1930s about 19th-century America.\n\nWhile trying to salvage a play in 1933, producer Vinton Freedley paired the talents of Lindsay and Crouse. The result was Anything Goes (1934) and a partnership that was to expand and mature over the following years. Their longest-playing drama was a 1939 production based on Clarence Day\u2019s book Life with Father, which ran for 7 1/2 years (3,213 performances) and in which Lindsay played Father opposite his real-life wife, Dorothy Stickney. When Lindsay and Crouse were offered Arsenic and Old Lace in 1940, they tried their hands at theatrical production, and the result was another success. In 1946 the pair won the Pulitzer Prize in drama for State of the Union (1945), which was a satire of American politics. Sections of this play were rewritten every day to correspond to actual events. They also wrote the libretto for the play The Sound of Music (1959).\n\nLindsay and Crouse\u2019s work had a universal appeal, created by a blend of Lindsay\u2019s theatrical knowledge and Crouse\u2019s sharp wit. Together they had a gift for transforming ideas into extremely popular musicals and plays."}, {"url": "https://www.hup.harvard.edu/collection.php?cpk=1020", "page_content": "Below are the in-print works in this collection. Sort by title, author, format, publication date, or price \u00bb\n\n2. Twentieth-Century Literature in Retrospect Brower, Reuben Arthur The essays collected here are divided into two groups: the first, concerned mainly with poets and novelists who have reached an almost canonical status; the second, dealing with earlier writers whose positions have been radically altered through interpretation and criticism of the past forty years.\n\n4. Uses of Literature Engel, Monroe \u201cThe life of a literary work depends on readers whose existence it confirms or (the valuable possibility) augments,\u201d writes Monroe Engel. The essays collected here concern the related thesis that \u201cthe vitality of the literary enterprise is related to its usability, its capacity to strengthen or alter our options.\u201d The first group of essays is theoretical\u2014discussion of habit, originality, religious perspectives, and self-evaluation. The second group approaches specific issues and authors within the American context. The collection concludes with five essays on teaching literature to students whose previous literary exposure has been limited.\n\n7. Shakespeare: Aspects of Influence Evans, G. B. The ten essays in this volume are devoted to various manifestations of Shakespeare\u2019s influence, on individual writers and on the popular consciousness, from the early seventeenth century to the present.\n\n8. Studies in Biography Aaron, Daniel Studies in Biography, a volume in the series Harvard English Studies, contains eleven essays which point to some of the new directions biography and biographical criticism have taken since the nineteenth century.\n\n9. Allegory, Myth, and Symbol Bloomfield, Morton W. The essays in this volume, ranging in time from the Middle Ages to the present and in subject from poetry to philosophy, explore the multiple interpretations of allegory, as well as the important distinctions among allegory, myth, and symbol.\n\n10. Emerson: Prospect and Retrospect Porte, Joel Published to mark the centenary of his death, this book helps us take measure of the work and influence of one of America\u2019s foremost thinkers, Ralph Waldo Emerson. These nine essays attempt both to come to terms with Emerson\u2019s modernity and to look back at his origins and development. They suggest how extensively Emerson is linked to the present and show how firmly he was rooted in America\u2019s past.\n\n11. Modernism Reconsidered Kiely, Robert The thirteen essays in this volume range freely over the literature of the modernist period, from about the turn of the century to World War II. The contributors were invited to examine less familiar works\u2014or aspects of the work\u2014of major writers; to reconsider authors not usually thought of as modernist; or to explore received opinions about modernist theories and the assumptions that inform the literature of the time.\n\n12. Johnson and His Age Engell, James Published in the bicentennial year of Samuel Johnson\u2019s death, Johnson and His Age includes contributions by some of the nation\u2019s most eminent scholars of eighteenth-century literature. It includes sections on Johnson\u2019s life, major figures of the age, and the novel.\n\n14. Renaissance Genres: Essays on Theory, History, and Interpretation Lewalski, Barbara Kiefer Today genre studies are flourishing, and nowhere more vigorously perhaps than in the field of Renaissance literature, given the importance to Renaissance writers of questions of genre. The eighteen essays in this volume are striking in their diversity of stance and approach. Three are addressed to genre theory explicitly, and all reveal a concern with theoretical issues.\n\n15. Teaching Literature: What Is Needed Now Engell, James\n\nPerkins, David Hugh Kenner, Helen Vendler, Harry Levin, Nathan A. Scott, Jr., Barbara Johnson, J. Hillis Miller, and seven other scholars, critics, and metacritics at the forefront of intellectual developments in their fields offer provocative statements on the teaching of literature and on their own practices as teachers. The authors, differing widely in their areas of interest and their approaches to literature, stress an inherent relation between the classroom and their published writings, integrating teaching strategies with critical or theoretical positions.\n\n16. Theoretical Issues in Literary History Perkins, David Literary history, the dominant form of literary scholarship throughout the nineteenth century, is currently recapturing the imaginations of a new generation of scholars eager to focus on the context of literature after a half-century or more of \u201cclose\u201d readings of isolated texts. This book represents current thinking on some of the theoretical issues and dilemmas in the conception and writing of literary history, expressed by a group of scholars from North America, Europe, and Australia.\n\n17. The Ballad and Oral Literature Harris, Joseph Francis James Child, compiler and editor of the monumental English and Scottish Popular Ballads, established the scholarly study of folk ballads in the English-speaking world. His successors at Harvard University discovered new ways of relating ideas about sung narrative to the study of epic poetry and what has come to be called\u2014though not without controversy\u2014\u201coral literature.\u201d In this volume, sixteen distinguished scholars from Europe and the United States offer original essays in the spirit of these pioneers.\n\n18. The Return of Thematic Criticism Sollors, Werner How to determine the theme of a text\u2014can a focus on form be the theme? Can the motif be a formal category? What operations permit us to say that texts are variants of the same theme? The contributors challenge the dismissal of \u201cmerely\u201d thematic approaches and offer different ways to tackle the issue of what a piece of writing is \u201cabout.\u201d\n\n19. Black Columbiad: Defining Moments in African American Literature and Culture Sollors, Werner\n\nDiedrich, Maria What finding the New World meant to those who never sought it\u2014and how they made the hostile, unfamiliar continent their own\u2014is the subject of this volume, the first truly international collection of essays on African American literature and culture."}, {"url": "https://snaccooperative.org/vocab_administrator/resources/6385179", "page_content": "Related Entities\n\nThere are 41 Entities related to this resource.\n\nGoodman Theatre (Chicago, Ill.) http://n2t.net/ark:/99166/w6nt1m0t (corporateBody) Goodman Theatre is a professional theater company located in Chicago's Loop.
