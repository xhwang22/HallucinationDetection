After graduating from high school, she signed with the Japan Tobacco Women's Volleyball team (now the JT Marvelous in the V.League). She was injured in 1989 while playing and decided to pursue a career in show business after watching actress and singer Miki Imai on television while recovering in the hospital. She then focused on a career as a fashion model.\n\nIn 1995, Esumi made her acting debut as Yumiko in Maborosi, a film directed by Hirokazu Koreeda. Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle gave her acting high praise, describing it as \"extraordinary\" and stating she played the role with \"delicacy and physical grace\". Esumi won the Rookie of the Year Award at both the 19th Annual Japan Academy Prize ceremonies and at the 38th Blue Ribbon Awards for her role in Maborosi. Esumi married photographer Rowland Kirishima in February 1996, though they divorced only nine months later.\n\nShe is probably best known for her leading role as the rebellious office lady Tsuboi Chinatsu in the Shomuni series of TV dramas, the first of which aired on Fuji TV from April to July 1998.

That same year, she began appearing in Japanese government television and print advertisements encouraging the public to make their pension contributions, but started a small scandal in 2004 when it was reported that she was not making those same pension contributions herself. She stated that she thought she had been making the payments, and then corrected the issue by becoming current on her contributions. Esumi's image was removed from the ads at the direction of the Social Insurance Agency after the scandal broke.\n\nHer eldest daughter was born in February 2005, and a second daughter was announced in July 2009 as due to be born in December. Esumi wrote a personal note about this announcement which her talent agency subsequently published on their site.\n\nIn a 20 May 2007 article in the Asahi Shimbun, Esumi revealed that her younger brother had died at the age of 36 the previous May of complications due to cancer."}, {"url": "https://www.famousbirthdays.com/people/makiko-esumi.html", "page_content": "About\n\nJapanese actress who became known for her role as Chinatsu Tsuboi in the television show Shomuni.\n\nBefore Fame\n\nShe worked as a mizo at Izumo-taisha and after she graduated high school, she joined the Tobacco Women's Volleyball team but stopped after receiving an injury in 1989.\n\nTrivia\n\nShe was nominated for a 2002 Japan Academy Prize in the Best Actress category for her role in the Japanese film Inochi.\n\nFamily Life\n\nShe married television director Shin Hirano in 2003, and she has two daughters born in 2005 and 2009.\n\nAssociated With\n\nShe is a contemporary Japanese television actress of Juri Manase."}, {"url": "https://japantoday.com/category/entertainment/actress-makiko-esumi-announces-retirement-from-showbiz-denies-affair-rumors", "page_content": "Japanese actress and TV personality Makiko Esumi, 50, announced on Monday that she will be retiring from the show business world, citing personal reasons and denying a magazine report that she is involved in an extramarital affair.\n\nIn a fax message sent to the media by a representative, Esumi said that she has decided to retire from showbiz to \u201creflect on herself,\u201d and focus on her family, Fuji TV reported.\n\n\u201cI have been working during most of the milestones in my life -- the birth of my children and their growing up. Now it is time for me to take a pause and devote my life to things that only I can do. I have therefore come to this conclusion (to retire from acting and TV),\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe statement further denied the accuracy of an article appearing in the Tuesday issue of a weekly magazine which speculates that Esumi, who has been married for 14 years -- her second marriage -- is involved in an extramarital affair with a man she meets frequently.\n\n\u201cI am not involved in an affair. The man described as my partner in the upcoming article is a business associate,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe are preparing to take legal measures (against the magazine), which is reporting something that is absolutely not true.\u201d\n\nThe message also confirmed that Esumi and her husband, director Shin Hirano, live apart, but that this is only \u201cdue to work and lifestyle preferences.\" She denied any plans for a divorce.

A number of tabloids reported that Esumi had ordered the manager to commit the vandalism, but it was later revealed that she herself learned of the incident through the media and was not involved. The manager later apologized to Esumi for his actions.\n\nFans were quick to react to Esumi\u2019s retirement, with most of them saying that they regret to see her leaving.\u201dShe has been one of the few TV personalities who say things as they are without faking it just to be liked.
