Those dreams became reality in 2012 when she got as close as she could get to advancing to the 100m breaststroke final in London, losing a swim-off for the eighth spot in the final to Jamaica\u2019s Alia Atkinson. Van Beilen also competed in the 200m breaststroke after winning the event at the Canadian Trials, knocking world record holder Annamay Pierse off the Canadian Olympic team in the process. Van Beilen had competed at the inaugural Youth Olympic Games in 2010, winning three medals including gold in the 100m breaststroke. Her multi-sport competition experience includes the 2011 and 2013 Universiades, where she won a pair of silver medals in her first appearance. Van Beilen made her FINA World Championship debut in 2013.

The swim has won a total of five medals so far in the competition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLindsay Delmar of Calgary was fifth in the women's 50 butterfly Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Youth Olympics are for athletes 14-18 and have attracted more than 3,000 athletes in the same sports program that is set for the 2012 London Games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFencers Alexandre Lyssov of Richmond Hill, Ont., and Alanna Goldie of Calgary also made the podium, winning bronze in the mixed team event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRussia has nine golds and 19 medals overall, while China has nine golds and 15 medals overall. Azerbaijan is third with five golds, while Italy has four. Canada has a total of nine medals so far, including three gold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the women's 100 breaststroke, Van Beilen nailed her second length to emerge with the gold in one minute 8.95 seconds. Emily Selig of Australia was second in 1:09.06 and Nicol, first at the turn, followed in third in 1:09.18.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It feels amazing to win gold,\" said the 17-year-old Van Beilen. \"I came into this meet wanting to win a medal and after the prelims and semis I felt I had a shot at the gold. I didn't realize I was second at the turn but I saw Rachel beside me and my strength in this race has always been my second half.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNicol was at a personal best pace on the first length Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had never gone out that fast before,\" Nicol said. \"On the second length I got a bit tired and my stroke shortened a bit. Still I'm not disappointed especially that Tera also got on the podium. It was a really close race and exciting for all of us.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn mixed team fencing, Goldie rallied from a 10-4 deficit in the bronze medal bout.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was just in the moment and I had to make it happen,\" Goldie said. \"I listened to my coach and my teammates. It was good advice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's the second medal for Lyssov, who also won bronze in the epee earlier this week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanada's girls three-on-three basketball team improved to 3-0 with a 20-6 win over South Korea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn track and field, Britain's David Bolarinwa and Jamaica's Odane Skeen won their qualifying heats in the 100 metres, setting up a much anticipated final between two sprinters touted as the next Usain Bolt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolarinwa blew away the field in his heat, finishing in 10.62 seconds. Skeen got out slowly but surged to run 10.63 seconds to beat Thailand's Jirapong Meenapra.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 16-year-old Bolarinwa has the fastest time this year among 16- and 17-year-olds - a 10.39 in London earlier this month. Skeen, a 15-year-old whose lanky style has some likening him to his compatriot Bolt, ran a 10.46 in Jamaica.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I thought let me go there, go hard and see if anyone can go faster,\" Bolarinwa said. \"It was a good performance overall.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkeen was less thrilled with his performance, blaming his slower time on two false starts by other competitors. But he said come Saturday's final, he would win.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolarinwa and Skeen will face each other for the first time and are still sizing one another up. Skeen, for example, was surprised to hear that it was Bolarinwa and not himself who has run the fastest 100 this year. Marvin Bracy of the United States ran the second fastest but is not at the Games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganizers of the first Youth Olympics have emphasized participation rather than winning, but that was lost on Bolarinwa and Skeen, who both predicted they would win Saturday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a big showdown,\" Bolarinwa said. \"He's not really a quick starter. We know that already,\" Bolarinwa said. \"His pick up is fantastic and so is mine. If I get a good start, he'll have to take me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolarinwa's coach John Powell chimed in later: \"Bring it on.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth boys seemed to relish the comparison to Bolt and their budding rivalry to that of Bolt and Tyson Gay. Told he has been compared to a miniature Bolt, Skeen just smiled and said he one day dreams of surpassing his idol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I want to be better than Bolt,\" said Skeen, whose goal it is to win gold at the 2012 Olympics in London. \"I want to be much more faster.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolarinwa enjoyed being likened to the two sprinting greats, but wants to surpass them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These guys are fantastic. You look at what they have done. You want to be better than them,\" Bolarinwa said. \"But it's good to have them in the back your mind to look up to.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatching Skeen's heat, Powell said he saw some of Bolt in Skeen. But he was quick to point out that a lot can change with an athlete by the time they reach adulthood. He noted that Bolt, for example, started out running 200- and 400-meter before exploding on the stage in the 100.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You don't know how they will develop, this is the thing,\" Powell said of Skeen. \"He's about 16 and that is two or three years of formative years as an athlete. He could broaden out. He obviously has a good stride. If I looked at him - not that you can stereotype athletes these days - I'd say he is a typical 200-metre runner.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn other action Wednesday, Lithuania rower Rolandas Mascinskas upset Germany's two-time world junior champion German Felix Bach to win the junior men's single sculls gold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the women's single sculls, Judith Sievers of Germany beat Nataliia Kovalova of Ukraine.

She was the family\u2019s most enthusiastic user of the backyard pool (she remembers summer days with her sister, Marya, dropping marbles into the deep end, seeing who could come up with the most).\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a Eureka moment. Tera liked swimming enough to make it a regular thing. She got pretty good at it pretty fast. The coaches on hand pressed the Van Beilens to intensify Tera\u2019s twice-a-week training schedule.\n\nBut through grade school it remained a hobby and a physical outlet, rather than an obsession.\n\nToday, Van Beilen, a distinctly unchubby 18-year-old, is headed to the London Olympics, a surprise medal contender in the 100m and 200m breaststroke.\n\nGenetics must have something to do with this. Her uncle, Wayne Van Dorp, played for the Blackhawks and the Penguins. Her cousin, Joel Reinders, is an offensive tackle with the New York Giants.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the one protecting Eli Manning. Or is it Peyton Manning? I\u2019m not sure. One of the Mannings,\u201d Van Beilen said.\n\nThe illusion of athletic effortlessness is also a family thing. Reinders played only eight games of football at any level before being signed by the Cleveland Browns.\n\nLike her gargantuan cousin, Van Beilen\u2019s progression is proof to parents everywhere that a child can master a sport without sacrificing every other thing it means to be a child.\n\n\u201cThey let me have swimming and still have school. I had both worlds,\u201d Van Beilen says.\n\nRight into high school, Van Beilen played other sports. It wasn\u2019t until age 15 that she made swimming her focus.\n\nA great many athletic stories \u2014 both amateur and pro \u2014 start precociously early and are filled with nothing from then on but practice and competition. In an extreme example, 10-year-old Alexander Ovechkin played in a hockey tournament the day after his brother died.\n\nVan Beilen went to a regular school \u2014 Oakville\u2019s Kings Christian Collegiate \u2014 rather than a sporting academy. On Friday nights, she watched Say Yes to the Dress with her mom. She went out with friends on Saturdays. She attended the birthright of all typical teens \u2014 the prom.\n\nEven after swimming became her job, she treated it like one \u2014 a Monday-to-Friday thing. However, it was an exhausting Monday to Friday thing.\n\nShe was cut a few breaks at school. Teachers would occasionally let her go out to her car and sleep through a class. Her mother, Sharon, an administrator at the school, set up a quiet room for Van Beilen to nap through her spares.\n\nShe graduated last year. She now attends Swimming Canada\u2019s branch office in Vancouver, the University of British Columbia. Five of Canada\u2019s pool Olympians were studying and training at UBC last year.\n\nA year ago, the Olympics were a dream for Van Beilen. Literally. She began having dreams about touching the wall, looking up at the clock and seeing herself qualified. She has a picture of the rings pasted over her bed at home and at school.\n\nBut that\u2019s all they were. At that point Van Beilen was ranked 18th in the world in the 100-metre event, and 23rd in the 200-metre. That put her 5th and 3rd, respectively, on Canada\u2019s depth chart in events where only two competitors qualify.\n\nIn February, hope began to turn to belief when she finished first in the 100-metre at the CIS Championships and a narrow second to UBC teammate and fellow Olympian Martha McCabe in the 200.\n\n\u201cThat was when I began to say to myself, \u2018I know I can do this\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn March, she went to the Olympic trials in Montreal. She first qualified in the 100-metre by placing second, a mild surprise. But it was her performance in the 200-metre that brought her to global attention.\n\nVan Beilen finished first in the 200-metre final, pushing third-place finisher and current world record holder Annamay Pierse off Canada\u2019s Olympic team. Her time of 2:24:03 was, at that point, the second fastest in the world this year.\n\nThe day after qualifying, she flew back to Vancouver to sit a physiology exam she had very purposely put out of her mind while she concentrated on the trials. She got a 57.\n\n\u201cMom, I got a 57!\u201d Van Beilen excitedly told her mother. Sharon was less excited.\n\nShe looks pretty excited now, snapping pictures of Star photographer Steve Russell while he takes pictures of Tera sitting on the diving board of that family pool. Sharon\u2019s wearing a Team Van Beilen t-shirt. Tera\u2019s childhood trophies are piled up in boxes in the hallway of their Oakville cottage. They\u2019ve just returned from display at Tera\u2019s grade school.\n\nFather Harry, an executive with Tim Hortons, drifts in on his lunch hour to take in the scene. The Van Beilens didn\u2019t push their daughter into sport, but they\u2019re enjoying watching her flower in that world.\n\n\u201cI think Tera likes it, too,\u201d Harry says, in that teasing way a father says things within earshot of his children.\n\n\u201cLikes what?\u201d Tera says.\n\n\u201cThe attention,\u201d Harry says.\n\n\u201cRight, dad,\u201d Tera drawls sarcastically, 18 going on 13 for just a moment. They catch each other\u2019s eye and smile. This has the feel of a family routine that\u2019s been perfected over many years.\n\nNobody made Tera Van Beilen do anything. Left to her own youthful devices, she has put herself on the cusp of something that will last long after youth has faded.\n\nRELATED\n\nProfile: Diver Jennifer Abel\n\nProfile: Swimmer Julia Wilkinson\n\nProfile: Mountain biker Catharine Pendrel\n\nProfile: Rowing\u2019s Lesley Thompson-Willie\n\nLondon Olympic quiz\n\nKEY COMPETITORS\n\nRebecca Soni, U.S.A.100 and 200 No woman in the world dominates a single stroke the way Soni dominates breaststroke. She has three Olympic medals, has held four world records and is the defending world champion at both the 100m and 200m distance. Soni is the clear favourite in both of Van Beilen\u2019s events.\n\nJessica Hardy, U.S.A.100 The world\u2019s dominant breaststroker until a doping suspension cost her an appearance in Beijing, where Soni eclipsed her. She\u2019s the defending U.S. champion at this distance and the current world record holder.\n\n\u201cOther than those two, it\u2019s pretty close afterward. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s game,\u201d says Van Beilen. \u201cWhoever can deal with the pressure at that moment can succeed. And that\u2019s one thing I think I\u2019m pretty good at.\u201d\n\nSHARE:"}, {"url": "https://www.thestar.com/sports/2010/08/18/oakville_teen_wins_swim_gold_at_youth_olympics.html", "page_content": "SINGAPORE\u2014Canada has won another gold medal in the pool at the Youth Olympic Games.\n\nTera Van Beilen of Oakville captured the women\u2019s 100-metre breaststroke crown Wednesday.\n\nRachel Nicol of Lethbridge, Alta., added a bronze in the race as Canadian swimmers continued their medal haul.\n\nNicol won a gold in the 50 breaststroke earlier in the week.
