Leaving school at the age of 14, he worked as a day-labourer, before enlisting in the Lancashire Fusiliers in October 1915. He was 24 years old and an acting company sergeant major in the 15th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers, British Army during the First World War when he performed the deeds which resulted in the award of the Victoria Cross.

Fus (Rochdale).\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery and initiative during the attack at Happegarbes on 2nd November, 1918, when in command of a platoon, he led his men forward with great determination, and, on being held up by heavy machine-gun fire, rushed forward through a thick, strongly held ridge, captured in succession four machine guns, and single-handed bayonetted the crews. Later, he led the remnants of his platoon to the capture of three machine guns and many prisoners. In the later stages of the attack on the same day, when his platoon was held up by enemy machine guns, he successfully led a Tank against them over very exposed ground. Continuing the attack on 3rd November, after capturing many prisoners and gaining his objective, he organised his line most skilfully and held up the enemy. On 4th November, in the attack on the Oise-Sambre Canal, under heavy fire from the Canal bank, he rushed forward with a Lewis gun team in the face of an intense barrage, brought the gun into action, effectively silenced the enemy's fire, thus enabling his company to advance and gain their objectives. Throughout the whole of these operations Sjt. Clarke acted with magnificent bravery and total disregard of personal safety, and by his gallantry and high sense of duty set an inspiring example to all ranks.\n\n\n\nThe forename in the original citation was subsequently corrected.\n\nHe did not find much success in civilian life.

The Cross was not awarded for bravery in action against the enemy, but for bravery at sea in saving life in a storm off the Andaman Islands.\n\nOn 7 May 1867 at the island of Little Andaman, eastern India, in the Bay of Bengal, Private Cooper was one of a party of five (David Bell, Campbell Mellis Douglas, William Griffiths, Thomas Murphy) of 2/24th Regiment. They risked their lives in manning a boat and proceeding through dangerous surf to rescue some of their comrades who had been sent to the island to find out the fate of the commander and seven of the crew, who had landed from the ship Assam Valley and were feared murdered by the cannibalistic islanders.\n\nThe citation was gazetted on 17 December 1867:\n\nTHE Queen has been graciously pleased to signify Her intention to confer the decoration of the Victoria Cross on the undermentioned Officer and Private Soldiers of Her Majesty's Army, whose claims to the same have been submitted for Her Majesty's approval, for their gallant conduct at the Little Andaman Island, as recorded against their names, viz. :\u2014\n\n2nd Battalion, 24th Regiment: Assistant-Surgeon Campbell Millis Douglas, M.D, Private Thomas Murphy, Private James Cooper, Private David Bell, Private William Griffiths.\n\nFor the very gallant and daring manner in which, on the 7th of May, 1867, they risked their lives in manning a boat and proceeding through a dangerous surf to the rescue of some of their comrades, who formed part of an expedition which had been sent to the Island of Little Andaman, by order of the Chief Commissioner of British Burmah, with the view of ascertaining the fate of the Commander and seven of the crew of the ship \" Assam Valley,\" who had landed there, and were supposed to have been murdered by the natives.\n\nThe officer who commanded the troops on the occasion reports : About an hour later in the day Dr. Douglas, 2nd Battalion, 24th .\"Regiment, and the four Privates referred\" to, gallantly manning the second gig, made their way through the surf almost to the shore, but finding their boat was half filled with water, they retired. A second attempt made by Dr. Douglas and party proved successful, five of us being safely passed through the surf to the boats outside. A third and last trip got the whole of the party left on shore safe to the boats. It is stated that Dr. Douglas accomplished these trips through the surf to the shore by no ordinary exertion. He stood in the bows of the boat, and worked her in an intrepid and seamanlike manner, cool to a degree, as if what he was then doing was an ordinary act of every-day life. The four Privates behaved in an equally cool and collected manner, rowing through the roughest surf when the slightest hesitation or want of pluck on the part of any one of them would have been attended by the gravest results.

In 1935 Nicolson began working as an engineer, and in 1936 he joined the Royal Air Force, with the Service No 39329. After his training he joined No. 72 Squadron in 1937 and later moved to No. 249 Squadron in 1940.\n\nSecond World War\n\nNicolson was 23 years old and a flight lieutenant in No. 249 Squadron, during the Second World War when he was awarded the Victoria Cross. On 16 August 1940 near Southampton, Nicolson's Hawker Hurricane was fired on by a Messerschmitt Bf 110, injuring the pilot in one eye and one foot. His engine was also damaged and the petrol tank set alight. As he struggled to leave the blazing machine he saw another Messerschmitt, and managing to get back into the bucket seat, pressed the firing button and continued firing until the enemy plane dived away to destruction. Not until then did he bail out, and he was able to open his parachute in time to land safely in a field. On his descent, he was fired on by members of the Home Guard, who ignored his cry of being a RAF pilot.\n\nVictoria Cross citation\n\nThe announcement and accompanying citation for the decoration was published in supplement to the London Gazette on 15 November 1940, reading\n\nAir Ministry, 15 November 1940. The KING has been graciously pleased to confer the Victoria Cross on the undermentioned officer in recognition of most conspicuous bravery : \u2014 Flight Lieutenant James Brindley NICOLSON (39329) \u2014 No. 249 Squadron. During an engagement with the enemy near Southampton on 16th August 1940, Flight Lieutenant Nicolson's aircraft was hit by four cannon shells, two of which wounded him whilst another set fire to the gravity tank. When about to abandon his aircraft owing to flames in the cockpit he sighted an enemy fighter. This he attacked and shot down, although as a result of staying in his burning aircraft he sustained serious burns to his hands, face, neck and legs. Flight Lieutenant Nicolson has always displayed great enthusiasm for air fighting and this incident shows that he possesses courage and determination of a high order. By continuing to engage the enemy after he had been wounded and his aircraft set on fire, he displayed exceptional gallantry and disregard for the safety of his own life.\n\nFully recovered by September 1941, Nicolson was posted to India in 1942. Between August 1943 and August 1944 he was a Squadron Leader and C.O. of No 27 Squadron, flying Bristol Beaufighters over Burma. During this time he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.\n\nAs a Wing Commander, he was killed on 2 May 1945 when a RAF B-24 Liberator from No. 355 Squadron, in which he was flying as an observer, caught fire and crashed into the Bay of Bengal. His body was not recovered. He is commemorated on the Singapore Memorial.\n\nNicolson was the only Battle of Britain pilot and the only pilot of RAF Fighter Command to be awarded the Victoria Cross during the Second World War.

Many of them are displayed at the Imperial War Museum in Lambeth, South London. Below are 10 facts about the Victoria Cross and the George Cross.\n\nThe Victoria Cross\n\n1. The Victoria Cross was created on 29 January 1856. It recognises acts of bravery carried out under enemy fire. It is often referred to by its initials \u2018VC\u2019.\n\n2. 1,354 people have been awarded the Victoria Cross since its inception.\n\n3. The Cross is hand-made, traditionally using bronze taken from a gun captured in the Crimean War. It was deliberately intended to have little monetary value.\n\n4. The inscription on the Victoria Cross is \u2018For Valour\u2019. Queen Victoria turned down the first suggestion, \u2018For the Brave\u2019, explaining that all her soldiers were brave.\n\n5. An act that leads to someone being awarded the Victoria Cross has to be seen by several witnesses. The award is then sent for approval by the monarch.\n\n6. The two youngest recipients of the Victoria Cross were Thomas Flinn in 1857 and Andrew Fitzgibbon in 1860. Both were fifteen years and three months old. The oldest recipient of the VC was sixty-nine-year-old William Raynor who defended an ammunition store in Delhi for five hours in 1857.\n\n7. Three fathers and sons have earned the VC, including Charles Gough in 1857 and his son John Gough in 1903. Four pairs of brothers have also earned VCs, including Major Charles Gough and Lieutenant Hugh Gough in 1858. One set of brothers has each received both a Victoria Cross and a George Cross: Captain Derek Seagrim was awarded the VC in 1943 and Major Hugh Seagrim was given a George Cross in 1944.\n\n8. Only three people have received the Victoria Cross twice: Surgeon Captain Arthur Martin-Leake in 1902 and 1914, Captain Noel Chavasse in 1916 and 1917, and Captain Charles Upham in 1941 and 1942. The medals of Charles Upham form part of the Imperial War Museum collection but are on long-term display in New Zealand.\n\n9. Since 1902, when it was first awarded posthumously, the Victoria Cross has been awarded to 295 people who died while performing acts of bravery.\n\n10. The Victoria Cross has been awarded to three soldiers for bravery in Afghanistan: posthumously to Corporal Bryan Budd of the Parachute Regiment, also to Corporal Willia Apiata of the New Zealand SAS, and Trooper Mark Donaldson of the Australian SAS.\n\nThe George Cross\n\n1. The George Cross was created on 24 September 1940. It recognises acts of extreme bravery carried out in peacetime when facing the perils of ordinary life and in wartime away from the heat of battle.\n\n2. The George Cross is made from silver by the Royal Mint. The inscription on the George Cross is \u2018For Gallantry\u2019. The words surround an image of St George slaying the dragon. Many details on the George Cross were personally designed by King George VI, after whom it was named.\n\n3. 406 people have received George Crosses (86 posthumously). Collective medals were awarded to Malta and to the Royal Ulster Constabulary.\n\n4. 143 George Crosses have been awarded to civilians (excluding police officers). This represents 35% of all the George Crosses awarded.\n\n5. There are fourteen living George Cross holders, with seven residing overseas.\n\n6. The youngest recipient of the George Cross was fifteen-year-old John Bamford who rescued his brothers from a house fire in 1952. The oldest was John Axon, a British Rail engine driver aged fifty-seven who died trying to stop a runaway train in 1957.\n\n7. The Albert Medal was created in 1866 and named after Queen Victoria\u2019s husband, Prince Albert, it was awarded for great bravery while saving someone else\u2019s life either at sea or on land. 570 Albert Medals had been awarded by 1971 when it was decided to change (or \u2018translate\u2019) them into George Crosses.\n\n8. The Edward Medal was created in 1907 and named after King Edward VII, it was awarded to people who risked their lives to help or save others caught in industrial accidents, particularly in coal mines. 584 Edward Medals had been awarded by 1971 when they were translated into George Crosses.\n\n9. Eleven women have received the George Cross. The most recent was Barbara Harrison, an air stewardess who died rescuing people after an air crash at Heathrow in 1968.\n\n10. The George Cross has been awarded to four soldiers for bravery in Afghanistan: posthumously to Corporal Mark Wright of the Parachute Regiment and to Sergeant Olaf Schmid, Logistic Corps. It was also given to Lance Corporal Matthew Croucher of the Royal Marines and Staff Sergeant Kim Hughes of the Royal Logistic Corps."}, {"url": "https://www.historyhit.com/distinguished-victoria-cross-winners/", "page_content": "King George V awarding the Victoria Cross to 2nd Lieutenant Cecil Knox of the 150th Field Company, Royal Engineers, on 22 March 1918. Near Calais, France.\n\nThe Victoria Cross (VC) is the most prestigious award in the British honours system (tied with the George Cross as of 1940). It is the highest accolade that a member of the British Armed Forces can receive.\n\nAs per the inscription on each VC medal, the award is granted \u201cfor valour\u201d \u2013 for those who have shown exceptional bravery \u201cin the presence of the enemy\u201d.\n\nThe VC was created in the 1850s, with the first ceremony taking place on 26 June 1857. Queen Victoria herself awarded 62 VCs that day, many of them to veterans of the Crimean War (1853-1856). It later became rumoured that British VC medals were in fact made from the metal of Russian guns retrieved from the conflict.\n\nSince that first ceremony, more than 1,300 VC medals have been awarded. There are no barriers of race, sex or rank: its recipients have historically come from across the British Empire and Commonwealth.\n\nFrom the youngest man to receive the VC to the only person to have earned both a VC and an Olympic gold medal, here are 6 record-breaking recipients of the Victoria Cross.\n\nThe first recipient of a Victoria Cross: Charles Lucas\n\nCharles Lucas donning his Victoria Cross. Unknown date and photographer.\n\nThe first known recipient of the VC is recognised as being Charles Lucas, an Irishman from County Monaghan. Although he was the fourth man to physically receive a VC medal, in 1857, his award commemorated the earliest act of bravery for which such an award had been given.\n\nOn 21 June 1854, Lucas was serving aboard the HMS Hecla as part of an Anglo-French fleet in the Crimean War. While approaching a Russian fortress on the Baltic Sea, a live shell landed on Hecla\u2019s top deck with its fuse hissing \u2013 about to go off. Lucas fearlessly approached the shell, picked it up and tossed it overboard.\n\nThe shell exploded a safe distance from the vessel, thanks to Lucas, and nobody on board was injured. This was the first act of valour in British military history to be commemorated by a Victoria Cross.\n\nThe VC medal itself was pinned on Lucas\u2019 chest by Queen Victoria herself on 26 June 1857.\n\nThe youngest recipient of the Victoria Cross: Andrew Fitzgibbon\n\nAccording to the National Army Museum, Andrew Fitzgibbon is the youngest recipient of the VC in history, though some sources content that a Thomas Flinn is tied with Fitzgibbon for the claim to fame. Both men were aged just 15 years and 3 months when they earned their awards.\n\nHailing from Gujarat, India, Fitzgibbon was stationed in China during the Second Opium War (1856-1860). He earned his VC on 21 August 1860, during the storming of the Taku Forts.\n\nFitzgibbon was a hospital apprentice within the Indian Medical Establishment at the time, and he valiantly tended to the wounded throughout the battle \u2013 despite heavy crossfire.\n\nDan chatted to George Morton-Jack and Dr Priya Atwal about the neglected role of the Indian Army during World War One, and how they are working to shed new light on the vital role that these servicemen played. Listen Now\n\nThe only combatant to receive 2 Victoria Crosses: Charles Upham\n\nCharles Upham is popularly recognised as the only military combatant to hold 2 separate VCs \u2013 or the \u2018VC and Bar\u2019, as the accolade is known.\n\nWhile 2 other men also hold a VC and Bar \u2013 Noel Chavasse and Arthur Martin-Leake \u2013 they were both doctors with the Royal Army Medical Corps. Upham, as an infantryman, remains the only combatant to have been awarded 2 VCs.\n\nHailing from New Zealand, Upham was awarded his first VC for actions in Crete in 1941. There, he fearlessly advanced towards enemy lines despite heavy fire, took out several paratroopers and an anti-aircraft gun and then carried an injured soldier to safety. He received his second VC for efforts in Egypt in 1942.\n\nDespite his accolades, Upham shied away from the limelight. Upon being singled out for a VC, he insisted other soldiers he fought beside were more deserving of the award.\n\nA British stamp depicting VC and Bar-holder Captain Charles Upham.\n\nThe only woman to receive an informal Victoria Cross: Elizabeth Webber Harris\n\nWomen have been eligible for the VC since 1921, but none have yet received it. Back in 1869, however, while it was still impossible for women to receive the medal, Elizabeth Webber Harris was granted special permission from Queen Victoria to obtain an unofficial VC.\n\nIn the late 1860s, a cholera epidemic swept across India, and by 1869 it had reached Peshawar \u2013 in the country\u2019s northwest \u2013 where Harris and her husband, Colonel Webber Desborough Harris, were stationed with the 104th Regiment.\n\nCholera devastated the regiment, forcing it to flee to the countryside, and many officers and their family members died. Elizabeth Harris spent months tending to the sick, though, helping to tackle the devastation of the epidemic amongst the soldiers and their families.\n\nShe was awarded the honorary VC for her efforts.\n\nSuzie Grogan talks about the 'hidden illness' of World War One, now better known as shellshock or PTSD. Dan chats with her about the initial reception to cases of shellshock and how diagnoses changed as we understood the problem better over time. Listen Now\n\nThe only holder of a Victoria Cross and an Olympic gold medal: Sir Philip Neame\n\nLieutenant-General Sir Philip Neame, from Kent, is the only man to have received both the VC and an Olympic gold medal.\n\nNeame was granted the VC for his efforts in December 1914, shortly after the outbreak of World War One. While serving with the Royal Engineers in France, he used hand grenades to fend off a German advance.\n\nA decade later, Neame went on to win an Olympic gold medal at the Paris Olympics of 1924. He won the medal in running deer \u2013 a shooting event where teams would fire at a target that simulated the movement of a live deer.\n\nThe oldest recipient of the Victoria Cross: William Raynor\n\nWilliam Raynor was 61 years old when he was awarded the VC in 1857, making him the oldest man in history to be granted the prestigious accolade.\n\nDuring the Indian Mutiny (1857-1858), a widespread but ultimately unsuccessful uprising broke out across the Indian subcontinent against British rule. Raynor was stationed in Delhi at the time and earned the VC for his defense of the Delhi Magazine \u2013 a major ammunition store \u2013 during the conflict.\n\nOn 11 May 1857, rebels attacked the Delhi Magazine. Rather than letting the munitions store fall into rebel hands, Raynor and 8 fellow soldiers blew it up \u2013 with them inside \u2013 using explosives. 5 of the group died in the explosion or soon after, and another of the group later died trying to escape Delhi.\n\nAll 3 of the remaining soldiers \u2013 Raynor, George Forrest and John Buckley \u2013 received the VC, of which Raynor was the oldest.\n\nWith the British military retirement age currently standing at around 60, it\u2019s quite unlikely that William Raynor will lose his place as the oldest Victoria Cross holder any time soon."}, {"url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/victoria-cross-canadian-forces-1.6645954", "page_content": "During the U.S. Civil War, soldiers reported witnessing a peculiar phenomenon that later became known as \"acoustic shadows\" \u2014 a place where the sound and fury of a battle went to die in a great, unseen void.\n\nBecause of the way the din of cannon and rifle fire reflected off the contours of the surrounding countryside \u2014 aided by air temperature and the direction of the wind \u2014 great battles could rage in front of them in almost complete silence.\n\nThat image aptly describes an impassioned, ongoing debate in this country over how to define military valour, and what a Canadian soldier must do to win the country's highest battlefield honour.\n\nThat debate has raged furiously but almost imperceptibly this year among veterans, and even in the halls of Parliament.\n\nCanadian and American troops on a joint patrol in late June 2011, one of the last conducted by Canadians during the war. (Murray Brewster/The Canadian Press )\n\nAt its centre is a growing sense of dismay among some former Canadian soldiers over the military's refusal to recognize some acts of heroism in Afghanistan with the modern version of the Victoria Cross (VC).\n\nThe military says that while it handed out more bravery medals per capita than Canada's allies did during the Afghan mission, no single act by a Canadian soldier unquestionably met the \"extremely rare standard\" needed for the highest honour.\n\nCanada is alone among its major allies in not having honoured any military member with its most prestigious medal. Many with ties to the military community \u2014 including former Conservative leader Erin O'Toole \u2014 wonder if the VC has been put out of reach for soldiers, sailors and aircrew today.\n\nIt's a personal matter for some former soldiers.\n\n'It just didn't feel right'\n\n\"It was always kind of stuck in the back of our minds. It just didn't feel right that nobody got the VC, [that] everyone else gave one out,\" said retired corporal Bruce Moncur, who was gravely wounded when an American ground attack jet accidently strafed Canadian troops in Afghanistan at the start of the milestone 2006 battle known as Operation Medusa.\n\nMore than 40,000 Canadian military members took part in the Afghan campaign \u2014 Canada's longest-ever overseas military campaign. For many of them, the fact that no Canadian who fought in Afghanistan has ever received the VC leaves them feeling as though their war, their devotion and sacrifice, somehow didn't quite measure up.\n\n\"We do feel forgotten. We do feel that our sacrifices are being brushed under the rug, and we do feel as if, you know, there's so many elements of us that just get overlooked,\" said Moncur. He pointed out that while Canadians mark notable First and Second World War events \u2014 even heroic, bloody defeats like Dieppe in 1942 \u2014 \"we don't commemorate the anniversaries of what we just did\" in this generation's war.\n\nThose are fighting words on the eve of Remembrance Day.\n\nBruce Moncur (right) in southern Afghanistan in 2006. (CBC News)\n\n\"As somebody that fought in Afghanistan, as somebody that bled and got shot, I am outraged by the fact that a lot of the guys did not get their proper respect and dues for what they did over there. It's literally \u2014 quite literally \u2014 the least they could do,\" said Moncur.\n\nWhile Canada did not award its modern version of the Victoria Cross for actions in Afghanistan, it did present a host of lesser awards, including 18 Stars of Military Valour (the second-highest designation), 89 other bravery medals and more than 300 \"mentions in dispatches\" \u2014 an official written report to command headquarters describing an individual soldier's gallant conduct.\n\nMoncur and a group of other veterans \u2014 including retired general Rick Hillier, the former chief of the defence staff \u2014 have waged a tireless campaign to get one or more of the military stars of valour awarded in Afghanistan upgraded to a Victoria Cross.\n\nThey have focused their efforts on retired private Jess Larochelle, formerly of Charles Company, 1st Battalion Royal Canadian Regiment.\n\nPte. Jess Larochelle, second from the left in the front row, saved the lives of many Canadian soldiers on Oct. 14, 2006 in Afghanistan. (Submitted by Bruce Moncur)\n\nAfter two members of his section were killed and three were wounded, Larochelle single-handedly kept his smashed outpost in Pashmul, west of Kandahar, from being overrun by more than 20 Taliban fighters in October 2006.\n\nFor his actions, he was awarded the Star of Military Valour.\n\nMoncur said he and other veterans have since learned that Larochelle volunteered to stand his ground, holding the entire line against enormous odds.\n\nBased on that new information, the former soldiers are calling for Larochelle's award to be upgraded. The office of Gov. Gen. Mary Simon, who oversees the award and takes advice from the Department of National Defence (DND) and the country's top military commander, declined to make a decision and referred the request back to DND.\n\nWATCH | No Canadian who fought in Afghanistan has recevied a Victoria Cross: Veterans dismayed over Canada\u2019s refusal to award Victoria Cross Duration 3:27 There is growing frustration among some Canadian veterans over the military\u2019s refusal to recognize acts of heroism in Afghanistan with the modern version of the Victoria Cross, the country\u2019s highest battlefield honour.\n\n\n\nUndeterred, the veterans collected 14,129 names on a petition for the House of Commons asking for a review of the case \u2014 only to be told \"no\" again in an official response last July. Undeterred, the veterans collected 14,129 names on a petition for the House of Commons asking for a review of the case \u2014 only to be told \"no\" again in an official response last July.\n\nThey sought and received O'Toole's backing to introduce a motion in the House of Commons calling for an independent review of how Canada awards military medals. The motion was defeated by the governing Liberals.\n\nMoncur's organization, Valour in the Presence of the Enemy, launched a letter-writing campaign to pressure MPs to review LaRochelle's case. The campaign has sent MPs over 20,000 emails; according to the database that tracks them, the vast majority of those emails were never opened.\n\nThe Victoria Cross and the Commonwealth\n\nThree Commonwealth recipients of the modern VC \u2014 two Australians and one New Zealander \u2014 wrote to offer their support to LaRochelle, who still suffers from poor health and wounds related to the 2006 battle.\n\nThe British awarded three VCs in Afghanistan and one in the Iraq War. The most recent was presented in 2015 to Lance Cpl. Joshua Leakey, of 1st Battalion The Parachute Regiment, for an action in 2013.\n\nThe Australians, slightly more generous, handed out four VCs, mostly to their special forces. The Victoria Cross for New Zealand has been awarded only once \u2014 to Cpl. Willie Apiata, also a special forces soldier, for bravery under fire in Afghanistan in 2004.\n\nSince 2001, the U.S. has awarded its VC equivalent \u2014 the Medal of Honor \u2014 to 20 of its soldiers for actions in Afghanistan. Five of them received the award posthumously.\n\nLt. (RCNVR) Robert Hampton Gray, in a photo taken when he received his pilot wings in September 1941. He received the Victoria Cross posthumously for sinking a Japanese warship in 1945. (Veterans Affairs Canada)\n\nThe last time Canada awarded its top medal for military gallantry was during the Second World War. Lt. Robert Hampton Gray \u2014 who died attacking a Japanese warship in 1945, days before the war ended \u2014 was the last recipient. Up until his death in 2005, Pte. Ernest \"Smokey\" Smith was the last living Canadian VC recipient; he received the medal for action in Italy in 1944.\n\nIn total, 99 Victoria Crosses have been awarded to Canadians or Canadian-born citizens serving with Commonwealth forces. They were all awarded back when the British still administered the medal on behalf of Commonwealth nations.\n\nThe Canadian version of the VC was created in 1993. The actual medal was not struck until 2008.\n\nSoldiers of empire\n\nOf those 99 VCs awarded by the British to Canadians, five were given to Canadian-born soldiers and sailors serving with British forces during the mid-to-late 19th century in campaigns stretching Crimea to Sudan. Some of them were awarded for wars that were fought before Canada was a country.\n\nFive Canadian VC recipients fought in the Boer War. An extraordinary 71 VCs \u2014 many of them posthumous \u2014 were presented to Canadians who fought in the First World War. Another 16 were bestowed on Canadians just over 20 years later in the Second World War.\n\nSo why has no Canadian been singled out for a VC in the decades since?\n\nIt's not due to a lack of valour.\n\nOn what is known as Canada's \"most-decorated day,\" seven Canadian soldiers were awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions near Arras on Sep. 2, 1918. (Canada. Dept. of National Defence/Library and Archives Canada/PA-003179)\n\nTen years ago, the Canadian Press did a comparative analysis. The citations of soldiers who'd won the VC in the First and Second World Wars were placed alongside those for soldiers awarded lesser medals in Afghanistan.\n\nThe analysis found that, in some cases, the modern battlefield feats exceeded what took place in previous wars.\n\nSo what does a Canadian soldier have to do today to win the Victoria Cross?\n\nAccording to Lt.-Col. Carl Gauthier, the head of DND's honours and recognition branch, a VC requires an act of \"pure gallantry\" in the face of the enemy, a deed that goes far beyond what's expected and meets a rather loosely defined \"extremely rare standard.\"\n\n'Pure gallantry'\n\nThe bar is set extremely high, Gauthier told CBC News.\n\n\"And it should be as well, because the Victoria Cross, as you know, is not only Canada's but the Commonwealth's highest honour,\" he said.\n\nHe acknowledged that while this \"rare standard\" is difficult to define, it simply suggests an action that \"would be very, very rarely seen, something of an uncommon nature.\"\n\nIt might, for example, involve a soldier charging an enemy position single-handedly and against overwhelming odds, or someone drawing fire upon themselves to save others. Such extreme cases could involve self-sacrifice, as they did during the world wars.\n\nWhy were no VCs awarded in Afghanistan?\n\n\"It is simply a matter of nobody meeting that absolutely extraordinary high standard that is required for the Victoria Cross,\" Gauthier said.\n\nBefore a military member can even be nominated, at least two comrades must confirm in writing that they witnessed an act of \"pure gallantry.\"\n\nA 'mythic pedestal'\n\nA VC nomination must pass through no less than three committees of senior officers \u2014 one in-theatre, one at the operational command level and one at the most senior level of the military \u2014 before it can be passed on to the Governor General.\n\n\"It was perhaps more generously given in its early decades of existence, for the very simple reason that there were not as many gallantry decorations as we have now,\" Gauthier said.\n\nAsked to explain the discrepancy between Canada's approach to the VC and those of its major allies, Gauthier said that Canada handed out more bravery medals for the size of its contingent than other allies.\n\nO'Toole, an air force veteran, said he doesn't buy that explanation and believes the military as an institution is being ultra-cautious \u2014 even stingy \u2014 with its praise.\n\nFormer Conservative leader Erin O'Toole says he wonders whether he'll ever see another Canadian receive the Victoria Cross. (Blair Gable/Reuters)\n\nHe said he wonders whether he'll ever see another Canadian receive a Victoria Cross.\n\n\"It's been placed on this kind of mythic pedestal,\" O'Toole said, adding that he thinks \"people were nervous about awarding it\" during the Afghan war.\n\nHe said he's disappointed that the federal government wouldn't even consider an independent review of Canada's process for issuing military awards \u2014 something he said our allies do regularly.\n\n\"We have to be mature enough to recognize we don't always get it right,\" he said.\n\nO'Toole said he's also somewhat mystified by how the military, with all of its symbolism and pageantry, doesn't seem to recognize the power of heroism to inspire.\n\n\"It's much like we have [with] the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It's one soldier, but he represents the generations that fought,\" he said.\n\n\"We also need to recognize the extraordinary valour and sacrifice represented by an individual act.\"\n\nGauthier, meanwhile, said the department is cautious about military awards because it doesn't want to undermine what they represent.\n\n\"I think it's a desire from all involved throughout the chain of command to make sure that when we award one, it will be clearly and fully earned in everybody's eyes, in order to protect the integrity and respect of that, the highest honour that the Crown and the people of Canada can give to one of its soldiers,\" Gauthier said.\n\n\"People will judge us when we award the first and we want that one to be absolutely unquestionable.\"\n\nA review of the medals given out during the Afghanistan campaign was conducted in 2012 and it found all had been awarded appropriately.\n\nUnconvinced, Moncur has asked for the minutes of the review board and documents associated with it. DND has not answered his request yet \u2014 something he attributes to the military's top-down mindset.\n\n\"Never question what we're doing, always just put your boots together and salute and accept the decision for what it is,\" he said. \"And I think that's unacceptable.\""}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Major-Clement-Walker-Heneage-VC/6000000024479229261", "page_content": "About Major Clement Walker-Heneage, VC\n\nWikipedia Biographical Summary\n\nMajor Clement Walker-Heneage, VC (6 March 1831 \u2013 9 December 1901) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.\n\nEarly life\n\nWalker-Heneage was born in 1831, the eldest son of George Heneage Walker-Heneage, MP for Devizes 1838-1857.\n\nArmy career\n\nEntering the army, he served with the 8th Hussars in the Crimean War (1853-56), and was present at many engagements of that campaign, including the battles of Alma, Balaclava, Inkerman, Tcherna\u00efa, and the Siege of Sevastopol.
