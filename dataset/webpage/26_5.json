{"Thomas Harriot studied mathematics, astronomy, optics, and navigation.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Harriot", "page_content": "Thomas Harriot, also spelled Hariot, (born 1560, Oxford, Eng.\u2014died July 2, 1621, London), mathematician, astronomer, and investigator of the natural world.\n\nLittle is known of him before he received his bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of Oxford in 1580. Throughout his working life, he was supported by the patronage, at different times, of Sir Walter Raleigh and Henry Percy, the 9th earl of Northumberland; he was never, after his student years, affiliated with an academic institution or commercial organization. From 1585 to 1586 he participated in Raleigh\u2019s colony on Roanoke Island, and he may have visited Virginia as early as 1584; upon his return, he published A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia (1588). This was his only work published during his lifetime. Very soon after the Virginia sojourn, Harriot was living on and surveying Raleigh\u2019s estates in Ireland.\n\nBritannica Quiz All About Astronomy\n\nIn 1595 Percy settled upon Harriot an estate in Durham, England, and soon provided him with a house near London, which he also used as a scientific laboratory to pursue original research in astronomy, meteorology, optics, and what are now characterized as pure and applied mathematics. In particular, he performed experiments in ballistics and the refraction of light. He was one of the first, if not the first, to consider the imaginary roots of equations. Much of his earliest as well as latest mathematical work bore on questions of navigation, including such issues as the construction of rhumb lines (or loxodromes) on sailing charts. He also devised a novel form of cross-staff, an early navigational instrument. (See navigation: latitude measurements.) Although, after his early voyages, he pursued a life of research, it was not a life free of turmoil, since his principal patron, Raleigh, was imprisoned in 1603 in the Tower of London on orders of King James I of England. Harriot witnessed Raleigh\u2019s execution in 1618. In the turmoil following the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605, Harriot was arrested upon suspicion of having cast the king\u2019s horoscope, though he was soon released. (Percy, as a co-conspirator in the plot, joined Raleigh in the Tower of London.) From the early 1590s, Harriot had developed a reputation for atheism and was referred to rather obliquely as a conjurer by Raleigh\u2019s enemies. However, there is nothing in Harriot\u2019s writings or those of his friends to substantiate any non-Christian beliefs; the accusations may merely reflect his likely belief in atomism, which at the time was considered by some to obviate the necessity for the existence of God.\n\nConcurrently with Galileo Galilei\u2019s introduction of telescopic observations of the heavens in 1609, Harriot commenced telescopic observations, some systematic, others not. He drew charts of the Moon, followed the paths of the moons of Jupiter, and observed sunspots. He also observed comets.\n\nDuring his lifetime Harriot was known in England among the philosophically inclined, and his reputation extended to the continent to the extent that the astronomer Johannes Kepler initiated a correspondence with him. His only other book, however, was the posthumously published Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas Resolvendas (1631; \u201cApplication of Analytical Art to Solving Algebraic Equations\u201d). (The editor of this work introduced the signs \u2219 for multiplication, > for greater than, and < for less than.) Although Harriot published little and kept some of his studies secret, such as the discovery of the sine law of refraction (now known as Snell\u2019s law), his work was not done in isolation; he drew around himself a group of admiring scholars, at least some of whom were cognizant of some of his discoveries. In subsequent centuries Harriot was never forgotten, but it has been mainly since the mid-20th century that scholars have made close and systematic studies of his thousands of pages of manuscripts and uncovered the full extent of his investigations."}, {"url": "https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Harriot/", "page_content": "20\n\n1577\n\n1560\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1580\n\n1583\n\n1587\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1584\n\n1585\n\n86\n\n9\n\n1585\n\n19\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1586\n\n1586\n\n1588\n\n1589\n\n1590\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1590\n\n1595\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1597\n\n1597\n\n1601\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1621\n\n20\n\n1637\n\n1590\n\n1590\n\n1607\n\n1600\n\n1599\n\n1600\n\n24\n\n1603\n\n(\n\n)\n\n4\n\n1605\n\n27\n\n1621\n\n1605\n\n1605\n\n1606\n\n(\n\n)\n\n17\n\n1607\n\n(\n\n)\n\n26\n\n1609\n\n9\n\n5\n\n6\n\n17\n\n1610\n\n10\n\n20\n\n1611\n\n32\n\n17\n\n1610\n\n26\n\n1612\n\n199\n\n8\n\n1610\n\n18\n\n1613\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1614\n\n1618\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1618\n\n1603\n\n29\n\n1618\n\n1613\n\n1615\n\n(\n\n)\n\n12\n\n1591\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1998\n\n(\n\n)\n\n4\n\n(\n\n)\n\na , b , c a, b, c a , b , c\n\n( x \u2212 a ) ( x \u2212 b ) ( x \u2212 c ) = 0 (x - a)(x - b)(x - c) = 0 ( x \u2212 a ) ( x \u2212 b ) ( x \u2212 c ) = 0\n\n(1631)\n\n10\n\nwas a mathematician and astronomer who founded the English school of algebra. He is described inby Fauvel and Goulding as:-yet his name has only recently become widely known, and even now his achievements are not fully appreciated by most mathematicians.We know very little of Harriot's youth. In fact all that is known is that on FridayDecemberhe matriculated at the University of Oxford with an entry in the official records giving his age as seventeen, his father as a plebeian, and his birthplace Oxfordshire. It is from this record that his date of birth is deduced to beand we know that his father was a \"commoner\" but the very fact that Harriot was entering Oxford means that it is unlikely that he came from the poorest classes. Despite extensive searches of the Oxfordshire records, no further information concerning his birth or parentage has been foundalthough a number of possible relatives have been identifiedAs an undergraduate at Oxford, Harriot was a student at St Mary's Hall. He became friends with Richard Hakluyt and Thomas Allen, both lecturers at the university, but not at St Mary's Hall. Harriot graduated inand went to London. It is not clear exactly what he did in his first few years there but, probably from late, he entered Sir Walter Raleigh's service. Hakluyt, dedicating a preface to Raleigh in February, wrotesee for example:-Harriot wrote a text called Arcticon which was never published and unfortunately no copies have ever been found. This work was essentially his lecture course given at Durham House, Raleigh's lodgings in The Strand in London, where Harriot lived at this time. The lectures were given to the seamen who were being gathered by Raleigh to participate in his expeditions to the New World. Pepper describes the advances in navigational techniques made by Harriot by the time he wrote Arcticon:-As Roche notes in:-It was not only as a navigational instructor that Raleigh employed Harriot. He was involved with the design of the ships for Raleigh's expeditions as well as being involved in the construction of the vessels and selecting the seamen. He was Raleigh's accountant, being responsible for obtaining funding for the expeditions and keeping all the accounts.Raleigh had the captains Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe make an expedition to Roanoke Island off the coast of North Carolina in. Although there is no direct evidence that Harriot made this voyage, Quinn inargues convincingly that he was one of those making this preliminary survey. Harriot was certainly on a voyage to Virginia organised by Raleigh in. He sailed from Plymouth onAprilon board the Tiger and his observations of a solar eclipse onApril have allowed modern scientists to compute the exact position of the ship on that day. Harriot made many notes during his time in the New World, being particularly interested in the language and customsparticularly the eating habitsof the inhabitants. The object of the voyage was to colonise the New World but it was not successful in this aim.Drake was engaged in sea battles with the Spanish when he learnt that they intended to prevent the British colonists becoming established. Although Drake met up with the colonists, in Junethere were severe storms and there was a hurried return to England by Harriot and most of the party. Harriot, together with Drake's ships, landed at Portsmouth in Julyand he went immediately to Raleigh to report on the expedition. He published A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia in, a book in which he recommends the smoking of tobacco which he himself had learnt to do in Virginia. However, he also wrote a full account of the voyage which, for some reason, he never published and, despite strenuous attempts to find a copy, seems lost.By the time Harriot had returned, Raleigh had turned his attention to Ireland. Harriot carried out surveys of the Lismore estate, which was owned by Raleigh, beginning in. Nine years later he was still involved in working out the acreage of plots being leased on the estate. However the political situation was about to change and this would have dramatic implications for Harriot.Already in thes there were allegations against Raleigh of atheism. The charges were against Raleigh's school and \"the conjurer that is master thereof\". Harriot felt that this was a reference to him and he discussed the allegations with John Dee who also felt that the charges might relate to him. There is no reason to believe that Harriotor Raleighwere atheists but certainly they were free thinkers and Harriot's scientific approach to the world was, to say the least, viewed with great suspicion by the church. As well as problems caused by allegations, Dee and Harriot discussed scientific and mathematical matters in thes.Harriot had now moved from working for Raleigh to working for Henry Percy, Duke of Northumberland. The Duke had around him a circle of friends who were scholars, many of whom held a atomistic views. Raleigh's life became so chaotic that Harriot had sought the support of a patron who could provide more stability for his scientific pursuits. Inthe Duke made property in Durham over to Harriot and he moved up the social ladder becoming a member of the \"landed gentry\". Harriot also later held estates in Cornwall and Norfolk. Not long after the Durham transaction, the Duke gave Harriot the use of one of the houses on the estate at Syonnear Kew outside Londonwhich Harriot used both as a residence and as a scientific laboratory.We certainly know from manuscripts which survive that Harriot was engaged in deep studies of optics at Syon by. Although init states that he had discovered the sine law of refraction of light before, in fact we now know that the precise date of Harriot's important discovery was July. As with all his other mathematical discoveries, however, Harriot did not publish his findings. It is somewhat ironical, however, that Snell to whom the discovery of this law is now attributedwas not the first to publish the result. Snell 's discovery was in, aboutyears after Harriot's discovery, but the result was not published until Descartes put it in print inOne of the optical problems which Harriot did study in thes was Alhazen 's problem. He gave a solution to Alhazen 's problem which involved considering an equivalent problem, namely the problem of the maximum intercept formed between a circle and a diameter of a chord rotating about a point on a circle. The author ofconjectures that Harriot may have used infinitesimal techniques in demonstrating the equivalence of these problems, and certainly we know that Harriot introduced ideas later rediscovered by Barrow Optics was not the only topic to occupy Harriot during this period. He had been asked by Raleigh in the earlys to apply his mathematical skills to the science of gunnery. At this time ideas of the trajectory taken by a projectile were still dominated by Aristotle 's thinking. Harriot resolved the forces acting on the projectile into horizontal and vertical components. He understood that air resistance acted throughout the whole flight, and that gravity acted on the vertical component. He came very close to a vector analysis solution of the problem of finding the velocity of the projectile and, certainly by, he came to the conclusion that the path of the projectile was a tilted parabola . He made one error, however,:-Other topics which Harriot began to work on beforewere problems of chemistry. He worked intensively on chemistry for almost exactly a year from Mayto Mayand, although his experiments were conducted with a new scientific precision, he made no discoveries of particular note.Raleigh had been a particular favourite of Elizabeth I and, when she died onMarch, it was clear that Raleigh's fortunes would change. Perhaps it is less clear that Harriot, by this time not so closely associated with Raleigh, would find problems too. James I became king and he quickly saw Raleigh as someone opposed to his claims to the throne. Henry Percy, the Duke of Northumberland, had taken care to put himself on a good footing with James with a letter of support for him only days before Elizabeth died. In July plots were discovered against James and Raleigh was arrested and charged with high treason.Raleigh attempted suicide but failed. He then sought Harriot's help in obtaining evidence on his behalf. Raleigh was convicted and sentenced to death by hanging. Poor Harriot was singled out in the judgement as being an atheist and an evil influence. His attempts to help Raleigh had been based on Christian principlesto which undoubtedly he adheredbut this had rather damaged Raleigh as Harriot was seen an atheist using Christian principles for convenience. Harriot was devastated and for about a year undertook no new scientific work as he tried to come to terms with what was happening. Raleigh received a last-minute reprieve from the death sentence but was imprisoned in the Tower of London.Another plot was to lead to further trouble. OnNovemberGuy Fawkes and others were arrested for attempting to blow up the Houses of Parliament. Four others, including Thomas Percy, the grandson of Henry Percy, were also arrested as the main conspirators. Harriot was held on suspicion of being involved and imprisoned in the Gatehouse. He was interrogated on the charge that he had cast a horoscope of King James in an attempt to use magical powers to influence the King's future. OnNovember Henry Percy, Harriot's patron, was also put in the Tower where he remained untilwhen he was released. No evidence seems to have been found against Harriot and, although he remained in the Gatehouse for some while writing several letters requesting his release, he was a free man probably by the end ofAs soon as he was released, Harriot returned to his work on optics. He now considered more complex systems and employed Christopher Tooke as a lens grinder from early. His work on light now moved to the dispersion of light into colours. He began to develop a theory for the rainbow and, by Kepler had heard of the remarkable results on optics achieved by Harriot. Kepler wrote to Harriot, but the correspondence never really achieved any significant exchange of ideas. Perhaps Harriot was too wary of the difficulties that his work had nearly brought on him, or perhaps he didas he claimed to Kepler ) still intend to publish his results if his health permitted. still intend to publish his results if his health permitted.\n\n\n\nThe appearance of a comet attracted Harriot's attention and turned his scientific mind towards astronomy. He observed a comet on The appearance of a comet attracted Harriot's attention and turned his scientific mind towards astronomy. He observed a comet on 17 September September 1607 from Ilfracombe which would later be identified as from Ilfracombe which would later be identified as Halley's Comet. 's Comet. Kepler had discovered the comet six days earlier but it would be the observations of Harriot and his friend had discovered the comet six days earlier but it would be the observations of Harriot and his friend ( and student and student ) William Lower which eventually were used by William Lower which eventually were used by Bessel to compute its orbit. to compute its orbit.\n\n\n\nHis astronomy brought back to the fore, Harriot went on to make the earliest telescopic observations in England. On His astronomy brought back to the fore, Harriot went on to make the earliest telescopic observations in England. On 26 July July 1609 at at 9 p.m. he sketched the Moon which was at that time p.m. he sketched the Moon which was at that time 5 days old, viewing it through a telescope with a magnification of days old, viewing it through a telescope with a magnification of 6 .

I saw but one and that alone\n\nhe must have already been aware of\n\n's discovery. As with all his scientific discoveries, Harriot did not publish his results. These observations of Jupiter's moons were made between\n\n17\n\nOctober\n\n1610\n\nand\n\n26\n\nFebruary\n\n1612\n\n.\n\nHe was the first to discover sunspots, making\n\n199\n\nobservations between\n\n8\n\nDecember\n\n1610\n\nand\n\n18\n\nJanuary\n\n1613\n\n. The first observation of sunspots was made while he was observing Jupiter's moons. From the data he collected he was able to deduce the period of the Sun's rotation. However, around this time his scientific work basically came to an end. He seems to have had his spirits brought low by the deaths of his friends and lost the spirit to continue research\n\n(\n\nwhich had brought him much trouble despite his lack of publications\n\n)\n\n.\n\nOf the few pieces of work done by Harriot after\n\n1614\n\n, one was his observation of another comet in\n\n1618\n\n(\n\nthere were three visible comets that year and Harriot observed the third\n\n)\n\nfrom Syon House. In\n\n1618\n\nRaleigh, who had been shown the clemency of imprisonment in\n\n1603\n\nrather than death, was put to death. Raleigh was executed on\n\n29\n\nOctober\n\n1618\n\nin a public execution, with Harriot present to witness the event. However, by this time Harriot was already suffering from the cancer of the nose which eventually led to his death.\n\nThe cancer seems to have started around\n\n1613\n\n, about the time when Harriot lost interest in pushing forward his mathematical and scientific research. He consulted the top specialist in\n\n1615\n\nwho wrote report on the consultation. He described Harriot as\n\n(\n\nsee for example\n\n)\n\n:-\n\n... a man somewhat melancholy. ... A cancerous ulcer in the left nostril eats up the septum of his nose and in proportion to its size holds the lips hard and turned upwards. It has gradually crept well into the nose. This evil the patient has suffered the last two years.\n\nHarriot would suffer this \"evil\" for a further three years before the cancer took his life.\n\nThere are a few other major mathematical achievements due to Harriot which we should mention. He exhibited the logarithmic spiral as the\n\nof a\n\non a sphere, a projection he proved to be\n\n. The loxodromes are the straight lines on the\n\nmap, which Harriot computed with great precision. In fact in order to achieve this degree of precision, Harriot introduced finite-difference interpolation.\n\nThere is an interesting history to a problem which has only recently been solved, yet originated with Harriot. Raleigh asked Harriot to solve certain problems regarding the stacking of cannonballs. On a manuscript dated\n\n12\n\nDecember\n\n1591\n\n(\n\nSunday\n\n)\n\n, Harriot set out a table to answer Raleigh's questions. He shows how, if the number of cannonballs is given, one can compute the number of cannonballs to be placed in the base of a pyramid with a triangular, square or oblong base. Raleigh posed a second question, which Harriot also answered, namely given the pyramid of cannonballs, compute the number in the pile.\n\nHarriot was too much the mathematician to stop there, however. From a study of how the cannonballs could fill space, he considered the implications for the\n\nof matter which he believed in. Later, in his correspondence with\n\nabout atomic theory, Harriot mentioned the packing problem.\n\ncould not solve the problem but he believed that the densest packing of spheres would be attained if in each layer the centres of the spheres were above the centres of the holes in the layer below. This seems intuitively obvious, but resisted proof until\n\n1998\n\nwhen Thomas Hales of the University of Michigan\n\n(\n\nwith the help of hours of computer generated data\n\n)\n\nfinally proved the conjecture.\n\nThe one part of Harriot's work which we have not yet described is the mathematical work for which, in some ways, he is best known, namely his work on algebra. He introduced a simplified notation for algebra and his fundamental research on the theory of equations was far ahead of its time. As an example of his abilities to solve equations, even when the roots are negative or imaginary, we reproduce his solution of an equation of degree\n\n4\n\n. The example in question is in his own handwriting and reproduced in\n\n.\n\naaaa - 6aa + 136a = 1155 ------------------------------------ aaaa -2aa + 1 = 4aa -136a + 1156 aa - 1 = 2a - 34 33 = 2a - aa aa - 2a = -33 aa - 2a + 1 = +1 - 33 a - 1 = \u221a-32 1 - a = \u221a-32 a = 1 + \u221a-32 a = 1 - \u221a-32 ------------------------------------ aa - 1 = 34 - 2a aa + 2a = 35 aa + 2a + 1 = 1 + 35 a + 1 = \u221a36 a = \u221a36 - 1 = 5 ------------------------------------ -a - 1 = \u221a36 a = -\u221a36 - 1 = -7\n\n.\n\nHarriot invented certain symbols which are used today. However, the symbols < for \"less than\" and > for \"greater than\" were not due to Harriot\n\n(\n\nas is often claimed\n\n)\n\n, but were introduced by the editor of Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas Resolvendas\n\n\u24c9 ( The analytical art by which algebraic equations can be resolved )\n\n- Harriot himself used different symbols. There is still scholarly debate on how much Harriot was influenced by\n\n, or whether notation and ideas introduced by\n\nwere learnt by him from Harriot.\n\nAs we have seen from the example above, Harriot did outstanding work on the solution of equations, recognising negative roots and complex roots in a way that makes his solutions look like a present day solution. He made the observation that if\n\na , b , c a, b, c a , b , c\n\nare the roots of a\n\nthen the cubic is\n\n( x \u2212 a ) ( x \u2212 b ) ( x \u2212 c ) = 0 (x - a)(x - b)(x - c) = 0 ( x \u2212 a ) ( x \u2212 b ) ( x \u2212 c ) = 0\n\n. This is a major step forward in understanding which Harriot then carried forward to equations of higher degree.\n\nAlthough he was far ahead of his time, his work had far less influence than it should have done since, as we have remarked repeatedly above, he published no mathematical work in his lifetime. Even his work on algebra Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas Resolvendas\n\n(1631)\n\nwas published\n\n10\n\nyears after his death and was edited by people who did not fully appreciate the depth of his work. For example, it does not discuss negative solutions.\n\nReferences (show)\n\nJ A Lohne, Biography in Dictionary of Scientific Biography ( New York 1970 - 1990) .\n\nSee THIS LINK.

Thomas Harriot (1560\u20131621) left behind a considerable body of manuscripts on a wide range of subjects, including mathematics, optics, alchemy, astronomy, and mechanics. The core of this volume is the question of Harriot\u2019s status as a mathematician, or as a natural philosopher, and specifically whether it is correct to describe him as an \u201cEnglish Galileo.\u201d As the essays by Jacqueline Stedall, Jon Pepper, and Ian Maclean attest, Harriot\u2019s brilliance as a mathematician is incontestable. Pepper places Harriot squarely in the great mathematical tradition stretching from Eudoxus to Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te, emphasizing the originality of his work on the binomial theorem, exponential series, and triangular numbers. Harriot\u2019s move from geometrical to algebraic formulations of problems, Pepper argues, is the \u201cmost notable\u201d aspect of his mathematics (25); Stedall focuses precisely on the systematic nature of Harriot\u2019s algebraic work, looking closely at Harriot\u2019s new methods of solving quadratic and other polynomial equations (which made significant advances on the published work of his French contemporary Vi\u00e8te); Maclean\u2019s essay looks at Harriot\u2019s abiding interest in combinations and permutations.\n\nMatthias Schemmel and John Henry, however, have very different conceptions of Harriot\u2019s career. For Schemmel (author of The English Galileo [2009]), Harriot\u2019s work on projectile trajectories and free fall makes an instructive parallel with the natural-philosophical achievements of Galileo. Schemmel\u2019s historical-epistemological approach attends to the different \u201cinferential pathways\u201d followed by Harriot and Galileo in their works on mechanics based on a very similar body of \u201cshared knowledge\u201d (106\u201310). Working independently on the same \u201cchallenging problems\u201d in ballistics, Schemmel argues, Harriot and Galileo raised \u201cvirtually identical questions\u201d about central problems in mechanics (92). Schemmel points out that Harriot\u2019s knowledge of free fall and the shape of ballistic trajectories by 1621 was essentially the same as Galileo\u2019s in 1638, with both employing the same inclined-plane conception of projectile motion (98\u2013101). If anything, Harriot was \u201cmore successful than Galileo in consistently relating the concept of velocity to the graphical representation of motion\u201d (110). For Schemmel, then, Harriot\u2019s achievements entitle him to be considered an \u201cEnglish Galileo,\u201d and at the least suggest a \u201cconvergence of the lines of development in Early Modern Mechanics\u201d (111).\n\nWhile not explicitly refuting Schemmel\u2019s claims, Henry argues that while Galileo amalgamated \u201cspeculative natural philosophy with mathematical and experimental traditions,\u201d Harriot \u201cremained first and foremost a mathematical practitioner\u201d (117\u201318). While he concedes that there are some elements of Harriot\u2019s work that could be construed as natural philosophical (his work on optics, impacts, and atomism), and says that \u201cHarriot was willing to play the natural philosopher sometimes\u201d (130), he ultimately sees Harriot\u2019s forays into natural philosophy as either a failure or a symptom of his \u201cuncompromising perfectionism\u201d (134, 136\u201337). For Henry, Harriot must be excluded from a list of figures (like Galileo and Descartes) who were both mathematicians and natural philosophers, who mediated between what Jim Bennett has called \u201cthe mechanics\u2019 philosophy\u201d and mechanical philosophy, because his work shows little interest in causal explanations (132).\n\nRobert Goulding\u2019s essay paints a different picture. Harriot\u2019s work on optics, he argues, was \u201cconnected with his abiding concern with the structure of matter\u201d (32), and he shows that Harriot\u2019s understanding of refraction was based on an atomistic model (41\u201343) and that his optical experiments were a \u201cspecies of alchemical experimentation\u201d (48). Harriot\u2019s experiments on color dispersion were more thorough than those of Newton sixty years later (37), and his work on refraction established \u201cthe most important new optical principles since Ptolemy\u201d (33). Stephen Pumfrey, working within the perspective of patronage studies, compares Harriot\u2019s failure to publish his lost navigational treatise, the Arcticon (ca. 1583), with Edward Wright\u2019s published Certaine errors in navigation (1599). This highly instructive comparison shows the importance of \u201cpatronly support\u201d for print publication of specialized works (143) and seeks to demonstrate that Harriot\u2019s often-discussed \u201cfailure\u201d to print was in fact \u201cnormal\u201d in late sixteenth-century England, where mathematicians and their patrons were often \u201ccontent with manuscript circulation\u201d (143). Mark Nicholls reflects on the fortunes of Harriot\u2019s patron Walter Raleigh, while Pascal Brioist argues that Harriot\u2019s experiences on the voyages to Virginia sponsored by Raleigh show Harriot\u2019s \u201cspecial capacity to absorb all sorts of practical knowledge\u201d (200) in his notes on the language of seamen and his methodical taxonomy of the sails and riggings of the ships on which he sailed to the New World. Now that Harriot\u2019s manuscripts (through the heroic efforts of Stedall, Schemmel, and Goulding) are available online via ECHO (http://echo.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/content/scientific_revolution/harriot), we can expect more work on this intriguing figure, and more searching questions of the kind raised by this excellent volume."}, {"url": "https://echo.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/content/scientific_revolution/harriot", "page_content": "The work of the English mathematician and philosopher Thomas Harriot (1560-1621) is amazingly broad, ranging from the concern with linguistic and ethnological questions to the theory of algebraic equations. In particular, topics of practical mathematics and natural philosophy that concerned also Galileo, such as fortification, shipbuilding, astronomy, optics, and mechanics, play a central role in Harriot's work. However, unlike his famous Italian contemporary, Harriot did not publish any of his scientific results, the only exception being a small report on his voyage to the New World that he undertook as versatile expert in the service of his first patron, Sir Walter Ralegh. Harriot's work therefore has to be reconstructed from his manuscripts. This fact has considerably hampered Harriot's reception, not only by his contemporaries, but also in the history of science.\n\nHere, for the first time, a large selection from Harriot's manuscripts is made openly accessible through an electronic presentation: Harriot's notes on motion. Harriot left about 8,000 folio pages mainly containing his working notes and only few pages prepared for presentation (Add MSS 6782 - 6789 in der British Library and HMC 240, 241 in Petworth House, Sussex). The selection presented here contains about 350 folio pages preserved in the British Library. The folios have been chosen in a survey of the total of 8,000 pages by rough analysis of their contents in the attempt to produce a collection as complete as possible.\n\nThe notes document Harriot's work on the problem of motion in which he is primarily concerned with projectile motion and the motion of fall. The manuscripts are, however, highly unordered. Based on the results of scholarly work, the electronic presentation will in the near future be increasingly complemented with navigational tools that shall make the manuscripts more accessible."}, {"url": "https://plus.maths.org/content/thomas-harriot-lost-pioneer", "page_content": "It's International Year of Astronomy and all eyes are on Galileo Galilei, whose astronomical observations 400 years ago revolutionised our understanding of the Universe. But few people know that Galileo wasn't the first to build a telescope and turn it on the stars. That honour falls to a little-known mathematician called Thomas Harriot, who might have become a household name, had he bothered to publish his results. This article is a tour of his work.\n\nThis portrait was once believed to be of Thomas Harriot, but modern evidence indicates that it is probably not him.\n\nWhen the prestigious Royal Society was established in 1660, it quickly launched a seven year search for the lost papers of Thomas Harriot, a London mathematician and empirical scientist who had died decades before. The quest failed, but when the papers finally came to light a century later, they included a system of symbolic algebra, workable binary numbers, the sine law of refraction and detailed telescopic observations of the Moon and sunspots: all mathematical and scientific firsts. While Harriot's intellectual achievements had been gathering dust, much of his pioneering work was discovered by others, so his name never made it into the history books.\n\nWe know little of Thomas Harriot's background and early life and we can't even be sure of what he looked like \u2014 the authenticity of the portrait on the right is disputed. He was born around 1560, four years before Galileo and a lifetime ahead of Newton. Soon after graduating from Oxford University in 1580, he was living and working in the London home of Walter Raleigh, then one of Queen Elizabeth's favoured courtiers. Acting as Raleigh's accountant, Harriot tutored sea captains in navigation and gained early fame as an anthropologist and ethnographer.\n\nFinding his way in the world\n\nAt Raleigh's instruction, the twenty-five year old Harriot spent a year in present-day North Carolina on the first, and ill-fated, expedition to set up a New World British colony, on Roanoke Island. Charged with mapping and surveying the new country, Harriot also documented the area's natural history and the customs of the local Algonquin peoples. He viewed the indigenous inhabitants as rightful owners of their land and was probably the first Englishman to communicate with them in their own language, even inventing an alphabet to represent their unique range of linguistic sounds. On his return home he published A briefe and true account of the new found land of Virginia with John White, the first English-language publication on the Americas and one that's still studied on early American literature courses. Harriot also promoted the new habit of smoking tobacco, recommending it as it \"purgeth superfluous fleame and ... openeth all the pores and passages of the body\".\n\nMercator's projection enlarges areas close to the poles. The red circles indicate the level of distortion. The spacing between the lines of latitude increases as you move towards the poles. Image courtesy Stefan Kuhn.\n\nDuring his time with Raleigh, Harriot focused his mathematical efforts on navigational matters. The map of the Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator was already revolutionising marine navigation, and even today is still the most familiar representation of our world. The Mercator projection was so valuable to marine navigation because it transforms lines of constant bearing on the surface of the Earth (the paths traced out when following a fixed direction as given by a compass) into straight line segments on the map. But like all projections of the spherical Earth onto a two-dimensional map, the Mercator projection comes with some distortion, in this case enlarging the areas near the poles. A measure of this distortion is the spacing between the lines of latitude, which increases towards the poles.\n\nUnfortunately, Mercator had not explained how to calculate the spacing of the lines of latitude on his chart, leaving future map makers none the wiser about the exact distortion of dimensions. In the 1580s Harriot gave a mathematical explanation of the progressive increase of distances between them, and some years later he computed tables of these meridional parts. It was left to Harriot's contemporary, English Cartographer Edward Wright, however, to publish the first table of latitudes in 1599. Some years later the Scottish mathematician John Napier invented the logarithm, enabling us to express the height on the map of a line of latitude with angle on the globe as\n\nGetting light right\n\nwhereis the radius of the Earth, and the equator is given by the line\n\nWhen Raleigh fell out of favour with the Queen for secretly marrying one of her ladies-in-waiting, he was imprisoned in the Tower and Harriot fell under the patronage of Sir Henry Percy, the ninth Earl of Northumberland. Known as the \"wizard\" earl for his free-thinking interest in science, Northumberland provided Harriot with a handsome pension of \u00a380 a year, spacious rooms at his London home, Syon House (where Harriot lived for over twenty years) and the services of a talented technical assistant. Harriot was now free to pursue a range of scientific interests, but his focus remained on the mathematics relating to seafaring, navigation, surveying and astronomy.\n\nThe law of refraction relates the angle at which a ray of light meets the medium (\u03b8 1 ) to the angle of refraction (\u03b8 2 ).\n\nInspired by his own observations at sea, he developed techniques for correcting errors in navigational tools such as the cross staff, an instrument used to determine a ship's latitude by measuring the altitude of the Sun or pole star. His consideration of the effect of the refraction of light in the atmosphere on these observations may have been what drove him to embark on a systematic experimental and mathematical study of how light is bent by different media.\n\nFrom the updated table he scrawled in a published book on optics, it's probable these experiments resulted in Harriot calculating the sine law of refraction, which relates the angle at which a ray of light hits the surface of a medium to the angle by which the ray is bent by the medium. Although the law, stated below, had already been mentioned in a tenth century manuscript by the Arab mathematician Ibn Sahl, Harriot and his contemporaries were unaware of this. Harriot's notes do not state the law explicitly, but the table of angles he derived is too exact to be a result of experiment. His faith in the power of mathematics to describe physical laws must have encouraged him to interpret the results geometrically, and he must have been aware that the ratio of the sines of the two angles remains constant. In fact, it is equal to the ratio of the speed at which light travels through air and the speed at which light travels through the medium:\n\nWith applications for lens design, this relationship would have been of interest for Harriot's later work developing perspective trunckes or telescopes. The Dutch mathematician Willebrord Snellius shared his own discovery of the sine law with friends twenty years after Harriot's work but, though the law is now named after Snellius (also called Snell), it was actually Ren\u00e9 Descartes who formally published it another decade later.\n\nBallistics, cannonballs and fireworks\n\nWith seafaring comes warfare, and in the early 17th century Harriot correctly depicted the path of a projectile as a tilted parabola, where the descending segment is shorter and steeper than the ascending one, by taking into account gravity acting on the vertical component and air resistance on the horizontal. Galileo experimented with projectiles a few years later, but the parabolic theory was actually published by Bonaventura Cavalieri, one of Galileo's disciples.\n\nOn November 4th 1605, Harriot had the misfortune to dine at Syon with his patron, Northumberland, and a distant cousin of the Earl, Thomas Percy, who turned out to be a key conspirator in the gunpowder plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament. Three days later, Percy was dead and both Northumberland and Harriot were arrested. Harriot spent a month in the Gatehouse Prison in Westminster, accused by King James I, who distrusted mathematicians as astrologers and magicians, of secretly casting a horoscope on him. Harriot wrote to the Privy Council protesting his innocence, denying any meddling in matters of state and describing himself as \"contented with a private life for the love of learning that I may study freely.\" He was released a few weeks later. Northumberland was sentenced to life imprisonment in the Tower, where Harriot regularly visited both him and Raleigh, now sentenced to death for high treason.\n\nThe face-centred cubic packing (left) consists of layers of spheres. Each layer is positioned so that the spheres rest on the 'holes' of the layer below. This arrangement is not unique, the hexagonal close packing (right) is constructed in a similar way and is equally efficient.\n\nHarriot remained at Syon and soon entered into correspondence with the German mathematician Johannes Kepler, discussing, among other things, the problem of stacking spheres. Harriot had previously drawn up charts showing the ground space needed to store stacks of cannonballs on board Raleigh's ships, and had become intrigued by the question of how to stack the balls most efficiently. This was no doubt the prompter for Kepler's suggestion in 1611 that the most efficient arrangements of equally sized spheres in space are given by the so-called face-centred cubic packing and the hexagonal close packing, shown in the image on the left. This fact is familiar to greengrocers around the world, but as a mathematical statement that requires proof it turned out to be fiendishly difficult. It wasn't until nearly 400 years later, in 1998, that the mathematician Thomas Hales announced a proof which relied on a vast number of computer calculations. No human could possibly check all the calculations within a lifetime, so the validity of the proof has remained controversial to this day. (You can find out more about Kepler's conjecture and the controversy in the Plus article Welcome to the maths lab.)\n\nThe two mathematicians also discussed Harriot's work on rainbows and his investigation of refraction. Harriot thought that a light ray hitting the surface of a transparent medium was partially reflected and partially refracted because the medium contained solid parts, akin to atoms (which resist the ray), and empty spaces (which the rays penetrate). He even invited Kepler to imagine entering into an atom with him to see what wonders they would find in \"Nature's House\". To Harriot's amazement, Kepler declined.\n\nPerhaps inspired by the idea of matter being comprised by either points or empty space, Harriot developed a binary number system almost a century before the German mathematician Gottfried Leibniz, who is usually credited with being the first to describe the modern binary number system, which underlies the workings of all our computers. Harriot manipulated the numbers by addition, subtraction and multiplication. His papers even show him experimenting with ternary, quaternary, quinternary and higher number systems.\n\nReaching for the stars and venturing into abstraction\n\nBy the summer of 1609, Harriot had acquired a magnifying \"truncke\" or telescope, which could magnify objects by a factor of six. His observations of the moon are the first ever recorded astronomical observations using a telescope. As ever, he didn't publish, and Galileo gained the credit when he made his own observations six months later. Harriot used telescopes which could magnify up to a factor of 32 to draw detailed lunar maps, follow Jupiter's satellites, track comets and catalogue nearly 500 sunspot observations.\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope: Astronomy has come a long way since the time of Harriot. Image courtesy NASA.\n\nDespite the impressive list of achievements above, Harriot is actually best-known for his work in algebra and, in his will, it was only his mathematical papers that he requested be collected and published. There is much debate about how important Harriot's algebraic work was, mostly due to the disorganised structure of his papers and the badly edited collection produced after his death. But his symbolic system of algebra, which dispensed with wordy descriptions and represented unknowns with letters and operations with symbols, could be manipulated independently from what it represented, according to its own rules and axioms. If this seems familiar to anyone who's studied algebra at school, it is. Like his earlier representation of the Algonquin language, Harriot's visual symbolism made mathematics accessible in a totally new way.\n\nHarriot wasn't just responsible for developing new representations of mathematics, though. He tackled equations by carrying all the terms containing a power of the unknown to the left side of the equation, with the constant term on the right. He used algebraic zero and the concepts of greater than and less than, expressing them as symbols.He worked on cubic equations, coming up with symbolic solutions and noting that a cubic with roots , and factorises as\n\nAnd he derived negative and even complex roots of equations, at a time when others viewed these as \"impossible\".\n\nFor the last eight years of his life, Harriot was plagued by a cancerous tumour on his nostril, almost certainly caused by smoking. He died aged 61 while visiting the City of London. His grave in the Chancel of St Christopher le Stocks was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666 but a modern plaque stands on the site, now part of the Bank of England.\n\nPublish or perish?\n\nIn accordance with his will, the Artis Analyticae Praxis, a collection of Harriot's work on the theory of equations and the solution of numerical polynomial equations, was published ten years after his death. His reputation for many years relied on this edited volume which included many mistakes and discrepancies from his original papers.\n\nWhy didn't he publish any of the 7000 manuscript pages in his lifetime? No one is quite sure. Perhaps the security of his annual pension meant he had no need to establish a reputation for himself. Perhaps he considered his discoveries the property of his patrons. Perhaps he just wasn't interested. His lifelong friend, Sir William Lower, wrote in 1610 that \"too great reservedness hath rob'd you of those glories\" and urged Harriot to let his \"countrie and frinds injoye the comforts they would have in the true and greate honor you would purchase your selfe by publishing some of your choise works\", but to no avail.\n\nWhen Harriot's papers were finally unearthed in the late 18th century, among the stable accounts of Northumberland's country home, Petworth House in Sussex, they were disorganised and muddled, with few descriptions to help interpret them. Many were obviously written for Harriot's own personal entertainment, including acrostics, anagrams, hieroglyphics and puzzles. In among his major investigations were diversions to calculate the optimum size for the mast of a ship, the maximum supportable population of the world and the gaseous yield of a burning candle, as well as plans for the redesign of Syon House's drainage systems.\n\nThe German astronomer who discovered the papers, Frans Xavier Zach, was quick to promote Harriot's great work to the world, but there is still much debate about the level of his achievements. While descriptions of Harriot as an English Galileo or Kepler may be misplaced, there is no doubt that he committed his life to finding mathematical descriptions of observations of the natural world and applied himself to an amazingly broad range of practical problems. If he had published in his day, perhaps his contribution could have been greater, and his name would be much more familiar to us all.\n\nFurther reading\n\nA more extensive biography, along with details of Harriot's work on binary numbers and the story of his lost papers can be found in the MacTutor History of Mathematics archive.\n\nYou can also read Harriot's only published works, A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia and Artis Analyticae Praxis.\n\nAbout the author\n\nAnna Faherty read physics at Cambridge before working in publishing for fifteen years.

Thomas Harriot was also recognized for his contributions in navigational techniques, working closely with John White to create advanced maps for navigation.

English mathematician, astronomer, and natural scientist Thomas Harriot introduced some of the symbols used in algebra today. He published very little but left thousands of pages of manuscripts, which scholars did not closely study until the mid-20th century.\n\nHarriot was born in 1560 in Oxford, England. He lived at Sir Walter Raleigh\u2019s home in London, England\u2014Durham House\u2014which was a center for Raleigh\u2019s preparations to sponsor a colony on Roanoke Island in \u201cVirginia\u201d (now in North Carolina). Harriot was deeply involved. While living at Durham House, he worked out mathematical solutions to various navigational problems, devised navigational instruments, helped organize and raise funds for the expeditions, and kept Raleigh\u2019s accounts. He may have gone on the first expedition Raleigh sent to Roanoke Island in 1584. Harriott was certainly on the next one, from April 1585 to July 1586, which he described in 1588 in A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia\u2014Harriot\u2019s only book published in his lifetime. By 1589 Harriot was living on and surveying Raleigh\u2019s estates in Ireland.\n\nIn the 1590s the political tide in England began to turn against Raleigh. Harriot found a new patron in Henry Percy, the 9th earl of Northumberland, who gave him an estate in Durham, England, in 1595. Percy also gave Harriot the use of a house near London as a residence and scientific laboratory for his studies in astronomy, meteorology, optics, chemistry, and mathematics. Harriot applied mathematics to the bending of light and to the path of a cannonball shot from a gun (ballistics). He was the first to discover the principle of the refraction of light now called Snell\u2019s law, which the Dutch scientist Willebrord Snell discovered independently 20 years after Harriot.\n\nAfter Queen Elizabeth\u2019s death in 1603, Raleigh was arrested and charged with treason. In the course of his trial, both he and Harriot were accused of atheism, although there is nothing in Harriot\u2019s writings to substantiate the charge. In the turmoil following the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, Harriot was arrested on suspicion of having cast King James\u2019s horoscope; his patron, Percy, was also arrested. Harriot was soon released, but Percy remained in the Tower of London until 1621.\n\nWith both of his former patrons in prison, Harriot returned his attention to his studies of optics and astronomy. His reputation reached the German astronomer Johannes Kepler, who initiated an exchange of letters. Harriot observed Halley\u2019s comet and, like his Italian contemporary Galileo, used a telescope to observe sunspots and the moons of Jupiter. In 1609 and 1610 Harriot drew sketches of the Moon as viewed through a telescope.\n\nHarriot\u2019s last eight years were marred by having cancer of the nose and by Raleigh\u2019s execution, which Harriot was present to witness. Harriot died in London on July 2, 1621. His Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas Resolvendas (\u201cApplication of Analytical Art to Solving Algebraic Equations\u201d) was published posthumously in 1631. Both the editor and Harriot himself introduced some of the mathematical symbols used in algebra today. Harriot was among the first to solve mathematical equations involving negative and complex roots and imaginary numbers."}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-30400-7_583", "page_content": "Born Oxford, England, 1560\n\nDied London, England, 2 July 1621\n\nGalileo Galilei was not the first to grasp the potential of the telescope for astronomical investigations; in England, Thomas Harriot made the first telescopic sketch of the Moon. Harriot was strongly identified with Sir Walter Raleigh's free\u2010thinking \u201cSchool of Atheisme\u201d and had once served as Raleigh's onetime mathematical tutor and scientific advisor. Another associate was the poet and dramatist Christopher Marlowe (1564\u20131593). But unlike his colorful poet\u2010companions, Harriot seems to have been personally reserved and quiet, a perfectionist whose knowledge of mathematics was extensive but who published little during his lifetime.\n\nIn 1585, when he was in his early 20s, Harriot accompanied Raleigh as surveyor and cartographer on an expedition to Virginia. Although he planned an encyclopedic account of the New World, he actually produced only \u201cA brief and true report of the new\u2010found land of Virginia,\u201d which became widely known through Richard Hakluyt's Principal Navigations (1598\u20131600), a collection of the voyages made by English adventurers like Raleigh.\n\nBut these had been the adventures of a younger man. Harriot was already 50 when he first turned a telescope toward the 5\u2010day\u2010old Moon on the evening of 26 July 1609 (5 August). Though magnifying 6\u00d7, his \u201ctrunke,\u201d as he called it, must have been of very poor optical quality, since it showed very little detail. For that matter, Harriot seems to have had very little insight into the true nature of what he was seeing\u2014about as little as was shown on a slightly later occasion by his friend Sir William Lower, who used one of Harriot's telescopes to make his own observations of the Moon from Kidwelly in Wales. Lower wrote memorably to Harriot on February 6, 1610 (O.S.).\n\nAccording as you wished I have observed the moone in all his changes. In the new I discover manifestlie the earthshine, a little before the dichotomie that spot which represents unto me the man in the moone (but without a head) \u2026. A little after neare the brimme of the gibbous parts like starres, much brighter then the rest and the whole brimme along, lookes like unto the description of coasts, in the dutch bookes of voyages. In the full she appeares like a tarte that my cooke made me the last weeke.

The contrast between Galilei's decisive results and Harriot's and Lower's early attempts demonstrate Galilei's genius as an observer. Galilei was certain that the Moon was \u201csprinkled over with prominences and depressions,\u201d and was measuring the heights of lunar peaks before his contemporaries even realized that some of the features they were seeing were shadows cast by mountains."}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4419-9917-7_583", "page_content": "Born Oxford, England, 1560\n\nDied London, England, 2 July 1621\n\nGalileo Galilei was not the first to grasp the potential of the telescope for astronomical investigations; in England, Thomas Harriot made the first telescopic sketch of the Moon. Harriot was strongly identified with Sir Walter Raleigh\u2019s free-thinking \u201cSchool of Atheisme\u201d and had once served as Raleigh\u2019s onetime mathematical tutor and scientific advisor. Another associate was the poet and dramatist Christopher Marlowe (1564\u20131593). But unlike his colorful poet-companions, Harriot seems to have been personally reserved and quiet, a perfectionist whose knowledge of mathematics was extensive but who published little during his lifetime.\n\nIn 1585, when he was in his early 20s, Harriot accompanied Raleigh as surveyor and cartographer on an expedition to Virginia. Although he planned an encyclopedic account of the New World, he actually produced only \u201cA brief and true report of the new-found land of Virginia,\u201d which became widely known through Richard Hakluyt\u2019s Principal Navigations (1598\u20131600), a collection of the voyages made by English adventurers like Raleigh.\n\nBut these had been the adventures of a younger man. Harriot was already 50 when he first turned a telescope toward the 5-day-old Moon on the evening of 26 July 1609 (5 August). Though magnifying 6\u00d7, his \u201ctrunke,\u201d as he called it, must have been of very poor optical quality, since it showed very little detail. For that matter, Harriot seems to have had very little insight into the true nature of what he was seeing-about as little as was shown on a slightly later occasion by his friend Sir William Lower , who used one of Harriot\u2019s telescopes to make his own observations of the Moon from Kidwelly in Wales. Lower wrote memorably to Harriot on February 6, 1610 (O.S.).\n\nAccording as you wished I have observed the moone in all his changes. In the new I discover manifestlie the earthshine, a little before the dichotomie that spot which represents unto me the man in the moone (but without a head) \u2026. A little after neare the brimme of the gibbous parts like starres, much brighter then the rest and the whole brimme along, lookes like unto the description of coasts, in the dutch bookes of voyages. In the full she appeares like a tarte that my cooke made me the last weeke.

He left behind some 8000 pages of scientific research, but it\u2019s only in recent decades that scholars have uncovered their treasures.\n\nAnd what they show is that Harriot independently made many significant discoveries now attributed to other, more famous scientists. Some scholars have called him \u201cthe English Galileo\u201d and \u201cthe greatest British mathematical scientist before Newton\u201d.\n\nYet Harriot died without publishing a single word of this extraordinary output. His tale reminds us that, while we may sometimes think science progresses through a series of renowned pioneers who single-handedly overturn entrenched beliefs, the story is rarely so simple.\n\nWhat did Harriot discover?\n\nFor instance, we learn in school that Galileo Galilei initiated telescopic astronomy and discovered the law of falling motion. But Harriot independently did both of these things.\n\nThomas Harriot\u2019s 1609 map of the Moon, drawn by observing through a telescope. Image: Wikimedia\n\nHe also deduced fledgling general laws governing the motion of everyday objects, again independently of Galileo, and before Ren\u00e9 Descartes. (Half a century later, Isaac Newton developed the definitive laws of motion.)\n\nHarriot studied light, too, discovering the secret of colour and the nature of the rainbow before Newton, and finding the law of refraction (which we know today as Snell\u2019s law) before the Dutch astronomer Willebrord Snell.\n\nHe also made a mathematical study of population growth before Thomas Malthus, developed a completely symbolic form of sophisticated algebra before Descartes, discovered binary arithmetic before Gottfried Leibniz, and took steps on the road to calculus with his work on infinite series.\n\nThe law of falling bodies\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 2008 that Harriot\u2019s work on gravity was fully reconstructed, by the German scholar Matthias Schemmel.\n\nAs Schemmel pointed out, Harriot and his contemporary Galileo were heirs to essentially the same body of knowledge. It\u2019s perhaps not so surprising, then, that they made some of the same breakthroughs. There are plenty of examples of independent co-discoveries in history, most famously that of calculus by Newton and Leibniz.\n\nThe law of falling motion says that without air resistance, all objects, no matter their size or mass, fall from the same height at the same rate.\n\nLegend has it Galileo dropped balls from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to study how they fell. Nobody knows if this is true, but Harriot had the same idea \u2013 he recorded the time, in pulse beats, that it took for different objects falling from as high as 55\u00bd feet (about 17 metres) to reach the ground.\n\nRead more: Copernicus' revolution and Galileo's vision: Our changing view of the universe in pictures\n\nBoth Harriot and Galileo devised more accurate experiments, however, from which they derived a mathematical understanding of how things fall.\n\nThis combination of experiment and mathematics is now the accepted way to derive a law of nature. Quantifying observations means others can test the results, and use them to make useful predictions.\n\nHarriot and Galileo weren\u2019t the first to understand the role of observation and mathematics in this context, of course. But they were among the most successful of the pre-Newtonian pioneers.\n\nGalileo didn\u2019t publish his work on gravity until after Harriot had died, and there\u2019s no evidence that the two men ever met or corresponded.\n\nThe law of refraction and the shape of the rainbow\n\nThe German astronomer Johannes Kepler, however, did correspond briefly with Harriot. Kepler had been working on the nature of light and vision when word reached him that Harriot had unravelled two mysteries \u2013 the law of refraction, and why the rainbow has its magical colours and unique shape.\n\nThe law of refraction describes how light bends when it passes from one medium into another, which explains how an image can be focused by a glass lens, or why your leg looks wobbly when you dip it in a swimming pool.\n\nA diagram from Ibn Sahl\u2019s 10th-century treatise on optics showing the path of light refracted by a lens. Image: Wikimedia\n\nHarriot derived this law 20 years before Snell, but there\u2019s a popular belief that the 10th-century Baghdad-based scholar Ab\u016b Sa\u02bfd al-\u02bfAl\u0101\u02be ibn Sahl beat even Harriot. This is not quite right \u2013 Ibn Sahl is a notable pioneer whose geometrical diagram of light focused by a lens gives, in hindsight, the correct refractive path. But there\u2019s no evidence he deduced his result from experiment, or that he understood the general properties of refraction.\n\nJudging from his surviving papers, even Snell failed to generalise his result, which he, like Ibn Sahl, never wrote as the neat trigonometric equation we use today. Harriot, by contrast, did. His derivation of the general law of refraction is another example of his rigorous blend of experiment and mathematics.\n\nRead more: Curious Kids: Why are rainbows round?\n\nHarriot\u2019s other adventures\n\nIf only Harriot had published! In the early stage of his career, though, he was bound by commercial secrecy, for his first patron was controversial statesman and entrepreneur Sir Walter Raleigh. Harriot was also busy dodging heretic hunters, and sailing the high seas as Raleigh\u2019s navigational advisor.\n\nThomas Harriot published only one work in his lifetime \u2013 a report on his stay in North America in the 1580s. Image: Wikimedia\n\nRaleigh had delusions of empire and glory, and wanted to establish a trading colony in today\u2019s US before the Spanish beat him to it. The one work Harriot did publish in his lifetime was \u201ca brief and true report\u201d on the economic potential of Raleigh\u2019s chosen American site.\n\nHarriot\u2019s contribution to colonialism has justly attracted its share of criticism. Nonetheless, his report is still widely praised for its sympathetic depiction of the way of life of the North Carolina Algonquian people, as it was when Europeans first set foot on their land. Harriot learned the local language, and enjoyed much about the year he spent living with the Algonquians.\n\nWhat he loved doing most, though, was mathematics and physics. He was neither flamboyant nor ambitious, and when he was wrongfully imprisoned through an unlucky connection with the Gunpowder Plot (a failed attempt to assassinate King James I), he told his jailers he just wanted ...\n\n\u201c... to live a private life for the love of learning that I might study freely\u201d.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the late 1590s, Harriot had found a second patron, Henry Percy, the ninth earl of Northumberland. It was then that he was able to study the mysteries of nature and the marvels of mathematics for their own sakes, rather than the \u201capplied\u201d work he had done for Raleigh.\n\nHaving two generous patrons meant Harriot didn\u2019t need to publicise his discoveries to attract funding, the way Galileo did. Nor did he care about fame, despite being urged by friends to claim his priority. His manuscripts do contain several almost-finished treatises, but it seems he was so busy doing science that he never managed to put his results together for the printer.\n\nAfter his death, well-meaning scholars carved up his manuscripts in an attempt to study and publish them. In the process, however, all the papers disappeared, seemingly lost forever. Then, 150 years later, the Hungarian astronomer Franz Xaver Zach discovered them, locked safely away in Northumberland\u2019s castle.\n\nMost of the papers were then given to the British Museum. They\u2019re now in the British Library, where I had the privilege of studying them. (They\u2019re also available online.)\n\nAs for Harriot, no one knows much about him as a person \u2013 not even his birthday. Nevertheless, he\u2019s fascinated scholars for the past half-century (as I discovered some years ago when I set out to bring his story to a wider, non-specialist readership).\n\nThat\u2019s because despite the lack of biographical data, those precious manuscripts show that what mattered most to Harriot himself was mathematics and science. Four hundred years on, his mix of genius and dedication is something to honour.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Conversation."}]}
