But, Caquatto plans to do this all from Florida while simultaneously competing for the Gators and taking a full load of classes at UF.\n\nFlorida Head Coach Rhonda Faehn is a former US National team member. She understands the Karolyi system, and knows that this will be a difficult challenge for Caquatto. Faehn told gatorzone.com, \u201cI really think she can stay disciplined and focused and give it a shot.\u2019\u2019\n\nCaquatto competed at the 2008 Olympic Trials where she was a long shot for the team, but she's much more of a contender after a solid showing at the 2010 World Championships in Rotterdam where she competed all around in the qualification round and bars and vault in the team final. She hit every single routine. Plus, her experience in collegiate gymnastics has definitely benefitted her beam and overall confidence in competition.\n\n\u201cI feel at this stage that I\u2019m at a good point in my training and competing,\u2019\u2019 Caquatto said. \u201cWhen it comes to the Olympics, anything can happen. People get injured, stuff like that happens and so that\u2019s why you have to take it one step at a time.

They have been coming back, but we just have to take it slowly so we don\u2019t injure my ankle.\u2019\u2019\n\nCaquatto and the rest of the US National team will head to the Karolyi Ranch next week for the first of two World Selection Camps."}, {"url": "https://www.ocregister.com/2021/04/07/third-legacy-elite-coach-under-investigation-by-u-s-center-for-safesport/", "page_content": "A third coach at Legacy Elite Gymnastics, a high profile Chicago-area club owned and operated by former U.S. national and China Olympic team coaches, is under investigation for physical and emotional abuse by the U.S. Center for SafeSport, according to SafeSport documents obtained by the Southern California News Group.\n\nRebecca Thone, the Legacy coach, allegedly abused young gymnasts after Anna Li, an alternate on the 2012 U.S. Olympic team and UCLA All-American, and her mother Jiani Wu, an Olympic medalist for China and former USA Gymnastic national team coach, were already under investigation by the U.S. Center for SafeSport, according to documents and interviews.\n\nThe revelation of the Thone investigation comes as Legacy has begun promoting \u201cBelieve College Camp\u201d featuring some of the nation\u2019s top college coaches at the club in early July. A flier for the event under Legacy\u2019s logo, the Olympic rings and the slogan \u201cWhere Success & Fun Is One!\u201d said the camp is \u201cFeaturing College Clinicians from\u201d UCLA, Cal, Florida, Washington, Michigan State, Utah State, Towson State and Northern Illinois.\n\nFor a $600 fee, gymnasts will train for two days with the coaches and participate in a question and answer session with the college coaches, according to the flier.\n\nThe U.S. Center for SafeSport in August 2019 took jurisdiction over an investigation into multiple allegations that Wu routinely physically abused young gymnasts, and that she and Li, a former member of the influential USA Gymnastics athletes council, verbally and emotionally abused minor-age athletes, according to SafeSport documents and interviews.\n\nLi and Wu have allegedly continued to abuse gymnasts since the center took jurisdiction over the case in 2019, according to interviews and confidential complaints filed with SafeSport.\n\nLi and Wu have denied any wrongdoing. Russell Prince, an attorney for the family, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nUCLA head coach Chris Waller did not respond to a request for comment, neither did the head coaches at Cal, Florida, Washington, Michigan State, Utah State, Towson State and Northern Illinois.\n\nLegacy, located in Aurora, Illinois, is owned by Wu and her husband Yuejin Li. Wu earned a bronze medal with China in the team competition at the 1984 Olympics. She later served as a U.S. national team assistant coach at the World Championships. Yuejin Li in 1981 became China\u2019s first world champion on the floor exercise and was a member of China\u2019s silver medal men\u2019s team at the 1984 Olympics. He was China\u2019s national team coordinator when China swept the men\u2019s and women\u2019s team gold medals at the 2008 Games in Beijing.\n\nAnna Li primarily coached female gymnasts at the elite level, the sport\u2019s top level. Another daughter, Andi Li, is a freshman gymnast at Cal.\n\nAt least 30 complaints have been filed with the U.S. Center for SafeSport since July 2019 in which gymnasts and their parents allege that Li disparaged gymnasts in front of their peers on a \u201cdaily basis,\u201d regularly called girls fat, pressured injured athletes to train or compete, and threatened to make negative comments to college coaches recruiting them if they struggled in training, were unable to train or compete because of injuries or illness, or appeared in Li\u2019s opinion overweight, according to interviews with multiple gymnasts and parents and U.S. Center for SafeSport and USA Gymnastics documents.\n\nWu on multiple occasions pulled young gymnasts by their hair when she was dissatisfied with their training, including at least one occasion when Wu allegedly pulled a girl by her ponytail all the way to the ground, according to interviews and multiple complaints submitted to U.S. Center for SafeSport and USA Gymnastics.\n\n\u201cHair was pulled and girls were constantly body-shamed,\u201d a parent wrote in a formal complaint to SafeSport and USA Gymnastics.\n\nAnother parent in a complaint with SafeSport and USA Gymnastics said she witnessed \u201cHair pulling under the guise of physical coaching.\u201d\n\nAnother complaint alleges a \u201cchild had tape placed over (her) mouth for 2 hours\u201d by the coaches.\n\nDespite the severity of the allegations, the U.S. Center for SafeSport rejected a request from parents that Li and Wu be placed on interim suspension, a measure with which SafeSport can suspend individuals as a protective measure pending the outcome of the investigation, according to documents. Individuals placed on interim suspension can then request a hearing within 72 hours.\n\nSCNG reported in August 2019 that top USA Gymnastics officials have been aware of physical, verbal and emotional abuse allegations against Li and Wu since at least 2017, nearly two years earlier than the national governing body has acknowledged.\n\nMark Busby, then USA Gymnastics general counsel, and Toby R. Stark, then the organization\u2019s director for Safe Sport confirmed in a series of September 2017 emails that USA Gymnastics had received allegations of \u201cverbal, physical and emotional abuse\u201d against Li and Wu.\n\nThe Busby and Stark emails contradicted statements by USA Gymnastics chief executive officer Li Li Leung in August 2019, denying that the organization was aware of complaints against Li and Wu prior to Li being named to USA Gymnastics\u2019 high profile athletes council in June 2019."}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/wu-jiani", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nWu Jiani was born on 23 April, 1966 in Shanghai, China, is a Chinese artistic gymnast.

(Stacey Wescott / Chicago Tribune)\n\nTwo coaches at an elite Aurora gymnastics gym, both former Olympians, are facing allegations of emotional, verbal and physical abuse by several athletes they once coached.\n\nAnna Li, an alternate on the 2012 U.S. Olympic team, and her mother, Jiani Wu, a former Chinese Olympic gymnast, are coaches at Legacy Elite Gymnastics, one of the top gyms in the area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn attorney for Li, in response to questions about the allegations at the Aurora gym, revealed publicly for the first time Thursday that Li is a survivor of disgraced USA Gymnastics national team doctor Larry Nassar, convicted of sexually abusing many young women.\n\n\u201cFor the last few years, I have seen one after another of my sister gymnasts come forward and bravely speak out about their abuse by Larry Nassar,\" Li said in a statement released through the attorney. \u201cI had been afraid to speak out, afraid of the repercussions on my family, my career, and to my own emotional well-being \u2013 admitting to myself that I was taken advantage of by a trusted adult.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLi, through an attorney, filed a confidential claim in the spring in USA Gymnastics\u2019 pending bankruptcy. The agency filed for bankruptcy in 2018, facing dozens of lawsuits over Nassar.\n\nWu and her husband own Legacy Elite Gymnastics, with locations in suburban Aurora and Carol Stream.\n\nThe allegations at Legacy Elite against Li and Wu include verbal, emotional and physical abuse by current and former gymnasts, according to interviews and four complaints filed with USA Gymnastics and obtained by this newspaper. None of the documents allege sexual abuse.\n\nThe Orange County Register reported this month that at least 10 complaints have been filed against Li and Wu.\n\nThe U.S. Center for SafeSport accepted jurisdiction over the matter because of a possible conflict of interest with USA Gymnastics. Dan Hill, a spokesman for SafeSport, said he could not comment on specific complaints or any investigation to protect those involved.\n\nLi has stepped aside, temporarily, from USA Gymnastics Athletes Council pending the outcome of any investigation, said Sam Amirante, an attorney for the coaches and the gym. The council is charged with advocating for athletes and providing feedback to the board of directors. Li was elected to the council in June.\n\nAmirante denied the allegations, calling them \u201cfalse complaints.\u201d\n\nWu won a bronze medal in the 1984 Olympics as part of China\u2019s gymnastics team. She was an assistant coach on the 2010 and 2011 U.S. women\u2019s teams in the world championships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLi was an alternate on the 2012 U.S. Olympic team. She had been an elite gymnast since childhood and earned a scholarship to UCLA, where she led the team to the 2010 collegiate national championship. She then worked as a stuntwoman for a TV drama and in car commercials, before making the 2012 Olympic team.\n\nLi joins hundreds of athletes who have accused Nassar of abuse, some dating back decades. Nassar was sentenced to a lengthy prison term likely to last the rest of his life.\n\n\u201cI have struggled to come to terms with a career in gymnastics, protecting the livelihood of my family, and what I have been through,\u201d Li said in her statement. \u201cLarry Nassar was reputed within the gymnastics community to be \u2018the best.\u2019 At the time, I saw him as a trusted figure so I pushed down any doubts. I went to him. He treated me. And I am a survivor.\n\n\u201cI came forward to make my claim against Nassar in the Spring of this year, confidentially. I was not ready for attention on this issue as I am still processing. But I can see now that my silence cannot continue, whether I am ready or not.\u201d\n\nFollowing Nassar\u2019s conviction, USA Gymnastics was thrown into turmoil and underwent a leadership overhaul. Against that backdrop, the allegations against Li and Wu surfaced.\n\nCopies of complaints filed with USA Gymnastics, obtained by this newspaper, allege the coaches humiliated athletes, told them to work through complaints of pain and told the girls they were \u201cjiggly\u201d or that colleges wouldn\u2019t look at them if they were too big.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn one complaint, a parent alleged Wu, unhappy with the way a gymnast performed a skill, pulled the girl by her arm off the beam, push her into the splits and, when it looked like the girl could no longer hold the move, push her back down and sat on her back.\n\n\u201cI never brought my daughter there to be abused,\" said Chicago resident Carmen Scanlon, who filed the complaint.\n\nSamantha Medel, who used to come to the Carol Stream gym from Kenosha, Wisconsin, recalled two injuries \u2014 once to her shoulders, and once a grade two, or moderate, concussion \u2014 when she said coaches failed to push mats under her while she was performing skills. She believes the shoulder injury led to two surgeries. When she received the concussion, she was told to keep practicing.\n\nShe said she was told college coaches weren\u2019t looking at her because she weighed too much, and she was sometimes encouraged to skip meals, with Li telling her it would make her feel lighter when she practiced. When she had a difficult practice following the death of her grandmother, the coaches screamed at her, she said.\n\nMedel, now 17, left the gym in spring 2018 and is no longer in gymnastics. She and her mother have filed two complaints, one alleging abuse and a second one alleging improper social media conduct by Li toward Medel after initial reports about about the allegations came out.\n\n\u201cGymnastics, she loves this sport,\" Medel\u2019s mother, Linda, said. \u201cThis was her life. This was everything. It wasn\u2019t just something to do, this was her be all end all, and to ... not even be able to walk into a gym because \u2014 you battle because you love it and imagine doing something that you love so much and then you cant even fathom walking in because it just hurts too much.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSamantha Medel said it took time for her to be ready to come forward with her story. Linda Medel said Li\u2019s selection for the athlete\u2019s council spurred her decision to talk.\n\nKlaudia Ryczek, now 17 and a senior in high school, trained at Legacy Elite during her freshman and part of her sophomore year of high school. She recalled yelling, body shaming and name calling.\n\n\u201cI wish that I wouldn\u2019t have gone to Legacy because now I see how that gym affected me, to not even want to go to another gym after because I was scared I would have to go through that same experience again,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the statement, Li said, \"the accusations that have been lobbied against myself and my mother are heartbreaking and hurtful to hear. But more than anything these accusations are absolutely false and untrue. I was blessed not only to be raised by such amazing parents, but to be coached by them too. I have seen first-hand the kind of coaches they are. They helped me achieve my dream to make it to the Olympics, and I see the same determination and compassion in them with every athlete they train. I have gained so much through the sport of gymnastics that I do my best to hold onto my love for the sport and help foster that feeling within the girls I coach. \u201c\n\nAmirante said Li and Wu are \u201cwonderful people.\u201d He characterized the people filing complaints as \u201cbasically disgruntled parents, maybe disgruntled gymnasts, who didn\u2019t get exactly what they wanted out of gymnastics in their life and, you know, they\u2019re blaming the coaches.\u201d\n\nHe highlighted the timing of the complaints, emerging shortly after Li made her confidential claim in the Nassar case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a witch hunt,\u201d he said. \"I vehemently, vehemently, vigorously deny any of those complaints.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, USA Gymnastics said it was aware of the reports of emotional misconduct against Li and Wu.\n\n\u201cUSA Gymnastics is striving to become an athlete-centric organization that keeps athlete safety and well-being at the forefront of all that we do,\u201d USA Gymnastics said in a statement. \u201cWe have already made numerous changes designed to prevent the opportunity for abuse to occur.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed."}, {"url": "https://thegymter.net/2015/07/15/nia-dennis-moves-to-legacy-elite/", "page_content": "Nia Dennis, the 2014 silver all-around medalist at U.S. Championships, has left Buckeye Gymnastics to train at Legacy Elite, a move now confirmed by the changes made to USA Gymnastics\u2019 women\u2019s national team list.\n\nOn Saturday, rumors began to surface when Dennis posted online about leaving home, stating she was going to miss all of her friends back in Ohio. A source at Buckeye confirmed exclusively to The Gymternet on Monday that Dennis had in fact packed her bags and headed to Chicago to train with Jiani Wu and Yuejiu Li, coaches (and parents) of the 2012 Olympic alternate Anna Li (who now coaches alongside mom and dad) as well as sisters Bridgey and Mackenzie Caquatto, both of whom racked up international medals in the last quad before competing at the University of Florida (Bridgey was the 2011 Pan Am all-around champion while Mackenzie played an integral role in Team USA\u2019s World silver medal in 2010).\n\nWu and Li were both gymnasts themselves, competing as members of the Chinese Olympic team in 1984, where Wu won team bronze and Li won team silver. Li was also a Chinese national coach in 2007 and the team coordinator in 2008, helping both the men and women to team gold at home in Beijing while Wu served as the U.S. women\u2019s assistant coach at World Championships in 2010 and 2011. They currently coach junior elite Gabby Perea, a 13-year-old standout on beam.\n\nLegacy Elite is known for producing strong gymnasts on bars, where both their daughter and the Caquatto sisters stood out as elites. Dennis showed a real talent for bars as a junior, so it\u2019s possible their strength at coaching this event stood out to her as she sought to change gyms, though the reasoning is also likely pragmatic \u2013 the Dennis family has a friend in Chicago who is able to provide a place to stay for the budding Olympic hopeful.\n\nWhy did Dennis leave? It seems she was just looking for a change in coaching. Though she\u2019s trained with Kittia Carpenter at Buckeye for her entire elite career, Dennis was reportedly frustrated with some of her results over the past couple of years. Though she was named to the eight-member Pan American team training squad at the ranch in early June, she was not selected for the five-member team currently competing in Toronto, which was apparently the \u201cfinal straw\u201d in her decision to leave.\n\nWhile fiercely talented, Dennis has shown a tendency to let her nerves get to her, falling three times at last year\u2019s national championships where she was expected to take the junior title by a wide margin. Instead, she lost gold by four tenths. This level of inconsistency in pressure situations could be why she was left off the Pan Ams team, causing her to seek out coaching that could possibly help with these issues as she hopes to continue her quest for a spot on next year\u2019s Olympic team.\n\nNo, as some have speculated, it has nothing to do with Gabby Douglas coming to Buckeye to train, a move she made last summer after leaving Chow\u2019s for a second time. The two are \u201cbest friends\u201d who did everything together, according to one of their teammates, and both have expressed missing one another after Dennis\u2019 departure.\n\nIt\u2019s possible Dennis was actually inspired by her now former Buckeye teammate, who went through a similar last-minute move from Excalibur to Chow\u2019s after the elite season in 2010 because she felt frustrated with her coaching in Virginia. Though she got off to a bumpy start at her first meets with Chow in 2011, Douglas helped her team to gold at World Championships later that year and debuted dozens of upgrades at the American Cup just months later, earning the highest all-around score despite being an exhibition gymnast and not an official competitor. And we all know where she went after that \u2013 do historic Olympic team and all-around gold medals ring a bell?\n\nIt\u2019s definitely a bizarre choice for a gymnast to leave her gym right at the start of the big elite season, just two weeks before the Secret U.S. Classic is set to begin in Hoffman Estates, right outside of Dennis\u2019 new home base. Like Douglas in 2010, most gymnasts who have moved gyms in recent memory have waited until the hiatus after World Championships, though it\u2019s clear that in this situation, when the new opportunity presented itself, it was something she couldn\u2019t pass up.\n\nThough Classics will be too soon to detect any real changes in Dennis\u2019 competitive ability, we are excited to see her in action for the first time since last summer\u2019s domestic season and we wish her the best of luck with her new coaches and gym.\n\nArticle by Lauren Hopkins\n\nAdvertisement"}, {"url": "https://infofamouspeople.com/famous/mackenzie-caquatto.htm", "page_content": "Mackenzie Caquatto's About \u270e]\n\nMackenzie Caquatto was born on March 12, 1992 (age 31) in Illinois, United States.

She started gymnastic training in 1973, and was admitted into Shanghai gymnastic team in 1976, and Chinese national team in 1977.[citation needed]\n\nChinese artistic gymnast\n\nQuick facts: Wu Jiani, Country represented, Born, Height, ... \u25bc\n\nWu competed at 1984 Olympic Games, and won a bronze medal in Women's Team competition. She qualified to the all-around, uneven bars and balance beam finals, but had to withdraw from all of them due to dislocating her elbow after the team competition. She was a five-time Chinese National Champion and a World Championship bronze medalist on beam in 1981.[citation needed]\n\nWu Jiani Salto is a skill of uneven bars with C value. This skill was banned due to the development of the apparatus.[citation needed]\n\nHer husband is Li Yuejiu, also a famed gymnast and an Olympic medalist. One of their daughters is Anna Li, who competed for the UCLA Bruins gymnastics team during the 2007 through 2010 seasons and at the same Pauley Pavilion where her parents won the Olympic medals.[2] Following the Visa Championships and two selection camps at the Karolyi Ranch in New Waverly, Texas, Anna Li was named to the gold medal winning U.S. 2011 World Championship Team. An injury kept her from competing. In 2012, she was named an alternate to the 2012 Olympic Games.[citation needed]\n\nAndrea Li, the youngest daughter who is also a gymnast for junior competitions such as Nastia Liukin Cup and Junior Olympic Championships.[citation needed]\n\nAlong with their daughter, Wu and Li have been the coaches for several elite athletes, including the Caquatto sisters: World Silver Medalist Mackenzie Caquatto and Pan American Games triple Gold Medalist Bridgette Caquatto. In April 2009, they opened Legacy Elite Gymnastics in Aurora, Illinois together to train local gymnasts.[3]"}]}
