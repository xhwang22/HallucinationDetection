Picture courtesy Cinema Guild. All rights reserved.\n\nAndre Gregory: Before and After Dinner (2013)\n\nOpened: 04/03/2013 Limited\n\nTrailer: Click for trailer\n\nWebsites: Home\n\nGenre: Biographical Documentary\n\nRated: Unrated\n\nSynopsis\n\nANDRE GREGORY: BEFORE AND AFTER DINNER is a wonderful exploration of the life and work of groundbreaking director, actor and artist Andre Gregory.\n\nA witty and often hilariously funny raconteur, Gregory looks back on a career that spanned decades, shattered boundaries and established him as a cultural icon. He recalls the making of MY DINNER WITH ANDRE, the Louis Malle-directed classic in which he starred and co-wrote, reflects on his pivotal role in American theatre, dishes on his brief sojourn in Hollywood, and talks about the discovery that led him to question his own identity and life's work. Bringing us back and forth in time, Gregory looks not only at his life, but at the nature of art, love and the creative process.\n\nDirected by award-winning filmmaker Cindy Kleine (who is also his wife), ANDRE GREGORY: BEFORE AND AFTER DINNER is a brilliant portrait of a modern renaissance man.\n\nDirector's Statement\n\nMy husband Andre and I talked about making a memoir film for several years and I wrestled with how I would capture his larger than life story. I continued to ask myself, where will I begin? Until May 18, 2009, opening day of Wally Shawn's Grasses of a Thousand Colors, directed by Andre, at the Royal Court Theatre in London.\n\nThat afternoon his brother called with the inflammatory information that their father and uncle may have been economic spies for Hitler. In combination with memories he shared with me about his father, it became the catalyst for beginning the journey of this film. It was the narrative key to the story of a very mysterious life, in the context of history and family evolution. It provided a new and startling perspective to re-imagine, or re-envision Andre's life and work.\n\nStrangers approach Andre often to thank him for the effect My Dinner With Andre had on them. They approach him not in the way one approaches a glittery celebrity, but with gracious awe, the way one approaches a great rabbi or teacher. The film, far from being his only great work, brought some of his deep insights, wisdom, adventures and stories to the world.\n\nWhat many people do not know is that Andre Gregory is a master of the American theatre. His work has made an indelible mark on the history of the theatre arts. He has made a lifelong commitment to what he believes is the role of theatre in society: to be an active culture, one which awakens the audience and makes them question themselves, their society and the world in which they live. This active culture requires a small audience. Like chamber music, it cannot be appreciated the same way in a large concert hall. What happens in these small spaces, because of their intimacy, is that audience members become active participants in the ritual being performed.\n\nBeing married to Andre, I have the great opportunity to witness at close hand the making of this work; the extraordinary process of its coming to life. I watch this eccentric and devoted artist live in a deep and engaged way. I watch him age with grace and curiosity, cultivating new forms of creative expression, taking on new projects and meeting each challenge like a young student hungry for knowledge. He is a man who is not afraid to step into his own light, and is, therefore, a rare and precious bird.\n\nBiographies\n\nCindy Kleine (Director)\n\nCindy Kleine is a film and video artist whose prolific career began when she was an undergraduate at The Museum School and at the legendary (and long-gone) MIT Film/Video Section, studying with Richard Leacock and among a legion of future filmmakers in the program, including Ross McElwee, Robb Moss and John Gianvito.

The Public Theatre will present The Designated Mourner and Grasses of a Thousand Colors in 2013.\n\nAndre Gregory has been one of the most important forces in the American theatre for nearly forty years. He was one of the original creators of the regional theatre movement in this country as well as the off-Broadway movement in New York. His production of Alice in Wonderland, now legendary, played in New York for seven years, as well as touring the U.S., Europe, and the Mideast, and was made into a book in collaboration with Richard Avedon. His relationship with Wallace Shawn, which has been ongoing for over thirty years, began with his production of Shawn's Our Late Night, which was presented at Joseph Papp's Public Theatre.\n\nShawn and Gregory went on to create My Dinner With Andre, directed by Louis Malle, which has now become an American classic. The partnership of Shawn, Malle and Gregory went on to create the film Vanya on 42nd Street, which like My Dinner With Andre, was hugely successful and has been shown all over the world. In 2000, Gregory directed Wallace Shawn's play, The Designated Mourner, to universally successful reviews.\n\nAs an actor, Gregory has performed in a dozen Hollywood films, including films directed by Martin Scorsese (Last Temptation of Christ), Peter Weir (The Mosquito Coast), and Woody Allen (Celebrity).\n\nGregory's most recent production of Endgame, (over the years he's done three), was performed in a Donald Judd bunker in the middle of the Marfa Texas desert in 2005.

Bliss, Mary Quinn Sullivan, and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller\u2014the museum would be dedicated exclusively to the most progressive tendencies in modern art. The museum\u2019s holdings of Cubist, Surrealist, and Abstract Expressionist paintings are especially extensive: it is home to Pablo Picasso\u2019s pivotal Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon (1907).

This insured that this landmark body of work was preserved in its entirety in a single public collection. The series has been exhibited as a whole only once before.\n\n\n\nSherman began making these pictures in 1977, when she was twenty-three. The first six were an experiment: fan-magazine glimpses into the life (or roles) of an imaginary blonde actress, played by Sherman herself. The photographs look like movie stills\u0097or perhaps like publicity pix\u0097purporting to catch the blond bombshell in unguarded moments at home. The protagonist is shown preening in the kitchen ( #3 ) and lounging in the bedroom ( #6 ). On to something, Sherman tried other characters in other roles: the chic starlet at her seaside hideaway ( #7 ), the luscious librarian ( #13 , at left), the domesticated sex kitten ( #14 ), the hot-blooded woman of the people ( #35 ), the ice-cold sophisticate ( #50 ), and others. She eventually completed the series in 1980. She stopped, she has explained, when she ran out of clich\u00e9s.\n\n\n\nOther artists had drawn upon popular culture, but Sherman's strategy was new. For her the pop-culture image was not a subject (as it had been for Walker Evans) or raw material (as it had been for Andy Warhol) but a whole artistic vocabulary, ready-made. Her film stills look and function just like the real ones\u0097those 8-by-10-inch glossies designed to lure us into a drama we find all the more compelling because we know it is not real.\n\n\n\nIn the Untitled Film Stills there are no Cleopatras, no ladies on trains, no women of a certain age. There are, of course, no men. The sixty-nine solitary heroines map a particular constellation of fictional femininity that took hold in postwar America\u0097the period of Sherman's youth, and the ground-zero of our contemporary mythology. In finding a form for her own sensibility, Sherman touched a sensitive nerve in the culture at large.\n\n\n\nAlthough most of the characters are invented, we sense right away that we already know them. That twinge of instant recognition is what makes the series tick, and it arises from Cindy Sherman's uncanny poise. There is no wink at the viewer, no open irony, no camp. As Warhol said, \"She's good enough to be a real actress.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis exhibition is sponsored by Madonna.\n\n\n\nCindy Sherman: The Complete Untitled Film Stills was organized by Peter Galassi, Chief Curator, Department of Photography.

Due to open in 2015, the project will substantially enlarge the Whitney\u2019s exhibition and programming space, enabling the first comprehensive view of the Museum\u2019s growing collection, which today comprises more than 19,000 works of modern and contemporary American art.\n\nFounded in 1930, the Whitney moved to its current Madison Avenue home, designed by Marcel Breuer, in 1966. At the time, its collection numbered some 2,000 pieces of 20th-century American art, so its nearly 100-fold expansion needs space to flourish. The new museum is to be situated in New York\u2019s vibrant Meatpacking District.

Accessed from the \u2018largo\u2019, the main entrance lobby also serves as a public gallery \u2013 of free-entry exhibition space.\n\nLevel three houses a 170-retractible seat theatre with double-height views over the Hudson River, along with technical spaces and offices.\n\nSome 50,000 sq. ft (4 650 sq. m) of gallery space is distributed over levels five, six, seven and eight, the fifth level boasting a 18,000 sq ft (1670 sq. m), column-free gallery \u2013 making it the largest open-plan museum gallery in New York City. This gallery is reserved for temporary exhibitions and its expansive volume will enable the display of really large works of contemporary art. The permanent collection is exhibited on two floors, level six and seven. These two floors also step back towards the west to create 13,000 sq ft (1 200 sq. m) of outdoor sculpture terraces.\n\nMuseum offices, education centre, conservation laboratories and library reading room are situated north of the building\u2019s core on levels three to seven, including a multi-use theatre for film, video and performance on level five.\n\nFinally, on the top floor is the \u2018studio\u2019 gallery and a caf\u00e9, naturally lit by a skylight system in saw-tooth configuration."}, {"url": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/whitney-museum-expands-online-collection", "page_content": "On October 20, the Whitney Museum of American Art closed its doors to the public after 43 years in a Marcel Breuer\u2013designed Brutalist building on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side.

Visitors to the project page can register their names and explain why they would be interested in becoming a donor. Fifty of them will be chosen by the artists on the basis of the originality of their submission.\n\nThe acquisition of an artwork for a museum collection typically ends the work's market life, permanently associating the donor with the gift. With Public Key / Private Key, the artists extend that market life: each donor receives a digital certificate, which they are free to transfer, gift, or sell at will. The digital certificates are based on a blockchain, a technology also used in cryptocurrencies to ensure the uniqueness of a transaction. The blockchain becomes a method of recording the work's provenance as the list of fifty donors evolves through the transfer of the digital certificates over time. The changing list of donors will be tracked for six months on whitney.org.

She began purchasing and showing their artwork, eventually becoming the leading patron of American art from 1907 until her death in 1942.\n\n\n\nIn 1914, Mrs. Whitney established the Whitney Studio in Greenwich Village, where she presented exhibitions by living American artists whose work had been disregarded by the traditional academies. She had assembled a collection of more than five hundred pieces by 1929. After her offer of this gift to the Metropolitan Museum of Art was declined, she set up her own institution, one with a distinctive mandate: to focus exclusively on the art and artists of this country. The Whitney Museum of American Art was founded in 1930, and opened in 1931 on West Eighth Street near Fifth Avenue.\n\n\n\nFollowing a move in 1954 to an expanded site on West 54th Street, the Whitney opened the Marcel Breuer-designed building on Madison Avenue at 75th Street in 1963. The iconic building housed the Museum from 1966 through October 20, 2014. The Whitney\u2019s current building at 99 Gansevoort Street opened on May 1, 2015.\n\nInnovation has been a hallmark of the Whitney since its beginnings. It was the first museum dedicated to the work of living American artists and the first New York museum to present a major exhibition of a video artist (Nam June Paik, in 1982). Such important figures as Jasper Johns, Jay DeFeo, Glenn Ligon, Cindy Sherman, and Paul Thek were given their first comprehensive museum surveys at the Whitney. The Museum has consistently purchased works within the year they were created, often well before the artists who created them became broadly recognized.\n\nThe Whitney was also an innovator in taking its exhibitions and programming beyond its own walls, opening branch museums in other parts of New York City and the surrounding area. These free-of-charge, corporate-sponsored branches operated as standalone spaces with their own staffs, serving as training grounds for curators including Thelma Golden, Shamim Momin, Lisa Phillips, and Debra Singer. The exhibitions and programming at these locations not only allowed the public more access to the Whitney\u2019s collection, but also met the needs of experimental artists by providing large spaces and performance opportunities. The last of the branches closed in 2008."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/aug/29/whitney-museum-black-artists-controversy", "page_content": "The Whitney Museum of American Art has seen its fair share of controversies over the past couple of years \u2014 its teargas-manufacturing board member Warren Kanders stepped down last summer after an onslaught of protests, while a recent Whitney Biennial was in hot water for showing white artist Dana Schutz\u2019s portrait of Emmett Till, a black boy lynched in 1955, in an open casket.\n\nNow, the New York museum has come under fire for taking advantage of artists, in a furore over how it acquired artworks at a charity fundraiser for cheaper prices.\n\nThe Whitney\u2019s planned exhibition, titled Collective Actions: Artist Interventions in a Time of Change, was supposed to open on 17 September. The description said the artists would be made up of \u201ccollectives to raise funds for anti-racist initiatives, including criminal justice reform, bail funds, Black trans advocacy groups, and other mutual aid work\u201d. The goal was to \u201cgive a sense of the hope, optimism, labor, and solidarity unfolding during this historic time of change\u201d.\n\nThe museum\u2019s research head, Farris Wahbeh, acquired some of the artworks for the exhibition at a discounted price at a print sale hosted by the See in Black project, a fundraiser for black mutual aid organizations that launched on Juneteenth (19 June).\n\nAs a result, the museum has been called out on social media for their \u201cpredatory\u201d process of acquiring artworks, which would have been included in the museum library\u2019s special collections, home to ephemera, artists books, posters and prints, \u201cthat document how artists distribute published materials as a form of practice\u201d.\n\nThe artists who donated their works to charity were not consulted on the sale of their pieces to the Whitney or paid (each artwork sold at $100). It was meant for personal art collections, not multimillion-dollar art museums.\n\nMany of the artists didn\u2019t know until Tuesday, when Wahbeh emailed the artists to tell them the museum purchased their work for its special collections and requested their biographical information to archive the works in their library.\n\nArtists shared the letter on Twitter, which read: \u201cI\u2019m so honored that your work will be on view in this exhibition and couldn\u2019t be more excited that it will reach Whitney audiences at this critical time.\u201d Many decried this approach to letting artists know they were part of an exhibition just weeks before it opened.\n\nThe New York critic Antwaun Sargent used Twitter to voice his concerns, asking: \u201cHow do you \u2018acquire\u2019 a work without the approval of the acquisition committee? Generally, that\u2019s a months long process.\u201d\n\nThe leaked artist list for the now-cancelled exhibition, which was based around the Black Lives Matter protests and the Covid-19 pandemic, included 79 participants, among them Denise Shant\u00e9 Brown, Bilphena Yahwon and Jamel Shabazz, among others.\n\nAllow Instagram content?

Wahbeh said in the follow-up email to artists: \u201cI understand how projects in the past several months have a special resonance and I sincerely want to extend my apologies for any pain that the exhibition has caused.\u201d\n\nThe photographer Lola Flash, who was included in the artist list for Collective Actions, feels the museum should have bought each artwork directly from the artists.\n\nAllow Instagram content?

Allow and continue\n\n\u201cMost of the artists are black and many of them queer, so this kind of response would have solidly shown that the Whitney does care about black lives,\u201d said Flash. \u201cOnce I realized that the entire show had been acquired in this \u2018bargain basement\u2019 process, I definitely felt taken advantage of.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, she says art fundraisers need to be organized differently. \u201cArtists need to ensure that organizations looking to fundraise must have rules in place, so public institutions are restricted from purchasing items,\u201d she said.\n\nFlash found the whole experience careless and harmful. \u201cBlack, queer artists rarely get acknowledged in the art world,\u201d she said. \u201cBetween Covid-19 and the police killing us, I\u2019m unclear how this kind of mismanagement could take place, but I\u2019m not surprised, sadly.\u201d\n\nThe focus should remain on the funds raised for organizations. \u201cThere was an urgency in raising money for black queer folk and I think the process took a back seat to the expediency,\u201d said Flash. \u201cThe organization that I worked with raised over $80,000, and on the positive side, it allowed ordinary people to buy art at super affordable rates. It\u2019s a shame that this part of the whole nightmare has been overlooked.\u201d\n\nBut while many artists have spoken up against the museum, some artists saw this exhibition as a great chance for exposure. Pakistan-based artist Hazem Asif was included in the exhibition after the curator found his artwork, a portrait of George Floyd bearing the phrase Black Lives Matter, on the Printed Matter website, as part of their Protest Pdfs online exhibition, which offers free, downloadable pdfs submitted by artists worldwide.\n\nArtwork by Hazem Asif.

The last few years were challenging \u2014 the pandemic was hard on arts organizations that depend on in-person audiences \u2014 and the world has changed in ways that might cause an institution that was born in the \u201960s to feel out of step or past its prime.\n\nBut the festival, which opens Friday at Lincoln Center, has remained relevant by staying more or less the same. According to the film historian Tino Balio, the festival at the time of its founding \u201cserved a cultural purpose by presenting the latest developments in international filmmaking, many of which would probably never have been shown publicly in New York.\u201d It also served \u201cas a pre-release showcase for films that had previously been acquired by lower-tier distributors. Only a small percentage of the festival presentations were predestined for commercial release, and only a few succeeded at the box office.\u201d\n\nThat sounds like a somber analysis, but it\u2019s actually a mission statement. And even though much has changed over the decades \u2014 some of those \u201clower-tier distributors\u201d were replaced by studio specialty divisions, and then by streaming platforms \u2014 the mission has remained admirably constant. Yes, there have been concessions to popularity, to the news media and to the Oscar race, and special showings of commercially thirsty releases, but the festival stands on the confident assertion that film is art.\n\nIn 1963, its inaugural year, that could sound like a fairly radical proposition, and it\u2019s still one that needs to be defended against pseudo-populist accusations of snobbery. The more interesting arguments, though, are the ones that follow from that proposition. What kind of art? For whom?

Following a toxic accident that may lead to an ecological catastrophe, the Gladney family scrambles to find peace in this oddly funny exploration of the horrors of consumerism.\n\nAll the Beauty and the Bloodshed\n\nThis documentary by the Academy Award-winning Laura Poitras of Citizenfour fame explores both the downfall of the Sackler family, founders of the pharmaceutical companies that many associate with the opiod epidemic, and the life and career of artist Nan Goldin, who fought against said companies.\n\nThe Inspection\n\nIn his first cinematic starring role, actor Jeremy Pope takes on the part of Ellis French, a gay Marine Corp in a boot camp on Parris Island in South Carolina who becomes the target of hazing practices from training instructor Leland Laws (Bokeem Woodbine) and recruit Laurence Harvey (Ra\u00fal Castillo) because of his sexual orientation. Gabrielle Union stars as Ellis' mother, Inez French.\n\nArmageddon Time\n\nArmageddon Time is set in Queens in 1980, when sixth grader Paul Graff (Banks Repeta) dreams of becoming an artist while striking a friendship with his Black classmate Johnny (Jaylin Webb), who is dealing with a racist teacher.

The great Anthony Hopkins plays Graff's grandfather, whom he shares a very close bond with.\n\nAftersun\n\nPhotograph: Courtesy of A24\n\nScottish director Charlotte Wells\u2019 debut is inspired by her own beautiful relationship with her father. The entire film takes place at a coastal resort in Turkey, where a divorced father and his daughter spend an entire weekend and where they are often mistaken for siblings.\n\nA Couple\n\nPhotograph: Courtesy of Zipporah Films\n\nAlthough inspired by a true story, A Couple is a work of fiction based on countess Sophia Behrs' own diaries and her husband Leo Tolstoy's letters to his beloved. Structured as a series of monologues, the piece focuses on the couple's 48-year-long marriage, which kicked off when he was 34 and she was 18, their 13 children and Behrs' own identity as an artist.\n\nDecision to Leave\n\nWhen a middle-aged businessman mysteriously falls to his death during a rock climbing expedition, Busan detective Hae-joon can't seem to shake off the case. Add to it all the fact that the detective starts falling for the businessman's abused wife, a Chinese national, and you've got yourself a can't-look-away-from-this thriller.\n\nMaster Gardener\n\nJoel Edgerton is Narvel Roth, the head horticulturist at Gracewood Gardens, the historic estate of one Norma Haverhill (a great Sigourney Weaver). When Haverhill's grand-niece, Maya (Quintessa Swindell), shows up, though, the balance between the two characters shifts, potentially affecting the future of Gracewood Gardens.\n\nOne Fine Morning\n\nOne Fine Morning follows the lives of single mother and professional translator Sandra (L\u00e9a Seydoux), who cares for her aging father (Pascal Greggory) while romantically linked to a clearly unavailable married dad (Melvil Poupaud).\n\nShowing Up\n\nPhotograph: Courtesy of A24\n\nMichelle Williams makes her return to the big screen as Lizzy Carr, a sculptor on the verge of an artistic breakthrough while working on her latest gallery show and dealing with her job at an art school, a fragmented family and more. This is the fourth collaboration between Williams and director Kelly Reichardt.

No\u00e9mie Merlant stars as T\u00e1r\u2019s assistant while Nina Hoss plays concertmaster Sharon Goodnow, also T\u00e1r\u2019s wife.\n\nTriangle of Sadness\n\nThis pretty funny movie earned Swedish director Ruben \u00d6stlund his second Palme d'Or at this year's Cannes Film Festival and for good reason: the movie follows two good looking young models as they embark on a a satirical romance that eventually leads them on a cruise for the super-rich. The movie is also \u00d6stlund's English-language feature film debut.\n\nBones and All\n\nCall Me by Your Name director Luca Guadagnino reunites with Timoth\u00e9e Chamalet in this adaptation of the eponymous novel by Camille DeAngelis. The film also stars Taylor Russell as Maren, a teenager who moves to a small town in Virginia with her father (Andr\u00e9 Holland) but soon runs away again by herself.\n\nPersonality Crisis: One Night Only\n\nPhotograph: Courtesy of Showtime\n\nMartin Scorsese does it again, this time focusing his camera on iconic American singer-songwriter David Johansen, the leader of the 1970s punk band The New York Dolls. But there's much more to Johansen than his music\u2014as made clear by the first few minutes of Scorsese's documentary, which features new and archival interviews, concert recordings and more.\n\nShe Said\n\nChronicling what many deem to be the kickoff to the #MeToo movement, She Said stars Zoe Kazan and Carey Mulligan as New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, who broke the story for the paper back in 2017. Based on the best-selling book written by the journalists themselves, the film looks at the decades of sexual harassment and assault that have defined the Hollywood industry.\n\nSolaris\n\nThe New York Film Festival is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the legendary science fiction film Solaris with a special screening featuring live musical accompaniment. Expect a newly created score that was specifically commissioned for the event. As a refresher, the film focuses on scientist Chris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) as he travels to a space station \"whose inhabitants have been attempting to make contact with the mysterious planet Solaris,\" reads an official synopsis.\n\nTill\n\nNigerian-American Chinonye Chukwu directs this heartbreaking film that tells the real-life story of Mamie Till-Mobley (Danielle Deadwyler), the American activist and educator that fought for justice following the 1955 lynching of her 14-year-old son Emmett Till (Jalyn Hall). Whoopi Goldberg, Frankie Faison and Haley Bennett round out the cast.\n\nWomen Talking\n\nPhotograph: Courtesy of United Artists Releasing\n\nAmong the plenty of standout aspects characterizing Sarah Polley's film Women Talking is the excellent cast, which includes Jessie Buckley, Claire Foy, Rooney Mara and Frances McDormand, among others.

Ravishingly filmed, this period piece, set in lonesome Montana in 1925, tells the story of a wealthy pair of cattle-ranching brothers (played by Jesse Plemons and Benedict Cumberbatch) who cope with the solitude of their work in very different ways. George (Plemons) is buttoned up to an extreme and only just manages to romance a local widow, Rose (Kirsten Dunst), into marrying him. Phil (Cumberbatch, in a bravura performance which will surely win him an Oscar) is unbridled and terrifyingly intelligent\u2014and wants nothing to do with his brother\u2019s conventionality. George\u2019s bride arrives with a teenage son, Peter (Kodi Smit-McPhee), whose graceful mannerisms and quiet confidence unbalance the film in unexpected ways.

In 2000, she married actor and filmmaker Andre Gregory. Kleine's 2013 do*entary Andre Gregory: Before and After Dinner is about him. It was funded through Kickstarter.\n\nKleine studied film at The Museum School and the MIT Film/Video Section, studying with Richard Lea*. She received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Tufts University and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in 1983 and a Master's of Fine Arts from Bard College in 1996.\n\nKleine's films have been shown at many film festivals, including Telluride, Seattle, San Francisco, Vancouver, the Boston Independent Film Festival, at the It\u2019s All True International Do*entary Festival in Brazil, the DOK Leipzig International Festival, and the Santa Fe International Film Festival. Her film Doug and Mike, Mike and Doug (1989), about artists Doug and Mike Starn- Starn Twins, was broadcast on PBS's POV Film Series.\n\nKleine's film Phyllis and Harold (2008) is about her parents' 59-year marriage.

There will be no parties, no frenzied comparing of notes in long screening lines.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that some films won\u2019t break big. The all-digital 2021 festival saw Sundance\u2019s highest ever sale, with Apple snapping up Sian Heder\u2019s CODA for $25 million. That film is now looking like a sturdy Oscar contender, as is the animated documentary Flee, which premiered at Sundance and could soon be nominated in a whopping four categories (picture, international feature, documentary, and animated).\n\nSo we turn to Sundance 2022 with some amount of hope. A vast array of films will premiere on the festival\u2019s intricate digital platform over the next ten days. Here are some of the titles we\u2019re most curious about.\n\nLiving\n\nThis British film has quite the pedigree. It\u2019s adapted from an Akira Kurosawa film, Ikiru. The adaptation was done by acclaimed novelist Kazuo Ishiguro. South African director Oliver Hermanus, whose last film, Moffie, was a highlight of last year, is behind the camera. And then there\u2019s the film\u2019s star, Bill Nighy, a long beloved thespian getting a rare leading role as a weary London government worker who receives some life-altering news. Living could play a bit like 2020 Sundance breakout The Father, which earned another beloved thespian, Anthony Hopkins, his second Oscar. Or it might just be a nice little bit of melancholy, in that very British fashion.\n\nMaster\n\nUp-and-coming director Mariama Diallo makes her feature debut with a film that continues in the tradition of Get Out (which also premiered at Sundance) by blending traditional frights with sociopolitical horror. Set on a college campus, the film takes real-life tensions within academia and makes them manifest via the supernatural. Which is an intriguing premise\u2014college campuses are fertile ground for interrogative fiction\u2014made all the more so by the film\u2019s cast. The great Regina Hall is involved, as are relative newcomer Zoe Renee, Never Rarely Sometimes Always breakout Talia Ryder and theater mainstay Amber Gray. Horror often reigns supreme at Sundance these days, and Diallo\u2019s film could be the master of that domain this year.\n\nSharp Stick\n\nIt\u2019s been a boggling 12 years since Lena Dunham\u2019s breakthrough film, Tiny Furniture, premiered at South by Southwest. Shortly thereafter, Dunham created a lightning-rod portrait of a certain kind of Millennial angst with the revered/reviled HBO series Girls. Then there were some years in the TV and internet wilds, and now there is Sharp Stick, billed as a comedy about a woman on a journey of sexual discovery. Which ought to get people buzzing, positively or negatively, in that good old Sundance way. Dunham, who also acts in the film, has assembled a nifty cast to aid in her effort: Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jon Bernthal, Zola star Taylour Paige, and Scott Speedman. In the lead is Kristine Froseth, who is known for her TV work but is now looking poised to ascend to a new career plane\u2014just as Dunham did over a decade ago.\n\nCha Cha Real Smooth\n\nFrom a Millennial wunderkind to a Gen Z one. In 2020, early twentysomething filmmaker Cooper Raiff debuted his first film, the winsome college dramedy Shithouse. Now a little bit older and perhaps a little bit wiser, Raiff is set to unveil his next feature, Cha Cha Real Smooth, about a listless recent college grad living back at home (or, rather, his mom\u2019s new home) and forging a bond with an autistic girl and her mother, played by Dakota Johnson. Somewhere in there he also becomes a bar mitzvah hype man, a career path rarely (if ever) depicted on film. The question is whether Raiff can deliver on the promise of Shithouse, which lilts and bites in a natural patter that, while hyper contemporary, harkens back to the early films of Richard Linklater. Cha Cha Real Smooth\u2019s premise gives hope, even if\u2014as with Shithouse\u2014that title gives us pause.\n\nNanny\n\nForged in the fires of the Sundance Lab, Nanny is another film that infuses social-issue drama with otherworldly creep. Writer-director Nikyatu Jusu makes her feature debut with a film about a young woman from Senegal who takes a nannying job for a wealthy Manhattan family, all while missing her own child, who\u2019s back in Senegal. The titular nanny is played by Anna Diop, known to superhero geeks as one of the stars of DC\u2019s Titans. The plot of Nanny\u2014which may involve ghosts or some other supernatural being stalking the lead character\u2014brings to mind recent African diaspora horror films Atlantics and His House. Which is very good company to be in.\n\nA Love Song\n\nSundance is often the festival where cherished character actors finally take center stage. Which is exactly what venerable indie actor Dale Dickey will do in Max Walker-Silverman\u2019s first feature. Dickey, who won a Spirit Award for her indelible supporting turn in Winter\u2019s Bone, stars opposite Wes Studi, playing old flames who reconnect at a campground somewhere in the American West. Perhaps A Love Song can do for Dickey and Studi what the 2015 Sundance drama I\u2019ll See You in My Dreams did for Blythe Danner and Sam Elliott\u2014or, y\u2019know, what Nomadland did for Frances McDormand and David Strathairn. Whatever A Love Song turns out to be, we\u2019re excited to see Dickey and Studi in long-deserved leading roles.\n\nGood Luck to You, Leo Grande\n\nWhile Emma Thompson\u2019s last Sundance outing, Late Night, didn\u2019t fare all that well when it was released in 2019, we\u2019re hoping that her new feature will be a course correction. That optimism comes from the fact that Emma Thompson is Emma Thompson, and the belief that it will be fun to see her play a retired schoolteacher who seeks out the company of a hunky young sex worker. But there\u2019s also the promise of the person behind the camera, Sophie Hyde. Her last feature, Animals, also premiered at Sundance in 2019, with much less heraldry than Late Night. Which is a shame, because Animals is a sharp and engrossing film that\u2019s well worth seeking out. (Its magnetic star, Holliday Grainger, had our vote for best actress of 2019.) We\u2019re eager to see if Hyde can work the same magic with Good Luck to You, Leo Grande\u2014and that more people pay attention this time.\n\nEmergency\n\nPerhaps acting as a companion piece to Master, Carey Williams\u2019s new film is set on a college campus and involves a group of friends debating whether or not to call the police after whatever the title is alluding to happens. Emergency\u2019s status as an opening-night film may be cause to worry\u2014the best stuff doesn\u2019t tend to premiere then\u2014but the setup is alluring, as is one of its stars, RJ Cyler. Last fall, Cyler was a commanding presence in The Harder They Fall, playing a hotshot young gunslinger with rakish charm. We\u2019re looking forward to seeing him strut his stuff once more, seven years after his Sundance debut in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl.\n\nJeen-Yuhs\n\nA three-part Netflix docuseries, Jeen-Yuhs follows little-known musician Kanye West over two decades of his life and career. We kid, we kid. Before the in-person plans were aborted, West\u2019s presence at Sundance was set to be the biggest celebrity occasion of the festival. We\u2019ll have to settle for osmosing his intensity through the TV screen instead, but Jeen-Yuhs still seems poised to make waves. While star-focused music documentaries can often play like little more than artfully composed press releases\u2014see, ironically enough, Taylor Swift\u2019s 2020 Sundance bow, Miss Americana\u2014we trust that West and filmmakers Clarence Simmons and Chike Ozah will do something interesting with their access. If West\u2019s story isn\u2019t the music narrative for you, there is also the festival premiere of Nothing Compares, about another brilliant and erratic artist, Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor.\n\nSummering\n\nIt\u2019s been seven years since director James Ponsoldt took a film to Park City. That was the lovely, aching The End of the Tour, a movie that should have gotten way more awards attention than it did. Ponsoldt has worked steadily since, but his Sundance reemergence still feels like something of a comeback. Or, hopefully, a return to form. We don\u2019t know much about Summering other than that it focuses on tweenage kids going on a \u201cmysterious adventure\u201d on the last weekend before school starts. Given how sensitive and insightful Ponsoldt can be at his best, Summering has the potential to be a significant festival breakout.\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\n\n\u2014 TV Star Sarah Wynter\u2019s Battle With Postpartum Psychosis\n\n\u2014 Caitr\u00edona Balfe\u2019s Celtic Conquest, From Outlander to Belfast\n\n\u2014 The Best Movies and Shows Streaming on Netflix This Month\n\n\u2014 21 Wardrobe Winners Inspired by And Just Like That\u2026\n\n\u2014 What Vivian Vance Didn\u2019t Love About I Love Lucy\n\n\u2014 The Life and Death of Rosanne Boyland, a Capitol Rioter\n\n\u2014 Insecure\u2019s Natasha Rothwell Can Do It All\n\n\u2014 From the Archive: Joan Didion, Our Lady of L.A.\n\n\u2014 Sign up for the \u201cHWD Daily\u201d newsletter for must-read industry and awards coverage\u2014plus a special weekly edition of \u201cAwards Insider.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2021/01/29/sundance-2021-all-best-movies-we-saw-virtual-film-festival/4307877001/", "page_content": "Instead of roughing it in the cold and snow of Park City, Utah, to get to various screenings at the annual Sundance Film Festival, we ventured toward the couch to watch the best of what independent cinema has to offer in 2021.\n\nLike the other big-time fests in Toronto, New York and elsewhere did in 2020, Sundance went virtual this year because of COVID, but didn't skimp on the cinematic goodness. This year's event included the world premiere of high-profile awards-season contender \"Judas and the Black Messiah\"; projects with stars like Tiffany Haddish, Tessa Thompson and Nicolas Cage; a ton of documentaries featuring the glam-rock duo Sparks; Hollywood legend Rita Moreno; \"Black Woodstock\" and a beloved children's show; plus a social media-driven update of Shakespeare's \"Romeo & Juliet.\"\n\nHere are the best films we saw this year at Sundance, ranked:\n\nSundance 2021:Here's how to watch this year's virtual film fest at home\n\n22. 'Strawberry Mansion'\n\nFilmmaking duo Kentucker Audley and Albert Birney's very strange romantic fantasy will break your brain but also fill your heart a bit. In a near-futuristic setting where the government audits people's dreams, bland federal agent James Preble (Audley) travels to the rural residence of an aging artist named Bella (Penny Fuller) who's made thousands of VHS dream tapes. Preble whips out his monstrous contraption to watch them (think virtual reality, if it was a thing in the '80s), and begins a journey that involves falling for young Bella (Grace Glowicki) and running into various characters including a strange man covered in grass; rodent sailors; and a frog waiter playing a sax.\n\n21. 'Censor'\n\nBritish director Prano Bailey-Bond's gory and meta midnight movie presents her as a horror force to watch, and star Niamh Algar is magnetic as Enid, a film censor whose job is to watch bloody, exploitative \"video nasties\" that were a controversial aspect of 1980s English film culture. Watching one of these low-budget works triggers a childhood trauma from her past \u2013 and the fact that her sister has been missing for decades \u2013 and Enid goes in search of answers. It's an OK execution on a knockout premise, and Bailey-Bond keeps the viewer unnerved throughout a twisty, visually mesmerizing nightmare.\n\n'Summer of Soul':Questlove takes us to forgotten 'Black Woodstock' in joyous concert doc\n\n20. 'How It Ends'\n\nThe dark comedy (filmed during COVID-19 quarantine last year) captures a lot of existential crises we\u2019re all feeling right now, but with way more recognizable guest-star cameos. Zoe Lister-Jones (who also writes and directs with husband Daryl Wein) stars as a woman in Los Angeles hanging with her younger self (Cailee Spaeny) on her final day on Earth prior to the apocalypse. The main character needs to work some stuff out with family and loved ones, and it\u2019s fun seeing who comes out to play, including Olivia Wilde as a psychic friend and Nick Kroll as a dude stocking up on drugs before The End.\n\n19. 'Homeroom'\n\nDirector Peter Nicks' thought-provoking and uplifting documentary follows the senior class of Oakland High School over the course of the 2019-20 school year, one unlike any other. Nicks captures the diverse student population preparing for the future and trying to get rid of the school's on-campus police force. And that's all before COVID-19 hits. After they're sent home and faced with graduating virtually, Nicks captures kids as they embrace change in the wake of George Floyd and organize to make their own lives and city better.\n\n18. 'Street Gang: How We Got to Sesame Street'\n\nDirector Marilyn Agrelo's documentary about the early days of \"Sesame Street\" is a fairly straightforward, soup-to-nuts origin story, but given the history of the groundbreaking children's program, she didn't have to do anything too fancy to make her point. A blast of nostalgia for those who grew up learning about the ABCs and 123s from Jim Henson's lovable Muppets, \"Street Gang\" is also a touching and, yes, educational look at the show's creators and their never-ending commitment to representation, teaching kids to love one another and be good people, and having some fun along the way.\n\n17. 'Coming Home in the Dark'\n\nNew Zealand director James Ashcroft's crime thriller is an incredibly intense, shocking and somewhat profound experience. A family taking a hike and enjoying some hilly scenery has its picnic interrupted by a pair of mysterious men, a brutal and chatty thug (Daniel Gillies) and his quiet, menacing figure (Matthias Luafutu). The villains take the family hostage, and what seems to be a chance encounter might not be as an old secret harbored by the father (Erik Thomson) comes to light.\n\n16. 'Passing'\n\nIn her directorial debut, Rebecca Hall crafts a splendidly shot black-and-white drama about race, gender, sex and the identities people create for themselves. In 1929 New York City, Irene (Tessa Thompson) runs into school friend Clare (Ruth Negga) \u2013 both are Black, but Clare \"passes\" herself off as white, to the world and to her unknowing husband (Alexander Skarsgard). Thompson and Negga both deliver solid performances as Clare spends more time in Harlem with Irene and her spouse (Andr\u00e9 Holland), complicating their home and social lives.\n\n15. 'John and the Hole'\n\nThis is the kind of thing you show kids when they think they're ready to be an adult. Part moody '70s psychological horror, part coming-of-age story, \"John\" is a family fable starring Charlie Shotwell as a 13-year-old who drugs his wealthy mom (Jennifer Ehle) and dad (Michael C. Hall) and sister (Taissa Farmiga) one night and sticks them at the bottom of an unfinished bunker, keeping them prisoner while he lives life his way. Pascual Sisto's directorial debut is disturbing, darkly comic and, in its own strange way, rather heartening.\n\n14. 'In the Earth'\n\nAfter mixed results redoing \"Rebecca,\" writer/director Ben Wheatley (\"Kill List\") is thankfully back to his original, bizarre genre mashups. In the trippy folk horror/sci-fi thriller, a mysterious virus plagues the world and a scientist (Joel Fry) and a guide (Ellora Torchia) venture to find a research site in a forest that turns people a little funny. Wheatley gives just a hint of potentially interesting mythology (wood spirits!), leaving much up for interpretation, but there's plenty of psychedelic, sensory-overloading sounds and visions courtesy of nature and the coolest park ranger ever.\n\n13. 'Prisoners of the Ghostland'\n\nIn completely bonkers fashion, director Sion Sono's supernatural action thriller blends \"Mad Max,\" \"The Running Man,\" \"Evil Dead,\" \"The Toxic Avenger\" and peak gonzo Nicolas Cage. A captured bank robber (Cage), held in a strange town full of Old West outlaws and Japanese samurai, is given a chance for freedom if he can venture into a bombed-out landscape and find the escaped daughter (Sofia Boutella) of the place's Southern-fried governor (Bill Moseley). This is the kind of movie where you just sit back, relax and watch Cage rage.\n\n12. 'On the Count of Three'\n\nComedian Jarrod Carmichael puts together a quite impressive, darkly humorous buddy film for his directorial debut. Suicidal best friends Val (Carmichael) and Kevin (Christopher Abbott) make a pact to shoot each other in the head. But first they have a few things to do on their final day, including ride dirt bikes, make some amends, engage in various crimes and exact bloody revenge. Tiffany Haddish and Henry Winkler both have small but key roles in the emotionally complex dramedy, and Carmichael and Abbott are great as ride-or-die buds who might not be totally ready for the \"die\" part.\n\n11. 'First Date'\n\nIf Quentin Tarantino made an indie teen comedy, it'd probably resemble this super-fun, fairly bloody spin on the \"one crazy night\" concept. Directed by Manuel Crosby and Darren Knapp, the film features star-in-the-making Tyson Brown as Mike, a boy who finally gets a date with his crush (Shelby Duclos) but his parents have taken the family van to Vegas. To pick her up in style, Mike buys a 1965 Chrysler clunker, the first of many bad decisions that put him on a collision course with cops, criminals and kooks.\n\n10. 'Misha and the Wolves'\n\nSam Hobkinson's immersive documentary is one heck of a roller-coaster ride of truth, imagination and storytelling, ultimately about what we will do to survive. Misha Defonseca has a tale that enraptures the entire world, about escaping Nazi occupation in her native Belgium and becoming part of a pack of wolves in the forest. Yet that's just where the twists and turns begin. Hobkinson creates a narrative that's part Holocaust film, part detective yarn, where you're invested in every character affected by the complex affair.\n\n9. 'Jockey'\n\nClifton Collins Jr. is fantastic as a fading horse rider in director Clint Bentley's directorial debut. Jackson (Collins) is a star jockey whose body is failing him as he gets older, but he's stubbornly determined to have one last championship season as a new horse and a rookie rider (Mois\u00e9s Arias) claiming to be his son enter his life. Bentley's father was a jockey, so there's a personal touch, and \"Jockey\" navigates a number of sports-movie cliches to deliver quite the equine experience.\n\n8. 'Together Together'\n\nEd Helms is an awkward delight and Patti Harrison is a snarky gem in the adorable comedy written and directed by Nikole Beckwith. Helms stars as a 40-something bachelor unlucky in love but who badly wants children, and he hires a young barista (Harrison) to be his surrogate. They start as two strangers who can't make it through a little bit of small talk and as the baby grows in her belly and they navigate the various pregnancy milestones, both discover they need this unexpected connection.\n\n7. 'Judas and the Black Messiah'\n\nDirector Shaka King's timely period drama functions as political thriller and historical vehicle, delving into the social unrest of the late 1960s with two very capable leads. Lakeith Stanfield is a Chicago criminal who avoids prison by becoming an FBI informant, and Daniel Kaluuya plays the target for his infiltration: Fred Hampton, the Black Panther Party chairman whose goal is to form a Rainbow Coalition of disenfranchised people. Kaluuya is especially great as a revolutionary orator and complex leader deemed too dangerous to exist by the federal government.\n\n6. 'Eight for Silver'\n\nThe werewolf tale gets a welcome refresh with writer/director Sean Ellis' freaky period piece. In the late 19th century, a cruel British land baron (Alistair Petrie) orders the killing and torture of a traveling band of Romanians, and the slaughter results in a curse that lets loose a terrifying beast \u2013 and not just the usual furry creature we've seen before. Boyd Holbrook is the pathologist hired to investigate when the wealthy man's boy vanishes in a gothic setting full of emotional depth and chilling body horror.\n\n5. 'R#J'\n\nShakespeare's \"Romeo & Juliet\" is retold through an iPhone lens, courtesy of co-writer/director Carey Williams' innovative film, which uses social media to craft its romantic drama starring Black and brown youths. The Montagues and Capulets are still feuding in fair Verona, and the Bard's lines remain, but this time the romance between Romeo (Camaron Engels) and Juliet (Francesca Noel) is fostered through GIF-filled text messages and Spotify playlist exchanges when their relatives are fighting on Instagram Live videos. \"R#J\" takes the world's most ubiquitous love story, makes it relevant again and even manages to create something new.\n\n4. 'Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go for It'\n\nWe knew Moreno is a trailblazing icon; she's also a blintz-loving, vibrant and impressively honest storyteller. Director Mariem P\u00e9rez Riera's fascinating documentary chronicles the star's life and work in a historical and influential context but is best when just winding Moreno up and letting her go. She tells of coming to America when she was 5, gets real about sexual assault and attempted suicide, and discusses her struggle to finally play a Latina onscreen. Moreno had to settle for \"island\" and \"native\" girl roles until Anita, her Oscar-winning character in \"West Side Story,\" became her role model \u201cbecause I never had one.\u201d\n\n3. 'The Sparks Brothers'\n\nThe glam-rock band Sparks, brothers Ron and Russell Mael's continually evolving group over the past 50-plus years, receives an epic documentary treatment from director Edgar Wright. This isn't \"Behind the Music\": Utilizing assorted animation styles and a flurry of famous faces like Mike Myers, Beck and Jane Wiedlin, \"Sparks Brothers\" is a supremely cool look at the eccentric California siblings' saga amid the ever-changing global music industry, being huge overseas but never in America, and what keeps them passionate and still together today.\n\n2. 'CODA'\n\nWritten and directed by Si\u00e2n Heder, the film is a sweet, inclusive and funny twist on the coming-of-age formula starring a fabulous Emilia Jones as Ruby, the only hearing member of a deaf Massachusetts fishing family. Ruby struggles to balance high school with commitments to her mom (Marlee Matlin), dad (Troy Kotsur) and headstrong big brother (Daniel Durant). But joining the school choir \u2013 and working with an eccentric and caring teacher (comedian Eugenio Derbez, more restrained than usual) \u2013 shows her that singing is a passion she wants to explore and unlocks a new part of herself that'll unleash all the tears.\n\n'CODA':Marlee Matlin talks inclusion, calls on Hollywood to 'hire more deaf actors'\n\n1. 'Summer of Soul (Or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised)'\n\nJust imagine the magic of seeing a 19-year-old Stevie Wonder live, joyfully going to town on keyboard and (yes) drums in the rain, and that's what Ahmir \"Questlove\" Thompson conjures in his directorial debut. Never-before-seen footage of the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival shows a divided community coming together to celebrate Black art. Most noteworthy are the spectacular musical performances lost for 50 years, including Mahalia Jackson and Mavis Staples' heavenly rendition of \"Take My Hand, Precious Lord,\" Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s favorite gospel song."}, {"url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/14-movies-to-see-at-sundance-2023", "page_content": "The Sundance Film Festival, which begins today, has returned to a mostly traditional in-person format (a selection of ticketed virtual screenings are on offer too)\u2014but the air of anticipation feels a little tentative. With a film industry grappling with an up-and-down, feast-or-famine 2022 and screening services reconsidering how they spend their billions, the economic future of Sundance-style indie films is very much up for debate.

Due to the ongoing pandemic, the showcase turned into a virtual event. Promising directors were still on hand to showcase their work, but viewers were able to watch them from the comfort of their living rooms. It wasn\u2019t just the way films were presented that changed, though. The pandemic also impacted how many of these movies were made and what they\u2019re about.\n\nThe shift is most obvious in films that are explicitly about the pandemic, of which there are several. For instance, These Days is a pilot episode that stars Marianne Rend\u00f3n and William Jackson Harper as two 20-somethings in New York struggling during the earlier stages of quarantine. Harper\u2019s character is a culture journalist reporting stories about Zoom orgies, while Rend\u00f3n is an aspiring dancer who feels like she\u2019s falling behind since she can no longer dance. At one point, her best friend complains that she misses the early days of toilet paper hoarding and Tiger King binge-watching. It feels like a time capsule of early 2020: much of the movie takes place over Zoom calls, and director Adam Brooks says each actor was sent an equipment package so that they could film from their apartments.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum is In the Same Breath, a documentary from director Nanfu Wang (perhaps best known for 2019\u2019s One Child Nation), which presents a harrowing account of the early stages of the pandemic from Wuhan, China, the city where things started. Wang was able to actually get cameras inside of various hospitals in the city to get first-hand accounts from patients and their families. It paints a troubling picture of hospitals that were overwhelmed and unprepared for the sheer scale of infections and a government unwilling to admit fault. Wang, who was born in China but lives in America, then turns her attention to the US, where a similar pattern emerges. Even as someone who has followed news of the pandemic closely since it started, I still found In the Same Breath an eye-opening experience.\n\n(One of the most arresting movies of Sundance, The Pink Cloud, is about living a life under lockdown, but amazingly, it was written in 2017 and filmed in 2019, long before COVID dominated our lives. It\u2019s eerily prescient.)\n\nIn the Earth. Photo: Sundance Institute\n\nIn other films, the impact is more subtle. The disorienting horror movie In the Earth is set amid a world ravaged by a deadly virus, but it mostly serves as a backdrop to a much stranger story about a fight against nature itself. Early on, you see people wearing masks and sanitizing their hands. But eventually, all of that goes away as the story moves in a very different direction, one centered on mythological creatures. Still, even these brief inclusions \u2014 things so common to everyday life now \u2014 serve to ground an otherwise manic film. The same goes for Searchers, a documentary about online dating, where there\u2019s plenty of footage of people in masks wandering the streets of New York. This doesn\u2019t really influence the stories people tell about their romantic lives. It\u2019s set-dressing more than anything.\n\nThe dramatic comedy How It Ends isn\u2019t about the pandemic in any way, but it\u2019s clear that directors Daryl Wein and Zoe Lister-Jones had to find creative ways around distancing restrictions. The story is playfully dark. With an asteroid scheduled to destroy Earth, Liza (played by Lister-Jones) goes on a small adventure to wrap up some loose ends in her life: revealing to her parents how their absence made her feel, reconnecting with a lost friend, telling off an ex who cheated, and capping it off with a hopefully hedonistic party.\n\nIt\u2019s not a Purge-style situation, though. This pre-apocalyptic movie is surprisingly quiet, as Liza wanders down mostly empty LA streets and stays six feet away from almost everyone. Strangely, it works. You do notice the distancing and emptiness, but it also puts a bigger focus on the characters and their performances, which are almost uniformly excellent. The limitations don\u2019t end up hampering the overall experience."}, {"url": "https://www.npr.org/2023/01/27/1151580060/sundance-film-festival-awards", "page_content": "Get these Sundance 2023 movies on your radar now\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sundance Institute Sundance Institute\n\nThe thing about the Sundance Film Festival \u2013 or any film festival, for that matter \u2013 is that it can be a fool's errand to try and predict the trajectory of a movie beyond the initial wave of critics' reactions and reports of multimillion distribution deals. Sure, CODA was a hit upon its premiere at the fest in 2021, but was anyone at that time thinking it would go on to become the first Sundance movie and a movie from a streaming service to win the Best Picture Oscar? On the other hand, an untold number of films have made a splash only to be buried and forgotten upon release months later.\n\nBut one thing I love about Sundance is that if you see enough movies, there are always going to be some gems and genuine surprises to stumble upon, particularly when it comes to emerging filmmakers and performers. And then you hope that at the very least they find an enthusiastic audience beyond us fest-goers.\n\nSundance 2023 took place in-person in Park City, Utah for the first time since 2020. I wasn't able to head out to the mountains this year, but much of the program was also made available to press and audiences online, and I wound up screening nearly 20 movies over the past week. We're still a couple days away from the conclusion of the festival, and the awards were announced on Friday \u2014 among the big winners were A.V. Rockwell's A Thousand and One, which won the Grand Jury Prize: Dramatic; Sing J. Lee, who won The Directing Award: U.S. Dramatic for The Accidental Getaway Driver; and Maryam Keshavarz's The Persian Version, which won the Audience Award: U.S. Dramatic. Here are a few of my favorites from this year.\n\nThe crowd pleasers\n\nIf there's one specific formula Sundance programmers and audiences can't resist, it's the quirky coming-of-age drama/comedy/dramedy. (See Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, CODA and Cha Cha Real Smooth, each of which won an Audience Award in their respective years.) Sometimes these movies can border on cloying and twee, but two such stories I saw this year managed to mercifully resist such categorization.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Parisa Taghizadeh/ Sundance Institute Parisa Taghizadeh/ Sundance Institute\n\nThe first is Polite Society, the genre-hopping feature directorial debut of Nida Manzoor, who is probably best known as the creator of the acclaimed series We Are Lady Parts. It stars Priya Kansara as Ria Khan, a plucky teen and aspiring stunt woman who takes it extremely personally when her older sister Lena (Ritu Arya) becomes engaged to a wealthy doctor. Ria, a die-hard feminist, is worried Lena has given up on her dreams of becoming an artist to go full-on Stepford Wife, so she'll do everything in her power to keep the wedding from happening, with the assist of her best friends. Lady Part's themes around sisterhood and feminine autonomy are all over this \u2013 as is the DNA of action-comedies like Kick-Ass and Everything Everywhere All at Once, and the twisty humor of Jordan Peele. The ensemble is a delight, especially Kansara and Nimra Bucha, who relishes her role as Lena's soon-to-be mother-in-law, and the script is sharp-witted and breezy. Luckily, you won't have to wait too long to check this out \u2013 it's currently scheduled for theatrical release on April 28.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sundance Institute Sundance Institute\n\nThe other is Molly Gordon and Nick Lieberman's Theater Camp, a mockumentary about a kids camp that faces two big setbacks: The loss of its beloved founder Joan (Amy Sedaris), who slips into a coma following a seizure during a production of Bye Bye Birdie, and impending financial doom. Her kind of dense, bro-y son Troy earnestly takes over, while the counselors, including alumni and best friends Amos and Rebecca-Diane (Ben Platt and Gordon) try to keep the show going.\n\nI'll admit that I'm especially biased on this one, having myself once been a theater kid \u2013 so I was able to overlook the bold and disappointing choice to cast the great Amy Sedaris only to relegate her to just a handful of minutes on screen. Also yes, the mockumentary format is mostly tired, Abbott Elementary aside. But many of the jokes about overenthusiastic theater geeks young and old landed for me. And the movie's final act, involving the kids' performance of a musical tribute to Joan, is both astonishingly silly and quite sweet. The ensemble was awarded the Special Jury Award. And it sold to Searchlight Pictures at the festival, so expect to see it released in the coming months.\n\nMen are not OK\n\ntoggle caption Glen Wilson/Sundance Institute\n\nThere was no shortage of iterations on the current state of misogyny and patriarchy among this year's Sundance offerings. One of the more interesting entries is Elijah Bynum's Magazine Dreams, which won a Special Jury Award for its creative team. It was the talk of the festival, at first for not-great reasons (the jury, which included actor Marlee Matlin, walked out on the premiere because the theater's open captions technology was not working), and then because of star Jonathan Majors' towering performance as Killian, a socially awkward loner and aspiring body builder. The movie draws heavily from the likes of Taxi Driver's Travis Bickle and Eminem's \"Stan,\" and heads in directions both obvious and confounding; the ending didn't work for me, but Majors is a sight to behold, creating a challenging character who both embodies and resists the old racist trope of the \"Black brute.\"\n\ntoggle caption Sundance Institute\n\nI also really dug Chloe Domont's Fair Play, a thriller about a newly engaged heterosexual couple whose relationship is tested when one of them gets a promotion over the other at the cutthroat financial firm where they both work. Can you guess which one of them doesn't get the coveted position? Why yes, it's the man, Luke (Alden Ehrenreich), who tries really hard \u2013 at first \u2013 to be supportive of Emily (Phoebe Dynevor), his fianc\u00e9e and, now, his superior. The guy who's threatened by his girlfriend's/wife's career is a tale as old as time, but Domont puts a spin on it that feels very in tune with the now and all the discourse being had about the fraught nature of girl bosses and workplace relationships. (Netflix reportedly acquired it in a $20 million deal.)\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sundance Institute Sundance Institute\n\nOn a lighter note, the spiky rom-com Shortcomings deals with fragile masculinity from an Asian American perspective. It stars Justin H. Min as Ben, a wannabe filmmaker living in Berkeley, Calif., who's stuck in both a professional and romantic rut. When Ben's girlfriend Miko (Ally Maki) leaves for New York to pursue an internship, he's forced to finally confront his many insecurities and internalized racism \u2013 Miko and his best friend, Alice, played by Sherry Cola, frequently call out his fetish for blonde white women, as well as his hypocritical disdain for Asian women who date white men. Screenwriter Adrian Tomine adapted his graphic novel of the same name, and it marks the directorial debut of Randall Park; while it hits some familiar beats, the banter is often funny and the script heads to places few rom-coms dare go.\n\nFinding family, finding yourself\n\nAmong my absolute favorite finds this year were several movies dealing with themes of memory, generational bonds, and self-discovery.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jaclyn Martinez/Sundance Institute Jaclyn Martinez/Sundance Institute\n\nRaven Jackson's debut All Dirt Roads Taste of Salt is a poetic, non-linear narrative that traverses several decades in the life of a Mississippi woman, from childhood through adulthood. This isn't about plot, but about the moments of mundanity made profound through the inquisitive eyes of Mack (played as a kid by Kaylee Nicole Johnson and older by Charleen McClure) and the camera's lingering gaze: fishing with dad, parents slow-dancing in the living room, listening to grandma's stories. One scene in particular stuck with me and is already in the running for best scenes of the year \u2013 a quiet, trembling embrace that carries with it the weight of years, loss and connection without a single word. (There is in fact, very little dialogue throughout the film.) In stunning imagery and tone, it feels like a direct descendant of Julie Dash's Daughters of the Dust, yet stands powerfully on its own as a rumination on Black womanhood and its existence within nature. And as if you need any more reason to be on the lookout for this movie, Barry Jenkins is a producer.\n\ntoggle caption Sundance Institute\n\nMilisuthando Bongela's documentary Milisuthando is similarly evocative, though Bongela embraces dialogue and a more literal approach, creating a compelling personal essay brought to life on screen. Through home movies, interviews, and tons of striking archival footage, she excavates the lingering effects of South African apartheid on herself and her friends and family. She challenges the myths that were perpetuated by those who supported the Transkei, an unrecognized state that was created in 1976 under the pretense that it would liberate the Xosha people and shield them from the harms of apartheid. And she questions what it means to have white friends in South Africa, which includes an illuminating, unflinching conversation between the filmmaker and her friend (and the movie's producer) Marion Isaacs. The country's history with race is emotionally rendered and made deeply personal in a way I haven't quite seen before.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sundance Institute Sundance Institute\n\nAnd then there's Patricia Ortega's MAMACRUZ, a charming Spanish-language film about Cruz (Kiti M\u00e1nver), an older woman who has a late-in-life sexual awakening after discovering porn on the internet. The premise definitely leaves room for cheekiness (a scene where Cruz watches a couple have sex with chocolate is immediately followed up with the image of a churro being dipped in chocolate sauce), but the protagonist's journey is treated seriously and with warmth. Cruz makes friends with other women in a sex therapy group, and tries to spice up the intimacy with her distant, barely affectionate husband. She struggles to reconcile her desires with her devoutly religious beliefs. And she attempts to reconnect with her daughter, who is herself trying to realize a dream later in life, of becoming a professional dancer. If you enjoyed last year's Sundance hit Good Luck to You, Leo Grande (like I did), you'll definitely find pleasure in MAMACRUZ. (International rights to the movie were snagged by Spanish distributor Filmax.)"}]}
