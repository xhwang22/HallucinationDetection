He was the second son of Eastern Wei 's paramount general Gao Huan . Following the death of his brother and Gao Huan's designated successor an eldest son Gao Cheng in 549, Gao Yang became the regent of Eastern Wei. In 550, he forced Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei to yield the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and starting Northern Qi.\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for attentiveness to military matters, and the strength of the Northern Qi military was at its prime. He also tried to equalize the tax burden and reduce corruption by offering officials sufficient salary. He entrusted most governmental matters to the capable Yang Yin, and for a while, the government was effective, and the military was strong. In his later years, Emperor Wenxuan suffered from alcoholism and possibly insanity. Chinese historical annals recorded his bloody rages, nevertheless his reign, with assistance from his Chinese advisers, was considered well-administered and effective.\n\nRead more...: Early life As Eastern Wei regent Early reign Late reign Physical appearance Family Ancestry\n\nEarly life\n\nGao Yang was born in 526, while his father Gao Huan was a general under Northern Wei's paramount general Erzhu Rong. His mother Lou Zhaojun was Gao Huan's wife, on whose financial support Gao's early career had relied on. Lou Zhaojun was from a wealthy Xianbei family. He was their second son, after his older brother Gao Cheng. After Erzhu Rong's death in 530, Gao Huan overthrew Erzhu's family and became Northern Wei's paramount general, and after Northern Wei divided into Eastern Wei and Western Wei in 534 became the actual power controlling Eastern Wei. Gao Yang thus grew up in a household of power. In 535, he was created the Duke of Taiyuan (\u592a\u539f\u516c).\n\nGao Yang was not well regarded as a child, as he was awkward in interpersonal skills and at times considered developmentally disabled, being unable to carry out many tasks common for children, though it appears that he feigned this to prevent suspicion of his elder brother. It appeared that he was actually of fairly high capability in many areas, and once, when Gao Huan tried to test his children's intelligence by giving them tangled balls of yarn to untangle, Gao Yang took out his sword and sliced the ball open, stating that that was the only solution. As Gao Huan's sons grew older, on one occasion, Gao Huan wanted to test their military abilities by having his general Peng Le (\u5f6d\u6a02) launch a mock attack on them. All of Gao Huan's sons, including the older Gao Cheng, were fearful, but Gao Yang reacted calmly and actually captured Peng. As he grew, he continued to be awkward and appearing to be unintelligent, and Gao Cheng, in particular, often looked down on him.\n\nGao Huan died in 547, and thereafter, Gao Cheng, who had already controlled many aspects of Eastern Wei imperial government's operations, took over as regent. He moved to consolidate his power further, and when Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei tried to form a plot to kill him, he discovered the plot and put Emperor Xiaojing under effective house arrest. He then planned taking the throne himself, but at a meeting in 549 at the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan, Hebei), with his officials Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212), and Yang Yin, to discuss the procedure for doing so, he was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac), who was angry at his wrongful treatment. At that time, Gao Yang happened to be in Yecheng, and he quickly gathered the guards and killed Lan and his co-conspirators. He chose not to announce Gao Cheng's death immediately, while moving to consolidate power.\n\nAs Eastern Wei regent\n\nInitially, Emperor Xiaojing, who had received rumors that Gao Cheng had died, thought he might have a chance to regain power. However, upon meeting Gao Yang, who made a display of force by having more than 8000 guards accompany him, Emperor Xiaojing saw that Gao Yang could not be easily dealt with. Meanwhile, Gao Yang headed for the Gaos' stronghold of Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), and consolidated his military command there, quickly impressing the generals who had previously looked down on him with quick and careful decisions.\n\nIn fall and winter 549, with rival Liang Dynasty under internal turmoil after the rebellion of Hou Jing (a former Eastern Wei general who had defected to Liang in 547), Gao Yang sent Peng Le to attack the Liang border provinces, taking over the region between the Huai River and Yangtze River with ease.\n\nIn spring 550, Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing convey on him the greater title of Prince of Qi Commandery. Two months later, his title was made the even greater title of Prince of Qi.\n\nIn summer 550, under advice from the officials Gao Dezheng (\u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f), Xu Zhicai (\u5f90\u4e4b\u624d), and Song Jingye (\u5b8b\u666f\u696d), Gao Yang decided to take the throne, despite reservations from Gao Yang's mother Princess Dowager Lou. He therefore headed from Jinyang to Yecheng, but even as he was on the way and had reached the halfway city of Pingdu (\u5e73\u90fd, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi), the officials largely pretended to ignore his overtures at taking the throne, so he returned to Jinyang. Soon thereafter, he had Emperor Xiaojing issue an edict conferring the nine bestowments on him, further displaying his posture of taking the throne. He then proceeded to Yecheng again, and Emperor Xiaojing yielded the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and establishing Northern Qi, with Gao Yang as its Emperor Wenxuan. He created the former Emperor Xiaojing the Prince of Zhongshan. He posthumously honored Gao Huan and Gao Cheng as emperors, while honoring his mother as empress dowager.\n\nEarly reign\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for being attentive to important matters of state, particularly military matters. He revised Eastern Wei laws, and he selected elite soldiers from both Xianbei and Han ethnicities to form the border defense corps. To equalize the tax and labor burden, he divided the households under his rule into nine classes based on their wealth, requiring the wealthy to pay more taxes and the poor to contribute more labor. Continuing a trend set by both his father Gao Huan and his brother Gao Cheng, he divided his time between Yecheng and Jinyang, effectively making Jinyang a second capital.\n\nJust like his father Gao Huan, Emperor Wenxuan viewed himself as more of a Xianbei rather than Chinese. Further, more than his father did, he was not willing to follow most of the Chinese traditions. Because of this, Gao Dezheng and another official, Gao Longzhi (\u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b), who wanted to ingratiate themselves with Emperor Wenxuan's cousin and powerful general Duan Shao (\u6bb5\u97f6), suggested he make Duan Shao's sister Lady Duan, a concubine of his, empress. Emperor Wenxuan did not follow their advice and, pursuant to expected norm, created his wife Princess Li Zu'e empress and created her son Gao Yin crown prince.\n\nIn response to the establishment of Northern Qi, Yuwen Tai, the paramount general of rival Western Wei, launched a major attack on Northern Qi. Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops to defend against Yuwen's attack. When Yuwen saw that Emperor Wenxuan's troops were well-organized, he sighed and stated, \"Gao Huan is not yet dead.\" He was unable to overcome Emperor Wenxuan's defense and so was forced to withdraw, and in fact lost some border commanderies to Northern Qi in the campaign.\n\nAround the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan wanted to put the former emperor, the Prince of Zhongshan, to death. He first invited his sister and the prince's wife, the Princess Taiyuan, to a feast. As soon as she left the prince's household, he sent assassins to force the prince to drink poison, and also killed his three sons. He buried the former emperor with imperial honors, but at a later point, for reasons unknown, he dug out the former emperor's casket and threw it into the Zhang River (\u6f33\u6c34, flowing near Yecheng).\n\nIn spring 552, Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops against the Kumo Xi tribe (in the upper Liao River drainage area) and achieved a great victory. Around the same time, he also sent generals to seize certain border cities with Liang, as Liang troops continued to battle Hou Jing, who declared himself the Emperor of Han in 551 but was subsequently defeated by Emperor Yuan of Liang in 552. The campaigns of seizing Liang cities continued even after Hou's defeat, although he did not at this point launch a single major attack on Liang. The campaigns appeared to end in winter 552, and Emperor Wenxuan in fact promised the Liang generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian, whom Emperor Yuan put in charge of the eastern half of Liang territory, to return the cities of Guangling (\u5ee3\u9675, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) and Liyang (\u6b77\u967d, in modern Chaohu, Anhui).\n\nAlso in winter 552, Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops from Jinyang to Lishi (\u96e2\u77f3, in modern L\u00fcliang, Shanxi), and he ordered the construction of a great wall from Huanglu Mountain (\u9ec3\u6ae8\u5dba, also in modern L\u00fcliang) to Sheping Fortress (\u793e\u5e73\u620d, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi), apparently to defend against Western Wei and Tujue.\n\nIn winter 553, Khitan tribes were attacking Northern Qi's northern borders, and Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops to attack Khitan\u2014and on this campaign, he was described as personally exposing himself to the dangers and contributing much personally to defeating the Khitan.\n\nAlso in winter 553, Emperor Wenxuan, wanting to put Northern Qi-friendly emperor on the Liang throne, commissioned an army commanded by Guo Yuanjian (\u90ed\u5143\u5efa) to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Tui (\u856d\u9000), who had surrendered to Eastern Wei in 548, back to Liang territory. However, Northern Qi forces were defeated by the Liang general Hou Tian (\u4faf\u7471), and Xiao Tui returned to Yecheng.\n\nAround the new year 554, the remnants of Rouran, which by that point was near its end, surrendered to Northern Qi to seek protection from Tujue attacks. Emperor Wenxuan personally attacked the Tujue, fighting its army off, and then created Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen as the new khan of Rouran, settling the Rouran people within Northern Qi territory, at Mayi (\u99ac\u9091, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi).\n\nIn spring 554, Emperor Wenxuan, assisted by the senior general Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1) and his brother Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, launched a major attack on the Shanhu (\u5c71\u80e1) tribe (in modern L\u00fcliang). After victory, he ordered that all 11-year-old and older males of the Shanhu be slaughtered, and that the females and the young males be awarded as spoils of war to the soldiers. When one of his commanders died because that commander's lieutenant, Lu Huili (\u8def\u6689\u79ae), was unable to save him, Emperor Wenxuan ordered that Lu's internal organs be cut out of his body and that the soldiers consume them. Many traditional historians, including Li Yanshou (\u674e\u5ef6\u58fd), the author of the History of Northern Dynasties, and Sima Guang, the author of the Zizhi Tongjian, saw this battle as the turning point of Emperor Wenxuan's rule\u2014that thereafter, he began to act violently and capriciously. For example, in spring 554, when Rouran rebelled and he personally led troops to defeat Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen, he felt that warhorses offered by the general Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) the Prince of Anding were not of sufficient quality\u2014and he punished Heba by plucking out Heba's hair and demoting to commoner status, and further ordering Heba to serve as a worker in a coal processing facility. In another example, in fall 554, after he had put the official Yuan Xu (\u5143\u65ed), a former Northern Wei prince, to death, he remembered the snubs that Gao Longzhi, who was a friend of Yuan Xu's, had shown him before he became Eastern Wei's regent, and he had Gao Longzhi battered so severely that Gao Longzhi died several days later\u2014and at a later point, still angry at Gao Longzhi, arrested Gao Longzhi's 20 sons and, with 20 executioners lined up, had the sons beheaded simultaneously, and then threw their bodies and Gao Longzhi's body into the Zhang River.\n\nStarting in 551, Emperor Wenxuan had ordered his official Wei Shou to compile a history of Northern Wei. Wei Shou completed the work in 554, but his work (Book of Wei) was criticized by many to be defamatory to ancestors of many political enemies (so much so that they referred to the work as Huishu (\u7a62\u66f8\u2014the Book of Filth)), and several officials filed reports condemning Wei Shou. Wei Shou submitted a petition to Emperor Wenxuan defending himself, and Emperor Wenxuan, in an act that he believed to be protecting the integrity of history, jailed the officials who condemned Wei Shou.\n\nIn late 554, Western Wei launched a major attack on Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), then the capital of Liang. Emperor Wenxuan commissioned an army commanded by Gao Huan's cousin Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3) the Prince of Qinghe to attack Western Wei's An Province (\u5b89\u5dde, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei) to try to relieve pressure from Jiangling, but by the time that Gao Yue arrived, Jiangling had already fallen, and Western Wei captured and then executed Emperor Yuan.\n\nLate reign\n\nWestern Wei declared Emperor Yuan's nephew Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang (known in history as the Western Liang), but the declaration was not recognized by most Liang generals, and the chief of those generals, Wang Sengbian, welcomed Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an to the old Liang capital Jiankang, declaring him the Prince of Liang in spring 555 and preparing to make him emperor. Emperor Wenxuan had other ideas, however, and he created Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, whom Eastern Wei captured in 547 during Liang's attempt to aid Hou Jing's rebellion against Eastern Wei, emperor, commissioning his brother Gao Hu\u00e0n (\u9ad8\u6e19, note tone difference with his father) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Xiao Yuanming back to Liang territory. Emperor Wenxuan wrote letters to Wang recommending Xiao Yuanming as emperor, arguing that Xiao Fangzhi (who was 12 years old) was too young. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after Gao Huan won a few battles over Wang's generals, Wang decided to submit and, after Northern Qi escorting troops agreed to limit their presence to 1,000 men, and Xiao Yuanming agreed to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince, accepted Xiao Yuanming as emperor. To show his good faith, Wang sent his son Wang Xian (\u738b\u986f) and nephew Wang Shizhen (\u738b\u4e16\u73cd), as well as Wang Xian's mother Lady Liu, to Yecheng as hostages. Xiao Yuanming became Liang's emperor, and there was peace between Northern Qi and Liang, with Liang now a vassal.\n\nJust four months later, however, the situation changed. Wang Sengbian's lieutenant Chen Baxian, displeased over Xiao Yuanming's ascension (as he saw Xiao Yuanming's claim as being too attenuated), make a surprise attack on Jiankang from his headquarters of Jingkou (\u4eac\u53e3, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), killing Wang Sengbian and forcing Xiao Yuanming to yield the throne to Xiao Fangzhi (who took the throne as Emperor Jing). Initially, Chen claimed that Liang would still agree to be a vassal, and Emperor Wenxuan sent the official Sima Gong (\u53f8\u99ac\u606d) to swear an oath with Liang officials. However, with several generals loyal to Wang Sengbian rising against Chen following Wang's death, Emperor Wenxuan's mind changed, particularly after two, Xu Sihui (\u5f90\u55e3\u5fbd) and Ren Yue (\u4efb\u7d04) submitted to him, making a surprise attack on the near-Jiankang fortress Shitou and capturing it. Emperor Wenxuan sent the general Xiao Gui (\u856d\u8ecc) to reinforce Xu and Ren. Chen defeated Northern Qi troops and Xu and Ren, however, and Xiao Gui's assistant Liu Damo (\u67f3\u9054\u6469), sieged by Chen in Shitou, sought peace. Chen agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (\u9673\u66c7\u6717), Emperor Jing's nephew Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (\u738b\u73c9), the son of the key official Wang Chong (\u738b\u6c96), to serve as hostages to Northern Qi, allowing Liu to withdraw. (Upon Liu's return to Northern Qi, however, Emperor Wenxuan had him executed.)\n\nDuring the campaign against Liang, Emperor Wenxuan made another display of his increasing instability, as he, jealous over the fact that his concubine Consort Xue had previously had a sexual relationship with Gao Yue, ordered Gao Yue to commit suicide. Thereafter, he beheaded Consort Xue and hid her head in his sleeves. At a banquet later that day, he tossed her head onto a platter and cut her body into pieces, beginning to play with her leg, which he converted into a fiddle, surprising all of the banquet attendants. At the end of the banquet, he packed her body parts and began crying, following the cart carrying her body on foot.\n\nIn fall 555, Emperor Wenxuan became convinced that Buddhism and Taoism should be but one religion, and that one of them should be merged into the other. He had the leading Buddhist and Taoist monks debate before him, and he declared the Buddhists the victors, ordering Taoism merged into Buddhism and Taoist monks to become Buddhist monks. Some Taoist monks initially rejected this edict, but after he executed four monks, the others submitted, and Taoism became banned within Northern Qi.\n\nIn spring 556, border battles between Northern Qi and Liang resumed, and Northern Qi prepared another campaign against Liang. In summer 556, Northern Qi forces were again south of the Yangtze, operating in Jiankang's vicinity, but they were stalemated against Liang troops, eventually defeated by Chen and his generals after they ran out of food. A number of Northern Wei generals were captured and executed by Liang, and in response, Emperor Wenxuan put Chen Tanlang to death.\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's erratic behavior became even greater in scope, fueled by his alcoholism. As described by Sima Guang in his Zizhi Tongjian:\n\n:... Wenxuan drank heavily and lived immorality, carrying out cruel and barbarous act at his on whim. Sometimes he sang and danced day and night. Sometimes he spread his hair and wore barbarian clothing with colorful sashes. Sometimes he bared his body and put on makeup. Sometimes he rode donkeys, cows, camels, or elephants without using saddles. Sometimes he ordered Cui Jishu or Liu Taozhi (\u5289\u6843\u679d) to carry him and a large drum to allow him to beat the drums. He was accustomed to making surprise charges into the nobles' and imperial officials' private residences. He often crossed streets, sometimes sitting in the streets and sometimes even sleeping on them. Sometimes when it is warm, he would be naked to bask in the sun, but even in the coldest winter, he would strip naked as well and run around. His attendants could not stand his behavior, but he himself did not care. ... Once, he asked a woman on the street, \"How is the Son of Heaven like?\" The woman responded, \"He is so crazy that he really cannot be considered a Son of Heaven.\" He beheaded her.\n\nOnce, when he was drunk and acting irrationally, his mother Empress Dowager Lou rebuked him, and he threatened to marry her to an old barbarian. When she became angry, he became fearful, and he wanted to induce her to smile again, so he crawled on the ground under her seat, but in doing so, he flipped the seat over, and she was injured. After he sobered up, he realized how she had been injured, and he set a large fire, intending to jump in to die, causing her to have to grab him to save him. He thereafter pledged not to drink any more, but was only able to do so for 10 days before he began drinking again. He also once shot an arrow at Empress Li's mother Lady Cui and whipped her. Further, it was described that most women of the imperial Gao clan were forced to have sexual relations with him at one point or another. When Gao Huan's concubine Erzhu Ying'e, the Princess Dowager of Pengcheng, refused, he killed her with his own hands. Emperor Wenxuan also became homicidal when he drank, and he always wanted to kill people when he was drunk. Yang Yin, who was prime minister at this point, therefore set up a group of condemned prisoners and a saw to be available to the palace guards\u2014if Emperor Wenxuan wanted to kill someone, a condemned prisoner would be brought out for him to kill, and if a prisoner was able to survive for three months without being killed, he would be set free.\n\nHowever, even in his erratic behavior, Emperor Wenxuan was still attentive to many important matters, and because of his harshness, his officials did not dare to be corrupt. Further, Yang was a capable prime minister, and Emperor Wenxuan gave him full authorization to carry out laws properly. Therefore, it was said at the time that while the emperor was violent and insane, the government was nevertheless efficient.\n\nIn winter 557, believing prophecies that Gao Hu\u00e0n would be emperor, he ordered Gao Hu\u00e0n arrested. Gao Hu\u00e0n tried to resist, but was nevertheless captured and delivered to Yecheng. When another brother, Gao Jun (\u9ad8\u6d5a) the prince of Yong'an, sent petitions urging him to change his behavior, he had Gao Jun arrested as well, and the two princes were imprisoned in a dungeon.\n\nAlso in winter 557, Chen Baxian had Liang's Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing Chen Dynasty, and subsequently had Emperor Jing killed in 558. The general Wang Lin, then in control of modern Hunan and eastern Hubei, refused to submit to Chen and sought to continue Liang's lineage. He therefore requested Northern Qi to return Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia to be emperor. In spring 558, Northern Qi troops escorted Xiao Zhuang to Wang's territory, and Wang declared Xiao Zhuang emperor, as a Northern Qi vassal, with his capital at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan, Hubei).\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's military campaigns and other wasteful behavior had caused the imperial treasury to be drained. He had also become unhappy with his son Gao Yin, believing that Gao Yin was too Han-like in behavior, and he considered deposing Gao Yin. Once, he ordered Gao Yin to personally execute a prisoner, but Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and Emperor Wenxuan battered him with a whip handle, causing Gao Yin to thereafter have a panic disorder and at times unable to speak. When Emperor Wenxuan became drunk, he would often state that he might eventually pass the throne to his brother Gao Yan, and he stopped stating as such only after urging by Yang and Wei Shou, who believed that his words were causing an unstabling effect in causing a doubt as to who would succeed him.\n\nAround the new year 559, Emperor Wenxuan visited the imprisoned Gao Jun and Gao Hu\u00e0n. He initially took pity on them and considered releasing them, but, at the urging of another brother, Gao Zhan the Prince of Changguang, did not do so, and further started to pierce them with spears. He also ordered that torches be thrown at them, burning them to death. He rewarded the princes' wives to the soldiers who delivered the death blows.\n\nIn summer 559, Emperor Wenxuan, suspecting that the members of the Northern Wei imperial Yuan clan would eventually try to return to power, ordered the Yuans to be slaughtered, regardless of age or gender, and had the bodies thrown into the Zhang River. In particular, a man named Yuan Huangtou flown off a tower strapped to a kite as part of an experiment of Emperor Wenxuan, the first known case of human flight. He survived but was starved to death in prison. Only several households who were particularly close to the Gaos were spared.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne.\" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei. The officials tried to mourn at his death, but no one was actually able to shed a tear other than Yang Yin. Not long after, Gao Yan killed Yang Yin and deposed Gao Yin, becoming emperor.\n\nPhysical appearance\n\nIn the Book of Northern Qi, author Li Baiyao notes that Gao Yang was a dark-skinned man with large and protruding jaws, and that his skin appeared to be abnormally rough.\n\nFamily\n\nConsorts and Issue:\n\n\u2022 Empress Zhaoxin, of the Li clan of Zhao (\u662d\u4fe1\u7687\u540e \u8d99\u90e1\u674e\u6c0f), personal name Zu'e (\u7956\u5a25)\n\n\u2022 Gao Yin, Prince Jinan Mindao (\u6fdf\u5357\u610d\u60bc\u738b \u9ad8\u6bb7; 545\u2013561), first son\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaode, Prince Taiyuan (\u592a\u539f\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u5fb7; 548\u2013562), second son\n\n\u2022 Princess Changle (\u9577\u6a02\u516c\u4e3b), personal name Baode (\u5bf6\u5fb7)\n\n\u2022 Married Wei Shibian (\u5c09\u4e16\u8faf)\n\n\u2022 Princess Yining (\u7fa9\u5be7\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Hul\u00fc Wudu (\u659b\u5f8b\u6b66\u90fd; d. 572), the first son of Hul\u00fc Guang\n\n\u2022 Furen, of the Yan clan (\u5f18\u5fb7\u592b\u4eba \u984f\u6c0f; 530\u2013576), personal name Yuguang (\u7389\u5149)\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaolian, Prince Longxi (\u96b4\u897f\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u5ec9; 553\u2013577), fifth son\n\n\u2022 Pin, of the Pei clan (\u5b2a \u88f4\u6c0f)\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaoren, Prince Xihe (\u897f\u6cb3\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u4ec1; d. 577), fourth son\n\n\u2022 Pin, of the Xue clan (\u5b2a \u859b\u6c0f; d. 555)\n\n\u2022 A daughter\n\n\u2022 Shifu, of the Feng clan (\u4e16\u5a66 \u99ae\u6c0f)\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaoyi, Prince Fanyang (\u8303\u967d\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u7fa9; d. 580), third son\n\n\u2022 Unknown\n\n\u2022 Princess Zhongshan (\u4e2d\u5c71\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Duan Baoding of Wuwei (\u6b66\u5a01 \u6bb5\u5bf6\u9f0e)\n\nAncestry"}, {"url": "https://www.nouahsark.com/en/infocenter/culture/history/monarchs/emperor_wenxuan_of_northern_qi.php", "page_content": "Emperor Wenxuan of (Northern) Qi ((\u5317)\u9f4a\u6587\u5ba3\u5e1d) (529\u2013559), personal name Gao Yang (\u9ad8\u6d0b), courtesy name Zijin (\u5b50\u9032), was the first emperor of the Chinese dynasty northern qi. He was the second son of eastern wei's paramount general Gao Huan, and the death of his brother and Gao Huan's designated successor Gao Cheng in 549 became the regent of eastern wei. In 550, he forced Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei to yield the throne to him, ending eastern wei and starting northern qi.\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for attentiveness to military matters, and the strength of the northern qi military was at its prime. He also tried to equalize the tax burden and reduce corruption by offering officials sufficient salary. He entrusted most governmental matters to the capable Yang Yin, and for a while, the government was effective, and the military was strong. However, Emperor Wenxuan eventually turned cruel, and his erratic behavior, fueled by alcoholism, plunged his administration into chaos.\n\n\n\nEarly life Gao Yang was born in 529, while his father Gao Huan was a Han chinese general under northern wei's paramount general Erzhu Rong. His mother Lou Zhaojun was Gao Huan's wife, on whose financial support Gao's early career had relied on. Lou Zhaojun was an ethnic Xianbei. He was their second son, after his older brother Gao Cheng. After Erzhu Rong's death in 530, Gao Huan overthrew Erzhu's family and became northern wei's paramount general, and after northern wei divided into eastern wei and western wei in 534 became the actual power controlling eastern wei. Gao Yang thus grew up in a household of power. In 535, he was created the Duke of Taiyuan.\n\nGao Yang was not well regarded as a child, as he was awkward in interpersonal skills and at times considered developmentally disabled, being unable to carry out many tasks common for children. However, it appeared that he was actually of fairly high capability in many areas, and once, when Gao Huan tried to test his children's intelligence by giving them tangled balls of yarn to untangle, Gao Yang took out his sword and sliced the ball open, stating that that was the only solution. As Gao Huan's sons grew older, on one occasion, Gao Huan wanted to test their military abilities by having his general Peng Le (\u5f6d\u6a02) launch a mock attack on them. All of Gao Huan's sons, including the older Gao Cheng, were fearful, but Gao Yang reacted calmly and actually captured Peng. As he grew, he continued to be awkward and appearing to be unintelligent, and Gao Cheng, in particular, often looked down on him.\n\nGao Huan died in 547, and thereafter, Gao Cheng, who had already controlled many aspects of eastern wei imperial government's operations, took over as regent. He moved to consolidate his power further, and when Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei tried to form a plot to kill him, he discovered the plot and put Emperor Xiaojing under effective house arrest. He then planned taking the throne himself, but at a meeting in 549 at the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan, Hebei ), with his officials Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212), and Yang Yin, to discuss the procedure for doing so, he was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac), who was angry at his wrongful treatment. At that time, Gao Yang happened to be in Yecheng, and he quickly gathered the guards and killed Lan and his co-conspirators. He chose not to announce Gao Cheng's death immediately, while moving to consolidate power.\n\n\n\nAs Eastern Wei regent Initially, Emperor Xiaojing, who had received rumors that Gao Cheng had died, thought he might have a chance to regain power. However, upon meeting Gao Yang, who made a display of force by having more than 200 guards accompany him, Emperor Xiaojing saw that Gao Yang could not be easily dealt with. Meanwhile, Gao Yang headed for the Gaos' stronghold of Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi ), and consolidated his military command there, quickly impressing the generals who had previously looked down on him with quick and careful decisions.\n\nIn fall and winter 549, with rival liang dynasty under internal turmoil after the rebellion of Hou Jing (a former eastern wei general who had defected to Liang in 547), Gao Yang sent Peng Le to attack the Liang border provinces, taking over the region between the Huai River and Yangtze River with ease.\n\nIn spring 550, Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing convey on him the greater title of Prince of Qi Commandery. Two months later, his title was made the even greater title of Prince of Qi.\n\nIn summer 550, under advice from the officials Gao Dezheng (\u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f), Xu Zhicai (\u5f90\u4e4b\u624d), and Song Jingye (\u5b8b\u666f\u696d), Gao Yang decided to take the throne, despite reservations from Gao Yang's mother Princess Dowager Lou. He therefore headed from Jinyang to Yecheng, but even as he was on the way and had reached the halfway city of Pingdu (\u5e73\u90fd, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi ), the officials largely pretended to ignore his overtures at taking the throne, so he returned to Jinyang. Soon thereafter, he had Emperor Xiaojing issue an edict conferring the nine bestowments on him, further displaying his posture of taking the throne. He then proceeded to Yecheng again, and Emperor Xiaojing yielded the throne to him, ending eastern wei and establishing northern qi, with Gao Yang as its Emperor Wenxuan. He created the former Emperor Xiaojing the Prince of Zhongshan. He posthumously honored Gao Huan and Gao Cheng as emperors, while honoring his mother as empress dowager.\n\n\n\nEarly reign Early in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for being attentive to important matters of state, particularly military matters. He revised eastern wei laws, and he selected elite soldiers from both Xianbei and Han ethnicities to form the border defense corps. To equalize the tax and labor burden, he divided the households under his rule into nine classes based on their wealth, requiring the wealthy to pay more taxes and the poor to contribute more labor. Continuing a trend set by both his father Gao Huan and his brother Gao Cheng, he divided his time between Yecheng and Jinyang, effectively making Jinyang a second capital.\n\nWhile Emperor Wenxuan was ethnically Han, like his father Gao Huan, he viewed himself as Xianbei rather than Han. Further, more than his father did, he looked down on Han traditions, not willing to follow them. Because of this, Gao Dezheng and another official, Gao Longzhi (\u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b), who wanted to ingratiate themselves with Emperor Wenxuan's cousin and powerful general Duan Shao (\u6bb5\u97f6), suggested he make Duan Shao's sister Lady Duan, a concubine of his, empress. Emperor Wenxuan did not follow their advice and, pursuant to expected norm, created his wife Princess Li Zu'e empress and created her son Gao Yin crown prince.\n\nIn response to the establishment of northern qi, Yuwen Tai, the paramount general of rival western wei, launched a major attack on northern qi. Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops to defend against Yuwen's attack. When Yuwen saw that Emperor Wenxuan's troops were well-organized, he sighed and stated, \"Gao Huan is not yet dead. \" He was unable to overcome Emperor Wenxuan's defense and so was forced to withdraw, and in fact lost some border commanderies to northern qi in the campaign.\n\nAround the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan wanted to put the former emperor, the Prince of Zhongshan, to death. He first invited his sister and the prince's wife, the Princess Taiyuan, to a feast. As soon as she left the prince's household, he sent assassins to force the prince to drink poison, and also killed his three sons. He buried the former emperor with imperial honors, but at a later point, for reasons unknown, he dug out the former emperor's casket and threw it into the Zhang River (\u6f33\u6c34, flowing near Yecheng).\n\nIn spring 552, Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops against the Kumo Xi tribe (in the upper Liao River drainage area) and achieved a great victory. Around the same time, he also sent generals to seize certain border cities with Liang, as Liang troops continued to battle Hou Jing, who declared himself the Emperor of Han in 551 but was subsequently defeated by Emperor Yuan of Liang in 552. The campaigns of seizing Liang cities continued even after Hou's defeat, although he did not at this point launch a single major attack on Liang. The campaigns appeared to end in winter 552, and Emperor Wenxuan in fact promised the Liang generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian, whom Emperor Yuan put in charge of the eastern half of Liang territory, to return the cities of Guangling (\u5ee3\u9675, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu ) and Liyang (\u6b77\u967d, in modern Chaohu, Anhui ).\n\nAlso in winter 552, Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops from Jinyang to Lishi (\u96e2\u77f3, in modern L\u00fcliang, Shanxi ), and he ordered the construction of a Great Wall from Huanglu Mountain (\u9ec3\u6ae8\u5dba, also in modern L\u00fcliang) to Sheping Fortress (\u793e\u5e73\u620d, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi ), apparently to defend against western wei and Tujue.\n\nIn winter 553, Khitan tribes were attacking northern qi's northern borders, and Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops to attack Khitan\u2014and on this campaign, he was described as personally exposing himself to the dangers and contributing much personally to defeating the Khitan.\n\nAlso in winter 553, Emperor Wenxuan, wanting to put northern qi-friendly emperor on the Liang throne, commissioned an army commanded by Guo yuanjian (\u90ed\u5143\u5efa) to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Tui (\u856d\u9000), who had surrendered to eastern wei in 548, back to Liang territory. However, northern qi forces were defeated by the Liang general Hou Tian (\u4faf\u7471), and Xiao Tui returned to Yecheng.\n\nAround the new year 554, the remnants of Rouran, which by that point was near its end, surrendered to northern qi to seek protection from Tujue attacks. Emperor Wenxuan personally attacked the Tujue, fighting its army off, and then created Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen as the new khan of Rouran, settling the Rouran people within northern qi territory, at Mayi (\u99ac\u9091, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi ).\n\nIn spring 554, Emperor Wenxuan, assisted by the senior general Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1) and his brother Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, launched a major attack on the Shanhu (\u5c71\u80e1) tribe (in modern L\u00fcliang). After victory, he ordered that all 11-year-old and older males of the Shanhu be slaughtered, and that the females and the young males be awarded as spoils of war to the soldiers. When one of his commanders died because that commander's lieutenant, Lu Huili (\u8def\u6689\u79ae), was unable to save him, Emperor Wenxuan ordered that Lu's internal organs be cut out of his body and that the soldiers consume them. Many traditional historians, including Li Yanshou (\u674e\u5ef6\u58fd), the author of the History of Northern Dynasties, and Sima Guang, the author of the Zizhi Tongjian, saw this battle as the turning point of Emperor Wenxuan's rule\u2014that thereafter, he began to act violently and capriciously. For example, in spring 554, when Rouran rebelled and he personally led troops to defeat Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen, he felt that warhorses offered by the general Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) the Prince of Anding were not of sufficient quality\u2014and he punished Heba by plucking out Heba's hair and demoting to commoner status, and further ordering Heba to serve as a worker in a coal processing facility. In another example, in fall 554, after he had put the official Yuan Xu (\u5143\u65ed), a former northern wei prince, to death, he remembered the snubs that Gao Longzhi, who was a friend of Yuan Xu's, had shown him before he became eastern wei's regent, and he had Gao Longzhi battered so severely that Gao Longzhi died several days later\u2014and at a later point, still angry at Gao Longzhi, arrested Gao Longzhi's 20 sons and, with 20 executioners lined up, had the sons beheaded simultaneously, and then threw their bodies and Gao Longzhi's body thrown into the Zhang River.\n\nStarting in 551, Emperor Wenxuan had ordered his official Wei Shou to compile a history of northern wei. Wei Shou completed the work in 554, but his work (Book of Wei) was criticized by many to be defamatory to ancestors of many political enemies (so much so that they referred to the work as Huishu (\u7a62\u66f8\u2014the Book of Filth)), and several officials filed reports condemning Wei Shou. Wei Shou submitted a petition to Emperor Wenxuan defending himself, and Emperor Wenxuan, in an act that he believed to be protecting the integrity of history, jailed the officials who condemned Wei Shou.\n\nIn late 554, western wei launched a major attack on Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei ), then the capital of Liang. Emperor Wenxuan commissioned an army commanded by Gao Huan's cousin Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3) the Prince of Qinghe to attack western wei's An Province (\u5b89\u5dde, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei ) to try to relieve pressure from Jiangling, but by the time that Gao Yue arrived, Jiangling had already fallen, and western wei captured and then executed Emperor Yuan.\n\n\n\nLate reign western wei declared Emperor Yuan's nephew Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang, but the declaration was not recognized by most Liang generals, and the chief of those generals, Wang Sengbian, welcomed Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an to the old Liang capital Jiankang, declaring him the Prince of Liang in spring 555 and preparing to make him emperor. Emperor Wenxuan had other ideas, however, and he created Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, whom eastern wei captured in 547 during Liang's attempt to aid Hou Jing's rebellion against eastern wei, emperor, commissioning his brother Gao Hu\u00e0n (\u9ad8\u6e19, note tone difference with his father) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Xiao Yuanming back to Liang territory. Emperor Wenxuan wrote letters to Wang recommending Xiao Yuanming as emperor, arguing that Xiao Fangzhi (who was 12 years old) was too young. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after Gao Huan won a few battles over Wang's generals, Wang decided to submit and, after northern qi escorting troops agreed to limit their presence to 1,000 men, and Xiao Yuanming agreed to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince, accepted Xiao Yuanming as emperor. To show his good faith, Wang sent his son Wang Xian (\u738b\u986f) and nephew Wang Shizhen (\u738b\u4e16\u73cd), as well as Wang Xian's mother Lady Liu, to Yecheng as hostages. Xiao Yuanming became Liang's emperor, and there was peace between northern qi and Liang, with Liang now a vassal.\n\nJust four months later, however, the situation changed. Wang Sengbian's lieutenant Chen Baxian, displeased over Xiao Yuanming's ascension (as he saw Xiao Yuanming's claim as being too attenuated), make a surprise attack on Jiankang from his headquarters of Jingkou (\u4eac\u53e3, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu ), killing Wang Sengbian and forcing Xiao Yuanming to yield the throne to Xiao Fangzhi (who took the throne as Emperor Jing). Initially, Chen claimed that Liang would still agree to be a vassal, and Emperor Wenxuan sent the official Sima Gong (\u53f8\u99ac\u606d) to swear an oath with Liang officials. However, with several generals loyal to Wang Sengbian rising against Chen following Wang's death, Emperor Wenxuan's mind changed, particularly after two, Xu Sihui (\u5f90\u55e3\u5fbd) and Ren Yue (\u4efb\u7d04) submitted to him, making a surprise attack on the near-Jiankang fortress Shitou and capturing it. Emperor Wenxuan sent the general Xiao Gui (\u856d\u8ecc) to reinforce Xu and Ren. Chen defeated northern qi troops and Xu and Ren, however, and Xiao Gui's assistant Liu Damo (\u67f3\u9054\u6469), sieged by Chen in Shitou, sought peace. Chen agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (\u9673\u66c7\u6717), Emperor Jing's nephew Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (\u738b\u73c9), the son of the key official Wang Chong (\u738b\u6c96), to serve as hostages to northern qi, allowing Liu to withdraw. (Upon Liu's return to northern qi, however, Emperor Wenxuan had him executed. )\n\nDuring the campaign against Liang, Emperor Wenxuan made another display of his increasing instability, as he, jealous over the fact that his concubine Consort Xue had previously had a sexual relationship with Gao Yue, ordered Gao Yue to commit suicide. Thereafter, he beheaded Consort Xue and hid her head in his sleeves. At a banquet later that day, he tossed her head onto a platter and cut her body into pieces, beginning to play with her leg, surprising all of the banquet attendants. At the end of the banquet, he packed her body parts and began crying, following the cart carrying her body on foot.\n\nIn fall 555, Emperor Wenxuan became convinced that Buddhism and Taoism should be but one religion, and that one of them should be merged into the other. He had the leading Buddhist and Taoist monks debate before him, and he declared the Buddhists the victors, ordering Taoism merged into Buddhism and Taoist monks to become Buddhist monks. Some Taoist monks initially rejected this edict, but after he executed four monks, the others submitted, and Taoism became banned within northern qi.\n\nIn spring 556, border battles between northern qi and Liang resumed, and northern qi prepared another campaign against Liang. In summer 556, northern qi forces were again south of the Yangtze, operating in Jiankang's vicinity, but they were stalemated against Liang troops, eventually defeated by Chen and his generals after they ran out of food. A number of northern wei generals were captured and executed by Liang, and in response, Emperor Wenxuan put Chen Tanlang to death.\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's erratic behavior became even greater in scope, fueled by his alcoholism. As described by Sima Guang in his Zizhi Tongjian: . . . [Emperor Wenxuan] drank heavily and lived immorality, carrying out cruel and barbarous act at his on whim. Sometimes he sang and danced day and night. Sometimes he spread his hair and wore barbarian clothing with colorful sashes. Sometimes he bared his body and put on makeup. Sometimes he rode donkeys, cows, camels, or elephants without using saddles. Sometimes he ordered Cui Jishu or Liu Taozhi (\u5289\u6843\u679d) to carry him and a large drum to allow him to beat the drums. He was accustomed to making surprise charges into the nobles' and imperial officials' private residences. He often crossed streets, sometimes sitting in the streets and sometimes even sleeping on them. Sometimes when it is warm, he would be naked to bask in the sun, but even in the coldest winter, he would strip naked as well and run around. His attendants could not stand his behavior, but he himself did not care. . . . Once, he asked a woman on the street, \"How is the Son of Heaven like?\" The woman responded, \"He is so crazy that he really cannot be considered a Son of Heaven. \" He beheaded her.\n\nOnce, when he was drunk and acting irrationally, Empress Dowager Lou rebuked him, and he threatened to marry her to an old barbarian. When she became angry, he became fearful, and he wanted to induce her to smile again, so he crawled on the ground under her seat, but in doing so, he flipped the seat over, and she was injured. After he sobered up, he realized how he had been injured, and he set a large fire, intending to jump in to die, causing her to have to grab him to save him. He thereafter pledged not to drink any more, but was only able to do so for 10 days before he began drinking again. He also once shot an arrow at Empress Li's mother Lady Cui and whipped her. Further, it was described that most women of the imperial Gao clan were forced to have sexual relations with him at one point or another. When Gao Huan's concubine Erzhu Ying'e, the Princess Dowager of Pengcheng, refused, he killed her with his own hands. Emperor Wenxuan also became homicidal when he drank, and he always wanted to kill people when he was drunk. Yang Yin, who was prime minister at this point, therefore set up a group of condemned prisoners to be available to the palace guards\u2014if Emperor Wenxuan wanted to kill someone, a condemned prisoner would be brought out for him to kill, and if a prisoner was able to survive for three months without being killed, he would be set free.\n\nHowever, even in his erratic behavior, Emperor Wenxuan was still attentive to many important matters, and because of his harshness, his officials did not dare to be corrupt. Further, Yang was a capable prime minister, and Emperor Wenxuan gave him full authorization to carry out laws properly. Therefore, it was said at the time that while the emperor was violent and insane, the government was nevertheless efficient.\n\nIn winter 557, believing prophecies that Gao Hu\u00e0n would be emperor, he ordered Gao Hu\u00e0n arrested. Gao Hu\u00e0n tried to resist, but was nevertheless captured and delivered to Yecheng. When another brother, Gao Jun (\u9ad8\u6d5a) the prince of Yong'an, sent petitions urging him to change his behavior, he had Gao Jun arrested as well, and the two princes were imprisoned in a dungeon.\n\nAlso in winter 557, Chen Baxian had Liang's Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing chen dynasty, and subsequently had Emperor Jing killed in 558. The general Wang Lin, then in control of modern Hunan and eastern Hubei , refused to submit to Chen and sought to continue Liang's lineage. He therefore requested northern qi to return Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia to be emperor. In spring 558, northern qi troops escorted Xiao Zhuang to Wang's territory, and Wang declared Xiao Zhuang emperor, as a northern qi vassal, with his capital at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan, Hubei ).\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's military campaigns and other wasteful behavior had caused the imperial treasury to be drained. He had also become unhappy with his son Gao Yin, believing that Gao Yin was too Han-like in behavior, and he considered deposing Gao Yin. Once, he ordered Gao Yin to personally execute a prisoner, but Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and Emperor Wenxuan battered him with a whip handle, causing Gao Yin to thereafter have a panic disorder and at times unable to speak. When Emperor Wenxuan became drunk, he would often state that he might eventually pass the throne to his brother Gao Yan, and he stopped stating as such only after urging by Yang and Wei Shou, who believed that his words were causing an unstabling effect in causing a doubt as to who would succeed him.\n\nAround the new year 559, Emperor Wenxuan visited the imprisoned Gao Jun and Gao Hu\u00e0n. He initially took pity on them and considered releasing them, but, at the urging of another brother, Gao Dan the Prince of Changguang, did not do so, and further started to pierce them with spears. He also ordered that torches be thrown at them, burning them to death. He rewarded the princes' wives to the soldiers who delivered the death blows.\n\nIn summer 559, Emperor Wenxuan, suspecting that the members of the northern wei imperial Yuan clan would eventually try to return to power, ordered the Yuans to be slaughtered, regardless of age or gender, and had the bodies thrown into the Zhang River. Only several households who were particularly close to the Gaos were spared.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne. \" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei. The officials tried to mourn at his death, but no one was actually able to shed a tear other than Yang Yin.\n\n"}, {"url": "http://worldheritage.org/articles/Emperor_Wenxuan_of_Northern_Qi", "page_content": "World Heritage Encyclopedia\n\nThe World Heritage Encyclopedia is the largest and most comprehensive Encyclopedia ever compiled.

known for being attentive to important matters of state, particularly military matters. He revised Eastern Wei laws, and he selected elite soldiers from both Xianbei and Han ethnicities to form the border defense corps. To equalize the tax and labor burden, he divided the households under his rule into nine classes based on their wealth, requiring the wealthy to pay more taxes and the poor to contribute more labor. Continuing a trend set by both his father Gao Huan and his brother Gao Cheng, he divided his time between Yecheng and Jinyang, effectively making Jinyang a second capital.\n\nWhile Emperor Wenxuan was ethnically Han, like his father Gao Huan, he viewed himself as Xianbei rather than Han. Further, more than his father did, he looked down on Han traditions, not willing to follow them. Because of this, Gao Dezheng and another official, Gao Longzhi (\u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b), who wanted to ingratiate themselves with Emperor Wenxuan's cousin and powerful general Duan Shao (\u6bb5\u97f6), suggested he make Duan Shao's sister Lady Duan, a concubine of his, empress. Emperor Wenxuan did not follow their advice and, pursuant to expected norm, created his wife Princess Li Zu'e empress and created her son Gao Yin crown prince.\n\nIn response to the establishment of Northern Qi, Yuwen Tai, the paramount general of rival Western Wei, launched a major attack on Northern Qi. Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops to defend against Yuwen's attack. When Yuwen saw that Emperor Wenxuan's troops were well-organized, he sighed and stated, \"Gao Huan is not yet dead.\" He was unable to overcome Emperor Wenxuan's defense and so was forced to withdraw, and in fact lost some border commanderies to Northern Qi in the campaign.\n\nAround the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan wanted to put the former emperor, the Prince of Zhongshan, to death. He first invited his sister and the prince's wife, the Princess Taiyuan, to a feast. As soon as she left the prince's household, he sent assassins to force the prince to drink poison, and also killed his three sons. He buried the former emperor with imperial honors, but at a later point, for reasons unknown, he dug out the former emperor's casket and threw it into the Zhang River (\u6f33\u6c34, flowing near Yecheng).\n\nIn spring 552, Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops against the Kumo Xi tribe (in the upper Liao River drainage area) and achieved a great victory. Around the same time, he also sent generals to seize certain border cities with Liang, as Liang troops continued to battle Hou Jing, who declared himself the Emperor of Han in 551 but was subsequently defeated by Emperor Yuan of Liang in 552. The campaigns of seizing Liang cities continued even after Hou's defeat, although he did not at this point launch a single major attack on Liang. The campaigns appeared to end in winter 552, and Emperor Wenxuan in fact promised the Liang generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian, whom Emperor Yuan put in charge of the eastern half of Liang territory, to return the cities of Guangling (\u5ee3\u9675, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) and Liyang (\u6b77\u967d, in modern Chaohu, Anhui).\n\nAlso in winter 552, Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops from Jinyang to Lishi (\u96e2\u77f3, in modern L\u00fcliang, Shanxi), and he ordered the construction of a great wall from Huanglu Mountain (\u9ec3\u6ae8\u5dba, also in modern L\u00fcliang) to Sheping Fortress (\u793e\u5e73\u620d, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi), apparently to defend against Western Wei and Tujue.\n\nIn winter 553, Khitan tribes were attacking Northern Qi's northern borders, and Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops to attack Khitan\u2014and on this campaign, he was described as personally exposing himself to the dangers and contributing much personally to defeating the Khitan.\n\nAlso in winter 553, Emperor Wenxuan, wanting to put Northern Qi-friendly emperor on the Liang throne, commissioned an army commanded by Guo yuanjian (\u90ed\u5143\u5efa) to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Tui (\u856d\u9000), who had surrendered to Eastern Wei in 548, back to Liang territory. However, Northern Qi forces were defeated by the Liang general Hou Tian (\u4faf\u7471), and Xiao Tui returned to Yecheng.\n\nAround the new year 554, the remnants of Rouran, which by that point was near its end, surrendered to Northern Qi to seek protection from Tujue attacks. Emperor Wenxuan personally attacked the Tujue, fighting its army off, and then created Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen as the new khan of Rouran, settling the Rouran people within Northern Qi territory, at Mayi (\u99ac\u9091, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi).\n\nIn spring 554, Emperor Wenxuan, assisted by the senior general Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1) and his brother Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, launched a major attack on the Shanhu (\u5c71\u80e1) tribe (in modern L\u00fcliang). After victory, he ordered that all 11-year-old and older males of the Shanhu be slaughtered, and that the females and the young males be awarded as spoils of war to the soldiers. When one of his commanders died because that commander's lieutenant, Lu Huili (\u8def\u6689\u79ae), was unable to save him, Emperor Wenxuan ordered that Lu's internal organs be cut out of his body and that the soldiers consume them. Many traditional historians, including Li Yanshou (\u674e\u5ef6\u58fd), the author of the History of Northern Dynasties, and Sima Guang, the author of the Zizhi Tongjian, saw this battle as the turning point of Emperor Wenxuan's rule\u2014that thereafter, he began to act violently and capriciously. For example, in spring 554, when Rouran rebelled and he personally led troops to defeat Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen, he felt that warhorses offered by the general Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) the Prince of Anding were not of sufficient quality\u2014and he punished Heba by plucking out Heba's hair and demoting to commoner status, and further ordering Heba to serve as a worker in a coal processing facility. In another example, in fall 554, after he had put the official Yuan Xu (\u5143\u65ed), a former Northern Wei prince, to death, he remembered the snubs that Gao Longzhi, who was a friend of Yuan Xu's, had shown him before he became Eastern Wei's regent, and he had Gao Longzhi battered so severely that Gao Longzhi died several days later\u2014and at a later point, still angry at Gao Longzhi, arrested Gao Longzhi's 20 sons and, with 20 executioners lined up, had the sons beheaded simultaneously, and then threw their bodies and Gao Longzhi's body thrown into the Zhang River.\n\nStarting in 551, Emperor Wenxuan had ordered his official Wei Shou to compile a history of Northern Wei. Wei Shou completed the work in 554, but his work (Book of Wei) was criticized by many to be defamatory to ancestors of many political enemies (so much so that they referred to the work as Huishu (\u7a62\u66f8\u2014the Book of Filth)), and several officials filed reports condemning Wei Shou. Wei Shou submitted a petition to Emperor Wenxuan defending himself, and Emperor Wenxuan, in an act that he believed to be protecting the integrity of history, jailed the officials who condemned Wei Shou.\n\nIn late 554, Western Wei launched a major attack on Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), then the capital of Liang. Emperor Wenxuan commissioned an army commanded by Gao Huan's cousin Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3) the Prince of Qinghe to attack Western Wei's An Province (\u5b89\u5dde, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei) to try to relieve pressure from Jiangling, but by the time that Gao Yue arrived, Jiangling had already fallen, and Western Wei captured and then executed Emperor Yuan."}, {"url": "http://www.china.org.cn/top10/2011-09/02/content_23343011.htm", "page_content": "Adjust font size:\n\nIn ancient China, the emperor, believed to be the son of heaven, enjoyed the supreme power to rule the whole nation. How they performed decided the fate of the nation and people.\n\nOver five thousand years of history, China has witnessed 67 dynasties with 446 emperors. Of them, some were remembered by their people as great and brilliant leaders, some ordinary and just so-so, while a few too many so notorious, leaving their mark in history for being so incapable, fatuous, self-indulgent and dreadful.\n\nHere, China.org.cn presents the top ten most fatuous and insane emperors in ancient China.\n\nGao Yang \u5317\u9f50\u6587\u5ba3\u5e1d\u9ad8\u6d0b\n\nGao Yang (529-559), Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi, was the first emperor of Northern Qi during the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420-589). In his early years as emperor, he was loved for taking effective measures to enhance the military and political strengths and improve people's lives by reducing their tax burden. Due to his great efforts, Northern Qi became a strong power in a very short period of time. However, several years late, Gao became self-contended and arrogant, indulging his depraved desires for wine and women. Alcoholism not only dragged his state into chaos, but led to his death in 559.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mad emperor had an illicit relationship with Consort Xue's sister, but beheaded her after getting drunk one night. The next day, he took her head and brandished it at a feast, making all officials horrified. His Prime Minister Yan Yin even prepared a group of prisoners, so that Gao could kill someone conveniently as he desired after drinking.\n\nIt's more shocking that many of the women in the imperial Gao clan were ordered to have sex with Gao and his attendants in the palace, where he even killed a concubine mother who refused his request. When drunk, he couldn't even recognize Empress Dowager Lou. One day, as he was scolded by Lou for drinking again, he threatened to marry her to a barbarian.\n\nFollow China.org.cn on Twitter and Facebook to join the conversation.\n\nChinaNews App Download"}, {"url": "http://www.chinaknowledge.de/Literature/Poetry/wenxuan.html", "page_content": "Jul 3, 2010 \u00a9 Ulrich Theobald\n\nWenxuan \u6587\u9078 \"Selected literature\" is a literary anthology compiled during the Liang period \u6881 (502-557) by Xiao Tong \u856d\u7d71 (501-531), Prince Zhaoming \u662d\u660e\u592a\u5b50. The book is therefore also called Zhaoming Wenxuan \u662d\u660e\u6587\u9078.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Liang period was a time when literature flourished. This apogee had been prepared since the Jian'an reign-period \u5efa\u5b89 (196-219) of the late Han era \u6f22 (206 BCE-220 CE). For the coming two centuries writers refined literary styles and developed new genres. The amount of literature produced between the 3rd and the 6th centuries was tremendous. During the Sui period \u968b (581-618) the imperial library (see the bibliography Jingji zhi \u7d93\u7c4d\u5fd7) included no less than 249 collections with a total size of 5,224 juan. There were also first attempts to think about literary theory during the Liu-Song period \u5289\u5b8b (420-479) when scholars of the state-sponsored faculties of Confucianism, Daoism, literature, historiography and mantic arts tried to standardize the writings in their respective fields. During the Jin period \u6649 (265-420), there were the literary anthologies Wenzhang liubie ji \u6587\u7ae0\u6d41\u522b\u96c6 by Zhi Yu \u646f\u865e (d. 311) and Hanlinlun \u7ff0\u6797\u8ad6 by Li Chong \u674e\u5145 (c. 400). The famous writer Liu Yiqing \u5289\u7fa9\u6176 (403-444) compiled the literary anthology Jilin \u96c6\u6797. All three books are unfortunately lost. Xiao Tong's Wenxuan is the oldest surviving anthology of fine literature.\n\nCompilation process\n\nXiao Tong gathered many excellent writers at his court with which he regularly conferred about literary theory and the ideal forms of writing. He disposed of a large library of almost 30,000 juan. The Prince himself was also an ardent writer, and his collected writings have a size of 20 juan, not including his commentaries and prefaces to other texts, with a volume of 10 fascicles. His anthology of five-syllable poems, for instance, is a book of 20 (or 19) juan called Wenzhang yinghua \u6587\u7ae0\u82f1\u83ef (also called Gujin shiyuan yinghua \u53e4\u4eca\u8a69\u82d1\u82f1\u83ef). The anthology Wenxuan has a size of 30 juan. It is possible that Wenzhang yinghua or Gujin shiyuan yinghua were just alternative titles of the Wenxuan (or a draft of it) because there is otherwise no testimony of these books, and they were \"lost\" before the Sui period. Xiao Tong was certainly not the only compiler of the Wenxuan, but it must be assumed that he selected the texts together with his retainers, among which persons are found that are also famous for commenting works on literature works, like Liu Xiaochuo \u5289\u5b5d\u7dbd (d. 539), Wang Yun \u738b\u7b60 (fl. 531), Yin Yun \u6bb7\u82b8 (471-529), Lu Chui \u9678\u5015 (470-526), Dao Qia \u5230\u6d3d (477-527) or Liu Xie \u5289\u52f0 (b. c. 465), author of the literary critique Wenxin diaolong \u6587\u5fc3\u96d5\u9f99.\n\nContent\n\nIn 30 juan the Wenxuan includes 514 writings of 130 authors from earliest times down to the very early Liang period. The writings are arranged in 38 genres, beginning with rhapsodies (fu \u8ce6) and the highly estimated genres of regular poems (shi \u8a69) and then going on to many categories of \"miscellaneous writings\" (zawen \u96dc\u6587; a more common term would be sanwen \u6563\u6587 \"prose\"). Below the level of genres or sub-genres, the writings are arranged chronologically. Poems and rhapsodies cover the largest part of the book. Because of their great amount the rhapsodies are therefore divided into 15 sub-categories, referring to places (the capital, palaces) or imperial activities, like offering, hunting, ploughing, etc. The many regular poems are likewise divided into 23 subgroups. The literary categories of the Wenxuan are very detailed, and the development of these presents a thorough new picture of how belles-lettres could be arranged in various types of writings, which was never done before.\n\nXiao Tong and his team only selected literary works and did not include any parts from the Confucian Classics, historiographical texts, or texts from the famous Warring-States-period \u6230\u570b (5th cent.-221 BCE) philosophers. Literary comments to such books (zanlun \u8d0a\u8ad6), nevertheless, were included in the Wenxuan. The criterion thus was literary beauty, well-tasted wording, composition of regular sentences, and an overall harmony. Later scholars often criticized Xiao Tong for including obscure (Tao Yuanming \u9676\u6df5\u660e, c. 365-427) or less important (Gushi shijiu shou \u53e4\u8a69\u5341\u4e5d\u9996) poems while omitting other, more important works. Some of the pieces included have later been found to be forgeries, like Li Ling's \u674e\u9675 (d. 74 BCE) Da Su Wu shu \u7b54\u8607\u6b66\u66f8 or Kong Anguo's \u5b54\u5b89\u570b (2nd cent. BCE) Shangshu xu \u5c1a\u66f8\u5e8f.\n\nSome paragraphs entitled as \"preface\" (xu \u5e8f) are not really prefaces, like Emperor Han Wudi's \u6f22\u6b66\u5e1d (r. 141-87 BCE) Qiufeng ci \u79cb\u98a8\u8fad, and some titles have nothing to to with the content, like Liu Jun's \u5289\u5cfb (463\u2014521) Chong da Liu Moling zhao shu \u91cd\u7b54\u5289\u79e3\u9675\u8a54\u66f8. There are also many clerical errors in the transmitted text of the Wenxuan.\n\nTable 1.

The study of the Wenxuan even developed into an own discipline (wenxuanxue \u6587\u9078\u5b78). The enormous development of the regular poem during the Tang period \u5510 (618-907) cannot be understood without the important study of Xiao Tong in this field. The ability to write poems became part of the state examinations, and this must be led back to the importance Xiao Tong posed on this type of literature. A profoundly educated scholar had to study the Wenxuan.\n\nCommentaries\n\nScholars also commented on the Wenxuan. Of the circa 90 commentaries from the Sui and Tang periods only very few have survived. The oldest commentary was written by Xiao Gai \u856d\u8a72 (c. 535-c. 610) during the Sui period, called Wenxuan yinyi \u6587\u9078\u97f3\u7fa9. A phonetic commentary with the same title was written during the early Tang by Cao Xian \u66f9\u61b2 (541-645). Both are lost. The oldest surviving \u2013 and most famous \u2013 commentary is Li Shan's \u674e\u5584 (630-689) Wenxuan zhu \u6587\u9078\u6ce8. In a lot of modern editions, this commentary is integrated into the main text of the Wenxuan. Li Shan's commentary is of extraordinary quality. Li used more then 1,700 books to revise and explain the difficult texts of the writings included in the Wenxuan. The Wenxuan zhu was submitted to the throne in 658. In general, Li's texts is rather a critical commentary than an explanation of the literary works. It makes use of and quotes from a lot of older commentaries to the particular writings, for instance, Xue Zong's \u859b\u7d9c (208-243) commentary on the rhapsody Erjing fu \u4e8c\u4eac\u8ce6 of Zhang Heng \u5f35\u8861 (78-139), or Wang Yi's \u738b\u9038 (c. 110 CE) commentary on Qu Yuan's \u5c48\u539f (c. 343-c. 278 BCE) elegies. Another book of Li Shan on the Wenxuan, the Wenxuan bianhuo \u6587\u9078\u8fa8\u60d1, is lost.\n\nAnother important Tang period commentary to the Wenxuan is the Wuchen zhu Wenxuan \u4e94\u81e3\u6ce8\u6587\u9078 \"Commentaries of the Five Masters\" from 718, a compound edition of commentaries by five persons, namely L\u00fc Yanji \u5442\u5ef6\u6fdf, Liu Liang \u5289\u826f, Zhang Xi \u5f35\u9291, L\u00fc Xiang \u5442\u5411 and Li Zhouhan \u674e\u5468\u7ff0. This commentary is rated as of a minor quality if compared to Li Shan's commentary. During the Song period \u5b8b (960-1279) the five commentaries and Li Shan's commentary were put together as Liuchen zhu \u516d\u81e3\u6ce8. Later scholars again distilled out Li Shan's book. Most modern publications containing Li Shan's commentary are based on these extractions. There is another Tang-period commentary written by an unknown master, the Wenxuan jizhu \u6587\u9078\u96c6\u6ce8 surviving in a fragment of 23 juan. It quotes from the other commentaries, but also from the notes of Lu Shanjing \u9678\u5584\u7d93 and from the books Wenxuan chao \u6587\u9078\u9214 and Wenxuan yinjue \u6587\u9078\u97f3\u6c7a, which are both lost.\n\nDuring the Song period, the study of the Wenxuan declined. There were, nonetheless, a few specialized research tools written, like Wenxuan shuangzi leiyao \u6587\u9078\u96d9\u5b57\u985e\u8981 or Wenxuan leilin \u6587\u9078\u985e\u6797. Some few studies can also be found scattered in various Song-period essays.\n\nThe Song-period encyclopaedia Wenyuan yinghua \u6587\u82d1\u82f1\u83ef is often called a continuation of the Wenxuan. It is arranged in a similar style and largely copies the literary categories of the Wenxuan.\n\nThere is the Yuan-period \u5143 (1279-1368) commentary Xuanshi buzhu \u9078\u8a69\u88dc\u6ce8 written by Liu L\u00fc \u5289\u5c65 and the Ming-period \u660e (1368-1644) book Wenxuan zuanzhu \u6587\u9078\u7e82\u6ce8 by Zhang Fengyi \u5f35\u9cf3\u7ffc (1527-1613). The wave of textual critique developing during the Qing period \u6e05 (1644-1911) also embraced the Wenxuan studies, and a few books from that time have to be mentioned: Wang Shihan's \u6c6a\u5e2b\u97d3 (1707-1780) Wenxuan lixue quanyu \u6587\u9078\u7406\u5b78\u6b0a\u8f3f, Sun Zhizu's \u5b6b\u5fd7\u7956 (1737-1801) Wenxuan lixue quanyu bu \u6587\u9078\u7406\u5b78\u6b0a\u8f3f\u88dc, Hu Kejia's \u80e1\u514b\u5bb6 (1757-1816) Wenxuan kaoyi \u6587\u9078\u8003\u7570, Zhang Yun'ao's \u5f35\u96f2\u7488 (1747-1829) Xuanxue jiaoyan \u9078\u5b78\u80f6\u8a00, Liang Zhangju's \u6881\u7ae0\u9245 (1775-1849) Wenxuan pangzheng \u6587\u9078\u65c1\u8b49, Zhu Jian's \u6731\u73d4 (1769-1850) Wenxuan jishi \u6587\u9078\u96c6\u91cb, Hu Shaoying's \u80e1\u7d39\u745b (1791-1860) Wenxuan jianzheng \u6587\u9078\u7b8b\u8b49, Xu Xunxing's (fl. 1793) \u8a31\u5dfd\u884c Wenxuan biji \u6587\u9078\u7b46\u8a18, He Zhuo's \u4f55\u712f (1661-1722) Yimen du shuji \u7fa9\u9580\u8b80\u66f8\u8a18, Yu Guanghua's \u4e8e\u5149\u83ef (fl. 1781) Wenxuan jiping \u6587\u9078\u96c6\u8a55, Gao Buying's \u9ad8\u6b65\u701b (1873-1940) Wenxuan Li zhu yishu \u6587\u9078\u674e\u6ce8\u7fa9\u758f and Luo Hongkai's \u99f1\u9e3f\u51f1 (1892-1955) Wenxuanxue \u6587\u9078\u5b78.\n\nVersions and editions\n\nThe oldest surviving versions of the Wenxuan are the above-mentioned Wenxuan jizhu from the Tang period, a plain text (without commentaries) from the Tang period, a version including Li Shan's commentary, and a phonetic commentary Wenxuan yin \u6587\u9078\u97f3. All have survived as fragments discovered in Dunhuang \u6566\u714c. Part of these fragments is included in the collections Mingshashishi guji congcan \u9cf4\u6c99\u77f3\u5ba4\u53e4\u7c4d\u53e2\u6b98 and Dunhuang miji liuzhen xinbian \u6566\u714c\u79d8\u7c4d\u7559\u771f\u65b0\u7de8. The oldest print of the Wenxuan was produced during the Northern Song period \u5317\u5b8b (960-1126). It is surviving as a facsimile edition in the series Sibu congkan \u56db\u90e8\u53e2\u520a, including the six commentaries. The Zhonghua Shuju Press \u4e2d\u83ef\u66f8\u5c40 has published a reprint of an edition from 1181 produced by You Mao \u5c24\u88a4 (1127-1194), including Li Shan's commentary. The most common version is the Qing-period print by Hu Kejia, based on You Mao's edition from the Song era. It has been republished in 1977 by the Zhonghua Shuju Press, enriched by a short critical study at the end.\n\nSupplements and sequels\n\nThe first sequel to the Wenxuan, called Wenxuan buyi \u6587\u9078\u88dc\u907a or Bu wenxuan \u88dc\u6587\u9078, was compiled by Chen Renzi \u9673\u4ec1\u5b50 (fl. 1279). The preface, written by Zhao Wen \u8d99\u6587, states that some types of texts found in the Wenxuan were not appropriate because of several political and philosophical reasons, namely Sima Changqing's \u53f8\u99ac\u9577\u537f (Sima Xiangru \u53f8\u99ac\u76f8\u5982, c. 179-117 BCE) Fengshan wen \u5c01\u79aa\u6587 on the sacrifices to Heaven and Earth, and Pan Yuanmao's \u6f58\u5143\u8302 (Pan Xun \u6f58\u52d6, d. 215\uff09Ce Wei Gong jiuxi wen \u518a\u9b4f\u516c\u4e5d\u932b\u6587 on the bestowal of the nine privileges to the warlord Cao Cao \u66f9\u64cd (155-220). Zhao also criticized that Prince Zhaoming had shortened Zhuge Liang's important memorial [Hou] chushi biao [\u5f8c]\u51fa\u5e2b\u8868. Zhao was also amazed that of the famous Nine Songs (Jiuge \u4e5d\u6b4c) of the Southern Elegies (Chuci \u695a\u8fad), only the text Shejiang \u6d89\u6c5f was accepted. He was furthermore critical to Prince Zhaoming\u2019s concept of the genre \"Treatises from the histories\" (shilun \u53f2\u8ad6), which should also extend to writings of the eminent historiographer Sima Qian \u53f8\u99ac\u9077 (c. 145-86 BCE).\n\nThe anthology of 40 juan length thus includes Sima Tan\u2019s \u53f8\u99ac\u8ac7 (190-110 BCE) Liujia yaozhi \u516d\u5bb6\u8981\u65e8 and Lu Zhonglian yi Yan jiang shu \u9b6f\u4ef2\u9023\u907a\u71d5\u5c07\u66f8, Liu Bang\u2019s \u5289\u90a6 (i.e. Han Gaozu \u6f22\u9ad8\u7956, r. 206-195 BCE) Honghu ge \u9d3b\u9d60\u6b4c, Yang Xiong\u2019s \u63da\u96c4 (53 BCE-18 CE) Fan Lisao \u53cd\u96e2\u9a37, Cai Yan\u2019s \u8521\u7430 (177-249) Hujia shiba pai \u80e1\u7b33\u5341\u516b\u62cd and the southern song Li Yannian ge \u674e\u5ef6\u5e74\u6b4c.\n\nThere exist several prints, namely the Dongshan Shuyuan \u6771\u5c71\u66f8\u9662 edition, a print from 1737, the version in the imperial series Siku quanshu \u56db\u5eab\u5168\u66f8, and a print from Hunan from 1826.\n\nDuring the Ming period, several supplements to Prince Zhaoming\u2019s Wenxuan were compiled. The oldest is Liu Jie\u2019s \u5289\u7bc0 (fl. 1520) Guang wenxuan \u5ee3\u6587\u9078. However, the authorship of Liu Jie cannot be substantiated because of several reasons. The preface (xu \u5e8f) speaks of a different size than the real book (60 juan), and might thus belong to a different collection. Moreover, the afterword (ba \u8dcb), written by Chen Hui \u9673\u8559 (jinshi degree 1529), criticizes the \"old version\" (jiu ben \u820a\u672c) of Liu Jie because of its many flaws, and states that Wang Zisong \u738b\u5b50\u677e, Lin Bi \u6797\u74a7, Zeng Chen \u66fe\u8fb0, and Li Shiyong \u674e\u4e16\u7528 revised this edition, eliminated some texts and added some others. It must thus be assumed that the Guang wenxuan was in fact edited by Chen Hui. Yet even after some revisions of Chen\u2019s team, the texts still includes many clerical errors and mistakes in the attribution of genres.\n\nAround 1600, Zhou Yingzhi \u5468\u61c9\u6cbb (1556-1621) compiled a further supplement, Guangguang wenxuan \u5ee3\u5ee3\u6587\u9078, with a length of 33 juan.\n\nA non-commentary supplement is Tang Shaozu\u2019s \u6e6f\u7d39\u7956 (fl. 1602) Xu wenxuan \u7e8c\u6587\u9078 from 1602. The book of 32 juan length assembles from the Tang period, and \u2013 strangely enough \u2013 the Ming period. Among the latter, most texts were written by the so-called \"Later Seven Masters\" (Houqizi \u5f8c\u4e03\u5b50), with the exception of Liu Ji \u5289\u57fa (1311-1375) and Gao Qi \u9ad8\u555f (1336-1373). The sub-categories of rhapsodies are fewer than in the original Wenxuan. The sections capital cities, suburban sacrifices, and ceremonial ploughing are not used, and the sub-category on Rivers and the Sea (Jianghai \u6c5f\u6d77) is changed to contain texts on \"Mountains and the sea\" (Shanhai \u5c71\u6d77). Quite surprising is the categorization of Lu Nanshou\u2019s \u76e7\u6960\u58fd rhapsody Chenggao wang fu \u6210\u768b\u738b\u8ce6 as a \"mind-text\" (zhi \u5fd7), and of Xu Zhenqing\u2019s \u5f90\u798e\u537f (1479-1511) Fanfan Lisao \u53cd\u53cd\u96e2\u9a37 as a \"treatise\" (lunwen \u8ad6\u6587).\n\nSun Kuang \u5b6b\u7926 (1542-1613) edited a \"modern\" Jin wenxuan \u4eca\u6587\u9078 with 12 fascicles. The last 5 fascicles are actually a supplement to the first seven, and therefore bear the headline Xuxuan \u7e8c\u9078. The anthology only includes texts of Ming-period writers.\n\nAnother \"modern\" collection was edited during the early Qing period by Chen Weisong \u9673\u7dad\u5d27 (1625-1682) and Pan Mei \u6f58\u7709 (fl. 1692). Even if the book has just a length of 8 juan, it includes several prefaces and a guideline (fanli \u51e1\u4f8b) summing up the principles of the compilation. The anthology includes writings of 75 person, many of whom had experienced difficulties and disasters (\"martyrs\", zhonglie \u5fe0\u70c8) in the last decades of the Ming period, like Xia Yunyi \u590f\u5141\u5f5d (1596-1645), Chen Zilong \u9673\u5b50\u9f8d (1608-1647), Jiang Dingrui \u6c5f\u9f0e\u745e (d. 1644), Zhao Erbian \u8d99\u800c\u6c74 (d. 1570), Wu Yingji \u5433\u61c9\u7b95 (1594-1645) or Zhou Lianggong \u5468\u4eae\u5de5 (1612-1672). Chen's anthology has therefore historiographical value. It was printed around 1648.\n\nLei Jin \u96f7\u7468 (1871-1941) edited another supplement called Xu wenxuan \u7e8c\u6587\u9078 with a length of 20 fascicles.

It contains some 8,000 life-sized terra-cotta soldiers and horse figures that formed an army to defend Shihuangdi\u2019s tomb.\n\nShihuangdi was emperor of the Qin dynasty (221\u2013210 BCE) and the creator of the first unified Chinese empire. He is also known for his interest in immortality, his huge funerary compound that contains some 8,000 life-sized terra-cotta soldiers, and for his contribution to the Great Wall of China .\n\nQin Shi Huang , also called Shihuangdi , Wade-Giles romanization Shih-huang-ti , personal name (xingming) Zhao Zheng or Ying Zheng , (born c. 259 bce, Qin state, northwestern China\u2014died 210 bce, Hebei), emperor (reigned 221\u2013210 bce) of the Qin dynasty (221\u2013207 bce) and creator of the first unified Chinese empire (which collapsed, however, less than four years after his death).\n\nUntil Zheng was officially declared of age in 238, his government was headed by L\u00fc Buwei. Zheng\u2019s first act as king was to execute his mother\u2019s lover, who had joined the opposition, and to exile L\u00fc, who had been involved in the affair. A decree ordering the expulsion of all aliens, which would have deprived the king of his most competent advisers, was annulled at the urging of Li Si , later grand councillor. By 221, with the help of espionage, extensive bribery, and the ruthlessly effective leadership of gifted generals, Zheng had eliminated one by one the remaining six rival states that constituted China at that time, and the annexation of the last enemy state, Qi , in 221 marked his final triumph: for the first time China was united, under the supreme rule of the Qin.\n\nWhen Zheng, at age 13, formally ascended the throne in 246 bce, Qin already was the most powerful state and was likely to unite the rest of China under its rule. The central states had considered Qin to be a barbarous country , but by that time its strong position on the mountainous western periphery (with its centre in the modern province of Shaanxi) enabled Qin to develop a strong bureaucratic government and military organization as the basis of the totalitarian state philosophy known as legalism .\n\nZhao Zheng was born the son of Zhuangxiang (who later became king of the state of Qin in northwestern China) while his father was held hostage in the state of Zhao. His mother was a former concubine of a rich merchant, L\u00fc Buwei , who, guided by financial interests, managed to install Zhuangxiang on the throne, even though he had not originally been designated as successor. The tradition, once widely accepted, that Zheng was actually L\u00fc Buwei\u2019s natural son is probably a slanderous invention.\n\nEmperor of China\n\nTo herald his achievement, Zheng assumed the sacred titles of legendary rulers and proclaimed himself Qin Shi Huang (\u201cFirst Sovereign Emperor\u201d). With unbounded confidence, he claimed that his dynasty would last \u201c10,000 generations.\u201d\n\nAs emperor he initiated a series of reforms aimed at establishing a fully centralized administration, thus avoiding the rise of independent satrapies. Following the example of Qin and at the suggestion of Li Si, he abolished territorial feudal power in the empire, forced the wealthy aristocratic families to live in the capital, Xianyang, and divided the country into 36 military districts, each with its own military and civil administrator. He also issued orders for almost universal standardization\u2014from weights, measures, and the axle lengths of carts to the written language and the laws. Construction of a network of roads and canals was begun, and fortresses erected for defense against barbarian invasions from the north were linked to form the Great Wall.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

While supervising the consolidation and organization of the empire, he did not neglect to perform sacrifices in various sacred places, announcing to the gods that he had finally united the empire, and he erected stone tablets with ritual inscriptions to extol his achievements.\n\nAnother motive for Qin Shi Huang\u2019s travels was his interest in magic and alchemy and his search for masters in these arts who could provide him with the elixir of immortality. After the failure of such an expedition to the islands in the Eastern Sea\u2014possibly Japan\u2014in 219, the emperor repeatedly summoned magicians to his court. Confucian scholars strongly condemned the step as charlatanry, and it is said that 460 of them were executed for their opposition. The continuous controversy between the emperor and Confucian scholars who advocated a return to the old feudal order culminated in the famous burning of the books of 213, when, at Li Si\u2019s suggestion, all books not dealing with agriculture, medicine, or prognostication were burned, except historical records of Qin and books in the imperial library.\n\nThe last years of Qin Shi Huang\u2019s life were dominated by an ever-growing distrust of his entourage\u2014at least three assassination attempts nearly succeeded\u2014and his increasing isolation from the common people. Almost inaccessible in his huge palaces, the emperor led the life of a semidivine being. In 210 Qin Shi Huang died during an inspection tour. He was buried in a gigantic funerary compound hewn out of a mountain and shaped in conformity with the symbolic patterns of the cosmos. (Excavation of this enormous complex of some 20 square miles [50 square km]\u2014now known as the Qin tomb\u2014began in 1974, and the complex was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987. Among the findings at the site were some 8,000 life-sized terra-cotta soldier and horse figures forming an \u201carmy\u201d for the dead king.) The disappearance of Qin Shi Huang\u2019s forceful personality immediately led to the outbreak of fighting among supporters of the old feudal factions that ended in the collapse of the Qin dynasty and the extermination of the entire imperial clan by 206.\n\nMost of the information about Qin Shi Huang\u2019s life derives from the successor Han dynasty, which prized Confucian scholarship and thus had an interest in disparaging the Qin period. The report that Qin Shi Huang was an illegitimate son of L\u00fc Buwei is possibly an invention of that epoch. Further, stories describing his excessive cruelty and the general defamation of his character must be viewed in the light of the distaste felt by the ultimately victorious Confucians for legalist philosophy in general.\n\nQin Shi Huang certainly had an imposing personality and showed an unbending will in pursuing his aim of uniting and strengthening the empire. His despotic rule and the draconian punishments he meted out were dictated largely by his belief in legalist ideas. With few exceptions, the traditional historiography of imperial China has regarded him as the villain par excellence, inhuman, uncultivated, and superstitious. Modern historians, however, generally stress the endurance of the bureaucratic and administrative structure institutionalized by Qin Shi Huang, which, despite its official denial, remained the basis of all subsequent dynasties in China."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Genghis-Khan", "page_content": "son \u00d6g\u00f6dei son J\u00f6chi son Chagatai ...(Show more)\n\nTop Questions What was Genghis Khan\u2019s early life like? Genghis Khan was born Tem\u00fcjin to a royal clan of the Mongols. When he was nine, his father Yes\u00fcgei was poisoned and Tem\u00fcjin was held captive by his former supporters. He later escaped, killed his half-brother, and began gathering supporters and manpower in his teenage years. How did Genghis Khan come to power? After becoming the head of his clan, Genghis Khan forged alliances with other clans, exterminated the existing clan nobility, and overpowered enemy tribes such as the Tatars. In 1206 an assembly of leaders declared him universal emperor (chinggis kh\u0101n) of the Mongolian steppe. What was Genghis Khan best known for? Genghis Khan was best known for unifying the Mongolian steppe under a massive empire that was able to challenge the powerful Jin dynasty in China and capture territory as far west as the Caspian Sea. When did Genghis Khan die? Genghis Khan died on August 18, 1227, during a campaign against the Tangut kingdom of Xixia.\n\nGenghis Khan, Genghis also spelled Chinggis, Chingis, Jenghiz, or Jinghis, original name Tem\u00fcjin, also spelled Temuchin, (born 1162, near Lake Baikal, Mongolia\u2014died August 18, 1227), Mongolian warrior-ruler, one of the most famous conquerors of history, who consolidated tribes into a unified Mongolia and then extended his empire across Asia to the Adriatic Sea. Top Questions: Genghis Khan See all videos for this article Genghis Khan was a warrior and ruler of genius who, starting from obscure and insignificant beginnings, brought all the nomadic tribes of Mongolia under the rule of himself and his family in a rigidly disciplined military state. He then turned his attention toward the settled peoples beyond the borders of his nomadic realm and began the series of campaigns of plunder and conquest that eventually carried the Mongol armies as far as the Adriatic Sea in one direction and the Pacific coast of China in the other, leading to the establishment of the great Mongol Empire.\n\nHistorical background With the exception of the saga-like Secret History of the Mongols (1240?), only non-Mongol sources provide near-contemporary information about the life of Genghis Khan. Almost all writers, even those who were in the Mongol service, have dwelt on the enormous destruction wrought by the Mongol invasions. One Arab historian openly expressed his horror at the recollection of them. Beyond the reach of the Mongols and relying on second-hand information, the 13th-century chronicler Matthew Paris called them a \u201cdetestable nation of Satan that poured out like devils from Tartarus so that they are rightly called Tartars.\u201d He was making a play on words with the classical word Tartarus (Hell) and the ancient tribal name of Tatar borne by some of the nomads, but his account catches the terror that the Mongols evoked. As the founder of the Mongol nation, the organizer of the Mongol armies, and the genius behind their campaigns, Genghis Khan must share the reputation of his people, even though his generals were frequently operating on their own, far from direct supervision. Nevertheless, it would be mistaken to see the Mongol campaigns as haphazard incursions by bands of marauding savages. Nor is it true, as some have supposed, that these campaigns were somehow brought about by a progressive desiccation of Inner Asia that compelled the nomads to look for new pastures. Nor, again, were the Mongol invasions a unique event. Genghis Khan was neither the first nor the last nomadic conqueror to burst out of the Steppe and terrorize the settled periphery of Eurasia. His campaigns were merely larger in scale, more successful, and more lasting in effect than those of other leaders. They impinged more violently upon those sedentary peoples who had the habit of recording events in writing, and they affected a greater part of the Eurasian continent and a variety of different societies. Two societies were in constant contact, two societies that were mutually hostile, if only because of their diametrically opposed ways of life, and yet these societies were interdependent. The nomads needed some of the staple products of the south and coveted its luxuries. These could be had by trade, by taxing transient caravans, or by armed raids. The settled peoples of China needed the products of the steppe to a lesser extent, but they could not ignore the presence of the nomadic barbarians and were forever preoccupied with resisting encroachment by one means or another. A strong dynasty, such as the 17th-century Manchu, could extend its military power directly over all Inner Asia. At other times the Chinese would have to play off one set of barbarians against another, transferring their support and juggling their alliances so as to prevent any one tribe from becoming too strong. Britannica Quiz History Buff Quiz The cycle of dynastic strength and weakness in China was accompanied by another cycle, that of unity and fragmentation amongst the peoples of the steppe. At the peak of their power, a nomadic tribe under a determined leader could subjugate the other tribes to its will and, if the situation in China was one of weakness, might extend its power well beyond the steppe. In the end this extension of nomadic power over the incompatible, sedentary culture of the south brought its own nemesis. The nomads lost their traditional basis of superiority\u2014that lightning mobility that required little in the way of supply and fodder\u2014and were swallowed up by the Chinese they had conquered. The cycle would then be resumed; a powerful China would reemerge, and disarray and petty squabbling among ephemeral chieftains would be the new pattern of life among the nomads. The history of the Mongol conquests illustrates this analysis perfectly, and it is against this background of political contrasts and tensions that the life of Genghis Khan must be evaluated. His campaigns were not an inexplicable natural or even God-given catastrophe but the outcome of a set of circumstances manipulated by a soldier of ambition, determination, and genius. He found his tribal world ready for unification, at a time when China and other settled states were, for one reason or another, simultaneously in decline, and he exploited the situation."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Emperor_Wenxuan_of_Northern_Qi", "page_content": "Emperor Wenxuan of (Northern) Qi ((\u5317)\u9f4a\u6587\u5ba3\u5e1d) (526\u2013559), personal name Gao Yang (\u9ad8\u6d0b, Wade\u2013Giles: Kao Yang), courtesy name Zijin (\u5b50\u9032), Xianbei name Hounigan (\u4faf\u5c3c\u5e72), was the founding emperor of the Northern Qi dynasty of China.

His mother Lou Zhaojun was Gao Huan's wife, on whose financial support Gao's early career had relied on. Lou Zhaojun was from a wealthy Xianbei family. He was their second son, after his older brother Gao Cheng. After Erzhu Rong's death in 530, Gao Huan overthrew Erzhu's family and became Northern Wei's paramount general, and after Northern Wei divided into Eastern Wei and Western Wei in 534 became the actual power controlling Eastern Wei. Gao Yang thus grew up in a household of power. In 535, he was created the Duke of Taiyuan (\u592a\u539f\u516c).\n\nGao Yang was not well regarded as a child, as he was awkward in interpersonal skills and at times considered developmentally disabled, being unable to carry out many tasks common for children, though it appears that he feigned this to prevent suspicion of his elder brother. It appeared that he was actually of fairly high capability in many areas, and once, when Gao Huan tried to test his children's intelligence by giving them tangled balls of yarn to untangle, Gao Yang took out his sword and sliced the ball open, stating that that was the only solution. As Gao Huan's sons grew older, on one occasion, Gao Huan wanted to test their military abilities by having his general Peng Le (\u5f6d\u6a02) launch a mock attack on them. All of Gao Huan's sons, including the older Gao Cheng, were fearful, but Gao Yang reacted calmly and actually captured Peng. As he grew, he continued to be awkward and appearing to be unintelligent, and Gao Cheng, in particular, often looked down on him.\n\nGao Huan died in 547, and thereafter, Gao Cheng, who had already controlled many aspects of Eastern Wei imperial government's operations, took over as regent. He moved to consolidate his power further, and when Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei tried to form a plot to kill him, he discovered the plot and put Emperor Xiaojing under effective house arrest. He then planned taking the throne himself, but at a meeting in 549 at the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan, Hebei), with his officials Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212), and Yang Yin, to discuss the procedure for doing so, he was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac), who was angry at his wrongful treatment. At that time, Gao Yang happened to be in Yecheng, and he quickly gathered the guards and killed Lan and his co-conspirators. He chose not to announce Gao Cheng's death immediately, while moving to consolidate power.\n\nAs Eastern Wei regent\n\nInitially, Emperor Xiaojing, who had received rumors that Gao Cheng had died, thought he might have a chance to regain power. However, upon meeting Gao Yang, who made a display of force by having more than 8000 guards accompany him, Emperor Xiaojing saw that Gao Yang could not be easily dealt with. Meanwhile, Gao Yang headed for the Gaos' stronghold of Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), and consolidated his military command there, quickly impressing the generals who had previously looked down on him with quick and careful decisions.\n\nIn fall and winter 549, with rival Liang Dynasty under internal turmoil after the rebellion of Hou Jing (a former Eastern Wei general who had defected to Liang in 547), Gao Yang sent Peng Le to attack the Liang border provinces, taking over the region between the Huai River and Yangtze River with ease.\n\nIn spring 550, Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing convey on him the greater title of Prince of Qi Commandery. Two months later, his title was made the even greater title of Prince of Qi.\n\nIn summer 550, under advice from the officials Gao Dezheng (\u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f), Xu Zhicai (\u5f90\u4e4b\u624d), and Song Jingye (\u5b8b\u666f\u696d), Gao Yang decided to take the throne, despite reservations from Gao Yang's mother Princess Dowager Lou. He therefore headed from Jinyang to Yecheng, but even as he was on the way and had reached the halfway city of Pingdu (\u5e73\u90fd, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi), the officials largely pretended to ignore his overtures at taking the throne, so he returned to Jinyang. Soon thereafter, he had Emperor Xiaojing issue an edict conferring the nine bestowments on him, further displaying his posture of taking the throne. He then proceeded to Yecheng again, and Emperor Xiaojing yielded the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and establishing Northern Qi, with Gao Yang as its Emperor Wenxuan. He created the former Emperor Xiaojing the Prince of Zhongshan. He posthumously honored Gao Huan and Gao Cheng as emperors, while honoring his mother as empress dowager.\n\nEarly reign\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for being attentive to important matters of state, particularly military matters. He revised Eastern Wei laws, and he selected elite soldiers from both Xianbei and Han ethnicities to form the border defense corps. To equalize the tax and labor burden, he divided the households under his rule into nine classes based on their wealth, requiring the wealthy to pay more taxes and the poor to contribute more labor. Continuing a trend set by both his father Gao Huan and his brother Gao Cheng, he divided his time between Yecheng and Jinyang, effectively making Jinyang a second capital.\n\nJust like his father Gao Huan, Emperor Wenxuan viewed himself as more of a Xianbei rather than Chinese. Further, more than his father did, he was not willing to follow most of the Chinese traditions. Because of this, Gao Dezheng and another official, Gao Longzhi (\u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b), who wanted to ingratiate themselves with Emperor Wenxuan's cousin and powerful general Duan Shao (\u6bb5\u97f6), suggested he make Duan Shao's sister Lady Duan, a concubine of his, empress. Emperor Wenxuan did not follow their advice and, pursuant to expected norm, created his wife Princess Li Zu'e empress and created her son Gao Yin crown prince.\n\nIn response to the establishment of Northern Qi, Yuwen Tai, the paramount general of rival Western Wei, launched a major attack on Northern Qi. Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops to defend against Yuwen's attack. When Yuwen saw that Emperor Wenxuan's troops were well-organized, he sighed and stated, \"Gao Huan is not yet dead.\" He was unable to overcome Emperor Wenxuan's defense and so was forced to withdraw, and in fact lost some border commanderies to Northern Qi in the campaign.\n\nAround the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan wanted to put the former emperor, the Prince of Zhongshan, to death. He first invited his sister and the prince's wife, the Princess Taiyuan, to a feast. As soon as she left the prince's household, he sent assassins to force the prince to drink poison, and also killed his three sons. He buried the former emperor with imperial honors, but at a later point, for reasons unknown, he dug out the former emperor's casket and threw it into the Zhang River (\u6f33\u6c34, flowing near Yecheng).\n\nIn spring 552, Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops against the Kumo Xi tribe (in the upper Liao River drainage area) and achieved a great victory. Around the same time, he also sent generals to seize certain border cities with Liang, as Liang troops continued to battle Hou Jing, who declared himself the Emperor of Han in 551 but was subsequently defeated by Emperor Yuan of Liang in 552. The campaigns of seizing Liang cities continued even after Hou's defeat, although he did not at this point launch a single major attack on Liang. The campaigns appeared to end in winter 552, and Emperor Wenxuan in fact promised the Liang generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian, whom Emperor Yuan put in charge of the eastern half of Liang territory, to return the cities of Guangling (\u5ee3\u9675, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) and Liyang (\u6b77\u967d, in modern Chaohu, Anhui).\n\nAlso in winter 552, Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops from Jinyang to Lishi (\u96e2\u77f3, in modern L\u00fcliang, Shanxi), and he ordered the construction of a great wall from Huanglu Mountain (\u9ec3\u6ae8\u5dba, also in modern L\u00fcliang) to Sheping Fortress (\u793e\u5e73\u620d, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi), apparently to defend against Western Wei and Tujue.\n\nIn winter 553, Khitan tribes were attacking Northern Qi's northern borders, and Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops to attack Khitan\u2014and on this campaign, he was described as personally exposing himself to the dangers and contributing much personally to defeating the Khitan.\n\nAlso in winter 553, Emperor Wenxuan, wanting to put Northern Qi-friendly emperor on the Liang throne, commissioned an army commanded by Guo Yuanjian (\u90ed\u5143\u5efa) to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Tui (\u856d\u9000), who had surrendered to Eastern Wei in 548, back to Liang territory. However, Northern Qi forces were defeated by the Liang general Hou Tian (\u4faf\u7471), and Xiao Tui returned to Yecheng.\n\nAround the new year 554, the remnants of Rouran, which by that point was near its end, surrendered to Northern Qi to seek protection from Tujue attacks. Emperor Wenxuan personally attacked the Tujue, fighting its army off, and then created Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen as the new khan of Rouran, settling the Rouran people within Northern Qi territory, at Mayi (\u99ac\u9091, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi).\n\nIn spring 554, Emperor Wenxuan, assisted by the senior general Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1) and his brother Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, launched a major attack on the Shanhu (\u5c71\u80e1) tribe (in modern L\u00fcliang). After victory, he ordered that all 11-year-old and older males of the Shanhu be slaughtered, and that the females and the young males be awarded as spoils of war to the soldiers. When one of his commanders died because that commander's lieutenant, Lu Huili (\u8def\u6689\u79ae), was unable to save him, Emperor Wenxuan ordered that Lu's internal organs be cut out of his body and that the soldiers consume them. Many traditional historians, including Li Yanshou (\u674e\u5ef6\u58fd), the author of the History of Northern Dynasties, and Sima Guang, the author of the Zizhi Tongjian, saw this battle as the turning point of Emperor Wenxuan's rule\u2014that thereafter, he began to act violently and capriciously. For example, in spring 554, when Rouran rebelled and he personally led troops to defeat Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen, he felt that warhorses offered by the general Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) the Prince of Anding were not of sufficient quality\u2014and he punished Heba by plucking out Heba's hair and demoting to commoner status, and further ordering Heba to serve as a worker in a coal processing facility. In another example, in fall 554, after he had put the official Yuan Xu (\u5143\u65ed), a former Northern Wei prince, to death, he remembered the snubs that Gao Longzhi, who was a friend of Yuan Xu's, had shown him before he became Eastern Wei's regent, and he had Gao Longzhi battered so severely that Gao Longzhi died several days later\u2014and at a later point, still angry at Gao Longzhi, arrested Gao Longzhi's 20 sons and, with 20 executioners lined up, had the sons beheaded simultaneously, and then threw their bodies and Gao Longzhi's body into the Zhang River.\n\nStarting in 551, Emperor Wenxuan had ordered his official Wei Shou to compile a history of Northern Wei. Wei Shou completed the work in 554, but his work (Book of Wei) was criticized by many to be defamatory to ancestors of many political enemies (so much so that they referred to the work as Huishu (\u7a62\u66f8\u2014the Book of Filth)), and several officials filed reports condemning Wei Shou. Wei Shou submitted a petition to Emperor Wenxuan defending himself, and Emperor Wenxuan, in an act that he believed to be protecting the integrity of history, jailed the officials who condemned Wei Shou.\n\nIn late 554, Western Wei launched a major attack on Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), then the capital of Liang. Emperor Wenxuan commissioned an army commanded by Gao Huan's cousin Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3) the Prince of Qinghe to attack Western Wei's An Province (\u5b89\u5dde, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei) to try to relieve pressure from Jiangling, but by the time that Gao Yue arrived, Jiangling had already fallen, and Western Wei captured and then executed Emperor Yuan.\n\nLate reign\n\nWestern Wei declared Emperor Yuan's nephew Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang (known in history as the Western Liang), but the declaration was not recognized by most Liang generals, and the chief of those generals, Wang Sengbian, welcomed Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an to the old Liang capital Jiankang, declaring him the Prince of Liang in spring 555 and preparing to make him emperor. Emperor Wenxuan had other ideas, however, and he created Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, whom Eastern Wei captured in 547 during Liang's attempt to aid Hou Jing's rebellion against Eastern Wei, emperor, commissioning his brother Gao Hu\u00e0n (\u9ad8\u6e19, note tone difference with his father) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Xiao Yuanming back to Liang territory. Emperor Wenxuan wrote letters to Wang recommending Xiao Yuanming as emperor, arguing that Xiao Fangzhi (who was 12 years old) was too young. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after Gao Huan won a few battles over Wang's generals, Wang decided to submit and, after Northern Qi escorting troops agreed to limit their presence to 1,000 men, and Xiao Yuanming agreed to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince, accepted Xiao Yuanming as emperor. To show his good faith, Wang sent his son Wang Xian (\u738b\u986f) and nephew Wang Shizhen (\u738b\u4e16\u73cd), as well as Wang Xian's mother Lady Liu, to Yecheng as hostages. Xiao Yuanming became Liang's emperor, and there was peace between Northern Qi and Liang, with Liang now a vassal.\n\nJust four months later, however, the situation changed. Wang Sengbian's lieutenant Chen Baxian, displeased over Xiao Yuanming's ascension (as he saw Xiao Yuanming's claim as being too attenuated), make a surprise attack on Jiankang from his headquarters of Jingkou (\u4eac\u53e3, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), killing Wang Sengbian and forcing Xiao Yuanming to yield the throne to Xiao Fangzhi (who took the throne as Emperor Jing). Initially, Chen claimed that Liang would still agree to be a vassal, and Emperor Wenxuan sent the official Sima Gong (\u53f8\u99ac\u606d) to swear an oath with Liang officials. However, with several generals loyal to Wang Sengbian rising against Chen following Wang's death, Emperor Wenxuan's mind changed, particularly after two, Xu Sihui (\u5f90\u55e3\u5fbd) and Ren Yue (\u4efb\u7d04) submitted to him, making a surprise attack on the near-Jiankang fortress Shitou and capturing it. Emperor Wenxuan sent the general Xiao Gui (\u856d\u8ecc) to reinforce Xu and Ren. Chen defeated Northern Qi troops and Xu and Ren, however, and Xiao Gui's assistant Liu Damo (\u67f3\u9054\u6469), sieged by Chen in Shitou, sought peace. Chen agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (\u9673\u66c7\u6717), Emperor Jing's nephew Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (\u738b\u73c9), the son of the key official Wang Chong (\u738b\u6c96), to serve as hostages to Northern Qi, allowing Liu to withdraw. (Upon Liu's return to Northern Qi, however, Emperor Wenxuan had him executed.)\n\nDuring the campaign against Liang, Emperor Wenxuan made another display of his increasing instability, as he, jealous over the fact that his concubine Consort Xue had previously had a sexual relationship with Gao Yue, ordered Gao Yue to commit suicide. Thereafter, he beheaded Consort Xue and hid her head in his sleeves. At a banquet later that day, he tossed her head onto a platter and cut her body into pieces, beginning to play with her leg, which he converted into a fiddle, surprising all of the banquet attendants. At the end of the banquet, he packed her body parts and began crying, following the cart carrying her body on foot.\n\nIn fall 555, Emperor Wenxuan became convinced that Buddhism and Taoism should be but one religion, and that one of them should be merged into the other. He had the leading Buddhist and Taoist monks debate before him, and he declared the Buddhists the victors, ordering Taoism merged into Buddhism and Taoist monks to become Buddhist monks. Some Taoist monks initially rejected this edict, but after he executed four monks, the others submitted, and Taoism became banned within Northern Qi.\n\nIn spring 556, border battles between Northern Qi and Liang resumed, and Northern Qi prepared another campaign against Liang. In summer 556, Northern Qi forces were again south of the Yangtze, operating in Jiankang's vicinity, but they were stalemated against Liang troops, eventually defeated by Chen and his generals after they ran out of food. A number of Northern Wei generals were captured and executed by Liang, and in response, Emperor Wenxuan put Chen Tanlang to death.\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's erratic behavior became even greater in scope, fueled by his alcoholism. As described by Sima Guang in his Zizhi Tongjian:\n\n:... Wenxuan drank heavily and lived immorality, carrying out cruel and barbarous act at his on whim. Sometimes he sang and danced day and night. Sometimes he spread his hair and wore barbarian clothing with colorful sashes. Sometimes he bared his body and put on makeup. Sometimes he rode donkeys, cows, camels, or elephants without using saddles. Sometimes he ordered Cui Jishu or Liu Taozhi (\u5289\u6843\u679d) to carry him and a large drum to allow him to beat the drums. He was accustomed to making surprise charges into the nobles' and imperial officials' private residences. He often crossed streets, sometimes sitting in the streets and sometimes even sleeping on them. Sometimes when it is warm, he would be naked to bask in the sun, but even in the coldest winter, he would strip naked as well and run around. His attendants could not stand his behavior, but he himself did not care. ... Once, he asked a woman on the street, \"How is the Son of Heaven like?\" The woman responded, \"He is so crazy that he really cannot be considered a Son of Heaven.\" He beheaded her.\n\nOnce, when he was drunk and acting irrationally, his mother Empress Dowager Lou rebuked him, and he threatened to marry her to an old barbarian. When she became angry, he became fearful, and he wanted to induce her to smile again, so he crawled on the ground under her seat, but in doing so, he flipped the seat over, and she was injured. After he sobered up, he realized how she had been injured, and he set a large fire, intending to jump in to die, causing her to have to grab him to save him. He thereafter pledged not to drink any more, but was only able to do so for 10 days before he began drinking again. He also once shot an arrow at Empress Li's mother Lady Cui and whipped her. Further, it was described that most women of the imperial Gao clan were forced to have sexual relations with him at one point or another. When Gao Huan's concubine Erzhu Ying'e, the Princess Dowager of Pengcheng, refused, he killed her with his own hands. Emperor Wenxuan also became homicidal when he drank, and he always wanted to kill people when he was drunk. Yang Yin, who was prime minister at this point, therefore set up a group of condemned prisoners and a saw to be available to the palace guards\u2014if Emperor Wenxuan wanted to kill someone, a condemned prisoner would be brought out for him to kill, and if a prisoner was able to survive for three months without being killed, he would be set free.\n\nHowever, even in his erratic behavior, Emperor Wenxuan was still attentive to many important matters, and because of his harshness, his officials did not dare to be corrupt. Further, Yang was a capable prime minister, and Emperor Wenxuan gave him full authorization to carry out laws properly. Therefore, it was said at the time that while the emperor was violent and insane, the government was nevertheless efficient.\n\nIn winter 557, believing prophecies that Gao Hu\u00e0n would be emperor, he ordered Gao Hu\u00e0n arrested. Gao Hu\u00e0n tried to resist, but was nevertheless captured and delivered to Yecheng. When another brother, Gao Jun (\u9ad8\u6d5a) the prince of Yong'an, sent petitions urging him to change his behavior, he had Gao Jun arrested as well, and the two princes were imprisoned in a dungeon.\n\nAlso in winter 557, Chen Baxian had Liang's Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing Chen Dynasty, and subsequently had Emperor Jing killed in 558. The general Wang Lin, then in control of modern Hunan and eastern Hubei, refused to submit to Chen and sought to continue Liang's lineage. He therefore requested Northern Qi to return Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia to be emperor. In spring 558, Northern Qi troops escorted Xiao Zhuang to Wang's territory, and Wang declared Xiao Zhuang emperor, as a Northern Qi vassal, with his capital at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan, Hubei).\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's military campaigns and other wasteful behavior had caused the imperial treasury to be drained. He had also become unhappy with his son Gao Yin, believing that Gao Yin was too Han-like in behavior, and he considered deposing Gao Yin. Once, he ordered Gao Yin to personally execute a prisoner, but Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and Emperor Wenxuan battered him with a whip handle, causing Gao Yin to thereafter have a panic disorder and at times unable to speak. When Emperor Wenxuan became drunk, he would often state that he might eventually pass the throne to his brother Gao Yan, and he stopped stating as such only after urging by Yang and Wei Shou, who believed that his words were causing an unstabling effect in causing a doubt as to who would succeed him.\n\nAround the new year 559, Emperor Wenxuan visited the imprisoned Gao Jun and Gao Hu\u00e0n. He initially took pity on them and considered releasing them, but, at the urging of another brother, Gao Zhan the Prince of Changguang, did not do so, and further started to pierce them with spears. He also ordered that torches be thrown at them, burning them to death. He rewarded the princes' wives to the soldiers who delivered the death blows.\n\nIn summer 559, Emperor Wenxuan, suspecting that the members of the Northern Wei imperial Yuan clan would eventually try to return to power, ordered the Yuans to be slaughtered, regardless of age or gender, and had the bodies thrown into the Zhang River. In particular, a man named Yuan Huangtou flown off a tower strapped to a kite as part of an experiment of Emperor Wenxuan, the first known case of human flight. He survived but was starved to death in prison. Only several households who were particularly close to the Gaos were spared.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne.\" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei. The officials tried to mourn at his death, but no one was actually able to shed a tear other than Yang Yin. Not long after, Gao Yan killed Yang Yin and deposed Gao Yin, becoming emperor.\n\nPhysical appearance\n\nIn the Book of Northern Qi, author Li Baiyao notes that Gao Yang was a dark-skinned man with large and protruding jaws, and that his skin appeared to be abnormally rough.\n\nFamily\n\nConsorts and Issue:\n\n\u2022 Empress Zhaoxin, of the Li clan of Zhao (\u662d\u4fe1\u7687\u540e \u8d99\u90e1\u674e\u6c0f), personal name Zu'e (\u7956\u5a25)\n\n\u2022 Gao Yin, Prince Jinan Mindao (\u6fdf\u5357\u610d\u60bc\u738b \u9ad8\u6bb7; 545\u2013561), first son\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaode, Prince Taiyuan (\u592a\u539f\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u5fb7; 548\u2013562), second son\n\n\u2022 Princess Changle (\u9577\u6a02\u516c\u4e3b), personal name Baode (\u5bf6\u5fb7)\n\n\u2022 Married Wei Shibian (\u5c09\u4e16\u8faf)\n\n\u2022 Princess Yining (\u7fa9\u5be7\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Hul\u00fc Wudu (\u659b\u5f8b\u6b66\u90fd; d. 572), the first son of Hul\u00fc Guang\n\n\u2022 Furen, of the Yan clan (\u5f18\u5fb7\u592b\u4eba \u984f\u6c0f; 530\u2013576), personal name Yuguang (\u7389\u5149)\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaolian, Prince Longxi (\u96b4\u897f\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u5ec9; 553\u2013577), fifth son\n\n\u2022 Pin, of the Pei clan (\u5b2a \u88f4\u6c0f)\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaoren, Prince Xihe (\u897f\u6cb3\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u4ec1; d. 577), fourth son\n\n\u2022 Pin, of the Xue clan (\u5b2a \u859b\u6c0f; d. 555)\n\n\u2022 A daughter\n\n\u2022 Shifu, of the Feng clan (\u4e16\u5a66 \u99ae\u6c0f)\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaoyi, Prince Fanyang (\u8303\u967d\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u7fa9; d. 580), third son\n\n\u2022 Unknown\n\n\u2022 Princess Zhongshan (\u4e2d\u5c71\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Duan Baoding of Wuwei (\u6b66\u5a01 \u6bb5\u5bf6\u9f0e)\n\nAncestry"}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Wen_Xuan", "page_content": "What we do.

Just better.\n\nAnthology of Chinese poetry and literature\n\nThe Wen Xuan ([w\u0259\u030cn.\u0255\u0265\u025b\u0300n]; Chinese: \u6587\u9078), usually translated Selections of Refined Literature, is one of the earliest and most important anthologies of Chinese poetry and literature, and is one of the world's oldest literary anthologies to be arranged by topic. It is a selection of what were judged to be the best poetic and prose pieces from the late Warring States period (c. 300 BC) to the early Liang dynasty (c. AD 500), excluding the Chinese Classics and philosophical texts. The Wen Xuan preserves most of the greatest fu rhapsody and shi poetry pieces from the Qin and Han dynasties, and for much of pre-modern history was one of the primary sources of literary knowledge for educated Chinese.[2]\n\nThe Wen Xuan was compiled between AD 520 and 530 in the city of Jiankang (modern Nanjing) during the Liang dynasty by Xiao Tong, the eldest son of Emperor Wu of Liang, and a group of scholars he had assembled. The Liang dynasty, though short-lived, was a period of intense literary activity, and the ruling Xiao family ensured that eminent writers and scholars were frequently invited to the imperial and provincial courts.[3] As Crown Prince, Xiao Tong received the best classical Chinese education available and began selecting pieces for his new anthology in his early twenties. The Wen Xuan contains 761 separate pieces organized into 37 literary categories, the largest and most well known being \"Rhapsodies\" (fu) and \"Lyric Poetry\" (shi).\n\nStudy of the Wen Xuan enjoyed immense popularity during the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907), and its study rivalled that of the Five Classics during that period. The Wen Xuan was required reading for any aspiring scholar and official even into the Song dynasty. Throughout the Yuan and Ming dynasties study of the Wen Xuan lapsed out of popularity, though the great philologists of the Qing dynasty revived its study to some extent.\n\nThree volumes of the first full English translation of the Wen Xuan have been published by the American sinologist David R. Knechtges, professor emeritus of Chinese at the University of Washington, who aims to eventually complete the translation in five additional volumes.\n\nYouTube Encyclopedic\n\n1 / 1 Views: 478\n\n#skcbusana Ianthea Ashley Tiu Wen Xuan | 5 Dahlia | Cheongsam Transcription\n\nHistory\n\nCompilation\n\nThe Wen Xuan was compiled during the 520s by Xiao Tong\u2014the son and heir apparent of Emperor Wu of Liang\u2014at the Liang capital Jiankang (modern Nanjing) with the assistance of his closest friends and associates. Xiao was a precocious child and received an excellent classical Chinese education. His two official biographies both state that by age four he had memorized the Five Classics and at age eight gave a relatively competent lecture on the Classic of Filial Piety to a group of assembled scholars.[4] As Xiao matured, he developed a love of scholarship and books, and by his early teenage years the library of the Eastern Palace \u2013 the Crown Prince's official residence \u2013 contained over 30,000 volumes.\n\nXiao spent much of his leisure time in the company of the leading Chinese scholars of his day, and their serious discussions of literature impelled the creation of the Wen Xuan. His main purpose in creating the Wen Xuan was the creation of a suitable anthology of the best individual works of belles-lettres available, and he ignored philosophical works in favor of aesthetically beautiful poetry and other writings.[5] In the Wen Xuan's preface, Xiao explains that four major types of Chinese writing were deliberately excluded from it: 1) the traditional \"Classics\" that were anciently attributed to the Duke of Zhou and Confucius, such as the Classic of Changes (I Ching) and the Classic of Poetry (Shi jing); 2) writings of philosophical \"masters\", such as the Laozi (Dao De Jing), the Zhuangzi, and the Mencius; 3) collections of rhetorical speeches, such as the Intrigues of the Warring States (Zhan guo ce); and 4) historical narratives and chronicles such as the Zuo Tradition (Zuo zhuan). After Xiao Tong's death in 531 he was given the posthumous name Zhaoming \u662d\u660e (\"Resplendent Brilliance\"), and so the collection came to be known as the \"Zhaoming Wen xuan\".[7] Despite its massive influence on Chinese literature, Xiao's categories and editorial choices have occasionally been criticized throughout Chinese history for a number of odd or illogical choices.[8]\n\nManuscripts\n\nA large number of manuscripts and fragments of the Wen Xuan have survived to modern times. Many were discovered among the Dunhuang manuscripts and are held in various museums around the world, particularly at the British Library and Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, as well as in Japan, where the Wen Xuan was well known from at least the 7th century. One Japanese manuscript, held in the Eisei Bunko Museum, is a rare fragment of a Wen Xuan commentary that may predate Li Shan's authoritative commentary from the mid-6th century.\n\nContents\n\nThe Wen Xuan contains 761 works organized into 37 separate categories: Rhapsodies (fu \u8ce6), Lyric Poetry (sh\u012b \u8a69), Chu-style Elegies (s\u0101o \u9a37), Sevens (q\u012b \u4e03), Edicts (zh\u00e0o \u8a54), Patents of Enfeoffment (c\u00e8 \u518c), Commands (l\u00ecng \u4ee4), Instructions (ji\u00e0o \u6559), Examination Prompts (c\u00e8w\u00e9n \u7b56\u6587), Memorials (bi\u01ceo \u8868), Letters of Submission (sh\u00e0ngsh\u016b \u4e0a\u66f8), Communications (q\u01d0 \u5553), Memorials of Impeachment (t\u00e1nsh\u00ec \u5f48\u4e8b), Memoranda (ji\u0101n \u724b), Notes of Presentation (z\u00f2uj\u00ec \u594f\u8a18), Letters (sh\u016b \u66f8), Proclamations of War (x\u00ed \u6a84), Responses to Questions (du\u00ecw\u00e8n \u5c0d\u554f), Hypothetical Discourses (sh\u00e8 l\u00f9n \u8a2d\u8ad6), Mixed song/rhapsody (c\u00ed \u8fad), Prefaces (x\u00f9 \u5e8f), Praise Poems (s\u00f2ng \u980c), Encomia for Famous Men (z\u00e0n \u8d0a), Prophetic Signs (f\u00fa m\u00ecng \u7b26\u547d), Historical Treatises (sh\u01d0 l\u00f9n \u53f2\u8ad6), Historical Evaluations and Judgments (sh\u01d0 sh\u00f9 z\u00e0n \u53f2\u8ff0\u8d0a), Treatises (l\u00f9n \u8ad6), \"Linked Pearls\" (li\u00e1nzh\u016b \u9023\u73e0), Admonitions (zh\u0113n \u7bb4), Inscriptions (m\u00edng \u9298), Dirges (l\u011bi \u8a84), Laments (a\u012b \u54c0), Epitaphs (b\u00e9i \u7891), Grave Memoirs (m\u00f9zh\u00ec \u5893\u8a8c), Conduct Descriptions (x\u00edngzhu\u00e0ng \u884c\u72c0), Condolences (di\u00e0ow\u00e9n \u5f14\u6587), and Offerings (j\u00ec \u796d).[12]\n\nThe first group of categories \u2013 the \"Rhapsodies\" (fu) and \"Lyric Poetry\" (shi), and to a lesser extent the \"Chu-style Elegies\" and \"Sevens\" \u2013 are the largest and most important of the Wen Xuan.[13] Its 55 fu, in particular, are a \"remarkably representative selection of major works\",[13] and includes most of the greatest fu masterpieces, such as Sima Xiangru's \"Fu on the Excursion Hunt of the Emperor\" (Ti\u0101nz\u01d0 y\u00f3uli\u00e8 f\u00f9 \u5929\u5b50\u904a\u7375\u8ce6), Yang Xiong's \"Fu on the Sweet Springs Palace\" (G\u0101n Qu\u00e1n f\u00f9 \u7518\u6cc9\u8ce6), Ban Gu's \"Fu on the Two Capitals\" (Li\u01ceng d\u016b f\u00f9 \u5169\u90fd\u8ce6), and Zhang Heng's \"Fu on the Two Metropolises\" (\u00c8r j\u012bng f\u00f9 \u4e8c\u4eac\u8ce6).\n\nAnnotations\n\nThe first annotations to the Wen Xuan appeared sixty to seventy years after its publication and were produced by Xiao Tong's cousin Xiao Gai. Cao Xian, Xu Yan, Li Shan [zh], Gongsun Luo, and other scholars of the late Sui dynasty and Tang dynasty helped promote the Wen Xuan until it became the focus of an entire branch of literature study: an early 7th century scholar from Yangzhou named Cao Xian (\u66f9\u61b2) produced a work entitled Pronunciation and Meaning in the Wen Xuan (Chinese: \u6587\u9078\u97f3\u7fa9; pinyin: W\u00e9nxu\u01cen Y\u012bny\u00ec) and the others \u2013 who were his students \u2013 each produced their own annotations to the collection.\n\nLi Shan (\u674e\u5584, d. 689) was a student of Cao Xian and a minor official who served on the staff of Li Hong, a Crown Prince of the early Tang dynasty.[14] Li had an encyclopedic knowledge of early Chinese language and literature which he used to create a detailed commentary to the Wen Xuan that he submitted to the imperial court of Emperor Gaozong of Tang in 658, though he may have later expanded and revised it with the assistance of his son Li Yong (\u674e\u9095).[15] Li's annotations, which have been termed \"models of philological rigor\", are some of the most exemplary in all of Chinese literature, giving accurate glosses of rare and difficult words and characters, as well as giving source information and loci classici for notable passages.[16] His commentary is still the recognized as the most useful and important tool for reading and studying the Wen Xuan in the original Chinese.[16]\n\nIn 718, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, a new Wen Xuan commentary by court officials L\u00fc Yanji, Liu Liang, Zhang Xian, L\u00fc Xiang, and Li Zhouhan entitled Collected Commentaries of the Five Officials (Chinese: \u4e94\u81e3\u96c6\u6ce8; pinyin: W\u01d4ch\u00e9n j\u00ed zh\u00f9) was submitted to the imperial court.[17] This \"Five Officials\" commentary is longer and contains more paraphrases of difficult lines than Li Shan's annotations, but is also full of erroneous and far-fetched glosses and interpretations.[17]\n\nLater editions\n\nBesides the Li Shan and \"Five Officials\" commentaries, a number of other Wen Xuan editions seem to have circulated during the Tang dynasty. Almost none of these other editions have survived to modern times, though a number of manuscripts have been preserved in Japan. A number of fragments of the Wen Xuan or commentaries to it were rediscovered in Japan in the 1950s, including one from Dunhuang discovered in the Eisei Bunko Museum and a complete manuscript of a shorter Kuj\u014d (\u4e5d\u689d, Mandarin: Ji\u01d4ti\u00e1o) edition printed as early as 1099.[18] The best known of these other editions is Collected Commentaries of the Wen Xuan (W\u00e9nxu\u01cen j\u00edzh\u00f9 \u6587\u9078\u96c6\u6ce8, Japanese: Monzen sh\u016bch\u016b), an edition of unknown authorship that contains some old Tang dynasty commentaries that were lost in China.[17]\n\nPublished during the reign of Emperor Zhezong of Song, in the second lunar month of 1094, the Youzhou Prefecture Study Book contained the first compilation of the annotations of both the Five Officials and Li Shan. The later Annotations of the Six Scholars edition (i.e. the Five Officials and Li Shan), such as Guang Dupei's woodblock printing and the Mingzhou printing was the most well-known edition of the Youzhou book. Another edition, called the Annotations of the Six Officials, which had Ganzhou and Jianzhou versions, was based on the Six Scholars edition but altered the ordering of certain sections.\n\nIn the early 19th century, scholar Hu Kejia produced a collated and textually critical edition entitled Kao Yi (Chinese: \u8003\u7570; lit. 'A Study of the Differences'). This edition became the basis for most modern printings of the Wen Xuan, such as the Zhonghua Book Company's 1977 edition and the Shanghai Guji 1986 edition.\n\nInfluence\n\nBy the early 8th century the Wen Xuan had become an important text that all young men were expected to master in preparation for literary examinations.[17] Famed poet Du Fu advised his son Du Zongwu to \"master thoroughly the principles of the Wen Xuan.\"[17] Copies of the Wen Xuan were obtained by nearly all families that could afford them in order to help their sons study the literary styles of the works it contained. This practice continued into the Song dynasty until the imperial examination reforms of the late 11th century.[17] In the mid-16th century, during the Ming dynasty, an abridged version of the Wen Xuan was created to help aspiring officials study composition for the eight-legged essays on Ming-era imperial exams.[19]\n\nInfluence in Japan\n\nThe Wen Xuan (Japanese: Mon-zen) was transmitted to Japan sometime after its initial publication and had become required reading for the Japanese aristocracy by the Heian period. Admired for its beauty, many terms from the Wen Xuan made their way into Japanese as loanwords and are still used.\n\nTranslations\n\nFrench\n\nMargouli\u00e8s, Georges (1926), Le \"Fou\" dans le Wen siuan: \u00c9tude et textes, Paris: Paul Geuthner.\n\nGerman\n\nvon Zach, Erwin (1958), Fang, Ilse Martin (ed.), Die Chinesische Anthologie: \u00dcbersetzungen aus dem Wen Hs\u00fcan, Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard-Yenching Studies, Harvard University Press.\n\nJapanese\n\nUchida, Sennosuke \u5167\u7530\u6cc9\u4e4b\u52a9; Ami, Yuji \u7db2\u7950\u6b21 (1963\u201364), Monzen: Shihen \u6587\u9078: \u8a69\u7bc7, 2 vols. , Tokyo: Meiji shoin.\n\nObi, K\u014dichi \u5c0f\u5c3e\u90ca\u4e00; Hanabusa, Hideki \u82b1\u623f\u82f1\u6a39 (1974\u201376), Monzen \u6587\u9078, 7 vols. , Tokyo: Sh\u016beisha.\n\nNakajima, Chiaki \u4e2d\u5cf6\u5343\u79cb (1977), Monzen: Fuhen \u6587\u9078: \u8ce6\u7bc7 , Tokyo: Meiji shoin.\n\nEnglish\n\nKnechtges, David R.

The book is therefore also called Zhaoming Wenxuan \u662d\u660e\u6587\u9078.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Liang period was a time when literature flourished. This apogee had been prepared since the Jian'an reign-period \u5efa\u5b89 (196-219) of the late Han era \u6f22 (206 BCE-220 CE). For the coming two centuries writers refined literary styles and developed new genres. The amount of literature produced between the 3rd and the 6th centuries was tremendous. During the Sui period \u968b (581-618) the imperial library (see the bibliography Jingji zhi \u7d93\u7c4d\u5fd7) included no less than 249 collections with a total size of 5,224 juan. There were also first attempts to think about literary theory during the Liu-Song period \u5289\u5b8b (420-479) when scholars of the state-sponsored faculties of Confucianism, Daoism, literature, historiography and mantic arts tried to standardize the writings in their respective fields. During the Jin period \u6649 (265-420), there were the literary anthologies Wenzhang liubie ji \u6587\u7ae0\u6d41\u522b\u96c6 by Zhi Yu \u646f\u865e (d. 311) and Hanlinlun \u7ff0\u6797\u8ad6 by Li Chong \u674e\u5145 (c. 400). The famous writer Liu Yiqing \u5289\u7fa9\u6176 (403-444) compiled the literary anthology Jilin \u96c6\u6797. All three books are unfortunately lost. Xiao Tong's Wenxuan is the oldest surviving anthology of fine literature.\n\nCompilation process\n\nXiao Tong gathered many excellent writers at his court with which he regularly conferred about literary theory and the ideal forms of writing. He disposed of a large library of almost 30,000 juan. The Prince himself was also an ardent writer, and his collected writings have a size of 20 juan, not including his commentaries and prefaces to other texts, with a volume of 10 fascicles. His anthology of five-syllable poems, for instance, is a book of 20 (or 19) juan called Wenzhang yinghua \u6587\u7ae0\u82f1\u83ef (also called Gujin shiyuan yinghua \u53e4\u4eca\u8a69\u82d1\u82f1\u83ef). The anthology Wenxuan has a size of 30 juan. It is possible that Wenzhang yinghua or Gujin shiyuan yinghua were just alternative titles of the Wenxuan (or a draft of it) because there is otherwise no testimony of these books, and they were \"lost\" before the Sui period. Xiao Tong was certainly not the only compiler of the Wenxuan, but it must be assumed that he selected the texts together with his retainers, among which persons are found that are also famous for commenting works on literature works, like Liu Xiaochuo \u5289\u5b5d\u7dbd (d. 539), Wang Yun \u738b\u7b60 (fl. 531), Yin Yun \u6bb7\u82b8 (471-529), Lu Chui \u9678\u5015 (470-526), Dao Qia \u5230\u6d3d (477-527) or Liu Xie \u5289\u52f0 (b. c. 465), author of the literary critique Wenxin diaolong \u6587\u5fc3\u96d5\u9f99.\n\nContent\n\nIn 30 juan the Wenxuan includes 514 writings of 130 authors from earliest times down to the very early Liang period. The writings are arranged in 38 genres, beginning with rhapsodies (fu \u8ce6) and the highly estimated genres of regular poems (shi \u8a69) and then going on to many categories of \"miscellaneous writings\" (zawen \u96dc\u6587; a more common term would be sanwen \u6563\u6587 \"prose\"). Below the level of genres or sub-genres, the writings are arranged chronologically. Poems and rhapsodies cover the largest part of the book. Because of their great amount the rhapsodies are therefore divided into 15 sub-categories, referring to places (the capital, palaces) or imperial activities, like offering, hunting, ploughing, etc. The many regular poems are likewise divided into 23 subgroups. The literary categories of the Wenxuan are very detailed, and the development of these presents a thorough new picture of how belles-lettres could be arranged in various types of writings, which was never done before.\n\nXiao Tong and his team only selected literary works and did not include any parts from the Confucian Classics, historiographical texts, or texts from the famous Warring-States-period \u6230\u570b (5th cent.-221 BCE) philosophers. Literary comments to such books (zanlun \u8d0a\u8ad6), nevertheless, were included in the Wenxuan. The criterion thus was literary beauty, well-tasted wording, composition of regular sentences, and an overall harmony. Later scholars often criticized Xiao Tong for including obscure (Tao Yuanming \u9676\u6df5\u660e, c. 365-427) or less important (Gushi shijiu shou \u53e4\u8a69\u5341\u4e5d\u9996) poems while omitting other, more important works. Some of the pieces included have later been found to be forgeries, like Li Ling's \u674e\u9675 (d. 74 BCE) Da Su Wu shu \u7b54\u8607\u6b66\u66f8 or Kong Anguo's \u5b54\u5b89\u570b (2nd cent. BCE) Shangshu xu \u5c1a\u66f8\u5e8f.\n\nSome paragraphs entitled as \"preface\" (xu \u5e8f) are not really prefaces, like Emperor Han Wudi's \u6f22\u6b66\u5e1d (r. 141-87 BCE) Qiufeng ci \u79cb\u98a8\u8fad, and some titles have nothing to to with the content, like Liu Jun's \u5289\u5cfb (463\u2014521) Chong da Liu Moling zhao shu \u91cd\u7b54\u5289\u79e3\u9675\u8a54\u66f8. There are also many clerical errors in the transmitted text of the Wenxuan.\n\nTable 1.

The study of the Wenxuan even developed into an own discipline (wenxuanxue \u6587\u9078\u5b78). The enormous development of the regular poem during the Tang period \u5510 (618-907) cannot be understood without the important study of Xiao Tong in this field. The ability to write poems became part of the state examinations, and this must be led back to the importance Xiao Tong posed on this type of literature. A profoundly educated scholar had to study the Wenxuan.\n\nCommentaries\n\nScholars also commented on the Wenxuan. Of the circa 90 commentaries from the Sui and Tang periods only very few have survived. The oldest commentary was written by Xiao Gai \u856d\u8a72 (c. 535-c. 610) during the Sui period, called Wenxuan yinyi \u6587\u9078\u97f3\u7fa9. A phonetic commentary with the same title was written during the early Tang by Cao Xian \u66f9\u61b2 (541-645). Both are lost. The oldest surviving \u2013 and most famous \u2013 commentary is Li Shan's \u674e\u5584 (630-689) Wenxuan zhu \u6587\u9078\u6ce8. In a lot of modern editions, this commentary is integrated into the main text of the Wenxuan. Li Shan's commentary is of extraordinary quality. Li used more then 1,700 books to revise and explain the difficult texts of the writings included in the Wenxuan. The Wenxuan zhu was submitted to the throne in 658. In general, Li's texts is rather a critical commentary than an explanation of the literary works. It makes use of and quotes from a lot of older commentaries to the particular writings, for instance, Xue Zong's \u859b\u7d9c (208-243) commentary on the rhapsody Erjing fu \u4e8c\u4eac\u8ce6 of Zhang Heng \u5f35\u8861 (78-139), or Wang Yi's \u738b\u9038 (c. 110 CE) commentary on Qu Yuan's \u5c48\u539f (c. 343-c. 278 BCE) elegies. Another book of Li Shan on the Wenxuan, the Wenxuan bianhuo \u6587\u9078\u8fa8\u60d1, is lost.\n\nAnother important Tang period commentary to the Wenxuan is the Wuchen zhu Wenxuan \u4e94\u81e3\u6ce8\u6587\u9078 \"Commentaries of the Five Masters\" from 718, a compound edition of commentaries by five persons, namely L\u00fc Yanji \u5442\u5ef6\u6fdf, Liu Liang \u5289\u826f, Zhang Xi \u5f35\u9291, L\u00fc Xiang \u5442\u5411 and Li Zhouhan \u674e\u5468\u7ff0. This commentary is rated as of a minor quality if compared to Li Shan's commentary. During the Song period \u5b8b (960-1279) the five commentaries and Li Shan's commentary were put together as Liuchen zhu \u516d\u81e3\u6ce8. Later scholars again distilled out Li Shan's book. Most modern publications containing Li Shan's commentary are based on these extractions. There is another Tang-period commentary written by an unknown master, the Wenxuan jizhu \u6587\u9078\u96c6\u6ce8 surviving in a fragment of 23 juan. It quotes from the other commentaries, but also from the notes of Lu Shanjing \u9678\u5584\u7d93 and from the books Wenxuan chao \u6587\u9078\u9214 and Wenxuan yinjue \u6587\u9078\u97f3\u6c7a, which are both lost.\n\nDuring the Song period, the study of the Wenxuan declined. There were, nonetheless, a few specialized research tools written, like Wenxuan shuangzi leiyao \u6587\u9078\u96d9\u5b57\u985e\u8981 or Wenxuan leilin \u6587\u9078\u985e\u6797. Some few studies can also be found scattered in various Song-period essays.\n\nThe Song-period encyclopaedia Wenyuan yinghua \u6587\u82d1\u82f1\u83ef is often called a continuation of the Wenxuan. It is arranged in a similar style and largely copies the literary categories of the Wenxuan.\n\nThere is the Yuan-period \u5143 (1279-1368) commentary Xuanshi buzhu \u9078\u8a69\u88dc\u6ce8 written by Liu L\u00fc \u5289\u5c65 and the Ming-period \u660e (1368-1644) book Wenxuan zuanzhu \u6587\u9078\u7e82\u6ce8 by Zhang Fengyi \u5f35\u9cf3\u7ffc (1527-1613). The wave of textual critique developing during the Qing period \u6e05 (1644-1911) also embraced the Wenxuan studies, and a few books from that time have to be mentioned: Wang Shihan's \u6c6a\u5e2b\u97d3 (1707-1780) Wenxuan lixue quanyu \u6587\u9078\u7406\u5b78\u6b0a\u8f3f, Sun Zhizu's \u5b6b\u5fd7\u7956 (1737-1801) Wenxuan lixue quanyu bu \u6587\u9078\u7406\u5b78\u6b0a\u8f3f\u88dc, Hu Kejia's \u80e1\u514b\u5bb6 (1757-1816) Wenxuan kaoyi \u6587\u9078\u8003\u7570, Zhang Yun'ao's \u5f35\u96f2\u7488 (1747-1829) Xuanxue jiaoyan \u9078\u5b78\u80f6\u8a00, Liang Zhangju's \u6881\u7ae0\u9245 (1775-1849) Wenxuan pangzheng \u6587\u9078\u65c1\u8b49, Zhu Jian's \u6731\u73d4 (1769-1850) Wenxuan jishi \u6587\u9078\u96c6\u91cb, Hu Shaoying's \u80e1\u7d39\u745b (1791-1860) Wenxuan jianzheng \u6587\u9078\u7b8b\u8b49, Xu Xunxing's (fl. 1793) \u8a31\u5dfd\u884c Wenxuan biji \u6587\u9078\u7b46\u8a18, He Zhuo's \u4f55\u712f (1661-1722) Yimen du shuji \u7fa9\u9580\u8b80\u66f8\u8a18, Yu Guanghua's \u4e8e\u5149\u83ef (fl. 1781) Wenxuan jiping \u6587\u9078\u96c6\u8a55, Gao Buying's \u9ad8\u6b65\u701b (1873-1940) Wenxuan Li zhu yishu \u6587\u9078\u674e\u6ce8\u7fa9\u758f and Luo Hongkai's \u99f1\u9e3f\u51f1 (1892-1955) Wenxuanxue \u6587\u9078\u5b78.\n\nVersions and editions\n\nThe oldest surviving versions of the Wenxuan are the above-mentioned Wenxuan jizhu from the Tang period, a plain text (without commentaries) from the Tang period, a version including Li Shan's commentary, and a phonetic commentary Wenxuan yin \u6587\u9078\u97f3. All have survived as fragments discovered in Dunhuang \u6566\u714c. Part of these fragments is included in the collections Mingshashishi guji congcan \u9cf4\u6c99\u77f3\u5ba4\u53e4\u7c4d\u53e2\u6b98 and Dunhuang miji liuzhen xinbian \u6566\u714c\u79d8\u7c4d\u7559\u771f\u65b0\u7de8. The oldest print of the Wenxuan was produced during the Northern Song period \u5317\u5b8b (960-1126). It is surviving as a facsimile edition in the series Sibu congkan \u56db\u90e8\u53e2\u520a, including the six commentaries. The Zhonghua Shuju Press \u4e2d\u83ef\u66f8\u5c40 has published a reprint of an edition from 1181 produced by You Mao \u5c24\u88a4 (1127-1194), including Li Shan's commentary. The most common version is the Qing-period print by Hu Kejia, based on You Mao's edition from the Song era. It has been republished in 1977 by the Zhonghua Shuju Press, enriched by a short critical study at the end.\n\nSupplements and sequels\n\nThe first sequel to the Wenxuan, called Wenxuan buyi \u6587\u9078\u88dc\u907a or Bu wenxuan \u88dc\u6587\u9078, was compiled by Chen Renzi \u9673\u4ec1\u5b50 (fl. 1279). The preface, written by Zhao Wen \u8d99\u6587, states that some types of texts found in the Wenxuan were not appropriate because of several political and philosophical reasons, namely Sima Changqing's \u53f8\u99ac\u9577\u537f (Sima Xiangru \u53f8\u99ac\u76f8\u5982, c. 179-117 BCE) Fengshan wen \u5c01\u79aa\u6587 on the sacrifices to Heaven and Earth, and Pan Yuanmao's \u6f58\u5143\u8302 (Pan Xun \u6f58\u52d6, d. 215\uff09Ce Wei Gong jiuxi wen \u518a\u9b4f\u516c\u4e5d\u932b\u6587 on the bestowal of the nine privileges to the warlord Cao Cao \u66f9\u64cd (155-220). Zhao also criticized that Prince Zhaoming had shortened Zhuge Liang's important memorial [Hou] chushi biao [\u5f8c]\u51fa\u5e2b\u8868. Zhao was also amazed that of the famous Nine Songs (Jiuge \u4e5d\u6b4c) of the Southern Elegies (Chuci \u695a\u8fad), only the text Shejiang \u6d89\u6c5f was accepted. He was furthermore critical to Prince Zhaoming\u2019s concept of the genre \"Treatises from the histories\" (shilun \u53f2\u8ad6), which should also extend to writings of the eminent historiographer Sima Qian \u53f8\u99ac\u9077 (c. 145-86 BCE).\n\nThe anthology of 40 juan length thus includes Sima Tan\u2019s \u53f8\u99ac\u8ac7 (190-110 BCE) Liujia yaozhi \u516d\u5bb6\u8981\u65e8 and Lu Zhonglian yi Yan jiang shu \u9b6f\u4ef2\u9023\u907a\u71d5\u5c07\u66f8, Liu Bang\u2019s \u5289\u90a6 (i.e. Han Gaozu \u6f22\u9ad8\u7956, r. 206-195 BCE) Honghu ge \u9d3b\u9d60\u6b4c, Yang Xiong\u2019s \u63da\u96c4 (53 BCE-18 CE) Fan Lisao \u53cd\u96e2\u9a37, Cai Yan\u2019s \u8521\u7430 (177-249) Hujia shiba pai \u80e1\u7b33\u5341\u516b\u62cd and the southern song Li Yannian ge \u674e\u5ef6\u5e74\u6b4c.\n\nThere exist several prints, namely the Dongshan Shuyuan \u6771\u5c71\u66f8\u9662 edition, a print from 1737, the version in the imperial series Siku quanshu \u56db\u5eab\u5168\u66f8, and a print from Hunan from 1826.\n\nDuring the Ming period, several supplements to Prince Zhaoming\u2019s Wenxuan were compiled. The oldest is Liu Jie\u2019s \u5289\u7bc0 (fl. 1520) Guang wenxuan \u5ee3\u6587\u9078. However, the authorship of Liu Jie cannot be substantiated because of several reasons. The preface (xu \u5e8f) speaks of a different size than the real book (60 juan), and might thus belong to a different collection. Moreover, the afterword (ba \u8dcb), written by Chen Hui \u9673\u8559 (jinshi degree 1529), criticizes the \"old version\" (jiu ben \u820a\u672c) of Liu Jie because of its many flaws, and states that Wang Zisong \u738b\u5b50\u677e, Lin Bi \u6797\u74a7, Zeng Chen \u66fe\u8fb0, and Li Shiyong \u674e\u4e16\u7528 revised this edition, eliminated some texts and added some others. It must thus be assumed that the Guang wenxuan was in fact edited by Chen Hui. Yet even after some revisions of Chen\u2019s team, the texts still includes many clerical errors and mistakes in the attribution of genres.\n\nAround 1600, Zhou Yingzhi \u5468\u61c9\u6cbb (1556-1621) compiled a further supplement, Guangguang wenxuan \u5ee3\u5ee3\u6587\u9078, with a length of 33 juan.\n\nA non-commentary supplement is Tang Shaozu\u2019s \u6e6f\u7d39\u7956 (fl. 1602) Xu wenxuan \u7e8c\u6587\u9078 from 1602. The book of 32 juan length assembles from the Tang period, and \u2013 strangely enough \u2013 the Ming period. Among the latter, most texts were written by the so-called \"Later Seven Masters\" (Houqizi \u5f8c\u4e03\u5b50), with the exception of Liu Ji \u5289\u57fa (1311-1375) and Gao Qi \u9ad8\u555f (1336-1373). The sub-categories of rhapsodies are fewer than in the original Wenxuan. The sections capital cities, suburban sacrifices, and ceremonial ploughing are not used, and the sub-category on Rivers and the Sea (Jianghai \u6c5f\u6d77) is changed to contain texts on \"Mountains and the sea\" (Shanhai \u5c71\u6d77). Quite surprising is the categorization of Lu Nanshou\u2019s \u76e7\u6960\u58fd rhapsody Chenggao wang fu \u6210\u768b\u738b\u8ce6 as a \"mind-text\" (zhi \u5fd7), and of Xu Zhenqing\u2019s \u5f90\u798e\u537f (1479-1511) Fanfan Lisao \u53cd\u53cd\u96e2\u9a37 as a \"treatise\" (lunwen \u8ad6\u6587).\n\nSun Kuang \u5b6b\u7926 (1542-1613) edited a \"modern\" Jin wenxuan \u4eca\u6587\u9078 with 12 fascicles. The last 5 fascicles are actually a supplement to the first seven, and therefore bear the headline Xuxuan \u7e8c\u9078. The anthology only includes texts of Ming-period writers.\n\nAnother \"modern\" collection was edited during the early Qing period by Chen Weisong \u9673\u7dad\u5d27 (1625-1682) and Pan Mei \u6f58\u7709 (fl. 1692). Even if the book has just a length of 8 juan, it includes several prefaces and a guideline (fanli \u51e1\u4f8b) summing up the principles of the compilation. The anthology includes writings of 75 person, many of whom had experienced difficulties and disasters (\"martyrs\", zhonglie \u5fe0\u70c8) in the last decades of the Ming period, like Xia Yunyi \u590f\u5141\u5f5d (1596-1645), Chen Zilong \u9673\u5b50\u9f8d (1608-1647), Jiang Dingrui \u6c5f\u9f0e\u745e (d. 1644), Zhao Erbian \u8d99\u800c\u6c74 (d. 1570), Wu Yingji \u5433\u61c9\u7b95 (1594-1645) or Zhou Lianggong \u5468\u4eae\u5de5 (1612-1672). Chen's anthology has therefore historiographical value. It was printed around 1648.\n\nLei Jin \u96f7\u7468 (1871-1941) edited another supplement called Xu wenxuan \u7e8c\u6587\u9078 with a length of 20 fascicles. It was published in 1919 by the Shanghai Zhonghua Tushuguan \u4e0a\u6d77\u4e2d\u83ef\u5716\u66f8\u9928 as a lithographical print. This anthology includes writings from the Liang to the Ming period. It attempts to rectify errors in Chen Renzi\u2019s Wenxuan buyi from the very late Song period, and adds commentaries on texts included in Tang Shaozu\u2019s Xu wenxuan from the Ming period, a book that only presents original texts without comments. The texts selected by Lei Jin differ in a few points from other sources of transmission.\n\nSources:\n\nChen Zhenghong \u9673\u6b63\u5b8f (1999). \"Wenxuan \u6587\u9078\", in Zhou Gucheng \u5468\u8c37\u57ce, ed.

He was the second son of eastern wei's paramount general Gao Huan, and the death of his brother and Gao Huan's designated successor Gao Cheng in 549 became the regent of eastern wei. In 550, he forced Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei to yield the throne to him, ending eastern wei and starting northern qi.\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for attentiveness to military matters, and the strength of the northern qi military was at its prime. He also tried to equalize the tax burden and reduce corruption by offering officials sufficient salary. He entrusted most governmental matters to the capable Yang Yin, and for a while, the government was effective, and the military was strong. However, Emperor Wenxuan eventually turned cruel, and his erratic behavior, fueled by alcoholism, plunged his administration into chaos.\n\n\n\nEarly life Gao Yang was born in 529, while his father Gao Huan was a Han chinese general under northern wei's paramount general Erzhu Rong. His mother Lou Zhaojun was Gao Huan's wife, on whose financial support Gao's early career had relied on. Lou Zhaojun was an ethnic Xianbei. He was their second son, after his older brother Gao Cheng. After Erzhu Rong's death in 530, Gao Huan overthrew Erzhu's family and became northern wei's paramount general, and after northern wei divided into eastern wei and western wei in 534 became the actual power controlling eastern wei. Gao Yang thus grew up in a household of power. In 535, he was created the Duke of Taiyuan.\n\nGao Yang was not well regarded as a child, as he was awkward in interpersonal skills and at times considered developmentally disabled, being unable to carry out many tasks common for children. However, it appeared that he was actually of fairly high capability in many areas, and once, when Gao Huan tried to test his children's intelligence by giving them tangled balls of yarn to untangle, Gao Yang took out his sword and sliced the ball open, stating that that was the only solution. As Gao Huan's sons grew older, on one occasion, Gao Huan wanted to test their military abilities by having his general Peng Le (\u5f6d\u6a02) launch a mock attack on them. All of Gao Huan's sons, including the older Gao Cheng, were fearful, but Gao Yang reacted calmly and actually captured Peng. As he grew, he continued to be awkward and appearing to be unintelligent, and Gao Cheng, in particular, often looked down on him.\n\nGao Huan died in 547, and thereafter, Gao Cheng, who had already controlled many aspects of eastern wei imperial government's operations, took over as regent. He moved to consolidate his power further, and when Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei tried to form a plot to kill him, he discovered the plot and put Emperor Xiaojing under effective house arrest. He then planned taking the throne himself, but at a meeting in 549 at the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan, Hebei ), with his officials Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212), and Yang Yin, to discuss the procedure for doing so, he was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac), who was angry at his wrongful treatment. At that time, Gao Yang happened to be in Yecheng, and he quickly gathered the guards and killed Lan and his co-conspirators. He chose not to announce Gao Cheng's death immediately, while moving to consolidate power.\n\n\n\nAs Eastern Wei regent Initially, Emperor Xiaojing, who had received rumors that Gao Cheng had died, thought he might have a chance to regain power. However, upon meeting Gao Yang, who made a display of force by having more than 200 guards accompany him, Emperor Xiaojing saw that Gao Yang could not be easily dealt with. Meanwhile, Gao Yang headed for the Gaos' stronghold of Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi ), and consolidated his military command there, quickly impressing the generals who had previously looked down on him with quick and careful decisions.\n\nIn fall and winter 549, with rival liang dynasty under internal turmoil after the rebellion of Hou Jing (a former eastern wei general who had defected to Liang in 547), Gao Yang sent Peng Le to attack the Liang border provinces, taking over the region between the Huai River and Yangtze River with ease.\n\nIn spring 550, Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing convey on him the greater title of Prince of Qi Commandery. Two months later, his title was made the even greater title of Prince of Qi.\n\nIn summer 550, under advice from the officials Gao Dezheng (\u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f), Xu Zhicai (\u5f90\u4e4b\u624d), and Song Jingye (\u5b8b\u666f\u696d), Gao Yang decided to take the throne, despite reservations from Gao Yang's mother Princess Dowager Lou. He therefore headed from Jinyang to Yecheng, but even as he was on the way and had reached the halfway city of Pingdu (\u5e73\u90fd, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi ), the officials largely pretended to ignore his overtures at taking the throne, so he returned to Jinyang. Soon thereafter, he had Emperor Xiaojing issue an edict conferring the nine bestowments on him, further displaying his posture of taking the throne. He then proceeded to Yecheng again, and Emperor Xiaojing yielded the throne to him, ending eastern wei and establishing northern qi, with Gao Yang as its Emperor Wenxuan. He created the former Emperor Xiaojing the Prince of Zhongshan. He posthumously honored Gao Huan and Gao Cheng as emperors, while honoring his mother as empress dowager.\n\n\n\nEarly reign Early in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for being attentive to important matters of state, particularly military matters. He revised eastern wei laws, and he selected elite soldiers from both Xianbei and Han ethnicities to form the border defense corps. To equalize the tax and labor burden, he divided the households under his rule into nine classes based on their wealth, requiring the wealthy to pay more taxes and the poor to contribute more labor. Continuing a trend set by both his father Gao Huan and his brother Gao Cheng, he divided his time between Yecheng and Jinyang, effectively making Jinyang a second capital.\n\nWhile Emperor Wenxuan was ethnically Han, like his father Gao Huan, he viewed himself as Xianbei rather than Han. Further, more than his father did, he looked down on Han traditions, not willing to follow them. Because of this, Gao Dezheng and another official, Gao Longzhi (\u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b), who wanted to ingratiate themselves with Emperor Wenxuan's cousin and powerful general Duan Shao (\u6bb5\u97f6), suggested he make Duan Shao's sister Lady Duan, a concubine of his, empress. Emperor Wenxuan did not follow their advice and, pursuant to expected norm, created his wife Princess Li Zu'e empress and created her son Gao Yin crown prince.\n\nIn response to the establishment of northern qi, Yuwen Tai, the paramount general of rival western wei, launched a major attack on northern qi. Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops to defend against Yuwen's attack. When Yuwen saw that Emperor Wenxuan's troops were well-organized, he sighed and stated, \"Gao Huan is not yet dead. \" He was unable to overcome Emperor Wenxuan's defense and so was forced to withdraw, and in fact lost some border commanderies to northern qi in the campaign.\n\nAround the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan wanted to put the former emperor, the Prince of Zhongshan, to death. He first invited his sister and the prince's wife, the Princess Taiyuan, to a feast. As soon as she left the prince's household, he sent assassins to force the prince to drink poison, and also killed his three sons. He buried the former emperor with imperial honors, but at a later point, for reasons unknown, he dug out the former emperor's casket and threw it into the Zhang River (\u6f33\u6c34, flowing near Yecheng).\n\nIn spring 552, Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops against the Kumo Xi tribe (in the upper Liao River drainage area) and achieved a great victory. Around the same time, he also sent generals to seize certain border cities with Liang, as Liang troops continued to battle Hou Jing, who declared himself the Emperor of Han in 551 but was subsequently defeated by Emperor Yuan of Liang in 552. The campaigns of seizing Liang cities continued even after Hou's defeat, although he did not at this point launch a single major attack on Liang. The campaigns appeared to end in winter 552, and Emperor Wenxuan in fact promised the Liang generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian, whom Emperor Yuan put in charge of the eastern half of Liang territory, to return the cities of Guangling (\u5ee3\u9675, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu ) and Liyang (\u6b77\u967d, in modern Chaohu, Anhui ).\n\nAlso in winter 552, Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops from Jinyang to Lishi (\u96e2\u77f3, in modern L\u00fcliang, Shanxi ), and he ordered the construction of a Great Wall from Huanglu Mountain (\u9ec3\u6ae8\u5dba, also in modern L\u00fcliang) to Sheping Fortress (\u793e\u5e73\u620d, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi ), apparently to defend against western wei and Tujue.\n\nIn winter 553, Khitan tribes were attacking northern qi's northern borders, and Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops to attack Khitan\u2014and on this campaign, he was described as personally exposing himself to the dangers and contributing much personally to defeating the Khitan.\n\nAlso in winter 553, Emperor Wenxuan, wanting to put northern qi-friendly emperor on the Liang throne, commissioned an army commanded by Guo yuanjian (\u90ed\u5143\u5efa) to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Tui (\u856d\u9000), who had surrendered to eastern wei in 548, back to Liang territory. However, northern qi forces were defeated by the Liang general Hou Tian (\u4faf\u7471), and Xiao Tui returned to Yecheng.\n\nAround the new year 554, the remnants of Rouran, which by that point was near its end, surrendered to northern qi to seek protection from Tujue attacks. Emperor Wenxuan personally attacked the Tujue, fighting its army off, and then created Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen as the new khan of Rouran, settling the Rouran people within northern qi territory, at Mayi (\u99ac\u9091, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi ).\n\nIn spring 554, Emperor Wenxuan, assisted by the senior general Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1) and his brother Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, launched a major attack on the Shanhu (\u5c71\u80e1) tribe (in modern L\u00fcliang). After victory, he ordered that all 11-year-old and older males of the Shanhu be slaughtered, and that the females and the young males be awarded as spoils of war to the soldiers. When one of his commanders died because that commander's lieutenant, Lu Huili (\u8def\u6689\u79ae), was unable to save him, Emperor Wenxuan ordered that Lu's internal organs be cut out of his body and that the soldiers consume them. Many traditional historians, including Li Yanshou (\u674e\u5ef6\u58fd), the author of the History of Northern Dynasties, and Sima Guang, the author of the Zizhi Tongjian, saw this battle as the turning point of Emperor Wenxuan's rule\u2014that thereafter, he began to act violently and capriciously. For example, in spring 554, when Rouran rebelled and he personally led troops to defeat Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen, he felt that warhorses offered by the general Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) the Prince of Anding were not of sufficient quality\u2014and he punished Heba by plucking out Heba's hair and demoting to commoner status, and further ordering Heba to serve as a worker in a coal processing facility. In another example, in fall 554, after he had put the official Yuan Xu (\u5143\u65ed), a former northern wei prince, to death, he remembered the snubs that Gao Longzhi, who was a friend of Yuan Xu's, had shown him before he became eastern wei's regent, and he had Gao Longzhi battered so severely that Gao Longzhi died several days later\u2014and at a later point, still angry at Gao Longzhi, arrested Gao Longzhi's 20 sons and, with 20 executioners lined up, had the sons beheaded simultaneously, and then threw their bodies and Gao Longzhi's body thrown into the Zhang River.\n\nStarting in 551, Emperor Wenxuan had ordered his official Wei Shou to compile a history of northern wei. Wei Shou completed the work in 554, but his work (Book of Wei) was criticized by many to be defamatory to ancestors of many political enemies (so much so that they referred to the work as Huishu (\u7a62\u66f8\u2014the Book of Filth)), and several officials filed reports condemning Wei Shou. Wei Shou submitted a petition to Emperor Wenxuan defending himself, and Emperor Wenxuan, in an act that he believed to be protecting the integrity of history, jailed the officials who condemned Wei Shou.\n\nIn late 554, western wei launched a major attack on Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei ), then the capital of Liang. Emperor Wenxuan commissioned an army commanded by Gao Huan's cousin Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3) the Prince of Qinghe to attack western wei's An Province (\u5b89\u5dde, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei ) to try to relieve pressure from Jiangling, but by the time that Gao Yue arrived, Jiangling had already fallen, and western wei captured and then executed Emperor Yuan.\n\n\n\nLate reign western wei declared Emperor Yuan's nephew Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang, but the declaration was not recognized by most Liang generals, and the chief of those generals, Wang Sengbian, welcomed Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an to the old Liang capital Jiankang, declaring him the Prince of Liang in spring 555 and preparing to make him emperor. Emperor Wenxuan had other ideas, however, and he created Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, whom eastern wei captured in 547 during Liang's attempt to aid Hou Jing's rebellion against eastern wei, emperor, commissioning his brother Gao Hu\u00e0n (\u9ad8\u6e19, note tone difference with his father) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Xiao Yuanming back to Liang territory. Emperor Wenxuan wrote letters to Wang recommending Xiao Yuanming as emperor, arguing that Xiao Fangzhi (who was 12 years old) was too young. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after Gao Huan won a few battles over Wang's generals, Wang decided to submit and, after northern qi escorting troops agreed to limit their presence to 1,000 men, and Xiao Yuanming agreed to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince, accepted Xiao Yuanming as emperor. To show his good faith, Wang sent his son Wang Xian (\u738b\u986f) and nephew Wang Shizhen (\u738b\u4e16\u73cd), as well as Wang Xian's mother Lady Liu, to Yecheng as hostages. Xiao Yuanming became Liang's emperor, and there was peace between northern qi and Liang, with Liang now a vassal.\n\nJust four months later, however, the situation changed. Wang Sengbian's lieutenant Chen Baxian, displeased over Xiao Yuanming's ascension (as he saw Xiao Yuanming's claim as being too attenuated), make a surprise attack on Jiankang from his headquarters of Jingkou (\u4eac\u53e3, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu ), killing Wang Sengbian and forcing Xiao Yuanming to yield the throne to Xiao Fangzhi (who took the throne as Emperor Jing). Initially, Chen claimed that Liang would still agree to be a vassal, and Emperor Wenxuan sent the official Sima Gong (\u53f8\u99ac\u606d) to swear an oath with Liang officials. However, with several generals loyal to Wang Sengbian rising against Chen following Wang's death, Emperor Wenxuan's mind changed, particularly after two, Xu Sihui (\u5f90\u55e3\u5fbd) and Ren Yue (\u4efb\u7d04) submitted to him, making a surprise attack on the near-Jiankang fortress Shitou and capturing it. Emperor Wenxuan sent the general Xiao Gui (\u856d\u8ecc) to reinforce Xu and Ren. Chen defeated northern qi troops and Xu and Ren, however, and Xiao Gui's assistant Liu Damo (\u67f3\u9054\u6469), sieged by Chen in Shitou, sought peace. Chen agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (\u9673\u66c7\u6717), Emperor Jing's nephew Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (\u738b\u73c9), the son of the key official Wang Chong (\u738b\u6c96), to serve as hostages to northern qi, allowing Liu to withdraw. (Upon Liu's return to northern qi, however, Emperor Wenxuan had him executed. )\n\nDuring the campaign against Liang, Emperor Wenxuan made another display of his increasing instability, as he, jealous over the fact that his concubine Consort Xue had previously had a sexual relationship with Gao Yue, ordered Gao Yue to commit suicide. Thereafter, he beheaded Consort Xue and hid her head in his sleeves. At a banquet later that day, he tossed her head onto a platter and cut her body into pieces, beginning to play with her leg, surprising all of the banquet attendants. At the end of the banquet, he packed her body parts and began crying, following the cart carrying her body on foot.\n\nIn fall 555, Emperor Wenxuan became convinced that Buddhism and Taoism should be but one religion, and that one of them should be merged into the other. He had the leading Buddhist and Taoist monks debate before him, and he declared the Buddhists the victors, ordering Taoism merged into Buddhism and Taoist monks to become Buddhist monks. Some Taoist monks initially rejected this edict, but after he executed four monks, the others submitted, and Taoism became banned within northern qi.\n\nIn spring 556, border battles between northern qi and Liang resumed, and northern qi prepared another campaign against Liang. In summer 556, northern qi forces were again south of the Yangtze, operating in Jiankang's vicinity, but they were stalemated against Liang troops, eventually defeated by Chen and his generals after they ran out of food. A number of northern wei generals were captured and executed by Liang, and in response, Emperor Wenxuan put Chen Tanlang to death.\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's erratic behavior became even greater in scope, fueled by his alcoholism. As described by Sima Guang in his Zizhi Tongjian: . . . [Emperor Wenxuan] drank heavily and lived immorality, carrying out cruel and barbarous act at his on whim. Sometimes he sang and danced day and night. Sometimes he spread his hair and wore barbarian clothing with colorful sashes. Sometimes he bared his body and put on makeup. Sometimes he rode donkeys, cows, camels, or elephants without using saddles. Sometimes he ordered Cui Jishu or Liu Taozhi (\u5289\u6843\u679d) to carry him and a large drum to allow him to beat the drums. He was accustomed to making surprise charges into the nobles' and imperial officials' private residences. He often crossed streets, sometimes sitting in the streets and sometimes even sleeping on them. Sometimes when it is warm, he would be naked to bask in the sun, but even in the coldest winter, he would strip naked as well and run around. His attendants could not stand his behavior, but he himself did not care. . . . Once, he asked a woman on the street, \"How is the Son of Heaven like?\" The woman responded, \"He is so crazy that he really cannot be considered a Son of Heaven. \" He beheaded her.\n\nOnce, when he was drunk and acting irrationally, Empress Dowager Lou rebuked him, and he threatened to marry her to an old barbarian. When she became angry, he became fearful, and he wanted to induce her to smile again, so he crawled on the ground under her seat, but in doing so, he flipped the seat over, and she was injured. After he sobered up, he realized how he had been injured, and he set a large fire, intending to jump in to die, causing her to have to grab him to save him. He thereafter pledged not to drink any more, but was only able to do so for 10 days before he began drinking again. He also once shot an arrow at Empress Li's mother Lady Cui and whipped her. Further, it was described that most women of the imperial Gao clan were forced to have sexual relations with him at one point or another. When Gao Huan's concubine Erzhu Ying'e, the Princess Dowager of Pengcheng, refused, he killed her with his own hands. Emperor Wenxuan also became homicidal when he drank, and he always wanted to kill people when he was drunk. Yang Yin, who was prime minister at this point, therefore set up a group of condemned prisoners to be available to the palace guards\u2014if Emperor Wenxuan wanted to kill someone, a condemned prisoner would be brought out for him to kill, and if a prisoner was able to survive for three months without being killed, he would be set free.\n\nHowever, even in his erratic behavior, Emperor Wenxuan was still attentive to many important matters, and because of his harshness, his officials did not dare to be corrupt. Further, Yang was a capable prime minister, and Emperor Wenxuan gave him full authorization to carry out laws properly. Therefore, it was said at the time that while the emperor was violent and insane, the government was nevertheless efficient.\n\nIn winter 557, believing prophecies that Gao Hu\u00e0n would be emperor, he ordered Gao Hu\u00e0n arrested. Gao Hu\u00e0n tried to resist, but was nevertheless captured and delivered to Yecheng. When another brother, Gao Jun (\u9ad8\u6d5a) the prince of Yong'an, sent petitions urging him to change his behavior, he had Gao Jun arrested as well, and the two princes were imprisoned in a dungeon.\n\nAlso in winter 557, Chen Baxian had Liang's Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing chen dynasty, and subsequently had Emperor Jing killed in 558. The general Wang Lin, then in control of modern Hunan and eastern Hubei , refused to submit to Chen and sought to continue Liang's lineage. He therefore requested northern qi to return Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia to be emperor. In spring 558, northern qi troops escorted Xiao Zhuang to Wang's territory, and Wang declared Xiao Zhuang emperor, as a northern qi vassal, with his capital at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan, Hubei ).\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's military campaigns and other wasteful behavior had caused the imperial treasury to be drained. He had also become unhappy with his son Gao Yin, believing that Gao Yin was too Han-like in behavior, and he considered deposing Gao Yin. Once, he ordered Gao Yin to personally execute a prisoner, but Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and Emperor Wenxuan battered him with a whip handle, causing Gao Yin to thereafter have a panic disorder and at times unable to speak. When Emperor Wenxuan became drunk, he would often state that he might eventually pass the throne to his brother Gao Yan, and he stopped stating as such only after urging by Yang and Wei Shou, who believed that his words were causing an unstabling effect in causing a doubt as to who would succeed him.\n\nAround the new year 559, Emperor Wenxuan visited the imprisoned Gao Jun and Gao Hu\u00e0n. He initially took pity on them and considered releasing them, but, at the urging of another brother, Gao Dan the Prince of Changguang, did not do so, and further started to pierce them with spears. He also ordered that torches be thrown at them, burning them to death. He rewarded the princes' wives to the soldiers who delivered the death blows.\n\nIn summer 559, Emperor Wenxuan, suspecting that the members of the northern wei imperial Yuan clan would eventually try to return to power, ordered the Yuans to be slaughtered, regardless of age or gender, and had the bodies thrown into the Zhang River. Only several households who were particularly close to the Gaos were spared.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne. \" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei. The officials tried to mourn at his death, but no one was actually able to shed a tear other than Yang Yin.\n\n"}, {"url": "http://silkqin.com/05poet/wenxuan.htm", "page_content": "Wen Xuan 1\n\nSelections of Refined Literature, compiled by Xiao Tong2 \u6587\u9078\n\n\u856d\u7d71\n\nDavid R.

In fact he took full advantage of the small school library where his father worked (as school principal) to read Soviet children\u2019s literature and modern Chinese literature.\n\nIn those years, the concept of literature for children was relatively new in China and the first children\u2019s works from foreign authors began to appear along with Chinese titles for the little ones.\n\nHis adolescence was marked by strong political tensions that culminated in the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), in which the majority of schools were closed and young Cao traveled the country as part of the Dachuanlian, \u5927\u4e32\u8054, a movement in which young activists were encouraged to spread the message of the revolution. Cao Wenxuan, however did not take part in the violent episodes since he was too young to do so (12-13 years old).\n\nLater, Cao returned to Jiangsu and enrolled at the University of Beijing (Beijing Daxue \u5317\u4eac\u5927\u5b66 where he graduated and where he still is a professor of Chinese literature and language, besides being director of doctorate thesis at the same university, director of the contemporary literature department, member of the Lu Xun Literature Institute, the Committee for children\u2019s literature and vice president of the Beijing Writer\u2019s Association.\n\nCao Wenxuan appears on the Chinese literary scene around the Eighties, setting his literary production in rural China during the Fifties and Sixties (the years of his childhood) and, for this reason, many of the stories he told were inspired by real things with particular references to stories of absolute poverty.\n\nOne of the principle characteristics of his works is being able to transform the experiences and memories of his childhood into literary creations, as the difficult life conditions he was forced to grow up in are firmly rooted in his works.\n\nSince the early days, Cao Wenxuan\u2019s literary opinions are on the front line in Chinese children\u2019s literature, still guiding the evolution of the concept of literature for children and young adults. His works have always captured and understood the emotional needs of youngsters, and as evidence he was repeatedly awarded the Bing Xin Award for children\u2019s literature and the Song Qingling Award for youth literature, prestigious literary awards for Chinese children\u2019s fiction.\n\nIn 1985, Cao Wenxuan proposed that children\u2019s writers are the formers of future national character and, in 2005, slightly modifying his original vision for children\u2019s literature, offered a new definition: \u201cThe mission of children\u2019s literature consists in establishing a good spiritual base for all humanity\u201d.\n\nAll this has allowed him to achieve, by unanimous ruling, the Hans Christian Andersen 2016 Award during the Children\u2019s Book Fair of Bologna, held between April 4 through 7, 2016. Repeating the words of the IBBY (International Board on Books for Young People, the entity responsible for assigning the Andersen Award), Cao is described as a very committed writer whose difficult childhood has influenced his writing.\n\nThis has allowed him to win such international recognition and not only seek the unique characteristic of this background that is China in his stories and feelings, in its people and landscapes, but also his ability to address the concept of suffering through the eyes of children. Everything is recounted with a stylistic ability that is the author\u2019s trademark, allowing him to be immediately recognizable within the international literary field.\n\nHis most representative works\n\n\u8349\u623f\u5b50 (Cao fangzi) \u201cThe Grass House\u201d \u2013 1997\n\nThis is one of Cao Wenxuan\u2019s first big novels, where rural Chinese society during the Seventies is presented through the eyes of Sang Sang, \u6851\u6851, the principal\u2019s son. Through his experiences it tells the story of friendship, love, pain and the growth of the village\u2019s inhabitants in a web of autobiographical pieces (the author himself is son of a principal and many of the places mentioned were inspired by places where the author grew up). This work was so successful that in 2000 it became a film directed by Xu Geng, \u5f90\u803f.\n\n\u6839\u9e1f (Genniao) \u201cThe Bird\u201d \u2013 1999\n\nIn this novel the story tells through dreams and reality the affairs of a country boy called Genniao \u6839\u9e1f. The protagonist, who lives in a peaceful rural village with his father, is determined to reach his dreams which fly over immense grasslands, deserts, mountains, villages and little cities, alluding in this way to the tribulations that a young man encounters during his growth. Every scene seems bizarre and confusing, but at the same time bears a strong symbolism.\n\n\u7ec6\u7c73 (Ximi) \u201cThe Thin Rice\u201d \u2013 2003\n\nThis work tells the story of Ximi, \u7ec6\u7c73, a boy who lives in a village on the banks of a stream. One day a sailboat reaches the shores of the stream, bringing with it a group of girls that seem as if they\u2019ve come directly from Heaven.

It\u2019s sort of a big fantasy novel that embraces all sorts of themes and detaches for certain verses from the typical themes and objectives of its literary production. The main character is a young shepherd that, with the help of the people, leads an entire army to conquer four mountains where the spirit, language, hearing and sight of the people reside, restoring vitality to the world around it.\n\n\u4e01\u4e01\u5f53\u5f53 (Dingding Dangdang) \u201cDingding and Dangdang\u201d \u2013 2012\n\nThis is a series of seven books that have as protagonists two children affected with Down Syndrome, Dingding and Dangdang, who come from the rural village of Linenfield (Youmadi, \u6cb9\u9ebb\u5730), the same village where The Grass House is set. One day Dangdang, at seven years old (Dingding is five years older than his little brother), gets lost at a crowded market. This alarms his older brother, who the day after decides to go looking for his little brother.\n\nAt this point the adventures begin for the two protagonists through mines, mountains, a flea circus, cities, rivers and fields, where they encounter all sorts of people, both good and bad.

This practice continued into the Song dynasty until the imperial examination reforms of the late 11th century.[17] In the mid-16th century, during the Ming dynasty, an abridged version of the Wen Xuan was created to help aspiring officials study composition for the eight-legged essays on Ming-era imperial exams.[19] Influence in Japan The Wen Xuan (Japanese: Mon-zen) was transmitted to Japan sometime after its initial publication and had become required reading for the Japanese aristocracy by the Heian period. Admired for its beauty, many terms from the Wen Xuan made their way into Japanese as loanwords and are still used.\n\nTranslations\n\nFrench Margouli\u00e8s, Georges (1926), Le \"Fou\" dans le Wen siuan: \u00c9tude et textes, Paris: Paul Geuthner.

It's a big deal inside China, where the media closely watches the progress of the prize.\n\nLike the Nobel, the prize is given to a writer for their entire oeuvre, not for any book in particular, but despite this everyone still points to works in particular. In this case, that's probably Bronze and Sunflower, translated by Helen Wang and published in the UK last year by Walker Books. In honor of the win, we conducted an email interview with Helen about her views on Cao's works (in case you didn't know, Helen is also one of the editors of Read Paper Republic, and is currently to be found representing PR at the London Book Fair). See below for the full interview.\n\nPaper Republic: Tragedy seems to be a consistent element of Cao Wenxuan's writing. Have you found that this makes his writing more or less accessible to Western audiences? My sense is that tragedy in children's fiction was once more acceptable to Western readers than it is now \u2013 do you think that's a fair assessment? Does Chinese children's fiction perhaps hearken back to an older Western tradition of children's literature?\n\nHelen Wang: When I first read Bronze and Sunflower, I was staying with my mother and sister, and I\u2019d read a chapter at a time and tell them what happened. During that first reading, it seemed as though something horrific happened in every chapter, and that Sunflower was a bit of a goody-goody, who never did anything wrong. At that stage, I didn\u2019t know how the story would come across in English. But as I was translating, the disasters seemed to move to the background, and it was the humanity that came to the fore. In Cao\u2019s writing, horrible things happen \u2013 they are part of life \u2013 but the story is always about how the characters deal with the situation, how they make difficult decisions, and how they take action. You might not agree with their decisions, but you understand the thinking behind them. People who\u2019ve read the story in English have mostly commented on the beauty and clarity of the language, the matter-of-fact-ness of the difficult situations, which they can visualise and to which they respond emotionally. These things seem to appeal more than tragedy. And everyone seems to love Nainai!\n\nBy tragedy, perhaps you are also thinking of the strict moral code in the older classics. In more recent children's fiction written in English the morals are more relative. My sense is that a lot of humour, especially dark humour, has crept into English children\u2019s books as well (for example, see the Lemony Snicket books). In China the moral ambiguity of these books probably doesn't sit too comfortably with the drive to \"raise the quality of the people\" (tigao renmin suzhi) and promote \"self-development\" (ziwo fazhan).\n\nPR: Can you tell us a bit about how the translation of Bronze and Sunflower came about? Did someone reach out to you? How did the publication come into being?\n\nHW: A fellow translator introduced me to the editor at Walker Books. She knew I had translated another children's book (Shen Shixi\u2019s Jackal and Wolf \u6c88\u77f3\u6eaa\uff1a\u300a\u7ea2 \u8c7a\u300b) for Egmont UK, 2012.\n\nWalker Books won a PEN Translation Award to publish Bronze and Sunflower. The PEN awards support the publishers: when publishers apply to English PEN for an award, they have to submit a copy of the original book, which is then read by an expert in the source language, who writes a report to the English PEN committee, which then chooses which titles to support. So, a huge amount of work went into the English PEN endorsement on the front of Bronze and Sunflower!\n\nPR: Some people on the Chinese internet are pointing out that Cao Wenxuan's writing often displays certain\u2026 outmoded gender attitudes. Can you talk a bit about this, from the point of view of the translator? Did you find any parts of the story a little uncomfortable from this point of view? Were any edits made?\n\nHW: I haven\u2019t seen the comments you mention, but I imagine they are referring to boys being described as bigger and stronger, and girls being described as smaller, weaker, and more prone to tears; and to boys looking after/rescuing/saving the girls. I\u2019ve found this in a number of Chinese children\u2019s books, including stories by Cao Wenxuan. Sometimes it stands out, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. Sometimes it\u2019s in the story, sometimes it\u2019s in the language. Sometimes it\u2019s sweet, sometimes it\u2019s offensive. The translator\u2019s role is to deliver the story in English \u2013 and if there are any concerns about sexism, racism, disability-ism or any-ism, then these should be raised with the editor. In Bronze and Sunflower I don\u2019t remember any edits made because of gender issues. Bronze is older than Sunflower, he has spent most of his life outdoors. Sunflower is younger, she\u2019s moved from the city to the countryside, and she has had to cope with so many awful things in her short life that I think it\u2019s OK if Bronze looks out for her, and helps her, and she bursts into tears now and then.\n\nPR: You've translated quite a bit of Chinese literature, including works by Zhang Xinxin, and by Shen Shixi, who is often referred to as a master of the \"animal story\" style of children's fiction. What do you see as some of the main differences between these writers' styles? How do you see them as representing Chinese children's literature as a whole?\n\nHW: Shen Shixi is a hugely popular writer in China, whose animal stories are full of action and tension. Like Cao Wenxuan, he presents his story in a matter-of-fact way, and his books are not for the squeamish. Jackal and Wolf is about a mother jackal who takes in a baby wolf cub (whose mother has just killed the jackal\u2019s two cubs), intending to suckle her, fatten her up and, in due course, eat her. Of course, she can never bring herself to do that. An awkward mother-daughter relationship develops, further complicated by the fact that jackals and wolves don\u2019t get on. The graphic descriptions combined with anthropomorphism from a Chinese point of view seem to hook some readers and repel others. My sense is that English readers either love this book or hate it, and it\u2019s pretty much split down the middle!\n\nMaybe it's helpful to share a couple of pieces of real feedback? To quote Frances Weightman, of the Writing Chinese project at the University of Leeds, who liked it, \"I found Jackal and Wolf a fascinating read both for the plot itself, and for the way in which it made me reconsider my expectations of \u2018children\u2019s fiction\u2019, and particularly stories about animals. I came to the book fully expecting the animals to be anthropomorphic, which of course they were. But while a common criticism of Chinese fiction is that it can be excessively sentimental, Shen\u2019s depiction of his animals, through Helen Wang\u2019s vivid and fluent translation, retains the brutality of their nature in a very unsentimental, realistic way. The jackal and the wolf initially do what it is in their nature to do, and as such the depictions of their \u2018inhumanity\u2019 are relentless and shocking, but yet the relationship they form as the plot develops is extremely human.\" Those who didn't like the book mostly said the same things, but found it offputting rather than fascinating. Often people couldn't work out who the target audience might be, eg see this review by Outside In World \"The only reservation with this novel of 281 pages, is what age to pitch it at and that possibly there is not enough of a storyline for an English audience. As descriptive as it is, there is a vast amount of text dealing with the hunting and fighting scenes, which may not appeal to everyone. Having said that, Jackal and Wolf is a touching animal fable about two mortal enemies that will give an insight into the wildlife existing in a remote part of China together with their concepts of nature and morality.\"\n\nZhang Xinxin has written a graphic novel for children called Pai Huazi and the Clever Girl, based on her own childhood in Beijing on the eve of the Cultural Revolution. She also translated War Horse for the Chinese stage. But she\u2019s better known for her writing for adults, her TV, film and theatre work, and for her online reviews of films and books on weibo. I'm convinced she functions at superhuman speed; translating her most recent work IT84 was an intensely rewarding experience.\n\nCao Wenxuan and Shen Shixi are consistently in the Top 20 bestselling children\u2019s books in China. Another very popular writer is Yang Hongying, famous for her Diary of a Smiling Cat and Naughty Boy Ma Xiaotiao series. There are always some translated titles too. Currently in the top ten (and consistently on the bestseller list) are Charlotte\u2019s Web (E.B. White) and Totto-chan, Little Girl at the Window (Tetsuro Kuroyanagi) \u2013 both are wonderful books, beautifully written, with wholesome stories. But that\u2019s not to say that these are the only books that Chinese children like! By far the bestselling children\u2019s author in China is Leon Image, who has 5 adventure fantasy books in the top ten (2 x Charlie IX and Dodomo books, 2 x The Incredible Case Files, and 1 x Monster Magic).\n\nTop-10 bestselling children\u2019s books, for the week 13-20 March 2016:\n\nCharlotte\u2019s Web \u2013 E.B.

This story \u2013 and much of Cao Wenxuan's writing in general \u2013 strikes me as actually very adult. The characters are children, the plots are ostensibly children's stories, but in fact the story is touching on Chinese society as a whole during the time when it was set -- the 50s and 60s. Do you think Cao's writing has a larger significance for Chinese society?\n\nHW: Cao Wenxuan is known as a writer of books for children, but he says he writes for everyone. He writes beautifully and with compassion. In the stories I\u2019ve read so far, the main characters are usually social outcasts, but not of their own making. They may be very poor, or have a father who drinks or gambles - whatever the reason, society shuns them or is wary of them. Yet, they have done nothing wrong, and they have to find a way to live too. Cao Wenxuan\u2019s characters are never 100% good or 100% bad, and this allows for shifts in the relationships. The stories can take place over months or years: we learn the origins of the social rejection, we see how the ostracised find their way, we watch them grow and assert their identity, and, crucially, see how society can open up and find a space for them. The stories are strong, positive and empowering.\n\nI hadn\u2019t really thought about it before, but in the stories I\u2019ve read so far, the mothers are usually absent or in the background, the fathers are often drinkers or gamblers. When there are grandmothers, they are rock solid characters. But it is the social outcast \u2013 the individual \u2013 who makes the breakthrough.\n\nPR: In China it's often assumed that children's book purchases are largely driven by parents, who are choosing books that they think are \"good for\" their kids. In Western markets, on the other hand, it seems to be the children who are driving purchases. Do you think this has an influence on the types of stories that are prevalent in these markets?\n\nHW: I think a lot of children's books everywhere (not just in China) are bought by parents, family and friends, and the kind of family and friends who are likely to buy books for children are also likely to think education is important. So maybe it's a question of what kind of education is valued? It's revealing that Totto-chan, Little Girl at the Window is also consistently in the list of bestselling children's books in China. It's a true story, about a little Japanese girl (the author) who was expelled from regular Japanese schools for not conforming, but who thrived at Tomoe Gakuen school, where children were encouraged to learn by following their own interests. Perhaps the popularity of this book is associated with frustrations with the regular Chinese education system and the establishment of smaller private schools? And with the drive to encourage more creative thinking? It's a lovely book, but I suspect it's being bought and read by adults rather than children \u2013 it's a big deal to remove your child from mainstream education and \"experiment\" with their education, and this book might inspire confidence.\n\nI recently came across the interactive book Dinosaur Express Delivery, by Dong Yanan (\u8463\u4e9a\u6960 : \u300a\u6050\u9f99\u5feb\u9012\u300b), which is quite explicit about the reader needing to combine knowledge and imagination in order to enjoy a journey through Dinosaur World. There's been a sea-change in Chinese children's books in recent years - the quality of production is stunning, there's a greater range of books hitting the spot between education and entertainment, and there are some delightful picture books for very young children. These books simply didn't exist before. The ones I've seen are full of positive things, the goodies and baddies are clearly defined, and so on. As for children choosing books for themselves, I think children in the UK and the USA probably have greater access to lending libraries than in China \u2013 public libraries and school libraries, where you can borrow books and take them home (without paying a rental fee). In these libraries, children are usually free to browse and choose whichever books they like (think of Matilda, by Roald Dahl, \"From then on, Matilda would visit the library only once a week in order to take out new books and return the old ones\")."}, {"url": "https://paper-republic.org/pers/cao-wenxuan/", "page_content": "wikipedia | worldcat | MCLC | academia | baidu | douban | MyChineseBooks.com |\n\nOne of China's most popular authors of children's fiction, Cao Wenxuan's works are typically set in the China of the 1950s and 60s, and feature children and animals as their main characters.

He was the second son of Eastern Wei 's paramount general Gao Huan . Following the death of his brother and Gao Huan's designated successor an eldest son Gao Cheng in 549, Gao Yang became the regent of Eastern Wei. In 550, he forced Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei to yield the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and starting Northern Qi.\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for attentiveness to military matters, and the strength of the Northern Qi military was at its prime. He also tried to equalize the tax burden and reduce corruption by offering officials sufficient salary. He entrusted most governmental matters to the capable Yang Yin, and for a while, the government was effective, and the military was strong. In his later years, Emperor Wenxuan suffered from alcoholism and possibly insanity.

His mother Lou Zhaojun was Gao Huan's wife, on whose financial support Gao's early career had relied on. Lou Zhaojun was from a wealthy Xianbei family. He was their second son, after his older brother Gao Cheng. After Erzhu Rong's death in 530, Gao Huan overthrew Erzhu's family and became Northern Wei's paramount general, and after Northern Wei divided into Eastern Wei and Western Wei in 534 became the actual power controlling Eastern Wei. Gao Yang thus grew up in a household of power. In 535, he was created the Duke of Taiyuan (\u592a\u539f\u516c).\n\nGao Yang was not well regarded as a child, as he was awkward in interpersonal skills and at times considered developmentally disabled, being unable to carry out many tasks common for children, though it appears that he feigned this to prevent suspicion of his elder brother. It appeared that he was actually of fairly high capability in many areas, and once, when Gao Huan tried to test his children's intelligence by giving them tangled balls of yarn to untangle, Gao Yang took out his sword and sliced the ball open, stating that that was the only solution. As Gao Huan's sons grew older, on one occasion, Gao Huan wanted to test their military abilities by having his general Peng Le (\u5f6d\u6a02) launch a mock attack on them. All of Gao Huan's sons, including the older Gao Cheng, were fearful, but Gao Yang reacted calmly and actually captured Peng. As he grew, he continued to be awkward and appearing to be unintelligent, and Gao Cheng, in particular, often looked down on him.\n\nGao Huan died in 547, and thereafter, Gao Cheng, who had already controlled many aspects of Eastern Wei imperial government's operations, took over as regent. He moved to consolidate his power further, and when Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei tried to form a plot to kill him, he discovered the plot and put Emperor Xiaojing under effective house arrest. He then planned taking the throne himself, but at a meeting in 549 at the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan, Hebei), with his officials Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212), and Yang Yin, to discuss the procedure for doing so, he was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac), who was angry at his wrongful treatment. At that time, Gao Yang happened to be in Yecheng, and he quickly gathered the guards and killed Lan and his co-conspirators. He chose not to announce Gao Cheng's death immediately, while moving to consolidate power.\n\nAs Eastern Wei regent\n\nInitially, Emperor Xiaojing, who had received rumors that Gao Cheng had died, thought he might have a chance to regain power. However, upon meeting Gao Yang, who made a display of force by having more than 8000 guards accompany him, Emperor Xiaojing saw that Gao Yang could not be easily dealt with. Meanwhile, Gao Yang headed for the Gaos' stronghold of Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), and consolidated his military command there, quickly impressing the generals who had previously looked down on him with quick and careful decisions.\n\nIn fall and winter 549, with rival Liang Dynasty under internal turmoil after the rebellion of Hou Jing (a former Eastern Wei general who had defected to Liang in 547), Gao Yang sent Peng Le to attack the Liang border provinces, taking over the region between the Huai River and Yangtze River with ease.\n\nIn spring 550, Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing convey on him the greater title of Prince of Qi Commandery. Two months later, his title was made the even greater title of Prince of Qi.\n\nIn summer 550, under advice from the officials Gao Dezheng (\u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f), Xu Zhicai (\u5f90\u4e4b\u624d), and Song Jingye (\u5b8b\u666f\u696d), Gao Yang decided to take the throne, despite reservations from Gao Yang's mother Princess Dowager Lou. He therefore headed from Jinyang to Yecheng, but even as he was on the way and had reached the halfway city of Pingdu (\u5e73\u90fd, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi), the officials largely pretended to ignore his overtures at taking the throne, so he returned to Jinyang. Soon thereafter, he had Emperor Xiaojing issue an edict conferring the nine bestowments on him, further displaying his posture of taking the throne. He then proceeded to Yecheng again, and Emperor Xiaojing yielded the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and establishing Northern Qi, with Gao Yang as its Emperor Wenxuan. He created the former Emperor Xiaojing the Prince of Zhongshan. He posthumously honored Gao Huan and Gao Cheng as emperors, while honoring his mother as empress dowager.\n\nEarly reign\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for being attentive to important matters of state, particularly military matters. He revised Eastern Wei laws, and he selected elite soldiers from both Xianbei and Han ethnicities to form the border defense corps. To equalize the tax and labor burden, he divided the households under his rule into nine classes based on their wealth, requiring the wealthy to pay more taxes and the poor to contribute more labor. Continuing a trend set by both his father Gao Huan and his brother Gao Cheng, he divided his time between Yecheng and Jinyang, effectively making Jinyang a second capital.\n\nJust like his father Gao Huan, Emperor Wenxuan viewed himself as more of a Xianbei rather than Chinese. Further, more than his father did, he was not willing to follow most of the Chinese traditions. Because of this, Gao Dezheng and another official, Gao Longzhi (\u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b), who wanted to ingratiate themselves with Emperor Wenxuan's cousin and powerful general Duan Shao (\u6bb5\u97f6), suggested he make Duan Shao's sister Lady Duan, a concubine of his, empress. Emperor Wenxuan did not follow their advice and, pursuant to expected norm, created his wife Princess Li Zu'e empress and created her son Gao Yin crown prince.\n\nIn response to the establishment of Northern Qi, Yuwen Tai, the paramount general of rival Western Wei, launched a major attack on Northern Qi. Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops to defend against Yuwen's attack. When Yuwen saw that Emperor Wenxuan's troops were well-organized, he sighed and stated, \"Gao Huan is not yet dead.\" He was unable to overcome Emperor Wenxuan's defense and so was forced to withdraw, and in fact lost some border commanderies to Northern Qi in the campaign.\n\nAround the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan wanted to put the former emperor, the Prince of Zhongshan, to death. He first invited his sister and the prince's wife, the Princess Taiyuan, to a feast. As soon as she left the prince's household, he sent assassins to force the prince to drink poison, and also killed his three sons. He buried the former emperor with imperial honors, but at a later point, for reasons unknown, he dug out the former emperor's casket and threw it into the Zhang River (\u6f33\u6c34, flowing near Yecheng).\n\nIn spring 552, Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops against the Kumo Xi tribe (in the upper Liao River drainage area) and achieved a great victory. Around the same time, he also sent generals to seize certain border cities with Liang, as Liang troops continued to battle Hou Jing, who declared himself the Emperor of Han in 551 but was subsequently defeated by Emperor Yuan of Liang in 552. The campaigns of seizing Liang cities continued even after Hou's defeat, although he did not at this point launch a single major attack on Liang. The campaigns appeared to end in winter 552, and Emperor Wenxuan in fact promised the Liang generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian, whom Emperor Yuan put in charge of the eastern half of Liang territory, to return the cities of Guangling (\u5ee3\u9675, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) and Liyang (\u6b77\u967d, in modern Chaohu, Anhui).\n\nAlso in winter 552, Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops from Jinyang to Lishi (\u96e2\u77f3, in modern L\u00fcliang, Shanxi), and he ordered the construction of a great wall from Huanglu Mountain (\u9ec3\u6ae8\u5dba, also in modern L\u00fcliang) to Sheping Fortress (\u793e\u5e73\u620d, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi), apparently to defend against Western Wei and Tujue.\n\nIn winter 553, Khitan tribes were attacking Northern Qi's northern borders, and Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops to attack Khitan\u2014and on this campaign, he was described as personally exposing himself to the dangers and contributing much personally to defeating the Khitan.\n\nAlso in winter 553, Emperor Wenxuan, wanting to put Northern Qi-friendly emperor on the Liang throne, commissioned an army commanded by Guo Yuanjian (\u90ed\u5143\u5efa) to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Tui (\u856d\u9000), who had surrendered to Eastern Wei in 548, back to Liang territory. However, Northern Qi forces were defeated by the Liang general Hou Tian (\u4faf\u7471), and Xiao Tui returned to Yecheng.\n\nAround the new year 554, the remnants of Rouran, which by that point was near its end, surrendered to Northern Qi to seek protection from Tujue attacks. Emperor Wenxuan personally attacked the Tujue, fighting its army off, and then created Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen as the new khan of Rouran, settling the Rouran people within Northern Qi territory, at Mayi (\u99ac\u9091, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi).\n\nIn spring 554, Emperor Wenxuan, assisted by the senior general Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1) and his brother Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, launched a major attack on the Shanhu (\u5c71\u80e1) tribe (in modern L\u00fcliang). After victory, he ordered that all 11-year-old and older males of the Shanhu be slaughtered, and that the females and the young males be awarded as spoils of war to the soldiers. When one of his commanders died because that commander's lieutenant, Lu Huili (\u8def\u6689\u79ae), was unable to save him, Emperor Wenxuan ordered that Lu's internal organs be cut out of his body and that the soldiers consume them. Many traditional historians, including Li Yanshou (\u674e\u5ef6\u58fd), the author of the History of Northern Dynasties, and Sima Guang, the author of the Zizhi Tongjian, saw this battle as the turning point of Emperor Wenxuan's rule\u2014that thereafter, he began to act violently and capriciously. For example, in spring 554, when Rouran rebelled and he personally led troops to defeat Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen, he felt that warhorses offered by the general Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) the Prince of Anding were not of sufficient quality\u2014and he punished Heba by plucking out Heba's hair and demoting to commoner status, and further ordering Heba to serve as a worker in a coal processing facility. In another example, in fall 554, after he had put the official Yuan Xu (\u5143\u65ed), a former Northern Wei prince, to death, he remembered the snubs that Gao Longzhi, who was a friend of Yuan Xu's, had shown him before he became Eastern Wei's regent, and he had Gao Longzhi battered so severely that Gao Longzhi died several days later\u2014and at a later point, still angry at Gao Longzhi, arrested Gao Longzhi's 20 sons and, with 20 executioners lined up, had the sons beheaded simultaneously, and then threw their bodies and Gao Longzhi's body into the Zhang River.\n\nStarting in 551, Emperor Wenxuan had ordered his official Wei Shou to compile a history of Northern Wei. Wei Shou completed the work in 554, but his work (Book of Wei) was criticized by many to be defamatory to ancestors of many political enemies (so much so that they referred to the work as Huishu (\u7a62\u66f8\u2014the Book of Filth)), and several officials filed reports condemning Wei Shou. Wei Shou submitted a petition to Emperor Wenxuan defending himself, and Emperor Wenxuan, in an act that he believed to be protecting the integrity of history, jailed the officials who condemned Wei Shou.\n\nIn late 554, Western Wei launched a major attack on Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), then the capital of Liang. Emperor Wenxuan commissioned an army commanded by Gao Huan's cousin Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3) the Prince of Qinghe to attack Western Wei's An Province (\u5b89\u5dde, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei) to try to relieve pressure from Jiangling, but by the time that Gao Yue arrived, Jiangling had already fallen, and Western Wei captured and then executed Emperor Yuan.\n\nLate reign\n\nWestern Wei declared Emperor Yuan's nephew Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang (known in history as the Western Liang), but the declaration was not recognized by most Liang generals, and the chief of those generals, Wang Sengbian, welcomed Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an to the old Liang capital Jiankang, declaring him the Prince of Liang in spring 555 and preparing to make him emperor. Emperor Wenxuan had other ideas, however, and he created Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, whom Eastern Wei captured in 547 during Liang's attempt to aid Hou Jing's rebellion against Eastern Wei, emperor, commissioning his brother Gao Hu\u00e0n (\u9ad8\u6e19, note tone difference with his father) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Xiao Yuanming back to Liang territory. Emperor Wenxuan wrote letters to Wang recommending Xiao Yuanming as emperor, arguing that Xiao Fangzhi (who was 12 years old) was too young. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after Gao Huan won a few battles over Wang's generals, Wang decided to submit and, after Northern Qi escorting troops agreed to limit their presence to 1,000 men, and Xiao Yuanming agreed to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince, accepted Xiao Yuanming as emperor. To show his good faith, Wang sent his son Wang Xian (\u738b\u986f) and nephew Wang Shizhen (\u738b\u4e16\u73cd), as well as Wang Xian's mother Lady Liu, to Yecheng as hostages. Xiao Yuanming became Liang's emperor, and there was peace between Northern Qi and Liang, with Liang now a vassal.\n\nJust four months later, however, the situation changed. Wang Sengbian's lieutenant Chen Baxian, displeased over Xiao Yuanming's ascension (as he saw Xiao Yuanming's claim as being too attenuated), make a surprise attack on Jiankang from his headquarters of Jingkou (\u4eac\u53e3, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), killing Wang Sengbian and forcing Xiao Yuanming to yield the throne to Xiao Fangzhi (who took the throne as Emperor Jing). Initially, Chen claimed that Liang would still agree to be a vassal, and Emperor Wenxuan sent the official Sima Gong (\u53f8\u99ac\u606d) to swear an oath with Liang officials. However, with several generals loyal to Wang Sengbian rising against Chen following Wang's death, Emperor Wenxuan's mind changed, particularly after two, Xu Sihui (\u5f90\u55e3\u5fbd) and Ren Yue (\u4efb\u7d04) submitted to him, making a surprise attack on the near-Jiankang fortress Shitou and capturing it. Emperor Wenxuan sent the general Xiao Gui (\u856d\u8ecc) to reinforce Xu and Ren. Chen defeated Northern Qi troops and Xu and Ren, however, and Xiao Gui's assistant Liu Damo (\u67f3\u9054\u6469), sieged by Chen in Shitou, sought peace. Chen agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (\u9673\u66c7\u6717), Emperor Jing's nephew Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (\u738b\u73c9), the son of the key official Wang Chong (\u738b\u6c96), to serve as hostages to Northern Qi, allowing Liu to withdraw. (Upon Liu's return to Northern Qi, however, Emperor Wenxuan had him executed.)\n\nDuring the campaign against Liang, Emperor Wenxuan made another display of his increasing instability, as he, jealous over the fact that his concubine Consort Xue had previously had a sexual relationship with Gao Yue, ordered Gao Yue to commit suicide. Thereafter, he beheaded Consort Xue and hid her head in his sleeves. At a banquet later that day, he tossed her head onto a platter and cut her body into pieces, beginning to play with her leg, which he converted into a fiddle, surprising all of the banquet attendants. At the end of the banquet, he packed her body parts and began crying, following the cart carrying her body on foot.\n\nIn fall 555, Emperor Wenxuan became convinced that Buddhism and Taoism should be but one religion, and that one of them should be merged into the other. He had the leading Buddhist and Taoist monks debate before him, and he declared the Buddhists the victors, ordering Taoism merged into Buddhism and Taoist monks to become Buddhist monks. Some Taoist monks initially rejected this edict, but after he executed four monks, the others submitted, and Taoism became banned within Northern Qi.\n\nIn spring 556, border battles between Northern Qi and Liang resumed, and Northern Qi prepared another campaign against Liang. In summer 556, Northern Qi forces were again south of the Yangtze, operating in Jiankang's vicinity, but they were stalemated against Liang troops, eventually defeated by Chen and his generals after they ran out of food. A number of Northern Wei generals were captured and executed by Liang, and in response, Emperor Wenxuan put Chen Tanlang to death.\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's erratic behavior became even greater in scope, fueled by his alcoholism. As described by Sima Guang in his Zizhi Tongjian:\n\n:... Wenxuan drank heavily and lived immorality, carrying out cruel and barbarous act at his on whim. Sometimes he sang and danced day and night. Sometimes he spread his hair and wore barbarian clothing with colorful sashes. Sometimes he bared his body and put on makeup. Sometimes he rode donkeys, cows, camels, or elephants without using saddles. Sometimes he ordered Cui Jishu or Liu Taozhi (\u5289\u6843\u679d) to carry him and a large drum to allow him to beat the drums. He was accustomed to making surprise charges into the nobles' and imperial officials' private residences. He often crossed streets, sometimes sitting in the streets and sometimes even sleeping on them. Sometimes when it is warm, he would be naked to bask in the sun, but even in the coldest winter, he would strip naked as well and run around. His attendants could not stand his behavior, but he himself did not care. ... Once, he asked a woman on the street, \"How is the Son of Heaven like?\" The woman responded, \"He is so crazy that he really cannot be considered a Son of Heaven.\" He beheaded her.\n\nOnce, when he was drunk and acting irrationally, his mother Empress Dowager Lou rebuked him, and he threatened to marry her to an old barbarian. When she became angry, he became fearful, and he wanted to induce her to smile again, so he crawled on the ground under her seat, but in doing so, he flipped the seat over, and she was injured. After he sobered up, he realized how she had been injured, and he set a large fire, intending to jump in to die, causing her to have to grab him to save him. He thereafter pledged not to drink any more, but was only able to do so for 10 days before he began drinking again. He also once shot an arrow at Empress Li's mother Lady Cui and whipped her. Further, it was described that most women of the imperial Gao clan were forced to have sexual relations with him at one point or another. When Gao Huan's concubine Erzhu Ying'e, the Princess Dowager of Pengcheng, refused, he killed her with his own hands. Emperor Wenxuan also became homicidal when he drank, and he always wanted to kill people when he was drunk. Yang Yin, who was prime minister at this point, therefore set up a group of condemned prisoners and a saw to be available to the palace guards\u2014if Emperor Wenxuan wanted to kill someone, a condemned prisoner would be brought out for him to kill, and if a prisoner was able to survive for three months without being killed, he would be set free.\n\nHowever, even in his erratic behavior, Emperor Wenxuan was still attentive to many important matters, and because of his harshness, his officials did not dare to be corrupt. Further, Yang was a capable prime minister, and Emperor Wenxuan gave him full authorization to carry out laws properly. Therefore, it was said at the time that while the emperor was violent and insane, the government was nevertheless efficient.\n\nIn winter 557, believing prophecies that Gao Hu\u00e0n would be emperor, he ordered Gao Hu\u00e0n arrested. Gao Hu\u00e0n tried to resist, but was nevertheless captured and delivered to Yecheng. When another brother, Gao Jun (\u9ad8\u6d5a) the prince of Yong'an, sent petitions urging him to change his behavior, he had Gao Jun arrested as well, and the two princes were imprisoned in a dungeon.\n\nAlso in winter 557, Chen Baxian had Liang's Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing Chen Dynasty, and subsequently had Emperor Jing killed in 558. The general Wang Lin, then in control of modern Hunan and eastern Hubei, refused to submit to Chen and sought to continue Liang's lineage. He therefore requested Northern Qi to return Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia to be emperor. In spring 558, Northern Qi troops escorted Xiao Zhuang to Wang's territory, and Wang declared Xiao Zhuang emperor, as a Northern Qi vassal, with his capital at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan, Hubei).\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's military campaigns and other wasteful behavior had caused the imperial treasury to be drained. He had also become unhappy with his son Gao Yin, believing that Gao Yin was too Han-like in behavior, and he considered deposing Gao Yin. Once, he ordered Gao Yin to personally execute a prisoner, but Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and Emperor Wenxuan battered him with a whip handle, causing Gao Yin to thereafter have a panic disorder and at times unable to speak. When Emperor Wenxuan became drunk, he would often state that he might eventually pass the throne to his brother Gao Yan, and he stopped stating as such only after urging by Yang and Wei Shou, who believed that his words were causing an unstabling effect in causing a doubt as to who would succeed him.\n\nAround the new year 559, Emperor Wenxuan visited the imprisoned Gao Jun and Gao Hu\u00e0n. He initially took pity on them and considered releasing them, but, at the urging of another brother, Gao Zhan the Prince of Changguang, did not do so, and further started to pierce them with spears. He also ordered that torches be thrown at them, burning them to death. He rewarded the princes' wives to the soldiers who delivered the death blows.\n\nIn summer 559, Emperor Wenxuan, suspecting that the members of the Northern Wei imperial Yuan clan would eventually try to return to power, ordered the Yuans to be slaughtered, regardless of age or gender, and had the bodies thrown into the Zhang River. In particular, a man named Yuan Huangtou flown off a tower strapped to a kite as part of an experiment of Emperor Wenxuan, the first known case of human flight. He survived but was starved to death in prison. Only several households who were particularly close to the Gaos were spared.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne.\" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei. The officials tried to mourn at his death, but no one was actually able to shed a tear other than Yang Yin. Not long after, Gao Yan killed Yang Yin and deposed Gao Yin, becoming emperor.\n\nPhysical appearance\n\nIn the Book of Northern Qi, author Li Baiyao notes that Gao Yang was a dark-skinned man with large and protruding jaws, and that his skin appeared to be abnormally rough.\n\nFamily\n\nConsorts and Issue:\n\n\u2022 Empress Zhaoxin, of the Li clan of Zhao (\u662d\u4fe1\u7687\u540e \u8d99\u90e1\u674e\u6c0f), personal name Zu'e (\u7956\u5a25)\n\n\u2022 Gao Yin, Prince Jinan Mindao (\u6fdf\u5357\u610d\u60bc\u738b \u9ad8\u6bb7; 545\u2013561), first son\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaode, Prince Taiyuan (\u592a\u539f\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u5fb7; 548\u2013562), second son\n\n\u2022 Princess Changle (\u9577\u6a02\u516c\u4e3b), personal name Baode (\u5bf6\u5fb7)\n\n\u2022 Married Wei Shibian (\u5c09\u4e16\u8faf)\n\n\u2022 Princess Yining (\u7fa9\u5be7\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Hul\u00fc Wudu (\u659b\u5f8b\u6b66\u90fd; d. 572), the first son of Hul\u00fc Guang\n\n\u2022 Furen, of the Yan clan (\u5f18\u5fb7\u592b\u4eba \u984f\u6c0f; 530\u2013576), personal name Yuguang (\u7389\u5149)\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaolian, Prince Longxi (\u96b4\u897f\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u5ec9; 553\u2013577), fifth son\n\n\u2022 Pin, of the Pei clan (\u5b2a \u88f4\u6c0f)\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaoren, Prince Xihe (\u897f\u6cb3\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u4ec1; d. 577), fourth son\n\n\u2022 Pin, of the Xue clan (\u5b2a \u859b\u6c0f; d. 555)\n\n\u2022 A daughter\n\n\u2022 Shifu, of the Feng clan (\u4e16\u5a66 \u99ae\u6c0f)\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaoyi, Prince Fanyang (\u8303\u967d\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u7fa9; d. 580), third son\n\n\u2022 Unknown\n\n\u2022 Princess Zhongshan (\u4e2d\u5c71\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Duan Baoding of Wuwei (\u6b66\u5a01 \u6bb5\u5bf6\u9f0e)\n\nAncestry"}, {"url": "https://www.nouahsark.com/en/infocenter/culture/history/monarchs/emperor_wenxuan_of_northern_qi.php", "page_content": "Emperor Wenxuan of (Northern) Qi ((\u5317)\u9f4a\u6587\u5ba3\u5e1d) (529\u2013559), personal name Gao Yang (\u9ad8\u6d0b), courtesy name Zijin (\u5b50\u9032), was the first emperor of the Chinese dynasty northern qi. He was the second son of eastern wei's paramount general Gao Huan, and the death of his brother and Gao Huan's designated successor Gao Cheng in 549 became the regent of eastern wei. In 550, he forced Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei to yield the throne to him, ending eastern wei and starting northern qi.\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for attentiveness to military matters, and the strength of the northern qi military was at its prime. He also tried to equalize the tax burden and reduce corruption by offering officials sufficient salary. He entrusted most governmental matters to the capable Yang Yin, and for a while, the government was effective, and the military was strong. However, Emperor Wenxuan eventually turned cruel, and his erratic behavior, fueled by alcoholism, plunged his administration into chaos.\n\n\n\nEarly life Gao Yang was born in 529, while his father Gao Huan was a Han chinese general under northern wei's paramount general Erzhu Rong. His mother Lou Zhaojun was Gao Huan's wife, on whose financial support Gao's early career had relied on. Lou Zhaojun was an ethnic Xianbei. He was their second son, after his older brother Gao Cheng. After Erzhu Rong's death in 530, Gao Huan overthrew Erzhu's family and became northern wei's paramount general, and after northern wei divided into eastern wei and western wei in 534 became the actual power controlling eastern wei. Gao Yang thus grew up in a household of power. In 535, he was created the Duke of Taiyuan.\n\nGao Yang was not well regarded as a child, as he was awkward in interpersonal skills and at times considered developmentally disabled, being unable to carry out many tasks common for children. However, it appeared that he was actually of fairly high capability in many areas, and once, when Gao Huan tried to test his children's intelligence by giving them tangled balls of yarn to untangle, Gao Yang took out his sword and sliced the ball open, stating that that was the only solution. As Gao Huan's sons grew older, on one occasion, Gao Huan wanted to test their military abilities by having his general Peng Le (\u5f6d\u6a02) launch a mock attack on them. All of Gao Huan's sons, including the older Gao Cheng, were fearful, but Gao Yang reacted calmly and actually captured Peng. As he grew, he continued to be awkward and appearing to be unintelligent, and Gao Cheng, in particular, often looked down on him.\n\nGao Huan died in 547, and thereafter, Gao Cheng, who had already controlled many aspects of eastern wei imperial government's operations, took over as regent. He moved to consolidate his power further, and when Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei tried to form a plot to kill him, he discovered the plot and put Emperor Xiaojing under effective house arrest. He then planned taking the throne himself, but at a meeting in 549 at the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan, Hebei ), with his officials Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212), and Yang Yin, to discuss the procedure for doing so, he was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac), who was angry at his wrongful treatment. At that time, Gao Yang happened to be in Yecheng, and he quickly gathered the guards and killed Lan and his co-conspirators. He chose not to announce Gao Cheng's death immediately, while moving to consolidate power.\n\n\n\nAs Eastern Wei regent Initially, Emperor Xiaojing, who had received rumors that Gao Cheng had died, thought he might have a chance to regain power. However, upon meeting Gao Yang, who made a display of force by having more than 200 guards accompany him, Emperor Xiaojing saw that Gao Yang could not be easily dealt with. Meanwhile, Gao Yang headed for the Gaos' stronghold of Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi ), and consolidated his military command there, quickly impressing the generals who had previously looked down on him with quick and careful decisions.\n\nIn fall and winter 549, with rival liang dynasty under internal turmoil after the rebellion of Hou Jing (a former eastern wei general who had defected to Liang in 547), Gao Yang sent Peng Le to attack the Liang border provinces, taking over the region between the Huai River and Yangtze River with ease.\n\nIn spring 550, Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing convey on him the greater title of Prince of Qi Commandery. Two months later, his title was made the even greater title of Prince of Qi.\n\nIn summer 550, under advice from the officials Gao Dezheng (\u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f), Xu Zhicai (\u5f90\u4e4b\u624d), and Song Jingye (\u5b8b\u666f\u696d), Gao Yang decided to take the throne, despite reservations from Gao Yang's mother Princess Dowager Lou. He therefore headed from Jinyang to Yecheng, but even as he was on the way and had reached the halfway city of Pingdu (\u5e73\u90fd, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi ), the officials largely pretended to ignore his overtures at taking the throne, so he returned to Jinyang. Soon thereafter, he had Emperor Xiaojing issue an edict conferring the nine bestowments on him, further displaying his posture of taking the throne. He then proceeded to Yecheng again, and Emperor Xiaojing yielded the throne to him, ending eastern wei and establishing northern qi, with Gao Yang as its Emperor Wenxuan. He created the former Emperor Xiaojing the Prince of Zhongshan. He posthumously honored Gao Huan and Gao Cheng as emperors, while honoring his mother as empress dowager.\n\n\n\nEarly reign Early in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for being attentive to important matters of state, particularly military matters. He revised eastern wei laws, and he selected elite soldiers from both Xianbei and Han ethnicities to form the border defense corps. To equalize the tax and labor burden, he divided the households under his rule into nine classes based on their wealth, requiring the wealthy to pay more taxes and the poor to contribute more labor. Continuing a trend set by both his father Gao Huan and his brother Gao Cheng, he divided his time between Yecheng and Jinyang, effectively making Jinyang a second capital.\n\nWhile Emperor Wenxuan was ethnically Han, like his father Gao Huan, he viewed himself as Xianbei rather than Han. Further, more than his father did, he looked down on Han traditions, not willing to follow them. Because of this, Gao Dezheng and another official, Gao Longzhi (\u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b), who wanted to ingratiate themselves with Emperor Wenxuan's cousin and powerful general Duan Shao (\u6bb5\u97f6), suggested he make Duan Shao's sister Lady Duan, a concubine of his, empress. Emperor Wenxuan did not follow their advice and, pursuant to expected norm, created his wife Princess Li Zu'e empress and created her son Gao Yin crown prince.\n\nIn response to the establishment of northern qi, Yuwen Tai, the paramount general of rival western wei, launched a major attack on northern qi. Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops to defend against Yuwen's attack. When Yuwen saw that Emperor Wenxuan's troops were well-organized, he sighed and stated, \"Gao Huan is not yet dead. \" He was unable to overcome Emperor Wenxuan's defense and so was forced to withdraw, and in fact lost some border commanderies to northern qi in the campaign.\n\nAround the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan wanted to put the former emperor, the Prince of Zhongshan, to death. He first invited his sister and the prince's wife, the Princess Taiyuan, to a feast. As soon as she left the prince's household, he sent assassins to force the prince to drink poison, and also killed his three sons. He buried the former emperor with imperial honors, but at a later point, for reasons unknown, he dug out the former emperor's casket and threw it into the Zhang River (\u6f33\u6c34, flowing near Yecheng).\n\nIn spring 552, Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops against the Kumo Xi tribe (in the upper Liao River drainage area) and achieved a great victory. Around the same time, he also sent generals to seize certain border cities with Liang, as Liang troops continued to battle Hou Jing, who declared himself the Emperor of Han in 551 but was subsequently defeated by Emperor Yuan of Liang in 552. The campaigns of seizing Liang cities continued even after Hou's defeat, although he did not at this point launch a single major attack on Liang. The campaigns appeared to end in winter 552, and Emperor Wenxuan in fact promised the Liang generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian, whom Emperor Yuan put in charge of the eastern half of Liang territory, to return the cities of Guangling (\u5ee3\u9675, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu ) and Liyang (\u6b77\u967d, in modern Chaohu, Anhui ).\n\nAlso in winter 552, Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops from Jinyang to Lishi (\u96e2\u77f3, in modern L\u00fcliang, Shanxi ), and he ordered the construction of a Great Wall from Huanglu Mountain (\u9ec3\u6ae8\u5dba, also in modern L\u00fcliang) to Sheping Fortress (\u793e\u5e73\u620d, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi ), apparently to defend against western wei and Tujue.\n\nIn winter 553, Khitan tribes were attacking northern qi's northern borders, and Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops to attack Khitan\u2014and on this campaign, he was described as personally exposing himself to the dangers and contributing much personally to defeating the Khitan.\n\nAlso in winter 553, Emperor Wenxuan, wanting to put northern qi-friendly emperor on the Liang throne, commissioned an army commanded by Guo yuanjian (\u90ed\u5143\u5efa) to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Tui (\u856d\u9000), who had surrendered to eastern wei in 548, back to Liang territory. However, northern qi forces were defeated by the Liang general Hou Tian (\u4faf\u7471), and Xiao Tui returned to Yecheng.\n\nAround the new year 554, the remnants of Rouran, which by that point was near its end, surrendered to northern qi to seek protection from Tujue attacks. Emperor Wenxuan personally attacked the Tujue, fighting its army off, and then created Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen as the new khan of Rouran, settling the Rouran people within northern qi territory, at Mayi (\u99ac\u9091, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi ).\n\nIn spring 554, Emperor Wenxuan, assisted by the senior general Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1) and his brother Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, launched a major attack on the Shanhu (\u5c71\u80e1) tribe (in modern L\u00fcliang). After victory, he ordered that all 11-year-old and older males of the Shanhu be slaughtered, and that the females and the young males be awarded as spoils of war to the soldiers. When one of his commanders died because that commander's lieutenant, Lu Huili (\u8def\u6689\u79ae), was unable to save him, Emperor Wenxuan ordered that Lu's internal organs be cut out of his body and that the soldiers consume them. Many traditional historians, including Li Yanshou (\u674e\u5ef6\u58fd), the author of the History of Northern Dynasties, and Sima Guang, the author of the Zizhi Tongjian, saw this battle as the turning point of Emperor Wenxuan's rule\u2014that thereafter, he began to act violently and capriciously. For example, in spring 554, when Rouran rebelled and he personally led troops to defeat Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen, he felt that warhorses offered by the general Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) the Prince of Anding were not of sufficient quality\u2014and he punished Heba by plucking out Heba's hair and demoting to commoner status, and further ordering Heba to serve as a worker in a coal processing facility. In another example, in fall 554, after he had put the official Yuan Xu (\u5143\u65ed), a former northern wei prince, to death, he remembered the snubs that Gao Longzhi, who was a friend of Yuan Xu's, had shown him before he became eastern wei's regent, and he had Gao Longzhi battered so severely that Gao Longzhi died several days later\u2014and at a later point, still angry at Gao Longzhi, arrested Gao Longzhi's 20 sons and, with 20 executioners lined up, had the sons beheaded simultaneously, and then threw their bodies and Gao Longzhi's body thrown into the Zhang River.\n\nStarting in 551, Emperor Wenxuan had ordered his official Wei Shou to compile a history of northern wei. Wei Shou completed the work in 554, but his work (Book of Wei) was criticized by many to be defamatory to ancestors of many political enemies (so much so that they referred to the work as Huishu (\u7a62\u66f8\u2014the Book of Filth)), and several officials filed reports condemning Wei Shou. Wei Shou submitted a petition to Emperor Wenxuan defending himself, and Emperor Wenxuan, in an act that he believed to be protecting the integrity of history, jailed the officials who condemned Wei Shou.\n\nIn late 554, western wei launched a major attack on Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei ), then the capital of Liang. Emperor Wenxuan commissioned an army commanded by Gao Huan's cousin Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3) the Prince of Qinghe to attack western wei's An Province (\u5b89\u5dde, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei ) to try to relieve pressure from Jiangling, but by the time that Gao Yue arrived, Jiangling had already fallen, and western wei captured and then executed Emperor Yuan.\n\n\n\nLate reign western wei declared Emperor Yuan's nephew Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang, but the declaration was not recognized by most Liang generals, and the chief of those generals, Wang Sengbian, welcomed Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an to the old Liang capital Jiankang, declaring him the Prince of Liang in spring 555 and preparing to make him emperor. Emperor Wenxuan had other ideas, however, and he created Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, whom eastern wei captured in 547 during Liang's attempt to aid Hou Jing's rebellion against eastern wei, emperor, commissioning his brother Gao Hu\u00e0n (\u9ad8\u6e19, note tone difference with his father) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Xiao Yuanming back to Liang territory. Emperor Wenxuan wrote letters to Wang recommending Xiao Yuanming as emperor, arguing that Xiao Fangzhi (who was 12 years old) was too young. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after Gao Huan won a few battles over Wang's generals, Wang decided to submit and, after northern qi escorting troops agreed to limit their presence to 1,000 men, and Xiao Yuanming agreed to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince, accepted Xiao Yuanming as emperor. To show his good faith, Wang sent his son Wang Xian (\u738b\u986f) and nephew Wang Shizhen (\u738b\u4e16\u73cd), as well as Wang Xian's mother Lady Liu, to Yecheng as hostages. Xiao Yuanming became Liang's emperor, and there was peace between northern qi and Liang, with Liang now a vassal.\n\nJust four months later, however, the situation changed. Wang Sengbian's lieutenant Chen Baxian, displeased over Xiao Yuanming's ascension (as he saw Xiao Yuanming's claim as being too attenuated), make a surprise attack on Jiankang from his headquarters of Jingkou (\u4eac\u53e3, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu ), killing Wang Sengbian and forcing Xiao Yuanming to yield the throne to Xiao Fangzhi (who took the throne as Emperor Jing). Initially, Chen claimed that Liang would still agree to be a vassal, and Emperor Wenxuan sent the official Sima Gong (\u53f8\u99ac\u606d) to swear an oath with Liang officials. However, with several generals loyal to Wang Sengbian rising against Chen following Wang's death, Emperor Wenxuan's mind changed, particularly after two, Xu Sihui (\u5f90\u55e3\u5fbd) and Ren Yue (\u4efb\u7d04) submitted to him, making a surprise attack on the near-Jiankang fortress Shitou and capturing it. Emperor Wenxuan sent the general Xiao Gui (\u856d\u8ecc) to reinforce Xu and Ren. Chen defeated northern qi troops and Xu and Ren, however, and Xiao Gui's assistant Liu Damo (\u67f3\u9054\u6469), sieged by Chen in Shitou, sought peace. Chen agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (\u9673\u66c7\u6717), Emperor Jing's nephew Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (\u738b\u73c9), the son of the key official Wang Chong (\u738b\u6c96), to serve as hostages to northern qi, allowing Liu to withdraw. (Upon Liu's return to northern qi, however, Emperor Wenxuan had him executed. )\n\nDuring the campaign against Liang, Emperor Wenxuan made another display of his increasing instability, as he, jealous over the fact that his concubine Consort Xue had previously had a sexual relationship with Gao Yue, ordered Gao Yue to commit suicide. Thereafter, he beheaded Consort Xue and hid her head in his sleeves. At a banquet later that day, he tossed her head onto a platter and cut her body into pieces, beginning to play with her leg, surprising all of the banquet attendants. At the end of the banquet, he packed her body parts and began crying, following the cart carrying her body on foot.\n\nIn fall 555, Emperor Wenxuan became convinced that Buddhism and Taoism should be but one religion, and that one of them should be merged into the other. He had the leading Buddhist and Taoist monks debate before him, and he declared the Buddhists the victors, ordering Taoism merged into Buddhism and Taoist monks to become Buddhist monks. Some Taoist monks initially rejected this edict, but after he executed four monks, the others submitted, and Taoism became banned within northern qi.\n\nIn spring 556, border battles between northern qi and Liang resumed, and northern qi prepared another campaign against Liang. In summer 556, northern qi forces were again south of the Yangtze, operating in Jiankang's vicinity, but they were stalemated against Liang troops, eventually defeated by Chen and his generals after they ran out of food. A number of northern wei generals were captured and executed by Liang, and in response, Emperor Wenxuan put Chen Tanlang to death.\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's erratic behavior became even greater in scope, fueled by his alcoholism. As described by Sima Guang in his Zizhi Tongjian: . . . [Emperor Wenxuan] drank heavily and lived immorality, carrying out cruel and barbarous act at his on whim. Sometimes he sang and danced day and night. Sometimes he spread his hair and wore barbarian clothing with colorful sashes. Sometimes he bared his body and put on makeup. Sometimes he rode donkeys, cows, camels, or elephants without using saddles. Sometimes he ordered Cui Jishu or Liu Taozhi (\u5289\u6843\u679d) to carry him and a large drum to allow him to beat the drums. He was accustomed to making surprise charges into the nobles' and imperial officials' private residences. He often crossed streets, sometimes sitting in the streets and sometimes even sleeping on them. Sometimes when it is warm, he would be naked to bask in the sun, but even in the coldest winter, he would strip naked as well and run around. His attendants could not stand his behavior, but he himself did not care. . . . Once, he asked a woman on the street, \"How is the Son of Heaven like?\" The woman responded, \"He is so crazy that he really cannot be considered a Son of Heaven. \" He beheaded her.\n\nOnce, when he was drunk and acting irrationally, Empress Dowager Lou rebuked him, and he threatened to marry her to an old barbarian. When she became angry, he became fearful, and he wanted to induce her to smile again, so he crawled on the ground under her seat, but in doing so, he flipped the seat over, and she was injured. After he sobered up, he realized how he had been injured, and he set a large fire, intending to jump in to die, causing her to have to grab him to save him. He thereafter pledged not to drink any more, but was only able to do so for 10 days before he began drinking again. He also once shot an arrow at Empress Li's mother Lady Cui and whipped her. Further, it was described that most women of the imperial Gao clan were forced to have sexual relations with him at one point or another. When Gao Huan's concubine Erzhu Ying'e, the Princess Dowager of Pengcheng, refused, he killed her with his own hands. Emperor Wenxuan also became homicidal when he drank, and he always wanted to kill people when he was drunk. Yang Yin, who was prime minister at this point, therefore set up a group of condemned prisoners to be available to the palace guards\u2014if Emperor Wenxuan wanted to kill someone, a condemned prisoner would be brought out for him to kill, and if a prisoner was able to survive for three months without being killed, he would be set free.\n\nHowever, even in his erratic behavior, Emperor Wenxuan was still attentive to many important matters, and because of his harshness, his officials did not dare to be corrupt. Further, Yang was a capable prime minister, and Emperor Wenxuan gave him full authorization to carry out laws properly. Therefore, it was said at the time that while the emperor was violent and insane, the government was nevertheless efficient.\n\nIn winter 557, believing prophecies that Gao Hu\u00e0n would be emperor, he ordered Gao Hu\u00e0n arrested. Gao Hu\u00e0n tried to resist, but was nevertheless captured and delivered to Yecheng. When another brother, Gao Jun (\u9ad8\u6d5a) the prince of Yong'an, sent petitions urging him to change his behavior, he had Gao Jun arrested as well, and the two princes were imprisoned in a dungeon.\n\nAlso in winter 557, Chen Baxian had Liang's Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing chen dynasty, and subsequently had Emperor Jing killed in 558. The general Wang Lin, then in control of modern Hunan and eastern Hubei , refused to submit to Chen and sought to continue Liang's lineage. He therefore requested northern qi to return Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia to be emperor. In spring 558, northern qi troops escorted Xiao Zhuang to Wang's territory, and Wang declared Xiao Zhuang emperor, as a northern qi vassal, with his capital at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan, Hubei ).\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's military campaigns and other wasteful behavior had caused the imperial treasury to be drained. He had also become unhappy with his son Gao Yin, believing that Gao Yin was too Han-like in behavior, and he considered deposing Gao Yin. Once, he ordered Gao Yin to personally execute a prisoner, but Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and Emperor Wenxuan battered him with a whip handle, causing Gao Yin to thereafter have a panic disorder and at times unable to speak. When Emperor Wenxuan became drunk, he would often state that he might eventually pass the throne to his brother Gao Yan, and he stopped stating as such only after urging by Yang and Wei Shou, who believed that his words were causing an unstabling effect in causing a doubt as to who would succeed him.\n\nAround the new year 559, Emperor Wenxuan visited the imprisoned Gao Jun and Gao Hu\u00e0n. He initially took pity on them and considered releasing them, but, at the urging of another brother, Gao Dan the Prince of Changguang, did not do so, and further started to pierce them with spears. He also ordered that torches be thrown at them, burning them to death. He rewarded the princes' wives to the soldiers who delivered the death blows.\n\nIn summer 559, Emperor Wenxuan, suspecting that the members of the northern wei imperial Yuan clan would eventually try to return to power, ordered the Yuans to be slaughtered, regardless of age or gender, and had the bodies thrown into the Zhang River. Only several households who were particularly close to the Gaos were spared.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne. \" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei. The officials tried to mourn at his death, but no one was actually able to shed a tear other than Yang Yin.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.chinahighlights.com/travelguide/china-history/the-southern-northern-dynasties.htm", "page_content": "The Longmen Grottoes. The Longmen Grottoes.\n\nPreceded by the Eastern Jin Dynasty (317-420) and followed by the Sui Dynasty (58-618), the Southern and Northern Dynasties lasted from 420 to 589, which was a time of turmoil and war, but it was also a time of prosperity for art, culture, religion and technology in the history of China.\n\nThe Southern Dynasties (420-589) refer to the Liu Song Dynasty (420-479), the Southern Qi Dynasty (479-502), the Liang Dynasty (502-557) and the Chen Dynasty (557-589); the Northern Dynasties (386-581) include the North Wei (386-557), the East Wei (534-550), the West Wei (535-556), the North Qi (550-577) and the North Zhou (557-581) dynasties.\n\nAlthough there were unceasing social disorders, frequent changes of dynasties and unexpected natural disasters, the Southern Dynasties (420-589) and the Northern Dynasties (386-581) remained in stalemate for over 100 years, and the historians called this period the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420-589).\n\nThe Southern Dynasties (420-589)\n\nChina was divided into South China and North China in 304, which confronted each other. Four dynasties stepped onto the historical stage successively in North China \u2014 the Liu Song Dynasty (420-479), the Southern Qi Dynasty (479-502), the Liang Dynasty (502-557) and the Chen Dynasty (557-589) \u2014 which were known as the Southern Dynasties (420-589) in Chinese history.\n\nAll of the four dynasties had their capitals in Jiangkang (presently Nanjing of Jiangsu Province), except that Emperor Yuan of the Liang Dynasty (502-557) had his capital at Jiangliang (presently Jiangling of Hubei Province) for three years.\n\nThe Southern Dynasties (420-589) was a changing period for the nobilities from prosperity to decline. Though the nobilities still enjoyed a very high social status in the Southern Dynasties (420-589), they couldn't completely control the political situation owing to the increasingly strengthened imperial power.\n\nWith the areas to the south of the Yangtze River becoming further developed, more and more Han people from the lower class stepped into the bureaucratic ranks and received the pleasure of the emperors during the Southern Dynasties (420-589).\n\nLiu Song\n\nAs the longest dynasty among the Southern Dynasties (420-589), the Liu Song Dynasty (420-479) was founded by Liu Yu, a general of the Northern Garrison Army of the Eastern Jin Dynasty (317-420), who came into power through suppressing Huan Xuan's rebellion in 404. He didn't even hesitate to lead two northern expeditions against North China just to gain prestige, during which he seized the territories of Henan, Shandong and Guanzhong (the lower valley of the Wei River).\n\nBy killing Emperor An (Sima Dezong) and deposing Emperor Gong (Sima Dewen) of the Eastern Jin Dynasty (317-420), Liu Yu crowned himself Emperor Wu of the Liu Song Dynasty (420-479) on July 10th of 420, thus ending the Eastern Jin Dynasty (317-420) and establishing the Southern Dynasties (420-589). Tuoba Gui of the North Wei Dynasty (386-557) unified North China in 440, since the confrontation between North China and South China had begun.\n\nEmperor Wu was very frugal after ascending the throne, but he was not interested in royal education and trusted unworthy men, leading to a great disaster in his court. After realizing the imperial power was threatened by the nobilities, Emperor Wu started to promote humble clan landlords to higher official positions and gave military power to his kinsmen. Owing to his kinsmen often plotting to overthrow him, Emperor Wu was so terrified that he frequently had them killed.\n\nEmperor Wu abdicated the throne in favor of his son, Liu Song (later Emperor Shao), who was deposed and later killed by his men, Xu Xianzhi and Fu Liang, owing to his immoral behavior. The courtiers set up Liu Yilong (another son of Emperor Wu) as Emperor Wen of the Liu Song Dynasty (420-479).\n\nEmperor Wen later had Xu Xianzhi and Fu Liang killed with the help of General Tan Daoji (a general of the Northern Garrison Army), and during his reign the political situation was rather stable owing to his cleansing of political corruption and advocating frugality; this period was known as the Yuanjia Administration in the history of China.\n\nEmperor Wen had launched several northern expeditions against the North Wei Dynasty (386-557) since 430, ending up with failure each time owing to insufficient preparations and inadequate commands, which had greatly weakened his kingdom. On the contrary, the North Wei Dynasty (386-557) crusaded against the Liu Song Dynasty (420-479) and conquered the Yangtze River area in 445, following which the Liu Song Dynasty (420-479) remained in a weakened state.\n\nEmperor Wen was murdered by the crown prince, Liu Shao, in 453. The third son of Emperor Wen, Liu Jun, killed Liu Shao, crowning himself as Emperor Xiaowu of the Liu Song Dynasty (420-479), but he was very licentious and cruel and even raped his own niece, leading to his kinsmen's rebellion, and he slaughtered them all in Guangling (presently Yangzhou of Jiangsu Province).\n\nAfter the death of Emperor Xiaowu, Liu Ziye (later Emperor Qianfei of the Liu Song Dynasty) ascended the throne, ordering his own kinsmen to be killed which eventually resulted in his assassination by Liu Yu. After usurping the throne, Liu Yu crowned himself as Emperor Ming of the Liu Song Dynasty (420-479) and killed all the descendants of Emperor Xiaowu.\n\nAs the son of Emperor Ming, Liu Yu (later Emperor Houfei of the Liu Song Dynasty) ascended the throne and the military power fell into the hands of Xiao Daocheng. By deposing Emperor Houfei and setting up Liu Huai (the third son of Emperor Ming) as a puppet emperor, Xiao Daocheng arrogated all powers to himself.\n\nAfter crushing his political opponents, Yuan Can and Shen Youzhi, Xiao Daocheng deposed Liu Huai and crowned himself Emperor Gao of the Southern Qi Dynasty (479-502), symbolizing the demise of the Liu Song Dynasty (420-479).\n\nSouthern Qi\n\nThe Southern Qi Dynasty (479-502) was established by Xiao Daocheng (later Emperor Gao) in 479, who was from the Xiao family of Lanling (presently Cangshan County, Shandong), and he was disdained by the nobilities owing to his previously lower social standing.\n\nLike the founding father of the Liu Song Dynasty (420-479), Emperor Gao remained very frugal during his reign. He died after ruling for four years and was succeeded by his eldest son, Xiao Ze (later Emperor Wu of the Southern Qi Dynasty). Xiao Ze made a peace treaty with the North Wei Dynasty (386-557) and maintained security in his territory, and this peaceful period was known as the Yongming Administration in the history of China.\n\nEmperor Wu was succeeded by his grandson, Xiao Zhaoye, who was assisted by Xiao Luan in conducting state affairs. Xiao Luan usurped the throne by killing Xiao Zhaoye and Xiao Zhaowen (brother of Xiao Zhaoye), crowning himself Emperor Ming of the Southern Qi Dynasty (479-502), who also used government secretaries to monitor his kinsmen and had all the descendants of Emperors Gao and Wu killed.\n\nXiao Baojuan became emperor after the death of Emperor Ming, and he was so cruel and tyrannical that he even had his assisting ministers killed, sparking rebellions across his kingdom. Just as the saying goes, \"when all birds are shot, the bow will be set aside; when all hares are killed, the hounds will be stewed and eaten\u201d, Xiao Baojuan killed his meritorious general, Xiao Yi, after putting down a rebellion. Xiao Yan, brother of Xiao Yi, rose in revolt against Xiao Baojuan to avenge his brother in 501.\n\nAfter Xiao Yan's conquering of Jiankang (presently Nanjing of Jiangsu Province), Xiao Baojuan was murdered by his general, Wang Zhenguo. Xiao Yan usurped the throne and crowned himself as Emperor Wu of the Liang Dynasty (502-557) in 502, thus ending the Southern Qi Dynasty (479-502).\n\nLiang Dynasty\n\nThe Liang Dynasty (502-557) was established by Xiao Yan (Emperor Wu) in 502, and he was economical, diligent in government affairs and cared for the common people, which enabled his military strength to surpass that of the North Wei Dynasty (386-557) during his reign. Unlike the emperors of the Southern Qi Dynasty (479-502), Emperor Wu of the Liang Dynasty (502-557) was very lenient to his kinsmen.\n\nAs a very learned emperor, Emperor Wu advocated cultural exchanges among scholars, who greatly promoted the cultural prosperity of the Liang Dynasty (502-557), but he lent a willing ear to flattery and praise from treacherous court officials during his later years. He even tried to become a monk in Tongtai Temple three times owing to his obsession with Buddhism, but he was persuaded to return to his kingdom each time by abbots, and he donated a large sum of money to the temple.\n\nDuring Emperor Wu's reign, nearly half of the population became monks in respect of the fact that the Buddhists and Taoists were exempt from taxes according to laws, which caused great damage to the Liang Dynasty (502-557).\n\nThe Liang Dynasty (502-557) was at war with the North Wei Dynasty (386-557) near the southern part of Huai River and won it in 503, and the former also defeated the latter in the battle of Shouyang in 516. Emperor Wu was willing to accept the surrendered generals from the North Wei Dynasty (386-557) in order to reap where he had not sowed.\n\nAs the North Wei Dynasty (386-557) was rent into the West Wei Dynasty (535-556) and the East Wei Dynasty (534-550), Emperor Wu gave shelter to Hou Jing (the rebellious East Wei general) and sent him to crusade against the East Wei Dynasty (534-550).\n\nAfter the Liang army led by Hou Jing was defeated, Emperor Wu was to sacrifice Hou Jing as a peace offering. Hearing the news, Hou Jing rose in revolt against Emperor Wu and conquered Jiankang (presently Nanjing), and Emperor Wu fled to Taicheng.\n\nHou Jing ordered the slaughter of the nobilities after capturing Jiankang, dealing a crushing blow to the Liang Dynasty (502-557), and it turned out that Emperor Wu was starved to death. Hou Jing made Xiao Gang (the eldest son of Emperor Wu) a puppet emperor and took his place later, and he even established the Han State. Later, Chen Baxian, the governor of Guangzhou, collaborated with Wang Sengbian, a general under the command of Xiao Yi (governor of Jiangling), to crusade against Hou Jing and had him killed.\n\nXiao Yi succeeded to the throne and crowned himself Emperor Yuan of the Liang Dynasty (502-557). Xiao Cha guided the East Wei army to attack Jiangling and killed Emperor Yuan the following year, and he was made a puppet emperor of the West Liang Dynasty (502-557).\n\nAfter Emperor Yuan was killed, Chen Baxian and Wang Sengbian set up Xiao Fangzhi (son of Emperor Yuan) as Emperor Jing. The Liang army retreated in defeat again and again during the wars with the North Qi Dynasty (550-577), and Wang Sengbian was forced to depose Emperor Jing and to set up Xiao Yuanming (backed up by the North Qi Dynasty) as emperor, under great pressure from the North Qi Dynasty (550-577).\n\nOut of great dissatisfaction with Wang Sengbian's decision, Chen Baxian led his army to attack Wang Sengbian and had him killed, and he deposed Xiao Yuanming and re-established Xiao Fangzhi as Emperor Jing. Chen Baxian usurped the throne and established the Chen Dynasty (557-589) in 557, claiming the title of Emperor Wu of the Chen Dynasty (557-589), thus ending the Liang Dynasty (502-557).\n\nChen Dynasty\n\nThe Chen Dynasty (557-589) was established by Chen Baxian in 557, who was from Wu (presently Shanghai). Owing to the Wu and Qiao clans being greatly weakened during the Hou Jing Rebellion, a number of independent regimes emerged in South China after the wars. Chen Baxian (Emperor Wu of the Cheng Dynasty) adopted a pacifying policy to these regimes due to his limited military power.\n\nChen Qian, the nephew of Emperor Wu, succeeded to the throne and became Emperor Wen after the death of Emperor Wu. As the Liang Dynasty (502-557) fell, Wang Lin established a kingdom in Lianghu (presently Hubei and Hunan Provinces) and, allied with the North Qi Dynasty (550-577) and the North Zhou Dynasty (557-581) to attack Jiankang, ended up with being defeated by the Chen army. Emperor Wen made every effort to make his kingdom prosperous during his reign, greatly improving the economic situation in South China.\n\nAfter Emperor Wen died, the crown prince Chen Bozong (later Emperor Fei) ascended to the throne, and he was deposed by his own uncle, Chen Wangxu, who claimed himself Emperor Xu of the Chen Dynasty (557-589). The North Wei Dynasty (386-557) intended to invade the North Qi Dynasty (550-577) and invited the Chen Dynasty (557-589) to assist with the attack. Emperor Xuan accepted the offer and sent General Wu Mingche to assist the cause in 573, recovering the lost territory in the southern area of the Huai River two years later.\n\nAfter the fall of the North Qi Dynasty (550-577), the North Wei Dynasty (386-557) crusaded against the Chen Dynasty and defeated it in 577, leaving it in a precarious situation. All of a sudden, Emperor Wu of the North Zhou Dynasty (557-581) died, which stopped the southern advance of the North Zhou Dynasty's (557-581) army. The death of Emperor Wu also resulted in internal strife, and Yang Jian took the opportunity and seized the throne, establishing the Sui Dynasty.\n\nAfter the death of Emperor Xuan, Chen Baoshu ascended the throne as Emperor Houzhu of the Chen Dynasty (557-589), who was very licentious and wasteful during his reign, leading to chaos and corruption in his kingdom. The Sui troops burned the farmlands of the Chen Dynasty (557-589) during the harvest time, which greatly weakened the strength of the Chen Dynasty (557-589).\n\nEmperor Wen of the Sui Dynasty (581-618) sent his son, Yang Guang (later Emperor Yang), to launch a war against the Chen Dynasty (557-589) in 588. Chen Shubao continued to live a licentious life with his concubines owing to relying on the natural barrier of the Yangtze River, and the Sui army seized Jiankang and captured Chen Shubao, leading to the fall of the Chen Dynasty (557-589).\n\nThe Northern Dynasties (386-581)\n\nConfronting the Southern Dynasties (420-589) in the history of China, the Northern Dynasties (386-581) lasted for 150 years (from 439 to 589), and consisted of the North Wei (386-557), the East Wei (534-550), the West Wei (535-556), the North Qi (550-577) and the North Zhou (557-581) dynasties.\n\nAll the Northern Dynasties (386-581) were established by the Xianbei people except for the North Qi Dynasty (this was established by the Sinicized barbarians).\n\nNorth Wei\n\nThe Longmen Grottoes were started to buit. The Longmen Grottoes were started to buit.\n\nWith the state of Dai as its predecessor during the Sixteen Kingdom Period, the North Wei Dynasty (386-557) was established by Tuoba Gui in 386, who became Emperor Daowu later. Emperor Daowu was very cruel and was murdered by his own son, Tuoba Shao.\n\nTuoba Si (Tuoba Gui's eldest son) ascended the throne as Emperor Mingyuan of the North Wei Dynasty (386-557) in 387. He conquered Henan of the Liu Song Dynasty (420-479) and died soon afterwards, and he was succeeded by his son, Tuoba Tao (later Emperor Taiwu).\n\nTuoba Tao made every effort to improve his kingdom, greatly increasing the strength of the North Wei Dynasty (386-557). He ordered attacks on the Liu Song Dynasty repeatedly and also launched a series of wars against the North Liang Dynasty (401-439), Rouran and Shanshan (a state in the West Region), and he even proscribed Buddhism after suppressing the Gai Wu (Buddhist follower) Rebellion. He carried out cruel punishments in his later life, leading to his assassination by the eunuch, Zong Ai, in 452.\n\nAfter Emperor Taiwu's death, the Empress Dou held court from behind a screen, and she set up Tuoba Yuanhong as Emperor Xiaowen of the North Wei Dynasty (386-557). Greatly influenced by his mother (Empress Dou, a Han woman), the Emperor Xiaowen thought that the Xianbei people should be Sinicized owing to the advanced Han civilization. He moved the capital from Pingcheng to Luoyang to learn the Han culture, and even ordered Xianbei nobles to move into Luoyang, leaving some (who didn't want to move) in Pingcheng.\n\nEmperor Xiaowen carried out a series of social reforms aimed at enabling the Xiaobei nobles to conform to the Han cultural standards, including adopting the Han bureaucratic establishments, banning Xianbei costumes and advocating donning the Han costume at court, learning the Han language, encouraging the inter-marriage between Xianbei people and the Han people, and adopting a one-character Chinese surname among the Xianbei people, which greatly improved national reunification in his kingdom.\n\nAfter the Sinicization movement, the economic and military strength was greatly improved in the North Wei Dynasty (386-557). Emperor Xiaowen also launched a series of wars against the Southern Qi Dynasty (479-502), but ended up with failure each time. The nobles who didn't want to move into Luoyang gradually lost favor in the sight of Emperor Xiaowen, resulting in a split in the North Wei Dynasty (386-557).\n\nTuoba Yuanxiu succeeded to the throne as Emperor Xiaowu of the North Wei Dynasty in 532, and the North Wei Dynasty was split into the East Wei (534-550) and the West Wei (535-556) dynasties in 534 owing to internal strife among nobles.\n\nConfrontation between the East Wei and the West Wei\n\nThe East Wei Dynasty (534-550) was established by Tuoba Shanjian (later Emperor Xiaojing) in 534 with Yecheng (presently Anyang of Henan and Linzhang Counties of Hebei Province) as the capital, and the East Wei Dynasty (534-550) was set up by Tuoba Baoju (later Emperor Wen) in 535 with Chang'an (presently Xi'an of Shaanxi Province) as the capital. As a matter of fact, the power of the East Wei (534-550) and the West Wei (535-556) dynasties were wielded by Gao Huan and Yu Wentai respectively, and a series of wars resulted in a stalemate between the two states.\n\nThe East Wei Dynasty (534-550) was dominated by the Sinicized Xianbei people, who highly relied on Xianbei nobility politically. Gao Huan advocated the personnel policy of \"only using the talented\", so many famous court officials became his friends. Gao Huan ordered General Dou Tai to crusade against the West Wei Dynasty (535-556) in 536, but ended up with being defeated by the East Wei Dynasty's (534-550) troops, and Dou Tai killed himself out of shame.\n\nAs the West Wei Dynasty (535-556) was visited by a great drought in 538, Gao Han seized the chance to attack the West Wei Dynasty (535-556), and ended up with failure in the battle of Shayuan. He led 100,000 troops to attack the West Wei Dynasty (535-556) in 546, but he lost the war for the third time, leaving over 70,000 soldiers dead and wounded.\n\nGao Huan was consumed with great grief in 548, and his son, Gao Cheng, inherited his title. Gao Cheng was assassinated soon afterwards; his brother, Gao Yang, inherited his title and killed Emperor Xiaojing and the royal members in 550. Gao Yang established the North Qi Dynasty (550-577) in 550, claiming himself to be Emperor Wenxuan of the North Qi Dynasty.\n\nUnder the assistance of eight generals (Yu Wentai, Yuan Xin, Li Hu, Li Bi, Zhao Gui, Yu Jin, Du Guxin and Houmo Chenchong), the West Wei Dynasty (535-556) effectively resisted a series of attacks from the East Wei Dynasty (534-550). At that time, the economy and culture of the West Wei Dynasty (535-556) was not as prosperous as that of the East Wei Dynasty (534-550), and Yu Wentai ordered Su Chuo to make reforms in order to strengthen the nation.\n\nThe reforms, such as setting up the Fubing System (a local militia system existing in China between 6th century and 8th century) and advocating militarism, greatly enhanced the military strength of the West Wei Dynasty (535-556), which also had a great influence on the political and military systems of the Sui (581-618) and the Tang dynasties (618-907).\n\nDuring the Hou Jing Rebellion, Yu Wentai seized the opportunity to attack the Liang Dynasty (502-557) and captured Shu (presently Sichuan Province) and Jiangling (presently Jiangling of Hubei Province). After the death of Yu Wentai, Yu Wenhu (Yu Wentai's nephew) arrogated all powers of the West Wei Dynasty (535-556) to himself in 556, and deposed Emperor Gong and set up Yu Wenjue (son of Yu Wentai) as Emperor Xiaomin of the North Zhou Dynasty (557-581) in 558, symbolizing the demise of the West Wei Dynasty (535-556).\n\nConfrontation between the North Qi and the North Zhou (557-581)\n\nAs the successor of the East Wei Dynasty (534-550), the North Qi Dynasty (550-577) was established by Gao Yang (Emperor Wenxuan) in 550. Emperor Wenxuan defeated the Kumoxi people, the Qidan people, the Rouran people and the Shanhu people (a branch of the Huns) one after another; he even conquered the territorial area to the south of the Hurai River, and great progress was made in agriculture, salt and iron trade, and porcelain trade during his early reign.\n\nEmperor Wenxuan became licentious and cruel during his late reign, even ordering the slaughter of the Han nobilities in favor of the Xianbei nobilities, and the common people rebelled against him owing to his oppression, greatly reducing the strength of the North Qi Dynasty (550-577). Gao Yin ascended the throne as Emperor Fei of the North Qi Dynasty (550-577) after the death of Emperor Wenxuan, and he was assisted by his uncle, Gao Yan.\n\nGao Yan soon usurped the throne and became Emperor Xiaozhao of the North Qi Dynasty (550-577), during whose reign the national strength was restored gradually, and he died during the 2nd year of his reign and was succeeded by his brother, Gao Zhan (later Emperor Wucheng).\n\nEmperor Wucheng was very unprincipled and licentious; he died of excessive indulgence in sex and he was soon succeeded by his son, Gao Wei. As the old saying goes, \"like father, like son\u201d. Gao Wei was also unprincipled and licentious; he even had General Hulu Guang killed out of jealousy, resulting in great chaos in his kingdom, and the North Qi Dynasty (550-577) was conquered by the North Zhou Dynasty (557-581) in 577.\n\nAs the successor of the West Wei Dynasty (535-556), the North Zhou Dynasty (557-581) was established by Yu Wenjue (Emperor Xiaomin) in 550, but the political power was wielded by his cousin, Yu Wenhu. Emperor Xiaomin intended to ally with Zhao Gui and Gu Duji to kill Yu Wenhu, but their scheme was soon discovered.\n\nYu Wenhu had Emperor Xiaomin deposed and had Zhao Gui and Gu Duji beheaded after a fierce battle, and he set up Yu Wenyu as Emperor Ming of the North Zhou Dynasty (557-581) and poisoned him in 560. Later, Yu Wenhu set up Yu Wenyong as Emperor Wu of the North Zhou Dynasty (557-581). By adopting a stratagem of concealing his true intentions, Emperor Wu successfully had Yu Wenhu killed after being used as a puppet for 12 years, and he came into real power of the North Zhou Dynasty (557-581).\n\nEmperor Wu had great talent and bold vision, carrying out a series of reforms during his reign, which greatly reinforced the strength of the North Zhou Dynasty (557-581). Emperor Wu even conquered the North Qi Dynasty (550-577) in 577, and he was succeeded by his eldest son, Yu Wenyun (later Emperor Xuan of the North Zhou Dynasty), in 578. Emperor Xuan was very tyrannical and licentious, and even killed Yu Wenxuan (an official with meritorious records) and took away his wife. Emperor Xuan was succeeded by his son, Yu Wenchan (later Emperor Jing of the North Zhou Dynasty (557-581). Emperor Jing was deposed by Yang Jian in 581, thus ending the North Zhou Dynasty (557-581).\n\nReligion\n\nYungang Grottoes Yungang Grottoes\n\nA number of outstanding Taoist reformers emerged during the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420-589), represented by Kou Qianzhi, Lu Jingxiu and Tao Hongjing, under whose efforts Taoism took a new look.\n\nKou Qianzhi made the highest achievement among the three reformers, and he simplified some Taoist fast rites and recruited royal members and nobilities to take part in Taoism, which greatly alleviated class contradictions in the society and had landmark significance in the development of Taoism.\n\nBuddhism was very popular in the North Wei Dynasty (386-557) during the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420-589), which greatly boosted the development of Buddhist statues, murals and grottoes, highlighted by the Thousand Buddha Caves (in Dunhuang of Gansu Province), the Yungang Grottoes (in Datong of Shanxi Province), the Maijishan Grottoes (in Tianshui of Gansu Province) and the Longmen Grottoes (in Luoyang of Henan Province).\n\nArt\n\nGreat progress was made in art during the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420-589), which was represented by paintings in the Southern Dynasties (420-589) and stone carvings in the Northern Dynasties (386-581).\n\nThe theory of painting was established in the Southern Dynasties (420-589). Xie He proposed six methods to appreciating paintings in his works, Hua Pin, of which the rhythmic vitality was considered the highest standard of painting appreciation.\n\nThe stone carvings of the Northern Dynasties (386-581) were represented by grottoes, painted sculptures and mausoleum sculptures. The Yungang Grottoes feature Buddhist statues with calm and solemn looks, the painted sculptures of the Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang are characterized by significant smiles, and the clay sculptures of Yongning Temple (in Luoyang of Henan Province) feature vividness and delicateness.\n\nThe imperial mausoleums of the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420-589) were decorated with stone pillars, steles and stone beasts, which created a solemn atmosphere on the whole, highlighted by the mausoleums of Emperor Wu and Emperor Jing of the Southern Qi Dynasty (479-502)."}, {"url": "http://www.china.org.cn/top10/2011-09/02/content_23343011.htm", "page_content": "Adjust font size:\n\nIn ancient China, the emperor, believed to be the son of heaven, enjoyed the supreme power to rule the whole nation. How they performed decided the fate of the nation and people.\n\nOver five thousand years of history, China has witnessed 67 dynasties with 446 emperors. Of them, some were remembered by their people as great and brilliant leaders, some ordinary and just so-so, while a few too many so notorious, leaving their mark in history for being so incapable, fatuous, self-indulgent and dreadful.\n\nHere, China.org.cn presents the top ten most fatuous and insane emperors in ancient China.\n\nGao Yang \u5317\u9f50\u6587\u5ba3\u5e1d\u9ad8\u6d0b\n\nGao Yang (529-559), Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi, was the first emperor of Northern Qi during the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420-589). In his early years as emperor, he was loved for taking effective measures to enhance the military and political strengths and improve people's lives by reducing their tax burden. Due to his great efforts, Northern Qi became a strong power in a very short period of time. However, several years late, Gao became self-contended and arrogant, indulging his depraved desires for wine and women. Alcoholism not only dragged his state into chaos, but led to his death in 559.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mad emperor had an illicit relationship with Consort Xue's sister, but beheaded her after getting drunk one night. The next day, he took her head and brandished it at a feast, making all officials horrified. His Prime Minister Yan Yin even prepared a group of prisoners, so that Gao could kill someone conveniently as he desired after drinking.\n\nIt's more shocking that many of the women in the imperial Gao clan were ordered to have sex with Gao and his attendants in the palace, where he even killed a concubine mother who refused his request. When drunk, he couldn't even recognize Empress Dowager Lou. One day, as he was scolded by Lou for drinking again, he threatened to marry her to a barbarian.\n\nFollow China.org.cn on Twitter and Facebook to join the conversation.\n\nChinaNews App Download"}, {"url": "https://listverse.com/2017/01/12/10-crazy-stories-about-the-rulers-of-ancient-china/", "page_content": "Mark Oliver is a regular contributor to Listverse.

He sent a man into Houfei\u2019s room while he was sleeping to cut off his head. Xiao then took over the empire himself.\n\nHoufei was captivated by the round bulge of Xiao\u2019s massive belly, and he had a stroke of inspiration. He pinned a target to the general\u2019s gut and used it as target practice . He would have used real arrows, but his attendant managed to convince him to use blunted ones. If he kept his general alive, his attendant told him, he could shoot arrows at his belly every day.\n\nEmperor Houfei was nine years old when he ascended to the throne. Nine, as the Chinese learned, is a bit too young to be given absolute power over an empire\u2014and Emperor Houfei went mad with power in the way only a child could.

When he was 60 years old, Xuanzong made his own son divorce his wife so that he could make his daughter-in-law one of his concubines.\n\nXuanzong, however, stubbornly refused to die. His reign went on for 44 years, and his harem just kept getting bigger. By the end, he had over 40,000 women . Xuanzong almost certainly didn\u2019t have time to meet them all, so instead, they just sat around learning poetry, mathematics, and the classics and taking care of mulberry trees.\n\nTraditionally, in Xuanzong\u2019s time, emperors would release their concubines when their reign came to an end. Since it often only took a couple of years for someone to get fed up and assassinate the king, that meant that being a concubine was only a temporary position.\n\nMark Oliver is a regular contributor to Listverse.

Since it often only took a couple of years for someone to get fed up and assassinate the king, that meant that being a concubine was only a temporary position.\n\nWhen his advisor, Lu Jia, wrote a flattering book about his victories, though, Gaozu changed his tune. In one of history\u2019s rare instances of someone admitting they were wrong, Gaozu set up Confucian schools across the empire and made it the state ideology.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just simple disinterest; education actively enraged him. In Gaozu\u2019s time, most scholars were followers of Confucius, and they walked with pointy hats. He spent most of his time launching into curse-filled tirades about how awful they were. When he actually saw a scholar, he\u2019d rip off the scholar\u2019s hat and pee in it .\n\nEmperor Gaozu wasn\u2019t the biggest supporter of education. He believed in military might and obedience to a strong, centralized government, and he didn\u2019t really see any point in wasting time learning to read or discussing philosophy. \u201cAll I possess I have won on horseback,\u201d he told one of his advisors. \u201cWhy should I bother with [the Books of] Odes and History?\u201d\n\nBy the end, Emperor Wu had more than 10,000 women in his harem. To choose his partner for the night, he would ride around in a cart drawn by goats. When the goats stopped, he\u2019d sleep with whichever woman they\u2019d brought him to.\n\nEmperor Wu dedicated most of his time to his harem. He would pull every pretty girl he could find out of her home to make her his concubine, especially preying on his officials\u2019 daughters. This, for Emperor Wu, was important work\u2014so much so that he made it a crime to get married until he was finished picking his concubines.\n\nOne of the major benefits of being the emperor was the harems. They were meant to be a little perk for ruling the country, but for Emperor Wu, they were more of a distraction.\n\nWu spent about eight months slowly and painfully dying before his body finally gave up, which was bad news for Meng. As his reward for soundly beating the king in a powerlifting contest, Meng and his entire family were hunted down and killed.\n\nThat love for lifting heavy things would be his end. One of the strongest men in the kingdom, Meng Yue, challenged him to a cauldron-lifting contest. It seems that Meng won: While Wu was lifting his cauldron up, his knees snapped , and he collapsed.\n\nKing Wu was a massive hulk of a man, obsessed with showing off his muscles. He valued strength above all else. He kicked all the book-reading nerds out of power and filled the highest ranks in his kingdom with musclemen, chosen for their ability to lift heavy things above their heads.\n\nAs you might expect, all that decadence didn\u2019t make King Zhou particularly popular. When he saw the people rising against him, Zhou set himself on fire\u2014because, apparently, he was better at coming up with ideas for parties than painless suicide methods. His pool of liquor was destroyed, and his successors, who were significantly less fun, banned alcohol across the kingdom.\n\nZhou ordered the construction of the Pool Of Wine And Forest Of Meat , which was exactly what the name suggests. This was a massive, man-made lake filled with nothing but liquor. It was big enough for several canoes. In the center of the pool was a little island, dotted with trees. The tree\u2019s branches, though, were skewers full of meat. Zhou and his concubines would pass their time drifting around in the canoes, drinking the liquor and plucking off meat.\n\nAs the reign of King Zhou went on, he started to get comfortable. He was the king of a great dynasty, and he resolved to enjoy it\u2014in some absolutely unbelievable ways.\n\nWhen a whole kingdom follows your every word, it can be hard to stay stable, but it\u2019s easy to fall into a decadent and unstable life. That much power can drive a man insane. Sometimes, it did.\n\nThe emperors of the ancient world held an incredible amount of power. Those who ruled over the kingdoms of ancient China were called the sons of Heaven. They were deified men whose every word was to be followed without question.\n\nMark Oliver is a regular contributor to Listverse.

He is also known for his interest in immortality, his huge funerary compound that contains some 8,000 life-sized terra-cotta soldiers, and for his contribution to the Great Wall of China .\n\nQin Shi Huang , also called Shihuangdi , Wade-Giles romanization Shih-huang-ti , personal name (xingming) Zhao Zheng or Ying Zheng , (born c. 259 bce, Qin state, northwestern China\u2014died 210 bce, Hebei), emperor (reigned 221\u2013210 bce) of the Qin dynasty (221\u2013207 bce) and creator of the first unified Chinese empire (which collapsed, however, less than four years after his death).\n\nUntil Zheng was officially declared of age in 238, his government was headed by L\u00fc Buwei. Zheng\u2019s first act as king was to execute his mother\u2019s lover, who had joined the opposition, and to exile L\u00fc, who had been involved in the affair. A decree ordering the expulsion of all aliens, which would have deprived the king of his most competent advisers, was annulled at the urging of Li Si , later grand councillor. By 221, with the help of espionage, extensive bribery, and the ruthlessly effective leadership of gifted generals, Zheng had eliminated one by one the remaining six rival states that constituted China at that time, and the annexation of the last enemy state, Qi , in 221 marked his final triumph: for the first time China was united, under the supreme rule of the Qin.\n\nWhen Zheng, at age 13, formally ascended the throne in 246 bce, Qin already was the most powerful state and was likely to unite the rest of China under its rule. The central states had considered Qin to be a barbarous country , but by that time its strong position on the mountainous western periphery (with its centre in the modern province of Shaanxi) enabled Qin to develop a strong bureaucratic government and military organization as the basis of the totalitarian state philosophy known as legalism .\n\nZhao Zheng was born the son of Zhuangxiang (who later became king of the state of Qin in northwestern China) while his father was held hostage in the state of Zhao. His mother was a former concubine of a rich merchant, L\u00fc Buwei , who, guided by financial interests, managed to install Zhuangxiang on the throne, even though he had not originally been designated as successor. The tradition, once widely accepted, that Zheng was actually L\u00fc Buwei\u2019s natural son is probably a slanderous invention.\n\nEmperor of China\n\nTo herald his achievement, Zheng assumed the sacred titles of legendary rulers and proclaimed himself Qin Shi Huang (\u201cFirst Sovereign Emperor\u201d). With unbounded confidence, he claimed that his dynasty would last \u201c10,000 generations.\u201d\n\nAs emperor he initiated a series of reforms aimed at establishing a fully centralized administration, thus avoiding the rise of independent satrapies. Following the example of Qin and at the suggestion of Li Si, he abolished territorial feudal power in the empire, forced the wealthy aristocratic families to live in the capital, Xianyang, and divided the country into 36 military districts, each with its own military and civil administrator. He also issued orders for almost universal standardization\u2014from weights, measures, and the axle lengths of carts to the written language and the laws. Construction of a network of roads and canals was begun, and fortresses erected for defense against barbarian invasions from the north were linked to form the Great Wall.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

While supervising the consolidation and organization of the empire, he did not neglect to perform sacrifices in various sacred places, announcing to the gods that he had finally united the empire, and he erected stone tablets with ritual inscriptions to extol his achievements.\n\nAnother motive for Qin Shi Huang\u2019s travels was his interest in magic and alchemy and his search for masters in these arts who could provide him with the elixir of immortality. After the failure of such an expedition to the islands in the Eastern Sea\u2014possibly Japan\u2014in 219, the emperor repeatedly summoned magicians to his court. Confucian scholars strongly condemned the step as charlatanry, and it is said that 460 of them were executed for their opposition. The continuous controversy between the emperor and Confucian scholars who advocated a return to the old feudal order culminated in the famous burning of the books of 213, when, at Li Si\u2019s suggestion, all books not dealing with agriculture, medicine, or prognostication were burned, except historical records of Qin and books in the imperial library.\n\nThe last years of Qin Shi Huang\u2019s life were dominated by an ever-growing distrust of his entourage\u2014at least three assassination attempts nearly succeeded\u2014and his increasing isolation from the common people. Almost inaccessible in his huge palaces, the emperor led the life of a semidivine being. In 210 Qin Shi Huang died during an inspection tour. He was buried in a gigantic funerary compound hewn out of a mountain and shaped in conformity with the symbolic patterns of the cosmos. (Excavation of this enormous complex of some 20 square miles [50 square km]\u2014now known as the Qin tomb\u2014began in 1974, and the complex was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987. Among the findings at the site were some 8,000 life-sized terra-cotta soldier and horse figures forming an \u201carmy\u201d for the dead king.) The disappearance of Qin Shi Huang\u2019s forceful personality immediately led to the outbreak of fighting among supporters of the old feudal factions that ended in the collapse of the Qin dynasty and the extermination of the entire imperial clan by 206.\n\nMost of the information about Qin Shi Huang\u2019s life derives from the successor Han dynasty, which prized Confucian scholarship and thus had an interest in disparaging the Qin period. The report that Qin Shi Huang was an illegitimate son of L\u00fc Buwei is possibly an invention of that epoch. Further, stories describing his excessive cruelty and the general defamation of his character must be viewed in the light of the distaste felt by the ultimately victorious Confucians for legalist philosophy in general.\n\nQin Shi Huang certainly had an imposing personality and showed an unbending will in pursuing his aim of uniting and strengthening the empire. His despotic rule and the draconian punishments he meted out were dictated largely by his belief in legalist ideas. With few exceptions, the traditional historiography of imperial China has regarded him as the villain par excellence, inhuman, uncultivated, and superstitious. Modern historians, however, generally stress the endurance of the bureaucratic and administrative structure institutionalized by Qin Shi Huang, which, despite its official denial, remained the basis of all subsequent dynasties in China."}, {"url": "https://www.answers.com/history-ec/Which_emperor_was_known_for_his_cruelty", "page_content": "Trending Questions\n\nIs it better to take a shower in the morning or at night?\n\nAsked By Laverna Senger\n\nWhat happened to Gregory redman Wallace of the HBO documentary lalee's kin the legacy of cotton?\n\nAsked By Wiki User\n\nWhat other letters fits in the following series B C D E you K O X?\n\nAsked By Wiki User\n\nWhat is Spider-Mans phone number?\n\nAsked By Wiki User\n\nCan smoke from wildfires cause signal loss to television network satellites?\n\nAsked By Wiki User\n\nWhat does iii over ooo brain teaser mean?\n\nAsked By Wiki User\n\nWhat North American city is 61 degrees N and 150 degrees W?\n\nAsked By Wiki User\n\nAlliteration with the letter R?"}, {"url": "https://thuvienpc.com/the-most-drunken-emperors-strange-hobby-in-chinese-history/", "page_content": "The most drunken emperor\u2019s strange hobby in Chinese history\n\nNorthern Qi is one of the 5 dynasties belonging to the Northern Dynasty in Chinese history. This dynasty ruled northern China from 550 to 577. Emperor Wenxuan (526\u2013559), nicknamed Gaoyang, alias Hien To, was the founding emperor of the Northern Qi dynasty.\n\nNorthern Qi Emperor Wenxuan \u2013 the only drunken king in Chinese history\n\nDuring the early period of his reign, Emperor Wenxuan paid special attention to military affairs, thus Northern Qi\u2019s military strength reached its peak at this time. Emperor Van Tuyen also had many effective strategies to reduce the people\u2019s tax burden.\n\nDuring the first three years of Emperor Wenxuan\u2019s reign, it was the Northern Qi court that was efficient and militarily strong. However, at the height of his fame, Emperor Van Tuyen became sadistic and had erratic behavior stemming mainly from his alcoholism. This, therefore, plunged his reign into chaos.\n\nIn the book Tu Chi Tongjian, Sima Quang describes Emperor Van Tuyen\u2019s alcoholism with great care as follows: \u201cDean Van Tuyen drank heavily and led a dissolute life, committing acts of violence according to his temporary will. I. Sometimes he sang and danced throughout night and all morning. Sometimes she let her hair down and put on a Ho dress with a colored shawl. Sometimes she walked around the palace naked and had her face painted.\n\nAlso according to Tu Tri Thong Giam, Emperor Van Tuyen often made unannounced visits to the homes of mandarin nobles and national princes when he was drunk. Some records indicate that this king of drunkenness sometimes slept on the street. Emperor Van Tuyen\u2019s habit of being naked when drunk was often shown by him in summer, but even in winter, the king was naked and running around.\n\nOnce, when Emperor Wenxuan was drunk, Empress Dowager Lou reprimanded him. In response, he threatens to marry off his\u2026 mother to an elderly Ho. When the Empress Dowager became angry, Emperor Van Tuyen lit a huge fire, intending to kill himself, causing the Imperial Palace to panic. After that, Emperor Wenxuan promised not to drink anymore, but he only did so for 10 days.\n\nBut if Emperor Van Tuyen only acted like this when he was drunk, that would be one thing. By the way, the North Korean Emperor\u2019s \u201cdrunk\u201d level then reached a new level, with his hobby of killing people while drunk. It is said that once while drunk and wandering the streets, Emperor Van Tuyen asked a woman: \u201cHow is Son of Heaven?\u201d. The woman replied, \u201cCrazy, crazy, the Son of Heaven doesn\u2019t exist\u201d. Enraged, Emperor Van Tuyen ordered this man\u2019s head to be beheaded right on the street.\n\nHe also shot arrows at Thoi Thi\u2019s mother-in-law (Empress Ly\u2019s mother) and whipped her. There is even a legend that most of the women in the royal Cao family were forced to have sex with Emperor Van Tuyen while he was drunk. When Gao Huan\u2019s concubine, Peng Thanh Thai\u2019s concubine Er Chu Anh Nga, refused, Emperor Wenxuan killed her with his own hands.\n\nTherefore, the great minister Yang Yin created a group of condemned prisoners (but not all of them died) to prohibit troops that could be used if Emperor Wenxuan wanted to kill people while drunk. Hence, whenever this drunken king wanted to kill, a condemned prisoner would be brought to him to satisfy his lust.\n\nOther sources record that, after being drunk with jealousy over a past concubine called Tiet Thi, Emperor Wenxuan beheaded her and kept her head in his sleeve. At the next banquet, he threw Xue Thi\u2019s head on a plate and chopped his body into several pieces, and started fiddling with his feet, frightening all the officials present. . At the end of the banquet, Emperor Wenxuan wrapped Tiet Thi\u2019s body parts and started to cry.\n\nWhen Emperor Wenxuan was drunk, he frequently beat his eldest son, Gao En, causing him to suffer such a severe mental crisis that he was unable to speak for a long time. In summer 559, while in a drunken stupor, Emperor Wenxuan suspected that members of the Northern Wei imperial family Yuan had finally devised a plan to regain power. So he ordered the Yuan family massacred, regardless of age or gender, and had their bodies dumped on Zhang Shui.\n\nIn autumn 559, Emperor Wenxuan fell seriously ill. Historians believe the disease stemmed from his alcoholism.

As the new emperor's brother, Gao Yan was created the Prince of Changshan. He received a number of official posts during Emperor Wenxuan's reign, and was said to have distinguished himself in his ability to govern despite his youth, and was known for his solemnity. However, he was also said to be so stern in his ways that if subordinates carried out incorrect actions, he would cane them severely. At times, he participated in military campaigns that Emperor Wenxuan personally commanded.\n\nEmperor Wenxuan ruled Northern Qi diligently early in his reign, but later in his reign, perhaps starting 554 or so, he began to act erratically and cruelly toward his officials and members of his own household. On one occasion, when invited to one of Emperor Wenxuan's feasts, his face showed sadness and anxiety, and Emperor Wenxuan deduced that he must have disapproved Emperor Wenxuan's preoccupation with drinking and women, and he declared that he would stop drinking\u2014although his abstension from alcohol only lasted for several days. Emperor Wenxuan also favored irreverent and sometimes immoral games within his palace, but when Gao Yan was present he would curb his behavior, and while Emperor Wenxuan was known for often visiting nobles' households and having sexual relations with their women, regardless of their relationships to him, he did not do so as to Gao Yan's household. During this period of Emperor Wenxuan's reign, then, Gao Yan became one of the only few individuals who would dare to try to get the emperor to change his behavior, although often only with temporary effect. On one occasion, Gao Yan offered a petition listing a number of behaviors that he believed Emperor Wenxuan should change\u2014and this caused Emperor Wenxuan to be exceedingly angry at him, threatening to kill him and sentencing Gao Yan's chief advisor, Wang Xi (\u738b\u550f), whom Emperor Wenxuan suspected to have contributed to the petition, to hard labor. In a later incident, Emperor Wenxuan, after having awarded Gao Yan a lady in waiting while drunk, forgot about the award after he became sober, and accused Gao Yan of stealing the lady in waiting, battering Gao Yan severely with a sword hilt. Gao Yan became angry and went on a hunger strike. Emperor Wenxuan, in order to placate Gao Yan, then agreed to release Wang Xi from hard labor and return him to Gao Yan's headquarters. Meanwhile, Emperor Wenxuan, who distrusted Eastern Wei's Yuan imperial household, of whom Gao Yan's wife Princess Yuan was a member, tried to get Gao Yan to divorce Princess Yuan, but Gao Yan refused, and when Emperor Wenxuan carried out a massacre of the Yuans in 559, it was at Gao Yan's earnest intercession that Emperor Wenxuan spared Princess Yuan's father Yuan Man (\u5143\u883b) and his family.\n\nEmperor Wenxuan's crown prince was his son Gao Yin, who was known for his studiousness, but Emperor Wenxuan, who, despite his Han ethnicity, favored Xianbei warrior ways, felt that Gao Yin was too Han in his thinking and repeatedly considered deposing him. Particularly when he was drunk, Emperor Wenxuan often stated that he would pass the throne to Gao Yan, and he stopped doing so only after being warned by his prime minister Yang Yin that his statements was potentially causing instability.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to his wife Empress Li Zu'e, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne.\" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei."}], "Emperor Wenxuan was known for his lack of filial piety.": [{"url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-chinese-history/article/early-representations-of-filial-piety-in-dynastic-historiography-textual-history-and-content-of-hou-han-shu-chapter-39/EED6A882FD90E3A31A571B1AF91F31E8", "page_content": "INTRODUCTION: MEMOIRS OF FILIAL Footnote 1 MEN IN DYNASTIC HISTORIES Tales about filial men are an important part of Chinese literatureFootnote 2 and the genre is also closely linked to historiography. From Shen Yue's \u6c88\u7d04 (441\u2013513) Song shu \u5b8b\u66f8 onward, the majority of the collective chapter sections found in the dynastic histories include a chapter with biographies of men who are remembered for the unusual devotion they showed in nurturing their parents and relatives. In all, 16 of the 24 dynastic histories\u2014exactly two-thirds\u2014contain such a chapter.Footnote 3 It has, therefore, to be considered one of the standard components of the annals-biographies style (jizhuan ti \u7d00\u50b3\u9ad4).Footnote 4 Judging by the earliest appearance of such a collective chapter, one could assume that the origins of the close link between the genre of tales of filial piety and this style of historiography lie somewhere in the second half of the Six Dynasties period.Footnote 5 In light of how important filiality was for the selection of officials during the Western Han (207 BCE\u20139 CE) and the Eastern Han dynasty (25\u2013220 CE) this seems late.Footnote 6 One would rather expect the histories of dynasties that selected candidates for their filiality to contain some form of historiographical representation of this fact. And, as this paper will demonstrate, it is indeed misleading to look only at the collective chapter sections at the end of the dynastic histories. Fan Ye's \u8303\u66c4 (398\u2013446) history of the Later Han dynasty, the Hou Han shu \u5f8c\u6f22\u66f8, does contain a forerunner of the later memoirs of filial and righteous men. But the way it was inserted into the Hou Han shu does not immediately point to it being a collection of biographies of filial men. This is due to two reasons: for one, the title does not suggest any relationship with filial piety. The chapter is usually not called a xiaoyi \u5b5d\u7fa9, xiaoyou \u5b5d\u53cb, or xiaoxing \u5b5d\u884c liezhuan like the ones in later histories. It is instead referred to in accordance with the family names of the men it contains: Memoirs of Liu, Zhao, Chunyu, Jiang, Liu, Zhou and Zhao \u5289\u8d99\u6df3\u4e8e\u6c5f\u5289\u5468\u8d99\u5217\u50b3\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5341\u4e5d. It consists of seven main biographies for Liu Ping \u5289\u5e73, Zhao Xiao \u8d99\u5b5d, Chunyu Gong \u6df3\u4e8e\u606d, Jiang Ge \u6c5f\u9769, Liu Ban \u5289\u822c, Zhou Pan \u5468\u78d0, and Zhao Zi \u8d99\u54a8, and eight subordinated biographies that were included because of some form of tie to the main biographies. These treat Wang Wang \u738b\u671b and Wang Fu \u738b\u6276, who were recommended along with Liu Ping; Liu Kai \u5289\u6137, who was included because of his father Liu Ban; and Cai Shun \u8521\u9806, Wei Tan \u9b4f\u8b5a, Wang Lin \u738b\u7433, Ermeng Ziming \u5152\u840c\u5b50\u660e, and Checheng Ziwei \u8eca\u6210\u5b50\u5a01, about each of whom the historian tells one or more short tales of filial piety or righteousness that are similar to the ones seen in the life descriptions of the main biography holders. In addition to these fifteen biographies of varying length, the chapter briefly relates the stories of Mao Yi \u6bdb\u7fa9 and Xue Bao \u859b\u5305 in the preface, in order to give the reader short examples of what kind of biographies he can expect to read in the Chapter.Footnote 7 The second deviation from the latter norm that keeps readers from immediately connecting the chapter to the later Xiaoyi chapters is its placement. Fan Ye did not group it together with the other collective chapters with biographies of scholars, literati, eunuchs, magicians, etc., which are found at the end of his work.Footnote 8 Instead, he inserted it at the end of the section with biographies of officials who served under the Emperors Ming \u660e\u5e1d (r. 57\u201375) and Zhang \u7ae0\u5e1d (r. 75\u201388).Footnote 9 The reason for this is unclear. It might be that Fan Ye wanted to stress the important role filial office holders played during the reigns of these two emperors. It might also be that he simply chose this arrangement because the majority of the people in the chapter lived during these reigns.Footnote 10 Despite these two misleading factors, however, the chapter's structure and content make it clear that Fan Ye collected biographies that revolve around the value of filial piety (xiao \u5b5d). The chapter opens with a discussion of filiality and the biographies contain roughly twenty anecdotes in which filial acts are described. Fan Ye was not the first to compile such a chapter but rather followed the example given by his predecessor Hua Qiao \u83ef\u5da0 (?\u2013293).Footnote 11 Hua Qiao compiled a Han Hou shu \u6f22\u5f8c\u66f8 during the Western Jin dynasty and thus about 150 years prior to Fan Ye. Although this work is no longer available, thanks to the quotation of Hua's chapter preface on the value of filial piety (which will be analyzed in the next section) in Yuan Hong's \u8881\u5b8f Hou Han ji \u6f22\u5f8c\u7d00Footnote 12 and discussions of his history in works like the Shitong \u53f2\u901a, we know that it already contained a chapter about filial men. Fan Ye seems to have stuck closely to this predecessor. He copied Hua Qiao's preface and used it as an opening for his own chapter.Footnote 13 As far as we can tell today, he also included mostly the same historical figures that Hua did in his version.Footnote 14 This leads to many questions. Why did historians who worked a long time after the fall of the Later Han start to gather biographies of filial exemplars? What was the nature of their sources? What role did filiality play for the biographies? What is the relationship between the chapter and the society in which it was compiled? Much about this early historiographical representation of filiality is still unclear, as, so far, Chapter 39 has not been analyzed in detail. Donald HolzmanFootnote 15 and Keith KnappFootnote 16 used it to varying extents for their works on filial piety tales and the Hua Qiao quotation that acts as a preface attracted some attention,Footnote 17 but as yet, there is no study dedicated to its content and textual history. The following pages are an attempt to fill that gap and, in particular, they pursue three goals: Firstly, the paper wants to analyze the textual basis of Fan Ye's chapter and try to reconstruct the compilation process as far as possible. In order to see what Hua Qiao and Fan's roles were in the creation of the text, it will take a look at the various fragments from preceding works on the Later Han dynasty. Secondly, it wants to assess the nature of the role filial piety plays in the chapter. As we will see, this is the key to understanding what sets the precursor apart from the later, more standardized representatives of Xiaoyi chapters. Thirdly and lastly, it wants to answer the question of just what it meant to be an exemplar of these values according to Fan Ye and Hua Qiao. Careful analysis of the preface and of the most common motives used in the individual biographies will hopefully shed some light on the many open questions surrounding the chapter.\n\nTHE TEXTUAL HISTORY OF CHAPTER 39 The first question to be addressed is the one of the textual history and the compilation process of Chapter 39. If Fan Ye had authored all the content of his Hou Han shu, this would place it in the first half of the fifth century CE, and, thus, close to the first known collective chapter on filial men by Shen Yue. But the Hou Han shu is a relatively young recompilation of earlier histories of the Later Han dynasty and all the biographies it contains have predecessors. As described in the introduction, through fragments and information contained in the Shitong Fan Ye's chapter can be relatively safely traced back to Hua Qiao's chapter on filial men compiled during the Western Jin dynasty. Therefore, the idea to gather a collective chapter on filial men precedes Fan Ye by more than 150 years. Usually, the research into the compilation history of the chapter ends here. But with our knowledge of the historiography of the Later Han dynasty, we can trace the source of the contents that Hua and Fan used a little further back and learn more about when these biographies were written. The most important source for the content of the Hou Han shu and all its predecessors\u2014including, therefore, Hua Qiao's workFootnote 18\u2014was the Dongguan Han ji \u6771\u89c0\u6f22\u8a18, a history in the annals-biography style that was started by Ban Gu \u73ed\u56fa (32\u201392) and that was extended in several steps during the Later Han dynasty (25\u2013220).Footnote 19 Owing to the tumultuous times after the fall of the Later Han and the repeated change of capitals, the original documents in the archives were lost, which quickly turned the government-sponsored enterprise Dongguan han ji Footnote 20 into the main source for the events of most of the dynasty. Bai Shouyi, therefore, once called it a \u201ctreasury for historical materials on the Later Han dynasty\u201d \u4e1c\u6c49\u5386\u53f2\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5b9d\u5e93 and concluded that \u201cthe histories of the Later Han dynasty by the succeeding authors all made it the basis for their materials\u201d \u6b64\u540e\u8bf8\u5bb6\u540e\u6c49\u53f2\u8457\u4f5c\uff0c\u57fa\u672c\u90fd\u4ee5\u5b83\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u6750\u6599\u6765\u6e90.Footnote 21 This was also most probably what Liu Xie \u5289\u52f0 (465?\u2013521?) had in mind, when he remarked in his Wenxin diaolong \u6587\u5fc3\u96d5\u9f8d that \u201cthe annals and biographies on the Later Han had their source in the Eastern Watchtower\u201d \u81f3\u65bc\u5f8c\u6f22\u7d00\u50b3\uff0c\u767c\u6e90\u6771\u89c0.Footnote 22 The quality of the compilation, however, did not meet the standards of many literati and the widespread dissatisfaction it caused led to a boom of recompilations during the Six Dynasties.Footnote 23 Pulleyblank writes: \u201cThe work of the government-sponsored historians in the Tung-kuan Library in the second century CE provided basic material for the history of the Later Han, but the work which they produced was not considered very satisfactory and there were numerous attempts by private persons to write histories of that dynasty [\u2026].\u201dFootnote 24 The results of these attempts are the two still extant works\u2014Fan Ye's Hou Han shu and Yuan Hong's Hou Han ji\u2014as well as seven works, now lost, which are together with the Dongguan Han ji collectively known as the Eight Authors of Later Han histories \u516b\u5bb6\u5f8c\u6f22\u66f8.Footnote 25 Table 1 shows the histories in roughly the order of compilation The fact that the Dongguan Han ji was one of the main sources, or perhaps the main source, for all later works on the Eastern Han dynasty naturally also affects Chapter 39 of Fan Ye's Hou Han shu. While Hua Qiao's work was a predecessor, it was certainly not the only one, and neither Hua nor Fan wrote the contents of their chapters from scratch. From our theoretical knowledge of the Later Han historiography we rather have to assume that the Dongguan Han ji was the original source for their materials. Keith Knapp has already traced the origins of individual biographies back to the Dongguan Han ji: Han Records of the Eastern Pavilion (Dongguan Han ji)\u2026 was the first state-sponsored history that devoted biographies to people who were important solely because of their outstanding filiality.\u2026 Thus perhaps by the beginning of the second century AD, court historians were already devoting biographies to individuals who were noteworthy solely because of their filial piety.Footnote 26 The question that still needs to be addressed is how many biographies of filial men the Dongguan Han ji already contained. Only fragments remain of the workFootnote 27 and the other preceding histories of the Later Han, but these still allow us to make at least a rough estimate of how much material was already included in the older work.Footnote 28 Table 2 marks the availability of fragments for the biographies of Chapter 39 in the various works on the Later Han dynasty with an \u201cx\u201d: Table 2 strongly suggests that the majority of the men in Chapter 39 already had a biography somewhere in the Dongguan Han ji and that the materials were then used by the other authors of Later Han histories. It seems to be slightly more difficult to find fragments for the subordinated biographies, but this is probably a result of their brevity rather than their being based on later materials. Considering the relative scarcity of the fragments, it is safe to assume that some of the unaccounted biographies, too, were already included in the work. But the fragments prove more than the mere existence of biographies for most of these historical figures already during the Later Han dynasty. They also suggest that their form and content did not change much since the initial versions in the Dongguan Han ji. Bielenstein writes on Fan Ye's way of compiling his work that \u201cin rearranging the material, Fan Ye did not rewrite it. He copied his sources so closely as actually sometimes to make the HHS inconsistent.\u201dFootnote 29 This is both true for his compilation of Chapter 39 and for the other historians of the Later Han dynasty. If one compares the various fragments with today's Hou Han shu, it becomes apparent that the historians who worked after the fall of the Later Han dynasty mostly compiled and adjusted existing materials and only rarely created new content. A telling example is the biography of Mao Yi, which served both Fan Ye and Hua Qiao as an introductory example for their chapters. It is also included in the Hou Han ji and there are fragments of the Dongguan Han ji, Hua Qiao's Han Hou shu and Xie Cheng's Hou Han shu. These are the versions found in Dongguan Han ji and Hou Han shu: The textual version of the Hou Han shu is longer, and the passage of the Dongguan Han ji ends rather abruptly,Footnote 32 but the close relationship between the fragments is still visible. The other fragments are virtually identical.Footnote 33 Finding that many fragments of the same anecdote is rare, but there are many other less complete examples that clearly point in the same direction. One more should suffice here to give a good impression of the similarities. This is the beginning of the first anecdote in Xue Bao's biography, the second introductory example of Chapter 39: It is again obvious that the common ancestor of all the versions is the Dongguan Han ji.Footnote 36 These were just two examples of the filial piety tales in Chapter 39 that can be traced back to the Dongguan Han ji. In all, more than a third of the roughly twenty filial piety anecdotes that will be analysed in detail in Section Five of this paper can be proven to have been written during the Later Han dynasty through the help of fragments.Footnote 37 These are: Wang Lin offers to sacrifice himself (HHS 39.1300 - DGHJ 15.645), Liu Ping offers to sacrifice himself (HHS 39.1296 - DGHJ 15.639), Zhao Xiao offers to sacrifice himself (HHS 39.1299 - DGHJ 15.641), Jiang Ge pulls the cart for his mother (HHS 39.1302 - DGHJ 15.648), Zhao Zi welcomes thieves (HHS 39.1313 - DGHJ 15.654), Liu Kai yields his fief to his younger brother (HHS 39.1306 - DGHJ 15.652), Liu Ping sacrifices his own son for his brother's daughter (HHS 39.1295f - DGHJ 15.639), Wei Tan offers to sacrifice himself (HHS 15.645- DGHJ 15.643), and Wang Lin grieves for his parents (HHS 39.1300 - DGHJ 15.645). For all these anecdotes we can find fragments that strongly suggest that they had been written long prior to the time Fan Ye and Hua Qiao worked with them. Taken together, the fragments therefore prove that the roots of most of Fan Ye's and Hua Qiao's contents go back all the way to the Dongguan Han ji, which was compiled during the Eastern Han dynasty.Footnote 38 This should not be mistaken to mean that all the Later Han historians told the same stories. Through selecting and adapting their sources they were able to express their own opinions. But the materials they used in doing so can be traced back to the same source. Therefore, the content of these chapters precedes Shen Yue's first proper Xiaoyi chapter in the Song shu by three centuries and already during the Later Han dynasty exemplars of filial piety played an important role for the historiographical tradition. They just had not yet found their later typical place in a collective chapter and were instead most probably still spread over the whole work. For reasons that we will look at now, Hua Qiao decided to gather them in a chapter devoted specially to filiality and Fan Ye later accepted his solution.\n\nPREFACE AND CONTENTS OF THE CHAPTER Why did Hua Qiao and Fan Ye decide to change the structure of their source and compile a chapter on filial men? The answer to this is given in the preface of Chapter 39, in which filial piety is introduced as the leitmotif.Footnote 39 The piece starts with a collection of quotations from classical sources, in which the connection between filiality (xiao \u5b5d) and nourishing (yang \u990a) is touched upon (translations of the three quotations: Legge): Master Kong said: \u201cIn filiality nothing is greater than being in awe of one's father. In being in awe of one's father nothing is greater than matching him with Heaven. The duke of Zhou was such a man.\u201dFootnote 40 Zilu said: \u201cAlas, the poor! While [their parents] are alive, they have nothing to nourish them. When they are dead, they have nothing to bury them with.\u201d The master said: \u201cSipping bean [soup] and drinking water; that is filiality.\u201dFootnote 41 \u5b54\u5b50\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u592b\u5b5d\u83ab\u5927\u65bc\u56b4\u7236\uff0c\u56b4\u7236\u83ab\u5927\u65bc\u914d\u5929\uff0c\u5247\u5468\u516c\u5176\u4eba\u4e5f\u3002\u300d\u5b50\u8def\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u50b7\u54c9\u8ca7\u4e5f\uff01\u751f\u7121\u4ee5\u990a\uff0c\u6b7b\u7121\u4ee5\u846c\u3002\u300d\u5b50\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u555c\u83fd\u98f2\u6c34\uff0c\u5b5d\u4e5f\u3002\u300d The first quotation establishes the necessity to take care of the parents. The latter two revolve around the means necessary to do so and Hua Qiao picks up this point in the next paragraph, in which he expresses his own thoughts on the nature of the relationship of nourishing and filiality: Bell and drum are [only instruments and] not the origin of music, but the instruments can't be neglected.Footnote 42 [Nourishing with the flesh of the] three domestic animals is not the most important part of filial piety, but for nourishing it can't be neglected. Keeping the instruments [in mind] but forgetting about the origins lets the music get out of control. [But] tuning the instruments in order to harmonize their sound leads to the perfection of music. Venerating and nourishing [by means obtained] through harmful behavior weakens one's filial piety. [But] cultivating oneself in order to attain the salary of an official post augments one's nourishing. \u592b\u937e\u9f13\u975e\u6a02\u4e91\u4e4b\u672c\uff0c\u800c\u5668\u4e0d\u53ef\u53bb\uff1b\u4e09\u7272\u975e\u81f4\u5b5d\u4e4b\u4e3b\uff0c\u800c\u990a\u4e0d\u53ef\u5ee2\u3002\u5b58\u5668\u800c\u5fd8\u672c\uff0c\u6a02\u4e4b\u9041\u4e5f\uff1b\u8abf\u5668\u4ee5\u548c\u8072\uff0c\u6a02\u4e4b\u6210\u4e5f\u3002\u5d07\u990a\u4ee5\u50b7\u884c\uff0c\u5b5d\u4e4b\u7d2f\u4e5f\uff1b\u8129\u5df1\u4ee5\u81f4\u797f\uff0c\u990a\u4e4b\u5927\u4e5f\u3002 Hua Qiao thus explains the close connection of proper behavior, holding an official position and being able to nurture one's relatives in the correct way. He compares the meaning of holding an official post for filial piety with the one of instruments for music and of meat for a proper diet.Footnote 43 The preface then continues to elaborate what was already hinted at in the last sentence of the preceding paragraph: that simply attaining an office is not enough. To be considered filial it is not sufficient to simply obtain the resources necessary to nourish one's relatives via an official post. In order to truly fulfill the ideal the office holder must also do his best to cultivate himself and to serve the state to the fullest: If we therefore speak about the ability of nourishing in a grand way, then the sacrifices made by the Duke of Zhou [may serve as an illustration], as these sacrifices reached the entire world. If we speak about nourishing in a righteous way, then the beans of Zhongyou (Zilu \u5b50\u8def) tasted sweater than the [ox] sacrificed by the eastern neighbor.Footnote 44 As to worries about the lacking quality of water and beans: he who [only] strives for an official salary because he wants to nourish brings disgrace [to the idea] of nourishing relatives with a salary. He who maintains his honesty in order to perfect his behavior, who amasses filial piety and whose salary for a government position is generous is able to nourish righteously. \u6545\u8a00\u80fd\u5927\u990a\uff0c\u5247\u5468\u516c\u4e4b\u7940\uff0c\u81f4\u56db\u6d77\u4e4b\u796d\uff1b\u8a00\u4ee5\u7fa9\u990a\uff0c\u5247\u4ef2\u7531\u4e4b\u83fd\uff0c\u7518\u65bc\u6771\u9130\u4e4b\u7272\u3002\u592b\u60a3\u6c34\u83fd\u4e4b\u8584\uff0c\u5e72\u797f\u4ee5\u6c42\u990a\u8005\uff0c\u662f\u4ee5\u6065\u797f\u89aa\u4e5f\u3002\u5b58\u8aa0\u4ee5\u76e1\u884c\uff0c\u5b5d\u7a4d\u800c\u797f\u539a\u8005\uff0c\u6b64\u80fd\u4ee5\u7fa9\u990a\u4e5f\u3002Footnote 45 Hua Qiao and Fan Ye were therefore interested in biographies of men who had the quality of filial piety and, at the same time, excelled in government positions through their high level of self-cultivation. This in return provided them with the means to nourish their parents. In order to further elaborate this point, the two historians included two short examples,Footnote 46 the above already partially quoted biographies of Mao Yi and Xue Bao.Footnote 47 They both describe highly filial sons who eventually take up offices, display appropriate behavior, and are heavily rewarded by the emperor for this.Footnote 48 After the two short accounts, Fan Ye and Hua Qiao finish their introduction with the following words: These two sons applied the utmost honesty when they acted. In their behavior they trusted their hearts and [through this] they moved others. Because of their accomplished reputations they obtained an official salary and received gifts [from the emperor]. This can be called being able to nourish by means of [possessing the value of] filial piety. The correct behavior of Jiang Ge, Liu Pan and many other excellences also [displays] this will. I therefore gathered their deeds in this chapter. \u82e5\u4e8c\u5b50\u8005\uff0c\u63a8\u81f3\u8aa0\u4ee5\u70ba\u884c\uff0c\u884c\u4fe1\u65bc\u5fc3\u800c\u611f\u65bc\u4eba\uff0c\u4ee5\u6210\u540d\u53d7\u797f\u81f4\u79ae\uff0c\u65af\u53ef\u8b02\u80fd\u4ee5\u5b5d\u990a\u4e5f\u3002\u82e5\u592b\u6c5f\u9769\u3001\u5289\u822c\u6578\u516c\u8005\u4e4b\u7fa9\u884c\uff0c\u7336\u65af\u5fd7\u4e5f\u3002\u64b0\u5176\u884c\u4e8b\u8457\u4e8e\u7bc7\u3002Footnote 49 In this preface Fan Ye and Hua Qiao explain that they saw a close connection between filiality and an official career and that they therefore set themselves the goal of collecting biographies of successful filial office holders. We do not know exactly how Hua Qiao continued his chapter, as the fragments for his biography section are very few. But that at least Fan Ye stuck closely to this leitmotif becomes clearer when looking at the careers of the seven main individuals he described. Table 3 shows the recommendations and offices that were offered to them. Table 3 shows several things: Firstly, the majority of the main biography holders were recommended as filial and incorruptible (xiaolian \u5b5d\u5ec9). Secondly, the careers of the men were quite similar. Most of them held consulting offices like Court Advisor \u8b70\u90ce or Grandee Remonstrant and Consultant \u8aeb\u8b70\u5927\u592b. Thirdly, two even made it into the ranks of the Three Officials \u4e09\u516c and Nine Ministers \u4e5d\u537f and became Directors of the Imperial Clan \u5b97\u6b63. The biographies thus mirror Fan Ye's and Hua Qiao's explanations and focus on men who were revered for their filiality, obtained an office and, in a few cases, gained considerable political importance. To conclude this section: Hua Qiao and later Fan Ye included a preface in which the close connection of filial piety and official positions is explained and then selected biographies of men who were exemplars of that. The subjects of the biographies were, in most cases, recommended as filial and incorruptible, and many of them attained high offices. Keith Knapp suggested that \u201cin History of the Han's Later [Half], filial heroes were still not so significant that their chapter merited a special name or place within the history.\u201dFootnote 50 However, the careers of the men make it clear that Fan Ye did not mean filing the biographies among the other important officials of the reigns of emperors Ming and Zhang and not giving it a name typical for a collective chapter to be derogatory. What Hua Qiao and he actually did was to compile a chapter on important officials of this time who were known and selected for their filial piety and whose biographies had previously been arranged according to different criteria in the Dongguan Han ji.\n\nTHE CONNECTION BETWEEN CHAPTER 39 AND THE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM OF THE LATER HAN In order to understand the reason behind this we have to briefly turn to the recommendation system of the Later Han and especially the category of \u201cfilial and incorruptible\u201d (xiaolian \u5b5d\u5ec9), through which almost all the officials in Chapter 39 had begun their official careers. A recommendation was one of the most important ways to achieve an office during the Later Han dynasty. As Holcombe in his study In the Shadow of the Han writes: \u201cThere were\u2026 three specific ways to be recommended for government office. These were \u2018local recommendation\u2019 (hs\u00fcan-ch\u00fc), direct summons either by the emperor himself or by a ranking official, and inheritance\u2014the \u2018appointment of sons\u2019 (jen-tzu). Among the three, inheritance did not lead directly to any significant office, and direct summons were of limited application, leaving \u2018local recommendation\u2019 to become a kind of standard channel into the imperial bureaucracy.\u201dFootnote 51 There were several categories according to which a candidate could be recommended for office,Footnote 52 but \u201cfilial and incorruptible\u201d was the most common one in the Later Han dynasty. In all, we find the phrase \u201cwas recommended as filial and incorruptible\u201d (ju xiaolian \u64e7\u5b5d\u5ec9) a staggering 120 times in the Hou Han shu. Already the emperors of the Western Han dynasty started to appoint candidates for office according to their filiality and this way of selecting officials gained steadily in importance throughout the course of the dynasty.Footnote 53 In one of his edicts Emperor Huan \u6853 (r. 146\u201368) summarizes his high esteem for the category in the following words: \u201cFilial and incorruptible men and incorruptible officials are the ones who ought to administer cities and tend to the people and who ought to restrict the criminals and recommend good [men]. They are the root of prosperity and reform and they always have to be made the foundation\u201d \u4e19\u620c\uff0c\u8a54\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u5b5d\u5ec9\u3001\u5ec9\u540f\u7686\u7576\u5178\u57ce\u7267\u6c11\uff0c\u7981\u59e6\u8209\u5584\uff0c\u8208\u5316\u4e4b\u672c\uff0c\u6046\u5fc5\u7531\u4e4b.Footnote 54 For most times there were fixed annual quotas for people that had to be recommended according to this category, but the emperors could increase or decrease the amount of recommended men according to the current needs of the state, as it happened for example in the year 102 CE, when the following edict was issued: \u201cThe border commanderies with more than a hundred thousand inhabitants should each recommend one filial and incorruptible man per year. The ones with less than a hundred thousand inhabitants should recommend one man every second year and those with less than fifty thousand inhabitants one every three years.\u201d \u5176\u4ee4\u7de3\u908a\u90e1\u53e3\u5341\u842c\u4ee5\u4e0a\u6b72\u8209\u5b5d\u5ec9\u4e00\u4eba\uff0c\u4e0d\u6eff\u5341\u842c\u4e8c\u6b72\u8209\u4e00\u4eba\uff0c\u4e94\u842c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4e09\u6b72\u8209\u4e00\u4eba.Footnote 55 Hans Bielenstein analyzed and described the recommendation system in his study on the bureaucracy of the Han, but there are still some aspects of the process that are not clear. One of the biggest open questions is what the two values \u201cfilial\u201d (xiao) and \u201cincorruptible\u201d (lian) actually meant during the Later Han dynasty. We can at least partially address this problem by analyzing the short stories or anecdotes that are occasionally provided by Fan Ye to explain the reason for a recommendation. From looking at these it becomes clear that the described acts usually fall either in the category of \u201cfilial\u201d or in the one of \u201cincorruptible.\u201d Many of them have little to no connection to filiality and instead rather tell us stories that demonstrate that somebody could not be influenced or tempted by wealth and riches, like in the following examples: Feng later met bandits. All his possessions were taken from him and only seven bolts of silk remained whose whereabouts the bandits did not know about. Feng thereupon chased after them and handed the [bolts] to them, saying: \u201cI know that you gentlemen are in need. Therefore I leave these to you as a present.\u201d The bandits were surprised and said: \u201cThis is a worthy man.\u201d They returned all his goods to him. Later he was recommended as filial and incorruptible. \u5c01\u5f8c\u9047\u8cca\uff0c\u8ca1\u7269\u6089\u88ab\u7565\u596a\uff0c\u552f\u9918\u7e11\u4e03\u5339\uff0c\u8cca\u4e0d\u77e5\u8655\uff0c\u5c01\u4e43\u8ffd\u4ee5\u8207\u4e4b\uff0c\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u77e5\u8af8\u541b\u4e4f\uff0c\u6545\u9001\u76f8\u907a\u3002\u300d\u8cca\u9a5a\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u6b64\u8ce2\u4eba\u4e5f\u3002\u300d\u76e1\u9084\u5176\u5668\u7269\u3002\u5f8c\u8209\u5b5d\u5ec9\uff0cFootnote 56 This story contains no mention of relatives; instead it demonstrates that Feng would not be corrupted by possessions. If this was the reason for his recommendation\u2014which Fan Ye's order of the events strongly suggests\u2014, we have to assume that this act somehow fulfilled the requirements for somebody who was considered incorruptible (lian). The next example is very similar: Yu was sincere, generous and frugal. His father died and the officials and inhabitants of Ji supported him with huge sums of money, but he would not accept any of it. He also gave his fields and his house to his uncle and went to live somewhere else. In the eighth year he was recommended as filial and incorruptible. He was gradually promoted. \u79b9\u6027\u7be4\u539a\u7bc0\u5109\u3002\u7236\u5352\uff0c\u6c72\u540f\u4eba\u8cfb\u9001\u524d\u5f8c\u6578\u767e\u842c\uff0c\u6089\u7121\u6240\u53d7\u3002\u53c8\u4ee5\u7530\u5b85\u63a8\u8207\u4f2f\u7236\uff0c\u8eab\u81ea\u5bc4\u6b62\u3002\u6c38\u5e73\u516b\u5e74\uff0c\u8209\u5b5d\u5ec9\uff0c\u7a0d\u9077\uff1bFootnote 57 Again, we find the description of a man who willingly gave up everything, also for people outside of his family, and in return was recommended as filial and incorruptible. The Hou Han shu contains many more of these stories, some also very short, like the following example: Tan Bao, style Wenyou, was a native of Xiaqiu in Shanyang. In his youth he became a scholar. His family was poor but his intentions were pure. He would not accept any alms from his home village. He was recommended as filial and incorruptible and repeatedly summoned by the Offices of the Excellences, but he did not go to any of them. \u6a80 \u5b57\u6587\u6709\uff0c\u5c71\u967d\u7455\u4e18\u4eba\u4e5f\u3002\u5c11\u70ba\u8af8\u751f\uff0c\u5bb6\u8ca7\u800c\u5fd7\u6e05\uff0c\u4e0d\u53d7\u9109\u91cc\u65bd\u60e0\u3002\u8209\u5b5d\u5ec9\uff0c\u9023\u8f9f\u516c\u5e9c\uff0c\u7686\u4e0d\u5c31\u3002Footnote 58 These men were not interested in possessions and demonstrated that they could not be corrupted, which qualified them for office. The anecdotes that describe a candidate's filiality are more in accordance with our notions of the value. We find, for example, the well-known trope of the son who grieves himself to the verge of death over his parents\u2019 grave: Biao's filial behavior was pure. His parents died and he ruined [his body] for three years. He did not leave the grave hut. When the funeral service was finished, he was weak and emaciated. Only after several years of medical treatment was he able to get up again\u2026. At the end of the Jianwu period he was recommended as filial and incorruptible. \u5f6a\u5b5d\u884c\u7d14\u81f3\uff0c\u7236\u6bcd\u5352\uff0c\u54c0\u6bc0\u4e09\u5e74\uff0c\u4e0d\u51fa\u5eec\u5bd1\u3002\u670d\u7adf\uff0c\u7fb8\u7620\u9aa8\u7acb\u7570\u5f62\uff0c\u91ab\u7642\u6578\u5e74\u4e43\u8d77\u3002[\u2026] \u5efa\u6b66\u672b\uff0c\u8209\u5b5d\u5ec9\uff0c[\u2026].Footnote 59 Extreme acts were not necessary. One version of filiality seems to have been the transmission of the family's teachings, as we see in the following example: Dian, style Gongya, again transmitted his family's teachings. As a Master of Writing he taught in Yingchuan and had several hundred disciples. He was recommended as filial and incorruptible and became a Gentleman. \u5178\u5b57\u516c\u96c5\uff0c\u5fa9\u50b3\u5176\u5bb6\u696d\uff0c\u4ee5\u5c1a\u66f8\u6559\u6388\u6f41\u5ddd\uff0c\u9580\u5f92\u6578\u767e\u4eba\u3002\u8209\u5b5d\u5ec9\u70ba\u90ce\u3002Footnote 60 Chapter 39 abounds in filiality anecdotes and as Section Five of this paper is an attempt to categorize them, these two examples are sufficient for now. From the observations made so far we can conclude the following: a recommendation as filial and incorruptible was one of the most important ways into office during the Later Han and the value of filiality was one of the cornerstones of the state ideology. People who committed either filial or incorruptible acts gathered local fame, were recommended and then received offices. The stories surrounding the recommendation made their way into the historiographical material. This leads to the second open question surrounding these materials. As Section Five will demonstrate in more detail, the literary depiction of filiality is often both highly stereotypical and exaggerated, which throws some doubt on its authenticity. The question of the historical accuracy or truth behind the filiality anecdotes is therefore still debated. Donald Holzman argues for the truthfulness and reliability of the described acts. He compares them to phenomena like religious fundamentalism (\u201cI believe they are true accounts of life in the Latter Han dynasty\u201d). Hans Bielenstein, on the other hand, is very skeptical and believes them to be rhetorical tropes to describe circumstances or formalized praise for historical figures.Footnote 61 We will never know the answer, but in light of the political role filiality played I would argue that it is too rash to discard the stories as mere rhetorical devices or tales made up by the subjects themselves, their families, or the historians. Let's look, for example, at the motive of somebody being willing to be eaten by hungry bandits in order to make them spare the life of a relative (this will be analyzed in more detail in Section Five). Hans Bielenstein interpreted these and other tales about cannibalism found in the Hou Han shu as a way to give the reader a clearer picture of difficult living conditions: \u201cOne should not literally understand that people now and then resorted to cannibalism. The historian is not interested in recording that cases of cannibalism perchance had occurred. He only wants to stress that the famine was serious.\u201dFootnote 62 Bielenstein himself has impressively demonstrated that the Later Han dynasty experienced many calamities and famines, especially in its beginning, where many of the tales in Chapter 39 are situated.Footnote 63 But the formalized and detailed way in which the tales are told suggests a function that exceeds Fan Ye's wish to describe times of famine. Otherwise, he could have simply written that the times were so bad that cannibalism happened repeatedly. This is indeed something the historian occasionally did. The Hou Han shu contains twelve references to \u201cpeople eating one another\u201d \u4eba\u76f8\u98df.Footnote 64 Instead, Fan Ye decided to give his readers these highly standardized and quite complex stories about people, who through outstanding behavior and a high level of self-cultivation influenced society. It seems more plausible to me that the main function of the tales was to characterize their protagonist and that the records reflect what the government had heard about a candidate from officials or the population. These stories about filiality and incorruptibility seem to be the reasons the candidates were recommended, rumors that reached the ears of local officials and were later written down by court officials to be kept in the archives. What makes the filiality stories so hard to believe is that they seem strange and stereotypical from a modern point of view, but that does not mean that they never happened. Holzman makes the convincing argument that the demand for people in certain categories triggered such actions in the society: \u201cThere can be no doubt whatever that one of the main incentives to filial behavior was the rewards the Han government was willing to give to filial sons. Even more important than rewards, the government created an official title that was often the first step for an otherwise unknown man of the provinces to be promoted to an official post.\u201dFootnote 65 The exact procedure of how the filiality tales came to be written down and combined with the other information about the historical individual is not clear. But with the Dongguan Han ji and the other Later Han histories Fan Ye and Hua Qiao had access to a big collection of biographies in which filiality played an important role. The importance of the category \u201cfilial and incorruptible\u201d seems, however, to have suffered strongly by the time they compiled their works. The history about Hua Qiao's own times, the Jin shu, contains only twenty-three cases in which somebody was recommended in it and the Song shu about Fan Ye's (Liu) Song dynasty only three.Footnote 66 Shen Yue also observed this change in society. In the appraisal at the end of his own Xiaoyi chapter, he wrote: \u201cI, the chronicler and subject, say: In the time of the Han the noblemen took care of cultivating themselves and therefore loyalty and filial piety became customs. Thereupon they mounted the chariots and wore the caps [of officials]\u2026\u201d \u53f2\u81e3\u66f0\uff1a\u6f22\u4e16\u58eb\u52d9\u6cbb\u8eab\uff0c\u6545\u5fe0\u5b5d\u6210\u4fd7\uff0c\u81f3\u4e4e\u4e58\u8ed2\u670d\u5195,\u2026.Footnote 67 Keith Knapp in his Selfless Offspring writes: \u201cBy the Eastern Jin (317\u2013420), the \u2018filial and incorrupt\u2019 recommendation category became a secondary means for obtaining public office, to the extent that only members of lesser elite families, often called \u2018cold gate [families]\u2019 (hanmen), would deign to enter government by this means.\u201dFootnote 68 Society had changed and for the two later historians studying the materials of the Dongguan Han ji and its various reworkings the recommendation as filial and incorruptible must have seemed to be a typical characteristic of the Later Han state. Therefore they might have seen the need to create a separate chapter in order to demonstrate this to their readers. As Zhong Shulin writes on the collective chapters at the end of the Hou Han shu, \u201cFan Ye specifically added collective chapters\u2026 in accordance with the particularities of the Eastern Han society\u201d \u8303\u6654\u6839\u636e\u4e1c\u6c49\u793e\u4f1a\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u7279\u610f\u589e\u8bbe\u4e86[\u2026] \u7c7b\u4e13.Footnote 69 This is very much true also for filial office holders during the Later Han dynasty. Hua Qiao and Fan Ye selected the biographies that were the most fit to describe the phenomenon\u2014the ones with the most detailed filiality stories\u2014and gathered them. For the historians of the Later Han itself, on the other hand, an official career that had started with a recommendation as filial and incorruptible and led to important offices was nothing special. Therefore they most probably used different criteria to arrange their biographies in the Dongguan Han ji.\n\nEXTENT AND ROLE OF THE CHAPTER'S FILIAL PIETY CONTENT After analyzing the textual history and the historical context it is time to focus on the filial piety content of the biographies in Chapter 39. All the accounts contain at least one longer anecdote in which the men demonstrate exemplary behavior. With very few exceptions these are told right after the introduction and thus explain how the men were recommended and how their official careers started. As Keith Knapp observes, \u201calmost all of these men spent their early lives outside of government and gained office only as a reward for their filial behaviour.\u201dFootnote 70 But the similarities of the tales by no means end here. Their contents are also highly similar. This is true to some extent for all medieval filial piety tales. Knapp writes, that \u201cthe feats attributed to filial offspring are extremely stereotyped and limited in number. In fact, early medieval authors credit many different filial sons and daughters with performing the exact same exemplary act\u2014that is, examples of the same story having different protagonists abound.\u201dFootnote 71 In Chapter 39, within the rough dozen biographies sometimes as many as half contain basically the same anecdote, which makes it possible to identify motives that were connected to filiality. The last section of this paper is an attempt to identify the most common ones and to assess the role they played for the official careers of the men. One of the elements of Chapter 39's filiality is devotion to dead parents\u2014especially mothers. It is attributed to a whole series of men and the motive with which this is most commonly expressed is excessive behavior during the funeral and/or mourning period. Zhou Pan's biography contains the following brief description: Later he missed his mother. He left his office and returned to his village. Thereupon his mother perished. His grief went so far that he almost died himself. After the funeral services were finished, he built a hut next to the grave mound. \u5f8c\u601d\u6bcd\uff0c\u5f03\u5b98\u9084\u9109\u91cc\u3002\u53ca\u6bcd\u6b7f\uff0c\u54c0\u81f3\u5e7e \u65bc\u6bc0\u6ec5\uff0c\u670d\u7d42\uff0c\u9042\u5eec\u4e8e\u51a2\u5074\u3002Footnote 72 Pan thus decided to stay close to his mother's grave. The following is written about Wang Lin and his brothers: At this time, in Runan there was Wang Lin, [style] Juwei. When he was older than ten he mourned his parents. Because great disorder happened, the hundred families fled. Only Lin and his brothers guarded the graves and huts. They screamed and cried without pausing. \u6642\u6c5d\u5357\u6709\u738b\u7433\u5de8\u5c09\u8005\uff0c\u5e74\u5341\u9918\u6b72\u55aa\u7236\u6bcd\u3002\u56e0\u906d\u5927\u4e82\uff0c\u767e\u59d3\u5954\u9003\uff0c\u552f\u7433\u5144\u5f1f\u7368\u5b88\u585a\u5eec\uff0c\u865f\u6ce3\u4e0d\u7d55\u3002Footnote 73 The brothers thus accepted the risk of meeting bandits and stayed at the grave of their parents in order to guard it. A similar, but a bit more fleshed-out anecdote can be found in Jiang Ge's biography: The governor invited him politely, but Ge did not respond because of his mother's age. When his mother died, he followed his nature [up to the point where he] was in danger of dying. He once lay down on the ground in the grave hut and after the services were finished, he could not endure leaving. The governor of the region sent his deputy, in order to release him from the funeral services, and used the opportunity to beg him to become an official. \u592a\u5b88\u5617\u5099\u79ae\u53ec\uff0c\u9769\u4ee5\u6bcd\u8001\u4e0d\u61c9\u3002\u53ca\u6bcd\u7d42\uff0c\u81f3\u6027\u6b86\u6ec5\uff0c\u5617\u5be2\u4f0f\u51a2\u5eec\uff0c\u670d\u7adf\uff0c\u4e0d\u5fcd\u9664\u3002\u90e1\u5b88\u9063\u4e1e\u63be\u91cb\u670d\uff0c\u56e0\u8acb\u4ee5\u70ba\u540f\u3002Footnote 74 In this case, we are explicitly told that the excessive behavior of the biography's subject triggered a reaction of the society and improved Jiang Ge's career perspective. There are also less formalized versions of this motive. Cai Shun's biography describes him as facing lightning out in the open for his diseased mother: The Governor Han Chong recruited him\u2026. His mother had been afraid of thunder all her life. Ever since she had passed away, Shun had, whenever there was the rumble of thunder, immediately circled the grave mound. Crying, he had said: \u201cI am here.\u201d Chong heard of this and whenever there was thunder, he immediately sent a carriage and a horse to the grave. Later the Governor Bao Zhong recommended him as filial and incorruptible. But Shun was unable to leave the grave and as a result did not go. \u592a\u5b88\u97d3\u5d07\u53ec[\u2026]\u3002\u6bcd\u5e73\u751f\u754f\u96f7\uff0c\u81ea\u4ea1\u5f8c\uff0c\u6bcf\u6709\u96f7\u9707\uff0c\u9806\u8f12\u571c\u51a2\u6ce3\uff0c\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u9806\u5728\u6b64\u3002\u300d\u5d07\u805e\u4e4b\uff0c\u6bcf\u96f7\u8f12\u70ba\u5dee\u8eca\u99ac\u5230\u5893\u6240\u3002\u5f8c\u592a\u5b88\u9b91\u773e\u8209\u5b5d\u5ec9\uff0c\u9806\u4e0d\u80fd\u9060\u96e2\u58b3\u5893\uff0c\u9042\u4e0d\u5c31\u3002Footnote 75 Earlier in the biography, Cai Shun is described as protecting the unburied corpse of his mother with his own flesh: His mother was 90 years old and died of old age. He had not yet managed to bury her when a fire broke out in his village. The fire was closing in on his mansion. Shun lay on the casket and embraced it. He screamed, cried and shouted at Heaven. The fire thereupon sprang over them and burned the other mansions. Shun alone managed to evade it. \u6bcd\u5e74\u4e5d\u5341\uff0c\u4ee5\u58fd\u7d42\u3002\u672a\u53ca\u5f97\u846c\uff0c\u91cc\u4e2d\u707d\uff0c\u706b\u5c07\u903c\u5176\u820d\uff0c\u9806\u62b1\u4f0f\u68fa\u67e9\uff0c\u865f\u54ed\u53eb\u5929\uff0c\u706b\u9042\u8d8a \u71d2\u5b83\u5ba4\uff0c\u9806\u7368\u5f97\u514d\u3002Footnote 76 Cai Shun, therefore, is described as facing fire and lightning in order to protect his mother's corpse. Like in Jiang Ge's biography, this behavior is said to have improved his career perspectives and to have led to his recommendation as filial and incorruptible. In all, five anecdotes in Chapter 39 deal with the strong devotion the men showed for their dead parents, even when it meant physical harm for them. As we already saw above, this motive is by no means confined to Chapter 39 and shows up numerous times all through the Hou Han shu.Footnote 77 The second motive we can identify in Chapter 39 is showing the willingness to sacrifice oneself in order to prevent living relatives from being killed. Donald Holzman already stated that the chapter contains many anecdotes that \u201ctell of brothers who sacrifice themselves so their elder or younger brothers will not be killed.\u201dFootnote 78 There is a certain degree of variation: sometimes it is about the mother and not about brothers, and the biography's subject might either want to take care of a relative before being eaten or offer himself to replace one that is about to be eaten by bandits. But all these anecdotes contain the basic narrative of somebody who is willing to die for a cause related to brothers or mothers and who, by this behavior, influences the people around him. Here is the first example from Liu Ping's biography: Ping went out in the morning, searching for food. He met hungry bandits and they were about to cook him. Ping kowtowed before them and said: \u201cThis morning I am searching for vegetables for my old mother. Her life depends on me. I hope you will allow me to first return to her. When I am done feeding my mother, I will return to you and die.\u201d Tears were streaming down his face. When the bandits saw his utmost honesty, they were compassionate and sent him away. Ping returned home and after he was done feeding his mother, he explained to her: \u201cI made an appointment with bandits. Righteousness must not be deceived.\u201d Thereupon he went back to the bandits. They were all greatly surprised and said to each other: \u201cWe always heard about exemplary gentlemen. Today we have seen one. Master, go away! We can't eat you.\u201d As a result he managed to survive. \u5e73\u671d\u51fa\u6c42\u98df\uff0c\u9022\u9913\u8cca\uff0c\u5c07\u4ea8\u4e4b\uff0c\u5e73\u53e9\u982d\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u4eca\u65e6\u70ba\u8001\u6bcd\u6c42\u83dc\uff0c\u8001\u6bcd\u5f85\u66e0\u70ba\u547d\uff0c\u9858\u5f97\u5148\u6b78\uff0c\u98df\u6bcd\u7570\uff0c\u9084\u5c31\u6b7b\u3002\u300d\u56e0\u6d95\u6ce3\u3002\u8cca\u898b\u5176\u81f3\u8aa0\uff0c\u54c0\u800c\u9063\u4e4b\u3002\u5e73\u9084\uff0c\u65e2\u98df\u6bcd\u8a16\uff0c\u56e0\u767d\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u5c6c\u8207\u8cca\u671f\uff0c\u7fa9\u4e0d\u53ef\u6b3a\u3002\u300d\u9042\u9084\u8a63\u8cca\u3002\u773e\u7686\u5927\u9a5a\uff0c\u76f8\u8b02\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u5e38\u805e\u70c8\u58eb\uff0c \u4e43\u4eca\u898b\u4e4b\u3002\u5b50\u53bb\u77e3\uff0c\u543e\u4e0d\u5fcd\u98df\u5b50\u3002\u300d\u65bc\u662f\u5f97\u5168\u3002Footnote 79 Liu Ping's willingness to sacrifice himself impressed the bandits so much that they acknowledged his moral superiority and refused to eat him. This might at first seem to be an unusual event, but the motive also makes an appearance in the biography of Zhao Xiao: Thereupon the realm fell into disorder and people ate each other. [Zhao] Xiao's younger brother Li was captured by hungry bandits. When Xiao heard about this, he tied himself and went to the bandits. He told them: \u201cLi has been starving for a long time and is skinny now. I am fatter.\u201d The bandits were greatly surprised and released them. They told them: \u201cYou can go home. Grab rice and provisions and return to us.\u201d Xiao searched [for food], but he was unable to obtain any. He went back and reported this to the bandits. He wished to be cooked by them [instead]. They thought that he was extraordinary and thus did not harm him. In his home village he was admired for his righteousness. The regions and provinces summoned him and his every step was done in accordance with the rules of propriety. He was recommended as filial and incorruptible, but did not answer [the call]. \u53ca\u5929\u4e0b\u4e82\uff0c\u4eba\u76f8\u98df\u3002\u5b5d\u5f1f\u79ae\u70ba\u9913\u8cca\u6240\u5f97\uff0c\u5b5d\u805e\u4e4b\uff0c\u5373\u81ea\u7e1b\u8a63\u8cca\uff0c\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u79ae\u4e45\u9913\u7fb8\u7626\uff0c\u4e0d\u5982\u5b5d\u80a5\u98fd\u3002\u300d\u8cca\u5927\u9a5a\uff0c\u4e26\u653e\u4e4b\uff0c\u8b02\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u53ef\u4e14\u6b78\uff0c\u66f4\u6301\u7c73\u7cd2\u4f86\u3002\u300d\u5b5d\u6c42\u4e0d\u80fd\u5f97\uff0c\u5fa9\u5f80\u5831\u8cca\uff0c\u9858\u5c31\u4ea8\u3002\u773e\u7570\u4e4b\uff0c\u9042\u4e0d\u5bb3\u3002\u9109\u9ee8\u670d\u5176\u7fa9\u3002\u5dde\u90e1\u8f9f\u53ec\uff0c\u9032\u9000\u5fc5\u4ee5\u79ae\u3002\u8209\u5b5d\u5ec9\uff0c\u4e0d\u61c9\u3002Footnote 80 This time the man wants to sacrifice himself in order to save his younger brother.Footnote 81 In the middle section the reader is given more details, while the end of the anecdote is shorter and the bandits do not explain their decision to let the brothers go. But overall, the motive is strikingly similar. Again we are told that the behavior led to a reputation and later on to a recommendation for an official post. The biography of Jiang Ge then contains yet another version of the motive. This time, it is the mother who is in danger: It happened that the realm fell into disorder and thieves and bandits rose [in rebellion]. Ge carried his mother away to evade the difficulties. He was prepared to go through hardships and dangers and always collected [food] in order to feed her. They encountered bandits many times and on one occasion [they] seized him and were about to leave [with him]. Ge immediately started crying and pled for mercy. He told them that he had an old mother [depending on him] and his way of speaking was honest. It was sufficient to move the others. The bandits thus could not assault him. Some of them pointed out to him the methods of how to evade soldiers and thereupon they managed to evade the difficulties unharmed. \u906d\u5929\u4e0b\u4e82\uff0c\u76dc\u8cca\u4e26\u8d77\uff0c\u9769\u8ca0\u6bcd\u9003\u96e3\uff0c \u5099\u7d93\u963b\u96aa\uff0c\u5e38\u63a1\u62fe\u4ee5\u70ba\u990a\u3002\u6578\u9047\u8cca\uff0c\u6216\u52ab\u6b32\u5c07\u53bb\uff0c\u9769\u8f12\u6d95\u6ce3\u6c42\u54c0\uff0c\u8a00\u6709\u8001\u6bcd\uff0c\u8fad\u6c23\u613f\u6b3e\uff0c\u6709\u8db3\u611f\u52d5\u4eba\u8005\u3002\u8cca\u4ee5\u662f\u4e0d\u5fcd\u72af\u4e4b\uff0c\u6216\u4e43\u6307\u907f\u5175\u4e4b\u65b9\uff0c\u9042\u5f97\u4ff1\u5168\u65bc\u96e3\u3002Footnote 82 Again, the bandits are moved by the subject's upright character and ultimately refrain from causing him harm. The motive is so common in the chapter that the historians could describe it in fewer and fewer words, because the reader is already able to supplement details with the help of his imagination. In the biography of Chunyu Gong, it is reduced to one sentence: At the end [of the time] of Wang Mang there were crop failures and soldiers rose [in rebellion]. Gong's younger brother Chong was about to be cooked by thieves. Gong begged them to replace him and they both managed to get away. \u738b\u83bd\u672b\uff0c\u6b72\u98e2\u5175\u8d77\uff0c\u606d\u5144\u5d07\u5c07\u70ba\u76dc\u6240\u4ea8\uff0c\u606d\u8acb\u4ee3\uff0c\u5f97\u4ff1\u514d\u3002Footnote 83 Three of the subordinated biographies were included into Chapter 39 solely for containing this motive. In Wang Lin's biography, it is the younger brother who is about to be eaten: His younger brother Ji went out and met the Red Eyebrows. They were about to eat him. Lin bound himself and begged them to die before Ji. The bandits took pity on them and thereupon they released them [both] and sent them away. Because of this his name became famous in their village. \u5f1f\u5b63\uff0c\u51fa\u9047\u8d64\u7709\uff0c\u5c07\u70ba\u6240\u54fa\uff0c\u7433\u81ea\u7e1b\uff0c\u8acb\u5148\u5b63\u6b7b\uff0c\u8cca\u77dd\u800c\u653e\u9063\uff0c\u7531\u662f\u986f\u540d\u9109\u9091\u3002Footnote 84 Here, again, the historian remarks that the reward for the courage was a good reputation. About Ermeng Ziming and Checheng Ziwei we read: There were also Ermeng Ziming, [a native of] the kingdom of Qi, and Checheng Ziwei, [a native of] the province of Liang. Their brothers were caught by the Red Eyebrows. They were about to be eaten. Meng and Cheng kowtowed and begged to substitute them. The bandits pitied them and released them both. \u53c8\u9f4a\u570b\u5152\u840c\u5b50\u660e\u3001\u6881\u90e1\u8eca\u6210\u5b50\u5a01\u4e8c\u4eba\uff0c\u5144\u5f1f\u4e26\u898b\u57f7\u65bc\u8d64\u7709\uff0c\u5c07\u98df\u4e4b\uff0c\u840c\u3001\u6210\u53e9\u982d\uff0c\u4e5e\u4ee5\u8eab\u4ee3\uff0c\u8cca\u4ea6\u54c0\u800c\u5169\u91cb\u7109\u3002Footnote 85 In all, the motive of showing the willingness for self-sacrifice shows up six times in Chapter 39. In this case, the majority of these stories are contained in Chapter 39. There are cases outside of the chapter, but they are very few.Footnote 86 The third distinguishable motive in Chapter 39 is the high degree of selflessness and devotion shown by the men in order to comfort their living mothers. Jiang Ge's biography alone tells two stories about his attempts: Whenever it was time for the harvest, the counties registered the population. Ge, because of the old age of his mother, did not want her to be shaken by the movement [of the cart]. He therefore put himself into the yoke of the cart and did not use a cow or a horse. Thereupon his village praised him and called him \u201cJing the vastly filial.\u201d \u6bcf\u81f3\u6b72\u6642\uff0c\u7e23\u7576\u6848\u6bd4\uff0c\u9769\u4ee5\u6bcd\u8001\uff0c\u4e0d\u6b32\u6416\u52d5\uff0c\u81ea\u5728\u8f45\u4e2d\u8f13\u8eca\uff0c\u4e0d\u7528\u725b\u99ac\uff0c\u7531\u662f\u9109\u91cc\u7a31\u4e4b\u66f0\u300c\u6c5f\u5de8\u5b5d\u300d\u3002Footnote 87 We are told that the subject of the biography readily accepted the pain of a strenuous task in order to help a relative. The already well-known threefold partition is again very visible. After the description of the situation, the subject of the biography is described as having certain behavior and this triggers a reaction from society, in this case gaining a reputation in the village. Elsewhere in Ge's biography, we are told that: Ge moved to Xiapi and stayed there as a guest. He was poor, naked and barefoot. He let himself be hired [as a worker] in order to provide for his mother. Of the goods that made her more comfortable there was nothing that he would not give her. \u9769\u8f49\u5ba2\u4e0b\u90b3\uff0c\u7aae\u8ca7\u88f8\u8de3\uff0c\u884c\u50ad\u4ee5\u4f9b\u6bcd\uff0c\u4fbf\u8eab\u4e4b\u7269\uff0c\u83ab\u4e0d\u5fc5\u7d66\u3002Footnote 88 Ge was thus willing to let himself be hired as a laborer, thereby accepting a low social role in order to be able to provide for his mother.Footnote 89 The biography of Zhao Zi contains the following anecdote about him comforting his mother: Once during the night thieves came in order to rob them. Zi was afraid, that his mother would become scared. Thereupon he reached the gate first and welcomed the thieves. They asked him to prepare food for them. He excused himself and said: \u201cMy old mother is eighty years old. She is sick and needs to be nourished. We live in poverty. From morning to evening I have nothing I could save. But please take some clothes and provisions.\u201d [He was willing to give them] his wife, his children, his things and everything else. There was nothing he begged [to keep] for [himself]. The thieves were ashamed and sighed. Kneeling [before him], they excused themselves, saying: \u201cOur violation was insolent. We tyrannized a worthy man.\u201d After they finished speaking, they fled. Zi pursued them in order to give them his things, but couldn't reach them. Because of this he became more famous. He was summoned and made Court Advisor. He excused himself because of illness and did not go. \u76dc\u5617\u591c\u5f80\u52ab\u4e4b\uff0c\u54a8\u6050\u6bcd\u9a5a\u61fc\uff0c\u4e43\u5148\u81f3\u9580\u8fce\u76dc\uff0c\u56e0\u8acb\u70ba\u8a2d\u98df\uff0c\u8b1d\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u8001\u6bcd\u516b\u5341\uff0c\u75be\u75c5\u9808\u990a\uff0c \u5c45\u8ca7\uff0c\u671d\u5915\u7121\u5132\uff0c\u4e5e\u5c11\u7f6e\u8863\u7ce7\u3002\u300d\u59bb\u5b50\u7269\u9918\uff0c\u4e00\u7121\u6240\u8acb\u3002\u76dc\u7686\u6159\u6b4e\uff0c\u8dea\u800c\u8fad\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u6240\u72af\u7121\u72c0\uff0c\u5e72\u66b4 \u8ce2\u8005\u3002\u300d\u8a00\u7562\u5954\u51fa\uff0c\u54a8\u8ffd\u4ee5\u7269\u8207\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ca\u3002\u7531\u6b64\u76ca\u77e5\u540d\u3002\u5fb5\u62dc\u8b70\u90ce\uff0c\u8fad\u75be\u4e0d\u5230\uff0cFootnote 90 Here, the motive of doing everything to comfort one's mother is tightly interwoven with another very common one in the Hou Han shu: that of not being attached to material possessions. Zhao Zi is described as being willing to sacrifice not only all his possessions but even his wife and children in order to reach his goal. Again, this high level of devotion is said to have increased his reputation and his prospects for an official career. Cai Shun's biography contains the most extreme example of how the men paid attention to their mothers: Shun became an orphan when he was still young and he nourished his mother. Once he went out in search of firewood, when a travelling soldier arrived [at his home]. When his mother saw that Shun was not back yet she bit her finger. Shun was thereupon moved in his heart. He dropped the firewood and hurried home. On his knees he asked her for the reason. The mother said: \u201cA guest in an urgent situation arrived, so I bit my finger in order to make you aware of this.\u201d At the age of 90 his mother died of old age. \u9806\u5c11\u5b64\uff0c\u990a\u6bcd\u3002\u5617\u51fa\u6c42\u85aa\uff0c\u6709\u5ba2\u5352\u81f3\uff0c\u6bcd\u671b\u9806\u4e0d\u9084\uff0c\u4e43\u566c\u5176\u6307\uff0c\u9806\u5373\u5fc3\u52d5\uff0c\u5f03\u85aa\u99b3\u6b78\uff0c\u8dea\u554f\u5176\u6545\u3002\u6bcd\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u6709\u6025\u5ba2\u4f86\uff0c\u543e\u566c\u6307\u4ee5\u609f\u6c5d\u8033\u3002\u300d\u6bcd\u5e74\u4e5d\u5341\uff0c\u4ee5\u58fd\u7d42\u3002Footnote 91 Four anecdotes, therefore, deal with the various attempts of the men to comfort their mothers. The actual deeds vary, but the basic idea is the same: all of them reduced their own comfort in order to improve the condition of their mothers. By this, they gained a reputation. It is not just the mothers who are the targets of the filial acts. As with the bandit anecdotes, it can also be a brother or his offspring that receives special attention. Raising or supporting male relatives in need is a fourth discernible motive of Chapter 39. In an anecdote about Liu Ban's ancestor, we read the following: Yu was especially benevolent and sincere. Early on he lost his mother and at this time Ping, his younger brother born by the same mother and the Marquis of Pengcheng, was still very young. Yu therefore personally raised and nourished him. He always went to bed with him and rose with him and ate and drank with him. Until he was full grown he never left his side. Ping then died of illness and Yu cried and spit blood. A few months later he perished, too. \u800c\u7d06\u5c24\u6148\u7be4\u3002\u65e9\u5931\u6bcd\uff0c\u540c\u7522\u5f1f\u539f\u9109\u4faf\u5e73\u5c1a\u5e7c\uff0c\u7d06\u89aa\u81ea\u97a0\u990a\uff0c\u5e38\u8207\u5171\u81e5\u8d77\u98f2\u98df\u3002\u53ca\u6210\u4eba\uff0c\u672a\u5617\u96e2\u5de6\u53f3\u3002\u5e73\u75c5\u5352\uff0c\u7d06\u54ed\u6ce3\u6b50\u8840\uff0c\u6578\u6708\u4ea6\u6b7f\u3002Footnote 92 In Chunyu Gong's biography, it is the son of a brother: Later [his brother] Chong died. Gong nourished the young orphan [he had left behind]. He taught him [classical] learning. When [the orphan] violated the rules, [Gong] immediately turned him around, used a rod and gave himself a beating, in order to move him and make him comprehend. The boy [would then] be ashamed and correct his mistakes. \u5f8c\u5d07\u5352\uff0c\u606d\u990a\u5b64\u5e7c\uff0c\u6559\u8aa8\u5b78\u554f\uff0c\u6709\u4e0d\u5982\u6cd5\uff0c\u8f12\u53cd\u7528\u6756\u81ea\u7ba0\uff0c\u4ee5\u611f\u609f\u4e4b\uff0c\u5152\u6159\u800c\u6539\u904e\u3002Footnote 93 Liu Kai refuses to inherit his father's possessions and positions and wants his younger brother to receive them. Stylistically, this anecdote differs from the other tales, as it includes extensive speech acts of Jia Kui and Emperor He. Because of its length, the version given here is slightly shortened: [Liu] Kai, style Boyu, was in line to succeed to Ban's noble rank. He yielded it to his younger brother Xian and ran away in order avoid [his own] enfeoffment. After a long time, in the Zhanghe reign (87\u201388), the officials handed in a memorial in which they asked to split up Kai's state. [But] Suzong was fond of [Kai's] righteousness and he was very worried of doing him wrong. Kai had still not come forth. After more than ten years had passed, in the tenth year of the Yongyuan reign (99), the officials again submitted a memorial. The Palace Attendant Jia Kui used the opportunity to hand the following letter to the emperor: \u201c\u2026I observed that Kai, son and heir of Liu Ban, the Marquee of Juchao, has always acted filial and companionable. He is humble, modest and pure. He yielded his fief to his younger brother Xian and hid himself far from the path.\u2026 He has the integrity of Boyi and it is adequate to show him sympathy and mercy and to [let him] complete his former merits, in order to increase the beauty of this court's esteemed virtue.\u201d Emperor He accepted this and gave the following order: \u201cKai, the heir and son of Liu Ban, the former Marquis of Juchao, ought to inherit his father's noble rank. But he says that his father entrusted him with his wish of giving the state to the younger brother Xian and has been in hiding for seven years, where he protects his complete sincerity. Now, worshiping the way of the kings brings the admirable qualities of a man to perfection. He thus shall be heard and Xian is to inherit the noble rank.\u2026\u201d Thereupon he summoned Kai and made him a Gentleman. He was slowly promoted to Palace Attendant. \u6137\u5b57\u4f2f\u8c6b\uff0c\u4ee5\u7576\u8972\u822c\u7235\uff0c\u8b93\u8207\u5f1f\u61b2\uff0c\u9041\u9003\u907f\u5c01\u3002\u4e45\u4e4b\uff0c\u7ae0\u548c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u53f8\u594f\u8acb\u7d55\u6137\u570b\uff0c\u8085\u5b97\u7f8e\u5176\u7fa9\uff0c\u7279\u512a\u5047\u4e4b\uff0c\u6137\u7336\u4e0d\u51fa\u3002\u7a4d\u5341\u9918\u6b72\uff0c\u81f3\u6c38\u5143\u5341\u5e74\uff0c\u6709\u53f8\u5fa9\u594f\u4e4b\uff0c\u4f8d\u4e2d\u8cc8\u9035\u56e0\u4e0a\u66f8\u66f0\uff1a[\u2026]\u7aca\u898b\u5c45\u5de2\u4faf\u5289\u822c\u55e3\u5b50\u6137\uff0c\u7d20\u884c\u5b5d\u53cb\uff0c\u8b19\u905c\u7d5c\u6e05\uff0c\u8b93\u5c01\u5f1f\u61b2\uff0c\u6f5b\u8eab\u9060\u8ff9\u3002[\u2026]\u6709\u4f2f\u5937\u4e4b\u7bc0\uff0c\u5b9c\u8499\u77dc\u5ba5\uff0c\u5168\u5176\u5148\u529f\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u8056\u671d\u5c1a\u5fb7\u4e4b\u7f8e\u3002\u300d\u548c\u5e1d\u7d0d\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e0b\u8a54\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u6545\u5c45\u5de2\u4faf\u5289\u822c\u55e3\u5b50\u6137\uff0c\u7576\u8972\u822c\u7235\uff0c\u800c\u7a31\u7236\u907a\u610f\uff0c\u81f4\u570b\u5f1f\u61b2\uff0c\u9041\u4ea1\u4e03\u5e74\uff0c\u6240\u5b88\u5f4c\u7be4\u3002\u84cb\u738b\u6cd5\u5d07\u5584\uff0c\u6210\u4eba\u4e4b\u7f8e\u3002\u5176\u807d\u61b2\u55e3\u7235\u3002[\u2026]\u300d\u4e43\u5fb5\u6137\uff0c\u62dc\u70ba\u90ce\uff0c\u7a0d\u9077\u4f8d\u4e2d\u3002Footnote 94 Liu Kai therefore gave up his position and even went against the law to improve his brother's situation. He had to stand his ground for years before the emperor finally granted his wish. The result, however, justified the means. The emperor is said to have recognized his qualities and his insistence opened up the way to a career that would climax in the position of one of the Nine Ministers.Footnote 95 Liu Kai's biography\u2014despite its considerable length\u2014does not contain another filial piety anecdote, but the value is nevertheless central to it, as he plays a role in a court discussion about the appropriate mourning period. His biography also briefly says: \u201cHe was given 300,000 coins and with his salary of a thousand piculs he went home and nourished [his relatives]\u201d \u52a0\u8cdc\u9322\u4e09\u5341\u842c\uff0c\u4ee5\u5343\u77f3\u797f\u6b78\u990a,\u2026.Footnote 96 The most extreme version of brotherly affection is contained in Liu Ping's biography. He sacrifices his own child for the one of his brother: At the time of the Gengshi emperor the realm fell into disorder. Ping's younger brother Zhong was killed by bandits. Afterwards the bandits suddenly returned and Ping steadied his mother and they escaped the difficulties on foot. Zhong had left behind a newborn girl in her first year of life. Ping bundled up Zhong's daughter and abandoned his [own] son. His mother wanted him to return to get him, but Ping did not listen to her. He said: \u201cMy physical strength leaves me unable to keep them both alive. Zhong's line must not be cut off.\u201d Thereupon they fled and did not look back. Together with the mother they hid in the wilderness and marshes. \u66f4\u59cb\u6642\uff0c\u5929\u4e0b\u4e82\uff0c\u5e73\u5f1f\u4ef2\u70ba\u8cca\u6240\u6bba\u3002\u5176\u5f8c\u8cca\u5fa9\u5ffd\u7136\u800c\u81f3\uff0c\u5e73\u6276\u4f8d\u5176\u6bcd\uff0c\u5954\u8d70\u9003\u96e3\u3002\u4ef2\u907a\u8179\u5973\u59cb\u4e00\u6b72\uff0c\u5e73\u62b1\u4ef2\u5973\u800c\u5f03\u5176\u5b50\u3002\u6bcd\u6b32\u9084\u53d6\u4e4b\uff0c\u5e73\u4e0d\u807d\uff0c\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u529b\u4e0d\u80fd\u5169\u6d3b\uff0c\u4ef2\u4e0d\u53ef\u4ee5\u7d55\u985e\u3002\u300d\u9042\u53bb\u4e0d\u9867\uff0c\u8207\u6bcd\u4ff1\u533f\u91ce\u6fa4\u4e2d\u3002Footnote 97 Liu Ping is described as valuing his brother's daughter more than his own son and as therefore sacrificing him. To conclude, four anecdotes describe the length to which some of the men went in order to nourish their male relatives. Again, the content varies from anecdote to anecdote, but the basic aim of the men is always to improve the situation of male relatives at their own expense. The four categories we saw so far clearly fall under the category \u201cfiliality.\u201d What is surprisingly rare in Chapter 39 are \u201cincorruptibility\u201d stories, i.e. stories in which the men demonstrate that they cannot be moved by wealth and power struggles. We saw that people gave away their possessions for their relatives, but so far we have not encountered a typical incorruptibility story where the addressee of the act is somebody outside of the family. Chunyu Gong's account contains one of them, in which he is described as routinely helping thieves that are stealing from his possessions. He does so in order to prevent them from feeling ashamed: His family owned mountains, fields, and fruit-trees. People sometimes trespassed and stole and he would immediately help them gather and pluck. Furthermore, when he saw that somebody was stealing mowed grain, Gong was worried that they might feel ashamed and because of this he would lie low in the grass. Only when the thief had left did he get up again. His village was reformed by him. \u5bb6\u6709\u5c71\u7530\u679c\u6a39\uff0c\u4eba\u6216\u4fb5\u76dc\uff0c\u8f12\u52a9\u70ba\u6536\u63a1\u3002\u53c8\u898b\u5077\u5208\u79be\u8005\uff0c\u606d\u5ff5\u5176\u6127\uff0c\u56e0\u4f0f\u8349\u4e2d\uff0c\u76dc\u53bb\u4e43\u8d77\uff0c\u91cc\u843d\u5316\u4e4b\u3002Footnote 98 One of the subordinated biographies also consists solely of an anecdote about incorruptibility. Wang Wang is said to have nourished starving commoners, despite the risk of being punished for acting without authority: At this time disasters and droughts hit the regions and provinces. The common people fell into poverty. [Wang] Wang inspected his district and on his way he saw hungry people. They wandered around naked and made grass their food. They were more than 500 people and he had sympathy for them and pitied them. On his own authority, he declared it appropriate to issue cloth and grain from local supplies. He gave them the provisions from the government granary and had coarse clothes made for them. \u662f\u6642\u5dde\u90e1\u707d\u65f1\uff0c\u767e\u59d3\u7aae\u8352\uff0c\u671b\u884c\u90e8\uff0c\u9053\u898b\u98e2\u8005\uff0c\u88f8\u884c\u8349\u98df\uff0c\u4e94\u767e\u9918\u4eba\uff0c\u610d\u7136\u54c0\u4e4b\uff0c\u56e0\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5b9c\u51fa\u6240\u5728\u5e03\u7c9f\uff0c\u7d66\u5176\u7a1f\u7ce7\uff0c\u70ba\u4f5c\u8910\u8863\u3002Footnote 99 In all, only two anecdotes deal with such incorruptible behavior. Compared to the eighteen tales about filial deeds, they are surprisingly rare. This suggests that Fan Ye and Hua Qiao emphasized filiality when they compiled the chapter. There is a sixth category of anecdotes that somewhat breaks the boundaries between filiality and incorruptibility. It is behavior that is very similar to the behavior shown in the filiality anecdotes, but instead of being targeted towards close family members, i.e. mother, father and brothers, it is non-relatives that are being helped by the biography's subject. Keith Knapp refers to them as \u201crighteousness tales.\u201dFootnote 100 Chapter 39 contains three of them and they are all versions of the bandit motive seen above. Liu Ping's biography describes how he would have willingly died for his superior: At the beginning of the Jianwu period Peng Meng, the General-who-Pacifies-the-Di-Barbarians, rebelled in Pengcheng. He attacked Sun Meng, the governor of the region, and defeated him. At that time, Ping had again been made an official of the province. He drew his sword, threw himself on Meng's body and took seven wounds. He was in difficulties and did not know what to do. Crying, he begged them: \u201cI wish to replace the lord of my prefecture [and die in his stead].\u201d The bandits thereupon held back their weapons and paused. They said: \u201cThis is a righteous gentleman. He is not to be killed.\u201d Thereupon, they released them and let them go. \u5efa\u6b66\u521d\uff0c\u5e73\u72c4\u5c07\u8ecd\u9f90\u840c\u53cd\u65bc\u5f6d\u57ce\uff0c\u653b\u6557\u90e1\u5b88\u5b6b\u840c\u3002\u5e73\u6642\u5fa9\u70ba\u90e1\u540f\uff0c\u5192\u767d\u5203\u4f0f\u840c\u8eab\u4e0a\uff0c\u88ab \u4e03\u5275\uff0c\u56f0\u9813\u4e0d\u77e5\u6240\u70ba\uff0c\u865f\u6ce3\u8acb\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u9858\u4ee5\u8eab\u4ee3\u5e9c\u541b\u3002\u300d\u8cca\u4e43\u6582\u5175\u6b62\uff0c\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u6b64\u7fa9\u58eb\u4e5f\uff0c\u52ff\u6bba\u3002\u300d\u9042\u89e3\u53bb\u3002Footnote 101 This is very similar to the bandit anecdotes above, with the difference that this time Liu Ping would sacrifice his life for a non-relative. The bandits explicitly call this behavior \u201crighteous.\u201d Later on, in the same biography, Liu Ping is described as diligently nourishing his wounded superior with his own blood: Meng's wounds were critical and he passed out. After a while, he regained consciousness and asked for something to drink. Ping poured out blood from his wounds and gave it to him to drink. A few days later Meng finally died. Ping thereupon wrapped his wounds and brought back Meng's dead body to his native province. \u840c\u50b7\u751a\u6c23\u7d55\uff0c\u6709\u9803\u8607\uff0c\u6e34\u6c42\u98f2\u3002\u5e73\u50be\u5176\u5275\u8840\u4ee5\u98f2\u4e4b\u3002\u5f8c\u6578\u65e5\u840c\u7adf\u6b7b\uff0c\u5e73\u4e43\u88f9\u5275\uff0c\u6276\u9001\u840c\u55aa\uff0c\u81f3\u5176\u672c\u7e23\u3002Footnote 102 Wei Tan's biography also tells the already well-known self-sacrifice story in connection with non-relatives: In Langye [there was] Wei Tan, [style] Shaoxian. It happened that he was captured by hungry bandits. Together with several tens of others he was tied up and they were to be cooked according to their hierarchy. The bandits saw that Tan seemed to be diligent and generous. They therefore ordered him to be the master [of the cooking activities]. In the evening they immediately tied him up again. Among the bandits there was one Yi Changgong, who took extreme pity on Tan. He secretly untied the ropes and told him: \u201cYour officials will all be eaten. Escape from here immediately.\u201d He replied: \u201cI was made their lord. If I am allowed to remain, then the others will be treated like roots and grass and it will seem better to eat me.\u201d Changgong thought of him as righteous. At dawn he pardoned them and sent them away. Together they managed to get away.

To conclude this section, Chapter 39 contains many anecdotes about filial behavior towards relatives that can be sorted into four broad categories or motives: excessive behavior after the death of a relative, showing the willingness to sacrifice one's own life for a relative, comforting one's mother and raising a male relative. In their core, they are all variations of the same idea: that someone is willing to make significant sacrifices for his family at his own expense. The object of sacrifice might be one's own life, one's energy or one's material sources, and it might be directed toward both the living and the dead. Many of these stories are said to have had a great influence on the reputation and/or career of the men. That these tales, besides their somewhat broad spectrum, for Fan Ye were indeed manifestations of filiality becomes clear from his appraisal (zan) to the chapter. Here, the historian summarizes the biographies in the following way: The appraisal says: Gongzi (Liu Ping) and Changping (Zhao Xiao) encountered robbers, yielded [their lives for relatives] and survived. Chunyu (Chunyu Gong) was humane and brotherly, the Vastly Filial (Jiang Ge) received his name for this [behavior]. Juchao (fief of Liu Pan) studied well and thereupon took up an official salary for his family. Boyu (Liu Kai) hesitated [to accept his father's fief] and followed in the steps of [Boyi and Shuqi from] Guzhu [in order to benefit his younger brother]. Wenchu (Zhao Zi) [wanted a] simple end [so that] his corpse would rot away quickly [and not waste resources]. Zhou (Zhou Pan) was able to miss his mother. He \u201ccherished the gods and nourished\u201d his fortune.Footnote 104 \u8d0a\u66f0\uff1a\u516c\u5b50\u3001\u9577\u5e73\uff0c\u81e8\u5bc7\u8b93\u751f\u3002\u6df3\u4e8e\u4ec1\u608c\uff0c\u300c\u5de8\u5b5d\u300d\u4ee5\u540d\u3002\u5c45\u5de2\u597d\u8b80\uff0c\u9042\u627f\u5bb6\u797f\u3002\u4f2f\u8c6b\u9021\u5de1\uff0c\u65b9\u8ff9\u5b64\u7af9\u3002\u6587\u695a\u8584\u7d42\uff0c\u55aa\u673d\u60df\u901f\u3002\u5468\u80fd\u611f\u89aa\uff0c\u55c7\u795e\u990a\u798f\u3002Footnote 105 Fan Ye praises the seven men for either sacrificing their lives in the face of robbers, being brotherly, nourishing their relatives with an official salary, being frugal for the sake of the family, or considering their parents. The close connection between holding an official post and filiality that was explained in the preface is stressed again. To a much lesser extent, the chapter also contains stories about incorruptibility and anecdotes where similar motives are found in connection with non-relatives. But these categories seem to have played only a minor role for the compilation of the chapter. In the above quoted appraisal Fan Ye attributed one motive to each of the biography holders. But as this section has shown, many biographies contain more than just one of them. Table 4 shows the distribution of the characters for the main biographies and contrasts them with the total length. Table 4 shows that some men are described as being willing to sacrifice in several of the four ways connected to filiality. But the figures also show that their biographies are not dominated by the stories of filial piety. In most cases, significantly more space is used for the description of their official careers.Footnote 107 The anecdotes, therefore, serve as a kind of connector between the biographies of important officials. They describe character traits the men share and that qualified them for their posts, but are not the main information to be conveyed. The subordinated biographies of Chapter 39 show a far more diverse picture, as seen in Table 5. While some of the subordinated accounts do not contain any filial piety tales, others consist purely of them. This can be explained by the different reasons for including the biographies in the chapter. The two accounts of Wang Fu and Wang Wang were included because the men were recommended together with Liu Ping, not because they themselves were exemplars for filiality. Cai Shun, Wei Tan, Ermeng Ziming, and Checheng Ziwei, on the other hand, were included in the chapter only for being exemplars of the four motives; hence, almost their entire short biographies are concerned with their filiality or righteousness."}, {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.570547/full", "page_content": "and Kuang-Hui Yeh1,2\n\nSocial science researchers often define filial piety as a set of norms, values, and practices regarding how children should behave toward their parents. In this article, we trace the conceptual development of filial piety research in Chinese and other societies to highlight the assumptions underlying this traditional approach to filial piety research. We identify the limitations of these assumptions, including the problem of an evolving definition and lack of cross-cultural applicability. We then advocate an alternative framework that overcomes these limitations by focusing on the deep structure of filial piety: the dual filial piety model (DFPM). The DFPM applies the concept of contextualized personality to reconceptualize filial piety in terms of authoritarian and reciprocal psychological motivations particular to the parent-child context. Because the focus is on a universal psychological mechanism rather than cultural norms, values, and behavior, the DFPM may be applied for investigation of filial piety at individual, social, and cultural levels within and across various societies. We discuss application of the DFPM in relation to existing filial piety and intergenerational relations research from several societies and conclude with a comparison to other recent proposals for measuring Chinese filial piety.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe call for contributions for the collection of articles in this special topic defined filial piety as \u201ca set of norms, values and practices regarding how children should behave toward their parents,\u201d and noted that filial piety is important \u201cfor cultures where a family is regarded as an important basic unit of social relationships.\u201d The focal concern is that \u201cpsychologists do not seem to have many conclusions over what defines filial piety, how it is assessed, and its impact on different relationships in the distinctive socio-cultural contexts.\u201d\n\nThe perspective embedded in these statements specifies how filial piety is conceptualized and the cultures in which it is expected to be most relevant. This perspective underlies the majority of filial piety research. We assert that it is this very conceptualization that has led to the current situation in which there seems to be little consensus on the definition, assessment, and impact of filial piety. The lack of agreement on how to best conceptualize and measure filial piety also makes it difficult for scholars to build on each other\u2019s work, which may in turn impede the progress of filial piety research. Scholars must share a common starting point in order to advance knowledge about filial piety.\n\nIn the present article, we review the evolution of the traditional conceptualization, interrogate the assumptions underlying it, and highlight its limitations. Our purpose is to advocate an alternative framework that provides a basis for a definition of filial piety that functions across socio-cultural contexts and is thus appropriate for investigation within and across various societies.\n\nWe ground our discussion in an examination of the early studies of filial piety in Chinese societies as well as research on filial concepts in other societies in order to demonstrate the challenges with the current conceptualization, which primarily focuses on surface behavior and attitudes to norms. Understanding how the early literature conceptualized filial piety is important because the authors of more recent studies draw on it to justify their definition of filial piety and they employ items from the older measures to create new measures (e.g., Lee and Kwok, 2005; Cheng and Chan, 2006; Lum et al., 2016; Fu et al., 2020). We propose a paradigm shift from the current focus on surface-level analysis of behavior and attitudes to a deep structure analysis of the motivations supporting this behavior. We highlight a recent deep structure approach grounded in relationalism in which filial piety is viewed as a contextualized personality construct and expressed in terms of authoritarian and reciprocal motivations: the dual filial piety model (DFPM). This approach allows investigation of a broader range of filial interaction and thus a broader range of filial outcomes because deep motivations can be used to explain surface behavior, but surface behavior does not in itself indicate motivation. We discuss application of the DFPM approach in relation to filial piety research from some non-Confucian societies to demonstrate the cross-cultural applicability of the model, and then conclude with a review of recent proposals for measuring Chinese filial piety (i.e., Lum et al., 2016; Shi and Wang, 2019; Fu et al., 2020).\n\nEarly Psychological Conceptualization and Measurement of Confucian Filial Piety\n\nThe conceptualization of filial piety in the psychology literature as a set of norms, values and practices regarding how children should behave toward their parents began with the earliest psychology studies on this topic several decades ago (e.g., Ho and Lee, 1974). As scholars in Confucian societies noticed the trend toward smaller families, growing presence of women in the workplace, and increasing geographic mobility of workers, they began to debate the impact of societal modernization on intergenerational relationships and individual psychological well-being (Sung, 1995). Some scholars even questioned whether filial piety could survive Chinese communism because the central government had passed legislation to undermine it (Ikels, 2004). Ho and Kang (1984), p. 1004 described the debate as follows:\n\nThere are those who see a basic continuity with the past; that is, despite changes that have taken place, the essential \u201cChinese\u201d character of child-rearing patterns among contemporary Chinese remains highly discernible. \u2026[O]thers point to dramatic social changes that have taken place. They question, therefore, how meaningful it is to continue to speak of the \u201cChinese\u201d pattern.\n\nEarly psychology researchers focused on measuring traditional filial beliefs and attitudes in order to investigate whether they were weakening with the modernization of Chinese societies. For example, Ho and Kang (1984) found that fathers depart more from the traditional orientation to filial piety than grandfathers. They concluded that intergenerational differences in filial piety scores reflect changes in traditional values and that \u201cfilial piety no longer commands the same degree of absolute observance as it once did\u201d (Ho and Kang, 1984, p. 1010). In other words, they equated reduced endorsement of traditional norms with reduced observance of filial piety.\n\nFilial Piety as Traditional Norms\n\nThis conceptualization casts filial piety as a static set of beliefs or attitudes and practices anchored in traditional norms. Accordingly, Ho (1996) described a relationship between filial piety and cognitive conservatism, which Zhang and Bond (1998) claimed explained the significant negative correlation of filial piety with the personality trait of Openness. Zhang and Bond also identified a significant positive correlation with Neuroticism, which they postulated indicated that modern Chinese people exposed to the Western ideologies of freedom and independence would feel \u201cemotional disturbances\u201d if they also endorsed filial piety (p. 415). Other researchers echoed this concern, pointing out that filial piety beliefs may inhibit a person\u2019s independence, or suppress creativity (e.g., Liu and Lin, 1988), and that people endorsing filial piety tended to have lower verbal fluency, and to be passive, uncritical, uncreative, fatalistic, superstitious, authoritarian, dogmatic, and conformist (Ho, 1994).\n\nEvidence suggested that these personality characteristics carried over into parenting attitudes. For example, Ho (1996) found that filial piety beliefs corresponded to parenting attitudes with an emphasis on obedience, indebtedness, impulse control, and moral correctness, but not those characterized by self-fulfillment, self-expression, and psychological sensitivity. Parental filial piety beliefs also corresponded to higher rigidity and lower cognitive complexity in their children. Ho concluded that endorsement of filial piety beliefs \u201cappears to be predominantly and consistently negative from a contemporary psychological perspective on human development\u201d (1994, p. 362).\n\nThese types of studies focused on hierarchical authority ranking in the family, cognitive conservatism, and the tendency to judge people against moral standards. Ho and his colleagues viewed filial piety as a product of normative socialization. Scholars with this point of view concluded that filial piety is diminishing with modernization because \u201cthe social foundations for filial piety have been greatly undermined in Chinese society\u201d (Ng, 1998, p. 101).\n\nExpanding the Conceptualization of Traditional Norms\n\nRather than viewing filial piety as a static set of norms that people may be moving away from, other scholars began with a different premise, which resulted in the opposite conclusion: filial piety is not diminishing in modern society. For example, Yang (1988) defined filial piety in terms of an attitude: paramount concern for the well-being of one\u2019s parents. Starting from this perspective, Cheung et al. (1994) explored the relation between filial piety and family cohesion. They pointed out that the Confucian Book of Rites state that if caring for one\u2019s parents is experienced as a burden, then the act does not qualify as filial piety. In other words, if children care for their elderly parents because they perceive it to be a requirement of an imposed norm, their actions do not count as filial piety. Cheung et al. concluded that filial piety is thus based on the development of empathy (i.e., an affective concept), not normative socialization or rational choice. They also suggested that normative characteristics of filial piety may be diminishing due to modernization, which may be causing affective aspects of filial piety to play a larger role in family cohesion.\n\nSung\u2019s (1990; 1995) approach to conceptualizing filial piety entailed investigating how modern people perceive and enact it. He identified the ideals highlighted in contemporary experiences by analyzing interviews with people who had received national awards for demonstration of filial piety. His analysis identified two orthogonal factors. The first related to filial behavior and included sacrifice, responsibility, and repayment. The second related to filial emotion and encompassed love, family harmony, and respect. Sung (1995) found that the values supported by filial piety facilitate intergenerational relationships by supporting warmth, love, harmony, and close family ties. Participants most valued love and affection. In Sung\u2019s view, the values underlying filial piety had not changed, just the behavior used to enact it. Yue and Ng (1999) obtained a similar result with the finding that old and young people alike held strong beliefs about filial piety, with obedience rated as the least filial concern, and respect as the highest. They concluded that there \u201cappears to be a new cultural protocol for fulfilling filial obligations\u201d (p. 215).\n\nYeh (1999) applied a historical approach. He examined how filial piety had evolved over time and identified stages of conceptual development linked to sociopolitical conditions that matched the authoritarian and affective elements Sung (1990) had identified. In the Pre-Chin era (551 to 221 BC), the fundamental concepts underlying filial piety were affection and the reciprocal nature of virtue. In other words, obligations were understood to be reciprocal (generosity should be returned in kind), and not based on hierarchy. Subsequently, from the Han to the Qing Dynasty (206 BC to 1911), the idea that inferiors must submit to superiors became more prominent, filial requirements became stricter, and violation required severe punishment.\n\nYeh (2003) argued that restricting conceptualization of filial piety to \u201cthe choice of giving it up or keeping it\u201d cannot address the complexity of the concept (p. 79). He proposed that with modern social, political, and economic development, \u201ca new type of filial piety that is adapted to societal changes\u201d may be emerging in which \u201csome attributes of filial piety are gradually eroding at a conceptual level, although other attributes are still crucial to people\u2019s everyday lives\u201d (p. 71). For example, in Taiwan, the importance of the passive obedience and submissive aspects of filial piety were decreasing, but the active affective aspect of filial piety encompassing care for parents was strengthening (Yeh, 1997).\n\nA content analysis of items based on 15 historical dimensions of filial piety (Yang et al., 1989) revealed four filial piety factors (Respect and Love parents, Support and Memorialize Parents, Oppress Oneself, and Glorify Parents). From these, Yeh (1997) identified two higher order factors that corresponded to the two stages of historical development of filial piety: reciprocity and authoritarianism. Yeh (2003) proposed the DFPM, and Yeh and Bedford (2003) validated it with the dual filial piety scale (DFPS), which they applied to investigate the correlations of the reciprocal and authoritarian factors with personality traits, attitudes, behaviors, cognitions, and affect.\n\nYeh and Bedford (2003) found that authoritarian filial piety (AFP) had a significant positive correlation with Neuroticism, and significant negative correlation with Openness, just as Zhang and Bond (1998) had previously found using Ho\u2019s (1994) filial piety scale. However, Yeh and Bedford also found that reciprocal filial piety (RFP) had the opposite relation with these two personality traits. RFP had a positive correlation with Openness and a negative correlation with Neuroticism. These results suggest that definition of filial piety solely in terms of authoritarian norms/practices/values misses the full picture. Instead, the two dynamic aspects of filial piety must be considered together to obtain a complete understanding of the role of filial piety in modern Chinese societies.\n\nIn sum, early studies of filial piety conducted in Confucian societies that focused on authoritarian/hierarchical aspects described filial piety as unidimensional and focused on sacrifice and obedience. Those scholars who took other approaches (philosophical, phenomenological, or historical) found filial piety to be multidimensional with the addition of an affective/relational dimension. Interestingly, the study of filial piety in non-Confucian societies has followed a similar trajectory in which the initial focus on authoritarian aspects of filial piety expanded to include consideration of affection. We review two examples in the following section.\n\nExamples of the Conceptualization and Measurement of Filial Piety in Non-Confucian Societies\n\nMany scholars have pointed out that parents in most societies expect a degree of filial piety from their adult children and that most adult children recognize care for their parents as a duty (Peek et al., 1998; van der Pas et al., 2005). In fact, filial piety first became a scholarly concept in the analysis of Western societies and Sinologists borrowed the term to apply to similar aspects of Chinese society (Hamilton, 1990). Examining the origins of the term filial piety provides insight into how Westerners tend to conceptualize the term.\n\nFilial and piety derive from Latin; filius refers to being a son in relation to a parent, and pietas means dutiful (Hamilton, 1990). Hamilton noted that Roman Law emphasized the power of the father, \u201cwhich implies duty and obedience on the part of the son\u201d (p. 84). This point is an important difference from the Chinese conceptualization of filial piety, which emphasizes the duty and obedience of the son, and only implies the power of the father. In the original conceptualization under Roman Law, the father\u2019s power required filial piety as a duty on the part of the son with an inherent obligation to sacrifice, support, or obey. From this perspective, affection is not considered part of filial piety. Scholars have noted the influence of Western perspectives, theories and models in the research of Chinese academics when they return home from study abroad (Yang, 1997). It may be that the earliest psychological researchers in Chinese societies (who assumed a unidimensional authoritarian perspective on filial piety) were influenced by this Western definition of the term.\n\nIn the following, we review two broad frameworks that have been applied to investigate the role of filial piety in relation to elder care in various societies: the intergenerational solidarity framework and familism. As with early Chinese filial piety studies, research in both these areas tends to define filial piety in terms of social norms.\n\nIntergenerational Solidarity: Filial Expectations and Obligations\n\nA prominent model that has been applied to study the role of filial norms in adult children\u2019s support of aging parents emphasizes duty and obligation and excludes affection. The intergenerational solidarity framework (Bengtson and Roberts, 1991) defines filial obligation as part of normative solidarity: \u201cthe strength of commitment to performance of familial roles and to meeting familial obligations (familism)\u201d (p. 857). In this model, helping/support behavior, reciprocity, association, and affection are seen as independent dimensions from filial obligation. Studies applying this model generally measure filial norms with four items in which participants rate the strength of filial obligations pertaining to the requirement for children to maintain geographical proximity/live with their parents and their willingness to make sacrifices in order to support their parents (e.g., Lee et al., 1994; Lowenstein and Daatland, 2006). These elements reflect aspects of AFP as conceptualized by Ho (1994, 1996) in his conceptualization of Chinese filial piety.\n\nEarly studies applying this model defined filial norms in terms of aging parents\u2019 filial expectations, perhaps because of the inherent emphasis on parental power embedded in the concept. These studies did not find a clear relation between filial expectations and the amount of support that adult children provided (e.g., Lee et al., 1994; Eggebeen and Davey, 1998), including long term studies (e.g., Peek et al., 1998) and more recent studies with participants from other societies (India-Diwan et al., 2011; e.g., Dominican Republic/Puerto Rico, Boucher, 2017).\n\nLater studies measured adult children\u2019s sense of filial obligation to their aged parents (e.g., Lowenstein and Daatland, 2006; Silverstein et al., 2006; Dykstra and Fokkema, 2012) and did find evidence of a predictive relationship between the adult children\u2019s feeling of obligation and the amount of support provided. For example, Lowenstein and Daatland (2006) found that the effect of filial norms on the level of support provided by adult children was significant across five European countries. A similar result with the intergenerational solidarity model has been found in Asian societies. Lin and Yi (2013) operationalized filial norms narrowly as the adult children\u2019s perceived obligation to provide financial support to parents and found that the more adult children in China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan endorsed filial norms, the more likely they were to provide support to elderly parents, irrespective of other relevant factors.\n\nSimilarly, studies of South African Muslims (Ramaboa and Fredericks, 2019) and Muslim immigrants to France from North Africa (Duguet et al., 2016) examined the filial obligation of adult children to provide support for their aging parents. Both studies cast filial piety as an integral aspect of Islam and found that greater endorsement of this filial obligation corresponded to the increased behavior of caring for an aging parent in the home. Both studies evoked modernization theory and expressed the expectation that this filial value (and therefore the behavior) would decrease with modernization and/or exposure to Western cultures.\n\nIn fact, studies applying the normative solidarity framework have demonstrated that religiosity has a positive significant correlation with endorsement of filial norms and parental support in numerous societies (Norway, England, Spain, Germany, Israel; Gans et al., 2009; Italy, Tosi and Oncini, 2020). These studies measured filial obligation in terms of endorsement of obedience norms (an aspect of AFP) and noted that traditionalism may underlie the connection between filial norms and religiosity. This perspective mirrors that of the early Chinese research on filial piety (e.g., Ho and Kang, 1984; Ho, 1996), which cast filial piety as a static set of beliefs or attitudes and practices anchored in traditional norms.\n\nIntergenerational Solidarity and Affection\n\nResearchers have considered affection in relation to filial piety from a variety of perspectives. Some have argued that support of aging parents is motivated by affection instead of filial duty (Swartz, 2009). Others asserted that affection is a motivator of filial obligation, which motivates support (Finley et al., 1988), although it is not sufficient in and of itself (Jarrett, 1985). Bengtson and Roberts (1991) recognized that family relationships encompass normative expectations for emotions as well as support. They found that normative solidarity (their umbrella concept for filial obligation) strongly predicts affection in their intergenerational solidarity model.\n\nSilverstein and Bengtson (1997) refined the intergenerational solidarity model with two general domains of intergenerational cohesion: latent and manifest solidarity. Latent solidarity encompasses feelings of obligation and emotional closeness, and manifest solidarity represents functional exchanges of emotional, instrumental, and material support. The latent factors enable the functional support to emerge.\n\nLatent solidarity encompasses the two intertwined aspects of filial piety identified in Chinese research with the DFPM (i.e., Yeh and Bedford, 2003, 2004): the external social obligations that exert pressure to conform in order to fit in with the wider social expectation (AFP), and the nature of the relationship with the parents (RFP). However, researchers applying the intergenerational model have tended only to investigate the relation between the former (obligation) and the instrumental and material forms of manifest support (e.g., Lee et al., 1994; Peek et al., 1998), and only a few researchers have included affective/emotional aspects of manifest support. For example, van der Pas et al. (2005) applied two different methodologies to verify the importance of different types of manifest support in their study of elderly Dutch citizens (emotional, instrumental, material, and informational). Hamon and Blieszner (1990) focused on filial role enactment (manifest support) and unexpectedly found emotional aspects of the relationship to be important. They concluded that the nature of filial responsibility has changed. They found that older parents have higher emotional-oriented filial expectations than instrumental filial expectations, and that adult children tend to interpret the filial role as one that includes a high level of emotional support. They indicated that instrumental assistance was less important than in the past, and that affection and emotional support and advice were more important. These findings are similar to the second wave of Chinese filial piety research that encompassed both affect and obligation and concluded that filial beliefs may be changing with greater emphasis on the quality of the parent-child relationship (e.g., Cheung et al., 1994; Yue and Ng, 1999).\n\nFamilism\n\nFamilism is prioritizing one\u2019s family over oneself (Schwartz, 2007). It is defined as \u201ca cultural value that involves\u2026strong feelings of loyalty, reciprocity, and solidarity among members of the same family (p. 314).\u201d Familism is generally associated with Hispanic culture, although it has been demonstrated to operate similarly in diverse ethnic groups in the United States (Schwartz, 2007). Scholars investigating Hispanic familism have noted a conceptual overlap with Chinese filial piety and hypothesized that they comprise a multicultural or transcultural dimension. Using large multi-ethnic samples, Unger et al. (2002) found that these two concepts are highly intercorrelated, and Schwartz et al. (2010) found that familism and filial piety combined to form a single factor of Family Primacy in a study including Asian, Middle Eastern, Hispanic, Caribbean, and Central and South American participants. Similarly, Lin (2018) found a correspondence between familism and filial piety in a sample of Hispanic, Asian, and Pacific-Islander students using measures focused on authoritarian aspects of obedience and submission to the family\u2019s needs.\n\nSchwartz et al. (2010) found that Family Primacy is \u201csimilar to vertical collectivism in that parents must be obeyed without question, and in that individuals must prioritize family members\u2019 wishes and needs over their own\u201d (p. 554). They also pointed out that endorsing this factor does not in any way counter American values or a sense of American identity; it is fully compatible with it. In other words, filial piety and familism are concepts that are relevant to all ethnicities, not just the originating ones. It is worth noting that Unger et al. (2002) defined and measured filial piety relying solely on the work of Ho (1994), who investigated only hierarchical authoritarian Chinese filial characteristics, and whose measure contained no items pertaining to affection. Schwartz et al. (2010) used Unger et al.\u2019s measure of filial piety for their study. Thus, the overlap of familism and Chinese filial piety identified in these studies consists solely of AFP aspects.\n\nKao and Travis\u2019 (2005) not only recognized an overlap between Chinese filial piety and Hispanic familism, they equated it with the Spanish concept of familismo, which they defined as the attachment and loyalty of individuals to their families consisting of: obedience to authority figures, helpfulness among family members, responsibility and sacrifice for family, and obligation to provide material and emotional support. They translated a filial piety measure developed in Chinese in Taiwan to develop the Expectations of Filial Piety Scale (EFPS), which was the first filial piety measure for Hispanic populations. Kao and Travis did not specify the authors of this Chinese measure, but we suspect it was based on the work of Yang et al. (1989). Similar to Yang et al. (1989), they identified four factors, which they labeled: Respect for Parents, Honoring Parents, Supporting Parents, and Family Unity. The first three factors are the same as the Chinese version and they relabeled the fourth factor Family Unity instead of Oppress Oneself. It is informative to compare the results of Kao and Travis\u2019 (2005) factor analysis of Chinese filial piety items with a factor analysis of items used to develop a Hispanic familism scale (Steidel and Contreras, 2003). That analysis also identified four factors: Familial Honor, Familial Interconnectedness, Familial Support, and Subjugation of Self for Family. It is clear both familism and filial piety encompass elements of unity/loyalty, honor, respect, obedience, and the inherent expectation of support, especially in times of need. Additional evidence for including an affective aspect in the conceptualization of familism is provided by a qualitative study of Hispanic elders that concluded that affectual solidarity is a cornerstone of familismo, and that affection explains why elders reported high family support despite infrequent contact with family members (Ruiz, 2007).\n\nSimilar results have been obtained in Arab-Israeli culture. To develop the first filial piety scale in Arabic, Khalaila (2010) used some items from Kao and Travis\u2019 (2005) Hispanic filial piety measure (consisting entirely of items translated directly from a Chinese filial piety measure), and developed some new items reflecting the motives and content of the local context. Khalaila applied modernization theory with the perspective that filial piety represents traditional norms, so she added new items that would negatively correlate with modernization and positively with religiosity. She identified seven dimensions: Sacrifice of Money and Time, Obligation and Affection, Respect for Parents, Culture and Family Face-saving, Desire to Repay, Intergenerational Exchange, and Family Unity and Harmony. She reported a relatively high level of filial piety among adult children in Arab-Israeli society.\n\nProblems With Conceptualizing Filial Piety in Terms of Behavior and Attitudes to Norms\n\nThe majority of studies reviewed in the preceding sections examined filial piety in terms of attitudes toward norms or normative behavior. Many conceptualized filial norms in terms of traditional values (e.g., Kao and Travis\u2019, 2005; Khalaila, 2010). There are two main (interrelated) problems with defining filial piety in this way: identifying the norm/beliefs/attitudes for inclusion and recognizing when they change, and the cross-cultural applicability (including the implicit metaphysical stance) of this research approach. We discuss each in the following.\n\nIdentification of Content and Evolution of the Concept\n\nThe first challenge is to identify which norms to select for conceptualization of filial piety. The norms selected for focus dictate the findings, and even result in opposing conclusions. For example, Ho and Lee (1974) conceptualized filial piety in terms of the structural norms of Confucian ethics relating to hierarchy. The 22-item scale they developed (Ho and Lee, 1974; Ho and Kang, 1984) contains 21 items with content related to submission, sacrifice, and obedience. One item mentions respect for parents. No items mention affection or caring. They concluded that filial piety was waning with modernization, a point of view that can still be found in more recent studies adopting this type of definition (e.g., Cheung and Kwan, 2009; Khalaila and Litwin, 2012). In contrast, Yeh and Bedford (2003, 2004) conceptualized filial piety in terms of both authoritarian and reciprocal norms. Their measure reflected two aspects of filial piety, with eight items targeting authoritarian elements, and eight items targeting reciprocal elements of parent-child interaction. They concluded that although some authoritarian aspects of filial piety are of less relevance, RFP remains a strong consideration in modern Confucian societies. Other scholars who focused on or included affective norms reached a similar conclusion (e.g., Cheung et al., 1994; Sung, 1995). Similarly, Unger et al. (2002) and Schwartz et al. (2010) identified familism with authoritarian aspects of filial piety, but Kao and Travis\u2019 (2005) expanded their conception of familism to encompass both authoritarian and relational aspects. The measures applied in their respective studies reflect this difference in conceptualization.\n\nEven if a consensus can be achieved with regard to the content of filial norms, using them to define filial piety implies either that it is necessary to measure an ever-widening gap with a static set of beliefs (and the impact of that gap on intergenerational relationships and personal growth), or that the definition of filial piety would need to continue to evolve with social change. A study in the United States analyzed the filial attitudes and beliefs of three generations of women and found that although all three generations had a strong sense of filial responsibility, the content differed between generations (Brody et al., 1983). Filial norms not only differ by generation, they may change for a given individual with personal circumstances, or even aging (Gans and Silverstein, 2006). Indeed, some researchers have already observed that it may be necessary to update the concept of filial piety for modern societies. Lum et al. (2016) developed a new conception and measurement for filial piety \u201cin the 21st century\u201d (p. 1235). Choi (2004) presented an argument for a \u201cnew concept of filial piety in modern Korean society\u201d (p. 72). Fu et al. (2020) asserted that not only is it necessary to create a new measure because of new filial piety norms, it is also necessary to develop different measures for children, adult children, elderly parents, and the general public. This approach may create more questions than it resolves. For example: How does one know when to update the definition? How does one compare change over time if the definition also changes? Do different societies need different definitions?\n\nApplication in Multiple Cultures\n\nThis last question raises another issue. If filial piety is defined in terms of cultural norms, the appropriateness of applying the concept to other cultures becomes an obvious question. It also raises a consideration about the very conceptualization of filial piety. In adopting a psychological approach to filial piety, early researchers relied on dispositional methods (Hwang, 2012). They defined filial piety in terms of Chinese norms and measured the strength of an individual\u2019s attitudes to these norms in order to relate them to other psychological traits or behaviors. That is, they relied on the approach of mainstream psychology. Bedford and Yeh (2020) pointed out that the limitations of mainstream psychology are similar to the limitations identified in other natural science disciplines and highlighted the field of physics as an example. The subatomic realm could not be understood with the traditional scientific approach; a paradigm shift was needed to address wave-particle duality. The key to the paradigm shift was the recognition that interactions between a target and the environment can change the nature of the target. The paradigm shift allowed physicists to focus on the interactions between a target and its environment, rather than being restricted to a sole focus on a target and its properties or fundamental nature. From this perspective, it is not possible to understand a target without understanding its interaction with the environment. The implication for research in the field of psychology is that a person cannot be understood as an isolated autonomous being transacting with others. Instead, people must be understood as constituted by their relationships with others. For the study of filial piety, the significance is that an approach that puts the parent-child relationship at the center of investigation may yield different insights from approaches that focus on the attitudes and norms of individuals.\n\nMethodological Relationalism as an Alternative Paradigm\n\nThe paradigm shift in the natural sciences aligns with a body of research labeled Chinese relationalism that emerged with the Chinese indigenous psychology movement (Hwang, 2013). Methodological relationalism (Ho, 1991) is an alternative approach to methodological individualism for conducting research in psychology. From this perspective, because the relational context supplies important determinants of social behavior, examining individual variables alone is insufficient to predict individual behavior. Thus, the target of research investigation should not be the individual, but the individual-in-relations. Chinese metaphysical and philosophical traditions are aligned with this perspective (Bedford and Yeh, 2020). Chinese filial piety is not simply children\u2019s respect and obedience or even care and love for their parents. Filial piety is grounded in the unity of heaven and humanity, so the practice of filial piety is not an individual act, but rather a communal act that joins the individual with his or her community via a shared worldview (Tu, 1985).\n\nYang et al. (1990) described the difference in the methodological individualism and methodological relationalism approaches with respect to the investigation of filial piety as follows: The mainstream psychological approach focuses on (1) the phenotypic expression or epiphenomenal manifestation of filial piety; (2) the content of social attitudes and behavior; (3) static dimensions; and (4) the relation among cognitive, affective, intentional, and action levels. In contrast, a relational approach focuses on (1) the genotypic foundation and phenomenological meaning of filial piety; (2) deep structure (the relations among elements rather than the element itself); (3) dynamics and diachronic dimensions; and (4) the process of transformation. In other words, the mainstream approach sees filial piety as equivalent to the individual\u2019s behavior instead of as a social action. The mainstream approach horizontally targets phenotypic manifestations and does not dig down vertically to the foundation of filial piety at a genotypic level. Whereas the mainstream approach is only able to address the superficial filial behavior, a relational approach can investigate the deep structure of filial action. It is the difference between viewing filial piety as a skin or as a skeleton.\n\nWhat we emphasize in this paper is that filial piety is better understood as a skeleton than as a skin. Instead of focusing on the attitudes and beliefs of individuals (skin or surface content), the focus can be shifted to identifying the underlying psychological principles or mechanisms (skeleton or deep structure) that connect individuals with their environment in the context of the parent-child relationship.\n\nFilial Piety as a Contextualized Personality Construct\n\nYeh (2009) recognized these limitations of defining filial piety in terms of cultural norms so he re-conceptualized the DFPM by shifting the focus of investigation from cultural norms to the inherent structure of the parent-child relationship, which encompasses both horizontal and vertical aspects. Each aspect reflects an underlying psychological motivation that guides children\u2019s interactions with their parents (see Table 1). The horizontal aspect is reflected by RFP. It is motivated by genuine affection developed through intimate parent-child interaction and grounded in the equal relationship of two individuals. It meets the individual\u2019s need for mutual relatedness. The vertical aspect is reflected in AFP. It is motivated by the child\u2019s normative desire to satisfy parental demands and grounded in the asymmetry of the parent-child relationship. It meets the individual\u2019s need for collective identification. Together, AFP and RFP provide a structure that connects these two underlying universal psychological needs at the individual level to the surface content of filial norms at the collective level. In this new conceptualization, the DFPM focuses on the dual mechanisms underlying parent-child relations which are expected to be universal, and not on filial norms, thus the model has the potential for application in any cultural context.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nTable 1. The dual filial piety model: Psychological schemas for interaction with parents.\n\nTo extend this point, Bedford and Yeh (2019) applied the concept of contextualized personality. Whereas in the classical psychometric theory or trait approach, personality is typically conceived of in terms of an individual\u2019s stable traits, with a contextualized approach, personality is understood to arise from the individual\u2019s interaction with the environment. Contextualized personality is defined as the \u201cstable patterns of thought, feelings, and behaviors that occur repeatedly within a given context\u201d (Heller et al., 2007, p. 1229).\n\nThe contextualized approach differs in two important ways from the trait approach to personality. First, instead of conceptualizing personality traits as \u201ccausal forces used to predict outcomes that are not themselves subject to change\u201d (Roberts, 2006), personality traits are understood to have the potential to manifest in different ways across \u201cenvironmental contingencies often contained within social roles\u201d (Roberts and Caspi, 2003). Second, personality is not defined solely in terms of traits; some aspects of personality are not represented by traits at all (Dunlop, 2015). In addition to traits, personality can also be expressed in terms of motivations/needs.\n\nA personality motivation is a person-in-context variable\u2014it cannot be separated from the context in which it is practiced. Social roles provide the context for defining personality motivations. In fact, personality motivations are distinguished from traits by their contextualized nature (McAdams, 2013). The social roles of the parent-child relationship provide the context for defining personality motivations related to filial piety.\n\nResearch suggests that social roles can be organized around two fundamental dimensions: belongingness/affiliation and status/power (Roberts, 2006). These dimensions allow people to satisfy the fundamental human needs of interpersonal relatedness (through intimate connections with others) and social belonging (by satisfying the normative expectations of the group/society). According to the reconceptualized DFPM, the parent-child social roles contextualize these two basic needs through RFP (interpersonal relatedness) and AFP (social belonging). In other words, the parent-child relationship provides the context for psychological conceptualization of filial relations, instead of using culturally-shaped behavioral norms as a basis for understanding filial relations (Bedford and Yeh, 2019). Because this approach focuses first on the context, the parent-child relationship (a universal context), and not on cultural content, it is appropriate for application in any culture.\n\nBedford and Yeh (2019) proposed that as a contextualized personality construct, the DFPM can facilitate four levels of analysis of filial relations: individual filial motivations (AFP and RFP); structural aspects of the parent-child relationship (vertical and horizontal); social changes related to filial norms; and differences across societies or cultures in individual motivations, relational structure, and filial behaviors (see Table 2). In the following, we provide examples of the application of the model by focusing on the individual level (although the levels are interrelated, so we touch on the others). Most studies applying the model have been conducted in Chinese societies. The model is intended to have universal application, so we also provide examples of how the DFPM may inform or integrate with filial research in other societies.\n\nTABLE 2\n\nTable 2. Theoretical implications of the DFPM at different levels of analysis.\n\nApplication of the DFPM and Integration With Research in Other Societies\n\nAs a contextualized personality construct, filial piety develops from childhood. Both authoritarian and reciprocal motivations are rooted in the intimacy and the quality of the parent-child relationship and have enduring influence on psychosocial adjustment as well as the parent-child relationship. In this section, we review research applying the DFPM to investigate psychosocial adjustment at the individual level of analysis, and to examine the parent-child relationship at the individual and structural levels of analysis.\n\nPsychosocial Adjustment: Individual Level of Analysis\n\nA number of studies have applied a measure based on the DFPM, the dual filial piety scale (DFPS; Yeh and Bedford, 2003) to examine the authoritarian and reciprocal filial motivations in relation to various aspects of the psychosocial adjustment of adolescents. For example, RFP is positively correlated with life satisfaction (Wong et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2019) as well as good interpersonal skills (e.g., self-disclosure and empathy), reduced parent-child conflict (Yeh and Bedford, 2004), and better overall psychosocial adjustment (Yeh and Yang, 2006). RFP mediates the influence of supportive parenting on young adults\u2019 happiness (Chen et al., 2016). RFP also corresponds to reduced depression and anxiety (internalizing) behavior and reduced deviant and aggressive (externalizing) behavior (Yeh, 2006) in Taiwanese adolescents. AFP reflects internalized role obligations to be comply with social norms. Research on junior high students and their parents in Taiwan showed that AFP beliefs are positively associated with traditional and conservative attitudes (e.g., male superiority and submission to authority; Yeh and Bedford, 2003) and maladaptation (e.g., neurotic personality traits, depression, and anxiety; Yeh, 2006). Because AFP often involves self-suppression, it is more likely to correlate with personal stress than RFP (Yang and Yeh, 2006), and it has a negative relation to self-esteem (Wong et al., 2010). A recent study demonstrated that although AFP has a negative indirect effect on life satisfaction through the mediating role of individuating autonomy, it has a positive indirect effect through relating autonomy (Sun et al., 2019).\n\nAn additional benefit of the DFPM is that rather than simply designating people as filial or un-filial, the model allows for a more nuanced examination of the psychological mechanisms underlying the affective reactions and social behavior associated with filial piety by identifying four possible modes of personal interaction with parents: high reciprocal-low authoritarian, high authoritarian-low reciprocal, high on both (balanced), and low on both (non-filial) (Yeh and Bedford, 2004).\n\nThese filial types can be applied to the investigation of topics that have been little considered in relation to filial piety such as attachment style (Ainsworth and Bell, 1970). The DFPM model may provide a strong tool for research in this domain since it encompasses and extends several aspects of attachment theory (Bedford and Yeh, 2019): The balanced type corresponds to secure attachment, the non-filial type corresponds to avoidant attachment, and the reciprocal and authoritarian types correspond to ambivalent attachment.\n\nRather than focusing solely on early childhood as the critical period of development as in attachment theory, the DFPM encompasses the entire lifespan and recognizes the relevance of the parent-child relationship as a person transitions to adulthood and beyond. It can apply to research investigating adult relations with parents. For example, the concept of intergenerational ambivalence, a mix of positive and negative feelings toward parents (Luescher and Pillemer, 1998), may be interpreted as an imbalance between RFP and AFP. Adolescent adaptation, social development, and delinquency are predicted by parental authority (Darling et al., 2008), which is similar to AFP in its focus on the vertical aspect of the parent-child relationship.\n\nApplication of the DFPM may also provide insight on the relationship between Hispanic familism and adolescent adjustment. Strong familism can shield against damage from the negative aspects of risk (Deane et al., 2020). Aspects of familism related to interconnection and pride serve as a protective factor for positive psychosocial outcomes (Stein et al., 2019). Familism may also moderate the relation between stress and internalizing and externalizing behavior under some conditions (Uma\u00f1a-Taylor et al., 2011), although it has also been shown to relate to higher levels of internalizing behaviors (Kuhlberg et al., 2010), and to increase risk of distress among adolescents under some conditions (Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2010). From the perspective of the DFPM, the explanation for these inconsistent results may lie in conceptualization of the measure and whether it emphasizes AFP or RFP aspects of familism.\n\nThe Parent-Child Relationship: Individual and Social Structural Levels of Analysis\n\nThe most prominent focus of filial piety research is elder care. Both RFP and AFP have the same functions of sustaining family solidarity and responsibility for elder care at societal level, but the underlying mechanism of each aspect is distinctive at the individual level (Yeh et al., 2013). Specifically, RFP facilitates intergenerational support for parents through authentic gratitude and affection; AFP does it through the motivation to meet social expectations. The behavior may be the same, but the filial motivation is different. The implications of this difference for both the adult child and the parent are many.\n\nIn Chinese societies, RFP not only correlates with the caregivers\u2019 (adult children\u2019s) reduced burden and stress, but also with the elderly parents\u2019 enhanced self-worth (Chan et al., 2012). In addition, RFP correlates with adult children\u2019s intention to remain as caregivers of their parents as well as the quality of care they provide (Hsiao and Chiou, 2011). Neither of these studies found these positive benefits in relation to care attributed to AFP. RFP has been shown to have a significant positive relation with the frequency of assistance with household chores, financial support, as well as emotional support of aging parents. In contrast, AFP only showed a positive relation with the frequency of help with household chores (Yeh, 2009). This finding is similar to the results of studies applying the intergenerational solidarity theory that defined filial piety in terms of requirements to live near parents and make sacrifices (AFP aspects). As Gans et al. (2009) noted, the majority of these studies found only a weak relationship between norms and support behavior (e.g., Silverstein et al., 2006).\n\nMany societies face issues related to intergenerational support. A study based on a representative sample of Africans, Latinos, Asians, and Europeans concluded that there may be more similarities than differences in beliefs about intergenerational assistance (Coleman et al., 2006). The DFPM may be applied as a framework for investigation of this context. For example, in South Africa, the term black tax refers to financial transfers from black middle class individuals to their families, usually in rural areas (Mangoma and Wilson-Prangley, 2019). These remittances have been examined in depth from an economic perspective; there are fewer studies from an ethnographic perspective, and no dominant ethnographic approach (Carling, 2014). For the individual making the transfer, a narrow focus on economic aspects highlights the frame of a \u201ctax\u201d or a penalty in which these professionals are always encumbered with remittances to family members instead of investing or saving for retirement. They cannot get ahead in life. In contrast, a qualitative study explored the perspective that the remittances can be a bond that ties individuals to their families. Mangoma and Wilson-Prangley (2019) found that most participants had mixed feelings encompassing both obligation and gratitude for sacrifices that family members had made for them, and they recognized that these family sacrifices had given them opportunities and allowed them to succeed. Some participants described the payments to family members as \u201clightening their load\u201d rather than paying them back (p. 11). The majority expressed that despite any negative impact on their own success, \u201cthere are benefits to the transfers and that the experience is beneficial\u201d in terms of a sense of satisfaction and strengthening intergenerational relationships\u201d (p. 13). Remittances may be material, but they can also be relational and emotional. Whereas the economic perspective focused on social norms and obligation (AFP aspects), the ethnographic approach identified gratitude and personal relationships (RFP aspects) as the key to understanding the dynamics at work in this context. Application of the DFPM as a framework for investigating this context would suggest that it is important to consider both together.\n\nMeasuring Filial Piety\n\nWe began our review of filial piety research with a description of the earliest measure of filial piety, which was developed in Hong Kong (Ho and Lee, 1974). That measure suggested only authoritarian aspects of filial piety are relevant. To bring this review full circle, we conclude by mentioning a recent study conducted in Hong Kong that proposed a new measure of filial piety. The authors made the broad claim that \u201cfilial piety is no longer perceived as an authoritative obligation\u201d and proposed a measure in which they attempted to remove the authoritarian aspect and focus solely on the relational emotional aspect of filial piety in the context of support for aging parents (Lum et al., 2016).\n\nIn this section, we review Lum et al.\u2019s measure along with two other recently proposed measures of filial piety (i.e., Shi and Wang, 2019; Fu et al., 2020). These studies illustrate the problem of defining filial piety in terms of norms, as well as the importance of understanding the history of the conceptualization of filial piety and the content of previous measures.\n\nThe Relevance of Authoritarian Filial Piety\n\nIn the previous section, we described a body of research on elder care in Chinese societies indicating the positive benefits of RFP that were not similarly present with AFP. Given all those findings, it is easy to comprehend why one group of researchers advocated eliminating AFP from the measurement of filial piety altogether (i.e., Lum et al., 2016). Their argument was that filial norms have changed due to modernization and social change and thus there is a need for an updated measure. Grounding the definition of filial piety in social norms leads to this kind of reasoning. Although it may seem that according to the literature on elder care from Chinese societies, RFP provides all the benefits and AFP contributes little or causes problems, in the Confucian view, the ultimate goal is balance and harmony. The two motivations are intertwined, and both are necessary for human functioning. We thus contend that the authoritarian aspect is essential to understanding filial piety and that disregarding it would be a mistake for two main reasons.\n\nFirst, even if AFP is waning in Chinese societies as a motivator for elder care, the concept may still be relevant in other societies in this context. Both aspects of filial piety were identified as relevant to filial measures developed for Hispanic (Kao and Travis\u2019, 2005), Arabic (Khalaila, 2010), and Malay (Tan et al., 2019) societies. Also, researchers currently apply concepts related to AFP (only) to investigate filial obligation to support parents. For example, moral capital is the stock of internalized social norms regarding children\u2019s obligation to care for their older parents (Silverstein et al., 2012). The researchers developed this term for application in conditions in which children\u2019s gratitude or emotional bonds with their parents are insufficient to explain support of their parents. They argued that moral capital (an aspect of AFP) guarantees children\u2019s support of aging parents even with a weak parent-child relationship.\n\nSecond, both authoritarian and reciprocal filial motivations can be used to understand intergenerational relationships beyond just care for aging parents. We described previously some research findings that applied the DFPM to investigate adolescent development; AFP and RFP are suitable for investigating parent-child relations throughout the lifespan. Although AFP and RFP are conceptualized separately for analysis, they are often intertwined in important ways, which allows a highly nuanced understanding of complex conditions. We provide three examples of the application of the DFPM to parent-child relations at different levels of analysis to illustrate this point.\n\nUntil the 1990s, some young girls in Taiwan from impoverished families were indentured by their parents to brothels, usually to cover family medical or gambling debt (Hwang and Bedford, 2003). Parents appealed to their daughter\u2019s sense of filial piety to obtain her consent to indenture. Although they had little choice, the girls reported that they had not been forced; they had willingly agreed (an AFP-motivated decision). These girls were admired by their home communities for their sacrifice to support their family, and also for the income they provided. Filial prostitutes saw themselves as superior to the runaway prostituted girls and would not socialize with them in their free time. The filial girls had a much lower incidence of drug and alcohol abuse than the other girls (Hwang and Bedford, 2004). These girls had internalized their parents\u2019 values and felt they were demonstrating their love for their parents by supporting them (an RFP motivation), illustrating the complex intertwined nature of the two filial motivations.\n\nThe second example is from a recent qualitative study, which found that some single women in Taiwan purposefully choose careers requiring a lot of overtime and socializing outside of the office in order to deflect parental pressure to start a family (Bedford, 2016). Many had concerns about obligations to in-laws (with whom they would have an AFP relationship, at least in the beginning). They also did not want to directly object to their own parents\u2019 wishes. But, given their RFP relations with their own parents, they felt that their parents could accept a delay in marriage in order that their daughter experiences the job or career she likes. If women decide to delay or avoid marriage and family in order to escape the AFP obligations of in-laws, it could contribute to Taiwan\u2019s low birthrate, which would be an example of filial piety contributing to social trends, instead of the usual assumption that social trends influence filial beliefs.\n\nThe third example is that both aspects of filial piety have been used as political tools in China. To consolidate their power, imperial rulers stressed authoritarian moralism (AFP). Communist leaders later worked to eliminate filial beliefs in order to promote the centrality of the state (An, 2009). China\u2019s authorities switched tactics again to focus on reciprocal aspects of filial piety as a means of addressing the oncoming elder-care crisis with population aging (Xu, 2001). The 1980 Marriage Law gave parents the right to require regular payments from their children (Qi, 2015), and the Family Support Agreement (FSA) is a voluntary (yet legally binding) contract between parents and their adult children detailing obligations of ongoing support. From the perspective of the DFPM, the Chinese authorities are applying authoritarian tactics in an effort to promote RFP, which is unlikely to obtain the desired result. Indeed, Chou (2011) found that the FSA eroded spontaneity, flexibility, and affection in families (all aspects of RFP), which damaged relationships and resulted in an increase in family lawsuits. This example illustrates the importance of understanding the two filial motivations in order to design effective government policy around elder care and population aging.\n\nLum et al.\u2019s (2016) measure illustrates what can happen when filial piety is defined in terms of norms in a particular context in a particular culture at a particular point in time. Their measure may be able to assess the surface behavior related to filial piety in Hong Kong in the specific context of elder care. It is not able to address filial piety in general or speak to the deeper motivations underlying filial behavior.\n\nNormative Filial Piety in Three Dimensions\n\nLike the authors of the measure just reviewed, Fu et al. (2020) highlighted \u201cnew filial piety norms\u201d as the rationale for developing their measure (p. 177). Whereas Lum et al. (2016) developed a general measure applicable to all ages in Hong Kong, Fu et al. (2020) asserted that because the concept of filial piety relates to different generations, \u201cdifferent groups of people might have different understandings of and standards for what constitutes filial piety\u201d (p. 180). Their aim was to create a new measure of filial piety for elders aged 70 or older with the expectation that \u201ccontemporary elders in China hold less authoritative but more reciprocal stances toward filial piety\u201d (p. 176). Their study illustrates the importance of understanding the previous conceptualizations and content of earlier measures.\n\nFu et al. (2020) invoked research grounded in the intergenerational solidarity paradigm (Silverstein et al., 2002) to support their contention that the parent-child relationship (and thus filial piety) is reciprocal in nature. However, this research casts reciprocity as grounded in a cost-benefit analysis that is external to filial obligation. That is, filial obligation explains parental support in the absence of reciprocity. This stance does not accord with the author\u2019s premise that elders expect reciprocal aspects of filial piety to motivate their children to support them.\n\nTo develop their measure, Fu et al. (2020) pooled 38 items from three measures (Ho, 1994: 22 items, Yeh et al., 2013: six items, and Lum et al., 2016: 10 items). Most of these items represent aspects of AFP. Their analysis identified three factors with a total of 12 items: Caring for Parents (six items: described as representing the practical and emotional aspects of reciprocity), Familial Entirety (three items: described as a new domain related to elders\u2019 traditional Chinese normative values), and Familial Aspiration (three items: described as relating to authoritative obligation).\n\nThe authors concluded that their analysis indicated that elders in China are more reciprocal than authoritative in their stance toward filial piety. However, all the items in their measure start with the phrase, \u201cChildren should\u2026,\u201d which indicates a normative authoritarian orientation. Thus, the measure seems to address three domains of normative obligation: treatment of parents, carrying on the family name, and bringing honor to the family. It does not address reciprocity in the parent-child relationship.\n\nIn sum, Fu et al.\u2019s scale is concerned with expected filial behavior, not filial motivation. It can assess the expectation, but it cannot discriminate among underlying motivations for performing that behavior as the authors claim. This scale sheds light on what Chinese elders think their children should do, but not why they think they should do it.\n\nMeasuring Filial Piety Motivations With Three Dimensions\n\nWe have made the case for a shift from a surface (skin) focus on norms to a deep structure (skeleton) focus on the psychological motivations of filial piety. Shi and Wang (2019) recently made the case for focusing research on filial motivation with the argument that motivation is the central process for generating moral judgment and action, and proposed a new measure of filial piety, the three-dimensional filial piety model (TDFPM). Each of the three dimensions consists of two opposite poles: good affection (true\u2013false), family role norms (autonomy\u2013heteronomy), and balance of interests (reasonable\u2013unreasonable). Shi and Wang explained that the fundamental difference in the two poles of each dimension lies in the individual\u2019s motives. We agree and assert that in fact each of the three dimensions of the TDFPM can be expressed by casting the reciprocal and authoritarian motivations of the DFPM in opposition to one another.\n\nThat is, true affection, autonomous filial piety, and reasonable interests are grounded in RFP; false affection, heteronomous filial piety, and unreasonable interests are grounded in AFP. Whereas in the DFPM, AFP and RFP are independent dimensions, in the TDFPM, they are cast in opposition to one another and measured in conjunction with other concepts (instrumentality, self-awareness, and balanced interests). This configuration reduces the range of filial motivations that can be investigated since it does not allow for an individual to be high or low in both AFP and RFP.\n\nThe TDFPM focuses on motivations, which is a positive step that can allow for a more nuanced analysis of behavior than the traditional focus on filial norms. The model highlights some aspects such as instrumentality, self-awareness and balance of interests that may be useful to explore in the context of filial interaction. The model may be critiqued in that instead of adding new insight into the psychological motivations related to filial piety, it constricts the range of information available by integrating reciprocal and AFP with other concepts instead allowing for an investigation of the relationships among these and other concepts.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe reviewed some of the early literature on filial piety conceptualization and measurement. Studies from a variety of societies have converged on an understanding of filial piety that is associated with authoritarian/normative and emotional/relational aspects, although scholars have differed in their assessment of the relation of affection to filial piety. Studies that focused on norms have tended to associate filial piety with traditional beliefs, which limits the cross-cultural applicability of subsequent measures, and implies the necessity of updating the measures as norms change.\n\nDevelopment of psychology as a global science capable of representing the full human experience requires the ability to incorporate both cross-cultural invariance and cultural variation. By viewing the dual aspects of filial piety as fundamental psychological motivations grounded in the parent-child context, the DFPM is able to meet both of these criteria. According to Norenzayan and Heine\u2019s (2005) article conceptualizing psychological universals, a psychological phenomenon is a functional universal if the relationship between the variables remains the same, even if the strength of the pattern differs across societies. When filial piety is conceptualized as a contextualized personality construct, it meets this requirement.\n\nInstead of focusing on the behaviors, or attitudes toward norms of individuals (skin or surface content), the focus is on understanding the underlying psychological motivations (skeleton or deep structure) that support behavior and connect individuals with their environment in the context of the parent-child relationship. In other words, a filial behavior may be motivated by affection or obligation, each of which has its own set of implications.\n\nConcepts that focus on a universal context, such as parent-child interaction, can reflect local characteristics as well as shared elements of human behavior (Tsui, 2004). The DFPM connects the two universal individual filial motivations to the context in which they are most relevant. It highlights the horizontal and vertical aspects of parent-child relations that respectively reflect the reciprocal and authoritarian motivations that shape children\u2019s interactions with their parents. The horizontal (RFP) is motivated by genuine affection developed through intimate parent-child interaction and grounded in the equal relationship of two individuals. It meets the individual\u2019s need for mutual relatedness. The vertical aspect AFP is motivated by the child\u2019s normative desire to satisfy parental demands and grounded in the asymmetry of the parent-child relationship. It meets the individual\u2019s need for collective identification.\n\nAt the individual level, the DFPM is a tool for investigating the basic filial motivations of children and structural properties of the parent-child relationship. At the level of society, the DFPM can be applied to investigate social change or cross-cultural differences. At this level of analysis, the core aspect of filial relations, RFP, is relatively stable and is likely to share characteristics across cultures, whereas AFP is able to capture social change because it continues to reflect the internalized role obligations contained in cultural filial norms even though parents\u2019 authority over their children diminishes as the children grow up. In other words, AFP reflects the schema for social belongingness and collective identity that is necessary to be seen as a member of a particular social or cultural group. Over time, these norms are likely to evolve with broader social changes.\n\nThese two aspects of parent-child interaction are entwined in daily life; we distinguish them at a theoretical level in order to comprehensively parse the patterns of parent-child interaction. As inherent universal structures, the horizontal and vertical relational aspects provide a solid base for comparing similarities and differences in the ideal for parent-child interaction pattern across cultures. Social change or cultural norms only influence the relative weightings of each filial motivation. No matter how the corresponding behavioral norms change (more strict or loose), these two filial aspects will still continue to exist and function psychologically.\n\nData Availability Statement\n\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author/s.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nOB and K-HY contributed to the article and approved the submitted version.\n\nFunding\n\nPublication funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (Grant No: NSC 108-2410-H-001-054-MY2).\n\nConflict of Interest\n\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\nReferences\n\nAinsworth, M., and Bell, S.

This well known tale involves filial piety. In ancient Chinese culture, filial piety is considered the fundamental principle of Confucian ethics. It is recognised as the source of all virtue.\n\nThese traditional moral principles were largely degraded when the Cultural Revolution reshaped China\u2019s values. The Chinese Communist Party demands allegiance to central authority and condemns traditional values as feudal relics to be eradicated. One is expected to be loyal to the Party, rather than one\u2019s family.\n\nNear the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty (25 \u2013 220 A.D.) a baby boy named Wang Xiang (185\u2013269) was born to Wang Rong and Lady Xue. This was a chaotic period when many warlords were vying for control of the country\u2019s resources.\n\nLady Xue died when the boy was young, and Wang Rong married Lady Zhu who bore him a son called Wang Lan. Lady Zhu was envious of Wang Xiang. Instead of giving him the sympathy he needed, she resented him and treated him dishonorably. She thrashed him and blamed him for minor matters. His father Wang Rong was swayed by her to participate in abusing him.\n\nWang walked down to the river, took off his clothes and lay on the ice so that his body heat would melt the ice. Blue and shivering with cold, he called out to the gods to assist him in fulfilling his wish of filial duty. (Image: Wikimedia Commons Public Domain)\n\n\n\n\n\nWang Xiang was truly alone.\n\nYet, over the course of 20 years Wang Xiang stayed with his family, and although he received many an invitation to serve as an official in the local commandery office, he turned them down.\n\nLady Zhu continued to treat Wang Xiang badly. He was forced to sweep the cow shed every day, and had to shoulder all of the arduous household duties. Wang Xiang always complied with his stepmother\u2019s instructions without raising a voice of dissatisfaction. Everything he accomplished was done with attention and sincerity. His filial devotion for both of his parents was shown despite his terrible treatment.\n\nOne time, Lady Zhu became so ill that she was bedridden, yet she wanted carp for dinner. Since it was winter, all the rivers were frozen. Wang Xiang thought hard about how he could obtain the desired fish.\n\nHe walked down to the river, took off his clothes and lay on the ice so that his body heat would melt the ice. Blue and shivering with cold, Wang Xiang called out to the gods to assist him in fulfilling his wish of filial duty. After a while, the ice underneath him suddenly thawed, and from its frosty depths, out sprang a carp!\n\nWang\u2019s dedication in the face of unusually cruel abuse became well-known and is encapsulated in the Chinese idiom \u201cLying on Ice for Carp.\u201d\n\nAs Wang Xiang grew, the Han Dynasty was eventually ripped apart by uprisings and civil war. Wang Rong died, and the younger Wang took his stepmother and step-brother, fleeing a long distance from their city. He stayed with them for 30 years.\n\nA local governor was so deeply moved by Wang Xiang\u2019s devotion that he appointed him as a state official. His effective initiatives gained him much respect and admiration from the public. He also became a ceremony minister and advisor to the young Emperor Cao Mao.\n\nWang died in 269 at the age of 85, having served many decades as a loyal statesman. He was awarded the posthumous title \u201cDuke Yuan.\u201d Wang Xiang is cherished as a perfect model of the highest of all virtues, filial piety.

Leave this field empty if you're human:\n\nThe term filial piety was commonly used in ancient times and refers to the virtue of respect for one\u2019s parents, elders, and ancestors. The idea was it was the basis of how to set up a good society and is from Confucian thought as well as Chinese Buddhist and Taoist ethics.\n\nIt is not just about conducting yourself well inside the household, but also extending this to outside your home to bring a good name to your parents and their ancestors. It is about supporting, respecting, caring, and showing honor toward your parents through sickness and death \u2014 making any sacrifice needed to honor this Heaven-made vow.\n\nAncient Chinese story on filial piety\n\nEmperor Wen, who was also known as Liu Heng, was the fourth son of the first Han Emperor. He was very bright when he was a child and showed filial piety to his Queen Mother Bo. Every morning, the first thing he did was to greet his mother, and he did the same thing before she went to bed.\n\nEmperor Wen of Han in the Song Dynasty \u2014 painting from the Taipei National Palace Museum. (Image: via Public Domain)\n\nAfter Emperor Wen ascended the throne, Queen Mother Bo became very sick and Emperor Wen accompanied her all the time, even if it meant that he could not sleep well. Sometimes, he did not take his clothes off in the evening just in case she called for him. Every time the herbal medicine was cooked, he would taste it first to make sure that it was not too bitter or too hot before letting his mother drink it.\n\nQueen Mother Bo saw all of this, and her heart was deeply moved. She said to him: \u201cMy sickness will not go away anytime soon. We have many servants in the royal palace who can take care of me; you do not need to burden yourself.\u201d\n\n\u2018If I do not personally take care of you while you are alive in this life, when will there be a chance for me to repay you for the grace of your parenting?\u2019 (Image: via Liane Metzler via Unsplash)\n\nUpon hearing this, Emperor Wen kneeled in front of his mother and said: \u201cIf I do not personally take care of you while you are alive in this life, when will there be a chance for me to repay you for the grace of your parenting?\u201d\n\nThree years later, Queen Mother Bo gradually recovered. Everyone said that it was because of Emperor Wen\u2019s wholehearted care. After that, people both inside and outside the royal court respected Emperor Wen even more. Everyone took him as an exemplar. During that time in history, everyone regarded filial piety toward parents as the most honored virtue.\n\nThese essential historical stories and enchanting legends reveal some of the profound wisdom of China\u2019s 5,000-year-old traditional culture.

The Chinese term Ru (\u5112) predates Confucius, and connoted specialists in ritual and music, and later experts in Classical Studies. Ru is routinely translated into English as \u201cConfucian\u201d. Yet \u201cConfucian\u201d is also sometimes used in English to refer to the sage kings of antiquity who were credited with key cultural innovations by the Ru, to sacrificial practices at temples dedicated to Confucius and related figures, and to traditional features of East Asian social organization like the \u201cbureaucracy\u201d or \u201cmeritocracy\u201d. For this reason, the term Confucian will be avoided in this entry, which will focus on the philosophical aspects of the thought of Confucius (the Latinization used for \u201cMaster Kong\u201d following the English-language convention) primarily, but not exclusively, through the lens of the Analects.\n\nAt different times in Chinese history, Confucius (trad. 551\u2013479 BCE) has been portrayed as a teacher, advisor, editor, philosopher, reformer, and prophet. The name Confucius, a Latinized combination of the surname Kong \u5b54 with an honorific suffix \u201cMaster\u201d (fuzi \u592b\u5b50), has also come to be used as a global metonym for different aspects of traditional East Asian society. This association of Confucius with many of the foundational concepts and cultural practices in East Asia, and his casting as a progenitor of \u201cEastern\u201d thought in Early Modern Europe, make him arguably the most significant thinker in East Asian history. Yet while early sources preserve biographical details about Master Kong, dialogues and stories about him in early texts like the Analects (Lunyu \u8ad6\u8a9e) reflect a diversity of representations and concerns, strands of which were later differentially selected and woven together by interpreters intent on appropriating or condemning particular associated views and traditions. This means that the philosophy of Confucius is historically underdetermined, and it is possible to trace multiple sets of coherent doctrines back to the early period, each grounded in different sets of classical sources and schools of interpretation linked to his name. After introducing key texts and interpreters, then, this entry explores three principal interconnected areas of concern: a psychology of ritual that describes how ideal social forms regulate individuals, an ethics rooted in the cultivation of a set of personal virtues, and a theory of society and politics based on normative views of the family and the state.\n\n1. Confucius as Chinese Philosopher and Symbol of Traditional Culture\n\nBecause of the wide range of texts and traditions identified with him, choices about which version of Confucius is authoritative have changed over time, reflecting particular political and social priorities. The portrait of Confucius as philosopher is, in part, the product of a series of modern cross-cultural interactions. In Imperial China, Confucius was identified with interpretations of the classics and moral guidelines for administrators, and therefore also with training the scholar-officials that populated the bureaucracy. At the same time, he was closely associated with the transmission of the ancient sacrificial system, and he himself received ritual offerings in temples found in all major cities. By the Han (202 BCE\u2013220 CE), Confucius was already an authoritative figure in a number of different cultural domains, and the early commentaries show that reading texts associated with him about history, ritual, and proper behavior was important to rulers. The first commentaries to the Analects were written by tutors to the crown prince (e.g., Zhang Yu \u5f35\u79b9, d. 5 BCE), and select experts in the \u201cFive Classics\u201d (Wujing \u4e94\u7d93) were given scholastic positions in the government. The authority of Confucius was such that during the late Han and the following period of disunity, his imprimatur was used to validate commentaries to the classics, encoded political prophecies, and esoteric doctrines.\n\nBy the Song period (960\u20131279), the post-Buddhist revival known as \u201cNeo-Confucianism\u201d anchored readings of the dialogues of Confucius to a dualism between \u201ccosmic pattern\u201d (li \u7406) and \u201cpneumas\u201d (qi \u6c23), a distinctive moral cosmology that marked the tradition off from those of Buddhism and Daoism. The Neo-Confucian interpretation of the Analects by Zhu Xi \u6731\u71b9 (1130\u20131200) integrated the study of the Analects into a curriculum based on the \u201cFour Books\u201d (Sishu \u56db\u66f8) that became widely influential in China, Korea, and Japan. The pre-modern Confucius was closely associated with good government, moral education, proper ritual performance, and the reciprocal obligations that people in different roles owed each other in such contexts.\n\nWhen Confucius became a character in the intellectual debates of eighteenth century Europe, he became identified as China\u2019s first philosopher. Jesuit missionaries in China sent back accounts of ancient China that portrayed Confucius as inspired by Natural Theology to pursue the good, which they considered a marked contrast with the \u201cidolatries\u201d of Buddhism and Daoism. Back in Europe, intellectuals read missionary descriptions and translations of Chinese literature, and writers like Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646\u20131716) and Nicolas-Gabriel Clerc (1726\u20131798) praised Confucius for his discovery of universal natural laws through reason. Enlightenment writers celebrated the moral philosophy of Confucius for its independence from the dogmatic influence of the Church. While at times he was criticized as an atheist or an advocate of despotism, many Europeans viewed Confucius as a moral philosopher whose approach was in line with rationalism and humanism.\n\nToday, many descriptions combine these several ways of positioning Confucius, but the modern interpretation of his views has been complicated by a tendency to look back on him as an emblem of the \u201ctraditional culture\u201d of China. In the eyes of some late nineteenth and twentieth century reformers who sought to fortify China against foreign influence, the moral teachings of Confucius had the potential to play the same role that they perceived Christianity had done in the modernization of Europe and America, or serve as the basis of a more secular spiritual renewal that would transform the population into citizens of a modern nation-state. In the twentieth century, the pursuit of modernization also led to the rejection of Confucius by some reformers in the May Fourth and New Culture movements, as well as by many in the Communist Party, who identified the traditional hierarchies implicit in his social and political philosophy with the social and economic inequalities that they sought to eliminate. In these modern debates, it is not just the status of Confucius in traditional China that made him such a potent symbol. His specific association with the curriculum of the system of education of scholar-officials in the imperial government, and of traditional moral values more generally, connected him to the aspects of tradition worth preserving, or the things that held China back from modernization, depending on one\u2019s point of view.\n\nAs legacies of Confucius tied to traditional ritual roles and the pre-modern social structure were criticized by modernizers, a view of Confucius as a moral philosopher, already common in European readings, gained ascendancy in East Asia. The American-educated historian Hu Shi \u80e1\u9069 (1891\u20131962) wrote an early influential history of Chinese philosophy, beginning with Laozi \u8001\u5b50 and Confucius, explicitly on the model of existing histories of Western philosophy. In it, Hu compared what he called the conservative aspect of the philosophy of Confucius to Socrates and Plato. Since at least that time, Confucius has been central to most histories of Chinese philosophy.\n\n2. Sources for Confucius\u2019s Life and Thought\n\nBiographical treatments of Confucius, beginning with the \u201cHereditary House of Confucius\u201d (Kongzi shijia \u5b54\u5b50\u4e16\u5bb6), a chapter of Sima Qian\u2019s \u53f8\u99ac\u9077 (c.145\u2013c.86 BCE) Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji \u53f2\u8a18), were initially based on information from compilations of independently circulating dialogues and prose accounts. Tying particular elements of his philosophy to the life experiences of Confucius is a risky and potentially circular exercise, since many of the details of his biography were first recorded in instructive anecdotes linked to the expression of didactic messages. Nevertheless, since Sima Qian\u2019s time, the biography of Confucius has been intimately linked with the interpretation of his philosophy, and so this section begins with a brief treatment of traditional tropes about his family background, official career, and teaching of 72 disciples, before turning to the dialogue and prose accounts upon which early biographers like Sima Qian drew.\n\nConfucius was born in the domain of Zou, in modern Shandong Province, south of the larger kingdom of Lu. A date of 551 BCE is given for his birth in the Gongyang Commentary (Gongyang zhuan \u516c\u7f8a\u50b3) to the classic Spring and Autumn Annals (Chunqiu \u6625\u79cb), which places him in the period when the influence of the Zhou polity was declining, and regional domains were becoming independent states. His father, who came from Lu, was descended from a noble clan that included, in Sima Qian\u2019s telling, several people known for their modesty and ritual mastery. His father died when Confucius was a small child, leaving the family poor but with some social status, and as a young man Confucius became known for expertise in the classical ritual and ceremonial forms of the Zhou. In adulthood, Confucius travelled to Lu and began a career as an official in the employ of aristocratic families.\n\nDifferent sources identify Confucius as having held a large number of different offices in Lu. Entries in the Zuo Commentary (Zuozhuan \u5de6\u50b3) to the Spring and Autumn Annals for 509 and 500 BCE identify him as Director of Corrections (Sikou \u53f8\u5bc7), and say he was charged with assisting the ruler with the rituals surrounding a visiting dignitary from the state of Qi, respectively. The Mencius (Mengzi \u5b5f\u5b50), a text centered on a figure generally regarded as the most important early developer of the thought of Confucius, Mencius (trad. 372\u2013289 BCE), says Confucius was Foodstuffs Scribe (Weili \u59d4\u540f) and Scribe in the Field (Chengtian \u4e58\u7530), involved with managing the accounting at the granary and keeping the books on the pasturing of different animals (11.14).[1] In the first biography, Sima Qian mentions these offices, but then adds a second set of more powerful positions in Lu including Steward (Zai \u5bb0) managing an estate in the district of Zhongdu, Minister of Works (Sikong \u53f8\u7a7a), and even acting Chancellor (Xiang \u76f8). Following his departure from Lu, different stories place Confucius in the kingdoms of Wei, Song, Chen, Cai, and Chu. Sima Qian crafted these stories into a serial narrative of rulers failing to appreciate the moral worth of Confucius, whose high standards forced him to continue to travel in search of an incorrupt ruler.\n\nLate in life, Confucius left service and turned to teaching. In Sima Qian\u2019s time, the sheer number of independently circulating texts centering on dialogues that Confucius had with his disciples led the biographer to include a separate chapter on \u201cThe arranged traditions of the disciples of Confucius\u201d (Zhongni dizi liezhuan \u4ef2\u5c3c\u5f1f\u5b50\u5217\u50b3). His account identifies 77 direct disciples, whom Sima Qian says Confucius trained in ritual practice and the Classic of Odes (Shijing \u8a69\u7d93), Classic of Documents (Shujing \u66f8\u7d93, also called Documents of the Predecessors or Shangshu \u5c1a\u66f8), Records of Ritual (Liji \u79ae\u8a18) and Classic of Music (Yuejing \u6a02\u7d93). Altogether, some 3000 students received some form of this training regimen. Sima Qian\u2019s editorial practice in systematizing dialogues was inclusive, and the fact that he was able to collect so much information some three centuries after the death of Confucius testifies to the latter\u2019s importance in the Han period. Looked at in a different way, the prodigious numbers of direct disciples and students of Confucius, and the inconsistent accounts of the offices in which he served, may also be due to a proliferation of texts associating the increasingly authoritative figure of Confucius with divergent regional or interpretive traditions during those intervening centuries.\n\nThe many sources of quotations and dialogues of Confucius, both transmitted and recently excavated, provide a wealth of materials about the philosophy of Confucius, but an incomplete sense of which materials are authoritative. The last millennium has seen the development of a conventional view that materials preserved in the twenty chapters of the transmitted Analects most accurately represent Confucius\u2019s original teachings. This derives in part from a second century CE account by Ban Gu \u73ed\u56fa (39\u201392 CE) of the composition of the Analects that describes the work as having been compiled by first and second generation disciples of Confucius and then transmitted privately for centuries, making it arguably the oldest stratum of extant Confucius sources. In the centuries since, some scholars have come up with variations on this basic account, such as Liu Baonan\u2019s \u5289\u5bf3\u6960 (1791\u20131855) view in Corrected Meanings of the Analects (Lunyu zhengyi \u8ad6\u8a9e\u6b63\u7fa9) that each chapter was written by a different disciple. Recently, several centuries of doubts about internal inconsistencies in the text and a lack of references to the title in early sources were marshaled by classicist Zhu Weizheng \u6731\u7dad\u931a in an influential 1986 article which argued that the lack of attributed quotations from the Analects, and of explicit references to it, prior to the second century BCE, meant that its traditional status as the oldest stratum of the teachings of Confucius was undeserved. Since then a number of historians, including Michael J. Hunter, have systematically shown that writers started to demonstrate an acute interest in the Analects only in the late second and first centuries BCE, suggesting that other Confucius-related records from those centuries should also be considered as potentially authoritative sources. Some have suggested this critical approach to sources is an attack on the historicity of Confucius, but a more reasonable description is that it is an attack on the authoritativeness of the Analects that broadens and diversifies the sources that may be used to reconstruct the historical Confucius.\n\nExpanding the corpus of Confucius quotations and dialogues beyond the Analects, then, requires attention to three additional types of sources. First, dialogues preserved in transmitted sources like the Records of Ritual, the Elder Dai\u2019s Records of Ritual (DaDai Liji \u5927\u6234\u79ae\u8a18), and Han collections like the Family Discussions of Confucius (Kongzi jiayu \u5b54\u5b50\u5bb6\u8a9e) contain a large number of diverse teachings. Second, quotations attached to the interpretation of passages in the classics preserved in works like the Zuo Commentary to the Spring and Autumn Annals, or Han\u2019s Intertextual Commentary on the Odes (Han Shi waizhuan \u97d3\u8a69\u5916\u50b3) are particularly rich sources for readings of history and poetry. Finally, a number of recently archaeologically recovered texts from the Han period and before have also expanded the corpus.\n\nNewly discovered sources include three recently excavated versions of texts with parallel to the transmitted Analects. These are the 1973 excavation at the Dingzhou site in Hebei Province dating to 55 BCE; the 1990\u2019s excavation of a partial parallel version at Jongbaekdong in Pyongyang, North Korea, dating to between 62 and 45 BCE; and most recently the 2011-2015 excavation of the tomb of the Marquis of Haihun in Jiangxi Province dating to 59 BCE. The Haihun excavation is particularly important because it is thought to contain the two lost chapters of what Han period sources identify as a 22-chapter version of the Analects that circulated in the state of Qi, the titles of which appear to be \u201cUnderstanding the Way\u201d (Zhi dao \u667a\u9053) and \u201cQuestions about Jade\u201d (Wen yu \u554f\u7389). While the Haihun Analects has yet to be published, the content of the lost chapters overlaps with a handful of fragments dating to the late first century BCE that were found at the Jianshui Jinguan site in Jinta county in Gansu Province in 1973. All in all, these finds confirm the sudden wide circulation of the Analects in the middle of the first century BCE.\n\nPreviously unknown Confucius dialogues and quotations have also been unearthed. The Dingzhou site also yielded texts given the titles \u201cSayings of the Ru\u201d (Rujiazhe yan \u5112\u5bb6\u8005\u8a00) and \u201cDuke Ai asked about the five kinds of righteousness\u201d (Aigong wen wuyi \u54c0\u516c\u554f\u4e94\u7fa9). A significantly different text also given the name \u201cSayings of the Ru\u201d was found in 1977 in a Han tomb at Fuyang in Anhui Province. Several texts dating to 168 BCE recording statements by Confucius about the Classic of Changes (Yijing \u6613\u7d93) were excavated from the Mawangdui site in Hunan Province in 1973. Additionally, a number of Warring States period dialogical texts centered on particular disciples, and a text with interpretative comments by Confucius on the Classic of Poetry given the name \u201cConfucius discusses the Odes\u201d (Kongzi shilun \u5b54\u5b50\u8a69\u8ad6), were looted from tombs in the 1990s, sold on the black market, and made their way to the Shanghai Museum. Finally, the 59 BCE tomb of the Marquis of Haihun also contains a number of previously unknown Confucius dialogues and quotations on ritual and filial piety, along with materials that overlap with sections of transmitted texts including the Analects, Records of Ritual and the Elder Dai\u2019s Records of Ritual.\n\nSome excavated texts, like the pre-Han period \u201cThicket of Sayings\u201d (Yucong \u8a9e\u53e2) apothegms excavated at the Guodian site in Hubei Province in 1993, contain fragments of the Analects in circulation without attribution to Confucius. Transmitted materials also show some of the quotations attributed to Confucius in the Analects in the mouths of other historical figures. The fluidity and diversity of Confucius-related materials in circulation prior to the fixing of the Analects text in the second century BCE, suggest that the Analects itself, with its keen interest in ritual, personal ethics, and politics, may well have been in part a topical selection from a larger and more diverse set of available Confucius-related materials. In other words, there were already multiple topical foci prior to any horizon by which we can definitively deem any single focus to be authoritative. It is for this reason that the essential core of the teachings of Confucius is historically underdetermined, and the correct identification of the core teachings is still avidly debated. The following sections treat three key aspects of the philosophy of Confucius, each different but all interrelated, found throughout many of these diverse sets of sources: a theory of how ritual and musical performance functioned to promote unselfishness and train emotions, advice on how to inculcate a set of personal virtues to prepare people to behave morally in different domains of their lives, and a social and political philosophy that abstracted classical ideals of proper conduct in family and official contexts to apply to more general contexts.\n\n3. Ritual Psychology and Social Values\n\nThe Records of Ritual, the Analects, and numerous Han collections portray Confucius as being deeply concerned with the proper performance of ritual and music. In such works, the description of the attitudes and affect of the performer became the foundation of a ritual psychology in which proper performance was key to reforming desires and beginning to develop moral dispositions. Confucius sought to preserve the Zhou ritual system, and theorized about how ritual and music inculcated social roles, limited desires and transformed character.\n\nMany biographies begin their description of his life with a story of Confucius at an early age performing rituals, reflecting accounts and statements that demonstrate his prodigious mastery of ritual and music. The archaeological record shows that one legacy of the Zhou period into which Confucius was born was a system of sumptuary regulations that encoded social status. Another of these legacies was ancestral sacrifice, a means to demonstrate people\u2019s reverence for their ancestors while also providing a way to ask the spirits to assist them or to guarantee them protection from harm. The Analects describes the ritual mastery of Confucius in receiving guests at a noble\u2019s home (10.3), and in carrying out sacrifices (10.8, 15.1). He plays the stone chimes (14.39), distinguishes between proper and improper music (15.11, 17.18), and extols and explains the Classic of Odes to his disciples (1.15, 2.2, 8.3, 16.13, 17.9). This mastery of classical ritual and musical forms is an important reason Confucius said he \u201cfollowed Zhou\u201d (3.14). While he might alter a detail of a ritual out of frugality (9.3), Confucius insists on adherence to the letter of the rites, as when his disciple Zi Gong \u5b50\u8ca2 sought to substitute another animal for a sheep in a seasonal sacrifice, saying \u201cthough you care about the sheep, I care about the ritual\u201d (3.17). It was in large part this adherence to Zhou period cultural forms, or to what Confucius reconstructed them to be, that has led many in the modern period to label him a traditionalist.\n\nWhere Confucius clearly innovated was in his rationale for performing the rites and music. Historian Yan Buke \u95bb\u6b65\u514b has argued that the early Confucian (Ru) tradition began from the office of the \u201cMusic master\u201d (Yueshi \u6a02\u5e2b) described in the Ritual of Zhou (Zhou Li \u5468\u79ae). Yan\u2019s view is that since these officials were responsible for teaching the rites, music, and the Classic of Odes, it was their combined expertise that developed into the particular vocation that shaped the outlook of Confucius. Early discussions of ritual in the Zhou classics often explained ritual in terms of a do ut des view of making offerings to receive benefits. By contrast, early discussions between Confucius and his disciples described benefits of ritual performance that went beyond the propitiation of spirits, rewards from the ancestors, or the maintenance of the social or cosmic order. Instead of emphasizing goods that were external to the performer, these works stressed the value of the associated interior psychological states of the practitioner. In Analects 3.26, Confucius condemns the performance of ritual without reverence (jing \u656c). He also condemns views of ritual that focus only on the offerings, or views of music that focus only on the instruments (17.11). Passages from the Records of Ritual explain that Confucius would rather have an excess of reverence than an excess of ritual (\u201cTangong, shang\u201d \u6a80\u5f13\u4e0a), and that reverence is the most important aspect of mourning rites (\u201cZaji, xia\u201d \u96dc\u8a18\u4e0b). This emphasis on the importance of an attitude of reverence became the salient distinction between performing ritual in a rote manner, and performing it in the proper affective state. Another passage from the Records of Ritual says the difference between how an ideal gentleman and a lesser person cares for a parent is that the gentleman is reverent when he does it (\u201cFangji\u201d \u574a\u8a18, cf. Analects 2.7). In contexts concerning both ritual and filial piety (xiao \u5b5d), the affective state behind the action is arguably more important than the action\u2019s consequences. As Philip J. Ivanhoe has written, ritual and music are not just an indicator of values in the sense that these examples show, but also an inculcator of them.\n\nIn this ritual psychology, the performance of ritual and music restricts desires because it alters the performer\u2019s affective states, and place limits on appetitive desires. The Records of Ritual illustrates desirable affective states, describing how the Zhou founder King Wen \u6587 was moved to joy when making offerings to his deceased parents, but then to grief once the ritual ended (\u201cJiyi\u201d \u796d\u7fa9). A collection associated with the third century BCE philosopher Xunzi \u8340\u5b50 contains a Confucius quotation that associates different parts of a ruler\u2019s day with particular emotions. Entering the ancestral temple to make offerings and maintain a connection to those who are no longer living leads the ruler to reflect on sorrow, while wearing a cap to hear legal cases leads him to reflect on worry (\u201cAigong\u201d \u54c0\u516c). These are examples of the way that ritual fosters the development of particular emotional responses, part of a sophisticated understanding of affective states and the ways that performance channels them in particular directions. More generally, the social conventions implicit in ritual hierarchies restrict people\u2019s latitude to pursue their desires, as the master explains in the Records of Ritual:\n\nThe way of the gentleman may be compared to an embankment dam, bolstering those areas where ordinary people are deficient (\u201cFangji\u201d).\n\nBlocking the overflow of desires by adhering to these social norms preserves psychological space to reflect and reform one\u2019s reactions.\n\nDescriptions of the early community depict Confucius creating a subculture in which ritual provided an alternate source of value, effectively training his disciples to opt out of conventional modes of exchange. In the Analects, when Confucius says he would instruct any person who presented him with \u201ca bundle of dried meat\u201d (7.7), he is highlighting how his standards of value derive from the sacrificial system, eschewing currency or luxury items. Gifts valuable in ordinary situations might be worth little by such standards: \u201cEven if a friend gave him a gift of a carriage and horses, if it was not dried meat, he did not bow\u201d (10.15). The Han period biographical materials in Records of the Historian describe how a high official of the state of Lu did not come to court for three days after the state of Qi made him a gift of female entertainers. When, additionally, the high official failed to properly offer gifts of sacrificial meats, Confucius departed Lu for the state of Wei (47, cf. Analects 18.4). Confucius repeatedly rejected conventional values of wealth and position, choosing instead to rely on ritual standards of value. In some ways, these stories are similar to ones in the late Warring States and Han period compilation Master Zhuang (Zhuangzi \u838a\u5b50) that explore the way that things that are conventionally belittled for their lack of utility are useful by an unconventional standard. However, here the standard that gives such objects currency is ritual importance rather than longevity, divorcing Confucius from conventional materialistic or hedonistic pursuits. This is a second way that ritual allows one to direct more effort into character formation.\n\nOnce, when speaking of cultivating benevolence, Confucius explained how ritual value was connected to the ideal way of the gentleman, which should always take precedence over the pursuit of conventional values:\n\nWealth and high social status are what others covet. If I cannot prosper by following the way, I will not dwell in them. Poverty and low social status are what others shun. If I cannot prosper by following the way, I will not avoid them. (4.5)\n\nThe argument that ritual performance has internal benefits underlies the ritual psychology laid out by Confucius, one that explains how performing ritual and music controls desires and sets the stage for further moral development.\n\n4. Virtues and Character Formation\n\nMany of the short passages from the Analects, and the \u201cThicket of Sayings\u201d passages excavated at Guodian, describe the development of set of ideal behaviors associated with the moral ideal of the \u201cway\u201d (dao \u9053) of the \u201cgentleman\u201d (junzi \u541b\u5b50). Based on the analogy between the way of Confucius and character ethics systems deriving from Aristotle, these patterns of behavior are today often described using the Latinate term \u201cvirtue\u201d. In the second passage in the Analects, the disciple You Ruo \u6709\u82e5 says a person who behaves with filial piety to parents and siblings (xiao and di \u5f1f), and who avoids going against superiors, will rarely disorder society. It relates this correlation to a more general picture of how patterns of good behavior effectively open up the possibility of following the way of the gentleman: \u201cThe gentleman works at the roots. Once the roots are established, the way comes to life\u201d (1.2). The way of the gentleman is a distillation of the exemplary behaviors of the selfless culture heroes of the past, and is available to all who are willing to \u201cwork at the roots\u201d. In this way, the virtues that Confucius taught were not original to him, but represented his adaptations of existing cultural ideals, to which he continually returned in order to clarify their proper expressions in different situations. Five behaviors of the gentleman most central to the Analects are benevolence (ren \u4ec1), righteousness (yi \u7fa9), ritual propriety (li \u79ae), wisdom (zhi \u667a), and trustworthiness (xin \u4fe1).\n\nThe virtue of benevolence entails interacting with others guided by a sense of what is good from their perspectives. Sometimes the Analects defines benevolence generally as \u201ccaring for others\u201d (12.22), but in certain contexts it is associated with more specific behaviors. Examples of contextual definitions of benevolence include treating people on the street as important guests and common people as if they were attendants at a sacrifice (12.2), being reticent in speaking (12.3) and rejecting the use of clever speech (1.3), and being respectful where one dwells, reverent where one works, and loyal where one deals with others (13.19). It is the broadest of the virtues, yet a gentleman would rather die than compromise it (15.9). Benevolence entails a kind of unselfishness, or, as David Hall and Roger Ames suggest, it involves forming moral judgments from a combined perspective of self and others.\n\nLater writers developed accounts of the sources of benevolent behavior, most famously in the context of the discussion of human nature (xing \u6027) in the centuries after Confucius. Mencius (fourth century BCE) argued that benevolence grows out of the cultivation of an affective disposition to compassion (ceyin \u60fb\u96b1) in the face of another\u2019s distress. The anonymous author of the late Warring States period excavated text \u201cFive Kinds of Action\u201d (Wu xing \u4e94\u884c) describes it as building from the affection one feels for close family members, through successive stages to finally develop into a more universal, fully-fledged virtue. In the Analects, however, one comment on human nature emphasizes the importance of nurture: \u201cBy nature people are close, by habituation they are miles apart\u201d (17.2), a sentiment that suggests the importance of training one\u2019s dispositions through ritual and the classics in a manner closer to the program of Xunzi (third century BCE). The Analects, however, discusses the incubation of benevolent behavior in family and ritual contexts. You Ruo winds up his discussion of the roots of the way of the gentleman with the rhetorical question: \u201cIs not behaving with filial piety to one\u2019s parents and siblings the root of benevolence?\u201d (1.2). Confucius tells his disciple Yan Yuan \u984f\u6df5 that benevolence is a matter of \u201covercoming oneself and returning to ritual propriety\u201d (12.1). These connections between benevolence and other virtues underscore the way in which benevolent behavior does not entail creating novel social forms or relationships, but is grounded in traditional familial and ritual networks.\n\nThe second virtue, righteousness, is often described in the Analects relative to situations involving public responsibility. In contexts where standards of fairness and integrity are valuable, such as acting as the steward of an estate as some of the disciples of Confucius did, righteousness is what keeps a person uncorrupted. Confucius wrote that a gentleman \u201cthinks of righteousness when faced with gain\u201d (16.10, 19.10), or \u201cwhen faced with profit\u201d (14.12). Confucius says that one should ignore the wealth and rank one might attain by acting against righteousness, even if it means eating coarse rice, drinking water, and sleeping using one\u2019s bent arm as a pillow (7.16). Later writers like Xunzi celebrated Confucius for his righteousness in office, which he stressed was all the more impressive because Confucius was extremely poor (\u201cWangba\u201d \u738b\u9738). This behavior is particularly relevant in official interactions with ordinary people, such as when \u201cemploying common people\u201d (5.16), and if a social superior has mastered it, \u201cthe common people will all comply\u201d (13.4). Like benevolence, righteousness also entails unselfishness, but instead of coming out of consideration for the needs of others, it is rooted in steadfastness in the face of temptation.\n\nThe perspective needed to act in a righteous way is sometimes related to an attitude to personal profit that recalls the previous section\u2019s discussion of how Confucius taught his disciples to recalibrate their sense of value based on their immersion in the sacrificial system. More specifically, evaluating things based on their ritual significance can put one at odds with conventional hierarchies of value. This is defined as the root of righteous behavior in a story from the late Warring States period text Master Fei of Han (Han Feizi \u97d3\u975e\u5b50). The tale relates how at court, Confucius was given a plate with a peach and a pile of millet grains with which to scrub the fruit clean. After the attendants laughed at Confucius for proceeding to eat the millet first, Confucius explained to them that in sacrifices to the Former Kings, millet itself is the most valued offering. Therefore, cleaning a ritually base peach with millet:\n\nwould be obstructing righteousness, and so I dared not put [the peach] above what fills the vessels in the ancestral shrine. (\u201cWaichu shuo, zuo shang\u201d \u5916\u5132\u8aaa\u5de6\u4e0a)\n\nWhile such stories may have been told to mock his fastidiousness, for Confucius the essence of righteousness was internalizing a system of value that he would breach for neither convenience nor profit.\n\nAt times, the phrase \u201cbenevolence and righteousness\u201d is used metonymically for all the virtues, but in some later texts, a benevolent impulse to compassion and a righteous steadfastness are seen as potentially contradictory. In the Analects, portrayals of Confucius do not recognize a tension between benevolence and righteousness, perhaps because each is usually described as salient in a different set of contexts. In ritual contexts like courts or shrines, one ideally acts like one might act out of familial affection in a personal context, the paradigm that is key to benevolence. In the performance of official duties, one ideally acts out of the responsibilities felt to inferiors and superiors, with a resistance to temptation by corrupt gain that is key to righteousness. The Records of Ritual distinguishes between the domains of these two virtues:\n\nIn regulating one\u2019s household, kindness overrules righteousness. Outside of one\u2019s house, righteousness cuts off kindness. What one undertakes in serving one\u2019s father, one also does in serving one\u2019s lord, because one\u2019s reverence for both is the same. Treating nobility in a noble way and the honorable in an honorable way, is the height of righteousness. (\u201cSangfu sizhi\u201d \u55aa\u670d\u56db\u5236)\n\nWhile it is not the case that righteousness is benevolence by other means, this passage underlines how in different contexts, different virtues may push people toward participation in particular shared cultural practices constitutive of the good life.\n\nWhile the virtues of benevolence and righteousness might impel a gentleman to adhere to ritual norms in particular situations or areas of life, a third virtue of \u201critual propriety\u201d expresses a sensitivity to one\u2019s social place, and willingness to play all of one\u2019s multiple ritual roles. The term li translated here as \u201critual propriety\u201d has a particularly wide range of connotations, and additionally connotes both the conventions of ritual and etiquette. In the Analects, Confucius is depicted both teaching and conducting the rites in the manner that he believed they were conducted in antiquity. Detailed restrictions such as \u201cthe gentleman avoids wearing garments with red-black trim\u201d (10.6), which the poet Ezra Pound disparaged as \u201cverses re: length of the night-gown and the predilection for ginger\u201d (Pound 1951: 191), were by no means trivial to Confucius. His imperative, \u201cDo not look or listen, speak or move, unless it is in accordance with the rites\u201d (12.1), in answer to a question about benevolence, illustrates how the symbolic conventions of the ritual system played a role in the cultivation of the virtues. We have seen how ritual shapes values by restricting desires, thereby allowing reflection and the cultivation of moral dispositions. Yet without the proper affective state, a person is not properly performing ritual. In the Analects, Confucius says he cannot tolerate \u201critual without reverence, or mourning without grief,\u201d (3.26). When asked about the root of ritual propriety, he says that in funerals, the mourners\u2019 distress is more important than the formalities (3.4). Knowing the details of ritual protocols is important, but is not a substitute for sincere affect in performing them. Together, they are necessary conditions for the gentleman\u2019s training, and are also essential to understanding the social context in which Confucius taught his disciples.\n\nThe mastery that \u201critual propriety\u201d signaled was part of a curriculum associated with the training of rulers and officials, and proper ritual performance at court could also serve as a kind of political legitimation. Confucius summarized the different prongs of the education in ritual and music involved in the training of his followers:\n\nRaise yourself up with the Classic of Odes. Establish yourself with ritual. Complete yourself with music. (8.8)\n\nOn one occasion, Boyu \u4f2f\u9b5a, the son of Confucius, explained that when he asked his father to teach him, his father told him to study the Classic of Odes in order to have a means to speak with others, and to study ritual to establish himself (16.13). That Confucius insists that his son master classical literature and practices underscores the values of these cultural products as a means of transmitting the way from one generation to the next. He tells his disciples that the study of the Classic of Odes prepares them for different aspects of life, providing them with a capacity to:\n\nat home serve one\u2019s father, away from it serve one\u2019s lord, as well as increase one's knowledge of the names of birds, animals, plants and trees. (17.9)\n\nThis valuation of knowledge of both the cultural and natural worlds is one reason why the figure of Confucius has traditionally been identified with schooling, and why today his birthday is celebrated as \u201cTeacher\u2019s Day\u201d in some parts of Asia. In the ancient world, this kind of education also qualified Confucius and his disciples for employment on estates and at courts.\n\nThe fourth virtue, wisdom, is related to appraising people and situations. In the Analects, wisdom allows a gentleman to discern crooked and straight behavior in others (12.22), and discriminate between those who may be reformed and those who may not (15.8). In the former dialogue, Confucius explains the virtue of wisdom as \u201cknowing others\u201d. The \u201cThicket of Sayings\u201d excavated at Guodian indicates that this knowledge is the basis for properly \u201cselecting\u201d others, defining wisdom as the virtue that is the basis for selection. But it is also about appraising situations correctly, as suggested by the master\u2019s rhetorical question: \u201cHow can a person be considered wise if that person does not dwell in benevolence?\u201d (4.1). One well-known passage often cited to imply Confucius is agnostic about the world of the spirits is more literally about how wisdom allows an outsider to present himself in a way appropriate to the people on whose behalf he is working:\n\nWhen working for what is right for the common people, to show reverence for the ghosts and spirits while maintaining one\u2019s distance may be deemed wisdom. (6.22)\n\nThe context for this sort of appraisal is usually official service, and wisdom is often attributed to valued ministers or advisors to sage rulers.\n\nIn certain dialogues, wisdom also connotes a moral discernment that allows the gentleman to be confident of the appropriateness of good actions. In the Analects, Confucius tells his disciple Zi Lu \u5b50\u8def that wisdom recognizes knowing a thing as knowing it, and ignorance of a thing as ignorance of it (2.17). In soliloquies about several virtues, Confucius describes a wise person as never confused (9.28, 14.28). While comparative philosophers have noted that Chinese thought has nothing clearly analogous to the role of the will in pre-modern European philosophy, the moral discernment that is part of wisdom does provide actors with confidence that the moral actions they have taken are correct.\n\nThe virtue of trustworthiness qualifies a gentleman to give advice to a ruler, and a ruler or official to manage others. In the Analects, Confucius explains it succinctly: \u201cif one is trustworthy, others will give one responsibilities\u201d (17.6, cf. 20.1). While trustworthiness may be rooted in the proper expression of friendship between those of the same status (1.4, 5.26), it is also valuable in interactions with those of different status. The disciple Zi Xia \u5b50\u590f explains its effect on superiors and subordinates: when advising a ruler, without trustworthiness, the ruler will think a gentleman is engaged in slander, and when administering a state, without trustworthiness, people will think a gentleman is exploiting them (19.10). The implication is that a sincerely public-minded official would be ineffective without the trust that this quality inspires. In a dialogue with a ruler from chapter four of Han\u2019s Intertextual Commentary the Odes, Confucius explains that in employing someone, trustworthiness is superior to strength, ability to flatter, or eloquence. Being able to rely on someone is so important to Confucius that, when asked about good government, he explained that trustworthiness was superior to either food or weapons, concluding: \u201cIf the people do not find the ruler trustworthy, the state will not stand\u201d (12.7).\n\nBy the Han period, benevolence, righteousness, ritual propriety, wisdom and trustworthiness began to be considered as a complete set of human virtues, corresponding with other quintets of phenomena used to describe the natural world. Some texts described a level of moral perfection, as with the sages of antiquity, as unifying all these virtues. Prior to this, it is unclear whether the possession of a particular virtue entailed having all the others, although benevolence was sometimes used as a more general term for a combination of one or more of the other virtues (e.g., Analects 17.6). At other times, Confucius presented individual virtues as expressions of goodness in particular domains of life. Early Confucius dialogues are embedded in concrete situations, and so resist attempts to distill them into more abstract principles of morality. As a result, descriptions of the virtues are embedded in anecdotes about the exemplary individuals whose character traits the dialogues encourage their audience to develop. Confucius taught that the measure of a good action was whether it was an expression of the actor\u2019s virtue, something his lessons share with those of philosophies like Aristotle\u2019s that are generally described as \u201cvirtue ethics\u201d. A modern evaluation of the teachings of Confucius as a \u201cvirtue ethics\u201d is articulated in Bryan W. Van Norden\u2019s Virtue Ethics and Consequentialism in Early Chinese Philosophy, which pays particular attention to analogies between the way of Confucius and Aristotle\u2019s \u201cgood life\u201d. The nature of the available source materials about Confucius, however, means that the diverse texts from early China lack the systematization of a work like Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics.\n\nThe five virtues described above are not the only ones of which Confucius spoke. He discussed loyalty (zhong \u5fe0), which at one point is described as the minister\u2019s behavior toward a ritually proper ruler (3.19). He said that courage (yong \u52c7) is what compels one to act once one has seen where righteousness lies (2.24). Another term sometimes translated as \u201cvirtue\u201d (de \u5fb7), is usually used to describe the authority of a ruler that grows out of goodness or favor to others, and is a key term in many of the social and political works discussed in the following section. Yet going through a list of all the virtues in the early sources is not sufficient to describe the entirety of the moral universe associated with Confucius.\n\nThe presence of themes in the Analects like the ruler\u2019s exceptional influence as a moral exemplar, the importance of judging people by their deeds rather than their words (1.3, 2.10, 5.10), or even the protection of the culture of Zhou by higher powers (9.5), all highlight the unsystematic nature of the text and underscore that teaching others how to cultivate the virtues is a key aspect, but only a part, of the ethical ideal of Confucius. Yet there is also a conundrum inherent in any attempt to derive abstract moral rules from the mostly dialogical form of the Analects, that is, the problem of whether the situational context and conversation partner is integral to evaluating the statements of Confucius. A historically notable example of an attempt to find a generalized moral rule in the Analects is the reading of a pair of passages that use a formulation similar to that of the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d of the Christian Bible (Matthew 7:12 and Luke 6:31) to describe benevolence: \u201cDo not impose upon others those things that you yourself do not desire\u201d (12.2, cf. 5.12, 15.24). Read as axiomatic moral imperatives, these passages differ from the kind of exemplar-based and situational conversations about morality usually found in the Analects. For this reason, some scholars, including E. Bruce Brooks, believe these passages to be interpolations. While they are not wholly inconsistent with the way that benevolence is described in early texts, their interpretation as abstract principles has been influenced by their perceived similarity to the Biblical examples. In the Records of Ritual, a slightly different formulation of a rule about self and others is presented as not universal in its scope, but rather as descriptive of how the exemplary ruler influences the people. In common with other early texts, the Analects describes how the moral transformation of society relies on the positive example of the ruler, comparing the influence of the gentleman on the people to the way the wind blows on the grass, forcing it to bend (12.19). In a similar vein, after discussing how the personal qualities of rulers of the past determined whether or not their subjects could morally transform, the Records of Ritual expresses its principle of reflexivity:\n\nThat is why the gentleman only seeks things in others that he or she personally possesses. [The gentleman] only condemns things in others that he or she personally lacks. (\u201cDaxue\u201d \u5927\u5b78)\n\nThis is a point about the efficacy of moral suasion, saying that a ruler cannot expect to reform society solely by command since it is only the ruler\u2019s personal example that can transform others. For this reason, the ruler should not compel behaviors from his subjects to which he or she would not personally assent, something rather different from the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d. Historically, however, views that Confucius was inspired by the same Natural Theology as Christians, or that philosophers are naturally concerned with the generalization of moral imperatives, have argued in favor of a closer identification with the \u201cGolden Rule,\u201d a fact that illustrates the interpretative conundrum arising from the formal aspects of the Analects.\n\n5. The Family and the State\n\nEarly Zhou political philosophy as represented in the Classic of Odes and the Classic of Documents centered on moral justification for political authority based on the doctrine of the \u201cMandate of Heaven\u201d (tianming \u5929\u547d). This view was that the sage\u2019s virtue (de) attracted the attention of the anthropomorphized cosmic power usually translated as \u201cHeaven\u201d (tian \u5929), which supported the sage\u2019s rise to political authority. These canonical texts argued that political success or failure is a function of moral quality, evidenced by actions such as proper ritual performance, on the part of the ruler. Confucius drew on these classics and adapted the classical view of moral authority in important ways, connecting it to a normative picture of society. Positing a parallel between the nature of reciprocal responsibilities of individuals in different roles in two domains of social organization, in the Analects Confucius linked filial piety in the family to loyalty in the political realm:\n\nIt is rare for a person who is filially pious to his parents and older siblings to be inclined to rebel against his superiors\u2026 Filial piety to parents and elder siblings may be considered the root of a person. (1.2)\n\nThis section examines Confucius\u2019s social and political philosophy, beginning with the central role of his analysis of the traditional norm of filial piety.\n\nJust as Confucius analyzed the psychology of ritual performance and related it to individual moral development, his discussion of filial piety was another example of the development and adaptation of a particular classical cultural pattern to a wider philosophical context and set of concerns. Originally limited to descriptions of sacrifice to ancestors in the context of hereditary kinship groups, a more extended meaning of \u201cfilial piety\u201d was used to describe the sage king Shun\u2019s \u821c (trad. r. 2256\u20132205 BCE) treatment of his living father in the Classic of Documents. Despite humble origins, Shun\u2019s filial piety was recognized as a quality that signaled he would be a suitable successor for the sage king Yao \u582f (trad. r. 2357\u20132256 BCE). Confucius in the Analects praised the ancient sage kings at great length, and the sage king Yu \u79b9 for his filial piety in the context of sacrifice (8.21). However, he used the term filial piety to mean both sacrificial mastery and behaving appropriately to one\u2019s parents. In a conversation with one of his disciples he explains that filial piety meant \u201cnot contesting\u201d, and that it entailed:\n\nwhile one\u2019s parents were alive, serving them in a ritually proper way, and after one\u2019s parents died, burying them and sacrificing to them in a ritually proper way. (2.5)\n\nIn rationalizing the moral content of legacies of the past like the three-year mourning period after the death of a parent, Confucius reasoned that for three years a filially pious child should not alter a parent\u2019s way (4.20, cf. 19.18), and explains the origin of length of the three-year mourning period to be the length of time that the parents had given their infant child support (17.21). This adaptation of filial piety to connote the proper way for a gentleman to behave both inside and outside the home was a generalization of a pattern of behavior that had once been specific to the family.\n\nIntellectual historian Chen Lai \u9648\u6765 has identified two sets of ideal traits that became hybridized in the late Warring States period. The first set of qualities describes the virtue of the ruler coming out of politically-oriented descriptions of figures like King Wen of Zhou, including uprightness (zhi \u76f4) and fortitude (gang \u525b). The second set of qualities is based on bonds specific to kinship groups, including filial piety and kindness (ci \u6148). As kinship groups were subordinated to larger political units, texts began to exhibit hybrid lists of ideal qualities that drew from both sets. Consequently, Confucius had to effectively integrate clan priorities and state priorities, a conciliation illustrated in Han\u2019s Intertextual Commentary the Odes by his insistence that filial piety is not simply deference to elders. When his disciple Zengzi \u66fe\u5b50 submitted to a severe beating from his father\u2019s staff in punishment for an offense, Confucius chastises Zengzi, saying that even the sage king Shun would not have submitted to a beating so severe. He goes on to explain that a child has a dual set of duties, to both a father and ruler, the former filial piety and the other loyalty. Therefore, protecting one\u2019s body is a duty to the ruler and a counterweight to a duty to submit to one\u2019s parent (8). In the Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing \u5b5d\u7d93), similar reasoning is applied to a redefinition of filial piety that rejects behaviors like such extreme submission because protecting one\u2019s body is a duty to one\u2019s parents. This sort of qualification suggests that as filial piety moved further outside its original family context, it had to be qualified to be integrated into a view that valorized multiple character traits.\n\nSince filial piety was based on a fundamental relationship defined within the family, one\u2019s family role and state role could conflict. A Classic of Documents text spells out the possible conflict between loyalty to a ruler and filial piety toward a father (\u201cCai Zhong zhi ming\u201d \u8521\u4ef2\u4e4b\u547d), a trade-off similar to a story in the Analects about a man named Zhi Gong \u76f4\u8eac (Upright Gong) who testified that his father stole a sheep. Although Confucius acknowledged that theft injures social order, he judged Upright Gong to have failed to be truly \u201cupright\u201d in a sense that balances the imperative to testify with special consideration for members of his kinship group:\n\nIn my circle, being upright differs from this. A father would conceal such a thing on behalf of his son, and a son would conceal it on behalf of his father. Uprightness is found in this. (13.18)\n\nIn this way, too, Confucius was adapting filial piety to a wider manifold of moral behaviors, honing his answer to the question of how a child balances responsibility to family and loyalty to the state. While these two traits may conflict with one and other, Sociologist Robert Bellah, in his study of Tokugawa and modern Japan, noted how the structural similarity between loyalty and filial piety led to their both being promoted by the state as interlinked ideals that located each person in dual networks of responsibility. Confucius was making this claim when he connected filial piety to the propensity to be loyal to superiors (1.2). Statements like \u201cfilial piety is the root of virtuous action\u201d from the Classic of Filial Piety connect loyalty and the kind of action that signals the personal virtue that justifies political authority, as in the historical precedent of the sage king Shun.\n\nOf the classical sources from which Confucius drew, two were particularly influential in discussions of political legitimation. The Classic of Odes consists of 305 Zhou period regulated lyrics (hence the several translations \u201csongs\u201d, \u201codes\u201d, or \u201cpoems\u201d) and became numbered as one of the Five Classics (Wujing) in the Han dynasty. Critical to a number of these lyrics is the celebration of King Wen of Zhou\u2019s overthrow of the Shang, which is an example of a virtuous person seizing the \u201cMandate of Heaven\u201d:\n\nThis King Wen of ours, his prudent heart was well-ordered. He shone in serving the High God, and thus enjoyed much good fortune. Unswerving in his virtue, he came to hold the domains all around. (\u201cDaming\u201d \u5927\u660e)\n\nThe Zhou political theory expressed in this passage is based on the idea of a limited moral universe that may not reward a virtuous person in isolation, but in which the High God (Shangdi \u4e0a\u5e1d, Di \u5e1d) or Heaven will intercede to replace a bad ruler with a person of exceptional virtue. The Classic of Documents is a collection that includes orations attributed to the sage rulers of the past and their ministers, and its arguments often concern moral authority with a focus on the methods and character of exemplary rulers of the past. The chapter \u201cAnnouncement of Kang\u201d (\u201cKanggao\u201d \u5eb7\u8aa5) is addressed to one of the sons of King Wen, and provides him with a guide for behaving as sage ruler as well as with methods that had been empirically proven successful by those rulers. When it comes to the mandate inherited from King Wen, the chapter insists that the mandate is not unchanging, and so as ruler the son must always be mindful of it when deciding how to act. Further, it is not always possible to understand Heaven, but the \u201cfeelings of the people are visible\u201d, and so the ruler must care for his subjects. The Zhou political view that Confucius inherited was based on supernatural intercession to place a person with personal virtue in charge of the state, but over time the emphasis shifted to the way that the effects of good government could be viewed as proof of a continuing moral justification for that placement.\n\nConfucius himself arguably served as a historical counterexample to the classical \u201cMandate of Heaven\u201d theory, calling into question the direct nature of the support given by Heaven to the person with virtue. The Han period Records of the Historian biography of Confucius described him as possessing all the personal qualities needed to govern well, but wandering from state to state because those qualities had not been recognized. When his favorite disciple died, the Analects records Confucius saying that \u201cHeaven has forsaken me!\u201d (11.9). Wang Chong\u2019s \u738b\u5145 (27\u2013c.97 CE) Balanced Discussions (Lunheng \u8ad6\u8861) uses the phrase \u201cuncrowned king\u201d (suwang \u7d20\u738b) to describe the tragic situation: \u201cConfucius did not rule as king, but his work as uncrowned king may be seen in the Spring and Autumn Annals\u201d (80). The view that through his writings Confucius could prepare the world for the government of a future sage king became a central part of Confucius lore that has colored the reception of his writings since, especially in works related to the Spring and Autumn Annals and its Gongyang Commentary. The biography of Confucius reinforced the tragic cosmological picture that personal virtue did not always guarantee success. Even when Heaven\u2019s support is cited in the Analects, it is not a matter of direct intercession, but expressed through personal virtue or cultural patterns: \u201cHeaven gave birth to the virtue in me, so what can Huan Tui \u6853\u9b4b do to me?\u201d (7.23, cf. 9.5). As Robert Eno has pointed out, the concept of Heaven also came to be increasingly naturalized in passages like \u201cwhat need does Heaven have to speak?\u201d (17.19). Changing views of the scope of Heaven\u2019s activity and the ways human beings may have knowledge of that activity fostered a change in the role of Heaven in political theory.\n\nMost often, in dialogues with the rulers of his time, references to Heaven were occasions for Confucius to encourage rulers to remain attentive to their personal moral development and treat their subjects fairly. In integrating the classical legacy of the \u201cMandate of Heaven\u201d that applied specifically to the ruler or \u201cSon of Heaven\u201d (tianzi \u5929\u5b50), with moral teachings that were directed to a wider audience, the nature of Heaven\u2019s intercession came to be understood differently. In the Analects and writings like those attributed to Mencius, descriptions of virtue were often adapted to contexts such as the conduct of lesser officials and the navigation of everyday life. Kwong-Loi Shun notes that in such contexts, the influence of Heaven remained as an explanation of both what happened outside of human control, like political success or lifespan, and of the source of the ethical ideal. In the Analects, the gentleman\u2019s awe of Heaven is combined with an awe of the words of the sages (16.8), and when Confucius explains the Zhou theory of the \u201cmandate of Heaven\u201d in the Elder Dai\u2019s Records of Ritual, he does so in order to explain how the signs of a well-ordered society demonstrate that the ruler\u2019s \u201cvirtue matches Heaven\u201d (\u201cShaojian\u201d \u5c11\u9592). Heaven is still ubiquitous in the responses of Confucius to questions from rulers, but the focus of the responses was not on Heaven\u2019s direct intercession but rather the ruler\u2019s demonstration of his personal moral qualities.\n\nIn this way, personal qualities of modesty, filial piety or respect for the elders were seen as proof of fitness to serve in an official capacity. Qualification to rule was demonstrated by proper behavior in the social roles defined by the \u201cfive relationships\u201d (wulun \u4e94\u502b), a formulation seen in the writings of Mencius that became a key feature of the interpretation of works associated with Confucius in the Han dynasty. The Western Han emperors were members of the Liu clan, and works like the Guliang Commentary (Guliang zhuan \u7a40\u6881\u50b3) to the Spring and Autumn Annals emphasized normative family behavior grounded in the five relationships, which were (here, adapted to include mothers and sisters): ruler and subject, parent and child, husband and wife, siblings, and friends. Writing with particular reference to the Classic of Filial Piety, Henry Rosemont and Roger Ames argue that prescribed social roles are a defining characteristic of the \u201cConfucian tradition\u201d, and that such roles were normative guides to appropriate conduct. They contrast this with the \u201cvirtue ethics\u201d approach they say requires rational calculation to determine moral conduct, while filial piety is simply a matter of meeting one\u2019s family obligations. Just as the five virtues were placed at the center of later theories of moral development, once social roles became systematized in this way, selected situational teachings of Confucius consistent with them could become the basis of more abstract, systematic moral theories. Yet this could not have happened without the adaptation of the abstract classical political theory of \u201cHeaven\u2019s mandate\u201d, a doctrine that originally supported the ruling clan, to argue that Heaven\u2019s influence was expressed through particular concrete expressions of individual virtue. As a result of this adaptation in writings associated with Confucius, the ruler\u2019s conduct of imperial rituals, performance of filial piety, or other demonstrations of personal virtue provided proof of moral fitness that legitimated his political authority. As with the rituals and the virtues, filial piety and the mandate of Heaven were transformed as they were integrated with the classics through the voices of Confucius and the rulers and disciples of his era.\n\nEarlier, the usage of \u201cConfucius\u201d as a metonym for Chinese traditional culture was introduced as a feature of the modern period. Yet the complexity of the philosophical views associated with Confucius\u2014encompassing ethical ideals developed out of a sophisticated view of the effects of ritual and music on the performer\u2019s psychology, robust descriptions of the attitudes of traditional exemplars across diverse life contexts, and the abstraction of normative behaviors in the family and state\u2014is due in part to the fact that this metonymic usage was to some degree already the case in the Han period. By that time, the teachings of Confucius had gone through several centuries of gestation, and dialogues and quotations fashioned at different points over that time circulated and mixed. Put slightly differently, Confucius read the traditional culture of the halcyon Zhou period in a particular way, but this reading was continuously reflected and refracted through different lenses during the Pre-Imperial period, prior to the results being fixed in diverse early Imperial period sources like the Analects, the Records of Ritual, and the Records of the Historian. What remains is the work of the hand of Confucius, but also of his \u201cschool\u201d, and even sometimes of his opponents during the centuries that his philosophy underwent elaboration and drift. This process of accretion and elaboration is not uncommon for pre-modern writings, and the resulting breadth and depth explains, at least in part, why the voice of Confucius retained primacy in pre-modern Chinese philosophical conversations as well as in many modern debates about the role of traditional East Asian culture."}, {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.787724/full", "page_content": "Filial piety is a Confucian concept derived from Chinese culture, which advocates a set of moral norms, values, and practices of respect and caring for one\u2019s parents. According to the dual-factor model of filial piety, reciprocal and authoritarian filial piety are two dimensions of filial piety. Reciprocal filial piety is concerned with sincere affection toward one\u2019s parent and a longstanding positive parent-child relationship, while authoritarian filial piety is about obedience to social obligations to one\u2019s parent, often by suppressing one\u2019s own wishes to conform the demands of the parent. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the moderating effect of culture on the relationships between filial piety and palliative care knowledge. The secondary aim is to investigate whether filial piety is a universal construct across Singaporean and Australian cultures. A total of 508 participants living in Singapore and Australia were surveyed between May and October 2020. The final sample comprised of 406 participants, with 224 Singaporeans and 182 Australians. There were 289 females (71.1%), 115 males (28.3%), and two unspecified gender (0.6%) in the sample, with an average age of 27.27 years (SD = 9.79, range = 18\u201373). Results indicated a significant effect of culture on authoritarian filial piety and palliative care knowledge. Singaporeans showed higher authoritarian filial piety and higher palliative care knowledge than Australians. However, no effect of culture was found on reciprocal filial piety. Overall, no significant correlation existed between palliative care knowledge and reciprocal filial piety and authoritarian filial piety. For Singaporeans, a weak negative correlation was found between palliative care knowledge and authoritarian filial piety. In contrast, Australians and Singaporeans indicated a positive, moderate correlation between reciprocal and authoritarian filial piety. Further, culture moderated the relationship between authoritarian filial piety and palliative care knowledge. High authoritarian filial piety was associated with increased palliative care knowledge among Australians, while high authoritarian filial piety was associated with decreased palliative care knowledge among Singaporeans. The results support the conceptualization of filial piety as a possible psychological universal construct. In addition, the results point out an important implication that public health programs should target the appropriate filial piety types to enhance palliative care knowledge among Singaporeans and Australians.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground\n\nAccording to World Health Organization [WHO] (2018), palliative care is person- and family-centered care that focuses on the improvement of the quality of life for both patients with a life-threatening illness and their families, through preventing and relieving suffering by the early identification, correct assessment, and treatment of pain and other physical, psychosocial, or spiritual problems. The need for palliative care is expanding due to the population aging and the growth in the prevalence of cancer and other chronic non-communicable diseases worldwide. Many people with life threatening illnesses hope for a good death with dignity (Cao et al., 2020), namely, dying with dignity that emphasizes on maintaining people\u2019s autonomy at the end of their life (Chochinov, 2006). The provision of high-quality palliative care is a way to improve the quality of death, and many countries have continuously made progress in improving affordable access to palliative care (The Economist Intelligence Unit [EIU], 2015), including Australia and Singapore. The 2015 Quality of Death Index (The Economist Intelligence Unit [EIU], 2015), which ranks palliative care worldwide, revealed that Australia and Singapore are at the top of the Index at positions two and 12, respectively. These two countries are coping with a rapidly aging population. Hence, providing high-quality palliative care to ensure that people have a good life right until the end of their lives has risen in the agenda for healthcare policymaking. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, Australia and Singapore have also considered palliative care as an essential component of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic and include palliative care in their COVID-19 resolution (Krishna et al., 2020; Australian Institute of Health and Welfare [AIHW], 2021).\n\nAlthough the 2015 Quality of Death Index indicates that both Australia and Singapore provide world-class palliative care services, palliative care services remain underutilized. For example, among 83,430 palliative care-related hospitalizations reported from public acute and private hospitals in Australia in 2018\u20132019, 57.3% opted and received palliative care, while 42.7% opted for and received other end-of-life care where the principal clinical strategy of care is not palliation (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare [AIHW], 2021). In Singapore, the utilization rate for in-patient palliative care was around 15% of all cancer deaths (which is the top cause of death in Singapore) in the financial year of 2009\u20132010 (Lien Centre for Palliative Care, 2011). These utilization rates suggest that palliative care utilization is not optimized and that more patients may be being cared for treatments than necessary.\n\nA recent systematic review on palliative care education (Li et al., 2021a) suggests that barriers to utilizing palliative care services include patients\u2019 and families\u2019 misunderstandings and lack of knowledge of palliative care; reluctance and fear to utilize palliative care; and ignorance and lack of awareness of resources in relation to palliative care. Programs that aim to improve palliative care knowledge are primarily targeted to healthcare professionals, followed by family caregivers. Community engagement in the improvement of palliative care knowledge is limited. The authors recommend that community engagement in improving palliative care knowledge will bolster the credibility of palliative care as a \u2018public health issue,\u2019 which will help develop stronger palliative care policy and boost palliative care utilization. The higher palliative care utilization rate in Australia compared to Singapore warrants a comparative investigation of palliative care knowledge in the two countries.\n\nOne of the goals of palliative care is to help patients and their families make medically important decisions (Rome et al., 2011). Family members play a vital role in the palliative care decision-making process. When the patient of palliative care is the parent, a filial obligation is an important factor in the patient\u2019s childrens\u2019 decision-making within the context in which children occupy two different roles\u2014being children and caregivers. Although filial piety is a Confucian concept derived from Chinese culture, filial piety is used to connote the concept of filial obligation in many Asian cultures with their own indigenous terms in the cultures such as in the three dominant cultures in Singapore: the Chinese, Indian and Malay.\n\nIn Chinese culture, filial piety has long been studied as a set of cultural and moral norms, values, and practices of respect and caring for one\u2019s parents. In the Chinese language, filial piety translates to Xiao. Ideographically, the Chinese character of Xiao is comprised of two other characters with the old on the top and the son at the bottom, written from the top to the bottom. This ideograph indicates the hierarchical structure of the family and the responsibility that the young is expected to support the old in the family (Ikels, 2004). Hence, filial piety in Chinese culture not only requires filial duties (e.g., material support and co-residence with aging parents) from the children to their (grand)parents but also obedience to (grand)parental demands (Ho, 1996; Yeh, 2003; Li et al., 2020b). This child-parent relationship places filial piety at the core of the Chinese familial ideology and moral worldview (Hwang, 1999; Yeh and Bedford, 2003; Bedford and Yeh, 2019; Li and He, 2019). Filial piety is thus a framework and the starting point of the discussion of aged care in Chinese culture (Li et al., 2010).\n\nIn Indian culture, the parent-child relationship in Hindu ideology is built upon the concept of filial devotion and love of Shravan Kumar, who fulfills all the desires and wishes of his parents (Rao et al., 2003). Akin to this is the notion of seva in Indian culture (Sharma and Kemp, 2012). Seva is the Indian word equivalent to the Chinese Xiao, which refers to \u201clong-term bonds of intergenerational reciprocity and affection, in which juniors provide care for their senior parents in old age and after death, as ancestors in return for all of the effort, expense and love their parents expended to producing raise them in infancy and childhood\u201d (Lamb, 2002, p. 304). Seva is central in the Indian parent-child relationship, requiring support and care from the child to the (grand)parent and the filial duties of a son for his parents (Tiwari and Pandey, 2013). Similar to Xiao in Chinese culture, a key dimension of seva is multi-generational co-residence (Sharma and Kemp, 2012), namely joint family (Tiwari and Pandey, 2013), reflecting interdependence and the collectivist nature of Indian culture. In the joint family, aging parents are more likely to be cared for by their adult children as opposed to formal support sources (Sharma and Kemp, 2012). In that regard, seva is a natural backdrop for the discussion of aged care in Indian culture.\n\nIn Malay culture, the indigenous term of filial piety is Ketaatan Kepada Ibu Bapa (Tan et al., 2019), meaning loyalty toward the parents. Scholars suggest that Ketaatan Kepada Ibu Bapa in Malaysia is close to their traditional Confucian origins and promotes accentuate obedience (Thomas, 1990). Research has found that Malay children internalize Ketaatan Kepada Ibu Bapa not only from their parents but also from mass media, and their relatives, friends, and teachers (Ismail et al., 2009). A study investigating filial responsibility among Malaysian university students found that the Malay students had slightly higher mean scores in filial responsibility than their Chinese and Indian counterparts (Tien et al., 2009).\n\nFrom a collective perspective, in addition to the cultural underpinnings of each of the ethnic groups, the Singapore government endorses Asian ideologies of family-based care for elders. The principles are popularly encouraged and promoted as virtues that bind society together. For example, \u201cFamily is the basic unit of society\u201d is one of the four norms in the Shared Values White Paper of 1991 (Prime Minister\u2019s Office, 1991). Hence, the importance of filial duties is ingrained in Singapore society.\n\nAlthough there is no corresponding concept of filial piety, there is a concept of filial obligation in Western culture. Filial obligations refer to children\u2019s special obligations toward their parents, particularly adult children toward their elderly and needy parents (Schinkel, 2012). Western filial obligations are built upon responsibility, respect, and care that reflect the appreciation for past parental sacrifices, the special nature of the parent-child relationship, and the moral responsibilities to the elderly (Jones et al., 2021). Thus, even if the centrality of family relationships in the Western culture is the husband-wife relationship and not the parent-children relationship as in Chinese culture (Li, 2013), Western adult children fulfill their filial obligations to their parents by offering material support to, and even co-reside with, their parents. With the aging-in-place policy that promotes the practice where older people continue to live in their own homes as long as possible (Li, 2013), many Western countries have shifted from institutional care to formal or informal homecare (Schinkel, 2012). The success of the aging-in-place approach increasingly relies on filial obligations in aged care in Western culture. In Australia, the family is regarded as a palliative home care unit (Kirby et al., 2018). Family caregivers provide major assistance with palliative care provision in the home, including symptom evaluation and management, administration of medication, and hygiene and daily care (Hudson et al., 2011). This palliative home care for the elderly is often provided by the patient\u2019s adult children who fulfill their filial obligations.\n\nIt is pertinent to point out that in liberal Western societies, caring for their young children is a parental obligation and morally and legally required, while the filial obligation to look after aged parents is voluntary and not morally required (Fan, 2006). In this regard, filial responsibility in Western cultures is fundamentally different from filial piety in the three dominant cultures in Singapore, where filial piety is deemed a moral norm and ideology. An empirical investigation into differences in filial obligation (or filial piety) between Singaporean and Australian cultures is warranted.\n\nMoreover, considering the role that filial obligation plays when children are involved in making decisions on palliative care for their parents who suffer life-threatening illness, and that palliative care knowledge is a barrier for the utilization of palliative care services, it is worth exploring to what extent filial piety is related to palliative care knowledge. As suggested by Li (2013), a filial child is expected to serve his/her parent with medicine on the parent\u2019s deathbed. Consequently, not providing the seriously sick parent with curative treatment is regarded as a failure of fulfilling the moral duty of an adult child. Sending the sick parent to palliative care is viewed as an abandonment of the ill parent and socially unaccepted. Filial piety thus may be an underlying reason that prevents Singaporeans from obtaining palliative care knowledge and utilizing hospice and palliative care services. Contrary to Singaporean culture, Australians may believe that providing an ill parent with palliative care is their filial obligation which can improve the quality of life and offer a good death at the very end. This consideration may motivate Australians to obtain palliative care knowledge and utilize palliative care services. Therefore, the cultural background may impact the relationship between filial piety and palliative care knowledge, which warrants an empirical investigation. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, there are no studies investigating the relationship between filial piety and palliative care knowledge or if this relationship is moderated by culture.\n\nBased on the phenomenon that the manifestation of filial piety may differ by culture but filial piety-based interaction between children and parents exists in all cultures, recent research into the psychology of filial piety proposes that filial piety can be studied as a contextualized personality construct that functions as a universal human motivation with cross-cultural generalizability (Bedford and Yeh, 2019). As such, the overlap among Chinese Xiao, Indian seva, Malaysian Ketaatan Kepada Ibu Bapa and Western filial obligations and their shared implications for aged care offer a cross-cultural foundation for the new research trend that investigates if filial piety can be re-conceptualized as a universal construct across cultures. This re-conceptualization of filial piety marks a departure of the psychology of filial piety from solely focusing on Chinese culture-specific norms.\n\nBedford and Yeh (2019) proposed that filial piety can be studied as a contextualized personality construct based on their dual filial piety model. The dual-factor model of filial piety theorizes that filial piety is comprised of two dimensions: reciprocity and authoritarianism (Yeh, 2003; Yeh and Bedford, 2003). Reciprocal filial piety refers to sincere affection toward one\u2019s parent, which has grown from a longstanding positive parent-child relationship. Individuals with attitudes of reciprocal filial piety care about their parents out of sincerity and gratitude. Authoritarian filial piety is concerned with obedience to social obligations to one\u2019s parent, often by suppressing one\u2019s own wishes to conform to the demands of the parent (Yeh, 2009; Bedford and Yeh, 2019). Reciprocal filial piety is driven by the relational need for social connections, whereas authoritarian filial piety is stimulated by the psychological need for collective identities (Hwang, 1999; Chen et al., 2016). Reciprocal and authoritarian filial piety does not mutually exclude one another. Instead, they are intertwined and function simultaneously in different degrees, depending on the situation. For example, they may function together to achieve the same outcome because they both endorse intergenerational support. The intergenerational support by reciprocal filial piety is offered through accumulated affection. In contrast, the intergenerational support by authoritarian filial piety is achieved via regulating behavior so as to meet the minimum social expectations for adult children supporting their parents (Bedford and Yeh, 2019). The dual dimensions of filial piety reflect the notion of contextualized personality which purports that personality manifests in different ways (e.g., through accumulated affection or regulating behavior) across various social roles and contexts where people inhabit throughout their lives (Dunlop, 2015).\n\nContextualized personality refers to a stable set of tendencies and characteristics of thought, feelings, and behaviors that repeatedly appear within a given context (Heller et al., 2007). The primary idea behind this concept is that while personality characteristics are inclined to be stable within a specific context, they may differ considerably across different social roles and contexts because of psychological prompts or demands that are unique to certain contexts (Dunlop, 2015; Fisher et al., 2017). As such, personality characteristics are manifested within the recurring social roles and contexts (Dunlop and Hanley, 2019). Consequently, a person may display a certain personality characteristic within one context and a completely opposite characteristic within another context, dependent on varying contextual circumstances that bring about different response tendencies (Fisher et al., 2017). For example, when children experience the decision-making process of whether to utilize palliative care services for their seriously sick parent, the role-identities of children and caregivers that are both relevant to the decision are activated in cognition. However, at a certain moment, only one subset of these role-identities is more accessible. The activated and accessible role-identity and its related personality characteristics of filial piety, in turn, are likely to influence their decision making (Heller et al., 2009) and motivate them to utilize or to avoid palliative care services. The contextualized personality to filial piety moves filial piety research beyond the focus on cultural and social norms to the generalizability of filial piety across cultures. This novel conceptualization warrants an empirical investigation on whether filial piety is a universal construct in cultural contexts outside Chinese culture.\n\nThe Present Study\n\nThe primary aim of the present study is to investigate the moderating effect of culture on the relationships between filial piety and palliative care knowledge in a sample consisting of Singaporeans and Australians. The secondary aim is to assess whether filial piety is a universal construct across Singaporean and Australian cultures. Due to the exploratory nature of the current study, research questions, rather than priori hypotheses, are proposed. To achieve the primary research aim, four research questions are investigated, with Figure 1 presenting the conceptual model that shows the moderation pathway:\n\nFIGURE 1\n\nFigure 1. Conceptual model of the mediation analyses.\n\nRQ1. Are there differences in reciprocal and authoritarian filial piety between Singaporean and Australian cultures?\n\nRQ2. Are there differences in palliative care knowledge in Singaporean and Australian cultures?\n\nRQ3. Are reciprocal and/or authoritarian filial piety correlated to palliative care knowledge?\n\nRQ4. Does culture moderate the relationship between filial piety and palliative care knowledge?\n\nThe secondary research aim is not directly tested. Rather, this question will be answered by the results of the relationships between filial piety and palliative care knowledge across the two cultural groups. According to Norenzayan and Heine (2005), there are three categories of psychological universals\u2014the accessibility universal, functional universal, and existential universal. A three-step approach can be employed to identify if a psychological construct is universal. The first step is to examine if the construct is an accessibility universal. A construct is an accessibility universal if it is cognitively available to most people in most cultures, it has the same use in all cultures, and it is accessible to the same degree across cultures. When a psychological construct shows cultural variability in accessibility, the second step is to assess whether it is a functional universal. A psychological construct is a functional universal if the pattern of the relationship between the construct and other variables (e.g., palliative care knowledge in the present study) is the same across the cultures being studied, even though the strength of the pattern differs. When a psychological phenomenon demonstrates cultural variability in the functional dimension, the third step is to identify if it is an existential universal. A psychological construct is an existential universal if it is cognitively available to normal adults across cultures, even if the ways or frequency of using the construct may vary distinctly across the cultures. The current study follows this approach to examine whether filial piety is a universal psychological construct that can be generalized in Singaporean and Australian cultures.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nParticipants\n\nA total of 508 participants took part in the survey. They were categorized according to their country of residence: Singapore or Australia. Participants who lived outside Singapore and Australia (N = 45) were removed. To minimize intra-group variation, non-Asians in the Singapore sample (N = 9) and Asians in the Australian sample (N = 14) were removed. Further data cleaning (see the section \u201cData Cleaning\u201d) resulted in a final N of 406 with an age range of 18\u201373 years (M = 27.27, SD = 9.79). The overall sample consisted of 224 Singaporeans (M age = 26.72, SD = 7.8) and 182 Australians (M age = 27.94, SD = 11.77). The demographic characteristics of the final sample are reported in Table 1.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nTable 1. Demographic characteristics of the participants.\n\nMeasures\n\nDemographic Variables\n\nSeveral demographic variables were measured including age, gender, country of residence, highest level of education, marital status, occupation, and income.\n\nFilial Piety\n\nFilial piety was measured by the standardized dual filial piety scale (Yeh and Bedford, 2003). The 16-item scale produces totals for reciprocal and authoritarian filial piety (eight items for each subscale) using a 6-point scale in which 1 = \u201cExtremely unimportant\u201d and 6 = \u201cExtremely important.\u201d Sample items for reciprocal filial piety include \u201cBe concerned about my parents\u2019 health\u201d and \u201cSupport my parents\u2019 livelihood to make their lives more comfortable.\u201d Sample items for authoritarian filial piety include \u201cHave at least one son for the succession of the family name\u201d and \u201cGive up my aspirations to meet my parents\u2019 expectations.\u201d Higher scores indicate greater reciprocal and authoritarian filial piety. The scale has previously demonstrated good internal consistency with Cronbach\u2019s alphas of0.92 and0.86 for reciprocal filial piety and authoritarian filial piety, respectively (Li et al., 2021b). In this study, Cronbach\u2019s alphas for reciprocal filial piety and authoritarian filial piety were0.86 and0.82, respectively. The reliability analyses of the scale in the current study are presented in the section \u201cReliability Analysis\u201d after measurement invariance was tested.\n\nPalliative Care Knowledge\n\nPalliative care knowledge was assessed using the palliative care knowledge scale (Kozlov et al., 2017). This is a self-report questionnaire with 13 dichotomous questions (true = 1, false = 0) about various domains of palliative care knowledge. Six reverse items were re-coded. Higher scores indicate higher levels of palliative care knowledge. Example items for the scale include, \u201cA goal of palliative care is to address any psychological issues brought up by serious illness\u201d and \u201cPalliative care helps the whole family cope with a serious illness.\u201d The scale has fair reliability with the Kuder-Richardson 20 coefficient (KR-20) of0.71 by the scale author (Kozlov, 2016). The reliability analysis of the scale in the current study is presented in the section \u201cReliability Analysis\u201d.\n\nProcedure\n\nEthical clearance for the study was granted by the Human Research Ethics Committee James Cook University, Australia (Ref. H8021). Research posters carrying the link of the survey was circulated via the University\u2019s research sites (Sona Systems\u00ae) and social media platforms (e. g., Facebook). Interested participants would respond to the link, which directed them to the Qualtrics survey site. After reading the preliminary information about the survey, they had an option to proceed or exit the study. Psychology undergraduate participants of James Cook University received course credits for their research participation. This online cross-sectional survey was administrated between May and October 2020. The survey took about 20 minutes to complete.\n\nData Cleaning\n\nThirty-two incomplete surveys were removed. One participant was removed due to unengaged responding (i.e., answers to all questions were the highest possible value). Using boxplots, five extreme univariate outliers (four on palliative care knowledge and one on reciprocal filial piety), which scored three box lengths above or below the box boundary, were identified and winsorized to match the next highest/lowest non-outlying values. One multivariate outlier was detected using Mahalanobis distance figures (using a criterion \u03b1 = 0.001, df = 5 [equal to the number of variables], critical \u03c72 = 20.515; Tabachnick and Fidell, 2013, p.99) and removed, resulting in 406 participants for the final analysis.\n\nMissing data were minimal (0.2\u20130.8%) with 12 items missing one or two values across the three measures. Little\u2019s missing completely at random (MCAR) test were conducted. The results indicated that data were missing completely at random for the filial piety scale (\u03c72 = 100.79, df = 90, p = 0.21) and palliative care knowledge (\u03c72 = 64.62, df = 48, p = 0.06). Expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, an approach to maximum-likelihood based missing data method (Dong and Peng, 2013), was used to replaced missing data. Maximum likelihood estimation and EM were chosen in the consideration that, firstly, maximum likelihood estimation is consistent with its use in the multigroup confirmatory factor analysis employed in the measurement invariance test in the current study (see the section Test of Measurement Invariance of the Dual FilialPiety Scale); and secondly, EM estimation is an unbiased and efficient missing data replacement method when the missingness is ignorable (Dong and Peng, 2013). The ignorable missingness is indicated by the small size of missing data and MCAR (Graham, 2009). The missing data in the current study met the ignorability criteria.\n\nThe Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to assess the normality of the scales. All scales violated the assumption of normality (p < 0.001). Levene\u2019s test indicated that the palliative care knowledge scale violated the homogeneity assumption, p = 0.009. In addition, the transformations of variables failed to adequately adjust for the normal distribution using log and square root. Bootstrapping with 5,000 iterations was thus employed in the analysis (Field, 2017; Li et al., 2020a).\n\nData Analysis\n\nUsing G\u2217Power version 3.1.9.4 (Faul et al., 2007), a post hoc power analysis was performed to test whether to examine whether the sample size of 406 was adequate to conduct multiple linear regression. The analysis revealed a statistical power level of 0.99 with a medium effect size of 0.15, an alpha level of 0.05 and a predictor number of 4 (one independent variable, one moderator, and two covariates).\n\nTo determine the measurement equivalence across the two cultural groups, measurement invariance was tested using IBM SPSS Amos Graphics version 27. Measurement invariance test using multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA) involves a set of sequential models that are conducted in a logically ordered and increasingly restrictive fashion with a four-step process (Byrne, 2004; Byrne and Van de Vijver, 2010; Boer et al., 2018; Miller et al., 2019). First, a baseline model is established for testing configural invariance in which items show the same configuration loadings in each cultural group. Good model fit of each baseline model suggests that the item factor structure is similar across groups. Second, if configural invariance is satisfied, the metric invariance model in which factor loadings are constrained to be equal across cultural groups is tested against the configural model. Metric invariance is met if the model fit of the metric invariance model is not significantly different from the configural model. Third, if metric invariance is supported, the scalar invariance model where all factor loadings and item intercepts are constrained to be equal across groups is tested against the metric invariance model. Scalar invariance is assumed if the model fit of the scalar invariance model does not significantly differ from the metric invariance model. Fourth, if scalar invariance is demonstrated, the residuals/measurement errors invariance model where residuals/measurement errors are constrained to be equal across groups is tested against the scalar model. Residuals/measurement errors invariance is supported if the residuals/measurement errors invariance model is not statistically different from the scalar model (Byrne, 2004; Kline, 2016; Boer et al., 2018).\n\nTo examine model fit, chi-square goodness-of-fit statistics (\u03c72) and model fit indexes of Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), comparative fit index (CFI), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and the standardized root mean-square residual (SRMR) were used. If \u03c72 value is large and significant, the model is considered an inadequate fit. Considering that \u03c72 is highly dependent on sample size (Hu and Bentler, 1999), the ratio of \u03c72 to degrees of freedom (PCMIN/DF) is used to evaluate model fit. PCMIN/DF less than 3 is desired for a good model fit (Tabachnick and Fidell, 2013). TLI and CFI greater than0.95 is considered a good model fit (Hu and Bentler, 1999), and greater than0.90 are acceptable for adequate fits (Byrne, 2016; Kline, 2016). RMSEA less than0.05 indicates a good model fit (Hu and Bentler, 1999), and close to0.08 suggests an adequate model fit (Byrne, 2016; Kline, 2016). SRMR less than0.08 is considered a good model fit (Hu and Bentler, 1999), and less than0.10 indicates a mediocre fit (Byrne, 2016; Kline, 2016).\n\nData analysis for testing the research questions (RQ) was performed using IBM\u2019s SPSS version 27. An independent samples t-test was employed to determine whether there were differences in reciprocal and authoritarian filial piety, and palliative care knowledge between the two cultural groups (RQ1 and RQ2). To assess the size and direction of the linear relationship between reciprocal filial piety, authoritarian filial piety, and palliative care knowledge in the overall sample, a bivariate Pearson\u2019s product-moment correlation coefficient (r) was conducted (RQ3). Model 1 of PROCESS v3.5.3 macro for SPSS was used for moderation analysis (consisting of variables culture, reciprocal/authoritarian filial piety, and the interaction effect between culture and reciprocal/authoritarian filial piety; RQ4) with 5000 resamples to bootstrap 95% confidence intervals (Hayes, 2018; Li and Xie, 2020; Xie et al., 2021).\n\nTo control the covariates in the moderation models, independent samples of t-test and chi-square test were performed to determine which demographic factors of gender, age, education, marital status, employment, and annual income had statistical differences in all variables under investigation. T-test indicated that the cultures did not differ in terms of age, t(404) = \u22121.25, p = 0.21, with the Singaporean participants (M = 26.72, SD = 7.80) being slightly younger than the Australian participants (M = 27.94, SD = 11.76). The chi-square tests showed that the two cultures significantly differed in terms of highest level of education, \u03c72(2, N = 406) = 13.66, p < 0.001, Cramer\u2019s V = 0.18 and marital status, \u03c72 (2, N = 404) = 35.03, p < 0.001, Cramer\u2019s V = 0.29. However, the two cultures did not significantly differ on gender, \u03c72(2, N = 406) = 3.23, p = 0.85, Cramer\u2019s V = 0.03; employment, \u03c72(8, N = 387) = 11.63, p = 0.16, Cramer\u2019s V = 0.17; and annual income, \u03c72(4, N = 404) = 7.04, p = 0.13, Cramer\u2019s V = 0.13. Consequently, education and marital status were entered into the model as covariates.\n\nResults\n\nPreliminary Analysis\n\nTest of Measurement Invariance of the Dual Filial Piety Scale\n\nThe first step was to establish the baseline model, based on which the configural model was tested. The baseline model was established by using confirmatory factor analysis for evidence of model fit of the 16-item filial piety scale and tested separately in Singaporean and Australian participants. The hypothesized model for the Singaporean participants generated an adequate model according to the fit indices: \u03c72(103) = 233.853, p < 0.001, PCMIN/DF = 2.270, CFI = 0.907, TLI = 0.891, RMSEA = 0.075, 90% CI [0.071, 0.088], SRMR = 0.087; while the hypothesized model for the Australian participants was found to be of poor fit: \u03c72(103) = 251.390, p < 0.001, PCMIN/DF = 2.441, CFI = 0.851, TLI = 0.826, RMSEA = 0.089, 90% CI [0.075, 0.103], SRMR = 0.095. Inspection of the modification indices showed moderate values of error covariances between items 1 and 5 (MI = 18.971, PCS = 0.115) and between items 4 and 16 (MI = 19.107, PCS = 0.214). Scrutiny of the content for each of these items revealed evidence of considerable overlap (e.g., using similar wordings and/or meaning of the items appearing similar to each other) between each of these item pairs; for example, \u201cBe concerned about my parents\u2019 health\u201d (item 1) vs. \u201cBe concerned about my parents\u2019 general well-being\u201d (item 5) and \u201cLet my income be handled by my parents before marriage\u201d (Item 4) vs. \u201cLive with my parents (or parents-in-law) when married\u201d (Item 16). The overlap of these items can trigger error covariances (Byrne, 2004). Considering this applicable modification, these error terms of items 1 and 5 and of items 4 and 16 were subsequently covaried as free parameters in the model for each group (Byrne and Van de Vijver, 2010; Kline, 2016). The modified Australian baseline model generated an acceptable model: \u03c72(101) = 208.383, p < 0.001, PCMIN/DF = 2.063, CFI = 0.892, TLI = 0.868, RMSEA = 0.077, 90% CI [0.062, 0.092], SRMR = 0.089. The modified Singaporean baseline model resulted in better model fits: \u03c72(101) = 222.595, p < 0.001, PCMIN/DF = 2.270, CFI = 0.913, TLI = 0.897, RMSEA = 0.073, 90% CI [0.060, 0.087], SRMR = 0.086.\n\nFollowing the establishment of the modified baseline model, the configural model (model 1) in which the basic factors of the baseline model were constrained to equality across the two cultural groups was tested. In this model, the same parameters that had been estimated in the modified baseline model for each group separately were estimated simultaneously using the multigroup modeling (Byrne, 2016). The model fit indices reported acceptable model fit: \u03c72(202) = 430.978, p < 0.001, PCMIN/DF = 2.134, CFI = 0.905, TLI = 0.887, RMSEA = 0.053, 90% CI [0.046, 0.060], SRMR = 0.086, supporting that the overall pattern of parameters was equal across the Singapore and Australia groups, namely, the configural invariance was supported.\n\nSecond, the metric invariance was tested. The model (Model 2), where all factor loadings and two error covariances (Items 1 and 5; Items 4 and 16) (Byrne, 2016) were constrained to be equal across the Singaporean and Australian groups, was tested against the configural model. The results showed adequate model fits: \u03c72(216) = 460.383, p < 0.001, PCMIN/DF = 2.131, CFI = 0.898, TLI = 0.887, RMSEA = 0.053, 90% CI [0.044, 0.052], SRMR = 0.088. The comparison between Model 1 and Model 2 yielded the following values: \u0394\u03c72(14) = 29.405, p < 0.05 and \u0394CFI = 0.007. Not surprisingly, the \u03c72 difference test showed the evidence of non-invariance due to two error covariances being added to the model (Byrne, 2016). The CFI difference test indicated invariance because the \u0394CFI value of 0.007 was less than the 0.010 cut-off point recommended by Cheung and Rensvold (2002). Considering that \u0394\u03c72 is sensitive to the sample size (Cheung and Rensvold, 2002; Meade et al., 2008) and characterizes exact measurement invariance while the tested models at the best is only approximate invariance (Byrne, 2016), Meade et al. (2008) suggested that if \u0394CFI argues for invariance and the sample size is greater than 200 (which is the case of the present study), although \u0394\u03c72 is significant, the differences of the measurement between groups are possibly insignificant and further analyses could progress. Hence, metric invariance across the Singaporean and Australian groups was established.\n\nThird, the scalar invariance (Model 3), in which all factor loadings, two error covariances and item intercepts were constrained equal across two groups (Byrne, 2004), was tested against the metric invariance model. Results showed poor model fits: \u03c72(230) = 690.069, p < 0.001, PCMIN/DF = 2.957, CFI = 0.809, TLI = 0.803, RMSEA = 0.070, 90% CI [0.064, 0.076], SRMR = 0.090. The comparison between Model 2 and Model 3 produced the following values: \u0394\u03c72(14) = 229.686, p < 0.001 and \u0394CFI = 0.089. The results from \u0394\u03c72 and \u0394CFI (>0.010) indicated that full scalar invariance was not supported. To test partial scalar invariance, the intercept restriction for items 2, 3, 9, 10, 14, and 16 were released based on the intercept differences between the two cultural groups in the modification indices. The modified model (partial scalar invariance model; Model 3b) demonstrated an improvement of model fit: \u03c72(224) = 477.849, p < 0.001, PCMIN/DF = 2.133, CFI = 0.894, TLI = 0.887, RMSEA = 0.053, 90% CI [0.047, 0.060], SRMR = 0.090. The comparison between Model 2 and Model 3b indicated support to partial scalar invariance with \u0394CFI = 0.004, suggesting that item intercepts were partially equivalent across the two cultural groups. The fit indices are summarized in Table 2. As a result of the rejection of full scalar invariance, the fourth step of testing the residuals/measurement errors invariance was not proceeded.\n\nTABLE 2\n\nTable 2. Fit indices for the filial piety scale models.\n\nReliability Analysis\n\nThe intercorrelations, descriptives, and reliability coefficients of reciprocal filial piety, authoritarian filial piety, and palliative care knowledge in overall Singapore and Australia Samples are presented in Table 3. Both reciprocal and authoritarian filial piety scales demonstrated good reliability with alpha coefficients between0.82 and0.89 in the overall Singaporean and Australian samples. The KR-20s of the scale were between0.61 and0.69. According to Norman and Streiner (2008), a reliability coefficient above0.60 is acceptable for a health knowledge scale. The resulting scales thus showed acceptable levels of internal consistency.\n\nTABLE 3\n\nTable 3. Intercorrelations, descriptives, and reliability coefficients of reciprocal filial piety, authoritarian filial piety, and palliative care knowledge in the overall, Singapore, and Australia samples.\n\nTest of Research Questions\n\nTest of Research Question 1\n\nThe independent samples t-test indicated no statistically significant effect of culture on reciprocal filial piety (p = 0.56). However, the effect of culture on authoritarian filial piety was statistically significant, t(404) = 3.67, p < 0.001, two-tailed, d = 0.37. Authoritarian filial piety was significantly higher in Singaporeans (M = 21.56, SD = 5.86) as compared to Australians (M = 19.39, SD = 6.03). Taken together, findings provided partial affirmation for RQ1.\n\nTests of Research Question 2\n\nThe independent samples t-test showed that the effect of culture on palliative care knowledge was statistically significant t(404) = 3.14, p = 0.002, two-tailed, d = 0.31. Palliative care knowledge was significantly higher in Singapore (M = 11.56, SD = 1.70) as compared to Australia (M = 10.97, SD = 2.12). Findings indicated that RQ2 was affirmed.\n\nTest of Research Question 3\n\nThe bivariate Pearson\u2019s product-moment correlation coefficient (r) showed that there was no statistically significant bivariate correlation between palliative care knowledge and authoritarian filial piety (p = 0.34). However, a positive and weak bivariate correlation was found between palliative care knowledge and reciprocal filial piety, r = 0.11, p < 0.05; and a positive and moderate bivariate correlation found between reciprocal filial piety and authoritarian filial piety, r = 0.40, p < 0.001. Results showed no statistically significant bivariate correlation between palliative care knowledge and reciprocal filial piety (p = 0.24) in the Singapore sample. However, there was a negative and weak bivariate correlation found between palliative care knowledge and authoritarian filial piety, r = \u22120.24, p < 0.001; and a positive and moderate bivariate correlation found between reciprocal filial piety and authoritarian filial piety, r = 0.39, p < 0.001.\n\nIn the Australia sample, results showed no statistically significant bivariate correlation between palliative care knowledge and reciprocal filial piety (p = 0.06); and palliative care knowledge and authoritarian filial piety (p = 0.30). However, a positive and moderate bivariate correlation was found between reciprocal filial piety and authoritarian filial piety, r = 0.40, p < 0.001.\n\nThe intercorrelations and descriptive statistics of reciprocal filial piety, authoritarian filial piety, and palliative care knowledge in the overall Singapore, and Australia samples are summarized in Table 3. Taken together, findings provided partial affirmation for RQ3.\n\nTest of Research Question 4\n\nThe moderation analysis indicated that the interaction effect between culture and reciprocal filial piety was not found to significantly predict palliative care knowledge whilst controlling for education and marital status in the model, F(1, 398) = 0.98, p = 0.32, bias-corrected 95% CI [\u22120.040, 0.123]. Therefore, culture is not a significant moderator in reciprocal filial piety\u2019s effect on palliative care knowledge. Table 4 and Figures 2, 3 present the regression parameter estimates, statistical diagram, and a visual representation of the moderation model, respectively.\n\nTABLE 4\n\nTable 4.

The moderating effect of culture on the relationship between reciprocal filial piety and palliative care knowledge.\n\nThe moderation analysis suggested that the moderation model explained a statistically significant 6.2% of the variation in palliative care knowledge, F(1, 398) = 10.60, p < 0.01. Authoritarian filial piety was a significant negative predictor of palliative care knowledge whilst controlling for education and marital status in the model, b = \u22120.177, t(398) = \u22123.57, p < 0.001, bias-corrected 95% CI [\u22120.275, \u22120.080]. Culture was also a significant predictor of palliative care knowledge whilst controlling for education and marital status in the model, b = \u22122.80, t(398) = \u22124.03, p < 0.001, bias-corrected 95% CI [\u22124.165, \u22121.435]. Figures 4, 5 and Table 5 display the regression parameter estimates, statistical diagram, and visual representation of the moderation model, respectively. Hence, the analysis provided partial affirmation for RQ4.\n\nFIGURE 4\n\nFigure 4.

Summary of regression analysis examining the moderation effect of culture on the relationship between authoritarian filial piety and palliative care knowledge.\n\nDiscussion\n\nDifferences in Filial Piety Between the Singapore and Australia Samples\n\nThe analysis of RQ1 indicates no significant differences in the mean score of reciprocal filial piety between the two cultural groups. This finding is interesting, as it suggests that reciprocal filial piety is not only valued but also practiced in Singapore and Australia in a similar fashion. Evidently, the concept of reciprocal filial piety, although derived from Confucianism, underlies love and care for one\u2019s parents across the two cultures similarly. Ontologically, Confucianism regards a person\u2019s life as an extension of their parents\u2019 physical lives, and thus a person exists only because their parents give them their life. Consequently, the greatest gift a person receives from their parents is life itself (Sung, 1995; Li et al., 2021b). Therefore, their sincere support and grateful attitudes to their parents manifested in reciprocal filial piety. Although ontologically, the Christian view advocates a transcendent creator for human beings, reciprocal filial piety echoes the Western concept of social reciprocity that is a behavioral response to reciprocate the kindness received from other people (Falk and Fischbacher, 2006). In a positive parent-child relationship, the Western concept of reciprocity suggests a mutual exchange of supportive actions, materials, energy, time, and emotion between the parent and child, consistent with the reciprocal filial piety measured by the dual filial piety scale. As such, it is not surprising that there were no significant differences in reciprocal filial piety between the Singaporean and Australian participants.\n\nAuthoritarian filial piety is derived from the Confucian belief of absolute parental authority over the child and undisputed blind obedience to the parent (Lieber et al., 2004). This belief is reflective in the authoritarian filial piety subscale that includes question such as \u201cGive up my aspirations to meet my parents\u2019 expectations,\u201d \u201cTake my parents\u2019 suggestions even when I do not agree with them,\u201d and \u201cAvoid getting married to someone, my parents dislike.\u201d In contrast to this hierarchical parent-child relationship derived from Confucius\u2019 authoritarian father-son relationship (Hwang, 2001; Li et al., 2021c), Australians who live in a democratic society are likely to favor individual freedom, personal autonomy, and independence in the process of decision making (Stroup, 2007) over the authoritarian parent-child relationship. As a result, Australian participants in the current study scored significantly lower in authoritarian filial piety than their Singaporean counterparts.\n\nDifferences in Palliative Care Knowledge Between the Singapore and Australia Samples\n\nIn terms of RQ2, the Singaporean participants scored significantly higher in palliative care knowledge than their Australian counterparts. Australia was ranked at second place in the 2015 Quality of Death Index (The Economist Intelligence Unit [EIU], 2015), which was 10 places higher than Singapore. Australia also has a higher palliative care utilization rate compared to Singapore. It was thus expected that Australians would have higher levels of palliative care knowledge. According to the Singapore Department of Statistics (2021), Singapore\u2019s population is aging. The percentage of Singaporean citizen aged 65 years and above is projected to increase from 14.4 percent in 2017 to 19 percent in 2030 (Australian Trade and Investment Commission, 2021). The proportion of Australians aged 65 years and over is projected to grow from 15 percent in 2017 (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare [AIHW], 2018) to 16.6 percent in 2030 (Commonwealth of Australia, 2010). Hence, the Singapore population is projected to age faster than the Australian population. This demographic shift places additional pressure on Singaporeans to provide old-age support to the elderly, both financially and health-wise. To tackle the palliative care pressure, numerous community initiatives and research on death and dying in Singapore have been established to promote good death (Lien Centre for Palliative Care, 2011). The initiatives and studies strongly promote palliative care literacy and awareness regarding end-of-life care options. For example, according to the report entitled Leaving Well: End-of-Life Care Policies in Singapore, most Singaporeans want a \u201cgood death\u201d (Arivalagan and Gee, 2019). These initiatives may successfully promote palliative care as a public health issue. Consequently, Singaporeans develop higher levels of public awareness and knowledge of palliative care, which may contribute to the higher scores in palliative care knowledge more in Singaporean than Australian participants.\n\nThe Relationship Between Filial Piety and Palliative Care Knowledge\n\nThe findings of the present study provide partial affirmation for RQ3. Overall and in the Australian samples, both reciprocal and authoritarian filial piety was not associated with palliative care knowledge. In the Singaporean sample, authoritarian filial piety was negatively correlated with palliative care knowledge with small effect size, while reciprocal filial piety was not associated with palliative care knowledge.\n\nSeveral factors may explain the finding that filial piety (both reciprocal and authoritarian) did not correlate with palliative care knowledge. First, according to the contextualized personality theory (Heller et al., 2007; Dunlop, 2015; Dunlop and Hanley, 2019), different roles (e.g., an adult child and a caregiver) can activate different cognitive-affective mental representations and different associated meanings, people thus act differently in different roles (Fisher et al., 2017). For instance, as children, people sometimes become preoccupied with the fear of their parent\u2019s death. To overcome the fear, they may avoid anything related to the topic of death, including learning about palliative care. As caregivers, people may be motivated to learn more about palliative care as a result of the promotion of palliative care services (in both Singapore and Australia). However, at a given moment in time, only a subset of these two role-identities is cognitively activated and accessible (Heller et al., 2009). In the context of the current study, the child role identity may be activated and more accessible than the caregiver identity. The child role-identity may evoke participants\u2019 fear of their parents\u2019 death, and result in their avoidance behavior toward palliative care knowledge.\n\nSecond, the inconsistency between attitude and behavior may be a contributing factor. The filial piety scale measures people\u2019s attitudes toward their parents (Yeh and Bedford, 2003). Existing literature has suggested that if people behave in a certain way, they often have a positive attitude toward the behavior (Gilovich et al., 2019). No relationship between palliative care knowledge and filial piety is indicative that while positive filial affect exists toward taking care of parents among the participants, the participants may not have a positive attitude toward palliative care, which may hinder them from acquiring palliative care knowledge. For instance, palliative care may promote people to think about filial bereavement, which is likely to have a negative impact on people in the form of psychosomatic discomfort and emotional upset (Moss et al., 1997) and even undermine people\u2019s psychological functioning (Marks et al., 2007). Consequently, filial attitudes toward one\u2019s parent do not facilitate the participants\u2019 acquiring palliative care knowledge.\n\nThe third contributing factor may be the age of the participants. The average age of the overall sample was 27.27 years, which suggests that averagely the participants were born about 28 years ago in the early 1990s. In the early 1990s, Australian women most commonly had their first child in their early to mid-20s (Australian Institute of Family Studies, 2021). The information of the average age of Singaporean women having the first child in the early 1990s is not available, while the median age of Singaporean mothers at first birth was 28.6 years in 2000 (Strategy Group Singapore, 2021). These statistics suggest that the average age of the parents of the participants in the current study is likely to be under 60 years. Generally speaking, the parents of the participants with such a young age are less likely to need palliative care services. Thus, the participants with high filial piety scores may not be significantly more motivated to seek palliative care knowledge than their counterparts with low filial piety scores.\n\nThe finding that authoritarian filial piety was negatively associated with palliative care knowledge among the Singaporean participants suggested that authoritarian filial piety appears to prevent this group of people from acquiring palliative care knowledge. As discussed previously, authoritarian filial piety advocates compliance to social obligations to the parent (Yeh, 2009; Bedford and Yeh, 2019). Providing a seriously ill parent with palliative care\u2014indicating the cessation of life-prolonging treatment\u2014may result in the parents feeling abandoned by their children, which is not socially accepted. Therefore, the higher level of authoritarian filial piety often brings about a greater level of social compliance, which in turn may lead to a lower level of the acquisition of palliative care knowledge.\n\nModerating Effect of Culture on the Relationship Between Filial Piety and Palliative Care Knowledge\n\nThe results of the current study provide a partially affirmative test for RQ4. No interaction was found between culture and reciprocal filial piety in the moderation analysis. This finding suggests that the positive correlation patterns between reciprocal filial piety and palliative care knowledge were similar in the two cultural groups. In other words, the lack of interaction between culture and reciprocal filial piety variables in predicting palliative care knowledge indicates that the patterns of the relationship between reciprocal filial piety and palliative care knowledge were the same across the two cultural groups; that is, the higher levels of reciprocal filial piety, the higher levels of palliative care knowledge.\n\nCulture moderated the relationship between authoritarian filial piety and palliative care knowledge. High authoritarian filial piety was associated with increased palliative care knowledge among Australians, while high authoritarian filial piety was associated with decreased palliative care knowledge among Singaporeans. That is, the direction of association relations between authoritarian filial piety and the level of palliative care knowledge depends on culture.\n\nFilial Piety as a Universal Construct Across Singaporean and Australian Cultures\n\nTo achieve the secondary research aim of the present study\u2014examining whether filial piety is a universal construct across the two cultural groups\u2014it is critical to first test the measurement invariance of the dual filial piety scale. The data of the present study supported configural invariance, metric invariance (or weak invariance) and partial scalar invariance (or partial strong invariance) of the dual filial piety scale across the Singaporean and Australian groups. According to Kline (2016), configural invariance indicates that participants across two cultural groups conceptualize the construct of filial piety in the same way. The support of metric invariance suggests that filial piety is manifested in the same way across the two groups; specifically, the slopes of regressing the items on reciprocal and authoritarian filial piety are equal across groups. Partial scalar invariance demonstrates partial equality of intercepts, suggesting that Singaporean and Australian participants in the current study used the response scale (namely, the Likert scale) of 10 items (among the 16 items, the intercept restrictions of 6 items were freed) in the same way. In other words, a person from Singapore and a person from Australia with the same level of filial piety should obtain the same score of those 10 items. As a result of the achievement of measurement invariance, the critical assumption, in this cross-cultural comparative research that the filial piety scale measures the same constructs of reciprocal and authoritarian filial piety in the same way across the two cultural groups, is met (Byrne and Van de Vijver, 2010).\n\nAlthough the finding that reciprocal filial piety did not differ in the two cultural groups (see the section \u201cDifferences in Palliative Care Knowledge Between the Singapore and Australia Samples\u201d) suggests that reciprocal filial piety is cognitively available to the participants, the current study lacks evidence that reciprocal filial piety has the same use and is accessible to the same degree in the two cultures. Thus, it is difficult to claim that reciprocal filial piety is an accessibility universal (Norenzayan and Heine, 2005). The lack of interaction between culture and reciprocal filial piety in predicting palliative care knowledge shows that the patterns of the relationship between reciprocal filial piety and palliative care knowledge were the same, although the strength of the pattern differed in the two cultural groups (as shown in Figure 3). This finding suggests that reciprocal filial piety may be a functional universal (Norenzayan and Heine, 2005) shared by the Singaporean and Australian participants in the current study.\n\nThe finding that the mean scores of authoritarian filial piety were significantly different between the two cultural groups (see the section \u201cDifferences in Palliative Care Knowledge Between the Singapore and Australia Samples\u201d) indicates that authoritarian filial piety is differently accessible across cultures. Thus, authoritarian filial piety is not an accessibility universal (Norenzayan and Heine, 2005). As a result of the moderating effect of culture, the relationship between authoritarian filial piety and palliative care knowledge across the two cultures were in different directions (as shown in Figure 5), meaning that authoritarian filial piety fails the test of a functional universal due to the qualitatively distinct patterns emerging across the two cultures (Norenzayan and Heine, 2005). In other words, authoritarian filial piety is not a functional universal. Despite these cultural variations, the tests of measurement invariance and findings of RQs 1, 3, and 4 suggests that authoritarian filial piety not only cognitively exists in Singaporean but also in Australian cultures, albeit in significantly different degrees. As such, authoritarian filial piety appears to be an existential universal across the two cultures.\n\nIn summary, although reciprocal and authoritarian filial piety were at different levels of universals (e.g., functional and existential universals, respectively), empirical support is offered to the claim of generalizability of filial piety across Singaporean and Australian cultures within the context of the current study. It is pertinent to point out that the generalizability of filial piety is encouraging but not conclusive. More evidence needs to be sought from samples beyond the two cultures and variables in the current studies.\n\nLimitations and Future Directions\n\nThere are several limitations of this study that should be noted. First, Malay participants only consisted of 3.6% of the Singaporean sample. Considering that the Malay population is the second largest population group in Singapore, the generalization of the findings of this study needs to be exerted with caution due to the limitation in the relevant representative sample. Second, the current study is limited to two cultures. As pointed out by Boer et al. (2018), comparison using two cultures may lead to the interpretation paradox that differences between the two cultures which differ in terms of social, economic, and cultural factors can be easily detected, but the interpretation of the found differences and what factors explain those differences are hard to determine because the \u201ccultural differences\u201d may be caused by any other varying characteristics of the samples. This limitation warrants future studies that recruit participants from more cultures, particularly from China where filial piety originated. Third, given the theoretical emphasis on the ideological embeddedness of the concepts of Xiao, seva, and Ketaatan Kepada Ibu Bapa, this study would have been strengthened if the participants\u2019 adherence to Confucian, Hindu, Malay, or Christian beliefs, and the dimensions of spirituality emphasized by Buddhism and other religions, would have been included in the study. Fourth, it is notable that the reliability coefficient of the palliative care knowledge scale was under0.70. This may be caused by the binary format of the scale. The binary answers may result in the loss of information due to the reduction of response chance (Grassi et al., 2007), which may lead to the low levels of the reliability coefficient. Future research into performance comparison of binary and Likert formats is warranted. Fifth, although this paper discussed that age may be a contribution factor to the lack of association between filial piety and palliative care knowledge (see the section \u201cDifferences in Palliative Care Knowledge Between the Singapore and Australia Samples\u201d), the impact of age on this relationship did not test due to the research focus indicated in the RQs. Similarly, other sociodemographic factors were not included in the moderation models (while education and marital status were entered into the models as covariates). This limitation warrants future studies to extend the moderation models to include age and sociodemographic factors as moderators because these factors may a deeper and more plural understanding of the relationship between filial piety and palliative care knowledge. It is possible that for samples with ages and sociodemographic factors different from the current study, palliative care knowledge may not be relevant to assess filial piety as a functional universal. Sixth, the relationship between palliative care knowledge and palliative care utilization was not investigated in the current study. Although Li et al.\u2019s (2021a) systematic review concludes that the lack of palliative care knowledge contributes to low levels of palliative care utilization, the current study does not appear to support this conclusion. If the findings of the current study could be translated into Singapore\u2019s population, compared to Australia, the higher level of palliative care knowledge among Singaporean seemingly does not lead to a higher level of utilizing palliative care services. Future studies on the relationship between palliative care knowledge and palliative care utilization are needed.\n\nConclusion and Implications\n\nIn conclusion, the current study indicates that the mean scores of reciprocal filial piety did not differ, but authoritarian filial piety differed across the two cultures. The levels of palliative care knowledge among Singaporeans were significantly higher than Australians. Reciprocal filial piety was not associated with palliative care knowledge in the overall Singaporean and Australian samples. Authoritarian filial piety was not associated with palliative care knowledge in the overall and Australian samples but was negatively correlated with palliative care knowledge in the Singaporean sample. Culture did not moderate the relationship between reciprocal filial piety and palliative care knowledge but moderated the relationship between authoritarian filial piety and palliative care knowledge. Reciprocal and authoritarian filial piety appear to be a functional and an existential universal, respectively, across the two cultures.\n\nTo the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first study to provide empirical evidence that filial piety demonstrates generalizability across Singaporean and Australian cultures within the context of global aging. The findings have theoretical, empirical, and practical implications. Theoretically, the present findings support the notion that the conceptualization of filial piety can be moved beyond the traditional notion that regards filial piety as a cultural norm to an innovative point of view that considers filial piety as a possible psychological universal. This move is particularly welcome as an example of cross-cultural research originating from a non-Western cultural concept\u2014\u201cfilial piety.\u201d Cross-cultural research has been long conducted from the perspective of a Western concept with a tendency to construe divergences from the Western concept to conclude a cultural deviation or deficit in non-Western societies. Empirically, through the analysis of measurement invariance and the data, the current study validates the cross-cultural applicability of the dual filial piety model, which provides empirical support to the employment of filial piety as a contextualized personality construct in the future research on intergenerational relations in Western societies. The testing of measurement invariance also adds value to Norenzayan and Heine\u2019s (2005) three-step approach to probing universal constructs in cross-cultural research in that measurement invariance is largely overlooked in Norenzayan and Heine\u2019s approach. Practically, given that the present study finds that higher levels of authoritarian filial piety were associated with decreased palliative care knowledge among Singaporeans, public health palliative care in Singapore should consider addressing this relationship. Considering that higher levels of authoritarian filial piety were associated with increased palliative care knowledge in Australians, public health palliative care could utilize authoritarian filial piety to enhance palliative care knowledge among Australians. Integrating filial piety into the public health approach to palliative care may also benefit patients, caregivers, and healthcare provision in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nData Availability Statement\n\nThe datasets generated for this study can be found in Research Data JCU: https://doi.org/10.25903/5fdw-ne77.\n\nEthics Statement\n\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee James Cook University, Australia (Ref.

In this section, I explain the most relevant of his theoretical ideas.\n\nDiscourse (and Power)\n\nAccording to Hook (2001), in Foucauldian ideology knowledge always embodies certain discourses that follow a set of rules or regulations. Throughout Foucault\u2019s published works, from The Archaeology of Knowledge (1970b) to The History of Sexuality (1978c), he explained the mechanisms created by discourse and constructed a somewhat systematic way of historically analysing discourse. For Foucault, discourse is constructed through sets of signs/symbols, statements, and practices that are expressed and asserted as a particular way of existence (see, for example, Foucault, 1970b). Foucault did not invest in the statements themselves but rather believed that discourse goes beyond what objects and subjects symbolically represent (Foucault, 1970b). The extra \u2018things\u2019 discourse contains cannot be simply extracted as words or texts. Discourses enable and constrain, facilitate, and limit what can be spoken about, by whom, when, and where (Foucault, ). According to Foucauldian discourse analysts such as Dreyfus and Rabinow (1982) and Smith (2008), Foucauldian scholars ask how discourse is formed and explore in what ways available discursive resources (beyond words and texts) within a particular context influence this particular discourse.\n\nTheories on discourse can be employed to explain how social phenomena are culturally embedded. For Foucault in his early stage of theorisation, everything could be discourse. Therefore, Foucault rejected the concept of universal truth, as truth was only constructed within discourse (Foucault, 1978a). According to Dreyfus and Rabinow (1982), for Foucault, \u2018truth\u2019 could be narrated as nothing exists outside of discourse. In Foucault\u2019s last stage of life, he tried to engage in considerations of agency (the idea that individuals might be able to access ways of reaching a certain degree of freedom in action or thought) in relation to his explanation of care of the self.\n\nAccording to Gaventa (2003), for Foucault, both agency and structure were constructed through power. Foucault claimed that power can be everywhere. It is essential to the discursive construction of knowledge and discourse, and vice versa:\n\nDiscourses are not once and for all subservient to power or raised up against it . . . We must make allowance for the complex and unstable process whereby a discourse can be both an instrument and an effect of power, but also a hindrance, a stumbling block, a point of resistance and a starting point for an opposing strategy. Discourse transmits and produces power; it reinforces it, but also undermines and exposes it, renders it fragile and makes it possible to thwart it. (Foucault, 1978c, p. 100)\n\nFor Foucault, power was persuasive and dispersed, as opposed to possessed or owned by people or groups through coercion and manipulation (Foucault & Sheridan, 1977). \u2018Power is everywhere\u2019 and \u2018comes from everywhere\u2019, thereby it is neither a structure nor an agency (Foucault, 1998, p. 63). In my research, power is considered in relation to discourse; power relations are everywhere and come from everywhere. In keeping with Foucault\u2019s theorising, power (relations) can be productive as well as repressive and negative (Foucault, 1998). Power can both enable and constrain possibilities through discourse.\n\nWe must cease once and for all to describe the effects of power in negative terms: it \u2018excludes\u2019, it \u2018represses\u2019, it \u2018censors\u2019, it \u2018abstracts\u2019, it \u2018masks\u2019, it \u2018conceals\u2019. In fact power produces; it produces reality; it produces domains of objects and rituals of truth. The individual and the knowledge that may be gained of him belong to this production. (Foucault & Sheridan, 1977, p. 194)\n\nThe duality of power expressed above indicates the complexity of power relations. In the discourse of filial piety, power is exercised between individuals\u2019 various identities within family relationships. Power, just as discourse, can both constrain and enable people\u2019s sense-making.\n\nFoucault used his dialectical conceptualising of power/knowledge to demonstrate that power is constructed through scientific understanding, acquired forms of knowledge, and truth. Foucault sees truth as produced through kinds of discourses that function to promote perceptions of what is true (Foucault, 1977a). Regular effects of power are induced by such constructed truths. In this book, concepts of what is truth and what is natural are overlapping (on Chinese philosophical conceptualisations of what is natural see Chapters 6 and 7). According to Edwards (2013) and Lewis (1983), there is a significant correlation between truth and naturalness in metaphysics. They contended that the ultimate truth is built on discourse of the most natural subjects and properties. For Foucault, regimes of truth are built upon scientific discourse and reinforced through scientific institutions, modern political and economic systems, education, and so on (Foucault & Sheridan, 1977). Truth is not objective but rather a set of rules and regulations that separate what is conceived to be true and false.\n\nDiscursive Formation. Foucault emphasised discursive formation, which in his later writings replaced his early idea of the episteme from The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences (Foucault, 1970b). The episteme refers to \u2018unconscious\u2019 and orderly structures that form the possibility and conditions of scientific knowledge at any given time and place (O\u2019Farrell, 2007, p. 39). Foucault placed more importance on how and why one speaks than to specifically who speaks. Discourse is often realised in the name of \u2018truth\u2019 or \u2018knowledge\u2019 (in other words, discourse can be seen as a form of truth). The will to attain truth or knowledge propels people to practise discursiveness (Foucault, 1970b). It successfully conceals the discipline that power operates on people (Oliver, 2010). For Foucault, there is no universal or natural knowledge (Foucault, 1978a). Any knowledge is generated in the conspiracy between power and knowledge through discursive formation (May, 2006). For example, neo-Confucian discourse of filial piety was constructed through many factors, especially top-down state manipulation and other power conspiracies. Discourse is more than the ways in which meanings are represented through language, and it interacts closely with invisible constructive power. Such power constructs the world we are living in and the conceptualisation of the self. Foucault sees the self as a historical subject constructed through limited and limiting conditions; the self is produced through either the practice of power/discourse, or technologies/cultivation of the self (Foucault, 1970a).\n\nIn Foucault\u2019s early theorisation of discourse, knowledge does not come from subjective observation and life experiences but from discursive formation. For example, modern knowledge is produced through discursive formation within scientific/disciplinary discourse (Foucault, 1970b). Foucault emphasised how knowledge and power conspire with each other within certain discourses (Dreyfus & Rabinow, 1982). His concept of the episteme dictates that discursive practice cannot escape from the regulation imposed on constructs in time and place (Foucault, 1970a). The reason he stopped using the episteme was because he could not ignore the occurrence of resistance to power, which provides an opportunity for a certain freedom of agency. Both the structure side of discourse and Foucault\u2019s consideration of the agency of individuals over traditional/cultural discourse, discussed above, are in line with my research aim to investigate migrant peasant workers\u2019 sense-making of care experiences through discourses of filial piety.\n\nDiscursive Formation of Tradition and History. Foucault\u2019s theory of discourse sees the past and tradition as discursively constructed through current discourses. Hobsbawm and Ranger (1983) stated that tradition is a full set of ritualised procedures, undertaken in order to build a connection with the past. In their perspective, tradition is not something that has been left with predecessors but is instead \u2018invented\u2019 by people in the present. People employ \u2018traditional\u2019 materials to create new traditions according to certain social needs that exist in the current reality. Such traditions are invented through a set of complicated languages symbolising communication and practices. According to Jing (1996), tradition contains ritual meaning and attempts to reaffirm certain values and regulations; it has to be perceived to be continuous with the past. For Foucault, such invented traditions resonate with his claim that history is disrupted, but not continuous (Foucault, 1970b). Hobsbawm and Ranger (1983) claimed that those traditions that appeared to be ancient often instead originated quite close in time to their identification. In its own way, tradition could be invented rapidly, and thereby came into being non-linearly (Jing, 1996). Such tradition reflected a disruption from the past and perhaps the future as well. Invented tradition symbolises the way to respond to the new context according to the (constructed) old one.\n\nThis theorising about the idea of tradition is a reminder of influential French philosopher Maurice Halbwachs\u2019 conceptualisation. From a more micro-level perspective, he explained the internal drive for a society or a group of people to invent a tradition or a set of collective memories. He attempted to answer the question of why a society needs memory (Halbwachs, 1996). He argued that every individual holds an illusion that the current reality is somehow imperfect compared to the past. For example, older adults often romanticise their childhood and their twenties. Memory gives the past a scent of mystery and an illusion of perfection in another dimension (Halbwachs, 1995). The past is detached from the present. The past, formed through collective memory, is constrained from the present reality. In the present reality, relationships are often fixated. However, in the \u2018past\u2019 there were different types of people and relationships in which one has been embedded in different stages of life.\n\nOnly when the individual in the present is willing to accept or acknowledge various kinds of relationships in the past will these relationships appear influential in the past. These relationships do not constrain one as current relationships do (Luo, 2011). Therefore, Halbwachs (1996) contended that memories of the past are a way of escaping or an attempt to \u2018solve\u2019 the current reality. In the Chinese context, according to Luo (2011), just as individuals need memories to release current pressures and stresses, society needs collective memory to build a somewhat utopian view of \u2018the past\u2019 to express dissatisfactions about current inequalities and other social injustices. Such a utopia enables people to embellish, rectify, or moderate the past in their memory, in terms of the present (Luo, 2011). Just like tradition, collective memory is merely an invented discursive formation that aims to legitimate the connection between the past and the now.\n\nThe Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution Discursively Constructed as Taboo Topics. Taboo is a discursively constructed concept in Foucault\u2019s theories (Foucault, 1994). Foucault discussed taboos as constraints from subject, morality, and power majeure. In Foucault\u2019s view, people are forced to talk around taboo topics (Foucault, 1994). For instance, according to Xu (2007), people tended to use \u2018the past\u2019 (guoqu, \u8fc7\u53bb) or \u2018those years\u2019 (naxienian, \u90a3\u4e9b\u5e74) to avoid directly referring to the Great Leap Forward (GLF) and the Cultural Revolution (CR) because in China the GLF and CR are considered to be taboo topics. Since the Economic Reform in 1978, the GLF and CR have been discouraged from being deeply examined in the public discourse. According to Xu (2007), the \u2018scars\u2019 (trauma) caused by the GLF and CR only remain visible on the surface, without a clear indication of what lies beneath. He claimed that the political and public discourse had not conducted a thorough inquiry into that period of time, at least not that the public knows about. Rosen (2007) wrote about the GLF and CR collectively as a taboo topic from a Foucauldian discourse perspective. According to Manning and Wemheuer (2011), the government is reluctant to pay too much attention to events for which they bear responsibility.\n\nIt should be noted that from a Foucauldian theoretical perspective and from the perspective of the above authors, a taboo is not something upon which people can absolutely not remark but rather something that people do not have the complete freedom, consciously or subconsciously, to discuss or research. In vol. 1 of The History of Sexuality, Foucault explained that a taboo can be mentioned but is not encouraged to be discussed deeply due to stigmatisation and social rejection (Foucault, 1978c). In the Chinese political discourse, it is discouraged to place deep public criticism of the GLF and CR. In the public discourse, people are reluctant to remember a period of time that represents extensive and extreme hardship and struggle (Xu, 2007).\n\nAgency and Change (Resistance). Foucault\u2019s discourse theory also explored means by which dominating discourses can be resisted and a form of agency can be practised. Discourse theory was criticised by both Giddens (1982) and Bourdieu (1991) for being too inclined to emphasise structure. For them, Foucault\u2019s discursive theory promotes discourse\u2019s predetermined focus on the subject in a capitalist society over the possibility of resistance against discursive hegemony and disciplinary force. According to Ouyang (2012), Foucault\u2019s discourse theory (in the early stage of Foucault\u2019s works) is more concerned with how discourse comes to (re)realise power relations through the production of knowledge and less with how people can make changes. Foucault\u2019s main focus was on how discourse generates knowledge and disciplines humanity through power relations and exercises. If everything is discourse, change can hardly be achieved. His criticism of current modernity and its disciplinary restrictions on humanity reached a dilemma that seems unresolvable; indeed, if everything is constructed through discourse and discursive power relations are everywhere, humanity has no way of escaping contextual structural forces (Foucault, 1980b).\n\nHowever, in his later stage of life, Foucault appeared to be trying to search for a solution to this dilemma of the power of structure over agency through his theorising of care of the self, in which he drew on ancient Greek and Roman history of sexuality (Foucault, 2012a). He refuted the kind of accusation levelled by Giddens (1982) and later by Bourdieu (1991) and Ouyang (2012) in one of his interviews titled \u2018Truth, Power, Self: An Interview\u2019:\n\nHow can you imagine that I think change is impossible, since what I have analyzed was always related to political action? All of Discipline and Punish is an attempt to answer this question and to show how a new way of thinking took place\u2026. In my books I have really tried to \u2026 show all the factors that interacted and the reactions of people. I believe in the freedom of people. To the same situation, people react in very different ways. (Foucault, 1988, p. 14)\n\nIn his two lectures at Dartmouth, Foucault talked about the legitimate possibility of agency of those who practise subjugated knowledge or those considered as subaltern groups who fail to meet the needs or interests of the dominant class (Foucault & Blasius, 1993). In my research, migrant peasant workers, who were misconceived and marginalised, are also considered capable of making sense of different discourses and power relations.\n\nAlthough to a somewhat limited extent, Foucault did mention some modes of practice through which structural changes could take place. For example, aesthetics of existence is a passive technique, to an extent, in which the subject adopts natural and physical enjoyments to resist discursive hegemony, in an aesthetic of the self. Scholars such as Stuart Hall tried to develop ways of resistance to the dominant discourse, starting from Foucault\u2019s theory of aesthetics of existence (Hall, 1997). In his later work Foucault identified this stance with the activity of parrhesia or truth-telling (Foucault, 1999). The Foucauldian concept of parrhesia is commonly rendered not merely as truthful speech but as fearless speech (He & van Heugten, 2020). A key element of the concept, as described by Foucault, is that the undertaking to speak truth must represent some kind of existential risk for the speaker, who has some personal incentive not to speak the truth. In Chapters 8 and 9, parrhesia will be discussed as a possible way of achieving agency (change) or as a \u2018solution\u2019 for the current unsettling nature of the discursive construction of filial piety.\n\nIn my work, the agency starts from exploring and identifying different discourses of filial piety, rather than from jumping forward to locating the technological means for resistance at an epistemological level. As Foucault said, in his interview on \u2018An Aesthetics of Existence\u2019,\n\nOne did not suggest what people ought to be, what they ought to do, what they ought to think and believe. It was a matter of showing how social mechanisms up to now have been able to work \u2026 and then, starting from there, one left to the people themselves, knowing all the above, the possibility of self-determination and the choice of their own existence. (Foucault, 1977b, p. 50)\n\nHence, as Foucault noted, it is meaningful to first identify various mechanisms involved in discourses of filial piety in order to make sense of participants\u2019 constructed selves. Only through this process will participants be able to practise some of the techniques of the self that Foucault mentioned in his works.\n\nPower and Governmental Discourse\n\nFoucault\u2019s perspective on power can be contrasted to conflict theorist and functionalist views of power which mainly refer to different understandings of domination (Gaventa, 2003). On the one hand, many conflict theorists see power as a means to fulfilling one\u2019s goal. On the other hand, most functionalists consider power as a collective trait. The first perspective views domination as individual actors\u2019 ability to reach their goal. However, this perspective does not explain power\u2019s structural features. The latter perspective views domination as a structural feature of the social system. Structure determines power completely, and power breaks away from agentive actions. The two perspectives can be employed together in an attempt to explain complementary relationships.\n\nAccording to Gaventa (2003), Foucault built his theory on power. His work represented a radical departure from previous perspectives on power that essentialised a pyramid-shaped power structure (Gaventa, 2003; Sheridan & Foucault, 1980). Foucault saw power as enacted and embodied rather than possessed, diffuse rather than concentrated (Foucault, 2008). For him, power does not come from A forcing B to do something but from interaction with discourse.\n\nPower is everywhere: not because it embraces everything, but because it comes from everywhere. Power is not an institution, nor a structure, nor a possession. It is the name we give to a complex strategic situation in a particular society. (Foucault, 1978c, p. 93)\n\nFoucault claimed that in modern society, power operates through a series of techniques involving subjecting to knowledge, making visible, ordering, normalising, and disciplining. Just as discourse is embedded in every aspect of our society, power is everywhere (Oliver, 2010). Power is not only about negative influences such as suppressing, oppression, inspection, separation, hiding, and so on, but also actively produces reality and rituals for \u2018truth\u2019 (Fendler, 2010). Foucault expressed neutrality in relation to the nature of power by also focusing on its productive and positive side (Foucault, 1978b).\n\nIn Foucault\u2019s time, the philosophical and sociological focus was shifted from structural political economy towards culture (Ouyang, 2012). Foucault has been criticised by scholars, especially post-Marxists, for his neglect of macro-level power relations in society (Daldal, 2014). Many post-Marxists even borrowed his idea of bio-power and power/knowledge to complement the framework of cultural hegemony (Gaventa, 2003). Marxists have given a more systematic explanation of society on the macro level. For them, class conflicts and a nation-state\u2019s powerful position are the essential matters. However, for Foucault, government is only one of all power relationships, important but not uniquely so. In modernity, power is exercised everywhere and is intractable (Foucault, 1970b). Although he did not dwell on this, Foucault himself did embrace the idea that apparatus and institutions matter a lot. That is to say, although power becomes more broad and hidden in the modern era, governmental power relations are still very important (Foucault, 2007).\n\nThe Chinese government\u2019s policies highly influenced the (re)construction and (re)production of filial piety in China. According to Huang (2011), modernity is a process of reconstructing our everyday life to be a part of the modern world, and Chinese modernity is propelled predominantly by the state. She thought that the state\u2019s exercise of power over the reproduction of filial piety included two main policies: the one-child policy, and the replacement of burial with cremation. The one-child policy conflicted with the notion of traditional filial piety that held that being fruitful by having a significant number of children is the most important filial responsibility (Luo, 2013). In addition, the government forbids traditional burial rituals, which, to a great extent, diminishes the spiritual authority of ancestors and parents (Huang, 2011). These examples represent an extreme form of disciplinary power (Foucault, 1970b). According to Foucault (1991), the ultimate goal of the modern state is to regulate the population for economic reasons. Therefore, a Foucauldian discourse analysis needs to take careful account of the institutional power relations of the state which may not, on the surface, appear economic. And clearly, given the state\u2019s far-reaching authority, this is also important in the Chinese context.\n\nYan (2006) proposed that there are two main perspectives on how the Chinese state\u2019s exercise of power has influenced filial piety. On the one hand, after the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic of China, the socialist revolution diminished the social foundation of filial piety, which included the patriarchal clan system, ancestral beliefs, and family-owned property. Moreover, neoliberal market economic reform also weakened these foundational mechanisms. A new rational intergenerational relation replaced the traditional filial piety. On the other hand, according to Davis-Friedmann (1991), China did not yet have enough resources to build a comprehensive welfare system. Therefore, it continued to rely on Confucian filial piety to maintain social order and sustainable intergenerational relationships. These two different views on interactions between the state and filial piety represent a top-down approach to analysing these relationships. My research took a bottom-up approach, involving an exploration of how my participants viewed their own (re)construction of filial piety in interaction with the state\u2019s influence.\n\nArchaeology and Genealogy\n\nCrowley (2009) described Foucault\u2019s \u2018archaeology\u2019 and \u2018genealogy\u2019 as \u2018two halves of a complementary approach, alternating and supporting each other\u2019 (p. 341). Foucault\u2019s concept of archaeology may be best represented in his earlier work on the specific constructions of social discourse on madness, health, and the history of ideas in Madness and Civilization, The Birth of the Clinic, and The Order of Things, and particularly in his methodological treatise, The Archaeology of Knowledge. During the 1970s, he used genealogy to replace archaeology. Simplistically speaking, genealogy adopted power into the picture of archaeology to a greater extent (Foucault, 1978a).\n\nIn The Archaeology of Knowledge, Foucault described the \u2018archive\u2019 as \u2018a practice that causes a multiplicity of statements to emerge as so many regular events, as so many things to be dealt with and manipulated\u2019 (Foucault, 1970a, p. 130). In this way, Foucault conceptualised a field in which discourses take place in and around a given empirical set of regularities that can be generated by any contingent set of historical circumstances, and that may limit or distinguish one discourse from another. In confronting this givenness, Foucault noted,\n\n[Archaeology] does not imply the search for a beginning \u2026 it deprives us of our continuities \u2026 it breaks the thread of transcendental teleologies \u2026 [rather it] questions the already-said at the element of its existence\u2026. Archaeology describes discourses [simply] as practices specified in the elements of the archive. (Foucault, 1970a, p. 131)\n\nIn his essay \u2018Nietzsche, Genealogy, History\u2019, Foucault (1978a) defined genealogy as\n\n[requiring] patience and a knowledge of details, and [depending] on a vast accumulation of source material \u2026 In short, genealogy demands relentless erudition. Genealogy does not oppose itself to history as the lofty and profound gaze of the philosopher might compare to the molelike perspective of the scholar; on the contrary, it rejects the metahistorical deployment of ideal significations \u2026 It opposes itself to the search for \u2018origins\u2019. (Foucault, 1978a, pp. 78\u201390)\n\nFrom Vol. 1 of the History of Sexuality and his interview \u2018The Confession of the Flesh\u2019, Foucault\u2019s genealogical debate became more political and more focused on the relationship between practice and discourse. His analysis of knowledge also became more related to power (Foucault, 1972b, 1978c).\n\nBoth archaeology and genealogy are useful for critiquing the construction of a linear history of filial piety. In my analysis of Chinese filial piety I also incorporated a consideration of the Chinese Confucian and neo-Confucian traditions, as well as drawing on various nineteenth- and twentieth-century efforts to criticise these Chinese traditions, as noted in Chapter 2. I also addressed post-economic reform (1978) social policies in China, that attempt to compensate for the challenges that industrialisation, modernisation, and internal migration have placed on the support of elderly parents by their children. My analysis included sufficient historical inquiry to describe the evolution of these elements of the archive within which the discourse took place. I have not attempted to define the discourse as some sort of derived reflection or consequence of those elements. This reflects my scepticism about the epistemic certainty of such a causal relationship, in keeping with Foucault\u2019s claim that history is broken and non-linear (Foucault, 1978a). It is also, in part, simply a reflection of my greater interest in the subjective significance of the discourse itself.\n\nSubjectivity, Genealogy, and Discourse of Filial Piety\n\nThe question of subjectivity arose in Foucault\u2019s work after his deployment of the concept of genealogy. In contrast to archaeology, Foucauldian genealogy more directly explored the ways that social forces exercise power over individual subjectivities, in part by direct and intensive efforts to construct the knowledge of people in society. The classic Foucauldian example is the creation of the surveillance state, described in Discipline and Punish (Foucault & Sheridan, 1977). Foucault argued that the transformation of punishment from public spectacle to incarceration puts inspection, observation, direction, and self-examination at the centre of the idea of corrective punishment. But the greater significance of this change is that it was reflected in the state\u2019s attitude towards its own citizens as well\u2014the spread of \u2018surveillance, control and policing\u2019 as a strategy through which most social institutions collaborated in efforts to discipline the general public, in support of the interests of leading economic forces (Crowley, 2009, p. 342). The goal of the exercise of power is \u2018the formation of subjectivity\u2019 (Crowley, 2009, p. 343).\n\n[T]hrough the control of ideas [the state and institutions] reconstructs its subjects to produce new actions, habits and skills and ultimately new kinds of people \u2026 Discipline and surveillance is interiorized to the point that each individual is his or her own overseer. (Crowley, 2009, p. 434)\n\nSuch a description of the genealogy of subjectivities obviously sets the agenda for a critical analysis of discourse to explore the formation of subjectivity by power, and to explore ways that subjects can engage in that discourse to resist the self-interested agendas of power. Such an analysis assumes that the subject\u2019s goal is to reassert their own autonomy and to exercise self-care. Yet this very dramatic description of the interaction of power and subjective knowledge seems an exaggeration employed for rhetorical effect. Foucault himself, in \u2018Two Lectures [on Power and Knowledge]\u2019 (Foucault, 1980b), seemed to restate the issue more mildly when he spoke of \u2018a sense of the increasing vulnerability to criticism of things, institutions, practices, discourses\u2019, to which he hoped he had contributed (Foucault, 1980b, p. 80).\n\nIn opposition to globalising and totalising styles of thinking, Foucault (1980a) proposed criticism of a \u2018local character\u2019, emphasising a \u2018return of knowledge\u2019, especially of \u2018subjugated knowledges\u2019 (p. 81), which include \u2018naive knowledge\u2019, \u2018popular knowledges\u2019, and the \u2018disqualified\u2019 voices of disadvantaged groups of people (migrant peasant workers in this research). Research focusing on genealogy can attempt to recover and reconstruct these knowledges, allowing them to emerge from their suppression by more institutionalised forms of knowledge (p. 83). Such research will pay greater attention to the voices of \u2018speaking, discoursing subjects\u2019 (p. 85) and, without asserting any positive value for ignorance or mindlessness, will more carefully ask questions about whether it makes sense to \u2018diminish\u2019 or \u2018disqualify\u2019 particular voices just because they are not associated with hierarchies of power (Foucault, 1980a, p. 85).\n\nWithin the context of Chinese filial piety discourse, a sensitivity to genealogies of knowledge enables me to look at the interaction between power and knowledge without making oversimplified assumptions about the binding or normative force of particular traditional concepts. For instance, in invoking Confucian values, the tradition itself is ambiguous. Classic Confucianism emphasises broad concepts of \u2018respect\u2019 and \u2018care\u2019 without extensive normative elaboration. In the later neo-Confucian tradition, Confucian concepts of filial piety are elaborated in prescriptive detail and backed by an explicitly and implicitly authoritarian intention. However, that is not to say the traits of these two discourses do not overlap. The difference can only be simplified for the sake of understanding.\n\nDisciplinary Power of Neo-Confucianism\n\nI consider how neo-Confucian filial discourse resembles a western modern space where (scientific) disciplinary power is practised and exercised, as Foucault described in his books The Archaeology of Knowledge and The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences (Foucault, 1970a, 1970b). As discussed in Chapter 2, the teaching of Confucius himself (over 2,000 years ago) was different from neo-Confucianism (dominating Chinese society from the twelfth century to the eighteenth century). Ancient Confucianism valued \u2018respect\u2019 and \u2018care\u2019 for parents. It did not exact so many requirements of children, such as to obey parents and other people, including the emperor. By contrast, neo-Confucianism placed a great many restrictions on individuals. In the neo-Confucian discourse of filial piety, the \u2018obedience\u2019 principle was the main constituent of children\u2019s relationship with both parents and the emperor. The provision of care and intergenerational emotional bonds ranked below the principle of having to \u2018obey\u2019. Neo-Confucianists elevated filial morality onto the \u2018truth\u2019 level, which they called the li (principle). Li referred to the ways in which everything in the world comes into being; according to li, filial morality existed before human existence and human society. Filial rules and regulations became almost \u2018disciplinary\u2019, akin to how Foucault described modern disciplinary science.\n\nApart from the contextual and social difference between China at that time (where there were no modern scientific disciplines after neo-Confucianism\u2019s founding and before the eighteenth century) and western modern society, there are other differences in terms of the nature of this disciplinary power. An example of a disciplinary form of power in the Foucauldian sense is located at the beginning of western modernisation when religious forms of control lost their dominance to scientific disciplines. However, during the Song dynasty in China, religions such as Zen Buddhism and Taoism never dominated Chinese society as Christianity did in the west during the pre-modern era. Instead, the ubiquitous feature of modern \u2018disciplinary\u2019 discursive power in Foucault\u2019s writing appears to parallel neo-Confucian discourse, which is everywhere.\n\nAnother similarity between disciplinary modernity and neo-Confucianism is that both have experienced criticism. Modernity has been heavily criticised by Foucault and Foucauldian discourse analysts. In China, neo-Confucianism was already heavily criticised at the beginning of nineteenth century and during CR. However, there are two different opinions about the critiques of CR. One opinion holds that filial piety (especially in neo-Confucianism) was completely criticised during CR (Zhang, 2017). On the other hand, there are some scholars who have expressed the belief that rejection of filial piety only applied at the level of the family. Filial piety towards the state (which used to be the emperor) did not face criticism, but instead was further reinforced (consider, for example, the national worship of Chairman Mao). That is to say, the \u2018disciplinary\u2019 power of state filial piety still prevailed during CR, despite filial piety being overtly criticised at the level of the family.\n\nIn the wake of rising political and public discourse of promoting filial piety in recent years, as mentioned in Chapter 2, the disciplinary power of filial discourse may re-enter Chinese people\u2019s everyday life and awareness. However, obedience is a far more prominent concept in neo-Confucian than in classical Confucian tradition. Since obedience to parents is not as prominent a feature of contemporary discourses of filial piety, the oppressive nature of filial piety may not be as strong as western modern scientific disciplinary power. That is to say, to some extent, the current circumstance of blending between alleged western modernity and Chinese traditions might have already enabled a hidden resistance to the disciplinary power of filial discourse, at least to some extent. However, by contrast to the requirement to obey parents, the obligation to obey the government is still relatively strong, which could potentially enforce the disciplinary power of filial piety. In that case, Foucault\u2019s strategy for resisting western modernity could be useful for the Chinese current context, in terms of magnifying the care and respect aspects of filial discourse, instead of emphasising blind obedience."}, {"url": "http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2012-08/20/content_15687412.htm", "page_content": "Four stories from 24 Filial Exemplars, a classic Confucian text by Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) scholar Guo Jujing.\n\nImperial example\n\nLiu Heng was Emperor Wen of the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 24).

The problem with this approach is that it tends to emphasize identification of behavioral rules or norms, which limits its potential for application in other cultural contexts. Due to the global trend of population aging, governments are searching for solutions to the accompanying financial burden so greater attention is being focused on the issue of elder care and its relevance to filial practices. We contend that the psychological investigation of filial piety in Chinese societies has progressed to the point that it can now provide a solid structure for research targeting intergenerational relations in other cultures. We describe an indigenous psychology approach that integrated Chinese historical, philosophical, and social trends to construct a model of filial piety in terms of the dual reciprocal and authoritarian filial aspects underlying parent\u2013child relations: the dual filial piety model (DFPM). We use this model to re-conceptualize filial piety from its usual definition as a set of Chinese culture-specific norms to a contextualized personality construct represented by a pair of culturally-sensitive psychological schemas of parent\u2013child interaction. We then describe how the DFPM can provide a framework for research on filial relations on individual, structural, societal, and cross-cultural levels. We conclude with a discussion of how the model may be able to integrate and extend Western research on intergenerational relations and contribute to the issue of elder care beyond Chinese societies.\n\nIntroduction\n\nFilial piety (xiao) is the core pillar of Confucian ethics (Ho, 1986). It specifies moral norms that encompass material and emotional aspects of the parent\u2013child relationship. The character xiao is comprised of an upper component representing age and a lower component representing child, indicating that the child supports and succeeds the parent. Filial piety not only specifies norms within the family, it also provides the social and ethical foundations for maintaining social order, and thus a stable society. It has provided the moral underpinning for Chinese patterns of parent\u2013child relations and socialization for millennia.\n\nResearch interest in parent\u2013child relations is on the rise due to the global trend of population aging and the growing issue of elder care (e.g., Glass et al., 2013; North and Fiske, 2015). Researchers around the world are investigating the influence of filial norms on adult children\u2019s support of their elderly parents in order to share the public financial burden of elder care with the family system (e.g., Lowenstein and Daatland, 2006; Gans et al., 2009). Whereas Chinese filial norms encompass reciprocal expectations for parent\u2013child relations, as well as social structure, ethical requirements, and power dynamics (Ikels, 2004), scholars in Western societies tend to define filial norms in a much more limited way. They portray them in terms of a generalized one-way expectation regarding adult children\u2019s responsibility to support their aging parents (Silverstein et al., 2006), and conceptualize them as separate from the religious and social contexts, which are seen as situational influences on individual filial beliefs (Gans et al., 2009).\n\nThe question that arises is: can a seemingly culture-bound concept such as Chinese filial piety provide insight applicable to parent\u2013child relations in other cultural contexts? Given the centrality of filial piety to Chinese culture, it is a highly developed construct. It is plausible that insights gained from studying parent\u2013child relations in Chinese culture may shed light on aspects of parent\u2013child relations that are less evident in other cultures, just as sociologist Goffman (1959) relied on the Chinese conceptualization of face in constructing his famous universal dramaturgical theory of face.\n\nIn this paper, we contend that the psychological investigation of parent\u2013child relations in Chinese societies has progressed to the point that it can now provide a solid structure for research targeting intergenerational relations in other cultures. Specifically, we propose that filial piety is a type of contextualized personality construct, and as such it can provide a platform for research on parent\u2013child relations in any culture.\n\nIn order to demonstrate this claim, we first review the foundations of filial piety in Chinese culture and describe the development of the modern psychology of filial piety through research conducted in Chinese societies. We highlight development of the dual filial piety model (DFPM) (Yeh, 2003; Yeh and Bedford, 2003) based on a Chinese indigenous psychology approach. Using this model, we re-conceptualize filial piety from its usual definition as a set of Chinese culture-specific norms to a contextualized personality construct representing the underlying psychological mechanisms in the parent\u2013child relationship. With this perspective, the DFPM can provide a framework for research on intergenerational relational processes and schemas on individual, structural, societal, and cross-cultural levels. In the final section, we indicate how the re-conceptualized model can integrate and extend Western research on parent\u2013child relations.\n\nThe Philosophy of Filial Piety\n\nThe foundation of filial piety lies in ancestor worship (Hsu, 1975). Emperors traced their line of descent from Shang Di, the great founder ancestor god. If the ancestors received the appropriate sacrifices they could provide guidance on important governmental decisions and protect the dynasty (Hsu, 1975). The duty to provide for the ancestors encompassed the emperor and common people alike. The head of a family ruled over his relatives as the emperor ruled over his subjects. Thus, ancestor worship not only provided the organizing principle for the kinship system, but also for role relations in Chinese society in general.\n\nConfucius (551\u2013479 BCE) refined the filial obligations of ancestor worship (Wei, 1969). He lived at a time of great chaos and feudal bickering, so he condensed prevailing beliefs into a practical philosophy, the Way of Humanity, to ensure harmony in the family and thus society. Instead of emphasizing communication with ancestors, he emphasized family, virtue, and orderly social relations (Bi and D\u2019Agostino, 2004). Confucius\u2019 codified works became the cornerstone of education, and the guidelines for moral conduct. They still provide the template for Chinese social structure (Hwang, 1987).\n\nConfucius\u2019 Way of Humanity specifies that two ethical principles should guide social interaction: favoring the intimate (giving preference to those with whom one is closest) and respecting the superior (giving deference to those who are older) (Hwang, 1987). Each is described in the following.\n\nFavoring the Intimate: Pre-Chin Era (521 to 221 BCE)\n\nDuring Confucius\u2019 time, filial piety emphasized the ethical principle of favoring the intimate, which ensures preferential treatment of one\u2019s kin (Hwang, 1987). Confucius described parent\u2013child interaction as motivated by natural affection and the principle of bao (reciprocity), which requires that all helpful behavior be returned (Hsu, 1975). Affection and bao should flow both ways. However, because children have a fundamental obligation to their parents for giving them life, their obligation can never be fully repaid. Thus, motivated by affection, children can return the care they received from their parents by carrying out filial duties such as being respectful and looking after their parents in their old age (Yeh, 2003).\n\nRespecting the Superior: Han to the Qing Dynasty (206 BCE to 1911 AD)\n\nThe motivation underlying the practice of filial piety shifted from the principle of favoring the intimate to the principle of respecting the superior during the Han dynasty (206 BCE\u2013220 AD), and retained this emphasis through the end of the Qing dynasty (1911) (Hsu, 1975). This principle specifies that the person in the superior position should play the role of the decision-maker to ensure family solidarity and prosperity (Hwang, 1987). Accordingly, it is ethically proper for the person in the superior position to make decisions concerning those in inferior positions.\n\nUnder this principle, the practice of filial piety required submission to hierarchical authority and suppression of self-autonomy. Children discounted self-needs to achieve parental desires (Yeh, 2003). This principle justified not only absolute parental authority over children but also, by extension, the authority of any person of an elder generation over those who are junior (Hwang, 2012). The shift in emphasis to the principle of respecting the superior was related to the need to strengthen political sovereignty, with patriarchal parental authority as a representation of the emperor\u2019s absolute authority (Miao, 2015).\n\nModern Filial Piety\n\nThe majority of elderly people living in Chinese communities during the 19th and early 20th centuries lived with their married child, usually their son (Ikels, 2004). Their son, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren provided them with physical, emotional, and financial support. Daughters provided their own parents such support only until they married. After marriage, their primary responsibility shifted to their husbands\u2019 parents (Whyte, 2004). As in imperial times, obedience and submission motivated filial piety (Yeh, 2003).\n\nAfter WWII, Chinese societies began to go through political reform, marketization, and social change as people adapted their lifestyles and value systems. These developments gave rise to questions about the impact of those changes on the patterns and structures of social relationships (Yang et al., 1989). Chinese scholars noticed the trend toward smaller families, greater geographic mobility, and the expansion of women in the workplace. They began to wonder about the harmful effects of filial beliefs in the new modern context (Yeh, 1999). For example, filial piety seemed to inhibit the individual\u2019s independence, suppress creativity, and eliminate personal desires and interests (e.g., Liu and Lin, 1988). They also expressed concern that exposure to the Western ideologies of freedom and independence was giving rise to internal conflict between being filial according to traditional standards, and being self-responsive, independent, and modern (e.g., Ho, 1996).\n\nA number of researchers indicated that filial beliefs may be waning with industrialization and modernization (Yeh, 1997). Some focused on the rapid economic development in Taiwan and argued that Western influences were diminishing the relevance of traditional filial obligations (e.g., Yang, 1988). Others focused on the political climate in the PRC (e.g., Lu, 1990). For example, the Socialist Transformation Movement and the Cultural Revolution led some scholars to doubt the survival of filial piety under Chinese communism, especially since PRC leaders criticized traditional values as feudal remnants to be eliminated (Whyte, 2004). To focus loyalty on the central government and Communist ideology and away from ancestors and parents, China\u2019s authorities created civil rights focused on the individual rather than the family. They passed legislation specifying that daughters and sons share equal responsibility for their birth parents (Miao, 2015).\n\nPsychological Study of Filial Piety in Chinese Societies\n\nFilial piety has long been an important topic to philosophers and historians. Psychologists in Chinese societies only began systematic study of filial piety in the past few decades. Personality and social psychologists wanted to better understand how the process of societal modernization impacted the content and structure of people\u2019s psychological make-up (Yang et al., 1990). They could not ground their research in classical modernization theory (as Western scholars had) because it equates modernization with Westernization. Consequently, many avoided the ongoing debates surrounding sociological theories of societal modernity and instead adopted a social psychological approach (Yang, 2003).\n\nDispositional Approaches\n\nInitially, psychology researchers adopted a psychometric dispositional approach that entailed applying Western methodologies and instruments to local participants (Hwang, 2012). This approach uses the cultural context as a predictor in Western psychology models. Researchers defined filial piety in terms of traditional Chinese norms, and focused on finding ways to measure the strength of an individual\u2019s filial beliefs or attitudes. They then related these scales to other psychological traits or behaviors. The result was two opposing sets of findings that generated debate as to whether filial piety had an overall harmful or helpful impact on individual psychological development and interpersonal relationships, as well as conflicting findings on the question of whether filial piety was waning in influence (see Yeh, 2003 for a review of harmful and beneficial perspectives).\n\nFor example, David Ho was one of the first to develop a filial piety measure (Ho and Yu, 1974). He identified filial attitudes that correlated with traditional parental attitudes such as control, protection, harshness, and neglect, as well as inhibition of self-expression, independence, and creativity (Ho, 1987). Ho (1994) found that filial attitudes were most prevalent among those of low education and socio-economic status, and so concluded that filial beliefs may be diminishing in modern societies. This approach equates filial piety with Chinese cultural traditions and focuses on the decline of traditional norms supporting filial piety.\n\nIn contrast, researchers with a more relational focus of investigation found that filial piety supports warmth, love, harmony, and close family ties, and thus has a beneficial effect on personal growth and interpersonal relationships (e.g., Yang, 1988; Ishii-Kuntz, 1997). Their studies demonstrated that filial values were not waning, and that the mutual interdependence of family members remained strong despite changes in living arrangements and income opportunities for women (see Yeh, 2003 for a review of related studies).\n\nSome scholars have criticized dispositional studies as \u201cexplorative, and not very profound or systematic\u201d (Yang et al., 1990, p. 66), and as \u201cAmericanized in the sense that nearly all uncritically borrow theories, concepts, methods, and tools developed\u2026for Euro-American subjects\u201d (Yang, 2006, p. 285). Researchers applying this approach were unable to tap into changes in the nature of contemporary filial piety; they could only indicate the extent of respondents\u2019 recognition of traditional filial beliefs. In other words, they did not investigate the mechanisms or processes underlying filial piety (the deep structure of human functioning), but focused on the surface content of traditional beliefs. Moreover, since they investigated different aspects of filial belief instead of the complete concept, the findings they reported conflicted with one another (Yeh, 2003).\n\nMoral Development Approaches\n\nFilial piety is the central pillar of the Confucian ethical system (Yeh and Bedford, 2019). Children in Chinese societies are taught that the way they treat their elders is a measure of their moral worth. Thus, some psychology researchers focused on understanding the cognitive stages of filial piety development from the perspective of moral development. Most applied Kohlberg\u2019s stages using dilemma scenarios, which was the dominant paradigm for research on individual moral development at the time (e.g., Snarey, 1985; Ma, 1988). Kohlberg (1981) asserted that moral development progresses through differentiated hierarchical stages with a specified sequence, similar to Piaget (1972/1981) theory of cognitive development.\n\nFilial piety research following Kohlberg\u2019s paradigm encountered a different type of challenge. Kohlberg (1981) asserted that his stages of moral development were invariant for all people. However, he also defined the moral maturation representing the higher stages in terms of the Western ideology of rationalism, individualism, and liberalism. Chinese researchers who adopted Kohlberg\u2019s approach did not initially question this assertion. They did not consider whether a theory developed in the context of Western moral values would applicable in a culture centered on Confucian ethics (Yeh and Bedford, 2019).\n\nA number of the studies that applied Kohlberg\u2019s paradigm to collect moral reasoning data in Chinese societies encountered the problem that many participants\u2019 responses could not be scored with Kohlberg\u2019s standardized system (Snarey, 1985). Most unscorable responses were related to filial piety (e.g., Ma, 1997), indicating that filial piety may have implications for moral decision-making. Doubts about the universal applicability of Kohlberg\u2019s stages were strengthened when reviews of cross-cultural studies of Kohlberg\u2019s stages concluded that the higher stages are not universal because they fail to take into account non-Western philosophies (e.g., Edwards, 1981).\n\nThe Indigenous Psychology Approach: The Dual Filial Piety Model\n\nTo overcome the conflicting results and cultural mismatch encountered in prior filial piety studies, some researchers in Chinese societies began to adopt an indigenous psychology approach (e.g., Yang et al., 1990; Yeh, 1997, 1999). This approach purposefully incorporates a cultural perspective into both conceptual development and theoretical construction. It entails creation and application of theories, concepts, methods, and tools that represent local structures and processes (Yang, 2006). In the following, we describe in some detail the indigenous model developed to represent the psychological mechanisms supporting Chinese filial piety.\n\nThe review presented in the philosophy section suggests that varied aspects of filial piety were highlighted in different stages of China\u2019s development. The filial concept during the pre-Chin Era (before 221 BCE) focused on the reciprocal affection of the parent\u2013child dyad. The filial concept during the period from the Han to the Qing dynasties (202 BCE-1911 AD) emphasized the family role hierarchy (Hamilton, 1990).\n\nYeh (2003) integrated these findings from Chinese history and philosophy to construct a dual-factor model of filial piety. Each factor has psychological meaning at the individual level, and also reflects the influence of historical, societal, and cultural contextual factors. The DFPM is comprised of two higher-order factors that correspond to the two focal filial piety attributes: reciprocity and authoritarianism. Yeh and Bedford (2003) provided empirical evidence for the contents of each type of filial piety and validated a dual filial piety scale. Each factor is described in the following.\n\nReciprocal filial piety (RFP) develops out of genuine affection from long-term positive interaction with one\u2019s parents in daily life. It is rooted in intimacy and the quality of the parent\u2013child relationship. It encompasses emotionally and spiritually caring for one\u2019s parents out of authentic gratitude for their effort and sacrifice, as well as physical and financial care for one\u2019s parents as they age. RFP fulfills the psychological need for relatedness between two individuals within the context of the parent\u2013child relationship (but not the family role dyad). It generally manifests in terms of children\u2019s voluntary support behaviors as expressions of love and care for their parents.\n\nReciprocal filial piety tends to be positively associated with a higher level of education and a higher socio-economic status. Women tend to score higher on RFP than men. It develops through intergenerational communication and sharing in daily life, so it is positively correlated with interpersonal skills (e.g., self-disclosure and empathy), better psychosocial adjustment, and emotional support of parents (Yeh et al., 2009). RFP also positively correlates with life satisfaction (Wong et al., 2010), and mediates the influence of supportive parenting on young adults\u2019 happiness (Chen et al., 2016).\n\nAuthoritarian filial piety (AFP) is guided by obedience to role obligations based on the family hierarchy. It entails suppressing one\u2019s own wishes to comply with one\u2019s parents\u2019 wishes (because of their seniority). Continuing the family lineage and maintaining the family reputation are important. Parents are role models who represent absolute authority during their children\u2019s development and socialization. AFP develops through children\u2019s normative reactions to satisfying parental demands or expectations. AFP fulfills the need for social belonging and collective identity.\n\nAuthoritarian filial piety beliefs are positively associated with less education and lower socio-economic status. Men tend to score higher than women in AFP, and it correlates positively with traditional conservative attitudes (e.g., male superiority and submission to authority) and maladaptation (e.g., neurotic personality traits, depression and anxiety) (Yeh, 2006). Because AFP often involves self-suppression, it is more likely to correlate with personal stress than RFP (Yeh, 2006), and has a only a low correlation with emotional support of parents (Yeh, 2009).\n\nReciprocity and authoritarianism form two intertwined aspects of Chinese filial piety grounded in historical development of the concept. They are not mutually exclusive, but coexist within an individual. They may simultaneously function to varying degrees that depend upon the circumstance (Yeh and Bedford, 2004). They may also both promote the same outcome. For instance, both reduce parent\u2013adolescent conflict at the family level, although the effect of RFP (via reconciliation) is generally more significant than that of AFP (via inhibition). Both also promote intergenerational support: RFP via accumulated affection, and AFP by regulating behavior so that the minimum social expectations for the role of the child are met. The detailed psychological features of the two filial dimensions are summarized in Table 1.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nTable 1. The dual filial piety model: psychological schemas for interaction with parents.\n\nPsychological Insights From the DFPM\n\nThe DFPM has led to at least three important insights. First, rather than designating people as filial or un-filial, the DFPM allows for a more nuanced examination of the psychological mechanisms underlying the affective reactions and social behavior associated with filial piety. It provides a more comprehensive framework for understanding the personal practice of filial piety (including its motivation and expression) based on the interaction between RFP and AFP. For example, the DFPM identifies four possible modes of personal interaction with parents (Yeh and Bedford, 2004).\n\nPeople high in both reciprocal and authoritarian filial dimensions operate in a balanced mode. They are able to simultaneously consider personal choices and role obligations. They have a deep and intimate bond with their parents and easily find ways to combine their parents\u2019 needs with their own. People high in RFP and low in AFP operate in a reciprocal mode. They have a positive relationship with their parents and good communication. They emphasize personal choices over role obligations, and experience filial piety as authentic love rather than self-sacrifice. People with low RFP and high AFP operate in an authoritarian mode and have a less intimate and more obedient relationship with their parents. Authoritarians focus on role obligations and perceive filial piety as self-suppression or self-sacrifice. They may find it difficult to satisfy their parents\u2019 needs. People functioning in the non-filial mode are low in both RFP and AFP and isolate themselves from their parents. Non-filials have low identification with their family and child roles. Psychological mechanisms other than the dual aspects of filial piety, such as egocentrism, may guide their behavior toward their parents.\n\nSecond, the DFPM can explain previous divergent findings on the impact of filial piety in Chinese societies. As noted, early research resulted in conflicting findings as to whether filial piety had an overall harmful or helpful impact in the context of modern society. Some researchers cautioned against its negative impact such as inhibition of self-expression and independence (e.g., Ho, 1987). Others found that filial piety supports warmth and harmony, with a beneficial effect on personal growth and interpersonal relationships (e.g., Ishii-Kuntz, 1997). With the DFPM, it is clear that these two sets of findings do not conflict. Instead, they represent the two coexisting dynamic fundamental aspects of filial piety that must be considered together in order to have a complete understanding of the role of filial piety in modern Chinese societies.\n\nThird, scholars have noted an overlap between Chinese filial piety and values or attitudes found in other cultures. The DFPM highlights the necessity of considering both aspects of filial piety in order to gain a complete picture of its role in Chinese societies. Similarly, it is also necessary to consider both aspects of Chinese filial piety when comparing it to related filial concepts in other societies. However, in many such comparisons, researchers have used incomplete concepts to represent Chinese filial piety, meaning that they did not make a comprehensive evaluation.\n\nFor example, Schwartz et al. (2010) observed that although Hispanic familism and Chinese filial piety originate from different parts of the world, they share common elements in that they stress social ties over individual desires. In other words, they share transcultural dimensions. Schwartz et al. (2010) demonstrated that both familism and filial piety group together under a single factor of family/relationship primacy, which is equivalent across gender and ethnicity. However, the items Schwartz et al. (2010) used to measure the concept of filial piety all focused solely on authoritarian aspects (AFP), and no items addressed reciprocal aspects (RFP). Unger et al. (2002) also found overlap between Hispanic familism and filial piety. Unger et al. (2002) definition of filial piety relied solely on the work of Ho (1994), who detailed only AFP characteristics. Thus, it appears that at least in terms of social belongingness schema, some characteristics of Hispanic familism are similar to AFP, but the comparison is incomplete since RFP aspects of Chinese filial piety were not considered. This observation also invites the question of whether reciprocal aspects of Hispanic familism exist.\n\nAnother example comes from scholars who have used terms like filial duties and filial obligations to describe the nature of North American parent\u2013child relations. Blustein (1977) proposed that because Western parent\u2013child relations are based on affection and intimacy, there are inherent limits on the nature of the obligations they entail. In Blustein\u2019s view, filial duties are based on gratitude and not indebtedness, and so cannot be expressed in terms of repayment, but only through an ongoing relationship that affirms the special importance of the parent. English (1979, p. 147) directly answered the question \u201cwhat do grown children owe their parents?\u201d with a single word: \u201cnothing.\u201d She contended that the parent\u2013child relationship is best characterized as an ongoing friendship with spontaneous affection, and that love is the correct ground of filial obligation. Dixon (1995) likewise argued that the voluntary and loving nature of the relationship is the most robust basis of children\u2019s filial behavior. All three of these scholars provided reasoned arguments about the moral foundations of parent\u2013child obligations, rights, and duties to one another. Although the nature of these arguments reflects reasoning that is nothing like Confucian ethics, the foundation of filial relations in gratitude and spontaneous affection and love that they describe as the ideal for parent\u2013child relations in the West is identical to that supported by the reciprocal aspect of filial piety in Chinese societies. The manifestation or expression of affection may differ by culture, but affection-based interaction between children and parents exists in all cultures.\n\nApproaches to Chinese filial piety that focus on traditional norms tend to emphasize aspects related to AFP (as in the direct cultural comparison with Hispanic familism). That approach does not allow the cultural similarities in RFP-related norms to be considered. As can be seen from these examples, exploring parent\u2013child relations in terms of the dual aspects of the DFPM may help to illuminate cultural similarities as well as differences in approaches to parent\u2013child relations.\n\nFrom Indigenous Theory to Cultural Psychology\n\nResearchers initiated indigenous psychology in Chinese societies to overcome shortcomings in the application of Western theory to the local context and to provide actionable results to solve local problems. However, the ultimate academic mission of indigenous psychology is to contribute to development of formal theories with relevance to various cultures (Hwang, 2005). This perspective corresponds to the viewpoint of cultural psychology.\n\nAccording to Shweder et al. (2006) \u201cone mind, many mentalities\u201d argument, cultural psychology has a psychological side and a cultural side. The psychological side examines how individual persons think and act in light of their particular goals, values, and understandings of the world. This side probes the universal part of the human mind. The cultural side entails examination of socially-assisted processes of learning and schema activation that are associated with becoming a member of a particular group. This side investigates the diverse part of human mentalities. In other words, cultural psychology entails reciprocal investigation of the psychological foundations of culture, and the cultural foundations of mind. They are interdependent; culture and psyche make each other up. Context and meaning are theoretically represented as part of the psychological system, and not as external influences or factors.\n\nOur task here is to take the DFPM, developed in a Chinese society from analysis of Chinese historical and philosophical traditions, and bring it into the realm of cultural psychology where it can represent both the deep structure of human functioning to investigate aspects of the universal mind, as well as the surface content of culture reflecting diverse mentalities. In the following, we explain how the notion of filial piety can be re-conceptualized so that the DFPM can be applied more broadly using the approach of cultural psychology.\n\nExamining Parent\u2013Child Relations as a Contextualized Personality Construct\n\nIn our review of the development of the psychology of filial piety, we described a shift in use of the term filial piety. Initially, the term was mostly used to refer to a set of traditional Confucian norms. Cognitive psychologists then investigated it as a series of stages of Confucian moral development. Use of an indigenous psychology approach allowed filial piety to be construed in terms of the dual motivations and processes underlying parent\u2013child relations over the course of a person\u2019s entire lifespan. With this final definition, we propose that filial piety is best characterized as a contextualized personality construct.\n\nContextualized personality refers to \u201cstable patterns of thought, feelings, and behaviors that occur repeatedly within a given context\u201d (Heller et al., 2007, p. 1229). It captures the idea that personality manifests in different ways across various social roles and contexts. Personality is not merely a collection of traits. Personality emerges from the interaction of the individual with the environment, and is expressed in terms of goals and motivations in addition to traits (Dunlop, 2015). These goals or motivations correspond to particular interpersonal relationships or sociocultural contexts. They are person-in-context variables\u2014personality characteristics that are inseparable from the context in which they are pursued (Nasby and Read, 1997). In other words, a contextualized personality construct connects individual-level motivations or goals to their social context.\n\nContextualized personality researchers highlight social roles as ideal for contextualizing personality motivations. Social roles can be organized around the two universal dimensions of affiliation and power (Roberts, 2006), which allow individuals to meet the fundamental human needs of interpersonal relatedness and social belonging. The DFPM uses the parent\u2013child social roles to contextualize these two needs: interpersonal relatedness (reciprocal filial piety) and social belonging (authoritarian filial piety).\n\nA contextualized personality approach to filial piety focuses first on parent\u2013child interaction as the core context for understanding underlying filial motivations. The inherent structure of the parent\u2013child relationship provides the appropriate cues for integrating the various contents of filial norms into the underlying filial psychological mechanisms.\n\nBecause this approach focuses on the psychological mechanisms underlying parent\u2013child relations (a universal context), and not on cultural content, it has the potential for application in any culture. From this perspective, the DFPM can provide a framework for four levels of analysis (see Table 2). It can be used to examine basic individual motives in the context of parent\u2013child relations; the structural properties of the parent\u2013child relationship; social changes in filial norms; and differences across groups or societies in the expression of individual needs, relational structure, and filial norms.\n\nTABLE 2\n\nTable 2. Theoretical implications of the DFPM at different levels of analysis.\n\nIndividual Level\n\nAs a contextualized personality construct, filial piety develops from childhood and has enduring influence on the parent\u2013child relationship. The DFPM identifies two basic universal psychological motives at the individual level: the need for interpersonal relatedness (RFP) and the need for social belonging and collective identity (AFP). Interpersonal relatedness needs correspond to beliefs about the parent\u2013child interpersonal connection as two individuals (not in terms of their social roles). The need for social belonging and for collective identity corresponds to beliefs about adherence to social norms and fitting in to ensure membership within a larger group.\n\nWe provided psychological details pertaining to each type of filial need (as manifest in Chinese societies) in the previous section, so here we provide an example related to elder care that demonstrates the difference in outcome that may occur when individuals interpret the same behavior as motivated by affection as opposed to being motivated by a desire to comply with social norms. A recent study on end-of-life caregiving showed that the reciprocal filial dimension not only correlated with the caregivers\u2019 (adult children\u2019s) reduced burden and stress, but also with the elderly parents\u2019 enhanced self-worth (Chan et al., 2012). RFP has also been shown to correspond to adult children\u2019s intention to remain as caregivers of their parents and the quality of their care (Hsiao and Chiou, 2011). Care attributed to the authoritarian filial dimension was not associated with these positive benefits in either of these studies.\n\nStructural Analysis\n\nThe DFPM captures the horizontal\u2013vertical duality of the parent\u2013child relationship. The reciprocal dimension encapsulates the horizontal aspect of the parent\u2013child dyad. It corresponds to an equal relationship between two particular individuals who can understand each other only through interaction and communication. The authoritarian dimension captures the vertical aspect and relates to the hierarchical relationship between two family roles (parents and child) for which there exist some universal elements (such as the dependence of the child on the parent), and some cultural elements (such as the priority on the parent\u2019s rights in Chinese culture).\n\nThis vertical\u2013horizontal duality of the parent\u2013child relationship can reflect meaningful individual differences in interaction patterns with parents. It is like a personality characteristic that develops naturally in response to the first interpersonal context everyone encounters after birth. We note that these two aspects of parent\u2013child interaction are often entwined in daily life. We distinguish them at a theoretical level in order to parse the possible patterns of parent\u2013child interaction.\n\nThis vertical\u2013horizontal duality has implications at both individual and societal levels. China provides an interesting case example. China\u2019s imperial rulers emphasized authoritarian moralism and deference (AFP) to consolidate their power. Communist leaders initially tried to eradicate these Confucian beliefs to ensure the centrality of the state (An, 2009). More recently, China\u2019s authorities have switched tactics to focus on reciprocal aspects of filial piety in order to address their looming elder-care crisis due to population aging (Xu, 2001). Rather than emphasizing obedience, they now focus on support for aging parents. Because there are no state welfare services, adult children, especially daughters, are being urged to support their elderly parents. The 1980 Marriage Law even gave parents who cannot provide for themselves the right to demand payments from their children (Qi, 2015). In the mid-1980s, China established the Family Support Agreement (FSA), a voluntary contract between older parents and adult children concerning parental provisions. Although the FSA\u2019s moral persuasion is based on filial ethics, violations are subject to legal prosecution (Chou, 2011). Local governments have also enacted provisions such as requiring all adult children to pay their elderly parents a monthly allowance and take them for a monthly haircut.\n\nIn effect, China\u2019s authorities are relying on authoritarian (vertical) means to try to enhance reciprocal (horizontal) filial relations. According to the DFPM, this approach is not likely to be effective, and the evidence bears this supposition out. A study on the FSA found that it erodes spontaneity, flexibility, and affection in the practice of filial piety (elements that correspond to RFP), and thus harms relationships and results in more family lawsuits (Chou, 2011).\n\nSocial Change Analysis\n\nThe DFPM is able to capture changes over time in the endorsement of filial norms within societies, and differences in filial norms across societies. The argument supporting these two levels of analysis is similar. Both the reciprocal and authoritarian dimensions have a psychological basis. But, for the purpose of comparison over time or across cultures, they each correspond to a different prototype.\n\nReciprocal filial piety represents the psychological prototype of filial relations in the sense that it pertains to universal psychological processes relevant to the parent\u2013child context. The psychological functions of filial piety at the individual level connect to the child\u2019s personal motives for filial practices, and represent the deep structure of the filial mind. RFP is thus likely to remain stable over time and to share characteristics across cultures (which we address in the following section).\n\nAuthoritarian filial piety represents the social/cultural prototype of parent\u2013child relations through the parents\u2019 role as a personalized representation of the social/collective authority. Even though the absolute authority of parents often gradually weakens as children grow into adolescence and adulthood, AFP may still reflect internalized role obligations contained in cultural filial norms. Thus, AFP reflects the schema for social belongingness and collective identity associated with becoming a member of a particular group. Accordingly, over time it may evolve with broader social changes. It may also capture meaningful differences across cultures in the surface content of filial norms and beliefs. In other words, AFP is most relevant to understanding the impact of the changing social context on, or cultural differences in, filial relations.\n\nAn example of social change analysis relates to an early insight from application of the DFPM in Chinese societies. Early studies conducted prior to development of the DFPM measured the extent of endorsement of traditional filial norms (such as obedience and deference, which are related to AFP), and thus reported a decline in relevance of filial piety (e.g., Ho and Yu, 1974; Ho, 1996). These studies accurately identified that changing social conditions were connected to changing levels of endorsement of some traditional filial values, but the researchers erred in assuming that the surface content of the traditional norms (related to AFP) represented the whole of filial piety. In fact, studies conducted around the same time that focused solely on intergenerational caring and support (aspects of RFP) did not report a change in endorsement of traditional filial beliefs (e.g., Yeh, 1997; Yue and Ng, 1999).\n\nAnother example comes from a study of Chinese immigrant families in New Zealand. The authors acknowledged that authoritarian aspects of filial relationships may change due to the new context, but noted that relational aspects of filial belief remained consistent (Liu et al., 2000). Recent studies using the DFPM in Chinese societies likewise support the contention that endorsement of authoritarian aspects of filial piety is diminishing (Chow, 2006; Chan et al., 2012). However, these findings do not mean that AFP beliefs are no longer relevant. For example, a 2-year longitudinal study of Chinese adolescents concluded that although participants had a higher level of reciprocal than AFP, AFP still had relevance for understanding parent\u2013child interaction, particularly obedience (Liu, 2013).\n\nCross-Cultural Applications\n\nIn their article conceptualizing psychological universals, Norenzayan and Heine (2005) stated that a psychological phenomenon qualifies as a functional universal if the shape of the relationship between the variables is the same, even if the strength of the pattern differs across cultures. Filial piety meets the requirements of a functional universal when it is conceptualized in terms of a contextualized personality construct. The DFPM encompasses the two universal psychological needs of interpersonal relatedness and social belonging in the universal context of the parent\u2013child relationship. The model provides the structure to link these two motivations to the surface content of filial norms at the collective level, which may vary by culture. As a functional universal, the DFPM can be compared with concepts depicting intergenerational relations in other cultures. In particular, any concepts specifying children\u2019s psychological processes in relating to their parents (such as their beliefs, attitudes, or perceptions of their parents) may correspond to one or both of the dimensions of the DFPM.\n\nIn this section, we review some western concepts of intergenerational relations, and suggest how the DFPM may integrate or extend them. This exercise demonstrates the cross-cultural applicability of the DFPM, and highlights multiple directions for future research on intergenerational relations in Western societies.\n\nFew researchers have considered comparing filial piety and attachment style. Attachment style (Ainsworth and Bell, 1970) fits the conceptual requirements of a functional universal (Norenzayan and Heine, 2005). It can also be seen as a type of contextualized personality concept reflecting the schema of children\u2019s interaction with their parents, so it can be directly compared with the DFPM. In the following, we compare attachment style and the DFPM from three aspects: (1) the mode of interaction with parents, (2) the critical period of development, and (3) children\u2019s developmental task in their relationship with their parents.\n\nFirst, the two frameworks classify interaction modes similarly. Secure attachment style corresponds to the balanced mode of filial operation (high RFP and high AFP). The avoidant attachment style corresponds to the non-filial mode. The ambivalent attachment style could correspond to both the reciprocal and authoritarian modes in that both types of children lack the capacity to balance personalized filial practices based on affection for the parent (RFP) with the social expectations for the role of children (AFP). Thus, children with the reciprocal mode of intergenerational interaction are more likely to be anxious about others\u2019 doubts and criticisms of their personalized filial behaviors. Those with the authoritarian mode are more likely to feel stress due to parents\u2019 extra demands and needs. Even though separation anxiety with parents is not the theoretical focus of the DFPM, the combination of RFP and AFP still covers a wider range of anxiety situations related to interaction with parents.\n\nSecond, according to attachment theory, the only task of a child is to form and maintain a strong bond with the parents until adulthood. In contrast, the DFPM elucidates the nature of the parent\u2013child relationship across the lifespan, and encompasses both horizontal and vertical aspects. There is a major difference in the critical period of development. Attachment theory focuses on the specific interaction style originating in infancy; RFP focuses on the continuous accumulation of mutual understanding between parent and child across the lifespan, and the DFPM recognizes that the parent\u2013child relationship helps children transition into adulthood and emphasizes the importance of a continued relationship with one\u2019s parents after growing up.\n\nThird, according to attachment theory, the major task of children is to strive for individual autonomy from the relationship with their parents (Ainsworth and Bowlby, 1991). In contrast, from the perspective of the DFPM, the major developmental task of children is to form self-volition by integrating numerous social roles, instead of just self-autonomy. The parent\u2013child relationship becomes the basis for establishing other types of social relations or developing a more complex identity comprised of multiple social roles.\n\nThe overlap between attachment styles and filial modes indicates that the DFPM has the potential to incorporate well-known western conceptual counterparts. The differences suggest avenues to extend western intergenerational relations research. Although the influence of attachment style on a person\u2019s subsequent interpersonal relationships has been broadly discussed in the literature, the concept of attachment has rarely been applied to investigate intergenerational interaction between adult children and their parents. Researchers have developed concepts other than attachment to describe intergenerational relations in later life. Some of these concepts regarding adult relationships with parents can also be integrated into the DFPM.\n\nFor example, the concept of intergenerational ambivalence, which refers to the experience of both positive and negative feelings toward parents (Luescher and Pillemer, 1998) can be expressed as an imbalance between RFP and AFP. The concept of (perceived) parental authority is used to predict adolescent life adaptation, social development, and delinquency (Smetana, 2000; Darling et al., 2008). It focuses on the vertical structure of the parent\u2013child relationship as a counterpart to AFP. A third example involves an emerging concept, moral capital (Silverstein et al., 2012). It is defined as the stock of internalized social norms regarding children\u2019s obligation to care for their older parents, and as a set of intergenerationally transmitted values that make up for the insufficiency of relying solely on children\u2019s gratitude or emotional bonds with their parents. Researchers developed this concept to address with the issue of elder care in light of global population aging. Moral capital corresponds to AFP in representing role obligations based on the family hierarchy. It can guarantee children\u2019s support of their parents even with a weak parent\u2013child relationship.\n\nThese concepts that deal with parent\u2013child relations after childhood are similar to AFP in their mechanisms, functions, and theoretical implications. However, Western researchers have not developed corresponding concepts similar to RFP. Findings from application of the DFPM in Chinese societies imply that this may be a fruitful area for future research with respect to elder care. For example, although previous studies in Chinese societies demonstrated beneficial effects of both the reciprocal and authoritarian filial dimensions on intergenerational support for elderly parents, RFP repeatedly corresponded with a stronger and broader effect. In Taiwan, RFP showed a significant positive relation with the frequency of financial support, household labor assistance, and emotional support toward elderly parents. In contrast, AFP only showed a positive relation with the frequency of household labor assistance (Yeh, 2009). Researchers reported similar results in China and Hong Kong using cross-national data from the East Asia Survey (Yeh et al., 2013). This consistent finding has had implications for government policy on elder care. Officials in Taiwan have started to shift away from population aging policies that focus on institutional care (which has not been well-accepted) and toward policies more focused on enhancing RFP over AFP. For example, the Taiwan Ministry of Education (2011) proposed highlighting RFP as the core family value in school curriculum, and the legislature inaugurated National Grandparents Day in 2010 with the goal of facilitating increased daily intergenerational interaction and mutual understanding.\n\nConclusion\n\nFilial piety has provided the moral underpinning for Chinese patterns of intergenerational relations and socialization for millennia. Psychologists in Chinese societies began to investigate filial piety systematically in the past few decades to better understand how the process of societal modernization impacted the content and structure of Chinese people\u2019s psychological make-up. Now, researchers around the world are looking at filial beliefs and norms and parent\u2013child relationships in effort to address the issues surrounding population aging and eldercare.\n\nEarly researchers in Chinese societies defined filial piety in terms of Chinese cultural traditions, limiting the implications of their findings to Chinese societies. Indigenous psychology researchers took a different approach. They integrated findings from Chinese history and philosophy into a psychological model of parent\u2013child relations: the DFPM. Each factor in the model has psychological meaning at the individual level, and also reflects the influence of Chinese historical, societal, and cultural factors. From the perspective of cultural psychology, research that focuses on a universal context, such as the parent\u2013child relationship, can result in insights that reflect the uniqueness of local characteristics as well as universal or shared features (Tsui, 2004).\n\nIn this paper, we proposed that filial piety as conceptualized in the DFPM is a functional universal (Norenzayan and Heine, 2005) contextualized personality construct (Dunlop, 2015). As such, it connects the two universal underlying individual filial motivations to the social role in which they are relevant. From this perspective, the DFPM balances universal human tenets, cultural diversity, and individual differences. It can thus support multiple levels of analysis of intergenerational relationships across life stages, both within and across cultures.\n\nThere is now a solid body of research applying the DFPM in Chinese societies. Findings from this research are being used to shape public policy and programs on elder care. In the wake of global economic disturbances and the weakening ability of governments to sustain social security, many Western states are also exploring the role of the family and filial beliefs and norms in supporting older adults (e.g., Lowenstein and Daatland, 2006; Silverstein et al., 2012). We provided some examples of how researchers can use the DFPM to integrate various concepts proposed by western scholars regarding intergenerational interaction with parents during specific developmental stages or within specific contexts to investigate issues relevant to the parent\u2013child relationship and elder care. We hope that contextualized analysis of issues in Chinese societies and insights from relevant empirical findings based on the DFPM may stimulate research, practical applications, and policy development in other aging societies.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nOB and KY substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work and analysis and interpretation of concepts, revising it critically for important intellectual content, final approval of the version to be published, agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.\n\nConflict of Interest Statement\n\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\nReferences\n\nAn, Y.

His mother, Empress Dowager Bo, was once ill for three years. He attended to his mother each day after dealing with affairs of state. For safety reasons, he would test the medicine before he took it to his mother. When his mother finally recovered, he fell ill because of exhaustion. His benevolence and filial piety were praised throughout the kingdom. During his reign, the population flourished and the country prospered.\n\nDear to him\n\nTan Zi was a viscount in the State of Tan during the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC). His aged parents suffered from eye diseases and needed to drink deer's milk as part of their treatment. He therefore disguised himself in a deerskin and sneaked into a herd of deer in the mountains to obtain deer's milk. Once, when he was taking deer's milk, a hunter mistook him for a deer and was going to shoot him. He revealed himself and told the truth to the hunter. The hunter respected his filial piety and escorted him out of the mountains."}]}
