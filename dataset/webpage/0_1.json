His father gave him the greater part of his general education and University College, London, his medical training. He graduated in 1851 as University scholar and gold medallist in physiology, comparative anatomy and medicine. For so outstanding a student, a great future seemed assured. But his means were slender and he decided to begin practice in Leeds where he had relatives. However, his old teacher Marshall Hall persuaded him to return to London, offering him his house in Grosvenor Street on favourable terms. His enterprise was rewarded by appointments as assistant physician to the Hospital for Sick Children in 1855, the Westminster Hospital in 1857 and University College Hospital in 1859. After a further three years, he became full physician and Holme professor of clinical medicine at University College, and in 1867 he succeeded Jenner in the chair of medicine.\n\nReynolds gave distinguished service to the Royal College of Physicians, being Lumleian Lecturer in 1867, Harveian Orator in 1884, Censor, and finally, from 1893 to 1896, President. He was chosen as Physician to the Royal Household in 1879 and, with his friend, J. E. Erichsen, created a baronet in 1895. He was president of the B.M.A. at the time of his death. But he made his mark in the profession chiefly by his early writings on nervous diseases \u2014 he was one of the first to propound the possibilities of electricity as a therapeutic agent \u2014 and by his editorship of the System of Medicine, published in five volumes between 1866 and 1879. He was a fluent and popular lecturer and a careful and sympathetic physician. Somewhat shy and grave of mien, he could reveal both a quiet humour and a directness of speech that was no respecter of persons. Painting and music were his recreations, and he was well read in literature. He was married, firstly, to a Miss Ainslie and, secondly to Frances, widow of C. J. C. Crespigny, but left no children.

He followed and developed Hughlings Jackson\u2019s original ideas about positive and negative neurological symptoms. His approach to patients was holistic at a time when more objectively defined notions of illness dominated medicine. He wrote on vertigo, and about criminal lunacy, and his book The Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, Nerves and their appendages was a major text of the period.\n\nWell versed in poetry, philosophy, art, and music, he was widely admired. He became President of the Royal College of Physicians.\n\nLike the great Sir Jonathan Hutchinson and other Victorians of privileged stock, Sir John Russell Reynolds (1828\u20131896) (Figure 1) never attended school. His father, a nonconformist minister at Romsey in Hampshire, educated him personally. His grandfather Henry Revell Reynolds (1745-1811), FRS, was an illustrious physician at the Middlesex and St Thomas\u2019s Hospitals and Physician to George III.\n\nFigure 1: Sir J Russell Reynolds. [Published in British Medical Journal, 6 June 1896)\n\nAs a nonconformist he was excluded from Oxford and Cambridge* and read Medicine at University College London, graduating with a gold medal in physiology, comparative anatomy, and medicine in 1851 [1]. An impecunious young doctor, he sought a living, practicing in Leeds where his brother was a Minister of the East Parade Mission Chapel, and his brother-in-law a journalist on the Leeds Mercury.\n\nA year later his former teacher Marshall Hall, FRS. (1790-1857), a physician and brilliant experimental physiologist persuaded him to return to London [2], where at modest cost Hall let him live in his home at 38, Grosvenor Street and join his Consultant practice, mainly in nervous diseases.\n\nOnly four years after graduating Russell Reynolds\u2019 outstanding ability led to his appointment as assistant physician at the Hospital for Sick Children and to the Westminster and University College Hospitals. There he became Holme Professor of Clinical Medicine in 1862, and in 1867 succeeding Sir William Jenner as Professor of Medicine. Just five years after the opening of the National Hospital for the Relief and Cure of Paralysis and Epilepsy, Russell Reynolds showed his interest in neurology and was appointed to its staff. He was elected FRS on 3rd June 1869.\n\nAt this time neurology began to flourish; he worked with many distinguished early neurologists. They included Hughlings Jackson (1835-1911), Jabez Ramskill (1825-1897), Charles Bland Radcliffe (1822\u20131889) who succeeded Brown\u2013S\u00e9quard in 1863, and published Lectures on Epilepsy, Pain, Paralysis, and certain other disorders of the Nervous System, 1864, and articles in Reynolds\u2019s System of Medicine. His brother John Netten Radcliffe (c. 1830-1884), a pioneering epidemiologist, was also Medical Superintendent of the Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic.\n\nNo man works in a vacuum. Marshall Hall, (who in spite of his acknowledged distinction [3] surprisingly had failed to get an academic post in London) inspired and encouraged Reynolds. Amongst contemporary and subsequent notable physicians he influenced were: the erudite Charlton Bastian (1837-1915); Charles Edward Beevor, (1854-1908); Howard Tooth (1856-1925); James Taylor, (1859-1946) editor of Jackson\u2019s Selected Writings; and the punctilious Thomas Buzzard (1831-1919), his neighbour in Grosvenor Street, and friend of both Hughlings Jackson and David Ferrier (1843-1928).\n\nSuch was Reynolds\u2019s reputation that he was rewarded with both the Lumleian and the Harveian lectures at the Royal College of Physicians of London, becoming President from 1893\u20131895. Like his grandfather, he was physician to the royal household in 1879 and was made a baronet in 1895. He was president of the BMA until his death.\n\nA popular and fluent lecturer, he was shy and serious but had a quiet humour and a \u2018directness of speech that was no respecter of persons.\u2019 Described as courteous, shrewd, and kind, his approach was holistic \u2013 long before it became fashionable:\n\nNot to merely make a diagnosis, much less to write a prescription, but to advise the individual patient what he or she should best do to regain their health\u2026 and what changes in the environment, mental, emotional, or physical were most likely to achieve this end. [2]\n\nMedical works\n\nRussell Reynolds is often remembered for his descriptions of epilepsy, eclamptic convulsions, and febrile convulsions in children [4,5]. He also used electrotherapy in various nervous diseases [6].\n\nInterestingly, he is widely quoted for commending the \u201cgreat value of Cannabis indica\u201d in migraine, epileptic conditions, depression, and asthma. In 1890 he prescribed a cannabis tincture for the menstrual cramps suffered by Queen Victoria. He noted in The Lancet:\n\nWhen pure and administered carefully, [cannabis] is one of the most valuable medicines we possess. [7]\n\nOf greater import was his 1861 paper (Figure 2) that espoused the concept of positive and negative neurological symptoms [5,8]. Positive symptoms were abnormal behaviours that included not only clonic jerking and abnormal movements but also hallucinations and paranoid delusions.\n\nSome symptoms are negative, i.e. they consist in the negation of vital properties. Of this kind are paralysis, anaesthesia, and the like\u2026Other symptoms are positive, i.e. they consist in excess or alteration of vital properties. Of this kind are spasms, pain, convulsions and the like\u2026 (p.9-12, 28)\n\nUnfortunately, he failed to write further on this theme. Like Jackson, Russell Reynolds shrewdly noted that the lesion did not directly cause the symptoms observed.\n\nThe origins of positive and negative symptoms were inextricably intertwined with Herbert Spencer\u2019s ideas of dissolution and evolution of the nervous system [9]. Hughlings Jackson extended Spencer\u2019s idea to patients\u2019 symptoms, both positive and negative. Jackson believed that negative symptoms related to the dissolution of neural function while positive symptoms resulted from excitation or the release of lower levels from higher inhibitory control:\n\nSpeaking of the physical side, there are degrees of loss of function of the least organized nervous arrangements with conservation of function of the more organized. There is in each reduction to a more automatic condition; in each there is dissolution, using this term as Spencer does, as the opposite of evolution. [10]\n\nFigure 2. Reynolds: Epilepsy, its symptoms, treatment and relation to other chronic convulsive diseases. 1861\n\nRussell Reynolds wrote his first book on Vertigo. In 1856 he examined legal pleas for insanity in his Criminal Lunatics: are they Responsible? He believed that epilepsy could be a distinct or \u2018idiopathic\u2019 disease, a controversial view well expressed in The Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, Nerves and their appendages in 1855 (dedicated to Marshall Hall), This was later contradicted by Kinnier Wilson who stated that all epileptic events were symptoms, whether or not any underlying pathology could be demonstrated [11].\n\nAlways inclined to a broad approach he described the interictal symptoms of 62 patients with idiopathic epilepsy. He found about one-third had mild impairment of recent memory and a similar proportion had moderate to severe psychopathological findings. His interpretation of epileptic activity (well described by Eadie) [12] was in large measure approved by Hughlings Jackson.\n\nHe edited and wrote many chapters in A system of medicine (London: Macmillan, in five volumes from 1866 to 1879), a major text rivalled only by John Cooke\u2019s Treatise in Nervous Diseases, published in two volumes, in 1820 and 1823, the second volume of Bright\u2019s Reports of Medical Cases 1831, and Romberg\u2019s Manual of the Nervous Diseases of Man 1840 [13].\n\nRussell Reynolds practiced at a time when neurology was in its infancy. It relied on clinical description and elementary pathology. In this morass of evolving knowledge, Reynolds formulated a classification of neurological diseases that remains the kernel of modern systems. His work in neurology linked the highly original physiological and clinical works of his mentor, Marshall Hall, to Hughlings Jackson\u2019s intellectual explorations of the brain\u2019s complex functions and hierarchies, and to the more systematic descriptive neurology of William Gowers [12]. His students included Charlton Bastian (1837-1915) and Sir William Gowers (1845-1915), whose writings often reflect his influence.\n\nLegacy\n\nHe was well versed in poetry, philosophy, art, and music. He was married, first, to Margaret Ainslie, and, secondly, to Frances Crespigny, but left no children. He died aged 68 of \u2018pulmonary congestion\u2019 at his home in 1896.\n\nThe scholarship and clinical advances made by Reynolds can be seen as important influences on contemporary and also later notable neurologists at the National Hospital. He bridged the eras of Victorian Neurology with that of the dawning 20th century.\n\nHe was noted as:\n\nA man of scholarship and wisdom, in his presidential address in 1894, in a spirit of prophecy he warned the subject-ridden student of to day of the danger of becoming entangled in the net of an ill-considered and misunderstood technical phraseology, and of juggling with words when he ought to be dealing with concrete things. [2]\n\nAnd Eadie characterised him as:\n\nA most eminent, scholarly, and influential physician who was greatly respected and admired by his contemporaries\u2026the sort of man whose ideas would not readily be discarded because it might almost seem disrespectful to do so unless a better alternative could be clearly demonstrated to exist. [12]\n\n* So-called dissenters (Catholics, Jews, and Quakers) were denied admission because their religious beliefs prevented their taking an oath to adhere to the 39 articles of the Anglican Church. This was abolished by the Universities Tests Act in 1871.\n\nWomen had studied at Oxford since the 1870s. But until 1921, they were not entitled to claim the degrees they had earned. Cambridge followed in 1947.\n\nReferences\n\nBrown GH. Munk\u2019s Roll. Lives of the Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians of London (1826-1925).

His mother was Caroline Harriets, daughter of Dr Trott. From Westminster School he went to Guy\u2019s Hospital and after two years in practice with his father set up as a full time radiologist in 1920. In World War I he served with the R.A.M.C, in home hospitals until 1917 when he became electrical specialist to the Karachi Brigade in India, returning home in 1919. In 1921 he was appointed physician-in-charge of the X-ray departments of Charing Cross and the National Hospitals; his son, Seymour, succeeded him at Charing Cross in 1946, and he retired from the National Hospital in 1939.\n\nFor many years he was adviser in radiology to the Ministry of Pensions and Supply and an examiner to Cambridge University, the Conjoint Board, the Faculty of Radiologists and the R.A.M.C. On his retirement in 1946 he acted as honorary consulting radiologist to the Charing Cross, National, Samaritan, Bethlem Royal and Lambeth Hospitals, and to the Caernarvon and Anglesey Infirmary.\n\nFrom 1924 he had experimented with methods of cineradiography, pioneering in photofluorography with a very wide aperture camera lens. His success brought worldwide recognition. He was president of the British Institute of Radiology and of the section of radiology of the Royal Society of Medicine, warden of the Fellowship of the Faculty of Radiologists, Hunterian professor of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1936, and was awarded the Antoine Beclere award in Paris in 1957.\n\nIn addition he was made a member of the Canadian Radiological Society, the American Roentgen Ray Society, the New York Roentgen Society, the Association of Physicians of Vienna and the Society of Radiologists of Italy; the Australian College of Radiology elected him a fellow.\n\nHe was the author of many publications, particularly in his specialised field of cineradiography which culminated in the production of the Russell Reynolds cineradiographic unit. His paper on the early history of radiology in Britain was published in Clinical Radiology (1961, 12, 136-42).\n\nReynolds was quiet, unassuming and kindly; his strong personality was shown only in his teaching, which brought him the enthusiasm of students and the deep respect of his colleagues.

Through his art and teaching, he attempted to lead British painting away from the indigenous anecdotal pictures of the early 18th century toward the formal rhetoric of the continental Grand Style. With the founding of the Royal Academy in 1768, Reynolds was elected its first president and knighted by King George III .\n\nBack in Devon in 1746, he painted a large group portrait of the Eliot family (c. 1746/47), which clearly indicates that he had studied the large-scale portrait of the Pembroke family (1634\u201335) by the Flemish Baroque painter Sir Anthony Van Dyck , whose style of portrait painting influenced English portraiture throughout the 18th century. In 1749 Reynolds sailed with his friend Augustus Keppel to Minorca, one of the Balearic Islands off the Mediterranean coast of Spain. A fall from a horse detained him for five months and permanently scarred his lip\u2014the scar being a prominent feature in his subsequent self-portraits. From Minorca he went to Rome, where he remained for two years, devoting himself to studying the great masterpieces of ancient Greco-Roman sculpture and of Italian painting. The impressions that he retained from this visit were to inspire his paintings and his Discourses for the rest of his life, for he felt that it was by allying painting with scholarship that he could best achieve his ambition of raising the status of his profession back in England . While returning home via Florence, Bologna, and Venice, he became absorbed by the compositions and colour of the great Renaissance Venetian painters of the 16th century: Titian, Jacopo Tintoretto, and Paolo Veronese . The Venetian tradition\u2019s emphasis on colour and the effect of light and shading had a lasting influence on Reynolds, and, although all his life he preached the need for young artists to study the sculptural definition of form characteristic of Florentine and Roman painters, his own works are redolent of the Venetian style.\n\nReynolds attended the Plympton grammar school of which his father, a clergyman, was master. The young Reynolds became well read in the writings of classical antiquity and throughout his life was to be much interested in literature, counting many of the finest British authors of the 18th century among his closest friends. Reynolds early aspired to become an artist, and in 1740 he was apprenticed for four years in London to Thomas Hudson , a conventional portraitist and the pupil and son-in-law of Jonathan Richardson. In 1743 he returned to Devon and began painting at Plymouth naval portraits that reveal his inexperience. Returning to London for two years in 1744, he began to acquire a knowledge of the old masters and an independent style marked by bold brushwork and the use of impasto, a thick surface texture of paint, such as in his portrait of Captain the Honourable John Hamilton (1746).\n\nLater years\n\nIn 1753 Reynolds settled in London, where he was to live for the rest of his life. His success was assured from the first, and by 1755 he was employing studio assistants to help him execute the numerous portrait commissions he received. The early London portraits have a vigour and naturalness about them that is perhaps best exemplified in a likeness of Honourable Augustus Keppel (1753\u201354). The pose is not original, being a reversal of the Apollo Belvedere, an ancient Roman copy of a mid-4th-century-bc Hellenistic statue Reynolds had seen in the Vatican. But the fact that the subject (who was a British naval officer) is shown striding along the seashore introduced a new kind of vigour into the tradition of English portraiture. In these first years in London, Reynolds\u2019s knowledge of Venetian painting is very apparent in such works as the portraits of Lord Cathcart (1753/54) and Lord Ludlow (1755). Of his domestic portraits, those of Nelly O\u2019Brien (1760\u201362) and of Georgiana, Countess Spencer, and her daughter (1761) are especially notable for their tender charm and careful observation.\n\nBritannica Quiz Can You Match These Lesser-Known Paintings to Their Artists?\n\nAfter 1760 Reynolds\u2019s style became increasingly classical and self-conscious. As he fell under the influence of the classical Baroque painters of the Bolognese school of the 17th century and the archaeological interest in Greco-Roman antiquity that was sweeping Europe at the time, the pose and clothes of his sitters took on a more rigidly antique pattern, in consequence losing much of the sympathy and understanding of his earlier works.\n\nThere were no public exhibitions of contemporary artists in London before 1760, when Reynolds helped found the Society of Artists and the first of many successful exhibitions was held. The patronage of George III was sought, and in 1768 the Royal Academy was founded. Although Reynolds\u2019s painting had found no favour at court, he was the obvious candidate for the presidency, and the king confirmed his election and knighted him. Reynolds guided the policy of the academy with such skill that the pattern he set has been followed with little variation ever since. The yearly Discourses that he delivered at the academy clearly mirrored many of his own thoughts and aspirations, as well as his own problems of line versus colour and public and private portraiture, and gave advice to those beginning their artistic careers.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nFrom 1769 nearly all of Reynolds\u2019s most important works appeared in the academy. In certain exhibitions he included historical pieces, such as Ugolino (1773), which were perhaps his least successful works. Many of his child studies are tender and even amusing, though now and again the sentiment tends to be excessive. Two of the most enchanting are Master Crewe as Henry VIII (1775\u201376) and Lady Caroline Scott as \u2018Winter\u2019 (1778). His most ambitious portrait commission was the Family of the Duke of Marlborough (1777).\n\nIn 1781 Reynolds visited Flanders and Holland, where he studied the work of the great Flemish Baroque painter Peter Paul Rubens. This seems to have affected his own style, for in the manner of Rubens\u2019s later works the texture of his picture surface becomes far richer. This is particularly true of his portrait of the duchess of Devonshire and her daughter (1786). Reynolds was never a mere society painter or flatterer. It has been suggested that his deafness gave him a clearer insight into the character of his sitters, the lack of one faculty sharpening the use of his eyes. His vast learning allowed him to vary his poses and style so often that the well-known remark of Thomas Gainsborough, \u201cDamn him, how various he is!\u201d is entirely understandable. In 1782 Reynolds had a paralytic stroke, and about the same time he was saddened by bickerings within the Royal Academy. Seven years later his eyesight began to fail, and he delivered his last Discourse at the academy in 1790. He died in 1792 and was buried in St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral."}], "John Russell Reynolds was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge.": [{"url": "https://history.rcplondon.ac.uk/inspiring-physicians/sir-john-russell-reynolds", "page_content": "Russell Reynolds was born at Romsey in Hampshire, the son of John Reynolds, a nonconformist minister, and grandson of Henry Revell Reynolds, F.R.C.P, physician to the Middlesex and St. Thomas\u2019s Hospitals and Physician-in-Ordinary to George III. His father gave him the greater part of his general education and University College, London, his medical training. He graduated in 1851 as University scholar and gold medallist in physiology, comparative anatomy and medicine. For so outstanding a student, a great future seemed assured. But his means were slender and he decided to begin practice in Leeds where he had relatives. However, his old teacher Marshall Hall persuaded him to return to London, offering him his house in Grosvenor Street on favourable terms. His enterprise was rewarded by appointments as assistant physician to the Hospital for Sick Children in 1855, the Westminster Hospital in 1857 and University College Hospital in 1859. After a further three years, he became full physician and Holme professor of clinical medicine at University College, and in 1867 he succeeded Jenner in the chair of medicine.\n\nReynolds gave distinguished service to the Royal College of Physicians, being Lumleian Lecturer in 1867, Harveian Orator in 1884, Censor, and finally, from 1893 to 1896, President. He was chosen as Physician to the Royal Household in 1879 and, with his friend, J. E. Erichsen, created a baronet in 1895. He was president of the B.M.A. at the time of his death.

Somewhat shy and grave of mien, he could reveal both a quiet humour and a directness of speech that was no respecter of persons. Painting and music were his recreations, and he was well read in literature. He was married, firstly, to a Miss Ainslie and, secondly to Frances, widow of C. J. C. Crespigny, but left no children.

Ian Fleming took the traditional route to the school \u2013 he was the son of an old Etonian army major \u2013 but failed to perform academically and was removed from the school by his mother before he could fail to graduate. He did at least kick off his writing career at Eton, publishing his first story in the school magazine The Wyvern. Fleming also named the Bond villain Blofeld after an old classmate, but his feelings for Eton are best encapsulated in the James Bond All Purpose Grand Challenge Trophy Vase he presented to the Old Etonian Golfing Society \u2013 which was in fact a chamber pot.\n\nFleming isn't the only writer to have a complicated relationship with the school. George Orwell, who attended on a scholarship and whose old school tie didn't quite fit such a man of the people, later disdained Eton, saying that although he was \"relatively happy\" at the school, he \"did no work there and learned very little\". In his 1941 essay The Lion and the Unicorn, he wrote that \"probably the Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton, but the opening battles of all subsequent wars have been lost there. One of the dominant facts in English life during the past three-quarters of a century has been the decay of ability in the ruling class.\" The school, undeterred, maintains the Orwell Award in his name, offering fully funded places \"to talented boys whose life opportunities have been limited.\"\n\n'A place of extremes'\n\nEven for writers who didn't attend Eton, it has provided inspiration. John le Carr\u00e9 taught there for a year and described it as \"a place of extremes\" where \"the English upper class can be seen at their best and worst. The good pupils are often brilliant [\u2026] and take you to the limits of your knowledge. The worst pupils,\" he added, \"provide a unique insight into the criminal mind.\" These were \"riches\" for a novelist, and le Carr\u00e9 used Eton as inspiration for the fictional school Carne in his novel A Murder of Quality.\n\nOr take the case of Evelyn Waugh, the envious outside chronicler of the upper class, who probably wished he'd gone to Eton instead of the humbler Lancing College. And in a typical act of one-up-manship, he sent his character Sebastian Flyte there in his most nostalgic novel Brideshead Revisited. \"Thank God I went to Eton,\" sighs Sebastian during an obscure philosophical argument between family and friends. Sebastian, significantly, starts the book as the epitome of glamour but undergoes a decline as the story proceeds. (Waugh's mixed feelings about Eton may also have been coloured by the fact that his first wife, also called Evelyn, had an affair with an old Etonian.)"}, {"url": "https://www.roll-of-honour.com/Cambridgeshire/CambridgeUniversityTinityCollegeWW1.html", "page_content": "CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY, TRINITY COLLEGE WORLD WAR 1 WAR MEMORIAL World War 1 - Roll of Honour with detailed information\n\nCompiled and copyright \u00a9 Gill Cannell & Andrew Dishman 2009 The Cambridge University, Trinity College World War 1 memorial is in the form of Trinity College Chapel at the east end of which, either side of the altar, there are oak panels are engraved with the 619 names of those who died in the First World War.

She sank in 55 minutes after hitting a mine 4 miles off the Greek island of Kea, on her way back to Lemnos from Southampton via Gibraltar and fortunately empty of passengers. 30 lives were lost, many of these when two lifeboats, prematurely launched, drifted into the still-turning propellers, 1,036 were saved.

Chairman of Cambridge Scientific Instrument Co, by his wife, the Hon Emma Cecilla (Ida) nee Farrer, only daughter of Thomas Henry, 1st Lord Farrer and grandson of Charles Darwin. Born Cambridge 7-12-1881, educated at Horris Hill and Marlborough (Cotton House) and gained an exhibition for Mathematics at Trinity College,Cambridge. He went up to Trinity in October 1901 and took the mathematical Tripos in his second year being placed among the senior Optimes. Afterwards he took the mechanical sciences Tripos and was placed in the second class in 1905. On leaving Cambridge he went through the shops at Messrs Mather and Platts at Manchester. After this he worked for some little while with the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Co., of which he was a director, and then became assistant secretary of Bocklow Vaughan and Co Ltd at Middlesborough. Here he stayed for seven years and at the outbreak of war occupied the postion of secretary to the company. As soon as war broke out he decided to join the army and on 12-9-14 was gazetted 2nd Lieut in the 4th (Territorial) battalion of the Yorkshires, which after training at Darlington and Newcastle crossed to France, as part of the Northumbria division on 17-4-15 and was within a week called upon to take part in the second battle of Ypres. Here these Territorial troops fresh from home and tried at the very outset almost as highly as men could be tried, behaved with a steadiness and coolness which gained for them the congratulations of the generals commanding their division and their army corps. Early on the morning of the 24-4-15 the battalion was ordered to attack the village of Fortuin, close to St Julien where the Germans had broken through. This attack they successfully carried out in the face of terrific shellfire, being ordered to retire at dusk. By driving the enemy back a mile or more they had attained their object which was to prevent a breach in the line, and they hade made good their front with the Canadians and Royal Irish on their right. It was during this advance that Darwin fell, killed instantaneously. His Commanding Officer, Colonel Bell wrote of him \"Loyalty, Courage and Devotion to duty - he had them all .... He died in an attack which gained many compliments to the battalion. He was right in front. It was a mans death\". Corporal Wearmouth, who was in his platoon wrote \"I am a section leader in his platoon and when we got the order to advance he proved himself a hero. He nursed us men, in fact the comment was, you would say we were on a field day. We had got to within twenty yards of our halting place when he turned to our platoon to say something. As he turned he fell, and I am sure he never spoke. As soon as I could I went to him but he was beyond human aid. Our platoon sadly miss him, as he could not do enough for us, and we are all extremely sorry for you, in your great loss\". Private Wood wrote to a friend in Middlesborough \"I would expect you would know poor Mr. Darwin .... I was in his platoon and I can tell you he died a hero. He led us absolutely regardless of the bullets from the German Maxim guns and snipers that whistled all around him\". Just before he left England, when his battalion was under orders for the front, he was summoned to the war office and offered a staff appointment at home in connection with munitions of war. This would have given great scope to his capabilities. \"It would have been interesting and important work\" he wrote \"but of course there are plenty of older men who can do it just as well as I can\". He felt that at the moment his place should be with his Regiment and made, in the words of one present at the interview, a fine appeal to be allowed to go with his men. It was granted and he went gladly with no looking back. The Times (30-4-15) said of him \"Erasmus Darwin would, if he had lived, have added fresh distinction to the name of his familyin a walk of life in which it has never before figured. Between Cambridge and a great iron works in the north there is something of a gulf fixed and one who knew Darwin only in his Cambridge home cannot say anything more than that all that met him in business conceived a very high opinion of his grasp of the subject, his acuteness and administrative ability. It was indeed impossibe to know him without realising that he combined with intellectual ability a calm, sound and practical judgement, and a general capacity for doing things well and thoroughly. He had, too, what must have been invaluable to him in his work, a most genuine sympathy with and affection for working men, and this quality, which, amongst so many other things, had made him love his work at Middlesborough, gave him intense pleasure when soldiering came to him as a wholly new and unlooked for esperience. He delighted in the men, and especially in long expeditions across the moors with his scouts. There is one more quality as to which all his friends would agree, namely a conscientiousness that was eminently sane and wide minded and completely unswerving. No one in the world was more certain what to do what he believd to be right. DAVIDSON Norman R [1897] Lieutenant-Col., R.H.A.; G.S.O. D.S.O. and Bar. Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel. M3.

He was educated at Charterhouse and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took his degree in Science in 1900. At Cambridge he rowed head of the river, was in the trial eights, also fenced for his University against Oxford. He joined the Royal Artillery in May, 1900, and served in both Horse and Field Batteries, retiring in 1909, and, voluntarily joining the Reserve of Officers in August, 1914, in the following month was gazetted to the Special Reserve, Royal Field Artillery, as Lieutenant. His Commanding Officer wrote as follows : \"Lieutenant Donaldson was shot through the head and killed instantaneously in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle on the 10th March, 1915, and was buried near the trench in which he fell. At the time of his death he was observing Officer for the battery in the trenches. There was no more gallant, unselfish, indefatigable officer in the Army, and he was loved by all the officers and men who served with him. The battery could not have suffered a greater loss. In order better to follow and report on the progress of the attack, he had shown himself above the parapet, with the regardlessness of personal danger that characterised him, though he was never unnecessarily reckless In this respect. The last messages from him were to say that we had gained the German trenches, and that the fire of our battery was effective.\" He was mentioned in Sir John French's Despatch of 31st May, 1915, and his battery's share in the success of the bombardment was fully recognised in all the orders. Hie married, in 1912, Dorothea, daughter of Mr. J. Freeman, of Shepperton.

It was there that she became a matron and met William Parker Brooke, whom she married and with whom she moved to Rugby. She was a dominant figure in Rupert Brooke\u2019s life. After his death she had an interest in his literary estate and liaised with his biographers.\n\nBrooke, Richard (1881-1907)\n\nRupert Brooke\u2019s older brother, Richard, sometimes referred to as \u2018Dick\u2019, was born in 1881. Richard was the first of the three brothers to leave home. Rupert went to see him in London and Southsea whenever he could. On 13 January 1907, Richard, who had been working for a firm of engineers, died of pneumonia.\n\nBrooke, Rupert Chawner (1887-1915)\n\nRupert Chawner Brooke was born on 3 August 1887, in Rugby, Warwickshire. He was the second of three sons of William Parker Brooke, a schoolmaster at Rugby School, and Mary Ruth Brooke. He attended a preparatory school called Hillbrow, as a day boy, from 1897 to 1901. It was there that he met James Strachey. James remained one of his closest friends for most of his life. After Hillbrow, Brooke joined School Field House at Rugby, which was his father\u2019s house. There Brooke met Geoffrey Keynes. Both James and Geoffrey had older brothers who became members of the famous Bloomsbury group, most of whom were writers, artists and intellectuals. They were not his only link with the Bloomsbury group though. Rupert also met Virginia Stephen on a childhood holiday. She went on to marry Leonard Woolf and lead a successful career as a writer and a publisher, also being central to the Bloomsbury group.\n\nAttending the school his father was master of, Rupert Brooke distinguished himself in various ways, including growing his hair longer than most of the other boys had theirs. While at Rugby, Brooke won the school prize for his poem \u2018Bastille\u2019. His interest in poetry was encouraged by his family. His mother had been so proud that his poem \u2018The Pyramids\u2019, written a year earlier, had received a special mention in a competition that she had it printed. His Aunt Fanny\u2019s gifts included volumes of poetry by Keats. He also became friends with St. John Welles Lucas-Lucas, who introduced him to the work of Oscar Wilde.\n\nIn 1906, Rupert Brooke came up to Cambridge, becoming a member of King\u2019s College, where his father had been the first non-Etonian Fellow. His uncle, Alan England Brooke was Dean, later to be Provost (head of the College). Despite his family\u2019s strong association with the College, it seems it took Rupert a while to settle in. His letters and poems show that youth and aesthetics were among his primary concerns. He described the people he met in Cambridge as \u2018dull old people\u2019. It has also been suggested that the move to Cambridge came as a culture shock, due to the situation he had been in while at School Field House. Like most students, Rupert Brooke had to get used to being away from his parents but previously his home had also been his school. He would have had to adjust to the relative anonymity of his new life or find new ways to stand out.\n\nAlthough he \u2018matriculated\u2019, or to put it another way, joined the University, to study Classics, his first love was English literature, which he focussed on later in his degree. He led an active life outside of lectures. As well as writing poetry, he developed a keen interest in drama. He had attended theatrical productions such as Peter Pan and thoroughly enjoyed them, so he relished the opportunity to take the stage in student productions at Cambridge. He played a herald in a production of the Greek play \u2018Eumenides\u2019, as well as taking an active role in the Marlowe Society in its early days. Considering himself a socialist, he joined a society called the Fabians, with his friend and fellow Kingsman Hugh Dalton.\n\nBrooke\u2019s popularity and links with figures like Keynes and Strachey, led to him becoming an \u2018Apostle\u2019. The Apostles are a secret society in Cambridge, most of whose members were at King\u2019s College or Trinity College. At that time, they met and read papers to each other. Certain Apostles became Rupert Brooke\u2019s closest friends in later life, not least Edward Marsh.\n\nRupert Brooke completed his B.A. in 1909, gaining a second class in both parts of the Tripos. Though he was said to have been disappointed not to achieve a first, this did not dampen his interest in literature.\n\nIn the summer of 1909, Brooke moved out of the town, to the nearby village of Grantchester, where he seems to have been happier. At first he lived at The Orchard. There he discovered a love of the outdoors. Virginia Woolf famously boasted of having gone skinny-dipping with him, in the river at Grantchester. He was closer to another group of friends though, who Woolf called the \u2018neo-pagans\u2019, possibly due to their love of the outdoors. This group included Rupert Brooke, Katherine Cox, the Olivier sisters, Jacques and Gwen Raverat, Frances Cornford and Justin Brooke. Despite sharing the same surname, Justin Brooke was not a relative of Rupert\u2019s.\n\nBiographers have given different accounts of Rupert Brooke\u2019s sexuality, although it seems he was bisexual. It is now thought that his earliest affections were for boys at Rugby. It has been suggested that he first showed an interest in women at the age of twenty. His complicated relationships included one with Katherine Cox, known to her friends as Ka.\n\nOn 24 January 1910, William Parker Brooke, Rupert\u2019s father, passed away. This meant that Rupert had to perform the duties of Housemaster at School House, Rugby, temporarily. His letters at this time suggest that while he understood what he ought to do, he was sorry to miss out on all of the activities he\u2019d otherwise have done in Cambridge.\n\nIn August 1910, the Old Vicarage, Grantchester, became his new home.\n\nIn 1911 Brooke published his first \u2018volume\u2019, or book, of poems. Some of these poems were written during a three month trip to the continent earlier that year. In a caf\u00e9 in Berlin, while visiting his friend Dudley Ward, Brooke wrote \u2018The Old Vicarage, Grantchester\u2019. The trip also included visits to Munich and Florence. As with previous visits to the continent, such as family trips to Italy, Brooke immersed himself in the local culture but still felt homesick.\n\nThe following year he helped Edward Marsh plan the first of his Georgian Poetry anthologies (named for the young poets who achieved renown under King George Vth). He was also working on a short play called \u2018Lithuania\u2019, which was first performed in 1916, after Brooke\u2019s death.\n\nBrooke\u2019s complicated love-life is said to have brought on a nervous breakdown in 1912. Ka Cox is thought to have had a miscarriage and Brooke felt jealous when James Strachey\u2019s brother Lytton encouraged Ka to see Henry Lamb. His correspondence of this time has been described as rather coarse, expressing some views we would not consider acceptable by today\u2019s standards.\n\nBrooke\u2019s dissertation \u2018John Webster and the Elizabethan drama\u2019 gained him his Fellowship at King\u2019s College, in 1913.\n\nRupert left for Canada and the United States in May 1913. During his travels, he wrote for the Westminster Gazette. Although he is best known for his poetry, these examples of his prose were published posthumously as Letters from America. On his way back to Britain, he broke his journey with a tour of the South Seas, during which he had an affair with a Tahitian woman called Taatamata. There are some suggestions that she bore his child. He returned in June 1914, not long before he went to war.\n\nWhen the war started, Brooke was keen to enlist. Geoffrey Keynes claimed that Rupert Brooke was jealous of him for having received a commission first. The extent to which Brooke experienced the hardships of war has been disputed. He received a commission as a Sub-Lieutenant in the Hood Battalion of the Royal Naval Division. He may have received this through the help of Edward Marsh, who had introduced him to Winston Churchill and the Asquith family. At this time, Brooke regularly wrote to Violet Asquith, whose father was Prime Minister. Brooke\u2019s Battalion also included a member of the Asquith family. Thereafter he served at Antwerp. After Antwerp he wrote his five war sonnets, published as 1914. He trained for a winter at Blandford Camp and then joined the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force in February of 1915. While sailing for Gallipoli, he suffered from sunstroke and blood poisoning. He died aboard a French hospital ship on the following 23 April and was buried on the Greek island of Skyros.\n\nWilliam Parker Brooke, Rupert Brooke\u2019s father, was the second son of the Rev. Canon Richard England Brooke, Rector of Bath, and Harriet Brooke (n\u00e9e Hopkins). He was educated at Kidderminster, then Haileybury. After finishing school he matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, although he soon transferred to King\u2019s College, where his brothers H.R. Brooke and Arthur England Brooke had studied. He gained a B.A. in 1873 and an M.A. in 1876. In 1873, he became a Fellow (senior academic) of King\u2019s College. In the same year, he became Assistant Master at Fettes College, in Edinburgh. It was at a social gathering there that he met Mary Ruth Cotterill, the sister of Charles Clement Cotterill, master of Glencorse house, Fettes. She was a matron at Glencorse. After marrying Mary Ruth Cotterill in 1879, he became Master of School Field House at Rugby.\n\nBrooke, William Alfred Cotterill \u2018Podge\u2019 (1891-1915)\n\nAlfred, or \u2018Podge\u2019 as he was known to his family, was Rupert Brooke\u2019s younger brother. Like Rupert, Alfred was educated at Rugby and King\u2019s College, Cambridge. He was admitted to King\u2019s in 1909, where he studied History. After graduating, in 1912, he went to London to work in business. He left this to serve in the 8th City of London (Post Office) Rifles during the Great War and was killed in action on 14 June 1915.\n\nChurchill, Winston (1874-1965)\n\nWinston Churchill was born on 30 November 1874. After attending the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, Winston Churchill gained a commission in the 4th Hussars in February 1895 and first saw shots fired in action on his 21st birthday. He quickly became a popular and well paid war reporter. He joined Kitchener\u2019s army in Egypt.\n\nHe resigned the army in 1899 to become a politician but was unsuccessful so went to South Africa as a war correspondent. In the Boers, he was captured and held as a prisoner of war. He quickly escaped to Durban, gained a reputation as a hero and regained a military commission from the Commander-in-Chief. He continued to write.\n\nChurchill was first elected as an MP in 1900. He became the Conservative Member for Oldham in February 1901 but after four years he changed party, moving to the Liberals. He soon took his place in the Cabinet, becoming President of the Board of Trade in 1908 and acting as Home Secretary in 1910-11. He was First Lord of the Admiralty in 1911-1915. He was much criticised for his part in planning the Gallipoli Campaign (25 April 1915 and 9 January 1916), during which many soldiers fell. Rupert Brooke died of blood poisoning on his way there.\n\nIn the early 1920s, Churchill rejoined the Conservative party. He served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1924 until 1929. When war broke our in September 1939, he was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty again. Churchill became Prime Minister on 10 May 1940 and held this position until 1945. He served a second term as Prime Minister from 1951 to 55.\n\nRecently, he has been remembered as a family man. He married Clemente Hozier in autumn 1908 and they had five children.\n\nBorn in Cambridge on 30 March 1886, the poet Frances Cornford was the daughter of Sir Francis Darwin and Ellen Wordsworth Crofts, a lecturer in English at Newnham College, Cambridge. Frances\u2019 father, a lecturer in Botany at Cambridge, was the third son of Charles Darwin. In the summer of 1908, Frances took part in the Marlowe Dramatic Society\u2019s play Comus, during which she met Francis Macdonald Cornford, whom she married the following year. Conduit Head, their house in Cambridge, became popular with artists and men of letters. Frances\u2019 first book of poems was published in 1910. Accolades include being awarded the queen\u2019s medal for poetry in 1959.\n\nCornford, Francis Macdonald (1874\u20131943)\n\nFrancis Cornford was born at Eastbourne, in Sussex, on 27 February 1874. His parents were the Revd James Cornford and Mary Emma Macdonald. He was educated at St Paul\u2019s School, then Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied Classics.\n\nHe supported the May 1897 campaign for women to receive degrees from Cambridge, although that proved unsuccessful.\n\nAt Cambridge, he became friends with Jane Harrison. It was she who introduced Francis Cornford to Frances Darwin, whom he married in July 1909. They had a daughter called Helena in 1913 and later they had a son called (Rupert) John Cornford.\n\nFrances had been intrigued by an article he wrote entitled Microcosmographia academica, which took a light view of university politics. Initially it had been published anonymously. They got to know each other better as members of the Marlowe Society. Frances and Gwen Darwin persuaded the producers Rupert Brooke and Justin Brooke to cast Francis Cornford in the lead role of Comus.\n\nDuring the First World War, Francis Cornford became a musketry instructor at Grantham, in Lincolnshire.\n\nFrancis Cornford\u2019s academic career was in the study and lecturing of ancient philosophy.\n\nCotterill, Erica\n\nErica Cotterill was Rupert Brooke\u2019s cousin. Her father, Charles Clement Cotterill, was Mary Ruth Brooke\u2019s brother and a housemaster of Glencorse house, at Fettes School. Rupert Brooke\u2019s father was also a teacher at Fettes, before moving to Rugby. She sometimes had meals with the boys at School Field house, at Rugby. She had asked to borrow the manuscript of Rupert Brooke\u2019s first poem, The Pyramids. In May 1904, Rupert Brooke wrote to her, describing his first experience of meeting a poet. The anonymous poet was St John Lucas. They continued to write to each other and at times she was a confidante for Brooke, for example when he told her about his first few days at King\u2019s College, Cambridge.\n\nCotterill, Mary Ruth\n\nSee Brooke, Mary Ruth.\n\nCox, Katherine Laird \u2018Ka\u2019\n\nKa Cox\u2019s father was Henry Fisher Cox, a Fabian (member of the socialist Fabian Society) but also a successful stockbroker. Her mother died young. Ka had two sisters, Hester and Margaret. Her father remarried and had two more daughters. He died in 1905. At the time, she was 18 years old and became financially independent as a result.\n\nShe was a Neo-Pagan (a group of friends known for their Fabianism and enjoyment of the outdoors) and Rupert Brooke got to know her through Jacques Raverat and Justin Brooke. Rupert Brooke and Ka Cox worked together on the Young Fabians.\n\nRupert Brooke and Ka Cox were lovers and had a complicated relationship, which is said to have caused Brooke to have a nervous breakdown in 1912. Ka Cox is thought to have had a miscarriage and Brooke felt jealous when James Strachey\u2019s brother Lytton encouraged Ka to see a painter named Henry Lamb.\n\nAlthough the Neo-Pagans and the Bloomsbury group knew each other, they were quite distinct groups. Despite that, Ka Cox (Neo-Pagan) and Virginia Woolf (member of the Bloomsbury group) were close friends.\n\nDalton, (Edward) Hugh Neale (1887-1962)\n\nHugh Dalton was born at The Gnoll, near Neath, in Glamorgan, on 26 August 1887. After going to St George\u2019s choir school at Windsor, he attended Eton College. In 1906, he matriculated at King\u2019s College, Cambridge, where he studied mathematics. There he became friends with Rupert Brooke and together they joined the Fabian Society (a socialist society founded in 1884, which has strong links to the Labour party).\n\nThough he had matriculated in mathematics at Cambridge, in 1910 he was awarded an upper-second class degree in Economics. He moved to London that autumn to train in law at the Middle Temple. The following year he began his doctorate at the London School of Economics. In May 1914, he became a barrister and also married Ruth Fox.\n\nDuring the First World War, he served in the Army Service Corps, before transferring to the Royal Artillery.\n\nIn 1920, he became a reader (a senior academic/lecturer) in economics at the London School of Economics. His research focussed on inequalities of income.\n\nIn 1924, he was elected as MP for Camberwell (Peckham division). Between 1929 and 1931, then 1935 and 1959, he represented the Bishop Auckland division as their MP. In 1925 he joined the shadow cabinet and the following year he was elected to the Labour Party\u2019s national executive committee, which oversees the strategies and policies of the Labour Party. In 1935, he became the Labour Party\u2019s foreign affairs spokesman.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Prime Minister Winston Churchill made Hugh Dalton responsible for economic warfare, which meant preventing the enemy from getting supplies. In 1942, he was moved to the Board of Trade. Then, in 1945, he was moved to the Treasury, where he served as Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nIn his memoirs, Hugh Dalton said of Rupert Brooke that \u2018the radiance of his memory still lights my path\u2019. He bequeathed his papers concerning Rupert Brooke to King\u2019s College.\n\nDarwin, Frances Crofts\n\nSee Cornford, Frances Crofts.\n\nDent, Edward (1876-1957)\n\nEdward Dent was born at Ribson Hall, Wetherby, Yorkshire, on 16 July 1876. After studying at Eton College, he went up to King\u2019s College, Cambridge. Initially, he studied classics, gaining a third in part one of the Tripos in 1898. His primary interest was music and he gained a MusB in 1899.\n\nHe was a Fellow at King\u2019s College from 1902 until 1908, lecturing on music history. He also taught composition. His first book was Alessandro Scarlatti, published in 1905. He became professor of music at the University of Cambridge in 1926, holding this post until 1941. His interest was international music, in fact he made controversial remarks about Elgar. He brought the music of Mozart to a British audience, when it was largely unknown here. He translated his operas, as well as those of Verdi and certain other composers.\n\nAs a music critic, he wrote for The Athenaeum (which became The Nation and Athenaeum), as well as Cambridge magazines. He was active in the British Music Society and was a key figure in the International Society of Contemporary Music, acting as its first president. He served on the board of directors of Sadler\u2019s Wells Theatre and the Covent Garden Opera Trust. He was also the first President of the Liszt Society. He gained honorary doctorates from Oxford, Harvard and Cambridge universities. He died on 22 August 1957, at his home in London.\n\nDickinson, Goldsworthy Lowes \u2018Goldie\u2019 (1862\u20131932)\n\n\u2018Goldie\u2019, as his friends knew him, was the son of Lowes Cato Dickinson (1819\u20131908), a London-based portrait painter, described as a Christian socialist. Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson was educated at Charterhouse and King\u2019s College, Cambridge, where he studied Classics. He became a Fellow of the College in 1887, then Librarian from 1893-96 and Lecturer from 1896. He was also a member of the Apostles, a secret Cambridge debating society. He was a prolific writer but is best known as an advocate of the League of Nations, perhaps even having formed the idea behind its creation. He was a close friend of E.M. Forster and though not a member of the Bloomsbury group, he was associated with many of its members.\n\nEckersley, Arthur\n\nArthur Eckersley was a dramatist and a contributor to Punch. He accompanied St John Lucas to visit Rupert Brooke in May 1904, just after Brooke had written The Pyramid.\n\nForster, Edward Morgan (1879-1970)\n\nMorgan Forster, as his friends knew him, was born on 1 January 1879. The following year, his father, Edward Morgan Llewellyn (Eddie) Forster, died and left sufficient money for him and his mother, Alice Clara (Lily) Forster, to live comfortably without the need for work.\n\nMorgan Forster claimed his mother was smothering during his childhood. In 1890, Forster went to board at Kent House, an Eastbourne preparatory school, but his mother soon moved to Tonbridge, allowing him to become a day student. There he developed a love of Classics, winning a prize in Latin verse and English essay prizes. He came up to King\u2019s College, Cambridge, in 1897, where he gained a second in the Classical Tripos and where Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson became a mentor to him.\n\nAs a student, he contributed to the King\u2019s College magazine, Basileon, as well as starting to write a novel entitled Nottingham Lace, which he abandoned. He was also a member of the Apostles, a secret Cambridge debating society. Having gained a second class degree, he stayed for a fourth year to study history and then decided to travel with his mother.\n\nFirst they went to Florence, in October 1901, which inspired his novel A Room with a View. They saw northern Italy and Austria before returning to London, where they lived in a hotel in Bloomsbury and Forster taught a weekly Latin class at the working men\u2019s college in Great Ormond Street. He also went on a cruise around the Greek islands with fellow Kingsmen. It was then that he began to realise that he liked the companionship of other men. He had a chaste relationship with Hugh Owen Meredith.\n\nForster applied to the Cambridge University local lecturers board and between 1903 and 1911 he gave eleven courses entitled \u2018The republic of Florence\u2019 in various parts of East Anglia. A piece he wrote on Greece and a short story were published, and he worked on an early draft of A Room with a View. He moved to Weybridge, in Surrey, in 1904. It was there that he wrote his six novels. In spring 1905, he became a tutor in Germany. That summer, a short story was published in instalments in the Independent Review and that October his first novel, Where Angels Fear to Tread, was published.\n\nHe continued to write novels and his social circle expanded to include Edward Marsh, Rupert Brooke and many of the Bloomsbury group. A couple of years later, he taught Latin to Syed Ross Masood, a young Indian who was about to go to Oxford. He felt he loved him but knew it was not mutual. The publication of A Room with a View in 1908 made Forster famous. He began to work on Maurice but did not allow it to be published until after his death, as it was a homosexual love story written at a time when homosexuality was illegal.\n\nAfter eight years of writing novels, he stopped writing and went to India, with Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson and R.C. Trevelyan as travel companions. In October 1912, they stayed with Masood and his family at Aligarh, then they spent Christmas with a friend from King\u2019s College, called Malcolm Darling, and visited Masood in Bankipore. Around this time, Forster developed the idea for A Passage to India, which he wrote after returning to Weybridge. It is thought that the fictional city of Chandrapore in that novel is based on Bankipore.\n\nAfter working part-time in the cataloguing department of the National Gallery, in October 1915 he went to Alexandria with the Red Cross, to search for missing soldiers. A poet called C.P. Cavafy then introduced Forster to Muhammed al-Adl, with whom he had an affair. At this time, he wrote articles, guidebooks and short stories, while finishing A Passage to India.\n\nIn 1921 he became private secretary to the maharaja of Dewas. In 1925, Forster and his mother moved to West Hackhurst, a house in Abinger Hammer, Surrey. They also had a place in London, where he could live more independently. He regularly wrote for publications like The Criterion, as well as delivering a series of lectures in Cambridge, later published as Aspects of the Novel.\n\nHe was elected to a supernumerary fellowship at King\u2019s College, Cambridge. He formed a relationship with the policeman Bob Buckingham. He also protested about the banning of a book entitled The Well of Loneliness. He became the first President of the National Council for Civil Liberties, as well as sitting on the Lord Chancellor\u2019s committee on defamatory libel.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Forster wrote essays and appeared on radio, discussing subjects such as freedom and tolerance. After his mother\u2019s death in March 1945, Forster was unable to stay in West Hackhurst and was offered an honorary fellowship at King\u2019s College, Cambridge, where he resided until his death in May 1970.\n\nForster refused to be knighted, in 1949; however, he did become a Companion of Honour in 1953 and received the Order of Merit on his ninetieth birthday.\n\nHassall, Christopher (1912-63)\n\nThe son of John Hassall, the painter and illustrator, and Constance Maud Webb, Christopher Hassall was born on 24 March 1912, in London. He was educated at Brighton College, then Wadham College, Oxford. He left Oxford during his finals, due to financial problems. At Oxford, he played Romeo in an Oxford University Dramatic Society production of Romeo and Juliet.\n\nIn 1933, he toured with Ivor Novello, performing in Proscenium. Novello asked Hassall to write lyrics for his melodies. He also introduced Hassall to Edward Marsh. Hassall started to write poetry, for which Marsh was a critic. Hassall wrote plays, librettos for operas, poems and biographies. His Out of the Whirlwind (1953) was the first secular play to be performed in Westminster Abbey since the Restoration. He wrote biographies of Stephen Haggard, Edward Marsh and Rupert Brooke. His biography on Marsh was critically acclaimed and won the James Tait memorial prize. Rupert Brooke: a Biography was published posthumously.\n\nIn the 1938, Hassall married Evelyn Helen Lynett Hill, with whom he had a son and a daughter. Hassall was commissioned in 1941 and became a major in the army education corps.\n\nHassall was a councillor and Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and a governor of the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. He died on 25 April 1963, following a heart attack he suffered on a train.\n\nInge, William Ralph (1860\u20131954)\n\nBorn in Yorkshire, in 1860, William Ralph Inge was the son of William Inge and Susanna Mary Churton. He won a scholarship at Eton in 1874, before becoming a scholar at King\u2019s College in 1879, where he received a first in both parts of the Tripos and also received various awards. After graduating, he spent four years teaching at Eton before being ordained in 1888.\n\nPrior to becoming a priest, he had held religious doubts. As a priest, he felt Christianity must focus on personal experience of God and mysticism (union with God through prayer and contemplation), rather than miracles. During his time as vicar of All Saints\u2019 Church in Ennismore Gardens, London, he married Mary Catherine Spooner. In 1907, he became Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity at Cambridge.\n\nIn 1911, Prime Minister Asquith appointed him dean of St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, in London. This appointment may have been due in part to Inge\u2019s literary interests, for he wrote weekly columns for the Evening Standard. Dean Inge quoted Rupert Brooke's poem 'The soldier' in his sermon on Easter Day, 4 April 1915. After Rupert Brooke\u2019s death on 23 April 1915, Dean Inge was one of the first to console Brooke\u2019s mother, sending her the manuscript of the sermon.\n\nLater, he too would experience the loss of his children, as well as his wife. He was knighted in 1930. Though not a pacifist, he opposed entry into the Second World War on the basis that he felt Britain had no quarrel with Germany.\n\nKeynes, Geoffrey (1887-1982)\n\nGeoffrey Keynes was born in Cambridge on 25 March 1887. His father was (John) Neville Keynes, a lecturer in moral science, and his mother was Florence Ada Keynes. Though his older brother, the economist (John) Maynard Keynes, is better known, Geoffrey Keynes led a distinguished career as both a surgeon and a literary scholar.\n\nHe went to Rugby School in 1901, where he met Rupert Brooke, before going up to Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1906. There he studied natural sciences and received a first in part one of the Tripos in 1909. He gained an MA in 1913.\n\nAfter Cambridge, he trained at St Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital, London, where he won a scholarship in surgery. During the First World War, he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps. He was a pioneer in blood transfusion. On 12 May 1917, he married Margaret Elizabeth Darwin, daughter of Sir George Howard Darwin. During the Second World War, Keynes was a consulting surgeon to the RAF, reaching the rank of Acting Air Vice-Marshal in 1944.\n\nThrough Rupert Brooke, he had developed an interest in seventeenth-century poetry. He wrote on William Blake. He edited volumes by John Donne, John Evelyn, William Harvey and others. He also compiled bibliographies of writers such as Jane Austin, Rupert Brooke and Siegfried Sassoon. He wrote a biography on William Harvey (1966), then one on Rupert Brooke (1968). He was appointed as a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery in 1942 and was its chairman from 1958 to 1966. Other interests included ballet and book collecting.\n\nHe gained various honorary degrees, including ones from both Cambridge and Oxford. He was elected an Honorary Fellow of the British Academy in 1980. He died in Brinkley, near Cambridge, on 5 July 1982.\n\nKeynes, John Maynard (1883-1946)\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes was born in Cambridge on 5 June 1883, the son of Florence and Dr. John Neville Keynes, Fellow of Pembroke College and later University Registrar. Geoffrey Keynes, his younger brother, was a friend of Rupert Brooke\u2019s. He was educated at Eton, and came up to King's College, Cambridge as a scholar in 1902. He was also a member of the Apostles, a secret Cambridge debating society.\n\nAfter he was awarded his undergraduate degree, he entered the Home Civil Service and served for two years at the India Office. He left the civil service in 1908, however, and in 1909 was elected a Fellow of King's College and remained so until his death. He was lecturer in Economics from 1911 to 1937 and in 1919 he also accepted the post of Second Bursar of the college. In 1924 he began his memorable tenure as First Bursar, changing completely the philosophy by which the college managed its assets, and in 1925, he married Lydia Lopokova.\n\nDespite his retirement from the India Office, Keynes was to be found in London almost as often as in Cambridge, placing his services at the disposal of his government, particularly when called upon by the Treasury. He served on a number of government committees in the 1920s and \u201830s, but - as with everyone else - it was during the two world wars that most was demanded of him.\n\nDuring World War I he became a civil servant in the Treasury and by 1917 had gained a position of some responsibility. He was the Treasury's representative at the peace conference that ended the war. At the invitation of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Keynes placed his services at the disposal of his country again in 1940, after war had broken out a second time. As an advisor to the Treasury, he was much involved in both the problems of war finance and plans for the later transition from war to peace.\n\nAmong other things, Keynes acted as one of the negotiators of Lend-Lease, and played a leading part at the Bretton Woods conference. He was rewarded for his services during the first war with a C.B. (a form of knighthood), and for those during the second by elevation to the peerage, becoming Baron Keynes of Tilton.\n\nIt was not as a servant of college or country, however, that Keynes has made his name, but as a brilliant and original economist. Keynes was a prolific writer who shunned his colleagues' attempts to create an economic 'grand theory' in favour of short works that addressed the fiscal problems of the day as quickly and competently as possible. In the process he did, nevertheless, create something lasting - what we now call Keynesian economics - the cornerstone of which were his theories on saving and investment, and their relation to rising and falling prices. These were elaborated in his Treatise on money (1930) and his later General theory of employment, interest and money (1936). Through his leadership in a number of societies and his editorship of the Economic Journal he had great influence on the next generation of economists, and through his editorship of the Nation and Athenaeum and New Statesman and Nation he influenced his contemporaries more widely.\n\nHe died on Easter Sunday, 21 April 1946, after several years of ill-health.\n\nLucas, St John\n\nRupert Brooke spent much of the summer of 1904 in bed, as a result of an infected throat. That May, he was visited by St John Lucas and Arthur Eckersley. St John Welles Lucas-Lucas, to give him his full name, was educated at Oakfield, a school in Rugby, then Haileybury School, before going to University College, Oxford. He was a few years older than Brooke and lived in Middle Temple, London. They became friends and regularly wrote to each other; however, more importantly, St John Lucas became a mentor to Brooke. Brooke\u2019s letters to him often included poetry and, being a poet himself, St John Lucas was able to offer a kind of criticism which he may not have received from anyone else. He also influenced Brooke\u2019s tastes, introducing him to the works of various French writers such as Baudelaire, as well as Oscar Wilde.\n\nLucas and Eckersley were aware of fashions in literature, especially what was known as \u2018decadence\u2019. Brooke had been concerned that many of those he spoke to about the arts were \u2018philistines\u2019 so their influence must have given him some comfort. This influence was not always considered a good thing though. In particular, when considering whether or not to elect Rupert Brooke to the Apostles, Lytton Strachey referred to them as \u2018Bobbie Longman\u2019 and was critical of their influence on Brooke.\n\nMarsh, Edward (1872-1953)\n\nEdward Howard Marsh was born on 18 November 1872, son of Frederick Howard Marsh and Jane Marsh. He was educated at Westminster School, then Trinity College, Cambridge, where he gained first classes in both parts of the classical tripos. He was also a member of the Apostles, a secret Cambridge debating society. Through Maurice Baring and Edmund Gosse, Marsh was admitted to a literary circle in London.\n\nIn 1896, Marsh was appointed a junior clerk in the Australian department of the Colonial Office. He was soon promoted. Marsh was working in the West African department when Winston Churchill became parliamentary under-secretary for the colonies. Churchill asked him to become his private secretary and for the next twenty-three years Marsh worked alongside him, in various offices. When Churchill was on active service in the army, Marsh became assistant private secretary to Prime Minister Asquith. In July 1917, he was employed by Churchill again, during Churchill\u2019s time as Minister of Munitions and Secretary of State for War. He also worked for Churchill in the Colonial Office and later, the Treasury.\n\nAfter meeting an art student called Neville Lytton, Marsh became a connoisseur of art. He collected works by English watercolourists, then in 1911 he bought a painting by Duncan Grant. This led to him becoming a patron of contemporary British painting. He also met several artists from Slade School of Fine Art, including John Currie and Mark Gertler.\n\nHe played host to artists and poets, in his London apartment. From 1913, Rupert Brooke spent much of his time there. His association with poets such as Brooke led to his creation of an anthology of modern verse, entitled Georgian Poetry (because they wrote during the early years of the reign of King George V). Among the poets included were Rupert Brooke, Lascelles Abercrombie, Walter de la Mare and D.H. Lawrence. Later, he developed an interest in the war poetry of Siegfried Sassoon and Robert Graves.\n\nWhen Rupert Brooke died in 1915, Marsh became his literary executor, until 1934. At that time, he edited Brooke\u2019s posthumous prose and verse. His work did not always please Rupert Brooke\u2019s mother.\n\nLater in life, Marsh published translations of French and Latin works. He became a trustee of the Tate Gallery and a governor of the Old Vic theatre. Committees he joined included those of the Contemporary Arts Society and the council of the Royal Society of Literature.\n\nOlivier, N\u00f6el\n\nN\u00f6el Olivier was born on 25 December 1892, the youngest of Sydney Olivier and his wife Margaret\u2019s four daughters. Her father was an early member of the Fabian society (a socialist society founded in 1884, which has strong links to the Labour party).\n\nHe worked as a Colonial Secretary in British Honduras and later as Governor of Jamaica, which meant the Olivier family were often abroad; however they did set up home at The Champions at Limpsfield Chart, in Surrey. There, their neighbours and N\u00f6el\u2019s closest friends included \u2018Bunny\u2019 Garnett, who later joined the Bloomsbury group.\n\nThe Olivier girls were sent to board at Bedales School, which had a reputation for being progressive, encouraging its students to spend time outdoors and encouraging sexual equality. Other Bedales students included Jacques Raverat and Ferenc B\u00e9k\u00e1ssy (a Hungarian poet).\n\nRupert Brooke first met N\u00f6el Olivier on 10 May 1908, when her father was invited to speak to the Cambridge Fabians. He was twenty and she was fifteen. After this they wrote letters to each other and met whenever they could, including at a picnic, a group skiing holiday in Klosters and at a cottage in the New Forest.\n\nPye, Ethel\n\nEthel Pye has been described as a fringe member of the Neo-Pagans (a group of friends known for their Fabianism and enjoyment of the outdoors). A neighbour of the Olivier sisters at Limpsfield, she visited Grantchester and spent time with them, Rupert Brooke and the other Neo-pagans.\n\nRaverat, Gwen (n\u00e9e Darwin)(1885-1957)\n\nGranddaughter of Charles Darwin, the artist Gwen Raverat was born in Cambridge, in 1885. Her father was an astronomer, called Sir George Howard Darwin, and her mother was Maud du Puy, of Philadelphia. In 1908, Gwen Raverat went to Slade School of Art, where she learned painting before teaching herself wood-engraving. It is the latter for which she is best known.\n\nBefore the First World War, she was part of a group of friends known as the \u2018Neo-Pagans\u2019 (a group of friends known for their Fabianism and enjoyment of the outdoors), which included Rupert Brooke. She fell in love with Jacques Pierre Raverat and persuaded him to go to Slade with her. She carried out graphic work for the Admiralty during the Second World War. She also created designs for theatres.\n\nShe illustrated Frances Cornford\u2019s book of poems entitled Spring Morning (1915) but most of her work was on individual prints, which were widely exhibited. In 1920, she became a founder member of the Society of Wood Engravers. In later life, she also became known as a writer, primarily of art criticism.\n\nRaverat, Jacques Pierre (1885-1925)\n\nJacques Pierre Raverat was born in Provence, France, but educated at Bedales School, in England, along with other members of what were to be known as the \u2018Neo-Pagans\u2019 (a group of friends known for their Fabianism and enjoyment of the outdoors). He studied mathematics at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. His other friends included Geoffrey Keynes. Though he was said to have been attracted to \u2018Ka\u2019 Cox, he married Gwen Darwin in 1911. Virginia Woolf was a guest at their wedding. Jacques Raverat enjoyed painting and by 1909 it was taking up most of his time.\n\nLytton Strachey was a biographer and essayist, best known for Eminent Victorians, a collection of satirical biographical essays published in 1918. He was also a member of the Bloomsbury group and his brother James was Rupert Brooke\u2019s friend. Lytton Strachey, who studied history at Trinity College, Cambridge He was also a member of the Apostles, a secret Cambridge debating society. Lytton Strachey, his friend Maynard Keynes and his brother James, were instrumental in getting Rupert Brooke elected as an Apostle.\n\nStrachey, James (1887-1967)\n\nJames Strachey was a friend of Rupert Brooke\u2019s, a psychoanalyst and a translator. He was born on 26 September 1887, the youngest of thirteen children of Sir James Strachey and Jane Maria Strachey. His brothers included Lytton Strachey. James Strachey was taught at home until the age of ten, when he was sent to Hillbrow School. His older cousin, Duncan Grant, was already there. It was at Hillbrow that James Strachey became friends with Rupert Brooke.\n\nAfter Hillbrow, James went to St Paul\u2019s school in London. After this he followed in his brother Lytton\u2019s footsteps and went up to Trinity College, Cambridge. He was also a member of the Apostles, a secret Cambridge debating society. He was reunited with his friend Rupert Brooke, whom he was said to have become attracted to. Brooke tended to keep his friends in the Apostles and his Neo-Pagan (a group of friends known for their Fabianism and enjoyment of the outdoors) friends separate, so James Strachey was never accepted into the Neo-Pagans, though he had met them.\n\nHis friendship with Rupert Brooke suffered in 1912, possibly due to the effect Brooke\u2019s breakup with \u2018Ka\u2019 Cox had had upon him. Brooke\u2019s letters to James Strachey took a different, much less friendly tone. After graduating, Strachey became assistant editor of The Spectator.\n\nAfter Rupert Brooke\u2019s death, in 1915, James Strachey became attracted to both Noel Olivier and Alix Sargant-Florence, though it was the latter whom he married. He developed an interest in Freud\u2019s psychoanalysis and joined the Society for Psychical Research in 1912. After a few weeks of analysis, Freud asked him to translate his works into English.\n\nStrachey, Lytton\n\nSee Strachey, Giles Lytton.\n\nThatcher, Lady Margaret (nee Roberts) (1925-2013)\n\nMargaret Hilda Roberts was born on 13 October 1925, in Grantham, Lincolnshire. After studying at Oxford University, she became a research chemist, then a barrister. In 1951, she married Denis Thatcher and they had two children.\n\nMargaret Thatcher became MP for Finchley, North London, in 1959. Between 1964 and 1970 she held various positions in the shadow cabinet. When the Conservatives took power, she became Secretary for Education.\n\nIn 1974, the Conservatives lost the election and Margaret Thatcher challenged Edward Heath for the leadership of the party and won. She led them to victory in the 1979 general election and became Britain\u2019s first female Prime Minister.\n\nShe was a controversial Prime Minister, who is admired by many but also much criticised. Her policies included the privitisation of state-owned industries, trade union reform and the reduction of public spending. She also introduced Poll Tax. Despite winning three terms in office, there was a leadership challenge in 1990, after which she resigned her leadership and John Major became Prime Minister.\n\nIn 1992, she became a peeress in the House of Lords. Three years later, she became a member of the Order of the Garter, the highest form of knighthood.\n\nLady Thatcher died of a stroke on 8 April 2013. A ceremonial funeral was held on 17 April 2013, in accordance with her wishes.\n\nWard, Dudley\n\nDudley Ward was a Neo-Pagan (a group of friends known for their Fabianism and enjoyment of the outdoors) and it has been said that Rupert Brooke was fond of him but that he was shy, which perhaps meant he was on the fringes of that group of friends. He studied Economics at St John\u2019s College, Cambridge. Like his friend Rupert Brooke, Dudley Ward was a Fabian (a socialist society founded in 1884, which has strong links to the Labour party). Brooke and Ward travelled through Hampshire and Dorset together, campaigning for Poor Law reform.\n\nWoolf, Virginia (nee Stephen) (1882-1941)\n\nVirginia Woolf was a novelist, essayist, biographer and critic, well known for her \"modernist\" style of writing. Her most famous books include the novel Mrs. Dalloway and the essay A Room of One\u2019s Own. She was a key member of the Bloomsbury group. She was a little older than Rupert Brooke but they had known each other since they played together as children on holiday at St Ives, in Cornwall. Later, she visited him in Grantchester, where they swam in the river. She was friends with Ka Cox. When Edward Marsh\u2019s Rupert Brooke: A Memoir was published, along with his collected poems, Woolf wrote an anonymous review of the book, which was published in the Times Literary Supplement.\n\nSources\n\nThese biographies have been written using information found in sources such as the books on Rupert Brooke and the Neo-Pagans written by Hassall, Hale and Delany, as well as the biographies in the Dictionary of National Biography, Withers\u2019 A Register of Admissions to King\u2019s College Cambridge 1797-1925, and Alan and Veronica Palmer\u2019s Who\u2019s Who in Bloomsbury.

Here, in classless, optimistic tones, Henderson lays out a vision of a formerly Olympian institution becoming a mirror of modern society, diversifying its intake so that anyone \u201cfrom a poor boy at a primary school in the north of England to one from a great fee-paying prep school in the south\u201d can aspire to be educated there (so long as he\u2019s a he, of course), joyfully sharing expertise, teachers and facilities with the state sector \u2013 in short, striving \u201cto be relevant and to contribute\u201d. His aspiration that Eton should become an agent of social change is not one that many of his 70 predecessors in the job over the past six centuries would have shared; and it is somehow no surprise to hear that he has incurred the displeasure of some of the more traditionally minded boys by high-fiving them. What had happened, I wondered as I left the bunker, to the Eton I knew when I was a pupil in the late 1980s \u2013 a school so grand it didn\u2019t care what anyone thought of it, a four-letter word for the Left, a source of pride for the Right, and a British brand to rival Marmite and King Arthur?\n\nTo judge from appearances in this historic little town across the Thames from Windsor Castle, which many tourists think is worth a visit between the Round Tower and Legoland, the answer is actually not a lot. Aside from the fact that there are more brown, black and Asian faces around, the boys go about in their undertakers\u2019 uniforms of tailcoats and starched collars, as they seem to have done for centuries, learning in the old schoolrooms and depleting testosterone on the old playing fields before being locked up for the night in houses they share with 50 of their peers (each boy has his own room). As the absence of girls demonstrates, Eton considers itself exempt from the modern belief in the integration of the sexes that so many independent schools now espouse. And it remains a boarding school \u2013 a form of education which is in decline, and which some people consider a mild form of child abuse. Add to all this the statue of Henry VI, who founded the school in 1440, amid the uneven cobbles of School Yard, and the masters cycling in their gowns to their mid-morning meeting, resembling nothing so much as a synod of ravens, and you get the opposite impression to that conveyed by Henderson: one of solidity, immobility \u2013 anything but dynamism.\n\nTo the question, \u201cwhich is the \u2018real\u2019 Eton?\u201d \u2013 the laboratory for progressive ideas about social inclusion, or an annexe to Britain\u2019s heritage industry \u2013 the answer is of course \u201cboth\u201d.\n\nAll schools are defined by their intake, but none more so than Eton, which for hundreds of years received the pipsqueak sons of the ruling class and disgorged them to become statesmen and administrators. (Nineteen Old Etonians \u2013 OES \u2013 including David Cameron, have served as prime minister.) This has now changed, and a new admissions policy has brought in poor clever boys, foreign boys and \u201cnew money\u201d that the school would not have welcomed in the past. A recent parent described his surprise at finding out that the most common name at the school was Patel.\n\nAt the same time, many elements of the timeless, traditional Eton have been preserved. They\u2019re among the reasons new parents send their sons here, along with the belief that the school will coax and push and cajole the best out of the boy \u2013 that Eton is, as the headmaster puts it, \u201cunashamed in its pursuit of excellence\u201d. The school aims to educate the elite, as it always has, but it has reshaped itself in order to accommodate a new elite defined by money, brains and ambition, not pedigree, titles and acres.\n\nA delicate relationship seems likely to exist at Eton in the coming years, between deserving boys of modest background who enter the school on bursaries, often in the face of incredulity or even opposition at home, and the poised, prepared, nutritionally optimised children of the new upper class whose parents are expected to finance all this largesse \u2013 not simply by paying their fees, but also by responding to pretty much continuous appeals for money. The latest \u201cexciting and strictly limited opportunity\u201d is the chance to have your name inscribed on a stone around School Yard, costing \u00a310,000 spread over four consecutive tax years.\n\nEton\u2019s rich and poor coalesce and become each other\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre in the context of the school\u2019s ambition to be \u201cneeds-blind\u201d in the manner of Harvard \u2013 that is to say, able to offer a boy a place regardless of his parents\u2019 ability to pay. Eton\u2019s big plan was evoked succinctly by William Waldegrave, the provost (head of the governing body), when he told me, \u201cwhat I hope is that this school will continue to produce the prime minister, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and entrepreneurs of all sorts, but that three-quarters of them will have been here on bursaries.\u201d\n\nWaldegrave and Henderson may be the latest advocates of Eton\u2019s transformation, but the process began a generation ago. Over the past quarter-century many places have opened up to poorer families, with some 270 of the pupil body of 1,300 now receiving substantial or complete fees remission and the school recently taking out a \u00a345m loan to raise this number further. The school can also draw on a very large endowment by British standards. As of August 2014 it had investment and property portfolios worth \u00a3300m and an annual income from school fees of around \u00a345m, not to mention all the immovable assets and art collections. For all that, many more millions need to be wrung from parents and OES if the school is to become genuinely needs-blind.\n\nAs the school mediates between the aspiring rich and the deserving poor, a third group fights for survival: old \u201cEton\u201d families who have been sending boys to the school for generations. This group dominated the Eton I attended in the 1980s, when the school was still a barely-selective rite of passage for the descendants of Britain\u2019s Edwardian upper and upper-middle classes \u2013 complacent, snobby and full of surnames recognisable from the inter-war diaries of Harold Nicolson. This tribe\u2019s representation is shrinking. The percentage of pupils at the school with an OE father went down from 60% in 1960 to 33% in 1994 to 20% now. Eton has gone from being an heirloom handed down through the generations to a revolving door.\n\nRainbow education Pupils cheer during the Eton wall game, a sport unique to the college\n\nNo elite connives in its own dethroning, however, and Eton is a living illustration of the oft-forgotten truth that social mobility cuts both ways. Having striven to get their son into a school whose fabric reeks of continuity, it would not be a surprise if the new Eton families showed tenacity in trying to hang on to their new status by forming dynasties of their own. This new elite, floating on its liquid wealth, is probably better placed to preserve itself than the old, landed one. As often as not Mum is as high powered as Dad, and the progeny are primed not to rest on inherited laurels but to go out and achieve material success.\n\nHere, in the emergence of a new upper class \u2013 more fluid, more international, and yet revelling in its association with the old, snobbish, British continuities \u2013 lies the tension at the heart of Eton\u2019s ambition to become a meritocracy. To borrow from the Patek Philippe advert, \u201cYou never actually own a place at Eton. You merely look after it for the next generation\u201d.\n\nI performed badly in my entrance test to Eton and squeaked in only after my mother pleaded with the admissions tutor that her father had been at the school: in those days, Eton took care of its own. The establishment I entered in the spring of 1985 looked to me like the embodiment of continuity, but across the country, the mood was turning hostile. The immediate post-war period had witnessed three Etonian prime ministers in succession (one of whom, Harold Macmillan, named no fewer than 35 OES to serve in his government), but the squall of egalitarianism in the late 1960s, aggravated in the 1980s by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s ethos of self-help and aspiration, loosened the school\u2019s grip on power. In 1990, when Thatcher lost the Tory-party leadership, Douglas Hurd, who stood to succeed her, found his Eton background being used against him. \u201cI thought I was running for leadership of the Conservative Party,\u201d he complained, \u201cnot some demented Marxist sect.\u201d Hurd lost the election \u2013 and the keys to 10 Downing Street \u2013 to John Major, a state-educated former insurance clerk.\n\nTony Blair\u2019s New Labour administration of the late 1990s and early 2000s married Thatcher\u2019s brassy meritocracy with a social conscience. Oxford, Cambridge and the other major universities came under pressure to admit more state-educated pupils, and private schools were told to share their facilities with publicly funded neighbours or forfeit the tax breaks to which they, as charities, were entitled. In 1999, in a clear sign that the school could no longer count on its old links to parliament, almost 700 hereditary peers (many if not most of them OES ) were expelled from the House of Lords.\n\nIn any case by now Eton had read the runes. There was a feeling among masters and governors that the school needed to raise standards in order to maintain market share in the new, more meritocratic Britain \u2013 to keep feeding boys to Oxford and Cambridge; to keep producing prime ministers \u2013 and a more competitive admissions system was the key. But the school had an image problem. It was widely considered a closed shop that would favour the dim and idle viscount over the up-and-coming City trader\u2019s brilliant, motivated son, with the result that the City trader didn\u2019t apply. The school\u2019s policy of allowing parents to register their sons at birth for the so-called \u201cEton List\u201d exemplified the school\u2019s built-in prejudice in favour of its own. The Eton List effectively allowed an OE to sew up a place for his son while the boy was in nappies.\n\nIn 1990 the Eton List was abolished and a decade later a uniform entrance test and interview were introduced for all would-be entrants at the age of 11, under which the children of OES enjoyed no head start over the sons of people who had not been privately educated, or, for that matter, the offspring of successful Pakistani immigrants or Malaysian electronic-chip manufacturers. In time the tests got harder, the yearly intake cleverer, and the dim, idle viscounts were turned away. (Clever, industrious viscounts continued to get in.) Aided by its proximity to London, whose attractiveness as a safe deposit box for the super-wealthy was on the rise, the school became heavily oversubscribed. (In the 1950s the school had empty places.) Each year, around five and a half boys compete for each of the 260 places on offer.\n\nAlthough Eton\u2019s internal reforms were well under way by the time Tony Little, Henderson\u2019s predecessor, took over in 2002, this former scholar (an Etonian in the 1960s, he was the first member of his family to be educated over the age of 14) introduced them to a sceptical world. He was \u201cmore foreign secretary than home secretary\u201d, as one master recalls, giving interviews and making friends with educational reformers in the Blair government; his railing against the \u201cdeadly cloud of class awareness\u201d rates as one of the more unexpected interventions from an Eton headmaster.\n\nUnder Little, Eton sponsored a state boarding school up the road in Ascot and a sixth-form college in the London borough of Newham. Bursary schemes were also set up by wealthy OES . At first, bringing in boys from some of the poorest parts of Britain and overseas turned out to be surprisingly difficult; heads weren\u2019t keen on losing their brightest boys, and parents needed some convincing that Eton wasn\u2019t another planet. A documentary about three Eton scholarship boys that was shown on the BBC \u2019s children\u2019s channel in 2014 led to a spike in applications, the school\u2019s access officer told me, \u201cnot because parents saw it, but because their sons did, and thought, \u2018I\u2019d like to do that.\u2019\u201d Of two former bursary boys in their 20s I recently spoke to, one has gone on to become a speech-writer for a Conservative MP and aims to go into parliament; another is a rising actor.\n\nChanges to the admissions policy have seen the school\u2019s non-Anglo-Saxon intake rise considerably, though for all the foreign names one sees on pigeon holes in each house, Eton remains a \u201cBritish\u201d school, and its policy of diversifying its intake seems aimed at preventing it from being captured by any particular sub-group of the global elite. Traditionalists have chafed at the more international atmosphere, however, and Little described how one \u201cfinger-jabbing\u201d OE accused him of being a \u201csocialist who won\u2019t rest until you have built a mosque on the school playing fields\u201d.\n\nVisiting Eton this spring, I spent an hour in College Library, watching the school\u2019s Arabic master show three 16-year-old Palestinians some medieval manuscripts that the school had recently purchased, among them a page from a ninth-century Kufic Koran. Born in refugee camps in Lebanon, these boys had been flown to Britain for interview. Come September, two of them will be in tails.\n\nLittle\u2019s memorial at Eton is a shiny research complex, the donor-funded Tony Little Centre for Innovation and Research in Learning, which joined forces with Harvard to advance research into the adolescent brain \u2013 all synaptic pruning and neural pathways. The centre\u2019s mission statement is a slightly laboured attempt to establish Britain\u2019s poshest school as a public good: \u201cwe want Eton and the wider UK to be at the forefront of new developments in teaching and learning, for the benefit of all.\u201d\n\nThe new Eton \u2013 friendly to the international plutocracy while also containing strong elements of political correctness \u2013 naturally went down badly with the established Eton families whose names adorn the war-memorial plaques and the sporting cups, and whose sons have been rejected in big numbers. In 2009, at a reunion I attended, Waldegrave delivered a speech lauding diversity of intake and beating the drum for an appeal. \u201cThey want our money,\u201d my neighbour growled, \u201cbut not our sons.\u201d In the main, however, the old guard seems resigned to its demotion, in part because, however exercised they are by the newcomers, many OES would be unable to afford the school even if their sons were admitted.\n\nMy father paid around \u00a36,000 per year (around \u00a314,500 today) for me to go to Eton in the late 1980s. The annual fees are now \u00a334,000 ($50,000, or about \u00a37,000 more than the average annual wage in Britain). The merely well off \u2013 the country solicitors and provincial landowners who once formed the school\u2019s backbone \u2013 have been priced out. In the words of one OE , \u201cmany people in my circle have decided that it\u2019s not worth it, and that a good state school will do just as well.\u201d\n\nTo say that there is a cultural divide between the old Eton and the new one would be an understatement. Traditional parents wince as they describe corporate-hospitality tents and sushi bars being erected by brash parvenus for the Fourth of June, the school\u2019s annual shindig (which is not, of course, held on June 4th). Back in the 1980s it was hard-boiled eggs and wine out of a box, consumed while rocking on one\u2019s haunches on a picnic blanket.\n\nFor all the talk of 270 bursary boys and rising, furthermore, the vaunted egalitarianism of the new Eton is not always obvious. \u201cWe tried to identify the bursary boys who are with my son,\u201d remarked a pupil\u2019s mother, \u201cbut his year group includes two oligarchs\u2019 sons and a family with four children all at different English boarding schools. Our suspicions fell on the parents of an Indian boy but then we bumped into them while skiing in Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re.\u201d\n\nSome newcomers feel that change hasn\u2019t gone far enough. As an American mother said, \u201cyou still get some students who would have been there 100 years ago, and they\u2019re not always the cleverest. But\u201d, she went on with evident relief, \u201cthey don\u2019t dominate.\u201d Her only regret is that Little didn\u2019t bring in girls. Henderson is rumoured to want to abolish tails, though that would face opposition from the boys, who are attached, in quite a sweet way, to Etonian traditions.\n\nMaster plan Simon Henderson, the current headmaster\n\nInevitably, the cultural divisions felt by parents are less important to the pupils, in part because the uniform has the advantage of flattening socio-economic disparities. One former bursary boy told me, \u201cOnly after I left the school, and visited my friends in the amazing flats they had been given by their parents, did I realise just how rich they were.\u201d\n\nWith every place at Eton so keenly contested, enterprising parents sometimes try the back door. The recently retired head of admissions, Charles Milne, was visited by a famous Russian oligarch whose son had been placed on a waiting list after failing to win a place in the entrance test. \u201cThey crowded into my little office,\u201d Milne explained, \u201cthe Russian and his two bodyguards \u2013 one of them eight foot tall. I began explaining how the system works, that other boys would have to give up their places for his son to get in.\u201d Milne had not got far before the oligarch raised a hand to silence him. \u201cMr Milne,\u201d he said, \u201cI won\u2019t waste your time. When you have decided what needs to be done for my son to get his place, you will tell me.\u201d The boy ended up at another school. Another very rich foreigner, whose son had been rejected, phoned Milne to tell him he was a \u201cfucking bastard\u201d. It became an in-joke between Milne and Little. \u201cWhen I went to see the headmaster, he would greet me, \u2018hello, fucking bastard\u2019.\u201d\n\nGiven the intense competition to get a place, it\u2019s no wonder that the waiting room before the test (much harder than the one I took) is like the Russian roulette scene in \u201cThe Deer Hunter\u201d. Children sit ashen-faced while their parents confer in whispers. No one speaks to anyone else; the tension is palpable. Some boys burst into tears when they get into the interview room.\n\nThe contest isn\u2019t simply between candidates. It\u2019s a battle of wits between a school whose proclaimed intention is to identify deserving talent and ambition, and parents who will do everything to stack things in their child\u2019s favour. Well-off, well-organised parents prepare their sons ruthlessly, hiring tutors, making the boys do ceaseless verbal and non-verbal reasoning tests and sending them to interview classes to learn how to be sparky and empathetic. The school is wise to these constantly evolving efforts to game the system, however, and a lot of boys who have done brilliantly in the computerised test are turned down because they aren\u2019t \u201cinteresting\u201d at inter\u00adview. \u201cIf a boy makes me laugh,\u201d says one of the school\u2019s interviewers, \u201che stands a good chance of getting in.\u201d\n\nThe battle to enter Eton is the first exchange in a relationship between parents, boys and school that is characterised by high expectations. The rich parents want their kids to flourish and go on to an excellent university, preferably Oxford or Cambridge. The school wants these parents to show their appreciation in five figures. The bursary boys need to validate the decision to give them bursaries. Meanwhile the OES bite their fingernails and hope that the 20% figure won\u2019t go down or the fees rise even further.\n\nThe story of Eton\u2019s reconquest of the commanding heights of Britain is one of gradual rehabilitation. With the weakening of the hard left, the prospect of private schools being abolished receded, while Eton\u2019s efforts to present itself less as a throwback to an earlier age than a guarantor of achievement in the current one began to pay dividends. Though confessing to an Eton education remains a conversation-stopper in liberal-left north London, in general the school has become less of a lightning rod for class resentment. And over the past decade OES have become more pervasive than ever.\n\nBack in the 1950s it was the fact of having been to Eton, more than the education you received there, which set you up for success. Now the inverse is true. The teaching is superb, the facilities unparalleled, the results impressive. This year 85 Etonians were offered places at Oxford or Cambridge. St Paul\u2019s, Westminster and Winchester have higher Oxbridge admission rates, but then those schools always specialised in cultivating clever boys. What\u2019s interesting about Eton is the way it changed its focus from class to brains. The school has seen off the threats to its continued relevance by taking in clever boys, and sending out cleverer young men into a world that no longer defers to inherited privilege, and prizes cleverness and ambition above all.\n\nThis shift in strategy has changed the culture of the school. The ordeal of the entrance test; the upwardly mobile parents; the fact that the boys know they got into the school on their own merits, not because their fathers are OES \u2013 all this militates against the studied unconcern, the famous \u201centitlement\u201d, that was the default pose of Etonians in the 1980s. Just as it was intensely uncool to be industrious then, now the opposite is the case. \u201cIt\u2019s the boy who doesn\u2019t take advantage of all the opportunities at Eton who\u2019s considered odd,\u201d a current Etonian told me, \u201cnot those who do.\u201d\n\nA strong work ethic comes naturally in a school that opts in to the hardest public exams and fosters competitive relationships between pupils. One recent Etonian noticed this cultural peculiarity while observing a debate at St Paul\u2019s, Concord, a posh American boarding school. (Eton\u2019s debating teams often sweep the board at inter-school competitions.) \u201cThe Americans were elaborately polite to each other,\u201d he recalled, \u201cwhereas at Eton we could be brutal, saying, \u2018that\u2019s an incredibly stupid thing to say\u2019.\u201d\n\nNot a sushi bar in sight The Fourth of June in the 1980s\n\nMore than schools with higher Oxbridge acceptance rates, Eton stresses activities outside the classroom. Drama, one of its particular strengths, is an opportunity for collective endeavour that also contributes to the legendary Etonian self-assurance. The production budget at the 400-seat Farrer Theatre is higher than that at one of Britain\u2019s top drama schools. No wonder scouts and agents are often to be spotted there, looking for the next Eddie Redmayne \u2013 one of Eton\u2019s many recent showbiz alumni.\n\nThe investment in a wide range of extra-curricular interests may help explain why, when it comes to success defined more broadly than through exam results, Eton comes top. According to the Sutton Trust, a charity which works to widen opportunity, the school educates just 0.04% of Britain\u2019s secondary school population, but some 4% of nearly 8,000 \u201cleading people\u201d whose education the trust tracked were OES . Eton produces more than three times as many big cheeses as its nearest rival, Winchester (Henderson\u2019s alma mater). Taking into account Eton\u2019s larger student body, its high-achiever output rate is 50% higher.\n\nAnd that figure underplays Eton\u2019s success, for OES cluster at the very pinnacle of British life. The closer you get to power and achievement, in other words, the more likely you are to run into one. David Cameron and his rival for the soul of the Conservative Party, Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London, both attended the school. So did Prince William and Prince Harry, the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the actors Tom Hiddleston and Damian Lewis as well as Redmayne, the adventurers Bear Grylls and Ranulph Fiennes and the Nobel prize-winning biologist Sir John Gurdon. The law, business and banking fester with Old Etonians.\n\nIt\u2019s very likely that Eton has a higher \u201cstrike rate\u201d than it did in the 1980s, when for every top banker or ambassador there were one or two who conspicuously failed to enter well-paid careers (or indeed careers of any sort), and ended up cultivating marijuana or running a small country estate into the ground. No father of an Etonian in the 1980s would have admitted to thinking about anything so crass as a \u201creturn\u201d on his investment, nor were we boys party to our parents\u2019 financial affairs. This too has changed. A recent bursary boy who attended the school with a third of his fees remitted told me that his parents, both teachers at state schools, had sold the family home in order to afford the other two-thirds.\n\nBritain no longer has a ruling class, and the boys who enter Eton are anyway too varied to constitute one. Yet by the time they leave they belong to something like an emerging global elite. They have in common brains, determination and, in many cases, an aspirational family that sets great store by worldly success. These qualities got them to Eton, and they are deployed again and again to ensure they get the most out of the experience. Whether it\u2019s arranging holiday internships with City law firms, Skype tutorials in the run-up to a geography exam, or a reels refresher course before the Caledonian Ball, parents are constantly (and expensively) bolting on all kinds of optional, mini-advantages to the considerable advantage of an Eton education. The great project of modern elite parenting is all about leaving nothing to chance.\n\nThere is, of course, a natural tension between the school\u2019s role in this enterprise and its ambition to be an engine of social mobility \u2013 just as there is at the American Ivy League universities that Eton\u2019s admissions system seeks to emulate. A small number of Etonians are poor; some are only modestly well-off; but the majority of them are seriously wealthy by the standards of most of the world. One of the consequences of Eton\u2019s transformation is thus to ensure that the children of the very rich stay that way.\n\nFor all its inbuilt advantages, the task facing Eton at the turn of the millennium was a tricky one. It needed to entrench its position at the top of British life while carrying out controversial and difficult reforms. Few would argue that the changes have been anything but necessary and skilfully accomplished, but they have come at an intangible price. A recently retired master complained that teaching has got more boring because boys constantly harp on the need to stick to the syllabus: \u201care we going to need this for the exam, sir?\u201d\n\nEton used to have a strong sideline in rebels and oddballs. My time there was enriched by exposure to some truly unusual characters, both masters and boys, which engendered a tolerance of human foibles and acted as vital redress from a hierarchical, rules-based institution. Inevitably, as the school has grown more concerned with outcomes and assessments and ever keener to maximise the use to which its facilities are put, the eccentrics have been purged from the institution.\n\nThe value of such people is hard to quantify; their achievement doesn\u2019t show through in the exam results, but in the diffusion of a spirit of irreverence and scepticism. One boy in my house, William Sinclair, was a brilliant subversive and satirist of the school; his lampooning of the authorities and disrespect for conventional hierarchies among the boys punctured the pretension and self-regard to which Eton is easily prone. William\u2019s planting of a live chicken in our housemaster\u2019s bathtub was the least of his misdemeanours.\n\nMy tutor over my final years was Michael Kidson, a lop-shouldered historian who terrorised us in thrilling, beautiful, confident English, threw blackboard rubbers at boys who offended against syntax and grammar \u2013 I got one in the head for pluralising \u201cprotagonist\u201d \u2013 and defended his oversexed spaniel for trying to solace itself against our thighs. (\u201cNothing wrong with a young man wanting a wank!\u201d) Above all, Kidson was loyal and would fight fiercely for you if you got into trouble; several boys escaped expulsion thanks to his efforts. On all sorts of levels it is hard to imagine either Sinclair or Kidson being welcomed to today\u2019s Eton, but back then they were among the school\u2019s best-loved figures and knowing them seems as useful to me now as any City internship would have been.\n\nEton isn\u2019t alone among reformed institutions to have got duller as it has got better, and few of the current boys\u2019 families will rue the absence of eccentrics if their son gets his Oxbridge place. The school has gone from being a rite of passage for a now-defunct upper class to a coalition of different sorts of people who have signed up to an ambitious agenda that may not, in fact, be their own. If Eton hasn\u2019t quite become the liberal, socially transformative institution the reformists seek, it is undeniably more discerning in allocating one of the best starts in life that money (or brains, or ambition) can get you.\u25a0\n\nPHOTOGRAPH JAMES MCNAUGHT"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/Eton-College", "page_content": "Eton College, boarding school near Windsor, Berkshire, one of England\u2019s largest independent secondary schools and one of the highest in prestige. It was founded by Henry VI in 1440\u201341 for 70 highly qualified boys who received scholarships from a fund endowed by the king. Simultaneously, Henry founded King\u2019s College, Cambridge, to which scholars from Eton were to proceed. That connection is no longer in place.\n\nToday, as throughout the school\u2019s history, Eton names about 14 King\u2019s Scholars, or Collegers, each year, for a schoolwide total of 70. The selection is based on the results of a competitive examination open to boys between 12 and 14 years of age. King\u2019s Scholars are awarded scholarships ranging from 10 to 100 percent of fees and are boarded in special quarters in the college.\n\nThe other students, called Oppidans, now number more than 1,200 and are housed in boardinghouses under the care of house masters. The Oppidans have traditionally come from England\u2019s wealthiest and most prestigious families, many of them aristocratic. Boys enter Eton about age 13 and continue there until they are ready to enter university."}, {"url": "https://www.historyextra.com/period/victorian/eton-college-history-facts-fees-prime-ministers-school/", "page_content": "When I wrote my history of Britain\u2019s public schools five years ago I remarked in the penultimate paragraph that David Cameron was the 19th prime minister educated at Eton College, and would not be the last. It did not take long for my prediction to come true: Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson is the 20th. No other school comes close to this, though Harrow can boast seven.\n\nHere, journalist and historian David Turner investigates the history of Eton and asks why its scholars \u2013 from Robert Walpole and William Pitt to David Cameron and Boris Johnson \u2013 have gone on to dominate British politics\u2026\n\nEton College has also contributed disproportionately large numbers of MPs and cabinet ministers, even by comparison with other public schools. Founded in 1440 by King Henry VI as \u201cKynge's College of Our Ladye of Eton besyde Windesore\u201d, the peak of Old Etonian power came probably in 1866, when they accounted for nine of the Earl of Derby\u2019s 16-strong cabinet, including Derby himself.\n\nThere are clear historical reasons why Old Etonians have been so pre-eminent in politics:\n\nThe entrance of Eton College. Eton has contributed disproportionately large numbers of MPs and cabinet ministers, even by comparison with other public schools. (Photo by: Dukas/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)\n\nRoyal connection\n\nEton was not the first of what would become known as the public schools \u2013 schools where, for the first time, children of the British elite were educated together in large numbers, rather than at home or in small monastery schools. Winchester College was founded 58 years before, in 1382. But while Winchester was established by a bishop, Eton\u2019s creator was the king of England, Henry VI, who set it up in a hamlet of the same name not far from the Thames to provide free education to 70 underprivileged boys who would then go on to King's College, Cambridge, which he founded in 1441. Henry took a close interest in the school, as did a number of future monarchs \u2013 perhaps because it was not much more than a stone\u2019s throw away from the royal residence of Windsor Castle.\n\nThis royal connection gave Eton College a lustrous patina from the start, which explains why the gentry and nobility that supplied most prime ministers up until the 20th century came to embrace Eton. An early example is the erudite 3rd Earl of Bute, prime minister 1762\u201363.\n\nAccording to Eton, the earliest records of its school life date from the 16th century and \u201cpaint a picture of a regimented and Spartan life\u201d. Students were awakened at 5am each day and chanted prayers while they dressed, and by 6am they could be found studying in the Lower School. All teaching was in Latin and there was just a single hour of play, with lessons finishing at 8pm. There were only two school holidays \u2013 one at Christmas, when the students remained at Eton, and the summer break, both of which lasted for three weeks. For this reason, Eton\u2019s three terms that make up one school year are still known, confusingly, as \u201chalves\u201d. In the rest of the world three halves make one-and-a-half, but not at Eton.\n\nThe statue of Eton's founder, Henry VI, watches over the college yard. (Photo by John Phillips/Life Magazine/The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images/Getty Images)\n\nAmbition\n\nThe grand aristocratic clans that patronised Eton drew in families that were less exalted but highly ambitious. In the early 19th century an energetic Scot from an unremarkable middle-class family worked his way up to become an immensely rich merchant. Determined that at least one of his sons should succeed in politics, he decided that the best route to this was Eton followed by Christ Church, Oxford. The elder son was a relative disappointment: he never made it beyond the Tory backbenches. The other was William Ewart Gladstone, four times prime minister.\n\nMore like this\n\nBoris Johnson himself comes from a solid middle-class rather than upper-class background. He was born in New York City to British parents \u2013 his mother, Charlotte Johnson Wahl, was aged 22 at the time and had given up her English degree at the University of Oxford to accompany her husband, Stanley Johnson, to the US, where he was an economics student at Columbia University. He later worked at the World Bank in Washington DC while his wife became a respected painter.\n\nPolitical training\n\nWilliam Gladstone\u2019s father doubtless saw the advantages for his sons of mixing in the exalted company of aristocratic schoolboys. However, he also understood the political education that Eton could provide. Gladstone honed his debating skills in \u2018Pop\u2019, a College society whose future members include Boris Johnson, though by Johnson\u2019s time Pop had become less of a debating chamber and more of a club for prefects: the little leaders of men of the public schools, who often go on to senior positions in public life.\n\nMembers of Pop at Eton College are allowed to wear a waistcoat of their own design which differ from the black waistcoats of other boys. (Photo by ullstein bild/ullstein bild via Getty Images)\n\nMembers of Pop are allowed to wear a waistcoat of their own design (often highly gaudy), which differs from the black waistcoats of other boys, and checked spongebag trousers (rather than black pinstripes), though they sport the same black tailcoat as other pupils. John Boughey, president of Pop in 1938 two years before his death in the Second World War, said that for every holder of the office, the post \u201cteaches him in the microcosm what should be the behaviour of the public servant\u201d.\n\nWhile at the school, Gladstone joined a political faction known as the Canningites, named after their leader George Canning, later a Tory foreign secretary and briefly prime minister. Canning, who had himself attended Eton a generation earlier, is if anything an even greater advert than Gladstone for the political advancement the college can provide. It is certainly difficult to see the boy, son of a failed wine merchant and actress, rising so far, had he not gone to the school courtesy of his uncle\u2019s generosity. A great orator, Canning excelled at public speaking while at the school, as did Johnson, whose mastery of rhetoric is probably what landed him Britain\u2019s top job.\n\nInclusiveness\n\nThis may look like a typo, since Eton is clearly not inclusive when compared with a state comprehensive, but it has often been more inclusive than other public schools. For example, at a public meeting organised in 1840 to set up Cheltenham College [a public school in Cheltenham, England], it was resolved that no one could become a shareholder of the new school, giving them a right to nominate pupils, \u201cwho should not be moving in the circle of gentlemen. No retail traders being under any circumstances to be considered.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Eton has tended historically to accept most children if their families had the money or the talent. William Sherlock, who after leaving Eton in 1657 eventually became chaplain to James II and then William III, making him a powerful figure at the court (though not strictly speaking a politician), was the son of a tradesman living in the evocatively named Gravel Lane, Southwark. Sherlock was probably one of the 70 King\u2019s Scholars, educated for most of the College\u2019s history for free, as provided for in Henry VI\u2019s endowment. Fellow Scholars include both our very latest prime minister (who by the time he attended Eton had to pay fees) and the very first one, Robert Walpole.\n\nThese days the College means-tests its approximately 1,300 students so that those from wealthy families pay full fees, currently \u00a314,167 a term, and even Scholars pay 90 per cent if their families are wealthy (some past Scholars have hailed from great riches, such as the academic and precocious Harold Macmillian, Eton prime minister number 17). However, in 2014 Eton announced that 274 boys were on bursaries, where fees are reduced or waived altogether because parents cannot afford to pay them, with 70 boys (among both Scholars and non-Scholars, known as Oppidans) to receive an education for free in the coming year. This enables the College to cast its net still wider in the search for talent.\n\nReform\n\nFor most of its history Eton demanded scholarliness of its Scholars, but not of anyone else. In the early years of the new A-Level examinations, introduced in the 1950s, results were above the national average, but not conspicuously so. This began to change in the 1960s, with notable improvement under Johnson\u2019s head master, Michael McCrum, who markedly improved exam results by improving educational standards and introducing stricter entrance requirements. A much lower proportion of boys accepted were the sons of Old Etonians \u2013 in other words, accepted through family line rather than ability \u2013 and the pass mark in Common Entrance, the standard public school exam, was raised.\n\nBy making the school more selective, this drew in intelligent boys who might previously have gone to historically more academic rivals such as Westminster, some of whom went on to become politicians in an era when prospective Tory MPs were supposed to be clever rather than merely posh.\n\nThe new millennium saw the introduction of what Eton itself describes as \u201ca more meritocratic entry system, with boys no longer being entered on house lists at birth \u2013 from 2002, all boys had to win their places through the current procedure of an interview, reasoning test and reference from their previous school.\u201d\n\nEton College schoolboys wearing the traditional dress of the school, c1978. (Photo by Evening Standard/Getty Images)\n\nHistory\n\nThe college\u2019s success in schooling so many senior politicians over the centuries has created an air of expectation among both pupils and the school\u2019s leaders. Baron Caccia, provost (chair of the governors) during Johnson\u2019s time, used to give a power pep talk to new Scholars, according to someone who had been on the receiving end (quoted in Sonia Purnell\u2019s 2011 biography, Just Boris): \u201cHe told us we were the future leaders, that we had a responsibility and a destiny that was not to be taken lightly.\u201d The effect? \u201cYou found yourself thinking of someone like Pitt the Elder [Old Etonian premier number four] and asking yourself, am I really potentially that great?\u201d\n\nAs Tony Little, the current head master\u2019s predecessor, put it with customary understatement: \u201cIf you know that some interesting people have gone on to do some interesting things, whether it\u2019s George Orwell or the Duke of Wellington [Etonian premier number eight], that does implicitly ask the question, why not you?\u201d\n\nFor these six reasons, I have no trouble in renewing my prediction: just as I forecast that Cameron would not be Eton\u2019s final prime minister, I can say with assurance that Johnson will not be, either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid Turner is a journalist and historian, and author of The Old Boys: The Decline and Rise of the Public School, published by Yale University Press (2015)."}]}
