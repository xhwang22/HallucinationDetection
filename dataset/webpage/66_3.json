The 71-year-old former bureaucrat is a retired Union secretary who has made a mark wherever he worked. Bose joined the IAS in 1977 in the Kerala cadre and has held the offices of university vice-chancellor, additional chief secretary and district collector in Kerala.\n\nA prolific writer and columnist, Bose has published 40 books in English, Malayalam and Hindi, including novels, short stories, poems and essays. He is a recipient of 29 international and national awards for his outstanding contribution in various fields. He served as chairman of the working group that prepared the national development agenda for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBorn on January 2, 1951, in Mannanam village in Kottayam district of Kerala, Ananda Bose\u2019s father P.K. Vasudevan Nair was a freedom fighter and follower of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. It was Nair who added \u2018Bose\u2019 to his son\u2019s name.\n\nIn his early career, Ananda Bose was an English lecturer. He subsequently joined the State Bank group of banks as a probationary officer in Bengal and worked in the remote areas. He joined the IAS at the age of 26.\n\nDuring his tenure as the sub-collector of Kasargod, Bose, in 1978, initiated Gramotsav, a festival celebrating the culture and art forms of villages. The idea got replicated across Kerala and even today, the event forms an important part of the state\u2019s tourism calendar.\n\nAs the district collector of Kollam, Bose, in 1985, founded the Kerala State Nirmithi Kendra to provide cost-effective and environment-friendly housing solutions to the people. The initiative later became a part of the national housing policy. \u201cHis greatest contribution has been to introduce low-cost housing technology to Kerala. He did it brilliantly with the support of Sarala Gopalan, then revenue secretary of Kerala,\u201d says S.M. Vijayanand, former chief secretary of Kerala and former Kollam district collector.\n\nDuring his first meeting with Narendra Modi in 2014, while the latter was Gujarat chief minister, Bose introduced the idea and submitted a proposal. His ideas had also impressed former prime minister Manmohan Singh, who called him an \u2018inspired\u2019 civil servant.\n\nBose joined the BJP in 2019 but staying away from the local politics of Kerala, he networked with national leaders. After the 2021 Kerala assembly poll, PM Modi had sought his suggestions to revive the BJP in the state. His report did not go down well with the current BJP leadership in Kerala.

Subhas Chandra Bose (also called Netaji) is known for his role in India\u2019s independence movement. A participant of the noncooperation movement and a leader of the Indian National Congress, he was part of the more militant wing and known for his advocacy of socialist policies. What was Subhas Chandra Bose\u2019s education? Subhas Chandra Bose studied in Calcutta (Kolkata) at the Presidency College and the Scottish Churches College. His parents then sent him to the University of Cambridge in England to prepare for the Indian Civil Service. He passed the civil service examination but resigned his candidacy and returned to India after hearing of nationalist turmoils there. What was Subhas Chandra Bose\u2019s impact? Subhas Chandra Bose (known also as Netaji) reflected a more militant and socialist approach to India\u2019s independence movement as compared with Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi\u2019s less confrontational stance and more conservative economics. While in exile in the 1940s, Bose raised a liberation army in East Asia with Japanese aid and influence. How did Subhas Chandra Bose die? Subhas Chandra Bose reportedly died in a Japanese hospital in Taiwan from burn injuries on August 18, 1945, as a result of a plane crash while fleeing Southeast Asia, days after World War II ended with the surrender of Japan (which had been supporting Bose and his liberation army).\n\nSubhas Chandra Bose, byname Netaji (Hindi: \u201cRespected Leader\u201d), (born c. January 23, 1897, Cuttack, Orissa [now Odisha], India\u2014died August 18, 1945, Taipei, Taiwan?), Indian revolutionary prominent in the independence movement against British rule of India. He also led an Indian national force from abroad against the Western powers during World War II. He was a contemporary of Mohandas K. Gandhi, at times an ally and at other times an adversary. Bose was known in particular for his militant approach to independence and for his push for socialist policies.\n\nA falling-out with Gandhi Know about Subhas Chandra Bose and his role in India's independence movement See all videos for this article Vocal support for Gandhi increased within the Indian National Congress, meanwhile, and, in light of this, Gandhi resumed a more commanding role in the party. When the civil disobedience movement was started in 1930, Bose was already in detention for his associations with an underground revolutionary group, the Bengal Volunteers. Nevertheless, he was elected mayor of Calcutta while in prison. Released and then rearrested several times for his suspected role in violent acts, Bose was finally allowed to proceed to Europe after he contracted tuberculosis and was released for ill health. In enforced exile and still ill, he wrote The Indian Struggle, 1920\u20131934 and pleaded India\u2019s cause with European leaders. He returned from Europe in 1936, was again taken into custody, and was released after a year. Meanwhile, Bose became increasingly critical of Gandhi\u2019s more conservative economics as well as his less confrontational approach toward independence. In 1938 he was elected president of the Indian National Congress and formed a national planning committee, which formulated a policy of broad industrialization. However, this did not harmonize with Gandhian economic thought, which clung to the notion of cottage industries and benefiting from the use of the country\u2019s own resources. Bose\u2019s vindication came in 1939, when he defeated a Gandhian rival for reelection. Nonetheless, the \u201crebel president\u201d felt bound to resign because of the lack of Gandhi\u2019s support. He founded the Forward Bloc, hoping to rally radical elements, but was again incarcerated in July 1940. His refusal to remain in prison at this critical period of India\u2019s history was expressed in a determination to fast to death, which frightened the British government into releasing him. On January 26, 1941, though closely watched, he escaped from his Calcutta residence in disguise and, traveling via Kabul and Moscow, eventually reached Germany in April."}, {"url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/kerala/kerala-bjp-report-hawala-allegation-ananda-bose-7359609/", "page_content": "A report on Kerala BJP, which is under the hawala allegation cloud, has been submitted to the \u201ccompetent authority\u201d, said retired civil servant C V Ananda Bose.
