It's a type of neural tube defect. The neural tube is the structure in a developing embryo that eventually becomes the baby's brain, spinal cord and the tissues that enclose them.\n\nTypically, the neural tube forms early in pregnancy and it closes by the 28th day after conception. In babies with spina bifida, a portion of the neural tube doesn't close or develop properly, causing problems in the spinal cord and in the bones of the spine.\n\nSpina bifida can range from mild to severe, depending on the type of defect, size, location and complications. When necessary, early treatment for spina bifida involves surgery \u2014 although such treatment doesn't always completely resolve the problem.\n\nTypes\n\nSpina bifida (myelomeningocele) Enlarge image Close Spina bifida (myelomeningocele) Spina bifida (myelomeningocele) Myelomeningocele is a severe type of spina bifida in which the membranes and the spinal nerves protrude at birth, forming a sac on the baby's back. The exposed nervous system may become infected, so prompt surgery is needed after birth.\n\nSpina bifida can occur in different types: spina bifida occulta, myelomeningocele (my-uh-lo-muh-NING-go-seel) or the very rare type meningocele (muh-NING-go-seel).\n\nSpina bifida occulta\n\nOcculta means hidden. It's the mildest and most common type. Spina bifida occulta results in a small separation or gap in one or more of the bones of the spine (vertebrae). Many people who have spina bifida occulta don't even know it, unless the condition is discovered during an imaging test done for unrelated reasons.\n\nMyelomeningocele\n\nAlso known as open spina bifida, myelomeningocele is the most severe type. The spinal canal is open along several vertebrae in the lower or middle back. The membranes and spinal nerves push through this opening at birth, forming a sac on the baby's back, typically exposing tissues and nerves. This makes the baby prone to life-threatening infections and may also cause paralysis and bladder and bowel dysfunction.\n\nMeningocele\n\nThis rare type of spina bifida is characterized by a sac of spinal fluid bulging through an opening in the spine. No nerves are affected in this type, and the spinal cord isn't in the fluid sac. Babies with meningocele may have some minor problems with functioning, including those affecting the bladder and bowels.\n\nSymptoms\n\nSigns and symptoms of spina bifida vary by type and severity, and also between individuals.\n\nSpina bifida occulta. Typically, there aren't any signs or symptoms because the spinal nerves aren't involved. But you can sometimes see signs on the newborn's skin above the spinal problem, including a tuft of hair, a small dimple or a birthmark. Sometimes, these skin marks can be signs of an underlying spinal cord issue that can be discovered with MRI or spinal ultrasound in a newborn.\n\nTypically, there aren't any signs or symptoms because the spinal nerves aren't involved.

Children diagnosed with this condition should be followed by a specialized team of health care providers throughout their lives. Families should be educated on the different complications to watch for.\n\nChildren with spina bifida occulta typically don't have any symptoms or complications, so usually only routine pediatric care is needed.\n\nThere is a problem with information submitted for this request.

It's thought to result from a combination of genetic, nutritional and environmental risk factors, such as a family history of neural tube defects and folate (vitamin B-9) deficiency.\n\nRisk factors\n\nSpina bifida is more common among white people and Hispanics, and females are affected more often than males. Although doctors and researchers don't know for sure why spina bifida occurs, they have identified some risk factors:\n\nFolate deficiency. Folate, the natural form of vitamin B-9, is important to the development of a healthy baby. The synthetic form, found in supplements and fortified foods, is called folic acid. A folate deficiency increases the risk of spina bifida and other neural tube defects.\n\nFolate, the natural form of vitamin B-9, is important to the development of a healthy baby. The synthetic form, found in supplements and fortified foods, is called folic acid. A folate deficiency increases the risk of spina bifida and other neural tube defects. Family history of neural tube defects. Couples who've had one child with a neural tube defect have a slightly higher chance of having another baby with the same defect. That risk increases if two previous children have been affected by the condition. In addition, women who were born with a neural tube defect have a greater chance of giving birth to a child with spina bifida than someone who doesn't have a neural tube defect. However, most babies with spina bifida are born to parents with no known family history of the condition.\n\nCouples who've had one child with a neural tube defect have a slightly higher chance of having another baby with the same defect.

However, most babies with spina bifida are born to parents with no known family history of the condition. Some medications. For example, anti-seizure medications, such as valproic acid seem to cause neural tube defects when taken during pregnancy. This might happen because they interfere with the body's ability to use folate and folic acid.\n\nFor example, anti-seizure medications, such as valproic acid seem to cause neural tube defects when taken during pregnancy.

Obesity. Pre-pregnancy obesity is associated with an increased risk of neural tube birth defects, including spina bifida.\n\nPre-pregnancy obesity is associated with an increased risk of neural tube birth defects, including spina bifida. Increased body temperature. Some evidence suggests that increased body temperature (hyperthermia) in the early weeks of pregnancy may increase the risk of spina bifida. Increases in core body temperature, due to fever or use of a sauna or hot tub, have been associated with a slightly increased risk of spina bifida.\n\nIf you have known risk factors for spina bifida, talk with your doctor to determine if you need a larger dose or prescription dose of folic acid, even before a pregnancy begins.\n\nIf you take medications, tell your doctor. If you plan ahead, some medications can be adjusted to diminish the potential risk of spina bifida.\n\nComplications\n\nSpina bifida may cause minimal symptoms or minor physical problems. But severe spina bifida can lead to more significant physical conditions. Severity is affected by:\n\nThe size and location of the neural tube defect\n\nWhether skin covers the affected area\n\nWhich spinal nerves come out of the affected area of the spinal cord\n\nThis list of possible complications may seem overwhelming, but not all children with spina bifida get all of these complications. Many of these complications can be treated.\n\nWalking and mobility problems. The nerves that control the leg muscles don't work properly below the area of the spina bifida defect. This can cause muscle weakness of the legs and sometimes paralysis. Whether a child can walk typically depends on where the defect is, its size, and the care received before and after birth.\n\nThe nerves that control the leg muscles don't work properly below the area of the spina bifida defect.

Chiari malformation (kee-AH-ree mal-for-MAY-shun) type 2 is a common problem with the brain in children who have the myelomeningocele type of spina bifida. The brainstem is the lowest part of the brain above the spinal cord. In Chiari malformation type 2, the brainstem is elongated and positioned lower than usual. This can cause problems with breathing and swallowing. Rarely, compression on this area of the brain occurs and surgery is needed to relieve the pressure.\n\nChiari malformation (kee-AH-ree mal-for-MAY-shun) type 2 is a common problem with the brain in children who have the myelomeningocele type of spina bifida.

The spinal cord is less able to grow as the child grows. This progressive tethering can cause loss of muscle function to the legs, bowel or bladder. Surgery can limit the degree of disability.\n\nTethered spinal cord results when the spinal nerves bind to the scar where the defect was closed surgically.

Skin problems. Children with spina bifida may get wounds on their feet, legs, buttocks or back. They can't feel when they get a blister or sore. Sores or blisters can turn into deep wounds or foot infections that are hard to treat.

Children with myelomeningocele have a higher risk of wound problems in casts. Latex allergy. Children with spina bifida have a higher risk of latex allergy, an allergic reaction to natural rubber or latex products. Latex allergy may cause rash, sneezing, itching, watery eyes and a runny nose. It can also cause anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening condition in which swelling of the face and airways can make breathing difficult. So it's best to use latex-free gloves and equipment at delivery time and when caring for a child with spina bifida.\n\nChildren with spina bifida have a higher risk of latex allergy, an allergic reaction to natural rubber or latex products.

So it's best to use latex-free gloves and equipment at delivery time and when caring for a child with spina bifida. Other complications. More problems may arise as children with spina bifida get older, such as urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and depression. Children with myelomeningocele may develop learning disorders, such as problems paying attention, and difficulty learning reading and math.\n\nPrevention\n\nFolic acid, taken in supplement form starting at least one month before conception and continuing through the first trimester of pregnancy, greatly reduces the risk of spina bifida and other neural tube defects.\n\nGet folic acid first\n\nHaving enough folic acid in your system by the early weeks of pregnancy is critical to prevent spina bifida. Because many women don't discover that they're pregnant until this time, experts recommend that all women of childbearing age take a daily supplement of 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid.\n\nSeveral foods are fortified with 400 mcg of folic acid per serving, including:\n\nEnriched bread\n\nPasta\n\nRice\n\nSome breakfast cereals\n\nFolic acid may be listed on food packages as folate, which is the natural form of folic acid found in foods.\n\nPlanning pregnancy\n\nAdult women who are planning pregnancy or who could become pregnant should be advised to get 400 to 800 mcg of folic acid a day.\n\nYour body doesn't absorb folate as easily as it absorbs synthetic folic acid, and most people don't get the recommended amount of folate through diet alone, so vitamin supplements are necessary to prevent spina bifida. And it's possible that folic acid will also help reduce the risk of other birth defects, including cleft lip, cleft palate and some congenital heart defects.\n\nIt's also a good idea to eat a healthy diet, including foods rich in folate or enriched with folic acid. This vitamin is present naturally in many foods, including:\n\nBeans and peas\n\nCitrus fruits and juices\n\nEgg yolks\n\nMilk\n\nAvocados\n\nDark green vegetables, such as broccoli and spinach\n\nWhen higher doses are needed\n\nIf you have spina bifida or if you've previously given birth to a child with spina bifida, you'll need extra folic acid before you become pregnant. If you're taking anti-seizure medications or you have diabetes, you may also benefit from a higher dose of this B vitamin. Check with your doctor before taking additional folic acid supplements."}, {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp20157", "page_content": "Meuli, M. et al.

Spina bifida is a type of neural tube defect. The neural tube is the structure that eventually develops into the baby's brain and spinal cord. The neural tube starts to form in early pregnancy and closes about 4 weeks after conception. In spina bifida, part of the neural tube does not develop or close properly, leading to defects in the spinal cord and bones of the spine (vertebrae). It's not known what causes spina bifida, but a lack of folic acid before and in the early stages of pregnancy is a significant risk factor.\n\nTypes of spina bifida There are several different types of spina bifida, including: myelomeningocele \u2013 the most severe type of spina bifida; the baby's spinal canal remains open along several vertebrae in the back, allowing the spinal cord and protective membranes around it to push out and form a sac in the baby's back\n\nmeningocele \u2013 another serious type of spina bifida where the protective membranes around the spinal cord (meninges) push out through the spine; the spinal cord usually develops normally so surgery can often be used to remove the membranes without damaging the nerves\n\nspina bifida occulta \u2013 the most common and mildest type of spina bifida; 1 or more vertebrae does not form properly, but the gap in the spine is very small; spina bifida occulta does not usually cause any problems and most people are unaware they have it These pages focus on myelomeningocele, the most severe type of spina bifida, and this is the type usually referred to whenever the term spina bifida is used. Shine is a charity that provides help and support for people affected by spina bifida. Their website has more information about the other types of spina bifida.\n\nSymptoms of spina bifida Most people with spina bifida are able to have surgery to close the opening in the spine. But the nervous system will usually already have been damaged, which can lead to problems such as: weakness or total paralysis of the legs\n\nbowel incontinence and urinary incontinence\n\nloss of skin sensation in the legs and around the bottom \u2013 the child is unable to feel hot or cold, which can lead to accidental injury Many babies will have or develop hydrocephalus (a build-up of fluid on the brain), which can further damage the brain. Most people with spina bifida have normal intelligence, but some have learning difficulties. Read more about the symptoms of spina bifida.\n\nCauses of spina bifida The cause of spina bifida is unknown, but a number of factors can increase the risk of a baby developing the condition. These include: low folic acid intake during pregnancy\n\nhaving a family history of spina bifida\n\nmedicines \u2013 taking certain medicines such as valproic acid (used to prevent seizures) during pregnancy has been linked to an increased risk of having a baby with spina bifida Read more about the causes of spina bifida.\n\nDiagnosing spina bifida Spina bifida is often detected during the mid-pregnancy anomaly scan, which is offered to all pregnant women between 18 and 21 weeks of pregnancy. If tests confirm that your baby has spina bifida, the implications will be discussed with you. This will include a discussion about the possible problems associated with the condition, the treatment and support your child may need if you decide to continue with the pregnancy, and what your options are regarding ending the pregnancy, if that's your choice. Tests after birth Once the baby is born, a number of tests may be carried out to find out how bad the condition is and help decide which treatments are likely to be the best option. Tests may include: monitoring your child's head growth and carrying out a brain scan, using an ultrasound scan, CT scan or MRI scan, to check for hydrocephalus (excess fluid on the brain)\n\nultrasound scans of the bladder and kidneys to check whether your baby stores their pee normally\n\nan assessment of your baby's movements to check for paralysis Surgery to repair the spine will usually be recommended soon after your baby is born.\n\nTreating spina bifida Treatments for the symptoms or conditions associated with spina bifida include: surgery soon after birth to close the opening in the spine and treat hydrocephalus\n\ntherapies to help make day-to-day life easier and improve independence, such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy\n\nassistive devices and mobility equipment, such as a wheelchair, or walking aids\n\ntreatments for bowel and urinary problems With the right treatment and support, many children with spina bifida survive well into adulthood. It can be a challenging condition to live with, but many adults with spina bifida are able to lead independent and fulfilling lives. Read more about treating spina bifida.\n\nPreventing spina bifida with folic acid The best way to prevent spina bifida is to take folic acid supplements before and during pregnancy. Folic acid recommendations You should take a 400 microgram folic acid tablet every day while you're trying to get pregnant and until you're 12 weeks pregnant. If you did not take folic acid before you conceived, you should start as soon as you find out you're pregnant. Folic acid tablets are available from pharmacies and supermarkets, or a GP may be able to prescribe them for you. You should also try to eat foods that contain folate (the natural form of folic acid), such as broccoli, spinach and chickpeas. Read more about folic acid, including folic acid supplements and foods containing folate. Recommendations for women at higher risk of spina bifida Women thought to be at higher risk of having a child with spina bifida need to be prescribed a higher (5 milligram) dose of folic acid by a GP. Women at higher risk include those: with a family history of neural tube defects\n\nwith a partner with a family history of neural tube defects\n\nwho have had a previous pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect\n\nwith diabetes A GP can advise you further about this. If you're taking medicine to treat epilepsy, you should ask your GP for advice. You may also need to take a higher dose of folic acid.\n\nHelp and support If you have a child with spina bifida or you've been diagnosed with the condition yourself, you may find it helpful to speak to other people affected by it. Shine, the spina bifida and hydrocephalus charity, can provide you with details about local support groups and organisations. You can find and contact your regional Shine team or read about support for carers on the Shine website.\n\nNational Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service If you or your child has spina bifida, your clinical team will pass information about you or your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). The NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time."}, {"url": "https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/spina-bifida", "page_content": "What is spina bifida?\n\nSpina bifida is a birth disorder that involves the incomplete development of the spine. In the first month of pregnancy, a special set of cells forms the \u201cneural tube;\u201d the top of the tube becomes the brain, and the remainder becomes the spinal cord and structures around it. In spina bifida, the neural tube doesn\u2019t close completely and some of the bones of the spine do not close in the back. This can result in an opening anywhere along the spine and may cause damage to the spinal cord and nerves.\n\nThe term \"neural tube defect\" describes a group of conditions, including spina bifida, that usually occur very early in pregnancy when the neural tube does not form as expected.\n\nOften, abnormalities of the brain accompany abnormalities of the spine because the neural tube closes first in the middle and then closure proceeds both upward and downward, meaning that if something happens that prevents formation of the spine, it may also prevent formation of the part of the brain that is forming (closing) at the same time.\n\nAn infant born with spinal bifida may have nerve damage below the affected area of the spinal cord. Some will have learning disabilities or intellectual disabilities. There is no cure but most people with spina bifida lead long lives. People with spina bifida have different abilities and medical issues.\n\nTypes of spina bifida\n\nThere are four types of spina bifida: occulta, closed neural tube defects, meningocele, and myelomeningocele. The symptoms of spina bifida vary from person to person, depending on the type and level of involvement. Most cases are mild and do not require special treatment. The more serious cases involve nerve damage.\n\nOcculta is the mildest and most common form in which one or more bones of the spinal column (vertebrae) are malformed. The name \u201cocculta,\u201d which means \u201chidden,\u201d indicates that a layer of skin covers the opening in the bones of the spine. It usually shows no symptoms and is often found by accident on an x-ray or similar test. Closed neural tube defects are a diverse group of disorders in which the spine may have malformations of fat, bone, or the membranes (the meninges) that cover the spinal cord. Many of these neural tube defects require surgery in childhood. People with this type of spina bifida may have weakness of the legs and trouble with bowel and bladder control. These issues may change or progress as children grow. It is important to have close communication with doctors to minimize these changes as much as possible. Meningocele occurs when the meninges protrude through the spine and cause a sac of spinal fluid on the back. This fluid is typically only around the brain and spine, but a problem with the bony covering over the spine allows it to poke out. The malformation contains no nerves and may or may not be covered by a layer of skin. Individuals with meningocele may have minor symptoms. Myelomeningocele is the most severe form of spina bifida. A portion of the spinal cord or nerves are exposed in a sac through an opening in the spine that may or may not be covered by the meninges. The opening can be closed surgically while the baby is in utero or shortly after the baby is born. Most people with myelomeningocele experience c hanges in brain structure, l eg weakness, and b ladder and bowel dysfunction . Myelomeningocele is often called a \"snowflake condition\" because no two people with the condition are the same. Typically, if the opening in the spine is lower down the back, the person will experience less symptoms. People with myelomeningocele require close follow-up with physicians throughout their childhood and lifespan to maximize their function and prevent complications like kidney failure.\n\nComplications of spina bifida may include:\n\nAbnormal sensation or paralysis, which mostly occurs with closed neural tube defects and myelomeningocele. There is usually some degree of leg and core muscle weakness and loss of feeling in the groin and feet or legs. The sensation can be more significant on one side of the body. Typically, there is less weakness and loss of the feeling when the condition occurs lower in the spine. The strength and feeling do not improve with age due to nerve damage. People with these types of spina bifida may lose strength, sensation, and mobility as they age. They may walk independently or use some combination of leg braces, walkers, crutches, or wheelchairs.\n\nChiari II malformation , in which the brain stem and the cerebellum protrude downward into the spinal canal or neck area, is almost always seen on advanced imaging of the brain in people with myelomeningocele yet it rarely causes symptoms. When it does, this condition can press on the spinal cord and cause a variety of symptoms including: Difficulty breathing Swallowing Arm weakness\n\nBlockage of cerebrospinal fluid causes hydrocephalus, or the abnormal buildup of the fluid that surrounds the brain. Most people with myelomeningocele have this condition, altougth it is not seen in other types of spina bifida. This buildup can put damaging pressure on the brain. Hydrocephalus is commonly treated by surgically implanting a plastic shunt (hollow tube) in the brain to drain the excess fluid into the abdomen where it is absorbed by the body. Another treatment option is an endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV), a procedure that creates a new path for the fluid to flow. Meningitis, an infection in the meninges covering the brain, can sometimes be associated with shunts. Meningitis may cause brain injury and can be life-threatening.\n\nTethered cord syndrome can occur with all forms of spina bifida, although it is very rare in individuals with spina bifida occulta. Usually the spinal cord and nerves float freely. A tethered cord means that there is some type of tissue attached to and pulling the cord down (e.g., the cord may become fastened to the backbone). This can damage the nerves, decrease feeling and strength, and cause problems with bowel and bladder control. Surgery to free the cord is often successful.\n\nIncontinence affects most individuals with myelomeningocele and closed neural tube defects because the nerves that control bowel and bladder function at the very bottom of the spine are involved. Most people with myelomeningocele and some types of closed neural tube defects need a regimen or other assistance with bladder and bowel function.\n\nLearning disabilities commonly seen in children with myelomeningocele may include: Difficulty paying attention and u nderstanding concepts Impaired motor skills and memory Challenges with organization and problem solving\n\n\n\nOther complications seen in people with myelomeningocele and neural tube defects as they age may include:\n\nSkin ulcers\n\nLow bone mineral density\n\nImpaired male fertility\n\nObesity kidney failure Precocious puberty (when changes are premature/occur too soon)\n\nSleep apnea\n\nDepression\n\nWho is more likely to get spina bifida?\n\nEach year approximately 1,400 babies born in the U.S. have spina bifida, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The exact cause of spina bifida is unknown but scientists suspect genetic, nutritional, and environmental factors all play a role in its development.\n\nHow is spina bifida diagnosed and treated?\n\nDiagnosing spina bifida\n\nIn most cases, spina bifida is diagnosed before birth (prenatal). However, some mild cases may go unnoticed until after birth (postnatal). Very mild forms of spinal bifida are found when doing tests for other conditions or may never be detected.\n\nPrenatal Diagnosis\n\nThe most common screening methods to look for spina bifida during pregnancy are maternal serum alpha fetoprotein (MSAFP) screening and fetal ultrasound. A doctor can also perform an amniocentesis test.\n\nMaternal serum alpha fetoprotein (MSAFP) screen\u2014At 16 to 18 weeks of pregnancy (second trimester), a sample of the mother's blood is taken to measure the level of a protein called alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), which is made naturally by the fetus and placenta. Signs of spina bifida are not evident until the second trimester. During pregnancy, a small amount of AFP normally crosses the placenta and enters the mother's bloodstream. Abnormally high levels of AFP may indicate\u2014but not necessarily confirm\u2014the fetus has spina bifida or other neural tube defect. If a high level of AFP is detected, the doctor may request additional testing, such as an ultrasound or amniocentesis. This test is not specific for spina bifida. The MSAFP screen may be performed alone or as part of a larger, multiple-marker screen that looks for neural tube defects and other birth defects, including Down syndrome and other chromosomal abnormalities.\n\nUltrasound\u2014High-frequency sound waves create a picture of the developing baby inside the womb. It is highly accurate in diagnosing some birth defects during pregnancy, including spina bifida. Fetal ultrasound can be performed during the first trimester (usually between 11 to 14 weeks) and the second trimester (usually at 18 to 22 weeks), but diagnosis is more accurate during the second trimester.\n\nAmniocentesis\u2014A sample of the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus is removed and tested for protein levels that may indicate a neural tube defect or genetic disorder.\n\nPostnatal Diagnosis\n\nClosed neural tube defects are often spotted at birth due to an abnormal fatty mass, tuft or clump of hair, or a small dimple or birthmark on the skin at the site of the spinal malformation. Spina bifida occulta is usually found when x-rays are done for another reason.\n\nIn rare cases, myelomeningocele and meningocele are not diagnosed during routine prenatal tests. The baby will be diagnosed when it is born with a bubble on its back. Babies with myelomeningocele and closed neural tube defects may have muscle weakness in their feet, hips, and legs that result in joint deformities first noticed at birth. Mild cases of spina bifida (occulta and closed neural tube defects) that are not diagnosed during prenatal testing may be detected postnatally using ultrasound or X-ray imaging to look at the spine.\n\nDoctors may use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or a computed tomography (CT) scan to get a clearer view of the spinal cord and vertebrae. To evaluate for hydrocephalus, the doctor will request a head ultrasound, CT, or MRI to look for extra cerebrospinal fluid inside the brain.\n\nTreating Spina Bifida\n\nTreatment depends on the type of spina bifida. Myelomeningocele and meningocele require surgery to close the bubble shortly after birth to prevent infection such as meningitis. Most people with myelomeningocele have hydrocephalus and most of them will need a shunt placed as an infant. Children with a closed neural tube defect may need surgery to prevent further complications such as weakness and bowel and bladder function. Generally, people with spina bifida occulta will not need any treatment.\n\nPrenatal Surgery\n\nPrenatal surgery involves opening the mother's abdomen and uterus (or womb) and sewing the abnormal opening over the developing baby's spinal cord so that it is closed. This can protect the baby's spinal cord from ongoing damage in the uterus.\n\nThe Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) showed that prenatal surgery to close the defect in the spinal cord improved outcomes compared to children who had postnatal surgery for spina bifida. Prenatal surgery reduced the need to drain fluid from the brain, improved mobility, and increased the chances that a child will be able to walk independently early on. This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).\n\nSurgery does not restore lost neurological function but may prevent additional damage during the rest of the pregnancy. Prenatal surgery poses some risk to the fetus as well as to the mother.\n\nPostnatal Surgery\n\nIn treating myelomeningocele and meningocele, a child who has not had prenatal surgery will have surgery within the first few days of life to close the defect and minimize the risk of infection or further trauma to the exposed nerves and spinal cord.\n\nTethered cord syndrome can be treated with surgery to help prevent further neurological deterioration.\n\nTreatments for Complications\n\nSome children with myelomeningocele and closed neural tube defects will need surgery to improve the alignment of their feet, legs, or spine. Children with myelomeningocele usually have hydrocephalus and may require surgery to help drain fluid in the brain, such as the placement of a shunt or ETV. Multiple surgeries may be required to replace the shunt, which may become clogged, infected, or disconnected.\n\nSome individuals with myelomeningocele or closed neural tube defects require assistive devices for mobility such as:\n\nBraces\n\nWalkers Crutches\n\nWheelchairs\n\nChildren with myelomeningocele usually have some degree of delayed mobility, so they are referred to physical therapists early on to maximize their strength and function.\n\nTreatment for bladder and bowel dysfunction typically begins soon after birth. Children with myelomeningocele and some closed neural tube defects have damage to the lowest spinal nerves which control typical bowel and bladder function. Kidneys are monitored closely so that medications or surgeries can be performed to prevent renal failure. Close follow-up with a spina bifida specialty clinic is recommended to develop a safe bowel and bladder program.\n\nFolic Acid\u2014Folic acid (folate) is an important vitamin for the development of a healthy fetus. Although taking this vitamin cannot guarantee having a healthy baby, it can help. Studies show that women of childbearing age who add folic acid to their diets can significantly reduce the risk of having a child with a neural tube defect. Doctors recommended that all women of childbearing age take a daily vitamin supplement with 400 micrograms of folic acid before and during early pregnancy.\n\nFemales who already have a child with spina bifida, who have spina bifida themselves, or who have already had a pregnancy affected by any neural tube defect are at greater risk of having another child with a neural tube defect. They should take a higher prescription dose of folic acid before and early in pregnancy.\n\nFoods that are high in folic acid include:\n\nDark green, leafy vegetables\n\nEgg yolks\n\nSome fruits (banana, citrus, papaya)\n\nMany foods\u2014such as some breakfast cereals, enriched breads, flours, pastas, rice, and other grain products\u2014are now fortified with folic acid. Many multivitamins contain the recommended dosage of folic acid as well.\n\nWhat are the latest updates on spina bifida?\n\nThe National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), one of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is a primary federal supporter of research on brain and nervous system disorders. In addition to NINDS, other NIH Institutes support research on spina bifida and neural tube defects.\n\nGenetic studies\n\nIn one study supported by NINDS, scientists are looking at the hereditary basis of neural tube defects and hope to find the genetic factors that make some children more likely to have a neural tube defect. These researchers are also studying gene expression during the process of normal neural tube closure, which will provide information on the human nervous system during development.\n\nIn addition, NINDS-supported scientists are working to identify, characterize, and evaluate genes involved in neural tube defects. The goal is to understand the genetics of neural tube closure and to develop information that will lead to improved clinical care, treatment, and genetic counseling.\n\nOther scientists are studying genetic risk factors for spina bifida, especially those that reduce the effectiveness of folic acid in preventing spina bifida. This study will shed light on how folic acid prevents spina bifida and may lead to improved forms of folate supplements.\n\nDevelopmental studies\n\nNINDS supports and conducts a wide range of basic research studies to understand how the brain and nervous system develop. These studies contribute to a greater understanding of neural tube defects such as spina bifida and offer hope for new ways to treat and potentially prevent these disorders as well as other birth defects.\n\nSurgery\n\nResults of the Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) showed significant benefit to the developing baby. Because fetal surgery has shown promise, NINDS-funded researchers are also developing new methods, such as stem cell patches and tissue engineering, to add to the prenatal repair of spinal defects.\n\nMore research efforts\n\nMore information about research on spina bifida can be found using NIH RePORTER, a searchable database of current and past research projects supported by NIH and other federal agencies. RePORTER also includes links to publications and resources from these projects.\n\nfile-medical Learn About Clinical Trials Clinical trials are studies that allow us to learn more about disorders and improve care. They can help connect patients with new and upcoming treatment options.\n\nHow can I or my loved one help improve care for people with spina bifida?\n\nConsider participating in a clinical trial so clinicians and scientists can learn more about spina bifida. Clinical research uses human volunteers to help researchers learn more about a disorder and perhaps find better ways to safely detect, treat, or prevent disease.\n\nAll types of volunteers are needed\u2014those who are healthy or may have an illness or disease\u2014of all different ages, sexes, races, and ethnicities to ensure that study results apply to as many people as possible, and that treatments will be safe and effective for everyone who will use them.\n\nFor information about participating in clinical research visit NIH Clinical Research Trials and You.

Spina bifida is not a one-size-fits-all condition.\u201d\n\nSpina bifida is a birth defect of the spine. People living with spina bifida can have limited or no feeling in certain parts of their body. This limited feeling may leave them unable to feel pressure sores that may develop in areas with continuous pressure from equipment they need to move around, such as under and around braces, specially designed shoes, or wheelchairs.\n\nStaff at spina bifida specialty clinics participating in CDC\u2019s National Spina Bifida Patient Registry (NSBPR) collected data from 2009\u20132016. They found that 19% of children and adults enrolled in NSBPR reported a pressure sore since their last clinic visit.1 A study2 using hospital discharge information found that people with spina bifida who were hospitalized with pressure sores stayed in the hospital 1.2 days longer and had $1,182 in additional hospital costs, on average, compared to people with spina bifida who were hospitalized without pressure sores. In 2016, a pressure sore education and tracking program was designed by CDC and put into place at some NSBPR clinics. Tracking of pressure sores at these clinics is ongoing.\n\nBelow are the stories of three adults living with spina bifida who developed pressure sores. Read about their experiences, as well the advice they offer to other people living with spina bifida.\n\nRandi\u2019s Story\n\nRandi was born with a clubfoot. Her clubfoot was not corrected as a child, and she wears a brace. She has limited sensation on her foot and on one occasion, accidentally bumping her foot led to emergency surgery to amputate her small toe. On another occasion, after treating a small sore by wrapping a bandage around it, she discovered a few days later, that the bandage was rubbing against her skin so badly that she ended up with a much bigger sore. With more frequent health care appointments and a commitment to self-care, Randi made the difficult decision to put her career as a full-time cosmetologist on hold. She now works part-time as grocery store cashier, which gives her the flexibility to schedule doctor\u2019s appointments and regain her strength. She maintains her cosmetology license, and plans to return to the career she loves so much. \u201cSpina bifida is not a one-size-fits-all condition; neither are pressure sores. Some heal by themselves and some will lay you up for months or even a year. People need to understand the severity of what can happen so it doesn\u2019t happen to them. Paying attention to yourself is the biggest form of self-care you can do,\u201d says Randi.\n\nKaren\u2019s Story\n\nKaren has a background in managing physician medical groups for large medical systems. At a time when she had two young children and her husband was in medical school, she developed a small blister on her toe. The blister became a serious pressure sore that infected the skin, causing the bone to be exposed. Karen had to keep working since she was the one carrying the health insurance for her family, so she made the conscious decision to have her toe amputated. Like Randi, Karen was also born with a clubfoot. During the surgery to remove her toe, her surgeon also adjusted the shape of her foot. The combined surgical procedure left her having to relearn how to walk. Her advice for other adults living with spina bifida is to stay on top of pressure sores. \u201cDon\u2019t give up with your doctor; just keep pushing and saying the pressure sore won\u2019t heal, whether it\u2019s from sitting in a wheelchair all day or braces rubbing or using crutches. If it\u2019s been there for more than a week, it\u2019s probably going to need attention,\u201d says Karen.\n\nRobert\u2019s Story\n\nRobert\u2019s story illustrates how addressing one medical concern can lead to another problem. After years and years of using crutches and pulling himself up from falls, Robert tore the rotator cuffs in both his shoulders. A fall in 2015 did additional damage to his shoulders, causing him to use a wheelchair full-time. He had trouble transferring from higher levels to lower levels, so he bought an elevated toiled seat. Robert was unable to feel a serious pressure sore that had developed when the seam of the elevated toilet seat rubbed against his tailbone. The sore became very serious, resulting in exposed bone. He was hospitalized, and it took four months for the sore to heal completely. \u201cYou can take good care of yourself and still have problems. Watch out for signs of too much pressure. Consider your health and safety first of all,\u201d says Robert. His advice for adolescents and young adults with spina bifida who might not be comfortable asking for help with skin checks is, \u201cProtect your health and safety first and then after that think about independence. How independent do you look if you\u2019re laid up in the hospital or stretched out on the floor where you\u2019ve fallen?\u201d\n\nReferences\n\nResources"}, {"url": "https://www.medicinenet.com/how_long_can_you_live_with_spina_bifida/article.htm", "page_content": "Children with mild spina bifida can live long and active lives without treatment.\n\nMany children with spina bifida live into adulthood with the proper treatment and care.

'I was watching things slip away from my life.'\n\nWHAT IS SPINA BIFIDA? Spina bifida is a relatively common birth defect, affecting about 1,500 to 2,000 babies born in the US each year and around 700 in the UK annually. Babies born with spina bifida have improperly formed spines and spinal cords. During development these structures - along with the brain - all arise out of something called a neural tube, a precursor the entire central nervous system as well as the protective tissues that form around them. Typically, this tube forms and closes by the 28th week of pregnancy. But in babies with spina bifida, it doesn't close properly, for reasons that are not entirely clear yet to scientists. Instead, these babies are left with a gap in the vertebrae, through which part of the spinal cord may slip, depending the severity. People with the mildest form of spina bifida - the occulta form - may not even know they have it. The gap between their vertebrae is so small that the spinal cord stays in place and they are unlikely to experience any kind of neurological or motor symptoms. In the next more severe form of the condition, called meningocele, the the protective fluid and membranes around the spinal cord are pulled through a gap into a fluid filled sack on the exterior of the baby's back. There's no actual nervous tissue out of place, so there may be complications, but they're less likely to be life altering. But in open spina bifida, or myelomeningocele, there are larger or multiple openings along the spine. Both the membranes and spinal nerves and tissues they're meant to protect are pulled outside the baby at birth. The symptoms vary wildly based on where and how severe these openings are. Some children may develop little more than skin problems, while other with severe forms may be unable to walk or move properly, or develop infections like meningitis that can leave them with permanent brain damage. Making sure women get plenty of folic acid in pregnancy can help ensure the spinal cord develops properly. After birth, surgery to repair these openings may be performed and, in more recent years, some surgeons have begun repairing spina bifida in the womb.

Name variations: Madame de Gaulle. Born Yvonne Charlotte Anne-Marie Vendroux (pronunciation: Vahn-DROO) on May 22, 1900, in the family home in Calais, on the Channel coast of France; died on November 8, 1979, in the military hospital Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce, Paris; daughter of Jacques Vendroux (the head of a biscuit manufacturing company) and Marguerite (Forest) Vendroux; received primary and secondary education largely with private tutors at home; spent several years at a primary school, Notre-Dame in Calais; married Charles de Gaulle, on April 7, 1921 (a civil ceremony took place the previous day but it was the religious ceremony held April 7 that was regarded as their wedding by the de Gaulles); children: Philippe (b. December 28, 1921); Elisabeth de Boissieu (b. May 15, 1924); Anne de Gaulle (January 1, 1928\u2013February 6, 1948).\n\nChildhood years spent in family home in Calais; at age five, began primary education with private tutors (1905); as German forces advanced toward Calais at outset of WWI, Vendroux family took refuge in England (July\u2013August 1914); family returned to Calais (December 1914); cared for war wounded in Calais (1915\u201316); left Calais, under threat of German bombs, for safety in Paris (1916); as renewed German offensive threatened Paris (March 1918), sent out of harm's way to Mortagne, Brittany, then Perigueux (summer and autumn, 1918); worked with mother among the wounded war veterans in Calais (1919\u201320); met Charles de Gaulle (October 1920); after marriage, lived together in Paris (1921); moved with Charles, who was promoted to major and placed in charge of 19th Battalion of Light Infantry in Trier, Germany (1927); moved with family to Beirut (then in Syria, a French mandate of the League of Nations, now Lebanon), where Charles was posted (1929); returned to Paris (1931); purchased La Boisserie, an estate in the village of Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises, in the Haute-Marne department in eastern France (June 9, 1934); based in Metz where Charles commanded the 507th Tank Regiment (1937); outbreak of WWII (September 1, 1939); Germans entered Paris (June 14, 1940); de Gaulle family left France for London (June 17) where Charles' first BBC radio broadcast back to France called for resistance against Germany (June 18); moved to join Charles in liberated Algiers (July 1943); Allied invasion of Normandy (June 6, 1944); rejoined Charles, now head of the Provisional Government, in Neuilly, near Paris (September 1944); Charles resigned as head of the Provisional Government (January, 1946); moved back into La Boisserie(May 1946); death of daughter Anne, caused by pneumonia (February 6, 1948); returned to Paris with re-call of Charles to power during Algerian crisis (June 1, 1958); became \"first lady\" of France upon the inauguration of Charles as first president of the Fifth Republic (January 8, 1959); narrowly survived an assassination attempt in the company of her husband (August 22, 1962); retired to La Boisserie after referendum defeat of de Gaulle (April 1969); death of Charles de Gaulle (November 9, 1970).\n\nOn August 22, 1962, in the Paris suburb of Petit-Clamart, en route from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace to the town of Villacoublay, the French presidential car was ambushed by a commando who fired some 150 shots from automatic weapons. Fourteen bullets struck the car in which Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle, their son-in-law Alain de Boissieu, and the driver Francis Marroux were riding, on their way for a weekend at the presidential retreat in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. No one was hit. The Petit-Clamart attack was but the closest call in a series of assassination attempts by groups opposed to Charles de Gaulle's ceding of independence to the rebellious colony of Algeria. The general, at least according to some accounts, had been too proud even to drop to the floor during the fusillade, and, even though a bullet passed between their heads, Yvonne de Gaulle had also remained seated erect during the attack. Upon their arrival at Villacoublay, the general turned to his wife and said: \"Yvonne, you are brave.\"\n\nYvonne de Gaulle's behavior during and after the Petit-Clamart assassination attempt typified the stoicism, courage, and fidelity that characterized her entire adult life and for which she is remembered in France. Years after her death, President Richard Nixon remembered her having said in 1969, \"the presidency is temporary, the family permanent.\" The product of a middle-class Catholic family from Calais, in Normandy, Yvonne de Gaulle exemplified the \"dutiful wife and mother,\" silent in public but influential behind the scenes. Deeply religious and private, she kept to herself whatever complaints she might have had living with the self-assured and frequently cantankerous Charles de Gaulle. She lived so privately that, even as first lady in France during the 1960s, she was able to shop in Parisian stores without being recognized. Although her role came increasingly into question in the France of the 1960s, she nonetheless came to be respected in France as \"Tante Yvonne\" (Aunt Yvonne), during the presidency of her husband.\n\nThe daughter of Jacques and Marguerite Vendroux , Yvonne Vendroux was born on May 22, 1900, in the family home in Calais, on the Channel coast of France. Her father, who had gone into the biscuit-producing business, came from a long line of shipowners and local mayors and was himself vice president of the Chamber of Commerce, a municipal councilor, and the honorary consul of several foreign countries. He was, in French terms, a \"notable,\" or local dignitary. His family, the Van Droog, tobacco producers, had moved in the late 17th century from Delft in Holland to Dunkirk, where the name was changed to Vandroux; later the family moved to Calais, where the name was changed to Vendroux. Yvonne's mother, Marguerite Forest Vendroux, was the granddaughter of a well-known notary of the town of Charleville.\n\nMadame de Gaulle's importance was considerable not for what she said or did but for what she neither did nor said, by her silent presence. \u2014Andr\u00e9 Malraux\n\nYvonne Vendroux had a happy and stable childhood. Raised amid comfortable circumstances, the second of four children, she spent her early years with her family, in Calais in the winter and in a country estate in the Ardennes during the summer, where she went mountain climbing and developed a lifelong love of nature, especially flowers. Most of her schooling took place in the form of home tutoring. Dubious about the quality of the local schools after the 1905 separation of church and state in France, Yvonne's parents hired a tutor, Mademoiselle Delannoy , for her primary education. After 1907, she was sent for awhile as a day student to the local Notre-Dame boarding school, but her parents retained the tutor to supplement their daughter's education. Her secondary school education took place entirely at home.\n\nYvonne's first communion, in 1911, was followed by three relatively carefree years, broken with the onset of World War I in August 1914. As German forces advanced toward Calais and bombs fell on the town early in the war, the Vendroux family took refuge in Kent, in southern England. By the end of 1914, when it had become clear that the French forces would hold and Calais would be safe from German invasion, the Vendroux family returned. There, Yvonne's activities continued to revolve around the home as her mother cared for wounded war veterans. In 1916, seeking greater security, the family again left Calais for Paris, where Yvonne remained until March 1918, when a renewed German offensive led the family to send her and her sister Suzanne to Brittany. Now 18, Yvonne next went to Perigueux, where she spent the final days of World War I. With the end of the war, the Vendroux family turned to the restoration of their various properties in the Calais and Ardennes areas. Yvonne assumed an increasing role in household management, allowing her mother to continue to work in veterans' hospitals. Her older brother Jacques accompanied her as chaperon to the parties and balls in Paris and Calais. Yvonne soon joined her mother working among the war wounded, widows, and orphans.\n\nIn October 1920, at a tea arranged by family friends, Yvonne met Captain Charles de Gaulle, then on a brief leave from service with the French military mission in Poland. Shortly thereafter, he invited her to a ball at Saint-Cyr, the French military academy. Taken with Charles, Yvonne accepted and went in the company of Jacques. A few days later, asked directly about her feelings toward Charles, Yvonne replied, \"It will be he or no one.\" The families met, and the couple was officially affianced on November 11, 1920. Charles had to return for two additional months' service in Poland, then returned to France in February. He was named professor of history at Saint-Cyr, a post that would keep him in Paris.\n\nYvonne Vendroux and Charles de Gaulle were married in a civil ceremony in Calais on April 6, 1921, and in a religious ceremony the next day at the Notre-Dame Church in that city. Following their marriage, the young couple settled in a modest Paris apartment and lived a relatively quiet life. Their son Philippe was born at the end of 1921. In 1924, their second child, Elizabeth, was born. Charles finished his studies at the War College, published his first book, La Discorde chez l'Ennemi (Discord in the Enemy), and was posted as an officer working with Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain, the hero of World War I, with whose career his own would be dramatically crossed. In 1927, Yvonne de Gaulle joined her husband in a posting in Trier, Germany, where in 1928, their daughter Anne was born. Within months of Anne's birth, it had become clear that she was suffering from Down's syndrome. Anne was never to speak well or eat or dress unaided. Her illness was the great personal tragedy of the de Gaulles who cared for her tenderly.\n\nIn 1929, the de Gaulles were sent to Beirut, Lebanon, then part of French-controlled Syria, where they remained until 1931. In 1932, Yvonne's father died; her mother died the following year. At the end of 1933, Charles de Gaulle was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In June 1934, the de Gaulles bought \"La Boisserie,\" the estate of Yvonne's late parents, located in the village of Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises, in the gently rolling hills of the Haute-Marne department about midway between Paris and France's eastern frontier. The year 1934 also saw the publication of Charles' second book, Vers l'arm\u00e9e de m\u00e9tier (The Army of the Future), which argued, to little avail, that the French should adopt new mechanized forms of warfare. In 1937, Charles was given the command of the 507th Tank Regiment based in Metz. Life for the de Gaulle family revolved quietly around Paris, Metz, and La Boisserie.\n\nYvonne's domain was the family home at La Boisserie, her place of refuge from the turbulent political affairs surrounding her husband. She quietly endured the tragedy of Anne's disabilities while living with a man who was very much a lone rebel in political and military circles during the 1930s, and who clearly ruled as master of the household. Known for his arrogance, Charles was said to be a tyrant at home, with Yvonne silently bearing the brunt of his disappointment and frustration. Charles dominated conversations; Yvonne was told plainly, and sometimes publicly, that her opinion did not count. On more than one occasion Charles was observed telling his wife to be silent, that she could not possibly know anything about politics. Years later, an acquaintance said that compared to the cheerful if somewhat reticent young woman who had married Charles in 1921, the Yvonne of the late 1930s was profoundly sad.\n\nThe outbreak of war with Nazi Germany in September 1939 found Charles in command of his tank regiment. Poland was quickly crushed by the Germans, but the war with France involved little actual fighting in what became known as the dr\u00f4le de guerre, or phony war. This changed with the German thrust westward of May 10, 1940. The force of the German onslaught was such that, within days, Charles was writing from the front to Yvonne at La Boisserie, warning her to be ready for quick flight in the event that the military situation turned disastrous. On June 1, Charles was promoted to brigadier-general. Five days later, he was appointed undersecretary of state for National Defense and War by Premier Paul Reynaud. The Germans entered Paris on June 14. On June 16, the Reynaud government was replaced by one headed by Marshal P\u00e9tain, who was committed to seeking peace with the Germans. A day later, Yvonne with her three children and their governess left for England to join her husband, a political exile.\n\nFor the second time in her life, Yvonne de Gaulle experienced wartime exile in England. On June 18, Charles broadcast back to France, calling on the entire nation to resist the Germans and any French authority that supported collaboration with them. In London, their son Philippe, then 18 years old, joined the newly created Free French Navy in July. In addition to the occupation of her homeland, Yvonne had to accept the fact that her husband was now a rebel, standing almost alone against his country's legal government, which was headed by World War I hero and his own former sponsor, Marshal P\u00e9tain. Moreover, P\u00e9tain sentenced Charles to death in absentia for wartime desertion and treason. Yvonne set up a household in London as he organized what became the Free French resistance to Nazi Germany and the government of Vichy France. Whatever his other activities in wartime London, Charles was invariably present to tell Anne stories at her bedtime and to shield her from the press.\n\nTogether with other Londoners, Yvonne endured the German Blitz or air raids in the summer and fall of 1940, but ultimately her faith in her husband's vision was rewarded; the fortunes of war turned with the entry of the Soviet Union and the United States into combat against the Nazis. Following the liberation of French North Africa, the de Gaulle family returned to Algiers in June 1943. The liberation of metropolitan France, which began with the D-Day landings in Normandy, June 6, 1944, left the country under the Free French, reorganized as a Provisional Government and headed by Charles de Gaulle. In late August, Paris was liberated and by the end of September, almost all of metropolitan France had been cleared of Germans. Yvonne, now the wife of the leader of the Provisional Government, returned home to supervise the reconstruction of La Boisserie, which had been pillaged and partially burned during the Occupation. Charles, however, became increasingly dispirited as the politicians who had dominated prewar politics and, in his view, had brought on the catastrophe of 1940, regained strength, promising to recreate what he called the \"regime of parties.\" On January 3, 1946, a few weeks after the marriage of daughter Elisabeth to Commander Alain de Boissieu, Charles abruptly resigned his position. The family lived until May in an uncomfortable house rented from the government while La Boisserie was being restored and Charles waited restlessly to be recalled to power.\n\nIn 1946, with the help of Georges Pompidou, who later served as one of Charles' prime ministers and was to become his successor as president, the de Gaulles established the Anne de Gaulle Foundation to help handicapped girls. The Foundation was to care for Anne in the event that her parents predeceased her. Supported financially by the income from Charles' books, the Foundation built a house on a wooded hill in the Chevreuse valley. Staffed by six nuns and a mother superior, the house eventually provided for some 40 handicapped girls. Yvonne helped select them.\n\nIn April 1947, Charles created the Rassemblement du Peuple Fran\u00e7ais (Rally of the French People), a political party that was to serve as a vehicle for his return to power. Then, on February 6, 1948, Anne died of bronchial pneumonia at age 20. With the death of Anne, the Anne de Gaulle Foundation occupied much of Yvonne's attention. She also accompanied Charles throughout France as he campaigned for his new RPF, but by 1952, the party was fading and he ended it the next year. These years were spent, often with their grandchildren, at La Boisserie where Charles worked on his memoirs, with occasional trips abroad where he was received as the hero of the wartime French Resistance. To visitors at La Boisserie, Yvonne occasionally expressed the desire to protect her husband \"for history,\" and keep him out of politics. The tranquil life was interrupted, however, when the government's inability to suppress the Algerian rebellion led to rioting by European Algerians in the streets of Algiers on May 13, 1958. La Boisserie was quickly turned into a command post as Charles and his advisors planned his return to office. On June 1, Charles de Gaulle was voted in as premier by the National Assembly with full powers to write a new constitution for France. The result was France's Fifth Republic, with a much stronger presidency, filled in 1959 by Charles de Gaulle.\n\nOnce again, Yvonne de Gaulle was a reluctant first lady of France. During the early 1960s, Charles survived several assassination attempts by opponents of independence for Algeria. The closest call was the Petit-Clamart fusillade in 1962. Profiting by the wave of sympathy engendered by the assassination attempt, Charles proposed a constitutional change to elect the president by universal suffrage, which was approved by popular referendum in October. In 1965, against Yvonne's will, he stood as a candidate for the presidency. Forced into a runoff with Socialist candidate Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, Charles was elected in the second round to a seven-year term.\n\nTo many in 1960s France, \"Aunt Yvonne\" came to represent the wife of a previous era. She accompanied Charles to innumerable Paris Opera galas, where she sat through close to 30 performances of \"Carmen,\" and hosted the Kennedys, Khrushchevs, and many other world leaders. The comparison of the prim and somewhat dowdy Yvonne, who scrupulously supervised the household affairs of France's presidential \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, with the youthful and fashionable Jacqueline Kennedy , who accompanied her husband, then president of the United States, on a visit to Paris in 1961, was played out in the international press. Wearing sedate black, gray, or mauve dresses designed by Paris couturier Jacques Heim, Yvonne avoided d\u00e9colletage and shunned the more up-to-date fashions of Coco Chanel . Yvonne's successor as France's first lady, Claude Pompidou , recalled later that Yvonne's only advice to her had been to wear hats. Yvonne arranged the floral decorations of the palace, and she loved to travel and accompany her husband on all his official trips abroad, but whenever possible, she returned\n\nto La Boisserie and the gardens that were her favorite pastime.\n\nA strict Catholic, Yvonne set an austere tone at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, making sure the private lives of those in her husband's entourage passed moral muster. Exerting a considerable, if private, influence, she saw to it that divorcees were weeded out of influential positions and excluded from presidential social functions. She was equally severe in her judgments of much of the literature and film of the 1960s and carefully scrutinized the selection of films to be shown in the palace. For her religious devotions, she had a special chapel built inside the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.\n\nYvonne was with Charles when, during the height of the student and worker unrest of May 1968, he traveled to Baden-Baden to consult with French generals about the possibility of his resigning. She shared his disappointment, when, in April 1969, in a referendum he had called on behalf of decentralizing political reforms, he was defeated. Having staked his political prestige on the referendum, Charles immediately resigned. The couple returned to La Boisserie, where on November 9, 1970, Charles died. Yvonne continued to live there, where she cooked, knitted, and tended her garden, visited often by her children and four grandchildren until the fall of 1978, when she withdrew to the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception convent in Paris. In July 1979, she was operated on in Paris for an intestinal obstruction. Readmitted to a Paris military hospital, she died November 8, 1979. She was buried beside Charles and Anne at the church cemetery in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. Surviving Yvonne, in addition to her son Philippe and daughter Elisabeth, were her grandchildren and one great-grandson. Mourned as the symbol of moral rectitude and marital fidelity of a long gone era, \"Tante Yvonne\" was called the \"minister of common sense\" in the government of General Charles de Gaulle. Following her death, La Boisserie, which remained in the possession of Philippe, was converted into a museum, open to the public, in honor of the de Gaulles.\n\nsources:\n\nB\u00e9liard, Jean. \"Entretien avec Richard Nixon,\" in Institut Charles de Gaulle.

What is spina bifida occulta? Spina bifida occulta is a condition where a gap forms between the small bones (vertebrae) of your backbone (spine). Spina bifida occulta is mild and is the most common type of spina bifida. Spina bifida is a condition present at birth (a congenital birth defect) caused by your spine forming incorrectly during fetal development. The word \u201cocculta\u201d means \u201chidden.\u201d Spina bifida occulta is also known as hidden spina bifida because a small layer of skin covers the opening of your spinal vertebrae. Who does spina bifida occulta affect? Spina bifida occulta can affect anyone. Some people are at a higher risk of having a child with spina bifida occulta if: A parent has a lack of folic acid (vitamin B9) during pregnancy. Folic acid is a vitamin (B9) found in leafy vegetables, beans, whole grains and several other foods.\n\nYou have a history of spina bifida in your family (genetic).\n\nParents who become pregnant have conditions like diabetes or obesity.\n\nYour baby has a genetic condition like Down syndrome, Edwards syndrome or Patau\u2019s syndrome.\n\nA parent is taking antiseizure medicines like valproate or carbamazepine. If you plan on becoming pregnant, talk to your healthcare provider about the medicines you currently take or if you want to learn more about your genetic family history through a genetic test. How common is spina bifida occulta? Spina bifida occulta is the most common type of spina bifida and the condition affects 10% to 20% of the U.S. population. How does spina bifida occulta affect my body? Spina bifida occulta is mild and rarely causes symptoms that affect your body in ways that other types of spina bifida do, especially symptoms that affect movement during childhood. About 1 in 1,000 people diagnosed with spina bifida occulta will experience symptoms as their spinal cord stretches. This could happen during adolescence after a growth spurt. You might experience symptoms that affect your muscle strength, bladder and bowel control. Treatment relieves these symptoms to reduce the amount of tension in your spinal cord.\n\nSymptoms and Causes What are the symptoms of spina bifida occulta? Spina bifida occulta is a mild form of spina bifida and rarely causes symptoms. Children diagnosed with spina bifida occulta might have a visible mark on their skin at the lower part of the back when they\u2019re born that appears as a lump, a red or purple patch (hemangioma), a dark spot (birthmark) or a dimple. Symptoms of spina bifida occulta affect the function of specific parts of your body caused by damage to your nerves (neurologic deficit), which could include: Bowel and/or bladder problems (constipation, incontinence).\n\nBack pain.\n\nMuscle weakness (legs).\n\nScoliosis. Can spina bifida occulta become symptomatic in adulthood? Only 1 in 1,000 people diagnosed with spina bifida experience symptoms, which normally appear as their spinal cord stretches during adolescence after a growth spurt. Most children don\u2019t experience symptoms of spina bifida occulta. These symptoms could worsen during late adolescence and adulthood as their spinal cord stretches. What causes spina bifida occulta? The cause of spina bifida occulta is unknown. Research suggests that the cause could relate to several genetic, nutritional and environmental factors, including: A lack of folic acid (vitamin B9) during pregnancy.\n\nA history of the condition in your family (genetic).\n\nA parent who has unmanaged diabetes.\n\nA parent who has obesity.\n\nA reaction to medicine that treats epilepsy like valproate or carbamazepine. Always talk to your healthcare provider if you anticipate becoming pregnant to understand your risk of having a child with a condition like spina bifida occulta. They\u2019ll advise on whether you need to start adding folic acid to your diet or whether or not your current medications pose a threat to the health of your child.\n\nDiagnosis and Tests How is spina bifida occulta diagnosed? A spina bifida diagnosis occurs prenatally during an ultrasound, but since spina bifida occulta is mild and \u201chidden,\u201d many cases of spina bifida occulta go undiagnosed or receive a diagnosis later in adulthood, as there are rarely symptoms from this condition. Most often, the diagnosis of spina bifida occulta happens after an accident or injury when an X-ray of your spine is necessary. Imaging tests, like an X-ray, MRI or CT scan, diagnose spina bifida occulta. The imaging test shows a clear picture of the bones in your spine that irregularly formed during fetal development.\n\nManagement and Treatment How is spina bifida occulta treated? Most cases of spina bifida occulta don\u2019t need treatment. If symptoms occur, treatment focuses on reducing the amount of tension on your spinal cord. Treatments could include: Surgery to close the gap between the vertebrae of your backbone.\n\nPhysical or occupational therapy to improve muscle strength.\n\nUsing mobility equipment like a back brace, walker or wheelchair.\n\nTaking medicine to treat bladder or bowel problems. What types of medications treat spina bifida occulta? Medications might be necessary to treat symptoms of spina bifida occulta, including: Pain medicine for back pain.\n\nLaxatives, suppositories and/or enemas for bowel symptoms.\n\nAntibiotics to prevent infections after surgery.\n\nMedicines to relax your bladder for bladder symptoms.\n\nPrevention How can I reduce my risk of spina bifida occulta? Since the cause of spina bifida occulta is unknown, you can\u2019t prevent the condition. If you plan to become pregnant, you can take steps to reduce your risk of having a child with spina bifida occulta by: Taking folic acid: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends taking 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid daily. This could reduce your risk of having a child with spina bifida by up to 75%.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends taking 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid daily.

Getting a genetic test: If you have a history of genetic conditions in your family, talk to your healthcare provider about genetic testing to understand your risk of having a child with a genetic condition.\n\nOutlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have spina bifida occulta? There isn\u2019t a cure for spina bifida occulta. If you have this condition, you might not know you have it, as symptoms are rare and mild. Every case of spina bifida occulta affects each person differently. Treatment can ease symptoms if you do experience discomfort caused by your spinal cord stretching.\n\nLiving With How do I take care of myself? Each diagnosis of spina bifida occulta is unique. Most cases won\u2019t impact your day-to-day ability to thrive. Follow your healthcare provider\u2019s treatment plan to alleviate your symptoms if you do experience them. When should I see my healthcare provider? Visit your healthcare provider if you experience symptoms of spina bifida occulta, especially if your symptoms affect your movement. If symptoms prevent you from completing your daily routine or prevent you from going to school or work due to pain, or affect your inability to control your bowels, visit your healthcare provider for treatment. What questions should I ask my doctor? Am I at risk of having another child diagnosed with spina bifida occulta?\n\nHow can I stay healthy during my pregnancy?\n\nWhat are the risks of surgery to treat spina bifida occulta?\n\nAre there side effects to the treatment you recommended?"}, {"url": "https://www.neurosurgery.columbia.edu/patient-care/conditions/spina-bifida", "page_content": "Spina = Latin: \u201cspine\u201d\n\nBifida = Latin: \u201csplit\u201d\n\nSpina bifida is one of the most common birth defects in the world. It occurs when an embryo\u2019s developing neural tube, the precursor to the brain and spinal cord, does not close correctly. Spina bifida may affect the spinal cord itself, the coverings of the spinal cord, and/or the bones of the spine. It is one of several forms of spinal dysraphism or malformation of the spinal cord.\n\nThere are three kinds of spina bifida. The most severe form is called myelomeningocele, aperta, or open spina bifida. In this form, there is an open channel from the skin to the the spinal cord or its coverings. The defect can usually be seen on fetal ultrasound and is visible to the naked eye in a newborn. Therefore, this form is always diagnosed either in utero or in newborn infants.\n\nSurgery to close the defect is performed within the first days of life. This surgery prevents further damage to the spinal cord, but no surgery can yet repair spinal cord damage that has already occurred. Therefore, as adults, people with open spina bifida generally have some amount of weakness or paralysis. (Note that the condition is called open spina bifida, but that children and adults with the condition do not still have an open channel from the skin to the spinal cord. The surgery performed within the first days of life closes that channel.)\n\nOpen spina bifida is often associated with other neurological conditions. Therefore, adults with open spina bifida benefit from regular access to neurosurgical care. Neurosurgeons like those of the Spine Hospital at the Neurological Institute of New York can help monitor conditions like hydrocephalus, Chiari malformation, and tethered cord, all of which are common among people with open spina bifida.\n\nA moderate form of spina bifida, meningocele, is usually discovered in infancy as well. Meningocele causes fewer symptoms than open spina bifida, and is the rarest form of spina bifida.\n\nThe mildest form of spina bifida is also the most common called spina bifida occulta, or closed spina bifida, it affects only the bones of the spinal column and is not always diagnosed in infancy. Instead, adults may be alarmed when an X-ray or other spinal imaging procedure reveals in passing that they have (and always have had) this birth defect. In fact, up to 10% of people have spina bifida occulta. It is very rare for the condition to cause any symptoms or need any kind of treatment."}]}
