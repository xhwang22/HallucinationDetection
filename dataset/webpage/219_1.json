{"Andy Hurley is best known as the drummer of the rock band Fall Out Boy.": [{"url": "https://www.musicradar.com/news/fall-out-boys-andy-hurley-for-a-long-time-i-had-doubts-that-i-could-play-drums-anymore", "page_content": "Fall Out Boy first emerged from the early 2000s hardcore punk scene in Chicago.\n\nThe band - formed by bassist Pete Wentz, guitarist Joe Trohman and guitarist/singer Patrick Stump - stood head and shoulders above the competition with their extraordinary melodies, gigantic hooks and Stump\u2019s incredible vocal.\n\nPeople really started to take note with the release of debut album Take This To Your Grave in 2003, the first Fall Out Boy music to feature straight-edge, heavy metal-loving Andy Hurley on drums. The album was a pop-punk masterpiece that established Hurley as a force to be reckoned with behind the kit - equal parts Travis Barker and Dave Lombardo.\n\nThe band went on to achieve monumental success with follow-up album From Under The Cork Tree, which spawned mega hit Sugar We\u2019re Goin Down, followed by Infinity On High and Folie \u00e0 Deux. While shy guy Andy wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the ever-increasing limelight, he let his memorable drum parts do the talking. By 2010 Fall Out Boy were burned out and a three-year hiatus was quickly announced.\n\nAndy fed his passion for heavy metal and hardcore punk, recording and touring with bands including Enabler and Earth Crisis, and forming heavy rock band The Damned Things with Trohman. Andy still uses downtime from Fall Out Boy to play with hardcore band, Sect. Fall Out Boy returned refreshed and fighting fit in 2012, releasing three chart-topping albums in a row, culminating in this year\u2019s Mania.\n\nWhile the band\u2019s sound has evolved through the years, their core DNA remains, and Fall Out Boy continue to sell out arenas around the world. We hooked up with Andy Hurley during the recent UK tour to learn more about the band\u2019s incredible journey.\n\nYou joined Fall Out Boy around 2003. What were the circumstances surrounding that?\n\n\u201cI was in hardcore bands with Pete [Wentz] for years. At the time I was going to college and playing in three bands. That\u2019s why they didn\u2019t ask me to join when they first started, but they needed someone to fill in for a tour and then they were recording some demos.\n\n\"The guy producing it, Sean O\u2019Keefe who also produced Take This To Your Grave, asked if I could play on them. I loved the music they were making. The music being written for the demos, which became Take This To Your Grave, was the best stuff I had ever been a part of.\u201d\n\nHow would you describe your drumming at the time?\n\n\u201cI think I reached my peak back then and I\u2019ve been coasting on that for 15 years! Not really. I think that\u2019s probably when I started coming into my own as a drummer, being in bands and figuring out how to play with a band. Joining Fall Out Boy was the best education for that.\u201d\n\nDid you have much recording experience before Take This To Your Grave?\n\n\u201cI\u2019d recorded with a few projects, but never anything like that. We recorded a lot of it in Madison, at Butch Vig\u2019s studio [Smart Studios]. It was the biggest studio and the biggest thing we\u2019d done. There was a microphone that Kurt Cobain used in that studio! Everything I\u2019d done [before that] was with friends, or in much smaller studios.\u201d\n\nWhat did you learn from the experience?\n\n\u201cConfidence. For a long time, even on From Under The Cork Tree and Infinity On High, I had doubts that I could play anymore. From Under The Cork Tree was the first major label record we did, so that was an even bigger thing than Take This To Your Grave. I guess Take This To Your Grave was the beginning of finding comfort - of knowing what I\u2019m doing and not over thinking it.\u201d\n\nFrom collaborating so much I\u2019m better at hearing what the core DNA rhythm is in a song\n\nBetween Take This To Your Grave and Mania, Fall Out Boy\u2019s sound has evolved. Would you say your drumming has developed in tandem with that?\n\n\u201cMaybe a little. After the hiatus there was a bigger tweak. I think it follows with being in a band with songwriters who have specific ideas. Both Joe [Trohman] and Patrick [Stump] have certain things they want accented on the drums, so every aspect of every song is a collaborative thing.\n\n\"I might have an idea for a kick pattern and it totally goes against the vocal pattern. I think the evolution is just being more subservient to what the song requires. On Mania, it\u2019s the most real drums you\u2019ll hear on songs in the modern Fall Out Boy era. On the last couple of records there\u2019s drums for the whole thing, but a lot of times they\u2019re mixed with drum loops or cut up.\u201d\n\nFrom Under The Cork Tree and Infinity On High are the band\u2019s biggest-selling albums. What do you remember about the writing and recording and did you have an inkling they were going to be hits?\n\n\u201cI think we knew that we\u2019d written some great songs and a great album, but I don\u2019t think we had any idea it would be as big as it was. I think it was just a belief that this is the best work we\u2019ve done to this point. You can rally behind that.\n\n\u201cThere was a moment in the recording of Sugar We\u2019re Goin Down where Patrick did a take of a harmony or something and there was just a look when he came into the booth where we were like, \u2018This is a hit!\u2019 He\u2019s got an amazing voice and I think that is a big reason for our success. He\u2019s just so talented. Obviously, that\u2019s all bluster and jokes in the studio; you have no idea if anyone will care.\u201d\n\nDid those two albums come together fairly easily?\n\n\u201cCork Tree... and Infinity... took work. Sugar\u2026 went through a lot of different iterations before it became the song that it was. The original verse I remember I hated. The idea for what the verse became happened last minute, right before recording. That saved it for me.\n\n\"There was a lot of stuff that we had to hash out in the rehearsal space for both albums. I don\u2019t really hear the songs until I\u2019m in the studio now. It\u2019s become much more on the fly, which I really love. I think different ideas come to me more than if I had the time to do what I\u2019d normally feel like doing. It\u2019s more instinctive.\u201d\n\nThe drum parts are a key element of Fall Out Boy\u2019s sound. How much input comes from the other guys?\n\n\u201cPatrick is a drummer and so he\u2019s big on specific rhythms and patterns. And Joe, with The Damned Things stuff - there were a lot of specific things he wanted. Other bands I\u2019ve played in recently have had people who were either drummers or really adept at writing drum parts in their demoing.\n\n\"I really like when there\u2019s a specific thing that someone wants to hear. I think that from collaborating so much I\u2019m better at hearing what the core DNA rhythm is in a song to begin with.\u201d\n\nDo you remember a point at which things were getting noticeably bigger for Fall Out Boy?\n\n\u201cI guess it was the Warped Tour in 2005, the year From Under The Cork Tree came out. That was us and My Chem. It was the year where it was getting pretty crazy. Even the year before, we had a show on some really small stage, I think it was in Detroit, and the crowd was too big and they knocked the fence down.\n\n\"There were a few shows like that here and there, but that year of Warped Tour was where every show felt like that.\u201d\n\nThen things went stratospheric! You seem a fairly private guy. How comfortable did you feel with the limelight?\n\n\u201cIt was something you get used to. I definitely don\u2019t like photoshoots, but I\u2019m pretty comfortable with it now. For stuff like [drum magazines] it\u2019s just me, but with the full band it\u2019s a little easier because I can be the fourth person in the group and don\u2019t necessarily have to carry it. That\u2019s usually Pete. He\u2019s really photogenic and good at that stuff.\u201d\n\nThe size of gigs changed dramatically too...\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing Sect shows during any off-time from Fall Out Boy. The weekend before we came out here I was in the midwest for three shows. We played a VFW [Veterans of Foreigh Wars] hall, a basement and a small club.\n\n\"To be honest, that actually makes me more nervous than playing an arena. I\u2019m used to [big shows]. I can\u2019t focus on any one person. A basement show, where there\u2019s going to be at most 50 people, I can see everyone and any mistakes are bigger because I\u2019m right in front of them.\n\n\"I\u2019m more comfortable because I feel more plugged into something at a smaller show, but I also feel like I have to play better. Actually, I don\u2019t have to worry about a lot of stuff at a show this size, whereas I worry a lot about the Sect shows because I have to make sure I have a kit, bring a snare and cymbals. I\u2019ll confess, I\u2019ve forgotten sticks once before! That\u2019s all coming from a situation where I don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d\n\nWhich drum parts would you say define your playing in Fall Out Boy?\n\n\u201cTake This To Your Grave is the one where I was trying to emulate Travis Barker and guys like that the most. I was playing more beats that go around the kit.\n\n\"I think there\u2019s stuff on Mania in terms of fills or just a stripped-down beat that I\u2019m most proud of. Last year my big inspiration in terms of drumming was Danzig\u2019s Chuck Biscuits. I think he\u2019s just one of the best drummers because he\u2019s so hard hitting. He\u2019s playing exactly what\u2019s needed.\n\n\"His fills, while simple, are better than a fill I would choose to do. I was a Dave Lombardo-influenced drummer growing up, so I tried to call Chuck\u2019s spirit into my playing more on Mania.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve played on plenty of hardcore and metal albums too. What do you consider to be your drumming highlights outside of Fall Out Boy?\n\n\u201cI think the Enabler record has a lot of stuff I\u2019m really proud of. Sect is probably the highlight of my musical career. The last record we did, which came out last year, is called No Cure For Death. Stylistically, what\u2019s being played is really fun, it\u2019s fast and fill-y and double bass-y and blast beat-y. But it\u2019s also about the people in it.\n\n\"There\u2019s a guy from Earth Crisis, who were one of my favourite bands growing up. The singer was in Cursed, which is my favourite hardcore band. They\u2019re also a vegan straight-edge band, which is important to me.\u201d\n\nFall Out Boy took a break between 2010 and 2012, during which time you stayed busy with a number of different music projects. Was it important to do things that were completely removed from FoB?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the impetus was that it needed be different, I think it was just about doing stuff. The hiatus was really difficult because you become so institutionalised to having a schedule laid out for a year and a half to two years. When you don\u2019t have anything, at that time it was really difficult for me. It was depressing.\n\n\"You spend all this time on tour being like, \u2018I just wish I was home and had nothing to do.\u2019 Then you have nothing to do for two weeks and you\u2019re like, \u2018I have no idea what to do with my life.\u2019\n\n\u201cA lot of cool opportunities came. That\u2019s where I met Earth Crisis through a mutual friend who was managing them and I filled in on a tour. Then I did the Enabler record and some tours with that. The Damned Things was the big one. That was awesome. I think that more just speaks to the fact that heavy metal and hardcore is the kind of music I grew up with.\u201d\n\nDid you take time to work on your playing during that period?\n\n\u201cNo. I met Tomas Haake from Meshuggah and asked him what he does to warm up or practise at home. He said, \u2018Nothing\u2019. When he\u2019s off he goes fishing. He doesn\u2019t touch drums. That\u2019s the case for me.\n\n\"On the hiatus I was playing a lot more with friends\u2019 bands and staying busy with that. Tomas said that he got to a place where he could play what he wants to play and then coasted, I guess.\n\n\"I can play all the kinds of music I want to play and that\u2019s what I love about music. I\u2019ve never been a dude who\u2019s practising every day to play crazier stuff.\n\n\u201cMy drum tech, Brandon, plays in this band Misery Signals. He\u2019s the best drummer I know. He\u2019s so technically proficient. He practises every day for two hours. He\u2019s always pushing himself to be better. I\u2019ve just never had that drive. But that\u2019s not to say that when there\u2019s something I want to play in a band and I\u2019m not able to nail it I won\u2019t practise and really work on things.\u201d\n\nDid you return to Fall Out Boy with renewed vigour?\n\n\u201cTotally. We couldn\u2019t come back putting out the same records and we wouldn\u2019t want to. That challenge to evolve with the times is fun and it keeps things interesting. I definitely think the break cleared my palette so I could plug in to the new form that Fall Out Boy existed in easier than if I wasn\u2019t doing these projects that let me loose.\n\n\u201cOn the Sect and Enabler records I\u2019d do takes of just fills - just filling through a whole song and figuring out what works best. It\u2019s interesting because coming back from hiatus, that\u2019s what I did for Fall Out Boy. I\u2019d do takes of just the beat that\u2019s going to be mixed with a loop or whatever and then we\u2019d do takes of fills, just to see if something comes out of it.\u201d\n\nA lot of bands that came up at the same time as Fall Out Boy are no longer about. You guys are still releasing Number 1 albums and selling out big venues. What do you think it is that keeps people coming back for more?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really thankful for the opportunity and the fact that people still care. I don\u2019t really fully understand why. We try to evolve and push our boundaries, because we want to and because it\u2019s a challenge to us to do something different every time while maintaining the DNA that makes us who we are. Maybe that\u2019s something that speaks to people, the fact that we\u2019re still inspired to make music that we love.\u201d\n\nIf you hadn\u2019t joined Fall Out Boy, what would you be doing today?\n\n\u201cI just watched an interview with [Star Wars actor] John Boyega on Desus and Mero\u2019s podcast. It\u2019s called Bodega Boys. They just talk about pop culture stuff. They asked John Boyega what he\u2019d be doing if he wasn\u2019t acting and he said, \u2018This is what I\u2019d be doing\u2019. This was his one option, there was no plan B. I feel the same way. If I\u2019m not doing this I\u2019ll be dead. If I wasn\u2019t in this band I\u2019d be in another band, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://genius.com/artists/Andy-hurley", "page_content": "About Andy Hurley\n\nAndrew John Hurley, (born on May 31, 1980 in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin) is the drummer of the pop punk / emo punk / alternative rock band Fall Out Boy.\n\nHe was brought up by his mother, who worked as a nurse.

His mother took care of him for the rest of his childhood and teenage. Andy had saxophone as his very first musical instrument that he learned playing well and along with that, he also played percussion in his school\u2019s marching band.\n\nRecommended Lists:\n\nCareer\n\nAndy\u2019s introduction to professional music happened back when he was in the high school and was slowly gaining interest in playing drums. The year was 1996 and Andy was searching for opportunities to play with some big bands and in the pursuit of his dreams, he became part of several hardcore punk and heavy metal bands such as Killtheslavemaster, Racetraitor, Project Rocket and The Kill Pill. He was unable to find his true calling and kept trying different bands during this time.\n\nThe hardcore metal was getting popular in the late 90s and Andy\u2019s drumming skills got him gigs here and there but nothing concrete was coming across his way. However, things changed for the best in the year 2003, when one of his best high school friends Pete Wentz invited Andy to be a part of their band which was called the Fall Out Boy as they were in dire need of an additional drummer due to some troubles with their previous one, and it didn\u2019t take Andy much time to become a regular with Fall Out Boy.\n\nHis association with the band was extremely successful and despite the fact that this was the fourth band Andy was in, he got the fame in such a short time which he wasn\u2019t able to achieve through his previous stints in more than 5 years. Andy recorded the album \u2018Take This To Your Grave\u2019 with the band Fall Out Boy in 2003 to a mega universal success which helped Andy to become one of the hottest drummers around.\n\nIt was the first album by the band which was considered to be an actual hit and the band was reported by the media outlets to be the next big thing. The success continued with their next album titled \u2018From Under the Cork Tree\u2019, which climbed at the 9th spot in the Billboard 200 chart and the band spent the year 2005 touring around with their new found success. The album later went on to earn a Grammy nomination for the best New Artist.\n\nThe next two studio albums by the band titled \u2018Infinity on High\u2019 and \u2018Folie a Deux\u2019 also went on to achieve mega success in their concerts and digital downloads. However, Wentz faced severe emotional trouble during that time which also included a failed suicide attempt. It was being said that he is unable to handle the new found success the band was having and that, among several other things, led the band to take a break for some time in 2009.\n\nAndy got himself busy with several other projects and played for different bands such as a heavy metal band The Damned Things. The band was mostly a collaborative effort and featured members from Fall Out Boy, Anthrax and Every Time I Die and released their very first album titled \u2018Ironiclast\u2019. Enabler, another hard core band, hired Andy and in summer 2012, Enabler released their first album with Andy as a drummer titled \u2018All Hail the Void\u2019.\n\nLater in 2012, Andy joined a straight edge hard rock band named FocusedXminds, and during that time, media speculations were ripe about Fall Out Boy making a comeback and it was said that Andy will leave FocusedXminds when that happens. Fall Out Boy made a reappearance onto the musical sky in 2013, but Andy continued his association with FocusedXminds."}, {"url": "https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Andy_Hurley", "page_content": "Ultimately I am an employee of a corporation, and that\u2019s weird, and does contradict some of the things I believe in.

No other band, however, could provide him with the same kind of notoriety as Fall Out Boy. Andy was a full-time member of the band until its hiatus in 2009. Andy has formerly been a member of the hardcore punk rock bands Race traitor, Kill the slave master, Project Rocket, and The Kill Pill. Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy has been a long-time buddy of Andy\u2019s, and their musical friendship dates back to their adolescent years. They\u2019ve both been in four different rock bands throughout the years. Following the breakup of Fall Out Boy in 2009, Andy joined \u2018The Damned Thing,\u2019 played briefly for another band, \u2018Enabler,\u2019 and was a member of a number of other big and small bands, producing numerous albums and singles. Fall Out Boy resurfaced in the music world in 2013 with the release of their album \u2018Save Rock and Roll.\u2019 The band went on tour and went on to achieve great success with their subsequent releases, and the band has been continuing strong ever since.\n\nChildhood and Adolescence\n\nAndy Hurley was born Andrew John Hurley on May 31, 1980, in Wisconsin, and lost his father when he was just five years old. His mother raised him throughout his youth and adolescence.\n\nAndy\u2019s first musical instrument was the saxophone, which he learned to play well, and he also played percussion in his school\u2019s marching band.\n\nIn college, he studied anthropology and history because pursuing a professional career in music was not on his agenda. He had believed since he was a child that humans should live as they did thousands of years ago, in their most primitive state, but as he grew older, most of his views disappeared.\n\nAndy\u2019s first exposure to professional music was when he was in high school, and he was gradually developing an interest in playing the drums.\n\nIn 1996, Andy was looking for possibilities to play with large bands, so he joined numerous hardcore punk and heavy metal bands, including Killtheslavemaster, Racetraitor, Project Rocket, and The Kill Pill, to pursue his aspirations. During this time, he was unable to discover his true calling and continued to experiment with other bands.\n\nIn the late 1990s, hardcore metal was becoming popular, and Andy\u2019s drumming skills landed him a few gigs here and there, but nothing substantial.\n\nHowever, things changed for the better in 2003, when one of Andy\u2019s best high school friends, Pete Wentz, offered him to join his band, Fall Out Boy, as they were in desperate need of an additional drummer owing to problems with their previous one, and Andy quickly became a regular with Fall Out Boy.\n\nDespite the fact that this was Andy\u2019s fourth band, he was able to attain a level of fame in such a short period of time that he had not been able to achieve in his prior tenure of more than five years.\n\nAndy released the album \u2018Take This To Your Grave\u2019 with the band Fall Out Boy in 2003, which became a worldwide smash hit, propelling Andy to the top of the drumming world.\n\nIt was the band\u2019s first album to be regarded as a true hit, and the band was dubbed \u201cthe next big thing\u201d by the media.\n\nThe band\u2019s popularity continued with their following album, \u2018From Under the Cork Tree,\u2019 which reached number 9 on the Billboard 200 chart, and they spent the year 2005 touring with their newfound fame. The CD was later nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Artist.\n\nThe band\u2019s following two studio albums, \u2018Infinity on High\u2019 and \u2018Folie a Deux,\u2019 both achieved massive success in concert and as digital downloads. Wentz, on the other hand, was going through a lot of emotional turmoil at the time, which included a failed suicide attempt.\n\nIt was claimed that he was unable to handle the band\u2019s newfound success, which, among other factors, caused the band to take a break for a period of time in 2009.\n\nAndy became involved in a number of other projects and performed with many bands, including the heavy metal outfit The Damned Things. The band was largely a collaboration, including members from Fall Out Boy, Anthrax, and Every Time I Die, and they published their debut album, \u201cIroniclast.\u201d\n\nEnabler, another hardcore band, hired Andy, and in the summer of 2012, Enabler released \u2018All Hail the Void,\u2019 their debut album with Andy as a drummer.\n\nLater in 2012, Andy joined FocusedXminds, a straight edge hard rock band. At the time, media speculation about Fall Out Boy making a comeback was rife, and it was speculated that Andy would depart FocusedXminds if that happened. In 2013, Fall Out Boy returned to the music scene, but Andy remained with FocusedXminds.\n\nFall Out Boy\u2019s next studio album, \u2018Save Rock and Roll,\u2019 was released in 2013, and it was followed by \u2018American Beauty/American Psycho,\u2019 which reached number one on the Billboard 200 chart. The band went on a global tour to promote the records and continued their winning trend.\n\nAndy\u2019s Personal Experiences\n\nAndy Hurley has been a devout vegan since the age of 16 and has always maintained the conviction that humans have damaged the planet and that we will one day live as our ancestors did 10,000 years ago.\n\nWhen asked why he doesn\u2019t live like a primitive human, he responded he has to make a livelihood one way or another.\n\nHe now has a home in Oregon, where he has kept his original drum set safe.\n\nEstimated Net worth\n\nAndy Hurley is a $14 million dollar musician and drummer from the United States. Andy Hurley was born in the town of Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin."}], "Andy Hurley has recorded six studio albums with Fall Out Boy.": [{"url": "https://www.musicradar.com/news/fall-out-boys-andy-hurley-for-a-long-time-i-had-doubts-that-i-could-play-drums-anymore", "page_content": "Fall Out Boy first emerged from the early 2000s hardcore punk scene in Chicago.\n\nThe band - formed by bassist Pete Wentz, guitarist Joe Trohman and guitarist/singer Patrick Stump - stood head and shoulders above the competition with their extraordinary melodies, gigantic hooks and Stump\u2019s incredible vocal.\n\nPeople really started to take note with the release of debut album Take This To Your Grave in 2003, the first Fall Out Boy music to feature straight-edge, heavy metal-loving Andy Hurley on drums. The album was a pop-punk masterpiece that established Hurley as a force to be reckoned with behind the kit - equal parts Travis Barker and Dave Lombardo.\n\nThe band went on to achieve monumental success with follow-up album From Under The Cork Tree, which spawned mega hit Sugar We\u2019re Goin Down, followed by Infinity On High and Folie \u00e0 Deux. While shy guy Andy wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the ever-increasing limelight, he let his memorable drum parts do the talking. By 2010 Fall Out Boy were burned out and a three-year hiatus was quickly announced.\n\nAndy fed his passion for heavy metal and hardcore punk, recording and touring with bands including Enabler and Earth Crisis, and forming heavy rock band The Damned Things with Trohman. Andy still uses downtime from Fall Out Boy to play with hardcore band, Sect. Fall Out Boy returned refreshed and fighting fit in 2012, releasing three chart-topping albums in a row, culminating in this year\u2019s Mania.\n\nWhile the band\u2019s sound has evolved through the years, their core DNA remains, and Fall Out Boy continue to sell out arenas around the world. We hooked up with Andy Hurley during the recent UK tour to learn more about the band\u2019s incredible journey.\n\nYou joined Fall Out Boy around 2003. What were the circumstances surrounding that?\n\n\u201cI was in hardcore bands with Pete [Wentz] for years. At the time I was going to college and playing in three bands. That\u2019s why they didn\u2019t ask me to join when they first started, but they needed someone to fill in for a tour and then they were recording some demos.\n\n\"The guy producing it, Sean O\u2019Keefe who also produced Take This To Your Grave, asked if I could play on them. I loved the music they were making. The music being written for the demos, which became Take This To Your Grave, was the best stuff I had ever been a part of.\u201d\n\nHow would you describe your drumming at the time?\n\n\u201cI think I reached my peak back then and I\u2019ve been coasting on that for 15 years! Not really. I think that\u2019s probably when I started coming into my own as a drummer, being in bands and figuring out how to play with a band. Joining Fall Out Boy was the best education for that.\u201d\n\nDid you have much recording experience before Take This To Your Grave?\n\n\u201cI\u2019d recorded with a few projects, but never anything like that. We recorded a lot of it in Madison, at Butch Vig\u2019s studio [Smart Studios]. It was the biggest studio and the biggest thing we\u2019d done. There was a microphone that Kurt Cobain used in that studio! Everything I\u2019d done [before that] was with friends, or in much smaller studios.\u201d\n\nWhat did you learn from the experience?\n\n\u201cConfidence. For a long time, even on From Under The Cork Tree and Infinity On High, I had doubts that I could play anymore. From Under The Cork Tree was the first major label record we did, so that was an even bigger thing than Take This To Your Grave. I guess Take This To Your Grave was the beginning of finding comfort - of knowing what I\u2019m doing and not over thinking it.\u201d\n\nFrom collaborating so much I\u2019m better at hearing what the core DNA rhythm is in a song\n\nBetween Take This To Your Grave and Mania, Fall Out Boy\u2019s sound has evolved. Would you say your drumming has developed in tandem with that?\n\n\u201cMaybe a little. After the hiatus there was a bigger tweak. I think it follows with being in a band with songwriters who have specific ideas. Both Joe [Trohman] and Patrick [Stump] have certain things they want accented on the drums, so every aspect of every song is a collaborative thing.\n\n\"I might have an idea for a kick pattern and it totally goes against the vocal pattern. I think the evolution is just being more subservient to what the song requires. On Mania, it\u2019s the most real drums you\u2019ll hear on songs in the modern Fall Out Boy era. On the last couple of records there\u2019s drums for the whole thing, but a lot of times they\u2019re mixed with drum loops or cut up.\u201d\n\nFrom Under The Cork Tree and Infinity On High are the band\u2019s biggest-selling albums. What do you remember about the writing and recording and did you have an inkling they were going to be hits?\n\n\u201cI think we knew that we\u2019d written some great songs and a great album, but I don\u2019t think we had any idea it would be as big as it was. I think it was just a belief that this is the best work we\u2019ve done to this point. You can rally behind that.\n\n\u201cThere was a moment in the recording of Sugar We\u2019re Goin Down where Patrick did a take of a harmony or something and there was just a look when he came into the booth where we were like, \u2018This is a hit!\u2019 He\u2019s got an amazing voice and I think that is a big reason for our success. He\u2019s just so talented. Obviously, that\u2019s all bluster and jokes in the studio; you have no idea if anyone will care.\u201d\n\nDid those two albums come together fairly easily?\n\n\u201cCork Tree... and Infinity... took work. Sugar\u2026 went through a lot of different iterations before it became the song that it was. The original verse I remember I hated. The idea for what the verse became happened last minute, right before recording. That saved it for me.\n\n\"There was a lot of stuff that we had to hash out in the rehearsal space for both albums. I don\u2019t really hear the songs until I\u2019m in the studio now. It\u2019s become much more on the fly, which I really love. I think different ideas come to me more than if I had the time to do what I\u2019d normally feel like doing. It\u2019s more instinctive.\u201d\n\nThe drum parts are a key element of Fall Out Boy\u2019s sound. How much input comes from the other guys?\n\n\u201cPatrick is a drummer and so he\u2019s big on specific rhythms and patterns. And Joe, with The Damned Things stuff - there were a lot of specific things he wanted. Other bands I\u2019ve played in recently have had people who were either drummers or really adept at writing drum parts in their demoing.\n\n\"I really like when there\u2019s a specific thing that someone wants to hear. I think that from collaborating so much I\u2019m better at hearing what the core DNA rhythm is in a song to begin with.\u201d\n\nDo you remember a point at which things were getting noticeably bigger for Fall Out Boy?\n\n\u201cI guess it was the Warped Tour in 2005, the year From Under The Cork Tree came out. That was us and My Chem. It was the year where it was getting pretty crazy. Even the year before, we had a show on some really small stage, I think it was in Detroit, and the crowd was too big and they knocked the fence down.\n\n\"There were a few shows like that here and there, but that year of Warped Tour was where every show felt like that.\u201d\n\nThen things went stratospheric! You seem a fairly private guy. How comfortable did you feel with the limelight?\n\n\u201cIt was something you get used to. I definitely don\u2019t like photoshoots, but I\u2019m pretty comfortable with it now. For stuff like [drum magazines] it\u2019s just me, but with the full band it\u2019s a little easier because I can be the fourth person in the group and don\u2019t necessarily have to carry it. That\u2019s usually Pete. He\u2019s really photogenic and good at that stuff.\u201d\n\nThe size of gigs changed dramatically too...\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing Sect shows during any off-time from Fall Out Boy. The weekend before we came out here I was in the midwest for three shows. We played a VFW [Veterans of Foreigh Wars] hall, a basement and a small club.\n\n\"To be honest, that actually makes me more nervous than playing an arena. I\u2019m used to [big shows]. I can\u2019t focus on any one person. A basement show, where there\u2019s going to be at most 50 people, I can see everyone and any mistakes are bigger because I\u2019m right in front of them.\n\n\"I\u2019m more comfortable because I feel more plugged into something at a smaller show, but I also feel like I have to play better. Actually, I don\u2019t have to worry about a lot of stuff at a show this size, whereas I worry a lot about the Sect shows because I have to make sure I have a kit, bring a snare and cymbals. I\u2019ll confess, I\u2019ve forgotten sticks once before! That\u2019s all coming from a situation where I don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d\n\nWhich drum parts would you say define your playing in Fall Out Boy?\n\n\u201cTake This To Your Grave is the one where I was trying to emulate Travis Barker and guys like that the most. I was playing more beats that go around the kit.\n\n\"I think there\u2019s stuff on Mania in terms of fills or just a stripped-down beat that I\u2019m most proud of. Last year my big inspiration in terms of drumming was Danzig\u2019s Chuck Biscuits. I think he\u2019s just one of the best drummers because he\u2019s so hard hitting. He\u2019s playing exactly what\u2019s needed.\n\n\"His fills, while simple, are better than a fill I would choose to do. I was a Dave Lombardo-influenced drummer growing up, so I tried to call Chuck\u2019s spirit into my playing more on Mania.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve played on plenty of hardcore and metal albums too. What do you consider to be your drumming highlights outside of Fall Out Boy?\n\n\u201cI think the Enabler record has a lot of stuff I\u2019m really proud of. Sect is probably the highlight of my musical career. The last record we did, which came out last year, is called No Cure For Death. Stylistically, what\u2019s being played is really fun, it\u2019s fast and fill-y and double bass-y and blast beat-y. But it\u2019s also about the people in it.\n\n\"There\u2019s a guy from Earth Crisis, who were one of my favourite bands growing up. The singer was in Cursed, which is my favourite hardcore band. They\u2019re also a vegan straight-edge band, which is important to me.\u201d\n\nFall Out Boy took a break between 2010 and 2012, during which time you stayed busy with a number of different music projects. Was it important to do things that were completely removed from FoB?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the impetus was that it needed be different, I think it was just about doing stuff. The hiatus was really difficult because you become so institutionalised to having a schedule laid out for a year and a half to two years. When you don\u2019t have anything, at that time it was really difficult for me. It was depressing.\n\n\"You spend all this time on tour being like, \u2018I just wish I was home and had nothing to do.\u2019 Then you have nothing to do for two weeks and you\u2019re like, \u2018I have no idea what to do with my life.\u2019\n\n\u201cA lot of cool opportunities came. That\u2019s where I met Earth Crisis through a mutual friend who was managing them and I filled in on a tour. Then I did the Enabler record and some tours with that. The Damned Things was the big one. That was awesome. I think that more just speaks to the fact that heavy metal and hardcore is the kind of music I grew up with.\u201d\n\nDid you take time to work on your playing during that period?\n\n\u201cNo. I met Tomas Haake from Meshuggah and asked him what he does to warm up or practise at home. He said, \u2018Nothing\u2019. When he\u2019s off he goes fishing. He doesn\u2019t touch drums. That\u2019s the case for me.\n\n\"On the hiatus I was playing a lot more with friends\u2019 bands and staying busy with that. Tomas said that he got to a place where he could play what he wants to play and then coasted, I guess.\n\n\"I can play all the kinds of music I want to play and that\u2019s what I love about music. I\u2019ve never been a dude who\u2019s practising every day to play crazier stuff.\n\n\u201cMy drum tech, Brandon, plays in this band Misery Signals. He\u2019s the best drummer I know. He\u2019s so technically proficient. He practises every day for two hours. He\u2019s always pushing himself to be better. I\u2019ve just never had that drive. But that\u2019s not to say that when there\u2019s something I want to play in a band and I\u2019m not able to nail it I won\u2019t practise and really work on things.\u201d\n\nDid you return to Fall Out Boy with renewed vigour?\n\n\u201cTotally. We couldn\u2019t come back putting out the same records and we wouldn\u2019t want to. That challenge to evolve with the times is fun and it keeps things interesting. I definitely think the break cleared my palette so I could plug in to the new form that Fall Out Boy existed in easier than if I wasn\u2019t doing these projects that let me loose.\n\n\u201cOn the Sect and Enabler records I\u2019d do takes of just fills - just filling through a whole song and figuring out what works best. It\u2019s interesting because coming back from hiatus, that\u2019s what I did for Fall Out Boy. I\u2019d do takes of just the beat that\u2019s going to be mixed with a loop or whatever and then we\u2019d do takes of fills, just to see if something comes out of it.\u201d\n\nA lot of bands that came up at the same time as Fall Out Boy are no longer about. You guys are still releasing Number 1 albums and selling out big venues. What do you think it is that keeps people coming back for more?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really thankful for the opportunity and the fact that people still care. I don\u2019t really fully understand why. We try to evolve and push our boundaries, because we want to and because it\u2019s a challenge to us to do something different every time while maintaining the DNA that makes us who we are. Maybe that\u2019s something that speaks to people, the fact that we\u2019re still inspired to make music that we love.\u201d\n\nIf you hadn\u2019t joined Fall Out Boy, what would you be doing today?\n\n\u201cI just watched an interview with [Star Wars actor] John Boyega on Desus and Mero\u2019s podcast. It\u2019s called Bodega Boys. They just talk about pop culture stuff. They asked John Boyega what he\u2019d be doing if he wasn\u2019t acting and he said, \u2018This is what I\u2019d be doing\u2019. This was his one option, there was no plan B. I feel the same way. If I\u2019m not doing this I\u2019ll be dead. If I wasn\u2019t in this band I\u2019d be in another band, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/fall-out-boy-reunion-new-album-hiatus-side-project-1537911/#!", "page_content": "When Fall Out Boy went on hiatus in the fall of 2009, there were rumors, misquotes and a lot of confusion as to what the band\u2019s break actually meant. Were they gone forever? For a specified amount of time? Or were the four members \u2014 Pete Wentz, Patrick Stump, Andy Hurley and Joe Trohman \u2014 just taking a minute to breathe after releasing their fifth studio album \u201cFolie a Deux\u201d in 2008 and greatest hits album \u201cBelievers Never Die\u201d in 2009?\n\nExplore Explore See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news\n\nThe official word from bassist Wentz was that the group was not breaking up and not on \u201cindefinite hiatus,\u201d words which vocalist Stump later used in 2011 to finally stamp out rumors about the band.\n\nSince the break began in November 2009 \u2014 a few days after \u201cBelievers Never Die\u201d dropped and just weeks after the band wrapped a tour opening for the newly-reunited Blink-182, each member of Fall Out Boy has branched out on his own, releasing solo albums, forming rock supergroups, dabbling in other genres and writing books.\n\nNow that the quartet has finally reunited, take a look at what Pete, Patrick, Andy and Joe were doing for the past three and a half years, then see how the reunion unfolded as the band got back together to \u201cSave Rock and Roll\u201d on May 7:\n\nPete Wentz\n\nWentz wasted no time jumping into a new project after Fall Out Boy went on hiatus, forming electronic duo Black Cards with vocalist Bebe Rexha in July 2010. The group\u2019s \u201cDr. Jekyll & Mr. Jive\u201d reached No. 29 on the Dance/Club Play Songs chart in 2011 before album delays occurred, Rexha left the band, and Black Cards added Spencer Peterson to release the \u201cUse Your Disillusion\u201d EP in July 2012.\n\nThe Fall Out Boy bassist and ex-wife Ashlee Simpson also divorced during the band\u2019s break, and recently he has been working on \u201cGray,\u201d a new book reflecting on his own rise to fame. The novel, co-written by MTV News editor James Montgomery, is set to be released Feb. 19.\n\n\u201cWe missed you,\u201d Wentz wrote on Twitter, announcing Fall Out Boy\u2019s reunion with a link to the band\u2019s first new single, \u201cMy Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)\u201d on Feb. 4.\n\nPatrick Stump\n\nStump was the only member of the quartet to take on a solo project while Fall Out Boy was on hiatus. His 2011 \u201cSoul Punk\u201d album, which he preceded with the \u201cTruant Wave\u201d EP, spent one week on the Billboard 200 at No. 47, selling 23,000 copies to date according to Nielsen SoundScan.\n\nAs a solo artist, the Fall Out Boy vocalist opened for Bruno Mars, Janelle Monae and Panic! at the Disco, collaborated with Lupe Fiasco, and contributed to All Time Low\u2019s 2012 \u201cDon\u2019t Panic\u201d album. He also married his longtime girlfriend in September 2012.\n\nAfter denying reunion rumors in October, tweeting \u201cOne of these days there may actually be news and you won\u2019t be able to hear it over all the rumors,\u201d Stump confirmed the reunion on his own Twitter account with a link to Fall Out Boy\u2019s official announcement.\n\nAndy Hurley\n\nBack in 2009, Hurley was the first to worry fans with the group\u2019s break, tweeting that they were on \u201chiatus,\u201d before later deleting and re-wording the message.\n\nThe Fall Out Boy drummer ventured further into rock after Fall Out Boy went on a break, drumming with multiple bands over the three-year period. He kept up his record label, F-ck City, and drummed for bands like Burning Empires and Enabler. He also formed heavy metal outfit The Damned Things with Fall Out Boy guitarist Joe Trohman, Scott Ian and Rob Caggiano of Anthrax, and Keith Buckley of Every Time I Die.\n\nJoe Trohman\n\nGuitarist Trohman continued to perform in other rock bands after Fall Out Boy separated, forming The Damned Things with Hurley. The group\u2019s 2010 \u201cIroniclast\u201d album reached No. 1 on Heatseekers Albums and No. 32 on Rock Albums with 31,000 copies sold to date according to Nielsen SoundScan.\n\nThe Damned Things is currently on hiatus \u2014 the Anthrax and Every Time I Die members are busy with their other projects \u2014 so Trohman has been working with rock trio With Knives, who released a six-song EP in 2012.\n\nFall Out Boy\u2019s Reunion: A Timeline\n\nOctober 2012: A friend of the band tweeted that Fall Out Boy was in the process of making new music. The tweet went viral within alternative music circuits, and each member of the band was quick to deny any chance of a reunion.\n\nJanuary 2013: The noise died down for a few months, until January, when blogs started posting that Fall Out Boy was back and an announcement was coming soon.\n\nFebruary 2013: During the first week of February, DirectTV listings revealed that Fall Out Boy was scheduled to be a guest on Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s talk show on Feb. 13. All four band members were still staying silent or denying the rumors, keeping their secret until the official announcement hit the web.\n\nThe group tweeted out a new photo taken on the morning of Feb. 4 \u2014 showing Pete, Patrick, Joe and Andy throwing old Fall Out Boy records on a bonfire in Chicago. The quartet also released a new single, \u201cMy Songs Know What You Did In The Dark (Light Em Up),\u201d announced an upcoming tour, and revealed the title of Fall Out Boy\u2019s first album in more than four years, \u201cSave Rock and Roll.\u201d Read the full story here.\n\nWhile the Kimmel performance is still just a rumor, it has been announced that the band will perform at this summer\u2019s Reading and Leeds Festivals in England. It has also been suspected, although not confirmed by anyone involved with the band or the event, that Fall Out Boy will perform at the Skate and Surf Festival on May 18-19 in New Jersey.\n\nThe band\u2019s \u201cSave Rock and Roll\u201d tour kicks off May 14 in Milwaukee, with dates across the U.S. through the end of June. To celebrate the reunion, Fall Out Boy will be playing intimate dates in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles this week."}, {"url": "https://www.strifemag.com/artists/fall-out-boy/fall-out-boys-andy-hurley-gives-major-album-update/", "page_content": "Fall Out Boy are gearing up for their massive United States tour which will start later this month, aswell as gearing up for the release of their 7th studio album \u201cM A N I A\u201d.\n\nThis new record will finally release on the 19th of January, after the band pushed back the release of the album a while back.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn a new interview, drummer Andy Hurley has given a massive update regarding the new record when he was interviewed by KPTV in his new coffee place.\n\n\u200b"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/175844.Fall_Out_Boy", "page_content": "Fall Out Boy\n\nBorn\n\nWebsite\n\nGenre\n\nInfluences\n\nFall Out Boy is an American Grammy-nominated rock band from Wilmette, Illinois, formed in 2001.

He never stops his virtuoso thumb-typing, even when he\u2019s rehearsing for a Letterman appearance: As the rest of the band \u2013 singer Patrick Stump, lead guitarist Joe Trohman and drummer Andy Hurley \u2013 fools around with a tricky riff from Steely Dan\u2019s \u201cReeling in the Years\u201d on the Ed Sullivan Theater\u2019s fabled stage, Wentz ignores the black-and-red bass guitar hanging at his tiny waist and texts away instead.\n\nBut at the moment, as our cab cruises past Manhattan\u2019s Union Square around midnight on an arctic Sunday in early February, Wentz is simply using the Sidekick as a phone. And he is pissed. \u201cNo, this is Pete,\u201d he yells into it. \u201cYou called me. And before you said you were going back to your apartment! Where are you? Who the fuck are you with?\u201d With his cushioned lips curling in anger over gleaming teeth, and his glossy black hair rising from his head in exclamation-point spikes, he looks like an anime version of Elvis Presley.\n\nTwenty-four hours from now, Fall Out Boy will release their second major-label album, Infinity on High, the follow-up to one of the decade\u2019s biggest rock hits. With its two impeccable pop-punk singles, \u201cSugar, We\u2019re Goin Down\u201d and \u201cDance, Dance,\u201d 2005\u2019s From Under the Cork Tree pushed the geeky, suburban foursome from Warped Tour stages to what\u2019s left of the MTV mainstream, selling more than 2.5 million copies to kids unaccustomed to paying for music. And with Infinity \u2013 which moves into one glossy anthem after another \u2013 the band is targeting superstardom. \u201cI want to be the biggest band on the planet,\u201d says Wentz, whose overstuffed lyrics pair a maturing verbal gift with an adolescent penchant for self-mythologizing \u2013 he hails his \u201ccar-crash heart\u201d on Infinity\u2019s opening track.\n\nVideo: Fall Out Boy at the VMAs\n\nEditor\u2019s picks\n\nStump, whose voice is as pretty as Pete\u2019s bone structure, writes the high-glucose melodies. But Wentz is the de facto frontman, a MySpace hero to a legion of eyeliner-hoarding emo kids. Wentz, who has a Michael Jackson-like penchant for comparing himself to Peter Pan, is a new, more accessible breed of rock star, keeping in close contact with an Internet tribe of lost boys. (And girls. Lots of girls.) On his band\u2019s Web site, he regularly answers their questions: \u201cPete! My dog died yesterday of cancer. Has this ever happened to you?\u201d\n\nWentz is twenty-seven years old, but until last year he lived in his parents\u2019 house in the upscale Chicago suburb of Wilmette. When not touring, he slept in his childhood bedroom, surrounded by his old Transformers and He-Man toys. While the rest of the band maintains homes in and around Chicago \u2013 where they all have roots in the local hardcore scene \u2013 Wentz finally moved out six months ago, heading to Los Angeles. Stump has a place out there, too, but it\u2019s Wentz who hangs with Teen Vogue cover-girl types: Lindsay Lohan, Ashlee Simpson, Michelle Trachtenberg. \u201cI\u2019m attracted to creative people and train wrecks, and there\u2019s no shortage of that in Los Angeles,\u201d Wentz says. He hints at some sort of fling with Trachtenberg, but insists the other two relationships are platonic. \u201cMaybe in a different universe, we\u2019d be some hot couple, but not in this one,\u201d he says of Simpson. (Wentz may have his universes confused: At a Grammy party, he was filmed walking hand in hand with Simpson.)\n\nBack in the cab, Wentz ends his call and retreats into the hood of his sweat shirt. Before the phone buzzed, he had been in an ebullient mood, recounting an encounter at an ultra-exclusive karaoke night at Cipriani\u2019s in SoHo, which we had just left, and which was packed with models at the start of New York\u2019s Fashion Week. \u201cThis weird blond chick rolls up on me and goes, \u2018Great to see you again,\u2019 \u201d Wentz recalls, laughing. \u201cI was like, \u201cWho are you?\u2019 That\u2019s all I need in my life, some model.\u201d\n\nFall Out Boy Uncensored: The Exclusive Video\n\nWentz has an excuse for hanging out with fashionistas: Biting hip-hop\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit, he has two profitable side hustles. His clothing line, Clandestine Industries, has just signed a production and distribution deal with DKNY. His record label, Decaydance, has FOB-influenced teen faves Panic! at the Disco on its roster. So even as that band threatens to match FOB\u2019s popularity, it\u2019s also making Wentz richer: It\u2019s as if Pearl Jam had owned stock in Stone Temple Pilots.\n\nSee Also\n\nAs the taxi speeds uptown, Wentz is silent, lost in bleak thoughts. When he unleashes one of his broad, dimpled smiles, the force of his alpha-male charisma is almost blinding \u2013 but his sudden shifts into black moods are just as intense. \u201cI fully admit that I have a manic personality. I\u2019m either on or I\u2019m off,\u201d says Wentz, who has spoken at length about a 2005 near-suicide attempt. \u201cI have the ability to make a room go cold.\u201d\n\nDirector Alan Ferguson \u2013 who worked on Fall Out Boy\u2019s last few videos, including the self-mocking clip for Infinity\u2019s first single, \u201cThis Ain\u2019t a Scene, It\u2019s an Arms Race\u201d \u2013 has seen Wentz\u2019s volatility up close. \u201cPete is the nicest, most loyal, most giving dude in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd he\u2019s also got a dark side that really makes him charismatic.\u201d For the final Cork Tree video, the mini-horror movie \u201cA Little Less Sixteen Candles, A Little More \u2018Touch Me,\u2019 \u201d Ferguson created a vampire character for Wentz based on his black moods. In the opening scene, Vampire Wentz jumps off a cliff to get away from the rest of the band.\n\nAs the cookie monster-barking vocalist of the metalcore band Arma Angelus, Wentz was already a Chicago hardcore-scene celebrity in 2001, when Fall Out Boy began to take shape. \u201cWe\u2019re all kind of extreme versions of what we were,\u201d says drummer Andy Hurley, an introverted comic-book fan who played with Wentz in both Arma and a band called Racetraitor (the name was intended as an anti-racist statement, for the record). \u201cPete may go to hot-spot clubs now, but he was hanging out with A-list hardcore dudes back then. He was obviously the dude you want to know, such a magnetic personality.\u201d\n\nFuture FOB guitarist Joe Trohman toured on bass with Arma one summer when he was just sixteen, after Wentz used his considerable powers of persuasion on Trohman\u2019s mom and cardiologist dad. \u201cI definitely got initiated on that tour \u2013 they would rip my underwear off me every day,\u201d Trohman says. \u201cI hated it, dude. I should have stopped wearing underwear.\u201d\n\nAfter that tour, just as Trohman started talking with Wentz about forming a new, poppier, more Green Day-like band, he met a long-sideburned kid his age at a Borders bookstore: Patrick Stump, who was then drumming in a proggy band that sounded like Rush playing emo. Stump wanted to sing and write songs, and Trohman introduced him to Wentz. \u201cI had heard all these legends about Pete Wentz,\u201d says Stump. \u201cThat he was in six bands at once, that he was the world\u2019s greatest Casanova. But when we met, Pete and I looked at each other and went, Who the fuck is this guy? We sucked at first. We were horrible.\u201d They got their name \u2013 a reference to a comic book that Bart reads in The Simpsons \u2013 at random: They asked the crowd at an early gig for suggestions and someone shouted it out. They recorded an entire indie album before they finally got Hurley \u2013 a precision-tooled drummer influenced by Slayer\u2018s Dave Lombardo \u2013 to join the band. \u201cI don\u2019t consider it Fall Out Boy until Andy joined,\u201d says Stump.\n\nOn the first track of the band\u2019s now-disavowed, pre-Hurley debut, 2003\u2019s mostly dreadful Fall Out Boy\u2019s Evening Out With Your Girlfriend, Stump sings, \u201cI got an honorable mention in the movie of my life \u2013 starring you, instead of me.\u201d The singer, who\u2019s sitting at a glass desk in his room in Times Square\u2019s W Hotel, his friendly features cast in shadow by his ever-present baseball cap, nods and half-smiles when I bring up those lines. He wrote them himself, before Wentz took over lyric duty. \u201cI know exactly where you\u2019re going with this \u2013 the whole Pete thing,\u201d he says, glancing out the forty-eighth-floor window. \u201cBut those lines were about how I felt in high school. It didn\u2019t actually refer to Pete, as ironic as it is now.\u201d\n\nFerguson sees the bespectacled Stump as a skilled character actor to Wentz\u2019s leading man. \u201cHe\u2019s my Philip Seymour Hoffman,\u201d he says. Adds Kenneth \u201cBabyface\u201d Edmonds, the unlikely guest producer whom the band recruited to work on two Infinity tracks: \u201cPatrick is one of the baddest dudes I\u2019ve seen in a long time . . . He has a great voice \u2013 very soulful.\u201d But Stump is self-deprecating to the point where you find yourself reassuring him of his charm. \u201cI hear all sorts of things slung at us,\u201d he says, \u201cone of my favorites being the boy-band accusation. I\u2019m like, \u2018Boy band? I\u2019m fat! If we were a boy band, I\u2019d look good, I\u2019d dance and I\u2019d be charming \u2013 so what the fuck are you talking about?\u2019 I write songs, that\u2019s all I do.\u201d\n\nUntil recently, Stump \u2013 who rarely speaks onstage during Fall Out Boy\u2019s infamously sloppy live shows and hardly moves from his microphone stand as Wentz and Trohman bounce around him \u2013 was lost in Wentz\u2019s shadow. But lately, he\u2019s been coming into his own, even producing songs for the Decay-dance alt-hip-hop act Gym Class Heroes \u2013 he sings the Supertramp-derived hook on that act\u2019s \u201cCupid\u2019s Chokehold,\u201d which sits alongside \u201cArms Race\u201d in iTunes\u2019 Top Ten.\n\nOn the hotel-room desk in front of him is a silver laptop armed with Apple\u2019s Garage-Band software, which he uses to record Fall Out Boy demos, hip-hop beats and random experiments. He plays a bunch for me; many of them are startlingly close to the finished songs, and some of the beats sound Hot 97-ready. Two of the funkiest songs on Infinity on High \u2013 \u201cArms Race\u201d and the album closer, \u201cI\u2019ve Got All This Ringing in My Ears and None on My Fingers\u201d \u2013 were originally intended to be hip-hop tracks.\n\nThe day before, Stump met with Jay-Z to play him beats and discuss production projects \u2013 and last year, Jay invited Stump into the studio to write a hook for a Kingdom Come track. \u201cAll of hip-hop showed up \u2013 Jay walks in with Timbaland, then Swizz Beatz walks in. Beyonc\u00e9 was there, doing that dance you see on TV,\u201d says Stump, who was intimidated \u2013 the scene from the \u201cArms Race\u201d video where all the hip-hop dudes laugh at him is inspired by the incident. In real life, Stump never even got behind the microphone. \u201cI had the worst writer\u2019s block,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018I fucked up the Jay-Z thing, so I better write the best fucking Fall Out Boy record ever now.\u201d\u2018\n\nArguably, he did: On Infinity, Fall Out Boy morph beyond the boundaries of their genre to embrace rhythms and vocal inflections that show Stump\u2019s affection for Prince, Zapp and Earth, Wind & Fire. \u201cI was like, \u2018This dude\u2019s got something to prove,\u201d\u2018 says Wentz, whose working relationship with Stump has its tense moments \u2013 the otherwise mild-mannered singer punched him in the face once during an argument over lyrics. \u201cI think he was holding back before, so I just let him put the music where his mouth is \u2013 or the music where my mouth is, maybe.\u201d\n\nEdmonds \u2013 no stranger to love songs \u2013 was struck by Wentz\u2019s achingly personal lyrics, which the bassist said were written about one particular girl. Last year when we first met, Wentz told me the same thing: that many of the new songs he was writing were inspired by a doomed relationship, that the girl in question had driven him so crazy that he\u2019d put his hand through a car window, that he was done with her forever.\n\nIt looks just like a scene from a Fall Out Boy video: Pete Wentz and a striking young woman with a septum piercing and an aloof air stare soulfully at each other as they sit side by side. They look alike, their eyes enshrouded in the same amount of makeup. Wentz occasionally takes her hand, but says nothing. They\u2019re at a Fall Out Boy photo shoot, and the girl looks camera-ready too: Her hair is a punky shade of red, arranged in spikes. She\u2019s wearing knee-high leather boots over strategically torn stockings. Her name is Jeanae. She\u2019s just shy of twenty, a hair-dresser from Chicago. \u201cThis is way more boring than I expected,\u201d she says as flash-bulbs go off. Wentz keeps sending wounded little looks her way \u2013 and seems unnerved when he sees me talking to her.\n\nWentz appears distracted as the shoot continues at a warehouse in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, hardly speaking to his bandmates. He does brighten when Stump mentions an obscure Star Wars spinoff: two live-action Ewok TV movies from the mid-Eighties. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to see the second one \u2013 it\u2019s awesome,\u201d he says. Meanwhile, Hurley pauses from a vegan lunch and logs on to MTV\u2019s Web site to see the TRL position of the \u201cArms Race\u201d video. The site promptly crashes his browser, and he goes back to his food.\n\nEventually, everyone piles into a van, headed back into Manhattan. Wentz and Jeanae sit in the last row. The conversation turns to Morrissey, Prince and then Young Jeezy\u2019s new album: Stump hates the rapper\u2019s trademark \u201cha-ha!\u201d laugh, while Trohman \u2013 the only member of the band who drinks and smokes pot \u2013 is a fan. \u201cWe should bring him on tour,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s my dream to smoke weed with that guy.\u201d\n\nWentz and Jeanae seem to be ignoring this discussion. Wentz has the hood of his sweat shirt up, and they\u2019re whispering. Two days later, Wentz will tell me about her, how he can\u2019t let her go, how she\u2019s crazy, how she\u2019s the only girl he really wants. But I\u2019m already starting to get the idea.\n\nPhotos: Fall Out Boy\n\n\n\nTrohman and Hurley get less attention than their bandmates, which can be a source of frustration. \u201cWe mean a lot to each other as musicians and as people,\u201d says Trohman. \u201cBut sometimes we start believing what people write about us: That the band is just one guy or two guys. That can be harsh for the soul.\u201d Trohman\u2019s playing combines heavy-metal riffage with Johnny Marr-inspired atmospherics \u2013 along with high-jumping, headbanging onstage showmanship so intense that he\u2019s given himself shinsplints. \u201cJoe wants to put on a good show,\u201d says Stump. \u201cThere\u2019s a dichotomy there: He wants to be the guitar player where people stand back and say, \u2018Wow, he\u2019s good,\u2019 but at the same time, he can\u2019t help but go ape shit onstage.\u201d Trohman also has a segment of the Fall Out Boy fan base all to himself. \u201cMiddle-aged women love me \u2013 they say I look like Dr. McSexy or whatever his name is,\u201d says the guitarist.\n\nWe\u2019re cabbing over to Rudy\u2019s Music Stop on Forty-eighth Street, where Trohman spots a Fifties Les Paul Junior and inquires about the cost. \u201cEighteen-five \u2013 it\u2019s a good price,\u201d drawls a salesperson.\n\n\u201cDude,\u201d Trohman whispers, \u201cdoes that mean $18,000? That\u2019s a lot of money. Even for me.\u201d We walk out, but then Trohman heads back in to play a gorgeous 1972 black Telecaster. A different salesperson takes him into a back room. \u201cWhat guitar are you playing at home now?\u201d he asks. \u201cI\u2019ve got a whole bunch,\u201d Trohman replies, cranking Metallica riffs through an amplifier. The clerk takes a blind stab: \u201cYou guys in a band or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is,\u201d I say, pointing to Trohman, who\u2019s wearing a Dior hooded sweater over an old Pantera T-shirt.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah? Which band?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called Fall Out Boy,\u201d Trohman says and kicks into the chords of \u201cBack in Black.\u201d The salesman\u2019s eyes light up with dollar signs, and Trohman walks out five minutes later, lugging his new $4,495 impulse purchase in its battered original case. \u2018I\u2019m gonna feel guilty about this for a while,\u2019 he says, looking not at all guilty. \u201cIt\u2019s the Jew in me \u2013 like, \u2018Oh, no, you spent money!\u201d\u2018\n\nAndy Hurley is eating macaroni with vegan cheese and talking about the end of the world. We\u2019re in a cozy East Village vegetarian restaurant, fresh from shopping for comic books at Forbidden Planet. More than anyone in the band, Hurley has stayed closest to his left-wing hardcore roots: Besides his vegan diet, he\u2019s so serious about being straight-edge that he pulls his shirt collar up over his mouth and nose when Trohman smokes pot.\n\nHurley\u2019s father died when he was just five, and he was raised by his mom, a nurse. He was inspired to start drumming by Metallica\u2019s Lars Ulrich: The first albums he bought were Ride the Lightning and Van Halen. \u201cAndy is a musician, he\u2019s the instrumentalist of the band,\u201d says Stump, who as a drummer himself is a tough critic.\n\nHurley \u2013 who lives in Germantown, Wisconsin, about an hour and a half from Chicago \u2013 has some radical political views, part anarchist, part environmentalist. \u201cMy whole thing is I\u2019m not into civilization as a whole,\u201d says Hurley, who\u2019s wearing a Starter-style jacket with the Public Enemy logo on the back. \u201cThe only actual solution is the eventual collapse and demise of civilization . . . I think it needs to happen, but no one, not even me, really wants it to happen.\u201d It\u2019s not that hard for him to reconcile all this with his band\u2019s success. \u201cUltimately I am an employee of a corporation, and that\u2019s weird, and does contradict some of the things I believe in,\u201d he says. \u201cBut at the same time, I have to make a living.\u201d\n\nSo will there be rock bands after the collapse of civilization? \u201cProbably not. Music would probably go. A lot of art would,\u201d he says, looking sad for a moment. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying \u2013 I\u2019m really into comics and movies and video games, and I don\u2019t want to give that stuff up. At the same time I think it\u2019s filling the void for stuff that we\u2019re missing.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Saturday night in Atlantic City, where civilization\u2019s long collapse is clearly under way: Beefed-up dudes in starched, untucked Oxfords are cheering unironically for \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d at a basement club in the Borgata hotel and casino, where Pete Wentz has a DJ gig. Spinning records (or, rather, CDs or MP3s) is a sometime hobby for Wentz, who has previously DJ\u2019d at events such as the New York hipster party MisShapes \u2013 and tonight\u2019s set is a chance to pick up some easy cash and get a comped trip for a posse of friends. Afterward, Wentz wanders through the mazelike casino. \u201cI don\u2019t gamble,\u201d he says, glancing at aisles of frantically buzzing slot machines. \u201cI mean, not with money \u2013 I gamble with my band.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s 3:30 in the morning, and we head up to his hotel room to start an interview. Wentz turns on the TV, which happens to be tuned to a series of alarmist Fox News reports on teens gone wild. He takes off his graffiti-covered white Converse sneakers and sprawls out on one of the beds. I kick off my shoes and hop onto the other one. Wentz \u2013 a chronic insomniac since age ten \u2013 talks with dazed, sleepy honesty.\n\nFirst, he discusses how it felt to have his unit go, um, viral. Last March, some nude self-portraits Wentz had taken spread across the Web. He\u2019s pained by accusations that he deliberately leaked the pics \u2013 and is pretty sure that someone hacked into the backup Web site for his Sidekick. He was driving in Chicago when he heard the news, and he became so distracted that he ran into the car ahead of him. \u201cI thought it was the end of the world,\u201d he says. But he now laughs off the incident. Mostly. \u201cI had dreams that it didn\u2019t happen, that it was all a joke, and then you wake up and have that sick feeling in your stomach, because it did.\u201d\n\nWentz, the child of a law-school professor dad and a private-school admissions-dean mom, had always presented his childhood as idyllic and uneventful. When pressed, he touches on a couple of traumatic events. The first is relatively trivial: \u201cMy parents separated on my birthday when I was, like, six, and got back together about six or eight months later. That made me hate my birthday. I mean, Patrick\u2019s parents are divorced, and Andy\u2019s dad has passed away, so I don\u2019t really think of myself in terms of really having a fucked-up childhood \u2013 everyone I know had a more fucked-up one.\u201d\n\nWentz, who\u2019s wearing a brown-and-black vintage hoodie and untapered, regular-guy Diesel jeans, nervously slides the battery cover of the TV remote control and moves on to a later trauma: \u201cWhen I was fourteen, I got sent to boot camp,\u201d he says, gazing at the ceiling. He had been skipping school regularly in his freshman year, and a guidance counselor persuaded his parents to send him to a tough-love, scared-straight sleep-away program. For eight long weeks. \u201cIt was terrible,\u201d Wentz says softly. \u201cEvery kid there was so much more fucked up than me \u2013 demented, satanic kids. I got beat up a couple of times. I\u2019d call my parents every day, crying and saying I wanted to come home. I would beg. I felt isolated. It created these dependency and attachment issues.\u201d\n\nAnd then you ended up living at home . . . Wentz nods. \u201cUntil age twenty-seven. Yeah. Even now I need maternal people in my life more than anything,\u201d he says. He traces many of his emotional problems \u2013 and his artistic drive \u2013 back to the boot-camp experience. \u201cThat was the point I stopped talking to anybody. I really haven\u2019t since then. I don\u2019t talk to people about my emotions \u2013 it\u2019s not pleasant to be in a relationship with someone who\u2019s robotic like that. And if I don\u2019t get the emotions out somehow, whether it\u2019s punching things or writing, I would probably explode.\u201d\n\nThe reason Wentz finally moved out of his parents\u2019 house was to get away from Jeanae, his sulky teenage muse. \u201cThere was bad stuff between us, bad blood,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the few people who can actually get to me. One day I was just like. \u2018I\u2019m leaving,\u2019 and I took a plane.\u201d But now you\u2019re back together? \u201cShe\u2019s irresistible, I guess. The best ones are crazy, for sure . . . There are parts of me that are like, \u2018Yeah, we could get married,\u2019 but there are parts of me that couldn\u2019t spend tonight with her.\u201d\n\nWentz, who has never had trouble attracting female attention, seems enthralled by Jeanae\u2019s relative indifference \u2013 she\u2019s even unimpressed by the songs he writes about her. \u201cI don\u2019t know that she cares about the songs as much as everybody else who listens to them does,\u201d he says. He seems half-asleep, his eyelids drifting down. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if I could write them if she cared that much. If you could ever explain yourself to somebody, why would you keep explaining again and again?\u201d He shows me half-moon scars on the knuckles of both hands \u2013 he\u2019s put each of them through windows during fights with her. \u201cYou watch Walk the Line and you don\u2019t feel so bad. Everyone\u2019s got a bit of a crazy spirit in them. I\u2019m not interested in other people. There could be a million girls and it doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d\n\nI look at the clock: It\u2019s six in the morning. I head to my own room and pass out. Wentz stays up watching TV, and gets two hours of sleep. It\u2019s not unusual for him.\n\nWe continue talking two nights later back in his Ritz-Carlton hotel room on Central Park South \u2013 which is a mess, with sweat shirts exploding all over the floor from his leather Louis Vuitton suitcase. Amid the clothes is a copy of Kafka\u2019s The Metamorphosis and Other Stories. He loves the hotel, especially since room service has been willing to bring him peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches each night.\n\nIn recent months, Wentz has dropped some of the signature looks that have become emo clich\u00e9s: He doesn\u2019t put on eye-liner much anymore, and he\u2019s moved away from tight girls\u2019 jeans. \u201cAll of a sudden you see the laughability of swished-over hair and eye makeup,\u201d he says, perched on the hotel bed. \u201cNew metal had its look, and Seattle had flannel shirts. It\u2019s stupid.\u201d\n\nWentz was a soccer jock when he started playing music. \u201cI used to get made fun of for being, like, your typical dude,\u201d he says. \u201cSo sometimes I tried to look strange. I wanted to look androgynous, weird.\u201d Wentz\u2019s five-foot-seven physique is boyish enough to fit comfortably in the girls\u2019 jeans that he\u2019s helped popularize for guys \u2013 a style choice that was also big in early-Nineties hardcore. But the look has become so popular that the emo masses are all but starving themselves to squeeze in \u2013 prompting this magazine to coin the term \u201cemorexia.\u201d And Wentz is sick of it. \u201cIt definitely got ridiculous, where we were painting on our pants, pretty much,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m over that thing.\u201d\n\nInstead, Wentz has been engaging in the least emo of all activities lately: He\u2019s been lifting weights. \u201cI\u2019ve been working out. Isn\u2019t that weird?\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m going to get buff. I want to be, like, a man now.\u201d Pete Wentz, king of the lost boys, flashes one of his killer smiles and repeats himself: \u201cI want to be a man.\u201d\n\nThis story is from the March 8th, 2007 issue of Rolling Stone."}, {"url": "https://archive.jsonline.com/entertainment/musicandnightlife/for-fall-out-boy-drummer-andy-hurley-milwaukee-has-always-been-home-b99534934z1-313529221.html/", "page_content": "Andy Hurley (second from left) with Fall Out Boy bandmates Joe Trohman (left), Pete Wentz (second from right) and Patrick Sump (right) before an appearance on the \u201cToday\u201d show in June. Credit: Stephen Lovekin\n\nBy of the\n\nIn 1991, Andy Hurley, then a sixth-grade student at Menomonee Falls North Middle School, had an assignment: Write about your future.\n\nHis first sentence: \"I think I will be in a band 25 years from now.\"\n\nHurley, 35, is indeed playing in a band for a living. Actually, he's in one of the most popular rock bands in the world, Fall Out Boy.\n\nAs the drummer, he's less well-known than frontman Patrick Stump, bassist and onetime tabloid magnet Pete Wentz, and lead guitarist Joe Trohman. But Hurley is arguably the most fascinating member of Fall Out Boy: a softspoken, easygoing, hyper-intelligent, tattoo-covered, cross-fit-obsessed, straightedge vegan who loves his friends so much, he lets them live at his home, rent-free.\n\nWhile his bandmates moved to California long ago, Hurley's home has been in Milwaukee \u2014 a nearly 6,000-square-foot, five-bedroom, million-dollar-plus home on North Lake Drive. The house, the city \u2014 they provided him with much-needed retreat at the end of every grueling tour.\n\nThe journey has had its struggles, both professionally and personally.\n\nHurley's father, a physician, died when he was 5. And when he was 9, his mother, Ann, was diagnosed with breast cancer. He thought he would lose her, too.\n\nHe didn't. Ann today lives in Franklin with her husband of two years; Andy was her man of honor at the wedding. There's a room in her home that includes a shrine to her son, from band posters to an action figure to a platinum record framed on the wall.\n\nHer son, she said, \"as a child, was angry....He was ending up with the wrong kinds of kids...I feel that music saved his life.\"\n\n'First thing I didn't give up'\n\nIn middle school, Andy Hurley started playing percussion. In a fake obituary he wrote for school, he hoped he'd be remembered for playing 1,000 drum sets, signing 100 million autographs and for his 100 world tours. He got into groups like Nirvana and Slayer and Black Sabbath. He kept detailed logs of all the different drumsticks he used.\n\n\"Music is the first thing I didn't give up,\" Hurley said, in part because of a series of band and percussion teachers \"who pushed me further than I would have on my own.\"\n\nWhen he was 15, Hurley immersed himself in the hard-core punk scene in Milwaukee, and when that wasn't enough, he would travel to Chicago to play or hang out with similar bands. That was when he was inspired to become straightedge \u2014 meaning he wouldn't take drugs or drink alcohol \u2014 and a vegan.\n\nHe played drums in radical bands like Racetraitor and Killtheslavemaster, with Wentz as an occasional bandmate. Then, \"when we were all burned out on doing such serious political bands,\" Hurley said, Wentz and Trohman established Fall Out Boy.\n\n\"It definitely took a lot of coaxing\" to get Hurley in the band, Trohman recalled. But after the band had gone through two other drummers, he became part of Fall Out Boy just in time to record the band's debut album, \"Take This To Your Grave,\" in 2003 at Smart Studios in Madison.\n\n\"He started making the band musically very tight. He elevated our level of musicianship,\" Trohman said. \"He takes everything he does very seriously. It helps that he doesn't do drugs, he doesn't drink alcohol. His dedication to the band made everyone want to do the band more in the beginning.\"\n\nFrom touring in a rundown van to becoming famous, Hurley in many ways has been the band's rock.\n\n\"Pete and Patrick and I, we all love each other, but we've always hated each other at some point for various reasons,\" Trohman said. \"With Andy, I don't think anyone has anything disparaging to say.\"\n\nToday, Fall Out Boy is riding the success of six albums, three of which have reached the top of the Billboard charts. The band has won a host of awards, including a People's Choice for Favorite Alternative Band, although a Grammy is still on Hurley's wish list. Its most recent work, \"American Beauty/American Psycho,\" released in January of this year, sold more than 218,000 equivalent copies in the first week alone.\n\n\"I would love to keep doing it forever,\" Hurley said. \"If we did end tomorrow, I would be so stoked and proud of everything I've done and how I lived my life. I feel like I've had enough experiences for multiple lives.\"\n\nA pact with friends\n\nThat's certainly true of Matthew Mixon, a video producer and Hurley's roommate. He hasn't paid rent at Hurley's Milwaukee home since 2007.\n\nWhen Mixon and Hurley were freshmen at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, \"we were eating Thai food after class, talking about money our bands could make, dreaming big. And somebody said, 'Whoever gets big off this (expletive) has to buy a house that we can all live in and play music.\"\n\nHurley honored the pact \u2014 and more.\n\n\"He took me to the MTV Video Music Awards,\" Mixon said. \"He always picks up the check....And (his friends) have had these once-in-a-lifetime opportunities to experience all these things with him.\"\n\nIn return, Hurley's roommates take care of the house and make sure the bills are paid on time, Trohman said. \"For Andy, friends are his family.\"\n\nWhen he's off the road, Hurley spends time with his roommates \"24/7,\" Mixon said. \"We do the same stuff we did in high school. We play video games and board games all the time, and we love hanging around with each other. ... He's the same dude through and through.\"\n\nHurley appreciates the circle of local support.\n\n\"It grounds me, and has kept me out of this world that does affect people,\" Hurley said as he sipped coffee at one of his favorite places in town, Alderaan Coffee on N. Water St.\n\nThis summer, Fall Out Boy is co-headlining amphitheaters across the country with rapper Wiz Khalifa for the \"Boys of Zummer\" tour. Milwaukee isn't on the route \u2014 The Rave hosted the band just last December \u2014 but the band will be at the First Midwest Bank Amphitheatre in Tinley Park, Ill., Saturday.\n\nHurley is eager to play in Milwaukee again. \"Playing there has always been my best shows,\" he said. \"My mom is there with all of her friends. I usually have 30 to 40 people on the guest list. It's infinitely more stressful. But I rise to the stress and I play better because of it.\"\n\nHis mother is fascinated to see how he handles his status.\n\n\"He is such a good kid,\" she said. \"He is very caring and he is always interested in seeing me when he's home. He'll take us behind the scenes after the shows in Milwaukee and Chicago. So many people want to talk to him. It's just astounding to me to watch him interact with others. There isn't any of this highfalutin stuff. He just doesn't have it in him.\"\n\nFinding a new home\n\nAfter this tour is done, for the first time Hurley will not be coming back to Milwaukee. He has a brand-new residence in Portland, Ore. It's on 48 acres, with a pool and a private beach.\n\nThe winters here are rough, he said, and the frequent commute to Los Angeles has been hard.\n\n\"I'm going to be devastated when he leaves,\" his mother said. \"I know he has his own life, and he keeps saying I'm going to come back a lot and fly you out here.\"\n\nHe's already sold his Lake Drive house. But his Milwaukee friends and roommates \u2014 seven of them \u2014 will be waiting in Portland. They're all moving with him. And Hurley hopes he'll have a couple of months off toward the end of the year to hang out with them.\n\n\"Portland is only a two-hour flight from Los Angeles. It's really similar (to Milwaukee) where it's kind of this big, small place and has a really amazing community, and it's bigger in terms of veganism,\" Hurley said. \"But I've always felt like Milwaukee was a member of the family.\"\n\n\"My heart will always be here.\"\n\nMore on music\n\nFind out about the week's must-see shows, concert tickets and more in the new newsletter \"Piet Levy's Music Picks.\" Subscribe at jsonline.com/newsletters.\n\nPiet talks about concerts, local music and more on \"TAP'd In\" with Jordan Lee, 8 a.m. Thursdays on WYMS-FM (88.9).\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nWho: Fall Out Boy and Wiz Khalifa\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. Saturday\n\nWhere: First Midwest Bank Amphitheatre; 19100 South Ridgeland Ave.; Tinley Park, Ill.\n\nHow much?$20 to $62.75 at the box office and livenation.com."}, {"url": "https://www.contactmusic.com/fall-out-boy", "page_content": "Fall Out Boy (formed 2001) Fall Out Boy is an American rock band, who rose to fame with their single 'This Ain't A Scene, It's An Arms Race.\n\nFormation: In Chicago, 2001, Fall Out Boy was formed by Joe Trohman and Pete Wentz. Trohman overheard Patrick Stump talking about the band Neurosis in a bookstore and invited him to join the band. Initially, Patrick auditioned as the drummer but his vocal talents were soon discovered and he took up the role of vocalist. T. J. Racine and a man known only as 'Mike' completed the line-up, on guitar and drums, respectively.\n\nIn 2002, the band recorded a demo and in May of that year, Uprising Records released their debut EP, followed by a mini LP, Fall Out Boy's Evening Out with Your Girlfriend, in 2003. Following the record's release, Andy Hurley joined the band, whilst Racine and Mike both left. It was around this time that Stump began to play the guitar for the band.\n\nThe band's name is a reference to a character in The Simpsons. The character was the sidekick to Radioactive Man.\n\nBreakthrough: In 2003, Fall Out Boy signed a deal with the label Fueled By Ramen, who released their acoustic EP My Heart Will Always Be the B-side to My Tongue.\n\nLater that year, they also signed a deal with Island Records, who gave the band an advance payment to record Take This To Your Grave, with Sean O'Keefe at Smart Studios, owned by Butch Vig (of the band Garbage and renowned for his production work for Nirvana). Despite some songs receiving airplay, the album was only really a commercial success after the release of their next album.\n\nIn 2005, From Under the Cork Tree was released and sold over 68,000 in its first week of sale. The first single from the album, 'Sugar, We're Goin' Down', peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. The band was nominated as Best Newcomer at the 2006 MTV Awards.\n\nIn 2007, the band released Infinity on High. Their single 'This Ain't A Scene, It's An Arms Race' was the band's highest charting single on the Billboard Hot 100 as well as in the UK singles chart. The single was remixed by Kanye West and Fall Out Boy have also collaborated with Timbaland.\n\nIn April 2008, **** was released. The CD and DVD is a collection of live material recorded at Phoenix's Cricket Wireless Pavilion as well as a cover of Michael Jackson's 'Beat It', with John Mayer on guitar.\n\nIn August 2008, the band began a viral internet campaign to promote their next album, Folie \u00e0 Deux, causing widespread speculation regarding the release date of the album.\n\nBiography by Contactmusic.com"}, {"url": "https://music.mxdwn.com/2016/12/12/news/the-damned-things-featuring-andy-hurley-of-fall-out-boy-and-scott-ian-of-anthrax-have-recorded-a-new-ep/", "page_content": "Home News Matt Matasci December 12th, 2016 - 10:54 PM\n\nIt has been a while since the eclectic rock supergroup The Damned Things have been active.

Ever since he was a kid, he followed the belief that humans are supposed to live the way they used to live thousands of years ago, in their primitive state, but as he grew up, most of his beliefs faded.\n\nAndy Hurley was born Andrew John Hurley in Wisconsin on 31st May 1980 and lost his father when he was just 5. His mother took care of him for the rest of his childhood and teenage. Andy had saxophone as his very first musical instrument that he learned playing well and along with that, he also played percussion in his school\u2019s marching band.\n\nRecommended Lists:\n\nCareer\n\nAndy\u2019s introduction to professional music happened back when he was in the high school and was slowly gaining interest in playing drums. The year was 1996 and Andy was searching for opportunities to play with some big bands and in the pursuit of his dreams, he became part of several hardcore punk and heavy metal bands such as Killtheslavemaster, Racetraitor, Project Rocket and The Kill Pill. He was unable to find his true calling and kept trying different bands during this time.\n\nThe hardcore metal was getting popular in the late 90s and Andy\u2019s drumming skills got him gigs here and there but nothing concrete was coming across his way. However, things changed for the best in the year 2003, when one of his best high school friends Pete Wentz invited Andy to be a part of their band which was called the Fall Out Boy as they were in dire need of an additional drummer due to some troubles with their previous one, and it didn\u2019t take Andy much time to become a regular with Fall Out Boy.\n\nHis association with the band was extremely successful and despite the fact that this was the fourth band Andy was in, he got the fame in such a short time which he wasn\u2019t able to achieve through his previous stints in more than 5 years. Andy recorded the album \u2018Take This To Your Grave\u2019 with the band Fall Out Boy in 2003 to a mega universal success which helped Andy to become one of the hottest drummers around.\n\nIt was the first album by the band which was considered to be an actual hit and the band was reported by the media outlets to be the next big thing. The success continued with their next album titled \u2018From Under the Cork Tree\u2019, which climbed at the 9th spot in the Billboard 200 chart and the band spent the year 2005 touring around with their new found success. The album later went on to earn a Grammy nomination for the best New Artist.\n\nThe next two studio albums by the band titled \u2018Infinity on High\u2019 and \u2018Folie a Deux\u2019 also went on to achieve mega success in their concerts and digital downloads. However, Wentz faced severe emotional trouble during that time which also included a failed suicide attempt. It was being said that he is unable to handle the new found success the band was having and that, among several other things, led the band to take a break for some time in 2009.\n\nAndy got himself busy with several other projects and played for different bands such as a heavy metal band The Damned Things. The band was mostly a collaborative effort and featured members from Fall Out Boy, Anthrax and Every Time I Die and released their very first album titled \u2018Ironiclast\u2019. Enabler, another hard core band, hired Andy and in summer 2012, Enabler released their first album with Andy as a drummer titled \u2018All Hail the Void\u2019.\n\nLater in 2012, Andy joined a straight edge hard rock band named FocusedXminds, and during that time, media speculations were ripe about Fall Out Boy making a comeback and it was said that Andy will leave FocusedXminds when that happens. Fall Out Boy made a reappearance onto the musical sky in 2013, but Andy continued his association with FocusedXminds."}]}
