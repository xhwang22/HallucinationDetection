First telecast on Dick Powell's \"Zane Grey Theatre\" (CBS) on March 7, 1958, the pilot premiered on ABC in the regular television season on September 30 that same year. The show's creator, Arnold Laven, developed customized Winchester rifle, not a six gun, the main protagonist's signature firearm.\n\nThe opening credits showcasing the skill of Chuck Connors as Lucas McCain firing his rapid-action Winchester rifle set the tone for the western action adventure, to be sure, but the show aspired to be more than a vehicle for gratuitous gun-slinging. Heart-warming human relationships, specifically the kinship between father and son, provided balance, and sometimes a paradoxical juxtaposition, to the violent backdrop of life on the frontier. The rifle complemented Lucas McCain's persona as a self-possessed, rugged individualist who had high ethical standards and a cool head. Connors in the title role, with rifle at the ready, portrayed the iconic western hero \u2013 a crackerjack marksman and cowboy-turned-single-father and homesteader facing life's challenges with a stoical, reasoned view about social justice and personal responsibility. Uppermost in his mind was being a good role model for his son and a solid citizen in his community. So, when McCain picked up his rifle, he wielded it not only with confidence and competence, but also with rational deliberation and fair-minded determination. He admonished his young son in one episode, \"A man doesn't run from a fight, Mark, but that doesn't mean you go looking to run to one.\"\n\nFamily values and moral principles informed many storylines in THE RIFLEMAN series. Through the McCains' adventures with the townfolk of North Fork and the weekly influx of visitors, THE RIFLEMAN was a series of morality plays examining human nature's rich and varied complexity \u2013 with all its foibles and follies, sorrow and humor, venality and virtue. The inspiration for many episodes was drawn from Biblical parables, sometimes recapitulated explicity, such as the story of Job, which was related by Lucas to son Mark in the second episode, \"Home Ranch.\" Second chances \u2013 compassion and redemption \u2013 was a prominent, recurring theme. It was often elicited in episodes featuring Marshal Micah Torrance, played by Paul Fix, a sometime derelict, recovered alcholic, who was a regular character introduced in the fourth episode, \"The Marshal,\" after R.G. Armstrong, who played the sheriff in the pilot was killed off. The themes were timeless and universal, featuring sympathetic characters grappling with familiar human dilemmas and classic good-versus-evil conflicts.\n\nArnold Laven and series co-producers, Arthur Gardner and Jules V. Levy, presciently anticipated that the show's strength lay in the father-son relationship, and its best asset was the genuine filial affection between actors Chuck Connors as Lucas McCain and Johnny Crawford as Mark McCain. In fact, the depiction of a widowed father grappling with the challenges of raising a son alone in THE RIFLEMAN may have been a television first in its departure from the traditional depiction of a family as mother, father and child. Critics and viewers responded favorably to the novel family portrayal celebrating the father-son bond, and it appears to account for the enduring appeal of the series. In the June 20, 2004 issue of \"TV Guide,\" the character of Lucas McCain was ranked #32 in a list of the \"50 Greatest TV Dads of All Time.\" In 1959, at age 13, Johnny Crawford was nominated for an Emmy for his role in THE RIFLEMAN. Chuck Connors later remarked with admiration how young Johnny Crawford comported himself on THE RIFLEMAN set with deferential respect toward the crew, addressing them as \"sir\" and \"ma'am\" upon arriving to the set on his first day until departing on the last day."}, {"url": "https://aurorasginjoint.com/2016/04/10/the-rifleman-1958-1963/", "page_content": "I don\u2019t remember how or when I first came across \u201cThe Rifleman,\u201d but I saw plenty of repeats of the show during my childhood. I vividly remember being charmed by the unique Western with heart at its core and today I revisit it in honor of its star, Chuck Connors, who would have celebrated a birthday.\n\nAs a Western \u201cThe Rifleman\u201d features characters and situations true to the genre, as well as what one would deem a typical 1880s frontier setting as depicted in many movies and so forth. The action in the series is also along the lines of standard\n\nWestern fare \u2013 gunfights, lawlessness, etc. \u2013 all of which is entertaining. But what makes \u201cThe Rifleman\u201d a standout is the importance the show places on relationships, particularly the one between Lucas McCain aka The Rifleman and his son, Mark (Johnny Crawford).\n\nLucas McCain (Chuck Connors) is a widower struggling to raise his son amidst the backdrop of the Old West. As a homesteader, McCain lives on a small farm outside the New Mexico town of North Fork, but for all intents and purposes he serves as the town\u2019s moral center and takes every opportunity to teach his son about human nature and its complexities. As such themes of redemption, forgiveness, judgment, character, fairness, sorrow and joy are woven beautifully into each episode of \u201cThe Rifleman.\u201d\n\nLucas McCain: \u201cName callin\u2019s a handy thing for some Mark. They smack a label on somebody or something and that\u2019s it as far as they\u2019re concerned. It\u2019s kind of a special way of hating because they don\u2019t take the trouble to understand.\u201d\n\nMark McCain: \u201cWell you have to put a label on some things, like say a pickle jar!\u201d\n\nLucas McCain: \u201cThat\u2019s right! But you be mighty sure there are pickles in that jar first! You see most times snap judgment can be cruel son.\u201d\n\nLessons. Many important lessons. But that\u2019s not to say that there isn\u2019t more than enough action in \u201cThe Rifleman\u201d to keep the most ardent fan of shoot-em-ups satisfied. One needs only to see the show\u2019s opening sequence \u2013 one of the best \u2013 to recognize why McCain is given the famous moniker. Lucas McCain is an imposing figure to begin with Connor\u2019s 6 ft 5 in. frame towering over everyone else in the show making the character\u2019s physique match his strength of purpose. This is a man who walks the proud walk of the righteous. Add to all of that the souped-up rifle he carries around and you have one of the most memorable Western characters in all of television.\n\nLucas McCain: \u201cYou want to try your fast gun against my fast rifle?\u201d\n\nIf the bad guys have any brains at all the answer to that question would always be \u201cHELL, NO!\u201d But bad guys are usually too self-centered, blinded by hatred or too power hungry to think clearly so The Rifleman is given ample opportunity to show his skill. We \u2013 as in even those of us who are not gun aficionados \u2013 are always thrilled when he does. I have to admit that McCain\u2019s style \u2013 the firing the rifle from his hip, a position he gets into much faster than the (or my) eye can see \u2013 is always exciting. But again, true to the moral fiber of the man, it is a skill used only as a last resort, when absolutely necessary \u2013 another unique attribute of \u201cThe Rifleman.\u201d\n\nLucas McCain: \u201cA man doesn\u2019t run from a fight, Mark\u2026but that doesn\u2019t mean you should go running *to* one, either.\u201d\n\nThe pilot episode of \u201cThe Rifleman\u201d titled \u201cThe Sharpshooter\u201d was written by Sam Peckinpah intended as an episode of \u201cGunsmoke,\u201d but the entry never came to fruition for that program. Instead, it ended up as an installment on CBS\u2019 \u201cDick Powell\u2019s Zane Grey Theater\u201d in March 1958. In September of that same year \u201cThe Sharpshooter\u201d aired on ABC as the inaugural episode of \u201cThe Rifleman,\u201d beginning the show\u2019s five-year run on the network.\n\nAnother great thing about this series, which is actually what makes classic TV shows enjoyable in general are the top names in entertainment that were a part of its roster \u2013 either as guest stars, recurring characters and/or directors. Names like Ida Lupino, Bud Boetticher, Arthur Hiller and Sam Peckinpah helmed the show throughout its run and a host of familiar faces guest starred. The show\u2019s two main players, Connors and Johnny Crawford as Mark are exceptional. Connor\u2019s McCain is one of TV\u2019s greatest heroes and Crawford shows acting chops well beyond his years. Also enjoyable to watch is Paul Fix who plays Micah Torrance, the Marshall and McCain\u2019s best friend who depends on him consistently to help keep order in North Fork.\n\nLucas McCain: \u201cEverything must be done according to the law.\u201d\n\nThose are just a few of the reasons why \u201cThe Rifleman\u201d is likely to charm ya, ma\u2019am. So giddy up and mozy on down and\u2026OK, I\u2019m gonna stop now."}, {"url": "https://www.aveleyman.com/ActorCredit.aspx?ActorID=14199", "page_content": "Mountain Road\n\nColonel Magnusson 1960\n\nAda\n\nTom De Paul - Committee Man 1961\n\nAdvise & Consent\n\nSenator Paul Hendershot\n\n(as William Quinn) 1962\n\nBirds\n\nFarm Hand 1963\n\nIt Happened at the World's Fair\n\nMan Leaving Dispensary 1963\n\nDark Intruder\n\nNeighbor 1965\n\nPenelope\n\nBank Executive (uncredited) 1966\n\nShakiest Gun in the West\n\nU.S. Marshal Arthur Bates 1968\n\nAce Eli and Rodger of the Skies\n\nMortician 1973\n\nSatan's School for Girls\n\nGardener 1973\n\nPsychic Killer\n\nGeorge, Hospital coroner 1975\n\nBustin' Loose\n\nJudge Antonio Runzuli 1981\n\nTwilight Zone\n\nMr Leo Conroy 1983"}, {"url": "https://astreetnearyou.org/person/155526/Rifleman-William-Quinn", "page_content": "\u00d7 About this map\n\nContinue Latest update\n\nThis site was created in November 2018.

At the heart of it is the legacy of those who died in the conflict, and especially the scale of the imapct that that would have had on their local communities, it would also never have been possible without the significant legacy created by those who remained, from the families who sent in photographs of their loved ones and which formed the Imperial War Museum's founding Bond of Sacrifice Collection, through the people who diligently compiled official records in the early 1920s and which formed the Commonwealth War Graves Commission's records, right up to the modern-day professionals, volounteers and individuals who have shaped these records, shared them, and also significantly increased and enriched them, especially under the guise of First World War Centenary projects like Lives of the First World War\n\nData and Sources\n\nThis project currently contains records for over one million men and women who died whilst serving in the First World War, with over 600,000 locations worldwide, tens of thousands of images, cemeteries, war memorials and much more. It simply wouldn't exist without the core assets that it draws on, enriched by additional information from and links to countless further sources.\n\nCore data sources - personal records and images\n\nLives of the First World War - IWM's unique project enabling everyone to share their information, stories and images to compile Life Stories \"on nearly 8 million men and women who served in uniform and worked on the home front\".\n\nCommonwealth War Graves Commission - a unique online collection of the details of every serviceman or woman. Many of the locations here are extracted from what they call the 'Additional information' field, which typically contains text such as \"Son of Samuel and Sarah Morley, of Derby; husband of F. M. Morley, of 113, Peel St., Ashbourne Rd., Derby.\". Note that this information was collected sevral years after the end of the war and it does not necessarily represent an address that the person had lived at.\n\nImperial War Museums Collections - one of the richest collections of First World War objects and images, most notably in this context the Bond of Sacrifice Collection and the Women's War Work Collection, togther comprising images of nearly 20,000 individuals who served\n\nCore data sources - war memorials\n\nWar Memorial Register - another unique record set from the Imperial War Museum, comprising records of over 78,000 memorials in the British Isles, together with listings of over one million names that appear on them.\n\nPlaces of Pride, the National Register of War Memorials (Australia) - over 1,000 records from across Australia, almost all having photographs and additional information\n\nNew South Wales War Memorials Register - The register includes over 3,500 memorials in total, with over 2,000 relating to the First World War.

First telecast on Dick Powell's \"Zane Grey Theatre\" (CBS) on March 7, 1958, the pilot premiered on ABC in the regular television season on September 30 that same year. The show's creator, Arnold Laven, developed customized Winchester rifle, not a six gun, the main protagonist's signature firearm.\n\nThe opening credits showcasing the skill of Chuck Connors as Lucas McCain firing his rapid-action Winchester rifle set the tone for the western action adventure, to be sure, but the show aspired to be more than a vehicle for gratuitous gun-slinging. Heart-warming human relationships, specifically the kinship between father and son, provided balance, and sometimes a paradoxical juxtaposition, to the violent backdrop of life on the frontier. The rifle complemented Lucas McCain's persona as a self-possessed, rugged individualist who had high ethical standards and a cool head. Connors in the title role, with rifle at the ready, portrayed the iconic western hero \u2013 a crackerjack marksman and cowboy-turned-single-father and homesteader facing life's challenges with a stoical, reasoned view about social justice and personal responsibility. Uppermost in his mind was being a good role model for his son and a solid citizen in his community. So, when McCain picked up his rifle, he wielded it not only with confidence and competence, but also with rational deliberation and fair-minded determination. He admonished his young son in one episode, \"A man doesn't run from a fight, Mark, but that doesn't mean you go looking to run to one.\"\n\nFamily values and moral principles informed many storylines in THE RIFLEMAN series. Through the McCains' adventures with the townfolk of North Fork and the weekly influx of visitors, THE RIFLEMAN was a series of morality plays examining human nature's rich and varied complexity \u2013 with all its foibles and follies, sorrow and humor, venality and virtue. The inspiration for many episodes was drawn from Biblical parables, sometimes recapitulated explicity, such as the story of Job, which was related by Lucas to son Mark in the second episode, \"Home Ranch.\" Second chances \u2013 compassion and redemption \u2013 was a prominent, recurring theme. It was often elicited in episodes featuring Marshal Micah Torrance, played by Paul Fix, a sometime derelict, recovered alcholic, who was a regular character introduced in the fourth episode, \"The Marshal,\" after R.G. Armstrong, who played the sheriff in the pilot was killed off. The themes were timeless and universal, featuring sympathetic characters grappling with familiar human dilemmas and classic good-versus-evil conflicts.\n\nArnold Laven and series co-producers, Arthur Gardner and Jules V. Levy, presciently anticipated that the show's strength lay in the father-son relationship, and its best asset was the genuine filial affection between actors Chuck Connors as Lucas McCain and Johnny Crawford as Mark McCain. In fact, the depiction of a widowed father grappling with the challenges of raising a son alone in THE RIFLEMAN may have been a television first in its departure from the traditional depiction of a family as mother, father and child. Critics and viewers responded favorably to the novel family portrayal celebrating the father-son bond, and it appears to account for the enduring appeal of the series. In the June 20, 2004 issue of \"TV Guide,\" the character of Lucas McCain was ranked #32 in a list of the \"50 Greatest TV Dads of All Time.\" In 1959, at age 13, Johnny Crawford was nominated for an Emmy for his role in THE RIFLEMAN. Chuck Connors later remarked with admiration how young Johnny Crawford comported himself on THE RIFLEMAN set with deferential respect toward the crew, addressing them as \"sir\" and \"ma'am\" upon arriving to the set on his first day until departing on the last day."}, {"url": "https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/the-rifleman/cast/1030223317/", "page_content": "Join or Sign In\n\nSign in to customize your TV listings\n\nContinue with Facebook\n\nContinue with email\n\nBy joining TV Guide, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy."}, {"url": "https://www.therifleman.net/episodes?episode=108", "page_content": "The Lonesome BrideEpisode 108Writer: Arthur Browne, Jr.Director: Otto LangOriginal Air Date 05/02/1961Cast\n\nChuck Connors as Lucas McCain\n\nJohnny Crawford as Mark McCain\n\nPaul Fix as Marshal Micah Torrance\n\nLincoln Demyan as Kelly Banner\n\nLincoln Demyan, born George Lincoln Demyan, was an American film and television actor.

He and Lenny Bruce are credited with pioneering \"blue\" comedy. Their acts were built around adult humor and off-color jokes that were tame compared against later generations of comics. After a rough start with a string of unsuccessful east coast stints, Hackett went on to become so successful that he could be the headliner at any major nightclub in the US.

He guest-starred in several other westerns, sometimes making multiple appearances, including \"Gunsmoke\" (1955\u20131975), starring James Arness; \"Laramie\" (1959\u20131963), starring John Smith and Robert Fuller; and \"Wagon Train\" (1957\u20131965), starring John McIntyre and Ward Bond.\n\nKevin McCarthy as Winslow Quince\n\nKevin McCarthy was an American stage, film and television actor whose prolific career spanned more than six decades. Brother of renowned author, Mary McCarthy, he made his Broadway debut in 1938 in \"Abe Lincoln in Illinois\" and appeared in 18 theatrical productions throughout his career, notably, portraying Harry S. Truman in \"Give 'Em Hell Harry,\" which toured the United States for two decades. McCarthy appeared in over 200 film and television roles. His portrayal of Biff in the 1951 film adaptation of \"Death of a Salesman\" garnered him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and won him a Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year, Actor. His best-known role was Dr. Miles Bennell in the 1956 science fiction horror classic \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\" The iconic film was selected for the National Film Registry in 1994 and in 2008 was named one of the Top 10 science fiction films of all time by the American Film Institute. In later years, he embraced the cult camp status of the picture and his role in it, even making a cameo appearance in the 1976 remake of the \"Body Snatchers.\" McCarthy made two appearances in THE RIFLEMAN, portraying Mark Twain in \"The Shattered Idol\" (episode 120) and Winslow Quince in \"Suspicion\" (episode 157). He continued to work until the year before his death at age 96\u2014his last screen appearances were in two 2009 releases, the 18th century period film, \"Wesley,\" and the short comedy film \"I Do.\"\n\nBill Quinn as Sweeney, the Bartender\n\nBill Quinn was an American actor whose early career began in the 1920's in silent films and ended with the 1989 science fiction film, \"Star Trek V: The Final Frontier.\" Perhaps, his best-known role was Mr. Ranseleer, Archie Bunker's blind friend in \"All In The Family\" (1971-1978). He also was a regular character in the Carroll O'Connor spin-off, \"Archie Bunker's Place.\" Quinn's other television credits include roles in \"The Odd Couple\" (1970-1975), \"McHale's Navy\" (1962-1966), and \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" (1970-1977), in which he play Mary Richard's father. In 1971, he appeared in Universal Pictures' \"How to Frame a Figg\" starring Don Knotts. Quinn was a regular character in THE RIFLEMAN, appearing in 40 episodes as Sweeney, the Owner/Bartender of the North Fork Saloon.\n\nGuest Cast"}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/The_Rifleman", "page_content": "Main article: List of The Rifleman episodes\n\nThe series centers on Lucas McCain, a Union veteran of the American Civil War and widower. McCain had been a lieutenant in the 11th Indiana Infantry Regiment, and he had received a battlefield commission at the Battle of Five Forks just before the end of the war.[3] (This conflicts with episode 3/25, \"The Prisoner\", in which a former Confederate cavalry major states that he was Lieutenant McCain's prisoner after the Battle of Fort Donelson.[4]) Having previously been a homesteader, McCain buys a ranch outside the fictitious town of North Fork, New Mexico Territory, in the pilot episode. His son Mark and he had come from Enid, Oklahoma, following the death of his wife, Margaret (n\u00e9e Gibbs), when his son was six years old.[citation needed] The citizens of North Fork are sometimes willing to subject themselves to tyranny, showing themselves to be cowards in several episodes.\n\nThe series was set during the 1880s; a wooden plaque next to the McCain home states that the home was rebuilt by Lucas McCain and his son Mark in August 1881.[5]\n\nA common thread in the series is that people deserve a second chance; Marshal Micah Torrance is a recovering alcoholic, and McCain gives a convict a job on his ranch in \"The Marshal\". Royal Dano appeared in \"The Sheridan Story\" as a former Confederate soldier who is given a job on the McCain ranch and encounters General Philip Sheridan, the man who cost him his arm in battle. Learning why the man wants him dead, Sheridan arranges for medical care for his wounded former foe, quoting Abraham Lincoln's last orders to \"... bind up the nation's wounds\".[6]\n\nDespite his status as the series' protagonist, Lucas McCain is not without fault; He has a tendency to be stubborn and bossy, and has a bit of an inflated ego. In \"Death Trap\", an episode with Philip Carey as former gunman (and old adversary) Simon Battles, he is unwilling to believe the man has changed and become a doctor. It takes a gunfight (with Battles fighting alongside him) to make him admit he is wrong. In \"Two Ounces of Tin\", with Sammy Davis Jr. as Tip Corey (a former circus trick-shot artist turned gunman), McCain angrily orders him off the ranch when he finds him demonstrating his skills to Mark. Corey suggests he is a hypocrite, because McCain has an equally deadly reputation in the Indian Territory of Oklahoma, where he first acquired the nickname \"the Rifleman\", and where his wife had died during a smallpox epidemic.[citation needed]\n\nCast\n\nBeverly Englander and Chuck Connors in the 1961 episode \"Lariat\"\n\nMain\n\nChuck Connors as Lucas McCain, a rancher, a Union Army veteran of the American Civil War, father, and widower\n\nJohnny Crawford as Mark McCain, Lucas's son\n\nPaul Fix as Micah Torrance, marshal of North Fork, New Mexico\n\nRecurring\n\nEight actors played the town doctor during the series (usually known as \"Doc Burrage\"): Paul Fix (first episode only; he returned to the cast as Micah), Edgar Buchanan, Fay Roope, Rhys Williams, Jack Kruschen, Robert Burton, Ralph Moody and Bert Stevens.

Peckinpah, who wrote and directed many early episodes, based many characters and plots on his own childhood on a ranch. His insistence on violent realism and complex characterizations, as well as his refusal to sugarcoat the lessons he felt the Rifleman's son needed to learn about life, put him at odds with the show's producers at Four Star. Peckinpah left the show and created a short-lived series, The Westerner, with Brian Keith.[citation needed]\n\nOpening credits\n\nThe opening theme at the beginning of each episode depicted McCain walking down the street of a town while rapid-firing his Winchester 44-40 1892 model rifle that had been modified at the trigger and lever. The rifle's modification allowed McCain to fire the rifle only by hand pumping the lever, which had a setscrew imbedded in it to trip the weapon's trigger.[citation needed] At various points during the series, episodes would show McCain deftly handling and shooting the rifle ambidextrously.[10] When Connors auditioned for the show, the director suddenly threw a rifle at him; the former Major League Baseball player caught it and got the job.[11]\n\nRifle\n\nLarge lever firing loop on the Rifleman's rifle\n\nWesterns were popular when The Rifleman premiered, and producers tried to find gimmicks to distinguish one show from another. The Rifleman's gimmick was a modified Winchester Model 1892 rifle, with a large ring lever drilled and tapped for a set screw. The lever design allowed him to cock the rifle by spinning it around his hand. In addition, the screw could be positioned to depress the trigger every time he worked the lever, allowing for rapid fire, emptying the magazine in under six seconds during the opening credits on North Fork's main street.[12]\n\nThe trigger-trip screw pin was used in two configurations: with the screw head turned inside (close to the trigger), or more often, outside the trigger guard with a locknut on the outside (to secure its position). In some episodes, the screw was removed, when rapid-fire action was not required. When properly adjusted, the screw \u201csqueezed\u201d the trigger when the lever was fully closed. The rapid-fire mechanism was originally designed to keep Connors from puncturing his finger with the trigger as he quickly cycled the action of the rifle. With this modification, Connors pulling the trigger for each shot was not necessary, so he did not have to place his finger in harm's way.\n\nThe rifle may have appeared in every episode, but it was not always fired; some plots did not require violent solutions (for example, one involving Mark's rigid new teacher). McCain attempts to solve as many problems as possible without resorting to shooting, yet still manages to kill 120 villains over the show's five-year run. Notably, McCain almost never carried a pistol, although he is a good shot with it, especially when he improvised a crude gunstock from a board, when facing a villain who had stolen his rifle.\n\nThe rifle used on the set of The Rifleman, an 1892 Winchester caliber .44-40 carbine with a standard 20-inch barrel, was an historical anachronism, as the show was set in 1881, 12 years before John Browning had designed the rifle. It appeared with two different types of levers. The backwards, round-D-style loop was used in the early episodes. Sometimes, the rifle McCain uses has a saddle ring. The lever style later changed to a flatter lever (instead of the large loop) with no saddle ring.\n\nMcCain fires 12 shots from his rifle during the opening credits - seven shots in the first close-up and five more as the camera switches to another view. The blank cartridges are shorter than standard cartridges, so the magazine can hold more of the blanks. The soundtrack contained a dubbed 13th shot, to allow the firing to end with a section of the theme music. The rifle was chambered for the .44-40 Winchester center fire cartridge, which was used in both revolvers and rifles.[13] He could supposedly fire off his first round in three-tenths of a second, which certainly helped in a showdown.\n\nRifle replica\n\nGunsmith James S. Stembridge modified two Model 1892s for use in regular and close-up filming.[14] In addition, a Spanish-made G\u00e1rate y Anit\u00faa \"El Tigre\" lever action, a near-copy of the Model 1892, was modified for use as a knockabout gun. The El Tigre is seen in scenes where the rifle is in a saddle scabbard and is not drawn, and in stunts where the rifle was thrown to the ground, used as a club, or in any stunt where a possibility of damage to the original Winchester 1892s existed.[15] These three rifles were the only ones used by Connors during the run of the series.\n\nThe now-defunct Stembridge Gun Rentals provided the rifles and ammunition. Ammunition was quarter-load 5-in-1 blank cartridges containing smokeless powder, which did not produce the thick clouds of smoke the genuine black powder cartridges of the 1880s did. Most (if not all) of the sound effects for the rifle shots were dubbed, which is why the rifle sounded so different from the other gunshots on the show.\n\nThe 1892 Winchester is a top-eject rifle (opening the action by pushing the finger-lever forward moves the bolt rearward and thereby opens the top of the receiver). Loaded rounds or empty cases from the chamber eject straight up when the lever is pushed fully open (forward). When Connors cycled the action by spinning the rifle to his side, the cartridge in the action could fall out. Therefore, the rifle was modified with a plunger, which would hold the round in place.\n\nThe Winchester Model 1892 rifle was designed by John Moses Browning, and other than general appearance, it has nothing in common with earlier lever-action rifles using the same class of cartridges. The significant improvement was the addition of vertical lugs that securely lock the bolt and receiver when the gun fires. Winchester originally produced this gun from 1892 to 1941; total production was slightly over 1,000,000; 27 variations in five chamberings were made over the course of production, but the basic design was largely unaltered. As with the earlier Model 1873, the light and handy Model 1892 was chambered for handgun cartridges, favored by many Westerners to simplify ammunition supply problems by using the same cartridge in both a handgun and a rifle. The Model 1892 was replaced by the Browning-designed Model 1894, which also had an impressive manufacturing history, with over 7,000,000 produced; it is still being produced to this day by a successor to Winchester. The Model 94's popularity and long production history may be related to its being the first Winchester to be designed for the then-new \"smokeless\" powder.\n\nDirecting and writing\n\nThe pilot episode, \"The Sharpshooter\", was originally telecast on CBS as part of Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre on March 7, 1958; it was repeated (in edited form) as the first episode of the series on ABC. The episode was written by Sam Peckinpah, and guest starred Dennis Hopper.\n\nRegulars on the program included Marshal Micah Torrance (R. G. Armstrong was the original marshal for two episodes, the first and the fourth), Sweeney the bartender (Bill Quinn), and a half-dozen other residents of North Fork (played by Hope Summers, Joan Taylor, Patricia Blair, John Harmon, and Harlan Warde).\n\nFifty-one episodes of the series were directed by Joseph H. Lewis (director of 1950's Gun Crazy and known for his film noir style). Ida Lupino directed one episode, \"The Assault\".\n\nConnors wrote several episodes. Robert Culp (star of CBS's Trackdown, another Four Star production), wrote one two-part episode, and Frank D. Gilroy (creator of ABC's Burke's Law, another Four Star production), wrote \"End of a Young Gun\".[citation needed]\n\nRelease\n\nHome media\n\nMPI Home Video has released The Rifleman on DVD in Region 1 in a number of versions.

Marx Toys also marketed a version called the Wild West that was simply the Lone Ranger/Roy Rogers Winchester with the loop lever used by McCain replacing the standard straight lever.[30]\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nChristopher Sharrett, The Rifleman (TV Milestones Series), Wayne State University Press, 2005"}], "William Quinn directed several episodes of The Rifleman.": [{"url": "https://www.therifleman.net/episodes?episode=101", "page_content": "The PrisonerEpisode 101Writer: Arthur Browne, Jr.Director: Joseph H.
