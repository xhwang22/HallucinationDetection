American swimmer Dara Torres won 12 career Olympic medals, 4 of which were gold. Her 12 medals tied a record for the most won by a female Olympian from the United States. Celebrated for her longevity in swimming, Torres was the first American swimmer to compete at five Olympic Games. In 2008, at the age of 41, she became the oldest swimming medalist in Olympic history.\n\nTorres was born on April 15, 1967, in Beverly Hills, California. She was Cuban American. When she was growing up, her older brothers swam at their local YMCA, and at age seven she followed them into the sport. A prodigy in the pool, she began setting national age-group records when she was 12 years old. At age 14 she claimed her first senior national title, winning the 50-yard freestyle race at the Senior Short Course Nationals. In 1983 she twice set world records in the long-course 50-meter freestyle event. The following year she lowered the world record once more, to 25.61 seconds, and qualified for her first Olympics. At the 1984 Games in Los Angeles, California, she helped the U.S. 4 \u00d7 100-meter freestyle relay team win the gold medal and establish a new American record with a time of 3 minutes, 43.43 seconds.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1985, Torres attended the University of Florida. As a collegiate swimmer she garnered 28 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) All-American honors. She was named the NCAA Swimmer of the Year in 1988. That year she competed at the Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, where she earned a silver medal in the 4 \u00d7 100-meter medley relay and a bronze medal in the 4 \u00d7 100-meter freestyle relay. She returned to the Olympics four years later. At the 1992 Games in Barcelona, Spain, she captured gold again in the 4 \u00d7 100-meter freestyle relay. This time Torres and her teammates set a world record in the event, finishing in 3 minutes, 39.46 seconds.\n\nFollowing the Barcelona Games, Torres took a long break from competitive swimming. She worked in television broadcasting for a number of years. In 1999, however, she resumed training, with an eye toward qualifying for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. At the 2000 U.S. Olympic Trials she proved that she remained a force, winning the 50-meter freestyle and finishing second behind Jenny Thompson in both the 100-meter freestyle and the 100-meter butterfly. At the Sydney Games, the following month, Torres enjoyed her most successful Olympics, securing five medals. She won gold in the 4 \u00d7 100-meter freestyle relay and the 4 \u00d7 100-meter medley relay. In individual competition she took home the bronze in the 50-meter freestyle and the 100-meter butterfly. She also tied Thompson for the bronze in the 100-meter freestyle.\n\nTorres again stepped away from competition after the Sydney Games. She resumed her broadcasting career, and in 2006 she gave birth to a daughter, Tessa. Following her pregnancy she took part in a couple of masters swimming events (for older competitive swimmers). Her impressive performances at those meets convinced her to make a bid for her fifth Olympic Games. At the 2008 Olympic Trials she won the 50-meter freestyle, thus becoming the oldest swimmer ever to qualify for the U.S. Olympic team. Torres went on to win three silver medals at the 2008 Games in Beijing, China (50-meter freestyle, 4 \u00d7 100-meter freestyle relay, 4 \u00d7 100-meter medley relay). In addition to becoming the oldest swimmer to medal at an Olympics, Torres moved into a tie with Thompson as the most decorated female American Olympian (their record of 12 career Olympic medals was later equaled by American swimmer Natalie Coughlin).\n\nIn 2012 Torres placed fourth in the 50-meter freestyle at the U.S. Olympic Trials, coming up short in her attempt to make her sixth Olympic team. She announced her retirement from swimming after the trials. Torres was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 2016 and the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee Hall of Fame in 2019."}, {"url": "https://articlebio.com/dara-torres", "page_content": "Synopsis\n\nA former World champion in swimming, Dana Torres, is from the United States of America.

I'm clean.\"[31] In addition to employing her training team of coach Michael Lohberg, a sprint coach, a chiropractor, and two masseuses, Torres used resistance-stretching trainers, calling it her \"secret weapon\" for continued success.[14][32] Her $100,000-per-year training costs were partially subsidized by her corporate sponsors Speedo, Toyota, and Bloomberg L.P.[14]\n\n\"I think this performance ranks up there with the biggest performances in sports ever ... It puts Dara in the ranks of Michael Phelps, Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods. What she has done is really not measurable.\" Michael Lohberg, Torres' coach, discussing her winning three Olympic silver medals at the age of 41.[33]\n\nAt the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Torres won a silver medal as the anchor swimmer of the second-place U.S. team in the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay.[10] It was the fifth time in five tries she earned an Olympic medal in the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay.[10] With the American relay team's second-place finish, she became the oldest swimmer to win a medal in Olympic history, surpassing British swimmer William Robinson, who was 38 at the time of the 1908 Summer Olympics.[34]\n\nOn August 17, 2008, she won the silver medal in the 50-meter freestyle, finishing in a new American record time of 24.07 seconds, one one-hundredth (0.01) of a second behind the winner, Britta Steffen.[35] Her second-place time was a new American record, and 0.18 of a second faster than she swam at the U.S. Olympic Trials.[35] Thirty-five minutes later, she won another silver medal swimming the freestyle anchor leg for the second-place U.S. team in the 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay.[36] Her split on the 4\u00d7100 medley relay (52.27 seconds) was the fastest 100-meter freestyle split in relay history.[36] The American record for the women's 100-meter freestyle as an individual event was 53.39 seconds as of August 2008, making Torres' time more than a full second faster.[36]\n\nTorres' 12 Olympic medals tied the all-time medal record for a female Olympic swimmer set by fellow American Jenny Thompson in 2004; American Natalie Coughlin subsequently equaled the record in 2012.[37]\n\nAftermath and retirement At the U.S. National Championships in 2009, Torres won the 50-meter freestyle with the fourth-best time in the world for the year (24.42), and she also placed in the 50-meter butterfly, qualifying her to compete in those events at the 2009 World Championships.[38] This was the first time since 1986 that Torres competed in the World Championships; she placed eighth in the 50-meter freestyle and she did not advance beyond the qualifying heats in the 50-meter butterfly.[citation needed]\n\nFollowing reconstructive surgery of one of her knees, she began training with the goal of competing in the 2012 Summer Olympics.[39] At the 2012 United States Olympic Trials, she placed fourth in the finals of the 50-meter freestyle, 0.32 of a second behind the winner, Jessica Hardy, and 0.09 of a second behind the second qualifier, Kara Lynn Joyce.[40][41] Only the top-two finishers in each trials event qualified for the 2012 U.S. Olympic team, and as a result, Torres concluded her Olympic career.[40] After the 2012 Trials, Torres announced her retirement from competitive swimming, concluding her career with 12 Olympic medals.[41] Her Olympic career spanned 24 years from 1984 to 2008 and five Olympic Games (1984, 1988, 1992, 2000, 2008).[10]\n\nLife outside swimming\n\nTorres in the 2010 Heart Truth fashion show Torres has worked in television as a reporter and announcer for American networks NBC, ESPN, TNT, OLN, and Fox News Channel, and hosted the golf show, The Clubhouse on the Resort Sports Network.[42] She has also worked as a model, and was the first elite swimmer to model swimwear in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, appearing in the 1994 edition.[32] She was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2005.[43]\n\nAfter 1992, she married and subsequently divorced sports producer Jeff Gowen.[2] After 2000, she converted to Judaism fully (she was already half Jewish) before marrying the Israeli surgeon Itzhak Shasha (her own father had been Jewish).[2] Torres and Shasha later divorced.[2] Torres and reproductive endocrinologist David Hoffman began dating after her break-up with Shasha, and they became the parents of Tessa Grace Torres-Hoffman, born in 2006.[14] After the birth of their daughter, Hoffman, a masters swimmer, persuaded her to begin training again.[28]\n\nTorres is a veteran celebrity swimmer for Swim Across America, a charitable organization that raises funds for cancer research in which she has participated for several years.[44] She is the author of two books: Age is Just a Number: Achieve Your Dreams at Any Stage in Your Life (with Elizabeth Weil), and Gold Medal Fitness: A Revolutionary 5-Week Program (with Billie Fitzpatrick).[45]\n\nTorres is also involved with the American chapter of the foundation of Princess Charlene of Monaco, a charitable organization at which she sits, as Vice-President, on the board of directors.[46]\n\nWorld records Women's 50-meter freestyle\n\nTime Date Event Location 25.69 January 29, 1983 Speedo International swim meet Amersfoort, Netherlands[3] 25.62 August 5, 1983 U.S. national championships Clovis, California[3] 25.61 July 21, 1984 Pre-Olympic swim meet Mission Viejo, California[47] Women's 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay\n\nTime Date Event Location 3:39.46 July 28, 1992 1992 Summer Olympics Barcelona, Spain[citation needed] 3:36.61 September 16, 2000 2000 Summer Olympics Sydney, Australia[citation needed] Women's 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay\n\nTime Date Event Location 3:58.30 September 23, 2000 2000 Summer Olympics Sydney, Australia[48]"}, {"url": "https://www.famousdetails.com/dara-torres/", "page_content": "Dara Torres (Swimmer) was born on the 15th of April, 1967.

Torres is the first and only swimmer to represent the United States in five Olympic Games (1984, 1988, 1992, 2000 and 2008), and, at age 41, was the oldest swimmer ever to earn a place on the U.S. Olympic team.

On August 4, she broke her own American record in the 50-meter freestyle, 26 years after she first set the American record at just 15 years old.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nTorres was born in Beverly Hills, California, the daughter of Edward Torres and Marylu Kauder. She grew up in Los Angeles, California, the fifth of six children and the older of two girls. At age 7, Torres started following her brothers to swim practice at the local Y.M.C.A. and later joined the Culver City swim team.\n\nShe attended the Westlake School for Girls (now Harvard-Westlake School), and swam for the Westlake swim team under coach Darlene Bible, where she set California Interscholastic Federation records that remain to this day.

Her winning teammates in the final event included Nancy Hogshead, Jenna Johnson and Carrie Steinseifer; Jill Sterkel and Mary Wayte also swam in the event's second-round qualifying heat.\n\n1988 Summer Olympics\n\nFor the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea, Torres qualified for the U.S. women's team in one individual event and two relay events. Torres earned a bronze medal for swimming for the third-place U.S. women's team in the 4x100-meter freestyle relay final together with Mitzi Kremer, Laura Walker and Mary Wayte; and won a silver medal for swimming the freestyle leg of the 4x100-meter medley relay in the third heat of the qualifying round for the second-place U.S. team. Torres also placed seventh in the final of the 100-meter freestyle event.\n\n1992 Summer Olympics\n\nTorres qualified for the U.S. Olympic women's team in a single event for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. She swam the second leg of the 4x100-meter freestyle relay for the winning U.S. team that included Nicole Haislett, Angel Martino and Jenny Thompson, and earned a gold medal for her efforts in the final event and first-round qualifying heat. Ashley Tappin and Chrissy Ahmann also swam for the team in the qualifying heats of the event.\n\n2000 Summer Olympics\n\nTorres won five medals at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, but, as usual, saved her best for two of the major relay events of the U.S. Olympic women's team. She swam the second leg for the winning U.S. women's team in final of the 4x100-meter freestyle team that included Amy Van Dyken, Courtney Shealy and Jenny Thompson, with Erin Phenix and Ashley Tappin also swimming in the qualifying rounds. Torres won a second gold medal for anchoring the winning U.S. team in the 4x100-meter medley relay, together with teammates B.J. Bedford, Megan Quann and Jenny Thompson in the final, and Courtney Shealy, Staciana Stitts, Ashley Tappin and Amy Van Dyken in the qualifying rounds. Torres also earned three individual bronze medals in each of the 50-meter freestyle, the 100-meter butterfly and the 100-meter freestyle\u2014tying teammate Jenny Thompson for third place in the last event. At 33 years old, Torres was already the oldest member of the U.S. Olympic swim team, but won more medals (5) than any other team member.\n\n2008 Summer Olympics\n\nAt age 41, Torres returned to the pool to obtain a spot in her fifth Olympic Games, unprecedented for an American female swimmer, especially given the fact that she sat out the 1996 and 2004 Olympic games. In fact, she is the first woman in history to swim in the Olympics past the age of 40. Her Olympic career spans twenty-four years.\n\nOn July 5, 2008, she qualified for the finals in the 50-meter freestyle that were held on July 6. In that semi-final, she broke the American record with a time of 24.38 seconds. On July 6, in the finals she broke that record for the ninth time, setting it at 24.25 seconds and winning the top American women's spot in the 50-meter freestyle. On July 7, Torres confirmed that she would be pulling out of 100-meter freestyle swim for her time at the Beijing Olympics to focus her efforts on the 50-meter freestyle. Lacey Nymeyer took over the position from Torres. On July 30, at the U.S. swim team's final training in Singapore, Torres, together with Amanda Beard and Natalie Coughlin were elected captains of the U.S. Olympic women's swimming team.\n\nIn order to pre-empt any speculation that she might be taking performance-enhancing drugs, Torres volunteered for an enhanced drug-testing program. According to her, when people ask if she is on performance-enhancing drugs, she takes it as a compliment. Torres uses resistance stretching with trainers Anne Tierney and Steve Sierra from Innovative Body Solutions and refers to this training as her \"secret weapon\" for continued success.\n\nTorres won silver on August 10, 2008, at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing as the anchor swimmer of the U.S. 4x100-meter freestyle relay. This was the fifth time in five tries she has earned an Olympic medal in that event.\n\nOn August 17, 2008, at the age of 41 years and 125 days, she won the silver medal in the women's 50-meter freestyle, finishing in a new American record time of 24.07, 0.01 of a second behind the winner, Britta Steffen. About thirty-five minutes later, she won another silver medal as part of the U.S. 4x100-meter medley relay team. Torres' split on the 4x100 medley relay (52.27) is the fastest 100-meter freestyle split in relay history. The American record for the women's 100-meter freestyle as an individual event was 53.39 seconds as of August 2008, making Torres' time a full second faster\u2014fast even for a relay split.\n\nTorres' twelve Olympic medals tie the all-time medal record for a female Olympic swimmer with fellow American Jenny Thompson. Eight of Thompson's medals were gold, compared with Torres' four. However, Torres has won twice as many individual medals (4) as Thompson (2), Thompson having won ten medals in relay team events.\n\n2009 National and World Championships\n\nAt the U.S. National Championships, Torres won the 50-meter freestyle and placed in the 50-met butterfly to qualify to swim at the 2009 World Championships in Rome, Italy. This was the first time since 1986 that Torres competed in the World Championships; she placed eighth in the 50-meter freestyle and she did not advance beyond the qualifying heats in the 50-meter butterfly.\n\n2012 Summer Olympics\n\nFollowing reconstructive surgery of one of her knees, Torres stated in September 2010 that she had begun training with the goal of competing in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England.\n\nPersonal life\n\nTorres has worked in television as a reporter and announcer for American networks such as NBC, ESPN, TNT, OLN and Fox News Channel. She now hosts the golf show The Clubhouse, on the Resort Sports Network. She is also an occasional model, having appeared in the Sports Illustrated 1994 Swimsuit Issue. In 2005, she was elected to the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, she married and subsequently divorced sports producer Jeff Gowen. Her second marriage was also brief from June 2003 to December 2004, to Israeli-born surgeon Itzhak Shasha. Prior to marrying Shasha, Torres officially converted to Judaism (her late father was Jewish) to formalise her status under Halacha.\n\nTorres is no longer dating her reproductive endocrinologist, David Hoffman, but the two remain close friends. Hoffman was the fertility doctor who treated Torres. When Torres and Shasha separated, Torres and Hoffman began dating. Torres and Hoffman are the parents of Tessa Grace Torres-Hoffman, born in April 2006.\n\nBP Products North America engaged Torres in 2009 to be part of its \"Team Invigorate\" advertising campaign to inspire others to live \"younger for longer.\" She is the author of the inspirational memoir, Age is Just a Number, published in April 2009, and Gold Medal Fitness, published in May 2010.\n\nIn December 2009, The New York Times reported that a sports medicine doctor, Anthony Galea, with whom Torres had previously consulted, was under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for allegedly distributing human growth hormone and the drug Actovegin to professional athletes. Torres said that Dr. Galea's work was limited to draining fluid from her knee and diagnosing a muscle tear.\n\nTorres is a veteran celebrity swimmer for Swim Across America, a charitable organization that raises funds for cancer research, in which she has participated for several years.\n\nSee also\n\nFlorida Gators\n\nList of notable Jewish swimmers\n\nList of multiple Olympic gold medalists\n\nList of multiple Olympic gold medalists in one event\n\nList of multiple Olympic medalists in one event\n\nList of United States records in swimming\n\nList of University of Florida alumni\n\nList of University of Florida Olympians\n\nWorld record progression 50 metres freestyle\n\n\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\nTorres, Dara, & Elizabeth Weil, Age is Just a Number: Achieve Your Dreams at Any Stage in Your Life , Broadway Books, New York, New York (2009).

In fact, she is the first woman in history to swim in the Olympics past the age of 40. Her Olympic career spans twenty-four years.\n\nOn July 5, 2008, she qualified for the finals in the 50-meter freestyle that were held on July 6.

About thirty-five minutes later, she won another silver medal as part of the U.S. 4x100-meter medley relay team. Torres' split on the 4x100 medley relay (52.27) is the fastest 100-meter freestyle split in relay history. The American record for the women's 100-meter freestyle as an individual event was 53.39 seconds as of August 2008, making Torres' time a full second faster\u2014fast even for a relay split.\n\nTorres' twelve Olympic medals tie the all-time medal record for a female Olympic swimmer with fellow American Jenny Thompson. Eight of Thompson's medals were gold, compared with Torres' four. However, Torres has won twice as many individual medals (4) as Thompson (2), Thompson having won ten medals in relay team events.\n\n2009 National and World Championships\n\nAt the U.S. National Championships, Torres won the 50-meter freestyle and placed in the 50-met butterfly to qualify to swim at the 2009 World Championships in Rome, Italy.

She now hosts the golf show The Clubhouse, on the Resort Sports Network. She is also an occasional model, having appeared in the Sports Illustrated 1994 Swimsuit Issue. In 2005, she was elected to the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, she married and subsequently divorced sports producer Jeff Gowen.

I'm clean.\"[31] In addition to employing her training team of coach Michael Lohberg, a sprint coach, a chiropractor, and two masseuses, Torres used resistance-stretching trainers, calling it her \"secret weapon\" for continued success.[14][32] Her $100,000-per-year training costs were partially subsidized by her corporate sponsors Speedo, Toyota, and Bloomberg L.P.[14]\n\n\"I think this performance ranks up there with the biggest performances in sports ever ...

American Natalie Coughlin subsequently equaled the record in 2012.[37]\n\nAftermath and retirement At the U.S. National Championships in 2009, Torres won the 50-meter freestyle with the fourth-best time in the world for the year (24.42), and she also placed in the 50-meter butterfly, qualifying her to compete in those events at the 2009 World Championships.[38] This was the first time since 1986 that Torres competed in the World Championships; she placed eighth in the 50-meter freestyle and she did not advance beyond the qualifying heats in the 50-meter butterfly.[citation needed]\n\nFollowing reconstructive surgery of one of her knees, she began training with the goal of competing in the 2012 Summer Olympics.[39] At the 2012 United States Olympic Trials, she placed fourth in the finals of the 50-meter freestyle, 0.32 of a second behind the winner, Jessica Hardy, and 0.09 of a second behind the second qualifier, Kara Lynn Joyce.[40][41] Only the top-two finishers in each trials event qualified for the 2012 U.S. Olympic team, and as a result, Torres concluded her Olympic career.[40] After the 2012 Trials, Torres announced her retirement from competitive swimming, concluding her career with 12 Olympic medals.[41] Her Olympic career spanned 24 years from 1984 to 2008 and five Olympic Games (1984, 1988, 1992, 2000, 2008).[10]\n\nLife outside swimming\n\nTorres in the 2010 Heart Truth fashion show Torres has worked in television as a reporter and announcer for American networks NBC, ESPN, TNT, OLN, and Fox News Channel, and hosted the golf show, The Clubhouse on the Resort Sports Network.[42] She has also worked as a model, and was the first elite swimmer to model swimwear in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, appearing in the 1994 edition.[32] She was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2005.[43]\n\nAfter 1992, she married and subsequently divorced sports producer Jeff Gowen.[2] After 2000, she converted to Judaism fully (she was already half Jewish) before marrying the Israeli surgeon Itzhak Shasha (her own father had been Jewish).[2] Torres and Shasha later divorced.[2] Torres and reproductive endocrinologist David Hoffman began dating after her break-up with Shasha, and they became the parents of Tessa Grace Torres-Hoffman, born in 2006.[14] After the birth of their daughter, Hoffman, a masters swimmer, persuaded her to begin training again.[28]\n\nTorres is a veteran celebrity swimmer for Swim Across America, a charitable organization that raises funds for cancer research in which she has participated for several years.[44] She is the author of two books: Age is Just a Number: Achieve Your Dreams at Any Stage in Your Life (with Elizabeth Weil), and Gold Medal Fitness: A Revolutionary 5-Week Program (with Billie Fitzpatrick).[45]\n\nTorres is also involved with the American chapter of the foundation of Princess Charlene of Monaco, a charitable organization at which she sits, as Vice-President, on the board of directors.[46]\n\nWorld records Women's 50-meter freestyle\n\nTime Date Event Location 25.69 January 29, 1983 Speedo International swim meet Amersfoort, Netherlands[3] 25.62 August 5, 1983 U.S. national championships Clovis, California[3] 25.61 July 21, 1984 Pre-Olympic swim meet Mission Viejo, California[47] Women's 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay\n\nTime Date Event Location 3:39.46 July 28, 1992 1992 Summer Olympics Barcelona, Spain[citation needed] 3:36.61 September 16, 2000 2000 Summer Olympics Sydney, Australia[citation needed] Women's 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay\n\nTime Date Event Location 3:58.30 September 23, 2000 2000 Summer Olympics Sydney, Australia[48]"}], "Dara Grace Torres is a former competitive swimmer.": [{"url": "https://olympics.com/en/athletes/dara-torres", "page_content": "Biography\n\nDara Torres had the longest successful career of any Olympic swimmer, one which saw her win 12 Olympic medals and four gold medals.

Torres talks about that in-depth for the first time in a documentary that airs on the SEC Network on Monday called \u201cOnce Upon A Comeback.\u201d\n\nAs a swimmer at the University of Florida during the \u201880s, Torres says she faced pressure from coaches, particularly Randy Reese, to lose weight. At the time, the coaches didn\u2019t know a lot about eating disorders, she says.\n\nOne coach wanted the team to look intimidating to competitors on the starting blocks and set a weight goal for the swimmers to meet, she says. If someone didn\u2019t make weight, they had to do extra workouts.\n\n\u201cFor me personally, having come from a background where I've never trained like that before in my life, to have to do extra workouts was just, that wasn't going to happen for me,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd one thing led to another. I sort of got in this habit of bingeing and purging in my freshman year, and that's kind of how it all started and just sort of snowballed from there.\u201d\n\nThe coaches weighed the girls right on the pool deck, as Torres describes in the film, and sometimes the swimmers would break down in tears if they didn't make weight. The intense pressure to make weight came from an inner desire to please her coaches, she says.\n\nThe cycle of bingeing and purging took over Torres\u2019 life and psyche \u2014 but now she views the difficult experience as a lesson.\n\n\u201cIt was obviously a very dark time in my life and I wouldn't wish that upon my worst enemy,\u201d she says. \u201cBut yet I learned a lot from it and it made me the person who I am today.\u201d\n\nTorres says she tried talking to a male team doctor at the university about her struggles, but the conversation ended with him handing her information on eating disorders.\n\nAfter she graduated college, she went to get a physical and the doctor asked her if she\u2019s ever binged and purged. Torres said no, but later called the doctor back and admitted she had a problem.\n\nThe first step to recovery was opening up about her disorder, she says. Her advice to people struggling with eating disorders is to talk about it.\n\n\u201cI knew I had a lot of work to do after that but it was a huge relief to get it off my shoulders after four years of only me knowing that I had this issue,\u201d she says.\n\nTorres swam in the Olympics in Seoul in 1988, Barcelona in 1992, Sydney in 2000 and Beijing in 2008. When the time to train for Beijing arrived, Torres was pregnant, in her 40s and swimming for exercise.\n\nShe says she received invitations to swim in a few meets, and then people started to ask, \u201cWouldn't it be great to see a middle-aged person in the Olympic Games?\u201d Since she loves a challenge, Torres decided to go for gold once again.\n\nThe swimmer ended up winning three silver medals in Beijing. As she trained, Torres kept the goal of winning a gold medal in her head.\n\n\u201cI kept that thought with me every single day for the almost two years after that I trained for the Olympic trials and Olympic Games,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I really think the power of positive thinking can play a role in what you do in your life.\u201d\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn how she started swimming\n\n\u201cWell, I have four older brothers, and I was very competitive the minute I was born. It's like, who could be the first one in the car? Who could be the first one done at the dinner table? Just always competing with them. Whatever they would do, I would do. So the minute they started on a swim team, my mom had me in the stands. That didn't go very well because I had a lot of energy. And I think back then they called it hyperactivity, but I'm sure I had ADD. And she put me in the pool just to get the energy out and not have it all around her and just focus it somewhere. So I started swimming and just fell in love with the sport.\u201d\n\nOn whether swimming came easy to her\n\n\u201cIt really did. I really could just get up on the starting blocks and do the start into the water and swim fast and no big deal. And I think that all changed when I started to notice changes in my body, started to become more of a woman, and realized that I actually have to work hard to be fast. It just doesn't come easy anymore. \u201c\n\nOn if she left the sport satisfied after she didn\u2019t qualify for a sixth Olympic team in 2012\n\n\u201cI really did. It's funny because when I got out of the pool after those Olympic trials and I missed the team by nine one-hundredths of a second, I looked in the stands. I saw my daughter crying and I saw my mom crying. I'm like, \u2018Oh, my gosh, I have to go over and console them.\u2019 And, you know, my mom, obviously, she was upset because she's my mom and she wanted to see me make another Olympic team, but my daughter, I'm like, \u2018Tessa, What's wrong? Are you OK?\u2019 She's like, \u2018Now I don't get to go to London and see Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte.\u2019 I'm like, oh, my gosh, she's starting way too early, you know? So it was kind of funny. It was a little bit of a role reversal of, you know, me having to console my mom. But I was OK. I knew that the time that I did Olympic trials, my sixth Olympic trials, was the second-fastest time I've ever done at trials. But the girls are getting faster and I couldn't give it anything else. I gave it all I had.\u201d\n\nOn what she tells her daughter about body image and her experience with eating disorders\n\n\u201cI continuously tell her how beautiful she is on the inside and out and not to base everything off of food. And just to make sure that when you want to eat stuff that, you know, you're maybe not supposed to have, eat it in smaller portions and you'll be fine.\u201d\n\nAlex Ashlock produced and edited this interview for broadcast with Todd Mundt.

Torres is the first swimmer to represent the United States in five Olympic Games (1984, 1988, 1992, 2000 and 2008), and at age 41, the oldest swimmer to earn a place on the U.S. Olympic team. At the 2008 Summer Olympics, she competed in the 50-meter freestyle, 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay, and 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay, and won silver medals in all three events.\n\nTorres has won 12 Olympic medals (four gold, four silver, four bronze), one of three women with the most Olympic women's swimming medals. The others are fellow Americans Jenny Thompson and Natalie Coughlin. Torres won five medals at the 2000 Summer Olympics, when at age 33, she was the oldest member of the 2000 U.S. Olympic swim team. She has also won at least one medal in each of the five Olympics in which she has competed, making her one of only a handful of Olympians to earn medals in five different Games.\n\nContents Early years Torres was born on April 15, 1967, to a family in Los Angeles, California, the daughter of Edward Torres, and Marylu Kauder.[1] Her father was a real estate developer and casino owner, originally from Cuba; her mother Marylu was a former American model.[1][2] Torres grew up in Beverly Hills, California, the fifth of six children and the older of two girls.[2] As a seven-year-old, she followed in the footsteps of her older brothers by joining their community YMCA for swimming practice; afterward, she signed up for the swimming club in Culver City to train.[2] At 14, she won the national open championship in the 50-yard freestyle by defeating the then-current champion, Jill Sterkel, a college junior.[3]\n\nShe attended the Westlake School for Girls (now Harvard-Westlake School),[1] and competed for the Westlake swim team under coach Darlene Bible from the seventh grade through her sophomore year in high school.[4] She was also a member of the Westlake basketball, gymnastics, and volleyball teams.[4] During her 1983\u201384 high school junior year, she left home to swim for the Mission Viejo Nadadores in Mission Viejo, California, while training for her first Olympics under coach Mark Schubert.[3] After the 1984 Olympics, Torres returned to the Westlake School to graduate in 1985.[4]\n\nCollege swimming career Torres accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where she swam for the Florida Gators swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) ion under coach Randy Reese from 1986 to 1989.[5] In her four years as a Gator swimmer, Torres won nine Southeastern Conference (SEC) individual championships, including the 50-yard freestyle (1987, 1988, 1989), 100-yard freestyle (1987, 1988, 1989), 200-yard freestyle (1987), and 100-yard butterfly (1988, 1989); she was also a member of 12 of the Gators' SEC championship relay teams.[6] Torres won three NCAA individual national championships (50-yard freestyle, 100-yard freestyle, 100-yard butterfly) in 1988; and was a member of six of the Gators' NCAA championship relay teams, including the 400-yard freestyle relay in 1986; the 200-yard and 400-yard medley relays, and the 400-yard freestyle relay in 1988; and the 200-yard and 400-yard medley relays in 1989.[6] She was named the SEC Athlete of the Year in 1988, SEC Female Swimmer of the Year in 1987 and 1989, and earned 28 All-American swimming honors\u2014the maximum number possible during a college career.[2][6] Torres also lettered in volleyball at Florida, playing the sport in her fifth year after having exhausted her NCAA eligibility in swimming.[7]\n\nTorres graduated from the university with a bachelor's degree in telecommunications in 1990 and was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a \"Gator Great\" in 1999.[8][9] In November 2013, she was named as a recipient of the 2014 NCAA Silver Anniversary Award, presented annually to six distinguished former student-athletes on the 25th anniversary of their final school year of athletic eligibility.[7]\n\nInternational swimming career 1984, 1988 and 1992 Olympics At the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, Torres was a member of the winning U.S. women's 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay team, swimming in the first-round qualifying heat and earning a gold medal in the event final.[10] Her winning teammates in that final included Nancy Hogshead, Jenna Johnson, and Carrie Steinseifer; Jill Sterkel and Mary Wayte also swam in the event's second-round qualifying heat.[11]\n\nFor the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, Torres qualified for the U.S. Olympic women's team in one individual event and two relay events. Torres earned a bronze medal for swimming for the third-place U.S. women's team in the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay final, together with teammates Mitzi Kremer, Laura Walker, and Mary Wayte.[10][12] She also earned a silver medal for swimming the freestyle leg of the 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay for the second-place U.S. team in the preliminary heats, but not the final.[10] Individually, Torres also placed seventh in the final of the 100-meter freestyle event.[10]\n\nTorres qualified for the U.S. Olympic women's team in a single event for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. She swam the second leg of the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay for the winning U.S. team that included Nicole Haislett, Angel Martino, and Jenny Thompson, and earned a gold medal for her efforts in the event final and first-round qualifying heat.[10][13]\n\nFirst comeback: 2000 Olympics After seven years out of competitive swimming, Torres began to train for an Olympic comeback in 1999 under the guidance of coach Richard Quick.[14] She won five medals at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, but saved her best for two of the major relay events of the U.S. Olympic women's team.[10][15] She swam the second leg for the winning U.S. women's team in final of the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay that included Amy Van Dyken, Courtney Shealy, and Jenny Thompson.[15] Torres won a second gold medal for anchoring the winning U.S. team in the 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay, together with teammates B.J. Bedford, Megan Quann, and Jenny Thompson in the final.[15] Individually, Torres also earned bronze medals \u2013 her first Olympic medals in individual events \u2013 in each of the 50-meter freestyle, the 100-meter butterfly and the 100-meter freestyle,[10][15] tying teammate and rival Jenny Thompson for third place in the last event.[16][17] At 33 years old, Torres became the oldest woman to win an Olympic medal in swimming.[18] She was the oldest member of the U.S. Olympic swim team, but won more medals (five) than any other U.S. team member.[19][20]\n\nSecond comeback: 2008 Olympics\n\nTorres at the Missouri Grand Prix in 2008 On August 1, 2007, at age 40 and just 16 months after giving birth to her first child, Torres won the 100-meter freestyle at the U.S. Nationals in Indianapolis.[21] On August 4, she set a new American record in the 50-meter freestyle of 24.53 seconds, breaking her own record of 24.63 seconds set at the 2000 Summer Olympics.[22] She lowered her initial American record by 1.62 seconds. Torres has broken or lowered her own American record in the 50-meter freestyle 10 times, which is the most by any American swimmer in any event.[23]\n\nAt the 2008 U.S. Olympic Trials, Torres returned to the pool and qualified for a spot in her fifth Olympic Games at the age of 41, a first for an American female swimmer.[24] She became the oldest U.S. Olympic swimmer in history and the first American swimmer to appear in five Olympic Games.[14]\n\nAt the trials, she qualified for the event finals in the 50-meter freestyle and broke the American record with a time of 24.38 seconds in the semifinal.[25] In the 50-meter finals, she broke that record for the ninth time, setting it at 24.25 seconds and winning the top American women's spot in the event.[26] Torres also qualified in the 100-meter freestyle,[27] but later withdrew from the individual 100-meter freestyle event to focus her efforts on the 50-meter freestyle and 4\u00d7100-meter relay events.[28] On July 30, at the U.S. swim team's final training in Singapore, Torres, Amanda Beard, and Natalie Coughlin were elected captains of the U.S. Olympic women's swimming team.[29]\n\nIn order to pre-empt any speculation that she might be taking performance-enhancing drugs, Torres volunteered for a new enhanced drug-testing program by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.[30] \"I want to be an open book\", she said. \"I want people to know that I'm 41, and I'm doing this right. I'm clean.\"[31] In addition to employing her training team of coach Michael Lohberg, a sprint coach, a chiropractor, and two masseuses, Torres used resistance-stretching trainers, calling it her \"secret weapon\" for continued success.[14][32] Her $100,000-per-year training costs were partially subsidized by her corporate sponsors Speedo, Toyota, and Bloomberg L.P.[14]\n\n\"I think this performance ranks up there with the biggest performances in sports ever ... It puts Dara in the ranks of Michael Phelps, Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods. What she has done is really not measurable.\" Michael Lohberg, Torres' coach, discussing her winning three Olympic silver medals at the age of 41.[33]\n\nAt the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Torres won a silver medal as the anchor swimmer of the second-place U.S. team in the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay.[10] It was the fifth time in five tries she earned an Olympic medal in the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay.[10] With the American relay team's second-place finish, she became the oldest swimmer to win a medal in Olympic history, surpassing British swimmer William Robinson, who was 38 at the time of the 1908 Summer Olympics.[34]\n\nOn August 17, 2008, she won the silver medal in the 50-meter freestyle, finishing in a new American record time of 24.07 seconds, one one-hundredth (0.01) of a second behind the winner, Britta Steffen.[35] Her second-place time was a new American record, and 0.18 of a second faster than she swam at the U.S. Olympic Trials.[35] Thirty-five minutes later, she won another silver medal swimming the freestyle anchor leg for the second-place U.S. team in the 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay.[36] Her split on the 4\u00d7100 medley relay (52.27 seconds) was the fastest 100-meter freestyle split in relay history.[36] The American record for the women's 100-meter freestyle as an individual event was 53.39 seconds as of August 2008, making Torres' time more than a full second faster.[36]\n\nTorres' 12 Olympic medals tied the all-time medal record for a female Olympic swimmer set by fellow American Jenny Thompson in 2004; American Natalie Coughlin subsequently equaled the record in 2012.[37]\n\nAftermath and retirement At the U.S. National Championships in 2009, Torres won the 50-meter freestyle with the fourth-best time in the world for the year (24.42), and she also placed in the 50-meter butterfly, qualifying her to compete in those events at the 2009 World Championships.[38] This was the first time since 1986 that Torres competed in the World Championships; she placed eighth in the 50-meter freestyle and she did not advance beyond the qualifying heats in the 50-meter butterfly.[citation needed]\n\nFollowing reconstructive surgery of one of her knees, she began training with the goal of competing in the 2012 Summer Olympics.[39] At the 2012 United States Olympic Trials, she placed fourth in the finals of the 50-meter freestyle, 0.32 of a second behind the winner, Jessica Hardy, and 0.09 of a second behind the second qualifier, Kara Lynn Joyce.[40][41] Only the top-two finishers in each trials event qualified for the 2012 U.S. Olympic team, and as a result, Torres concluded her Olympic career.[40] After the 2012 Trials, Torres announced her retirement from competitive swimming, concluding her career with 12 Olympic medals.[41] Her Olympic career spanned 24 years from 1984 to 2008 and five Olympic Games (1984, 1988, 1992, 2000, 2008).[10]\n\nLife outside swimming\n\nTorres in the 2010 Heart Truth fashion show Torres has worked in television as a reporter and announcer for American networks NBC, ESPN, TNT, OLN, and Fox News Channel, and hosted the golf show, The Clubhouse on the Resort Sports Network.[42] She has also worked as a model, and was the first elite swimmer to model swimwear in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, appearing in the 1994 edition.[32] She was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2005.[43]\n\nAfter 1992, she married and subsequently divorced sports producer Jeff Gowen.[2] After 2000, she converted to Judaism fully (she was already half Jewish) before marrying the Israeli surgeon Itzhak Shasha (her own father had been Jewish).[2] Torres and Shasha later divorced.[2] Torres and reproductive endocrinologist David Hoffman began dating after her break-up with Shasha, and they became the parents of Tessa Grace Torres-Hoffman, born in 2006.[14] After the birth of their daughter, Hoffman, a masters swimmer, persuaded her to begin training again.[28]\n\nTorres is a veteran celebrity swimmer for Swim Across America, a charitable organization that raises funds for cancer research in which she has participated for several years.[44] She is the author of two books: Age is Just a Number: Achieve Your Dreams at Any Stage in Your Life (with Elizabeth Weil), and Gold Medal Fitness: A Revolutionary 5-Week Program (with Billie Fitzpatrick).[45]\n\nTorres is also involved with the American chapter of the foundation of Princess Charlene of Monaco, a charitable organization at which she sits, as Vice-President, on the board of directors.[46]\n\nWorld records Women's 50-meter freestyle\n\nTime Date Event Location 25.69 January 29, 1983 Speedo International swim meet Amersfoort, Netherlands[3] 25.62 August 5, 1983 U.S. national championships Clovis, California[3] 25.61 July 21, 1984 Pre-Olympic swim meet Mission Viejo, California[47] Women's 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay\n\nTime Date Event Location 3:39.46 July 28, 1992 1992 Summer Olympics Barcelona, Spain[citation needed] 3:36.61 September 16, 2000 2000 Summer Olympics Sydney, Australia[citation needed] Women's 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay\n\nTime Date Event Location 3:58.30 September 23, 2000 2000 Summer Olympics Sydney, Australia[48]"}, {"url": "https://deadorkicking.com/dara-torres-dead-or-alive/", "page_content": "How Old Is Dara Torres?

However, not all Olympic swimmers come out of the womb with a swim cap attached to their heads. Some athletes take time to acquire the passion and motivation to compete at such a strenuous level. In fact, some Olympians earned their gold medals well into their late 30s!\n\nHere are a few examples of USA swimming team gold medalists that didn\u2019t let age get in the way.\n\nDara Torres\n\nOne of the greatest female athletes, Dara Grace Torres is a competitive swimmer and four-time Olympic gold medalist. According to the Olympics\u2019 official website, at 41, she became the \u201celdest ever female Olympic swimmer.\u201c Her swimming career started in 1984 at 17, and later ventured off as a Sports Illustrated model and commercial spokeswoman. After taking a break, she decided to jump back into the Olympic games.\n\nBeing an older competitor never hindered her chances of obtaining multiple medals. She swam back into the industry full force as a United States flag carrier with nearly a 25-year span from age 17 to 41.\n\nAnthony Ervin\n\nAge is nothing but a number when it comes to the USA national team. According to Swimming World Magazine, \u201cErvin became the oldest man to ever win an individual Olympic gold medal in swimming, and the only swimmer ever to win gold medals in the same individual event 16 years apart.\u201d\n\nErvin failed to qualify for the final round of the 50-meter freestyle in the 2000 FINA World Championships. Sixteen years later, he revisited the same event and was able to walk home with the gold. After shockingly taking an early retirement at 22, Anthony Ervin broke the record for winning an Olympic gold medal in swimming at 35!\n\nHere\u2019s yet another professional swimmer that didn\u2019t let his age define his skill level. Ervin never underestimated his abilities but instead switched the narrative to reach his peak at 35 years old.\n\nRowdy Gaines\n\nOlympic three-time gold medalist, Rowdy Gaines, started swimming competitively at 17. This might seem like a normal age, but for professional swimmers, 17 is a significantly late start. Some athletes start their OLYMPIC careers at that age. Despite a comparatively late start in his career, his skills were still able to outshine most of his competitors.\n\nTwo years later, Gaines received a scholarship to play for Auburn University. Throughout his speedy career, he has broken 11 world records and is known as \u201cSwimming\u2019s Greatest Ambassador\u201d for Team USA. According to Team USA, \u201che was the oldest swimmer to qualify for the 1996 Olympic Trials at 35.\u201d\n\nProof That You Should Never Give Up\n\nDara Torres, Anthony Ervin, and Rowdy Gaines all did something incredible. Not only did they prove to themselves that they could become some of the greatest athletes in competitive swimming at an older age, but they proved to the world that such a feat was possible to begin with. These athletes are living, breathing inspirations for anyone who might feel as if they missed their chance to compete.\n\nIf you happen to be one of those people, look to these Olympic athletes and use them as your inspiration. They\u2019ve proven that competing against teenagers and young adults in their early 20s isn\u2019t an impossible feat. It\u2019ll be a tough road filled with daily training, strict dieting, and hours of constructive yelling from a swimming coach before you can start winning those medals, but take strength in knowing that it\u2019s not wasted effort!\n\nNow get out there and start training!"}, {"url": "https://evesweekly.com/bio/sports-stars/dara-torres/", "page_content": "Dara Grace Torres is an American former competitive swimmer, who is a 12-time Olympic medalist and former world record-holder in three events.

She added a silver and bronze in relays in 1988, and seemingly ended her swimming career with another gold in the 4\u00d7100 free relay in 1992. Tall and strikingly attractive, Torres then began a career as a model, becoming the first athlete to appear in Sports Illustrated\u2019s swimsuit issue.

After giving birth to her daughter, Tessa Grace, in April 2006, she entered two Masters meets and posted times that emboldened her to try another comeback. She asked Coral Springs coach Michael Lohberg if he would coach her, and a little over a year later, she won the 100-meter freestyle at the U.S. Nationals in Indianapolis. Three days later, she broke the American record in the 50-meter freestyle for the tenth time - an amazing 24 years after setting it for the very first time. In 2008, Dara qualified for her fifth Olympic team and at the 2008 Beijing Games, she became the oldest swimmer to compete in the Olympics.

With the American relay team's second-place finish, she became the oldest swimmer to win a medal in Olympic history, surpassing British swimmer William Robinson, who was 38 at the time of the 1908 Summer Olympics.\n\nOn August 17, 2008, she won the silver medal in the 50-meter freestyle, finishing in a new American record time of 24.07 seconds, one one-hundredth (0.01) of a second behind the winner, Britta Steffen. Her second-place time was a new American record, and 0.18 of a second faster than she swam at the U.S. Olympic Trials. Thirty-five minutes later, she won another silver medal swimming the freestyle anchor leg for the second-place U.S. team in the 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay. Her split on the 4\u00d7100 medley relay (52.27 seconds) was the fastest 100-meter freestyle split in relay history. The American record for the women's 100-meter freestyle as an individual event was 53.39 seconds as of August 2008, making Torres's time more than a full second faster.\n\nTorres's 12 Olympic medals tied the all-time medal record for a female Olympic swimmer set by fellow American Jenny Thompson in 2004; American Natalie Coughlin subsequently equaled the record in 2012.\n\nAftermath and retirement\n\nAt the U.S. National Championships in 2009, Torres won the 50-meter freestyle with the fourth-best time in the world for the year (24.42), and she also placed in the 50-meter butterfly, qualifying her to compete in those events at the 2009 World Championships. This was the first time since 1986 that Torres competed in the World Championships; she placed eighth in the 50-meter freestyle and she did not advance beyond the qualifying heats in the 50-meter butterfly.\n\nFollowing reconstructive surgery of one of her knees, she began training with the goal of competing in the 2012 Summer Olympics. At the 2012 United States Olympic Trials, she placed fourth in the finals of the 50-meter freestyle, 0.32 of a second behind the winner, Jessica Hardy, and 0.09 of a second behind the second qualifier, Kara Lynn Joyce. Only the top-two finishers in each trials event qualified for the 2012 U.S. Olympic team, and as a result, Torres concluded her Olympic career. After the 2012 Trials, Torres announced her retirement from competitive swimming, concluding her career with 12 Olympic medals. Her Olympic career spanned 24 years from 1984 to 2008 and five Olympic Games (1984, 1988, 1992, 2000, 2008).\n\nIn 2004 she was inducted into the Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nLife outside swimming\n\nTorres in the 2010 Heart Truth fashion show\n\nTorres has worked in television as a reporter and announcer for American networks NBC, ESPN, TNT, OLN, and Fox News Channel, and hosted the golf show, The Clubhouse on the Resort Sports Network. She has also worked as a model, and was the first elite swimmer to model swimwear in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, appearing in the 1994 edition. She was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2005.\n\nAfter 1992, she married and subsequently divorced sports producer Jeff Gowen. After 2000, she converted to Judaism fully (she was already half Jewish through her father) before marrying the Israeli surgeon Itzhak Shasha. Torres and Shasha later divorced. Torres and reproductive endocrinologist David Hoffman began dating after her break-up with Shasha, and they became the parents of Tessa Grace Torres-Hoffman, born in 2006. After the birth of their daughter, Hoffman, a masters swimmer, persuaded her to begin training again.\n\nTorres is a veteran celebrity swimmer for Swim Across America, a charitable organization that raises funds for cancer research in which she has participated for several years.

As of 2014, she is also the most decorated Jewish Olympian in history.\n\nTorres (born April 15, 1967) was born in Beverly Hills, California and she grew up in Los Angeles as with five siblings. Her father, Edward Torres, was Jewish, and Torres herself converted to Judaism before marrying her second husband. At age 7, Torres started following her brothers to swim practice at the local YMCA and later joined the Culver City swim team. She later attended the Westlake School for Girls (now Harvard-Westlake School) swimming under coach Darlene Bible, where she set CIF records that still remain to this day.\n\nStill in high school, Torres won a spot in her first Olympics - the 1984 Los Angeles Games - where she was a member of the winning U.S. women's 4x100-meter relay team, earning a gold medal for swimming in the first-round qualifying heat as well the event final.\n\nTwo years later, she accepted a scholarship to attend the University of Florida. Torres would swim for the Gators for four years, winning three NCAA individual national championships (50-meter freestyle, 100-meter freestyle, 100-meter butterfly), was a member of six NCAA championship relay teams, and received 28 All-American honors.\n\nShe would continue to swim in the Olympics for Team USA, competing and medaling in events at the 1988 Seoul Games and the 1992 Barcelona Games. In 2000, Torres made her first comeback to the US Team, at 33 years old she was the eldest member of the swim team, and won five medals - two gold and two silver - at the Sydney Games. Torres is featured in the book Gold in the Water by P.H. Mullen, which describes her comeback for the 2000 Olympics under coaches Richard Quick and Dick Jochums.\n\nIn 2005, Torres was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nOn August 1, 2007, at the age of 40 (just 15 months after giving birth to her first child), she won gold in the 100 meter freestyle at the U.S. Nationals in Indianapolis, her 14th win at the event. She then followed that up on August 4 by twice breaking her own American record in the 50 m freestyle, 26 years after she first set the American record at just 15 years old.\n\nAt age 41, Dara Torres returned to the pool to obtain a spot in her fifth Olympic games - the 2008 Beijing Games - an unprecedented accomplishment for an American female swimmer. Qualifying for the Games, Torres became the oldest swimmer in American Olympic history and also the first female in history to swim in the Olympics past age 40. Torres won a silver medal in Beijing as the anchor swimmer of the U.S. 4x100-meter freestyle relay. This was the fifth time in five tries she has earned an Olympic medal in that event.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Shalom Life; International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame; Jewish Journal"}]}
