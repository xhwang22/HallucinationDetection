[Photo provided to China Daily]\n\nAfter the hiatus caused by the pandemic rock groups are again taking to the stage in front of appreciative audiences\n\nChinese indie rock band Miserable Faith gave an online concert on May 15, 2020. In itself, not that unusual. After all that is what rock bands do, right? Except this was their first show since the COVID-19 pandemic hit and the location was something special. It had been kept a secret until leading vocalist Gao Hu revealed it that night.\n\n\"The Yangtze River is right behind us. We are performing in Wuhan,\" Gao said to about 400,000 people who watched the online concert. Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province, was the hardest stricken city when the pandemic hit.\n\n\"It was a very emotional moment for all of us. Though we didn't know when live music could come back to normal at that time, we were still full of hope and excitement about giving the virtual concert,\" recalled Gao.\n\nAs people embrace the return of their usual daily life and the trappings of normality, restaurants, shopping malls, transportation, delivery services and theaters, thanks to the government quickly bringing the pandemic under control, Gao, along with his band members-guitarist Song Jie, bassist Zhang Jing and drummer Chi Gongwei-are on the road again touring 24 cities. They returned to Wuhan on May 1 to perform during the Strawberry Music Festival.\n\n\"With my eyes closed, I love listening to the sounds of audiences at an outdoor music festival,\" says Gao. \"The air, the wind, the noise of the crowds and the music, everything makes the moment of attending an outdoor music festival meaningful. It's about people getting together and sharing great music. I am so happy and grateful that we have made it happen again.\"\n\nAs one of the largest outdoor music festivals in the country, the Strawberry Music Festival, launched by Chinese recording company Modern Sky in 2010, has returned during the May Day holiday. It covers four cities: Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Nanjing of Jiangsu province.\n\nFrom May 2 to 4, Strawberry Music Festival is being held at Beijing Expo Park, which has 51 groups of bands and musicians perform at three stages. Pu Shu, Escape Plan, Miserable Faith and Queen Sea Big Shark, some of the bestselling rock bands and singer-songwriters are featured in the festival.\n\nOn May 1 and 2, 34 Chinese rock bands and indie musicians, headlined by Miserable Faith, Big Wave, Dada and Chen Li, performed during the Strawberry Music Festival in Wuhan Garden Expo Park. On May 3 and 4, the music festival is being held in Nanjing's Fangshan Music Valley, featuring similar lineups. On May 1 and 2, Strawberry Seeds Music Festival, another outdoor music festival brand by Modern Sky, which appeals to families, especially child audiences, was held at Agile Clearwater Bay, a beach resort in Hainan. From May 1 to 3, more than 50 bands perform during the festival in Shanghai's Oriental Land.\n\n\"It's been a long time since Strawberry Music Festival comes to Beijing and though it's a two-hour drive from downtown capital, I will go with my friends,\" says a fan leaving a message on Modern Sky's social media platform after the company announced the lineups of the Strawberry Music Festival in Beijing on April 19. \"I cannot wait to dance to the music and spend a great day with my friends.\"\n\nLast year, when COVID-19 hit, Modern Sky had to cancel all of its performances in the first half of 2020, including 50 outdoor music festivals. Modern Sky then launched online programs, either singer-songwriters performing from their bedrooms or bands playing acoustic versions of their hits, to keep in touch with their fans. From February to May, 2020, more than 30 online shows were held, which gathered 270 musicians and bands and attracted in excess of 42 million people, according to Shen Lihui, founder of Modern Sky.\n\nThe former rock singer-songwriter of Chinese rock band, Sober, Shen founded the music company in 1997, hoping to use it as a way to distribute the music of his friends and his own band. More than two decades later, the company has expanded into an international label with hundreds of staff members, and is home to over 300 artists and bands. It has offices in New York, London and Berlin, besides its headquarters in Beijing.\n\nThe Strawberry Music Festival has been held in 29 Chinese cities, and attracted more than 6 million people. Most, 86 percent, of them are people born after 1990.\n\nModern Sky held nine outdoor music festivals across the country from October to December 2020, which drew 160,000 people.\n\n\"The first priority is the health of the audience, so we have mapped out plans, such as limiting the number attending, temperature checks and disinfection measures. For the fans, it is a long-awaited holiday for outdoor music festival,\" says Zhang Chongshuo, vice-president of Modern Sky. \"Many bands and indie musicians have restarted their music projects, which were postponed due to the pandemic, which is very exciting.\"\n\nBesides the May Day holiday, Modern Sky has also made plans for this summer's outdoor events. On May 29 and 30, the festival was held in Chengdu. On June 12 and 13, Strawberry Seeds Music Festival will be held in Changsha, Hunan province, with the two-day event gathering 34 Chinese rock bands and indie musicians headlined by Miserable Faith, New Pants and Jiulian Zhenren.\n\nApart from the Strawberry Music Festival, the Midi Music Festival was held in three Chinese cities: Jinan and Binzhou, two cities in Shandong province, and Chengdu, Sichuan province, from April 30 to May 2.\n\nAbout 50 indie rock bands and musicians performed during the Midi Music Festival in Shandong, including rock singer-songwriter Xu Wei, rock bands Carsick Cars and Joyside. At least 34 bands and indie musicians performed in Chengdu.\n\nIn its 21st year, the Midi Music Festival was born in the Beijing-based Midi School of Music, the nation's first contemporary music school. The first festival took place at the Midi School of Music featuring students from the school. During the past two decades, the festival has been staged more than 40 times across the country. Known as \"China's Woodstock\", a reference to the legendary music festival in the United States in 1969, it has propelled many rock bands to fame. Nearly all the country's rock stars have performed at the event, including Cui Jian and Tang Dynasty, one of the first Chinese heavy metal bands.\n\n\"The pandemic was a major blow to indie musicians since touring and performing at outdoor music festivals plays a big part in their lives,\" says Shan Wei, director of Midi Music Festival. \"For the fans, who enjoy going to outdoor music festivals, it was also a great disappointment since all live entertainment was seen on a digital screen. Now we are bringing the outdoor music back.\"\n\nThe pandemic has caused musicians and bands to change their plans. One of them is Chinese folk singer Gong Linna, who, during the days without touring, focused on preparing for her new album. Titled Mountain and Sea, the new album was released on March 8, featuring ten songs written by her German husband, songwriter Robert Zollitsch, which were inspired by Shan Hai Jing, or The Classic of Mountains and Seas, a 2,000-year-old collection of mythic geography, animals and folklore.\n\nThe singer will tour nationwide in support of the new album, including concerts in Shanghai on May 29, in Changsha, Hunan province on June 25 and Beijing on July 29.\n\n\"We could not be certain of an immediate return to the theater when our schedules were disturbed by the pandemic, but we were definitely excited about making a new album and looking at every option to return to the stage as soon as we can,\" says Gong. \"It's not just for Chinese artists but for artists from around the world. When the theaters reopened, that was great news-the moment we've been waiting for.\"\n\n\"We can feel the warm feedback of the audience who have anticipated live shows,\" says Ilchi, founder and a member of Hanggai, a Chinese rock band formed by ethnic Mongolian musicians in Beijing in 2004. Hanggai, the Mongolian term for a place with beautiful pastures, mountains and rivers, is known for tapping into the roots of Mongolian folk music whilst integrating them with contemporary rock music. They've appeared in international music festivals, such as Fuji Rock in Japan and Roskilde Festival in Denmark.\n\nThe band launched a 42-city tour last year, which ended with two performances in Beijing on Dec 4 and 5.\n\nIn March, they performed at the Blue Note Beijing and on April 18 they performed during an outdoor music festival in Shandong province.\n\n\"The live music scene is gradually back with live house venues packed with people again and the return of outdoor music events. We have a hectic schedule again. It's a great pleasure for bands, and giving live performances is a huge part of our lives,\" Ilchi says. The band, he adds, will perform during the Montreux Jazz Festival, one of the world's biggest and longest-running jazz festivals since 1967, which will have its first edition in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, from Oct 5 to 8, 2021.\n\n\"It's true that people are embracing the return of outdoor music events. Amid the pandemic, we've implemented necessary safety precautions and followed local health guidelines while preparing for the music festival,\" says Cao Kai, organizer of the outdoor music festival, which was held on April 17 and 18 at Yin Jia Yu Pastoral Complex, an outdoor resort located in Yishui county, Linyi city, Shandong province. In its first year, the two-day outdoor music festival attracted about 10,000 people and 12 Chinese rock bands and musicians, including Hanggai, The Face, and singer-songwriter Laolang."}, {"url": "https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202202/14/WS62099b81a310cdd39bc86531.html", "page_content": "By Hui Ming | China Daily | Updated: 2022-02-14 07:59\n\nJIN DING/CHINA DAILY\n\nEditor's note: As Valentine's Day is being celebrated on Monday and Lantern Festival will be celebrated on Tuesday, three scholars share their views on the festivals with China Daily.\n\nDo you prefer to celebrate Valentine's Day, which falls on Monday, or Lantern Festival which falls on Tuesday?\n\nMany young people may ask, \"Why not both\"?\n\nFestivals are social events people have enjoyed since ancient times, when people around the world held ritual activities in groups to worship their ancestors, pray for good fortune or celebrate the harvest. In olden days, festivals were events celebrated by a community.\n\nFestivals arise from our ancestors' marking of seasonal changes and astronomical phenomena associated with religious beliefs. In earlier times festival activities would always be regarded as having great significance. Later, festivals often became characterized by carnivals in which some of the original significance was lost as people gathered together to enjoy a good time.\n\nSince industrialization ushered much of the world into the modern era, festivals have gradually served to fulfill more secular, social and recreational purposes, and are less closely linked with the forces that our ancestors believed shaped people's daily lives and fortunes.\n\nNowadays, among the festivals celebrated in China are specific days that honor particular social groups or professions, such as the National Day, Teachers' Day and Women's Day, and the time-honored festivals, such as Spring Festival, Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival, whose origins can be traced back thousands of years ago and which are now celebrated as national holidays.\n\nThere are other festivals that people celebrate to varying degrees such as Qixi, which is the Chinese Valentine's Day, and the Chongyang or Double Ninth Festival, the longevity festival, as well as many regional ethnic group festivals.\n\nAll these festivals break up the daily routine and inject vitality into people's lives.\n\nIn modern times, some Western festivals, such as Christmas, Valentine's Day, Halloween, Mother's Day and Father's Day, although not public holidays, are enjoyed by young people and have become \"new celebrations\" in Chinese society.\n\nActually, Christmas in China is more of a day for fun, friendship and fondness than a religious celebration. Shopping malls and entertainment facilities in the big cities are filled with Christmas elements, such as fir trees, Santa Claus and carols, while Halloween is celebrated by youthful party-goers who like to wear fancy costumes for the occasion.\n\nBut in general, Valentine's Day, Mother's Day and Father's Day are the most popular Western festivals in China.\n\nValentine's Day, which is closely linked with fashion and consumerism, is widely celebrated by young people in urban areas. They have adopted the traditional Western ways of celebrating the day, with couples enjoying a romantic dinner and exchanging gifts, such as flowers, chocolates and jewelry. Valentine's Day always gives a boost to such consumption.\n\nBesides, Mother's Day and Father's Day are accepted by the whole society because of China's culture of filial piety. Many Chinese people take this opportunity to show their gratitude to their parents by sending gifts or having a meal together.\n\nThe cultural exchanges between China and the rest of the world help many Chinese accept foreign festivals, which in turn enrich their daily lives. Meanwhile, the introduction and acceptance of foreign festivals reveal the inclusiveness and vitality of Chinese civilization.\n\nHowever, while recognizing the positive contributions these adopted foreign festivals make to cultural exchanges between China and other countries, it should be recognized that the values of these foreign festivals may be different from those embodied in traditional Chinese culture.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the authorities can play a role by strengthening the preservation and promotion of China's traditional festivals and preventing the commercial opportunities presented by Western festivals from giving them undue importance.\n\nChinese traditional festivals are reflections of the traditional culture and values in the modern era. The country should not let young people forget the traditional values they celebrate.\n\nCompared with foreign festivals, Chinese festivals focus more on the family and are characterized by the different generations of a family celebrating them together.\n\nTake Spring Festival, the most important festival in China, which fell on Feb 1 this year. The festival is associated with several customs. During the seven-day holiday, people gather for an annual family reunion dinner, thoroughly clean their houses, and decorate windows and doors with red paper-cuts and couplets that display the charm of traditional culture.\n\nAccording to official data, more than 90 million passenger trips were made on China's railways from Jan 17 to Feb 2, the first 17 days of the Spring Festival travel rush this year. Actually, the festival led to billions of passenger journeys every year before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nTraditional culture is a key element that can help finally realize the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation. It is quite important for the country to boost its traditional festivals and culture, enhance international cultural communication and improve cultural attractiveness.\n\nThe views don't necessarily represent those of China Daily.\n\nThe author is a researcher at the China National Center for Cultural Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences."}, {"url": "https://zy.21cnjy.com/11612131", "page_content": "\u8d44\u6e90\u7b80\u4ecb\n\n\u9ad8\u4e09\u82f1\u8bed\u65b0\u4eba\u6559\u5fc5\u4fee\u4e09Unit 1\u8bfe\u6587\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff08\u82f1\u6c49\u5bf9\u7167\uff09\n\nWHY DO WE CELEBRATE FESTIVALS\n\n\u6211\u4eec\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5e86\u795d\u8282\u65e5\uff1f\n\nFestivals are celebrated all around the world. They have a wide range of origins, such as the seasons of the year, religions, famous figures, and important events. Every festival has its different customs and unique charms. However, no matter how different they may seem, all over the world, the spirit of sharing joy, gratitude, love, or peace is common in all festivals.\n\n\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u5730\u90fd\u5e86\u795d\u5404\u79cd\u8282\u65e5\u3002\u8282\u65e5\u7684\u7531\u6765\u4e94\u82b1\u516b\u95e8\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u65f6\u8282\u3001\u5b97\u6559\u3001\u8457\u540d\u4eba\u7269\u53ca\u91cd\u8981\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u65e5\u90fd\u6709\u5176\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4e60\u4fd7\u548c\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u9b45\u529b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u5b83\u4eec\u591a\u4e48\u8fe5\u5f02\uff0c\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u5730\uff0c\u5206\u4eab\u5feb\u4e50\u3001\u611f\u6069\u3001\u53cb\u7231\u6216\u548c\u5e73\u7684\u7cbe\u795e\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u8282\u65e5\u4e4b\u4e2d\u3002\n\nOf all the traditional festivals, the harvest festival can be found in almost every culture. This important agricultural festival takes place after all the crops have been gathered in. People celebrate to show that they are grateful for the year\u2019s supply of food. In ancient Egypt, the harvest festival was celebrated during the springtime\u2014the Egyptian harvest season. It featured a parade and a great feast with music, dancing, and sports. Today, in some European countries, people decorate churches and town halls with flowers and fruit, and get together to celebrate over a meal. During the Mid-Autumn Festival in China, families gather to admire the shining moon and enjoy delicious mooncakes.\n\n\u5728\u6240\u6709\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u8282\u65e5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e30\u6536\u8282\u51e0\u4e4e\u53ef\u89c1\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e00\u79cd\u6587\u5316\u4e4b\u4e2d\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u91cd\u5927\u7684\u519c\u4e1a\u8282\u65e5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u519c\u4f5c\u7269\u6536\u6210\u540e\u6765\u4e34\u3002\u4eba\u4eec\u4e3e\u884c\u5e86\u795d\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u5e74\u6536\u83b7\u7684\u98df\u7269\u8868\u8fbe\u611f\u6069\u3002\u5728\u53e4\u57c3\u53ca\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u4e8e\u6625\u5b63\u5e86\u795d\u4e30\u6536\u8282\u2014\u2014\u5373\u57c3\u53ca\u7684\u4e30\u6536\u5b63\u3002\u5e86\u795d\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u6e38\u884c\u548c\u4e30\u76db\u7684\u7b75\u5e2d\uff0c\u8f7d\u6b4c\u8f7d\u821e\uff0c\u5e76\u4f34\u6709\u4f53\u80b2\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\u5982\u4eca\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u6b27\u6d32\u56fd\u5bb6\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u7528\u9c9c\u82b1\u548c\u6c34\u679c\u6765\u88c5\u9970\u6559\u5802\u548c\u5e02\u653f\u5385\uff0c\u805a\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\u5171\u4eab\u5927\u9910\uff0c\u4ee5\u793a\u5e86\u795d\u3002\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\u4e2d\u79cb\u8282\uff0c\u5bb6\u5bb6\u6237\u6237\u6b22\u805a\u4e00\u5802\uff0c\u89c2\u8d4f\u660e\u6708\uff0c\u54c1\u5c1d\u7f8e\u5473\u7684\u6708\u997c\u3002\n\nCustoms play a significant role in festivals, but sometimes they can change over time. With the development of modern society and the spread of new ideas, some traditions may fade away and others may be established. One example is the typical Chinese Spring Festival custom of lighting firecrackers to drive away the evil spirits and celebrate the new year. Nowadays, many big cities have given up this custom in order to avoid air pollution. Another example is Halloween, which slowly became an exciting festival for children, in spite of its religious origins.\n\n\u98ce\u4fd7\u5728\u8282\u65e5\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u91cd\u8981\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u65f6\u4e5f\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u800c\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u968f\u7740\u73b0\u4ee3\u793e\u4f1a\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u65b0\u601d\u60f3\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u6709\u4e9b\u4f20\u7edf\u4f1a\u6e10\u6e10\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u800c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e9b\u4f20\u7edf\u5219\u5f97\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u3002\u4e2d\u56fd\u6625\u8282\u71c3\u653e\u97ad\u70ae\u4ee5\u9a71\u9b3c\u795e\u3001\u8d3a\u65b0\u5e74\u8fd9\u4e00\u5178\u578b\u98ce\u4fd7\u5c31\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f8b\u5b50\u3002\u5982\u4eca\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u907f\u514d\u7a7a\u6c14\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u5927\u57ce\u5e02\u5df2\u7ecf\u6452\u5f03\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u98ce\u4fd7\u3002\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f8b\u5b50\u662f\u4e07\u5723\u8282\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u8d77\u6e90\u4e8e\u5b97\u6559\uff0c\u4e07\u5723\u8282\u6e10\u6e10\u6210\u4e86\u5b69\u5b50\u4eec\u7eb5\u60c5\u73a9\u4e50\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u8282\u65e5\u3002\n\nFestivals are becoming more and more commercial, with businesses taking advantage of the celebrations. Online shopping websites and social media apps have made it much easier for the public to spend more on gifts for their loved ones. Although some believe festivals should not be commercialised, others believe the increase in spending is good for the economy and public happiness.\n\n\u8282\u65e5\u6b63\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u5546\u4e1a\u5316\uff0c\u5546\u5bb6\u4f1a\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e86\u795d\u6d3b\u52a8\uff08\u8fdb\u884c\u4fc3\u9500\uff09\u3002\u8d2d\u7269\u7f51\u7ad9\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6781\u5927\u5730\u65b9\u4fbf\u4e86\u4eba\u4eec\u4e3a\u81f3\u4eb2\u81f3\u7231\u82b1\u66f4\u591a\u94b1\u8d2d\u4e70\u793c\u7269\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6709\u4eba\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8282\u65e5\u4e0d\u5e94\u8be5\u88ab\u5546\u4e1a\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4e5f\u6709\u4eba\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6d88\u8d39\u589e\u957f\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\uff08\u63d0\u9ad8\uff09\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u516c\u4f17\u5e78\u798f\u611f\u3002\n\nFestivals are an important part of society.

They help us understand where we came from, who we are, and what to appreciate.

Mongolian wrestling is different from the wrestling in the Olympic Games. There are no rounds, and wrestlers are not separated by weight. The wrestlers loses if any part of his body above his knee touches the ground.

In fact, an art movement called the \u201cMission School\u201d started here. It\u2019s influenced by graffiti art and comic art. I walked around looking at the street art for a few hours.

I learnt that America got California from Mexico in 1848. In the same year, gold was discovered near San Francisco, which started a gold rush. Over 300,000 people came from all over the world to seek their fortune, and San Francisco quickly became a big city. Many Chinese arrived during this period. To earn a living, some opened up shops and restaurants in Chinatown. Many others found jobs on farms, joined the gold rush, or went to build the railway that joined California to the eastern region of the country. The museum did a really good job of showing how America was built by immigrants from different countries and cultures. When these immigrants left their countries, they carried a bit of home in their hearts, and built a new home here.\n\n\u4e0b\u5348\uff0c\u6211\u524d\u5f80\u5f53\u5730\u4e00\u5bb6\u535a\u7269\u9986\u53c2\u89c2\uff0c\u535a\u7269\u9986\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u52a0\u5229\u798f\u5c3c\u4e9a\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u53d8\u8fc1\u3002\u6211\u4e86\u89e3\u5230\uff0c1948\u5e74\u7f8e\u56fd\u4ece\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u624b\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u52a0\u5229\u798f\u5c3c\u4e9a\u3002\u540c\u5e74\uff0c\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71\u9644\u8fd1\u53d1\u73b0\u9ec4\u91d1\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u6dd8\u91d1\u70ed\u3002\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u573030\u591a\u4e07\u4eba\u8702\u62e5\u800c\u81f3\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\u8c0b\u51fa\u8def\uff0c\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71\u8fc5\u901f\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u5ea7\u5927\u90fd\u5e02\u3002\u5f88\u591a\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u4e5f\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u65f6\u671f\u6765\u5230\u6b64\u5730\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u8c0b\u751f\uff0c\u6709\u4e9b\u4eba\u5728\u5510\u4eba\u8857\u5f00\u5546\u5e97\u3001\u5f00\u9910\u9986\u3002\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u4eba\u5219\u5728\u519c\u573a\u6253\u5de5\u3001\u52a0\u5165\u6dd8\u91d1\u5927\u519b\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u53c2\u4e0e\u4fee\u5efa\u52a0\u5dde\u901a\u5f80\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e1c\u90e8\u7684\u94c1\u8def\u3002\u8fd9\u5bb6\u535a\u7269\u9986\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5730\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u7531\u4e0d\u540c\u56fd\u5bb6\u548c\u6587\u5316\u7684\u79fb\u6c11\u5efa\u8bbe\u8d77\u6765\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u79fb\u6c11\u79bb\u5f00\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u7956\u56fd\u65f6\uff0c\u5fc3\u4e2d\u88c5\u7740\u4e00\u7247\u6545\u571f\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u5bb6\u56ed\u3002\n\nThis evening, I went to Chinatown.

Traditionally, visitors enter Chinatown through the legendary Dragon Gate, which was built using materials donated from China. Other famous sites include the Tin How Temple and Bank of Canton, to name but a few. Visitors can also spend hours just exploring the interesting sights, smells, and sounds of China. Portsmouth Square is also a key site, being the centre of Chinatown. It has a long and famous history, with the author Robert Louis Stevenson having spent much time writing there. These days, the square is a great place to see traditional Chinese culture in real life, such as games of Chinese chess, and people practising tai chi.\n\n\u5510\u4eba\u8857\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u5efa\u7b51\u6bc1\u4e8e1906\u5e74\u7684\u5927\u5730\u9707\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5e02\u653f\u5e9c\u548c\u5c45\u6c11\u5c06\u5b83\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7279\u5730\u878d\u5165\u8bf8\u591a\u4e2d\u56fd\u5efa\u7b51\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\uff0c\u6e38\u5ba2\u4ece\u5177\u6709\u4f20\u5947\u8272\u5f69\u7684\u9f99\u95e8\u8d70\u5165\u5510\u4eba\u8857\uff0c\u9f99\u95e8\u7684\u5efa\u7b51\u6750\u6599\u662f\u7531\u4e2d\u56fd\u6350\u8d60\u7684\u3002\u5176\u4ed6\u7684\u8457\u540d\u666f\u70b9\u8fd8\u6709\u5929\u540e\u53e4\u5e99\u3001\u5e7f\u4e1c\u94f6\u884c\u7b49\uff0c\u4e0d\u80dc\u679a\u4e3e\u3002\u6e38\u5ba2\u4ea6\u53ef\u82b1\u4e0a\u6570\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u4e00\u63a2\u6b64\u5730\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd\u5473\u9053\u4e0e\u7f8e\u666f\u58f0\u8272\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5510\u4eba\u8857\u7684\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u82b1\u56ed\u89d2\u5e7f\u573a\u4e5f\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u666f\u70b9\u3002\u5e7f\u573a\u5386\u53f2\u60a0\u4e45\uff0c\u58f0\u540d\u8fdc\u626c\uff0c\u4f5c\u5bb6\u7f57\u4f2f\u7279\u00b7\u8def\u6613\u65af\u00b7\u53f2\u8482\u6587\u68ee\u66fe\u957f\u5c45\u4e8e\u6b64\u8fdb\u884c\u521b\u4f5c\u3002\u5982\u4eca\uff0c\u82b1\u56ed\u89d2\u5e7f\u573a\u5df2\u7ecf\u6210\u4e3a\u6e38\u5ba2\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u597d\u53bb\u5904\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6b23\u8d4f\u73b0\u5b9e\u751f\u6d3b\u91cc\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd\u4f20\u7edf\u6587\u5316\uff0c\u5982\u4e2d\u56fd\u8c61\u68cb\u548c\u6253\u592a\u6781\u62f3\u3002\n\nThe stores in the Chinatown offer a unique range of souvenirs, goods, and clothing.

However, some scientists were determined to help humans realise their dream to explore space. After many experiments, they succeeded in making rockets that could escape Earth\u2019s gravity. On 4 October 1957, the Sputnik 1 satellite was lunched by the USSR and successfully orbited around Earth. Afterwards, the USSR focused on sending people into space, and on 12 April 1961, Yuri Gagarin became the first person in the world to go into space. Over eight years later, on 20 July 1969, American astronaut Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon, famously saying, \u201cThat\u2019s one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\u201d Following this, many more goals were achieved. For example, America\u2019s NASA space agency launched Voyager 1 on 5 September 1977 to study deep space, and it still transmits data today.\n\n\u572820\u4e16\u7eaa\u4e2d\u53f6\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4eba\u90fd\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fdb\u5165\u592a\u7a7a\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u68a6\u60f3\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u51b3\u610f\u8981\u5e2e\u52a9\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a2\u7d22\u592a\u7a7a\u7684\u68a6\u60f3\u3002\u7ecf\u8fc7\u591a\u6b21\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u6210\u529f\u5236\u9020\u51fa\u80fd\u9003\u8131\u5730\u7403\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u706b\u7bad\u30021957\u5e7410\u67084\u65e5\uff0c\u82cf\u8054\u53d1\u5c04\u4e86\u4eba\u9020\u536b\u661f\u201c\u65c5\u4f34\u4e00\u53f7\u201d\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u73af\u7ed5\u5730\u7403\u8fd0\u884c\u3002\u6b64\u540e\uff0c\u82cf\u8054\u5c06\u91cd\u70b9\u653e\u5728\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u9001\u5165\u592a\u7a7a\uff0c1961\u5e744\u670812\u65e5\uff0c\u5c24\u91cc\u00b7\u52a0\u52a0\u6797\u6210\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fdb\u5165\u592a\u7a7a\u7684\u4eba\u3002\u516b\u5e74\u540e\u76841969\u5e747\u670820\u65e5\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b87\u822a\u5458\u5c3c\u5c14\u00b7\u963f\u59c6\u65af\u7279\u6717\u767b\u4e0a\u6708\u7403\uff0c\u4ed6\u8bf4\u8fc7\u4e00\u53e5\u540d\u8a00\uff1a\u201c\u5bf9\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u5c0f\u6b65\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u6b21\u5de8\u5927\u98de\u8dc3\u3002\u201d\u6b64\u540e\uff0c\u53c8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u56fd\u5bb6\u822a\u7a7a\u4e0e\u822a\u5929\u5c40\u4e8e1977\u5e749\u67085\u65e5\u53d1\u5c04\u4e86\u201c\u65c5\u884c\u8005\u4e00\u53f7\u201d\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u5916\u592a\u7a7a\uff0c\u5982\u4eca\u5b83\u4ecd\u5728\u4f20\u8f93\u6570\u636e\u3002\n\nAlthough scientists try to make sure nothing goes wrong, accidents can still happen.

These disasters made everyone sad and disappointed, but the desire to explore the universe never died.

China became the third country in the world to independently send humans into space in 2003, when Yang Liwei successfully orbited Earth in the Shenzhou 5 spacecraft. Then Shenzhou 6 and 7 completed a second manned orbit and the first Chinese spacewalk, followed by the vehicle Jade Rabbit being sent to the moon to study its surface. After that, China launched the Tiangong 2 space lab into space and Tianzhou 1 to dock with it. This signalled one step further in China\u2019s plan to establish a space station in the future.

Some people argue that we should stop wasting time and money exploring space. Instead, we should feed the world\u2019s poor and find immediate solutions to other problems, such as pollution and fatal diseases.

It has directly resulted in the many satellites that now orbit Earth. A number of the satellites record data on land and weather patterns. Then the data is transmitted to scientists on Earth. After careful analysis, the scientists can provide useful recommendations and advice for farmers. As a result, space-based science has helped farming in its efforts to grow enough food to feed Earth\u2019s increasing population.\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u5728\u5728\u6d88\u9664\u4e16\u754c\u9965\u997f\u7684\u6597\u4e89\u4e2d\u53d1\u6325\u4e86\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u7ed5\u5730\u7403\u98de\u884c\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u536b\u661f\u90fd\u662f\u76f4\u63a5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e00\u539f\u56e0\u88ab\u9001\u4e0a\u4e86\u592a\u7a7a\u3002\u8bb8\u591a\u536b\u661f\u8bb0\u5f55\u7740\u9646\u5730\u548c\u5929\u6c14\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u88ab\u4f20\u9001\u5230\u5730\u7403\u4e0a\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u3002\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4ed4\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u519c\u6c11\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u7528\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u592a\u7a7a\u6280\u672f\u5e2e\u52a9\u519c\u4e1a\u52aa\u529b\u79cd\u690d\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u98df\u7269\u6765\u517b\u6d3b\u5730\u7403\u4e0a\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u957f\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u3002\n\nSecondly, space exploration has already promoted technological improvements that benefit us all. High-end products around the world are made to a higher standard now because of advanced technology which was first created to meet the requirements for space exploration. For example, space technologies have helped the research and development of different types of new material. They have also helped companies make better heart monitors and other machines that doctors regularly use. Today, space technologies are widely used in all kinds of industries, and everyday products such as GPS, memory foam pillows, and smartphone cameras are changing our lives.\n\n\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u592a\u7a7a\u63a2\u7d22\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u9020\u798f\u4e8e\u6211\u4eec\u6240\u6709\u4eba\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6280\u672f\u9996\u6b21\u88ab\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u592a\u7a7a\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u5730\u7684\u9ad8\u7aef\u4ea7\u54c1\u90fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6280\u672f\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u6750\u6599\u3002\u5b83\u4eec\u8fd8\u5e2e\u52a9\u516c\u53f8\u5236\u9020\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5fc3\u810f\u76d1\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u533b\u751f\u7ecf\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u4eea\u5668\u3002\u5982\u4eca\uff0c\u592a\u7a7a\u6280\u672f\u5df2\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u4e2a\u884c\u4e1a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8bf8\u5982\u5168\u7403\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6ce1\u6cab\u6795\u5934\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u76f8\u673a\u4e4b\u7c7b\u7684\u65e5\u5e38\u7528\u54c1\u6b63\u5728\u6539\u53d8\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u3002\n\nFinally, sending astronauts into space has helped people to think about the world\u2019s problems and even to find ways to solve them. Seeing pictures of our planet as an island in a black sea made people realise that our planet\u2019s resources are limited. In order to provide for such a rapidly increasing population, scientists are trying to find other planets that could one day be our new home.

By now we know the all too familiar story of live music\u2019s absence due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the shared disappointment felt by both bands and fans alike. With the festival undergoing a two-year hiatus, fans eagerly awaited the return of their beloved hardcore festival. For many on the West Coast, and specifically Southern California, Sound and Fury is the largest convergence of hardcore music and culture in a region that is often underserved in terms of dedicated festivals centered around this subgenre of music.\n\nThis year, Sound and Fury\u2019s triumphant return took place at a far larger venue than ever before. Held at Los Angeles\u2019 Exposition Park, the event boasted an expansive lineup of 30-plus acts that not only featured some of the genre\u2019s most seasoned and accomplished acts (Terror, Gods Hate, Drug Church, Angel Du$t) but also reflected the current state of hardcore \u2014 one that\u2019s grown exponentially since the 2019 festival. Even in the midst of a pandemic, hardcore felt like it was at its most fruitful and evolved state while going through a major resurgence, which signaled that the genre was beginning to experience its next major crossover.\n\nRead more: Meet Koyo, the Long Island quintet at the forefront of the melodic hardcore and emo revival\n\nBreakout acts included bands such as Anxious, Koyo, Zulu, Scowl, No Pressure and One Step Closer, who wear their influences on their sleeves but push the genre forward in exciting and progressive ways, all of whom performed at this year\u2019s festival. Notably, hardcore began to diversify and hone in on the importance of representation with powerful POC-led groups, female-identifying front persons and groups that echoed the sentiments of meaningful change and action.\n\n2022\u2019s Sound and Fury felt like the true embodiment of the new face of hardcore, with all walks of life in attendance, showing that hardcore at its roots is for everyone and will continue to be a safe, welcoming space for all. What\u2019s more, hardcore will continue to grow and evolve while defying any exclusivity or pretentiousness that was often present in the past.\n\nAdditionally, Sound and Fury was co-presented by Brain Dead, an alternative streetwear brand that\u2019s at the forefront of the intersection between music, skateboarding, fashion and high art. Fans lined up in droves to secure festival-exclusive merchandise at their impressive pop-up shop on the festival grounds. In addition to the shopping experience, crowd-goers were also treated to a traveling arcade experience courtesy of Brain Dead, which boasted several video game machines that allowed everyone a chance to join the fun.\n\nSignificantly, there was an abundance of celebrations, rebirths, and somber goodbyes. On one hand, many in attendance and onstage basked in the return of a beloved music festival and live music in general, but on the other hand, it was impossible not to celebrate how amazing it was to see hardcore at such an elevated state. Many bands were given the opportunity to play in front of some of the largest crowds they\u2019ve ever seen, paired with the genre\u2019s recent uptick in popularity and exposure to a broader audience.\n\nRead more: Zulu: \u201cThe best part about music is that you can do whatever you want with it\u201d\n\nIt was of course heartwarming to see the reunion of two of the festival\u2019s most left-field groups \u2014 Superheaven and Pity Sex \u2014 both of which play a blend of shoegaze and \u201890s-tinged grunge, a stark contrast to the heavy majority of acts, who abruptly disbanded in the mid-2010s. Despite the sonic shift, both bands were warmly received and put on emotionally driven sets that clearly show that neither has missed a beat.\n\nIn the midst of reunions came a somber goodbye to one of the genre\u2019s brightest groups, Gulch, who announced that Sound and Fury would be their final West Coast show. Fittingly, they closed out the two-day festival on Sunday night with a visceral, chaotic set that sent seismic waves across the festival grounds. Gulch played their set harder than ever knowing that it would be their last, and the thousands of fans didn\u2019t take the moment for granted, with a sea of crowd-surfing, mosh pits from every direction and extreme stage-diving. Gulch showed that you can go out with not only grace and style but most certainly a massive bang.\n\nAs the festival came to a close, it truly felt like the hardcore community was a part of something bigger than the music. It\u2019s safe to assume as people made their way back to their cars and proceeded on the commute home that they would be left with lasting memories and immediate anticipation for what next year\u2019s festival might bring. One thing is for sure: Sound and Fury is here to stay, and one can only imagine the heights it will reach in the years to come. \u2014Alessandro DeCaro"}, {"url": "https://www.chinahighlights.com/festivals/traditional-festival/", "page_content": "These traditional festivals will really introduce you to life in China.

Faulkner\u2019s fourth novel, The Sound and the Fury is notable for its nonlinear plot structure and its unconventional narrative style.\n\nThe four sections, despite their formal differences, overlap in important ways. In essence, they tell the same story\u2014that of the elusive Compson daughter, Candace (\u201cCaddy\u201d), who was divorced by her husband and disowned by her family after it was revealed that her child, Quentin (\u201cMiss Quentin,\u201d named for her uncle), had been conceived out of wedlock. When the disgraced Caddy left the Compson household in 1911, she did not take her daughter. Miss Quentin remained with the family to be raised as a Compson. Although her presence is pervasive throughout, Caddy does not actually appear in the novel. She is reconstructed through the memories of her three brothers, each of whom remembers and relates to her in a different way.\n\nThe Sound and the Fury is divided into four sections. The first three are presented from the perspectives of the three Compson sons: Benjamin (\u201cBenjy,\u201d born Maury), the \u201cidiot\u201d; Quentin, the suicidal student; and Jason, the failed businessman. The fourth section has a third-person omniscient narrator. All but the second section are set in fictional Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi, in April 1928.\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe events of the first section of The Sound and the Fury take place some 17 years after Caddy\u2019s departure. The first section is notoriously difficult to read: its narrator, Benjy, has an intellectual disability. The precise character of his disability is not known; he is sometimes called a \u201clooney\u201d or, more commonly, an \u201cidiot.\u201d Evidently, his disability affects his ability to speak (he communicates by \u201cmoaning\u201d) and to reason. It also distorts his sense of time, such that he cannot distinguish between the past and the present. Benjy experiences all time as the present and thus narrates all events, including and especially memories of past events, as though they occur in the present. Unbeknownst to him, the events he narrates as \u201cthe present\u201d actually span a 30-year period, from 1898 to 1928.\n\nBenjy\u2019s section opens on April 7, 1928. In the first scene of the novel, Benjy and his caretaker, Luster, search for a lost quarter near a fenced golf course. Benjy, following Luster, climbs through a break in the fence and gets caught on a nail. The sensation reminds him of an earlier time (1902) when Caddy uncaught him and led him through the fence. This memory provokes another: Benjy remembers visiting a cemetery to see the graves of his father and brother (1912 or 1913). A nearby golfer\u2019s call for his \u201ccaddie\u201d recalls more memories of Caddy; Benjy remembers Caddy\u2019s wedding (1910) and Caddy\u2019s leaving (1911) and also the sight of Caddy\u2019s muddy underwear on the day of his grandmother\u2019s funeral (1898).\n\nIn the present action, Benjy and Luster return to the Compson house. There they see Caddy\u2019s daughter, Miss Quentin, embracing a boy on a swing. Benjy remembers seeing Caddy embracing a boy on the same swing, some time ago (1908 or 1909). For a moment, mother and daughter become indistinguishable to Benjy; then, Miss Quentin sees and snaps at him. As Benjy enters the Compson house, his thoughts turn to his castration several years earlier and to the events leading up to the loss of Caddy\u2019s virginity (1909). His section ends in his room, 30 years before it began, with the memory of Caddy holding him on the night she muddied her underwear (1898).\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Although Quentin has no intellectual disability, Quentin\u2019s section, like Benjy\u2019s, oscillates between the past and the present. The actions of the present (here, 1910) are Quentin\u2019s as he prepares to commit suicide. Quentin\u2019s preparations are partly practical and partly symbolic: they include breaking his grandfather\u2019s watch, packing up his belongings, writing letters to his loved ones, purchasing weights (two six-pound flatirons) with which to drown himself, and visiting the nearby Charles River Bridge, where he will eventually commit suicide.\n\nQuentin\u2019s present actions are set against his memories of key events in his life, most of which involve Caddy or Caddy\u2019s lovers. A few memories predominate: the memory of the night Caddy lost her virginity to Dalton Ames (1909); the memory of his confrontation with Dalton upon the discovery of Caddy\u2019s pregnancy (1909); the memory of his meeting Caddy\u2019s fianc\u00e9, the banker Sydney Herbert Head, whom Caddy marries (1910) despite her pregnancy by another man; and the memory of a conversation with his father, in which Quentin claimed he committed incest with his sister, though he did not (1910). It is implied that Quentin\u2019s memories\u2014and these four in particular\u2014compel his suicide. Quentin\u2019s suicide is not narrated; his section ends as he walks out of his dorm.\n\nThe third section of The Sound and the Fury returns to Yoknapatawpha County in the year 1928. This section\u2014Jason\u2019s section\u2014is set one day before the first, on April 6, 1928. Unlike the previous two, Jason\u2019s section is straightforward and, for the most part, linear: it chronicles his present activities and interactions, both at the Compson house and the farm-supply store where he works. The focal point of his narration is his 17-year-old niece, Miss Quentin, who, as Jason describes her, is very much like her mother: headstrong, rebellious, and promiscuous. Jason disdains Miss Quentin (and she him)\u2014and yet he relies on her for money. Each month Caddy sends Miss Quentin a $200 check, which Jason intercepts and keeps for himself. For nearly 15 years Jason has kept up this scheme undiscovered\u2014until April 6, 1928, when Caddy sends a money order (requiring a signature) in place of a check, and Miss Quentin, at last, learns about her uncle\u2019s subterfuge. Still, Jason withholds the money.\n\nThe fourth section of the novel picks up on April 8, 1928, two days after Jason\u2019s section and one day after Benjy\u2019s. The fourth section is narrated in the third-person and focuses primarily on Dilsey, the Compsons\u2019 black servant. On the morning of April 8, the author-narrator observes Dilsey performing her chores, as usual, in the Compson house. As she prepares breakfast, Dilsey talks to Luster, who tells her that someone broke into Jason\u2019s bedroom the night before. Moments later, it is discovered that Miss Quentin not only broke Jason\u2019s window but entered his bedroom, found her mother\u2019s money, stole it back, and fled the house. Jason, furious, goes to chase her but ultimately fails to catch her.\n\nIn Jason\u2019s absence, Dilsey, Luster, and Benjy attend Easter service at Dilsey\u2019s church. The visiting minister preaches about redemption, and Dilsey, thinking of the Compsons and the events of the morning, begins to cry. She reflects: \u201cI\u2019ve seed de first en de last\u2026.I seed de beginning, en now I sees de endin.\u201d Dilsey\u2019s words foretell the end of the novel: soon after, Faulkner brings it to an uneventful, inconclusive close.\n\nAn appendix to the novel, published in 1946, details the fates of the surviving Compsons. According to the appendix, Benjy was committed to an asylum in 1933; Jason moved into an apartment above the supply-store; and Caddy moved to Paris, where she lived at the time of the German occupation of France (1940\u201344). Neither Caddy nor her daughter returned to Yoknapatawpha County."}, {"url": "https://www.stereogum.com/2185943/sound-and-fury-2022-lineup/news/", "page_content": "The Sound And Fury Festival will return to Los Angeles this summer, and its lineup is insane.
