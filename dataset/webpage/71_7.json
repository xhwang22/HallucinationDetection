I will say to the Lord, \u201cMy refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.\u201d (Psalm 91:1\u20132)\n\nOn January 8, 1956, Jim Elliot, Nate Saint, Ed McCully, Peter Flemming, and Roger Youderian were speared to death on a sandbar called \u201cPalm Beach\u201d in the Curaray River of Ecuador. They were trying to reach the Huaorani Indians for the first time in history with the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\nElisabeth Elliot memorialized the story in her book Shadow of the Almighty. That title comes from Psalm 91:1: \u201cHe who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.\u201d\n\nNot an Accident\n\nThis is where Jim Elliot was slain \u2014 in the shadow of the Almighty. Elisabeth had not forgotten the heartbreaking facts when she chose that title two years after her husband\u2019s death. When he was killed, they had been married three years and had a ten-month-old daughter.\n\n\u201cGod\u2019s refuge for his people is not from suffering and death, but final and ultimate defeat.\u201d\n\nThe title was not a slip \u2014 not any more than the death of the five missionaries was a slip. But the world saw it differently. Around the world, the death of these young men was called a tragic nightmare. Elisabeth believed the world was missing something. She wrote, \u201cThe world did not recognize the truth of the second clause in Jim Elliot\u2019s credo: \u2018He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe called her book Shadow of the Almighty because she was utterly convinced that the refuge of the people of God is not a refuge from suffering and death, but a refuge from final and ultimate defeat. \u201cWhoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it\u201d (Luke 9:24) \u2014 because the Lord is God Almighty.\n\nGod did not exercise his omnipotence to deliver Jesus from the cross. Nor will he exercise it to deliver you and me from tribulation. \u201cIf they persecuted me, they will also persecute you\u201d (John 15:20). If we have the faith and single-mindedness and courage of those five missionaries, we might find ourselves saying with the apostle Paul,\n\n\u201cFor your sake we are being killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.\u201d No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Romans 8:36\u201339)\n\nSecurity in His Strength\n\nHas it ever hit home to you what it means to say, \u201cMy God, who loves me and gave himself for me, is almighty\u201d? It means that if you take your place \u201cin the shadow of the Almighty,\u201d you will be protected by omnipotence. There is infinite and unending security in the almightiness of God \u2014 no matter what happens in this life.\n\n\u201cThere is infinite, unending security in the almightiness of God \u2014 no matter what happens in this life.\u201d\n\nThe omnipotence of God means eternal, unshakable refuge in the everlasting glory of God, no matter what happens on this earth. And that confidence is the power of radical obedience to the call of God \u2014 even the call to die.\n\nIs there anything more freeing, more thrilling, or more strengthening than the truth that God Almighty is your refuge \u2014 all day, every day, in all the ordinary and extraordinary experiences of life? Nothing but what he ordains for your good befalls you.\n\nGod Intervened\n\nResearch into the circumstances surrounding the martyrdom of the five missionaries has revealed the hand of God in unexpected ways. In the September 1996 issue of Christianity Today, Steve Saint, son of Nate Saint, who was martyred along with Elliott, McCully, Flemming, and Youderian, wrote an article about new discoveries made about the tribal intrigue behind the slayings. He wrote one of the most amazing sentences on the sovereignty of the Almighty that I have ever read \u2014 especially coming from the son of a slain missionary:\n\nAs [the killers] described their recollections, it occurred to me how incredibly unlikely it was that the Palm Beach killing took place at all; it is an anomaly that I cannot explain outside of divine intervention. (italics added)\n\nIn other words, there is only one explanation for why these five young men died and left a legacy that has inspired thousands. God intervened. This is the kind of sovereignty we mean when we say, \u201cNothing but what he ordains for your good befalls you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the darkest moments of our pain, God is hiding his weapons behind enemy lines.\u201d\n\nWhich also means that no one, absolutely no one, can frustrate the designs of God to fulfill his missionary plans for the nations. In the darkest moments of our pain, God is hiding his weapons behind enemy lines. Everything that happens in history will serve this purpose as expressed in Psalm 86:9,\n\nAll the nations you have made shall come and worship before you, O Lord, and shall glorify your name.\n\nIf we believed this, if we really let this truth of God\u2019s omnipotence get hold of us \u2014 that we live perfectly secure in the shadow of the Almighty \u2014 what a difference it would make in our personal lives and in our families and churches. How humble and powerful we would become for the saving purposes of God."}, {"url": "https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justin-taylor/they-were-no-fools-60-years-ago-today-the-martyrdom-of-jim-elliot-and-four-other-missionaries/", "page_content": "On January 8, 1956, 28-year-old American missionary Jim Elliot was martyred, along with four missionary partners and friends. He was survived by his wife, Elisabeth, and their 10-month-old daughter Valerie.\n\nPhillip James (\u201cJim\u201d) Elliot was born in Portland, Oregon, on October 8, 1927. He enrolled at Wheaton College in the fall of 1945 and graduated four years later as a Bible major with highest honors.\n\nThe fall of 1949 was a heady season for neo-evangelicalism, seeking to differentiate itself from the fundamentalism of the past, revive the church, win the lost, and gain respect from the culture. 30-year-old Billy Graham\u2014who had graduated from Wheaton six years before Jim Elliot\u2014held his very first crusade, as over 6,000 people came to hear him preach at the Civic Auditorium in Grand Rapids, Michigan (September 13-21). After that he was off to Los Angeles for a two-month campaign that would catapult him to national fame. That December, the first gathering of the Evangelical Theological Society convened, as sixty Bible and theology professors met in Cincinnati to hear an address by Carl Henry, who had published The Uneasy Conscience of Modern Fundamentalism just two years earlier.\n\nIt was during this time\u2014October 28, 1949, to be exact\u2014that Jim Elliot penned a journal entry:\n\nHe is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain that which he cannot lose.\n\nCenturies earlier the 17th century English nonconformist preacher Phillip Henry had said, \u201cHe is no fool who parts with that which he cannot keep, when he is sure to be recompensed with that which he cannot lose.\u201d\n\nIn the archives at Wheaton College\u2019s Billy Graham Center you can view Elliot\u2019s journals (published here.) Below is a picture of the page from his journal. (As the Archives note, the underline and asterisk was likely added later after he died.)\n\nA few months later, in 1950, a former missionary to Ecuador told Elliot about the Huaorani (or \u201cAuca\u201d) Indians, a small and fierce unreached people in the jungle. Elliot sensed a call from the Lord to reach this people for Christ.\n\nIf you want to hear from Elliot himself around this time, here is a sermon from 1951 delivered in Illinois (or read the transcript):\n\nIn 1952, Jim and his friend Pete Fleming set sail for Guayaquil as missionaries, arriving in February. For six months they stayed in Quito (the capital of Ecuador) in order to learn Spanish, before moving deep into jungle, where they lived at Shandia, a mission station.\n\nOn January 29, 1953, Jim Elliot proposed to Elisabeth Howard on her 21st birthday, and they were married on October 8 in a civil ceremony in Quito on Jim\u2019s 26th birthday. Their daughter Valerie was born on February 27, 1955.\n\nIn the fall of 1955, the missionaries made initial contact with the Huaorani. Nate Saint was able to maneuver his plane in tight circles while lowering a bucket from a rope containing gifts like buttons and rock salt, with more gifts delivered over the next several weeks. Later the missionaries used a loudspeaker to shout simple Huaorani phrases they had learned from a young Huaorani girl who had left the society and befriended Nate Saint\u2019s sister, Rachel. The Huaorani began to reciprocate with gifts of their own.\n\nNate Saint identified a sandbar on the Curary River, four and a half miles from the main Huaorani location and determined it could be used as a landing strip and camp, calling it \u201cPalm Beach.\u201d The missionaries arrived there on January 3, 1957, flying over the Huaorani settlement to telling them by loudspeaker to meet them there.\n\nThe Wikipedia entry for Operation Auca summarizes what happened next:\n\nOn January 6, after the Americans had spent several days of waiting and shouting basic Huaorani phrases into the jungle, the first Huaorani visitors arrived. A young man and two women emerged on the opposite river bank around 11:15 a.m., and soon joined the missionaries at their encampment. The younger of the two women had come against the wishes of her family, and the man, named Nankiwi, who was romantically interested in her, followed. The older woman (about thirty years old) acted as a self-appointed chaperone. The men gave them several gifts, including a model plane, and the visitors soon relaxed and began conversing freely, apparently not realizing that the men\u2019s language skills were weak. Nankiwi, whom the missionaries nicknamed \u201cGeorge\u201d, showed interest in their aircraft, so Saint took off with him aboard. They first completed a circuit around the camp, but Nankiwi appeared eager for a second trip, so they flew toward Terminal City. Upon reaching a familiar clearing, Nankiwi recognized his neighbors, and leaning out of the plane, wildly waved and shouted to them. Later that afternoon, the younger woman became restless, and though the missionaries offered their visitors sleeping quarters, Nankiwi and the young woman left the beach with little explanation. The older woman apparently had more interest in conversing with the missionaries, and remained there most of the night. After seeing Nankiwi in the plane, a small group of Huaorani decided to make the trip to Palm Beach, and left the following morning, January 7. On the way, they encountered Nankiwi and the girl, returning unescorted. The girl\u2019s brother, Nampa, was furious at this, and to defuse the situation and divert attention from himself, Nankiwi claimed that the foreigners had attacked them on the beach, and in their haste to flee, they had been separated from their chaperone. Gikita, a senior member of the group whose experience with outsiders had taught him that they could not be trusted, recommended that they kill the foreigners. The return of the older woman and her account of the friendliness of the missionaries was not enough to dissuade them, and they soon continued toward the beach. On January 8 the missionaries waited, expecting a larger group of Huaorani to arrive sometime that afternoon, if only to get plane rides. Saint made several trips over Huaorani settlements, and on the following morning he noted a group of Huaorani men traveling toward Palm Beach. He excitedly relayed this information to his wife over the radio at 12:30 p.m., promising to make contact again at 4:30 p.m. The Huaorani arrived at Palm Beach around 3:00 p.m., and in order to divide the foreigners before attacking them, they sent three women to the other side of the river. One, Dawa, remained hidden in the jungle, but the other two showed themselves. Two of the missionaries waded into the water to greet them, but were attacked from behind by Nampa. Apparently attempting to scare him, Elliot, the first missionary to be speared, drew his pistol and began firing. One of these shots mildly injured Dawa, still hidden, and another grazed the missionary\u2019s attacker after he was grabbed from behind by one of the women. . . . The other missionary in the river, Fleming, before being speared, desperately reiterated friendly overtures and asked the Huaorani why they were killing them. Meanwhile, the other Huaorani warriors, led by Gikita, attacked the three missionaries still on the beach, spearing Saint first, then McCully as he rushed to stop them. Youderian ran to the airplane to get to the radio, but he was speared as he picked up the microphone to report the attack. The Huaorani then threw the men\u2019s bodies and their belongings in the river, and ripped the fabric from their aircraft. They then returned to their village and, anticipating retribution, burned it to the ground and fled into the jungle.\n\nBy January 13, four of the bodies had been identified, and one had washed away.\n\nYou can watch the story here of what happened afterward in the providence of God:\n\nFor excellent theological reflections on all of this, see this new piece by John Piper: \u201cSlain in the Shadow of the Almighty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were killed with the sword.\n\nThey [were men] of whom the world was not worthy.\u201d\n\n\u2014Hebrews 11:37-38"}, {"url": "https://www.christianity.com/wiki/history/who-were-the-five-missionaries-who-died-in-the-ecuador-jungle.html", "page_content": "Sixty-four years ago, on January 8, 1956, five men between the ages of 27 and 32, were speared to death trying to reach a violent, indigenous tribe in Ecuador with the gospel. They all left behind wives and four had young children. The men knew the task was dangerous, even life-threatening. So, who were these men and what would cause them to willingly lay down their lives?\n\nThe Missionaries\n\nJames \u201cJim\u201d Elliot (Christian Missions in Many Lands) and his wife Elisabeth or \u201cBetty\u201d were both graduates of Wheaton College near Chicago. They had one daughter, Valerie, together. Jim and Elisabeth were both single missionaries to Ecuador before they were married.\n\nPeter \u201cPete\u201d Fleming (Christian Missions in Many Lands) was married to Olive. He studied philosophy at the University of Washington before becoming a missionary. Pete and Jim Elliot went to Ecuador as missionaries together in 1952 before they both got married in 1954. They continued their attempts to reach the Huaorani together with Ed, Nate, and Roger.\n\nEdward \u201cEd\u201d McCully (Christian Missions in Many Lands), also a graduate of Wheaton College, married Marilou (graduate of Moody Bible Institute in Chicago) and was father to Stephen, Michael, and Matthew. (Marilou was eight months pregnant with Matthew at the time of Ed\u2019s death.)\n\nNathanael \u201cNate\u201d Saint (Missionary Aviation Fellowship) was married to Marjorie and father to Kathy, Stephen, and Philip. He had also attended Wheaton College. According to From Jerusalem to Irian Jaya: A Biographical History of Christian History Missions, \u201cPerhaps the best-known missionary pilot has been Nate Saint, whose role in the Auca tragedy made him a household name in evangelical circles.\u201d It was due to Nate Saint\u2019s skill as a pilot that the five missionaries were able to land on \u201cPalm Beach.\u201d Nate served in World War II with the Army Air Corps.\n\nRoger Youderian (Gospel Missionary Union) attended Montana State College, enlisted in the U.S. Army, was a paratrooper in World War II, and afterwards attended Northwestern College to prepare for missions. He married Barbara and had two children, Beth and Jerry.\n\nThe Mission\n\nThe interdenominational, evangelical missionaries, Jim Elliot, Pete Fleming, Ed McCully, Nate Saint, and Roger Youderian, were speared to death by the very people they were attempting to reach with the gospel. The five men left behind five widows. The Huaorani Indians (otherwise known as the Waodani, Waorani, or Auca Indians), totaling around 500 tribe members in 1955, were a violent tribe of indigenous, Amerindians living in the Amazonian region of Ecuador.\n\nThe tribe was fearful of outsiders and had been known to kill any that entered their territory. They were also internally violent. The missionaries chose to go to the Huaorani tribe because they were known to be completely \u201cunreached\u201d by the gospel. The tragedy was featured in the January 30, 1956 edition of Life Magazine which was the first time the Huaorani tribe was ever photographed in their natural surroundings.\n\nAccording to that 1956 edition of Life Magazine, the missionaries discovered the \u201cAucas\u201d or Huaorani \u201cas they and their wives were ministering to Quechua-speaking and Jivaro Indians.\u201d The term Auca means \u201csavages\u201d in Quechua. They physically found the tribe flying over Auca territory in Nate Saint\u2019s plane. The men spent weeks dropping gifts from the plane to the Aucas in a bucket before finding the courage to land the plane on the shore of the Curaray River. They believed the Aucas to be friendly when they finally landed on the riverbank that they referred to as \u201cPalm Beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetween October 6 and December 23, Saint, accompanied by either McCully or Elliot, made 13 flights over the Wao clearings. Fleming provided prayer and financial support from his station. Saint lowered gifts to the ground. First, they sent down an aluminum cooking pot decorated with floating ribbons, then buttons, pants, shirts (the Waorani wore only cotton G-strings), an ax head, knives, photos, machetes. The Waorani received these gifts with smiles and laughter. They began to return gifts: a headband, woven thread, smoked monkey tail, two squirrels, a parrot. During these exchanges, the men shouted carefully mouthed phrases in the Wao language, which they had picked up from Dayuma, a young Wao woman who had fled tribal violence only to live in servitude at a nearby hacienda.\u201d\n\nTo Lay Down One\u2019s Life\n\nIn early January, all five men, believing that God was providing an \u201copen door\u201d to reach the Huaorani with the good news of Jesus Christ, landed on the banks of the Curaray River in Nate Saint\u2019s plane. Although initial contacts seemed friendly, all five men were ultimately speared to death by the Huaorani (who believed that all outsiders would eventually shoot them with guns). Elliot, Fleming, McCully, Saint, and Youderian, of course, had no intention of shooting the Indians, but, rather, were hoping and praying to be able to share with them the hope of eternal life that they had in Christ.\n\nAgain, what would cause five young men with families to willingly lay down their lives? Did they truly believe that their mission to reach the Aucas was worth risking everything? They absolutely did. They believed the story of the New Testament, that Jesus Himself had laid down His life to save those who were spiritually lost. The Aucas, or Huaorani, had never heard of Jesus\u2019 love and sacrifice on the cross. They didn\u2019t have a Bible in their language and had not heard the message of salvation. They needed someone to come tell them, and yet that required great courage as the Huaorani were known for violence. The five men who went believed it was what Christ would have done and what Christ wanted them to do!\n\nIf you declare with your mouth, \u201cJesus is Lord,\u201d and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved\u2026. for, \u201cEveryone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.\u201d How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? And how can anyone preach unless they are sent?\u201d (Romans 10:9-15, NIV).\n\nNot in Vain\n\nSo, did the men die in vain? Did the Huaorani ever hear and receive the message about Jesus? It turns out that the men weren\u2019t the only courageous ones. Following their deaths, with the help of Dayuma, Jim\u2019s wife, Elisabeth (along with daughter, Valerie), and Nate\u2019s sister, Rachel, returned to live among the Huaorani, offering them forgiveness and completing the task the men had begun. This led to the conversion of many in the tribe, including at least one of the murderers. Ultimately, the New Testament was translated into the Wao language. \u201cNate Saint\u2019s eldest son, Steve, and his family lived among the Waorani for a year in 1995.\u201d\n\nSources\n\nhttps://christianhistoryinstitute.org/magazine/article/martyrs-to-the-spear/\n\nhttps://www.christiantoday.com/article/i-miss-my-father-but-he-gave-his-life-for-christ-daughter-of-murdered-christian-missionary-speaks-out/104967.htm\n\nhttps://www.inspirationalchristians.org/evangelists/jim-elliot-biography/\n\n\u201cShadow of the Almighty\u201d by Elisabeth Elliot\n\n\u201cThrough Gates of Splendor\u201d by Elisabeth Elliot\n\n\u201cThese Strange Ashes\u201d by Elisabeth Elliot\n\n\u00a9iStock/Getty Images Plus/Kalistratova\n\n\n\n\n\nKristi Walker has been a missionary in Berlin, Germany for over 15 years working with an international church as the Director of Student Ministries.

For many generations they have been completely isolated from the outside world, disposed to kill any stranger on sight, and feared even by their head-hunting neighbors, the Jivaro tribe.\n\nIn 1955, four missionaries from the United States who were working with the Quechas, Jivaros, and other Indians of the interior of Ecuador became persuaded that they were being called to preach the Gospel to the Huaorani as well.\n\nNate Saint was 32 years old (born 1923), and devoted to flying. He had taken flying lessons in high school and served in the Air Force in Wwii. After the war, he enrolled in Wheaton College to prepare for foreign mission work, dropped out to join the Missionary Aviation Fellowship, established a base at Shell Mera (an abandoned oil exploration camp in Ecuador) in September 1948, and flew short hops to keep missionaries supplied with medicines, mail, etc. Once his plane crashed, but a few weeks later he returned to work in a cast from his neck to his thighs. He was married to Marjorie (maiden name??).\n\nThe other threee, Ed McCully, Jim Elliot, and Peter Fleming, all Plymouth Brethren, came to Ecuador in 1952 to work for CMML (Christian Missions in Many Lands).\n\nEd McCully was ?? years old (born 19??). He had been a football and track star at Wheaton College, and president of senior class. After Wheaton, he enrolled at Marquette to study law, but dropped out to go to Ecuador. He and his wife Marilou (maiden name?) worked with the Quechuas at Arajuno, a base near the Huaorani. Half a dozen Quechuas had been killed at the base by Huaorani in the past year.\n\nJim Elliot was 28 years old (born 1927), an honors graduate of Wheaton College, where he had been a debater, public speaker, and champion wrestler. In Ecuador, he married Elisabeth Howard. They did paramedic work, tending broken arms, malaria, snakebite. The taught sanitation, wrote books in Quechua, and taught literacy.\n\nPeter Fleming was 27 years old (born 1928), from the University of Washington, an honor student, a linguist, married to Olive (maiden name?). They ran a literacy program among the Quechuas.\n\nNate and Ed found a Huaorani settlement from the air in late September, 1955. Nate made four more flights on Thursday, 29 September, and found a settlement only 15 minutes from their station. They told Jim and Pete, and the four planned their strategy. They would keep the project secret from everyone but their wives, to avoid being joined by adventurers and the press, with the chance that someone not dedicated to the mission would start shooting at the first sign of real or imagined danger, and destroy the project. They had one language resource, a Huaorani girl, Dayuma, who had fled from her tribe years earlier after her family was killed in a dispute, who was now living with Nate's sister Rachel, and who spoke both Huao and Quechua. From her they learned enough of the language to get started. They would fly over the village every Thursday and drop gifts as a means of making contact and establishing a friendly relation. Eventually they would try for closer contact. Nate had discovered that, if he lowered a bucket on a line from the plane, and flew in tight circles, the bucket remained almost stationary, and could be used to lower objects to the ground. He had devised a mechanism to release the bucket when it touched down.\n\nOn Thursday 6 October, one week after locating the village, they dropped an aluminum kettle into an apparently deserted village. On the next flight, several Huaorani were waiting, and they dropped a machete. On the third flight, they dropped another machete to a considerably larger crowd. Beginning with the fourth flight, they used a loudspeaker system to call out friendly messages in Huao. Soon the Huaorani were responding with gifts of their own tied to the line: a woven headband, carved wooden combs, two live parrots, cooked fish, parcels of peanuts, a piece of smoked monkey tail.... They cleared a space near their village, and built platforms to make the exchanges easier.\n\nAfter three months of air-to-ground contact, during which they made far more progress than they had hoped, the missionaries decided that it was time for ground contact--that they could not keep their activities secret much longer, and that delay risked a hostile encounter between the Huaorani and some third party. They decided that the expedition needed a fifth man, and so brought in Roger Youderian (married to Barbara ???), from rural Montana, a former paratrooper who had fought in the Battle of the Bulge (major German offensive in Belgium in the last stages of Wwii), and had been in General Eisenhower's honor guard. Roger had been working with the Jivaros, and was thoroughly at home in the jungle, accustomed to living like the Jivaros, and blessed with acute survival instincts. They located a beach that would serve as a landing strip, about four miles from the village, and decided to go in on Tuesday 3 January 1956. After some discussion, they decided to carry guns, having heard that the Huaorani never attacked anyone who was carrying a gun, and having resolved that they would, as a last resort, fire the guns into the air to ward off an attack, but would shoot no-one, even to save their own lives.\n\nOn Tuesday they flew in and made camp, and then flew over the village to invite the Huaorani to visit them. The first visitors showed up on Friday, a man, a woman, and a teen-aged girl. They stayed for several hours in apparent friendliness, and then left abruptly. On Saturday, no one showed, and when the plane flew over the village, the Huaorani seemed frightened at first, but lost their fright when presents were dropped. On Sunday afternoon, 8 January 1956, at about 3pm, all five missionaries were speared to death at their camp. A search party the next day found no signs of a struggle, and the lookout who was to be stationed in a tree-house overlooking the camp at ground level had come down, so it appeared that the meeting had originally seemed friendly, and that the attack had been a surprise. Ed McCully's body was seen and identified, but was swept away by the river and not recovered. The other four, at the request of their wives, were buried at the site of the camp where they had died.\n\nThe effort to reach the Huaorani was not abandoned but rather intensified. Within three weeks, Johnny Keenan, another pilot of the Ecuador Mission, was continuing the flights over the Auca village. More than twenty fliers from the United States promptly applied to take Nate's place. More than 1000 college students volunteered for foreign missions in deirect response to the story of the Five Martyrs. In Ecuador, at the mission stations, attendance by Indians at schools and church services reached record levels, and the number of conversions skyrocketed. A Jivaro undertook to go at once to another Jivaro tribe that had been at war with his own tribe for years, bearing the Christian message, and his visit brought peace between the two tribes. Truly, as Tertullian said 1800 year ago, the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church.\n\nIn less than three years, Rachel Saint (sister of Nate Saint) and Elisabeth Elliot (widow of Jim Elliot) had not only renewed contact but had established permanent residence in a Huarani settlement, where they practised basic medicine and began the process of developing a written form of the language.\n\nWhy did the Huaorani suddenly turn hostile? Much later, one of the Huaorani who had helped to kill the five martyrs explained that the tribe, who had had almost no contact with outsiders that did not involve killing or attempted killing on one side or another, wondered why the whites wanted to make contact with them; and while they wanted to believe that their visitors were friendly, they feared a trap. After the killings, they realized their mistake. When they were attacked, one of the missionaries fired two shots as warnings, and one shot grazed a Huaorani who was hiding in the brush, unknown to the missionaries. It was therefore clear that the visitors had weapons, were capable of killing, and had chosen not to do so. Thus, the Huaorani realized that the visitors were indeed their friends, willing to die for them if necessary. When in subsequent months they heard the message that the Son of God had come down from heaven to reconcile men with God, and to die in order to bring about that reconciliation, they recognized that the message of the missionaries was the basis of what they had seen enacted in the lives of the missionaries. They believed the Gospel preached because they had seen the Gospel lived.\n\nPRAYER (traditional language):\n\nAlmighty God, who didst call thy faithful servants Nate Saint, Ed McCully, Jim Elliot, Peter Fleming, and Roger Youderian to be witnesses and martyrs to the Huaorani peoples in the rain forests of Ecuador, and by their labors and suffering didst raise up a people for thine own possession: Pour forth thy Holy Spirit upon thy Church in every land, that by the service and sacrifice of many, thy holy Name may be glorified and thy kingdom enlarged; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.\n\nPrecious in thy sight, O Lord, is the death of thy saints, Whose faithful witness, by thy providence, hath its great reward: We give thee thanks for thy martyrs Nate Saint, Ed McCully, Jim Elliot, Peter Fleming, and Roger Youderian, who purchased with their blood a hearing for the Gospel among the forest-dwellers of Ecuador, especially the Huaorani people, and for their wives, who shared with them in their work and witness; and we pray that with them we also may obtain the crown of righteousness which is laid up for all who love the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ; who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.\n\nPRAYER (contemporary language):\n\nAlmighty God, who called your faithful servants Nate Saint, Ed Mccully, Jim Elliot, Peter Fleming, and Roger Youderian to be witnesses and martyrs to the Huaorani peoples in the rain forests of Ecuador, and by their labors and suffering raised up a people for your own possession: Pour forth your Holy Spirit upon your Church in every land, that by the service and sacrifice of many, your holy Name may be glorified and your kingdom enlarged; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.\n\nPrecious in your sight, O Lord, is the death of your saints, Whose faithful witness, by your providence, has its great reward: We give you thanks for your martyrs Nate Saint, Ed McCully, Jim Elliot, Peter Fleming, and Roger Youderian, who purchased with their blood a hearing for the Gospel among the forest-dwellers of Ecuador, especially the Huaorani people, and for their wives, who shared with them in their work and witness; and we pray that with them we also may obtain the crown of righteousness which is laid up for all who love the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, this biographical sketch was written by James E.

They forget that they too are expending their lives \u2026 and when the bubble has burst, they will have nothing of eternal significance to show for the years they have wasted.\u201d \u2013 Nate Saint\n\nHis Early Life and Times\n\nNate Saint was born in 1923 near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The seventh of eight children, he was raised in a devout Christian home.\n\nLike many young men in the first half of the 20th century, he was fascinated with airplanes. In 1930, at the age of seven, one of his older brothers gave him a ride on a plane. Three years and some thrilling flights later, his brother let him take the controls on a flight. From that time on, he was fascinated, not only with airplanes; he became fascinated with flying.\n\nIn 1942, at the age of 19, Nate enlisted in the U.S. Army where he expected to become a pilot during World War II. Unfortunately, due to a lingering infection, the Army would not allow him to fly. Nate turned that into an opportunity to become an aviation mechanic. He learned valuable lessons in that position that he would use later.\n\nHis Unexpected Life in Aviation\n\nFollowing Nate\u2019s three years in the military, he obtained a commercial pilot\u2019s license and enrolled at Wheaton College. During that time, his father made him aware of the newly established Christian Airmen\u2019s Missionary Fellowship (CAMF) which eventually became the Mission Aviation Fellowship.\n\nThe MAF began transporting missionaries into hard-to-reach places in the jungles of Mexico, Peru, and Ecuador. While at Wheaton, Nate committed his life to serving the Lord as a missionary and missions pilot. He so with the understanding that the work would be dangerous. In one year alone, 51 people died in missionary plane crashes in the jungle. In 1948, Nate and his wife traveled to Ecuador to open an MAF base at Shell Mara.\n\nHis Eventful Life in Ecuador\n\nMissions work in Ecuador did not start well for the avid missionary pilot. In December of his first year, the plane he was piloting crashed after a powerful downforce of wind drove it into the ground. Nate suffered a broken back and other injuries that kept him in a body cast for six months.\n\nThe bulk of Nate\u2019s work was transporting missionaries to villages that would otherwise have taken many days to reach traveling on foot. Once they were in place, he delivered food and supplies for their sustenance and work. Often supplies included medicines and medical equipment they would use to treat illnesses in the tribes to which they ministered.\n\nNate solved one of the early problems in jungle missionary aviation while serving the Lord in Ecuador. Pilots would drop supplies in predetermined locations, but some supplies were destroyed when the hit the ground, and more ended up in the treetops of the jungle canopy. Nate devised a method of safely and efficiently lowering supplies using a bucket and a rope while circling overhead. Not only were the supplies delivered, but the missionaries were able to send messages and other items up to the plane using the device.\n\nNate described his life in Ecuador this way:\n\n\u201cIt is our task to lift these missionaries up off those rigorous, life-consuming, and morale-breaking jungle trails\u2014lift them up to where five minutes in a plane equals twenty-four hours on foot. The reason for all this is not a matter of bringing comfort to the missionaries. They don\u2019t go to the steaming, tropical jungles looking for comfort in the first place. It\u2019s a matter of gaining precious time, of redeeming days and weeks, months and even years that can be spent in giving the Word of Life to primitive people.\u201d[1]\n\nHis Eventual Loss in Ecuador\n\nNate and four other missionaries had developed a burden to reach the Aucas, a reclusive tribe of native Indians known to kill others found in their territory. The Ecuadorian government had been considering sending troops in to subdue the natives.\n\nNonetheless, Nate, Jim Elliot, Ed McCully, Peter Fleming, and Roger Youdarian began an effort to break through to the tribe. They started by making flights over the village, dropping gifts from pots and pans to trinkets. Having received what they considered a warm response, they determined that it was time to meet the Aucas in person.\n\nOn January 8, 1956, the five landed the plane on a strip of side alongside a river near the village. They were to make scheduled radio calls to their families back at the airfield compound, but no transmissions were ever made. The Aucas had massacred Nate and the others and left their bodies in the river and along the beach.\n\nThe story made major headlines, including an entire photo spread in Life magazine.\n\nHis Eternal Legacy\n\nJesus said that \u201ceven the gates of Hell shall not prevail\u201d against the Kingdom of God and His Church. Indeed, the spears of the Aucas could not. Instead of retreating in fear and defeat, the effort to reach the Aucas continued, including the personal ministry of Nate\u2019s son Steve and sister Ruth and Jim Elliot\u2019s wife Elisabeth, each of whom eventually lived with and ministered to the Aucas.\n\nTheir continued work has created an eternal legacy as many of the Aucas natives have accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior over the years, including six of the men who participated in the raid and killed Nate and his fellow missionaries.\n\nThe Indians told their families that they were puzzled at why the men did not fight but willingly gave up their lives. Their amazement opened the door for the women to tell them that the men were there to tell them about Jesus Christ who \u201cfreely allowed his own death\u201d to ransom them from sin and its inevitable price.\n\nRachel Saint spent the rest of her natural life with Wycliffe Bible Translators among the Aucas and is buried in Ecuador.\n\nKimo, the pastor of the tribe, requested the honor of baptizing Steve and Kathy, Nate\u2019s children, to demonstrate their reconciliation through Christ. The pastor had been a member of the killing party.\n\nGikita, the leader of the attack, died a believer at the age of 80. He said that he was \u201ceager to go to Heaven and live peacefully with the five men who came to tell them about Creator God.\u201d[2]\n\nAs Nate Saint said, \u201cWhen life\u2019s flight is over, and we unload our cargo at the other end, the fellow who got rid of unnecessary weight will have the most valuable cargo to present to the Lord.\u201d\n\n[1] Jungle Pilot: The Life and Witness of Nate Saint, Russell T.

He was accompanied by four others: Jim Elliot, Pete Fleming, Ed McCully, and Roger Youderain. All five were killed while attempting to evangelize the Huaorani people through efforts known as Operation Auca.\n\nEarly Life\n\nNate Saint was born in 1923. When he was seven he took his first plane ride with his brother Sam, who would eventually become a commercial pilot for American Airlines. While in the airplane he discovered a love of flying.\n\n\u200d\n\nHis family was somewhat unusual. His brothers made a sleeping patio on the roof of their home, and his dad built a roller coaster in the backyard.\n\n\u200d\n\nWhen he joined the army he was stationed in Las Vegas NV, but was transferred to several other locations over the years. A leg injury from a sledding accident caused him some problems while he was in the army. About a year before he was discharged, he almost died while climbing a mountain in Yosemite National Park. After that incident he learned to live life to the fullest.[1]\n\n\u200d\n\nWhen Nate was asked by a friend to fix a plane somewhere in Mexico, he finally agreed. After he repaired the plane, he discovered a need for his skill in the field of mission-work and also a new awareness of the value of missions. After going to Wheaton College, Nate married Marjorie Farris (commonly called Marj) in 1948 and eventually moved to Shell Mera, Ecuador. Here, Nate built his family a house which would also serve as a guesthouse and a radio center with the other missionaries.[2]\n\nLife in Ecuador, Meeting the Huaroni\n\nIn September 1955, Nate was joined by his teammates, Jim Elliot, Ed McCully, Pete Fleming, and Roger Youderian. Saint finally found a Huaorani settlement while searching by air. To reach the tribe, Saint and the team lowered gifts to the Huaorani in a bucket tied to the plane.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Huaorani were widely feared by other Ecuadorians, because they combined a desire to be left alone with a willingness to use force. They attacked and killed any intruders without provocation. Nevertheless, the tribe was excited on receiving the gifts and gave some gifts back.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the missionaries decided to try to meet the Huaorani on the ground; and, on January 3, 1956, using the beach as a landing strip, they set up camp four miles from the Huaorani settlement.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Nate Saint Died\n\nTheir initial contact was encouraging; however, on Sunday, January 8, 1956, the entire team was killed on the beach (known as \"Palm Beach\") when armed Huaorani met and speared them.[3] Nate Saint was the first of the five missionaries to be speared to death.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaint and the other four men became famous worldwide as a result. Life magazine published a 10-page photo essay on the story, which was also covered in Reader's Digest and many other publications. Today, a small school for missionary children in Shell, Ecuador, bears Nate Saint's name. After 51 years, the school has closed in 2017 due to falling enrollment.\n\n\n\n\n\nRachel Saint, Nate's sister, continued the mission efforts to the Huaorani, which eventually came to fruition. This resulted in many of these natives becoming Christians, including those who had killed Saint.[3]\n\n\n\n\n\nNate Saint's Family\n\nParents:\n\nLawrence Saint\n\nKatherine Saint\n\nSpouse:\n\nMarjorie Saint\u200d\n\nChildren:\n\nKathy Saint Drown\n\nSteve Saint\n\nPhilip Saint\n\nSiblings:\n\nRachel Saint\n\nSam Saint\n\nPhil Saint\n\nDan Saint\n\nDave Saint\n\nSteve Saint\n\nBen Saint\n\nRecommended Resources on Nate Saint\n\nNate Saint Movies\n\nNate Saint Books\n\nNate Saint Quotes\n\n\"People who do not know the Lord ask why in the world we waste our lives as missionaries.

Rachel Saint lived with the Huaroni two years after he died. She served as a missionary to Peru before later joining Nate in Ecuador. Nate had six brothers and one sister. Nate\u2019s father, Lawrence Saint, was a famous stain-glass artist, who worked on the Washington National Cathedral. His father was also a painter, specializing in landscape painting and silhouette cutting. As a kid, Nate built an 8-foot sailboat and took apart a car engine just to put it back together again.\n\nSources\n\nThis information is provided under the Wikipedia Creative Common License."}, {"url": "https://blogs.blueletterbible.org/blb/2012/01/09/suffering-sacrifice-and-the-death-of-jim-elliot/", "page_content": "You might be familiar with Jim Elliot\u2019s most famous quote:\n\n\u201cHe is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain that which he cannot lose.\u201d\n\nElliot is the most known out of five men who were killed on this day, January 8, 1956. The other four men are Nate Saint, Ed McCully, Roger Youderian, and Peter Fleming. These men were serving as missionaries to the Quichua Indians of Ecuador. Unwelcomed, they were brutally murdered by the Aucas themselves. Despite the tragedy, hundreds of Christians were inspired to become missionaries and thousands were moved to deeper commitment to Christ.\n\nJim Elliot and his wife Elisabeth worked together on translating the New Testament into the language of the Quichua Indians. Their daughter, Valerie, was born in 1955. Only ten months later, Jim was killed by the Huaorani Indians while attempting to take the gospel to that remote tribe. Elisabeth continued her work among the Quichuas and later lived and worked among the Huaorani.\n\nThe year after Jim died, Elisabeth wrote Through Gates of Splendor, a widely popular account of the team\u2019s mission and martyrdom. She writes in the thick of her mourning. Her words come straight from someone who was very involved in the tragic events that unfolded.

Jim along with Nate Saint, Ed McCully, Peter Fleming, and Roger Youderian were committed to the Lord Jesus Christ and the propagation of the gospel among the unreached Auca Indians, more properly referred to as the Huaorani, in Ecuador. On this date all five men were martyred, leaving behind wives and families. As tragic as this was, in the wake of these deaths and in the providence of God, many were drawn/called to missions. It is a true yet often unexplainable way God works. Like Jesus, the Master, the gospel advances through death \u2013 certainly spiritual and at times physical.\n\nAll of these men played an important role in this ministry. Jim appeared to have a more prominent role, not because of importance but because of his pen through which he was able to write simple yet profound truths. Those statements came to light through Elisabeth Elliot, Jim\u2019s wife, who wrote two books in particular that the Lord used, and continues to use: Through Gates of Splendor and Shadow of the Almighty: The Life and Testament of Jim Elliot. Many of us have been touched and moved by those statements. For Jim these were words that bore witness in his life. For those of us who are moved by those words he uttered, it is easy for those words to remain great quotes without it being reflective of our lives. This reminds us that truth must not remain vicarious, i.e. truth for someone else, but it must be personally appropriated.\n\nThe Lord used these books, these incredible accounts of living all of life to the glory of God with heart, soul mind and strength, significantly in my life many years ago as a young believer seeking to take the Lord Jesus Christ\u2019s commands for discipleship seriously. He still uses them today.
