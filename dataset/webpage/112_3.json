Harris declined that offer. \u201cI just thought it was a publicity stunt,\u201d she said in the documentary. \u201cAnd I felt like, I didn\u2019t think I was good enough.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019s male counterparts in basketball became household names. She faded from public memory.\n\nHarris was clear when we interviewed her for the documentary: She did not regret passing up the N.B.A. opportunity offered to her, and focusing instead on starting a family. (She went on to have four children.) But afterward, her options as a Black woman athlete were limited. She landed an assistant\u2019s job coaching the women\u2019s team at Delta State; she said she had applied for the head job but was passed over in favor of a high school basketball coach, a white man.\n\nIt would be nice to say that America, 50 years after the passage of Title IX, has come a long way from the days when Harris reigned on the basketball court.

Salary-wise, the lowest paid man playing in the N.B.A. still makes more than the highest paid woman playing in the W.N.B.A. At an event last month remembering Harris and her legacy, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, the retired pro basketball player and an executive producer of \u201cThe Queen of Basketball,\u201d called out the disparity that endures today. \u201cCertain guys that are not worth it are making $40 million,\u201d while women are making far less, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nEvery year, it feels like a new inequality comes to light between the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams in college basketball \u2014 at last year\u2019s N.C.A.A. basketball tournament it was the weight rooms, where men\u2019s basketball got to work out in a fitness palace, while the women appeared only to have hand weights. One study found that men\u2019s basketball teams spent twice as much as their female counterparts on nontravel meals.

She made her Broadway debut in the 1972 revival of Much Ado About Nothing and appeared in her first film in 1976 in All the President's Men. For her role in the 1984 film Places in the Heart, she received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Her other films include Slap Shot (1977), Between the Lines (1977), The Verdict (1982), Prefontaine (1997), and The Insider (1999). She also had a leading role in the 1987 film House of Games, which was directed by her then-husband David Mamet. In 1996, she received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for \"Between Mother and Daughter\", an episode of CBS Schoolbreak Special. She is also a Grammy Award nominee.\n\nEarly life\n\nCrouse was born in New York City, the daughter of Anna (n\u00e9e Erskine; 1916\u20132014) and Russel Crouse, a playwright. Her maternal grandparents were Pauline (Ives) and author and educator John Erskine. Her full name\u2014Lindsay Ann Crouse\u2014is an intentional tribute to the Broadway writing partnership of Lindsay and Crouse, which consisted of her father and his writing partner, Howard Lindsay. The two wrote much of The Sound of Music. Their 1946 play State of the Union won that year's Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Their last collaboration was Mr. President in 1962. \"In our family, the work ethic was held up as some kind of byword,\" Crouse says. \"At any hour, somebody's typewriter was going.\"\n\nActing career\n\nAfter graduating from the Chapin School in 1966 and Radcliffe College in 1970, Crouse began her performing career as a modern and jazz dancer, but she soon switched to acting and made her Broadway debut in Much Ado About Nothing in 1972.\n\nCrouse's film career began in 1976, with small roles in television and theatrical movies. In 1977, she appeared as Lily Braden, the discontented wife of hockey player Ned Braden in Slap Shot. Crouse was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in the 1984 movie Places in the Heart. Among her films was a starring role in House of Games, the 1987 film directed and written by her then-husband David Mamet, in which she plays Margaret Ford, a psychiatrist who is intrigued by the art of the con. \"It's always hard to be directed by someone who's close to you,\" Crouse says. \"Because everybody needs to go home and complain about the director. Everybody.\"\n\nCrouse has appeared in featured and guest roles in a number of television series. Notable roles include a recurring portrayal of Kate McBride, a lesbian police officer on Hill Street Blues during its sixth season in 1986, one of the earliest appearances of a lesbian character in a major American TV show. Crouse is also known for her role in the fourth season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, where she was a recurring supporting cast member playing Professor Maggie Walsh. Crouse has also guest-starred on Alias, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Columbo, Criminal Minds, Law & Order, ER, Millennium, and NYPD Blue.\n\nIn recent years, Crouse has concentrated on the theater. \"Once you get your driver's license, you end your film career,\" says Crouse. \"Look at my generation. Great actresses like Glenn Close and Susan Sarandon\u2014there's nothing written for anyone over a certain age.\" In 2007, Crouse opened a revival of The Belle of Amherst, a one-woman show about the life of poet Emily Dickinson, at the Gloucester Stage in Gloucester, Massachusetts. \"You can't stop and recite something,\" says Crouse. \"You have to keep the poetry very, very active, which is pretty easy with Dickinson. She was striving so hard to understand what life was about. It's very dramatic poetry in that way.\n\nCrouse appeared in Lee Blessing's Going to St. Ives with the Gloucester Stage Company during the summer of 2008 and provided the narration for Virginia Lee Burton: A Sense of Place, a documentary film about Virginia Lee Burton.\n\nPersonal life\n\nCrouse married playwright David Mamet in 1977. Crouse caught Mamet's eye in the hockey comedy Slap Shot. When he heard she had a part in his play Reunion at the Yale Repertory Theater, Mamet packed a bag and told a friend, \"I'm going to New Haven to marry Lindsay Crouse.\" When the two did indeed wed, Crouse's mother took her aside and told her what Oscar Hammerstein had told her when she married Russel Crouse: \"A playwright's wife is the only woman who knows how her husband feels when she's having a baby.\"\n\nJohn Lahr writes in his book Show and Tell: New Yorker Profiles that when Mamet married Crouse in 1977, he \"married into show business aristocracy.\" Lahr also writes that Mamet got his first screenwriting assignment through Crouse. Crouse was on her way to audition for Bob Rafelson's 1981 remake of The Postman Always Rings Twice and Mamet told Crouse to tell Rafelson that \"he was a fool if he didn't hire me to write the screenplay.\" Although Mamet was joking, Crouse did it and Rafelson called Mamet and asked Mamet why he should hire him for the screenplay. \"Because I'll give you a good screenplay or a sincere apology,\" said Mamet. Mamet got the job.\n\nCrouse and Mamet have two daughters, Willa and Zosia. They divorced in 1990. Crouse is now married to Rick Blue.\n\nCrouse's brother is Timothy Crouse, author of The Boys on the Bus about political journalism during the 1972 presidential campaign. Timothy Crouse also co-authored a new libretto for the musical Anything Goes with John Weidman that opened at the Vivian Beaumont Theater on Broadway on October 19, 1987, and ran for 784 performances.\n\nBuddhist beliefs\n\nCrouse is a Buddhist and a direct student of Sumati Marut. In 2005, she organized an annual Buddhist educational program, originally held at the Windhover Center for the Performing Arts in Rockport, Massachusetts, and then in 2010 moved to The Governor's Academy in Byfield, Massachusetts. \"[Buddhism] is not an exclusive club. It has something to offer everyone at all levels,\" says Crouse. \"Buddhism is dynamic and has captured the interests of Americans. Even our quantum physics validate[s] ideas the Buddha taught 2,500 years ago.\""}], "Lindsay Crouse was raised in Scarsdale.": [{"url": "https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/lindsay_crouse", "page_content": "Highest Rated: 97% House of Games (1987)\n\nLowest Rated: 18% Bye Bye, Love (1995)\n\nBirthday: May 12, 1948\n\nBirthplace: New York, New York, USA\n\nAn excellent character actress of the 1970s, 80s and 90s, Crouse had established herself as an outstanding off-Broadway actress in such roles as Ophelia opposite William Hurt's \"Hamlet\" and Viola in \"Twelfth Night; she won an Obie in her then-husband David Mamet's \"Reunion\" in 1980.

And she\u2019s even named after her father\u2019s writing partner, Howard Lindsay.\n\nIn addition to \u201cLife With Father,\u201d the Crouse-Lindsay team was responsible for such archly American standards as \u201cState of the Union\u201d (1945), \u201cCall Me Madam\u201d (1950) and \u201cMr. President,\u201d as well as the books for the musicals \u201cAnything Goes\u201d (1934) and \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d (1959).\n\nBut for all the legacy she carries in her name, Lindsay Crouse has never performed in one of her late father\u2019s plays--until now, that is. She appears in journalist-playwright Sidney Blumenthal\u2019s adaptation of \u201cState of the Union,\u201d which kicks off the L.A. Theatre Works season of live radio theater at the Doubletree Guest Suites hotel in Santa Monica on Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemembered by many as a 1948 movie featuring Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, the 1946 Pulitzer-winning play is a comedy about a presidential candidate, his estranged wife and a newspaper publisher who is also vying for the man\u2019s affections. It\u2019s pointedly political, filled with thinly veiled allusions to the events of the day.\n\nFor Lindsay Crouse, though, the political is also personal. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to be learned about [my father] from working on his plays,\u201d the actress says during a recent conversation at her Westside home. \u201cIt tells me both that it was a different world that he inhabited and that his attitude toward it was quite amazing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a naivete about government [and] politics in the play which doesn\u2019t exist anymore, but which is still valuable because there\u2019s a tremendous longing for it, for a kind of leadership that cuts through this massive weight of bureaucracy, party politics, self-interest and big business,\u201d she continues.\n\n\u201cThese plays are lifted up by a kind of buoyancy and renewal. I wonder whether we think that\u2019s possible now.\u201d\n\n*\n\nBorn to onetime journalist Crouse and his wife, Anna, who was 25 years his junior, Lindsay Crouse grew up in a New York household frequented by the likes of Fredric March, Edna Ferber, Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein, Irving Berlin and many others. The family living room functioned as a kind of salon, where the composers, lyricists and performers would often gather and try out their latest songs and other material.\n\n\u201cLooking back on it now, it seems like a time of amazing accomplishments,\u201d Crouse says. \u201cI envy the bubbling up of life that was always happening in this wonderful group of people.\n\n\u201cAnd these guys had so much fun!\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd the fun and the hopefulness and the humanity are in the plays.\u201d\n\n\u201cState of the Union,\u201d which was a hit when it opened on Broadway, was written before Lindsay Crouse was born, during the year in which President Roosevelt died and Harry S. Truman assumed the Oval Office.\n\nThe play\u2019s events, however, allude to Wendell Willkie, the utility company head who became the surprise Republican candidate for president in 1940. \u201cThis is a play about a businessman who is a dark-horse candidate,\u201d says Blumenthal, a widely known author-commentator and political correspondent for the New Yorker. \u201cHis appeal is not only that he speaks his mind, but that he\u2019s outside of politics.\u201d\n\nSo, with an enduring type like that as its central figure, it\u2019s easy to see why \u201cState of the Union\u201d remains viable. \u201cThe political motivations really come out in high relief when you make the play contemporary, which shows how vital the play is,\u201d Blumenthal says. \u201cThe sensibilities, mores, references and many things in politics change, but a good deal about this endures.\u201d\n\nLindsay Crouse didn\u2019t get around to reading \u201cState of the Union\u201d until she was a teenager, not long before her father died in 1966. But she never discussed this particular work with him.\n\n\u201cI talked to him a lot about theater and was constantly at the theater seeing things that he wrote, but I don\u2019t remember talking with him specifically about his playwriting,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really old enough to be having those kinds of talks with him.\u201d\n\nCrouse went on to study choreography at Harvard. Afterward, she returned to New York and took up her acting career, working at respected off-Broadway theaters such as Circle Repertory and Yale Repertory during the \u201870s.\n\nDuring the late \u201870s and throughout the \u201880s, Crouse worked in both theater and movies. Her films include \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men\u201d (1976), \u201cThe Verdict\u201d (1982) and \u201cPlaces in the Heart\u201d (1984), for which she received an Academy Award nomination.\n\nIn 1992, Crouse, who is now in her 40s, moved to Los Angeles, prompted in part by her divorce from playwright David Mamet. She became a founding member of the Matrix Theatre in 1993, but since then has been concentrating on film and TV to be home at night with her daughters, now 14 and 8 years old.\n\nYet the more Crouse works, the more she misses the kind of women\u2019s roles her father and Lindsay wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see in what regard women were held in the \u201840s,\u201d she says. \u201cWomen were not in the same position they are now, but there\u2019s a lot of wonderful writing for women--and for women who were not 20--at that time.\u201d\n\nNowadays, it\u2019s a vastly different story. \u201cWomen are unbelievably muzzled at this time in this culture,\u201d Crouse says. \u201cIn the parts I receive, the women are assigned powerful positions--executives, lawyers or whatever--but they\u2019re not given much to do. They don\u2019t have the real force behind them to create change.\u201d\n\n* \u201cState of the Union,\u201d L.A.

He named the lands after his ancestral home in Derbyshire, England. The first local census of 1712 counted twelve inhabitants, including seven African-American slaves. When Caleb died in 1721, his daughters inherited the property. The estate was broken up in 1774 and the town was officially founded on March 7, 1788.\n\nThe town saw fighting during the American Revolution when the Continental and British armies clashed briefly at what is now the junction of Garden Road and Mamaroneck Road. The British commander, Sir William Howe, lodged at a farmhouse on Garden Road that remains standing. Scarsdale's wartime history formed the basis for James Fenimore Cooper's novel, The Spy, written while the author lived at the Angevine Farm in the present-day Heathcote section of town. 1790-1945\n\n\n\nAccording to the first federal census in 1790, the town's population was 281. By 1840, that number had declined to 255\u2014the vast majority farmers and farm workers. In 1846, the New York and Harlem Railroad connected Scarsdale to New York City, leading to an influx of commuters.\n\nThe Arthur Suburban Home Company purchased an 150-acre (0.61 km2) farm in 1891 and converted it into a subdevelopment of one-family dwellings, starting a transformation of the community from rural to suburban. Civil institutions soon appeared: the Heathcote Association (1904), the Town Club (1904), the Scarsdale Women's Club (1918) and the Scarsdale League of Women Voters (1921). Scarsdale High School and Greenacres Elementary School were built in 1917 and the Edgewood Elementary School opened in 1918. The first store in Scarsdale opened on the corner of Popham Road and Garth Road in 1912. By 1915, the population approached 3000. By 1930, that number approached 10,000.\n\nIn 1940, German agent Gerhardt Alois Westrick secretly met with American business leaders at his Scarsdale home until public pressure drove his family from the community. 1945-present\n\nScarsdale became the subject of national controversy in the 1950s when a \"Committee of Ten\" led by Otto Dohrenwend alleged \"Communist infiltration\" in the public schools.[5] A thorough investigation by the town rejected these claims. This same group, known at the Scarsdale Citizens Committee, sued to prevent a benefit for the Freedom Riders from taking place at the public high school in 1963 because some of the performers (Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Pete Seeger) were allegedly \"communist sympathizers and subversives.\"\n\nAnother controversy enveloped the town in 1961, when the Scarsdale Country Club, headed by Charles S. McCallister, refused to allow a young man who had converted from Judaism into the Episcopal Church to escort a young woman to her debut at the club. It was the club's policy, at the time, to prohibit Jews from the premises. In response, Rev. George French Kempsell of the Church of Saint James the Less announced that he would ban any supporters of the club's decision from receiving holy communion.The event marked a turning point toward the decline of anti-Semitism in the town.\n\nScarsdale's public library, which had been housed in historic Wayside Cottage since 1928, moved to its present structure on the White Plains Post Road in 1951.[8] The driving force behind the library was New York City publisher S. Spencer Scott, who raised $100,000 for the project after the village rejected a bond issue to fund the building in 1938. The new library opened with 27,000 books and Sylvia C. Hilton serving as the first librarian.\n\nThe last of the town's five elementary schools, Heathcote School, opened in 1954. The $1,000,000 architectural landmark was designed by Perkins & Will of Chicago. Walter B. Cocking, the president of the New York State Committee for the Public Schools, delivered the dedication address.\n\nIn 1967, former longtime resident Dean Rusk returned to Scarsdale at the height of the Vietnam War to receive the town's Man of the Year Award and was greeted with a silent protest.\n\nScarsdale was the subject of a landmark United States Supreme Court decision, ACLU v Scarsdale (1985), that established the so-called \"reindeer rule\" regarding public nativity scenes and upheld the right of local religious groups to place cr\u00e8ches on public property. Historians\n\nThe first official historian of the Village of Scarsdale was Richard Lederer. He was succeeded by Irving J. Sloan. On the death of Sloan in 2009, Eric Rothschild assumed the position of village historian. Geography\n\n\n\nThe neighborhoods within the village of Scarsdale are:\n\nArthur Manor (Edgewood Elementary); Berkley in Scarsdale (Edgewood and Fox Meadow Elementary); Bramlee Heights (Fox Meadow Elementary); Colonial Acres (Quaker Ridge Elementary); Drake Edgewood (Edgewood Elementary); East Heathcote (Heathcote Elementary); Fox Meadow (Fox Meadow Elementary); Greenacres (Greenacres Elementary); Murray Hill/Middle Heathcote (Heathcote Elementary); Old Scarsdale (Fox Meadow Elementary); Overhill (Fox Meadow Elementary); Quaker Ridge (Quaker Ridge Elementary); Scarsdale Meadows (Quaker Ridge Elementary); Secor Farms (Quaker Ridge Elementary); Sherbrooke Farms (Heathcote Elementary); West Quaker Ridge (Quaker Ridge Elementary); School system\n\nThe Scarsdale Union Free School District operates five elementary schools in the elementary school districts Edgewood, Fox Meadow, Greenacres, Heathcote and Quaker Ridge made up of parts of the neighborhood associations above, as well as Scarsdale Middle School and Scarsdale High School.\n\n\n\nPeople associated with Scarsdale include: Television, film, music and radio personalities\n\n* Bruce Beck, television sportscaster for WNBC-TV. * Joan Bennett, Hollywood actress from the 1930s and 40's once owned a home on Chase Road North. * Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z * Aaron Brown, former host of CNN'sNewsNight with Aaron Brown once resided in Scarsdale * Dorothy Dalton, silent-film actress. * Lisa Donovan, (LisaNova) YouTube celebrity and former featured cast member of MadTV, graduated from Scarsdale High School in 1998. * L B Fisher, born in Scarsdale and acted on popular shows such as Felicity, ER, Boston Public * Will Hawkins, singer-songwriter and playwright attended SHS from 1981 until 1985. * Rupert Holmes, composer and writer, once resided in Scarsdale. * Al Jolson, 30's film star owned a house on Fenimore Rd. in Scarsdale. * Joseph Kaiser, opera, theater, and film actor, grew up in Scarsdale. * David Lascher, sitcom actor from such shows as Hey Dude, Blossom, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, and Beverly Hills, 90210, was born and raised in Scarsdale. * Susan Lucci, born in Scarsdale and the star of soap TV series All My Children as well as many other notable films and television shows. * Linda McCartney, actress, writer, cinematographer, producer, photographer, and wife of Beatles star Paul McCartney, attended Scarsdale High School * Liza Minnelli, singer and actress, lived in Scarsdale with her mother, Judy Garland and attended Scarsdale High School.

Howard Lindsay (b. March 29, 1889, Waterford, New York, U.S.\u2014d. February 11, 1968, New York, New York) and Russel Crouse (b. February 20, 1893, Findlay, Ohio, U.S.\u2014d. April 3, 1966, New York, New York) were notable both for their continual successes and for the way they complemented each other\u2019s talents.\n\nPrior to meeting Crouse, Lindsay had already gained experience as an actor, director, and playwright, traveling for 42 weeks in the production of Polly of the Circus. Crouse\u2019s early experience was primarily journalistic, although he did write a libretto for The Gang\u2019s All Here (1931), which ran for only two weeks. He also wrote several nostalgic books in the early 1930s about 19th-century America.\n\nWhile trying to salvage a play in 1933, producer Vinton Freedley paired the talents of Lindsay and Crouse. The result was Anything Goes (1934) and a partnership that was to expand and mature over the following years. Their longest-playing drama was a 1939 production based on Clarence Day\u2019s book Life with Father, which ran for 7 1/2 years (3,213 performances) and in which Lindsay played Father opposite his real-life wife, Dorothy Stickney. When Lindsay and Crouse were offered Arsenic and Old Lace in 1940, they tried their hands at theatrical production, and the result was another success. In 1946 the pair won the Pulitzer Prize in drama for State of the Union (1945), which was a satire of American politics. Sections of this play were rewritten every day to correspond to actual events. They also wrote the libretto for the play The Sound of Music (1959).\n\nLindsay and Crouse\u2019s work had a universal appeal, created by a blend of Lindsay\u2019s theatrical knowledge and Crouse\u2019s sharp wit. Together they had a gift for transforming ideas into extremely popular musicals and plays."}, {"url": "https://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/lindsay-crouse/credits/3000540186/", "page_content": "Join or Sign In\n\nSign in to customize your TV listings\n\nContinue with Facebook\n\nContinue with email\n\nBy joining TV Guide, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lindsay_Crouse", "page_content": "Dear Wikiwand AI, let's keep it short by simply answering these key questions:\n\nCan you list the top facts and stats about Lindsay Crouse?\n\nSummarize this article for a 10 years old"}, {"url": "https://www.bostonirish.com/arts/2018/lindsay-crouse-%E2%80%98dancing-lughnasa%E2%80%99", "page_content": "BY R. J. DONOVAN\n\nSPECIAL TO THE BIR\n\nLindsay Crouse comes from theatrical royalty. The Oscar-nominated actress and educator is the daughter of Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Russel Crouse.\n\nFrom 1935 to 1962, Mr. Crouse and his writing partner, Howard Lindsay, collaborated on such classic Broadway comedies and musicals as \u201cLife With Father,\u201d \u201cThe Sound of Music,\u201d \u201cState of the Union\u201d and \u201cAnything Goes.\u201d Her name is a tribute to that iconic partnership.\n\nMs. Crouse\u2019s equally impressive credits include performances in \u201cPlaces in the Heart,\u201d \u201cAll The President\u2019s Men,\u201d \u201cThe Verdict,\u201d \u201cHouse of Games,\u201d and more.\n\nFor the past 12 summers, she has been a member of Gloucester Stage Company, where from June 8 to July 8 she will be appearing in Brian Friel\u2019s \u201cDancing at Lughnasa.\u201d\n\nWhat her fans may not know is that she\u2019s been living in Gloucester for most of her life.\n\nJust before Lindsay was born, the Crouses were enticed into visiting the area by family friends. Her Mom, Anna, loved old houses and found one in dire need of a little love. For $15,000, the Crouses purchased a 17-room Victorian residence with 30 acres of land.\n\nNow in her own vintage home, Crouse says she adores the picturesque town and calls Gloucester her \u201csoul home.\u201d\n\nIn New York, the Crouses lived in a whirl of famous names and faces, among them Irving Berlin, Ethel Merman, and Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein.\n\n\u201cTo grow up in a house of a writer is very different than growing up in the house of a celebrity actor,\u201d she said during a recent interview. \u201cWe had the most extraordinary people in and out of our house, but my father was a very humble and a very real guy. There was no fuss made if Frederick March came through the door. There was no fuss made if Mary Martin sang at the piano.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cThey were working craftsmen, all of them. Hard working! They didn\u2019t make a fuss over themselves. I grew up in the atmosphere of that hard-working creativity . . . I think that stood me in good stead.\u201d\n\nCrouse\u2019s connection with Gloucester Stage began more than a dozen years ago when the artistic director asked if there was a play she\u2019d be interested in doing. Her children were still in school at the time and her summers were a time for rest, so she declined.\n\nHowever, when Eric C. Engle became the director, he asked again. With her kids \u201csprung,\u201d Crouse considered the offer more seriously. \u201cI had loved \u2018The Belle of Amherst\u2019 ever since I had seen Julie Harris do it on Broadway,\u201d she said, \u201cand out of my mouth came, \u2018I\u2019d like to do The Belle of Amherst.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith a laugh, she continued: \u201cI remember when he left I thought, \u2018Oh my God!\u2019 This is a 91-page play and you\u2019re the only one on stage. How the hell are you going to do this?\u201d\n\nSuch was the beginning of a beautiful relationship with Gloucester Stage. \u201cI\u2019ve been very fortunate,\u201d said Crouse. \u201cIt\u2019s been wonderful.\u201d\n\n\u201cDancing at Lughnasa\u201d is a memory play, set in 1936 Donegal and focused on five unmarried sisters who live under the weight of poverty and financial insecurity. Their repetitive lives exist within a restrictive patriarchal system. But when a radio suddenly comes into their home, their world changes.\n\n\u201cLughnasa\u201d debuted at Dublin\u2019s Abbey Theater in 1990. Productions followed in London and on Broadway, where it won the Tony for Best Play.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary piece,\u201d said Crouse. \u201cYou rarely find a play with this many rich and interesting female parts . . . They call Brian Friel the Irish Chekhov and in a way that\u2019s quite apt, I think, in that he really knows how to celebrate a life lived on a very small scale, in a very limited area. But these women are huge souls and the play is poetic and magnificent. Just so moving. Very, very rich.\u201d\n\nCrouse plays Kate, the oldest sister and breadwinner. \u201cKate \u201crepresents the struggle of formal Catholicism versus the wonderful pagan traditions of Ireland,\u201d she said, \u201cthe Lughnasa festival itself \u2013 the ceremony of the first harvest.\u201d\n\nDuring the festival, tradition dictates that the father of each family cut the first sheaf of wheat and proceed through a series of rituals. Then the wheat is ground to make cakes.\n\n\u201cBonfires would be lit all night long,\u201d said Crouse. \u201cPeople would dance, they would drink, they would contract marriages and worse. It was a riotous evening at the height of summer.\u201d\n\nShe has done a lot of historical research to get a sense of what the sisters would have been experiencing in 1936. \u201cThe famine was [ongoing] in 1845 so their grandparents would have felt the effects of it big time. The word famine doesn\u2019t really describe it; it was a holocaust . . . The house they live in is more like a glorified hut. They\u2019re dividing between them a couple of tomatoes and a couple of eggs for dinner . . . They\u2019re very much living on the edge.\u201d\n\nFriel\u2019s own mother and aunts inspired the story. And if audiences fear \u201cLughnasa\u201d will be a depressing experience, Crouse points out, \u201cIt\u2019s a play that has a lot of sadness in it, but it also has a lot of beauty and it\u2019s very funny, actually. Their longings are really universal. Here is a family in the midst of very difficult times and their spirit is so extraordinary. The lyricism of this play really lifts them above it.\u201d\n\nCrouse recalls \u201ca great playwright, I can\u2019t remember who it was, saying the theater is a safe place to do the unsafe things that need to be done. I feel that way about this play. To talk about . . . the really tough aspects of life . . . They\u2019re a beautiful family, and there is a gorgeous female energy over the play that\u2019s lovely . . . I\u2019m thrilled to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nR. J.

Enter Email Sign Up\n\nCrouse: I\u2019ve spent a long time reporting on women\u2019s sports and trying to cover them in unusual ways, whether it\u2019s exposing the punishments women athletes face for having children or just helping bring excellent women athletes\u2019 profiles before a mainstream audience. There was never really a job on those themes for me to apply to, so I came up with how I wanted to do it myself, doing stories that I hoped would resonate with readers like me (especially because I\u2019m an athlete myself). Lucy Harris\u2019s story fit right into that.\n\nWe produced her story as part of a documentary series I came up with as an experiment with Breakwater Studios about people who were incredibly talented and on the cusp of making history, but were forgotten for any number of reasons \u2013 obviously that premise applies to so much of women\u2019s sports. It\u2019s hard to get historical stories, especially in a documentary, to echo in ways that make people think about the world around them right now, but in this case, the resonance with barriers that contemporary female athletes face was clear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQ: I feel like every college athlete should be required to study Lusia Harris\u2019s career. Luckily, the award comes at a perfect time because we\u2019re gearing up for what looks to be a really competitive women\u2019s Final Four. What\u2019s something you learned about during the making of the documentary that everyone should know?\n\nCrouse: I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever heard directly from a woman who was at the center of the revolutionary changes to women\u2019s sports in America that were unfolding 50 years ago, at the dawn of Title IX (which granted women and girls equal opportunities in school sports to those enjoyed by boys and men). It was interesting to learn that Lucy made her women\u2019s team so good that the women\u2019s basketball team at her small Mississippi school flew in planes to their games, while the less competitive men\u2019s team took buses.\n\nYou rarely hear of women\u2019s teams leading the way, or getting resources that reflect their superiority. It contradicts the tired argument that \u201cnobody wants to watch women play.\u201d Of course they do \u2013 we just have to tell the stories with the same level of quality we tell stories about men.\n\nQ: Shaq and Steph Curry were executive producers of the documentary. How much were they involved in the day-to-day of the project and what was it like to work with them?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrouse: They were incredible promoters of Lucy Harris\u2019s story. I hope what they did for \u201cThe Queen of Basketball\u201d can wind up being a model for how male athletes with outstanding platforms \u2014 or any powerful men whose power has grown in systems that were optimized for them to succeed \u2014 can use their audiences to bring attention to extraordinary, but lesser known, women. Sharing the love lifts everyone up.\n\nQ: You grew up in South Kingstown, went to Harvard, and now have won an Oscar at The New York Times. What\u2019s the Rhode Island-related documentary you\u2019d just love to work on?\n\nCrouse: The Pulitzer prize-winning novelist Jhumpa Lahiri graduated from my high school several years ahead of me; her mother was my teacher\u2019s aide when I was an elementary student at South Road School in Wakefield. I\u2019ve never met Lahiri, but have always admired her, and was surprised there wasn\u2019t more of a shrine to her in my high school \u2013 I just remember a small plaque with her name on it in a corner of our library, which I would look at and think, we should be shouting her name from the rooftops! with everything she\u2019s achieved.\n\nHer writing gave me a new lens for thinking about my hometown, for good and bad, as has following some of her family\u2019s experiences in the town when they\u2019ve been in the news. In keeping with the themes of her books, I think that story would make a powerful foundation for a look at the modern American town (and about how they are changing \u2013 as well as how they aren\u2019t). I\u2019d love to know more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis story first appeared in Rhode Map, our free newsletter about Rhode Island that also contains information about local events, data about the coronavirus in the state, and more.
