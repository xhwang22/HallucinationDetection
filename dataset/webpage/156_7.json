The British series found success on ITV in the United Kingdom and PBS in the United States, building up a large fanbase. During those five years, it won numerous awards, was critically acclaimed, and rejuvenated the historical drama genre in a way that no one expected.\n\nThe sixth and final season brought to a close many of the storylines that had been brewing in the Yorkshire country estate since the first episode. But there was still enough interest from fans to continue the story in a 2019 film, as well as \"Downton Abbey: A New Era\" in 2022.\n\nWhether or not these films will prove to be the final curtain call for the cast, fans still have plenty of opportunities to see the actors in a variety of other projects. Since \"Downton Abbey\" ended in 2015, most of the main cast has continued to have success on screen and on stage. Here's what everyone from the show has done since the series finale aired."}, {"url": "https://factsverse.com/how-each-leave-it-to-beaver-cast-member-died/", "page_content": "Did you grow up watching the great American sitcom Leave it to Beaver? It was one of the best sitcoms in American history and told the story of the All-American family, revolving around young Beaver Cleaver.\n\nIt takes us back to an America that many of us miss and like to relive as we watch reruns of the show.\n\nSadly, many of our favorite actors and actresses from the show have now passed away. Luckily, the immortality of television lets us remember their talents.\n\nLet\u2019s look back on their remarkable lives and careers as we reminisce about Leave it to Beaver and its\u2019 impact on American culture.\n\nThe head of the Cleaver family was Ward Cleaver, played by Hugh Beaumont. Hugh Beaumont was originally from Lawrence, Kansas and went on to become a football star at the University of Chattanooga in Tennessee.\n\nHe later received a master\u2019s degree in Theology at the University of Southern California. Upon his graduation, he began his career as a clergyman and a lay minister. No doubt he would entertain his congregations, and this prepared him for an acting career.\n\nHe began his acting career by participating in a \u201cGateway to Hollywood\u201d competition. While this brought him more acting gigs, at the time he wanted to prioritize his ecclesiastical duties over his acting work.\n\nIn fact, at times he felt that his acting work might conflict with his ideals as a man of God. Nevertheless, he continued taking acting gigs making his name in many B-movies during the 1940s.\n\nHowever, the role of a lifetime came when he cast as Ward Cleaver in the 1950s sitcom Leave it to Beaver. Americans could relate to Ward as the All-American dad who took care of his family and provided many of the show\u2019s best laughs.\n\nHe continued to have bit parts in TV shows following the end of Leave it to Beaver. Unfortunately, in 1972 he suffered a stroke that made him take fewer roles. It was during this time that he showed off his writing chops. And managing to sell several radio and TV scripts to producers.\n\nHe passed away from a heart attack in 1982 while visiting his son Eric in Germany.\n\nThey say behind every great man there\u2019s a great woman. Behind Ward Cleaver, there was his wife June played by the inimitable Barbara Billingsley. Like Hugh Beaumont, she lived a full life before delving into her role as June Cleaver.\n\nShe had worked as a model and had spent much of her time as a single mother. These experiences made her perfect to play the loving mother on Leave it to Beaver.\n\nShe landed the role after having bit parts in films such as \u201cThe Bad and the Beautiful\u201d and \u201cThree Guys named Mike.\u201d June adored by Leave it to Beaver fans for her role as June and after the show ended, she had bit parts that were quite similar to her role as the All-American mom!\n\nShe died of polymyalgia at the age of 94 at her home in Santa Monica, California.\n\nBefore we tell you more about how each Leave it to Beaver cast member died, please like this video and subscribe to our channel for more current news and interesting stories. Now, back to the video\u2026\n\nOf course, not all the characters in the show were entirely wholesome! After all, each show needs at least one troublemaker to add some conflict and heighten the laughter.\n\nThe troublemaker in Leave it to Beaver came in the form of Eddie Haskell played by Ken Osmond. Eddie Haskell was Wally Cleaver\u2019s best friend and was responsible for the gang getting into trouble.\n\nIt seems as if Ken Osmond destined to be an actor from day one. He began his acting career at age 9, when he had a part in the film \u201cSo Big\u201d starring Sterling Hayden and Jane Wyman.\n\nThis led to a series of bit parts in major films. He also had exposure to acting roles in television early on. He had roles on shows such as \u201cThe Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet,\u201d and \u201cThe Loretta Young Show.\u201d\n\nIn 1957, he was asked to audition for \u201cEddie Haskell,\u201d who would be a one-off character in a new show called Leave it to Beaver. Ken Osmond had to partake in several auditions before he landed the role. It seemed as if Eddie Haskell would only last for one episode and that Ken would have to continue looking for work elsewhere.\n\nYet audiences loved Eddie Haskell. He eventually became one of the regular characters on the show. Eddie Haskell was the role that defined Ken Osmond.\n\nAfter the show ended, he continued to be typecast in similar roles. He took a long break from writing and worked as a police officer for the Los Angeles Police Department. After retiring from policing, he returned to acting and had a few bit parts in films and TV shows. He also appeared as Eddie Haskell in reunion episodes of Leave it to Beaver.\n\nKen Osmond died in 2020 at the age of 76 from complications due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and peripheral artery disease.\n\nAnother great character from Leave it to Beaver was Clarence \u201cLumpy\u201d Rutherford played by actor Frank Bank. Lumpy was another one of Wally Cleaver\u2019s friends and was known to be the \u201cbully\u201d character.\n\nBut Frank Bank was known to be a gentle and kind person. He had bit roles in television shows and a couple of films before landing the role of Lumpy Rutherford in Leave it to Beaver. This became the role he was most known for and he didn\u2019t get many offers after the show ended.\n\nHe retired from acting and began his career as a bond broker in Los Angeles. Frank did make appearances in The New Leave it to Beaver and Leave it to Beaver reunions. He died of cancer at the age of 71 in 2013.\n\nLumpy Rutherford\u2019s father was Fred Rutherford, played by Richard Deacon. He was known for bit parts on shows such as The Dick Van Dyke Show and The Jack Benny Program. He also had small roles in films such as Lay That Rifle Down and Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\n\nFred Rutherford was Ward Cleaver\u2019s obnoxious coworker. His performance began the trope of the annoying coworker that became a staple of so many American sitcoms.\n\nFollowing Leave it to Beaver, Richard Deacon spent the rest of his career playing bit parts in feature films and popular TV shows. His film roles included work in Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s The Birds, as well as other popular films such as The Patsy, Dear Heart, Blackbeard\u2019s Ghost, and Bad Manners.\n\nHis TV appearances outside of Leave it to Beaver included roles in The Lucy and Desi Comedy Hour, Bonanza, Get Smart, and The Addams Family.\n\nHe passed away at the age of 63 from cardiovascular disease in Los Angeles.\n\nThe main cast of Leave it to Beaver had another actress who had a similar background to Hugh Beaumont. Madge Blake was also from Kansas and her father was a Methodist circuit rider who discouraged her from pursuing a career in acting.\n\nNevertheless, Madge Blake became known as one of the most prominent character actresses for American films and television shows.\n\nIn the 1950s, she had roles in shows such as City Detective, The Ray Milland Show, and It\u2019s a Great Life.\n\nShe also played the infamous gossip columnist Dora Bailey in the classic film Singin\u2019 In The Rain. She later had roles in The Real McCoys and The Jack Benny Program. Once she got the role as Margaret Mondello in Leave it to Beaver, she became a favorite to American audiences.\n\nMargaret was the mother to Larry Mondello \u2013 one of the Beaver\u2019s closest friends. She beautifully played the role of the always nervous mother dealing with a not-so-bright son! As with Richard Deacon\u2019s portrayal of Fred Rutherford, Madge Blake\u2019s character became an popular trope for future American sitcoms.\n\nIn addition to Leave it to Beaver, she had small parts in shows such as Batman and I Love Lucy. She died in 1969 from a heart attack in Pasadena, California.\n\nWe should look back at these great talents and appreciate their work in Leave it to Beaver and other television shows and films. One thing that they all have in common is that they worked tirelessly to bring their characters to life. Their dedication to their craft is what made Leave it to Beaver a great show and why we love it today.\n\nFrom the main cast, Tony Dow who played Wally and Jerry Mathers who played Beaver are still with us! Tony Dow never intended to be an actor. But after being spotted by a casting agent, he was asked to audition for Wally Cleaver.\n\nHe became known as the older brother we all wished we had. Ironically, during the show\u2019s initial run he never watched a single episode of the show. He recalls that the writers didn\u2019t want many of the child actors to watch the show \u2013 so that they didn\u2019t let the fame get to their heads!\n\nJerry Mathers will always be known as Theodore \u201cBeaver\u201d Cleaver who represented the All-American boy. His portrayal of the character was impeccable, and he\u2019ll always be loved for representing a character from a bygone era.\n\nHe was also a reluctant actor, yet he still managed to give one of the greatest performances in American sitcom history. And we\u2019re grateful to him for it\u2026\n\nAre you a fan of Leave It To Beaver? Do you think that many of the deceased cast members got their due?

In the process, it made unknown actors into stars, made known actors into superstars, and helped launch some of the most venerable entertainment careers of the 20th century. Whether we're talking about the launch of one of the greatest character comedians to ever appear on the big and small screens or the roots of one of America's most successful feature film directors, \"The Andy Griffith Show\" was the beginning of a lot of American entertainment greatness.

The show begins when Frank, a construction worker and single father of three, and Carol, a beautician and single mother of three, bump into each other on a trip and spontaneously decide to wed (not knowing that a couple of their kids had already met and dislike each other). The show focuses on the comedic daily drama of a blended family trying to make living together work in the 1990s.\n\nThe show has been compared to \"The Brady Bunch,\" although the series' star, Suzanne Somers, who played Carol, has said the main difference is that, unlike \"The Brady Bunch,\" \"Step by Step\" was \"sexy\" and more modern, as Somers told Yahoo!.\n\nThe show went on for seven seasons, and, with any show that aired 20+ years ago, we often find ourselves wondering \"what happened to that person?\" Luckily, we're here to tell you just what happened to the cast of \"Step by Step.\""}, {"url": "https://www.thelist.com/186509/whatever-happened-to-ren-from-even-stevens/", "page_content": "Whatever Happened To Ren From Even Stevens?\n\nThe Disney Channel series Even Stevens made up a lot of people's childhoods as they grew up alongside the spunky Louis Stevens, played by famous actor Shia LaBeouf, and the more serious Renee \"Ren\" Stevens, played by Christy Carlson Romano.

She has actually been a very busy woman. This is what has happened to the actress who played Ren in Even Stevens."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/art/history-of-the-motion-picture/The-threat-of-television", "page_content": "The threat of television\n\nThe film industry believed that the greatest threat to its continued success was posed by television, especially in light of the Paramount decrees. The studios seemed to be losing their control of the nation\u2019s theatres at the same time that exhibitors were losing their audiences to television. The studios therefore attempted to diminish television\u2019s appeal by exploiting the two obvious advantages that film enjoyed over the new medium\u2014the size of its images and, at a time when all television broadcasting was in black and white, the ability to produce photographic colour. (In the 1952\u201353 season, the ability to produce multiple-track stereophonic sound joined this list.) In the late 1940s, fewer than 12 percent of Hollywood features were produced in colour, primarily because of the expense of three-strip Technicolor filming. In 1950, however, a federal consent decree dissolved the Technicolor Corporation\u2019s de facto monopoly on the process, and Kodak simultaneously introduced a new multilayered film stock in which emulsions sensitive to the red, green, and blue parts of the spectrum were bonded together on a single roll. Patented as Eastmancolor, this \u201cintegral tri-pack\u201d process offered excellent colour resolution at a low cost because it could be used with conventional cameras. Its availability hastened the industry\u2019s conversion to full colour production. By 1954 more than 50 percent of American features were made in colour, and the figure reached 94 percent by 1970.\n\nThe aspect ratio (the ratio of width to height) of the projected motion-picture image had been standardized at 1.33 to 1 since 1932, but, as television eroded the film industry\u2019s domestic audience, the studios increased screen size as a way of attracting audiences back into theatres. For both optical and architectural reasons this change in size usually meant increased width, not increased height. Early experiments with multiple-camera wide-screen (Cinerama, 1952) and stereoscopic 3-D (Natural Vision, 1952) provoked audience interest, but it was an anamorphic process called CinemaScope that prompted the wide-screen revolution. Introduced by Twentieth Century\u2013Fox in the biblical epic The Robe (1953), CinemaScope used an anamorphic lens to squeeze a wide-angle image onto conventional 35-mm film stock and a similar lens to restore the image\u2019s original width in projection. CinemaScope\u2019s aspect ratio was 2.55 to 1, and the system had the great advantage of requiring no special cameras, film stock, or projectors. By the end of 1954, every Hollywood studio but Paramount had leased a version of the process from Fox (Paramount adopted a nonanamorphic process called VistaVision that exposed double-frame images by running film through special cameras and projectors horizontally rather than vertically), and many studios were experimenting with wide-gauge film systems (e.g., Todd-AO, 1955; Panavision-70, 1960) that required special equipment but eliminated the distortion inherent in the anamorphic process.\n\nLike the coming of sound, the conversion to wide-screen formats produced an initial regression as filmmakers learned how to compose and edit their images for the new elongated frame. Sound had promoted the rise of aurally intensive genres such as the musical and the gangster film, and the wide-screen format similarly created a bias in favour of visually spectacular subjects and epic scale. The emergence of the three- to four-hour wide-screen \u201cblockbuster\u201d in such films as War and Peace, Around the World in Eighty Days, and The Ten Commandments in 1956 coincided with the era\u2019s affinity for safe and sanitized material. Given the political paranoia of the times, few subjects could be treated seriously, and the studios concentrated on presenting traditional genre fare\u2014westerns, musicals, comedies, and blockbusters\u2014suitable for wide-screen treatment. Only a director like Hitchcock, whose style was oblique and imagist, could prosper in such a climate. He produced his greatest work during the period, much of it in VistaVision (Rear Window, 1954; The Man Who Knew Too Much, 1956; Vertigo, 1958; North by Northwest, 1959; Psycho, 1960; The Birds, 1963).\n\nIn spite of the major film companies\u2019 elaborate strategies of defense, they continued to decline throughout the 1950s and \u201960s. Because they could no longer dominate the exhibition sector, they faced serious competition for the first time from independent and foreign filmmakers. \u201cRunaway\u201d productions (films made away from the studios, frequently abroad, to take advantage of lower costs) became common, and the Production Code was dissolved as a series of federal court decisions between 1952 and 1958 extended First Amendment protection to motion pictures. As their incomes shrank, the major companies\u2019 vast studios and backlots became liabilities that ultimately crippled them. The minor companies, however, owned modest studio facilities and had lost nothing by the Paramount decrees because they controlled no theatres. They were thus able to prosper during this era, eventually becoming major companies themselves in the 1970s."}, {"url": "https://brightside.me/wonder-films/12-stars-from-the-90s-we-dont-see-that-often-anymore-812742/", "page_content": "Career transitions are a common part of life, and even famous actors are not immune to this. Many actors have shifted gears and pursued new passions. While some may have fallen off the radar for a while, they are still making their mark in new areas, or they\u2019ve simply taken on projects that are not as big and successful as the shows they were once popular on. Their career transitions serve as a reminder that it\u2019s never too late to pursue a new passion or embark on a new journey.\n\n1. Moises Arias\n\nMoises Arias may have risen to fame as the lovable Rico on Disney Channel\u2019s hit series, Hannah Montana, but he\u2019s come a long way since then. Since then, Arias has been busy pursuing a wide range of acting projects, including a recurring role as Matt in ABC\u2019s The Middle and a challenging turn as Bonzo Madrid in Ender\u2019s Game. Despite his busy schedule, Arias still finds time for his passion, photography. His website, 490tx, features a collection of his stunning work that showcases his skills behind the lens.\n\n2. Mara Wilson\n\nIn the 1990s, Mara Wilson was one of Hollywood\u2019s most recognizable child stars. With beloved roles in films like Matilda, Miracle on 34th Street, and Mrs. Doubtfire, Wilson captured hearts around the world. However, she stepped away from the spotlight at just 13 years old after reaching the peak of her success. As an adult, Wilson has returned to acting but has opted for less mainstream projects. Today, at 36 years old, she continues to captivate audiences with her talent and outspoken views on the entertainment industry\u2019s treatment of young performers.\n\n3. Edward Furlong\n\nEdward Furlong\u2019s Hollywood journey began with his iconic role as John Connor in the blockbuster hit, Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Since then, Furlong has had his ups and downs, but he\u2019s been steadily making a comeback in recent years. After his rehabilitation in 2013, Furlong has been landing consistent work, primarily in smaller projects, such as Renegades, a Star Trek fan film, The Reunion, and Awaken. However, he has not lost his passion for acting, and his dedication to his craft is evident in his recent projects. Currently, Furlong has 3 upcoming projects in production: Charlie\u2019s Horse, Karma, and The Endless Whispers. These films are highly anticipated by fans eager to see Furlong\u2019s return to the big screen.\n\n4. Jason Earles\n\nJason Earles is best known for his role as Jackson on the hit Disney Channel show, Hannah Montana. Despite his success on the show, Earles never expected it to become the massive hit it did when it first premiered in 2006. In fact, Earles initially had reservations about his character\u2019s portrayal in the pilot episode, feeling that the original concept was too childish. However, after some changes were made, Jackson became the character fans came to know and love. Over a decade later, Earles is returning to his Disney roots in the third season of High School Musical: The Series. This latest project is sure to be a hit with fans of the original High School Musical movies, and Earles is excited to be a part of it.\n\n5. Rick Moranis\n\nRick Moranis was once one of the most beloved comedians in Hollywood, but you may have noticed that he hasn\u2019t appeared on-screen in quite some time. In fact, his last live-action film role was in Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves in 1997. But Moranis, who is now 70 years old, had a good reason for stepping back from acting as he had to raise his kids alone. And, as he explained in a rare interview, he would need a compelling reason to return to the big screen. Despite his absence from the spotlight, Moranis has remained busy with other projects. He created the animated show, Bob & Doug, based on SCTV characters, and has continued to take on voice roles in films such as Brother Bear and Miss Spider\u2019s Sunny Patch Kids. He has also written for The New York Times.\n\n6. Billy Baldwin\n\nWilliam Baldwin rose to fame in the early 1990s thanks to his charming performances in hit movies like Sliver and Backdraft. However, his acting career had humble beginnings, starting out as a fashion model for Calvin Klein. Throughout the 1990s, Baldwin appeared in several successful movies, including Flatliners, Three of Hearts, and Sliver, in which he gave a particularly memorable performance. Despite his early success, Baldwin has continued to work on a variety of projects throughout his career, including roles in TV movies and voice work in video games. His work has earned him a loyal fan base, and his career continues to thrive.\n\n7. Madeline Zima\n\nMadeline Zima\u2019s acting career started at the early age of just 2 and a half years old after she was selected for a Downey commercial at an audition where she was the only baby who wasn\u2019t crying. Her big break came when she landed the significant role of Grace Sheffield in the TV show, The Nanny. Although she had other TV shows and movie projects going on simultaneously, she appeared in all 145 episodes of The Nanny. Madeline Zima continues to act in film and television and has been seen in recent television series, such as Perry Mason, NCIS: Hawaii, and Hacks. Her filmography includes movies like Bombshell, Bliss, and Insight.\n\n8. Danielle Fishel\n\nDanielle Fishel started acting professionally when she was just 10 years old, making numerous guest appearances on TV shows like Full House and Harry and the Hendersons. However, her breakthrough role came when she landed the part of Topanga Lawrence on ABC\u2019s popular series, Boy Meets World. After leaving the show, Fishel decided to pursue a higher education and graduated Summa Cum Laude with a degree in Psychology from California State University Fullerton. In 2014, she returned to the role of Topanga in the Disney Channel spin-off series, Girl Meets World, where she not only acted but also discovered her passion for directing. Currently, Fishel is focused on directing and has co-written several projects for children\u2019s entertainment. She is actively pitching these projects to various networks in the hope of bringing them to life.\n\n9. Jaleel White\n\nJaleel White is an American actor known for his role as Steve Urkel, the nerdy neighbor in the popular TV show, Family Matters. His famous catchphrase, \u201cDid I do that?\u201d became an iconic part of \u201990s pop culture. After the show ended in 1997, White continued his career by lending his voice to Sonic the Hedgehog in various animated series, including Sonic Underground. He also appeared in cameo roles in popular TV shows, such as Boston Legal, House, and Psych. In 2021, White joined season 14 of Dancing With the Stars and finished in 7th place. Recently, White appeared on the Netflix series, The Big Show Show, playing the recurring role of Terry in 2020.\n\n10. Corey Feldman\n\nCorey Feldman rose to fame in the 1980s as one of the most sought-after actors of the time, starring in cult classics, such as The Goonies, Gremlins, and Stand by Me. While he has continued to work in the entertainment industry, none of his later projects have reached the same level of success as his \u201980s movie hits. Recently, Feldman has been focusing on his music career, releasing his latest album, Love Returns, in 2021. He has also been doing voice work for animated TV shows and has acted in horror flicks, like 13 Fanboy and The Sunday Night Slaughter. In 2016, Feldman made headlines with his band, The Angels, after appearing on Today.\n\n11. Nicholas Brendon\n\nNicholas Brendon gained fame for his role as Xander Harris on the hit series, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and also for portraying Kevin Lynch in Criminal Minds. He later co-created the webcomic, Very Bad Koalas. In February 2021, Brendon revealed on Instagram that he was undergoing spinal surgery after a fall earlier in the month.
