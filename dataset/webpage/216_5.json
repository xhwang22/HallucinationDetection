Here's what we came up with (from 10 to 1):\n\n10. On June 25, 1998, Marcus Camby was traded by the Toronto Raptors to the Knicks for Sean Marks, Charles Oakley and cash. Camby served as Patrick Ewing's backup in his first season with the Knicks -- technically half a season because of the lockout -- and did a solid job, averaging 7.2 points, 5.5 rebounds and 1.6 blocks to help lead them to the 1999 Finals. Camby went on to become one of the league's best defensive big men with the Knicks, averaging 11.1 points, 10.0 rebounds and 2.0 blocks in the next three seasons.\n\n9. On Dec. 12, 1956, Willie Naulls was traded by the St. Louis Hawks to the Knicks for Slater Martin. Starting with his first full season with the Knicks in 1957-58, Naulls played in four straight All-Star Games. Naulls spent six seasons with the Knicks (when you add up two abbreviated seasons due to trades), averaging 19.3 points and 11.7 rebounds, and leading them to the 2009 Lost Eastern Division Semifinals.\n\n8. On Dec. 9, 1976, Bob McAdoo was traded by the Buffalo Braves with Tom McMillen to the Knicks for John Gianelli and cash. McAdoo only played two 1/3 seasons with the Knicks, but during that time he averaged 26.7 points and 12.0 rebounds, and led them to the 1978 Eastern Conference Semifinals.\n\n7. On Oct. 22, 1982, Bernard King was traded by the Golden State Warriors to the Knicks for Micheal Ray Richardson and a 1984 fifth-round draft pick (Scott McCollum). King may have averaged about the same amount of points as McAdoo (26.5 versus 26.7 in four seasons with the Knicks), but he led the team to two playoff appearances in 1983 and '84. As a member of the Knicks, King played in two All-Star Games (1984 and '85) and he led the league in scoring during the 1984-85 season at 32.9 points per game.\n\n6. On July 14, 1996, Larry Johnson was traded by the Charlotte Hornets to the Knicks for Brad Lohaus and Anthony Mason. Every season Johnson played with the Knicks, the team made the playoffs, including a 1999 Finals appearance. He spent five seasons with the Knicks, averaging 12.3 points and 5.5 rebounds.\n\n5. On Jan. 21, 1999, Latrell Sprewell was traded by the Golden State Warriors to the Knicks for Terry Cummings, Chris Mills and John Starks. Sprewell helped the Knicks reach the 1999 Finals in only his first season, and then the playoffs the following two years. He spent four 2/3 seasons with the Knicks, averaging 17.9 points and playing in the 2001 All-Star Game.\n\n4. On June 27, 1988, Charles Oakley was traded by the Chicago Bulls with a 1988 first-round draft pick (Rod Strickland) and a 1988 third-round draft pick (Phil Stinnie) to the Knicks for Bill Cartwright, a 1988 first-round draft pick (Will Perdue) and a 1988 third-round draft pick (Derrick Lewis). Oakley was the Knicks' glue guy for 10 seasons from 1988-89 to 1997-98 -- and every one included a playoff berth. He averaged a double-double (10.4 points and 10.0 rebounds) and made one All-Star appearance in 1994.\n\n3. On Oct. 14, 1965, Dick Barnett was traded by the Los Angeles Lakers to the Knicks for Bob Boozer. Except for his first season with the Knicks, Barnett led them to the playoffs for the rest of his eight-year tenure in New York, including two championships in 1970 and '73. He spent nine seasons with the Knicks, averaging 15.6 points and playing in the 1968 All-Star Game.\n\n2. On Dec. 19, 1968, Dave DeBusschere was traded by the Detroit Pistons to the Knicks for Walt Bellamy and Howard Komives. Every season DeBusschere played with the Knicks, the team made the playoffs, including two championships in 1970 and '73. He spent five 2/3 seasons with the Knicks, averaging 16 points and 10.7 rebounds, and playing in five straight All-Star Games from 1970 to '74.\n\n1. On Nov. 10, 1971, Earl Monroe was traded by the Baltimore Bullets to the Knicks for Mike Riordan, Dave Stallworth and cash. Monroe cemented his legacy as one of the greatest Knicks players by leading them to back-to-back Finals in 1972 and '73, including a championship in the second appearance. He spent nine seasons with the Knicks, averaging 16.2 points and playing in the 1975 and '77 All-Star Games.\n\nAgree? Disagree?

A true pioneer, Willie was the first African-American team captain in franchise history and currently 13th on the all-time Knicks scoring list. pic.twitter.com/hv6YsiQ4ER \u2014 NEW YORK KNICKS (@nyknicks) November 25, 2018\n\nHis Path To The Knicks\n\nNaulls was born in Dallas, Texas in 1934, but before long his family moved to San Pedro, California in order to seek a more diverse and welcoming community. He loved Major League Baseball as a child and in high school was originally on track to play baseball, but the 6\u20196\u201d, 225-pound athlete wound up turning to basketball and becoming an All-American at UCLA under legendary coach John Wooden.\n\nNaulls was a second round draft pick of the St. Louis Hawks in 1956, selected in a draft class that included Bill Russell, Elgin Baylor and Tommy Heinsohn. Naulls was not necessarily a fan of the team that took him, seeing as they were stationed in the still-segregated Southern U.S., according to an interview he gave to NBA.com in December 2015.\n\n\u201cMy parents took us out of the South to experience the freedom of competition and of choice of the integrating West Coast,\u201d Naulls said in the interview. \u201cTo go to St. Louis and its segregated hotels, restaurants, cabs, living districts and attitude was a cultural shock. As a 21-year-old man, I had rarely experienced that since I was eight years old.\u201d\n\nLucky for Naulls, his stay in St. Louis did not last long; on December 10th, 1956, only 19 games into his rookie season, Naulls was traded to the Knicks.\n\nNaulls\u2019 Career As A \u2018Bocker\n\nNaulls quickly carved out a significant role for himself with the Knicks, averaging 18.1 points and 11.8 rebounds in his first full season with the team and earning a spot on the Eastern Conference All-Star team. He was one of only three black players selected as All-Stars that season, the others being Russell and Maurice Stokes.\n\nDuring the roughly seven seasons he was with the Knicks, Naulls made four All-Star teams, and his overall Knicks stats stand at 19.3 points and 10.7 rebounds a game. He averaged more than 20 points a game three times for the Knicks, including during the 1961-62 season when he put up 25 points and 11.6 rebounds per contest.\n\nThe Knicks made the playoffs only once during Naulls\u2019 tenure, in 1959, when the team\u2019s 40-32 record was good for second place in the East. The Knicks lost in the division semifinals that year to the Syracuse Nationals, two games to none.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Naulls was named Knicks\u2019 captain, becoming the first African-American athlete to earn the title for any team in any of the major American sports.\n\nOn March 2, 1962, Naulls posted 31 points and 7 rebounds in a 169-147 loss to the Philadelphia Warriors. Naulls\u2019 strong showing represented the seventh straight game he had scored 30 or more points, setting a franchise record that wouldn\u2019t be broken for almost five decades (Amar\u2019e Stoudemire scored 30 or more in nine consecutive games in 2010). Naulls\u2019 record-setting night against the Warriors was overshadowed by Wilt Chamberlain, who scored 100 points and grabbed 25 boards.\n\nToday, Naulls sits at 13th on the Knicks all-time scoring list, one spot behind John Starks and just ahead of Gerald Wilkins. His 8,318 points as a Knick are more than than the likes of Bernard King, Latrell Sprewell and Stephon Marbury, among others big names. His 5,015 rebounds is good for 5th on the Knicks all-time rebounds list, behind only Patrick Ewing, Willis Reed, Charles Oakley and Harry Gallatin.\n\nHis Post-Knicks Career as a Champion\n\nIn December 1962, Naulls was traded to the San Francisco Warriors, and in September 1963 he was traded again, this time to a Boston Celtics team that was in the middle of an absolutely dominant stretch of basketball that included 11 championships between 1957 and 1969.\n\nNaulls notched three titles as a member of the Celtics, in 1964, 1965 and 1966. He retired from the NBA in 1966.\n\nIn 1964, Naulls was part of the NBA\u2019s first all-black starting lineup with the Celtics, in a game that was ironically played against his former team, the St. Louis Hawks\n\nFor his career, Naulls averaged 15.8 points and 9.1 rebounds a game. His career field goal percentage was 40.6 percent, and he shot free throws at a clip of 81.2 percent.\n\nLife After The NBA\n\nNaulls focused on business once his NBA career was over, and his original pursuits included owning an auto dealership in Los Angeles and investing in \u201centerprises that he felt could provide jobs in black communities,\u201d according to the New York Times.\n\nIn 1993, he formed Willie Naulls Ministries, a non-profit venture that aims to \u201cequip believers to testify the Truth of how to live victoriously in God\u2019s Kingdom here on earth by teaching Biblically based principles for personal growth of spirit, soul, and body,\u201d according to its website.\n\nNaulls is survived by his wife, two sons and two daughters, and six grandchildren, along with a legion of Knicks fans who appreciate his contributions to both the team and the world of sports at large.
