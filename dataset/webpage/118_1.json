{"Don R. Swanson is known for his work in information science, particularly in the areas of information retrieval, citation analysis, and bibliometrics.": [{"url": "https://news.uchicago.edu/story/don-r-swanson-information-science-pioneer-1924-2012", "page_content": "Don R. Swanson believed laboratories weren't the only source of new scientific discoveries. Swanson, a specialist in the relationship between natural and computer languages, thought electronic databases also held the key to medical knowledge.\n\nA trailblazing information scientist, Swanson died Nov. 18 at age 88.\n\nConcerned that excessive specialization could inhibit scientific creativity, Swanson pioneered the field of literature-based discovery, which uses existing research to create new knowledge. The three-term dean of the University\u2019s Graduate Library School and professor emeritus in the Humanities Division believed that unearthing unseen links between two distinct areas of study could yield new discoveries\u2014what he called \u201cundiscovered public knowledge.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, Swanson received the ASIST Award of Merit, the highest honor from the American Society for Information Science & Technology, for his work.\n\nArrowsmith: \u2018An intellectual adventure\u2019\n\nSwanson famously tested his theory of undiscovered public knowledge with a 1986 paper in which he made a provocative connection between dietary fish oil and Raynaud\u2019s disease, a circulatory disorder.\n\nIn a search of the Medline database, which houses millions of scientific journal abstracts, Swanson found a common thread in research on Raynaud's disease and dietary fish oil. His hunting turned up numerous articles that described high blood viscosity in patients with Raynaud\u2019s disease; in a separate search, he found a body of research that showed dietary fish oil could reduce blood viscosity.\n\nThe implication of bringing these two literatures together was powerful: could fish oil, Swanson wondered, be used to treat Raynaud\u2019s disease?\n\nA clinical trial three years later validated the use of fish oil for patients with Raynaud\u2019s disease. Swanson later hypothesized a connection between migraine headaches and magnesium deficiency that was also subsequently supported by clinical research.\n\nSpurred on by these findings, Swanson and Neil Smalheiser of the University of Illinois at Chicago developed Arrowsmith, a piece of software that assists investigators in identifying connections between two sets of Medline articles.\n\nArrowsmith (named after the 1925 Sinclair Lewis novel) was aimed at building a \u201csystematic, computational\u201d method to find possible links among articles, Smalheiser said. \u201cThe computer was not supposed to generate discoveries, but it was supposed to identify and put together these potential assertions.\u201d\n\nThe Arrowsmith model proved influential, and the approach Swanson and Smalheiser developed has been adapted to study the correlations of genes with diseases and find possible new uses for medications.\n\nDespite the impact of Swanson and Smalheiser's work on Arrowsmith, \u201cWe never saw it as anything other than an intellectual adventure,\u201d Smalheiser said.\n\n\u2018Experiments with information\u2019 not salamanders\n\n\u201cDon was doing science, without dissecting a salamander,\u201d said Mark Olsen, assistant director of the American and French Research on the Treasury of the French Language (ARTFL) project, a major digital humanities project that was influenced by Swanson\u2019s work. \u201cHe was doing experiments with information.\u201d\n\nSwanson began his career studying physics as an undergraduate at the California Institute of Technology. He received his MA in physics from Rice University in 1947 and his PhD, also in physics, from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1952.\n\nEven in their early days, computers were a source of fascination for Swanson. \u201cI think he was always dazzled by the idea of the computer,\u201d said his wife, Patricia Swanson.\n\nSwanson worked as a computer systems analyst at Hughes Research & Development and research scientist at Ramo-Wooldridge Corp. & TRW, Inc., before he joined the UChicago faculty in 1963 as dean of the Graduate Library School (which closed in 1990). Swanson's background as a physical scientist set him apart from the seven previous deans of the school, who represented a variety of other disciplines.\n\nAt the GLS, Swanson initially focused on computer-aided information retrieval, an entirely new area of study at the time.\n\n\u201cAt the time Don began working on it, people simply couldn\u2019t imagine that you could retrieve information with a computer,\u201d said his colleague Abe Bookstein, professor emeritus in the Humanities. \u201cIn a field that was very qualitative, Don was instrumental in introducing quantitative formal techniques.\u201d\n\nHe was also a rigorous and encouraging teacher, according to his former GLS student Charles Blair, who remembered Swanson for his \u201cvery clean, organized and methodical approach to his subject.\u201d\n\nSwanson happily lent his expertise to colleagues around the University. In the early days of the ARTFL project, Prof. Robert Morrissey came to Swanson for advice on how to handle organization of the massive new database. \u201cHe told me, \u2018What this project needs is a little sunshine and water,\u201d remembered Morrissey, the Benjamin Franklin Professor of French Literature and director of ARTFL. \u201cHe was very generous with his time.\u201d\n\nThat generosity was not unusual for Swanson, according to Smalheiser\u2014Swanson went \u201cout of his way to be nice and encouraging,\u201d Smalheiser said.\n\nSwanson\u2019s quiet manner belied a mischievous sense of humor that led him to write satiric articles, for example, \u201cNew Horizons in Psychoanalysis: Treatment of Necrosistic Personality Disorders,\u201d in Perspectives in Biology and Medicine (1986).\n\nNot only intellectually witty but also physically fit, Swanson was an avid runner who completed a half-marathon at the age of 80.\n\nBut his work was by far his greatest passion, according to Patricia Swanson. \u201cHe was always trying to do something better,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition to his wife, Swanson is survived by his son, Richard B. Swanson; and his daughter, Judith A. Swanson, PhD\u201987. Another son, Douglas A. Swanson, died in 2004.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations in Swanson\u2019s honor may be made to the University of Chicago Library, the Nature Conservancy or the Heritage Foundation."}, {"url": "https://blog.sciencenet.cn/blog-1557-8018.html", "page_content": "Abstract\n\nWith the rapid development of science and technology, specialties are split into subspecialties further and there are poor communications across specialties. Information developed in one area of research may be of value in another without anyone becoming aware of the fact, so there should be many implicit undiscovered connections of interest which can not be retrieved by conventional computer-aided literature search. Don R. Swanson, professor of information science at the University of Chicago, solved this problem.\n\nHe developed an information method called non-interactive literature-based discovery and designed Arrowsmith, which is an interactive software and search strategies. This paper introduces the background\n\n, concept and application of Swanson\u2019s information method in detail and the reviews of American information scientists on Swanson\u2019s\n\nmethod and explains the author\u2019s opinion. At last, the paper discusses the methodlogical enlightenment and significance of Swanson\u2019s achievements in information science. Swanson is opening up a new way of doing information science."}, {"url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/275537", "page_content": "Please download or close your previous search result export first before starting a new bulk export.\n\nPreview is not available.\n\nBy clicking download,will open to start the export process.

First, we analyze the authors\u2019 contributions to the body of LBD and provide performance statistics for the LBD production across countries and institutions. In the second part of this section, we delve into science mapping and try to understand the intellectual base of LBD research through the analysis of keywords and co-citation patterns.\n\nIn Fig. 3 we depict a four-phase flowchart based on the PRISMA recommendations (Liberati et al. 2009). Using the search strategy described previously in the Methods section, we first retrieve \\(n = 8895\\) bibliographic records. Next, we remove duplicate publications (\\(n = 3875\\)) after which \\(n = 5023\\) records remain. We manually screen the titles and abstracts and exclude \\(n = 4596\\) records that are not relevant to LBD. The second screening is performed on full-text publications; in this phase, we exclude additional 18 non-relevant publications. Finally, 409 publications remain for further analysis.\n\nRetrieved literature\n\nThe number of publications indexed by different bibliographic databases (e.g., WoS, Scopus, and PubMed) on the same research subject tends to differ. Therefore, to extract a more reliable and valid set of data, we use eight databases. We include publications published between 1986 and 2020 that represent the complete active period of publication in LBD. A search of the databases was performed on 1st April 2020. Consequently, publications that were indexed after this date might not have been captured in our study. The final set of bibliographic records covers a time period of 35 years (1986\u20132020) beginning with Swanson\u2019s first paper on the LBD (Swanson 1986a). The majority of the records are original articles (\\(n = 236\\)), followed by conference papers (\\(n = 127\\)), review papers (\\(n = 24\\)), book chapters (\\(n = 11\\)), and other material (\\(n = 11\\); i.e., book review, letters to the editor, and reports). All documents were published in \\(n = 224\\) different sources. As of April 1, 2020, the complete set of publications had been cited \\(n = 10{,}198\\) times.\n\nTable 1 Queries used and statistics of the document retrieval process Full size table\n\nPerformance bibliometric analysis\n\nPublication evolution over the years\n\nThe analysis of publication behavior over time might demonstrate the developmental trend from the macroscopic perspective. The maximum number of papers (\\(n = 34\\)) were published in 2012. It is noteworthy that the term \u201cLiterature Based Discovery\u201d was included in Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) vocabulary in 2013, indicating its high bibliographic importance. Figure 4 depicts the changing pattern of publications in our data set from 1986 until 2020. A reader can observe that the number of publications on LBD increased slowly from 1986 to mid-2000s, but since then it has been increasing significantly. This fact indicates that the field of LBD has acquired significant attention in the last decade\n\nThe 35 years\u2019 time span could be naturally clustered into three phases according to the published papers per year:\n\n1. Incubation phase (1986\u20132003). In this phase, the number of publications was small, and the growing trend was more or less low. In the mid-1980s Swanson (1986a) published the seminal paper on LBD. In this period, first simple experiments for automating LBD were performed (Gordon and Lindsay 1996; Lindsay and Gordon 1999) and the basic terminology was refined (Weeber et al. 2001). 2. Developing phase (2004\u20132008). In this phase the empirical evidence gradually increased, however, the number of publications per year, with the exception of the year 2005, was still less than 20. In this phase, the foundational aspects of automated LBD were solidified and prepared the basis for more advanced investigations in the future. Also, the first book dedicated solely to LBD was published (Bruza and Weeber 2008). 3. Mature phase (2009\u20132020). The number of papers published in this period is significantly higher in comparison to the previous two phases. Research has entered a peak period and even demonstrated a booming tendency. In this period researchers developed a plethora of new methods and techniques for LBD. Additionally, the first two extensive review papers were published (Sebastian et al. 2017a; Henry and McInnes 2017).\n\nFig. 4 A number of documents published annually in the LBD domain (1986\u20132020). Red dashed line represents cumulative frequency. (Color figure online) Full size image\n\nWe fit linear and exponential regression models to test whether the annual distribution of publications followed Price\u2019s law. Both models were statistically significant (\\(p < 0.05\\)). The linear model achieved a coefficient of determination of \\(R^2 = 0.61\\), while the exponential model fitted better with a coefficient of determination of \\(R^2 = 0.65\\). Therefore, we could conclude that the annual production of publications follows Price\u2019s law. The annual growth rate was 8.66%, where we omit the last year from the calculation.\n\nAuthors\n\nThe authors are the driving force in research. It is the task of every scientist to make a meaningful contribution to the body of knowledge and thus (co-)shape the development of the field in which (s)he works.\n\nOur analysis identifies 802 distinct authors. The majority of the authors write in collaboration with colleagues (\\(n = 766\\)). On average, we have detected 3.68 (\\(\\textit{SD} = 2.73\\)) authors per document and 1.90 (\\(\\textit{SD} = 2.57\\)) documents per author. The authors with the highest number of publications and citations have a tendency to be the scientists who drive the research field and have a casting vote for its development. The 10 most prolific authors are presented in Table 2. Rindflesch clearly holds the first position with 37 publications, although he is the first author in only one LBD paper. As stated above, Lotka\u2019s law states that a small portion of researchers is responsible for most of the publications, whereas the majority contribute a very small number of papers. The discrepancy between the observed values and the expected frequencies according to Lotka\u2019s law has been evaluated using the nonparametric Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov (KS) goodness-of-fit test. KS test reveals no statistically significant differences between the observed and the actual publication numbers (\\(D = 0.28\\), \\(p = 0.491\\)).\n\nTable 2 Top 10 authors based on the total number of publications Full size table\n\nHowever, in terms of citations, Smalheiser scores far more than the rest of the researchers. As expected, the most cited is his paper in which he and Swanson as the first author described the Arrowsmith system (Swanson and Smalheiser 1997). Smalheiser and Peterlin also have the most significant difference between h and \\(h_s\\) scores, meaning that they are also highly productive outside the LBD area. The majority of authors are from the United States (Rindflesch, Kostoff, Smalheiser, Swanson, and Cohen), four authors come from Slovenia (Hristovski, Cestnik, Peterlin, and Kastrin), and one from the Republic of Korea (Song). Kostoff prevails according to the authors\u2019 dominance factor (data not shown), which is a ratio indicating the proportion of multi-authored papers in which a person appears as the first author. He authored 12 publications in which he appears as a first author.\n\nThe production over time was most prominent for Swanson. As stated previously, he wrote his first paper in 1986 (Swanson 1986a) and the final one in 2011 (Swanson 2011). Smalheiser, the researcher with the second-longest career path, joined Swanson in 1994 (Smalheiser and Swanson 1994). Smalheiser published his last paper on LBD in 2017 when he gave his personal perspective on Swanson\u2019s contribution to science (Smalheiser 2017). In order to understand the temporal aspects of authors\u2019 publishing patterns, we also perform burst analysis on authors\u2019 career paths. A significant level of the burst is presented in five authors. As expected, the founding father of LBD had the longest burst; from 1986 until 2001. In this period Swanson published the majority of his papers. Rindflesch\u2019s burst is significantly shorter; it ran for six years (2011\u20132016). Other authors (i.e., Smalheiser, Kostoff, and Jha) have very short bursts that last for only between one and five years.\n\nLet us now consider co-authorship relations. The entire co-authorship network consists of 802 nodes and 5148 edges. Each node denotes an author and the edges among the authors represent academic partnership through the co-authorship on the publications. The average degree of the network was \\(c = 12.84\\) neighbors. The network exhibits a relatively short average path length (\\(l = 4.94\\) hops) and high clustering (\\(C = 0.72\\)). To draw the network, we filter out all nodes with degree \\(k_i < 2\\) neighbors. The reduced co-authorship network is presented in Fig. 5. The node size is proportional to the number of publications, and the edge width follows the strength of the collaboration. The colors of the nodes correspond to the different network communities as identified by the Louvain clustering algorithm (Blondel et al. 2008). The high clustering coefficient reflects the rich community structure of the network. The researchers inside the clusters establish strong partnerships with colleagues in the same research group and only weakly connect with other researchers. The biggest research community with robust collaboration among researchers include the highly productive research circuit of Rindflesch as the central author. The network exhibits low density (\\(\\rho = 0.02\\)), which together with high modularity (\\(Q = 0.91\\)) indicates that research groups are dispersed. The author with the highest betweenness centrality is Wang; however, the average betweenness centrality is very low as well (\\(B = 0.001\\)), meaning that most authors\u2019 influence is still at a low level. To sum up, the collaboration network exhibits many subnetworks, indicating that the LBD domain is composed of many small and medium-sized research groups with little communication among them.\n\nFig. 5 Co-authorship network of authors in the LBD domain. Nodes represent authors and the edges refer to the co-authorship relation. The size of the node is proportional to the number of author\u2019s publications. The width of the edge is proportional to the number of co-authorships. CiteSpace configuration: LRF = 3, LBY = 8, e = 2.0, Top N = 50, threshold = 2 Full size image\n\nCountries\n\nA total of 27 countries have contributed to the LBD literature, as depicted in the world map in Fig. 6. First, it is worth noting that LBD production is unevenly distributed across countries. The United States commits about half of the body of the literature to LBD research (\\(n = 167\\) or 49% of all the documents). This indicates that the US is leading in LBD research. Interestingly, Slovenia, a small country in the heart of Europe, is the second most productive country with 34 publications (10%). Surprisingly, India has no researcher who published about LBD as the first author. We also report the productivity score for each country using the simple formula (production number/population \\(\\times\\) 1,000,000). Slovenia has been found to be the most productive country (16.40) followed by the Netherlands (0.64) and the United States (0.51). Following the United Nations country classification schema (https://unstats.un.org), most countries are developed countries. Gross domestic product (GDP) measures goods and services produced in a country. We have found a moderate positive correlation between 2019 GDP values and number of publications of 27 countries (\\(r = 0.32\\), \\(p = 0.099\\)). However, the United States is top-ranked according to total citations (\\(n = 6267\\)), followed by Germany (\\(n = 714\\)), and the Netherlands (\\(n = 520\\)).\n\nFig. 6 World map of LBD research production from 1986 to 2020 Full size image\n\nThe production concerning temporal evolution across countries reveals the primacy of the United States. Researchers from the United States have been publishing regularly since 1986 and they have significantly intensified the research production since 2001. In the second place, we have identified the United Kingdom with the publication span 1989\u20132019. The early appearance of the United Kingdom on the LBD scene is due to two theoretical papers published at the end of the 1980s that discuss the creation of new knowledge by information retrieval (Davies 1989, 1990). However, the next paper originating from the UK was published only in 2006 (Song and Bruza 2006). We have detected no significant burst for countries.\n\nInstitutions\n\nNext, we consider the institution level. Institution-based analysis might help to discover research organizations that deserve the researcher\u2019s attention and provide a macro understanding of the spatial distribution of LBD efforts. Our analysis identifies 173 different organizations that contribute to the production of LBD publications. Please note that we only consider the affiliation of the first author in the analysis. The details for the top 10 institutions, ranked according to the number of publications, are summarised in Table 3. The University of Chicago stands out with the largest number of publications (\\(n = 17\\)), thanks to the work of Swanson, followed by the University of Illinois at Chicago (\\(n = 14\\)), and University of Ljubljana (\\(n = 14\\)). Actually, six of the top 10 institutions come from the United States and as many as three from Slovenia (University of Ljubljana, Jo\u017eef Stefan Institute, and University of Nova Gorica). Only the University of Chicago scores among the top 10 universities according to the Academic Ranking of World Universities in 2019.\n\nTable 3 Top 10 research institutions based on the total number of publications Full size table\n\nJournals\n\nWhen analyzing research productivity, it is essential to study the journals in which papers are published. LBD is a narrow and specific research field that has no specialized journal.Footnote 2 However, we must point out that Frontiers in Research Metrics and Analytics recently introduced a section on Text-mining and Literature-based Discovery which is the most noticeable development of LBD-specific publishing venues nowadays. Instead, the LBD research is published mainly in journals related to (biomedical) informatics and bioinformatics. Table 4 summarizes details about the top 10 journals. Interestingly, with respect to the number of publications, Lecture Notes in Computer Science has published 21 papers on LBD research, followed by the Journal of Biomedical Informatics with a similar number of papers. Bioinformatics, which has the highest impact factor in our list, has published only 7 papers on LBD. Out of 10 journals, six are published in the United States.\n\nTable 4 Top 10 journals based on the total number of publications Full size table\n\nTo study journal distribution and to identify \u201ccore\u201d journals, we have also employed Bradford\u2019s law of scattering (Bradford 1934). In Fig. 7 we have plotted the Bradford plot where the cumulative frequency of LBD literature has been plotted against the logarithm of the journal rank. The journals are grouped into three zones, comprising a similar number of publications. The core journals are those whose data points lie in Zone 1 (\\(n = 14\\)). The middle third (i.e., Zone 2) has 75 journals, and the last zone has 134 journals. The relationship of each zone (14:75:134) does not fit well into the expected Bradford\u2019s distribution (26:88:294) (\\(\\chi ^2(2) = 11.17\\), \\(p = 0.004\\)). Thus, we cannot confirm Bradford\u2019s assumption that a few core journals account for one-third of all papers published within the body of LBD literature. It is also important to note that the curve does not take a typical \u201cS\u201d shape and there is no \u201cgross drop\u201d at the end of the curve. In our case, the Bradford plot has taken more or less a linear shape after the initial rise.\n\nFig. 7 Bradford plot. According to Bradford law, the majority of literature is concentrated in a small number of journals. However, our results do not confirm Bradford distribution.

The first coherent book on LBD was published in 2008 by Springer and edited by Bruza and Weeber (2008). The book contains 11 chapters by prominent authors in the LBD field and offers the reader a comprehensive overview of LBD research.\n\nFigure 8 shows a dual-map overlay visualization of LBD publications at the journal level (Chen and Leydesdorff 2014). Each dot represents a journal and its color indicates a cluster membership. Clusters are labeled with the title terms of the corresponding journals. The left half of the map refers to citing journals (i.e., the citing journal is a journal in which a source article is published) and the right half of the map represents cited journals (i.e., the cited journal is the journal in which a reference is published). The spline curves connect citing journals on the left side with cited journals on the right side.\n\nThe majority of the citing articles in Fig. 8 are distributed among four major disciplines, namely mathematics, biology, medicine, and health. Furthermore, all cited papers are concentrated in molecular biology and genetics-related journals. This finding supports the observation that LBD has concentrated on the biomedical field.\n\nFig. 8 Dual-map overlay of journals in LBD research. The left half of the figure represents the citing map and the right half the cited map. The labels represent the disciplines covered by the journal. The lines represent the flow of knowledge in different scientific fields. The citation paths are bundled using the z-score function in CiteSpace Full size image\n\nPublications\n\nEmploying the processed bibliometric data, we can identify the most important hallmarks of LBD research. In total, we have extracted 13,026 references from 409 papers related to LBD research. The top 10 most cited papers are listed in Table 5, including their first author, year of publication, title, the total number of citations, and the number of citations per year. The data are ranked by the number of citations. Swanson is the author of four listed publications. First on the rank list is Swanson\u2019s seminal paper on fish oil and Raynaud\u2019s disease (Swanson 1986a), which has 409 citations and is cited about 12 times annually. This paper is categorically the first hallmark of LBD research. The second and the third rank are reserved for two review papers, written by Cohen (2005) and Jensen et al. (2006). Both articles are of interest to the broader domain of researchers because they provide an in-deep review of methods and techniques used in text mining and especially in biomedical informatics and bioinformatics. The most recent of highly cited papers is an interesting article published by Uzzi et al. (2013) in which authors discuss balancing conventional and atypical knowledge which may be critical to link innovativeness and scientific impact. However, it is important to note that Uzzi\u2019s paper has considerably more citations per year in comparison to other papers on the list. This is probably due to the high impact factor of the Science journal in which the paper was published. A paper written by Chen and Sharp (2004) is the first serious attempt of applying a complex network approach to LBD and is relatively highly cited among researchers who utilize network analysis for bioinformatics. These ten publications cover the theoretical research as well as practical applications of LBD. However, all these papers were published before 2013, yet important scientific achievements in LBD have also been published more recently. For example, one key achievement that we can identify and is not on the list is a novel LBD system called LION LBD which offers a broad range of metrics for evaluating the strength of entity associations, and allows fast real-time discovery of indirect associations among biomedical concepts (Pyysalo et al. 2019). This and other important publications are not among the current top 10 due to their relatively recent publication date.\n\nTable 5 Top 10 references based on the total number of citations Full size table\n\nTo gain a deeper understanding of the citation structure, we have also conducted a burst analysis. In total, 46 documents have citation bursts. Table 6 summarizes the top 10 papers with the strongest citation burst. The top paper with the strongest burst (11.39) is the paper written by Swanson and Smalheiser (1997) in which they describe the Arrowsmith discovery support system and evaluate various LBD search strategies. The paper\u2019s burst began in 1998 and ended in 2005. The second paper with the strongest citation burst (9.61) was written by Weeber et al. (2001). This paper is one of the methodological hallmarks in the pioneering era of LBD. First, it formally describes a two-step model of the discovery process in which research hypotheses are generated (i.e., open discovery mode) and subsequently tested (i.e., closed discovery mode). Second, for LBD analysis authors employ UMLS concepts and use semantics with these concepts to filter out unmeaningful information. Third on the list is the article by Lindsay and Gordon (1999) on lexical statistics, which initiated the era of statistically-based LBD applications (Sebastian et al. 2017a).\n\nTable 6 Top 10 references with the strongest citation bursts Full size table\n\nScience mapping\n\nScience mapping is the next logical step in our analysis. In this section we provide keywords analysis and DCA.\n\nKeyword analysis\n\nThe research topics studied in LBD research can be characterized by the keywords assigned to each bibliographic record. The keywords enable us to summarise, qualify, and explain the entire scientific document within the boundaries of a particular research domain. The keywords provide a plausible summarization of research hotspots, for example, burst keywords represent research frontiers and indicate possible emerging trends. The word cloud in Fig. 9 reflects the frequency distribution of keywords in the core set of 409 documents. The five most frequent keywords are knowledge discovery, information retrieval, data mining, natural language processing, and literature mining. It is important to note that we detect no significant burst among the keywords.\n\nFig. 9 Word cloud of keywords extracted from documents on LBD research. Please note that the term literature-based discovery is omitted Full size image\n\nThe timeline view of the keywords is presented in Fig. 10. The timeline starts with the year 1996 because keywords were rarely assigned to bibliographic records before this early period. The research until the year 2001 is topical and domain-specific; the timeline is loaded with keywords such as fish oil, information retrieval, raynaud, magnesium, and migraine. Entering the new millennium, the richness of keywords increases, and terms evolve rapidly. In the 2010s we can observe two main directions of research: one is interweaving of LBD ideas with genetics; the other concerns application of semantics in LBD. Prevailing keywords are text mining, knowledge discovery, data mining, disease, information, system, gene, and natural language processing. This indicates that LBD research in this decade was developing from baseline Swanson\u2019s approach and its replications [e.g., Gordon and Lindsay (1996)] towards systematic development of knowledge discovery methods and data mining tools for LBD. In terms of LBD reviews from this era we can observe a shift from statistical-based approaches (e.g., pure co-occurrence) to rule-based (e.g., association rules) and semantic approaches. For example, in 2005 Hristovski et al. (2005) introduced the BITOLA system, which utilizes association rule mining to reveal (gene-disease) relations between biomedical concepts by observing frequent patterns among data objects. Roughly at the same time, researchers introduced a semantic-based discovery pattern approach (Hristovski et al. 2006; Ahlers et al. 2007), which significantly increases the precision and enhances the interpretability of LBD systems. A plethora of other Web tools and services were also developed within this decade [e.g., DAD (Weeber et al. 2001), LitLinker (Pratt and Yetisgen-Yildiz 2003), Manjal (Srinivasan 2004), IRIDESCENT (Wren 2004), and RaJoLink (Petri\u010d et al. 2009)]. The fourth decade of LBD (i.e., 2011\u20132020) has been the decade of network science in the LBD community. Important keywords in this time period are network, link discovery, link prediction, network analysis, knowledge graph, drug discovery, and pharmacovigilance. According to Sebastian et al. (2017a) this decade coincides with the stage of emerging LBD approaches which could be characterized by two directions. First, traditional co-occurrence-based and knowledge-driven approaches culminate in solutions that integrate both. Second, LBD becomes more interdisciplinary, incorporating methods and tools from information sciences (Chen et al. 2009), scientometrics (Kostoff 2014), and machine learning (Sebastian et al. 2017b).\n\nFig. 10 A timeline view of keywords extracted from documents on LBD for the period 1986\u20132020. We have built a list of keywords from author keywords and keywords assigned by database curators. For the description of the clusters please see the text. Online version of the figure (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3884422) can be enlarged for further details Full size image\n\nDocument co-citation analysis\n\nDCA allows us to examine a network of co-cited references. The body of cited references provides the knowledge base of the selected documents. Figure 11 depicts the subset of the DCA network as pruned with the Pathfinder algorithm (Chen 2006). The network exhibits 399 nodes and 891 edges. Each node in the network refers to a document that is labeled with the first author name and the year of publication. Each edge represents a co-citation relation among the pair of documents. The size of the nodes is proportional to the co-citation frequency. The most highly cited documents were written by Srinivasan (2004) and Wren et al. (2004). As we have said previously in the Methods section, we have computed two types of node importance, namely betweenness centrality, and brokerage. The aforementioned Wren\u2019s paper is the document with the highest betweenness centrality (0.34), followed by Jensen et al. (2006) (0.27). Together with Frijters et al. (2010), both papers also exhibit the highest brokerage score. These references are not only important as hubs in the DCA network but also as bridging nodes among contextually different groups of nodes.\n\nFig. 11 Document co-citation network of the core dataset based on documents published between 1986 and 2020. Cluster labels in red text are taken from the titles of the cited documents using the log-likelihood ratio algorithm. Red nodes refer to documents with high citation burst. For the description of the clusters please see the text. CiteSpace configuration: LRF = 3, LBY = 8, e = 2.0, Top N = 50 Full size image\n\nUsing cluster analysis of the cited references we obtain a set of 44 co-citation clusters that may provide us the main research topics of the intellectual base. Figure 11 depicts the DCA network with the embedded clusters. In total we have identified 13 clusters that are worth further consideration. Table 7 summarizes the basic statistics for each cluster sorted by its size: ID number, size, silhouette width, mean year, and first cluster label as identified by the log-likelihood ratio extraction method. The silhouette width ranges from 0.72 to 0.99 indicating adequate consistency of derived clusters. The clusters could be summarized as follows.\n\n1. Cluster #0 (finding linkage) has the largest number of members. Cluster\u2019s mean age is 2003 and is relatively old. This cluster is to be interpreted as a general LBD cluster while it contains generic phrases such as life science, online tool, biomedical text mining, vector space model, and discovery approach. Representative references in this cluster are Lindsay and Gordon (1999), Weeber et al. (2003), and Hristovski et al. (2005) which also exhibit the highest citation burst. The paper written by Hristovski et al. demonstrated high SigmaFootnote 3 value, indicating a high degree of scientific novelty. Two typical citing papers are for example Cohen\u2019s (2005) review on text mining with a special section on LBD and Weeber et al.\u2019s (2005) paper, in which the authors review Web-based tools for LBD. 2. Cluster #1 (link prediction) is much younger; its mean age is 2011 and it assembles 42 references. The main theme of this cluster is on the prediction of future discoveries using link prediction methods. The cluster is loaded with terms reflecting its affinity to complex networks science (e.g., semantic medline network, mesh co-occurrence network, supervised link discovery). The three top-cited references are Cameron et al. (2015), Hristovski et al. (2013), and Wilkowski et al. (2011). Representative citing papers include seminal work by Katukuri et al. (2012) on supervised link discovery and Kastrin et al.\u2019s (2016) generalization of link prediction for LBD. 3. Cluster #2 (literature mining) contains 35 members and refers to gene prioritization and drug repurposing using LBD methods. It contains phrases such as high-throughput literature analysis, disease candidate gene, and gene prioritization. The three most representative references for this cluster are Wren et al. (2004), Frijters et al. (2010), and Jensen et al. (2006). The latter is a highly cited review paper on biomedical text mining and exhibits high Sigma value, reflecting its novelty in the field. Two typical citing articles are for instance Andronis\u2019s (2011) paper on literature mining for drug repositioning and Deftereos\u2019s (2011) review on adverse event prediction using literature analysis. 4. Cluster #3 (side-effect relationship) consists of 32 members. The representative phrases in this cluster are both technical (e.g., learning predictive models, literature-derived semantic predication) as well as applied (e.g., large clinical dataset, identifying plausible adverse drug reactions, adverse event prediction). Some representative cited references with the highest citation bursts are Cohen et al. (2012), Shang et al. (2014), and Cameron et al. (2013). The citing papers include for example Cohen\u2019s papers in which he discusses and elaborates the methodology of embedding of semantic predications (Widdows and Cohen 2015; Cohen and Widdows 2017). 5. Cluster #4 (emerging approaches) consists of 28 members. The average mean year of 2013 reflects its relative recentness. This cluster is mainly related to the description of novel and emerging approaches in LBD, which is reflected in phrases and terms such as new approach, heterogeneous bibliographic information network, or convolutional neural network method. The most cited reference with the highest citation burst is Smalheiser (2012). The citing articles include recent reviews by Sebastian et al. (2017a), Smalheiser (2017), and Thilakaratne et al. (2019b). 6. Cluster #5 (using arrowsmith) is the oldest extracted cluster (with a mean age of 1998). It reflects early pioneering days of LBD. Some representative phrases are for instance lexical statistics, human-computer collaboration, and medline record. In this cluster, the most representative cited references with the highest burst are Swanson and Smalheiser (1997), Weeber et al. (2001), and Gordon and Dumais (1998). The representative citing articles include Swanson and Smalheiser\u2019s (1999) paper on using Arrowsmith for biomedical relation discovery and Lindsay and Gordon\u2019s (1999) article in which they applied lexical statistics to extend and replicate original Swanson\u2019s discoveries. 7. Cluster #6 (artificial intelligence) contains 22 members and is represented with terms such as emerging in-silico scientist, bridging biology, and content-rich biological network. The most cited and highly burst references in this cluster are Jenssen et al. (2001), Stapley and Benoit (2000), and Hristovski et al. (2001). Citing papers include for instance Chen and Sharp\u2019s (2004) paper on building biological networks beyond pure co-occurrence approach. 8. Cluster #7 (literature-related discovery) may be referred to as Kostoff\u2019s cluster. Its mean year is 2006 and is loaded with terms like potential treatment or future research directions. This cluster contains mainly Kostoff\u2019s references that were part of the special issue of the journal Technological Forecasting and Social Change in 2008. 9. Cluster #8 (large-scale validation) is the youngest cluster in this list (mean year = 2014). It contains 20 members and is loaded with phrases such as hypothesis generation system, candidate ranking, and automated literature mining. One and only reference with a significant burst in this cluster is Kilicoglu et al.\u2019s (2012) paper on SemMedDB, a large scale repository of semantic predication extracted from MEDLINE. The citing papers reflect the recent work on large-scale LBD by Sybrandt et al. (2018a, b). 10. Clusters #9, #13, #16, and #17 are the smallest ones. Each of them consists of less than 20 members and are thus unstable to interpret.\n\nTable 7 Co-citation clusters of LBD research 1986\u20132020 Full size table\n\nCascading citation expansion\n\nAs described in the Methods section, the basic idea of the cascade citation expansion is to select a seed article and iteratively expand the initial set of references by adding new papers through citation links (Chen and Song 2019). We used Swanson\u2019s paper on fish oil and Raynaud\u2019s disease (Swanson 1986a) as a seed article, which is generally considered to be a pioneering and groundbreaking work in LBD (Chen and Song 2019; Gopalakrishnan et al. 2019; Henry and McInnes 2017; Sebastian et al. 2017a; Smalheiser 2012, 2017; Thilakaratne et al. 2019a, b). For testing purposes, we used 2- and 3-generation forward expansion. After manual inspection, we decided to present the results only for a 2-generation procedure, which optimally summarizes the tradeoff between the recall of relevant papers and their precision.\n\nThe 2-generation forward expansion procedure collects a total of 86,927 distinct references. After pruning with the Pathfinder algorithm, we obtain the merged network with 622 nodes and 1267 edges. The extracted network contains 478 nodes, which is 76% of the full network we have obtained using the expansion procedure. Figure 12 depicts the largest connected component of the co-citation network.\n\nFig. 12 Document co-citation network derived from a 2-generation forward citation expansion procedure from a seed article by Swanson procedure. Clusters are labeled in red text. Red nodes indicate documents with high citation bursts. For the description of the clusters please see the text. CiteSpace configuration: LRF = 3, LBY = 10, e = 2.0, Top N = 50 Full size image\n\nMost cited is the paper by Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones (2011) which introduced the miRBase, a primary Web repository for microRNA sequences and annotations. Our inspection reveals that RNA research and LBD are related through Smalheiser\u2019s clinical work. For a deeper understanding of this connection, we refer the reader to the paper by Chen and Song (2019), who deduce similar conclusions. A citation burst has been detected in 227 papers. Among the top 25 papers with the strongest citation burst we identify three of Swanson\u2019s works including his seminal paper on fish oil and Raynaud\u2019s disease (Swanson 1986a) and a subsequent paper on migraine and magnesium (Swanson 1988).\n\nThe modularity of the network is high (\\(Q = 0.91\\)). Clustering reveals 68 coherent groups of nodes, out of which 20 significant clusters are labeled in Fig. 12. All silhouette widths are in the range 0.87\u20130.99 indicating high homogeneity of clusters. The oldest cluster is #10 (natural language) with 1990 as a mean year of publication. Most interesting are the youngest clusters that might indicate the new trends and topics which are worth addressing in LBD research. The youngest (mean age = 2014) are clusters #14 (deep learning) and #15 (artificial intelligence). The former includes terms like convolutional neural network, reinforcement learning, and machine learning, while the latter contains keywords such as big data analytics, computational intelligence, and precision medicine.\n\nUntil recently, neural network models have been rarely used in LBD applications (Crichton et al. 2018; Sang et al. 2018; Crichton et al. 2020). Although they have great potential to achieve better prediction performance and more stable results than ABC-based methods, their output suffers from low explainability and interpretability, due to their black-box nature (Zitnik et al. 2019). But on the other hand, this is also a great opportunity for artificial intelligence. Developing prediction models with the ability to explain the statistical learning process is currently a hot topic trend under the umbrella of the so-called Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) (Barredo Arrieta et al. 2020). Thus, the combination of both deep learning models and XAI presents fundamentally new frontiers for LBD research."}, {"url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/introduction-to-information-science/future-of-information-science/200197FF15C8F0717256AD5356A1E23B", "page_content": "The future is always beginning now Mark Strand\n\nInformation is at the centre of our society. It is what we often talk about, it appears frequently in the media, it is often labelled as our most important asset. Even our time is, taking into account the importance of information, labelled the \u2018information age\u2019. We feel threatened by information overload, some may even suffer from information anxiety. On the other hand we cannot survive without it; we need information every moment of our lives.\n\nAnd yet information science, the science having information at its focus, is experiencing an identity crisis. This is not new. For more than half a century information scientists have had to explain, over and over again, what their discipline was, and repeat that they were neither computer scientists nor librarians, while closely cooperating with them \u2013 and others. Could the reason be the interdisciplinary nature of the field? So outsiders notice the methods and theories taken from psychology, sociology, statistics, philosophy, etc., and do not see the added value of information science, particularly the focus on the object of the research: information.\n\nOr is it because \u2018information\u2019 itself is so vaguely and variously defined? Or have information scientists never had good public relations skills, so that they could communicate the message and become more visible? Part of the problem, at least in some environments, may also be attributed to the often used phrase \u2018library and information science\u2019 (LIS). While possibly accepted by librarians, the phrase does not do justice to information scientists, limiting them to the context of libraries only.\n\nWhile all this may seem a less important issue \u2013 information science has, after all, survived and flourished \u2013 the lack of understanding of information science is the highest hurdle for the implementation of its research results in practice. As the result, we encounter websites which are completely unintuitive, information systems aimed at the general public for which one needs specific training (e.g. library catalogues), unattractive interfaces, confusing subject arrangements, and so on. Let us take library catalogues as an example."}, {"url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/introduction-to-information-science/478E65D6D2BA5D4A8250EEC54445D2E6", "page_content": "Crossref Citations\n\nThis Book has been cited by the following publications.

He was an integral part of the Department of English until his retirement in 1998. All who encountered him remembers him with great affection and respect. Dr. Henry Limouze, emeritus chair, writes, \u201cDon Swanson was a colleague, scholar, teacher, reader, and friend. We were lucky to have him, and he will be missed.\u201d\n\nHis wide-ranging knowledge of nineteenth and twentieth-century English and American literature made him a core part of the department\u2019s offerings, and he was instrumental in the department creating and developing its graduate program. During the 1990s, he served as graduate director. Dr. Henry Limouze notes, \u201cI will always be grateful for this. Those who were faculty during that decade may remember curricular reform, planning, mission statements, assessment, \u2018visioning,\u2019 and more planning. The English department could seem like a whirligig that spun crazily while we strove to absorb the latest in higher education, or fought battles to defend the humanities, or just tried to keep up with our own scholarship and grading. But Don was the \u2018still center\u2019 of our department. He had seen worse battles. Don had served in the Merchant Marine during World War II, when unarmed cargo ships were routinely sunk by U-Boats.\u201d\n\nHis calmness and good humor combined with his depth and breadth of knowledge to make him an engaging and versatile teacher and conversationalist. Dr. MaryBeth Pringle recalls that \u201cDon's head was always off somewhere among the stars of literature and history. There was often a surprising story to hear or fact to learn when you encountered him.\u201d From his graduate work at Rutgers, Don had tales to tell of meeting Dylan Thomas and befriending the poet John Malcom Brinnin. A visit to his office for graduate advising could include a from-memory recitation of Chaucer to demonstrate how the Prologue might have sounded, a tale from his days in the Merchant Marine that illuminated an aspect of Conrad\u2019s work, or a kindly reminder that he would provide refreshments for the evening graduate seminar.\n\nHis wide-ranging curiosity and dedication to knowledge was on display during a sabbatical during which he investigated the genre of crime fiction. Not content to simply read, he enrolled in the Dayton Police Academy\u2019s Neighborhood Assistance Officer training course, which included ride-along beat work. He followed this by then writing his own crime novel to see how the practice of crime writing could shed light on the genre.\n\nDon\u2019s devotion to his wife, Willa, was much admired and remarked upon, and he is remembered above all for his gentle spirit and kindness. A 1981 memo from Dr. MaryBeth Pringle speaks to his unassuming and generous nature. A disabled student needed to be hospitalized, and Don volunteered to tutor him in the hospital rather than have him be unable to complete the class. Dr. Pringle wrote: \u201cI\u2019ve known for years now that you\u2019re a special kind of teaching professional. This particular act of kindness doesn\u2019t surprise me, but I\u2019m moved by it all the same.\u201d\n\nThat best portion of a good man's life,\n\nHis little, nameless, unremembered acts\n\nOf kindness and of love.\n\nWilliam Wordsworth\n\nNo doubt there were many more of these acts in Donald Swanson\u2019s life, but the faculty, staff, and students of the Department of English were privileged to know of, and be the recipients of, many of them.\n\n"}]}
