Before becoming a coach, he also worked as a commentator. An absolute icon of the sport, he is considered by many Aussie Rules Football analysts as one of the greatest players of all time.

In 2004, Buckley was inducted into the Collingwood Hall of Fame. After the 2007 AFL season ended, Nathan Buckley announced his retirement from the sport and immediately took up a commentator\u2019s position for the Seven Network. Three years later, the Collingwood Football Club signed Buckley as an assistant coach for seasons 2010 and 2011 and as senior coach in 2012 until at least the end of the 2017 playing season. Nathan Buckley was extended for two more years in September 2017 and is currently with the team. Let\u2019s find out more about this legend\n\nNathan Buckley: All You Need to Know\n\nWhen was Nathan Buckley born?\n\nNathan Buckley was brought into the world in rural Adelaide, South Australia on 26 July 1972. His family went around Australia as often as possible, and by the age of 12, Buckley had been to all significant states on the Australian territory. He grew up supporting Melbourne Football Club. However, Buckley spent most of his formative football years (matured around 10\u201317) in the Northern Territory, and subsequently has sporadically been viewed as a Territorian. He likewise played cricket for the \u201cPINTS\u201d social club, close to Michael Tunn from Triple J. He likewise played at the Ainslie Football Club in the Canberra-based ACTAFL for a season. In State of Origin he was considered of North Territory beginning and was chosen for a joined Queensland/Northern Territory group and The Allies group, a combination of players from Northern Territory, Queensland, New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania.\n\nNathan Buckley: Playing Career\n\nPort Adelaide (SANFL)\n\nBuckley\u2019s footballing gifts were seen from the beginning. He joined South Australian National Football League (SANFL) club Port Adelaide where, in 1992, he won the Magarey Medal (the SANFL\u2019s group best and most attractive), and the Jack Oatey Medal (best on ground in the SANFL Grand Final).\n\nBrisbane Bears\n\nIn the 1991 AFL Draft, the middling Australian Football League (AFL) club Brisbane Bears drafted him through its Northern Territory state zone. Buckley tested the AFL draft framework and started the discussion by opposing a transition to Brisbane. His fantasies were to play in Melbourne because of its way of life in the game. He consequently felt the Bears were a bothersome vocation alternative. In any case, AFL draft rules kept him from playing with another AFL club and he thus stayed in the SANFL.\n\nBuckley endorsed with the Bears for the 1993 AFL season as a feature of an arrangement among Buckley and the Bears that permitted him to go to his preferred club the accompanying season. Brisbane trusted his time in Queensland would be long enough to adjust his perspective. Buckley promptly showed his insane skills, playing 20 games, kicking 21 goals and dazzling with his overall play. He was the debut victor of the Norwich Rising Star Award and finished runners-up in the Bears\u2019 best and fairest honor.\n\nCollingwood\n\nDuring his first season, Buckley\u2019s plan with the Bears became common information. Toward the finish of the contract, he pulled in solid interest from all Melbourne-based clubs, mainly Collingwood, Geelong and North Melbourne. Notwithstanding, it was Collingwood that effectively orchestrated an economic alliance worthy for all gatherings. Obscure to other AFL clubs and to the actual AFL, Collingwood and Brisbane had effectively consented to make the exchange happen. Collingwood chose ten players on its rundown who were \u201cunapproachable\u201d, and the Bears could take any two players outside this rundown, just as the Collingwood Magpies\u2019 first round draft pick, in return for Buckley. The move saw Buckley move to Collingwood in return for Craig Starcevich, Troy Lehmann and the Magpies\u2019 first-round draft pick.\n\nBuckley was unyielding that the move was the correct professional course, with the conviction he had more possibility of winning a title with Collingwood. Unexpectedly, Brisbane would proceed to win three premierships during Buckley\u2019s days to Collingwood\u2019s none, with Brisbane in any event, beating Collingwood in two successive AFL Grand Finals in 2002 and 2003. In his first season with Collingwood, the Magpies were disposed of by the West Coast Eagles by two in Perth.\n\nFrom here, Buckley would be a reliable on field performer for Collingwood. Just as winning a Brownlow Medal in 2003, he competed in the best three twice before the turn of the century. He was likewise named Collingwood\u2019s Best and Fairest multiple times in 10 years (counting one tied), as well as six successive years in the All-Australian Team from 1996 to 2002.\n\nIn 1999, Buckley endured a messed up jaw playing against Carlton in Round 2. He returned in Round 8 to help Collingwood to their first victory of the period and their first in quite a while. Collingwood completed the season in the last spot (only the second time in the club\u2019s history). Buckley additionally contended in his last game at Collingwood\u2019s long-lasting home ground Victoria Park against one of their arch rivals, the Brisbane Lions.\n\nAs Collingwood captain\n\nIn 1999, mentor Tony Shaw made Buckley the Collingwood skipper, supplanting the still-dynamic Gavin Brown who was to tutor Buckley in the job until retirement. All through the last part of the 1990s/mid 2000s Collingwood had a few significant changes in faculty. Eddie McGuire became the leader of the club in 1998 and Mick Malthouse was selected as a mentor in 2000. Collingwood ended up fifteenth in 2000 and ninth in 2001, with Buckley featuring in the two seasons. In Round 2, 2001, Buckley set a new record by accumulating 46 disposals, the highest since quarters were abbreviated to twenty minutes in 1994 AFL season, this stayed the record until Round 10, 2009, when Dane Swan smashed it with 48 disposals.\n\nIn 2002, Collingwood made the AFL Grand Final interestingly during Buckley\u2019s residency at the club. In one of the extraordinary individual fabulous last exhibitions, Buckley won the Norm Smith Medal for best on ground, the first run through since 1989 that a player from a losing side had won the honor. The way that Collingwood was so close in the end had to do with his predominance against the vaunted Brisbane midfield, including commander Michael Voss. In 2003, Buckley got his most noteworthy individual honor, the Brownlow Medal with individual South Australian-conceived players Mark Ricciuto (Adelaide) and Adam Goodes (Sydney). The next Saturday, Buckley played in his second losing Grand Final, with Collingwood losing to the Brisbane Lions. Buckley was his group\u2019s driving ball victor, with 24 disposals. After maybe the best period of his professional career in 2003, the Magpie captain persevered through 2004 and 2005. He began the season strong with strong performances in the initial three rounds, yet missed seven of the following eight matches with hamstring issues. At the point when he returned, he seemed to play under coercion, investing more energy across half-forward or half-back. Buckley was respected with life enrollment of the Collingwood Football Club in 2004.\n\nDuring the 2006 season, Buckley was granted AFL Life Membership subsequent to playing his 300th authority match since his presentation in 1992, comprising 267 premiership games, 24 preseason games, four state of origin games and four international rules games.\n\nNathan Buckley rested twice during the season, once for the match against West Coast at Subiaco in Round 7, and again in the Round 21 conflict against Carlton. Toward the finish of the 2006 season, Buckley showed the potential for success of him having down as captain of the club, saying that James Clement may be a probable decision for the position. Clement later said he didn\u2019t wish to become captain. Collingwood President Eddie McGuire made light of any gossipy tidbits about Buckley standing aside.\n\nFollowing genuine hamstring issues, Buckley played his first round of 2007 playing for the Williamstown Seagulls in the VFL on 18 August 2007. He was adjudged as the best on ground, gathering 29 possessions and kicking four goals.\n\nHe got back to the Collingwood side the next week and played in the club\u2019s two leftover home-and-away games and each of the three finals, including its 18-point semi-last win against West Coast in extra time, and its five-point misfortune against Geelong in the preliminary final where he was perched on the seat in dissatisfaction when the last alarm sounded. After three weeks, on 5 October 2007, Nathan Buckley announced his retirement from Australian Rules Football.\n\nNathan Buckley: Coaching Career\n\nFollowing quite a while of hypotheses, Buckley inked a 5-year contract with the Collingwood Football Club. He was the associate mentor for the 2010 and 2011 seasons. Nathan Buckley was signed as the head coach in 2012, having taken over from Mick Malthouse, and signed a three year contract.\n\nCollingwood started the 2012 season shakily, losing to Hawthorn in round 1 and being whipped via Carlton in Round 3. Notwithstanding, they recuperated to win their next ten matches and finish the home-and-away season in fourth spot with a record of 16\u20136. They were crushed by Hawthorn in the Qualifying Final prior to bobbing back to overcome West Coast in the semi final. However, the team went on to lose to Sydney in the Preliminary Final at ANZ Stadium to end the 2012 season.\n\n2013 began lukewarm for the Magpies, drooping to a 5\u20134 record after 9 games. They couldn\u2019t exactly discover the consistency of past seasons and completed the year in the 6th spot with a 14\u20138 record. They played Port Adelaide in their Elimination Final at the MCG and drooped to an embarrassing 24-point defeat, which made Buckley raise doubt about the club\u2019s culture.\n\nBuckley\u2019s contract was stretched out until the finish of 2016 by Collingwood toward the beginning of March 2014; nonetheless, Collingwood created a terrible showing in round 1 and lost to 2013 finalists Fremantle by 70. They wound up missing the finals to finish twelfth mostly because of a physical issue emergency. Collingwood began the 2015 season at 3\u20131 as of Round 4 and a gutsy win against Essendon on Anzac Day in the 100th centennial celebrations of the Gallipoli landing.\n\nTowards the finish of Collingwood\u2019s 2017 season on August 28th 2017, Buckley was handed a two-year contract extension by the club after it embraced an audit of the whole football club. In the 2018 season, notwithstanding another injury emergency, Buckley actually figured out how to mentor Collingwood to their first Grand Final since 2011. Collingwood lost that Grand Final against the West Coast Eagles by 5. After a helpless beginning to the 2021 AFL season, calls started to ascend for Buckley to be sacked. The renunciation of McGuire from his situation as club president the earlier year was seen as conceivably putting Buckley\u2019s situation in harm\u2019s way, since he had been one of Buckley\u2019s staunchest supporters.\n\nNathan Buckley: Personal Life\n\nBuckley was a part of the AFL \u201cLaws of the Game\u201d or Rules Committee until he walked out of the organisation somewhat surprisingly.\n\nWho is Nathan Buckley married to?\n\nOn 31 December 2002, Buckley wedded Tania Minnici.

It was sufficient to ensure he was given a regular place in the attack even when Coventry returned and he booted 62 goals as a half-forward in 1937.\n\nWith Coventry\u2019s retirement Todd assumed the mantle of chief goalkicker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRon Todd flies high against Carlton.\n\n\n\nKnown for his great leap, Todd was also blessed with tremendous pace and as a professional runner had many successes at country meetings.\n\nHe was unstoppable in 1938 and booted 120 goals to head the goalkicking list. That tally included a stunning 11 goals against Geelong in the Preliminary Final to equal Carlton\u2019s Harry Vallence\u2019s record.\n\nThe goal avalanche continued unabated in 1939 with another 11 goal Preliminary Final performance and a total of 121 for the year.\n\nHis finals tally of 23 stood as a record until broken by Gary Ablett Senior 50 years later.\n\nBy the end of 1939 Todd was on top of the world.

In An Essay on Metaphysics (1940) he attacked the neo-empiricist assumptions prevalent in early analytic philosophy and advocated a logical transformation of metaphysics from a study of being or ontology to a study of the absolute presuppositions or heuristic principles which govern different forms of enquiry. Collingwood thus occupies a distinctive position in the history of British philosophy in the first half of the twentieth century. He rejects equally the neo-empiricist assumptions that prevailed in early analytic philosophy and the kind of metaphysics that the analytical school sought to overthrow. His logical reform of metaphysics also ensures a distinctive role and subject matter for philosophical enquiry and is thus far from advocating a merely therapeutic conception of philosophy or the dissolution of philosophical into linguistic analysis in the manner of ordinary language philosophy.\n\nHe is often described as one of the British Idealists, although the label fails to capture his distinctive kind of idealism, which is conceptual rather than metaphysical. In his correspondence with Gilbert Ryle, Collingwood himself explicitly rejected the label \u201cidealist\u201d because he did not endorse the arch-rationalist assumptions that shaped much British idealism at the end of the nineteenth and the early part of the twentieth century and consequently did not wish to be identified with it.\n\nCollingwood is the author of two of the most important treatises in meta-philosophy written in the first half of the twentieth century, An Essay on Philosophical Method (1933), and An Essay on Metaphysics (1940). They both contain a sustained discussion of the role and character of philosophical analysis and why the method of philosophy is distinct from and irreducible to the methods of the natural and the exact sciences.\n\nR. G. Collingwood (1889\u20131943) was a British philosopher and practising archaeologist best known for his work in aesthetics and the philosophy of history. During the 1950s and 1960s his philosophy of history, in particular, occupied centre stage in the debate concerning the nature of explanation in the social sciences and whether or not they are ultimately reducible to explanations in the natural sciences. Primarily through the interpretative efforts of W. H. Dray, Collingwood\u2019s work in the philosophy of history came to be seen as providing a powerful antidote against Carl Hempel\u2019s claim for methodological unity.\n\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nR.G. Collingwood was born in 1889 at Cartmel Fell, Lancashire, at the southern tip of Windermere. His father, W.G. Collingwood, was an archaeologist, artist, and acted as John Ruskin\u2019s private secretary in the final years of Ruskin\u2019s life; his mother was also an artist and a talented pianist. When he was two years old the family moved to Lanehead, on the shore of Coniston Water, close to Ruskin\u2019s house at Brantwood.\n\nCollingwood was taught at home until the age of thirteen when he went to preparatory school and the following year to Rugby School. In 1908 he went up to University College, Oxford, to read Literae Humaniores. He was elected as a Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford, while still taking his final examinations.\n\nOn beginning his philosophical studies in 1910 he came under the influence of the Oxford realists, especially E.F. Carritt and John Cook Wilson. Until around 1916 he was a professed realist; however, his realism was progressively undermined by his close engagement with continental philosophy, especially the work of Benedetto Croce and Giovanni Gentile. This was partly the result of his friendship with J.A. Smith, Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy from 1910 to 1935. In 1913 he published an English translation of Croce\u2019s The Philosophy of Giambattista Vico; he was later to translate many other works by both Croce and Guido de Ruggiero. Both Croce and de Ruggiero were personal as well as philosophical friends, although his relationship with de Ruggiero was closer.\n\nMuch of Collingwood\u2019s early work was in theology and the philosophy of religion, under the influence of \u201cThe Group\u201d or \u201cCumnor Circle\u201d, a gathering of Church of England modernists. In 1916 he published an essay on \u201cThe Devil\u201d in a collection produced by this group, and also his first book Religion and Philosophy.\n\nAt the same time Collingwood was engaged in practical archaeological work, spending his summers from 1912 onwards directing excavations of Roman sites in the north of England. Although he sometimes described his archaeology as a hobby, he nonetheless became an authority on the history and archaeology of Roman Britain, conducting many excavations, writing hundreds of papers, and systematically working his way around the country recording and transcribing Roman inscriptions.\n\nDuring the First World War Collingwood applied for a commission in the army but was rejected because of his poor eyesight. Having been a keen cadet at Rugby School and an enthusiast for the National Service League, this came as a blow. From January 1916 onwards Collingwood spent most of his time living and working in London in the Intelligence Section of the Admiralty; although he continued to see pupils in Oxford weekly, he gave no lectures between 1916 and 1919. He left the Admiralty in June 1919 and resumed lecturing in January 1920. During his time at the Admiralty he was the main author of two book length reports: A Manual of Belgium and the Adjoining Territories (1918); and A Manual of Alsace-Lorraine (1919). A spin off from this work was his entry on Luxemburg in the Encyclopaedia Britannica (12th ed., 1921).\n\nIn late 1919 Collingwood wrote an extensive survey of the history of the ontological proof, together with an analysis of the argument. This survey was given as a series of lectures in the early 1920s. He drew on this material in some of his later work, especially in Faith and Reason (1928), An Essay on Philosophical Method (1933) and An Essay on Metaphysics (1940). In 1924 Collingwood wrote Speculum Mentis. This was a dialectic of what he termed \u201cforms of experience\u201d: art, religion, science, history, and philosophy. During this period he was also lecturing on ethics, Roman history, the philosophy of history, and aesthetics: his Outlines of a Philosophy of Art (based on his lectures) was published in 1925.\n\nThroughout the 1920s and early 1930s Collingwood was also heavily engaged in historical and archaeological work, publishing The Archaeology of Roman Britain in 1930 and several editions of Roman Britain. The culmination of this work was his survey of Roman Britain in Roman Britain and the English Settlements (1936) and his contribution to Tenney Frank\u2019s Economic Survey of Ancient Rome (1937). To add to his self-imposed burden of overwork, his abilities as a linguistically versatile polymath (he was able to read scholarly work in English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Dutch, Latin, and Greek) were in great demand from 1928 onwards in his capacity as a Delegate to the Clarendon Press.\n\nPartly as a result of serious overwork coupled with insomnia, Collingwood\u2019s health went into decline from the early 1930s. In April 1931 he suffered complications arising from chicken pox and began to suffer from high blood pressure. He was granted leave of absence by the university; following his return, in the autumn of 1932, he began writing an important new book, regarded by many as the pinnacle of his philosophical achievement\u2014An Essay on Philosophical Method (1933). This had its origins in the methodological introduction to the lectures on moral philosophy he had delivered annually throughout the preceding decade. The Essay was a sustained investigation of the nature of philosophical reasoning through an examination of the distinctive character of philosophical concepts. Following publication of the Essay, Collingwood focused his philosophical energies on the philosophy of history and the philosophy of nature. The lectures he delivered at this time later formed the basis of the posthumously published The Idea of History (1946) and The Idea of Nature (1945).\n\nIn 1935 Collingwood succeeded J.A. Smith as Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy and moved from Pembroke to Magdalen College. He delivered his inaugural lecture on The Historical Imagination in October of that year. He had been elected as a Fellow of the British Academy in 1934 and delivered a lecture on Human Nature and Human History to the Academy in May 1936. These two lectures were later incorporated into The Idea of History.\n\nIn 1937 Collingwood wrote The Principles of Art (1938); whilst correcting the proofs he suffered a stroke, the first of many to come. From this time onwards he was conscious that he was writing on borrowed time. His An Autobiography (1939) records his determination to put on record an account of the work he hoped to do but might not live to complete. During a recuperative voyage to the Dutch East Indies in 1938\u20139 he wrote An Essay on Metaphysics (1940) and began work on what he regarded as his magnum opus, The Principles of History (not published until 1995). In 1939 he sailed around the Greek islands with a group of Rhodes scholars studying at Oxford\u2014a journey memorably recollected and evoked in The First Mate\u2019s Log (1940). On his return to Oxford Collingwood lectured on moral and political philosophy and worked at The New Leviathan (1942) which he saw as his contribution to the war effort. He wrote the book against a background of increasingly debilitating strokes.\n\nR.G. Collingwood died in Coniston on 9 January 1943; he was nearly 54. He is buried in Coniston churchyard in an unassuming grave between his parents and John Ruskin. He was succeeded in the Waynflete Chair by Gilbert Ryle.\n\n2.1 Philosophical distinctions and the overlap of classes\n\nCollingwood\u2019s first mature work, An Essay on Philosophical Method (1933), is a substantial treatise in metaphilosophy which seeks to delineate the subject matter and method of philosophical analysis. Here Collingwood says that the true work of philosophy is \u201cthe distinguishing of concepts \u2026coexisting in their instances\u201d (EPM 2005: 51). The moral philosopher, for example, distinguishes between different kinds of good: the pleasant, the expedient, and the right (EPM 2005: 41). When philosophers distinguish between the pleasant, the expedient, and the right as species of the good they are not sorting things into mutually exclusive classes. If this were their goal then the philosophical distinction between the pleasant, the expedient, and the right would imply that\n\nwhatever is pleasant must therefore be both inexpedient and wrong; that whatever is expedient must be both wrong and unpleasant, and that whatever is right must be both unpleasant and inexpedient. (EPM 2005: 41)\n\nBut this is clearly not the case because philosophers allow that one and the same action may be brought under different descriptions depending on whether it is motivated by desire (the pursuit of pleasure), by self-interest (expediency) or by duty (the right). Because philosophical distinctions bring objects under different descriptions rather than sorting them into classes, they defy the rules which apply to the relation between genera and species in the traditional theory of classification (EPM: 31). In the traditional theory of classification, the adjacent species of a genus tend to be mutually exclusive. Natural history, for example, classifies organisms into animals and vegetables, animals into vertebrates and invertebrates, vertebrates into mammals, birds, reptiles, and so on. These adjacent species tend to capture mutually exclusive classes (the class of vertebrates is different from the class of invertebrates; the class of animals is different from the class of vegetables). While there may be some overlap between adjacent species in this type of classification (the platypus is an animal that suckles its young like a mammal and lies eggs like a bird) these cases are \u201cexceptional and limited\u201d (EPM: 30). Overlap of classes, on the other hand, is a \u201cregular\u201d feature of philosophical distinctions. (EPM: 36). Philosophical distinctions allow for complete not merely partial overlap. It is not merely the case, for example, that some actions may exemplify both the concept of expediency and that of the right (in the way in which the platypus is both a mammal and a bird or amphibians are both aquatic and terrestrial animals), but that in principle any action which falls under one species of a philosophical genus could also fall under its adjacent concept: the class of actions which instantiate the principle of expediency could therefore in principle be the very same as the class of actions which instantiate the principle of duty. Collingwood\u2019s point when claiming that the concepts of expediency and duty overlap goes beyond the epistemic consideration that it is difficult to know a person\u2019s motive in acting, whether they were motivated by duty or by expediency; his point is rather that a philosophical distinction is \u201ca distinction without a difference, that is, a distinction in the concepts without a difference in the instances\u201d (EPM: 50). To say that philosophical distinctions are \u201cdistinctions without a difference\u201d is not derogatively to dismiss them as insignificant pedantic distinctions, but to point out that philosophically to disambiguate concepts is not the same activity as sorting things into classes. To disambiguate the concept of love from that of jealousy, (not Collingwood\u2019s example) is not the same as sorting partners into the separate classes of loving and jealous ones. By the same token to disambiguate the conception of the good into the pleasant, the expedient, and the right is not the same as sorting actions into those performed in the pursuit of pleasure, self-interest, or duty. The distinction between the pleasant, the expedient, and the right, (as with the distinction between love and jealousy) is a distinction that philosophers would want to make even if the world were such that actions motivated by duty necessarily benefitted the agent so that the class of actions motivated by self-interest or by duty would contain the very same members. Philosophical distinctions are purely intensional distinctions to which there may correspond no difference in the class of objects falling under the concepts that philosophical analysis disambiguates.\n\nConcepts, Collingwood says, may be viewed from two perspectives, their extension and their intension. From the point of view of their extension a concept is \u201cgeneral\u201d in so far as it gathers under itself \u201cthe plurality of its individual instances\u201d. From the point of view of their intension a concept is generic in so far as it gathers \u201cthe plurality of its specific differentiations\u201d:\n\nThus the concept of colour unites all the individual colours of all individual coloured things into a class of which they are members; but it also unites the specific colours red, orange, yellow, green, and so forth into a genus of which they are the species. It may be convenient to refer to the former unification by saying that the concept is general, to the latter by saying that it is generic. (EPM 2005: 28\u201329)\n\nIn the traditional doctrine of classification intensional distinctions piggyback on extensional ones:\n\nThe logical doctrine of classification, as it stands in the ordinary text-books, implies a certain definite connexion between these two characteristics of the concept: namely that if a genus is distinguished into a certain number of species, the class of its instances can be correspondingly divided into an equal number of sub-classes. Each sub-class will comprise the instances of one specific concept; the totality of the sub-classes will comprise that of the generic concept\u2026 (EPM 2005: 29)\n\nPhilosophical distinctions do not follow this logic because they do not presuppose that the concepts the philosopher disambiguates capture a specific set or class. The task of philosophical analysis precisely is to distinguish concepts which coincide in their instances. When two philosophical concepts coincide in their instances the thing which exemplifies them is not a hybrid, as amphibians or the platypus are. It is one thing seen from different perspective or brought under different descriptions. So, for example, a song exemplifies the concepts of music and poetry, but to say this is not the same as saying that it is part music and part poetry in the way in which a centaur is part man and part horse or the platypus is part mammal and part oviparous. Aesthetic distinctions between poetry and music, like moral ones, are distinctions which bring the whole of the object, not a part of it, under a different description. Philosophical distinctions are purely intensional distinctions between distinct concepts or genera. But they are not for this reason inconsequential. Just as those who fail to disambiguate the concept of love from that of jealousy will be not be able to comprehend how a loving partner need not be jealous so those who fail to disambiguate the concept of the good will not be able to comprehend how the pursuit of what is morally right may not be in one\u2019s self-interest.\n\nCollingwood\u2019s account of the nature of overlap of classes in philosophical distinctions informs his philosophy of mind and his approach to the question concerning the nature of the relation holding between the mind and the body. The distinction between the concept of mind and the concept of body (or matter) is a philosophical distinction. The task of the philosopher of mind is to distinguish between concepts which coincide in their instances and to disambiguate what one means, for example, when speaking about the human being qua biological being and qua person. When philosophers so distinguish between mind and body, they do not do this in the manner of natural scientists who sort animals into the classes of mammals and oviparous. Minded beings are not hybrids who are part mind and part body in the way in which the minotaur is part man and part horse:\n\nMan\u2019s body and man\u2019s mind are not two different things, but the same thing\u2026 as known in two different ways. Not a part of man, but the whole of man is body in so far as he approaches the problem of self-knowledge by the methods of natural science. Not a part of man, but the whole of man is mind, in so far as he approaches the problem of self-knowledge by expanding and clarifying the data of reflection. (NL 1992: 11)\n\nThe philosophical distinction between the concepts of mind and body is not to be confused with a real or metaphysical distinction as argued by Descartes. The claim that mind is a sui generis concept or category that is distinct from that of the body does not entail that it could exist apart from the body. Philosophical distinctions are intensional distinctions with no deep ontological implications. But the fact that they are not meant to cut reality at the joints does not mean that they do not carry any weight: those who fail to make the distinction between the concepts of mind and body are bound to fail to see a distinction between the normative/rationalizing explanations of actions and the descriptive/nomological explanation of events and espouse the view that the mind can be studied and understood in the same way as matter, by invoking causal laws. It is no surprise, therefore, that much of Collingwood\u2019s later philosophy, his philosophy of history in particular, is devoted to defending the autonomy of the explanatory practices of history (which he took to be the science of mind) from those of natural science. Distinguishing the explanandum of history, i.e., (mind), from that of science (matter/nature) is the true task of philosophy, a task that, for Collingwood, has to be distinguished from what he takes to be the pseudo problem of an enquiry into the causal relation holding between the mind and the body. The true question concerning the relation between the mind and the body\n\n\u2026 is the relation between the sciences of the body, or natural sciences, and the sciences of the mind; that is the relation enquiry into which ought to be substituted for the make-believe inquiry into the make-believe problem of \u201cthe relation between body and mind\u201d. (NL 1992: 2.49/11)\n\nAn implication of the ubiquitous nature of the overlap of classes is that the justification for the employment of philosophical concepts cannot be based on empirical observation because philosophical distinctions cannot be empirically verified. A geologist\u2019s classification of rocks into sedimentary and crystalline, for example, is based on the observable features of the two types of rocks and is empirically verifiable; by contrast philosophical distinctions such as those between the expedient and the right, mind and body, cannot be similarly justified precisely because they are distinctions in the concepts without differentiation in the instances. The justification for the deployment of philosophical concepts and distinctions lies in the fact that they enable us to bring reality under different descriptions and view it from different angles, that they enable one, for example, to judge a work of art to be aesthetically beautiful and yet morally reprehensible.\n\nIn his later philosophy Collingwood will abandon the terminology of the overlap of classes, but the commitment to the view that philosophical distinctions are \u201cdistinctions without a difference\u201d, and that the task of philosophical analysis is to distinguish between concepts which coincide in their instances remains even after this terminology is left behind. In his second metaphilosophical treatise An Essay on Metaphysics (1940) he sets out to disambiguate the different senses of the term \u201ccause\u201d. The term cause can be used, in what he refers to as sense I to mean \u201creason\u201d or \u201cmotive\u201d. In sense I\n\nthat which is caused is the free and deliberate act of a conscious and responsible agent, and causing him to do it means affording him a motive for so doing. (EM 1998: 285)\n\nThis is the way in which the term is used in the historical sciences or sciences of the mind. The term \u201ccause\u201d is also used in what he refers to as sense II to denote an antecedent condition that agents have the power to produce or prevent. In this sense a cause is\n\nan event or state of things by producing or preventing which we can produce or prevent that whose cause it is said to be. (EM 1998: 296\u20137)\n\nThe term cause is used in sense II in the practical sciences of nature, sciences such as medicine and engineering. Finally, the term cause is also employed in sense III in the theoretical sciences of nature where\n\nthat which is caused is an event or state of things and its cause is another event or state of things such that (a) if the cause happens or exists, the effect must happen or exist even if no further conditions are fulfilled (b) the effect cannot happen or exist unless the cause happens or exists. (EM 1998: 285\u201386)\n\nThe main difference between sense II and sense III of the term is that whereas in the practical sciences of nature the cause of an event is an antecedent state of affairs considered from the point of view of an interest in controlling and manipulating the natural environment, in the theoretical sciences of nature the causes of natural events are viewed independently of any impact that agents can have on the natural environment: a cause in sense III is unconditional. The key difference between sense I, on the one hand, and sense II and III on the other, is that in sense II and III a cause is an antecedent condition, whereas in sense I it is a logical ground. When one explains an agent\u2019s intention in acting by ascribing the agent a motive or reason, the action is explained not by invoking something that went on before (an antecedent condition in the form of an inner psychological process) but the motive which rationalises it. Conflating sense I with either sense II or III is to conflate normative/rationalizing with causal explanations thereby also failing to grasp the distinction between their respective explananda: actions and events. The distinction between the different senses of causation, like the distinction between the expedient and the right, is not a distinction between separate classes of things; it is a distinction between concepts that may coincide in their instances.\n\n2.2 Presuppositional analysis\n\nCollingwood returned to the question of the role of philosophical analysis in his second metaphilosophical treatise, An Essay on Metaphysics (1940). While the commitment to the view that philosophy disambiguates concepts that coincide in their instances persists, Collingwood presents the role of philosophical analysis in a different way, by saying that philosophy\u2019s task is to uncover the presuppositions of thought. This change of emphasis, as we shall see, is at least in part motivated by an attempt to present his metaphilosophical views in a language to which the emerging school of analytic philosophy would have been more receptive and to engage in a dialogue with A.J. Ayer\u2019s logical positivist critique of metaphysics.\n\nThe task of philosophy, Collingwood claims in An Essay on Metaphysics, is not to assert propositions in answers to questions but to uncover presuppositions. Philosophy is therefore concerned not with propositions but with presuppositions. Propositions are answers to questions. For example, the proposition \u201cThis is a clothes line\u201d answers the question \u201cWhat is that thing for?\u201d (EM 1998: 24). Presuppositions, on the other hand give rise to questions. When one asks, \u201cWhat is that thing for?\u201d one must presuppose \u201cthat it is \u2018for\u2019 something\u201d (EM 1998: 26). Without any presuppositions the question would not arise.\n\nPresuppositions differ from propositions in one fundamental respect: propositions have truth-values. They are asserted as either true or false. Presuppositions, on the other hand lack truth values; they are neither true nor false. This is because they do not fulfil their role (that of giving rise to questions) in virtue of being true or false. Just as the validity of an inference does not depend on whether the premises from which the inference is drawn are true or false, so the \u201clogical efficacy\u201d (EM 1998: 27) of a presupposition, i.e., its power to give rise to a question, does not depend on the presupposition being either true or false, or even on being believed to be true or false. This consideration, Collingwood says,\n\nis a matter of common knowledge in scientific thinking; where it is common and even profitable to argue from suppositions we know to be false, or which we believe to be false, or concerning which we have neither knowledge nor belief as to whether we are false or true. These doubts or negations in no way affect the validity of the argument. (EM 1998: 28)\n\nWhether a statement is a \u201cproposition\u201d or a \u201cpresupposition\u201d is determined not by its content but by the role that the statement plays in the logic of question and answer. If its role is to answer a question, then it is a proposition and it has a truth-value. If its role is to give rise to a question, then it is a presupposition and it does not have a truth-value. Some statements can play different roles. They may be both propositional answers to questions and presuppositions which give rise to questions. For example, that an object is for something, that it has a function may be a presupposition which gives rise to the question \u201cwhat is that thing for?\u201d, but it may also be an answer to a question if the statement has the role of an assertion. Philosophical analysis is concerned with a special kind of presupposition, one which has only one role in the logic of question and answer, namely that of giving rise to questions. Collingwood calls these presuppositions \u201cabsolute\u201d. Absolute presuppositions are foundational assumptions that enable certain lines of questioning but are not themselves open to scrutiny. The three senses of causation discussed above are examples of absolute presuppositions which structure different forms of inquiry. A physician, for example, absolutely presupposes sense II of causation, according which a cause is\n\nan event or state of things by producing or preventing which we can produce or prevent that whose cause it is said to be. (EM 1998: 296\u20137)\n\nQua practical scientist of nature, the physician absolutely presupposes a handle or manipulability conception of causation which makes it possible to intervene in nature to achieve certain intended results, i.e., to restore health. This sense of causation is at work in statement such as \u201cThe cause of malaria is the bite of a mosquito\u201d (EM 1998: 299) or \u201cthe cause of a man\u2019s sweating is a dose of aspirin\u201d (EM 1998: 299). The presupposition is absolute because it could not be questioned without at the same time undermining the kind of inquiry it makes possible. Absolute presuppositions in this respect differ from relative presuppositions. A physician prescribes a dose of aspirin on the assumption it will cause a patient to break into a sweat. This presupposition is relative because it could potentially be overthrown by future research. But the underlying conception of causation is a condition sine qua non for practising medicine. It is these absolute presuppositions that philosophy seeks to uncover by regressing from propositional answers to the questions they are answers to, and from the questions to the presuppositions which must be made for the questions to arise.\n\nCollingwood\u2019s denial that absolute presuppositions have truth values informs a commitment to a kind of explanatory pluralism according to which the choice between different kinds of explanation does not depend on whether they capture pure being but on whether they are fit for purpose. He illustrates this explanatory pluralism by imagining a scenario in which a car stops while driving up a steep hill. As the driver stands by the side of the road a passerby, who happens to be a theoretical physicist offers his help. The car, he explains, has stopped because\n\nthe top of a hill is farther removed from the earth\u2019s centre than its bottom and \u2026 consequently more power is needed to take the car uphill than to take her along the level. (EM 1998: 302)\n\nA second passerby (who happens to be an Automobile Association man) proffers a different explanation: he holds up a loose cable and says \u201cLook here, Sir, you are running on three cylinders\u201d (EM 1998: 303). The first explanation invokes the sense of causation that belongs to the theoretical sciences of nature, sense III. The second explanation invokes the sense of causation that belongs to the practical sciences of nature, sense II. The choice between these explanations, for Collingwood is determined by the nature of the question asked. As he puts it:\n\nIf I had been a person who could flatten out hills by stamping on them the passerby would have been right to call my attention to the hill as the cause of the stoppage; not because the hill was a hill but because I was able to flatten it out. (EM 1998: 303)\n\nThis scenario illustrates that there are different explanations, corresponding to different senses of causation, each answering a different kind of question. When the different senses of causation are disambiguated, then it becomes clear that there is no conflict between the explanation of the theoretical physicist and that of the car mechanic, because they answer different kinds of questions, questions which differ because they are entailed by different absolute presuppositions. Explanations genuinely conflict with one another only if they provide answers to the same question, but they do not if they are answering different questions. The task of presuppositional analysis is to undo the conceptual knots in which our thoughts get tangled when we mix and match answers of one kind with questions of another by failing to see the entailment relations which hold between presuppositions, the question to which they give rise, and the sort of propositional answers which address those questions:\n\nIn unscientific thinking our thoughts are coagulated into knots and tangles; we fish up a thought out of our minds like an anchor foul of its own cable, hanging upside-down and draped in seaweed with shellfish sticking to it and dump the whole thing on deck quite pleased with ourselves for having got it up at all. Thinking scientifically means disentangling all this mess, and reducing a knot of thoughts in which everything sticks together anyhow to a system or series of thoughts in which thinking the thoughts is at the same time thinking the connexions between them. (EM 1998: 22\u201323)\n\nThe logical inquiry into the connections holding between presuppositions, questions and answers is the true task of conceptual analysis in metaphysics, a task that must replace metaphysics traditionally understood as the study of pure being. There is no such thing as knowledge of pure being because there can be no presuppositionless knowledge and there can be no presuppositionless knowledge because all knowledge is pursued in answer to questions and no question could arise if no presuppositions were made. The study of reality under the different aspects enabled by the adoption of different presuppositions is not an ontological but a logical enquiry and metaphysics, so understood is, a \u201cmetaphysics without ontology\u201d (EM 1998: 18).\n\nFailure to recognise that knowledge rests on presuppositions encourages the belief that pure being is a possible object of knowledge. Traditionally it was metaphysics that was deemed to be the science of pure being. In the aftermath of the scientific revolution this role was increasingly claimed by the most fundamental of the sciences: physics. If Collingwood\u2019s claim that metaphysics should take the form of a logical enquiry into presuppositions is right, then there is no contest between metaphysics and physics or more generally between philosophy and (natural) science because no form of knowledge can claim the title of science of pure being. Philosophy does not conflict with natural science because it does not advance claims about the nature of reality but about the presuppositions under which all sciences, including natural science, operate. Nor is there conflict between (natural) science and other forms of knowledge because different forms of knowledge answer different kinds of questions, questions which arise from different presuppositions. In reminding philosophers that all knowledge, including scientific knowledge, rests on presuppositions, Collingwood rehabilitates the older, Latin sense of the term scientia which is not synonymous with natural science but with \u201ca body of systematic or orderly thinking about a determinate subject-matter\u201d (EM 1998: 4). The use of \u201cscience\u201d to mean \u201cnatural science\u201d is a slang use of the term (EM 1998: 4) that has that is symptomatic of the prevalence of scientism, the belief that only scientific knowledge is a form of knowledge and that science can answer all questions.\n\nCollingwood\u2019s account of absolute presuppositions generates an interesting angle on the question of scepticism concerning induction. Hume had argued that inductive inferences rely on the principle of the uniformity of nature. If it is true that the future resembles the past, then inferences such as \u201cthe sun will rise tomorrow\u201d are inductively justified. However, since the principle is neither a proposition about matters of fact nor one about relations of ideas the proposition \u201cnature is uniform\u201d is an illegitimate metaphysical proposition and inductive inferences lack justification. The principle of the uniformity of nature, Collingwood argues, is not a proposition, but an absolute presupposition, one which cannot be denied without undermining empirical science. As it is an absolute presupposition the notion of verifiability does not apply to it because it does its job not in so far as it is true, or even believed to be true, but in so far as it is presupposed. The demand that it should be verified is nonsensical and the question that Hume ask does not therefore arise:\n\n\u2026any question involving the presupposition that an absolute presupposition is a proposition, such as the question \u201cIs it true?\u201d \u201cWhat evidence is there for it?\u201d \u201cHow can it be demonstrated?\u201d \u201cWhat right have we to presuppose it if it can\u2019t?\u201d, is a nonsense question. (EM 1998: 33)\n\nSimilar considerations, as we shall see later, are invoked by Collingwood against Ayer\u2019s principle of verifiability.\n\n2.3 The \u201cradical conversion\u201d hypothesis\n\nThere is clearly continuity between Collingwood\u2019s account of the nature of philosophical distinctions, as developed in An Essay on Philosophical Method and his later claim in An Essay on Metaphysics that the role of presuppositional analysis is to undo the conceptual knots in which unsystematic thinking gets tangled. His attempt to disambiguate the different senses of causation in An Essay on Metaphysics seems to be engaging in a task akin to what in An Essay on Philosophical Method he described as the distinguishing of concepts that coincide in their instances. Yet a major issue of contention in Collingwood scholarship concerns whether Collingwood\u2019s later work, beginning with An Essay on Metaphysics, historicized his earlier conception of the role of philosophical analysis. This is because An Essay on Metaphysics contains a fundamental ambiguity. On the one hand it presents presuppositional analysis as the task of regressing from propositional answers to questions and from questions to presuppositions. This is a logical task aimed at putting order in our thoughts and getting rid of conceptual confusions. On the other hand, it presents presuppositions as historical beliefs thereby suggesting that the goal of presuppositional analysis is not so much to get rid of conceptual confusion as to describe what certain people believed in different periods of time. Metaphysics, Collingwood says\n\nis the attempt to find out what absolute presuppositions have been made by this or that person or group of persons, on this or that occasion or group of occasions, in the course of this or that occasion or group of occasions, in the course of this or that piece of thinking. (EM 1998: 47)\n\nStatements such as these have a strong historicist flavour. This ambiguity exposes a tension between two different conceptions of the role of philosophical analysis. On the first conception the task of philosophy is to delineate the subject matters of different forms of knowledge and denounce the encroachment of one form of knowledge on the subject matter of another. The emphasis is on explanatory pluralism, not historical relativism. The defence of the autonomy of historical explanation in The Idea of History, for example, implies that the role of philosophical analysis is to identify the distinctive presuppositions of history and to distinguish them from those of natural science with a view to combating scientism. The second conception, by contrast, places the emphasis on historical relativism rather than explanatory pluralism. It is this second conception of the role of philosophical analysis in An Essay on Metaphysics that has led to the view that Collingwood\u2019s later metaphilosophy differs substantially from his earlier view of the role of philosophical analysis, a view sometimes referred to as \u201cthe radical conversion hypothesis\u201d. The hypothesis of a historicist turn was first advanced by Malcolm Knox in the editorial introduction to the posthumously published The Idea of History. It was also endorsed by early commentators such as A. Donagan (1962 and 1972), Toulmin (1972) and N. Rotenstreich (1972). The expression \u201cradical conversion hypothesis\u201d, however, was actually coined by Rubinoff (1966) who alongside Mink (1969) rejected it as an inadequate description of Collingwood\u2019s position. This is still a live debate in Collingwood scholarship, although more recent studies (Martin 1989; Modood 1989; Connelly 1990; Oldfield 1995; Beaney 2005; D\u2019Oro 2002, 2010) tend to emphasise the unity rather than discontinuity in Collingwood\u2019s metaphilosophical approach.\n\n2.4 The ontological argument and the correspondence with Ryle\n\nThe question concerning the relation between Collingwood\u2019s two metaphilosophical treatises and whether the conception of the role of philosophical analysis articulated in An Essay on Metaphysics is continuous with that described in An Essay on Philosophical Method is further complicated by the fact that An Essay on Philosophical Method contains a defence of the ontological argument that appears to be at odds with Collingwood\u2019s later claim that metaphysics is a logical, not an ontological inquiry and with the assertion that presuppositional analysis is a form of \u201cmetaphysics without ontology\u201d. The ontological proof is normally regarded as the pinnacle of metaphysical knowledge, knowledge that is both necessary (as a priori knowledge) and has existential import (as empirical knowledge). Collingwood\u2019s allegiance to the ontological proof in An Essay on Philosophical Method would therefore seem to provide further evidence for the hypothesis of a rift between Collingwood\u2019s earlier and later conception of philosophical analysis because it seems to be advancing the sort of robust metaphysical claims which Collingwood\u2019s later conception of metaphysics is keen to leave behind. However, the detail of Collingwood\u2019s discussion of the ontological proof suggests that he had a rather unorthodox understanding of what the ontological proof establishes (D\u2019Oro 2002). Paradoxical as this might sound, he did not seem to think that the ontological proof establishes any substantive ontological conclusions and that it yields the sort of metaphysical knowledge he later explicitly claimed to be impossible. His concern with the ontological proof was intricately connected with an attempt to delineate the subject matter of philosophical analysis, not the existence of metaphysical entities. God, for Collingwood, is \u201cthat which we are thinking about when we are thinking philosophically\u201d (Collingwood\u2019s 1935 private letter to Ryle, published in the 2005 edition of An Essay on Philosophical Method, EPM 2005: 257). This claim may be clarified by saying that philosophical concepts are not contingently instantiated in an empirical class of objects (as we have seen, they do not sort things into classes); they are necessarily instantiated in the forms of judgement or inference which they make possible. For example, the concept of the good, qua expediency, is necessarily instantiated in hypothetical or instrumental imperatives and the concept of mind is necessarily instantiated in judgements which explain actions qua expression of thought. This is the kernel of truth that, according to Collingwood, is worth restating in the ontological argument.\n\nCollingwood\u2019s discussion of the ontological argument in An Essay on Philosophical Method gave rise to a lively epistolary exchange with Ryle (the exchange is published in the 2005 edition of An Essay on Philosophical Method). The correspondence was triggered by the publication of an article in Mind by Ryle (1935) which attacked Collingwood\u2019s sympathetic appraisal of the ontological proof on the grounds that there are no such things as propositions which are both necessary and existential, i.e., no such things as metaphysical propositions, like the one asserting the necessary existence of God. Collingwood replied to Ryle in a private letter by claiming that that there is a third kind of proposition, philosophical propositions, which feature philosophical concepts, propositions such as \u201cMind exists\u201d or \u201cMatter exists\u201d. Such propositions are necessary but not merely hypothetical because the philosophical concepts whose existence they assert are necessarily instantiated in the judgements employed by the practitioners of a given science. \u201cMind exists\u201d in so far as one explains actions by means of rationalisations, rather than nomological explanations; the concept of mind is embedded in the kind of judgement or inference that it makes possible. The main bone of contention in the correspondence between Ryle and Collingwood was therefore not the ontological argument in its traditional form, but whether or not philosophy has an autonomous domain of inquiry, i.e., whether there are distinctive philosophical concepts, (concepts which allow for complete extensional overlap). As we have seen Collingwood later revisited the claim that philosophy has an autonomous domain of inquiry in An Essay on Metaphysics, where he reformulated it by saying that philosophy is not an ontological but a logical enquiry into the presuppositions which govern thought.\n\nIn spite of Collingwood\u2019s attempts to qualify his commitment to the ontological argument Ryle continued to read Collingwood\u2019s defence of the ontological proof at face value refusing to accept that the ontological proof could properly be interpreted as anything other than what it states on the label, i.e., an argument for the existence of God. Collingwood, for his part, insisted on illustrating what the subject matter of philosophy is, by defending a highly controversial interpretation of what the ontological proof establishes. Be this as it may, the misunderstandings between Collingwood and Ryle show how very difficult it must have been for Collingwood to translate his insights in the language of the burgeoning school of analytic philosophy. In spite of the misunderstandings it involves, the Collingwood-Ryle correspondence reveals some of the issues which truly troubled philosophers in the first half of the twentieth century and offers a fascinating window onto the origins of analytic philosophy (D\u2019Oro 2000; Vrijen 2006).\n\n2.5 The metaphilosophical battle with Ayer\n\nIn the debate with Ryle which unfolded on the pages of Mind and in the private correspondence Collingwood had tried to defend the claim that there is a distinctive kind of proposition which captures the subject matter of philosophy, but his attempt to capture the distinctive subject matter of philosophical analysis was dismissed by Ryle as being of a piece with a dusty old metaphysics. The drastic change of terminology in An Essay on Metaphysics is at least in part an attempt to defend the claim that philosophy has a distinctive subject matter different from both that of the exact and the natural sciences, but to do so in a way that would not lend itself to the kind of misunderstanding that led Ryle to dismiss Collingwood\u2019s metaphilosophical vision as belonging to an idealist metaphysics of the sort that analytic philosophy wanted to leave behind. This terminological change put Collingwood in a better position to engage with the revival of empiricism at the hands of A.J. Ayer. In Language Truth and Logic (1936) Ayer revitalised Hume\u2019s critique of metaphysics by invoking the principle of verifiability, according to which propositions are meaningful insofar as they are empirically verifiable. Propositions which are not empirically verifiable are nonsense unless they are tautologies. As far as Collingwood was concerned Ayer\u2019s revival of the Humean fork had unpalatable metaphilosophical implications because it entailed that to be meaningful the claims of philosophy must be either empirically verifiable, as the propositions of natural science, or analytic truths, as the propositions of exact science. An Essay on Metaphysics is a pointed attack on the metaphilosophical implications of this claim. Ayer\u2019s commitment to the view that there are only two types of legitimate propositions, empirical and analytic, was, for Collingwood, based on a failure to acknowledge that statements can play different roles in the logic of question and answer. Some statements are answers to questions and, in so far as their role is to answer questions, they are truth evaluable. But some statements have a different role, namely, to give rise to questions and they perform this role not in so far as they are true or false, but in so far as they are presupposed. As such they are not truth evaluable, because they are not asserted as propositional answers to questions. Statements such as \u201ca cause is an event by producing or preventing which one can produce or prevent that whose cause it is said to be\u201d (sense II of causation) is not asserted by the philosopher as a proposition. What the philosopher asserts is not \u201ccauses in sense II exist or are true of an inquiry independent reality\u201d (which would be an illegitimate metaphysical proposition) but rather \u201ccauses in sense II are absolutely presupposed in the practical sciences of nature\u201d. Philosophy yields not first order knowledge but second order knowledge or understanding of the presuppositions on which knowledge rests. Ayer\u2019s classification of propositions along the lines of the Human fork conflates presuppositions with propositions and, as a result, fails to acknowledge that philosophy has a distinctive subject matter, namely absolute presuppositions, and a distinctive role, to detect presuppositions. Absolute presuppositions are not reducible either to the propositions of the exact or those of the natural sciences. Nor are they ruled out as meaningless propositions by the principle of verifiability because, since they are not propositions, the notion of verifiability does not apply to them.\n\n2.6 Realism and idealism\n\nCollingwood is often referred to as a British idealist, but his allegiance to idealism was in large measure a response to the Oxford realism he had imbibed as a student and continued to profess until around 1916. Hence he tended to be rather wary of the label \u201cidealist\u201d, and in his correspondence with Gilbert Ryle he explicitly rejected it (EPM 2005: 256). However, in his lectures on Central Problems of Metaphysics (1935) he tentatively propounded a form of what he termed \u201cobjective idealism.\u201d But, nonetheless, as in his response to Ryle, he continued to rail against those who sought to pin his position down to an \u201cism\u201d, once remarking that \"I am not going to be pigeon-holed into one of your neat categories. Philosophy is a process of inquiry, not dogmatic positions\" (Hector 2000).\n\nThis reluctance is probably due to the fact that idealism is most often identified with immaterialism and he would not have wished his criticism of realism to be interpreted as resting on a commitment to the claim that the real is ideal or that mind is causally responsible for the existence of reality. If the contrast between idealism and realism is understood as one between two metaphysical views concerning the ontological constitution of reality (is it mental? Is it material?) Collingwood had nothing to contribute to the debate between realists and idealists; he would have regarded it as belonging to metaphysics as the study of pure being, not as metaphysics understood as a form of presuppositional analysis. In An Autobiography (1939) he contrasted realism not with immaterialism but with the commitment to presuppositionless knowledge or the realist view propounded by Cook Wilson and Prichard that \u201cknowing makes no difference to what is known\u201d (AA 2013: 44). Denying realism, so understood, is to deny that there can be any such thing as knowledge of pure being. Since all knowledge takes the form of answers to questions, and all questions rest on presuppositions, knowledge necessarily has presuppositions. Collingwood\u2019s critique of realism therefore takes Kant\u2019s criticism of the possibility of knowing things as they are in themselves a step further. Kant did not deny that talk about knowledge of things as they are in themselves is coherent; he simply claimed that this sort of knowledge is unavailable to us. Collingwood\u2019s critique of realism, by contrast, denies that there is any such thing as presuppositionless knowledge. Presuppositionless knowledge is not a kind of knowledge that it is not possible for us to acquire but may be available to another being, such as God: the idea of presuppositionless knowledge involves an oxymoron because all knowing involves presuppositions.\n\n3. History and Science\n\n3.1 The historical past and the presuppositions of historical inquiry\n\nAn Essay on Metaphysics contains a general statement of Collingwood\u2019s metaphilosophy and his view that metaphysics is not an ontological inquiry into pure being but a logical inquiry that takes the form of presuppositional analysis. While An Essay on Metaphysics explained, in the most general terms, what presuppositional analysis is, The Idea of History (1946) and The Principles of History (1999) seek to uncover the presuppositions governing historical inquiry into the past. Collingwood\u2019s philosophy of history asks the question: \u201cwhat are the presuppositions that govern the historical understanding of the past?\u201d and \u201cwhat does it mean to understand the past historically?\u201d The nature of Collingwood\u2019s concern with the past is not metaphysical. He is not advancing a theory concerning the nature of time, whether, for example, it is ever-present or a growing block. Nor is it primarily an epistemological concern with the question of how one acquires knowledge of the past, given that it is not available for observation, although he does address some epistemological questions. The nature of his concern with the nature of the past is first and foremost a conceptual concern with the question \u201cWhat is the historical past? What does it mean to understand the past historically?\u201d\n\nThe historical past is the past understood historically, i.e., from the perspective of certain presuppositions, presuppositions that give rise to certain kinds of questions, questions that are distinctive of historical inquiry and differ from those of natural science. The past in so far as it is understood historically (the historical past) is therefore not the same thing as the past as it is studied by a natural scientist. Just as the term \u201ccause\u201d needs to be disambiguated to avoid conceptual confusion, so does the term \u201cpast\u201d because it means different things to the humanistically oriented historiographer as it does, for example, to a geologist:\n\nThere is a certain analogy between the archaeologist\u2019s interpretation of a stratified site and a geologist\u2019s interpretation of rock-horizons with their associated fossils; but the difference is no less clear than the similarity. The archaeologist\u2019s use of his stratified relics depends on his conceiving them as artifacts serving human purposes and thus expressing a particular way in which men have thought of their own life; and from his point of view the palaeontologist, arranging his fossils in a time-series, is not working as an historian, but only as a scientist thinking in a way which can at most be described as quasi-historical. (IH 1993: 212)\n\nWhile both the geologist and the historian are concerned with the past, the questions that they ask and the presuppositions which give rise to those questions are different. Scientific inquiry rests on the presupposition of the uniformity of nature. This principle is required to formulate the inductive hypotheses which enable empirical scientists to predict what will happen in the future and retrodict what happened in the past. Empirically minded scientists presuppose that everything that happens is subject to natural laws which are invariant over time, for example, that water freezes at 0\u00b0 Celsius under the reign of Queen Victoria as well as the time of Henry VIII. But while this presupposition is well suited to serve the explanatory goals of natural science, it is of limited use to historians who are concerned not with what is invariant throughout history, but with what is distinctive about different periods of time. It would not help an Egyptologist to understand the rituals of the ancient Egyptian to ascribe them the mindset of a medieval feudal baron. As Collingwood puts it:\n\nTypes of behaviour do, no doubt, recur, so long as minds of the same kind are placed in the same kind of situations. The behaviour-patterns characteristic of a feudal baron were no doubt fairly constant so long as there were feudal barons living in a feudal society. But they will be sought in vain (except by an inquirer content with the loosest and most fanciful analogies) in a world whose social structure is of another kind. In order that behaviour-patterns may be constant, there must be in existence a social order which recurrently produces situations of a certain kind. But social orders are historical facts, and subject to inevitable change, fast or slow. A positive science of mind will, no doubt, be able to establish uniformities and recurrences, but it can have no guarantee that the laws it establishes will hold good beyond the historical period from which its facts are drawn. (IH 1993: 223\u2013224)\n\nCollingwood is critical of those philosophers who, like Bradley (1874), bring the presuppositions of natural science to bear upon the study of the historical past. It is not the role of historians to dismiss as false the testimony of historical agents who attest to the occurrence of miracles on the grounds that since nature is uniform and its laws do not change, the miracles past agents attested to could not have happened because their occurrence contravenes the laws of nature. This \u201cpositivistic spirit\u201d (IH 1993: 135\u201336) encourages a judgmental attitude towards the historical sources rather than an attempt to understand their meaning. This is not to say that historians need to believe that miracles happened in order to understand the sources, but rather that understanding the role that belief in the supernatural had for the agents who witnessed to them is more important for the historian than assessing whether belief in the supernatural is true or false:\n\nIf the reasons why it is hard for a man to cross the mountains is because he is frightened of the devils in them, it is folly for the historian, preaching at him across a gulf of centuries, to say \u201cThis is sheer superstition, there are no devils at all. Face facts, and realize there are no dangers in the mountains except rocks and water and snow, wolves perhaps, and bad men perhaps, but no devils.\u201d The historian says that these are the facts because that is the way in which he has been taught to think. But the devil-fearer says that the presence of devils is a fact, because that is the way in which he has been taught to think. The historian thinks it a wrong way; but wrong ways of thinking are just as much historical facts as right ones, and, no less than they, determine the situation (always a thought-situation) in which the man who shares them is placed. (IH 1993: 317)\n\nThe important question concerning any statement contained in an historical source \u201cis not whether it is true or false, but what it means\u201d (IH 1993: 260). Ignoring this advice leads to writing \u201cscissors-and-paste\u201d histories where the sources are treated as worthwhile historical material and admitted into the historian\u2019s narrative only if they are deemed to be believable by the historian\u2019s own standards of evidence. To understand the past historically is to understand the \u201ccontext of thought\u201d (IH 1993: 299) of past agents, their frame of mind. What makes an investigation historical, therefore, is not simply the fact that it is focused on the past, but the kind of concerns by which it is guided when investigating the past. To understand past agents is to understand the way in which they reasoned, the inferences that they drew, the conceptual connections which they made, the symbolic significance they attached to certain events. Understanding a past occurrence, such as Caesar\u2019s crossing of the Rubicon historically, for example, is to understand the significance that it had for a contemporary Roman who knew what Roman law permitted and proscribed. This is what differentiates a concern with the historical past from a concern with the natural past:\n\nThe historian, investigating an event in the past, makes a distinction between what may be called the outside and the inside of an event. By the outside of the event I mean everything belonging to it which can be described in terms of bodies and their movements: the passage of Caesar, accompanied by certain men, across a river called the Rubicon at one date, or the spilling of his blood across the floor of the senate-house at another. By the inside of the event I mean that in it which can only be described in terms of thought: Caesar\u2019s defiance of Republican law, or the clash of constitutional policy between himself and his assassins. The historian is never concerned with either of these to the exclusion of the other. He is investigating not mere events (where by a mere event I mean one which has only an outside and no inside) but actions, and an action is the unity of the outside and the inside of an event. He is interested in the crossing of the Rubicon only in its relation to Republican law, and in the spilling of Caesar\u2019s blood only in relation to a constitutional conflict. (IH 1993: 213)\n\nTo understand Caesar\u2019s crossing of the Rubicon against the background of Republican law is to understand the crossing as transgressing not a law of nature (natural laws apply uniformly to the present, past, and future), but a military norm which banned armed generals from crossing a border (norms, unlike natural laws, change from time to time). Understanding actions historically requires understanding them more like responses to commands that may be followed or disregarded, than as instances (or counter instances) of empirical laws. When understood historically, therefore, the actions of past agents are explained more in the manner in which one understands the action of a motorist who stops at a traffic light (i.e., as abiding by a traffic regulation) than they are in the way in which an astronomer retrodicts the death of a star. The mindset of past agents cannot be investigated under the presupposition which governs empirical science, i.e., the uniformity of nature, because the study of mind, is a \u201cnormative or criteriological enquiry\u201d (PA: 171, footnote).\n\nThe distinction between the historical past and the natural past corresponds to the distinction between the subject matters of the sciences of mind and nature: the former study actions, in so far as they explain what happens as an expression of thought, the latter study events insofar as they approach their subject matter as instantiating certain observable patterns. As such \u201cactions\u201d and \u201cevents\u201d are the correlatives of different kinds inferences. Collingwood captured the distinction between actions and events by claiming that the former have an inside which the latter lack (IH 1993: 118). The point of this claim was to draw attention to the fact that the meaning or significance of an action eludes nomological explanations which account for what happens by subsuming their explanandum under general laws. A historian might, for example, observe certain empirical regularities (in the past every time that white smoke emanated from the Sistine chapel in Rome, large crowds of people cheered), without understanding \u201cwhy\u201d in a particular sense of \u201cwhy\u201d the crowds cheered. If a social scientist suggested that the crowds cheered because white smoke emanated from the Sistine Chapel, this kind of \u201cbecause\u201d would singularly fail to address the question that the historian wants answered. The kind of explanation that would satisfy the curiosity of the historian is one which states something along the lines of \u201cthe crowds cheered because a new pope was elected\u201d but such an explanation would not be possible without invoking the \u201ccontext of thought\u201d within which alone one can understand the symbolic significance of the white smoke. Words like \u201ccause\u201d or \u201cbecause\u201d, Collingwood claims, are not necessarily\n\nout of place in reference to history; it only means that they are used there in a special sense. When a scientist asks: \u201cWhy did that piece of litmus paper turn pink?\u201d he means \u201cOn what kinds of occasions do pieces of litmus paper turn pink?\u201d When an historian asks \u201cWhy did Brutus stab Caesar?\u201d he means \u201cWhat did Brutus think, which made him decide to stab Caesar?\u201d The cause of the event, for him, means the thought in the mind of the person by whose agency the event came about: and this is not something other than the event, it is the inside of the event itself. (IH 1993: 214\u2013215)\n\nThe inside/outside distinction that Collingwood often invokes to explicate the differences between the subject matters of history and science is a highly metaphorical way of defending a commitment to explanatory pluralism and the irreducibility of historical to scientific explanations. This metaphor has unfortunately sometimes been read literally, leading to Collingwood being unfairly attacked for defending the view that the subject matter of history is an internal, unobservable psychological process and for putting forward an equally implausible method for accessing it: re-enactment.\n\n3.2 Re-enactment\n\nOne of the most discussed aspects of Collingwood\u2019s philosophy of history is his claim that the historical past is not retrodicted but re-enacted. The task of historians is not to establish that a past event had to happen in the past, in a way analogous to that in which a scientist predicts that a solar eclipse will happen in the future, but to re-enact the thoughts of historical agents. Collingwood claims that when historians re-enact the thought of an historical agent, they do not re-enact a thought of a similar kind but the very same thought as the agent. This claim has often been regarded as counterintuitive because to say that the thought of the agent and that of the historian are one and the same appears to presuppose that there is only one rather than two numerically distinct acts of thought: that of the historian and that of the agent. Collingwood\u2019s point, however, is that, since what the historian re-enacts, i.e., the propositional content of thought (he refers to this simply as thought) is distinct from the acts of thinking (he refers to these as sensations/feelings), the criterion of identity that is normally applied to individuate acts of thinking does not apply to thought (IH 1993: 287). Acts of thinking are individuated and distinguished from one another by adopting spatial criteria. By contrast thoughts (i.e., propositional contents) are individuated on the basis of purely qualitative criteria, so that if there are two people entertaining the (qualitatively) same thought, there is (numerically) only one thought since there is only one propositional content. For Collingwood, if Jane and Jim recite the practical syllogism \u201cAll men are mortal, Socrates is a man, therefore Socrates is mortal\u201d they entertain one and the same thought. By the same token, a historian who re-enacts the thought of a past agent entertains the very same thought as the historical agent:\n\n\u2026 in its immediacy, as an actual experience of his own, Plato\u2019s argument must undoubtedly have grown up out of a discussion of some sort, though I do not know what it was, and been closely connected to such a discussion. Yet if I not only read his argument but understand it, follow it in my own mind re-enacting it with and for myself, the process of argument which I go through is not a process resembling Plato\u2019s, it is actually Plato\u2019s so far as I understand him correctly. (IH 1993: 301)\n\nAs the last clause in the quotation makes clear, Collingwood\u2019s account of re-enactment aims to establish a conceptual point about what exactly it is that historians re-enact (the thought as opposed to the acts of thinking) and what the criteria for identifying and distinguishing thoughts are. It is not meant to prescribe to historians an empathetic method for the recovery of inner psychological processes which are not accessible from a third person perspective (Saari 1984 and 1989; Van der Dussen 1981 and 1995; D\u2019Oro 2000). Unfortunately the doctrine of re-enactment has been widely read not as attempting to identify the subject matter of history (thought, rather than acts of thinking), but as seeking to articulate a method by which historian can recover hidden psychological processes that are not accessible from the third person perspective. In the aftermath of the publication of The Idea of History, the re-enactment doctrine was widely associated with Dilthey\u2019s account of empathetic understanding and accused of ascribing to the historian implausible telepathic powers of access to other minds (Gardiner 1952a and 1952b).\n\nCollingwood\u2019s account of re-enactment could be criticised for over-rationalizing the subject matter of history. His identification of the object of re-enactment with \u201cthought\u201d, and of history as a criteriological or normative inquiry into thought, to the exclusion of \u201cfeelings\u201d or \u201csensations\u201d, might seem too restrictive since a great deal of action is not rational, and irrationality has been the driving force behind much that has happened in history. When considering this objection, one must bear in mind that \u201chistory\u201d understood as a form of inquiry distinct from natural science should not be conflated with \u201chistory\u201d as an academic discipline practised in university departments. Practising historians will inevitably be concerned with much more than \u201cthought\u201d and the specific norms by which past agents led their lives. They will inevitably mention irrational factors, just as they mention arational natural forces (earthquakes, floods and other natural phenomena that impact on historical agents). Collingwood\u2019s goal was not to tell historians what they can and cannot say about what happened in the past, but to distinguish between two very different ways in which the past can be approached: under the assumption of the uniformity of nature and under the assumption that the deeds of historical agents are responses to norms rather than instances of natural laws.\n\nCollingwood\u2019s account of re-enactment certainly implies that the historical past is in principle knowable, that it is possible to mediate reality through the conceptual framework, for example, of the ancient Egyptians or the ancient Greeks. This is not to say that the past can be known in itself, or independently of any conceptual mediation, but that it can be seen from the perspective of past agents, through the categorial framework that mediated their conception of reality. While there are additional epistemic obstacles in the way of understanding agents from a distant past, agents who we cannot engage in a live conversation, knowledge of the past is in principle achievable because understanding past agents is not a radically different task from that of understanding the thoughts of our contemporaries. Historical knowledge, Collingwood says\n\nis not concerned only with a remote past. It is by historical thinking that we re-think and so rediscover the thoughts of Hammurabi or Solon, it is in the same way that we discover the thought of a friend who writes us a letter, or a friend who crosses the street. (IH 1993: 219)\n\nIn so far as Collingwood\u2019s account of re-enactment defends the possibility of knowing the past as it always was for historical agents (the historian, as we have seen, seeks to establish what crossing the Rubicon meant to a Roman cognizant of Republican law) it goes against a view that became dominant in the latter part of the twentieth century, according to which the past cannot be known as it always was because it is constantly and necessarily revised from the perspective of the present. This view was endorsed with varying degrees of emphasis in the philosophical hermeneutics of H-G. Gadamer, in the philosophy of history, and the philosophy of language. Gadamer\u2019s philosophical hermeneutics claimed that the past \u201cis understood only if it is understood in a different way every time\u201d (1960 [1975: 275]) because the meaning of a text is the result of a fusion of the horizons of the text to be interpreted and the horizon of the interpreter. In the philosophy of history narrativists such as Hayden White (1973), Frank Ankersmit (1983) and Keith Jenkins (1991) emphasised the cultural endowment of the historian as the lens through which the past is accessed. Even the philosophy of language was not immune from this trend. Quine (1960) famously denied that it is possible to achieve determinacy in translation in direct opposition to Collingwood\u2019s claim that it is at least in principle possible to re-enact the very same thought as the historical agent. This revisionary view of the past goes against Collingwood\u2019s conception of what it means to understand the past historically. The task of the historian, as he saw it, is to transport us to another world by immersing oneself in the historical agent\u2019s own context of thought.\n\n3.3 The argument against methodological unity\n\nCollingwood\u2019s philosophy of history is a sustained attempt to delineate the subject matter of history and why this subject matter cannot be captured by adopting the methods of natural science. He is critical of the argument, advanced by John Stuart Mill that the distinction between the human and the natural sciences is merely a distinction in the degree of accuracy that can be reached in their respective domains of inquiry. In his System of Logic (1843), Mill argued that the subject matter of psychology differs from that of the natural sciences because psychology studies human actions. Yet the method by which the psychologist studies human actions is the same (inductive) method that is operative in natural science. Psychologists predict human behaviour in the same way in which natural scientists predict natural events, by inferring it from certain antecedent conditions and empirical generalisations. While the generalisations of psychologists invoke psychological rather than natural laws, the method is the same. The difference between psychology and natural science lies in the fact that the predictions of psychologists unlike, say, those of astronomers are imprecise. Such a difference, for Mill, is insufficiently robust to support the claim for disunity in the sciences. The most accurate way of drawing the distinction between psychology and astronomy is not to deny that psychology is a (natural) science, but to acknowledge that there are two kinds of natural sciences, those which are precise (like astronomy) and those which are imprecise (like psychology). According to Mill\u2019s way of drawing the distinction psychology is, like tidology and meteorology, an inexact (natural) science. The contrast (for Mill) is therefore not between two kinds of sciences in the Latin sense of scientia, meaning two distinct kinds of knowledge, but between different kinds of natural sciences: exact and inexact. Collingwood rejected Mill\u2019s suggestion that the reconstruction of the thoughts of historical agents is a past-directed empirical psychology. The study of mind is, as we saw earlier, a normative or criteriological endeavour because to understand past agents historically is to understand the conceptual connections they made by reconstructing their thought-context. The subject matter of history, Collingwood claims, is not merely human actions but res gestae. These\n\nare not the actions, in the widest sense of that word, which are done by animals of the species called human; they are actions in another sense of the same word, equally familiar but narrower, actions done by reasonable agents in pursuit of ends determined by their reason. (PH: 46)\n\nPsychology, as understood by Mill, is what in An Essay on Metaphysics Collingwood calls a \u201cpseudo-science of thought\u201d (EM 1998: 142) because it fails to acknowledge that the concept of mind is, in the words of Gallie (1956), an essentially contested concept that (like \u201ccause\u201d, \u201caction\u201d, \u201cscience\u201d, and \u201cthe past\u201d) needs to be disambiguated. This is not to say that empirical psychology is not a legitimate scientific pursuit, but that the subject matter of empirical psychology and that of history are not the same and that the attempt to capture the mind by the methods of empirical science should be denounced as the attempt by one form of knowledge to trespass on the territory of another.\n\nThe distinction between the method of history and that of science is not a distinction between the explanations of psychology understood as an empirical science of the mind and those of physics or astronomy. It is a distinction between two different forms of knowing with distinctive explananda: actions and events. The action/event distinction designates therefore not a distinction between inner/private psychological processes and outward/observable phenomena, but between two different ways of knowing the past: qua actions or qua events. The description of the past qua actions is the correlative of a certain kind of (historical) explanation; the description of the past qua events is the correlative of a certain kind of scientific/nomological explanation. The action/event distinction is, in the vocabulary of An Essay on Philosophical Method a philosophical distinction which does not capture two separate classes of things, but brings the past under different descriptions, qua natural and qua historical past.\n\nThe relevance of Collingwood\u2019s defence of the autonomy of history to debates concerning the unity/disunity of science was brought to the attention of a wider audience by W. H. Dray during the 1950s and 60s. Dray (1958, 1963) located Collingwood\u2019s action/event distinction within the context of contemporary debates in the philosophy of social science and drew on the work of Collingwood to reject the claim for methodological unity advanced by Hempel in his influential 1942 article: \u201cThe Function of General Laws in History\u201d. Hempel claimed that explanations in history are covertly nomological explanations because historians, just as natural scientists, rely upon general laws, even if they do not explicitly mention them. Dray argued that Hempel failed to see that what distinguishes action from event explanations is the nature of the connection between the explanans and the explanandum. In naturalistic explanations the explanans is an antecedent condition, a state of affairs which precedes in time the event whose cause it is said to be; in the historical explanation of action the explanans is the logical ground of an action, the thought that renders the action intelligible. Whilst in the 1950s and 60s Collingwood played an important role in the debate concerning the logical form of action explanation and how it differs from the causal explanation of events, his work became less influential in the second half of the twentieth century. The neglect into which Collingwood\u2019s account of action and its explanation has fallen is linked to a change in metaphilosophical assumptions and the return of the kind of metaphysics which he had sought to replace with the presuppositional analysis described in An Essay on Metaphysics.\n\nAs we saw, according to Collingwood the distinction between the explanation of action and of events was a distinction between different forms of inferences or, as he put it in An Essay on Metaphysics, between the different senses that the term \u201ccause\u201d or \u201cbecause\u201d has in different explanatory contexts. Collingwood\u2019s metaphysics of absolute presuppositions committed him to a form of explanatory pluralism in which different kinds of explanations do not compete because they answer different questions, which arise because of different presuppositions; the choice between one kind of explanation and another depends on whether they are fit for purpose, i.e., whether they satisfy the curiosity of the person who is asking the question. With the return of a more robust form of metaphysics, the suggestion that the choice between one type of explanation and another could be resolved by disambiguating which sense of causation needs to be invoked in order to satisfy the curiosity of the questioner came to be dismissed as an attempt to get away with ontologically light weight solutions to the problem of the relation between the science of mind and nature. The predominant problem in the philosophy of mind and action became that of how the mind can fit in the natural world, a question which presupposes the kind of metaphysics that Collingwood sought to leave behind.\n\nMuch philosophy of history tends to be governed by an epistemological concern with how historical knowledge is possible beginning from the assumption that historical knowledge is knowledge of the past. The primary task of a philosophy of history is consequently taken to be that of explaining how the past can be known given that, unlike the present, it is not available for observation, nor can it be reproduced under experimental conditions. Collingwood\u2019s approach to the philosophy of history is quite different. He denied that a mere concern with the past is sufficient to identify a distinctive subject matter for historical inquiry, one which justifies considering history as a science, in the Latin sense of scientia, i.e., a form of knowing. The past after all is studied by geologists, as well as historians so if history is a distinctive form of knowing it must do more than merely study the past. He therefore took the primary task of a philosophy of history to be that of articulating not an epistemological theory accounting for how the past can be known, but that of disambiguating the subject matter of history from that of natural science by applying the presuppositional analysis that he had expounded in An Essay on Metaphysics to historical knowledge. The application of this presuppositional analysis yields the claim that the presuppositions of history are different from those of natural science because reenacting the thoughts of past agents involves re-thinking conceptual connections. Historians presuppose that past agents are responsive to norms, not that their behaviour conforms to natural laws. The task of philosophical analysis is to uncover these different presuppositions with a view to showing that there is no conflict between the claims of history and those of science, not because historical explanations are incomplete nomological explanations, but because they are complete explanations of a different kind, which answer different kinds of questions. This of course is not to deny that there are important epistemological questions concerning the past but rather that the distinctive epistemology of historical knowing can be articulated only once the kind of past with which history is concerned is clearly identified:\n\n\u2026 a great many things which deeply concern human beings are not, and never have been, traditionally included in the subject-matter of history. People are born, eat and breathe and sleep, and beget children and become ill and recover again, and die; and these things interest them, most of them at any rate, far more than art and science, industry and politics and war. Yet none of these things have been traditionally regarded as possessing historical interest. Most of them have given rise to institutions like dining and marrying and the various rituals that surround birth and death, sickness and recovery; and of these rituals and institutions people write histories; but the history of dining is not the history of eating, and the history of death-rituals is not the history of death. (PH: 46).\n\nIf Collingwood\u2019s philosophy of history is an attempt to identify the distinctive subject matter of history and the logical form of historical judgements, then his metaphilosophy should be understood as defending a form of explanatory pluralism, not a form of historical relativism (D\u2019Oro 2018b). The latter claims that belief systems are beyond criticism because truth and falsity are relative to what certain people, at certain times, believe to be true. The former, by contrast, claims that different kinds of explanations are answers to different kinds of questions and that the task of philosophical analysis is to undo the conceptual knots in which we get tangled when we fail to order our thoughts with due care. This of course is an interpretative claim that advocates of the radical conversion hypothesis (see section 2.3 above) are likely to deny insofar as they tend to read Collingwood\u2019s metaphilosophy as articulating not a defence of the autonomy of philosophy, but as dissolving philosophy into a descriptive study of the belief systems that different people had through time."}, {"url": "https://www.afl.com.au/hall-of-fame/players", "page_content": "Players Inducted\n\nGary Ablett snr (Hawthorn/Geelong)\n\n1/10/1961\n\nInducted: 2005\n\nAblett was the complete package, thrilling fans with his uncanny goalkicking and his freakish ability in the air and at ground level.\n\nPlaying Career: 1982, 1984-96 (Haw 1982, Geel 1984-96)\n\nGames: 248 (Haw 6, Geel 242) Goals: 1030 (Haw 9, Geel 1021)\n\nPlayer Honours: Geel best & fairest 1984; Geel captain 1995-96; Norm Smith Medal 1989; Geel leading goalkicker 1985, 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1993, 1994, 1995; AFL Team of the Century; Geel Team of the Century; All Australian 1984, 1989, 1990, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995 (captain); Victoria (11 games, 43 goals).\n\nJohn Abley (Port Adelaide)\n\nProfile: The John Abley dream took an incredible turn when his family left Victoria and headed to SA\n\n1/10/1930\n\nInducted: 2020\n\nPlaying Career: 1950-1961\n\nGames: 212 Goals: 1\n\nPlayer Honours:\n\nSeven-time SANFL Premiership player: 1951, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959; All Australian: 1956, 1958, 1961; Played 23 State games for SA; Inducted into Port Adelaide's 'Greatest Team' (1870 \u2013 2000) (Full Back); Inducted into the SANFL Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\nJason Akermanis (Brisbane Lions/Western Bulldogs)\n\n24/2/1977\n\nInducted: 2015\n\nPlaying career: 1995-2010 (BL 1995-2006; WB 2007-10)\n\nGames: 325 games (BL 248; WB 77).

Certainly few players in the history of the game have managed to weld supreme natural ability and resolute determination to such telling effect. The determination saw Hart - on the face of it far from the finished article as a footballer - leave Tasmania as a 17-year-old in 1965 to try his luck in the 'big time' with Richmond. At the time it was more usual for non-Victorian players to serve out apprenticeships in their own local competitions before embarking on VFL careers, but throughout his football career Royce Hart seldom did things according to accepted guidelines or standards.\n\nHart enjoyed a dream VFL debut season in 1967 when, playing at the goal front, he was a near unanimous choice as rookie of the year, kicking 55 goals, representing his adopted state, and playing in Richmond's first premiership team for 24 years. There were to be no second season blues either: Royce Hart maintained an amazing consistency throughout most of the remainder of his 187-game league career, even in 1976 and '77 when his knees had virtually 'gone'.\n\nIn 1969, under a special lease arrangement, he played one SANFL game for Glenelg - the Grand Final, against Sturt. However, he was unable to prevent the Double Blues from winning comfortably\u00b2. (Hart had been training with Glenelg for most of the 1969 season while undertaking National Service duties in Adelaide.)\n\nCaptain of the Tigers between 1972 and 1975, Hart played representative football for the VFL 11 times, won the Richmond best and fairest award twice, and was a member of four premiership teams. There have been few more reliable marks or dynamic all round players in the history of the game.\n\nHart's exploits as a coach, however, were infinitely less noteworthy: in two and a bit seasons in charge at Footscray during the early '80s he failed to steer the Bulldogs above 10th place in a 12 team competition.\n\nIn June 2004, Royce Hart was named at centre half forward in the official Tasmanian 'Team of the Century'. Hardly surprisingly, he occupies the same position in Richmond's equivalent team. In 2006, he was inducted as an icon into Tasmanian Football's official Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996 and elevated to 'legend' status in 2013.\n\nAuthor - John Devaney, with updates by Andrew Gigacz"}, {"url": "https://www.theroar.com.au/2015/10/14/afl-team-of-the-21st-century-so-far/", "page_content": "The AFL season proper has finally drawn to a close, and after enjoying a week or two of respite following Hawthorn\u2019s magnificent effort to claim their third flag in as many years, most of us are in somewhat of a frenzy waiting to see who will be at our respective clubs next season.\n\nFor something a little different, and to perhaps for a moment steer the conversation away from the all-consuming discussions surrounding the trade period, yours truly has attempted to come up with an AFL Team of the 21st Century \u2013 so far.\n\nAs it is a team from this century, and not the last, to qualify players must have been selected in two or more All Australian sides since 2001. It has been chosen with the traditional team structure of three talls and three smalls in mind.\n\nFacebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share\n\nGeelong and Brisbane are the most represented clubs with four players each, West Coast have three, while Hawthorn and Fremantle have two players in the team.\n\nSydney, Collingwood, Port Adelaide, North Melbourne, Essendon, St Kilda and Adelaide provide one player each.\n\nThe side includes nine Brownlow Medallists, three Norm Smith Medallists, two Coleman Medallists, and 11 club captains. Between them, the team has claimed a total of 66 club best and fairest awards.\n\nScroll down page to skip player summaries and go directly to team.\n\nDefenders\n\nAt full back is Matthew Scarlett. Taken at pick 45 in the 1997 National Draft as a father son selection, Matthew Scarlett played 284 games for Geelong and is a triple premiership player.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe is a six time All Australian \u2013 the most by any Cats\u2019 player, and won the club\u2019s best and fairest award in 2003.\n\nScarlett\u2019s ability to read the play allowed him to not only compete with often larger opponents, but to also intercept and run the ball out of defence setting up many an attacking foray.\n\nSuch was his effectiveness, opposition teams often tried to curb his influence by playing a negating forward on him, although it seldom limited his involvement in the game.\n\nCorey Enright is also a triple premiership player, and joins his Geelong teammatein a back pocket. Enright has played 309 games since being selected at pick 47 in the 1999 national draft, is a two-time best and fairest winner, and has been named in the All Australian team five times.\n\nAnother rebounding backman, Enright\u2019s durability was again shown this season after easily being the Cats\u2019 most consistent defender, averaging 23 disposals over 21 games at 34 years of age.\n\nThis included a 32-possession game in the Geelong\u2019s final game of the season which may also have been his last, as he has yet to make decision on whether he will play on next year.\n\nIn the other back pocket is former West Coast Captain Darren Glass \u2013 who played 270 games for the Eagles, and is a member of their 2006 premiership side. Drafted in 1999 with pick 11, he is a three times best and fairest winner and a four time All Australian, including one as captain (2012).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGlass gained the captaincy after former skipper Chris Judd left the club to join Carlton in 2008. He led the club through arguably the most tumultuous period in its history before retiring abruptly in 2014 due to injury.\n\nWhile Glass may not be rated as highly outside Western Australia as he is from within, his record despite an injury-interrupted career is testament to how good he was.\n\nAlthough very similar in height and weight to Scarlett, Glass was more of a traditional defender, perhaps best recognised in eastern states for his effort in the 2006 grand final in which he kept Sydney forward Barry Hall goalless.\n\nAt centre half back is Matthew Pavlich. The former South Australian who reluctantly joined Fremantle after being taken at pick four in the 1999 national draft, has now played a club record 335 games, and been captain since 2007.\n\nPavlich has won the Docker\u2019s best and fairest award six times and been the club\u2019s leading goal kicker nine times. His ability to play in multiple positions is highlighted by being selected as both a defender and forward in his six All Australian appearances.\n\nWhile none of those appearances have been at centre half back, he has played in the position a number of times for his club to good effect. His ability to both shut down an opponent and run off him as he showed early in his career would make him a very effective centre half back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn one half back flank is Nigel Lappin. The three-time premiership player ran out for the Lions 279 times after being drafted in 1994.\n\nHe won a best and fairest in 2004, is a four time All Australian, and was also named co-captain of the club after the retirement of Michael Voss. He remained in the position until an Achilles injury forced him to retire at the end of the 2008 season.\n\nLappin was an integral part of Brisbane\u2019s three premiership sides from 2001 to 2003. He was a long accurate kick and could run all day.\n\nLappin averaged just over 18 disposals, three marks and five tackles per game over his career, but is perhaps best remembered for playing through the entire 2003 grand final with a broken rib, yet was still named among the Lions\u2019 best.\n\nThe other half back flanker is Andrew McLeod. McLeod played 340 games for Adelaide and is considered by many to be the Crows\u2019 greatest ever player.\n\nHe won his club\u2019s best and fairest award three times, was named the AFLPA MVP in 2001. In the same year he ran a close second in the Brownlow Medal to Jason Ackermanis, after controversially failing to poll a vote in the last round of the season, despite having a 37-disposal game.\n\nMcLeod was named in the All Australian side five times, including once as Captain in 2007 and is also a member of the Indigenous Team of the Century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only was McLeod a player of sublime skills, he also had plenty of pace, yet very rarely did he seem hurried, such was his composure and grace on the field.\n\nMidfield\n\nIn the centre, and captain of the side is Michael Voss. Debuting as a skinny 17-year-old in 1992, Voss went on to play 289 games for Brisbane, and is arguably their greatest ever player.\n\nAfter being named as a co-captain in 1997 at 21 years of age, Voss lead the Lions to three successive premierships between 2001 and 2003.\n\nAlthough winning a Brownlow Medal prior to this century, Voss did win consecutive AFLPA MVP awards in 2002 and 2003. He won his club\u2019s best and fairest award three times and was named in the All Australian side five times \u2013 including consecutive appearances from 2001 to 2003.\n\nHighly skilled from a young age, Voss worked as hard as he possibly could to get the best out of himself. His courage at the contest was a highlight of his game, as was his single mindedness to win.\n\nWhile Voss was never afraid to speak his mind, to either his teammates or opposition players, he backed up his words on the field and was an inspirational captain for his club for almost a decade. A worthy selection as skipper of this side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlongside Voss on one wing is former Collingwood captain, and now coach of the Magpies \u2013 Nathan Buckley.\n\nAfter playing 20 games and winning the AFL Rising Star award in his first season playing with Voss in Brisbane in 1993, Buckley moved to Collingwood the following year under less than auspicious circumstances.\n\nHowever he soon put the controversy behind him, going on to play 260 games with the Magpies and is considered by many to be the finest player in the club\u2019s 133-year history.\n\nCaptain of the side from 1999 until his retirement in 2007, Buckley won a record six best and fairest awards, and was a seven time All Australian. Including three as vice-captain.\n\nIn 2003 he won the AFLPA MVP award, and become the first Rising Star award winner (along with Adam Goodes in the same year), to win the Brownlow Medal. Later that same week he also became only the third player to be awarded the Norm Smith Medal from a losing grand final side.\n\nAs with Voss, Buckley strove to get the best out of himself, and would work tirelessly to rectify any perceived shortcomings in his game. He possessed a penetrating and precise kick, with pace and a natural outside game from his days as a junior,\n\nBuckley would complement Michael Voss superbly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Voss and Buckley were two of the best midfielders of their generation, Chris Judd was one of the finest of the next, and fills the other wing position.\n\nAfter being taken at pick three by West Coast in the famous draft of 2001, Judd went on to play 134 games for the Eagles, which included captaining the side in their 2006 premiership year.\n\nIn 2008 after a fierce battle for his signature between Carlton and Collingwood, he joined the Blues as captain, and went on to play another 145 games, before injury forced him to retire midway through the 2015 season.\n\nJudd has won five best and fairest awards \u2013 two at West Coast and three at Carlton, two Brownlow Medals \u2013 one at each club, and has been named an All Australian six times.\n\nEarly in his career it was Judd\u2019s phenomenal ability to break way from congestion at a speed few could match that set him apart.\n\nWhen age and injury curtailed his pace to a degree, he reinvented himself as an inside midfielder, in the process claiming his second Brownlow Medal \u2013 a testament to how elite Judd was.\n\nDean Cox was the premier ruckman of his generation. Regarded by some as the best proponent of his craft since Essendon\u2019s Simon Madden, Cox was taken at pick 28 in the 2001 rookie draft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA member of West Coast\u2019s 2006 premiership side, Cox won the Eagles\u2019 best and fairest award in 2008 and is a six-time All Australian ruckman. Over his career Cox averaged 23 hit outs and 16 disposals per game.\n\nCox was also a more than handy forward, either when having a rest from ruck duties or floating forward as an extra tall option. He kicked 169 goals in his 290-game career, at a little over a goal every second game.\n\nAs Adam Goodes is included in the side as the ruck rover, Cox is the only recognised ruckman selected in the side.\n\nGoodes is arguably the greatest Indigenous player to have played the game.\n\nRetiring at the end of the 2015 season in less than ideal circumstances, Goodes played a Sydney record 372 games and kicked 464 goals over his 16 seasons.\n\nHe has won three club best and fairest awards, led the Swans\u2019 goal kicking on the same amount of occasions and is a two-time premiership player.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWinning the Rising Star award in 1999, Goodes, along with Nathan Buckley in 2003, became the first player to win the Brownlow after claiming the Rising Star. He won a second Brownlow in 2006, is a four-time All Australian, and was named in the Indigenous Team of the Century.\n\nAdam Goodes could play in just about any position on a football field, and excel at it. He won his first Brownlow playing in the ruck, and his second while in the midfield. In his four All Australian selections, he was picked in the ruck, on the wing, in a forward pocket and on the bench.\n\nGary Ablett Jnr is arguably the finest player of the last decade and an automatic selection in this side as rover. It is not often that two once-in-a-generation players come from the same family, but such is the case with Gary Ablett Snr and Jnr.\n\nTaken as a father-son selection by Geelong in the 2001 draft, the younger Ablett took some time to stamp himself as an A-grade footballer, but is now considered by many to be as good, if not better than his famous father.\n\nComparisons between the two aside, Ablett has played 274 games and kicked 368 goals for Geelong and Gold Coast in a career littered with team and individual honours.\n\nBefore moving to the Suns at the end of the 2012 season, Ablett was involved in two premierships, won two best and fairest awards, a Brownlow Medal, three AFLPA MVPs, and was the Cats leading goal kicker in 2006.\n\nSince his arrival on the Gold Coast he has won another three club best and fairest awards, two MVPs, and another Brownlow. Had it not been for injury, it is possible he could have had as many as four Brownlow Medals. He has also topped the Suns\u2019 goal kicking on two occasions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForwards\n\nAt centre half forward is former Lions\u2019 captain turned commentator Johnathon Brown. Drafted from the Geelong Falcons with pick 30 in 1999, Brown played 256 games for Brisbane, kicking 594 goals.\n\nA triple premiership player, Brown won three best and fairest awards and was selected in the All Australian side on two occasions. He claimed the Coleman Medal in 2007, and was Brisbane\u2019s leading goal scorer five times.\n\nBrown was most noted for his courage and selfless attack on the ball \u2013 perhaps best exemplified by his Mark of the Year against the Hawks in 2002, and was awarded the AFLPA Most Courageous Award three times during his career.\n\nAn old-fashioned footballer, perhaps not quite as skilful or talented as some of his contemporaries, Brown\u2019s ability to make his teammates walk taller just by his sheer presence out on the ground makes him an almost automatic selection in this side.\n\nFormer captain and coach of Essendon James Hird fills one forward flank. No matter your personal thoughts on him and his involvement in the supplements saga that still lingers on after three years, Hird was among the best players of his generation.\n\nDue to concerns about his capacity to stay on the field as a junior, Hird was taken at pick 79 in the 1990 national draft. After making his debut in 2003 he went on to play 253 games for the Bombers, kicking 343 goals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe claimed a Brownlow Medal in 1996, won Essendon\u2019s best and fairest award five times and was the club\u2019s leading goal kicker twice. Hird was also named in the Bombers\u2019 Team of the Century, and is a five-time All Australian, including selections in 2001 and 2003.\n\nHird was at times mercurial. Although not solidly built, he was tall and agile, and a Norm Smith Medal as Captain and three Anzac Medals are evidence that the bigger the occasion, the better Hird was. A fact many a Magpie supporter can attest to.\n\nSteve Johnson is on the other half forward flank. Taken at pick 24 in the 2001 draft, injury and off field issues hampered Johnson\u2019s early career.\n\nHowever his talent was never questioned, and following a club-imposed suspension at the start of the 2007 season, Johnson helped the Cats secure their first premiership in 44 years. Earning himself a Norm Smith Medal and All Australian selection along the way.\n\nAlthough still unsure of his future, Johnson\u2019s 253rd game for the Cats in Round 23 of this season was his last for Geelong. He has kicked 452 goals to this stage of his career, and been selected in the All Australian team three times.\n\nJohnson\u2019s uncanny ability to pull off things other players only dream of trying has been tempered somewhat by his ill-discipline at times \u2013 either through an untimely suspension or attempting the impossible in games at inopportune times.\n\nHowever as Geelong Coach Chris Scott has said, \u201cWith Stevie J you take the good with the bad. Sometimes it comes off, at other times all you can do is shake your head and laugh.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt full forward is Lance Franklin. After being selected at pick five by Hawthorn in 2004, he controversially made the move to Sydney at the end of 2012, and has so far played 221 games and kicked 706 goals.\n\nGenerally considered to be the best forward in the game, Franklin has led his club\u2019s goal kicking on eight occasions \u2013 six with Hawthorn and two with Sydney. He has won the Coleman Medal three times, and is a two-time premiership player with the Hawks.\n\nIn Hawthorn\u2019s premiership year of 2008, Franklin won the first of his Coleman Medals after becoming the only player since Tony Lockett in 1998 to top 100 goals in a season. He also claimed the Hawks\u2019 best and fairest award that year.\n\nFranklin has been selected as an All Australian five times, and at only 28 years old has the opportunity to feature in many more in future seasons. His height, mixed with his freakish athletic ability makes him very difficult to stop one-on-one.\n\nThe third tall, and lining up in a forward pocket is St Kilda Captain Nick Riewoldt. Since being taken at pick one with a priority selection in 2000, Riewoldt has played 298 games for the Saints and kicked 648 goals.\n\nHe won the Rising Star award in 2002, has claimed six best and fairest awards, and been the club\u2019s leading goal kicker on four occasions. In 2004 Riewoldt was awarded the AFLPA MVP award, and has been named as an All Australian five times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs well as being strong overhead, Riewoldt is very quick off the mark, and his capacity to run and make multiple leads in a single piece of play makes it difficult for defenders to keep up with him for any length of time.\n\nBrent Harvey slots into the other forward pocket ahead of any number of very good small forwards, not only for his ability, but also the sheer weight of his work.\n\nTaken at pick 47 way back in 1995 Harvey has played a club record 409 games and kicked 482 goals. If he stays healthy, Harvey will overtake Michael Tuck as the VFL/AFL games record holder in 2016.\n\nPart of North Melbourne\u2019s 1996 premiership side, Harvey has taken out five best and fairest awards and was named in the club\u2019s Team of the Century. He has been selected as an All Australian five times, the last coming in 2010 at 32 years of age.\n\nBoomer Harvey keeps defying his age. At 37 years old he is still one of the Kangaroos\u2019 best players, and if he has lost any pace over the years (which is debatable), his two decades of experience more than make up for it.\n\nIn 2015 he has averaged 23 disposals per game and kicked 24 goals, which stacks up extremely well against his career average of 21 disposals and 1.2 goals per game.\n\nInterchange\n\nGavin Wanganeen played 300 games for Essendon and Port Adelaide, winning a premiership at each club. A Brownlow Medallist, Wanganeen won a club best and fairest, was named as a back pocket in Essendon\u2019s Team of the Century, and was a five time All Australian, including 2001 and 2003.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimon Black was a triple premiership player with Brisbane, who played 322 games and kicked 171 goals. While he never won his club\u2019s best and fairest, Black did win the Brownlow Medal in 2002, and Norm Smith Medal in 2003. He was named as an All Australian three times.\n\nSam Mitchell is a four-time premiership player who has played 285 games since being drafted in 2001. He won the Rising Star award in 2002, and has taken home Hawthorn\u2019s best and fairest award four times.\n\nAlthough having never won the Brownlow Medal he is a constant contender, and is the fifth highest vote getter in AFL/VFL history with 204. He has made the All Australian side on three occasions.\n\nNat Fyfe sneaks into the side on the back of one of the most dominant seasons by an individual player in recent memory. In only his fourth full season, Fyfe won both the Brownlow Medal, and for the second time the AFLPA MVP.\n\nHe was named in the All Australian team for the second consecutive year, and is the heir apparent to Gary Ablett Jnr as the best player in the AFL. Fyfe is considered to be the archetype of the modern day footballer\n\nCoach\n\nIn the season prior to Alastair Clarkson taking up up the senior coaching position in 2005, Hawthorn had finished 15th. In his first year at the helm they improved slightly to 14th, then 11th the following season and fifth in 2007.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then the Hawks have only missed out on playing finals in 2009, and have appeared in five grand finals \u2013 winning four, including the last three consecutively.\n\nClarkson has been the All Australian Coach four times, and an overall winning rate of 62.9 per cent. Which improves to an impressive 72.7 percent in the post season.\n\nHis four premierships put him behind only Jock McHale (8), and Norm Smith (5), as far as premierships won by coaches, and equal with the likes of Ron Barassi, Tom Hafey, Allan Jeans and Leigh Matthews.\n\nTeam of the 21st Century\n\nB: Darren Glass Matthew Scarlett Corey Enright\n\nHB: Nigel Lappin Matthew Pavlich Andrew McLeod\n\nC: Chris Judd Michael Voss Nathan Buckley\n\nHF: Steve Johnson Johnathon Brown James Hird\n\nF: Brent Harvey Nick Riewoldt Lance Franklin\n\nFoll: Dean Cox Adam Goodes Gary Ablett Jnr\n\nInt: Simon Black Gavin Wanganeen Sam Mitchell Nat Fyfe\n\nCoach: Alastair Clarkson\n\nAs with any representative side there are always a number of players who could be deemed unlucky to miss out on a spot in the final team. Given the amount of quality players to choose from over the last decade and a half \u2013 even with the qualification provisos, there were many who fall into that category.\n\nThe two players closest to making the side, but just missing out were Jason Ackermanis and Luke Hodge. However in the end Harvey and Lappin/Enright made the cut.\n\nOthers that came close included Dane Swan, Mark Ricciuto, Aaron Sandilands, Warren Tredrea, Jimmy Bartel, Scott Pendlebury and Shaun Burgoyne.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome players who did make the side, did so in unfamiliar positions \u2013 the most notable of which is Matthew Pavlich. Pavlich had to be in the team, as did Franklin, Riewoldt and Brown, and as he would have been the only one of the four that would be capable of holding down centre half back, that is where he was selected.\n\nThe same applied for Judd and Buckley. Both were centres or followers, however Voss deserves his spot in the centre and is Captain, so got the nod ahead of the other two. But again, both needed to be included.\n\nThere is certain to be many who disagree with any number of selections in the above team, so feel free to make suggestions below.\n\nBut if you are going to do so, provide legitimate reasons for your choices. If enough people get involved I will put up a Roar reader\u2019s team of the Century (so far), based on comments made below later in the month."}]}
