{"John Cameron was an advocate for the rights of farmers.": [{"url": "https://www.fwi.co.uk/farm-life/farming-stalwarts-john-cameron", "page_content": "John Cameron is probably one of the few farmers who is universally known across Scotland.\n\nThe farming champion is widely respected for a 40-year career in roles which included a five-year presidency of NFU Scotland, chairmanship of the Scottish Beef Cattle Association and an eight-year stint as chairman of the European Sheepmeat Advisory Committee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn association with WareingBuildings\n\nFor much of that time he was referred to as Europe\u2019s biggest sheep farmer, and when he wasn\u2019t busy with politics, running eight different farming units or commuting to Brussels, he chaired British Rail\u2019s Scottish Regional Board and often drove the company trains.\n\nJohn Cameron is a man with sharp political instinct, the charisma to get grassroots producers on board and while at one time he farmed 37,000 acres with beef, sheep and arable interests, his focus has never left the beleaguered hill producer in the less favoured areas where his father\u2019s family farmed for generations.\n\nHis political career was launched when he was appointed NFUS Hill Farming Committee chairman in the 1970s and the rise to the role of national president was fast.\n\nWhat marked him out was his insistence that the civil servants, rule-writers and great and good of Westminster and Brussels should all experience the practical implementation of their policies and edicts. And so he would transport them by tractor and trailer eight miles into the hills of north-west Scotland then deliver his demands, always ending with the question: \u201cDo you understand now what I want? If not you can walk home\u201d.\n\nIt was a performance which consistently achieved results, not least an exceptionally advantageous EU Sheepmeat Regime and Less Favoured Area payments which underpinned production on some of Scotland\u2019s most challenging terrain.\n\nBut not every victim survived unscathed. A former Secretary General of COPA, the international farmers\u2019 pressure group in Brussels, lost a leather buckled shoe in the mud on one of Mr Cameron\u2019s day-long expeditions, and was reportedly seen hobbling back to a trailer sobbing and wet. The subsequent large drams of whisky and generous hospitality tended to soften the physical discomfort and end the experience on a high note.\n\nThere\u2019s an element of the rabble-rouser in John Cameron, too. It was he who came out of semi-retirement to lead 1000 Scottish farmers in a protest at Stranraer docks when imports of Irish beef threatened their livelihoods, and he who successfully negotiated the return of six containers of beef back home across the Irish Sea that same evening.\n\nBut just as his call to arms could inspire some of the smallest livestock producers in the country, so did he negotiate with the most formidable politicians of his generation. He had several spats with Margaret Thatcher when she was Prime Minister, and found they shared some common values.\n\n\u201cYou had to stand up for yourself, and she\u2019d respect you if you contradicted her,\u201d he remembers. \u201cShe certainly wasn\u2019t a push-over, but once we had won our argument her government was a strong supporter of the less favoured areas.\u201d Indeed, letters from the former prime minister are among his most treasured possessions.\n\nThese days John has downsized his farming operation, selling off five of the units which were scattered across Scotland, and setting aside a \u00a31m fund for the Cameron Travel Scholarship Trust for the benefit of young agricultural students and pupils of Dollar Academy.\n\nAfter an entire lifetime managing stock, he says the decision to semi-retire was a surprisingly quick and easy one.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been gathering sheep on a freezing wet day and was soaked to my backside in the truck coming off the hill and suddenly thought: Why am I here?\u201d he recalls.\n\nBut he is still left running the substantial Fife farm of Balbuthie and a neighbouring unit. And he continues to buy lambs every year from Oban Mart where he is still given a hero\u2019s welcome.\n\nThe scrapbooks he occasionally pores over offer an insight into his dominating role on Scottish farming over four decades, but while John may now be 70, he\u2019s adamant the pages are not yet complete. It\u2019s not so long, after all, since NFU Scotland was plunged into crisis with the resignation of a president and chief executive and a poll of farmers for a national farming magazine voted overwhelmingly for John Cameron to take the helm. On that occasion he graciously declined, but that twinkle in his eye and his restless energy and passion for the industry means we haven\u2019t heard the last of the Grand Old Man of Scottish farming.

I worked as closely as I could with agronomists and soil conservation guys,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe country was still being opened up at 50,000 hectares a year in those days. I recall vividly the 1982 drought and 1983 flood. The rain of the 1983 flood started on the same day as the Emerald B&S recovery. We had about 200 inebriated youth in town for the next four weeks as you couldn\u2019t go north, south, east or west.\u201d\n\nMr Cameron said the driving force behind the adoption of no-till farming in CQ was the need to contain the soil erosion problem that was rampant throughout the area at the time.\n\n\u201cCover was and is king. You just have to have sufficient crops to generate soil cover to capture water efficiently and make it available for the next crop, particularly in the high intensity summer storm environments in Central Queensland,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Cameron said in the early 1980s one of the challenges of convincing growers to adopt the new system of farming was that it required a massive change in thinking away from established practices.\n\n\u201cPeople would tell you: \u201cYou have to aerate the soil, mate\u201d. That was a big thing. So, it was an intergenerational change for people to change the farming system and trust it could be done,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt often meant not only management change but machinery change. One of the other impediments was the cost of glyphosate back then. That reduced over time.\n\n\u201cThe other major change was tramlining. We really needed the massive technology shift that was afforded by self-steer tractors and GPS positioning to enable farmers to accurately map in the paddock and not over spray or under spray and leave massive gaps. That has been a huge enabling technology for no-till.\u201d\n\nMr Cameron, said no-till ultimately became a huge success story, not only in CQ but throughout Australia, because conservation methodologies and responsible resource management methodologies married with high production outcomes.\n\n\u201cWe have increased the width and time of sowing windows, we have increased rain capture, water use efficiency and yield. It has ticked all the boxes while protecting the resource base,\u201d he said.\n\nFarming challenges ahead\n\nLooking ahead, Mr Cameron said Australia\u2019s farming sector faced challenges on a number of fronts.\n\n\u201cOne is herbicide resistance and our ability to efficiently sustain the system that now underpins farming across the country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAustralia is a dry climate and we are absolutely reliant on our ability to capture water, moreso than most climates, so climate change and temperature changes are going to make it a lot harder for us than they are for some of our competitors.\u201d\n\nMr Cameron said another looming challenge related to soil carbon levels and plant nutrient supply.\n\n\u201cI see a storm coming with the issues we are seeing with climate change, coupled with a lot of the free lunches from nitrogen available through soil organic carbon that are now used and gone,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOrganic carbon, particularly with the profile of release that it had, really buffered our systems for nitrogen demand across a range of outcomes. We have lost a lot of that nitrogen buffering capacity.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we are starting to see widespread need for phosphate fertilisers, particularly deep applied P in the northern region.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s concerning when you couple those two things with the greater difficulty of sustaining fallow efficiency through good weed control due to herbicide resistance or the increasing dominance of weeds that are hard to kill with the current suite of herbicides.\n\n\u201cThat poses an enormous challenge for the next generation of researchers, agronomists and farmers.\u201d\n\nPrecision ag adoption\n\nMr Cameron said Australian farmers had been at the forefront of applying some of the latest precision and automation technologies, but had been slow to take up others.\n\n\u201cIn the short to medium term we have seen rapid adoption of global positioning for driving tractors and precision placement of seeds. The adoption of GPS-based systems has made the apparent size of paddocks shrink which has meant massive savings on input costs and efficiencies,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we have seen a lack of adoption of some of the more data-driven processes that see more variable rate approaches.\n\n\u201cThere are some early adopters who have been mapping soil and yields for years and putting the two together to fertilise with higher rates where there are deeper soils and higher yield expectations. That makes a lot of sense.\n\n\u201cBut, across the board, the percentage of land area that is taking up those variable rate challenges has been below expectations.\u201d\n\nMr Cameron said from studies on what drove adoption, one of the outcomes was that if there are no barriers to technology adoption and a big bottom line benefit there was massive early adoption.\n\nBut as you start winding back either the bottom line benefit or increased the barriers to adoption, although there might still be significant profitability, adoption levels declined.\n\n\u201cThat seems to have been the case with some of the more advanced aspects of variable rate technology at this point,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAn impediment has been the low speed of data transfer speed in Australia, which I think that may be part of the answer, but also part of the excuse, to explain the lower levels of adoption.\u201d\n\nAg communications specialist\n\nIn establishing ICAN in 1995, Mr Cameron saw the opportunity to pitch a proposal to the GRDC for a more streamlined and structured system of relaying research findings to the wider agricultural communities.\n\nThe GRDC accepted the proposal and the successful formula of the now widely-attended GRDC updates was born.\n\nThe program started with five, one-day updates targeted at agronomists in the northern region and expanded the next year to both agronomist- and grower-targeted updates.\n\nToday, the updates are a high-priority fixture on the calendars of agronomists and farmers throughout the north.\n\nMr Cameron has become the widely-recognised figure at the helm, using his skills as a grains communications specialist to bridge the gap between industry research developments and on-farm adoption.\n\n\u201cThere is all this money spent on generating good information and data and our key conduit to get this to the grower networks is via the agronomists who are working hand in hand with those individuals on a paddock by paddock basis,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEveryone is in information overload, so it is a real filtering job. Their role is to filter which information is appropriate to their growers and to help those growers implement profitable outcomes on their properties.\u201d\n\nCOVID forces switch to webinars\n\nWith COVID-19 restrictions coming into force in 2020, Mr Cameron said the updates program in the latter half of this year was too difficult to run as face-to-face events, so the decision was made to run them all as webinars.\n\n\u201cWe selected a subset of 23 issues to run as webinars to replace the nine updates held at venues throughout NSW and Queensland,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGiven the success of the webinar format, we now have a subset of people who, for a range of reasons, don\u2019t come to the live updates. So, the plan for next year is to keep the live updates first and foremost, but out of the 16 one-day updates next year we are going to drop two of those and use that budget to run a number of webinars.\u201d\n\nMr Cameron said he expected to still be operating in a COVID-19 environment into the first half of next year, so the three, major, two-day updates scheduled for Wagga Wagga, Dubbo and Goondiwindi would be conducted under a revised format.\n\n\u201cWe will be running a two-day agenda at Dubbo and Wagga Wagga, but instead of having multiple concurrent sessions with people moving around we will try to minimise movement by running one general plenary session. There will be two separate cohorts of growers and agronomists at those venues,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBecause Goondiwindi is on the NSW-Queensland border, there is still the risk of border closure, so we have cancelled the Goondiwindi update and, instead, will run two, one-day updates at Narrabri in northern NSW and Dalby in southern Queensland. The rest of the one-day updates scheduled are going ahead as normal.\u201d\n\nMr Cameron is a fellow of the Australian Institute of Agriculture and the 2011 recipient of the GRDC Seed of Light Award.\n\nIn his spare time he enjoys getting away from it all through his passion for hiking and fishing.\n\nGrain Central: Get our free cropping news straight to your inbox \u2013 Click here"}, {"url": "http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/cameron_john_1827_1910_13E.html", "page_content": "CAMERON, JOHN, Roman Catholic priest and bishop; b. 16 Feb. 1827 in St Andrews, N.S., son of Red John Cameron (Iain Ruaidh) and Christena (Christina) MacDonald; d. 6 April 1910 in Antigonish, N.S.\n\nJohn Cameron\u2019s father left Scotland with three brothers early in the 19th century and went to Southside Antigonish Harbour, N.S., where they were befriended by Lauchlin MacDonald, an earlier immigrant. Although Clan Cameron had been Presbyterian since the Reformation, Red John converted to Catholicism upon his marriage to one of MacDonald\u2019s daughters.\n\nThe youngest of eight children, John shared the chores of the family farm and early absorbed the sense of duty that would characterize his religious career. He attended the village school until he was 11 and then enrolled in the first class of St Andrew\u2019s Grammar School, which had been established by the parish priest, the Reverend Colin Francis MacKinnon*. From the beginning he showed an aptitude for academic work, and his teachers gave him every encouragement. On MacKinnon\u2019s advice, at the age of 17 he left Nova Scotia to begin theological studies at the Urban College in Rome.\n\nAdjusting easily to seminary life, Cameron showed in his letters home a maturity hardly to be expected in a youth from rural Nova Scotia. The didactic tone of his correspondence suggests that he already felt a responsibility to teach and explain. After eight months he told his father that he had a \u201cfair knowledge of the Italian, can read, write, speak and understand it.\u201d The violence the young seminarian witnessed when Rome was racked by revolution and war in 1848 and 1849 made him a lifelong enemy to the foes of established authority. He would constantly defend the supremacy of the pope and later sympathize with the views of the ultramontanes.\n\nCameron was ordained to the priesthood on 26 July 1853, and he remained in Rome for a further ten months in order to receive his doctorates in theology and philosophy. During this time he was secretary to Alessandro Cardinal Barnabo, secretary to the Sacred Congregation of Propaganda, an appointment which suggests that he was held in high regard. In this position he made many acquaintances within the hierarchy of the church and familiarized himself with its bureaucracy. In 1853 he assisted the vice-rector of the Urban College. After leaving Rome in May 1854, Cameron spent three more months in Europe at the request of MacKinnon, now bishop of Arichat, in order to recruit priests and nuns for the diocese. He arrived home on 10 September. To the sobriety and prudence characteristic of his Presbyterian ancestors had been joined an obedience to the dictates of Rome and an unbending rigidity in matters of Roman Catholic doctrine.\n\nThe month he returned Cameron was appointed rector and professor at the academy in Arichat, established in 1853 by MacKinnon in order to educate young men for the priesthood and give Scottish Catholics an opportunity for professional careers. MacKinnon had, however, always intended to start a college in Antigonish, the centre for a large congregation of Scottish Catholics, and most of the faculty and staff of the academy moved there when a building was made available in 1855. Cameron served as rector of the new college, which was named St Francis Xavier, until 1858; he also taught theology and was pastor of the sprawling parish of St Ninian\u2019s. Having mastered several languages and gained doctorates he was considered scholarly; because he followed a temperate life-style he won respect for his diligence and dedication.\n\nAlthough Antigonish was MacKinnon\u2019s residence from 1858, the seat of the diocese remained in Arichat. Cameron was transferred to Arichat in July 1863 because of a dispute there involving the resident pastor and some parishioners and probably because of a disagreement over politics with MacKinnon. He was appointed rector of Notre-Dame de l\u2019Assomption Cathedral and also became vicar general of the diocese, a position he would hold for seven years. His reputation as a religious administrator soon became firmly established. Later in the decade, when MacKinnon\u2019s failing health made him less capable of dealing with the business of the diocese, some priests sought Cameron\u2019s advice on administrative affairs. Cameron was much concerned during the 1870s about the slow growth of St Francis Xavier but could do little to effect change from Arichat. His administrative abilities had, however, been recognized in March 1870, when thanks to MacKinnon\u2019s recommendation he was appointed coadjutor with the right of succession. In addition, he served again as vicar general between 1873 and 1877. Rome too had a regard for Cameron\u2019s competence: in 1871 he was asked to settle a jurisdictional dispute at Harbour Grace, Nfld. During the 1880s he would be used as an apostolic delegate by the papal authorities during a nasty imbroglio involving the archbishop of Halifax and the Sisters of Charity [see Mary Ann Maguire, named Sister Mary Francis], and in a diocesan dispute at Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Que. [see Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Lafl\u00e8che*].\n\nCameron reached the major milestone in his career on 17 July 1877, when he succeeded MacKinnon as bishop of Arichat. Both had long intended to make Antigonish the seat of the diocese, and Cameron moved there in 1880. On 23 Aug. 1886 the name of the diocese was changed from Arichat to Antigonish; the large stone church in Antigonish, completed in 1874, became its cathedral. The 1880s was a decade of major accomplishments, notably in administration. The debt incurred in the building of the cathedral was paid and a new wing was added to the college; in addition, an episcopal residence was constructed and the Congregation of Notre-Dame was brought to Antigonish.\n\nAt the same time Cameron gave new vigour to St Francis Xavier, which had become a university in 1866. He imposed levies on each parish in support of the college after its government grant was withdrawn in 1881, and for the remainder of his life he strove constantly to improve the institution by constructing buildings, strengthening the faculty, promoting new programs in the humanities, commerce, and science, and introducing the ma and b.litt. degrees. Much of his attention was directed to it, and he has rightly been called the college\u2019s \u201csecond founder.\u201d Cameron\u2019s educational philosophy may be summarized by the phrase \u201ceducating the whole man,\u201d a popular slogan among Catholic educators of his day. As part of this approach, he sent bright theology students to seminaries in Rome, Quebec, or Montreal for advanced training in theology and other disciplines; those chosen returned home fluent in two or more languages.\n\nCameron was a firm believer in the importance of a better general education for women. Writing in 1895 to Lady Aberdeen [Marjoribanks*], he stated that \u201cthose who limit women\u2019s mission and sphere of action to the nursery misinterpret the word of God.\u201d In 1883 he had had the Congregation of Notre-Dame establish a convent school for girls in Antigonish. The school, renamed Mount St Bernard, later became a women\u2019s college, and it was affiliated with St Francis Xavier in 1894. In 1897 four of its students were awarded bas by St Francis Xavier, the first Catholic university in North America to offer to women courses which led to a degree.\n\nThe bishop was also more progressive than the majority of his Maritime colleagues in providing French-speaking priests for the Acadians of his diocese. Moreover, he sought to assist ethnic groups to preserve their languages and cultures by prescribing catechisms in French and Micmac and by helping to compile a catechism in Gaelic. In this endeavour he was probably the most active Catholic prelate in 19th-century Nova Scotia.\n\nOn matters which affected the faith and morals of his people, Cameron was inflexible. Periodically he directed his attention to the cause of temperance, issuing pastoral letters and urging his priests to speak out against the abuse of alcoholic beverages. The increasing popularity in the 1890s of round dances distressed the bishop because he disapproved of \u201cthe improper intimacies between young people\u201d which resulted. Like many Christian clerics of his day, Cameron believed that people had constantly to guard against committing sins of the flesh. In seeking to warn his flock of the dangers of sexual intimacy outside marriage he issued pastoral letters which left little room for misinterpretation. The bishop also insisted on the observance of church regulations for ritual, rubrics, and dogma, and the diocese was constantly made aware of edicts from Rome which affected the laws of the church.\n\nAlthough Cameron gave the appearance of ruling a theocratic kingdom, he did not normally abuse his episcopal power. He did, however, overstep himself in his involvement in politics. His first venture was in 1877, when John Sparrow David Thompson*, a Halifax lawyer and a convert to Catholicism, was suggested as a possible Conservative candidate for a provincial by-election in Antigonish County. The bishop had at one time supported the Liberals, but he believed that well-educated Catholics should take a greater role in public life, and Thompson had impressed him. He let it be known that he favoured Thompson, who won handily.\n\nThe result did not leave Cameron unscathed: he was attacked by Liberal politicians and newspapers for interfering in the political process. The criticism was repeated when he supported Thompson in provincial and federal elections up to 1891, several of which Thompson would not have won without his help. Although it was not thought unusual at the time for churchmen to be involved in politics, Cameron made himself more vulnerable to criticism than other Maritime prelates because of the direct and authoritarian manner in which he aired his views. Moreover, in backing Thompson he became involved in the grubby side of elections and enmeshed in a web of patronage.\n\nThe attacks on Cameron\u2019s interference in politics were harshest during the federal election campaign of 1896, when the Manitoba school question was a major topic of debate [see Thomas Greenway]. Cameron was the only Maritime bishop to advocate strongly and publicly the restoration of Catholic rights in Manitoba. Arguing that the school question was a religious matter, he ordered that a pastoral letter be read in all parishes just prior to the election. In it he stated that Catholics had to support their coreligionists in Manitoba and vote for the remedial legislation of the Conservatives. A majority of Catholics in the riding of Antigonish did not agree and helped elect a Liberal. The feeling against the letter in Heatherton, ten miles east of Antigonish, was so strong that when it was being read at least 40 parishioners walked out of the church. Incensed, the bishop accused the protesters of having insulted the priest by leaving; they countered that they were being coerced into voting for the Conservatives. Cameron denied the protesters the right to the sacraments until they apologized for causing scandal, and it was not until 1900, after the intervention of the apostolic delegate, that the dispute was resolved. The election also tarnished Cameron\u2019s image in Rome. Until then he had been held in great respect by the church authorities, but his involvement in the campaign led them to reprimand him.\n\nThe bishop\u2019s administrative skills were sorely tested after 1900, when new parishes had to be created almost overnight because of rapid industrialization in Cape Breton. Although he succeeded in meeting the challenge, he did not fully understand the changing social conditions wrought by the sudden influx of different racial and ethnic groups into his diocese. Nor did he completely comprehend the problems caused by industrialization and urbanization, having no experience of either development. Little is known about Cameron\u2019s views of the labour movement and trade unions, but the church as a whole reacted in a conservative manner to the rise of trade unionism in Cape Breton.\n\nBy the year of his death Cameron had achieved great successes. He had paid off a large diocesan debt incurred over the years and had had religious orders establish convents, hospitals, schools, and a home for the aged. He had also been mainly responsible for the creation of the Sisters of St Martha of Antigonish, founded in 1894 to perform domestic duties at St Francis Xavier (the order later moved into educational, hospital, and social work). Twenty-six new parishes had been formed, half in industrial Cape Breton. There were 93 priests, more than half of whom had been ordained by Cameron, and ten monks in a Trappist monastery at Tracadie. Moreover, the great majority of the priests had studied at St Francis Xavier, which had become the leading Catholic university in the Maritimes. By 1910 its staff consisted of nine priests and thirteen laymen, who offered a solid education as a basis for professional studies.\n\nJohn Cameron\u2019s long-lasting influence with Thompson and other politicians such as Sir Charles Tupper* and the respect in which he was held by his ecclesiastical peers give him a claim to a position of national importance. But although he was an outstanding churchman and achieved much as an administrator and educator, his political partisanship diminished his lustre.\n\nR. A.

Best known for his battle against Monsanto over crop patent rights, he was an important advocate for farmers\u2019 rights, seed saving, and environmental justice.\n\nSchmeiser was a native of Bruno, Saskatchewan, where he and his wife Louise were both born into farming families.\n\nIn 1998, Schmeiser was thrust into the spotlight when multinational agrochemicals firm Monsanto sued him for misappropriating patented property. They claimed he was using genetically modified canola seed without a license.\n\nSchmeiser maintained that the seed had drifted onto his property and that he had not benefited from its contamination of his field in any way. The case reached the Supreme Court of Canada, which decided Schmeiser had infringed on Monsanto\u2019s patent but did not have to pay a Technology Use Fee or damages.\n\nSchmeiser took legal action against Monsanto for contaminating his canola fields with their Roundup-Ready version of the crop. The action was settled out of court in 2008, with Monsanto agreeing to pay clean-up costs.\n\nIn 2004, Schmeiser received the Activists of the Year Award from The Council of Canadians. And in 2007 he and his wife Louise received the Right Livelihood Award \u201cfor their courage in defending biodiversity and farmers\u2019 rights, and challenging the environmental and moral perversity of current interpretations of patent laws.\u201d He also received the Advocate of Social Justice in Sustainable Agriculture Award from Eco-Farm in 2010 and the Canadian Health Food Association Hall of Fame Award in 2014.\n\nSchmeiser\u2019s work and battle with Monsanto was highlighted in several films, including the 2009 documentary Percy Schmeiser \u2013 David versus Monsanto and the feature film Percy starring Christopher Walken and Christina Ricci, released shortly before Schmeiser\u2019s passing.\n\nIn addition to farming and his advocacy work, Schmeiser owned two farm equipment dealerships, was a Member of the Saskatchewan Legislative Assembly from 1967 to 1971, served as the Mayor of Bruno from 1963 to 1982, and was a town councilor from 2003 to 2006.\n\nHe has five children and fifteen grandchildren, and is remembered by his family as a dedicated parent and grandparent. \u201cI am privileged to this day to be his son,\u201d John Schmeiser told CBC News \u201cGrowing up, it was very, very evident right from the beginning about how concerned he was about his community and his family.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://foodtank.com/news/2016/04/the-importance-of-farmers-rights/", "page_content": "Our genetic reservoir of food-producing plants is in danger as farmers switch from traditional varieties in favour of new ones. Farmers are faced with a difficult dilemma: preserving traditional varieties of food plants that contain precious genetic material developed over centuries versus the need to switch to newly developed varieties that offer higher yields, better nutrition, and the ability to withstand the negative impacts of climate change, pests and diseases. The paradox lies in the fact that the development of new varieties is largely only possible through accessing the genetic material contained in traditional varieties.\n\nThe enormous number of different crop varieties grown by farmers around the world underpins our ability to produce enough food. Each variety is adapted to its own particular niche, produces nutritious food cherished by local families and is able to resist the ravages of pests and diseases that can destroy other, more susceptible varieties. These varieties have been bred and selected by farmers, and more recently by professional plant breeders, since the birth of agriculture, and today they represent an immense reservoir of genetic diversity. Preserving this is vitally important for our collective future. Collecting missions have been underway for some time to obtain samples of these varieties and their wild relatives, and to store them under carefully controlled conditions in genebanks. The International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines, for example, maintains a collection of more than 125,000 different rice varieties. This vast diversity is arguably the world\u2019s most important natural resource, and our continued ability to tap it is vital for us to be able to feed the world\u2019s burgeoning population, set to reach 9 billion by 2050.\n\nIn 2004 a new agreement, the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, came into force to promote conservation and lay out the terms and conditions by which these resources are to be used and shared around the world. A key element in the Treaty acknowledges the critical role that farmers, particularly those in the centers of origin and crop diversity, have played over hundreds and even thousands of years to breed, select and nurture their varieties. A little over 500 million family farms produce most of the world\u2019s food. However, many are poor and such farmers include many of the world\u2019s hungry and malnourished.\n\nThe Treaty, therefore, endorses the concept of Farmers\u2019 Rights as a moral imperative that seeks to balance the rights of scientists and plant breeders, as enforced through intellectual property rights legislation, with a right that rewards farmers for their past efforts. It aims to provide at least some measure of compensation to farmers for making their genetic resources available to the wider community, while at the same time encouraging them to sustain their conservation efforts and continue to develop new varieties.\n\nWhile the Treaty considers the implementation of Farmers\u2019 Rights to be a national responsibility, it encourages governments to take appropriate measures to protect and promote them. These include, for example, protecting farmers\u2019 traditional knowledge, granting farmers the right to participate in decision-making at the national level on relevant issues, and ensuring the right of farmers to a share of any benefits arising from the use of their varieties.\n\nThe Treaty, thus, aims to level the playing field for these resource poor farmers, many of whom have benefitted less than larger, richer farmers from the agricultural revolution of recent decades that has been largely built upon the backs of their past work. Each Member Country of the International Treaty is obliged take measures to protect and promote Farmers\u2019 Rights, subject to its national legislation.\n\nAt its biennial meeting late last year, the Governing Body of the International Treaty reviewed how Farmers\u2019 Rights are being implemented across member countries. While there has been a demonstrable increase in participation of farmers\u2019 organizations in decision-making at the national level, we have a long way to go to have universal realization of Farmers\u2019 Rights. It is important, both from an ethical as well as a practical standpoint, that these rights are respected. More is needed, particularly in terms of national commitments, and in building national implementation capacity. The recent joint initiative by the Treaty and the Global Forum on Agricultural Research (GFAR) to help build this capacity is a welcome development. With political will and adequate resources, programs such as this should help make Farmers\u2019 Rights a reality in more and more countries.\n\nAs the world\u2019s population continues to burgeon, we will have to produce the extra food needed and will have to do so in the face of mounting threats posed by changing climates, more austere weather conditions, less land, water and fertilizer, and intensified pest and disease attacks. The sharing of the world\u2019s precious plant genetic resources for food and agriculture will become increasingly important as we strive to feed our growing world population. As countries take measures to more effectively implement Farmer\u2019 Rights, so the whole world will benefit \u2013 from the conservation and greater sharing of plant genetic resources."}, {"url": "https://www.agriculture.com/news/4-ways-to-effectively-advocate-for-farmers", "page_content": "Farmers around the globe face issues in advocating to consumers, influencers, and politicians, according to a panel of growers at the World Food Prize on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a growing disconnect between urban and rural areas,\u201d says Mel Poulton, a New Zealand farmer. While she was referring specifically to her country, it was a sentiment that rang true with the other developed nations on the panel.\n\nThe panel was hosted by the Global Farmer Network and included farmers from five continents and was one of three global farmer roundtables held in conjunction with the Borlaug Dialogue International Symposium. For this roundtable, each panelist was asked to share techniques used in their country to effectively advocate for farmers.\n\n1. Communication training\n\nThis point was emphasized by almost all of the farmers on the panel \u2013 give farmers the tools they need to be effective communicators. Like the farmer training programs offered in the U.S. by Farm Bureau or commodity associations, farm programs in other countries find similar success with this tactic.\n\nIn South Africa, this includes training for TV, radio, and newspaper interviews as well as communicating directly with consumers. \u201cWe are working on being proactive instead of reactive,\u201d says South African farmer Motlatsi Musi, who says the anti-GMO activists are much better at proactive approaches.\n\nIn Argentina, the farmer association Aapresid prepares farmers so they can advocate in schools and to the government. \u201cOur training tells how to be more effective in our messaging,\u201d says Aapresid president Pedro Manuel Vigneau. This includes telling your story; talking about the technology you use, such as glyphosate; incorporating aspects that your audience cares about, like how you work to improve the environment; and showing a personal side, including family photos in presentations.\n\n2. Empower the individual\n\nAnother common thread among the group was finding ways to enable and empower individual farmers. For Canadian farmer Jake Leguee, this means finding your own voice.\n\n\u201cI was tired of the beating and battering of ag, so I decided to write a blog,\u201d he says, where he writes about what it\u2019s like to be a farmer. \u201cMy most popular blog was what farmers do during the winter. People are just curious. They are genuinely interested.\u201d\n\nHe also uses social media, adding that Twitter has been a good tool for connecting with other farmers in western Canada while Facebook has been more effective in finding consumers.\n\n3. Find creative ways to reach a larger audience\n\nIn the U.S., the Maryland Grain Producers, along with other state commodity associations, started the TV show \u201cMaryland Farm & Harvest.\u201d The commodity associations provide funding to Maryland Public TV to produce the 30-minute show that features two to three farmers, highlighting hot topics like water quality and GMOs.\n\nThe show is working on its fifth season, according to Jennifer Schmidt, the president of the Maryland Grain Producers. \u201cOf all the money that we administer through the checkoff, this has been the best investment in terms of communication because we reach an audience that is interested in agriculture but doesn\u2019t have a connection to farmers,\u201d says Schmidt. \u201cThis is one of the most popular TV shows on Maryland Public TV.\u201d\n\n4. Know the opposition\n\n\u201cThe opposition gives you all your options,\u201d shared U.K. farmer Andrew Osmon, stealing a quote from the All Blacks rugby coach Steve Hansen. While he admits that framing the public as the opposition is a bit too strong, he thinks the concept works well for advocating. \u201cYou have to understand where they are coming from, what their weaknesses and strengths are, and we have to have our house in order to be the best we can be,\u201d he says. \u201cThen we can influence.\u201d\n\nKnud Bay-Smidt from Denmark also emphasized the importance of understanding the other side. Along with a fellow farmer, he\u2019s gone to several meetings by advocacy groups to listen and understand why people are concerned about different issues related to ag. \u201cIf you don\u2019t understand why they are worried, you won\u2019t be able to convince them of anything,\u201d he says."}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/john-cameron-23/", "page_content": "John B.

Parry v Angelsey Assessment Committee [1949] 1 KB 246\n\n[2] This is an unusual case in that much time and effort has been spent on the litigation although the landlords and tenant had clearly been on terms of close friendship and we were told that this continued. The litigation was said to have been necessary to resolve some issues but precisely what the underlying dispute was about did not become apparent to us. There is a question as to whether one of the fields used by the applicant falls under the lease. The landlords had wished this to be resolved in the present action but the applicant successfully argued that this question should be left over for another day: see Note of 6 September 2012. The dispute before us related to the extent of the applicant\u2019s rights in the steading buildings and the courtyard enclosed by them. The respondents have built a house incorporating the western half of the steading and have enclosed a substantial part of the courtyard area in association with this house. This work was apparently done under express reservation of the applicant\u2019s rights or, in any event, on some terms which meant that nothing turned on the fact of the building work having gone ahead. It appeared that the landlords had relied on advice, from a solicitor in Inverness, that the steading or at least the west end of it was clearly not included in the lease. Although Mr Kermack clung tenaciously to that argument in his submissions before us, it can hardly be said to be clear. There were various pieces of evidence which might have been indicative of some informal agreement to change the lease in relation to the steading but the respondents did not plead such a case. The evidence was directed, in the main, at the issue of use of the steading. The respondents thought that the applicant had made little or no use of it. However, Mr Kermack expressly said that he did not challenge the credibility of Mr Cameron who had given evidence of continuing, if intermittent, use of various parts of the steading buildings and courtyard. It is clear that there have been extensive discussions about possible settlement. On the face of it there would seem no shortage of potential practical solutions. However, we were told that the parties required a decision from the court and our task is to reach a decision based on the evidence and submissions. We can do no more than express a hope that the outcome of this litigation will, indeed, allow the parties to reach an acceptable compromise of the various practical issues which will follow from it.\n\nThe debate\n\n[3] We heard debate on 28 September 2009 on the respondents\u2019 plea to relevancy but the parties\u2019 positions had changed since that time and the terms of our Note of 7 October 2009 are no longer of direct relevance on the merits. The applicant had departed from the view that a decision in relation to the field would be helpful. In relation to the so-called sharing provisions of the lease, Mr Kermack\u2019s position now was that the farm had to be looked at as a whole and his contention was that the sharing could not be disregarded as de minimis, even in relation to the whole farm. His position was that the effect of sharing of the buildings was that there could be no valid lease. It may be noted that, at the hearing on evidence, we understood his position to be that no part of the steading buildings was included in the lease although he may have intended implicitly to accept that the stable and byre were part of the agreement. As noted below the position on the pleadings was a little different.\n\nBackground history\n\n[4] A formal lease was executed in 1957. Although the initial discussion about the lease had been with the present applicant\u2019s grandfather, also John Cameron, the tenant under the lease was his father, \u201cJohn Cameron, senior\u201d who was tenant at all relevant times. He died in 2010. We set out some the relevant detail of the terms of the lease below. Put shortly it bore to be a lease of the farm with express reservations of an identified field and reservations relating to parts of the steading buildings.\n\n[5] Our findings as to the history of use of the subjects thereafter are based essentially on the evidence of the applicant himself, supported by the evidence of Mr Chisholm in relation to use of the courtyard of the steading in the early years. Mr Cameron\u2019s evidence of the earlier history was based on an understanding derived informally over the years from conversation with his father and general family conversations. Mr Cameron was accepted by Mr Kermack as essentially truthful and this was consistent with our own assessment. Many of his apparently spontaneous responses to questions indicated that he was, indeed, giving evidence of what he had always understood to be the case rather than simply relying on any recent account given by his late father \u2013 which might have been influenced by the very fact of litigation. It may be added that although a signed statement by the father had been produced, Mr Sutherland said expressly that he did not found on it in any way. There was no direct contradiction of the applicant\u2019s evidence, although the witnesses led for the respondents gave evidence of their impression over the years that little or no use was made of the steading by the applicant or his father and gave evidence of the positive use of parts of it by their father and his brother. Susan Alexander was born in 1955 and Janet in 1963 and they cannot have had much direct knowledge of the early days of the lease when Mr Cameron, senior, was farming Clunemore as a separate unit. Their awareness of what was happening at Clunemore was mainly based on their experiences on holiday as children. They had no positive need to take account of what was happening at Clunemore and their memories of there being no activity at the steading cast no real doubt on the reliability of Mr Cameron\u2019s evidence of his understanding of family history and his direct evidence of positive activity in connection with the farming business. We also heard evidence from Mr Tom Baker. He had lived in Clunemore House for a year or more in about 1978. He said he was not aware of use of the steading during that time but his evidence did not positively exclude the possibility of intermittent use, particularly of the courtyard. We also heard evidence from Mr Hamilton of events since he took up residence in Clunemore House in March 2008. However, by that time the present dispute was underway and we are satisfied that evidence bearing, one way or another, on use since about 2005 would not be a reliable basis for decision as to the state of rights of either party as they stood when the landlords started their conversion of part of the steading.\n\n[6] The close relationship between members of the Alexander family and the Camerons, as owners of the adjacent Balmacaan Home Farm, is an important aspect of the background. We have no doubt that the tenant would not have wanted to object to the landlord using part of the buildings unless he had a pressing need for them himself. We are satisfied that both landlord and tenant made use of parts of the steading. The friendship had extended to the previous tenant of Clunemore, Mr Alex Morrison. The applicant\u2019s grandfather was also on good terms with the landlord at that time. The first missive offer in 1957 was addressed to him. When the applicant\u2019s father took over the farm from Mr Morrison, the latter was allowed to remain in the farm house and the missives make it clear that the various reservations in the formal lease were for the potential benefit of Mr Morrison rather than for the landlords themselves \u2013 although nothing was said to turn on this. As it happened, Mr Morrison died soon after the lease was executed and it is probable that Mr Cameron simply took over use of the reserved field because it was no longer required for Mr Morrison. Some of Mr Morrison\u2019s furniture continued to be stored in part of the steading after his death.\n\n[7] The applicant was born in 1970. He spoke to various aspects of the history of the holding. His direct involvement with Clunemore did not start until about 1986 when he left school but he had worked on the two farms all his life since then, latterly in partnership with his father. His father had been very much the boss until quite shortly before his death. The family had owned Balmacaan Home Farm since 1946. The two farms were now worked together. Clunemore is some 600 acres of hill and 50 to 60 acres inbye. Balmacaan has 200 acres. Balmacaan steading is over half a mile from Clunemore. Although the farms are apparently contiguous they are in fact separated by a river. They are linked by a public road.\n\n[8] John Cameron, senior, took over the tenancy of Clunemore at a time when he was not expecting to inherit Balmacaan as he was the second son. He expected to farm Clunemore for himself largely as a stand-alone unit although he might, no doubt, have expected to make use of facilities at Balmacaan if necessary. He lived there at that time. He kept cattle in the steading buildings at Clunemore. We heard no detail of how the building was used for cattle. It appears from the plan referred to below that it had a byre and two cattle folds. The applicant understood that there had been no electricity and no water. He said the cattle had to be watered outside. On entry the equipment was in a poor state of repair. The applicant\u2019s father had had to repair fences with binder twine. He had subsequently installed various fences. The buildings had always been in a poor state of repair. The applicant understood that they were \u201con the cusp of not being useable\u201d. However, Mr Cameron, senior, had stored feed and various pieces of equipment at the steading. One use of the buildings related to sheep handling in the courtyard. Evidence on this particular aspect was supported by evidence of Mr Chisholm who was shepherd on a neighbouring farm. He had been in the habit of helping Mr Cameron, senior. He had no doubt about the usage of the steading, particularly for the handling of sheep in the courtyard area. He thought Mr Cameron stored livestock feed in the old stable.\n\n[9] It was apparent that eventually Mr Cameron, senior, had come to run the two farms together. Latterly most of the cattle handling was at Balmacaan. However, the applicant remembered occasions when cattle were held at the steading. Some calving took place there. On one occasion stock had been infected by the disease known as \u201cred water\u201d. He said that his father had explained that this was why calving was taking place at Clunemore.\n\n[10] In about 1986 Lionel Alexander came back to live at Clunemore House. Prior to that the landlords\u2019 family had lived in Kent but used Clunemore for all their holidays. They had no other farming interests in the locality. Clunemore House was about fifty yards south of the steading, the courtyard of which opened to the north. Mr Alexander had wanted the place to be improved. A good deal of work was carried out around the steading at that time. The buildings were all made safe. Much of the work was done by a local slater. The roof was taken off the byre. One wall was removed and the area was simply used thereafter as part of the yard. Other parts were re-roofed. The applicant understood that much of the work had been done by the slater in exchange for slates but it was clearly Mr Alexander who arranged for the work to be done. At some stage the roof had been taken off the areas marked \u201cfold no.1\u201d, \u201ctractor shed\u201d and \u201cgarage\u201d as shown on the plan attached to the record. The west wall of these buildings remained. In 1986 when Mr Alexander did work on the steading he also carried out work improving the fencing. He put a roadside fence up. He effectively made various new enclosures. There was a mutual benefit in all the work he did.\n\n[11] The yard had initially been used as a manure pit. The work carried out by Lionel Alexander included levelling of the yard. The applicant understood that his father had always made use of the courtyard for sheep handling. This continued even after he had use of better facilities at Balmacaan. After Mr Alexander\u2019s work in about 1986, less use was made of the buildings by his father. It may be said that this would be consistent with the fact that the buildings had been greatly reduced in extent. However equipment was still kept there from time to time. For example, he referred to a spreader, a baler, and the clipping race being kept in the area shown on the record plan as \u201cfold two\u201d. The spreader was sometimes kept in the \u201ccart shed\u201d. The applicant\u2019s own use of the steading was mainly to keep feed blocks. This happened most years. They would be there over the winter and for months at a time. They would keep about a tonne there. They would use quad bikes to take them out. He had a clear memory of this going back to 1990. They had kept balers and some farm machinery in the buildings. He could say positively that in more recent years fencing items such as strainers and wire netting had been kept within the steading buildings. He said that was specifically the case just before the start of the dispute. He had handled sheep in the courtyard. He initially said he kept a moveable sheep race and gates in the yard at Clunemore although he later said that the sheep handling equipment, gates, race and hurdles would usually be left where they were last used. They were portable and could be moved on a trailer. It could not be said that they were ever kept at Clunemore in the sense of being stored there. He accepted that such equipment could be used anywhere but thought there needed to be some building to be used with it. At Balmacaan they could use the sheds. When working with sheep they would put gates across the right hand opening of the courtyard. Stock would be funnelled in using a race at the other end. This was done for various handling activities. Sheep work was seasonal. Spring would be busiest with lambing. He thought that the courtyard would have been used for sheep about four times a year from at least 1986. Actual usage might not take more than half a day. The use would vary from year to year. It could be used in connection with tupping and for separating off lambs. The sheep were familiar with the steading. It was a natural place for them to go. The steading courtyard was open to the adjacent field. All stock handling for Clunemore ewes would be carried out at Clunemore except for clipping and dipping. Balmacaan had the dipper.\n\n[12] Although we had initially understood Mr Cameron to say that they \u201ccurrently\u201d used the steading some four times a year he also said that they were no longer able to use the yard at Clunemore because the animals would simply go over the wall into the garden courtyard. The protracted nature of this litigation gives rise to the possibility of confusion. We had made it clear at debate that the focus of attention would be on activities prior to building works because they had been carried out under reservation of the applicant\u2019s position. We have not been able to make any finding \u2013 even on balance of probabilities - as to the extent of the applicant\u2019s activities at Clunemore since the building work was started 2008 as the evidence was not clear and it was not thought necessary to clarify it. For completeness it may be added that in 2011 he had used the loft area above the barn to store hay. It had not been used for a long time before that. He explained that he had used it because of lack of space at Balmacaan. Although it was still there, he had expected to have had the hay removed earlier in 2012. We place no weight on this use.\n\n[13] Mr Cameron did not dispute that use of the buildings was also made by the landlord. A boat had been kept at the steading. He thought that the boat had been kept for some time in the garage at Clunemore House. His recollection was that it had been moved from the garage to the steading when Mr Hamilton bought the house. This was one area of sharp dispute. Both the Alexander sisters made it clear that, in their memory, the boat had never been kept near the house. They thought it was always kept at the steading. Mr Cameron accepted that photographs showed the boat in the cart shed part of the steading, perhaps in 1992. He accepted that there might have been long periods when it was there. It is clear that the boat was used by the Alexander family and was not a permanent fixture in the steading. However, having regard to the close relationship between the parties we do not think that anything turns on this. We had a very clear picture of a situation where the tenant would not have made any attempt to assert his rights against the landlord unless there was some serious interference with his farming operations which could not otherwise be resolved. The tenant did not give serious thought to the extent of his rights under the lease until the building work started.\n\n[14] Mr Cameron gave some evidence about the 1993 rent review. He had no direct involvement. He understood that it had been agreed to use Gavin Butler so that his father and the landlord would avoid risk of any direct acrimonious discussion. He also said that he understood Mr Alexander to have been angry when he heard the rent assessment but he had later phoned to apologise for his reaction.\n\n[15] In relation to the landlord\u2019s conversion of part of the steading to a house, Mr Cameron explained that he was aware that an application for planning permission had been made. He thought this had been some years back when Lionel Alexander was alive although he accepted that he could not say so positively. They did not want to object to the landlords\u2019 plans. They did not expect planning permission to be granted. However they were confident they would be able to sort out something if he did intend to build. They were surprised when it transpired that planning permission had been granted. At the time when builders started work Mr Cameron had been storing machinery in \u201cFold No. 2\u201d. He had a baler and spreader there. The builders had pulled it out and then asked him to move it away.\n\n[16] Mr Cameron said he had no memory of the storage of furniture at the steading. He accepted that it was possible that Mr Morrison had kept furniture there. That was well before his time. He knew Tom Baker had lived there, possibly in about 1978. He did not know whether or not he had stored furniture in the steading. This was before his active involvement in Clunemore. He accepted that there were photographs showing use of parts of the steading by the landlord\u2019s family. He referred to the photograph showing a car which he thought was in Fold No. 2. This was Dickie\u2019s pride and joy. He thought that it was usually kept at Elgin or at a house in Whins but knew that Dickie did use the steading to carry out work on the car. Mr Cameron was, himself, using the barn at that time. He had his baler in the barn. This was in the winter months. It was not there in the summer. He did not think that the car was ever there for any length of time. Mr Alexander was always working on machinery. He would work on bigger items at the steading but mostly worked on smaller items at the back of his house. Fold No. 2 had been watertight since at least 1986 when the landlord carried out the improvement works.\n\n[17] Mr Chisholm gave evidence of the use of the courtyard for handling sheep. He was familiar with work at Clunemore in the years following 1959. He worked on a neighbouring farm. As neighbours farmers helped each other. Their sheep were frequently mixed up on the hill. The sheep would be taken into the courtyard at Clunemore to sort and clip. He knew that this went on from 1959 until at least the 1970s. The sheep would all be gathered in the steading to be sorted out. He remembered machinery and fodder being stored in the steading in the early days. He could not really comment on matters after the 1970s.\n\n[18] Mr Butler gave some general evidence about the working of Clunemore along with Balmacaan but his main importance related to a rent review he had carried out in 1993. He gave no direct evidence about use of the steading but the terms of his rent review were strongly founded on by the respondents. We shall return to the detail of this below.\n\n[19] We heard evidence for the respondents from Susan Eleanor Alexander and Janet Victoria Alexander. The Alexander family acquired Clunemore when Alex Morrison was tenant. At some stage he moved from the house to a cottage. The family regularly used Clunemore House thereafter. However they did not live there. They were based in Kent. They had no other farming interests in the locality. The respondents\u2019 grandmother Mrs Victoria Alexander was owner when the lease was signed in 1957. She had died before the time of the Record of the Holding in 1959. Ownership passed to her sons Lionel and Victor (known as Dickie). There was some suggestion that Lionel effectively took over Dickie\u2019s share \u2013 although Mr Cameron made it clear that separate rent had been paid to each. On Lionel\u2019s death the estate came to be shared among Victoria\u2019s grandchildren.\n\n[20] Susan and Janet were Lionel\u2019s daughters. Their evidence can be summarised shortly. They were regular visitors to Clunemore when children. They were almost invariably there at Christmas and Easter holiday periods and usually also for several weeks in the summer. They were very friendly with the Camerons and spent much of their holidays on the farm at Balmacaan. They regarded themselves as working on the farm. They had no memory of any activity by the Camerons involving the steading at Clunemore \u2013 and apparently little memory of sheep farming on Clunemore. They spoke to use of parts of the steading by their own family and friends. Dickie had a vintage car. It was occasionally kept in the steading in the part shown on the Record plan as \u201cFold No 2\u201d. The family boat was kept in the part labelled \u201ccarts\u201d. They did not think the boat had ever been in the garage at Clunemore House. The had had the boat since at least the early 1960s.\n\n[21] We heard evidence from Mr Ted Baker, a friend of the Alexander family in Kent who had stayed in Clunemore House for over a year in about 1978. He had stored furniture in the loft above the barn for over a year. He did not think that the Camerons made any use of the steading in that time. Mr Andrew Hamilton, a land agent and partner in Savilles, had lived at Clunemore House since March 2008. His office was in Inverness but he frequently worked at home. He had seen no sign of any use being made of the steading by Mr Cameron.\n\nDocumentary evidence\n\n[22] It is convenient, at this point, to set out briefly the relevant details of the documentary evidence bearing on the subject let. We do so in chronological order although clearly the important document is the lease.\n\n[23] An offer letter of 24 January 1957 from the landlord\u2019s solicitors was addressed to John Cameron of Balmacaan Home Farm. This was the applicant\u2019s grandfather. It related to the farm known as Clunemore. The offer proposed an express exclusion which was on the same lines as came to be included in the lease, except that the reference to the reserved field was to the \u201cthird\u201d field on the Divach side. This was expressly to be reserved for Mr Morrison\u2019s use. The reservation in the byre was for use \u201cby Mr Morrison of two or three cows\u201d. The offer proposed to oblige the tenant to \u201cmaintain the buildings and fixed equipment in good tenantable order and repair, fair wear and tear only excepted\u201d and to oblige the tenant to enter a separate agreement after the lease was entered by which he was, inter alia, \u201c12 \u2026 (2) to accept the buildings and fixed equipment presently on the farm as sufficient for the purposes of [his] lease: (3) to put into tenantable condition and repair at [his] expense such buildings and fixed equipment as are not in such condition at [his] entry and thereafter so to maintain them, wear and tear excepted.\u201d\n\n[24] The terms of the offer were revised by letter of 19 February. This included provision for the tenancy to go to the younger John Cameron, the present applicant\u2019s father. It narrated: \u201c(4) With regard to paragraph 12(3) of the Offer it is understood that you will not be under obligation to put into tenantable condition and repair such buildings and fixed equipment as are not now in that condition and neither will you have any right to demand that Mrs Alexander should put them into tenantable condition and repair\u201d. There was nothing in the revised offer to show that there had been any discussion as to which field should be reserved.\n\n[25] The lease was executed on the 4 and 15 September 1957. It was a lease of \u201cthe said farm and lands of Clunemore as recently possessed by the said Alexander Morrison and as belonging to the landlord.\u201d Purpose FOURTH provided: \u201cThere are reserved to the landlord \u2026 (e) power to resume at any time for any purpose other than agricultural or pastoral, including without prejudice to the foresaid generality, feuing, fencing, planting, the erection of houses or other buildings \u2026 (i) the farm dwellinghouse with garden and ground attached presently occupied by Alexander Morrison, (j) the field at the back of the farm house being the second field on the Divach side from the junction of the Divach Road, (k) byre accommodation at the Steading for two or three cows, (l) the shed at the Steading used as a garage, (m) the shed at the Steading housing the engine and electricity generator, (n) one stall in the stable.\u201d Clause SEVENTH provided that: \u201cThe Tenant will maintain the buildings and fixed equipment in the condition in which these are at the commencement of the Lease, fair wear and tear and natural decay only accepted\u201d. In terms of clause TENTH of the lease, the parties agreed that a record of the condition of the fixed equipment would be made.\n\n[26] On the same dates, the parties entered what was referred to as a post lease agreement. This purported to vary the provisions of the lease. In summary it provided that the landlord would not be bound to provide any fixed equipment beyond what already existed and would not be bound to put it into any better state of repair than it was. There were provisions allowing the tenant to put fences into stock proof condition and repair with the cost to be met in equal shares by the landlord and tenant and the cost of maintenance thereafter wholly at the expense of the tenant. The tenant was to have no claim against the landlord in respect of any work or materials supplied by him in connection with improvement, renewal or repair of fixed equipment.\n\n[27] A record was made in 1959. Prior discussion of arrangements for the making of the record included a letter from the landlord\u2019s solicitors in which there was reference to the need to have plans made for the recorder \u201cshowing \u2026 plans of the buildings included in the let to you\u201d.\n\n[28] In the record, the recorder narrated that he had been appointed \u201cto make a record of the condition of the fixed equipment of the holding\u201d. He recorded that he had \u201cheard parties and inspected the subjects\u201d. He recorded that the farmhouse had been let as an independent subject and was not recorded in the record. He then set out his findings as to the \u201cFarm Buildings\u201d. He said: \u201cThe buildings as a whole are in a dilapidated condition and not in a tenantable state of repair. The buildings are wired for electric light which appears to be in working order\u201d. However, he then went on to describe, in some considerable detail, the condition of the individual parts of the steading itemised as follows: Garage; Tractor Shed; Fold No.1; Barn and Mill (With Loft over); Thrashing Mill (With Loft over); Fold No. 2; Turnip Shed; Byre; Calf Shed; Rood facing East; Engine House with Loft Over; Loose Box; Stable; Cart Shed; Store; Open Shed; Sheaf Loft, Bothy and Hay Loft; the Square. We touch again below on some of the detail of the entries made in relation to specific parts. For present purposes it is enough to say that the record gave careful detail of the condition of all the listed items, some being said to be in a fair good state of repair.\n\n[29] After listing these items with detail of their condition, the record went on to say:\n\n\u201cNOTE. It is understood that in terms of the Tenants Lease the following items are reserved to the landlord:- 1. The field at the back of the farm house being the second field on the Divach side from the junction of the Divach Road. 2. Byre accommodation for two or three cows. 3. The shed at the steading used as a Garage. 4. The shed at the steading housing the Engine and Electricity Generator. 5. One stall in the stable.\u201d\n\n[30] The record went on to deal in detail with fencing. Some fifteen different fences were described, several being said to be derelict.\n\n[31] Attached to the record were plans. The two lodged in process were the \u201cground floor plan\u201d and the \u201cloft floor plan of the steading\u201d. These are labelled to show the various itemised parts of the steading other than the open courtyard. It may be added that a byre and the calf shed were both said to have a \u201cLean-To\u201d roof. The record concluded with the following: \u201cAll the buildings, fences and fixed equipment are the landlord\u2019s improvements with the exception that all stock proof fences specified have been repaired and made stock proof by the tenant and at his own expense\u201d\n\nSubmissions\n\nPleadings\n\n[32] Although this Court seeks to avoid over-reliance on technicalities of pleading, it is appropriate to say something of the pleadings in this, somewhat confused, case. We had debate on the original pleadings and a lengthy hearing on the applicant\u2019s first amendment; see Notes of 7 October 2009 and 24 February 2010. The pleadings still contain averments by the applicant about the reserved field although Mr Sutherland stressed that this had nothing to do with the present case. In the pleadings the applicant relies essentially on the terms of the lease and asserts that it covers all the steading buildings except those referred to as reserved to the landlord. The landlords do not accept this. They aver: \u201cOther than those parts of the Steading on the holding which are reserved to the respondents or in respect of which the respondents have a right of occupation, the Steading let in terms of the lease extends only to two stalls in the Stable and a lean-to structure. The Stable is in a dilapidated and un-roofed condition and is not used by any person.\u201d This might appear to concede no more than part of the Stable and some lean-to structure but they go on to say that: \u201cIn terms of the lease the Applicant does not enjoy exclusive possession of the byre forming part of the Steading and may have no rights of possession.\u201d The respondents aver that it is not known whether Mr Morrison possessed the steading. Their position in relation to the applicant\u2019s assertions as to the use made on the steading is that this is not known and not admitted. Their substantive contentions, as pled, are: \u201cThe steading does not comprise fixed equipment\u201d; \u201cthe subjects let [by a probative lease] cannot be extended by acquiescence\u201d; \u201cin terms of the lease the applicant does not enjoy exclusive possession of the byre and may have no rights of possession\u201d. The applicant \u201cdoes not pay rent in respect of any subjects other than those described as let to the applicant in terms of the lease\u201d.\n\n[33] There are extensive averments by way of comment on the rent review in 1993 but these are mainly directed at the field and include an assertion that \u201can erroneous inclusion of description of a field in a rent review does not amount to an agreement whether express or implied between a landowner and a farmer\u201d. There is no attempt to assert that the reference to buildings could, by contrast, point to any such agreement. It is fair to say that the pleas-in-law cast no light on the parties\u2019 legal arguments in relation to any of the matters in issue.\n\nClosing submissions\n\n[34] In closing submissions for the applicant the case was again based on the lease. Mr Sutherland contended that on a plain construction the steading buildings were included except where expressly excluded. If there was any doubt about this, reference could be made to surrounding circumstances, in particular, evidence of the parties\u2019 understanding of the matter as shown by their actings in relation to the making of the record. If further support was needed it could be found in the terms of the missives. He referred to Bank of Scotland v Dunedin Property Investment Co Ltd, at 665 D-E. The lease was clearly intended to include all the parts of the steading except the specified parts. The landlords\u2019 rights to share use of byre and stable did not detract from this. These sharing provisions were not sufficient to change the character of the agreement as a lease. The subjects let had to be viewed as a whole. Mr Sutherland said he had little to add to the submissions at debate but drew to our attention the very short report of the decision in Websterv Lyell. That, he said, showed that a reservation by a landlord would not strike at the lease as a whole. It was a matter of degree. This was a lease of a hill farm. The buildings were part of the lease but were clearly of little value. In any event, the reserved use was de minimis compared with the subjects taken as a whole. Actual use was irrelevant. It was enough that the buildings were covered by the lease and there was no evidence of any agreement to change this. But, in any event, there was evidence that Mr Cameron had had cattle in the early days and there must have been some use of buildings when he was farming as a stand-alone farm. There was adequate evidence of use although it had varied over the years.\n\n[35] Mr Kermack had helpfully prepared a skeleton written submission. His first substantive contention was that the agreement could not be said to be a lease. Exclusive possession was an essential feature of a lease. He referred to various authorities including Chaplin v Assessor for Perth; Kildrummy Farms (Jersey) Limited; Brador v British Telecommunications; Conway v City of Glasgow Council; Commercial Components International v Young and South Lanarkshire Council v Taylor. Cases of shared use were distinguishable from cases where the landlord reserved part of the physical subjects. In the latter case, it could be said that the reserved area simply did not fall within the lease. Sharing involved joint use of the subject and was a different concept. It was impossible, he said, to construe the references to the byre and stable as other than shared use. No specific parts of these units could be identified as being reserved. He accepted that the leased subjects had to be looked at as a whole. However, he contended that the sharing provisions in relation to the byre and stable could not be disregarded on any basis of de minimis. The buildings were plainly a significant part of a hill farm. In relation to the de minimis principle, he cited NCB v Drysedale; Parry v Anglesey Assessment Committee; Assessor for Midlothian v Buccleuch Estates; Assessor for Angus v George Ogilvie (Montrose) Limited.\n\n[36] Mr Kermack did not address, expressly, the relationship between his first and second substantive submissions, simply referring to each as hurdles or difficulties faced by the applicant. The second submission was that the applicant had not established that any part of the steading was included in the lease. The reference in the pleadings to the two stalls in the stable and the lean-to was not repeated in his submissions. His argument was based on the description of the subjects in the lease as the farm and lands of Clunemore \u201cas recently possessed by the said Mr Alexander Morrison\u201d. He said there was no evidence that Mr Morrison had possessed any part of the steading. He accepted that Mr Morrison must have had use of some parts but he might only have had use of the parts which the lease expressly excluded. That would be why the lease had express reservations. The missives produced were incomplete. There was no material to explain the change of field. It could be seen that the concluded lease did not simply reflect the negotiations disclosed in the missives produced. It was not appropriate to rely on part of incomplete missives. He further contended that in the record, the recorder was not expressing any concluded view as to the extent of the subjects leased. He was simply noting the condition of all the equipment he saw. His reference to having \u201cheard parties\u201d could be ignored as being no more than a standard formulaic introduction or, possibly as something based on having seen letters from the parties. It did not necessarily mean that he had heard submissions by the parties either as to the extent of the buildings involved or their condition.\n\n[37] There was no positive attempt by the respondents to suggest that there had been any change in the extent of the subjects leased. As we have seen the pleadings went no further than to suggest that there might have been a change that was not known to them. However, Mr Kermack made much of the applicant\u2019s averments about the field. If the applicant was arguing that the lease had been changed to include the field, he could no longer rely on the lease as the measure of his rights in the subjects, including the buildings. In relation to the field, the applicant would have to seek to rely on the evidence of what he occupied and what he paid rent on. Mr Kermack founded strongly on the evidence of Mr Butler\u2019s rent review in 1993. It was clear that Mr Butler had not included any buildings in his assessment of rent. Mr Alexander might well have been content to accept rent on the basis that the buildings were no longer part of the lease. Mr Kermack then discussed the evidence to the effect that Mr Cameron had made little positive use of the buildings, at least since the time of the rent assessment. The respondents relied on the decision in Ancaster v Doig and particularly the passage from the opinion of the Lord Justice Clerk at page 7.\n\n[38] Mr Kermack further contended that, in any event, the steading could not be regarded as fixed equipment. It was redundant. He referred to the negotiations at the time of the lease. The provisions of the missives and the post lease agreement were equivalent to agreement that the buildings were redundant. This, he contended, was supported by the finding by the recorder in 1959 that the buildings were then in a dilapidated condition and not in a tenantable state of repair. If it was agreed they were not tenantable they were not part of the tenancy.\n\nDiscussion\n\n[39] We are satisfied that the steading, with the exception of the garage and generator shed, was included in the subjects let to the tenant in 1957. The careful exclusion of parts of the steading points clearly to the intention to include the remainder. There was nothing in the circumstances of this case to exclude that obvious inference. In particular, the reservation of rights in the byre and stable can reasonably be explained only if the byre and stable are included in the lease. If support for this plain construction was required it can be found in the other productions. We are satisfied that the fact that the missives may not disclose the full terms of parties\u2019 communings would not, of itself, prevent them having weight as part of the factual matrix. We have some reservation about the use of such material as indicative of the \u201cintentions\u201d of parties. However, the need to make explicit provision about building repair obligations shows a recognition of the fact that there were buildings to be included in the lease. Leaving aside the express reservations, there was no basis for any finding that there was any distinction to be drawn in respect of parts of the building. Nothing was founded on to support the distinction in respect of the \u201ctwo stalls in the stable and a lean-to structure\u201d mentioned in the pleadings. There was no challenge to use of the material relating to the record of 1959 as evidence of the parties\u2019 own understanding of the terms of the lease. As we have seen the landlord\u2019s solicitors referred to the need for a plan \u201cof the buildings which are included in the lease\u201d. The plan signed by the recorder was of the whole steading. The recorder narrated that he had heard parties. He could hardly have failed to be told that the steading was substantially excluded if that was, indeed, the understanding of either of the parties. His record carefully details the condition of the entire steading and then notes specifically the excluded parts as shown in the lease. The evidence of the missives and of the making of the record and plans provide strong support, if such support was required, for the view that the lease included the whole steading except the specified reserved items.\n\n[40] In any event, we see no reason to go behind the obvious inference to be drawn from the basic history. The steading was situated within the external boundaries of the farm. When the farm was tenanted by Mr Morrison as a separate unit, the steading would have been a useful if not essential asset. The landlords had no other agricultural property in the vicinity and accordingly no need to exclude the steading from the farm as let. The Square or courtyard area was described in the missives as being used as a \u201cmanure pit\u201d. and there was no suggestion that this use could have been by anyone other than the farm tenant. There was no reason suggested as to why the steading might have been reserved from Mr Morrison\u2019s lease. There was no evidence that there were any other farm buildings available to Mr Morrison. In absence of any contrary evidence, we are satisfied that this material allows an inference to be drawn that the steading buildings were part of \u201cthe farm of Clunemore as occupied by Mr Morrison\u201d.\n\n[41] Under the heading of \u201cThe difficulty of identifying the subjects let\u201d, Mr Kermack made extensive reference to the evidence of Mr Butler and the terms of his letter of 7 July 1993 setting out his rent assessment. It is plain that the views of Mr Butler in 1993 would be of no weight in helping us construe the lease of 1953. Mr Kermack appeared to be relying on the terms of the letter as showing that there had been a change in the lease at some point. But, essentially his proposition was that if the applicant wished to rely on the evidence of Mr Butler as the basis of a claim that the lease had been changed to include the field then, \u201con the same basis\u201d, the steading could be said to be excluded from the subjects by non-payment of rent and lack of any meaningful possession. The written submission put the matter in this way: \u201cIf the applicant contends that he is paying rent for field 902, he has no choice [but] to accept that he is not paying rent for any buildings on the holding\u201d. (It was not disputed at the hearing that \u201c902\u201d was the reserved field.) It may be sufficient answer to say that, before us, no contentions were advanced on behalf of the applicant in respect of any field.\n\n[42] It is appropriate to look at the detail of Mr Butler\u2019s rental award but it can be said, at the outset, that we consider it irrelevant to the issues which presently fall to be determined. As we have discussed, the landlords did not, in their pleadings, attempt to make any positive case of change nor did they seek to lead evidence to establish that there had been a change. Indeed the pleadings make clear the landlords\u2019 contention that Mr Butler\u2019s inclusion of the field could not amount to an agreement between landlord and tenant and Mr Kermack made it plain that he did not accept that there had been any change to the lease to include the field. Although there were averments about the field in the pleadings, the applicant did not advance any case about it in the present action. We do not know what evidence he may be able to lead in a separate action. It is not possible to use Mr Butler\u2019s letter as the basis of a case for which there is no record and which was said, in essence, to rest simply on a hypothetical quid pro quo. One might turn the argument around and say that if the respondent disputes any change to include the field, \u201con the same basis\u201d, he cannot rely on a change to exclude the buildings. But, we do not think this advances matters.\n\n[43] It may be added that we are not persuaded that the question of whether subjects have fallen out of a lease is a matter to be determined by reference to exactly the same type of evidence as might have shown that subjects had come to be included. A tenant is not obliged to make active use of every part of the tenanted subjects, so the inferences to be drawn from evidence of little, or no, use of leased subjects are quite different from those which might be drawn from active use of subjects outwith the scope of a written lease. It can also be said that the inferences which would fall to be drawn from payment of rent for land would be quite different from those to be drawn from a finding, on rent review, that a particular piece of equipment had no identifiable rental value. In other words, the circumstances which might justify a conclusion that parties had added subjects to a lease are not necessarily a direct obverse of circumstances which might justify an inference that subjects included in a formal lease fell to be treated as having been cut out of that lease.\n\n[44] Mr Butler is now 82. He has a B.Sc. in agriculture and had been an agronomist with SAI. In that role he had got to know a number of farmers including the applicant\u2019s father. He was in the habit of giving advice on agricultural matters. Although there was some confusion as to precisely when he started work as an agricultural consultant it appears that he has been doing so since at least 1993. He still has a few clients, including the applicant. He said he does not work for nothing but mainly he works for his own pleasure. The rent review at Clunemore was the first he had carried out. His appointment was another example of the close friendly relationship between landlord and tenant at that time. He said he had been advising John Cameron, senior, and was familiar with his business. When it was agreed that a rent review was necessary, Mr Cameron proposed him as a suitable person to do this and Mr Alexander agreed. Although Mr Butler\u2019s memory of the whole matter was vague and he talked of Mr Cameron as being his \u201cclient\u201d, it is a fair, indeed obvious, inference from the terms of his letter to Mr Alexander, that Mr Alexander had had some contact with him and had agreed to pay half his fee. It seems, in short, that there was a joint reference to Mr Butler for his expert view of rent.\n\n[45] He told us he now has no memory of how he had gone about his task. He said that he had never seen the lease and although he accepted that it was possible that he had, there was nothing in the evidence led to suggest that, in fact, he had done so. We think it highly unlikely that the letter would have been in the laconic terms it was if he had thought it necessary to consider the terms of the lease at the time. He was clear that he had never seen the record of 1959 nor the steading plan. There was no hint that he had any awareness of any statutory provisions bearing on the matter. He said he had just applied commonsense and his knowledge of the background from Mr Cameron to determine what the farm could stand, by way of rent. It is clear that he saw himself as acting as an expert rather than an arbiter although the matter was not addressed in these terms before us. The amount of rent he fixed is not relevant to the present issues. The importance of the rent review lies in the terms of his decision letter. It narrated that the unit comprised 580 acres, or thereby, and after describing the acreages of different types of land it included the following passage: \u201c(d) There are no farm buildings available for the tenant.\u201d\n\n[46] Mr Kermack made some attempt to lead evidence as to the meaning of that phrase from the present owner of Clunemore House, Mr Andrew Hamilton. He had been led to give evidence as a witness to fact but he is an experienced and well regarded land agent, perfectly able, in a suitable case, to give expert evidence on agricultural matters. However, we did not allow his evidence as to the meaning of Mr Butler\u2019s letter as we are satisfied that such evidence would not have added any relevant weight. We have no doubt that, at the time, Mr Butler was attempting to express his understanding in plain English. It was not suggested that the language used had a special technical meaning which required expert evidence.\n\n[47] Mr Butler told us that what he had meant was to make an \u201cobservation about the quality of the buildings\u201d. He said there were buildings but \u201cmaybe they were not up to much\u201d. It is plain that his present understanding is that the tenant claims a right to use the buildings and although it was not disputed that he was doing his best to give honest evidence, we cannot avoid the conclusion that his memory was affected by that understanding. He elaborated the matter by saying that there were buildings there but they were not suitable. He said he was used to prosperous farms where buildings were good. He thought that if they were not good it was better to write them off when considering rent but he did not literally mean that there were no buildings. The buildings would not add value although the tenant could just use them as best he could. There were only thirteen cows on the holding at the time. He thought there would not be need of many buildings to support thirteen cows. He was well aware of the general nature of the Cameron\u2019s operations and the fact that they owned the farm with full range of steading buildings at Balmacaan. This was no more than half a mile away. He said that he now realised he could have expressed himself more clearly.\n\n[48] It is not easy to accept Mr Butler\u2019s evidence as to what he meant by buildings not being \u201cavailable for the tenant\u201d. Plainly this is something different from there being \u201cno farm buildings on the farm\u201d but it seems equally clear that if he had simply been intending to comment on the quality or usefulness of the buildings he could have done so in more explicit terms. However, in the present context, it is important to keep in mind the fact that Mr Butler was not the alter ego, or agent, of the tenant. At best, Mr Butler\u2019s language might be assumed to tell us what he, himself, understood at the time and it must be said that we cannot accept that the understanding he had was that the tenant had full use of various parts of the buildings and that he was simply expressing a conclusion that as their condition was so poor they should not be reflected in the rent. That would be a very strained construction. It would hardly be consistent with the evidence that Mr Lionel Alexander had made significant changes to the steading in 1986. Such buildings as remained had been put into a reasonable state of repair. It may be noted that he was not asked specifically about these changes but it may possibly be the case that neither of the parties\u2019 advocates had known about them before John Cameron subsequently gave evidence. There was nothing about the 1986 changes in the pleadings. The two respondents who gave evidence did not mention them. Another aspect of the matter is that we are satisfied that the tenant had the use of the courtyard for handling stock. Mr Butler made no express reference to this and it cannot be assumed that he excluded the handling benefits of the courtyard in making his assessment.\n\n[49] Although his letter can be read as intended to convey an understanding by him that no buildings were included in the lease, Mr Butler\u2019s language does not point unambiguously to his having been told that the tenant had no \u201cright\u201d to use any of the buildings. The language used is practical. It seems clearly to reflect an understanding that the tenant was not able to use the buildings but it is not possible to say much more. In any event, nothing about Mr Butler\u2019s letter detracts from our view that the lease gave the tenant full right to use of those parts of the steading which were not a matter of express reservation and we are not able to hold it sufficient to establish that there had been any agreement to change the lease.\n\n[50] It is perhaps appropriate to say a little more about the work done by the landlord in 1986. No attempt was made to rely on the physical changes made at that time as pointing to any agreement to resume or to change the subjects let. In the circumstances it is not for us to speculate about such possibilities. However, the landlords did not attempt to challenge the bona fides of any of the Cameron family. The applicant volunteered the evidence of the landlord\u2019s activities. The evidence was consistent with the landlord simply wanting to put the leased subjects into a better state. We were told that in addition to work on the building he carried out work on fencing which was plainly part of the leased equipment. It may be significant that part of the work appeared to have involved removal of the dilapidated byre and it may be inferred that the tenant accepted that he would be able to get by without it. The immediate effect of its removal was simply to enlarge the courtyard. Our clear impression was that neither Mr Cameron nor his father were the kind of people who might have taken advantage of the death of Mr Lionel Alexander to go back on any informal agreement they had reached with him.\n\nThe reservations\n\n[51] It is well established that physical parts can be reserved. The effect of the reservation of the garage and generator shed is that these parts are simply not part of the leased subjects. However, the landlord\u2019s reservation of unspecified accommodation at the steading for \u201ctwo or three cows\u201d and of \u201cone stall in the stable\u201d has given rise to more difficulty. At the debate in 2009 the argument was that these provisions took the byre and stable out of the lease. At the stage of his final submissions, Mr Kermack contended that these provisions prevented the whole agreement from having effect as a lease. Submissions on both sides were directed at that proposition.\n\nThe implications of shared use\n\n[52] Mr Kermack contended that the reservations relating to byre and stable amount to sharing of use of these parts and that such sharing was potentially so important that it could not be excluded on any principle of de minimis. We understood him to accept that sharing for a different type of use such as for sport would not affect an agricultural lease, the argument was that any reservation in respect of a use of the same type as the tenant\u2019s use prevented the agreement from being a lease. This is an argument of considerable importance not only in this case but more generally, particularly where, as here, the parties have plainly intended to enter an agricultural lease with all that that entails in terms of statutory protections.\n\n[53] In addition to the authorities discussed at debate, the respondents relied on various cases taken from the field of rating law. Mr Kermack also founded strongly on the decision of Sheriff Gordon in Conwayv City of Glasgow Council. We shall go on to discuss this case in more detail but make the preliminary point that it is important in considering dicta bearing on this matter to have regard to the context and nature of the issues in each case. Where the court is trying to determine the proper nature of some innominate arrangement, the right to \u201cexclusive possession\u201d may be an important pointer to a lease. That is not to say that exclusive possession is a necessary feature of a lease. Similarly where a lease is silent as to any sharing of possession, exclusive possession will normally be implied. However the four common law cardinal features of a lease have been authoritatively described as being the parties, the subjects, the rent and the ish. We have found little persuasive authority to justify a further cardinal feature that there must be no sharing of the tenanted use. However, we recognise the important principle that a landlord cannot derogate from his grant and this may have a bearing on the proper approach to this issue.\n\n[54] It is well established that in a lease there is considerable scope for reservation in favour of a landlord: Rankine on Leases, p 211; Hunter, Landlord and Tenant, p 212. The question is whether it is possible to reserve a right to make the same use of the subjects as the tenant. Put shortly, we are satisfied that, at least where that right is clearly defined and does not in any substantive sense derogate from the grant, there is no reason why such reservation should be treated as fatal to the concept of a lease.\n\n[55] Where a reservation is used simply to describe parts excluded from the subjects let, it is not strictly a reservation but merely a convenient way to define the subjects. It is evident that the validity of a purported lease of defined subjects cannot be affected by the fact that some other subjects have not been included. A reservation of right implies some qualification or restriction of the rights that would otherwise go to the tenant. This will often involve sharing of use. A very obvious example is a right to make use of roads within the leased subjects. Sometimes, a reservation of a specific part may not only exclude that part from the subjects leased but also imply a right of shared use of part of the leased subjects. Reservation of a \u201cgarage\u201d not only excludes an identified part from the subjects of lease but may well imply a reservation of a right of access over these subjects to the reserved building. Reservation of a specified stall in a stable would implicitly include sharing of access and also sharing of facilities for watering, waste removal and the like. In a lease of residential subjects it is clear that a particular locked room or cupboard can be excluded from the lease. This is often done to allow storage of landlord\u2019s property. A question may arise in any case as whether the landlord is, expressly or implicitly, reserving a right of access to make active use of the storage facility during the currency of the lease. If there is an express reservation of this right, we do not see that this could cast doubt on the character of the lease itself unless the use claimed proved so intrusive as to derogate from the grant.\n\n[56] Perhaps the most obvious example of the sharing of rights to use the subjects is the reservation of sporting rights in an agricultural lease. Such a reservation may often be more valuable to the landlord than the rent obtained from the agricultural tenant. The exercise of sporting rights may occasionally involve a considerable disruption of agricultural activity. A good deal of active cooperation may be required on both sides. However, there has never been any question of an agricultural lease losing its status because the landlord has reserved such rights. There can be no doubt that the law does not require exclusive possession of the heritable subjects as an essential feature of a lease. The South Lanarkshire Council case is binding authority for that proposition. However, it does not go as far as excluding a possible requirement of an exclusive right to make use of the subjects for a specific purpose. In the South Lanarkshire case, counsel did make reference to the fact that the owner\u2019s reserved purpose was different from the purpose of the tenant\u2019s occupation but the Court simply noted this comment in parenthesis and there is nothing to suggest that the distinction played any part in the court\u2019s reasoning. The case affords no authority for any such proposition.\n\n[57] It was a case which involved an apparent tenancy for grazing of horses at or near Lanark Racecourse. The \u201ctenant\u201d was obliged to vacate certain fields from time to time to allow the owners to use them in connection with the race course. The reserved use, in other words, prevented the tenant from making any use of the reserved areas when the owner was using them. The Inner House held that this would not, of itself, be inconsistent with a tenancy. \u201cA limited reservation in favour of the landowner or limitation of the use to which the occupier can use the land would not necessarily be inconsistent with the existence between them of the relationship of landlord and tenant. Plainly, however, it would be a matter of degree, according to the circumstances of the individual case\u201d. It may be observed that the Court plainly was dealing with interference which could hardly be described as de minimis. Examples can be found of similar circumstances where a farmer, under an agricultural tenancy, appears to be obliged to give up use of fields to allow parking for sporting or other activities. This may often involve a significant degree of disruption and adverse impact on the use he can make of the fields in question. We are satisfied in light of the South Lanarkshire case that as a matter of substantive law rather than any application of a de minimis principle, cases of conflicting rights to use should be assessed as a matter of degree.\n\n[58] Mr Kermack founded strongly on the dictum in Conway that \u201cThe law has come increasingly to talk of exclusive possession as a necessary condition of a lease\u201d: 6-31. This observation may be correct as far as it goes. The issue has been discussed in different contexts. But while there are undoubtedly several examples of authoritative references to exclusive possession as an important pointer to the existence of a lease it is clear that the law does not require exclusive possession of the subjects as a cardinal feature of a lease. It may be noted that the case was decided before the decision in South Lanarkshire Council v Taylor.\n\n[59] We think it sufficient for present purposes to express our conclusion in relation to agricultural leases. It might be the case that any sharing in a residential context would be expected to have such an significant impact on the tenant\u2019s enjoyment of the subjects that an absolute rule, or something close to it, would be appropriate. However, even in a domestic context it is not hard to figure examples of cases of shared use which would not, at first sight, appear to cast doubt on the existence of a tenancy. A landlord might let property while reserving a right to park a car on the premises. Depending on the space available this might cause considerable inconvenience to the tenant. We do not think that it would be possible to explain such examples by reference to any application of a de minimis principle. It may also be observed that although the court in Conway decided that exclusive possession was a necessary condition of a residential lease, it also accepted that the right to use shared facilities was not fatal to the existence of such a lease. This distinction might be explained by reference to the nature of the shared rights and the way rights are described in the agreement. It might possibly be argued that a shared right to park a car was use of a different character from true domestic use. But other examples can be found. In former times, leases of tenement flats in Scotland would often involve shared use of external toilet or wash house facilities. The lease would have to give rights to use such heritable subjects, to be shared with other specified occupiers including, perhaps, the landlord. We need not multiply examples but we tend to think that the problems which might be caused by such examples are more likely to be satisfactorily resolved by looking at the impact of the reserved rights on the arrangement as a whole rather than by an assumption that any reservation of a right to share heritable subjects for the same type of use is necessarily fatal to a lease, unless it can be ignored as de minimis. It makes sense to treat the question as one of degree rather than on a need to identify different types of use. Questions of degree may not be easy to determine in some cases but in practice most will be obvious. We think the present to be a clear example of a reservation which could not realistically be thought to cast any doubt on the status of the occupier as tenant under an agricultural lease.\n\n[60] The fundamental proposition underlying the respondents\u2019 position must be that it is an underlying principle that a landlord simply cannot lease subjects and reserve for himself any right to use the subjects for the same purpose as the tenant. We have found no authoritative analysis limiting in such a way the scope of a landlord\u2019s power to reserve to himself a right. It is not clear that a principle based on a narrow classification of type of use would serve any useful purpose. For example, a principle based on careful analysis of the type of use reserved might mean that if the landlord reserved a right to share use of roads there would be a need for enquiry as to whether his predominant use was to get to his dwelling or to get to his fields. We would be slow to find that a reserved use which was plainly tolerable to a tenant in every practical sense use could nevertheless deprive the agreement of the character of a lease, merely because the use could be described in the same terms as the tenant\u2019s use. To give a concrete example, there would seem little justification for a view that reservation of a right to graze horses in a field of sheep was a permitted reservation being a non-agricultural activity while sharing of the same grazing by a few cows would be fatal to the existence of an agricultural lease. It can readily be seen that there might well be circumstances in which such a distinction could be important. For example if cows were sharing with other cows this might have implications for disease or stock control. Sharing might have implications for the operation of other provisions of the agreement or for regulatory regimes. But these practical issues can be addressed without an absolute rule.\n\n[61] We were referred to Brador Properties. In that case suites of offices were available for occupancy. Users shared toilet and other facilities. If the agreement ran for any length of time, the owners could compel the users to move to different rooms. The question of identification of specific physical subjects was the main issue in the case. But, in submissions, both counsel referred to the degree to which exclusive possession was or was not given. Neither party contended that exclusive possession was an essential. The Lord Justice Clerk (Ross) referred to Rankine\u2019s definition of a lease (p1) and pointed out that this made it clear that for there to be a lease \u201cit may be enough that the alleged tenant receives the right to certain uses only of the land\u201d. This comment is consistent with the type of distinction now under discussion but it falls far short of saying that if a particular type of use can be identified, the tenant must have exclusive right to that use. In its context, the distinction being drawn was between a right to exclusive physical possession of land and a right to use it for certain uses. The conclusion of the court was that \u201cIn all the circumstances, \u2026 there was sufficient (our emphasis) possession ceded \u2026 under the agreement to amount to a sublet\u201d. However, the circumstances of that case were quite special and we do not think it casts much light on the present issue, one way or the other.\n\n[62] We do not doubt that where a lease is silent and no reservation is implied by law the tenant is entitled to exclusive possession. We consider that weight must be given to the principle that a landlord cannot derogate from his grant, although the implications of this were not discussed before us. However we have found no warrant for saying that a landlord is not entitled expressly to reserve rights to a use similar to that of the tenant. We conclude that, at least in the context of an agricultural tenancy it is the degree of conflict which is important in determining whether a matter is a lease or a mere licence rather than the fact that it might be possible to describe the reserved rights as being of the same class or type as the rights given to the tenant.\n\n[63] Applying the approach taken in the South Lanarkshire case we are quite satisfied that the rights reserved in the present case do not strike at the lease as a whole. This was a substantial hill farm. It could be used for sheep without covered steading accommodation. It was also used for cattle. We heard little evidence of the capacity of the byre and stables. However, there was no real dispute about the latter: there were three stalls as shown on the plan attached to the Record. Use of one, unspecified, stall was reserved. By 1953 use of tractors was quite common. In practical terms, the reservation of a stall would be of no great importance. In relation to the byre, the plan and record were referred to at debate as indicating capacity for ten cows because of the explicit reference to ten chains. In any event, we accept ten cows as reasonable enough for a byre of the size in question. We do not know what capacity, if any was provided by the two folds. If the reservation had been of an identified stall or identified part of the byre this would have fallen to be treated as something excluded from the lease. In other words, if the landlord had reserved these specific parts, this would not prevent there being a lease of the remainder. Mr Kermack said that Websterv Lyell was simply an extreme example of this. That case concerned the lease of a large dwelling. There had been no explicit reservation. When the landlord did not give possession of all of the rooms, the tenant sought unsuccessfully to resile. The court plainly considered that reservation of minor parts of the building did not strike at the lease as a whole. If the lease would have been perfectly workable had the stall for a horse and space for three cows simply been excluded, it is hard to see that the more limited right of sharing could be said to strike in any way at the arrangement as being a perfectly workable lease of the farm as a whole. The reservation did not derogate from the substantive grant.\n\n[64] Although the matter was argued on the basis that the reservations necessarily implied a sharing of use, we are satisfied that the tenant could have complied with the terms of his tenancy if he had ensured that one stall in the stable and three places in the byre were reserved for the landlord\u2019s use. In other words the reservation might have been treated as excluding such part as the tenant decided to allocate to meet the reservation.\n\n[65] As are satisfied that the reservations in this case fall far short of impugning the character of the agreement as a lease, it is unnecessary to discuss the factors which might, in a narrow case require to be considered in assessing matters as a matter of degree. As the substantive law appears to us to require the matter to be assessed as one of degree, it is unnecessary to consider the issue in terms of any principle of de minimis. However, it may be said that this principle commonly finds its application in cases where there is some clear rule of law which does not expressly provide for exceptions. Justice may require to prevent a trifling breach from having a disproportionate effect. The power to ignore some matters if they can properly be described as de minimis may be a useful and, indeed, necessary, concept when dealing with statutory provisions. The cases cited to us were decisions in that context. In the present context, as we are satisfied that there is no absolute rule that any sharing of use prevents the existence of a lease, it is unnecessary to consider what type of sharing might be excused by application of de minimis principle. However, we understood that the attitude of the respondents at the original debate to be that, if the lease was to be viewed as a whole, the extent of sharing was insignificant. We shared that view. Although their view of that matter has apparently changed, we see no reason to change our own view.\n\nDilapidation\n\n[66] We do not consider it relevant, for the purposes of the present case, to determine whether the buildings fell to be regarded as part of the fixed equipment. If they were part of the subjects let, the tenant was entitled to make use of them. In particular, we are satisfied that he was entitled to make use of the Square otherwise referred to as the courtyard. The landlord has enclosed a substantial part of the courtyard and removed it from the tenant\u2019s use. We have no doubt that such a yard, wholly enclosed on three sides is potentially a useful asset when handling sheep. Even if the tenant is now able to carry out the bulk of sheep handling activity at the better facilities in Balmacaan we have no doubt that he has been able to derive a benefit from use of the courtyard. We are also satisfied that the buildings can provide covered storage areas. These are useful on any farm even if not essential to the day to day farming operations. It may be noted that, although the record described the \u201cbuildings as a whole\u201d as in a dilapidated condition and not in a tenantable state of repair, various individual parts were different. For example, fold No.1 was described as being \u201cin good state of repair and tenantable\u201d; the barn was \u201cin fair (sic) good state of repair\u201d and the threshing mill \u201cin fair good condition\u201d. The stable was \u201cin good tenantable state of repair\u201d. We do not agree with the contention that because neither party was to have any positive obligation to maintain the subjects, this excluded them from the subjects of let. No authority for such proposition was cited.\n\nDecision\n\n[67] We have no doubt that the steading was part of the farm let to Mr Cameron, senior, under the lease, subject to the specified reservations. We are satisfied that the reserved rights were not of a nature and extent which prevented the agreement being properly regarded as a lease. Although the parties were, apparently, agreed that the buildings were not in a great state of repair, their condition did not prevent them being viewed as part of the subjects of lease. There was no case made of any positive change after execution of the lease.\n\n[68] We are, accordingly, satisfied that declarator should be pronounced substantially in terms of the first two craves. We have noted that the first crave seeks to exclude all the landlords reservations as if they were specific areas and does not address the matter as a problem of sharing. However, the submissions before us were based on the proposition that the effect of the reservations in relation to byre and stable was to create a sharing arrangement. Mr Kermack stressed that no identified part of the byre was used to accommodate the landlords\u2019 cows. No specific stall was reserved. We were not addressed explicitly on the terms of this crave. It does not accurately reflect the current state of affairs. There is now no byre. In the circumstances, we are satisfied that the order should only make an exception of the garage and generator shed. The landlords\u2019 rights in respect of the byre or stable, in so far as otherwise enforceable, will not be prejudiced by an order in such terms.\n\n[69] As the parties are apparently on amicable terms, it should be unnecessary to pronounce any order in terms of the third crave, although we shall provide an opportunity for further submissions in respect of any such order as may be required.\n\nFor applicant: Robert Sutherland, Advocate; Anderson Strathern, Solicitors, Edinburgh\n\nFor respondents: Lewis Kermack, Solicitor; Turcan Connell, Solicitors, Edinburgh"}, {"url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/education/2016/01/09/133305/james-farmer-a-pioneer-in-civil-rights-movement/", "page_content": "James Leonard Farmer Jr. was a civil rights activist and leader in the American Civil Rights Movement.

A decade before the civil rights movement made headlines, CORE followed Gandhian principles of nonviolent direct action, to fight racial discrimination in local businesses.\n\nIn 1961, CORE organized the Freedom Rides to desegregate bus travel. Farmer and twelve other activists, both black and white, faced violence and jail time as they rode from Washington, D.C., to New Orleans.\n\nThe Freedom Rides and the violence that erupted in response captured national attention. Blacks across the nation joined the civil rights struggle, as did whites in America and abroad. Within months, Attorney General Robert Kennedy issued an order banning segregation in interstate travel.\n\nFarmer later described the Freedom Rides as his \"proudest achievement.\" CORE had pioneered the tactics that eventually dismantled segregation in the South.\n\nFarmer retired from CORE in 1966 and turned to government service and teaching. In 1998, the year before his death, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.\n\nFor More about James L.

He sold the five farms in Fife, covering 37000acres, in 2006 to the Edinmore Group, a subsidiary of Caledonian Investments, while still retaining two farms in West Perthshire at Glen Lochay and Ivermearan.[1]\n\nCameron is president of both the Scottish region of the National Beef Association and the National Sheep Association, and chairs the quality standards committee of Quality Meat Scotland. A former President of the National Farmers Union of Scotland, Cameron is a Fellow of the Royal Agricultural Society, and was appointed a CBE for his work in Scottish farming.\n\nFrom 2006 onwards, convicted fraudster John McGregor Cameron defrauded a finance company, who agreed to advance him a loan of up to \u00a3800,000 on Cameron's Balbuthie Farm, which was falsely claimed to be towards funding a hotel and golf course scheme. To enable his fraud, John McGregor Cameron drove around the area dressed in tweed driving a Daimler car, in an attempt to make the finance company think that he was John Bell Cameron.\n\nAfter Cameron discovered the mortgage on his property, a formal investigation was launched. The mortgage was discharged, and court cases pursued against John McGregor Cameron and other parties. John McGregor Cameron was jailed for four years in November 2010 after admitting obtaining money by deception and making a false representation. In 2014 the court made an order against a law firm he had used, to refund \u00a3100,000 to the finance company.[2]\n\nRailways\n\nCameron was the Chairman of ScotRail and a member of the British Railways Board from 1990 to 1996.

A non-executive director of Stagecoach Group, and formerly a director of both South West Trains and the Island Line; as well as a Member of the Safety Review Group.[3] [4] He is also the President of the Gresley Society. In May 2005, South West Trains named its Class 121 driver training railcar John Cameron.[5]\n\nWith driver and fireman experience, Cameron has a personal interest in steam railways, and owns two former London & North Eastern Railway locomotives:\n\nCameron had announced that all his railway engines would be permanently withdrawn in 2019 and placed in a museum he was planning to build on his farm.[6] Later, because of that locomotive's good condition, he decided that A4 Union of South Africa would continue running through until January 2022 on the East Lancashire Railway;[7] [8] in October 2021, cracks were discovered in the boiler and it was decided not to attempt repairs.[9]\n\nPersonal life\n\nMarried to South African-born Margaret, the couple live at the 400acres Balbuthie Farm in St Monans, Fife and maintain a cottage in Africa on the shores of Lake Malawi.[10]\n\nIn 2007, Cameron and his wife set up the Cameron Travel Scholarship Trust, to allow both Scottish agricultural students and those studying at the Dollar Academy in Dollar, Clackmannanshire, to \"travel abroad for the purpose of broadening their education and understanding of theworld.\"[11] He was Chairman of the Board of Governors of the school, where he himself was educated, until relinquishing office in 2014.\n\nNotes and References"}], "John Cameron was a vocal opponent of the Alberta government's policy of taxation.": [{"url": "https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/6514360", "page_content": "Infobox Politician (general)\n\nname= John A.

To all three fields, he brought an instinctive musicianship and an innate gift for communication, based on his appealing voice, pleasing personality and immaculate diction. More recently, he had been a fine teacher.\n\nThough never losing touch with his native Australia, Cameron spent the most important years of his career in Britain. He was probably best known for his appearances in choral works such as Messiah, Elijah and The Dream Of Gerontius, then more often performed than they are today.\n\nHis Elijah was a particularly notable interpretation; his work in opera enabled him to convey both the torment and anger of the part. Sir Malcolm Sargent used him not only for his recording of that work, but also for his second set of Gerontius, when Cameron portrayed the Priest and the Angel of the Agony with eloquent feeling.\n\nIn recital, he was a perceptive interpreter of English song. His engrossing, unaffected account of Butterworth's setting of Housman's A Shropshire Lad, dating from 1954 and recently reissued on CD, is an excellent example of his art in this field, showing his natural feeling for the right style. Communication was always of the essence in his recitals.\n\nNot so widely recognised is Cameron's contribution to opera, especially to contemporary works. He created Mr Punch, in the controversial premiere of Birtwistle's Punch And Judy at the 1968 Aldeburgh festival, having already appeared in the premieres of Arthur Benjamin's A Tale Of Two Cities (1957), as Sydney Carton, and of Richard Rodney Bennett's The Mines Of Sulphur (1965). Later, he took part in the first performance of Alexander Goehr's Arden Must Die (1974). Nor should his memorable portrait of the principal character in the first British performance of Dallapiccola's Il Prigionero (1959) be forgotten.\n\nCameron was just as adept in lighter repertory. He apparently made a touching effect as Jack Point, in a New York performance of The Yeomen Of The Guard in 1962, and among his recording credits are several roles in Sargent's performances of the Savoy operas, and Macheath in the same conductor's set of The Beggar's Opera. Among other important credits on disc are his sympathetic Joseph, in Colin Davis's first (and better) recording of Berlioz's L'enfance du Christ, and various contributions to Adrian Boult's accounts of works by Vaughan Williams.\n\nBorn in Coolamon, New South Wales, Cameron studied at the Sydney Conservatorium, before coming to Britain in 1949. Having been recommended by the conductor Eugene Goossens, who had heard Cameron in Australia, he was almost immediately engaged by the nascent Covent Garden Company, as it was then known. His debut was made in no less a role than Germont, in La Traviata, followed by Mozart's Figaro. In 1951, he created the small part of the Novice's Friend, in Britten's Billy Budd at the Royal Opera House.\n\nAfter his three-year contract lapsed, Cameron went freelance. Among his engagements in the early 1950s were some small roles at Glyndebourne, but, at this stage, he felt that concert work would be more rewarding. He made excursions back to Australia to appear with the Elizabethan Trust, then one of the country's few opera companies, and appeared with the Oldenburg company in Germany (1963-64).\n\nLatterly, Cameron had been a charismatic teacher at the Royal Northern College of Music, Manchester, where, from 1976, he passed on his skills to a new generation. Though very ill, he was in London last month to see his favourite pupil, baritone Simon Keenlyside, singing Don Giovanni at Covent Garden.\n\nHis wife predeceased him; he had one daughter.\n\nJohn Cameron, baritone, born March 20 1918; died March 29 2002"}, {"url": "http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/cameron_john_1820_1888_11F.html", "page_content": "CAMERON, JOHN (known as Cariboo Cameron; also known as John A. Cameron), prospector; b. 1 Sept. 1820 in Charlottenburg Township, Glengarry County, Upper Canada, son of Angus Cameron and Isabella McDougal; m. first 20 Feb. 1860 Margaret Sophia Groves; m. secondly 1 March 1865 Christina Adelaide Wood; d. 7 Nov. 1888 at Barkerville, B.C.\n\nJohn Cameron spent much of his early life in Glengarry County. In the 1850s he was in California, apparently as a prospector, but had returned to Glengarry by 1860. When gold was discovered that year in the Cariboo district of the British Columbia interior, Cameron decided to go there. He arrived at Victoria, Vancouver Island, in February 1862 with his wife and an infant daughter who died soon after. In Victoria, Cameron met Robert Stevenson, another native of Glengarry County, who backed him in his first venture in British Columbia, that of transporting supplies into the Cariboo gold district. Cameron was also a partner in a small company which in August staked a claim on Williams Creek in the Cariboo \u2013 the famous Cameron Claim.\n\nOn 22 Dec. 1862 the miners on the Cameron Claim \u201cstruck it very rich at 22 feet.\u201d The claim soon became one of the largest operations in the Cariboo district and its success made Cameron a wealthy man. But prior to the strike, on 23 October, Margaret Sophia Cameron had died of typhoid fever and Cameron was determined to take his wife\u2019s body back to Canada West for burial. On the last day of January 1863 Cameron and Stevenson, escorted for a time by other miners, set out on a gruelling 400-mile journey to Victoria, hauling Sophia\u2019s body on a toboggan. They reached Victoria on 7 March and the body was buried there in an alcohol-filled coffin, pending its removal to the east. Cameron then returned to Williams Creek where he spent the summer working his claim.\n\nIn October 1863 Cameron left the Cariboo and, taking the coffin with him, travelled by way of the Isthmus of Panama and New York, reaching Cornwall, Canada West, before the end of the year. In December he had the coffin reburied. In March 1865 Cameron married Christina Adelaide Wood of Osnabruck Township and in July he laid the cornerstone of his imposing new residence, Fairfield House, at Summerstown in Glengarry County. In this period of prosperity, Cameron\u2019s often rash behaviour, extravagance, and arrogance tended to foster hostile speculation on how he had obtained his fortune. This speculation included references to the first Mrs Cameron, and there was much gossip about the contents of the mysterious sealed coffin. It was even suggested that an appearance of death was contrived and that Cameron had actually sold his wife to an Indian chief for gold. In 1873, more than ten years after his first wife\u2019s death, Cameron could bear his tormentors no longer and had the coffin raised. The face of Mrs Cameron, almost perfectly preserved in the alcohol, was exposed to the scrutiny of the public.\n\nHis windfall melted away, Cameron returned to British Columbia in 1886 or 1887. He died a poor man at Barkerville, the scene of his gold-mining success, and was buried nearby in the cemetery at Camerontown, a village named after him.\n\nRoyce MacGillivray"}, {"url": "https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/naheed-nenshi", "page_content": "Early Life and Education\n\nNaheed Nenshi is one of two children of Kurbanali Hussein Nenshi, a small businessman, and Noorjah Nenshi. The couple immigrated to Canada from Tanzania in 1971, a year before Naheed was born. He grew up in Calgary\u2019s Marlborough neighbourhood and attended Queen Elizabeth High School, where he participated in debating and acting.\n\n\u201cI grew up in a house where we read the newspaper every day, and we talked about politics over the dinner table,\u201d he said. \u201cI always did student government\u2026 and I was always very, very involved in policy issues, but I never really thought that I would be a politician. I thought maybe a journalist, or maybe a professor.\u201d\n\nA childhood hero while growing up was former Calgary mayor and Alberta lieutenant-governor Grant MacEwan \u2014 whom Nenshi met during his ninth-grade graduation. Nenshi studied commerce at the University of Calgary, where he became president of the students\u2019 union. He graduated in 1993 and went on to earn a Master of Public Policy degree from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in 1998.\n\nConsultant and Professor\n\nAfter university, Nenshi worked for McKinsey & Company, a global consulting firm, as an engagement manager. He advised large telecommunications companies, banks, retail businesses and oil and gas companies with corporate strategies. In 2001, he founded his own consulting firm, the Ascend Group. Its clients came to include the United Nations, the Alberta government and various clothing retailers.\n\nAs a member of Canada25 \u2014 a now-defunct, non-profit organization that helped engage young adults on public policy issues \u2014 Nenshi authored the 2002 policy paper, \u201cBuilding Up: Making Canada\u2019s Cities Magnets for Talent and Engines of Development.\u201d\n\nIn 2004, Nenshi became an associate professor at Mount Royal University\u2019s Bisset School of Business, where he specialized in non-profit management and marketing.\n\nMunicipal Politics\n\nIn 2004, Nenshi made a failed bid for a seat on Calgary City Council. He spent the next six years as an academic. He urged his fellow citizens from all walks of life to enter municipal politics as a way of making change and building a stronger community in Calgary. \u201cOne of the things I have learned,\u201d he said, \u201cis that it is very easy to get people involved in their community \u2014 you just have to ask them. But it is very hard to get people involved in politics.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, at age 38, Nenshi entered the race for mayor. He made the decision to show young people that voters \u201ccan elect good people into government\u2026. I wanted to prove a point,\u201d he said. \u201cCould a relatively unknown academic with good ideas and no money actually do well in an election? That was our [campaign\u2019s] goal, to figure that out.\u201d\n\nNenshi\u2019s rivals were alderman Ric McIver and former CTV Calgary news anchor Barb Higgins. Rather than run a traditional campaign, Nenshi relied heavily on social media and other then-unorthodox means to engage voters. His campaign was dubbed \u201cthe purple revolution,\u201d as it reached out to voters across the political spectrum and not just to liberals (red) or conservatives (blue). The campaign\u2019s hallmarks included the 40 or so coffee parties Nenshi held in the homes of his supporters, where he spoke to his hosts\u2019 friends and families about his campaign platform.\n\nA September 2010 Calgary Herald-CTV poll showed Nenshi with only eight per cent support \u2014 well behind McIver (43 per cent) and Higgins (28 per cent). A month later, however, another Herald-CTV poll showed Nenshi in a virtual tie with McIver and Higgins. On 18 October, he was elected Calgary\u2019s 36th mayor with 40 per cent of the vote, including almost 28,000 more votes than McIver.\n\nNenshi was re-elected in 2013, receiving almost 74 per cent of the vote. He was re-elected for a third term in 2017 with 51.4 per cent of the vote.\n\nMayor\n\nAs with his campaigns, Nenshi relied on social media as mayor to engage citizens. During the floods of June 2013 \u2014 at the time, the costliest natural disaster in Canadian history \u2014 he tirelessly offered comfort to besieged residents and urged people to help their neighbours rather than wait for emergency officials. His Twitter account gained 28,261 followers within 10 days after the floods, according to a report from Marketwired.\n\nNenshi remained a prolific tweeter throughout his mayoralty, using the medium as a way of directly answering Calgarians\u2019 concerns and questions on everything from transit policy to parking tickets. A 2016 New York Times headline called him \u201cA Mayor Fluent in Twitter.\u201d\n\nAfter taking office, Nenshi was a staunch supporter of the Alberta oil industry, which makes its corporate headquarters in Calgary. He was also a vocal proponent of new and expanded pipelines to carry Alberta oil to foreign markets \u2014 a controversial stance among other big-city Canadian mayors outside Alberta.\n\nNenshi was sometimes criticized for being better at talking than getting things done in his city. However, he presided over upgrades and rider incentives in the city's mass transit system, CTrain, and the building of a new airport access tunnel. His council introduced a new city hall auditing structure. He also worked, with mixed success, to contain the city's urban sprawl, while also championing projects to revitalize neglected or tired neighbourhoods. Nenshi\u2019s lifelong passion has been making communities work better. On his 3ThingsforCalgary.ca website, he challenged every resident to do three things for the city \u2014 whether selling pies at a bake sale for a charity or donating toys to a community toy bank.\n\nNenshi was a vocal supporter of ethnic and gender diversity among the city\u2019s senior staff. He was also the first Calgary mayor to serve as a grand marshal for the city\u2019s gay pride parade. He served as a powerful, personal symbol of Calgary's growing ethnic and political diversity in the 21st century. He also presided over a period of growth in the city, which included such projects as the construction of the National Music Centre (Studio Bell), the new $245 million Central Library and the revitalization of the East Village, as well as the construction of a $295 million airport tunnel.\n\nIn April 2021, the 49-year-old Nenshi announced that he would not seek re-election for a fourth term as Calgary\u2019s mayor.\n\nCareer After Politics\n\nAfter choosing not to seek a fourth term, Nenshi publicly expressed some ambivalence over his decision. On the eve of the election that saw Jyoti Gondek elected as his successor, he told CTV News, \u201cI\u2019ll never have a job like this again and I'm a bit melancholy about it, but I'm not bittersweet about it\u2026. Is it awful to abandon the city at this pivotal moment? Those are really the things that are in my head.\u201d After leaving office, Nenshi returned to his consultancy firm, the Ascend Group, and became a highly sought public speaker.\n\nHonours\n\nNaheed Nenshi received a Young Leader Award from the World Economic Forum in 2011, and the President\u2019s Award from the Canadian Institute of Planners in 2012. In 2014, he was awarded the World Mayor Prize by the British-based City Mayors Foundation, a research and public affairs group. It called him \"an urban visionary who doesn\u2019t neglect the nitty-gritty of local government.\" Nenshi was the first Canadian mayor to win the award. He also received the Honorary Peace Patron Award from the Mosaic Institute in 2017."}, {"url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/law-and-history-review/article/reconstitution-of-upper-canadian-legal-thought-in-the-latevictorian-empire/64E02336606A5D83F25FAA16879CC794", "page_content": "Crossref Citations\n\nThis article has been cited by the following publications.

In 1859 he began an apprenticeship as a printer with the London Free Press and during the next four years he learned his trade in London and Sarnia. Returning to London in 1863, he offered his services to Joseph Hiram Robinson*, who wanted someone to produce his weekly Evangelical Witness, organ of the Canadian Wesleyan Methodist New Connexion Church, and to manage his printing establishment in exchange for the use of the newspaper\u2019s office and press. However, illness and an unexpected donation, which enabled him to clear his debts on the Witness, prompted Robinson to offer Cameron the opportunity of purchasing the press in return for a commitment to continue the Witness.\n\nCameron accepted the offer and published the Witness until the New Connexion Methodists united with the Wesleyan Methodists in 1874. He also immediately began planning his own newspaper and on 27 Oct. 1863 started the daily London Evening Advertiser and Family Newspaper. Perhaps because of financial constraints, Cameron\u2019s newspaper was politically independent and was produced in a small format. More important, it was published in the evening so that it could report the avidly sought-after telegraphic dispatches from the Civil War in the United States ahead of its rival morning newspapers. The Advertiser was an instant success and within a year it was enlarged to full broadsheet size. Cameron added staff and improved its design and editorial content. The Weekly Advertiser was added in 1864, and a morning edition was started in 1878. The newspaper\u2019s growth brought him financial independence and status in the community and in the industry. He joined the Canadian Press Association, serving as president in 1872 and 1875. The Advertiser\u2019s strength was due in part to Cameron\u2019s ability to draw upon other members of his family for support. His brother William contributed as local editor and in the business management of the company, and his father, William Sr, as bookkeeper.\n\nJohn Cameron\u2019s family had long supported the Reformers and he also held advanced Liberal views. There were, as well, two Liberal-Conservative newspapers in London, and so it was perhaps inevitable that the Advertiser became a Liberal standard-bearer. By the early 1870s it was the second most important Liberal publication in Ontario after the Toronto Globe, published by George Brown*. Under Cameron\u2019s direction, the newspaper favoured reciprocity with the United States, greater autonomy within the British empire, and women\u2019s suffrage, as well as temperance and Sabbatarianism, interests he carried over to private life as president of a temperance organization and a vice-president of the London chapter of the Lord\u2019s Day Alliance. A favourite target for the newspaper was John Carling*, a Conservative and a brewer.\n\nIn 1874 Cameron\u2019s political views brought him to join a group of rebellious Liberals, including David Mills, a contributor to the Advertiser, who were drawn together in support of Edward Blake* in challenging the authority of Prime Minister Alexander Mackenzie*. In January 1875, with financial assistance from Blake and Goldwin Smith, Cameron moved to Toronto to begin the Liberal, a morning daily and a platform for Blake\u2019s views. For Cameron it was also an audacious effort to supplant the Globe. However, the revolt of the Blake wing, which had begun so auspiciously, soon collapsed. The consequences for Cameron of his move to the Liberal were disastrous. Competition from the Globe was fierce and the cost of publishing in Toronto greatly exceeded his expectations. As a result, the Liberal suffered heavy losses and in June Cameron closed the newspaper and returned to London. There he was obliged to fend off an attack on the Advertiser from the Free Press, which had begun an evening edition. In 1876, moreover, George Brown began chartering daily trains in order to sell the Globe in southwestern Ontario in competition with the Advertiser.\n\nSurprisingly, the strains of failure did not result in a rift between Cameron and his colleagues in the Blake wing. In 1877 Mills became chief editorial writer for the Advertiser, and in December 1882 Blake, now leader of the Liberals, was instrumental in having Cameron named managing editor of the Globe when John Gordon Brown, who had succeeded his brother George, was removed from the position. The appointment represented a tremendous honour for Cameron and surely a touch of revenge for the loss of the Liberal. Mills took over as editorial director of the Advertiser.\n\nThe Globe had suffered from stagnant circulation and advertising revenues for many years, trends Cameron failed to reverse. Its main competitor, the Conservative Toronto Daily Mail [see Christopher William Bunting*], had developed into a profitable newspaper. By 1887, because of its independent political stance, it had also acquired a reputation for impartiality. The Globe\u2019s loss of readership was exacerbated by the political woes of the Liberals under Blake and later Wilfrid Laurier*. Partisan loyalty dictated a moderation on issues such as the North-West rebellion and the Jesuits\u2019 Estates Act that was completely out of step with the sentiments of the majority in Ontario. Cameron\u2019s desperate efforts to find positions acceptable to both the party and his readers made the Globe appear irresolute and resulted in the alienation of both masters. In 1890 he stepped down and was replaced by John Stephen Willison*, who had joined the Advertiser in 1881.\n\nCameron returned to the Advertiser, which was itself on the brink of serious financial difficulties. There were repeated attempts to start new dailies in London, and in 1896 the Advertiser faced increased competition in the evening market from the News. An independent penny daily, the News made inroads into the Advertiser\u2019s circulation and advertising and forced the cash-poor Cameron to cut his price from two cents to just a penny. The effect was devastating: by 1899 Cameron had accumulated huge debts with his newsprint supplier, the Canada Paper Company. It seized the Advertiser and began searching for a buyer. Cameron failed to find backing and the paper was purchased by Thomas Hunter Purdom, a London lawyer and a Liberal. Cameron made a desperate effort to maintain an interest in the business and his complaints about his treatment were a great embarrassment to Purdom. They were also likely the reason for his appointment in 1903 as postmaster of London, a position he held until 1 Dec. 1908 when he died from a heart attack suffered at a speaking engagement in London. He was survived by his wife, who in the 1890s had published the weekly Wives and Daughters.\n\nJohn Cameron was a talented and principled journalist and publisher who rose to the pinnacle of Canada\u2019s newspaper business. He developed the Advertiser into one of the finest dailies in the dominion and gave the Globe able management through the 1880s, an extremely troublesome decade for the Liberal party and its principal newspaper. At his death, he was seen as an example of his industry\u2019s vanishing old guard of editor-publishers who had learned their trade as apprentices and had risen to positions of prominence in the highly partisan journalism of the 19th century.\n\nR.

Mukong was arrested and detained in inhumane conditions, once after criticizing the Government and President of Cameroon and again for meeting to discuss the introduction of multi-party democracy; the State denied Mukong\u2019s allegations of wrongdoing, declaring that its actions were a necessary safeguard to national unity as allowed under Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The HRC rejected this defense and furthermore reasoned that protecting and strengthening national unity cannot be achieved by muzzling advocacy for multi-party democracy and human rights.\n\nFacts\n\nAlbert Mukong was a journalist and outspoken longtime opponent of a one-party system in Cameroon. In 1988, he was arrested after giving a BBC interview in which he criticized Cameroon\u2019s government and President. He was subjected to what he described as cruel and inhuman treatment during his detention. He was held in a small cell, without sanitary facilities and access to food until friends and family located him. He was released in May 1989. In 1990, he held a meeting to discuss different ways to introduce multi-party democracy in Cameroon. Following this he was rearrested, and during this detention he was subjected to intimidation and mental torture. His captors threatened to shoot him should any unrest arise among the population. He was charged and convicted of \u201cintoxication of international and national opinion\u201d.\n\nBefore the HRC, Mukong argued that he had twice applied to the High Court of Cameroon for writs of habeas corpus but that his pleas had been rejected on the grounds that the case was before a military tribunal, where the writ of habeas corpus did not apply. Further, he could not bring a civil claim for cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment because under Cameroonian law, a Military Tribunal cannot entertain a civil action separately from a criminal action it has been declared competent to preside over. Only the Minister of Defense or the examining magistrate can seize the military tribunal with a civil action not civilians. Therefore, Mukong argued that there were no remedies available to him domestically.\n\nMukong complained of violations of Article 7 ICCPR (freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment), Article 9 ICCPR (the right to liberty and security of person), Article 12 ICCPR (freedom from arbitrary deprivation of the right to enter one\u2019s own country), and Article 14 ICCPR (equality before the law). He further complained that because his arrest and detention were linked to his activities as an advocate of multiparty democracy, his right to freedom of expression had been violated.\n\nThe State argued that Mukong was never subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, and that he had not exhausted his remedies. The State denied that it had violated Articles 7, 9, or 12 and argued that his arrest had been necessary to safeguard national security, as allowed under Article 19(3) ICCPR. The State contended that the exercise of the right to freedom of expression must take into account the prevailing political context and that since Cameroon\u2019s independence and reunification, there has been a constant struggle to strengthen national unity.\n\nDecision Overview\n\nWith regard to the alleged inhuman treatment, the HRC held that it was incumbent upon the State party to refute the allegations in detail. Mukong had provided detailed information about the treatment he had been subjected to and failing evidence to the contrary, the Committee found that this constituted cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment in violation of Article 7 ICCPR.\n\nWith regard to the alleged violation of the right to freedom of expression, the HRC explained that any restrictions on this right must be provided for by law, pursue a legitimate aim (such as safeguarding national security or public order) and be strictly necessary to achieve this legitimate purpose. Examining the State\u2019s arguments against these criteria, the HRC found that an unsubstantiated need to safeguard an alleged vulnerable state of national unity could not justify subjecting individuals to arrest, detention and inhuman treatment. Furthermore, the HRC held that \u201cthe legitimate objective of safeguarding and indeed strengthening national unity under difficult political circumstances cannot be achieved by attempting to muzzle advocacy of multi-party democracy, democratic tenets and human rights\u201d. The Committee concluded that there had been a violation of Article 19 ICCPR.\n\nThe HRC also found on careful examination of the evidence and material before it that Mukong\u2019s right to a fair trial had not been violated. In respect of Article 9 the Committee noted that the material and evidence before it was not sufficient to make a finding , and with regard to Article 12 the Committee found Mukong had not been forced into exile by the State party\u2019s authorities."}, {"url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/john-cameron-9220457.html", "page_content": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emails Sign up to our free breaking news emails Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

These included works by Ralph Vaughan Williams, Arthur Benjamin, Luigi Dallapiccola, Humphrey Searle, Richard Rodney Bennett, Harrison Birtwistle, Gottfried von Einem and Alexander Goehr.\n\nHe was also a splendid singer of Gilbert and Sullivan, making many recordings of the baritone roles in the operas. A performance in The Yeoman of the Guard outside the Tower of London elicited the compliment from Howard Taubman in The New York Times that \"he is a Jack Point [who] can act and a clown who can sing\". After his retirement from the opera house, Cameron became a highly respected and much-loved teacher of singing at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester.\n\nJohn Cameron was born at Coolamon, New South Wales, in 1918. During the Second World War he served in the Australian Artillery and then the Army Education Service. After giving a recital for the troops in New Guinea, he entered Sydney Conservatorium on a rehabilitation scholarship. In 1948 he won the Australian Broadcasting Commission's Vocal Contest, and toured Australia and New Zealand with the National Opera Company of NSW. He sang with the National Theatre Company in Melbourne, then travelled to London.\n\nCameron joined the fledgling Covent Garden Opera Company (later the Royal Opera) in the 1949/50 season, making his d\u00e9but as Germont in La Traviata. During his three seasons there he also sang Rangoni in Boris Godunov, the Speaker in The Magic Flute, Morales in Carmen, Angelotti in Tosca, the Novice's Friend in Billy Budd and one performance of Count Tomsky in The Queen of Spades. In 1951 he took part in the world premiere of Vaughan Williams's The Pilgrim's Progress, singing the Shepherd; at the revival the following season he sang Pliable.\n\nCameron returned to Australia in 1955, and during the Mozart bicentenary year of 1956 sang Figaro, Papageno in The Magic Flute and Guglielmo in Cos\u00ec fan tutte for the Elizabethan Trust Company in Sydney. The following year he was back in London, creating the role of Sydney Carton in Benjamin's A Tale of Two Cities for the New Opera Company at Sadler's Wells Theatre. After this fine performance it was obvious where Cameron's talents lay, and in 1959 he gave an even more asssured account of the title role in the first British performance of Dallapiccola's The Prisoner, again presented by the NOC at Sadler's Wells.\n\nThe following year he sang the Chief of Section in the first UK performance of Searle's Diary of a Madman, based on a story by Gogol, for the NOC, and the title role of Milhaud's The Sorrows of Orpheus for Group Eight at the St Pancras Town Hall. He also sang with great success in a Gilbert and Sullivan Promenade Concert at the Albert Hall. In 1961 he took part in another world premiere, as the Other Man in Richard Rodney Bennett's The Ledge, for Rostrum opera company at Sadler's Wells, and in 1962 he sang Jack Point in The Yeoman of the Guard during the City of London Festival on a stage erected in the shadow of the Tower.\n\nCameron was engaged for the 1963/64 season at the Oldenburg State Opera in West Germany, where his roles included Handel's Arminio and the four baritone villains in Les Contes d'Hoffmann. By 1965 he was back in London at Sadler's Wells, where he had made his company d\u00e9but in 1952 as Silvio in Pagliacci. This time he sang Tovey in a revival of Bennett's The Mines of Sulphur. The following year he sang Mozart's Figaro and, a particularly congenial role, Sir Robert Cecil in Gloriana. Cameron was no stranger to the work of Benjamin Britten, having sung in the War Requiem, and in Billy Budd. In 1967 Sadler's Wells took Gloriana to the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Monnaie in Brussels, where it was greatly admired.\n\nCameron gave one of his finest performances with the English Opera Group at Aldeburgh as Punch in the world premiere of Birtwistle's Punch and Judy in 1968. Though the opera was not greatly appreciated at the time, Cameron's Punch was acknowledged as a superb characterisation. The opera was given at Sadler's Wells Theatre the following year. Nineteen seventy saw another successful British stage premiere for the baritone, the title role of Hindemith's Cardillac, given by the New Opera Company at Sadler's Wells. Cardillac, together with Punch, provided the greatest achievement of Cameron's singing career.\n\nTwo more first British performances followed, three roles in Einem's The Trial by London University at the Collegiate Theatre, in 1973, and the title role of Goehr's Arden Must Die for the NOC in 1974. During that year he also gave a magnificent account of Dick Deadeye in HMS Pinafore and played Aristophanes in Telemann's The Patience of Socrates, both for Kent Opera.\n\nCameron began his teaching career at the Royal Northern College of Music in 1976. He was still teaching as a member of staff last November, and was a Fellow of the college when he died. Recently, he concentrated on teaching lieder, stressing, as he had demonstrated himself throughout his career, the importance of words in conjunction with music.\n\nElizabeth Forbes"}, {"url": "https://www.writing.ie/readers/boy-11963-by-john-cameron-with-kathryn-rogers/", "page_content": "\u2018Boy 11963 is a memoir for our times. A unique story of survival against all odds\u2019 \u2013 Ciara Considine, Hachette Ireland\n\nBoy 11963 by John Cameron is published with Hachette Ireland and is described as \u2018a unique account of overcoming almost insurmountable obstacles to find out who you truly are\u2019. I knew reading this book would have an impact on me as I would be transported back to an Ireland I barely recognise from the country I grew up in. I was a 1970s child, born into a loving family. The world of the industrial schools and the Magdalene Laundries never featured in my life until recent years when secrets were finally revealed and the true horror of what went on in many of these institutions was finally brought to light. John Cameron was born an innocent in all of this, a swaddling baby needing the same love and affection all human beings crave. But John Cameron\u2019s story was not like that. At five months old the course of his life changed forever as he was handed over to the State for his care.\n\n\u2018Truth telling and truth recovery have seldom been as heart-breaking or necessary as in this powerful story of human vulnerability and failure \u2013 and the ultimate triumph of the human spirit.\u2019 \u2013 JOE DUFFY\n\nCare is defined as \u2018the provision of what is necessary for the health, welfare, maintenance, and protection of someone or something.\u2019 John Cameron never experienced care. At three years of age he was fostered out to a family incapable of looking after him. Sleeping on straw in an outhouse and set to doing chores that no child should be forced to do, John Cameron\u2019s early years were very bleak. But he did not know any better. John Cameron did have one guardian angel in his life, a local woman, a neighbour, who saw something in this young boy and gave him some much wanted attention when the rare opportunity arose.\n\nOne day a big black car pulled up at the door and took John Cameron to Artane, an industrial school that was initially intended for troubled young boys, but became the home of many others when no-one else wanted them. John was frightened and had been given no advanced warning that his life was about to get even worse. Alone and scared, John, now known as Boy 11963, obeyed the very structured and fierce rules of the Brothers who ran Artane, these men with a cruel fist. John was to witness, and experience, traumatic events that remain with him to this day. It is a difficult chapter of his life to read with descriptions that shock and revile, leaving a very real and lingering sense of sorrow behind.\n\n\u201cHe was almost grateful when he heard anguished cries because whatever was happening was happening to someone else. The bogeyman was real, and Johnny feared him every night of his life in Artane.\u201d\n\nJohn Cameron eventually walked out of Artane on Wednesday, 26th September 1951, aged sixteen and never ever looked back. With a determination that belied his upbringing, he had a strength to move on that would see him marry, have children and become a school teacher. But there was always something nagging John. As much as he wanted and needed to move forward with his life he felt a strong need to uncover his history. He had no known relative and knew very little of his beginnings in life so, with his wonderful wife Treasa by his side, they began the search. What they discovered over the years was a tangled web of lies, drama and courtroom shenanigans that shocked a nation.\n\nBoy 11963 is an inconceivable story for many of us who live in such a very different society today. It will shock, sadden and upset many readers as one cannot but visualise the hardship and pain experienced by this man. Now in his eighties, John Cameron, with the encouragement of his incredibly supportive family, has written this inspirational tale of a life forever scarred but certainly not beaten.\n\nBoy 11963 is a tragic story but yet John Cameron, with such fortitude, overcame his very harrowing beginnings and triumphed. He won his life back and went on to achieve success in many areas of his life. John Cameron is an inspiration, a man who shines a light in the darkness, a man whose story will touch the lives of many and bring hope to others.\n\n(c) Swirl and Thread\n\nOrder your copy online here."}]}
