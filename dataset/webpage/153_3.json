Two-time Olympic bronze medalist for Russia, Arkady Vyatchanin (now most likely representing Serbia), Olympic gold medalist for South Africa Roland Schoeman, and World Champion New Zealander Moss Burmester joined the 2004-Olympic bronze medalist in the Caribbean for a series of free clinics using swimming as a platform to both benefit and excite young athletes.\n\nThe \u201cGeorge Bovell Dive In Free Swim Clinics 2015\u201d were held at facilities in St. James, Macoya and San Fernando over January 15-17th, with the prestigious athletes teaching training methods, skills and drills with the purpose of not only encouraging the young attendees within the sport of swimming, but by also offering up hope and inspiration as they interacted and collaborated with the participants.\n\nBovell tells SwimSwam that, \u201cthe clinics were a huge success; you all can\u2019t imagine what it meant to those kids. It\u2019s an initiative that I try to put on every year to give back to and hopefully grow the sport here. It also serves to get the youth \u2018thinking big\u2019 and to help them understand that, through hard work, anything is possible.\u201d\n\nTo that end, while in the midst of ramping up his own training en route to this year\u2019s Pan American Games and World Championships, Bovell is monitoring the construction of the George Bovell Aquatic Center* taking shape in Couva, Trinidad (*name is not yet official). With the building\u2019s completion targeted for June 2015, Bovell hopes the country can offer the facility to Olympic teams to use for their Rio 2016 staging camps, especially with Trinidad\u2019s temperatures and time zone not far off Rio\u2019s mark.\n\nThis vision falls directly in line with what Bovell describes as his short- and long-term mission for the sport of swimming in Trinidad and Tobago. \u201cIn the next five years, I would love to see Trinidad and Tobago hosting regional and international swimming events and have all schools offer learn-to-swim classes as part of their curriculum so that the number of unnecessary drowning deaths annually will be significantly reduced.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in the 90\u2019s and pushing through the age group ranks with what Bovell has previously described as limited knowledge, resources and opportunities, he now feels compelled to contribute to the overall improvement of swimming on all levels. Bovell feels confident that, \u201cwith access to world-class facilities, world-class Trinidad swimmers will become the norm and not the exception.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://newsday.co.tt/2020/04/08/bovell-relies-on-the-hammer-of-justice/", "page_content": "Bovell relies on the \u2018hammer of justice\u2019\n\nGeorge Bovell III, showing off the 'hammer of justice' -\n\nGEORGE BOVELL III was TT\u2019s lone Olympic medallist at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece.\n\nBovell III, then 21 years of age, copped bronze in the men\u2019s 200-metre individual medley, becoming the first, and only, TT swimmer, to medal at the Games.\n\nRecently, Bovell III and his coach Anil Roberts spoke about the journey they both shared \u2013 leading up to the 2004 Games, as well as the event itself.\n\nHere is Part Two of the journey\u2026\n\nAnil Roberts (AR): We moved on to the 200IM a few days later. We were a little bit short of training, so I didn\u2019t want him to overdo and overpush. In the heats, we had a strategy of just doing the first 100 at about 75-80 percent, get a lead, then cool it and make sure he\u2019s in the top 16 for the semi-finals. I told him that, in the semi-final, the key is still to conserve energy because we are not as fit as we want to be. So (he\u2019ll) swim through and, in the last 20-25 metres, shut it down and make sure that you qualify for the final.\n\nCome second (and) let Laszlo Cseh from Hungary pass you. I had to insist that there was no medal in the semi-final. It was more important that he saved every bit of energy for the final. He listened and he did everything to perfection. George Bovell III (GB): I was preparing myself for the struggle of my life coming up, the 200 (metre) IM. I want to give you a quote, to describe how the 200m IM is. It\u2019s about holding up a heavy weight that gets heavier and heavier with every passing second, and it crushes you.\n\nYou\u2019re maintaining that impossible rhythm of exertion while executing mastery of technique, not one but all four strokes, and the transitions between the strokes. Total exhaustion must come long before the end of the race. You must have a really strong mind to force the body to hold on that rhythm and survive, to keep going, without drowning. That\u2019s what the 200m IM is all about.\n\nIn the heats, I really played it cool. In the semi-final, I\u2019m stacked up against a man I expect to beat to get a medal. Swimming is not only about physical condition, there is a lot of mind games that happen. I could have pushed and beat him. In the home leg, I slowed down and gave him a false sense of power over me, for him to feel like he broke (my spirit). I had to pull out all of the tricks in my book because my body was like 60 percent, because of my shoulder. That was a tactic that paid off well in the final.\n\nBovell III finished third in the second semi-final, in a time of two minutes 0.31 seconds, trailing Cseh (1:59.65) and Brazil\u2019s Thiago Pereira (2:00.07).\n\nAR: George qualified for the final, to be in lane two. We were going against Michael Phelps, (Ryan) Lochte and Cseh. In swimming, you have 25 minutes before the final where they\u2019ll go into a \u2018ready\u2019 room. Just before I was to send him down into the room, I was seeing nervousness. I tried different things but I had to be careful because, in a high-pressure situation, you don\u2019t want to add too much pressure because it will bring negative results. I just wasn\u2019t getting it.\n\n(Roberts called Bahamian swimmer Jeremy Knowles, his teammate at Auburn University). I said, \u2018I want you to talk to George, I need you to get him ready, he\u2019s looking a little nervous\u2019. Jeremy took aside and I went out of earshot. I saw Jeremy take out a marker that he had in his pocket and he drew something on the inside of his right bicep.\n\nWhatever he did, I saw this look of confidence, of self-esteem, of relaxation. George looked at me and I said, \u2018let\u2019s go\u2019. He went and had the swim of a lifetime.\n\nGB: This is everything that you wanted. You have a little voice that comes up in the back of your mind that tells you \u2018don\u2019t mess this up\u2019. Before the final, everyone must go into a room, a very small room where you wait about 20 minutes. It\u2019s very intense in this room. I was preparing myself since I had the injury, to lay my life on the line. A friend of mine came up to me and drew this hammer on my bicep.\n\nI had a reputation (and was) called the \u2018hammer of justice\u2019. If you\u2019re racing against somebody and you are very tired, and you know the other person is very tired too, and you speed up, even though you cannot sustain that acceleration, eventually what starts to happen is that the person you\u2019re racing against, who\u2019s looking over at you, they say \u2018whey boy, George he\u2019s fresh\u2019 and they eventually give up, and you break their spirit.\n\nWhen they have given up and drop back, then you can relax the pace. When you break somebody\u2019s spirit like that, in practice, that\u2019s called \u2018dropping the hammer of justice\u2019. I used to do this to people.\n\nAR: His normal freestyle split could have 28.16, it was 29.0, but it was still good enough to give him that bronze medal. Guess who he beat for the bronze medal? The very said Laszlo Cseh who, the day before, he had allowed him to pass. George made history, it was a proud effort. It was the hammer of justice which was drawn on his bicep by Knowles which brought him into the mental state of readiness, to perform. The hammer of justice represented how George used to train with his teammates when they were under pressure. George\u2019s father was the manager and I was the coach, we fell down in the pool deck, hugging up. All the countries were so happy because they love when small countries get on the podium because, in swimming, it\u2019s very rare. It was a great time and it still goes down in history as the greatest swimming moment for TT. I was so proud of George.\n\nGB: Even though my body was physically weak, I had competed in six races already. I had doubts about my physical strength. When (Knowles) drew that marker on me, it reminded me (that) my soul is strong, I am a warrior. I was ready to lay it all out. I had to pace it, I was physically weak, I was seventh after the first (part). In the backstroke I started to dig, started to put some energy and make up some ground.\n\nI felt so weak at the end of that backstroke and I couldn\u2019t believe this was happening in the final. I had a moment of weakness. In that moment of weakness comes the perfect excuse \u2013 the exhaustion, the injury. I was so tempted to take that excuse and just slow down. I didn\u2019t feel like how I hoped to feel in the Olympics final. I pushed through the pain and I kept accelerating.\n\n(Bovell III admitted that, during the turn and push-off for the breaststroke, he gained a lot of ground on his rivals).\n\nI started to push the breaststroke like a fire burning in my heart. I kept accelerating as if the end of the breaststroke was the end of the race.\n\nI moved up into second at the end of the breaststroke. Laszlo Cseh, the man next to me, I think he expected me to break. I kept my rhythm and it caused him to panic a little bit and lose his composure. I think it\u2019s because of the tactic I played in the semi-final gave me a psychological advantage over him.\n\nMy freestyle was not a strong as usual, so I kept pushing and pushing. An interesting thing happened, when I touched the wall, it showed me in second place and then the clock had me in third place, it switched places with Lochte and myself.\n\nSome people say America owns it because NBC has the tv rights, and a one-two America finish is good for the ratings. I came out of the ball with a headache, but a great sense of relief."}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/george-bovell/", "page_content": "George Richard Lytcott Bovell (born 18 July 1983) is an Olympic bronze medalist swimmer and former world record holder from Trinidad and Tobago.

He is known for organizing and conducting the annual \"George Bovell Dive In Free Swim Clinics\", that are free for the youth of Trinidad and Tobago who enjoy the privilege of being coached and mentored by renowned Olympic Medalist Swimmers from around the world. Bovell has been the writer of the popular inspirational newspaper column in the Trinidad Guardian entitled \"Reflections Off The Water\".

At the 2004 Olympics, he won a bronze medal in the men's 200 IM: the 9th medalist in the country's history and 12th medal overall. It was also the first-ever Olympic swimming medal for the country, and T&T's only medal from the 2004 Olympics. Bovell also made it to the Finals of the 50m Freestyle in London where he placed 7th in the fastest field ever assembled after returning from a forced hiatus due to a brain injury earlier in the season. Bovell carried the T&T flag at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics in 2008, the 20th Central American and Caribbean Games in Cartagena, Colombia and in the closing ceremonies of the 2000, 2004 and 2012 Olympic Games.\n\nWorld Championships\n\nIn 2013 Bovell won the Bronze Medal in the 50m freestyle at the FINA World Long Course Championships in Barcelona against the fastest field ever assembled in the sport, one in which every competitor in the final was an Olympic Medalist. His Bronze Medal time of 21.51 seconds would have won the silver in the London Olympic Final a year earlier.\n\nIn 2012 Bovell won the Bronze Medal in the 100m Individual Medley at the Fina World Short Course Championships in Istanbul, a testament to his versatility.\n\nBovell has been in 10 World Championship finals since his first in 2001.\n\nSwimming Career Highlights\n\nOlympic Bronze Medallist\n\nFormer World Record Holder\n\nTwo-time World Championship Bronze Medallist\n\nSix-time Pan Am Games Medallist (2 Gold, 2 Silver, 2 Bronze)\n\nTen-time World Championship Finalist\n\n2nd Place Overall in the 2012 FINA World Cup (7 gold, 9 silver)\n\nFive-time Individual NCAA Champion\n\nEight-time Individual SEC Champion\n\nCaribbean and Central American Champion of three consecutive games and record holder, also 3 silver, 2 bronze\n\nFormer NCAA Record Holder\n\nMost All American Honours in Auburn History with 25\n\nMultiple Caribbean and Central American record holder\n\nFour-time NCAA Team Champion\n\nUndefeated in NCAA team Division 1 swimming career\n\nTrinidad and Tobago National Awards\n\nChaconia Gold\n\nHumming Bird Gold\n\nTrinidad and Tobago Sportsman Of The Year 2004 & 2014\n\nTTOC Athlete of the year\n\n2012 CCN TV6 Viewers Choice Sports Personality of the Year\n\n2013 Trinidad Express Personality of the Year\n\n2014 CCN TV6 Viewers Choice Sports Personality of the Year\n\n2014 Trinidad Guardian Sportsman of the Year\n\n2014 Trinidad Tobago Olympic Committee Sports Personality of the Year\n\nMain Events\n\nYear Event Race Position 2000 Summer Olympics 50m Freestyle Heats 2000 Summer Olympics 200m Ind Medley Heats 2000 Summer Olympics 400m Ind Medley Heats 2001 World Championship 200m Freestyle Heats 2001 World Championship 200m Ind Medley Finals 4th 2001 World Championship 400m Ind Medley Heats 2002 Short Course World Championship 200m Freestyle Semifinal 2002 Short Course World Championship 100m Ind Medley Semifinal 2002 Short Course World Championship 200m Ind Medley 7\u00b0 2003 World Championship 200m Freestyle Semifinal 2003 World Championship 200m Ind Medley 5\u00b0 2004 Summer Olympics 100m Freestyle Semifinal 2004 Summer Olympics 200m Freestyle Semifinal 2004 Summer Olympics 200m Ind Medley 03 ! 2006 Pan Pacific Championship 50m Freestyle 8\u00b0 2006 Pan Pacific Championship 100m Freestyle B Final 2007 World Championship 50m Freestyle Heats 2007 World Championship 100m Freestyle Heats 2008 Summer Olympics 50m Freestyle Semifinal 2008 Summer Olympics 100m Freestyle Heats 2008 Short Course World Championship 50m Freestyle Semifinal 2008 Short Course World Championship 100m Ind Medley 8\u00b0 2009 World Championship 50m Freestyle Finals 7th 2009 World Championship 100m Freestyle Heats 2010 Pan Pacific Championship 50m Freestyle B Final 2010 Pan Pacific Championship 100m Freestyle Heats 2010 Pan Pacific Championship 50m Backstroke B Final 2010 Short Course World Championship 50m Freestyle Semifinal 2010 Short Course World Championship 100m Ind Medley 4\u00b0 2011 World Championship 50m Freestyle 7\u00b0 2012 Summer Olympics 50m Freestyle 7\u00b0 2012 Summer Olympics 100m Backstroke Heats 2012 Short Course World Championship 50m Freestyle 4\u00b0 2012 Short Course World Championship 100m Ind Medley 03 ! 2013 World Championship 50m Freestyle 03 !\n\nBest Times"}, {"url": "https://ttaquatics.org/2022/02/08/george-bovell-iii-again-recognized-as-one-of-the-fastest-men-ever-by-swimswam-and-swimmingstats/", "page_content": "As we head to yet another CARIFTA Championships we remember one of our own the greatest sprinter of all time from the region the Legendary \" King\" George Bovell III of Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nHe is ranked as the seventh fastest man of all time in the 50 metre freestyle in the Olympic sized pool with his 2009 Rome World Championships blast of of 21.20.That time also stood as a Championship record\n\nHis speed is also unmatched in the region for the 25 yards pool and the 25 metre pool."}, {"url": "https://teamtto.org/index.php/ttoc/affiliates/swimming/7728-bovell-hopes-to-be-an-inspiration-to-tt-youths", "page_content": "GEORGE BOVELL III was TT\u2019s lone Olympic medallist at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece.\n\nBovell III, then 21 years of age, copped bronze in the men\u2019s 200-metre individual medley, becoming the first, and only, TT swimmer, to medal at the Games.\n\nRecently, Bovell III and his coach Anil Roberts spoke about the journey they both shared \u2013 leading up to the 2004 Games, as well as the event itself.\n\nHere is the third and final part of the journey\u2026\n\nAnil Roberts: In 2004, that turned out to be the only medal (for TT).

These big countries have everything, they have massage therapists, they have the best sports science they\u2019ve got everything and me, coming from Trinidad, we have none of those resources. I felt a sense of pride that we can reach that level despite where we\u2019re coming from because, now, we have the National Aquatic Centre, back then we have very terrible facilities, very Third World. I don\u2019t think at the time I really understood the significance of what it meant to (get) a medal for Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nOnly now, as I\u2019m out of the sport, that I can look back and say \u2018wow, maybe I blazed a trail and inspired many people\u2019. I was hoping at the time that I inspired a lot of people because I see people in Trinidad, the youths especially, and it\u2019s not that we lack opportunities, a lot of times we just lack motivation. They can never imagine that they too could be great. It\u2019s like a mental block.\n\nPeople tend to just accept mediocrity and say \u2018I\u2019m okay with just going to the Olympics\u2019. It\u2019s something I hope would just change the way we think and start to hold ourselves to a higher standard. The irony is that was my last 200 IM. A few months after that, I had a terrible knee injury and it ended my ability to swim the breaststroke properly. I had to face that reality and say either I change and go for something else or retire and say I had a good run.\n\nI bounced back to (get) a World Championship medal (bronze in the 50-metre freestyle in Barcelona, Spain in 2013) and be in an Olympic final, in the 50m freestyle, which is a completely different race. Of course, there are injuries along the way.\n\nI think that the bronze (at Athens), in a way, was a blessing. If I had won the gold medal, I think I would have become too proud. Personally, my belief, along with many other people, I doubt the legitimacy of Michael Phelps. I see the Olympic size of reality tv show and, from my own belief, that number two drop to number three, on that day, I think that with clean, fair and honourable competition, I was the best.\n\nIt does not matter of you\u2019re fighting cancer, taking chemotherapy, you\u2019re struggling to feed your family or competing in sport, life gives you a challenge. And if you have the perfect excuse, as long as you have the mental willpower to resist that excuse and keep pushing, you are a champion.\n\nSource"}, {"url": "https://newsday.co.tt/2020/04/07/shoulder-injury-threatened-to-derail-bovells-hopes/", "page_content": "Shoulder injury threatened to derail Bovell\u2019s hopes\n\nIn this June 4, 2016 file photo, George Bovell III swims during the first test event at the National Aquatic Centre, Couva. Photo: Allan Crane/CA-images - Allan Crane/CA-images\n\nGEORGE BOVELL III was TT\u2019s lone Olympic medallist at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece.\n\nBovell III, then 21 years of age, copped bronze in the men\u2019s 200-metre individual medley, becoming the first, and only, TT swimmer, to medal at the Games.\n\nRecently, Bovell III and his coach Anil Roberts spoke about the journey they both shared \u2013 leading up to the 2004 Games, as well as the event itself.\n\nHere is Part One of the journey\u2026\n\nThe lead-up to the Games, how was it like?\n\nAnil Roberts (AR): It was exceptional. George had a good 2003. He had one gold and two silver at the Pan American Games (in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic). He made the World Championships (200m IM) final where he came fifth (in Barcelona, Spain).\n\nIn March 2004, at the NCAA Championships (in New York), I went up with him, he was representing Auburn University in his final year. He broke the world record (short course) in the 200m IM (with a time of one minute 53.93 seconds, on March 25, 2004), he had some great relay swims, so he was really in good form. After that, we started to prepare for the Olympics. Everything was going good.\n\nGeorge Bovell (GB): The build-up was less than ideal. I was swimming in America and, when you start to beat all the Americans, and you have an American coach, he stops caring about you.\n\nI had to do it on my own really, so that\u2019s why I got Anil involved. I look back at that, with some resentment towards the American coach (David Marsh) for the way he handled things.\n\nI think it\u2019s natural (about his resentful feelings). I was a big threat to the Americans and the Americans approach the Olympics very seriously. They like to be number one at all costs. So, I had to deal with that.\n\nBovell suffered a shoulder injury, in a vehicular mishap, before the Athens Games, an injury which threatened to end all hopes he had for a medal.\n\nAR: He was on his way to practice, with his old jeep. He pulled the steering wheel with one arm and he strained his deltoid in his left shoulder. That sent us into a bit of a panic because we had to rest the shoulder, but we could not afford to lose any speed, power, aerobic threshold. I had to start to create a whole set of ideas to keep him training, with his legs and his right arm.\n\nGB: In the build-up, I did have a shoulder injury. It was quite serious. I never really let on to anybody else, I didn\u2019t even tell Anil or my dad, nobody. I couldn\u2019t move my arm through the movements of the freestyle, butterfly or the backstroke. There was a lot of pressure but, of course, you don\u2019t want to make excuses. You\u2019re trying to be professional and go out there and take care of business.\n\nIn my mind, I was trying not to dwell on the fact that I was injured. I iced it twice a day. I spent my days very quiet, reading a book and preparing myself, cultivating a lot of strength and will-power, in order to do what I intended to do.\n\nBovell III, his father/manager George Bovell II and Roberts are both in Athens, with the ace TT swimmer involved in a couple of events, before the 200m IM.\n\nAR: We went into the Games Village early because swimming is the first event (in) the Games. We went in on August 3 and his first race on August 12, which would have been the 100m freestyle. We knew we weren\u2019t going into that event to get a medal but we wanted to get a solid swim, see where he was.\n\nHe went into the heats but, unfortunately, was disqualified for a false start. It was the first time that a disqualification (had) ever been overturned. When I looked at the card, I saw that the judge had just put false-start, they did not put what was the false-start.\n\nI said, \u2018you need to put more detail into the disqualification\u2019. The panel upheld my protest and he was put back into the semi-final. He swam a good time (49.53 seconds), he didn\u2019t make the final but it had given him a taste of the afternoon swimming. It had settled his nerves. It was very important for his mental health.\n\nGB: I approached the Olympics like a busy schedule. The heats of the 200m freestyle came first, and I was the Pan American champion. I was very disappointed because of my injury, and my inability to practice freestyle, up until the race. Even though I gave like 150 percent, it was difficult, and my resulting time (one minute 49.59 seconds) was slower than the time that I gave at the Pan Am Games.\n\nI really think if you really think positive, you can have effects of a positive mind affecting the body in positive ways. Then we\u2019re getting ready for the 100m freestyle. I made the semi-finals. I can\u2019t describe how much intensity and effort. I barely did my best time and even that was a great disappointment for me."}, {"url": "https://www.famousbirthdays.com/people/george-bovell.html", "page_content": "About\n\nSwimmer who won Trinidad and Tobago's first Olympic swimming medal when he took bronze at the 2004 games in the 200M individual medley.\n\nBefore Fame\n\nHe attended Auburn University, where he set a school record earning 25 All-American honors.\n\nTrivia\n\nOn March 25, 2004, he set a 200M IM world record, which lasted for more than a year and a half.\n\nFamily Life\n\nHis brother, Nicholas Bovell, also competed at the 2008 Olympics.\n\nAssociated With\n\nWhen he won bronze at the 2004 Olympics, he finished behind silver-medalist Ryan Lochte, and gold-medalist Michael Phelps."}, {"url": "https://newsday.co.tt/2020/04/10/bovell-hopes-to-be-an-inspiration-to-tt-youths/", "page_content": "Bovell hopes to be an inspiration to TT youths\n\nIn this August 19, 2004 file photo, TT's George Bovell adjusts his crown after claiming the men's 200m individual medley bronze medal, at the 2004 Olympic Games at the Olympic Aquatic Center in Athens.

I had to face that reality and say either I change and go for something else or retire and say I had a good run.\n\nI bounced back to (get) a World Championship medal (bronze in the 50-metre freestyle in Barcelona, Spain in 2013) and be in an Olympic final, in the 50m freestyle, which is a completely different race. Of course, there are injuries along the way.\n\nI think that the bronze (at Athens), in a way, was a blessing. If I had won the gold medal, I think I would have become too proud. Personally, my belief, along with many other people, I doubt the legitimacy of Michael Phelps. I see the Olympic size of reality tv show and, from my own belief, that number two drop to number three, on that day, I think that with clean, fair and honourable competition, I was the best.\n\nIt does not matter of you\u2019re fighting cancer, taking chemotherapy, you\u2019re struggling to feed your family or competing in sport, life gives you a challenge. And if you have the perfect excuse, as long as you have the mental willpower to resist that excuse and keep pushing, you are a champion."}, {"url": "https://swimswam.com/bovell-tests-out-trinidad-tobagos-aquatics-center/", "page_content": "Four-time Olympian George Bovell was on-hand at a test event held at Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s brand new aquatics center last week. The temporarily-naed National Aquatic Center, situated in Balmain Couva, invited 32-year-old Bovell as its first swimmer to take to the 50m pool\u2019s water. Bovell is cited as a primary inspiration for the facility, which has been in the works for several years now.\n\nThe facility in Trinidad consists of a 50m outdoor warm-up pool, diving well, a fitness room with sauna, Turkish bath, as well as a cold water pool. The site has the ability to permanently seat 700 spectators and is outfitted with scoring and timing, as well as above ground and underwater audio and video systems.\n\nOf his participation in the center\u2019s test event, Bovell commented to Newsday, \u201cIt\u2019s been in the news since 2003 and it\u2019s great that I\u2019ve lived to see this and be able to enjoy it today.\u201d\n\nReflecting on his humble beginnings, the Olympic bronze medalist said, \u201cWhen I now started off swimming you should have seen the pool; green in color, six lanes, just a big hole in the ground. And to now see that we have reached at the highest of the sport internationally with this facility is amazing.\u201d\n\nEver the visionary, Bovell sees the possibility of the aquatics center to act as a growth driver both within the sport of swimming, as well as economically. \u201cWe need to market this to the world,\u201d he added. \u201cWe need to get teams from around the globe to come and enjoy our weather and facility and boost our economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot university and professional teams, around winter time, that spend money to Bahamas, Cayman Islands, Bermuda and sometimes Barbados to train. If we could capture some of that market, it would allow this facility to be sustainable. The money coming in from those visiting teams would allow us to upkeep this at no cost to us. I have traveled around the world and have a long-established network that we can hopefully tap into.\u201d\n\nAn additional revenue opportunity is tied to the naming of the venue, which is still in the works. Minister of Sport Darryl Smith did comment that there is still a possibility of the main pool being named after Bovell.\n\n\u201cI still have to take that proposal to Cabinet but I don\u2019t think it would be a problem naming one of the pools (after him) and some of the other pools in recognition of others who have done well,\u201d said Smith.\n\nSmith also acknowledged the business side of the facility as well, indicating that, \u201cWe have to get revenue so we can maintain and have proper functions happening here. At the end of the day we want to make sure that we maintain this high-maintenance facility because there is really nothing like this in the Caribbean. We want to ensure we have the right people to manage it.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the aquatic center\u2019s name, Bovell conveys that inspiring the next young crop of swimmers is the goal. \u201cThis next generation coming up, not only do they have an example of someone who has gone out there from this six lane hole in the ground pool and done what he has done with the limited resources that he had, but they have the means and the example to follow so I am looking forward to an incredibly bright future for swimming in Trinidad and Tobago,\u201d Bovell said.\n\nBovell will be competing in his 5th Olympic Games this summer in Rio."}], "George Bovell III was a member of the Trinidad and Tobago national team by the age of 13.": [{"url": "https://olympics.com/en/athletes/george-bovell-iii", "page_content": "Year of Birth\n\nYear of Birth 1983\n\nFirst Olympic Games\n\nFirst Olympic Games Sydney 2000\n\nTrinidad and Tobago\n\nTeam Trinidad and Tobago"}, {"url": "https://newsday.co.tt/2020/04/08/bovell-relies-on-the-hammer-of-justice/", "page_content": "Bovell relies on the \u2018hammer of justice\u2019\n\nGeorge Bovell III, showing off the 'hammer of justice' -\n\nGEORGE BOVELL III was TT\u2019s lone Olympic medallist at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece.\n\nBovell III, then 21 years of age, copped bronze in the men\u2019s 200-metre individual medley, becoming the first, and only, TT swimmer, to medal at the Games.\n\nRecently, Bovell III and his coach Anil Roberts spoke about the journey they both shared \u2013 leading up to the 2004 Games, as well as the event itself.\n\nHere is Part Two of the journey\u2026\n\nAnil Roberts (AR): We moved on to the 200IM a few days later. We were a little bit short of training, so I didn\u2019t want him to overdo and overpush. In the heats, we had a strategy of just doing the first 100 at about 75-80 percent, get a lead, then cool it and make sure he\u2019s in the top 16 for the semi-finals. I told him that, in the semi-final, the key is still to conserve energy because we are not as fit as we want to be. So (he\u2019ll) swim through and, in the last 20-25 metres, shut it down and make sure that you qualify for the final.\n\nCome second (and) let Laszlo Cseh from Hungary pass you. I had to insist that there was no medal in the semi-final. It was more important that he saved every bit of energy for the final. He listened and he did everything to perfection. George Bovell III (GB): I was preparing myself for the struggle of my life coming up, the 200 (metre) IM. I want to give you a quote, to describe how the 200m IM is. It\u2019s about holding up a heavy weight that gets heavier and heavier with every passing second, and it crushes you.\n\nYou\u2019re maintaining that impossible rhythm of exertion while executing mastery of technique, not one but all four strokes, and the transitions between the strokes. Total exhaustion must come long before the end of the race. You must have a really strong mind to force the body to hold on that rhythm and survive, to keep going, without drowning. That\u2019s what the 200m IM is all about.\n\nIn the heats, I really played it cool. In the semi-final, I\u2019m stacked up against a man I expect to beat to get a medal. Swimming is not only about physical condition, there is a lot of mind games that happen. I could have pushed and beat him. In the home leg, I slowed down and gave him a false sense of power over me, for him to feel like he broke (my spirit). I had to pull out all of the tricks in my book because my body was like 60 percent, because of my shoulder. That was a tactic that paid off well in the final.\n\nBovell III finished third in the second semi-final, in a time of two minutes 0.31 seconds, trailing Cseh (1:59.65) and Brazil\u2019s Thiago Pereira (2:00.07).\n\nAR: George qualified for the final, to be in lane two. We were going against Michael Phelps, (Ryan) Lochte and Cseh. In swimming, you have 25 minutes before the final where they\u2019ll go into a \u2018ready\u2019 room. Just before I was to send him down into the room, I was seeing nervousness. I tried different things but I had to be careful because, in a high-pressure situation, you don\u2019t want to add too much pressure because it will bring negative results. I just wasn\u2019t getting it.\n\n(Roberts called Bahamian swimmer Jeremy Knowles, his teammate at Auburn University). I said, \u2018I want you to talk to George, I need you to get him ready, he\u2019s looking a little nervous\u2019. Jeremy took aside and I went out of earshot. I saw Jeremy take out a marker that he had in his pocket and he drew something on the inside of his right bicep.\n\nWhatever he did, I saw this look of confidence, of self-esteem, of relaxation. George looked at me and I said, \u2018let\u2019s go\u2019. He went and had the swim of a lifetime.\n\nGB: This is everything that you wanted. You have a little voice that comes up in the back of your mind that tells you \u2018don\u2019t mess this up\u2019. Before the final, everyone must go into a room, a very small room where you wait about 20 minutes. It\u2019s very intense in this room. I was preparing myself since I had the injury, to lay my life on the line. A friend of mine came up to me and drew this hammer on my bicep.\n\nI had a reputation (and was) called the \u2018hammer of justice\u2019. If you\u2019re racing against somebody and you are very tired, and you know the other person is very tired too, and you speed up, even though you cannot sustain that acceleration, eventually what starts to happen is that the person you\u2019re racing against, who\u2019s looking over at you, they say \u2018whey boy, George he\u2019s fresh\u2019 and they eventually give up, and you break their spirit.\n\nWhen they have given up and drop back, then you can relax the pace. When you break somebody\u2019s spirit like that, in practice, that\u2019s called \u2018dropping the hammer of justice\u2019. I used to do this to people.\n\nAR: His normal freestyle split could have 28.16, it was 29.0, but it was still good enough to give him that bronze medal. Guess who he beat for the bronze medal? The very said Laszlo Cseh who, the day before, he had allowed him to pass. George made history, it was a proud effort. It was the hammer of justice which was drawn on his bicep by Knowles which brought him into the mental state of readiness, to perform. The hammer of justice represented how George used to train with his teammates when they were under pressure. George\u2019s father was the manager and I was the coach, we fell down in the pool deck, hugging up. All the countries were so happy because they love when small countries get on the podium because, in swimming, it\u2019s very rare. It was a great time and it still goes down in history as the greatest swimming moment for TT. I was so proud of George.\n\nGB: Even though my body was physically weak, I had competed in six races already. I had doubts about my physical strength. When (Knowles) drew that marker on me, it reminded me (that) my soul is strong, I am a warrior. I was ready to lay it all out. I had to pace it, I was physically weak, I was seventh after the first (part). In the backstroke I started to dig, started to put some energy and make up some ground.\n\nI felt so weak at the end of that backstroke and I couldn\u2019t believe this was happening in the final. I had a moment of weakness. In that moment of weakness comes the perfect excuse \u2013 the exhaustion, the injury. I was so tempted to take that excuse and just slow down. I didn\u2019t feel like how I hoped to feel in the Olympics final. I pushed through the pain and I kept accelerating.\n\n(Bovell III admitted that, during the turn and push-off for the breaststroke, he gained a lot of ground on his rivals).\n\nI started to push the breaststroke like a fire burning in my heart. I kept accelerating as if the end of the breaststroke was the end of the race.\n\nI moved up into second at the end of the breaststroke. Laszlo Cseh, the man next to me, I think he expected me to break. I kept my rhythm and it caused him to panic a little bit and lose his composure. I think it\u2019s because of the tactic I played in the semi-final gave me a psychological advantage over him.\n\nMy freestyle was not a strong as usual, so I kept pushing and pushing. An interesting thing happened, when I touched the wall, it showed me in second place and then the clock had me in third place, it switched places with Lochte and myself.\n\nSome people say America owns it because NBC has the tv rights, and a one-two America finish is good for the ratings. I came out of the ball with a headache, but a great sense of relief."}, {"url": "https://newsday.co.tt/2021/07/07/kelly-ann-baptiste-joins-george-bovell-iii-as-most-capped-trinidad-and-tobago-olympian/", "page_content": "Kelly-Ann Baptiste joins George Bovell III as most capped Trinidad and Tobago Olympian\n\nKelly Ann Baptiste -\n\nWOMEN\u2019S track and field sprinter Kelly-Ann Baptiste will join legendary swimmer George Bovell III as the most capped TT Olympian, as she is set to make her fifth appearance at the 2020 Tokyo Games, from July 23-August 8.\n\nA media release by the TT Olympic Committee (TTOC) on Wednesday, said, \u201cBovell made five consecutive appearances starting with the 2000 Sydney Olympics followed by his historic bronze medal effort at the 2004 Athens Games (in the 200-metre individual medley), team TTO\u2019s sole medal for that edition of the Olympics.\u201d\n\nBovell III did not let an injury deter him from continuing his swimming career as he switched focus to another event.\n\n\u201cAfter an ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) injury in September 2004, Bovell was forced to change his specialty from the endurance-testing 200m individual medley to the 50m freestyle dash.

TTOC president Brian Lewis hinted that TT may make history by naming its first women\u2019s flag-bearer for the opening ceremony.\n\n\"To date, the TTOC has never had a female flag-bearer at the opening ceremony of a Summer Olympic Games,\" Lewis said.\n\n\"It is my sincere hope that a female athlete will be chosen by the chef de mission Lovie Santana to carry the TT flag during the opening ceremony in Tokyo 2020.\"\n\nTT will have Santana, the experienced TTOC senior administrative officer, at the helm while TTOC project officer, athletes services and programmes, Rheeza Grant will serve as TT's covid19 liaison officer. TT will also rely on a strong medical staff of nine led by Dr Rudranath Ramsawak.\n\nAfter the Games were rescheduled due to the pandemic, Lewis said, \"The TTOC acknowledges the perseverance, dedication and determination of every athlete who tried their best to qualify for the covid19 pandemic impacted games, the first Olympic Games in history to be postponed.\"\n\nThis year's Olympic Games also hold special significance for the TTOC as it coincides with its 75-year anniversary."}, {"url": "https://swimswam.com/george-bovell-visionary-sport/", "page_content": "George Bovell, a name synonymous with Trinidadian swimming, recently enlisted the help of some elite friends in his quest to help inspire a younger generation of swimmers in his home region. Two-time Olympic bronze medalist for Russia, Arkady Vyatchanin (now most likely representing Serbia), Olympic gold medalist for South Africa Roland Schoeman, and World Champion New Zealander Moss Burmester joined the 2004-Olympic bronze medalist in the Caribbean for a series of free clinics using swimming as a platform to both benefit and excite young athletes.\n\nThe \u201cGeorge Bovell Dive In Free Swim Clinics 2015\u201d were held at facilities in St. James, Macoya and San Fernando over January 15-17th, with the prestigious athletes teaching training methods, skills and drills with the purpose of not only encouraging the young attendees within the sport of swimming, but by also offering up hope and inspiration as they interacted and collaborated with the participants.\n\nBovell tells SwimSwam that, \u201cthe clinics were a huge success; you all can\u2019t imagine what it meant to those kids.

Photo: Allan Crane/CA-images - Allan Crane/CA-images\n\nGEORGE BOVELL III was TT\u2019s lone Olympic medallist at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece.\n\nBovell III, then 21 years of age, copped bronze in the men\u2019s 200-metre individual medley, becoming the first, and only, TT swimmer, to medal at the Games.\n\nRecently, Bovell III and his coach Anil Roberts spoke about the journey they both shared \u2013 leading up to the 2004 Games, as well as the event itself.\n\nHere is Part One of the journey\u2026\n\nThe lead-up to the Games, how was it like?\n\nAnil Roberts (AR): It was exceptional. George had a good 2003. He had one gold and two silver at the Pan American Games (in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic). He made the World Championships (200m IM) final where he came fifth (in Barcelona, Spain).\n\nIn March 2004, at the NCAA Championships (in New York), I went up with him, he was representing Auburn University in his final year. He broke the world record (short course) in the 200m IM (with a time of one minute 53.93 seconds, on March 25, 2004), he had some great relay swims, so he was really in good form. After that, we started to prepare for the Olympics. Everything was going good.\n\nGeorge Bovell (GB): The build-up was less than ideal. I was swimming in America and, when you start to beat all the Americans, and you have an American coach, he stops caring about you.\n\nI had to do it on my own really, so that\u2019s why I got Anil involved. I look back at that, with some resentment towards the American coach (David Marsh) for the way he handled things.\n\nI think it\u2019s natural (about his resentful feelings). I was a big threat to the Americans and the Americans approach the Olympics very seriously. They like to be number one at all costs. So, I had to deal with that.\n\nBovell suffered a shoulder injury, in a vehicular mishap, before the Athens Games, an injury which threatened to end all hopes he had for a medal.\n\nAR: He was on his way to practice, with his old jeep. He pulled the steering wheel with one arm and he strained his deltoid in his left shoulder. That sent us into a bit of a panic because we had to rest the shoulder, but we could not afford to lose any speed, power, aerobic threshold. I had to start to create a whole set of ideas to keep him training, with his legs and his right arm.\n\nGB: In the build-up, I did have a shoulder injury. It was quite serious. I never really let on to anybody else, I didn\u2019t even tell Anil or my dad, nobody. I couldn\u2019t move my arm through the movements of the freestyle, butterfly or the backstroke. There was a lot of pressure but, of course, you don\u2019t want to make excuses. You\u2019re trying to be professional and go out there and take care of business.\n\nIn my mind, I was trying not to dwell on the fact that I was injured. I iced it twice a day. I spent my days very quiet, reading a book and preparing myself, cultivating a lot of strength and will-power, in order to do what I intended to do.\n\nBovell III, his father/manager George Bovell II and Roberts are both in Athens, with the ace TT swimmer involved in a couple of events, before the 200m IM.\n\nAR: We went into the Games Village early because swimming is the first event (in) the Games. We went in on August 3 and his first race on August 12, which would have been the 100m freestyle. We knew we weren\u2019t going into that event to get a medal but we wanted to get a solid swim, see where he was.\n\nHe went into the heats but, unfortunately, was disqualified for a false start. It was the first time that a disqualification (had) ever been overturned. When I looked at the card, I saw that the judge had just put false-start, they did not put what was the false-start.\n\nI said, \u2018you need to put more detail into the disqualification\u2019. The panel upheld my protest and he was put back into the semi-final. He swam a good time (49.53 seconds), he didn\u2019t make the final but it had given him a taste of the afternoon swimming. It had settled his nerves. It was very important for his mental health.\n\nGB: I approached the Olympics like a busy schedule. The heats of the 200m freestyle came first, and I was the Pan American champion. I was very disappointed because of my injury, and my inability to practice freestyle, up until the race. Even though I gave like 150 percent, it was difficult, and my resulting time (one minute 49.59 seconds) was slower than the time that I gave at the Pan Am Games.\n\nI really think if you really think positive, you can have effects of a positive mind affecting the body in positive ways. Then we\u2019re getting ready for the 100m freestyle. I made the semi-finals. I can\u2019t describe how much intensity and effort. I barely did my best time and even that was a great disappointment for me."}, {"url": "https://swimswam.com/bovell-tests-out-trinidad-tobagos-aquatics-center/", "page_content": "Four-time Olympian George Bovell was on-hand at a test event held at Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s brand new aquatics center last week. The temporarily-naed National Aquatic Center, situated in Balmain Couva, invited 32-year-old Bovell as its first swimmer to take to the 50m pool\u2019s water. Bovell is cited as a primary inspiration for the facility, which has been in the works for several years now.\n\nThe facility in Trinidad consists of a 50m outdoor warm-up pool, diving well, a fitness room with sauna, Turkish bath, as well as a cold water pool. The site has the ability to permanently seat 700 spectators and is outfitted with scoring and timing, as well as above ground and underwater audio and video systems.\n\nOf his participation in the center\u2019s test event, Bovell commented to Newsday, \u201cIt\u2019s been in the news since 2003 and it\u2019s great that I\u2019ve lived to see this and be able to enjoy it today.\u201d\n\nReflecting on his humble beginnings, the Olympic bronze medalist said, \u201cWhen I now started off swimming you should have seen the pool; green in color, six lanes, just a big hole in the ground. And to now see that we have reached at the highest of the sport internationally with this facility is amazing.\u201d\n\nEver the visionary, Bovell sees the possibility of the aquatics center to act as a growth driver both within the sport of swimming, as well as economically. \u201cWe need to market this to the world,\u201d he added. \u201cWe need to get teams from around the globe to come and enjoy our weather and facility and boost our economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot university and professional teams, around winter time, that spend money to Bahamas, Cayman Islands, Bermuda and sometimes Barbados to train. If we could capture some of that market, it would allow this facility to be sustainable. The money coming in from those visiting teams would allow us to upkeep this at no cost to us. I have traveled around the world and have a long-established network that we can hopefully tap into.\u201d\n\nAn additional revenue opportunity is tied to the naming of the venue, which is still in the works. Minister of Sport Darryl Smith did comment that there is still a possibility of the main pool being named after Bovell.\n\n\u201cI still have to take that proposal to Cabinet but I don\u2019t think it would be a problem naming one of the pools (after him) and some of the other pools in recognition of others who have done well,\u201d said Smith.\n\nSmith also acknowledged the business side of the facility as well, indicating that, \u201cWe have to get revenue so we can maintain and have proper functions happening here. At the end of the day we want to make sure that we maintain this high-maintenance facility because there is really nothing like this in the Caribbean. We want to ensure we have the right people to manage it.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the aquatic center\u2019s name, Bovell conveys that inspiring the next young crop of swimmers is the goal. \u201cThis next generation coming up, not only do they have an example of someone who has gone out there from this six lane hole in the ground pool and done what he has done with the limited resources that he had, but they have the means and the example to follow so I am looking forward to an incredibly bright future for swimming in Trinidad and Tobago,\u201d Bovell said.\n\nBovell will be competing in his 5th Olympic Games this summer in Rio."}]}
