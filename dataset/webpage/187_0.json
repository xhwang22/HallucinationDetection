Upside: He's a very athletic slasher who uses his athleticism to elevate over his opponents. His vertical leap is off the charts. Has a nice mid-range jumper. A good ball handler. Good lateral quickness should allow him to be a decent defender in the pros. Has a good body. Downside: Consistency and that outside shot. Paulding took a 158 threes this season, but made just 34 percent. Last year he was much more effective from downtown. This year he was just streaky. Made four or more threes five times during the season. Missed four or more threes eleven times. Insider Projection: The biggest problem was consistency. The Tigers never knew who was going to show up. Paulding was huge in several big games this year including a 31 point performance (shooting 5-fot-7 from three) against Oklahoma State. But he also had a number of nine point stinkers against Kansas, Kansas State and Texas A&M. Scouts feel that his game is a better fit in the NBA than it was in college. However, he didn't stand out at all at the Chicago pre-draft camp. The fact that he measured at just 6-foot-4 also didn't help things. Will he even be drafted?\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://basketball.eurobasket.com/player/Rickey-Paulding/36315", "page_content": "Add/Change Agent:\n\nSelect Agent No agent 22ft Aaji Emile Abdat Adam Abderrahim Ahmed Abderrahim Dali Abduljalil Yusuf Abdullah Sadiq Abdullah Yousuf Abdur-Rahim Muhammad Aberdeen Barry Abraham Trisonya Abufarie Hend Adams Aaron Adams David Adams Major Adams Marvin Adams Thomas Adams Virgil AddNew111 AddNew5 AddNew9 AddNewNew Adelman Rebecca Adhepeau Julien Adjipa Andre Adubato Adam Afif Jean-Paul Afonso Carlos Afzelius Frank Agathangelidis Ilias Aguilar James Ahatri Omar Ahmad Najmuddin Ahmadi Mohammad Ahnfeldt Bennet Aidietis Giedrius Aisa Juan Ajavon Ayite Ajemian David Ajipa Andre Akana Jarinn Akbar Mahmood Akcil Burcu Akis Tsolis Akkaya Yasemin Aktulgali Tufan Al Jassas Yousif Alaudden Hashim Alava Vladimir Alberto Magarini Alderman Eric Aldi Massimiliano Aldredge Terence Alford Keith Al-hashem Beshar Alioune Fall Cheikh Allado Caloy Allard Bill Allemann Cedric Allen Adrienne Allen Jeffrey Allen Lionel Allison Dawan Allodi Jordan Alocen Lorenzo Alonso Cesar Alonso Jaime Alpini Monica Alsadek Mohamed Alston Wes Alsuwaidi Mohamed Althoffer Guillaume Altinmakas Onur Alvarez Luis Alvarez Orlando Alvarez Roberto Ames Brad Amiri Ali Amrmstead Guss Ancrum David Andelic Nikola Anderson Brian Anderson Corey Anderson Jay Anderson Sydney Anderson Tim Anderson Tommy Lee Andjelic Natasa Andrade Alex Andreanu Vlad Andrews Calvin Andrews Christian Andrews Drew Andrews George Andrikopoulos Andreas Andronescu Alexandru Angel Gary Angel Taylor Angela Davidson Angelakis Tom Aniello Daniele Anil Aksac Anjara Ashok Ankarali Ege Anno Hiroyuki Anshila Robert Anstey Ken Anthony Justin Anthony Steven Antigonos Theodorou Anton Douglas Antonelli Massimo Anyan Sam Anye Divine Anzoini Camillo Apostolopoulos Aranda Julian Arch Joaquinn Archer David Archer Teddy Archimio Nicolas Ardila Jhonatan Javier Ares Saul Arias Braulio Arias Colton Arias Mike Aris MNGM Armato Leonard Armfield Xavier Armstrong B.J.

Upside: He's a very athletic slasher who uses his athleticism to elevate over his opponents. His vertical leap is off the charts. Has a nice mid-range jumper. A good ball handler. Good lateral quickness should allow him to be a decent defender in the pros. Has a good body. Downside: Consistency and that outside shot. Paulding took a 158 threes this season, but made just 34 percent. Last year he was much more effective from downtown. This year he was just streaky. Made four or more threes five times during the season. Missed four or more threes eleven times. Insider Projection: The biggest problem was consistency. The Tigers never knew who was going to show up. Paulding was huge in several big games this year including a 31 point performance (shooting 5-fot-7 from three) against Oklahoma State.

Upside: He's a very athletic slasher who uses his athleticism to elevate over his opponents. His vertical leap is off the charts. Has a nice mid-range jumper. A good ball handler. Good lateral quickness should allow him to be a decent defender in the pros. Has a good body. Downside: Consistency and that outside shot. Paulding took a 158 threes this season, but made just 34 percent. Last year he was much more effective from downtown. This year he was just streaky. Made four or more threes five times during the season. Missed four or more threes eleven times. Insider Projection: The biggest problem was consistency. The Tigers never knew who was going to show up. Paulding was huge in several big games this year including a 31 point performance (shooting 5-fot-7 from three) against Oklahoma State. But he also had a number of nine point stinkers against Kansas, Kansas State and Texas A&M. Scouts feel that his game is a better fit in the NBA than it was in college. However, he didn't stand out at all at the Chicago pre-draft camp. The fact that he measured at just 6-foot-4 also didn't help things.

Undrafted players looking to catch eyes; NBA players assigned to gain seasoning.Beginning in the 2017 offseason, NBA rosters expanded from 15 to 17 players with the addition of two spots for players under \u201cTwo-Way Contracts.\u201d NBA teams may have up to two players under NBA Two-Way Contracts who will spend the bulk of the season in the NBA G League and not more than 45 days with their NBA team. Two-Way players are paid a corresponding daily amount based on the number of days they play in each league. Only players with four or fewer years of NBA service are able to sign Two-Way Contracts, which can be for either one or two seasons. | 2018-19 Two-Way Players Alex Caruso (Los Angeles Lakers/South Bay Lakers) and Chris Boucher (Toronto Raptors/ Raptors 905)Teams hold the rights to any player who has played for them within the last two seasons, as long as they have not released that player. Jameel Warney (Texas Legends), Josh Gray (Northern Arizona Suns), Walter Lemon Jr. (Fort Wayne Mad Ants)When NBA teams trim their rosters during training camp and the preseason, they have the first crack at acquiring their waived players on their NBA G League affiliate. Organizations can designate up to four \"affiliate players,\" though those players will remain NBA free agents. This still allows NBA front offices to identify prospects that they like and keep them in their system -- especially given the current state of the league, in which all 27 NBA G League teams are singly affiliated with an NBA parent club. Cameron Reynolds (Sacramento Kings/Stockton Kings) and Kadeem Allen (New York Knicks/Westchester Knicks) NBA G League teams hold tryouts during each offseason, inviting some players to participate for free while attracting locals who pay a small fee to participate. The teams can invite the cream of the crop (up to three players) to their training camps. A few dozen tryout players each year make their way onto training camp rosters, and many have even made it into game action and beyond. \"Mr. Mad Ant\" Ron Howard authored one Cinderella story among that group, parlaying a training camp invitation in 2007 into a seven-year career in Fort Wayne, capped by a championship and MVP season in 2014. Houston product Jonathon Simmons completed a journey from the Austin Spurs' local tryout in September 2013 to the San Antonio Spurs' roster in July 2015 before breaking out during the 2015-16 NBA season. Jonathon Simmons (Austin Spurs) and David Nwaba (South Bay Lakers)Every fall, more than 200 players are signed by the league office and placed in the NBA G League Draft. About half of them are selected on Draft day, which features a field of NBA and NBA G League vets, international pros, undrafted rookies and NBA G League National Tryout players. Many of the top picks arrive just days before the Draft after either arriving from overseas or being waived by NBA teams -- a group that included eventual Westchester Knicks star Jimmer Fredette in 2015. Jaylen Morris (Erie BayHawks) Scott Machado (South Bay Lakers), Aaron Best (Raptors 905)In 2014, the Oklahoma City Thunder made headlines for their decision to select Stanford forward Josh Huestis in the first round of the NBA Draft with the intent of adding him to their NBA Development League affiliate, the Oklahoma City Blue. He was called the league\u2019s first \u201cdomestic draft-and-stash\u201d player. The Thunder could do this through a rule that was implemented just three months before they drafted Huestis. The \u201cdraft rights player\u201d rule allows NBA G League teams to directly acquire players on their NBA parent club\u2019s draft list, bypassing the usual NBA G League player selection processes, including the NBA G League Draft and the in-season waiver wire.\n\nClick here to read more about the rule\n\nNBA ASSIGNEES\n\nNBA DRAFT-ELIGIBLE PLAYERS\n\nJaron Blossomgame (San Antonio Spurs/Austin Spurs), Isaiah Hartenstein (Houston Rockets/Rio Grande Valley Vipers)NBA teams can assign players with three years of service or less an unlimited number of times, and they're taking advantage of that rule each season. In 2014-15, 56 different players were assigned to NBA G League teams a record total of 195 times , including 14 first-round picks from the 2014 NBA Draft. With the advantage of having an affiliate within driving distance, several teams shuttled players back-and-forth between teams -- including the Spurs with first-round pick Kyle Anderson. Lonnie Walker IV (San Antonio Spurs/Austin Spurs) and Grayson Allen (Utah Jazz/Salt Lake City)A player who has not yet entered the NBA Draft can instead enter the NBA G League and maintain his NBA Draft eligibility. If the player signs with the NBA G League before the season, he is eligible for the NBA G League Draft.

Yet there he was, a couple of improbable games later, dancing with Stephen Curry out at the arc and contesting a shot that missed and sealed the Cavaliers\u2019 historic comeback and title in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe know that anything can happen. It has been done before, in a Conference Final and Final, I have been part of it before,\u201d Love said after a Heat Game 4 loss on their home court that felt like a punch to the gut. \u201cYou really just have to take it one possession at a time. Forget the game. It\u2019s just one possession, one quarter, half to half. Just get it done by any means necessary and figure the rest out.\u201d\n\nThe Heat locker room was quiet after Game 4. With good reason. The Heat just had dropped two games at home, and in the second one of those they held Nikola Joki\u0107 and Jamal Murray in relative check \u2014 with Joki\u0107 spending 5:15 of the heart of the fourth quarter on the bench due to foul trouble \u2013 and it didn\u2019t matter.

It\u2019s fine,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cYou probably shouldn\u2019t sleep tonight any amount of time. I don\u2019t think anybody will. We have an incredibly competitive group. We\u2019ve done everything the hard way, and that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to have to be done right now, again.\n\n\u201cAll we are going to focus on is getting this thing back to the 305.

It\u2019s going to be a gnarly game in Denver that is built for the competitors that we have in our locker room.\u201d\n\nResilience and relentlessness have been the Heat hallmarks this postseason, but those qualities are about to be tested like never before.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a team come back from 3-0 firsthand,\u201d Bam Adebayo said, referencing the Celtics near comeback on the Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals (Miami won Game 7 in Boston). \u201cSo we just have to believe, and one game at a time.\u201d\n\nThere was a 3-1 comeback in the 2016 NBA Finals, when the Cavaliers stormed back on Curry\u2019s Warriors. However, that comeback required a cocktail of events to be shaken together: Draymond Green\u2018s suspension for Game 5 after kicking LeBron James in the groin, Golden State center and defensive anchor Andrew Bogut getting injured and missing the final games, LeBron playing at his absolute peak, and a legendary Kyrie Irving bucket.\n\nCan Miami replicate that?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one game at a time. Now we are in a must-win situation every single game, which we\u2019re capable of,\u201d Jimmy Butler said. \u201cSome correctible things we\u2019ve got to do, but it\u2019s not impossible.
