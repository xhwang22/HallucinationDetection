Following the success of the Union's first battle in the campaign on working hours, workers flocked to join the new union and by 1911 its members numbered 77,000.\n\nAlso in 1889, on Tyneside, the National Amalgamated Union of Labour was formed and organised in the shipbuilding industry.\n\nTogether with the Municipal Employees Association and the National Federation of Women Workers, the four unions came together in 1924 to form the National Union of General and Municipal Workers. At that stage there were 359,000 members and although this figure dropped in the 1930s it picked up again in the war and during the years of full employment consensus.\n\nIn 1982 the philosophies of general unionism and skilled craft unionism were brought together when the Amalgamated Society of Boilermakers, Shipwrights, Blacksmiths and Structural Workers (ASBSBSW) joined the General and Municipal Workers' Union to form the General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trade Union, (GMBATU).\n\nAPEX the Association of Professional, Executive, Clerical and Computer Staff was founded in 1890 when about a dozen men met in an office in the Strand and decided to form the Clerk's Union. As membership increased and spread across the country, the name was changed to The National Union of Clerks. In 1920, after rapid growth and the absorption of a number of other unions, the membership figure was around 40,000 and the name was again changed to The National Union of Clerks and Administrative Workers (NUCAW).\n\nIn 1940, the Association of Women Clerks and Secretaries transferred to NUCAW and a new title was agreed: The Clerical and Administrative Workers Union. Then, in 1972, arising from the spread of the union's influence, changes in office skills and the growing ability of the union to represent staff at all levels, it changed its title to the Association of Professional, Executive, Clerical and Computer Staff (APEX) and they joined GMB in 1989.\n\nAPEX accepted the Transfer of Engagements of the Automobile Association Staff and the General Accident Staff. Since the amalgamation, the Greater London Staff Association, who earlier transferred to GMB, joined the APEX Partnership and the National Union of Labour Organisers and Legal Aid Staff Association also transferred to APEX.\n\nNUTGW the National Union of Tailors & Garment Workers joined the GMB in 1991.It is known that a union existed amongst London tailors as long ago as 1417 but records only date back to the 19th Century.\n\nAt the time of the merger in 1991, the NUTGW had over 70,000 members and was itself the result of many amalgamations.\n\nThese unions formed the United Garment Workers' Union in 1912.\n\nIn 1931 the unions formed the National Union of Tailors and Garment Workers and were joined by the United Ladies Tailors (London) and Waterproof Garment Workers' Union.\n\nFTAT the Furniture, Timber, and Allied Trades Union merged with the GMB in 1993. FTAT can trace its origin back to 1747 and the formation of the National Society of Brushmakers and General Workers. The Union can therefore lay claim to being the oldest in the world.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, three major unions existed in the furniture and upholstery trades: the Alliance Cabinet Makers, the United Operative Cabinet and Chairmakers' Society of Scotland and the Amalgamated Union of Upholsterers (AUU). A series of mergers culminated in the formation of the National Union of Furniture Trade Operatives (NUFTO) in 1947.\n\nIn 1971 NUFTO merged with the Amalgamated Society of Woodcutting Machinists to form FTAT.\n\nThe latest union to join the fold is the Managerial and Professional Officers a Local Government union comprising 8,000 principal officers and second tier officers. Altogether over 100 smaller unions have joined together to form the modern GMB - Britain's General Union."}, {"url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/gmb-union-tim-roache-investivation-misconduct-claims_uk_5ea9c570c5b63115cec2b923", "page_content": "PA\n\nOne of Britain\u2019s biggest trade unions has launched an investigation after its general secretary suddenly resigned amid allegations about his personal conduct.\n\nTim Roache, who has led the GMB union for the past five years, took sick leave on Monday and then abruptly quit on Tuesday night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 600,000-member union, whose donations and influence play a key role in Labour party politics, revealed that Roache had suffered from ME for years and decided he \u201cdoes not feel mentally or physically able to continue to lead our union.\u201d\n\nBut it also revealed the union had received an anonymous letter last week in which \u201ca number of allegations have been made about Tim\u2019s conduct whilst he held the office of general secretary\u201d.\n\n\u201cAn investigation has been launched and it is not appropriate to comment further pending the outcome of that investigation,\u201d the union said in a statement issued after an emergency meeting of its finance and general purposes committee.\n\n\u201cComplaints which are brought to our attention will be dealt with appropriately in line with our policies and procedures and with appropriate regard to fairness and sensitivity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWales and South West regional secretary John Phillips will become acting general secretary with immediate effect, until a permanent replacement is elected in due course.\n\nHowever, Roache\u2019s dramatic departure - just months after he was re-elected for a fresh term in office - has sparked a fresh bout of bitter internal warfare within the union movement and the Labour party.\n\nAllies of Lisa Johnson, the GMB\u2019s director of external relations, have told HuffPost UK that the anonymous letter sent to party president Barbara Plant last Wednesday appeared to be deliberately aimed at implicating her in the controversy.\n\nJohnson is seen as a lead contender to become Labour\u2019s next general secretary under Keir Starmer, should current party chief Jennie Formby step aside as expected in coming months.\n\nAlthough Johnson has worked closely with Roache throughout his tenure, it is understood that she had confronted the union boss about his conduct. \u201cLisa has acted with great courage, integrity and decency throughout this,\u201d one ally said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother figure in the labour movement said that it was no secret that Johnson had some critics both on the Left and among some centrists, but stressed she was respected by most union officials and many Labour MPs. Around 80 MPs are sponsored by the GMB.\n\nThe anonymous letter, which included misspellings of Labour party figures\u2019 names, made unspecified allegations about Roache without naming those who it claimed had suffered from his misconduct.\n\nThe claims included separate allegations of differing kinds of impropriety.\n\nNone of the allegations have ever been referred to the police or any other authorities external to the union.\n\nRoache has repeatedly strongly denied any wrongdoing when directly questioned about the claims. But it is understood that he agreed to step aside after discussions with senior figures within the union this week.\n\nJohnson is seen by some Labour MPs and other unions as responsible for directing the GMB\u2019s approach to votes on the party\u2019s ruling National Executive Committee (NEC), where it has two representatives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome members of the NEC believe the GMB has too frequently backed Len McCluskey\u2019s Unite in key votes.\n\nOne party source questioned why Roache would have pushed for another term, when the union decided to hold an early general secretary election last November, if he was too ill to remain in post.\n\nRoache upset some on the Left when his union backed Owen Smith\u2019s leadership campaign against Jeremy Corbyn in 2016. The union backed Lisa Nandy in the recent leadership election.\n\nThe Labour party staff branch of the GMB was highly critical of a recent leak of an internal report into anti-Semitism, demanding protection for those named within it.\n\nIn answer to claims that his union was targeting Formby, he tweeted this month: \u201cThe GMB is NOT going for Jennie.

Asked if the Labour leader views Roache as a \u2018friend\u2019, his spokesman said \u201cKeir and Tim are colleagues and have worked together.\n\n\u201cAnything further I will direct you to the GMB. Tim resigned yesterday, Keir has seen his statement.\u201d\n\nThe GMB said that Roache had been diagnosed with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (M.E.) some years ago \u201cwhich has previously resulted in two years\u2019 sickness absence from work\u201d.\n\n\u201cHaving been signed off by medical professionals earlier this week, Tim was advised to refrain completely from work \u2013 and has now taken the difficult decision to stand down from the role permanently, indicating that he does not feel mentally or physically able to continue to lead our union,\u201d it said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong the likely contenders to succeed Roache are union officials Gary Smith and Warren Kenny, both of whom are seen as very supportive of Starmer."}, {"url": "https://targetjobs.co.uk/careers-advice/job-descriptions/trade-union-official-job-description", "page_content": "Often, employees secure the role of trade union official after having worked as a trade union representative.\n\nWhat does a trade union official do? Qualifications and experience | Key skills | Typical employers\n\nTrade union officials work to represent union members and support them when discussing grievances or proposed changes with employers. They usually work at either a national or regional level.\n\nA trade union official working at a national level is likely to have the following responsibilities:\n\nrepresenting the membership during relevant industrial negotiations\n\ninforming members about important issues (such as the law on flexible working and overtime)\n\nbuilding the national policy of the trade union\n\nreaching agreements with employers\u2019 organisations, political parties and the government\n\ncommunicating with members to reach a decision or consensus (eg regarding which campaigns to focus on)\n\ndeveloping learning and training opportunities for local officials and trade union representatives\n\nhelping to ensure positive relationships with the media.\n\nAs a trade union official working at a regional level, you would likely have to do the following:\n\norganise recruitment of trade union representatives and local officials\n\nhelp to provide relevant training for local officials and representatives\n\novercome local disputes\n\ngive advice and information on legal or health and safety issues\n\nrepresent members in challenging situations.\n\nWhile you don\u2019t need any specific qualifications to become a trade union official, many in this role have a degree or professional qualification. If you decide to follow this route, you could study any subject, so it\u2019s a good idea to choose one you enjoy. However, a degree in law, politics or history may be beneficial by helping you to build skills in forming and articulating arguments.\n\nMany job descriptions include knowledge in certain areas as a requirement, such as an understanding of employment law or trade union organising. This is one area in which being a trade union representative (also known as \u2018shop steward\u2019) beforehand could demonstrate your ability. A trade union representative is an unpaid role undertaken while working for an employer. Shop stewards support their colleagues through tasks such as accompanying them in meetings with line managers to discuss requests for flexible working or helping to negotiate pay and conditions.

Jesse Cohn, who oversees the firm's activist investing unit, is known to be Paul Singer's attack dog; just last year he was looking to push out Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.\n\nElliott Management did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Employees' Retirement System of the State of Rhode Island's pension documents showed Elliott's performance compared to public-market investments as of March 31.

In many countries trade unionism is synonymous with the term labour movement. Smaller associations of workers started appearing in Britain in the 18th century, but they remained sporadic and short-lived through most of the 19th century, in part because of the hostility they encountered from employers and government groups that resented this new form of political and economic activism. At that time unions and unionists were regularly prosecuted under various restraint-of-trade and conspiracy statutes in both Britain and the United States.\n\nBritish unionism received its legal foundation in the Trade-Union Act of 1871. In the United States the same effect was achieved, albeit more slowly and uncertainly, by a series of court decisions that whittled away at the use of injunctions , conspiracy laws, and other devices against unions. In 1866 the formation of the National Labor Union (NLU) represented an early attempt to create a federation of American unions. Although the NLU disappeared in the 1870s, several of its member trade unions continued, representing such diverse occupations as shoemakers, spinners, coal miners, and railway workers. The founding of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) by several unions of skilled workers in 1886 marked the beginning of a continuous large-scale labour movement in the United States. Its member groups comprised national trade or craft unions that organized local unions and negotiated wages, hours, and working conditions.\n\nModern developments\n\nDuring the 20th century, craft unions lost ground to industrial unions. This shift was both historic and controversial because the earliest unions had developed in order to represent skilled workers. These groups believed that unskilled workers were unsuitable for union organization. In 1935, for example, the AFL opposed attempts to organize the unskilled and ultimately expelled a small group of member unions that were attempting to do so. The expelled unions formed the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), which by 1941 had assured the success of industrial unionism by organizing the steel and automobile industries. When the AFL and the CIO merged to form the AFL-CIO in 1955, they represented between them some 15 million workers. At the same time, mass unions began appearing in Britain and several European countries, and before the end of the century the industrial unions\u2014embracing large numbers of unskilled or semiskilled workers\u2014were recognized as powerful negotiating forces.\n\nThe strength of the labour movement at any given moment has been linked to general economic conditions. In times of full employment and rising wages, unionism typically loses some of its appeal, particularly among younger workers, while in recessionary times it becomes more attractive. By the end of the 20th century the globalization of the workforce had brought new challenges to the labour movement, effectively weakening collective bargaining in industries whose workers could be replaced by a cheaper labour force in a different part of the world.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Right-to-work laws, which had been adopted in more than half of U.S. states and the territory of Guam by the early 21st century, were promoted by economic libertarians, trade associations, and corporate-funded think tanks as necessary to protect the economic liberty and freedom of association of workers. They had the practical effect of weakening collective bargaining and limiting the political activities of unions by depriving them of funds. Certain other states adopted separate legislation to limit or prohibit collective bargaining or the right to strike by public-sector unions. In Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (2018), the U.S. Supreme Court held that public employees cannot be required to pay service fees to a union to support its collective-bargaining activities on their behalf."}, {"url": "https://nilgosc.org.uk/about-us/who-we-are/organisational-structure/pension-board/member-bios/", "page_content": "Mr Shane McCurdy\n\nCOMMITTEE MEMBER\n\nMr McCurdy is a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy.

Cllr Watson was first elected to the ward in September 1997 and continued to be successfully re-elected.\n\n\n\nHe took a major interest in the city's economic development as the City Council worked with regional, national and international organisations to attract investment and re-build the city's economy after devastating job losses in the 1980s and 1990s\n\n\n\nCllr Watson served as the council's Cabinet Member for Regeneration before becoming Deputy Leader and then Leader.\n\n\n\nAs Leader he was the council's chief political spokesman and a major figure in North East regional politics as well as holding national positions.\n\n\n\nHe was Chair of the Association of North East Councils, which represented all 12 North East region local authorities. In 2016 he became Chair of the North East Combined Authority (NECA) which is composed of Durham County Council, Gateshead Council, Newcastle City Council, Northumberland County Council, North Tyneside Council, South Tyneside Council, and Sunderland City Council.\n\n\n\nHe was also Deputy Chair of the North East Local Enterprise Partnership and a member of the Local Government Association Executive Board.\n\n\n\nIn 2013, Cllr Watson helped found the Key Cities Group, which now has a membership of 22 cross-party medium-sized UK cities. The group has been influencing Whitehall and Westminster decision-making for better and fairer deals for all parts of the UK and to widen the benefits of economic growth. He was chair of the group for four years.\n\n\n\nWithin the city, and aside from his duties as Leader of the council, he was Chair of the Port of Sunderland board, Chair of the Sunderland Economic Leadership Board, Chair of the Sunderland Health and Wellbeing Board, and a member of the Board of Sunderland Football Club Foundation.\n\n\n\nIn his time as council Leader, he oversaw the council taking ownership of the landmark Vaux site, which had been owned by Tesco for ten years, and in driving forward the city's regeneration and economic growth agenda.\n\n\n\nThis included working closely with major employers such as Nissan and taking a strategic lead on the \u00a3100m New Wear Crossing project. This new bridge and its approach roads, due for completion in 2018, is the first major road bridge over the River Wear in more than 40 years. It is currently the largest civil engineering project in the North East region.\n\n\n\nRecently, he had advocated that Nissan and its work force should receive the Freedom of the City.\n\n\n\nHe was also a proud advocate of the International Advanced Manufacturing Park (IAMP) project and joint venture with South Tyneside Council to attract 5,000 jobs and bring in more than \u00a3300m of private sector investment over the next ten years. The project has received Government funding as part of the Sunderland and South Tyneside City Deal and been designated a 'nationally significant' project.\n\n\n\nCllr Watson was Chair of the UK Delegation to the Committee of the Regions in Europe, and recognised the key role played by European Union funding in helping the North East to prosper both in terms of economic development and social improvements - between 2007 and 2014 the North East region received nearly \u00a3400m of EU funding.\n\n\n\nA staunch 'remainer', he had fears over what leaving the EU could mean for Sunderland as EU funding was withdrawn but replacements were not being confirmed from the UK Government.\n\n\n\nRecognising criticism and failure in the council's social services, he pushed for a reforming agenda that saw the creation of Together for Children Sunderland to oversee education, social services and all safeguarding in the city.\n\n\n\nHis council colleagues have paid tribute to him.\n\n\n\nDeputy Leader Councillor Harry Trueman said: \"Paul had many talents and among these were how, unlike some politicians, he could take a long-term view and see bigger and wider strategic points and issues.\n\n\n\n\"As a younger man he had known the difficult times that so many people had experienced in the 1970s and 1980s when he, like many thousands of others, had been made redundant from his job.\n\n\n\n\"Unemployment in Sunderland during the 1980s was very, very high and far, far higher in some wards and areas.\n\n\n\n\"He wanted to see Sunderland's economy grow, see more jobs created and see that people could fulfil more of their aspirations and have more choice. He, like many, could re-call when jobs, any jobs, were very, very scarce and when unemployment was far more common than now.\n\n\n\n\"We can never be complacent or stand still on these things and while Paul recognised that Sunderland's economy had re-invented itself, because all the jobs lost in shipbuilding and coalmining had been replaced, there was always more to do.\n\n\n\n\"Politically, there's no denying the Labour Party nationally has been through some interesting times. Yet during Paul's time as Leader of the council's Majority Labour group it saw its share of the council's 75 seats increased from 48 in 2010 to 67 seats in 2016.\"\n\n\n\nCabinet Secretary, Councillor Mel Speding said: \"Paul was a passionate champion for the people of Sunderland and the North East. As chairman of ANEC and latterly of NECA he fought hard to get the right deal for Sunderland and the wider region and was not prepared to make do with second best. He continued to fight hard for what he believed in to the very end.\"\n\n\n\nAs Deputy Leader, Councillor Trueman assumes council leadership responsibilities until further notice."}, {"url": "https://committees.sunderland.gov.uk/committees/cmis5/Members/tabid/62/ctl/ViewCMIS_Person/mid/600/id/1399/ScreenMode/Ward/Default.aspx", "page_content": "Biography:\n\nInitially born in Southwick I was educated at St. Thomas Aquinas and later St. Aidan's Schools before going to University where I received a BA (Hons) degree in Public Administration.

Leader of the City Council from 2008 to 2017 before he lost his battle with bowel cancer, Watson\u2019s legacy ruling the city is probably one of the most hotly contested and debated matters of recent times, even one which was lampooned by the Private Eye Magazine in 2012. Was he a hero? Or was he a villain? You\u2019ll find voices for both. Here we dive into the life and legacy of this former politician, who gained a road named after him running up to the Northern Spire Bridge, also covering of course the infamous \u201cincident\u201d which his name would be associated with.\n\nA Pennywell Lad\n\nDespite what you think of him, it cannot be denied that Paul Watson stemmed from humble origins. He was born on Pennywell in 1954, and he\u2019d root himself to that area for most of his adult life having lived out his final years in neighbouring South Hylton. Growing up in the 1960s and 70s, it was customary of course for Watson to take the path of the \u201cworking man\u201d and he became a shipwright in Pallion. Of course early into his career the city would face a tumulus decline of its industry and by 1981 by the time he was only 27 years old, Watson found himself out of a job and posed to reinvent his life. He later took up owning a bar, before deciding to pursue further education and studying Law at Teesside University.\n\n\u201cThe Incident\u201c\n\nThe club Watson came to run was known as the Ford and Hylton lane club. It was in 1993 that Watson received a tip off that the premises were to be burgled. According to Private Eye magazine \u201che armed himself with two knives, then he and two accomplices lay in wait\u201d. Three burglars did indeed attack the property. One died with a knife wound to the heart, but what happened remains unclear. Watson and the two others were charged for murder, but were subsequently acquitted when the prosecution witnesses changed their stories, meaning nothing could be proven. Watson would later describe the ordeal as a horrible moment in his life. It has been a frequent avenue of attack against him by his critics, but as the facts are not clear one cannot jump to conclusions.\n\nPolitical Career\n\nFour years after the social club incident, Paul Watson commenced his political career in the Labour Party becoming elected councillor for Pallion ward in 1997, a nod to his former shipbuilding career. It would be in 2008 that he would become the leader of Sunderland City Council and serve his 9 year tenure. His rule over the city was objectively a time of frustration for Sunderland precisely because the great recession undermined investment, seen many development projects get scrapped and intensified widespread political disillusionment of which he became the target of.\n\nSupporters of Watson argue that he helped spearhead the city\u2019s regeneration, and argue that he \u201cstood up\u201d for wearside in resisting the North East combined authority. Things completed under his tenure included the redevelopment of Sunniside, the Northern Spire Bridge and Keel Square. The first one never lived up to its potential however. Supporters also like to give him credit for helping wrestle Tesco away from the Vaux site, even if he did not live to see development there commence. It can be argued Graeme Miller \u201creaped\u201d a lot of the groundwork he laid.\n\nStill, a lot of Watson\u2019s changes to Sunderland otherwise were arguably \u201ccosmetic\u201d- illustrating how difficult it was to transform the area\u2019s fortunes or to uplift everything. Few would argue that despite things here and there, that the city changed dramatically or \u201cfor the better\u201d during his tenure. He was not a miracle maker and nor was his rule particularly radical or revolutionary.\n\nCronyism?\n\nOn the other hand, Watson\u2019s tenure was also lampooned for his perceived cronyism, that is giving positions and roles to those who were his close friends, connections and family. Again this behaviour was covered by the satirical magazine Private Eye, who note that he ensured both his wife Susan Watson, his sister Celia Gofton and his former barmaid Amy Wilson were all elected as councillors, and were all subsequently appointed to the local police and crime panel! This has added a wider atmosphere of accusations against the council in general by Sunderland residence amidst deep political disillusionment, a sentiment which has accelerated a decline in the Labour Party\u2019s vote share.\n\nConclusions\n\nOn November 7th 2017 Paul succumbed to the horrific experience of Bowel Cancer and died at his home in South Hylton next to the banks of the River which he had built his life around. His funeral was held at St. Bennet\u2019s R C Church in Monkwearmouth. His passing seen him receive widespread tributes from fellow politicians in the Labour Party who expressed belief he had helped transform the city\u2019s fortunes, but at the same time a lot of sour grapes from portions of Sunderland\u2019s residents, who were less impressed.\n\nA neutral view of his life one source told us that Watson was \u201cincompetent\u201d but \u201cmeant well\u201d for the city and it is true to say that to turn Sunderland around is a challenging job and that what you have \u201cto work with\u201d is little. His critics will argue he effectively turned the council into his own \u201csocial club\u201d so to speak, a chummy coalition of his friends, family and acquittances. But it should not be overlooked that Paul Watson for most part an ordinary man, from a humble background, attempting to run a city. He was of course not perfect, but perhaps far from the bogeyman some say he is too.\n\nSo this leaves it to you, was he a Sunderland hero or a villain? And with his name now immortalized in a Pallion road, how will history judge him?"}, {"url": "https://committees.sunderland.gov.uk/committees/cmis5/Search/Searchforyourcouncillorward.aspx", "page_content": "Enter your postcode below to search for your ward and currently elected councillors.

elections but the winning candidates are indicated in bold below. Full results by ward including how every candidate scored are here.\n\nWearside is likely once again to come under national scrutiny as commentators watch to see if the impact of recent scandals in the Conservative government will slow the steady loss of Labour seats in the city over recent years.\n\nYou can see the full results from election night here.\n\nHow many councillors are standing in the 2022 local election?\n\nThere were 25 seats on the council being contested, a third of the total. The city is made up of 25 wards with three seats each, and Sunderland goes to the polls three years out of every four, with one of the three councillors of each ward facing election (plus any vacant seats). However, this year, due to the death of candidate Reg Coulson, the Copt Hill vote will not go ahead as expected.\n\nWho currently controls the council?\n\nThe Labour Party has controlled Sunderland City Council since it was formed in 1974. However, in recent years the party's hold on the city has loosened. A loss of 10 seats in 2019 and another nine in 2021 reduced the party's overall majority significantly, now holding on to the lead by only six seats.\n\nNonetheless, they remain by far the largest party, holding 43 out of 75 seats. The Conservatives are the second-largest party with 19 seats, while the Liberal Democrats have 12. The Green Party lost its single seat to the Conservatives in 2021.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the UKIP vote in the city, last year Sunderland's three UKIP councillors quit the party, leaving it no longer a force on the council. Ryhope councillor Steven Bewick became an independent, while St Ann's councillor Pam Mann joined the Conservatives. Redhill's Keith Jenkins stood down and was replaced in March this year by Labour's John Usher.\n\n(Image: Copyright Unknown)\n\nWho is the current council leader?\n\nThe council has been led by Graeme Miller, of Washington South Ward, since 2018.\n\nWhat are the key seats and big issues?\n\nOne important seat to watch will be that of the leader, Coun Miller. In last year's elections one of the seats in Washington South, the leader's ward, fell to the Conservative Party and it's likely that's one area where they'll concentrate their efforts in a bid to oust him.\n\nOn a city-wide level, Sunderland is likely, once again, to become a focus of national interest. Ever since the city became the predictor of the national Brexit vote in 2016, it's come to be seen as something of a political weathervane - although unlike parts of County Durham and Northumberland, the city didn't gain Tory MPs amid the 2019 fall of the 'Red Wall'.\n\nIt's now being touted in the national press as a potential bombshell for Labour, with Sunderland Conservative leader Antony Mullen suggesting the party could lose overall control of the authority. Having lost nine and 10 seats in the previous local council elections, a similar loss would put the party out of control.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting a significant difference in the polls between this year and last. On May 6 2021, Labour trailed, with one poll predicting a 34% vote share to the Tories 43%. At time of writing, the positions had almost reversed, 40% to Labour and 35% to the ruling party.\n\nWhatever happens, it's likely to be a close-fought battle, and with Sunderland famed for declaring results early, could set the tone for the rest of election night.\n\nWhen is the deadline for registering to vote?\n\nThe last date to register to vote is Thursday, April 14, at midnight. Postal vote applications must be received by Tuesday, April 19, at 5pm. Proxy vote applications must be received by Tuesday, April 26, at 5pm.\n\nFull results of Sunderland's 2022 local elections:\n\nBarnes - Conservative HOLD\n\nTim Ellis (Liberal Democrat) - 264\n\nRachel Sara Featherstone (Green) - 212\n\nAbul Bakkar Ehthesham Haque (Labour) - 1,329\n\nAntony Mullen (Conservative) - 1,637\n\nCastle - Labour HOLD\n\nPaul James Anthony Burke (Conservative) - 505\n\nAllison Chisnall (Labour) - 1,308\n\nAlison Margaret Ogle (Green) 223\n\nDoxford - Liberal Democrat GAIN from Labour\n\nRichard Peter Bradley (Green) - 115\n\nAllen Curtis (Liberal Democrat) - 1,511\n\nTom Cuthbertson (Conservative) - 565\n\nSteven Hanson (Labour) - 851\n\nFulwell - Liberal Democrat GAIN\n\nMalcolm John Bond (Liberal Democrat) - 2,193\n\nSandra Boyers (Conservative) - 1,254\n\nLiam Dufferwiel (Green) - 93\n\nIain William Kay (Labour) - 648\n\nHendon - Labour HOLD\n\nSyed Ajmol Ali (Conservative) - 281\n\nHelmut Izaks (Green) - 104\n\nTom Livingstone (Liberal Democrat) - 909\n\nDale Michael Mordey (Labour) - 1087\n\nHetton - Labour HOLD\n\nAdelle Burnicle (Conservative) - 339\n\nDavid William Geddis (Independent) - 991\n\nJohn Anthony Lennox (Liberal Democrat) - 168\n\nClaire Marilyn Rowntree (Labour) - 1,230\n\nHoughton - Labour HOLD\n\nMark Burrell (Labour) - 1,655\n\nCraig Morrison (Conservative) - 681\n\nEmma Robson (Green) - 169\n\nDonna Sarah Thomas (Independent) - 466\n\nMillfield - Liberal Democrat HOLD\n\nGwennyth Gibson (Conservative) - 250\n\nGary Ogle (Green) - 64\n\nKingsley Osahon Okojie (Labour Party) - 923\n\nJulio Romero Johnson (Communist Party of Britain) - 30\n\nAndrew Michael Wood (Liberal Democrat) - 1,227\n\nPallion - Liberal Democrat HOLD\n\nDorothy Lynch (Green) -79\n\nKaren Patricia Noble (Labour) - 723\n\nJudith Ann Porter (Conservative) - 266\n\nGeorge Thomas Smith (Liberal Democrat) - 1,227\n\nRedhill - Labour HOLD\n\nSteven Boyd Donkin (Liberal Democrat) - 411\n\nBilly Scott Howells (Green) - 89\n\nSue Leishman (Conservative) - 326\n\nPaul Stewart (Labour) - 1,065\n\nRyhope - Labour HOLD\n\nMartyn Preston Herron (Labour) - 1,311\n\nKevin Leonard (Conservative) - 1,283\n\nRobert Welsh (Green) - 277\n\nSandhill - Liberal Democrat HOLD\n\nMargaret Gillian Crosby (Liberal Democrat) - 1,274\n\nLaura Ann Hind (Green) - 71\n\nChristine Mary Reed (Conservative) - 249\n\nDebra Waller (Labour) - 800\n\nShiney Row - Labour HOLD\n\nMichael Anthony Kennedy (Freedom Alliance) - 120\n\nThomas Alexander Mower (Green) - 345\n\nMel Speding (Labour) - 1,658\n\nRichard Steven Vardy (Conservative) - 882\n\nSilksworth - Labour HOLD\n\nChristopher Crozier (Green) - 337\n\nJack Paul Simm (Conservative) - 923\n\nPhil Tye (Labour) - 1,618\n\nSouthwick - Labour HOLD\n\nAlex Samuels (Labour) - 1,309\n\nMorgan Joseph Seed (Green) - 280\n\nJohn Scott Wiper (Conservative) - 623\n\nSt Anne's - Labour HOLD\n\nBryan George Foster (Conservative) - 840\n\nRaymond John Moore (Green) - 273\n\nSusan Watson (Labour) - 1,061\n\nSt Chad's - Conservative HOLD\n\nSimon John Ayre (Conservative) - 1,453\n\nAlyson Kordbarlag (Green) - 114\n\nMartin Old (Labour) 977\n\nAnthony Usher (Liberal Democrat) - 145\n\nSt Michael's - Conservative HOLD\n\nJohn Leonard Appleton (Green) - 231\n\nMichael Dixon (Conservative) - 1,832\n\nChris Smith (Labour) - 1,201\n\nColin Andrew Wilson (Liberal Democrat) - 139\n\nSt Peter's - Conservative HOLD\n\nAuburn Langley (Green) - 250\n\nTom Newton (Labour) - 1,068\n\nLynn Vera (Conservative) - 1,567\n\nPeter Arnold Walton (Liberal Democrat) - 280\n\nWashington Central - Labour HOLD\n\nEmma Cutting (Green) - 267\n\nDerek Dunn (Conservative) - 883\n\nLinda Williams (Labour Party) -1,683\n\nWashington East - Labour HOLD\n\nMichal Chantkowshi (Green) - 239\n\nChris Eynon (Conservative) - 883\n\nLogan Guy (Labour) - 1,683\n\nWashington North - Labour HOLD\n\nScott Andrew Burrows (Green) - 298\n\nJill Elaine Fletcher (Labour) - 1,349\n\nHilary Johnson (Conservative) - 552\n\nWashington South - Labour HOLD\n\nGraeme Ferguson Miller (Labour) - 1,454\n\nPeter James Noble (Conservative) - 1,310\n\nSean Terry (Liberal Democrat) - 303\n\nWashington West - Labour HOLD\n\nSam Cosgrove (Conservative) - 878\n\nPaul Andrew Leonard (Green) - 280\n\nDorothy Trueman (Labour Party) - 1,641"}]}
