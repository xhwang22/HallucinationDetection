There are also some Clapps who appear in the annals of our hobby here and there, but of which we know relatively little. In this category of obscurity we have the Clapp of Clapp, Fuller & Browne\u2019s Bank Note Reporter and Counterfeit Detecter, a \u201cdetecter\u201d of questionable bank notes, who seems to have been located in Buffalo, New York. We also mention the unknown D.C. Clapp, who in the 1890s sold coins to the well-known John M. Clapp.\n\nJohn M. Clapp\n\nJohn Martin Clapp was born in Mercer, Pennsylvania, in 1835, one of six children of Rev. Ralph and Sally (Hubbard) Clapp. Apparently, spreading The Word among the flock did not pay all of Rev. Ralph\u2019s bills, for he was also the proprietor of a general store in President Township, in Pennsylvania, where young John M. helped with duties, no doubt seeing many large copper cents in daily trade, and whatever else came across the counter. The family was also involved in the building of the President blast furnace in 1854-1855, located about a mile from where Hemlock Creek joined the Allegheny River. During this era, central Pennsylvania was dotted with such furnaces, typically tall structures made of limestone, which were used for the smelting of iron ore. Some still stand today and are interesting to view. (Here in our own New Hampshire, there is but one remaining, the Franconia Iron Furnace.) In 1860, John M. Clapp purchased much of his father\u2019s property. In the meantime, in 1858, Col. Drake had discovered oil in Titusville, setting of a great speculative flurry.\n\nIn 1862, Clapp recruited a company for the Army and went into service as a captain in Col. Chapman Biddle\u2019s 121st Pennsylvania Volunteers. In August 1863 he was discharged under a certificate of disability, and returned home. In 1865 he took Anna M. Pearson, of New Castle, Pennsylvania, as his wife. The union produced four children, the most important of whom (for purposes of this article) was John H., born on April 16, 1880.\n\nIn the 1860s, John M. Clapp was in the right place at the right time. By poking around here and there on his thousands of acres in President Township, he found a lot of oil, leading to a fortune, and more. In time he also became involved in the flour milling and trading business. By the 1890s he had addresses in Tidioute and Knox, Pennsylvania, and in Washington, D.C., where in the latter place he was involved with banking. In Lakewood, New York, the family had a summer home.\n\nSomewhere, somehow he became a coin collector, and by the late 1880s was quite serious about it. Circa 1893, perhaps inspired by Augustus G. Heaton\u2019s Treatise on Mint Marks published that year, he began ordering coins directly from the branch mints, perhaps the only numismatist of the mid-1890s to order half eagles, eagles, and double eagles in this manner, although a fellow Washingtonian, Charles Deetz, may have done this (of Deetz we know relatively little, except that he was an early collector of high denomination mintmarked coins, an elite niche in the hobby).\n\nClapp bought widely, had a sharp eye for quality, and was a bidder in most of the important auction sales of the 1890s and early 1900s, until his passing on October 24, 1906, at his summer home. His rare coin collection, containing most of the great American rarities plus many mintmarks (a specialty that was still up-and-coming), passed to his son, John H. Clapp.\n\nJohn H., born on April 16, 1880, graduated from Princeton in 1902, that university having its own numismatic tradition by that time (T. Harrison Garrett and his three sons all went there). He made Washington his residence, where he engaged in law and banking, increasing the family fortune in the meanwhile. On October 1, 1908, he was elected as a governor of the American Numismatic Association, but neither he nor his father were flag-wavers at the Association, and there is not much of a record of their accomplishments.\n\nAlthough John H. added to his inherited collection of United States coins, he sought his own specialty, and that was the vast and largely numismatically explored area of Central and South American gold coins. He bought with care, and was ready with check in hand in the 1930s when many important pieces from the Waldo C. Newcomer Collection became available. Clapp, who never married and who resided at The Ontario in Washington, died on June 29, 1940. His estate collection was later purchased by Louis E. Eliasberg in 1942, through Stack\u2019s, for the incredible price of $100,000 (exceeding by far the total realization of B. Max Mehl\u2019s Dunham Collection sale, June 1941, the capstone of Mehl\u2019s career).\n\nIn 1982 and again in 1996 and 1997 I had the pleasure of cataloguing much of the Eliasberg Collection (which included many of the Clapp family coins) for auction, an unforgettable experience.\n\nGeorge H. Clapp\n\nGeorge Hubbard Clapp, also a Pennsylvanian, was born on December 14, 1858, in the year of the great \u201coil rush\u201d in that state. He was bitten by the coin bug at an early age. On June 4, 1878, he was a founder of the Western Pennsylvania Numismatic Society. As years went on he added to his cabinet, and also did a few other things, such as founding and becoming president of the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa).\n\nSometime along the way he became enamored of early copper cents of the 1793-1814 years, perhaps before the early 1920s, but certainly by the time of a transaction he had with his brother Charles, a stockbroker. Charles was also an active numismatist and an important buyer at auctions. He had the opportunity to buy the Ellsworth cabinet of copper cents intact, and did. Ellsworth, who formed one of the largest collections in American numismatic history, is not particularly well known today, for, similar to Waldo C. Newcomer, his holdings were sold privately and no catalogue was ever published. The main part of the Ellsworth Collection was sold on March 7, 1923, through art dealers Knoedler & Co., to New York dealer Wayte Raymond, for $100,000, a sum even more impressive then than the same amount would be in 1942 in the above-noted transfer of another collection. Ellsworth was a member of the board of governors of the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition, 1892-1893, and was on hand at the Philadelphia Mint in 1892 when the first commemorative Columbian Exposition half dollars were struck.\n\nHowever, in 1923, apparently soon after tucking away the Ellsworth cents, Charles Clapp had severe financial difficulties and sold his coin collection to brother George. After this time the copper-cent affliction attacked George in its most virulent form. His passion for cents extended to the careful study of varieties (such the 64-page monograph, The United States Cents of the Years 1798-1799, published in 1931), leading to his publication of several works on the series.\n\nIn 1937 he announced he would eventually donate the coins to the American Numismatic Society, which he did years later in 1946-1947. As to his collecting methods we know little, except that some owners of cents were reluctant to sell to him, perhaps fearful that they would be forever impounded in a museum. Whatever the obstacles and challenges may have been, he was able to acquire 324 of the 327 die varieties of 1793-1814 cents then known to exist. Likely, Clapp\u2019s study of coins and his enthusiastic acquisition of them served as the inspiration for Dr. William H. Sheldon to take from and improve various specialized studies to create Early American Cents, 1949, complete with \u201cSheldon numbers\u201d for cents and that marvelous Sheldon Grading System, 1 to 70, that some of us love dearly even today.\n\nSomehow, after Clapp\u2019s death, certain of his prizes landed in the personal collection of Dr. Sheldon, prompting the Society to cry, \u201cFoul!\u201d when they learned of what was whispered by some to have been outright theft. It seems that Sheldon stored his collection at the Society, and a few of the Clapp cents developed wings or legs and moved from the Clapp collection to his. Or, there may be another explanation. The whole matter has been kept under wraps, more or less, but a number of Clapp\u2019s cents, sold from the Sheldon Collection into the general marketplace, have been repatriated. In the meantime, the idol of Sheldon is now considered to have clay feet.\n\nThe Clapp home was in Sewickley, Pennsylvania, a town which even today reflects the grandeur of generations ago when it was home to the mansion-ensconced members of the Pittsburgh business and social community. On August 27, 1935, members of the American Numismatic Association, in convention in Pittsburgh, were invited to stop by for a visit to the Clapp home, \u201ca magnificent one,\u201d to be followed by dinner at the local country club.\n\nGeorge H. Clapp died on March 31, 1949. His obituary in The Numismatist included this:\n\nClapp, who was one of Pittsburgh\u2019s most prominent industrialists and citizens, was especially well known in the field of early coppers, which specialty he began by obtaining permission from the keeper of a toll bridge to examine coins in his till for anything unusual. The collection of large cents which he built comes about as near to perfection as is ever permitted to human endeavor. Not only did he achieve completeness in scope, but to this were added the superlatives in quality and condition. His willingness to share the pleasure he had found as is characteristic, and was expressed by him at the time his large cents were deeded to the American Numismatic Society in order that, in that museum, they might be where \u2018anyone may consult them;\u2019 they are now among the society\u2019s \u201ccrown jewels.\u201d\n\nJames Ford Clapp, Jr. and III\n\nThere were numismatic Clapps outside of Pennsylvania, and among them were James Ford Clapp, Jr., and his son, James F. III, of Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nJames Jr. is prominent in the annals of the hobby for his accomplishments in the 1940s and 1950s, when he was a leading light in the Boston area. In 1953 the American Numismatic Association came up with the idea of creating a reference or primer on coin collecting, and Clapp was named to the Text Book Committee. Similar to quite a few related ANA book-creation projects, this one died before it was born. However, Clapp did many other things, and in August 1960 was general chairman of the ANA Convention held at the Copley Plaza Hotel in Boston. This was the very first convention in the \u201cnew market\u201d that arose in that year, and, accordingly, was the most dynamic up to that time.\n\nHis numismatic successor was his son, James Ford Clapp III, who collected coins for a half century and who served as president of the Boston Numismatic Society and the New England Numismatic Association. In 1989 he picked up stakes and headed west. He died in Tempe, Arizona, on January 22, 1998. The last time I saw James III was one rainy night in Cambridge years ago, when we had both left an event at Harvard and were walking down Mt. Auburn Street. We discussed coins of ancient Greece, of which Ford knew much and I knew only a little."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/george.clapp/2302796", "page_content": "George Clapp\n\nZoologist\n\nDecember 14, 1858 (age 90) Allegheny City, Pennsylvania , United States\n\nClapp took an engineering position at Park Brothers\" Black Diamond Steel Works.

He was born on Aug. 9, 1937 in Bronxville, to the late Christopher and George-Ann Lawrence.\n\nAs a boy, he grew up in Bronxville, New York City and Long Island. He spent many happy times learning to fish and hunt at the Adirondack League Club. His heritage in the Northeast was esteemed. His maternal great-grandfather, George Hubbard Clapp, who lived in Pittsburgh, was instrumental in the development of the commercial uses of aluminum. His paternal great-grandfather, William Van Duzer Lawrence (the founder of Lawrence Properties,) led the development of Bronxville, turning it into the affluent community that it is today and established Sarah Lawrence College in honor of his late wife.\n\nGeorge Lawrence, assisted by Jacques Mitchell, later merged Lawrence Properties operations with Art Houlihan to create real estate brokerage firm Houlihan Lawrence. In 1990, Lawrence sold his family\u2019s real estate firm to Nancy and Peter Seaman.\n\nAfter graduating from St. Paul\u2019s School, he attended Columbia College. During his tenure at Columbia, he was a member of St. Anthony Hall. He left college in 1958 to enlist in the United States Army and served in Germany. His strong beliefs in the importance of a liberal arts education motivated his return to school. He graduated from Pace University in Westchester County.\n\nAfter his Army career, George returned to New York City and worked on Wall Street before joining the family business, Lawrence Properties in Bronxville, where he earned his position of President and Chief Executive Officer. He was a former Chairman of Sarah Lawrence College and in 1988 until his death, he served on the Board of Urstadt Biddle Properties, Inc. He also served on the Board of Directors with Cotton Petroleum. The Lawrence Family was instrumental in the development of Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla. George continued his family\u2019s legacy with Kensico Cemetery by serving as Chairman of the Board from 2007 to 2013. He also served on the Board of Governors for Lawrence Hospital from 1979-1992.\n\nGeorge had deep love and pride for his country and became involved with The Fund for American Studies, formerly the Charles Edison Memorial Youth Foundation in Washington, D.C. He served as its President from 1971 to 1974 and continued to serve as a Trustee Emeritus until his death. He supported the fund\u2019s guiding principles of limited government, free market economics, and honorable leadership, and believed strongly in educating young people with these same guiding principles.\n\nGeorge also served his country by working as an advance man on Richard Nixon\u2019s 1968 Presidential campaign and on Jim Buckley\u2019s 1970 Senate campaign. He served several terms on the National Advisory Council to the Small Business Administration (SBA).\n\nAfter moving to Vero Beach, in 1989, he served as a member of the City of Vero Beach Vision Committee and the Planning and Zoning Commission for Indian River County. He was elected to serve on the Indian River County Hospital District Board from 2001-2008 and was Board Chairman from 2002-2003. He was a dedicated supporter of the Indian River Memorial Hospital Foundation, now the Cleveland Clinic-Indian River Hospital Foundation. He also served on several Advisory Boards for Senior Resource Association of Indian River County.\n\nHunting, fishing, golf and travel were his life-long hobbies. He was a member of sporting and golf clubs around the world. In Vero Beach, he was a member of the Riomar Country Club and The Quail Valley Club. In New York, he remained a member of the Links Club and the Saint Nicholas Society of the City of New York. He was also a member of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts, by right of descent.\n\nWhile he believed deeply in honoring his heritage, he was a firm believer in supporting future generations to grow their legacy by mentoring and guiding them around his principles of hard work, devotion to God, family and self, and sacrifice of self for family, community and country. He was considered a mentor by many individuals and is remembered fondly for the guidance and shared experiences he imparted to them. His strong faith, integrity, honor and valor made him admired, cherished and loved by all who were fortunate to know him.\n\nHe is survived by his loving wife of 30 years, Pud (Margaret); his sons: Chris Lawrence, Bill Lawrence and his wife Kristen; Stepsons: Clif Dameron and his wife Jesse, Derrick Dameron and his wife Sara; Five grandchildren: Olivia Dameron, Ry Dameron, Grant Dameron, Anna Lawrence, Suzy Lawrence; and many beloved cousins.\n\nServices will be held on Friday, June 28, 2019 at 10:30 a.m. in the morning at St. Marks Anglican Church located at 1795 45th Street, Vero Beach, FL.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please send contributions to: Senior Resource Association, 694 14th Street Vero Beach, FL 32960; The Cleveland Clinic- Indian River Foundation, 1000 36th Street Vero Beach, FL 32960 or The Fund for American Studies, 1706 New Hampshire Ave NW Washington, D.C. 20009."}, {"url": "http://www.infogalactic.com/info/George_Hubbard_Clapp", "page_content": "From Infogalactic: the planetary knowledge core\n\nGeorge Hubbard Clapp (1858\u20131949) was an American pioneer in the aluminum industry and also a numismatist.\n\nHe was born on December 14 in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania, now a part of Pittsburgh, the son of Delia Dennig Hubbard and DeWitt Clinton Clapp, an iron company executive.
