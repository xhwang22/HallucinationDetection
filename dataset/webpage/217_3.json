In this pathway, residents are eligible to be board certified after 21 months of research and 27 months of clinical training. The traditional pathway requires 48 total months of residency in radiation oncology with a minimum of 36 months in clinical radiation oncology. The Holman Pathway is primarily designed for residents with an MD/PhD, or with an MD with a strong research background and who have excellent clinical skills such that clinical competence can be achieved in this abbreviated time period. Prospective candidates should have a documented history of research, i.e., a specific research plan with a suitable research mentor and environment. More information, including application requirements, is available on the American Board of Radiology website at www.theabr.org.\n\nIn response to inquiries in 2004 from the Association of Directors of Radiation Oncology Programs (ADROP), the Review Committee compiled a consensus summary regarding the Holman Pathway in 2005, an updated summary of which is presented below. The information is also included as part of the Review Committee's Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).\n\nResident Complement\n\nThe Review Committee believes that Holman Pathway residents should be included in the program's approved complement of residents throughout their four-year programs, during both clinical and laboratory educational experiences. The Review Committee has acknowledged that some programs, depending on their structure and schedule, may have difficulty in maintaining an appropriate clinical training program for the remainder of the residents during a portion of the time a Holman Pathway resident is in the laboratory. If the program director determines it is in the best interest of the program to increase the resident complement during this time, the program director may request a temporary increase in the resident complement from the Review Committee. In this situation, the program director should follow the usual procedures for requesting a temporary increase\u2014providing the Review Committee with a written request (via the Accreditation Data System (ADS)), justification, and necessary medical data as specified. This information should be submitted at least six months in advance of the anticipated increase. As with other temporary increases, the period of time should not exceed two years. It is the responsibility of the program director to state the length of time for the increase, and to outline a plan for returning to the original approved complement. Such requests must be endorsed by the designated institutional official (DIO) of the program\u2019s Sponsoring Institution prior to submission.\n\nProcedure and Case Load Requirements\n\nFor the traditional resident, the Program Requirements for Radiation Oncology currently in effect mandate a maximum of 250 cases per year for each resident, with a total minimum of 450 external beam cases simulated over four years of the educational program. The minimum number of intracavitary cases required is 15, to be performed over the four years of the program. The minimum number of interstitial cases is five, performed over the four years of the program. The resident must treat at least 12 pediatric cases. Each resident must participate in a minimum of six cases of radiopharmaceuticals, radioimmunotherapy, or unsealed sources over the four years of the program, a minimum of 20 cases of intracranial stereotactic radiosurgery, and at least 10 cases of stereotactic body radiation therapy to the liver, lung, spine, or other extracranial sites.\n\nThe Committee believes that all residents, including Holman Pathway residents, should be required to meet the minimum numbers of specified procedures (interstitial, intracavitary, stereotactic radiosurgery and stereotactic body radiotherapy, unsealed sources, and pediatric cases).\n\nFor external beam cases over the course of the 27 months of clinical training, the Committee has modified the minimum total number for Holman Pathway residents to 350, with the same annual maximum of 250 cases."}, {"url": "https://www.york.ac.uk/chemistry/staff/academic/emeritus/jholman/", "page_content": "Professor Sir John Holman\n\njohn.holman@york.ac.uk\n\nScience Education\n\nPresident, Royal Society of Chemistry, 2016-18.

Word Count: 969\n\nSquabble, and Other Stories is the first collection of John Holman\u2019s short fiction. The title story is about a young professor who loses his teaching job because of budget cutbacks and ends up tending bar at a dive where customers have to be searched for weapons before being allowed to enter. He meets an assortment of unusual characters, including a vivacious young woman with whom he contemplates having a love affair. The point of the story seems to be that upward mobility for African Americans is fraught with danger.\n\nIn \u201cPeso Street,\u201d another young intellectual type is thrown in with a group of unusual characters at a house party. Some of the characters seem to have underworld connections. They talk about a recent funeral that degenerated into a brawl. The very pointlessness of the story seems to underline the alienation of the characters involved.\n\nIn \u201cPresence,\u201d two young black friends are working on a car at their apartment complex. A young white truck driver tries to make friends with them by bringing a six-pack of beer. He tells them a story of a violent family feud. The two friends feel uncomfortable with his \u201cpresence\u201d and obviously wish he would go away. The story symbolizes the difficulties blacks and whites have relating to one another, even when they have the best intentions.\n\nIn \u201cI and I,\u201d three young men are delivering cocaine to various dealers in the state of Mississippi. They stay high on alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine. They pick up a couple of young local women and stage an impromptu party in a deserted house. All three men seem to realize that they are trapped in a trade that will inevitably lead to prison or death. The story reflects the fatalism of many modern African American men.\n\n\u201cOn Earth\u201d is the story of a sensitive young man who leaves home because he realizes that his parents have gotten old, and he cannot bear to see them die. He ends up going to college in another city and renting a furnished room from a tough-minded landlady who shares the house with her daughter and young grandson. The young hero becomes a part of this family, but his landlady suddenly dies of a stroke and he realizes that he will soon have to move on again. The story illustrates the omnipresence of death and suffering \u201con earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cScuff\u201d is one of Holman\u2019s stories that contrast upwardly mobile African Americans with African Americans who seem doomed to remain ignorant, impoverished, and confined to the ghetto. Sarah, a smart, ambitious young professional, is saddled with an irresponsible younger brother who camps in her apartment, eats all of her food, breaks her possessions, and refuses to look for a job. In the meantime, she is carrying on a hopeless affair with her boss, who is married.\n\nIn \u201cThe Story of Art History,\u201d a young college professor visits a shopping mall and is accused of stealing some junk jewelry. Even though a body search proves that he is innocent, he is asked to leave the mall. This is the only overt incident of racial discrimination in Holman\u2019s stories. The young professor goes to visit some friends and dances with a pretty coed who is majoring in art history, but his whole day has been darkened by his humiliating experience.\n\n\u201cYard Lights, Water, and Wink\u201d is an impressionistic story about the long-term relationship between a young woman and an old man. His renegade attitude toward life has inspired her to retain her individuality as she is exposed to the homogenizing influence of higher education. The story symbolizes the relationship between modern African Americans and their indomitable ancestors who survived slavery, poverty, and repression to make a better life possible for future generations.\n\n\u201cI Did That\u201d is composed of six very brief memoirs of a man\u2019s childhood. He seems to have been exceptionally sensitive, lonely, and in need of love. The six episodes convey an expressionistic picture of the segregated neighborhood in which he grew up and the type of people who lived there.\n\n\u201cPimp\u201d is another story that contrasts an upwardly mobile African American with one who seems doomed to failure because of race and environment. A young woman who is headed for college meets a former childhood sweetheart after he has been away for six years. He drags her into an unsavory adventure that makes her painfully aware of how incompatible they have become.\n\n\u201cMonroe\u2019s Wedding\u201d is yet another story that contrasts middle-class and lower-class African Americans. A middle-aged, divorced, lonely college graduate who is building a profitable gardening business is coerced by an improvident employee to be the best man at the employee\u2019s upcoming wedding. While shopping for a wedding gift, the best man impulsively invites an attractive white saleswoman to attend the wedding with him. She seems tempted to accept but then declines. He thinks about her afterward, wishing he could get to know her better and realizing that her feelings were similar to his. The story symbolizes the evolving relations between blacks and whites in the South.\n\nAll of Holman\u2019s stories belong unmistakably to the minimalist school. The common denominator of minimalist fiction is that it puts the reader in the position of being a combination of voyeur and eavesdropper. The relation of the reader to the story is similar to that of the viewer to many French \u201cNew Wave\u201d films. No effort is made to orient the reader or viewer regarding the background to the story. The reader of a minimalist story is forced to do a lot of guesswork because he or she usually is dropped right into the middle of the story, with the author never bothering to introduce the characters or perhaps even failing to mention where the story takes place."}, {"url": "https://www.theabr.org/radiation-oncology/initial-certification/alternate-pathways/holman-research-pathway", "page_content": "Holman Research Pathway\n\nLast verified on April 6, 2023\n\nRequirements\n\nTwenty-seven months of full-time clinical radiation oncology training, which can include three months in PGY-1, are required\n\nHolman Pathway residents must meet the same minimum requirements for special procedures (including interstitial brachytherapy, intracavitary brachytherapy, and unsealed sources) and the same pediatric caseload as traditional residents, outlined in the program guidelines of the RRC in radiation oncology.\n\nFor adult external beam cases, Holman Pathway residents must simulate a minimum of 350 cases over their 27 months of clinical training instead of 450 cases during the 36 months of standard clinical training.\n\nTwenty-one months (18 in extenuating circumstances) of dedicated research time, with 20 percent of this time devoted to clinical training.\n\nA minimum of 18 months of research is required to successfully complete the Holman Pathway.\n\nThe approved candidate can also take three months of research during his or her PGY-1 year, for a total of 24 months.\n\nThe ABR encourages mentors, program directors and candidates to exercise flexibility in scheduling to permit the optimal research experience, and to improve efforts to maintain a trainee\u2019s research-oriented career.

The resulting set of Eur-SSPs can be considered equivalent with the higher-level global SSPs, whilst three out of four were consistent with the CLIMSAVE scenarios that were used as a second starting point. The development of the Eur-SSPs using two sets of existing scenarios at different (temporal and spatial) scales thus proved to be successful.\n\nYet, there are important methodological aspects that deserve more attention. Firstly, the mapping exercise was rather subjective. There are no pre-existing guidelines to decide whether similarities are sufficient to pair two scenarios. In case of a good match, the exercise might seem more straightforward, but the devil is in the details. For example, Eur-SSP1, that needed to be constructed from a global SSP1 that assumed relatively high economic growth and We are the World that assumes a dematerialising Europe. In case of a partial but sufficient match, criteria are lacking, and \u2018partial\u2019 comes in many shapes: Part of the geographical area, part of the temporal extent, part of the sectors, etc. In the case of Eur-SSP4, the experts during the workshop felt that the global SSP4 could be combined with Riders on the Storm. The lack of European-specific information in the global SSP4 and the shorter time horizon on Riders on the Storm made it difficult to substantiate the claim that the resulting Eur-SSP4 is equivalent with its global counterpart. In case of an insufficient match, objective criteria are likewise missing. In the case of SSP5 and Should I Stay or Should I Go, we based our conclusion on important aspects such as globalisation, social cohesion, and economic growth, in a workshop setting with a large number of experts, both on the CLIMSAVE scenarios and the global SSPs. This decision is justifiable as the two worlds are fundamentally different, but rather subjective.\n\nSecondly, comparing uncertainties and their polarities (CLIMSAVE scenarios) and key assumptions (global SSPs) is partly comparing apples and oranges. Geopolitical stability is not the same as international cooperation, even if they are not unrelated. The same holds, for example, for social participation and social cohesion. This is directly related to the fact that the processes by which the scenarios were developed were completely independent. This will be an issue for any combination of existing scenarios.\n\nThirdly, the scenario development exercise was likewise rather subjective. Crucial choices were made for every time slice on what scenario to use (see Fig. 1), without clear criteria for when detail for Europe was sufficient to use the text, or whether two sets of stories were equivalent or equivalence is needed to be created. Note that \u2018equivalence\u2019 is defined in terms of \u2018outcomes\u2019, thus including more than the stories. In IMPRESSIONS, we used some of the quantifications for Europe as given by the SSP database\u2014notably population and GDP, based on the global SSPs. Thus, by definition, the outcomes were equivalent.\n\nIn short, it is fairly straightforward to show how a set of scenarios can be developed that is (very) similar to two existing sets of scenarios. Yet, the methods to create equivalence with one set and consistency with another set are in their infancy.\n\nWe hope that the method employed here can be further fine-tuned in other similar exercises, as it will be tested in other case studies of IMPRESSIONS. Particularly promising advances could include:\n\nMore work on scenario archetypes (see Section \u2018Challenges and risks when developing equivalent scenarios\u2019).\n\nProtocols to standardise what qualitative socio-economic scenarios should contain. The Eur-SSPs have the same elements as the global SSPs (stories, tables with trends, and quantification of key parameters), yet they are not easily or fully comparable. The use of structured methods such as cross-impact balances (Schweizer and Kurniawan 2016) or the factor-actor-sector approach (Absar and Preston 2015) could facilitate a full comparison up front.\n\nDevelop equivalent scenarios during a stakeholder workshop. It is worthwhile to attempt equivalent scenario development during a workshop with (a broader range of) stakeholders, to increase usefulness, relevance, and/or legitimacy of the new set of scenarios. This could lead to tensions with the goal of equivalence, which is worth experimenting with.\n\nLink with suggestions from recent multi-scale scenario literature. Although not focusing on equivalence, structuring tools such as cross-impact balances (Schweizer and Kurniawan 2016); explicit a priori choices of granularity, resolution, and scale (Scholes et al. 2013), or an external consistency analysis (cf. Brand et al. 2013) are promising avenues to pursue.\n\nCharacteristics of equivalent scenarios\n\nThe Eur-SSPs are equivalent to the global SSPs. This has a number of consequences. An important advantage is that the two sets of scenarios can be combined. Climate change (impacts), for example, can directly be taken from the global models. Additionally, assumptions on global trade, international policies, etc. can directly be linked to the European scenarios. Vice versa, global scenario users could include details from the Eur-SSPs in their global model runs. The tight coupling between exploratory scenarios facilitates a tight coupling between the subsequent uses of multi-scale scenarios. Another advantage relates to the visibility and credibility of the lower level scenarios, when equivalent to well-known global scenarios. Many sets of European scenarios exist, but those most known are often those that were linked to global scenarios, notably the IPCC SRES (Rounsevell et al. 2005; Verburg et al. 2008). The same will, hopefully, hold for the Eur-SSPs. Finally, within IMPRESSIONS, equivalent scenarios allow for a true cross-scale scenario development design (see Gramberger et al. 2015). Using consistent or coherent Eur-SSPs would inhibit the execution of developing local extensions of the global SSPs.\n\nChallenges and risks when developing equivalent scenarios\n\nDeveloping and using equivalent scenarios bring about several important risks and challenges. Firstly, O\u2019Neill et al. (2017) introduce the global SSPs as \u2018pathways\u2019, which also means that narratives are short and simple. Equivalence of a lower-scale set of scenarios results in likewise simple and short narratives. As a result, the Eur-SSPs are less detailed than the European CLIMSAVE scenarios, as we omitted material of the existing scenarios to increase equivalence. This might have also reduced relevant regional context material. Secondly, by definition, the Eur-SSPs cover the same uncertainty space as the global SSPs. Although not an unreasonable starting point, Europe-specific uncertainties might have been ignored. Because the CLIMSAVE scenarios consist of stakeholder-determined stories and expert-based quantitative models that were developed iteratively (Harrison et al. 2013; Gramberger et al. 2015; Kok et al. 2015), the risk of missing key uncertainties was small. Thirdly, any shortcoming in the global SSPs might be propagated, particularly related to the newly added SSP4 and SSP5. Finally, this paper relates to two-scenario sets for climate research. When using the SSPs and existing scenarios that have been developed for a different purpose other challenges surface: (a) Mismatches between the drivers, factors, sectors, actors, and hence content will hamper comparison and creating equivalent scenarios. As SSPs will be sectorally extended, this challenge will reduce over time; (b) existing scenarios might have been constructed using fundamentally different uncertainties, which might hinder matching the SSPs. Particularly, when methods such as Morphological Analysis or CIB have been employed, existing scenarios might be difficult to relate. As these methods will be more common, this challenge might increase.\n\nIn short, the resulting Eur-SSPs are an excellent product to be further used, very much like the global SSPs. Yet, also analogous with their global equivalent, they might be in need of further \u2018extension\u2019. Moreover, creating an equivalent set of European SSPs carries over any issue with the global SSPs.\n\nScenario archetypes as overarching constructs\n\nA number of authors have proposed the classification of scenarios into a limited number of scenario archetypes or scenario families (Hunt et al. 2012; Van Vuuren et al. 2012; Rothman 2008). Although the exact number and content of these archetypes\u2014particularly in the context of the global SSPs\u2014is under discussion, there are strong indications that existing scenarios can be clustered into a small number of more general, archetypical descriptions. All efforts seem to agree that the archetypes include a utopian future (cf. Eur-SSP1), a dystopian future (cf. Eur-SSP3), and a future closer to business-as-usual (cf. Eur-SSP5 and global SSP2). There is less agreement on the plausibility and therefore desirability to include SSP4 as a scenario archetype. A future outlook with a powerful, green, elite is regarded plausible in many countries across Latin America and Africa, whilst in Europe plausibility, credibility, and therefore usability of such a scenario has been questioned. Yet, the resemblance with the CLIMSAVE scenario Riders on the Storm suggests that it is an emerging type of future outlook, also in the eyes of the broader stakeholder community. Work on scenario archetypes needs to be prioritised and extended, because it has the potential to aid in the comparison and categorisation of existing scenarios, and therefore also in developing criteria to decide on the degree of matching between scenarios.\n\nRevisiting the concepts\n\nThe conceptual degrees of connectedness, as proposed by Zurek and Henrichs (2007), have proven to be useful, whilst the need for further conceptualisation has become apparent. Selecting a type of connection before embarking upon the scenario development process is an essential first step. The choice for equivalent scenarios has led to important modifications in process and content of the scenarios, with a workshop with experts rather than a broader selection of stakeholders and with resulting scenarios that were simpler than the original European scenarios. Opting for consistent or coherent scenarios would have led to different choices and a different product. As argued in the Introduction, the scenario community has more than sufficient hands-on experience, but lacks conceptual foundations. This paper has helped show where those might be found and how they can be operationalised.\n\nThe approaches that are listed by Zurek and Henrichs were intended for developing new scenario sets rather than existing ones and are, therefore, in need of revision given the increasing importance of existing scenarios. Zurek and Henrichs present a concluding table, where for example five processes of scenario development are related to the level of connectedness. They conclude that it is (very) unlikely that independent processes can lead to more than comparable scenario sets. Based on this paper, this table should be reassessed when starting from existing scenarios. We hypothesise a marked shift from joint processes to rather independent processes, with a need to adapt existing, independently developed material, rather than jointly constructing new material, but continuing to aim for equivalent consistent or coherent scenarios across scale."}, {"url": "https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/john-holman-18191890-14298", "page_content": "How you can use this image\n\nThis image is available to be shared and re-used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial licence (CC BY-NC).\n\nThis image can be reproduced in any way apart from any commercial uses.\n\nWherever you reproduce the image or an altered version of it, you must attribute the original creators (acknowledge the original artist(s), the person/organisation that took the photograph of the work) and any other stated rights holders.\n\nReview our guidance pages which explain how you can reuse images, how to credit an image and how to find more images in the public domain or with a Creative Commons licence available."}, {"url": "https://theconversation.com/profiles/john-holman-109818", "page_content": "Sir John Holman is Emeritus Professor in the Chemistry Department, University of York, UK and adviser in Education at the Wellcome Trust and the Gatsby Foundation.
