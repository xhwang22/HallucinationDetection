The Sydney Games were the 24th occurrence of the modern Olympic Games.\n\nSydney was narrowly chosen over Beijing as host city of the 2000 Olympics. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) was attracted to the city\u2019s long history of enthusiasm for sports, its promise to use recovered toxic wastelands as sites for sporting venues, and its plan to involve the smaller countries of Oceania in hosting activities. Despite some cost overruns and a ticket scandal, the preparations and the Games themselves went smoothly. The opening ceremonies celebrated the history of Australia, especially the unique cultures and contributions of the Aboriginal peoples of the continent. The high point of the opening ceremonies came when Aboriginal runner Cathy Freeman lit the Olympic flame. She later won the gold medal in the 400-metre event. The accomplishments and recognition of Freeman were an important milestone for Australian Aboriginal peoples, who were still struggling for their place in Australian society (see Sidebar: Cathy Freeman: The Heart of a Nation).\n\nBritannica Quiz The Olympic Games\n\nNearly 11,000 athletes representing 199 IOC member countries (including 3 athletes from the United Nations dependency of East Timor) participated in the Games, which featured a record 928 medals awarded in 300 events. Several events were contested at the Olympics for the first time in 2000, including men\u2019s and women\u2019s tae kwon do, trampoline, triathlon, and synchronized diving. Other new women\u2019s events included weightlifting, modern pentathlon, and pole vault. The track-and-field competition starred American sprinter Marion Jones, who won three gold and two bronze medals. Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe, nicknamed the \u201cThorpedo,\u201d collected three gold medals and a silver, and Dutch swimmers Pieter van den Hoogeband and Inge de Bruijn each won two gold medals. British rower Steven Redgrave won his fifth consecutive gold medal, an unmatched feat in his sport.

After winning the bid in 1993, the small group of volunteers grew from approximately 42 to around 500.

Participation rates amongst junior players was steadily climbing to seriously start rivalling the other major sporting codes for the first time.\n\nFacebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share\n\nBut apart from major league matches, such as playoff games, grand finals and championship deciders, the crowds over the length of the journey had not risen to the levels that gave it any sustained profitability.\n\nOver the twenty one years various changes were introduced to the NSL including creating two separate conferences, introducing a play-off series and switching to a summer league, but the financial breakthrough was still not achieved.\n\nDuring the nineties there was also a growing opinion from sponsors and benefactors and the new board of Soccer Australia, that the NSL would not become a mainstream competition because of the overt ethnic flavour of many of the clubs and the league itself.\n\nSome of the NSL clubs were seen as introverted, self concerned with their own ethnicity and not welcoming to the general follower of Australian sports.\n\nEthnic flags and logos were banned and clubs were even asked to change their name to be more like American baseball or football clubs and forget their countries of origin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NSL\u2019s cause was also being seriously wounded by a wolf pack of local newspapers who savaged the game at every opportunity with back page headlines and stories of \u201cEthnic Soccer Hooligan Violence\u201d. So much so that mothers started to fear for their children\u2019s safety if they went anywhere near a football match.\n\nFootball fans themselves started to wonder if these \u201csports reporters\u201d had even attended the same NSL game, so dramatic were the newspaper reports of serious trouble.\n\nSo around that time we saw the gradual reformation of the NSL into a homogenised and sanitised non-ethnic NSL, with only fair dinkum Australian football clubs.\n\nThe NSL Club attendance roll started to look like this: South Melbourne Lakers, Carlton Blues, Football Kingz, Adelaide City Zebras, Sydney United Pumas, Marconi Stallions, Wollongong Wolves, Melbourne Knights, Perth Glory, UTS Olympic, Gippsland Falcons, Brisbane Strikers, Newcastle Breakers, Canberra Cosmos, Collingwood Warriors, Northern Spirit, Parramatta Power and the West Adelaide Sharks.\n\nAnother major change around this time was that clubs like Canberra Cosmos and Perth Glory moved to being full time professional football clubs with full time employees and professional players, as opposed to a lot of NSL clubs and players who were only semi-professional or even amateur in some ways, up to that time.\n\nThe 1997-98 season saw the South Melbourne Lakers top the league table with big spending newcomers Carlton Blues runners up at their first attempt. Carlton and South Melbourne met in the grand final at a packed Olympic Park in an all Melbourne NSL decider.\n\nAnge Postecoglou\u2019s side won their third NSL title 2-1 and first as a manager for Ange. The Carlton Blues team contained a young Marc Bresciano and Simon Colosimo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNorthern Spirit joined the league in 1998-99 and were an immediate hit with the fans of northern Sydney playing to packed stands and a record average attendance in their first season.\n\nSydney City Pumas topped the league table that year ahead of the South Melbourne Lakers, but newcomers Perth Glory and Northern Spirit made the top five and the NSL playoffs.\n\nPerth Glory also attracted big crowds with 28,000 attending their Semi Final win over Marconi. However, Glory lost in the preliminary final to Sydney City. South Melbourne picked up their fourth NSL title with the Lakers 3-2 win in a great grand final at Olympic Park in front of a big crowd.\n\nWollongong Wolves won their first NSL title in 1999-2000 beating a gallant Perth Glory. The match was hailed as the greatest ever NSL grand final after a 3-3 finish in regular time and a penalty shootout win only after eighteen penalty kicks were taken. It was also a memorable game for the record NSL crowd of 43,242 in attendance.\n\nWollongong repeated their title victory in 2000-01, their second NSL crown in a row. This time beating South Melbourne at Parramatta Stadium in front of relatively disappointing crowd of 13,400 fans, given the Perth Glory semi final was watched by 31,710.\n\nThe Sydney Olympic Sharks surprised everyone in 2001-02 winning their second NSL title by beating runaway league leaders Perth Glory one nil in front of 42,735 fans.\n\nGlory finally won the NSL title they richly deserved in 2002-03 extracting their revenge on the Olympic sharks in from of 38,211 fans. Jamie Harnwell and Damien Mori put two goals past Clint Bolton to win two nil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGlory repeated that effort in 2003-04 beating Parramatta Power 1-0 on the 4/4/2004 in front of 9,700 football fans. That was it, the last game of the NSL and the end of the competition.\n\nSo why did the NSL fail?\n\n1. Apart from the high profile games, the NSL and its clubs were never able to attract the large enough fan base to the games to produce enough return on their investment. Large investors, benefactors and sponsors finally ran out of patience and ended their involvement to cut their losses.\n\n2. High profile Australian players started to leave the NSL in larger numbers, due the ever growing overseas football markets and to take up more enticing offers from overseas leagues. Up to 200 of Australia\u2019s best footballers had left the NSL to go overseas to seek their football fortune.\n\n3. Soccer Australia was judged to have been poor administrators of the NSL. The lack of direction and leadership at times did not help the competition, particularly in its declining years.\n\n4. There were a number of controversies and indecisions and finally when Soccer Australia decided to abandon the ethnic flavour of the NSL, it tended to alienate some of the larger and more traditional ethnic clubs, who started pulling in opposite directions.\n\n5. The Australian press were not totally supportive of the NSL and probably sold more papers when they ran negative stories about the NSL, particularly the ethnic soccer violence angle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. There was not a proper process to assess the clubs\u2019 financial and structural viability when they applied to join the NSL and so there was a high turnover of NSL clubs.\n\n7. Australia is a very complex and very competitive sporting market with limited fan bases and financial returns. The other competitions were well entrenched and financially more stable.\n\n8. The Australasian competition with teams from Perth to New Zealand had very large operating and travel expenses and required large ticket and merchandising sales to remain profitable in the long run.\n\nThe National Soccer League (NSL) kicked off in 1977 with so much promise, thirty four years ago this month. Despite all its misgivings, problems and financial woes it ran for twenty eight years, creating a historical and lasting legacy for the many football fans of this country.\n\nHow will you remeber the NSL?"}, {"url": "https://sydneyolympicfc.com/?page_id=125", "page_content": "Club Overview\n\nSydney Olympic Football Club is an Australian semi professional soccer club, based in Belmore, Sydney, New South Wales, that plays in the National Premier Leagues NSW.
