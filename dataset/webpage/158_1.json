Gist, the daughter of Joan Gist and David Turner, is of African American and Cherokee heritage. Her parents divorced when she was a young child. Gist graduated from Cass Technical High School in Detroit in 1987 where she had been an honor student.\n\nGist first won the tile of Miss Michigan USA in 1989 and went on to win the title of Miss USA on March 2, 1990 in Wichita, Kansas. She was the first contestant from Michigan to win the Miss USA (not Miss America) title and she also broke the five year streak of winners from the state of Texas. At 5\u201911\u201d Gist was also the tallest Miss USA. At the time of her crowning, she was a junior majoring in marketing and management at Northwood University in Midland, Michigan, from which she eventually received her B.A. degree.\n\nWinning the title brought Gist over $200,000 in cash and prizes and automatically earned her the opportunity to represent the United States in the Miss Universe pageant where she placed as first runner up to Miss Norway, Mona Grut.\n\nThroughout her reign as Miss USA, Gist captivated audiences with her stories of being from a single parent home where she had a number of siblings and having to overcome numerous financial and social obstacles. She described the family\u2019s frequent moves in some of the roughest neighborhoods in inner city Detroit and of her homes being frequently burglarized. Gist claimed that money was always scarce in her family and that poverty prevented her from taking dance lessons or learning the piano and violin. Her story contrasted sharply with the middle class backgrounds of most of her competition and of previous Miss USA crown holders.\n\nControversy, however, surrounded Gist\u2019s reign as Miss USA. Her conflicts with pageant officials became well known to the public by 1991. Toward the end of her reign she filed a $20,000,000 lawsuit against the Miss USA Organization for fraud. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed.\n\nFollowing her reign, Gist co-hosted a program on the WORD gospel network. Carol Ann-Marie Gist is currently married with two children.

The Miss USA pageant has been held for 70 years, since 1952, and for 38 years a Black woman had never won. Miss Gist's win was not just important because she was a Black woman but because her background was not ideal. Miss Gist grew up in Motor City, Detroit, a city where she would jump out of garages in proof of her toughness, and divorced parents. Miss Gist needs to be applauded not only for her beauty and strength but also for her intelligence. Miss Gist attended Cass Technical High School and at the time of her win was a junior at Northwood University studying marketing. Miss Gist presents herself as an extremely hard worker and currently has two associate degrees and a dual bachelor's degree from Northwood, two master's degrees, one in sports admin and one in Kinesiology. In the Thirty-one years since the pageant Miss Gist has worked several jobs all befitting her competitive nature and talents in the arts.\n\nThe pageant life is tough with constant judgment and impact on self-esteem, but Miss Gist is quite known for positivity.\n\nIn an Interview with Jets magazine shortly after her win, Miss Gist stated \u201cHopefully the Lord\u2019s eyes will be upon me again. I am going there with the attitude that I have a chance because I\u2019m just as qualified as the other girls.\u201d Although both her parents were involved in her life Miss Gist grew up in a single-parent home. Her family struggled financially so she could not do all the things she wanted like singing, dancing, and playing instruments like piano and violin. She did not have as much preparation as the other girls, but she was able to recognize that everyone was equal and worked just as hard as everyone else. She was able to use her resources although limited and create her own legacy.\n\nMiss Gist should be remembered as one of the biggest impacts of Black beauty movements in America."}, {"url": "https://exploring-usa.com/black-miss-usa-winners/", "page_content": "Black Miss USA Winners.
