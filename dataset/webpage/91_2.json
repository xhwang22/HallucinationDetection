One particular line from the agent served as a flashing light. The Premier League\u2019s contract deadline of 23 June was fast approaching and Joorabchian believed there was plenty of work to do. \u201cThere are several issues within the whole structure that will be resolved,\u201d he said, before returning to the theme of his high-profile client.\n\nJoorabchian\u2019s working relationship with the Arsenal hierarchy is no secret, and he was perfectly entitled to provide a commentary. But for some who have harboured reservations about his influence it was, as one puts it, the final straw. However it was intended, the statement felt overly familiar with the club\u2019s internal concerns. The events that followed have shed light on the identity crisis evolving within Arsenal, which has caused dismay among former and existing staff.\n\nThe worry is that Arsenal, once famously resourceful, have entrusted too much responsibility for recruitment to a narrow list of associates that includes Joorabchian, a super-agent with a storied past in helping broker big deals and a long-time friend of the technical director, Edu.\n\nThere is, of course, nothing to stop them working together, and there are many ways to address squad-building requirements. But eyebrows were raised on Tuesday when the 33-year-old David Luiz, one of the club\u2019s highest earners at a time when Covid-19 and a poor season have forced some difficult financial decisions, was enlisted for a further year.\n\nPerhaps more jarring was the fact C\u00e9dric Soares, the 28-year-old who had been prevented by injury from making his debut since joining on loan from Southampton, was tied down on a long-term deal that effectively makes him the deputy right-back.\n\nBoth players are represented by Joorabchian and his company, Sports Invest UK.\n\nArsenal centre-back David Luiz. Photograph: Reuters\n\nTransfers of that nature would, while entirely legitimate, have been anathema under Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. He generally shied away from deals with bigger-name agents and had little time for heavy investments in older players. But Joorabchian\u2019s hand has been evident in a clutch of moves involving Arsenal in the past year, the first being a move that was completed on 8 August, a month after Edu, a former player, returned to Arsenal. The Football Association\u2019s list of intermediary transactions, released this week, shows Sports Invest UK represented Arsenal in Alex Iwobi\u2019s \u00a335m move to Everton.\n\nIwobi\u2019s and Everton\u2019s side of the deal was, according to the list, overseen separately by the agency that represents the player. It is not unusual for different parties to work on the different ends of a transfer, even more so when involving moves from abroad, and there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing. Some experienced industry figures simply point out that given Arsenal and Everton are familiar rivals and worked together 18 months previously when Theo Walcott made the same move it appears a convoluted way to have done business.\n\nDavid Luiz arrived from Chelsea on the same day and Soares followed in January. Willian, another Joorabchian client, has been linked with a summer arrival although the Observer understands that while there is strong interest on Arsenal\u2019s part no final decision has been made on his future.\n\nThe fear in certain quarters is that Arsenal\u2019s executive team are wed to a select set of voices and marginalising those with an alternative view, particularly when it comes to transfers and planning. Nobody doubted the club\u2019s approach needed modernising in the post-Wenger era and that is why there was surprise when Sven Mislintat, the head of recruitment, moved on in February 2019.\n\nSince then, the suggestion is that Arsenal have surrendered a coherent approach to player-spotting and handed too much power to the contacts books of Edu and the head of football, Ra\u00fal Sanllehi. Some members of staff are believed to feel frozen out and there is particular angst that Arsenal, who also conducted a revamp of their academy staff in November, may be losing ground in any chase for the best young players. One former employee claims the club\u2019s approach no longer fitted their values and the high-performance culture fostered under Wenger has been allowed to ebb away.\n\nThere is a view that Arsenal\u2019s hierarchy are awkward customers. It has not gone unnoticed among certain club personnel over the past two seasons that certain agents and contacts do not return calls as frequently. One player representative says he sighs inwardly when an Arsenal number shows up on his phone; another is strongly critical of their communication skills.\n\nIt goes without saying that everyone in the picture has their own agenda and that every agent has clients\u2019 interests to look after. That is all part of the game but it becomes more problematic when, as some suggest has occurred, potential deals begin to falter.\n\nFor all the structural issues the biggest problem is, another source says, a \u201clack of relevant brains\u201d. Arsenal are well known, as per the words of their director Josh Kroenke, to be operating a \u201cChampions League wage bill on a Europa League budget\u201d, and given their league position that will not change unless Mikel Arteta is given the squad clearout he desires this summer. That means they ideally require value \u2013 and preferably resale value \u2013 in the market, operating more like Borussia Dortmund or RB Salzburg than Barcelona or Real Madrid.\n\n\u201cFinally Arsenal have people who really understand football and are footballing people in the back-room staff,\u201d Joorabchian said in a separate TalkSport interview last July, referencing Sanllehi and Edu. \u201cBut the question is whether or not the finances will be made available.\u201d\n\nIf not, then what? The bigger issue appears to be whether Sanllehi, who helped bring Neymar to Barcelona, and the former Brazil general manager Edu have the expertise to run Arsenal in a lean, streamlined fashion according to those parameters. Another figure familiar with their way of working does not believe so, suggesting Arsenal risk being a \u201cmid-table team within three to four years\u201d if nothing changes.\n\nThere remains enough promise to remove such doomsday scenarios. The acquisitions of Gabriel Martinelli and William Saliba a year ago showed that elements are still in place for Arsenal to find players with a genuine chance of becoming high-class performers. Match-winning contributions by Eddie Nketiah and Joe Willock at Southampton on Thursday were reminders the academy, can still turn up wonders. To realise all that potential, though, the sense is that Arsenal need to remember exactly how those things became true."}, {"url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/5294552/kia-joorabchian-profile-philippe-coutinho-transfer/", "page_content": "Joorabchian has made his name brokering some of football's biggest deals\n\nIT is the second-most expensive transfer in football history, the biggest-ever sale from the English game and a new club record for big-spending Barcelona.\n\nThe numbers behind Philippe Coutinho\u2019s \u00a3145million switch from Liverpool to the Nou Camp are eye-watering.\n\n4 Kia Joorabchian was Philippe Coutinho's adviser during his move to Barcelona Credit: AFP - Getty\n\nThe man behind the move, acting as Coutinho\u2019s advisor throughout, will be familiar to eagle-eyed football fans as also being the man responsible for several other major transfers involving Premier League players and teams in the recent past.\n\nKia Joorabchian has made his name by brokering some of the biggest deals in the game.\n\nSo we asked our friends at Football Whispers to profile the Iranian businessman.\n\nBorn in Tehran, Joorabchian\u2019s family emigrated to England when he was six, moving to Canada before returning to England when he was 12.\n\n4 Philippe Coutinho had Kia Joorabchian as his adviser during his recent transfer Credit: EPA\n\nThe 46-year-old holds British citizenship.\n\nHe was educated at Shiplake College in Oxfordshire, before attending Queen Mary and Westfield College, University of London, although he dropped out in his second year.\n\nJoorabchian grew up supporting Arsenal and had an executive box at the Emirates for a time.

The involvement of unlicensed agents in transfers in the English Premier League is prohibited by the Football Association. Joorabchian does not himself claim to be an agent, saying \"I think the agency business is very different\". He describes his business as advising players on their rights and clubs on transfers and contracts.\n\nJoorabchian is also involved in the 'third-party' ownership of players, describing himself as an investment manager. In October 2008, he said, \"I manage the investment group and obviously when the investment group is profitable, as fund manager, you also get a cut\". In 2009 it was reported that the unnamed investors represented by Joorabchian were understood to own the economic rights to 60 or 70 players across Europe and South America.\n\nHe has supported Arsenal Football Club since his childhood and later kept a corporate box at their Emirates Stadium. Due to his association with Arsenal he has forged a close relationship with David Dein and his son Darren.\n\nJoorabchian was educated at Shiplake College in Oxfordshire and then at a school in Golders Green, north London. He went on to study chemistry and business studies at Queen Mary and Westfield College, University of London, dropping out after his second year.\n\nKia Joorabchian was born in Tehran, Iran, the son of Iranian car-dealer businessman, Mohammed Joorabchian. According to Joorabchian his father's uncle had once run the biggest car manufacturer in the Middle East. The Joorabchian family emigrated from Iran following the fall of the Shah in 1979. They went to the United Kingdom and then Canada, returning to England when Joorabchian was 12. His father ran car dealerships, including Medway Autos in Kent.\n\nAlthough Joorabchian suffered in the stock market crash of 2001, his sale of American Capital after that volatility brought him, on his own estimate, between \u00a350 million and \u00a360 million.\n\nA year later, in 1999, American Capital bought 85% of the Russian newspaper Kommersant. After a month Kommersant\u2019s ownership passed to the oligarch Boris Berezovsky, who was widely suspected to have been behind American Capital\u2019s bid for the paper -something denied by Joorabchian who was said to have given assurances that he was not working on anyone else\u2019s behalf. Raf Shakirov, who was replaced as editor after Berezovsky\u2019s acquisition of Kommersant, told the British newspaper The Mail on Sunday in 2005 \u201cJoorabchian was and is very much Berezovsky\u2019s man\u201d.\n\nJoorabchian worked first for his father and then as a trader at the International Petroleum Exchange in London. He became involved in the stock market and fund management, moving to New York City and establishing, with his associate, Reza Irani-Kermanian, an investment company, American Capital, based in Manhattan but registered in the British Virgin Islands.\n\nInvolvement in football\n\nMedia Sports Investments and Corinthians\n\nIn 2004, Joorabchian founded Media Sports Investments to make a partnership with Brazilian football club Corinthians. He had briefly considered becoming involved at Arsenal, but found it too expensive and had instead been pointed towards Brazilian football by Pele's agent and the recommendation of Pini Zahavi, the so-called 'super agent', whom Joorabchian described in 2006 as a friend of long standing.\n\nThe partnership with Corinthians's was a 10-year deal stipulating that MSI would provide $35 million \u2013$20 million of which would cover debts\u2013 in return for 51% of future profits. Joorabchian moved to Brazil and changed the way Corinthians was run, increasing revenue by 500% in the first year.\n\nA series of major signings followed MSI's investment, including, most spectacularly, Carlos Tevez, who was signed from Boca Juniors for $22 million, an unprecedented amount for a transfer by a South American club. These were players who were engaged to play for Corinthians but whose economic rights were partly or wholly owned by MSI. By 2006 the company was listing as its investments not just Corinthians, but also the players Carlos Tevez, Marcelo Mattos, Gustavo Nery, Roger, Javier Mascherano, Carlos Alberto, Sebasti\u00e1n Dom\u00ednguez and Marinho. In 2005 Corinthians won its fourth Brazilian title.\n\nThe Tevez transfer was brokered by the Argentinian football agent Fernando Hidalgo, who was a partner in the company HAZ Sports with Pini Zahavi. Zahavi, responsible for numerous football deals, including the acquisition of Chelsea Football Club by Roman Abramovich, acted as a broker for MSI.\n\nThe source of the money behind MSI was a subject of considerable speculation. The Spanish sports newspaper Diario AS suggested that a 15% share was owned by Abramovich, while Joorabchian\u2019s name continued to be linked to that of Berezovsky. In 2005 the Georgian businessman and owner of Dinamo Tbilisi, Badri Patarkatsishvili, a close associate of Berezovsky, told a journalist that they had indeed invested in Corinthians. Joorabchian himself was described by Brazilian authorities as \"trying, at all costs, to hide knowledge of the people and businesses involved in the transactions\".\n\nIn 2007, following allegations that Corinthians had been used to launder money, a Brazilian judge, Faustus Martins de Sanctis, ordered the arrest of Berezovsky, Joorabchian, Nojan Bedroud, cofounder of MSI, and four officials of club, including the chairman, Alberto Dualib. MSI responded by saying that the judge\u2019s actions were \"absurd, arbitrary and lacking legal backing\", while Joorabchian denied any wrongdoing and maintained that all payments made to Corinthians were \"cleared through and approved by the Brazilian Central Bank\".\n\nThe Brazilian court papers setting out the evidence on which the warrants of arrest were issued stated: \u201cMSI belongs and has always belonged to the accused, Boris Berezovsky\u201d. Berezovsky denied any business connection with Joorabchian or MSI.\n\nIn the light of these developments Corinthians broke off their association with MSI in July 2007. There had already been a public deterioration in relations between the directors of the club and its investors centering on the involvement of MSI and Joorabchian in the team's affairs, and the fact that the club had been left owning only five members of the playing squad. Tevez and Mascherano had been transferred to West Ham United and there had been seven different managers in 18 months. In December 2007 Corinthians were relegated from Brazil's first division.\n\nThe warrant for Joorabchian's arrest was suspended by the Brazilian authorities in August 2008.\n\nIn April 2014, The judge totally absolved the whole case saying there was never anything done wrong by anyone in the case at all. \"In this case, there is no proof of a single offense, nor is it pointed out that the alleged group ever have had any intention or interest in the committing any crimes,\" added the judge.\n\nTevez, Mascherano and West Ham United\n\nJoorabchian stepped down as president of Media Sports Investments in June 2006. It was reported at the time that Joorabchian retained an investment in Tevez and Mascherano, whose economic rights were described as being owned by MSI. A subsequent Premier League investigation revealed that in February 2006 rights in Tevez had been transferred to MSI (company id: 05218027) and a second company, Just Sports Inc., while Mascherano was jointly owned by Global Soccer Agencies and Mystere Services Ltd. All four companies were represented by Joorabchian.\n\nIn August 2006 the two players joined West Ham in the English Premier League. Pini Zahavi assisted in the transfers, revealing to the press that he stood to make money if the players were a success in England. Zahavi had an association over a number of years with Global Soccer Agencies, owners of a half share in Mascherano.\n\nZahavi also suggested that he had the idea for Joorabchian's proposed takeover of West Ham itself, \"Was it my idea? Yes it was,\" Zahavi said. Joorabchian had investigated the possibility of a takeover of the club the autumn before Tevez and Mascherano moved to West Ham, promising to make \u00a3100 million available for new players in a \u00a3200 million deal valuing the club and its debts at \u00a375 million. The takeover floundered when it proved impossible to agree a valuation for the club but the possibility was revived following the Tevez/Mascherano transfer. Patarkatsishvili announced that he was considering becoming involved in the bid. In the end no offer resulted and the club was sold to a consortium headed by Eggert Magnusson.\n\nAlthough the capture of Tevez and Mascherano was reported as a major coup for West Ham, the third-party ownership of the players proved highly controversial. At that time the practice was permitted as long as the investing party exercised no influence over the club's playing or transfer policy. It has been reported that Joorabchian in fact retained the power to transfer either player at any time during their contracts.\n\nIn April 2007 West Ham was fined a record \u00a35.5 million by the Premier League for entering into third-party contracts whose existence they did not reveal in the knowledge that, in the words of the Premier League's findings, \"the FAPL at the very least may not - and in all probability would not - have approved of such contracts\". When Tevez was instrumental in West Ham's avoiding relegation at the end of the 2006-7 season the position was legally challenged by the relegated club, Sheffield United, on the ground that Tevez should have been ineligible to play. The claim was eventually settled out of court in March 2009 with West Ham paying Sheffield United \u00a320 million over five years.\n\nSpeculation has subsequently linked Joorabchian with the takeover of the football clubs Fulham, in early 2007, and Southampton, in January 2008.\n\nTransfer of Tevez to Manchester United and then to Manchester City\n\nIn August 2007 Carlos Tevez moved from West Ham United to Manchester United. The deal was subject to a protracted dispute with West Ham claiming that the player was registered to them and contracted until June 2010. The Premier League insisted that negotiations should be \"done directly\" with the club who should receive the fee for any transfer. Joorabchian maintained that MSI and Just Sports Inc retained the economic rights to the player and that the deal had been negotiated with the \"knowledge and permission\" of West Ham. In a statement issued on behalf of MSI Joorabchian said that West Ham had \"consistently provided private assurances while at the same time making contrary statements to the public at large\".\n\nAsked for a ruling by the Football Association and the Premier League, FIFA judged that the matter should be referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. MSI and Just Sports Inc then issued a writ in order to \"compel West Ham to release the registration of Carlos Tevez in accordance with contracts entered into between the parties\".\n\nThe threat of action in the High Court was avoided by a settlement that saw West Ham receive a fee of \u00a32 million for T\u00e9vez's registration. Joorabchian later claimed that West Ham agreed to return the money with additional legal costs bringing the total to \u00a32.6 million, apparently contradicting the club\u2019s claim to the Premier League that they would be the beneficiary of the fee.\n\nThe terms of the transfer saw Manchester United agree a two-year deal in which Tevez's registration was leased by the club while his economic rights were retained by his third-party owners. Manchester United paid \u00a33-4 million a year for Tevez's commercial and football rights for the duration of the lease and secured the first option on a permanent transfer.\n\nIn September 2009 Tevez signed for Manchester City in a deal removing him from third-party ownership sometimes reported as being worth \u00a347 million to the companies owning his economic rights, although that amount was disputed by Joorabchian who called the story \"inaccurate and misleading\".\n\nLegal dispute with West Ham United\n\nIn 2008, Joorabchian became engaged in a legal dispute with West Ham United over what he said were unmet payments by the club of \u00a34.5 million and \u00a32.6 million relating to Tevez. Joorabchian claimed that he brokered a resolution between West Ham and the two companies, MSI and Just Sports Inc, who owned the player's economic rights and who initially refused to cancel that third-party arrangement as requested by the Premier League as part of their findings of April 2007. Potentially Tevez would not have played in the final two games of the 2006-7 season.\n\nJoorabchian stated that the payments were to cover costs, the player\u2019s salary, expenses and a loan fee, as well as \u00a32 million he claimed to have paid to West Ham for Tevez's registration as part of the deal that saw the player transferred to Manchester United in August 2007. Joorabchian's allegation that Tevez received a salary and expenses other than that paid to him by West Ham, would \u2013were those payments to have been met by a third party\u2013 have breached the Premier League's regulations. West Ham United claimed they were unaware of such payments.\n\nThe eventual out-of-court settlement of these proceedings saw Joorabchian engaged as a consultant by West Ham with fees of more than \u00a32 million. In this capacity Joorabchian was critical of transfer dealings made by Eggert Magnusson and the club's former manager, Alan Curbishley, who resigned saying that transfer policy had been taken out of his hands.\n\nDefence of 'Third-Party' ownership\n\nTevez's ownership and the role of Joorabchian in English football remained highly controversial throughout the period up to the player's transfer to Manchester City in September 2009. Joorabchian's continued opacity on the question of the identity of those behind the companies he represented was a point of particular discussion.\n\nThe heavily criticised involvement of third parties in the ownership of players was banned by the Premier League for the start of the 2008-9 season. One high-ranking official had called it, \"an unedifying trade in young people that rips the heart out of clubs which try to develop players\". Joorabchian himself offered a defence of the arrangement, calling it \"the South American model and a model that appears all over Europe\". In his view third-party transfers are \"a way of bringing outstanding players to clubs that would not be able to afford them ordinarily. So they increase the competition\", further explaining: \"What happens, in Brazil particularly, clubs cannot afford to buy a player. So they go to a business, a bank, a major supermarket, an individual, a person, a wealthy individual and say: 'We want Mr X. You put up 70, 80, 100 per cent of the money, let him play here.' It is a little bit like a loan deal between two clubs, except it is a loan deal between the club and a third party\".\n\nJoorabchian also claimed that concealed third-party ownership arrangements were common in the Premier League, saying in 2007: \"I know a lot of players in the Premier League - and other leagues - which are here in the same format as we have done, but in a hidden scheme\".\n\nConnection to Manchester City\n\nIn January 2009 it emerged that Joorabchian had been present at a meeting between representatives of Manchester City and A.C. Milan, arranged to discuss the possible -although in the end unsuccessful- \u00a391 million transfer to City of the Brazilian footballer, Kak\u00e1.\n\nPress reports connected Joorabchian to City's signing of Robinho in 2008 and suggested that he was exercising a wider influence over the shape of City's transfer policy, specifically in attempting to bring a single megastar to the club to reflect a changed status under the ownership of Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, rather than build a side of proven Premier League performers. Joorabchian admitted to having an informal association with Manchester City in October 2008.\n\nSources at Manchester City suggested that Joorabchian and Pini Zahavi had developed links to the club under the regime of the previous owner, Thaksin Shinawatra, who had originally appointed the City chief executive Garry Cook. Cook himself said that the club \"did not need and did not seek\" Joorabchian's help in facilitating the negotiations with A.C. Milan. Joorabchian was involved in the leaking of Carlos Tevez's transfer request to Manchester City on 11 December 2010, by revealing the news to the Sunday Mirror newspaper.\n\nInvolvement with Ramires\n\nIn June 2010, it was reported that Joorabchian had secured a 50% share in the Brazilian midfielder Ramires for \u20ac6 million (through Jazzy Limited, Joorabchian as sole director), then at Benfica but subject to transfer interest from across Europe, led by Chelsea in the Premier League. The deal was reportedly part of an agreement reached with Benfica president Lu\u00eds Filipe Vieira the previous year at the time of Ramires's transfer to Benfica from Cruzeiro in Brazil.\n\nBenfica declared in its financial report that the club received \u20ac11 million (50% of the fee) and generated \u20ac8.8 million profit.\n\nRamires completed his move to Chelsea on 13 August 2010 on a four-year contract for a fee of \u20ac22 million. It is thought that Joorabchian would receive around \u20ac11 million of this fee, which Benfica also revealed in its financial report that the club had a net debt of \u20ac5,479,526 to Jazzy Limited, excessed \u20ac479,526 by \u20ac11 million minus \u20ac6 million.\n\nNewcastle United\n\nOn 12 January 2010, it was reported by outlets such as ESPN that Joorabchian had been appointed to the position of \"Football Advisor\" at the club, and would be leading a clear-out of players, bringing in talented youth from around the world.\n\nSports Invest UK Limited\n\nJoorabchian is the sole director of Sports Invest UK Limited, with registered FIFA agent Nojan Bedroud.

Roman Abramovich, owner of Chelsea, was at one time rumored to own a 15% share in the group, while Joorabchian was persistently linked to the oligarch Boris Berezovsky and his associate Badri Patarkatsishvili.\n\nMedia Sports Investment Limited ( MSI ) was a London-based international investment fund that was headed by the Iranian-born, British-educated, businessman Kia Joorabchian. It has attracted considerable attention for its partnership between 2004 and 2007 of Corinthians football club in Brazil, and for its involvement in the 'third-party' ownership of players, notably the Argentinian forward Carlos Tevez.\n\nMSI and Corinthians\n\nMedia Sport Investment Limited was founded in 2004 in London by Joorabchian and Nojan Bedroud (a FIFA licensed agent) to control Corinthians football department. The agreed 10-year deal stated that MSI would invest $35 million into the club \u2013$20 million of which would cover debts\u2013 in return for 51% of profits over the duration of the contract. In the wake of MSI's involvement a stream of new players arrived at the club, players who were engaged to play for Corinthians but whose economic rights were partly or wholly owned by the investment fund. According to the investigation of S\u00e3o Paulo police, MSI not only financed Corinthians but also financed to buy players directly, namely Carlos Tevez (35%), Carlos Alberto (50%) and Sebasti\u00e1n Dom\u00ednguez (100%). While Nilmar, the labour court of Brazil had cancelled his contract with MSI and Corinthians in 2007. MSI also worked with Global Soccer Agencies bought players for Corinthians, namely Javier Mascherano and Carlos Alberto (another 50%). Marcelo Mattos, which bought by Devita Limited (the company also financed MSI Brasil and Corinthians) also played for Corinthians. Other players such as Rafael Moura, Johnny Herrera and Renato Ribeiro were linked to MSI by Brazil media. The signing of Tevez from Boca Juniors for reported US$22 million (US$16 million plus various fee) in December 2004 was a record for a transfer by a South American club.\n\nThe partnership with Corinthians had been the subject of investigation by the Brazilian police, although no wrongdoing was found. In July 2007, however, a Brazilian judge issued arrest warrants for Boris Berezovsky, Joorabchian, Bedroud and four officials of club, including the chairman, Alberto Dualib, on charges of money laundering. MSI Brazil arm, MSI Licenciamentos e Administracao Ltda, received money from Devetia Limited, a BVI company. MSI Licenciamentos was owned by Devetia, MSI Group Limited (formed in 2000 as Exnon Holdings Limited) and Just Sports Inc., (later sold all the shares to MSI Group and Devetia), which Joorabchian was the director of Just Sports and the rest was linked to Berezovsky, Patarkatsishvili and Pini Zahavi. However BVI company act protected the real identity of the ownership.\n\nThe federal attorneys Silvio Luis Martins de Oliveira and Rodrigo de Grandis were reported by the Brazilian legal website consultor Juridico as saying that MSI's transactions were \"carried out with the use of numerous offshore accounts which have the single and well-known intention of distancing the investor and the illicit origin of the resources from their final destination, in this case the purchase and sale of players\".\n\nIn July 2007, in the light of the money laundering allegations, Corinthians broke off their association with MSI. Despite winning the league in 2005, there had already been a public breakdown in relations between Corinthians and MSI. The club had seven different coaches in 18 months, including Daniel Passarella, M\u00e1rcio Bittencourt and Ant\u00f4nio Lopes, and had struggled for form. Joorabchian's involvement with team affairs had come in for criticism and both Tevez and Javier Mascherano had been moved to West Ham United in the English Premier League. In December 2007 Corinthians was relegated to the Brazilian Championship's second division.\n\nThe warrant for Joorabchian's arrest was suspended by the Brazilian authorities in August 2008.\n\nIn April 2014, The judge totally absolved the whole case saying there was never anything done wrong by anyone in the case at all. \"In this case, there is no proof of a single offense, nor is it pointed out that the alleged group ever have had any intention or interest in the committing any crimes,\" added the judge.\n\nMSI and West Ham\n\nIn 2005 MSI was involved in negotiations to take over the English club West Ham United. The plan was abandoned in November of that year when agreement on a valuation of the club could not be reached.\n\nOn August 31, 2006, the Corinthians players Javier Mascherano and Carlos Tevez moved to West Ham United. The following day the club announced the opening of \"exploratory discussions\" over a possible takeover, reportedly by a consortium fronted by Joorabchian and Paul Yeubrey. West Ham in the end accepted a rival bid from investors headed by Eggert Magn\u00fasson.\n\nThe transfers of Tevez and Mascherano proved highly controversial. In April 2007 West Ham were fined \u00a35.5 million for failing to reveal the full terms of the ownership of the players. In fact MSI retained a percentage of the economic rights to Tevez (through MSI Group Limited, a BVI company), shared with a second company, Just Sports Inc, while Mascherano was owned by Global Soccer Agencies and Mystere Services Ltd. All four companies were represented by Joorabchian who had officially stepped down as president of Media Sport Investment in June 2006. However, according to filing in the Companies House, Joorabchian was remained as the director of England incorporated MSI Ltd. all the time.\n\nClaim against West Ham United\n\nIn a compensation claim against West Ham, undertaken in March 2008, Joorabchian claimed that following the Premier League ruling in April 2007 he had brokered a deal between West Ham and Tevez's third-party owners. MSI and Just Sports Inc had initially been reluctant to terminate their ownership arrangement as requested by the Premier League. Joorabchian said that under the terms of the deal West Ham had agreed to pay \u00a34.7 million \u2014 later reduced to \u00a34.5 million \u2014 to cover costs, the player\u2019s salary, expenses and a loan fee \u2014thereby suggesting that Tevez was paid a salary and expenses beyond that being covered by the club.\n\nJoorabchian further stated that he paid West Ham \u00a32 million to release Tevez's registration so that he could join Manchester United in August 2007 on the understanding that West Ham would return the money with legal costs amounting to \u00a32.6 million. That transfer had itself been subject to a protracted dispute while Joorabchian claimed that MSI and Just Sports Inc retained the economic rights to the player and should therefore receive any fee for the transfer, rather than West Ham as the Premier League insisted. In the end, West Ham received \u00a32 million for the player's registration \u2014the money Joorabchain claimed to have paid West Ham on the understanding that it would be returned.\n\nJoorabchian's claim against West Ham was eventually settled out-of-court with Joorabchian engaged as a consultant by West Ham with fees of more than \u00a32 million.\n\nTevez\n\nIn August 2007, Tevez joined Manchester United on a two-year deal in which his player's registration was leased by the club while his economic rights were retained by his third-party owners. Only when he signed for Manchester City in September 2009 was Tevez removed from the third-party ownership of MSI and Just Sports Inc. That deal was reported as being worth \u00a347 million to the companies owning Tevez's economic rights, although that sum was disputed by Joorabchian.\n\nIn March 2009 West Ham agreed to pay Sheffield United \u00a320 million over five years in settlement of the case that they had brought against West Ham when the east London club stayed in the Premier League at the end of the 2006\u201307 season at Sheffield United's expense while playing Tevez, a player they argued should have been ineligible.\n\nJ\u00f4\n\nIn June 2008 the transfer of Brazilian player J\u00f4 from CSKA Moscow to Manchester City was initially blocked by the Premier League while they investigated his association with MSI and Joorabchian. J\u00f4 had played at Corinthians before moving to CSKA Moscow in 2006, signing for the Brazilian side while the club was under the control of MSI.

At the same time Tevez's current representative, Kia Joorabchian, was dictating Corinthians' transfer policy as president of the linked investment company, Media Sports Investment.\n\nSanchez and Joorabchian certainly seem to have got on well and some say the former was the best man at Joorabchian's 2007 wedding in London to the Brazilian lawyer Tatiana Alonso.\n\nJoorabchian has close links to Manchester City. He is the former manager Mark Hughes's agent and was engaged by Thaksin Shinawatra to conduct transfers at Eastlands during the Thai's ownership. Although Sheikh Mansour moved him on, Joorabchian has accompanied City executives in other transfer business. Notably, he travelled to Milan during the ill-fated attempt to hire Kak\u00e1.\n\nThere have since been signs of tensions between Joorabchian and City over Tevez, as indeed there were with Corinthians when he left there. But one thing is for sure: the latest speculation linking Joorabchian's player, Tevez, with his mates at Corinthians is certainly in the interest of his old mates at City.\n\nTevez reportedly earns about \u00a312m a year at Eastlands and even if the \u00a335m \"bid\" was actually an offer to take over the Argentinian's wages in an otherwise free transfer (in which MSI may or may not have taken an interest in Tevez's economic rights), it very publicly sets up a market for a player whose time in Manchester is up.\n\nEastlands guinea pigs?\n\nWhen Ars\u00e8ne Wenger talks about Michel Platini's \"strong determination\" to ensure Manchester City's excesses are reined in by the financial fair play rules, his faith is in fact being placed not in Uefa's president but in a collection of academics, businessmen and football worthies. These are the men who sit on Uefa's independent Club Financial Control Panel, whose two British delegates are Brian Lomax, the former chairman of Supporters Direct, and Brian Quinn, the former Celtic chairman.\n\nOne of the objectives of the panel is to assess whether sponsorship deals from parties related to clubs or their shareholders are struck at market rates. Clearly Wenger does not think City's has been. The panel is headed by the former prime minister of Belgium, Jean-Luc Dehaene, who is joined by Jacobo Beltr\u00e1n, a former adviser to the Spanish government, Egon Franck, Umberto Lago and Petros Mavroidis, who are law and economics academics from Germany, Italy and Greece respectively. Then there are Johan Lokhorst, a Dutch businessman, and the French corporate lawyer Yves Wehrli. The panel is currently road testing the financial fair play rules and using certain clubs as case studies for the robustness and applicability of the regulations ahead of their formal introduction in two years. Whether City, with its immoderate approach to club finance, have been used as one of those guinea pigs is unknown.\n\nBin Hammam loses\n\nMohamed bin Hammam has lost his final challenge to the process that will lead to him being tried by Fifa's ethics committee next week over the corruption allegations he strongly denies.

Through all the years, one thing has remained consistent in his identity: Joorabchian is an Arsenal fan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome years ago, Joorabchian investigated the possibility of investing in the club of his heart. Ultimately, he made do with a \u00a3100,000-a-year corporate box. Until recently, his considerable influence in football did not extend to the Arsenal boardroom. He remained a spectator, just another supporter. When Joorabchian took his seat to watch Arsene Wenger\u2019s teams, it was strictly pleasure \u2014 no business.\n\nHowever, that is now changing. Wenger\u2019s departure has opened the door to a new era. There is another team close to Joorabchian\u2019s heart \u2014 Brazil\u2019s Corinthians \u2014 and it is through his association with the Sao Paulo outfit that he came to know their former player Edu Gaspar. When Arsenal wanted Edu to be their new technical director earlier this year, it was Joorabchian who brokered the deal.\n\nJoorabchian, who has spent so long on the periphery at Arsenal, finally has a man on the inside.\n\nThe year before Joorabchian made headlines in England by bringing Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano to West Ham United, he had already sent shockwaves through South American football by shifting the Argentine pair to Corinthians.\n\nIt was 2004 when the Brazilian club struck a deal with MSI (Media Sports Investments), a London-based investment fund fronted by Joorabchian. He publicly promised to rival Real Madrid and Manchester United in building \u201ca team of Galacticos\u201d. MSI pledged to wipe the club\u2019s debts and invest a minimum of $35 million in exchange for 51 per cent of profits. A club that had been on the brink of economic crisis suddenly became a landing spot for some of South America\u2019s brightest talent.\n\nThe $22 million deal to sign Tevez from Argentina\u2019s Boca Juniors was reportedly four times the previous Brazilian transfer record, and MSI put up a significant percentage of the money. In return, they had control of 35 per cent of the player\u2019s registration rights \u2014 a strategy that was to become common practice for Joorabchian\u2019s fund. Mascherano is said to have arrived as part of a collaboration between MSI and Global Soccer Agencies (GSA) \u2014 a firm linked to Israeli \u2018super-agent\u2019 Pini Zahavi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was around this time that Joorabchian also began working with Jorge Mendes. It was the Portuguese agent who oversaw the transfer of Nuno Assis from Vitoria Guimares to Benfica in 2005. What was seemingly a straightforward deal between two Portuguese teams was in fact significantly more complex: the \u20ac600,000 transfer fee was paid in full by MSI. The player was then registered with Dinamo Moscow, before getting loaned to Benfica. MSI were effectively trading in \u2018player futures\u2019.\n\nThe Corinthians deal came a few years before either Stan Kroenke or Alisher Usmanov bought shares in Arsenal, and Joorabchian has since admitted MSI explored the possibility of a takeover at the club before deeming it \u201cfar, far too expensive\u201d. Corinthians came cheaper, and also afforded a chance to control the South American market \u2014 not only would the club become the destination of choice for local talent, but would also be the principle point of export when it came to moving those players to Europe.\n\nEdu\u2019s career with Corinthians and Brazil would later be built on his relationship with revered manager Tite, but back in 2005 Joorabchian was less than enamoured with the coach and wanted to hire his own man. According to Brazilian media, a furious Joorabchian took the coach to task after a 1-0 derby defeat against Sao Paolo, even criticising him for choosing a player other than Tevez as penalty taker. Hours later, Tite was gone, replaced by Argentine Daniel Passarella.\n\nMSI\u2019s impact on Corinthians was initially positive: in 2005, they won their first Brazilian championship in six years. However, things soon unravelled. The partnership between Corinthians and MSI was scheduled to run for 10 years but lasted just three.\n\nCracks began to show when questions were inevitably asked about where the money was coming from. Who were MSI, the mysterious consortium Joorabchian represented? The Sao Paulo organised crime squad and the state public prosecutor instigated an inquiry which concluded there was sufficient evidence to \u201cshow that the Corinthians-MSI partnership is being used to practise the laundering of money\u201d. Controversial Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky and Georgian tycoon Badri Patarkatsishvili were identified as probable investors. Patarkatsishvili, the owner of Dinamo Tbilisi, but was best known for his aggressive attempts to assume political power in Georgia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoorabchian denied their involvement, but then-Corinthians president Alberto Dualib has since admitted to attending meetings with both men. He also named Berezovsky as an investor in Corinthians\u2019 planned stadium overhaul.\n\nMSI, Joorabchian and Dualib faced charges of money laundering, currency evasion, tax evasion and gang formation. In June 2007, the partnership was scrapped. Joorabchian was wanted for arrest, and MSI left its Brazilian offices empty and abandoned. Dualib was left to deal with the fury of the fans, who took to the streets in protest. Six months later, a debt-ridden Corinthians were relegated for the first time in their history.\n\nRemarkably, that was not the end of Joorabchian\u2019s association with Corinthians. It would be 2008 before his arrest warrant was suspended; 2014 before he was cleared of all charges. Through that period Joorabchian was less conspicuous in Brazil, but never fully out of sight.\n\nThe fall-out between Dualib and Joorabchian was significant. When Andres Sanchez rivalled Dualib for the club\u2019s presidency in 2007, Jooarabchian canvassed for the new man. \u201cHe [Joorabchian] never walked away\u201d, Dualib told Portal da Band. \u201cIn the very election that I lost, he worked for the opposition\u201d.\n\nOnce Sanchez took power, Joorabchian was back in favour. For their part, Corinthians stabilised and returned to the top flight at the end of 2008. Having done so, they made a couple of striking signings: goal-scoring legend Ronaldo, who had spent a year out of the game recovering from knee surgery, and former Arsenal and Valencia midfielder Edu Gaspar.\n\nFor Edu, this move represented a move back to the club where he had begun his professional career more than a decade before. Edu is revered in Sao Paulo \u2014 so much so that when he was robbed at gunpoint in his Brazilian home, the perpetrators paused briefly to ensure a terrified Edu signed an autograph.\n\n\u201cI was born in Corinthians,\u2019 said Edu. \u201cI started playing for Corinthians at five, I went to the first team, won important titles, was sold and then I came back and finished my career here \u2026 Corinthians is a club like no other in the world. Now, it is a rich club but it came from the poor people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was an emotional homecoming, but not an especially successful ones: a succession of injury problems limited him to just 15 Serie A appearances in a season and a half. Player and club agreed it would be best to cancel his contract and allow him to retire. Edu was only 32.\n\nAs one door closed though, another opened. A few months later, Corinthians announced Edu would succeed William Machado as sporting director.\n\nIt\u2019s here that his working relationship with Joorabchian began in earnest. In Edu\u2019s first year in charge, Corinthians were engaged in a lengthy transfer saga over none other than Joorabchian client Tevez. After Tevez allegedly refused to come on as a Manchester City substitute in a Champions League match against Bayern Munich in September 2011, Edu and Joorabchian held talks in London about a possible \u20ac20 million deal. Edu also travelled to meet Patrick Vieira, then-football development executive at City. In the end, after a significant fine and lengthy exile, Tevez chose to remain in England.\n\nNevertheless, Corinthians built an impressive team, featuring a number of known Joorabchian associates, such as future Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Paulinho. With Tite back at the helm, Corinthians won the 2011 Brazilian title.\n\nWhen they beat Boca Juniors the following June to win the Copa Libertadores, South America\u2019s equivalent to the Champions League, Joorabchian was present in the corporate seats. Later that year, they completed a historic treble by beating Chelsea 1-0 in the Club World Cup Final. As Edu stepped on to the pitch in Yokohama, Japan to join the trophy celebrations, Joorabchian is believed to again have been watching from the stands.\n\nAll the while, Joorabchian was becoming a pervasive and powerful figure across world football \u2014 including England. With Wenger\u2019s Arsenal still unwilling to do business, his London outpost was Chelsea.\n\nThe likes of Ramires, Oscar, Lucas Piazon and a certain David Luiz all wound up at Stamford Bridge, thanks to the work of Joorabchian and Brazilian business partner Giuliano Bertolucci.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoorabchian is keen to point out that, unlike Bertolucci, he is not a football agent. He styles himself as an intermediary rather than a player representative.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a football agent and I don\u2019t practise as an agent\u201d, he told The Observer in 2008. \u201cI think the agency business is very different \u2026 We also have a business that advises players on their rights. We advise them on their image, on their financial stability, we advise them on every aspect, because a lot of agents are not professional to do that. A lot of agents work for us and basically they just do the player transfer. We provide the structure, and for that they work for us\u201d.\n\nJoorabchian found himself at the heart of London\u2019s burgeoning Brazilian football community. His wife Tatiana is Brazilian, and his relationships with his clientele became social as well as professional. However, when Chelsea faced Corinthians in that Club World Cup Final, Piazon was in little doubt as to who Joorabchian would be cheering on. \u201cHe is a Corinthians fanatic,\u201d he told Trivela. \u201cHis two teams are Corinthians and Arsenal. If we play against Arsenal, he doesn\u2019t support us.\u201d\n\nJoorabchian and Edu\u2019s relationship was not always straightforward. Not every player deal born of it was deemed a success. In 2013, Corinthians consented to sign Joorabchian client Alexandre Pato from AC Milan for \u20ac15 million.\n\nHis reported \u20ac45,000 a week wages made him one of the club\u2019s highest earners. However, the move became an unmitigated disaster.\n\nHis salary and attitude put him at odds with team-mates, and the nadir arrived when he missed the decisive penalty when a Brazilian cup quarter-final against Gremio went to a shootout. With the club\u2019s place in the competition at stake, Pato went for a tame Panenka which barely got off the ground. Brazil international goalkeeper Dida fell to his side to make the simplest of saves. The incident was somehow emblematic of Pato\u2019s perceived failings: a lackadaisical attitude and a preference for style over substance. Soon after, around a hundred Corinthians ultras stormed the training ground, reportedly brandishing crowbars and singing songs about breaking Pato\u2019s legs. It\u2019s a deal Corinthians fans have since dubbed the worst in their history.\n\nEdu himself admitted the deal had been a spectacular failure: \u201cWe were all happy when he arrived \u2013 even the media was cheerful, I remind you. But he didn\u2019t have the guts that our supporters demand of any player signed by Corinthians. It\u2019s not that he should have been mean on the pitch, but to have a little bit of knife between his teeth; to think, \u2018If I\u2019m not doing well technically today I\u2019ll do it in another way, I\u2019ll use my strength\u2019.\u201d\n\nCorinthians were ultimately so desperate to get rid of Pato that Edu agreed to pay half his salary for the duration of a two-year loan with neighbours and rivals Sao Paulo. When that expired at the end of 2015, it looked as if Pato might have to return to Corinthians. However, another loan club was hurriedly secured for the next six months.\n\nArsenal were linked in the press, but Wenger flatly denied the rumours. Where could Pato possibly go? Chelsea, of course. He joined Joorabchian\u2019s Brazilian contingent at Stamford Bridge, starting only once and making two total appearances, before moving on to Spain and then China. In March, he rejoined Sao Paulo.\n\nChina was a powerful new market for Joorabchian. Just two days before Pato moved to London, a \u00a325 million deal took Ramires from Chelsea to Jiangsu Suning.\n\nIn the same month, four players left freshly-crowned Brazilian champions Corinthians for Chinese football. Roberto de Andrade, Corinthians\u2019 president, lamented that \u201cthe Chinese clubs don\u2019t even know my name\u201d. One suspects the Chinese buyers may well have been more familiar with those of Edu and Joorabchian.\n\nIn June 2016, months after making Corinthians champions again, Tite left for Brazil\u2019s national team and took Edu with him. The former midfielder spent the best part of three years with Brazil until Arsenal\u2019s head of football Raul Sanllehi began negotiations to bring him back to the club he played for from 2001-05, including the Invincibles season.\n\nDuring this past summer\u2019s transfer window, Joorabchian took the unusual step of speaking out about the club he has supported since his childhood in London. Asked to comment on the Arsenal ownership situation, he said: \u201cI feel for those guys who have just come in. They have incredible, knowledgeable people there.\n\n\u201c(Unai) Emery is a fantastic coach who has worked at Sevilla and at Paris Saint-Germain, Raul (Sanllehi) has been at Barcelona, and Edu has been at Brazil. I think finally in the backroom staff, they have people who really understand football and are football people, the question is whether or not the finances will be made available.\u201d\n\nUltimately, money was made available to spend \u2014 and a chunk of it went on signing David Luiz, a Joorabchian client.\n\nThe deal to sign the Brazil defender came about in somewhat strange circumstances. In January, with his Chelsea contract just a few months from expiring, Luiz was frustrated at only being offered a one-year extension. However, once Chelsea were placed under a two-window transfer embargo by FIFA, the club relented, and in May he signed a new contract believed to run until 2021.\n\nBarely three months later, Luiz was so keen to leave for Arsenal that he reportedly refused to train.\n\nAround this time, Arsenal were being publicly linked with a bid for another Joorabchian client, Barcelona\u2019s Philippe Coutinho. Romain Molina, a journalist who has written a book about Emery, was moved to say: \u201cKia is behind the arrival of Edu at Arsenal, so the interests of the club will follow his own, as usual.\n\n\u201cTo allow Kia to bring back the sporting director brings many risks \u2014 ask QPR, Reading (both have signed several Joorabchian clients), Corinthians. It remains to be seen whether Edu remains \u2018independent\u2019 in his choices. The past shows that Kia, Pini (Zahavi) and family have the last word.\u201d\n\nArsenal have no such concerns and are happy that they and Edu maintain full control of such decisions.\n\nIn the end, Luiz joined Arsenal on a long-term contract. It was the third time he had changed clubs on a deadline day in his last four moves.\n\nJoorabchian is once more a familiar face at the Emirates \u2014 only this time, he\u2019s welcome in the directors\u2019 box as well as the corporate seats. Sanllehi has shown himself to be amenable to working with \u2018super-agents\u2019 \u2014 or the less catchy \u2018super-intermediaries\u2019, if Joorabchian prefers.\n\nThis is already opening up new markets for Arsenal. In the summer, Arsenal signed two Brazilians, Luiz and teenage forward Gabriel Martinelli. One imagines they won\u2019t be the last. With Edu at the helm and Joorabchian in the background, there\u2019s every possibility Arsenal could displace Chelsea as the destination of choice for South American footballers in London.\n\nPerhaps Joorabchian might also help Arsenal offload some of their unwanted players. Historically, they have been poor sellers, but his contacts in China and elsewhere could provide a lucrative exit route for those deemed surplus to requirements.\n\nJoorabchian maintains an interest in Corinthians \u2014 just a few weeks ago, he was linked with a deal to broker a partnership between Corinthians and Ferroviaria, a smaller club in Sao Paulo state. However, his focus may now be shifting to London.\n\nFor a long time, Wenger\u2019s Arsenal were uncomfortable embracing some of the realities of the modern market. However, this is a new era. Sanllehi has willingly struck this Faustian pact. Arsenal have opened the door to the man who helped bring Corinthians unprecedented success and disastrous failure.\n\nHiring Edu meant welcoming Joorabchian into the Arsenal fold. For better or worse, the club may never be quite the same again."}, {"url": "https://www.skysports.com/football/news/2609759/joorabchian-claims-innocence", "page_content": "Kia Joorabchian has denied \"any wrongdoing\" over allegations of money-laundering.\n\nKia Joorabchian has denied \"any wrongdoing whatsoever\" over allegations of money-laundering.\n\nJoorabchian has reportedly been issued with an arrest warrant in Brazil as part of an investigation at Corinthians, which Media Sports Investment, Joorabchian's company, is a major investor in.\n\nHowever, Joorabchian, who represents Manchester United target Carlos Tevez, says his financial dealings are all aboveboard.\n\n\"The investigation in Brazil has been rumbling on for some considerable time and apparently involves numerous individuals including the president, club officials and partners of Corinthians Football Club,\" Joorabchian said in a statement.\n\n\"I deny any wrongdoing whatsoever. I have co-operated fully with the authorities in Brazil and have previously offered to speak to them directly, an offer that they have not taken up.\n\n\"The investigation has been provoked by the desire of a small group of individuals in Brazil to gain control over Corinthians Football Club. All payments made to Corinthians by MSI were cleared through and approved by the Brazilian Central Bank.\n\n\"My Brazilian lawyers are instructed urgently to prevent me being personally involved any longer in this dispute. I am advised, and believe this matter will be resolved very shortly.\""}]}
