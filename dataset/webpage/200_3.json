The 24-year-old, who predominantly plays as a centre-back, made 40 appearances for the Ligue 1 side last season.\n\nAlthough born in France, the uncapped Koscielny, who helped Lorient to seventh in Ligue 1 last season, would also qualify to represent Poland. The Arsenal manager, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, said: \"Koscielny is a central defender with great ability who performed extremely well last season for Lorient. We identified him as a very strong centre-half, who has made big progress very quickly. He has shown he is mentally strong, he's a fighter and a very strong competitor. Koscielny is a great addition to our squad.\"\n\nKoscielny said: \"I'm very excited to be joining Arsenal. They are one of the biggest teams in Europe with many great players. I'm really looking forward to playing in the English Premier League and the Champions League with my new club. Also, in Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Arsenal has one of the best managers in the world and I can't wait to work with him and do my best for the Arsenal supporters.\"\n\nKoscielny, who will wear the No6 shirt vacated by Philippe Senderos's move to Fulham, is scheduled to make his first appearance at the Emirates Stadium over the weekend of 31 July-1 August, when Arsenal play in the Emirates Cup with Milan, Celtic and Lyon.\n\nWenger was in need of cover in defence, with Sol Campbell considering a one-year deal and fellow veterans William Gallas and Mikael Silvestre set to leave after the end of their contracts.\n\nWenger has already signed long-term target Marouane Chamakh, the Morocco striker, to bolster the Arsenal attack, which could be missing Nicklas Bendtner ahead of their opening game of the new Premier League season at Liverpool on 15 August. Fulham's Australia international goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer has also been linked with a switch to the Emirates Stadium.\n\nWenger has been in South Africa working as a pundit for French TV, but the future of midfielder Cesc F\u00e1bregas, who is wanted by Barcelona, will be at the forefront of his mind when he returns, with the Arsenal squad heading to their Austrian training base before the Emirates Cup. Barcelona appear to be growing impatient in the pursuit of their former trainee, whose new president, Sandro Rosell, maintains will not come at any cost.\n\nRosell is due to travel to South Africa shortly, where he hopes to meet Wenger. \"It's now or never,\" he said in an interview with Sport. \"We will do it fast. It won't be protracted. I'll try to see Wenger in South Africa, then we'll tell you what happens. We would not pay the \u20ac50-60m that I have read about. If Arsenal do not go crazy, he might play at Bar\u00e7a.\"\n\nLorient have moved quickly to fill the gap left by Koscielny's departure by signing the 21-year-old Gabon international Bruno Ecuele Manga from newly promoted Angers. \"The timing is perfect. The arrival of Bruno is not a coincidence,\" the Lorient manager Christian Gourcuff said. \"We have been following him for two years and when it became known that Arsenal were interested in Laurent, we became active.\""}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jul/08/arsenal-signing-laurent-koscielny", "page_content": "Laurent Koscielny is relishing the challenge of playing in the Premier League and Champions League after his move from Lorient to Arsenal was completed yesterday. The centre-half has been on Arsenal's radar for some time, as he impressed in the French domestic league, and is understood to have cost approximately \u00a310m.\n\nKoscielny, who is eligible to play for Poland or France, is set to partner Thomas Vermaelen at the heart of the Arsenal defence, taking the No6 shirt once worn by the former captain Tony Adams and recently vacated by Philippe Senderos's departure to Fulham.\n\n\"It's true that it's a great league, physical,\" the 24-year-old said. \"It's a great honour to join such a club. It's not a small club. They have all these star players. I'll live in London and play in the Champions League.\n\n\"Arsenal isn't a club like any other. It's a very big club in Europe. I'll be training with great players, some who are still at the World Cup.\"\n\nWenger was in need of cover at the back, as Sol Campbell mulls over a new one-year deal while his fellow veterans William Gallas and Mika\u00ebl Silvestre are set to leave after the end of their contracts.\n\nCurrently at the World Cup in his role as a pundit for French television, Wenger believes Koscielny has all the attributes needed to become a successful member of the Arsenal squad seeking to end a five-year trophy drought.\n\nThe former Tours player is, meanwhile, relishing the challenge of such a step up in class. \"I will have to adapt and give everything in training to get to the level for the Premier League,\" Koscielny said. \"It's the start of a new adventure. I will give my maximum to play in the team.\"\n\nMost of Arsenal's players have now returned to the club's Hertfordshire training complex this week ahead of the traditional pre-season friendly at Barnet on 17 July, although those who have been in international action will get extra time off, with the captain Cesc F\u00e1bregas \u2013 a target for Barcelona \u2013 having joined the Dutch striker Robin van Persie in the World Cup final after Spain beat Germany.\n\nWenger has already secured the capture of his long-term target Marouane Chamakh, the Morocco striker, to bolster the Arsenal attack, which could be missing Nicklas Bendtner through injury ahead of their opening game of the new Premier League season at Liverpool on 15 August.\n\nFulham's Australia international Mark Schwarzer has been linked with a switch to the Emirates Stadium should Wenger decide he needs a more reliable pair of hands in goal next season.\n\nThe Gunners manager will waste no time on his return to England after the World Cup final, with the squad set to head out to their Austrian training base before the Emirates Cup at the end of the month.\n\nBy then, Wenger will want F\u00e1bregas's future decided one way or another, as Barcelona appear to be growing impatient in the pursuit of their former trainee \u2013 one which the new president Sandro Rosell maintains will not come at any cost."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jul/06/arsenal-laurent-koscielny", "page_content": "Arsenal are awaiting international clearance before confirming Laurent Koscielny as their player within \"hours or days\". The French centre-half has agreed personal terms on a \u20ac12m (\u00a310.1m) move from Ligue 1 club Lorient.\n\n\"The deal has not been confirmed because there are some administrative details to be validated,\" Lorient's general director, Serge Areguian, told the Guardian. \"It will be made official in the hours or days to come.\"\n\nIt is a meteoric rise for Koscielny, who was playing for the Ligue 2 side Tours as recently as last year.\n\nEven with the addition of the 24-year-old, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, the Arsenal manager, recognises his side are light in central defence, where only the Belgium international Thomas Vermaelen and Switzerland's Johan Djourou are available.\n\nArsenal have sold Philippe Senderos to Fulham, while William Gallas and Mika\u00ebl Silvestre are believed to have played their last games at the Emirates Stadium after their contracts also expired.\n\nArsenal have also been linked with Bolton Wanderers' Gary Cahill and Fulham's Brede Hangeland."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/sep/11/arsenal-bolton-wanderers-premier-league", "page_content": "It feels like years ago that Ars\u00e8ne Wenger put the scoring into boring Arsenal. His team passed a milestone here, having only a few minutes to bask in their 1,000th Premier League goal under their French tutor before swiftly moving on to number 1,001. Arsenal's lust for goals has never been the issue. Not in seasons past and not this term. It is their vague relationship with robustness that keeps the sceptics doubting whether they can be serious contenders for silverware.\n\nBolton did their utmost to expose Arsenal's famously soft centre, with Kevin Davies, at times, summoning the ghost of Sam Allardyce and those feisty battles of old \u2013 but quality prevailed. It helps to have the craft of Cesc F\u00e1bregas on your side. The Spaniard is not back to full match sharpness, but still managed to provide three assists. There was also the beginnings of a slightly stronger jaw from Arsenal. As Wenger noted afterwards: \"From the two games against Blackburn and Bolton, two years ago we would not have taken six points.\"\n\nTo the newcomers to this hurly-burly division, the Premier League is nothing if not an education. Laurent Koscielny and S\u00e9bastien Squillaci, a new partnership at the back, probably exchanged a few choice French words at the end of a game that gave them a crash course in what to expect. For young Jack Wilshere came the realisation that, in some ways, it can be less painful playing for Bolton than against them. All came through some testing moments.\n\nThe visiting contingent sang for the boy who had impressed during a loan spell with them last season, but, on the pitch, the rendezvous was less generous and Davies gave the teenager an early whack with a poor, late challenge in the centre circle. Wilshere may not be the biggest boy in the playground, but he has a tough enough streak to suggest he will not let a few hard knocks get in the way of enterprising football.\n\nHe was pivotal in Arsenal taking a 24th-minute lead, arcing a pass towards the far post for F\u00e1bregas to tuck back to Koscielny. The defender, making his first competitive appearance at the Emirates, was thrilled to mark the occasion with a poked-in goal. On his birthday weekend, how could life get any better?\n\nOh. In first-half stoppage time, Koscielny wiped the smile off his own face with a casual backpass that gifted Bolton an equaliser. The excellent Lee Chung-yong was alert to the confusion and served up a perfect lofted cross for Johan Elmander to nod in. As per usual, Arsenal's dominance came undone in a moment of defensive inertia.\n\nBolton had their young goalkeeper Adam Bogdan to thank for half-time parity. The Hungarian saved well on his debut from Andrey Arshavin, F\u00e1bregas and Tomas Rosicky. The visitors emerged into the second half determined to tussle with Arsenal on a more equal footing. Wenger must have been all knotted up to see another of his new arrivals from France struggling to adjust to Premier League pace. Marouane Chamakh was caught dithering by Gary Cahill and Bolton caught a glimpse of goal. It seemed to wake up the Moroccan striker. A thumping strike with his left foot was palmed away by Bogdan and he powered in the second with his head. Unsaveable.\n\nThe temperature rose. The home crowd bayed for a sending-off when Davies clashed heads with Koscielny, and Paul Robinson escaped even a booking for a reckless lunge that put Abou Diaby out of the game. But so curious was referee Stuart Attwell's analysis of events he brandished his red for a follow-through by Cahill on Chamakh that was far from the worst offence. Bolton's fury was compounded because they felt Lee had been fouled earlier in the move. \"It was one of the biggest free-kicks you'll ever see,\" lamented Owen Coyle, who insisted Cahill's challenge was only worthy of yellow and complained the decision spoiled a well-balanced game.\n\nThe pendulum swung towards Arsenal when Alex Song scored a landmark goal, skipping past Zat Knight and dinking the ball over Bogdan before Carlos Vela steered in at the end of a mesmerising move to give the result its gloss."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48971757", "page_content": "Koscielny joined Arsenal in 2010\n\nArsenal's Laurent Koscielny is risking his legacy at the club by refusing to travel on the pre-season tour of the US, says Gunners legend Ian Wright.\n\nThe 33-year-old France defender is out of contract at the end of next season and is a reported target for French clubs Bordeaux, Rennes and Lyon.\n\nKoscielny has made 353 appearances since joining Arsenal for \u00a310m in 2010.\n\n\"It doesn't set a good example, Arsenal need to do something quick,\" said former England striker Wright.\n\nArsenal finished fifth last season and lost the Europa League final to Chelsea in May. BBC Sport understands Arsenal's captain decided he wanted to return to his homeland in the absence of Champions League football next season.\n\nOn returning from a summer break, Koscielny informed the club of his wish to leave but Arsenal rejected the request.\n\nIn a video on his Youtube channel, external-link filmed on holiday, Wright added: \"It's the time in the season where everybody is meant to be together. We are in for a tough season, a transitional period, we need a lot of catching up.\n\n\"For our captain to refuse to go on a pre-season tour after nine years of unbelievable service, to kind of destroy your legacy a little bit in respect of refusing to play for a club that you've professed love for, is something that is baffling me.\n\n\"You're the one we chose as our captain, our leader, and now we're going into pre-season with our captain refusing to go on the tour. How do you think that looks?\n\n\"This is something I cannot get my head around. I pray to god it can be resolved sooner rather than later. Whether staying or going.

Seven minutes into Arsenal\u2019s Europa League semi-final with Atletico Madrid at the noisy Wanda Metropolitano stadium, the Frenchman collapsed away from the ball. It was his Achilles again.\n\n\"The way he went down and his hand went up in the air, and he put his head down towards the floor. I knew straight away this was a serious injury,\" said Arsenal club doctor Gary O'Driscoll.\n\nThe 33-year-old had a history of issues with his Achilles and had previously admitted in 2017 that he needed day-by-day treatment for the rest of his career.\n\nSo for Koscielny, the worst possible news became a reality in May 2018 when it was confirmed that he had ruptured his Achilles. It would rule him out for the rest of the season, but, more importantly, sideline him for France\u2019s World Cup tournament - a trophy which they would go on to win in Russia.\n\n\"It is difficult being out injured,\" Koscielny said after making his first appearance in seven months against Qarabag on Thursday night.\n\n\"It was the first big injury of my career and I had to take a long time out, but you learn a lot about yourself and I am very happy. I am focused mentally, and I can smile and enjoy the rest of the season.\"\n\nKoscielny joined Arsenal in 2010 from French side Lorient. The start of his Gunners career provided challenges but he gradually adapted to English football, eventually forming an astute defensive partnership alongside Per Mertesacker. The duo went over 20 months undefeated while playing alongside eachother and gave the team balance to go forward as they aimed for a title challenge.\n\nHe is arguably one of Arsene Wenger\u2019s best ever signings for Arsenal, joining for a fee in the region of \u00a310.5 million ($13m) and eventually developing into a Premier League defensive stalwart. He succeeded Mertesacker as Arsenal captain when the German retired from football to become the Gunners\u2019 academy chief this summer, and it is the Frenchman\u2019s leadership qualities which mean he is still a vital cog of the Arsenal squad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think for Koscielny it's good that he's recovered and I also think he recovered in a good time. Every supporter of Arsenal is happy, and also the player,\u201d said Unai Emery after the defender played 72 minutes in the Europa League.\n\nHe made one tackle and two clearances against the Azerbajani side, finishing with a 100% pass success rate.\n\nThe fans were delighted to see him back on the pitch and the reaction from the substitutes - particularly Alexandre Lacazette and Matteo Guendouzi \u2013 who charmingly helped Koscielny put his coat on when he sat back on the bench, reminded everyone at the club of the respect held for such a player.\n\nThere is certainly no sentiment afforded to players who are out with long-term injuries or struggle to come back to their best. Koscielny\u2019s seven months of intensive rehabilitation, a period where he saw his country win the World Cup without him and Arsenal sign a new centre-back in Sokratis Papastathopoulos could have been enough to affect his mentality, yet he has come out the other side and achieved the biggest goal he could have hoped for after the injury \u2013 play first-team football once again.\n\nArsenal\u2019s well-documented centre-back problems have certainly improved under Emery. While Shkodran Mustafi has his moments of inconsistency, the addition of Sokratis has proven to be a good one. Rob Holding\u2019s long-term knee injury will have served as a reminder as to how fragile a player\u2019s career can be, while Konstantinos Mavropanos is on the comeback trail with many rating him highly.\n\nDespite all those positives, it is Koscielny who remains the second longest-serving player next to Aaron Ramsey in this Arsenal team. A defender who epitomises class and professionalism both on and off the pitch.\n\nThose gruelling moments in the gym and rehabilitation centre are now over and at 33 years old, Koscielny can now grab the season by the scruff of the neck and show everyone why he has unfinished business at the top level."}, {"url": "https://www.thesportreview.com/article/laurent-koscielny-mature-physical-arsenal/", "page_content": "Laurent Koscielny believes he has developed into a \u201cmore mature and physical\u201d player since joining Arsenal three years ago.\n\nThe 26-year-old centre-half, who signed for the Gunners from Lorient in 2010, made 42 appearances for Arsene Wenger\u2019s men as the north Londoners secured a third-place finish in the Premier League last season.\n\nAnd the France international feels he has managed to adapt to the rigours of the English top flight and is keen to continue his impressive form this season.\n\n\u201cI am different because now I know the Premier League \u2013 I am more mature and more physical,\u201d Koscielny, who signed a new long-term contract with the Gunners earlier this summer, told Arsenal Player.\n\n\u201cYou know I like to be tactical and technical in my position, but I have worked hard to be fitter and stronger.\u201d\n\nArsenal have not won a trophy in the seven seasons following their FA Cup final triumph over Manchester United in 2005 \u2013 and Koscielny now has his sights firmly set on winning silverware.\n\n\u201cNow I want to continue my progression with this club.

You question his price tag. \u201cCan\u2019t believe we\u2019ve spent \u00a310 million just to sign another unknown French player.\u201d And you question the ability of the one who signed him. \u201cI think Wenger\u2019s lost it. We need a dependable established centre-back and look whom he\u2019s brought in!\u201d\n\nThese were all the questions/statements that were raised/made when he joined from Lorient in the summer of 2010. And suffice to say not one has been left unattended.\n\nWe\u2019re talking about Laurent Koscielny, the dynamic Arsenal defender. And how Arsene Wenger, despite being under such immense pressure in recent seasons, still has the innate quality to unearth a gem from places no one else\u2019s sight reaches.\n\nAnd so arrived Koscielny, with a hefty price tag of \u00a310 million (for a player of his reputation at that time). From there on, there was no looking back, and his inexorable journey from being a French third-tier player to becoming a first-choice for Arsenal and a French international is what this encomium will highlight.\n\nThe beginning of his Arsenal career was not so smooth, to put it mildly. Joe Cole, an otherwise clean player, took the responsibility of welcoming him to the league with a reckless tackle which meant he had to be carried off. Cole was shown red, and the half-time whistle was blown.\n\nThankfully, he returned in the second half only to be sent off himself for a \u2018deliberate\u2019 hand ball. The match ended with some serious questions being asked about the physical prowess of the new capture. Koscielny answered them with his actions on the field.\n\nHe slowly started getting accustomed to the league and its physical nature, and soon started receiving the plaudits for his immaculate performances. Performances which were usually marred by a mistake, every now-and-then, the most noticeable one coming in the Carling Cup final which led to Arsenal missing out on perhaps their easiest chance of ending the ever-so-hyped trophy-drought.\n\nThe media and the fans alike were quick to pounce upon him, and the tag of a talented but error-prone player was bestowed upon him. To recover from such a scarring incident shows majestic character and mental strength, something which our manager emphasises upon a lot.\n\nBut, in between his first season came a match which showed Koscielny had the weaponry in his \u2018arsenal\u2019 to make the very best look like amateurs. In the Champions League match against Barcelona, he kept Lionel Messi, a player every defender on the planet fears, in his pocket for the entire match.\n\nHis positioning was immaculate, and so was his reading of the game. He shrugged off Messi as if he was a nobody. Never had I seen Messi so helpless for the entirety of a match before this, which was enough to suggest signing Laurent was the biggest magic trick Arsene had pulled off in recent years.\n\nHe still lacked consistency to be considered amongst the top defenders in England. But such has been the progress of the player, he now is, in my humble opinion, one of the very best ball-playing defenders Europe currently has.\n\nHis countless interceptions and last-ditch tackles is second to none and his stats show nothing to suggest otherwise. He also possesses the knack of scoring goals at the other end with the ones against Man City, Bayern, Newcastle and West Brom(2011-12 season) showing how vital they\u2019ve been.\n\nTo put it in one line, he\u2019s a calm player having very nimble feet, who anticipates the game shrewdly, is tenacious and fearless in a tackle, is expeditious in possession and a defensive stalwart who\u2019s managed to add consistency to his game with persistent hard work.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why Tony Adams says, \u201cHe reminds me a lot of Martin Keown. He\u2019s very tenacious. I hate labelling people because Martin Keown was one of the best we\u2019ve ever had. To put Koscielny in the same category(of Keown) is an enormous compliment I think.\u201d\n\nAnd that reason is why he has become one of the most important(yet hugely underrated) players at the club within the span of three years, and rigorously pursued by Barcelona and Bayern in this transfer market. And that reason is why this article pays a tribute to one of the best \u201crags to riches\u201d story of modern times.\n\nPaul Merson predicts the result of Man City vs Inter UEFA Champions League final!

Last year we had Laurent, Petr Cech and Aaron Ramsey.\n\n\u2018At the moment Koscielny has a contract with us but we\u2019ll speak with the club and him about if he will continue or not.\n\n\u2018We have players with the capacity [to be captain], one is Granit, he was a captain in the dressing room. We have others like Mesut, Nacho.\n\n\u2018There are other players who can take this position also.
