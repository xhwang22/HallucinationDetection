Chicago had to beat out a number of other cities to get the fair.\n\nIn the late 1880s, Chicago, St. Louis, New York and Washington, D.C. all submitted bids to host the 1893 fair, but the race was soon narrowed to New York and Chicago. Big Apple financial titans including Cornelius Vanderbilt, William Waldorf Astor and J. P. Morgan pledged to raise $15 million to cover the city\u2019s expenses, with Chicago\u2019s mercantile and meatpacking millionaires Marshall Field, Philip Armour and Gustavus Swift following suit. But when Lyman Gage, president of one of the largest banks in the Midwest, arranged for millions more in financing, momentum swung Chicago\u2019s way and the U.S. Congress, which was in charge of the selection, awarded the city the exposition.\n\n2. Unbeknownst to festival-goers, there was a mass murderer in their midst.\n\nChicago was home to a serial killer during the fair. For several years before and during the exposition, Herman Mudgett, aka H.H. Holmes, was busily luring victims (including a number of fairgoers) to a three-story, block-long building, later known as the \u201cMurder\u201d Castle, where they were tortured, mutilated and killed. Although Holmes\u2019 heinous crimes weren\u2019t discovered until after the fair ended, it\u2019s believed that he was responsible for dozens of deaths in Chicago, and may have killed as many as 200 people nationwide before his murderous spree ended with his 1894 arrest. Holmes quickly became a celebrity, and was paid more than $200,000 in today\u2019s money to pen accounts of his crimes for the Hearst newspaper chain.\n\n3. Another murder also made headlines.\n\nOn October 28, just two days before the exposition was set to close, Chicago\u2019s recently re-elected mayor, Carter Harrison Sr., was shot and killed by a disgruntled\u2014and deranged\u2014office seeker, Patrick Eugene Prendergast, who believed he was owed a political appointment by the mayor. With the city in shock, the fair\u2019s organizers quickly decided to cancel the lavish closing ceremony in favor of a public memorial to the city\u2019s popular slain leader.\n\n4. The fair produced a number of firsts.\n\nAmong the well-loved commercial products that made their debut at the Chicago World\u2019s Fair were Cream of Wheat, Juicy Fruit gum and Pabst Blue Ribbon beer. Technological products that would soon find their way into homes nationwide, such as the dishwasher and fluorescent light bulbs, had early prototype versions on display in Chicago as well.\n\nThe U.S. government also got in on the act, issuing the country\u2019s first postcards and commemorative stamps and two new commemorative coins: a quarter and half dollar. The half dollar featured Christopher Columbus, in whose honor the fair had been staged, while the quarter depicted Queen Isabella of Spain, who had funded Columbus\u2019 voyages\u2014making it the first U.S. coin to honor a woman.\n\n5. A Ferris wheel saved the fair from financial ruin.\n\nDespite the money raised by private investors and the U.S. government,, squabbling amongst the organizers and numerous construction delays resulted in a huge budget deficit. Another costly mistake was the refusal to allow showman William \u201cBuffalo Bill\u201d Cody and his troupe of sharpshooters, cowboys and Native American performers to appear at the fair. A disgruntled Cody brought his Wild West extravaganza to Chicago anyway, setting up shop right outside the fairgrounds and siphoning off visitors.\n\nThe fair\u2019s precarious finances received a boost in June 1893 with the long-awaited debut of a new invention from Pittsburgh-based bridge builder and steel magnate George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. Intended to rival the highlight of the 1889 fair in Paris (the Eiffel Tower), Ferris\u2019 264-foot-tall wheel was an engineering marvel. It could fit 2,160 people at a time, and cost 50 cents to ride\u2014twice the price of a ticket to the fair itself. The world\u2019s first Ferris wheel proved so popular it was moved to Chicago\u2019s North Side, where it remained in operation for 10 years before it was sold to the organizers of the 1904 World\u2019s Fair in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\n6. It was the first exposition to have national pavilions.\n\nNearly 50 foreign countries and 43 states and territories were represented in Chicago. American pavilions touted the country\u2019s diverse history, food and culture with exhibits like Virginia\u2019s replica of George Washington\u2019s Mount Vernon estate, a century-old palm tree from California, a massive stained glass display by Louis Comfort Tiffany and a full-service Creole restaurant from Louisiana. Philadelphia even sent the Liberty Bell, as well as two replicas: one in rolled oats and one made of oranges. Not to be outdone, Norway sailed a full-sized replica of a Viking ship across the ocean for the fair, and German industrial giant Krupp spent the equivalent of more than $25 million in today\u2019s money to mount a massive artillery display including a number of weapons that would later be used in World War I.\n\n7. The Chicago World\u2019s Fair played a key role in the creation of the City Beautiful movement.\n\nAt the core of the fair was an area that quickly became known as the White City for its buildings with white stucco siding and its streets illuminated by electric lights. Buildings and monuments by Charles McKim, Daniel Burnham, Augusts Saint-Gaudens and Richard Morris Hunt, along with lush landscaping by Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of New York\u2019s Central Park, left a lasting impression on municipal planners looking for a way to bring open spaces and grand public buildings into crowded cities. Chicago itself was one of the first cities to adopt aspects of the new City Beautiful movement. Dozens of other cities across the country followed its lead, most notably Washington, D.C., where by 1902, plans were in place for a redesign of the city center that would result in the creation of the National Mall."}, {"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Harrison,_Sr.", "page_content": "Carter Henry Harrison, Sr. (February 15, 1825 \u2013 October 28, 1893) was an American politician who was mayor of Chicago from 1879 until 1887; he was elected to a fifth term in 1893 but was assassinated before completing his term.\n\nHe previously served two terms in the United States House of Representatives.

It has looked upward to it and knows nothing that it fears to attempt and thus far has found nothing that it cannot accomplish.\u201d\u2014Mayor Carter H. Harrison, October 28, 1893\n\nNew York Times, October 29, 1893\n\n\n\nThe Assassin\u2019s Life Saved by the Prompt Action of Pollce In Getting Him Away Before the Excited Crowd Around Mayor Harrison\u2019s Residence Recognized Him\u2014Several Shots Fired by the Assassin at His Victim. Who Was Taken Completely by Surprise\u2014The Mayor\u2019s Last Day on Earth Passed at the World\u2019s Fair Entertaining the Mayors of Other Cities\u2014The Dead Man Was to Have Been Married to a Louisiana Lady Next Week\u2014His Life Ends Almost Simultaneously with the Exposition Which He DId So Much to Aid\u2014Witnesses of the Brutal Murder, and No Inmate of the House but a Waiting Maid Saw the Assassin\u2014Mr. Harrison\u2019s Career as Editor and PolIticIan.\n\nCHICAGO, Oct. 28.-Carler Henry Harrison, Mayor of Chicago, was shot at his residence, 231 Ashland Boulevard. at 8:07 o\u2019clock to-night. and died at 8:47 o\u2019clock.\n\nHis murderer was a disappointed office-seeker named Eugene Patrick Prendergast, who obtained admittance to the Mayor\u2019s home in the guise of a visitor.\n\nThe assassin gave himself up at the Desplaine Street Police Station half an hour later, and was taken in charge by the police and spirited away to some unknown place to prevent any possible attempt by a mob to lynch him.\n\nMayor Harrison had been at the fair during the day to attend. the celebration of American Cities. He returned to his residence at 5 o\u2019clook very weary. the exercises at the Fair Grounds having taxed his energies to their utmost. Dinner was served at 6 o\u2019clook, and after the repast the Mayor retired to the back parlor and lay down on a couch. with the remark that he would take a rest, but that he was to be awakened if any person called or any message was received for him. He fell into a\n\npeaceful sleep.\n\nSoon after 8 o\u2019clock the door bell rang, and the maidservant answered it. She found at the door a small-sized, weazen-faced. smooth-shaven man. who asked if the Mayor was at home. In reply to the maid\u2019s interrogatory, he gave his name as Prendergast. As the name was a familiar one to the maid. she admitted the man to the hall way and closed the door. She then went to the rear parlor where the Mayor was sleeping and awoke him. He did not at once enter the hall where Prendergast was waiting, and the maid had returned to tne servants\u2019 quarters in the basement of the house before the tralledy occurred.\n\nCarter H. Harrison residence\n\n231 Ashland Boulevard\n\nThe house is an old-fashioned double brick, with a hall through the centre, on either side of which various rooms open. From the direction taken by the maidservant when she announced him, Prendergast, who was waiting in the hall, knew in which of the rooms the Mayor was. He apparently grew impatient at the delay, and before the Mayor appeared he had started toward the rear of the hall, intending, in all probability. to enter the room, but just as he was approaching the door the Mayor appeared through the doorway.\n\nPrendergast then delibera.tely placed a large-sized revolver close to the Mayor\u2019s body and fired. The shot struck the Mayor in the abdomen, and. he reeled and fell backward, catching at the side of the doorway as he fell. As he was falling the assassin fired a second time, the bullet striking the Mayor just above the ear. The murderer surveyed his work for an instant, and then fired a tnird time at the prostrate body of his victim. The shot this time struok Mr. Harrison in the left hand.\n\nThe three sbots were all fired as quickly as it was possible with the heavy thirty-eight-calibre revolver which Prendergast had in his hand, and before the other peopie in the house could get to the Mayor\u2019s assistance his murderer turned and fled through the hall out the door, down the long walk between the lawns to the gate and out on Ashland Avenue.\n\nAs he ran down the walk to the street, the gardener who had been aroused by the shooting. ran around the side of the house and tried to overtake him. Prendergast saw his danger from this source, and as he ran fired a shot over his shoulder at his pursuer. It went wide of its mark. but it was effective in keeping the gardener at a distance. The murderer was able to make his escape into the darkness.\n\n\u2013\n\nHe ran away at this time in order to avoid being killed by those who were attracted by the shooting. for half an hour later he gave himself up at the Desplaines Street Police Station.\n\nSergt, Frank McDonald was just receiving over the telephone the news of the Mayor\u2019s death. when he was interrupted by the exclamation,\n\nI am the man who did the shooting!\n\nSergt. McDonald started at the appearance of the man. but he qniokly asked bim to stop inside the railing. The man did so. He was trembling with excitement, but to all appearances, except for the agitation, was perfectly sane. He repeated the remark that he had made on entering the station, to those who quickly gathered about him, he said:\n\nI killed Mayor Harrison!\n\n\n\nI worked hard for him during his campaign for the Mayor, and he promised to make me Corporation Counsel He was elected. but he failed to keep his promise, and I have shot him because he didn\u2019t do as he said he would.\n\nPrendergast still carried in his hand the revolver with which he shot the Mayor. It was taken from him by Sergt. McDonald. He appeared to be about twenty-five years old, about 5 feet 7 inches in height, and of slight build.\n\nThe police officers at the station were afraid that as soon as the cause of the Mayor\u2019s death became generally known a mob would collect to avenge him. Prendergast was therefore not placed in a cell at the Desplaines Street Station, but in charge of four policemen was taken in a carriage to another part of the city and locked up to await the judicial inqUirY into his rash act.\n\nThere were no eye witnesses of the brutal, cold-blooded murder. In the house at the time were Preston Harrison, the Mayor\u2019s youngest son; Sophie Harrison. his daughter; the butler, and three maid servants. Preston Harrison and his sister were in the upper part of the house. The servants were all below stairs, the maid who answered the bell being the only person of those in the house ut the time who caught sight of the murderer. Preston Harrisou was the first to reach the side of his father.\n\n\n\nOn his way down stairs Preston Harrison rang the police call twice. The shots made him aware that some desperate deed had been oonsUlnmated. but he did not know as he called the police that he was summoning them to look for the murderer of his own father. He was overcome by horror and grief, but he immediately went up stairs. where he met his sister Sophie, who was preparing to descend, and gently forced her back to her room, where, with as much care as .was possible, he told her of the awful fate of her father.\n\nW. J. Chalmers of 234 Ashland Boulevard. who was standing at the door of his house, directly opposite the Mayor\u2019s residence, heard the shooting. and calling to his wife that there was trouble over the way, he quickly ran across the street in time to Eee the assassin make his escape. He entered the house and met Preston Harrison just as the young man advanced to the doorway in which the prostrate form of the Mayor lay.\n\nLife was rapidly ebbing away. Blood was flowing freely from the three wounds in the Mayor\u2019s body, and the carpet beneath him was saturated with it. The two men picked Mr. Harrison up and carried him to the couch from which he had arisen to meet his murderer.\n\nMr. Harrison said:\n\nI am shot. Preston, and cannot live. Where is Annie?\n\nMr. Harrison hastily left his father\u2019s side and rushed out upon the street in pursuit= of the assassin. In the meantime Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Chalmers. who live across the street, had started for the Harrison residence, as they had heard the shooting. They saw a man running up Ashland avenue and met tho son Preston in pursuit. Young Mr. Harrison stopped long enough to inform his neighbors of the terrible affair and then started in pursuit of the murderer. Mr. and Mrs. Chalmers hastily entered the house, Mr. Chalmers at once making a pillow of his oyercoat which he placed nnder Mr. Harrison\u2019s head.\n\n\u201cI have been shot and oannot live,\u201d said tbe Mayor, as he gasped for breath.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t die.\u201d said Mr. Chalmers.\n\n\u201cYou have only been shot in the abdomen.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I have beeu shot in the heart and I know I cannot live.\u201d was the reply.\n\nThose were the last words of Mayor Harrison.\n\nNeighbors gathered about the doorway in great numbers. Only a few of these were admitted to tho house. Thoae within were anxiously waiting the appearance of one other woman, who in a short time was to have become the bride of the man who was at that moment in the throes of death.\n\nMiss Howard hat! been here for several days. She was to have been married to Mayor Harrison Nov. 7 at Biloxi, .Miss., her home. When in this city sho has always visited at the Mayor\u2019s house, and. the two became very much attached to each other. The attachment ripened into love, and early this Summer the engagement was announced. Extensive arrangements were under way for a splendid wedding. A special train was to have borne the party to Biloxi. and fetes were prepared there for their entertainment. Miss Howard came here at this time to finish the preparation of her trousseau. She was to have returned to Biloxi early next week. As usual. she visited at the Mayor\u2019s house, which is presided over by Mrs. Carter H. Harrison, Jr. Miss Howard left tho house after dinner in company with Mr. Carter H. Harrison, Jr. They returned together, but Miss Howard was the first to enter the house. She did so between the files of sympathetic neighbors who had gathered about the house.\n\n\n\nThe unusual crowd and the serious faces of the people in it prepared the two women for some dreadful catastrophe. But up to the time they entered the doorway they had no hint of the real trouble. It would have taken a very callous person to have breathed the story of the crime into their ears at such a time. It was left for the members of the family to break the news. Miss Howard and Mrs. Harrison were met by Preston Harrison at the door, and guided up stairs out of reach of those who had gathered 1n the house. There they were informod of what had taken place. Miss Howard\u2019s grief was pitiable, and Mrs. Harrison fainted away.\n\nNeither Miss Sophie Harrison. Miss Howard, Mrs. Carter Harrison, Jr., nor Carter H. Harrison, Jr., saw Mr. Harrison alive after dinner. Carter H. Harrison. Jr. was down town, and did not return home until the news of his father\u2019s death reached him through the rumors which speedily went flying over the city. Miss Howard and Mrs. Harr1son did not reach the house until after Mayor Harrison had passed away.\n\nThere was the greatest oxcitement all over the city when the news of the murder was bruited about. It raged most hotly in the throng which filled the grounds about the Mayor\u2019s house. This nearly resulted in the lynching of an innocent man. R. Earle Smith, a young wan living at 359 Ashland Avenue. was passing the Mayor\u2019s house just as Prendergast paased in. He noticed Pendergast, and wondered if the man were a politician or somebody who was helping the Mayor in his preparations for his approaching wedding. Just after Mr. Smith had passed the house, he heard two shots, and he felt at once that= the man whom he had seen enter the Mayor\u2019s residence was responsible. He quickly made up his mind to lie in wait for him. and catch him as he came out.\n\nWith this end in view, Smith entered a clump of lilac bushes which adorn the grounds in front of the house on eaeh side of the path leading up to the door. When Prendergast appeared at the door, after killing Mayor Harrison, and ran down the path, Smith sprang from the buahes and attempted to grapple with him.\n\nPrendergast eluded his grasp and, jumping over the fence, ran down Ashland Avenue toward Adams Street. Smith ran after him and followed him as the murderer turned down Adams Street. Smith says that just as be tUrned the corner of Adams Street two more shots were fired in the house. and he turned back, as it seemed impossible for him to cat.ch Prendergast, to see what new trouble was brewing in the ill fated mansion. As he turned into the grounds on his return,. the butler pointed a revolver at him and commanded him to surrender\n\n\n\nSmith tried to explain who he was, but the butler cried out:\n\nHere is the murderer!\n\nThose who ran up took up the cry, and in an instant Smith was surrounded by an angry mob, which, in addition to handling him roughly. threatened him with lynching.\n\nThe police patrol walton which came up in response to Preston Harrison\u2019s call brought several policllmen, one of whom arrested Mr. Smith in spite of his vehement statement that he was only trying to catch the murderer. The policeman finally led\n\nMr. Smith to tho house, where he was readily identified as a neighbor, and his\n\nrelease. of course, followed.\n\nWhen Prendergast was removed from the Desplaines 8treet Police Station he was conveyed in a carriage to the Central Police Station in the City Hall. Here he was taken in charge by Inspector Shea, who at once proceeded to catechise him as to the incidents leading up to the crime.\n\nPrendergast said that he made up his mind to kill the Mayor yesterday. He went out on Milwaukee Avenue and purchased a second-hand revolver at a pawn shop for $5. The revolver was a five-shooter. At 8 o\u2019clock, as nearly as he could remember, he went to the Mayor\u2019s house and rang the bell.\n\n\n\nHow many shots did you fire?\n\n\n\nI fired three shots. That was enough. There was another in the gun.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat is your full name?\n\n\n\nPatrick Eugene Joseph Prendergast. My mother is a good, innocent woman. She lives over at 609 Jane Streut, west of Seymour. We used to live at 357 Ohio Street.\n\n\n\nDid you ever go to school?\n\n\n\nYes. I\u2019m a good Catholic. I studied at St. Patrick\u2019s School. I know a good many big men. Now, there is Archbishop\u2014 \u2014, I forgot his name.\n\n\n\nWhat happened there?\u201d asked the Inspector.\n\n\n\nI told the girl who came to the door that I wanted to see the Mayor. She asked me for my name and I gave it to her, and told her I had particular business with the Mayor.\n\n\n\nWhat happened then?\n\n\n\nWhy the girl went in and told Mr. Harrison that I wanted to see him.\n\n\n\nAnd then?\n\n\n\nI shot him. I didn\u2019t say a word to the Mayor, nor he to me. I shot him and I was justified in doing it.\n\n\n\nBut what did you have against the Mayor?\n\n\n\nI made up my mind to shoot him, and I had some difficulty in doing it. The Mayor failed to fulfill his promise to me to elevate the tracks!\n\n\n\nWhat happened when the Mayor came to the door?\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t remember exactly. I came out and ran away. Men chased me. I jumped on a street car and rode down to Desplaines Street Station. I walked in to the Sergeant\u2019s desk and said, \u2018I have killed the Mayor.\u2019\n\n\n\nWho are your relatives?\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve got one brother John. He\u2019s a clerk in the Post Office. My mother and I used to live at 357 Ohio Street.\n\n\n\nWhere do you work?\n\n\n\nI work as a distributor for The Morning Inter Ocean and Evening Post. I am employed by the city circulators of these these papers. J. H. Johnson is the circulator of the Inter Ocean.\n\n\n\nHow old are you?\n\n\n\nWhy, I\u2019m twenty-five. I think I was justified in shooting the Mayor. If I get a fair trial before a fair jury I\u2019ll be acquitted.\n\n\n\nHave you ever studied law?\n\n\n\nNo, I have never studied or practiced. I just put that pistol in my pocket and went over and shot the Mayor.\n\nAt frequent intervals the prisoner squirmed unoasily in his chair and refused for a moment to proeeed. He is a smooth-faced, hollow-cheeked, weak-looking young man, the most prominent feature of his face being a protruding under lip. His whole appearance indicated a depraved and vicious mind. His nose is sharp and crooked, and his hair cut short, sparsely covers his misshapen head.\n\nThe Mayor took a prominent part in the endeavor to provide employment for the unemployed during the exceedingly dull season of last Summer. He did everything in his power to advance the work on municipal improvements in order that the laborers out of work might be provided with employment cleaning the streets, constructing sewers, and laying gas and water mains. At the meetings of the Commmitte of Two Hundred, whioh was appointed by him to take charge of the entire matter of furnishing food and employment for the unemployed, he was found to be alive to the interests of the poor people of the city, fertile in suggestion, and solicitous that the work of relief and of furnishing employment might be begun without delay. Many of the suggestions which were adopted by the committee with such success were made by him.\n\nThe social duties of the Mayor in connection with the World\u2019s Fair duting the entire Summer have been many and exacting, but through them all he carried himself with a dignity and frankness of spirit and action which won him the respect of Chicago\u2019s guests from abroad and the approval of her citizens. One of the first of these was the reception of and entertainmcnt for some days of the Duke of Veragua and his suite. At public functions as well as in the privacy of his own beautiful home on Ashland Boulevard. Mayor Harrison did his share to make the visit of the descendant of Columbus at the World\u2019s Fair a pleasant one.\n\nOn another notable occasion the Mayor also did the honors as the head of a great city in a wav Which left no cause for complaint. This was on the occasion of the reception and entertainment of the= Spanish Infanta. Mayor Harrison\u2019s gallantry was given full expression on all of the public and private functions at which he appeared as the representative of the city which was entertaining the Princess. In connection with the receptions of prominent people and special days at the World\u2019s Fair, Mayor Harrison was called upon to make some forty speeches, and was always in the best of humor, and his speeches were uniformly well received, though they were often criticized.\n\nIllustrations of Assassination of Chicago\u2019s Mayor Harrison from Harper\u2019s Weekly November 11, 1893, From Sketches by Charles Mente and T. Dart Walker.\n\nIllustrations of Mayor Harrison\u2019s Funerals Mayor Harrison from Chicago Tribune November 2, 1893.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcerpted from Chicago Tribune July 14, 1894\n\n\n\nPatrick Eugene Prendergast has paid the penalty of his life for the murder of Carter Henry Harrison. At 11:48 o\u2019clock yesterday morning the trap of the gallows fell from beneath his trembling feet and the rope put an end to his wretched life. He made no speech. He did not speak a word from the time the death march started from the room where he had passed his last night on earth, save for a whispered sentence to the black robed priest who stood beside him on the scaffold. Aside from the trembling of his limbs and the deep breaths which ended in gasps there was no sign from him to show he feared the end.\n\nHis death must have been without pain, as his neck was broken by the fall of six feet and there was not a perceptible movement after the trap was sprung. A jury of physicians occupied two benches just in front of the gallows. When the trap fell County Physician Fortner, who headed the jury, stood beside the shrouded body to determine when life had become extinct. There was a wait of five minutes when the other physicians were called to aid in the examination. His pulse continued to beat for almost ten minutes, then the last flutter ceased and Prendergast was pronounced dead. Another five minutes was passed and then the rope\u2019s end was loosened, the body lowered into a waiting coffin, and all was over. The law had taken its course.\n\nPrendergast Verdict\n\nDecember 29, 1893\n\nPrendergast\u2019s brother appealed the sentence, saying that Eugene was insane. The attorney for the appeal was not-yet-famous Clarence Darrow. It was Darrow\u2019s first murder case\u2013and the only one he ever lost to the executioner. The appeal was denied, and Eugene Prendergast was hanged on July 13, 1894.\n\nFour years after Harrison\u2019s murder, his son\u2013also named Carter Harrison\u2013became mayor of Chicago. Like his father, the younger Harrison would be elected to the office five times.\n\nNOTE:\n\nThe two times that Chicago held a world\u2019s fair, both times the mayor was shot and killed.\n\nAlmost forty years later, in an attempt to kill President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt, Chicago Mayor, Anton Cermak was shot and killed during a yachting event in Miami, on February 21, 1933, just a few months before the opening of the Century of Progress World\u2019s Fair.

Harrison was the first cousin twice removed of President William Henry Harrison.\n\nBorn near Lexington, Kentucky to Carter Henry Harrison II and Caroline Russell, he was only a few months old when his father died. He was educated by private tutors, and was graduated from Yale College in 1845 as a member of Scroll and Key. Following graduation, he traveled and studied in Europe from 1851 to 1853 before entering Transylvania College in Lexington, where he earned a law degree in 1855. He was admitted to the bar in 1855 and commenced practice in Chicago; Harrison came to Chicago because he saw it as a land of opportunity.\n\nHarrison ran an unsuccessful campaign in 1872 for election to the Forty-third Congress. Beginning in 1874, he served as a member of the board of commissioners of Cook County. He was elected as a Democrat to the Forty-fourth and Forty-fifth Congresses, and delegate to the 1880 and 1884 Democratic National Conventions.\n\nA Summer's Outing\n\nIn 1890, Harrison and his daughter took a vacation trip from Chicago to Yellowstone National Park and Alaska. His letters from the trip were first published in the Chicago Tribune and later compiled into the book (1891): A Summer's Outing and The Old Man's Story.\n\nAssassination\n\nThe night of the Haymarket Riot in 1886, Harrison walked unmolested through the crowd of anarchists and advised the police to leave the demonstrators alone. The riot was sparked by a bomb, reportedly thrown at police by anarchists. After leaving office, Harrison was owner and editor of the Chicago Times from 1891 to 1893. He was re-elected in 1893, in time for the World's Columbian Exposition. His desire was to show the world the true Chicago, and he appointed 1st Ward Alderman \"Bathhouse\" John Coughlin to sit on the reception committee. On October 28, 1893, two days before the close of the Exposition, Harrison was murdered in his home by Patrick Eugene Prendergast, a disgruntled office seeker. Harrison was buried in Chicago's Graceland Cemetery. Prendergast was hanged on July 13, 1894. Harrison was Chicago's first five-time elected mayor; eventually his son, Carter Harrison, Jr., was also elected mayor five times.\n\nHarrison's career and assassination are closely connected with the World's Columbian Exposition, and are discussed at some length as a subplot to the two main stories (about the fair and serial killer H. H. Holmes) in The Devil in the White City. The celebration of the close of the Exposition was cancelled in lieu of a large public memorial service for Harrison."}, {"url": "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Harrison-7632", "page_content": "Carter Henry Harrison Sr.\n\n15 Feb 1825 in Fayette County, Kentucky, United States Bornin\n\nAncestors\n\n[sibling(s) unknown]\n\nSophonisba (Preston) Harrison Husband of\u2014 married 12 Apr 1855 in Henderson County, Kentucky\n\nMargaret (Stearns) Harrison Husband of\u2014 married after 1877 [location unknown]\n\nDescendants\n\n28 Oct 1893 at age 68 in Chicago, Illinois, United States Diedin\n\nProfile last modified 19 Feb 2022 | Created 19 Aug 2015\n\nThis page has been accessed 1,179 times.\n\nPreceded by\n\n28th Mayor\n\nMonroe Heath\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n32nd Mayor\n\nHempstead Washburne Carter H.

Carter Henry Harrison\u2019s great grandmother Susannah Randolph was a descendant of Pocahontas. What is remarkable, however, is that in Carter Henry Harrison\u2019s family line one finds a signator of the Declaration of Independence, and two U.S. Presidents. Carter Henry Harrison\u2019s great uncle, Benjamin Harrison not only signed the Declaration of Independence, but also introduced a resolution of independence to congress. One of Benjamin Harrison\u2019s sons, William Henry Harrison went on to become President of the United States in 1841, and President Harrison\u2019s great grandson Benjamin Harrison became President of the United States in 1889.\n\nWhile Carter Henry Harrison Senior\u2019s father\u2019s side was noted for its politicians, his mother\u2019s side was distinguished for its soldiers. Carter Henry Harrison Senior\u2019s mother was Caroline Evalind, whose father, grandfather, and great grandfather were all notable soldiers in their time. Her great grandfather was an officer in the English Army, her grandfather was General William Russell famous for fighting the Indian Wars, and her father Colonel Russell, a cavalry captain, is credited for leading the attack in the Revolutionary War Battle, King\u2019s Mountain.\n\nCarter Henry Harrison Senior was born February 15th, 1825 to Carter Henry Harrison II and Caroline Evalind. Although, Carter Henry Harrison Senior is known as \u201csenior,\u201d he is technically the III in his family to bear the name. He grew up in Elk Hill, Kentucky in a log cabin. His father died, shortly after his birth, and his mother schooled him until he was 15. At this time, he went to Lexington to study under Dr. Lewis Marshall who was the brother of Supreme Court Justice Thomas Marshall. In 1845 he began attending Yale, and after graduating at age 20, studied law at Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. After one year of law school, however, he decided to return home to live the life of a farmer on his family\u2019s plantation. In 1851, Harrison traveled Europe for two years where he began to develop an affinity for urban life. When he returned to the states he finished his law degree and graduated in 1853. The same year he married Sophonisba Preston and moved first to St. Louis and then finally to Chicago.\n\nAlthough Harrison intended to open a law office, he became involved in buying and selling real estate. However, a financial storm in 1857 affected him terribly and Harrison spent the next ten years trying to get on his feet financially. During this time, five of his children died in infancy.\n\nIn an attempt to move away from real-estate, Harrison made an unsuccessful attempt at running for the lower house of the State legislature, but it was not until the great Chicago Fire in 1871 that the catalyst for Harrison\u2019s life as politician would emerge. Harrison\u2019s support for the \u201cfire proof ticket,\u201d a ticket composed of both Democratic and Republican nominations for city offices, gained him a nomination and election as County Commissioner. After serving a three-year term as County Commissioner, Harrison decided to run again for congress. He was narrowly elected as the Democratic Representative for 44th National Congress, in March of 1875. Harrison quickly developed a reputation as a skilled orator, and was re-elected for a second term. During his re-election campaign his wife died suddenly of illness and Harrison immersed himself in his work. He served in congress until the end of his second term in 1878, and chose not to seek a third term. Harrison would lament later in life that he never fully enjoyed the life of a congressman. Harrison did not abandon statesmanship all together; in fact, he barely missed a beat. In the spring of 1879, Harrison was elected to be the mayor of Chicago.\n\nHarrison was elected to the office of mayor five times, serving from 1879-1887 and then again in 1893.. The time that Harrison served in office was a time of expansion and development for Chicago. When Harrison arrived in Chicago in 1855 the public revenue for taxation was slightly over $200,000; by the time of his death this number exceeded $15,000,000. Harrison was known, however, as a champion of people\u2019s rights. With railroads being built from one end of Chicago to the other, Harrison continually fought for workers\u2019 rights against the railroad companies that tried to usurp them. Harrison\u2019s commitment to the public is epitomized by his role in the Haymarket Riot. The night of March 4th, 1886 an unknown person threw a bomb at police officers during a workers\u2019 strike organized by local socialist party members. Harrison was quick to speak out against anti-socialist language in the media, not only saying that socialists did not sympathize with the bomb throwers, but also asserting that socialists represented the \u201cworkers, thinkers, and writers\u201d of the United States.\n\nHarrison made an unsuccessful bid for Governor of Illinois in 1884, and was only narrowly re-elected to his 4th term as mayor; he stepped down at the end of that term. Harrison decided he wanted to get back in public life, however, and ran for the mayorship unsuccessfully in 1891. Not to be easily dissuaded, however, he ran again, and was re-elected in 1893 in time to host the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. His term, however, was cut short by assassination. Two days before the World Fair opened, on October 28th, 1893, failed politician Patrick Eugene Prendergast killed Carter Henry Harrison in Harrison\u2019s home. Earlier that day Harrison had announced in a speech \u201cI intend to live for more than half a century! And at the end of that half century London will tremble lest Chicago shall surpass her.\u201d Carter Henry Harrison Senior was the first Chicago Mayor to serve five terms; the next Mayor of Chicago to serve as long a term, was his son Carter Henry Harrison II.\n\nNext: Johnny Powers\n\nSources:\n\nAbbot, Willis John.
