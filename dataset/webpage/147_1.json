Clearly 'The Mummy Retourns' doesn't lie about being a lame sequel of the first movie. There are several metajokes about it in here. So don't expect the scenario to be different. I had no expectation for it but still got pretty surprised.\n\n\n\nSpecial effects seem to be a big deal in this movie. I found they were very good at the beginning but yeah, not far from becoming more and more disgusting as the plot moves on. The more we get to the end, the more we witness surrealistic scenes. And there are numerous false connections. Characters don't stop to fast-travel even when they are in the same room. These facts tend to make me dislike 'The Mummy Returns'.\n\n\n\nDialogues remains as dumb and lifeless as in the first opus. Characters spend their time explaining the plot, reminding us who each protagonist is, trying to problematize the movie, emphazing the ridiculous drama of the situation. The kid specially is awful: his presence is the reason to showcase silly situations and lines. The couple Rick + Evelyn is terrible. They tried to make them seem like accomplices but it doesn't match at all. They spend their onscreen time kissing and licking each other. Each and every Evelyn appearance seems to be an occasion to make her look and sound hot and horny. At this point it is pretty lear to me that Sommers had some major fantasies about hot female archaeologists. His movie jus was not the best place to underline it. Evy's brother which I found terrific in the first movie is here one of the silliest and repelling character of all. He is just so one-dimensional, and his jokes always fall apart.\n\n\n\nI have to admit though that this movie was highly entertaining. There are some fast-paced action scenes, some characters are well developped, and it becomes funny to see until which point were Sommers ready to go in order to surprise the spectator. It however felt endless. Let's watch it as a historical event of our times: it is the very first appearance of Dwayne Johnson in a movie. (At this point he iss still very close to be the most over-paid actor in the industry... Funny to witness him making his debut as CGI poorly-animated scorpion king heh !) \u2026 Expand"}, {"url": "https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/lucy_akhurst/", "page_content": "Credits\n\nAll mediums TV Radio Film All roles Actor Director Producer Filter\n\nNon-comedy TV and film credits may be found here:\n\nLucy Akhurst on IMDb"}, {"url": "https://www.wikilogy.com/biography/lucy-akhurst/", "page_content": "Lucy Akhurst is an Actor.

The ads give the Rock, the World Wrestling Federation star, equal billing with Fraser. This is bait-and-switch. To call his appearance a \"cameo\" would be stretching it. He appears briefly at the beginning of the movie, is transmuted into a kind of transparent skeletal wraith and disappears until the end of the film, when he comes back as the dreaded Scorpion King. I am not sure, at the end, if we see the real Rock or merely his face, connected to computer-generated effects (his scorpion is blown up to giant size, which has the unfortunate effect of making him look more like a lobster tail than a scorpion). I continue to believe the Rock has an acting career ahead of him, and after seeing this movie I believe it is still ahead of him.\n\n2. Alex, the kid, adds a lot to the movie by acting just like a kid. I particularly enjoyed it when he was kidnapped by a fearsome adversary of his parents, chained and taken on a long journey, during which he drove his captor crazy by incessantly asking, \"Are we there yet?\"\n\n3. The dialogue \"You have started a chain reaction that could bring about the next Apocalypse\" is fascinating. Apparently we missed the first Apocalypse, which does not speak well for it.\n\n4. I have written before of the ability of movie characters to outrun fireballs. In \"The Mummy Returns,\" there is a more amazing feat. If the rising sun touches little Alex while he is wearing the magical bracelet, he will die (it is written). But Rick, carrying Alex in his arms, is able to outrace the sunrise; we see the line of sunlight moving on the ground right behind them. It is written by Eratosthenes that the Earth is about 25,000 miles around, and since there are 24 hours in a day, Rick was running approximately 1,041 miles an hour.\n\n5. One of the big action sequences involves a battle between two vast armies, which stretch as far as computer-generated effects can see. One army is human. The other army is made of countless creatures named Anubis that look like giant savage dogs that stand upright and run on their hind legs (it is not done well, but one is surprised to find it done at all). These armies clash in bloody swordplay. Each dog-creature, as it is killed, reverts to the desert sand from whence it sprang. Finally all the creatures are destroyed, and we see the victors standing around feeling victorious and wishing that high-fives had been invented. And we notice that not one single member of the victorious army is dead or even wounded. Pathetic, that thousands of years of ancient curses and spells could engender such an incompetent army of dog-sand-creatures."}]}
