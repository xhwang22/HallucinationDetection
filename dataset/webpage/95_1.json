He was aged 39 and he leaves behind wife Hayley and children Dale and Jade.\n\nA post-mortem was being held to discover the cause of Cooper's death, but his passing left the club in shock. During his spell at City the former schoolboy gymnast enthralled the crowd with his trademark back-flip somersault celebrations after scoring a goal.\n\nFormer City manager Alan Little, who signed the six-foot front-man from Tranmere Rovers in a \u00a335,000 deal a few months after the club's historic promotion play-off conquest at Wembley, told the Evening Press he was 'devastated' by the news.\n\nSaid Little: \"It's absolutely unbelievable and incredibly tragic for his wife and kids.\n\n\"He was a smashing lad was 'Coops'. He would do anything for you and I am certain that everyone who knows him in football will be absolutely gutted on hearing this news because he was such a great lad. It's unbelievable.\"\n\nCooper's career with City was blighted by injury, scoring eight goals in 46 appearances.\n\nLittle revealed that he had played alongside the Birmingham-born Cooper when the striker was a young lad and the ex-City boss was coming to the end of his career with Halifax Town.\n\n\"We travelled back and forth to Birmingham a couple of times and I could see then what a great lad he was. That's what made me sign him for York City from Tranmere.\n\n\"He was a big, strapping lad - as fit as anything. I just cannot believe it.\"\n\nCooper's career with City was unfortunately blighted by injury and after scoring eight goals in 46 appearances he moved to Airdrie for \u00a360,000 in September 1994.\n\nIt was with the Diamonds, where he achieved cult status, bagging the winner over Hearts in a Scottish Cup semi-final to go on to meet eventual winners Glasgow Rangers. Former City team-mate Andy McMillan told the Evening Press that it was Cooper who got him to Scotland when he revived his career post-Bootham Crescent with Ayr United.\n\nSaid McMillan: \"I just can't believe it. He made a huge impact on people wherever he went. He was an absolutely fantastic bloke. There wouldn't be anyone who had a bad word about him. It's a massive shock and a big, big loss.\"\n\nCurrent head of youth development at City, Paul Stancliffe played against Cooper, whose career took him from his native Birmingham in 1983 via Halifax, Holland, Plymouth Argyle - coincidentally in a swap deal involving former City ace Gordon Staniforth - Barnsley, Tranmere, York and then on to Airdrie and Ayr.\n\nRecalled Stancliffe: \"He was one of those centre-forwards you never liked playing against. His athleticism was unbelievable and though he wasn't very tall he had such an amazing leap.\n\n\"Off the field he was such a big character as well.\"\n\nThat point was echoed by City chief executive Keith Usher, who told the Evening Press: \"Coops was very popular within the club in the time he was here.\n\n\"He was well liked and a nice chap. It's just devastating when you hear of something like this happening.\"\n\nYork City chairman Steve Beck recalled the impact Cooper had made on his City debut in the first game of the 1993-94 season at home to Swansea City.\n\nHe said: \"I was doing some photographic work at the ground that day and you could see how well he linked up with Paul Barnes. He made such an impact with his commitment and his effort. Fans will always respond to people who get stuck in and Cooper did that.\n\n\"It's a very, very sad day. Even though he was with us not that long he was well liked. He will be badly missed.\"\n\nSteve Cooper (1964 - 2004)\n\nBorn: Birmingham, June 22, 1964\n\nYork City appearances: 44 (2)\n\nYork City goals: 8\n\nYork City debut: v Swansea 2-1 (H) August 1993\n\nYork City last game: v Swansea 0-0 (A) September 1994\n\nClubs: Moor Green, Birmingham City (Nov 1983), Halifax Town (loan), NAC Breda (loan), Mansfield Town (loan), Newport County (Sept 1984), Plymouth Argyle (July 1985), Barnsley (July 1988), Tranmere Rovers (December 1990), Peterborough United (loan), Wigan Athletic (loan), York City (July 1993), Airdrie (Sept 1994), Ayr United(1997-98).\n\nTransfer fees: Newport County to Plymouth Argyle \u00a315,000 plus player exchange with Gordon Staniforth; Plymouth Argyle to Barnsley \u00a3100,000; Barnsley to Tranmere Rovers \u00a3100,000; Tranmere Rovers to York City \u00a335,000; York City to Airdrie \u00a360,000.\n\nUpdated: 14:08 Monday, February 16, 2004"}, {"url": "https://www.premierleague.com/managers/65984/Steve-Cooper/overview", "page_content": "Manager Bio\n\nSteve Cooper was appointed head coach of Nottingham Forest on 21 September 2021.\n\nBorn in Pontypridd, Wales, Cooper played as a defender for several Welsh sides including Bangor City, while also studying for his coaching badges.\n\nAfter becoming one of the youngest coaches to obtain his UEFA Pro License, aged 27, Cooper went on to take charge of Wrexham and then Liverpool's academies.\n\nIn 2014, he was appointed manager of the England Under-16s, before going on to the Under-17s a year later.\n\nHe led them to the final of the 2017 UEFA European Championship, where they were beaten by Spain, but in October of that year, they avenged their loss with a 5-2 victory over the Spaniards in the FIFA Under-17 World Cup final.\n\nCooper joined Swansea City in June 2019, guiding them to the playoff final in 2020/21, where they lost out to Brentford at Wembley Stadium in his second and final season at the helm.\n\nIn his first campaign at Forest, Cooper took the club from the bottom of the table and ended their 23-year exile from the Premier League with a 1-0 win over Huddersfield Town in the Championship playoff final."}, {"url": "https://plymouth.vitalfootball.co.uk/where-are-they-now-steve-cooper/", "page_content": "Striker Steve Cooper is the subject of this chapter in the Where Are They Now series.\n\n\n\nSTEVE COOPER \u2013 Born 22nd June 1964 Birmingham, England.\n\n\n\nSteve excelled as a gymnast as a youngster which probably helped him in his athleticism and ability to leap in the air to score his trademark headers when he turned to football as a profession.\n\n\n\nHe began his career with his hometown club Birmingham City, signing as a professional player in 1982.\n\nSteve struggled to make his first team debut at St. Andrews and during the 1983-84 season was loaned out to Halifax where he made seven appearances scoring one goal. In the same season he spent a month on loan to Dutch side NAC Breda, playing three times for them and scoring one goal.\n\nAt the end of the season it became apparent he would have to move to get regular first team football and he took the opportunity of joining Newport.\n\n\n\nSteve spent one season with the Welsh club hardly missing a game and after making 38 appearances and scoring eleven goals Argyle manager Dave Smith took an interest in him. He joined us in time for the start of the 1985-86 season with Gordon Staniforth moving to Newport in an exchange deal.\n\n\n\nSteve made his debut on the opening day of the season in a 3-1 defeat at York with Gerry McElhinney scoring the consolation goal.\n\nSteve\u2019s first goal came in the next away game a 2-0 win at Swansea with Gerry scoring the first goal. Two weeks later Steve got another goal when he scored in a 1-1 draw at Brentford. His next goal came at Home Park in a 3-1 win over Wolves, after he had got the first goal a Garry Nelson double finished the visitors off.\n\nSteve then scored the third goal in a comfortable 3-0 win at home to Gillingham after Kevin Hodges and Garry Nelson had both scored.\n\nHis next goal came on Bonfire Night when he scored the winner in a 2-1 win at home to Bournemouth after Kevin Hodges had scored the first. The same two players both scored in a 4-2 win at home to Darlington in mid-December, Kevin scored twice with Steve and Kevin Summerfied also on the scoresheet.\n\n\n\nIn the next game Argyle played the team that would finish the season as champions, Reading, although you wouldn\u2019t have thought much of their chances when Argyle raced into a 3-0 lead with Kevin Hodges, Steve and John Clayton all scoring. The home team showed why they were top of the league by winning the game 4-3.\n\nSteve\u2019s eighth and last goal of the season came when he scored the first goal in a 3-1 win at Bournemouth with Russell Coughlin and Kevin Hodges also scoring.\n\nThe following game saw Tommy Tynan return on loan from Rotherham which limited Steve\u2019s appearances in the first team.\n\nArgyle finished the season in second place and returned to Division 2.\n\n\n\nWith Tommy scoring goals for fun Steve found his appearances limited throughout the 1986-87 season, only starting ten league games. He still managed to score four goals, all coming before mid-October. He scored twice in a 3-0 win at Hull in early September and then scored in successive 1-1 draws, the first at home to Leeds and the following Saturday at Grimsby.\n\n\n\nThe following season saw Steve make more regular first team appearances, including eleven as a substitute he made a total of 26 appearances scoring four goals, the three he got in the league came in successive games in December, on the 6th he got the second goal in a 2-0 win at home to Shrewsbury after Kevin Hodges had opened the scoring.\n\nThe following Saturday he scored the Argyle goal in a 2-1 defeat at Huddersfield. On the 20th Steve got the first goal in a 2-1 win at home to Bradford City with Mark Smith scoring the winner.\n\nSteve\u2019s other goal came in the third round of the FA Cup in a 2-0 win over Colchester at Home Park with John Matthews also scoring.\n\n\n\nSteve played his final game for the club in the last game of the season in a 2-1 defeat at Shrewsbury with John Clayton scoring the Argyle goal.\n\nAfter making 85 appearances scoring 16 goals Steve moved to Barnsley for a \u00a3100,000 fee.\n\n\n\nSteve spent three seasons at Oakwell making 77 appearances and scoring 13 goals before he moved to Tranmere.\n\n\n\nSteve enjoyed a successful first season at Tranmere with the club winning promotion to Division 1. He also appeared in the Leyland DAF cup final in 1991 against his home town club Birmingham City, although Steve scored a goal the Blues won the game 3-2.\n\n\n\nIn 1992 Steve was loaned out to Peterborough near the end of the season, with his temporary club reaching the Division 3 play-offs. After a 2-2 draw at home to Huddersfield the second leg at Leeds Road was level at 1-1 when Steve was brought on as substitute. He scored an 86th minute winner with a diving header to set up a game against Stockport at Wembley.\n\nThe Posh beat Stockport 2-1 to win promotion to Division 2.\n\n\n\nSteve returned to Tranmere but found it difficult to hold down a first team place and in 1993 was loaned out to Wigan where he made four appearances before being transferred to York.\n\nSteve was an almost ever present with York throughout the 1993-94 season making 38 league appearances scoring six goals.\n\n\n\nA move to Scotland with Airdrieonians followed and was the start of the most successful period of his career, ending up as leading goalscorer in two of the five seasons he was with them.\n\nSteve scored his first goal for Airdrie on 5th October 1994 in a 2-0 win over Ayr in the B&Q Cup, with his new club going on to win the trophy in a 3-2 victory over Dundee in the final.\n\nIn what proved to be an excellent season as far as cup matches were concerned. He scored in the semi-final of the League cup but missed out on another final with Raith ending up winning the game on penalties.\n\nIn the Scottish Cup Airdrie gained revenge for the League Cup defeat against Raith when they beat them 4-1 to set up a semi-final game against Premier League Hearts. Steve scored the winner with a towering header to reach another cup final. In the final against a star studded Celtic team they were narrowly beaten 1-0 thanks to a Pierre Van Hooijdonk goal.\n\nAt the end of his first season in Scotland Steve scored sixteen goals and reached two cup finals and a semi-final.\n\n\n\n1995-96 and 1996-97 were disrupted due to injuries, but fully fit again for the 1997-98 with Steve again terrorising Scottish defences scoring fourteen goals including a hat trick against Hamilton.\n\n1998-99 again saw Steve suffer from injuries with his appearances limited. He did manage to score nine goals though.\n\nAt the end of the season he was released by manager Gary McKay after making 133 appearances and scoring 42 goals.\n\n\n\nSteve joined Ayr for the 1998-99 season but was forced to retire from the game due to injuries without making an appearance.\n\n\n\nWhen he returned to England after his retirement he retained an involvement in football by coaching Studley FC in Warwickshire.\n\n\n\nSteve sadly died aged only 39 on 15th February 2004, he had banged his head in a fall and unknowingly cracked his skull and he later died in his sleep due to internal bleeding, leaving a wife Hayley and children Dale and Jade.\n\nA popular player at every club he played for his funeral was attended by many former team mates and fans of the clubs he had played for.\n\n\n\nLater in the year he died Steve was inducted into the Airdrie Hall of Fame, and is still held in great esteem by fans of the club.\n\n\n\nplymouthvital@aol.co.uk\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.ancientfaces.com/person/steve-cooper-birth-1946-death-2007/27199238", "page_content": "Refresh this page to see various historical events that occurred during Steve's lifetime.\n\nIn 1946, in the year that Steve Cooper was born, pediatrician Dr. Benjamin Spock's book \"The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care\" was published.

According to astrologers, Virgos are always paying attention to the smallest details and their deep sense of humanity makes them one of the most careful signs of the zodiac. Their methodical approach to life ensures that nothing is left to chance, and although they are often tender, their heart might be closed for the outer world. This is a sign often misunderstood, not because they lack the ability to express, but because they won\u2019t accept their feelings as valid, true, or even relevant when opposed to reason.

Cooper earned his UEFA Pro Licence at the age of 27, making him one of the youngest coaches to do so.\n\nCooper was a coach at the Wrexham academy for a while before being appointed head of youth development. Cooper was hired by Liverpool as a young coach on September 3, 2008, beginning overseeing the under-12 team.\n\nHe was appointed director of Liverpool\u2019s academy on July 18, 2011. Cooper led the under-18s during the 2012\u201313 season to the FA Youth Cup semifinals, where they fell to Chelsea.\n\nCooper was named the manager of the England under-16 national team on October 13, 2014. He took over the under-17s the next year and worked with athletes like Jadon Sancho, Phil Foden, and Callum Hudson-Odoi.\n\nCooper guided his team to the UEFA European U17 Championship final, when they were defeated by Spain 4-1 on penalties after a 2-2 draw.\n\nIn October 2017, Cooper\u2019s U17 team defeated Brazil 3-1 in the semifinals and Spain 5-2 in the championship match to win the 2017 FIFA U17 World Cup.\n\nSwansea City of the Championship hired Cooper as their head coach on June 13, 2019, for a three-year term.\n\nAt the Liberty Stadium, his team defeated Hull City in a 2-1 victory thanks to goals from Borja Bast\u00f3n and Mike van der Hoorn.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSwansea\u2019s unblemished start to the season saw them go to the top of the table with 16 points from 18 games, earning Cooper the EFL\u2019s Championship Manager of the Month award for August. Swansea has not started a season this well in 41 years.\n\nDespite criticism of his playing style and Swansea\u2019s poor form toward the conclusion of the season in his second season, Cooper once more guided Swansea to the playoffs.\n\nWith two league games remaining in the regular season, they drew 2-2 with Reading on April 25, 2021, to lock up their playoff spot.\n\nCooper was in charge of his 100th game. Swansea came in fourth place in the league but fell to Brentford in the play-off final. In July 2021, he left the club with everyone\u2019s approval.\n\nOn September 21, 2021, Cooper signed a two-year contract to become Nottingham Forest\u2019s head coach in the Championship. Nottingham Forest was currently in last place in the division at this time.\n\nCooper influenced Forest to be more assured with the ball and launch more assaults, which improved their style of play.\n\nHe also helped the players\u2019 mindset by encouraging a stronger sense of community and a \u201cbig club mentality.\u201d Following a 1-0 victory over Huddersfield Town in the Championship Play-Off Final at Wembley Stadium on May 29, 2022, Cooper guided Nottingham Forest to promotion to the Premier League.\n\nHe extended his contract with the team until 2025 on October 7, 2022.

We talked about it at half-time, about how defensively we looked solid enough.

Championship table since Nottingham Forest hired Cooper\n\nNottingham Forest\u2019s form under Steve Cooper has been one of the stories of the Football League this season \u2013 the table since he was appointed shows what a brilliant job he\u2019s done.\n\nExperienced coach Chris Hughton has led Newcastle and Brighton to promotion to the Championship in the past, but he failed to get the most out of Forest\u2019s squad.\n\nThe 63-year-old was sacked in mid-September after Forest made their worst start to any season since 1913. The club had taken just one point from their opening seven matches and were in the relegation zone when Cooper was announced as his successor.\n\nCooper, who enjoyed notable success by leading England\u2019s Under-17s to World Cup glory in 2017, since led Swansea to back-to-back top-six finishes in the Championship during his two years at the Liberty Stadium.\n\nTaking Forest into the play-offs appeared a tall order, given they appeared something of a crisis club when he walked through the door.\n\nBut, remarkably, that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s done \u2013 Forest\u2019s play-off place is secure with four games to spare, and they still even have an outside chance of pipping Bournemouth to an automatic promotion spot. Who knows what they might have achieved this season if they appointed him last summer.\n\n\u201cWe just try to be positive,\u201d Cooper told Sky Sports in a recent interview.\n\n\u201cWe have a can-do mentality. When you do that you give yourself the best chance. That is all it is. We just try to embrace the situation that we are in, playing for this huge, iconic football club and doing the best we can.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can only judge what you see yourself. You start as you mean to go on and that means belief in people, positive attitudes. We try to stick to that at all times. It gives you the best chance in rocky moments and allows you to enjoy the good moments.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how the Championship table looks since Cooper became Forest\u2019s new manager on September 21st.\n\nNote: all teams have played 36 games unless otherwise specified.\n\n1.

Suddenly the Memorial Ground, which had looked a pastoral picture in the low sun, shivered.\n\nRovers had been 2-0 ahead and seemingly set to win for only the second time in 14 matches when the board went up. Then Shrewsbury Town scored two minutes into the four. Then Rovers goalkeeper Joe Day got a bang on the head. He had to go off. On came a 6ft 6in Dutchman, Jordi van Stappershoef. And Shrewsbury had a corner. The clock showed 97.33. The corner was cleared. But Shrewsbury came again. Another cross came in and it brought a close-range header. Van Stappershoef scampered across to push it away. It was his one touch of the game. The whistle blew, Rovers had won, Van Stappershoef was mobbed and the Tannoy played Happiness by Ken Dodd.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaturday in south-west Wales: Bristol City were into the 10th minute of stoppage time at Swansea. City, too, had been hanging on to a 2-1 lead until 90+7. Then Antoine Semenyo struck to make it 3-1. Having lost seven consecutive matches, Bristol City had their second 3-1 away win in five days. Relieved players and staff grabbed each other and formed a post-match huddle on the Liberty Stadium pitch.\n\nThe imagery of a mobbed Rovers keeper and a smiling City circle said that on a sunny afternoon in the south west, both Bristol clubs had their new manager bounce: Joey Barton with Bristol Rovers, Nigel Pearson with Bristol City.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re rocking and rolling now,\u201d Barton said a few minutes later.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an exceptionally important win for us, for the atmosphere and us as a group of people,\u201d Pearson said.\n\n\u201cNothing\u2019s taken for granted,\u201d Barton added. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to work really hard to back that performance up. But with direction and a good culture throughout a football club, amazing things can happen. People just have to believe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important from here is that we strive to create a culture based on sound values,\u201d Pearson added, \u201cwanting to work hard for each other. And enjoying it.\u201d\n\nIt was the first Saturday to feature both Bristol clubs winning for almost five months and the updated tables showed that, even with a rush of positivity, City\u2019s three points left them 11th in the Championship before Tuesday night\u2019s games. Rovers\u2019 win took them to 19th in League One. For City, the play-offs are a realistic ambition again, but it will require an extended sequence of victories, but Rovers remain one of seven clubs fearing League Two. Were both Bristol clubs to be in their same divisions next season or the season after that, it would be a disappointment for one and an achievement for the other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd beyond Bristol? Well, football shrugs. After all, what has this place ever done? Bristol City \u2014 the Robins \u2014 have never won the league title. They have never won the FA Cup, nor the League Cup. Bristol Rovers \u2014 the Gas \u2014 have never won the top-flight title either, nor the FA Cup or League Cup. Bristol City have at least tasted top-flight English football, most recently in 1980, though many will not consider that to be recent. Bristol Rovers have never made it to the top division; they did come sixth in the old Second Division in 1959.\n\nConsequently, the city of Bristol has never staged a European football fixture. It has never staged a Premier League fixture. Yet Bristol is accepted on various population/boundary measurements as the seventh-largest city in England. It has, moreover, an organised football tradition dating back to 1883 when a team called the Black Arabs were formed on Stapleton Road. They would quickly morph into Bristol Rovers. Bristol\u2019s credibility, infrastructure and location meant it was one of the FA\u2019s chosen 12 host cities in its unsuccessful bid to host the 2018 World Cup.\n\nBristol is English football\u2019s enigma. Over the past week, since the clubs\u2019 two new managers were appointed, The Athletic has spoken to those involved today and historically to understand why Bristol, the city, does not fulfil its potential.\n\nIs Bristol a football city? When the question is raised, the answers come in a rush:\n\nGary Mabbutt: \u201cAbsolutely\u201d.\n\nBobby Gould: \u201cOh yeah, it\u2019s got the passion.\u201d\n\nDanny Wilson: \u201cYes, absolutely, within football people know how big Bristol is and its potential.\u201d\n\nThe inevitable next question is: So why has Bristol underachieved for decades?\n\nGary Mabbutt: \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult one to explain, that.\u201d\n\nBobby Gould: \u201cIt\u2019s a good question.\u201d\n\nDanny Wilson: \u201cIf anyone knew, it would have been addressed straightaway. It\u2019s a difficult question.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGary Mabbutt may be known as a Tottenham Hotspur hero who played more than 500 games over 16 years in north London but, before joining Spurs, he was at Bristol Rovers from the age of 15. He had been born in the city and his father, Ray, played for Rovers for more than a decade. Gary was the younger brother of Kevin, who scored a hat-trick for Bristol City in a 3-1 win at Manchester United in 1978 during City\u2019s four golden years at the top.\n\n\u201cCrikey!\u201d is how Mabbutt says he responded when he heard of Kevin\u2019s hat-trick. \u201cGrowing up with my father at Bristol Rovers, my brother played at City for a few years and I played for Rovers for a few, the whole family always followed both Bristol clubs. I still get a lot of people writing to me about the Gas or the Robins.\n\n\u201cThe passion the Bristol public have for the game is why it\u2019s been incredible that no Bristol team has been in the top division since the late 1970s. There is massive support in the Bristol area for both clubs. There\u2019s a passion for rugby, of course, and there\u2019s a passion for Somerset and Gloucester cricket as well. Still, football is the dominant sport.\n\n\u201cBut then the money needed to elevate yourself into the top division is immense, and there have been a lot of false dawns for both Bristol clubs.\u201d\n\nAged 26, Bobby Gould joined Bristol City from West Bromwich Albion in 1972 for \u00a362,000, a club-record signing at the time. He did not stay at Ashton Gate long, moving to West Ham, but his home remained in Bristol as it does today. He returned to the city to play for Rovers in 1977 and then had two spells managing the club in the 1980s.\n\n\u201cI have a feel for both clubs and I want them to be successful,\u201d Gould says. \u201cYou look at Bristol City and think: \u2018They\u2019re sleeping giants\u2019.\u201d\n\nThere is no lack of local interest, but ultimately, Gould says, Bristol\u2019s failings centre on knowledge, investment and leadership. Nor has it had its transformational historical figure, such as Bill Shankly at Liverpool or Herbert Chapman at Arsenal. Or, as Gould says: \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been somebody like Jimmy Hill who we had at Coventry. Somebody at the helm, saying: \u2018This is the way\u2019. There\u2019s got to be a leader. It can be done.\u201d\n\nBristol City\u2019s First Division squad of 1978-79 (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nHill\u2019s assistant at Coventry, Alan Dicks, was the manager at City when they were promoted in 1976. Dicks assembled a side featuring England internationals such as Norman Hunter, Terry Cooper and Joe Royle, as well as Kevin Mabbutt. That must have cost money \u2014 in his autobiography, Hunter said he was paid more at Bristol City than at Leeds United.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Hunter noted with disbelief that at Bristol, you washed your own red kit. City\u2019s early Centre of Excellence sessions were held on the Ashton Gate car park and when Gould is asked where he trained at Rovers, his reply is: \u201cIn a park.\u201d Gould argues that both Bristol clubs \u201chave never gone that extra yard\u201d. (Rovers\u2019 record signing remains Andy Tillson from QPR for \u00a3375,000 in 1992).\n\nMabbutt agrees: \u201cThe extra yard is investment. There were no parachute payments then when you went down. It goes without saying, the more you invest, the better things can be.\u201d\n\nWilson was City\u2019s first managerial appointment of the 21st century. The club were in the third tier, averaging gates of 10,400, but he was optimistic: \u201cI was very impressed with the stature of the club and its potential. They had a good following and very loyal \u2014 I\u2019d say that of Bristol Rovers fans too. Bristolians like football.\n\n\u201cI thought there was a realistic chance we could be successful. The Premier League was never mentioned \u2014 we weren\u2019t in a particularly good position in (what is now) League One and we had to get away from that first. Success was a different animal then, and there was a lot of disruption at board level. I think I had three chairmen. So it was never stable, a lot of disagreements, but they got ironed out when Steve took the leadership.\u201d\n\nThe Steve in question is Stephen Lansdown, a Guernsey-based Bristolian billionaire who first joined the board at Ashton Gate in 1996 and became chairman in 2002, ploughing in money ever since. Under the umbrella of Bristol Sport, Lansdown has acquired a rugby club, basketball team, and Bristol Women\u2019s football along the way; he has also tried to move Bristol City out of Ashton Gate to a new stadium nearby and the closest City have come to \u201cthe dream\u201d of Premier League football, as Lansdown calls it, was the 2008 play-off final lost 1-0 to Hull City at Wembley.\n\nGary Johnson was manager, but by 2013, City were back in League One. Under Steve Cotterill, the Robins returned to the Championship in 2015. Cotterill was succeeded by Gary Johnson\u2019s son Lee, a former City player, and they were second on Boxing Day 2017, averaging 21,000 through the gates. The Premier League was on the horizon but City fell away, as they were to the following two seasons.\n\nJohnson was replaced by his assistant Dean Holden last summer. At the start of December 2020, City were third in the Championship, but then came a surge of injuries and a bad January bled into February. As a result, Pearson became the club\u2019s eighth permanent manager in 11 years last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSteve\u2019s gone for experience, he\u2019s gone for young managers; he\u2019s thrown money at the team, he\u2019s not thrown money at the team; he\u2019s put money into infrastructure,\u201d Wilson says of Lansdown. \u201cThe infrastructure is integral because you can attract a higher calibre of manager. That\u2019s a great way to get people interested in your club. Money doesn\u2019t do everything but it helps. It brings a different level of player, which in turn should be seen in results. The foundation is there.\u201d\n\nIn turn, Lansdown told a story last year about asking Wilson, when he was manager, what he would do with a \u00a31 million windfall. Wilson advised Lansdown to invest in a training ground. In the coming weeks, City are to unveil a new state-of-the-art training facility to go alongside the redeveloped Ashton Gate.\n\nCity\u2019s home of 117 years did not grow into the 44,000-capacity venue envisaged in the World Cup bid; it is 27,000 but, as Mark Kelly, the managing director of Ashton Gate Limited and Bristol Sport, puts it, it is \u201cPremier League-ready\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have the capacity to go up another 3,000,\u201d says Kelly. \u201cSome of the specifications have changed \u2014 the Premier League has a manual \u2014 but the stadium was designed with the view it would be Premier League-ready.\n\nAshton Gate is a Premier League-quality stadium, according to Bristol City executives (Photo: Dan Istitene/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cA great teaser for us came in 2017 \u2014 for the stadium and Bristol Sport. We pulled Man United in the League Cup and the demand was such we could have filled the stadium three times over. We grew our membership substantially for that game and we\u2019ve managed to retain fans from it. It gave us an indication of the appetite for Premier League football within Bristol. Anecdotally, we were told hotels and restaurants were full that night, it brought a buzz to the city. If you have that even six nights a season, it\u2019s a start. We\u2019re a large employer in the south west and to bring Premier League football here, everyone would benefit.\u201d\n\nThe proposal had been to relocate Bristol City a mile away in Ashton Vale. Mabbutt and Lansdown were on Bristol\u2019s World Cup bid panel and were delighted the city was selected ahead of others such as Leicester and Derby.\n\n\u201cWe won that bid,\u201d Mabbutt says, \u201cbut lost the bid for the World Cup. It would have been immense for the city. Still, Bristol was chosen and Ashton Gate has been redeveloped. Things are in place. The fire was ignited by that World Cup bid.\u201d\n\nIt has, however, not been straightforward. Locals sometimes speak of \u201cPlanet Bristol\u201d when describing the sluggish pace of change and decision-making and a BBC Bristol headline from 2014 was: \u201cWhy does Bristol never build anything?\u201d A comparison was made with Cardiff, 45 miles away. Lansdown himself has said: \u201cBristol as a city does undersell itself and does frustrate you sometimes.\u201d\n\nThis perhaps leads to the external perception of Bristol as slow and genteel, not a city roused by raucous football zeal. Rovers fans such as Ash Belsten and Steve Burns have evidence to the contrary.\n\nBelsten, 31, runs a Rovers podcast and says: \u201cOne million per cent, Bristol is a football city. But you would never believe it\u2019s the seventh-largest city in the UK, would you? I listened to the radio yesterday and they were talking about Bristol as this little, quiet place in the south west where everyone drinks cider. It shouldn\u2019t really be like that. We\u2019ve got a big football rivalry, some good football history, it just seems Bristol as a city is miles behind. A lot of people say we struggle to attract players, those from the north who think house prices are expensive. There are fewer clubs around here \u2013 in the north west, there\u2019s that corridor of about 20, 30 clubs.\n\n\u201cBut if you give them a project to believe in, players will move, won\u2019t they?\u201d\n\nThat Silicon Valley idea of a cluster of clubs or businesses creating a culture and a critical mass is intriguing. It is hard to believe a Bristol club would have not won a major trophy were the city in Lancashire, for example. Yet Wilson and Gould are adamant geography did not deter any players from moving and should be an advantage.\n\nBelsten speaks animatedly of the rivalry between the city clubs\u2014 \u201cWe don\u2019t like each other at all\u201d. When Rovers sold Matty Taylor to City in 2017, the first inter-club transfer for 30 years, City manager Lee Johnson received a death threat and moved house.\n\nBurns is another example of Bristol\u2019s deep feeling for the game. In the 1994 local elections, Burns stood as a candidate, such was the sense among Rovers fans of civic indifference to their plight. They formed a political party \u2014 the Bristol Party. \u201cWe had our first meeting at the old Rovers Supporters\u2019 office, which is about 50 yards away from Eastville, on Stapleton Road,\u201d Burns says.\n\nThe background was that Bristol Rovers were no longer playing in Bristol. In August 1980, the south stand at Eastville, where Rovers had played since 1897, burned down. With the ground owned by a greyhound company who staged lucrative races around the pitch, Rovers\u2019 rent was raised so much that in 1986 they had to leave. But it was not for another home in Bristol \u2014 it was for Twerton Park in Bath. Gould was the manager and called it \u201cAzteca Twerton \u2014 the World Cup in Mexico was on.\u201d But for the club, it was a rupture.\n\nGerry Francis succeeded Gould and Rovers won promotion back to Championship level in 1990. But it was also the year of another fire, this time at Twerton, caused by Bristol City fans, nine of whom stood trial for arson.\n\nFour years later, Rovers were still in Bath and Burns was getting 10 per cent of the vote in the Henbury ward. \u201cThere was frustration among Rovers fans about not being able to get a facility in Bristol,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThe council were dragging their feet. It started with Rovers supporters but others joined from outside, purely in frustration at nothing getting moving. It was broader than the Twerton Park issue but that was the starting point, absolutely.\n\n\u201cThe longer we were in Bath, the more chance we had of losing our identity, our Bristol identity. Our chairman got 15 per cent in Eastville. We felt you wouldn\u2019t have had this problem in places like Manchester or Sheffield. The frustration is that when you look at where Eastville was, it was such a prime spot right off the M32. IKEA built there in the end and Tesco, but it had space for them and a stadium. It\u2019s a crying shame. If we had been able to do that, the club could have been totally different.\u201d\n\nIt would be 1996 before Rovers left Bath. They were back in the third tier and ground-sharing with Bristol RFC at the Memorial Ground. No one thought Rovers would still be there 25 years on, during which time they took 40,000 fans to Wembley for the 2007 League Two play-off final and also fell into non-League for a season in 2014. \u201cIt\u2019s been very difficult for Rovers without the identity of your own, established home stadium,\u201d Mabbutt says.\n\nAll the while, Rovers fans have sustained their club via schemes such as \u201cbuy-a-bulb\u201d to upgrade the floodlights. There has been repeated talk of a new stadium. Supporters can see the potential and at least Bristol Rovers own the Memorial Ground, bought not long after they returned.\n\nBristol Rovers celebrate their 2015 Conference play-off final win over Grimsby (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nIn 2016, they were taken over by a London-educated Jordanian businessman, Wael al-Qadi, who spoke of \u201cevolution not revolution\u201d. Last summer, Al-Qadi \u201ccapitalised\u201d loans of \u00a335 million, converting those debts into equity. As a result, Rovers are \u201csubstantively debt-free\u201d. They have also constructed a new training ground, in Almondsbury, and moved in last October.\n\nThe fact Barton is the fifth manager in three years shows Rovers\u2019 trajectory is not simply one way. But half an hour after Saturday\u2019s win, defender Alfie Kilgour speaks of a \u201cbuzzing\u201d changing room and swelling ambition.\n\n\u201cThe gaffer\u2019s come in \u2014 and his staff \u2014 and they\u2019ve brought real enthusiasm and energy, which we maybe didn\u2019t have before,\u201d says Kilgour. \u201cHopefully, we can kick right on. I\u2019ve grown up around Bristol and it\u2019s a shame. For a city of our size, there should be a club in the top flight. At Bristol Rovers, everyone wants to kick on and one day reach the top flight. We\u2019ve got a brand new training ground with the potential to be a Premier League training ground, beautiful pitches, great gym facilities, lots of potential. We\u2019ve got a great fanbase as well.\u201d\n\nKilgour\u2019s youthful localism chimes with Gary Probert\u2019s experience. Probert has been Bristol City\u2019s academy manager for the past five years and on Saturday, he watched the under-18s beat Millwall 3-0 before driving to Swansea to see if the first team would give another debut to a homegrown player.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re averaging six academy players in every match-day squad,\u201d Probert says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had four academy debuts already \u2014 James Morton, Sam Bell, Owura Edwards and Ryley Towler, three Bristolians and one from north Somerset. It\u2019s a productive area, a lovely mix of the urban, inner city \u2014 which brings those stereotypical \u2018street footballers\u2019 who are one-v-one dominant \u2014 and the nice leafy suburbs down to Bath, north Somerset, Gloucestershire, which attract a different kind of family and young player. Another stereotype.\u201d\n\nJoe Bryan, Bobby De Cordova-Reid and Lloyd Kelly \u2014 three recent Academy graduates sold for around \u00a335m \u2014 act as an example of what Bristol produce. There has been some sharp recruitment, too. In 2018, Adam Webster was bought from Ipswich for \u00a33.5 million, rising to \u00a38 million, and after one year at Ashton Gate, was sold to Brighton for \u00a320 million, rising to \u00a322 million. Josh Brownhill was acquired from Preston North End in 2016 aged 20 as a free agent and was sold three and a half years later to Burnley for a reported \u00a38 million. Holden\u2019s role in improving young players is why he was appointed manager last summer after Johnson\u2019s departure.\n\nThe average age of City\u2019s bench at Swansea was 19 and the academy will move into the lush new training ground opening this month.\n\n\u201cObviously I\u2019m biased,\u201d Probert adds, \u201cbut it\u2019s a really brilliant club. You have the consistent leadership provided by Steve and (wife) Maggie Lansdown. The infrastructure is there. It is, increasingly, set up to thrive.\u201d\n\nSaturday\u2019s feelgood factor extended into Monday, but Shrewsbury and Swansea are already in the past. For Rovers, a trip to Burton Albion on Tuesday night ended in a painful 1-0 defeat after midfielder Luke McCormick was sent off for a second bookable offence early in the second half, the offence in question being kicking the ball away to prevent a quick Burton throw-in; for City, it\u2019s a visit from Bournemouth on Wednesday evening.\n\nWhile ten days ago neither club had a manager, it would be premature to say Bristol has successfully negotiated a historic turning point. There is still the possibility the clubs could stall again. Managerially, it is fragile: Barton\u2019s trial for an alleged assault on Barnsley manager Daniel Stendel is heard in June; Pearson has a short-term contract expiring in May.\n\nAbove them, Lansdown and Al-Qadi are popular \u2014 Al-Qadi has stood on the terraces with supporters \u2014 but within each fanbase, there are dissenting voices. Some City followers have grumbled at Landown\u2019s ongoing investment Bristol Bears, his table-topping rugby team, to which he replied last August: \u201cBristol Rugby does have a tradition of being successful, but many moons ago. Bristol City has no tradition of being successful, if we\u2019re being honest. We\u2019ve had 125 years of snippets of good times, I want consistent good times.\u201d\n\nTurning snippets into eras, this is the task. On his first day at the club, Barton said: \u201cSomebody, at some point, is going to get Rovers right.\u201d Yesterday Pearson, when confronted with what he calls the \u201cP-word\u201d (potential) said: \u201cIt is an accurate statement of fact. The foundations for success are here. The ambition for success is also here. Those two things being aligned are very important. The feeling I get is one of frustration at that word not being realised. One step at a time.\u201d\n\nGiven where they are in the table, it might sound peculiar to say both Bristol clubs are better placed structurally than at any time in their histories to take that step. Will the undoubted potential will be fulfilled? Is this another false dawn or will it lead to a place on the map? The mystery of Bristol does at least look closer to being solved.\n\n(Top photos: Getty Images; design: Sam Richardson)"}, {"url": "https://www.premierleague.com/managers/65984/steve-cooper/overview?&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&#!", "page_content": "Manager Bio\n\nSteve Cooper was appointed head coach of Nottingham Forest on 21 September 2021.\n\nBorn in Pontypridd, Wales, Cooper played as a defender for several Welsh sides including Bangor City, while also studying for his coaching badges.\n\nAfter becoming one of the youngest coaches to obtain his UEFA Pro License, aged 27, Cooper went on to take charge of Wrexham and then Liverpool's academies.\n\nIn 2014, he was appointed manager of the England Under-16s, before going on to the Under-17s a year later.\n\nHe led them to the final of the 2017 UEFA European Championship, where they were beaten by Spain, but in October of that year, they avenged their loss with a 5-2 victory over the Spaniards in the FIFA Under-17 World Cup final.\n\nCooper joined Swansea City in June 2019, guiding them to the playoff final in 2020/21, where they lost out to Brentford at Wembley Stadium in his second and final season at the helm.\n\nIn his first campaign at Forest, Cooper took the club from the bottom of the table and ended their 23-year exile from the Premier League with a 1-0 win over Huddersfield Town in the Championship playoff final."}, {"url": "https://backpagefootball.com/steve-cooper-stays-but-what-is-next-for-swansea-city/129233/", "page_content": "Despite being the clear odds-on favourite for the Crystal Palace job for some time, Steve Cooper now looks set to remain in Swansea for a third season.\n\nThe Welshman was understandably a target for various clubs, after guiding cash-strapped Swansea City to back-to-back play-off appearances. In his first season, the club finished sixth, losing to Brentford in the semi-finals. He went one better last season, knocking out Barnsley to reach the play-off final, before the club were defeated once again by Brentford.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nAfter Roy Hodgson stepped down as Crystal Palace boss, the club instead opted to appoint former Arsenal and France midfielder Patrick Vieira, awarding him his first managerial job in English football. The Frenchman, who made 107 appearances for \u2018Les Bleus\u2019, has been without a job since he was sacked by OGC Nice in December 2020. His only other role in management was with New York City FC, who he managed from November 2015 to June 2018, when he left to join Nice.\n\nCooper was also strongly linked with a move to Fulham following Scott Parker\u2019s exit. Parker left to replace Jonathan Woodgate at fellow Championship club Bournemouth, leaving Fulham in search of a new manager. While Cooper\u2019s name was touted by many bookies, the West-London club chose Marco Silva, formerly of Hull City, Watford and Everton. Silva was sacked by Everton in 2019, with the club in 18th place in the Premier League.\n\nThe most likely explanation for Cooper\u2019s surprise stay is the lucrative compensation fee required to take him away from South Wales. Reports suggest that interested clubs would be forced to pay \u00a34.5 million to prise the 41-year-old manager and his management team away from Swansea. Considering Palace\u2019s bare squad and Fulham\u2019s recent relegation, it made sense that the clubs would opt for managers without clubs, to avoid paying compensation fees.\n\nThis is good news for Swansea City, as they look to go one step further this season. While their style of play under Cooper is a far cry from their free-flowing football under the likes of Brendan Rodgers and Roberto Martinez, Cooper has exceeded expectations with the club. Prior to this season, his most expensive signing was Jamal Lowe, who joined the club for \u00a3800,000, despite selling Oli McBurnie for an estimated \u00a320 million, as well as losing Daniel James and Joe Rodon for an initial \u00a315 million and \u00a311 million respectively.\n\nCooper\u2019s excellent links through his time as England Under-17 manager has allowed him to bring in several promising young players on loan from big clubs, including Marc Guehi from Chelsea and Rhian Brewster from Liverpool. In retaining his services, the Swans will likely continue to utilise the loan market, while bringing in young players to develop at the club.\n\nConfirmed Signings\n\nNow that it looks extremely unlikely that Cooper will leave the club, it is imperative that they focus on improving the squad, with the Championship season a little over a month away.\n\nSwansea\u2019s first signing of the window was Scottish forward Kyle Joseph. The highly rated 19-year-old joined from Wigan on a four-year deal in June, for an undisclosed fee. He has made seven appearances for Scotland Under-19s, and scored five goals last season for the Latics in League One. Joseph joined Wigan\u2019s academy at the age of 13, and made his professional debut in October 2020.\n\nOn 1st July, the club added a new goalkeeper. 19-year-old Nicholas Defreitas-Hansen joined on a free transfer from Everton. The young shot-stopper has represented the USA at youth level and is also eligible for Brazil and Denmark. He will join up with Swansea\u2019s Under-23s for the upcoming season.\n\nA day later, Swansea confirmed their third signing of the season. After weeks of speculation, they finally completed the \u00a31 million signing of Jo\u00ebl Piroe from PSV. The 21-year-old is the second striker they have signed in this window, with more potentially incoming. Much like with Joseph, Piroe is inexperienced, having made just 29 senior appearances for PSV and Sparta Rotterdam. Early on in his career, Piroe was highly rated, with links to the likes of Juventus, Arsenal and Manchester City, but the young Dutch forward has struggled to live up to the hype that surrounded him in his teenage years. The bulk of his career so far has been spent with PSV\u2019s reserves and youth team, although he has made 26 appearances at youth level for the Netherlands. He remains a bit of an unknown commodity at club level, so the Swans will have to carefully manage their expectations of him.\n\nConfirmed Departures\n\nWithout a doubt the biggest loss for Swansea City is Andre Ayew. The Ghanaian was expected to leave the club after their relegation in 2018, but after a disappointing loan spell at Fenerbah\u00e7e, he enjoyed two prolific years for the Swans under Cooper. He scored 15 in 44 league appearances in 2019-20, before bagging 16 in 43 in his final season in South Wales. While the club will save around \u00a35 million per year in wages following his exit, he will be extremely tough to replace. Since leaving on a free transfer, Ayew has been linked with Newcastle United, where he would reunite with former Swans Federico Fernandez and Jonjo Shelvey.\n\nSwansea will also feel the loss of several loanees, starting in goal with Freddie Woodman. The 24-year-old returned to parent club Newcastle after two season-long loans, although he is expected to leave. Woodman has expressed an interest in re-joining Swansea, but he may be tempted by more lucrative offers. Celtic and Arsenal have both been linked with moves for last season\u2019s Championship Golden Glove winner, after he kept 20 clean sheets last season. With Steven Benda as their only senior keeper, Swansea will undoubtedly be keen to bring Woodman back for a third season.\n\nThe Swans will have an equally tough task replacing Marc Guehi, who returned to Chelsea in the summer. The highly-rated centre-back was rock-solid for Swansea last season, showing the strength and composure of a far more experienced defender. While Woodman hinted at a return to the club, Guehi distanced himself from a third loan spell with Swansea, with links to Premier League side Crystal Palace in recent weeks.\n\nWhile he did not have the same impact as Guehi and Woodman, Conor Hourihane will also need to be replaced after his loan spell ended. The 30-year-old Republic of Ireland international returned to Aston Villa after an inconsistent season with the Welsh club. He started his season well, scoring in four in his first five league appearances, but went on to score just one more in his remaining 14 league games.\n\nSwansea are yet to lose any more first-team players, other than Keiron Freeman, who was released after failing to make a single appearance for the club. They also released Declan John, who has since joined Bolton Wanderers, while Barrie McKay left after two loan spells at Fleetwood Town.\n\nTransfer Rumours\n\nJimmy Dunne\n\nThe Swans have been heavily linked with centre-back Jimmy Dunne, who is out of contract after leaving Burnley. The 23-year-old has made two appearances for the Republic of Ireland Under-21s, but failed to find consistent football with Burnley, making just three league appearances last season.\n\nHe has spent almost all of his senior career on loan, first joining Barrow in 2017-18. There, he made 21 appearances in the National League, scoring twice, before joining then-League Two Accrington Stanley midway through the season. He was a regular with the side, playing 20 times as they finished in first place.\n\nThe following season, he had two more loan spells. He first joined Hearts in the Scottish Premiership, before spending the second half of the season with Sunderland, who had recently been relegated to League One. He made 12 appearances in both spells, scoring twice and once respectively. He followed that with a loan spell at Fleetwood Town but struggled to find a regular place in the team.\n\nLast season, he made his senior debut for Burnley, and went on to play seven times in all competitions for the Premier League side. Considering he would be available for free, it is highly likely that Swansea will bring him into the club, considering Marc Guehi\u2019s exit. Dunne has also followed the Swans on Instagram, further fuelling speculation of a move to the Welsh club.\n\nLiam Walsh\n\nAfter his release by Bristol City, 23-year-old Liam Walsh is another man who the Swans are supposedly keen on. The former Everton youth prospect joined Bristol City in 2018 but made just 18 league appearances for the club.\n\nIn 2019-20, he enjoyed a productive loan spell with Coventry City in League One, making 26 appearances and scoring three goals. However, his final season with Bristol City was blighted by injuries. He missed eight months with a thigh injury before returning in early March. He then picked up another injury at the end of March, which ruled him out for the rest of the season.\n\nGiven his injury record, Walsh would be a gamble for the Swans, as they look to add more depth in midfield.\n\nThomas Henry\n\nAt one point, it looked likely that Swansea would acquire Thomas Henry from OH Leuven. The 26-year-old French striker scored 21 goals for the Belgian side last season. He has registered a total of 42 goals and 12 assists in his 71 games for the club.\n\nHe would be an excellent signing for the Swans, but his expensive price tag has all but ended any speculation. Leuven have set the asking price at \u00a35 million, which is more than Swansea have spent in total since Steve Cooper took over in 2019.\n\nWith this move now highly unlikely, expect the Swans to look elsewhere as they continue to bolster their attacking options.\n\nHarry Wilson\n\nAs reported by Alan Nixon on Twitter, the Swans have resumed their interest in Harry Wilson, after missing out on him last season. The club were in talks with Liverpool over a loan deal last summer, but were unwilling to pay the lucrative loan fee, or cover the majority of his wages. In the end, Wilson joined Swansea\u2019s biggest rivals Cardiff City on loan, where he played 37 times in the Championship, scoring seven goals and registering 12 assists.\n\nHowever, interest in Wilson is said to be high, with Brentford, West Bromwich Albion and Fulham all linked, while Benfica are supposedly keen on a permanent deal for the Welshman.\n\nThis would be an excellent coup for the Swans. Wilson would provide the sort of set-piece ability that the club has lacked since Gylfi Sigur\u00f0sson left for Everton in 2017. He would also add some much-needed creativity to the midfield after Ayew\u2019s exit.\n\nWilson has made 29 appearances for Wales, and would join up with fellow Welsh internationals Connor Roberts and Ben Cabango if he joined the Swans.\n\nPotential Exits\n\nSince their relegation in 2018, Swansea have sold many first-team players, relying on their Under-23s and a smattering of affordable signings and loan deals. The likes of Alfie Mawson, Daniel James, Oli McBurnie and \u0141ukasz Fabia\u0144ski all left for sizeable fees, with only a small percentage of these fees being reinvested into the squad.\n\nLast season, Joe Rodon joined Tottenham for \u00a311 million, while his centre-back partner Mike van der Hoorn left on a free transfer. Bersant Celina and Kristoffer Peterson were also sold, although they struggled for game time under Cooper.\n\nIt is likely that Swansea will lose one or two key players this season, with some already linked with moves.\n\nMatt Grimes\n\nIt would not be a Swansea transfer window without Matt Grimes being linked to a Premier League club. The Swans captain has been rumoured to be a target for Newcastle and Southampton. The 25-year-old had a tough start in South Wales after his \u00a31.75 million move from Exeter City. He had unsuccessful loan spells in the Championship with Blackburn Rovers and Leeds United, before dropping down to League One in 2017-18 to join Northampton Town for a season.\n\nHe returned to Swansea following their relegation and was immediately thrown into the first team by then-Swansea manager Graham Potter. He has missed just two league games in his three seasons since then, with Cooper naming him captain prior to the 2019-20 season.\n\nConnor Roberts\n\nFew players in world football have the stamina of Connor Roberts. The 25-year-old right-back hardly missed a minute for his local club last season, even scoring five goals in 46 league outings. He has been one of the club\u2019s best players since their relegation, always providing excellent work-rate in attack and defence, chipping in with goals and assists.\n\nHe carried this form into the Euros, playing every single minute in the group stages for Wales. He also scored the second in their 2-0 win over Turkey to all but secure their place in the knockout stages. However, he limped off in the first half in the 4-0 loss to Denmark in the Round of 16. The club confirmed that he will undergo surgery on his groin, ruling him out until the end of September. This could be a blessing in disguise for the Swans, putting off potential suitors.\n\nYan Dhanda\n\nAlthough not a regular in the Swansea starting eleven, Dhanda has been an exciting option when called upon. He scored the winner away at Sheffield United on his debut for the club in 2018, Swansea\u2019s first game back in the Championship, but has never found consistent first-team football.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Dhanda was linked with Anderlecht. The Belgian side are managed by former Manchester City and Belgium captain Vincent Kompany. As Dhanda only has one year remaining on his contract, it seems likely that the Swans will look to cash in on him before the window closes.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nSwansea City are an unknown commodity this season, at least for now. Losing Woodman, Guehi and Ayew is devastating for the club. The acquisitions of Piroe and Joseph have potential, but both are inexperienced, so they ought to continue bolstering their attacking options before the season kicks off next month.\n\nThe club also need a goalkeeper, a centre-back, a playmaking midfielder and a winger. Woodman returning would be the ideal scenario, while Jimmy Dunne would provide a good option at centre-half. Harry Wilson seems unlikely, but stranger things have happened.\n\nKeeping Cooper in charge is a big deal. After all, he managed to guide Swansea to fourth place without a recognised senior striker, while spending around \u00a32 million and receiving close to \u00a315 million in transfer fees. If the board back Cooper financially, expect Swansea to be there or thereabouts again this season."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/19/steve-cooper-nottingham-forest-liverpool-fa-cup-world-cup-winner", "page_content": "When England were pitted against Colombia at the 2018 World Cup, it was time for Steve Cooper to show Gareth Southgate his homework. Cooper, who had led England to the under-17 equivalent of the competition the previous year, was tasked by the Football Association with studying the South American side throughout the tournament and flew to Russia to present his findings to Southgate, the staff and the technical director, Dan Ashworth, in the buildup to the last-16 match in Moscow.\n\n\u201cDan always used to challenge the coaches: \u2018If you were the England manager, how would you set up? What would you do?\u2019\u201d says the England goalkeeping coach, Martyn Margetson, who later worked with Cooper at Swansea. \u201cThe tactical detail was incredible. He gave us a full insight into what Colombia were, really. You were looking at Steve and thinking: \u2018Yeah, you know your stuff.\u2019 It is a daunting task but Coops did an amazing job.\u201d England ended up winning on penalties.\n\nNow Cooper\u2019s focus is on Nottingham Forest and facing Liverpool, where he spent five years coaching in the academy, in Sunday\u2019s FA Cup quarter-final. His work with England\u2019s under-17s, including with Phil Foden, Conor Gallagher and Jadon Sancho, enhanced an already blossoming reputation. Cooper arrived at the FA from Liverpool, where he became academy manager and coached Raheem Sterling and Trent Alexander-Arnold. Since taking charge at Forest in September, Djed Spence, 21, Brennan Johnson, 20, and James Garner, 21, have thrived.\n\n\u201cOver a long period, Steve will have worked with some of the best young players in the country,\u201d says Ian Foster, the England Under-19s head coach who, with Mike Marsh, assisted Cooper at the Under-17 World Cup. \u201cIn terms of his recruitment at Swansea, he had worked with [Marc] Gu\u00e9hi, Gallagher, [Rhian] Brewster [with England]. The players know him, they trust him, they like his ideas and they know what sort of coach and person he is. He knows how to handle young players. He\u2019s got tons of experience.\u201d\n\nSteve Cooper (right) and an England squad including Emile Smith Rowe, Marc Gu\u00e9hi and Phil Foden celebrate winning the Under-17 World Cup in 2017. Photograph: Danish Siddiqui/Reuters\n\nFor Cooper, it all started at Wrexham when his manager, Brian Flynn, encouraged the full-back to pursue coaching and he became the club\u2019s head of youth development. In the early days he juggled taking the under-18s at Wrexham with playing part-time for Rhyl, Bangor and The New Saints. By the age of 27, he had his Uefa pro licence, the highest coaching qualification available. Liverpool liked what they saw and appointed Cooper as a youth coach. Frank McParland, then the academy director, promoted Cooper from under-16s to under-18s coach. Cooper worked closely with the technical manager at Liverpool\u2019s academy, Pep Segura, adopting the former Barcelona coach\u2019s philosophy.\n\nCooper\u2019s passion radiated to his players. \u201cHe is the most dedicated manager I\u2019ve come across, in terms of his appetite, his eagerness, his energy, his buzz,\u201d says Jordan Lussey, who Cooper named under-18s captain at Liverpool. \u201cWe got to the FA Youth Cup semi-finals [in 2013] and played Chelsea over two legs. I\u2019d be out locally around Ormskirk on an evening and get a phone call off him saying: \u2018What do you think about this? I\u2019ve got this idea.\u2019 Or: \u2018Come into the office tomorrow, I need to show you something.\u2019 You would sit down, the two of us at a computer, and he would show you what he wants from you in a game, what their weaknesses are and that is another reason he has had great success. Any situation that was put in our way, you knew your job.\u201d\n\nSteve Cooper during Liverpool\u2019s FA Youth Cup semi-final against Chelsea at Anfield in 2013. Photograph: Paul Thomas/The FA/Getty Images\n\nCooper, born in Pontypridd, 12 miles north of Cardiff, is meticulous \u2013 on and off the grass. \u201cThere is not a stone that Steve leaves unturned,\u201d says Margetson. \u201cEven the smallest detail is important to him. He is across everything. The dressing room, how it is set up and how meeting rooms are set up, etcetera. One of the things he did around the training ground was make it feel more like Swansea City. He put images of the players all around the training ground and images of the supporters cheering on the team. He was proud to manage Swansea and he knew what it meant to the people. and he often referred to that in meetings and he did a lot of brilliant motivational [pre-match] videos for the players, showing them the history of the club.\u201d\n\nRyan Yates (left) is embraced by teammates after putting Nottingham Forest ahead during Wednesday\u2019s win over QPR. Photograph: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images\n\nThe 42-year-old, whose father, Keith, was a referee, is an unassuming character and although a deep thinker and level-headed, he can be firm when required. \u201cIf he needs to give you the hairdryer treatment, he will,\u201d says Lussey, now with Curzon Ashton. \u201cIf he needs to give you praise, he will. That\u2019s where he gets that mutual respect from top to bottom. He\u2019s not your best mate where you can just mess about or not put in the work. He will pull you up properly and let you know what he thinks.\u201d\n\nSwansea\u2019s hierarchy were wowed by Cooper during his interview and, after guiding the club to successive play-off finishes on a modest budget, unsurprisingly there was Premier League interest last summer and he held talks with Crystal Palace. Forest identified Cooper as their first-choice target after sacking Chris Hughton when bottom of the Championship. They have risen to eighth, Wednesday\u2019s 3-1 home win over QPR continuing form that looks capable of securing a play-off place. Since his appointment six months ago they have lost only four times.\n\nA Nottingham Forest fan with a Steve Cooper cutout. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA\n\n\u201cHe is very much a family man, but he lives and breathes football,\u201d Margetson says. \u201cIf he\u2019s not thinking about Forest, he\u2019ll be watching games somewhere. You can\u2019t just rock up and land in the Championship \u2013 you have to earn your stripes and study the game and there is no doubt that Coops has done.\u201d\n\nWhen Forest kick off against Liverpool at the City Ground, Foster will be watching on television at St George\u2019s Park, cup of tea in hand. \u201cI am immensely proud of him,\u201d Foster says. \u201cI think when you\u2019ve not had a wonderful playing career it\u2019s harder to establish yourself as a coach. He\u2019s had to do it the hard way and is reaping the rewards of that. He has been a shining light for coaches at the FA and beyond. He will play it down but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s itching to pit his wits against one of the best coaches in the game.\u201d"}], "Steve Cooper played for Birmingham City in the English Football League.": [{"url": "https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-steve-cooper-birmingham-6929101", "page_content": "Steve Cooper played down Nottingham Forest climbing to third in the table after their 2-0 victory over Birmingham City.\n\nThe Reds made it five league wins on the spin and 10 unbeaten in the Championship as they eased past the Blues at the City Ground.

In the same season he spent a month on loan to Dutch side NAC Breda, playing three times for them and scoring one goal.\n\nAt the end of the season it became apparent he would have to move to get regular first team football and he took the opportunity of joining Newport.\n\n\n\nSteve spent one season with the Welsh club hardly missing a game and after making 38 appearances and scoring eleven goals Argyle manager Dave Smith took an interest in him. He joined us in time for the start of the 1985-86 season with Gordon Staniforth moving to Newport in an exchange deal.\n\n\n\nSteve made his debut on the opening day of the season in a 3-1 defeat at York with Gerry McElhinney scoring the consolation goal.\n\nSteve\u2019s first goal came in the next away game a 2-0 win at Swansea with Gerry scoring the first goal. Two weeks later Steve got another goal when he scored in a 1-1 draw at Brentford. His next goal came at Home Park in a 3-1 win over Wolves, after he had got the first goal a Garry Nelson double finished the visitors off.\n\nSteve then scored the third goal in a comfortable 3-0 win at home to Gillingham after Kevin Hodges and Garry Nelson had both scored.\n\nHis next goal came on Bonfire Night when he scored the winner in a 2-1 win at home to Bournemouth after Kevin Hodges had scored the first. The same two players both scored in a 4-2 win at home to Darlington in mid-December, Kevin scored twice with Steve and Kevin Summerfied also on the scoresheet.\n\n\n\nIn the next game Argyle played the team that would finish the season as champions, Reading, although you wouldn\u2019t have thought much of their chances when Argyle raced into a 3-0 lead with Kevin Hodges, Steve and John Clayton all scoring. The home team showed why they were top of the league by winning the game 4-3.\n\nSteve\u2019s eighth and last goal of the season came when he scored the first goal in a 3-1 win at Bournemouth with Russell Coughlin and Kevin Hodges also scoring.\n\nThe following game saw Tommy Tynan return on loan from Rotherham which limited Steve\u2019s appearances in the first team.\n\nArgyle finished the season in second place and returned to Division 2.\n\n\n\nWith Tommy scoring goals for fun Steve found his appearances limited throughout the 1986-87 season, only starting ten league games. He still managed to score four goals, all coming before mid-October. He scored twice in a 3-0 win at Hull in early September and then scored in successive 1-1 draws, the first at home to Leeds and the following Saturday at Grimsby.\n\n\n\nThe following season saw Steve make more regular first team appearances, including eleven as a substitute he made a total of 26 appearances scoring four goals, the three he got in the league came in successive games in December, on the 6th he got the second goal in a 2-0 win at home to Shrewsbury after Kevin Hodges had opened the scoring.\n\nThe following Saturday he scored the Argyle goal in a 2-1 defeat at Huddersfield. On the 20th Steve got the first goal in a 2-1 win at home to Bradford City with Mark Smith scoring the winner.\n\nSteve\u2019s other goal came in the third round of the FA Cup in a 2-0 win over Colchester at Home Park with John Matthews also scoring.\n\n\n\nSteve played his final game for the club in the last game of the season in a 2-1 defeat at Shrewsbury with John Clayton scoring the Argyle goal.\n\nAfter making 85 appearances scoring 16 goals Steve moved to Barnsley for a \u00a3100,000 fee.\n\n\n\nSteve spent three seasons at Oakwell making 77 appearances and scoring 13 goals before he moved to Tranmere.\n\n\n\nSteve enjoyed a successful first season at Tranmere with the club winning promotion to Division 1. He also appeared in the Leyland DAF cup final in 1991 against his home town club Birmingham City, although Steve scored a goal the Blues won the game 3-2.\n\n\n\nIn 1992 Steve was loaned out to Peterborough near the end of the season, with his temporary club reaching the Division 3 play-offs. After a 2-2 draw at home to Huddersfield the second leg at Leeds Road was level at 1-1 when Steve was brought on as substitute. He scored an 86th minute winner with a diving header to set up a game against Stockport at Wembley.\n\nThe Posh beat Stockport 2-1 to win promotion to Division 2.\n\n\n\nSteve returned to Tranmere but found it difficult to hold down a first team place and in 1993 was loaned out to Wigan where he made four appearances before being transferred to York.\n\nSteve was an almost ever present with York throughout the 1993-94 season making 38 league appearances scoring six goals.\n\n\n\nA move to Scotland with Airdrieonians followed and was the start of the most successful period of his career, ending up as leading goalscorer in two of the five seasons he was with them.\n\nSteve scored his first goal for Airdrie on 5th October 1994 in a 2-0 win over Ayr in the B&Q Cup, with his new club going on to win the trophy in a 3-2 victory over Dundee in the final.\n\nIn what proved to be an excellent season as far as cup matches were concerned. He scored in the semi-final of the League cup but missed out on another final with Raith ending up winning the game on penalties.\n\nIn the Scottish Cup Airdrie gained revenge for the League Cup defeat against Raith when they beat them 4-1 to set up a semi-final game against Premier League Hearts. Steve scored the winner with a towering header to reach another cup final. In the final against a star studded Celtic team they were narrowly beaten 1-0 thanks to a Pierre Van Hooijdonk goal.\n\nAt the end of his first season in Scotland Steve scored sixteen goals and reached two cup finals and a semi-final.\n\n\n\n1995-96 and 1996-97 were disrupted due to injuries, but fully fit again for the 1997-98 with Steve again terrorising Scottish defences scoring fourteen goals including a hat trick against Hamilton.\n\n1998-99 again saw Steve suffer from injuries with his appearances limited. He did manage to score nine goals though.\n\nAt the end of the season he was released by manager Gary McKay after making 133 appearances and scoring 42 goals.\n\n\n\nSteve joined Ayr for the 1998-99 season but was forced to retire from the game due to injuries without making an appearance.\n\n\n\nWhen he returned to England after his retirement he retained an involvement in football by coaching Studley FC in Warwickshire.\n\n\n\nSteve sadly died aged only 39 on 15th February 2004, he had banged his head in a fall and unknowingly cracked his skull and he later died in his sleep due to internal bleeding, leaving a wife Hayley and children Dale and Jade.\n\nA popular player at every club he played for his funeral was attended by many former team mates and fans of the clubs he had played for.\n\n\n\nLater in the year he died Steve was inducted into the Airdrie Hall of Fame, and is still held in great esteem by fans of the club.\n\n\n\nplymouthvital@aol.co.uk\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-steve-cooper-birmingham-6008497", "page_content": "A thumping 3-0 victory over Birmingham City saw Nottingham Forest go into the international break in style.\n\nAnd it continued their resurgence under new boss Steve Cooper, who has picked up seven points from nine since taking charge.\n\nThe Reds are unbeaten in four following the sacking of Chris Hughton last month, with caretaker boss Steven Reid having overseen a win at Huddersfield Town.\n\nThey are up to 17th in the Championship table, having been rock bottom not so long ago.\n\nIn the latest edition of the Garibaldi Red podcast, Matt Davies, club legend Garry Birtles and Sarah Clapson discussed the difference Cooper has made.\n\nHere\u2019s a snippet of how the conversation panned out.

And Ryan Yates went in bravely for his header.\n\n\u201cThe fans were fantastic all afternoon, too.\n\n\u201cIt was a really good day all round.\u201d\n\nSign on to join the Reds debate We want your views, Reds fans.

It was that bad at that particular moment.\n\n\u201cIt just shows you that things can turn around.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same group of players, just playing a different system and given the freedom to do what they do best.\n\n\u201cChris (Hughton) is a great man, but when he was in charge it was more, \u2018let\u2019s not lose\u2019, rather than, \u2018let\u2019s go out there and win\u2019.\n\n\u201cIf you use that philosophy you can come unstuck, because if you do go 1-0 up and try to defend that, it\u2019s so difficult in the modern game.\n\n\u201cThe game has definitely evolved, even in the last few years.\n\n\u201cYou can see the difference in attitude and the way Forest are playing now. The players look like they are enjoying themselves.\n\nWhat did you make of Saturday's performance? Have your say in the comments below\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to enjoy what you do when you go out there. There\u2019s no point going to work - whether it be as a footballer or in any walk of life - and not enjoying it. You have to enjoy what you do. If you\u2019re not enjoying it, you don\u2019t put your lot in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very positive, and it\u2019s great to see. The change has just been so dramatic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just delighted the fans can see light at the end of the tunnel now.\n\n\u201cRoy Keane took Sunderland up all those years ago, when they had been right down at the bottom; they just soared up the league and got promoted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying that is going to happen, but it has happened before.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just hope this run continues. Winning games breeds so much confidence; you go out there thinking you can\u2019t get beaten.\n\n\u201cWhat a strike it was for Lewis Grabban\u2019s goal. If I was Birmingham\u2019s manager, I would have been absolutely slaughtering their defence. I don\u2019t think Lewis could believe his luck - they just kept backing off and finally he just thought, \u2018right, I\u2019m going to shoot\u2019. And it was a stunner.\n\n\u201cForest did ride their luck, but every club does at some point. When you do ride your luck, you have to take advantage of that. Forest did, and got a comfortable victory.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nMD: What has changed so quickly under Steve Cooper?\n\nSC: \u201cYou have to give him a lot of credit for his man management. He has quickly instilled belief in the team.\n\n\u201cWhenever you talk to him, he\u2019s very positive. He talks about wanting to win and about wanting to score goals, wanting to play well.\n\n\u201cHe builds his players up. It must make them feel 10 feet tall. He\u2019s really good at getting players to play at their best.\n\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s given them freedom - as Joe Lolley mentioned. He\u2019s given players the opportunity to express themselves. And he allows them to take responsibility on the pitch; to make their own decisions, to some degree.\n\n\u201cThere is a plan there and a basis for what he wants the team to do, but he lets players get their own sense of the game and make their own decisions - take responsibility themselves.\n\n\u201cThat means the manager has got faith in you. As a player, that has got to count for a lot.\n\nGaribaldi Red podcast - listen and subscribe The Garibaldi Red podcast is our weekly Nottingham Forest podcast featuring fans, ex-players and managers or Forest supporting journalists, such as Darren Fletcher, Daniel Storey and Gregor Robertson.

It\u2019s about walking through the door in a morning, looking forward to going to work.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we had under Brian Clough. You couldn\u2019t wait to get in.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll mention another manager I had towards the end of my career - Alan Buckley at Grimsby Town. What a fantastic bloke he was.\n\n\u201cWhen I went to sign there, I asked what style of football he played. He said, \u2018we get it down and pass it\u2019. I said, \u2018give me the pen\u2019.\n\n\u201cHe was true to his word. It was fantastic to play under him.\n\n\u201cHe trusted me to train two days a week because I was travelling up, and he trusted me to do it back in Nottingham as well. He wanted players to go out and express themselves.\n\n\u201cYou can get bogged down in the way you go about things.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the players now realise they\u2019ve had a release. You can see the freedom they seem to have now.\n\n\u201cFootball is an instinctive game. You go out there and try to make something happen in that instant, and you do it to the best of your ability. When a manager has the trust in you to do that, it\u2019s brilliant.\n\n\u201cYou know if you get it wrong, but have tried it for the right reasons, you are going to be okay.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in the few games so far under the new manager.\n\n\u201cIt was a little bit negative, the way they approached games under Chris Hughton. You could see the restrictions on some of the players - wanting to express themselves more but feeling restrained.\n\n\u201cYou have to go out there and be positive. It\u2019s great to see the shackles have been lifted a bit.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-steve-cooper-birmingham-6929105", "page_content": "Boss Steve Cooper admitted he had a tough decision to make prior to Nottingham Forest's victory over Birmingham City.\n\nThe Welshman named an unchanged starting XI for the third game in a row. And he got the same end result, with the Reds making it nine points from nine since returning from the international break as they triumphed 2-0 at the City Ground.\n\nKeinan Davis and Scott McKenna found the net against the Blues to make it a perfect week for Forest. The result made it 10 league games unbeaten and saw the club climb to third in the Championship table.\n\nRead more: How the Reds rated against Birmingham\n\nRead more: Re-live the action from the City Ground\n\nBut Cooper faced a selection dilemma beforehand, having seen Joe Lolley, Sam Surridge and a fit-again Lewis Grabban impress from off the bench against both Blackpool and Coventry City. The trio did the same again in Saturday\u2019s win, leaving Cooper with another decision to make for next week's trip to Luton Town.\n\n\"I toyed with whether to make changes, because of it being a three-game week,\" he said. \"The Stoke game (a 2-2 draw in February) was in my head a little bit, because we didn't play so well that day and that was a three-game week.\n\n\"But I decided to go with momentum. I decided to go with connections on the pitch at this particular time. I don't know whether it proved to be right, but we certainly got the result we needed.\n\n\"It was tough. It was a dilemma.\n\n\"At the start of the week, I thought I would make changes at some stage. And probably, if it had gone well, it would have been this one.\n\n\"But I slept on it and decided to go with momentum. It's worked in terms of the result. The performance was, in general, good but could have been better at times.\n\n\"We've got the points. We've got a strong squad. Everyone is fit and able.

He doesn\u2019t need loads of information from me, he just needs a bit of support and a bit of belief, because he\u2019s done it for years now.\n\n\u201cHe led the line really well and scored a brilliant goal. He\u2019ll be disappointed he didn\u2019t get the one which could have put us three-up a bit quicker.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great presence on the pitch, knows the role well and is being a real captain at the moment.\"\n\nDid you know much about him when you came in?\n\n\u201cWe definitely feared him in previous years, coming up against Forest. He wasn\u2019t always fit for the games, but we knew all about him and did a lot of work on that.\n\n\"I remember the game a couple of years ago, it was, 'look after Grabban and stop (Sammy) Ameobi shooting from outside the box' - and he scored two from outside the box, if I remember, in a 2-2.\n\n\u201cI knew a lot about Lewis and what he can do. It\u2019s nice to be able to have it as an advantage for me now. Hopefully that can continue.\n\n\u201cWe need to look after him. He\u2019s 30-plus now, but he\u2019s still in great shape. I looked at his fitness scores and how he looks after himself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time getting to know him as captain, and have put a real big importance on the role of the captain. I like how he\u2019s going about it, both on and off the pitch.\u201d\n\nSign on to join the Reds debate We want your views, Reds fans.

Just click here to get started.\n\nGrabban has come in for some criticism in the past for being captain. What do you see in him that makes him your choice for the role?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m only looking forward. What\u2019s happened before, I only have respect for. But I\u2019m only interested in from when we\u2019ve come in, and looking forward.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how I see him.\n\n\u201cHopefully we can keep building on that, like all the other good things we\u2019ve done at the moment, while trying to improve some of the things that need improving on.\n\n\u201cIt was a brilliant goal. Amazing.\n\n\u201cYou actually fancied him to score the one he didn\u2019t get right. But as soon as it left his foot, you just thought, \u2018goal\u2019.\n\n\u201cHe looked a real threat today. He managed the game well, in terms of the turnovers. Even when he\u2019s not getting the ball, he\u2019s occupying centre-backs, which allows Brennan (Johnson) to get in.\n\n\"We wanted Brennan to get in down that side. We felt it was a real opportunity and a nice follow-on from the plan against Barnsley. It was a little bit ironic that it was the same side we thought we could get him in.\n\n\u201cPositionally today, I thought we were excellent - and we were good for the three goals.\u201d\n\nDo you welcome this break, to get chance to work with the players? Or are there mixed feelings because you're on such a good run?\n\n\"You always get asked that at international breaks, don't you; asked whether we like it or not?\n\n\"Whether we're having a good time or a bad time, we know it's coming, and we have to deal with it wisely.\n\n\"Looking at the game today, I thought in general play - in and out of possession, in open play - we were really good. We scored three, but we could have scored more.\n\n\"In open play, we limited them to very little.\n\n\"What we need to get better at is set-pieces.\n\n\"I'm not sitting here thinking there isn't stuff to improve on. There is an improvement to be had there, with how we defend set-pieces.\n\n\"I've just told the boys that, because our mentality has always got to be about how we get better and how we improve.\n\nWhat did you make of Forest's performance? Have your say in the comments below\n\n\"We need to recognise what's going well, but we also need to recognise how we get better.\n\n\"At set-pieces today, we've survived a few scary moments. Brice has made saves, we've had a ball off the line and they've hit the post a couple of times.\n\n\"There was only one winner today, let's recognise that. There was only one team which deserved the three points. But at the same time, looking internally, set-pieces is something we need to improve on.\n\n\"I don't want to dwell on it, and I don't want headlines written about it, because there are much more important things from the game.\n\n\"But if it's something I'm looking at and thinking, 'right, we've got work to do', we'll do that.\"\n\nGaribaldi Red podcast - listen and subscribe The Garibaldi Red podcast is our weekly Nottingham Forest podcast featuring fans, ex-players and managers or Forest supporting journalists, such as Darren Fletcher, Daniel Storey and Gregor Robertson.

He is a big inspiration to me and to most people who know him. I want him to know we are all thinking of him. So please, can you all raise a glass to\u2026 Steve Cooper.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you want to understand the scale of the impact Cooper has had at Nottingham Forest, the widely shared social media video clip of a recent wedding speech sums things up perfectly.\n\nThe unexpected toast is followed by an enthusiastic rendition of Depeche Mode\u2019s Just Can\u2019t Get Enough. The song \u2014 fittingly released in 1981 during the era when then-manager Brian Clough\u2019s Forest side were at the peak of their powers \u2014 has become ubiquitous with Cooper\u2019s present-day version as he has overseen a remarkable transformation in both fortunes and mood.\n\nAt the time of his appointment in September, Forest had made their worst start to a season for 108 years, claiming only a single point from their first seven Championship games under Chris Hughton.\n\nThe fact they have now secured a place in the Premier League is testimony to the incredible job Cooper has done.\n\nBut it is more than just results that have earned the 42-year-old Welshman a place in the hearts of Forest supporters. It is the fact Cooper just seems to have an intrinsic grasp of this club and what it means to their fans. He gets it.\n\n\u201cIt is a special club to be part of. I tell the players that it is not going to last forever because we are just passing by, really, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Cooper said recently. \u201cYou do have to take it in and recognise that not everywhere is like this. You should never take it for granted, having the opportunity to be involved with a club like this, in any capacity. I just want a team that the supporters can be proud of.\u201d\n\nSo what has been behind his success?\n\nIn the dressing room and on the training ground, the players more regularly refer to him as \u201cCoops\u201d than \u201cBoss\u201d or \u201cGaffer\u201d.\n\nCooper does not favour a hierarchical structure but an atmosphere of unity. His post-match fist-pumps in front of every corner of the City Ground have become a trademark. But, normally, those moments only arrive after he has taken the time to talk to and congratulate every single one of his players.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose fist-pump celebrations were not pre-planned but something that happened off the cuff and, while he appreciates the bond it has helped him to forge with supporters, Cooper has never wanted the spotlight to be cast solely on him. He can feel slightly embarrassed when it is. He prefers to see Forest\u2019s achievements as a team effort.\n\nHis family, including his father, brother and son, regularly attend games. Cooper admits he has been known to feel emotional during the traditional pre-match rendition of Mull Of Kintyre, which seems to have grown louder and more fervent with each passing week.\n\nFormer Wrexham and Liverpool academy coach Cooper still has his family home in north Wales, where there are a small but growing number of Forest fans who now make the journey across to the English east Midlands, having been inspired by the job their fellow countryman is doing.\n\nThere is nothing complex to Cooper\u2019s approach. He is meticulous but still somehow manages to keep things simple. There are several meetings with players every single day, as a group and individually.\n\nHe is a friendly, approachable character but also possesses a sharp wit and the ability to deliver a cutting put-down if a player does mess up in training.\n\n\u201cHe is intense but good. He has a great nature. He is good around the lads but you don\u2019t want to mess up one of his drills; you do not want to give balls away cheaply,\u201d defender Steve Cook tells The Athletic. \u201cHe is very sharp when he wants to be\u2026 he can give you one or two lines that will bring you down to earth.\n\n\u201cIf it is not you on the receiving end of it, it can be quite enjoyable \u2014 because I like hearing what he has to say. But if it is you on the end of it, it is much less enjoyable.\n\nFrom left: Scott McKenna, Steve Cook and Jack Colback have all benefited from Steve Cooper\u2019s guidance (Photo: Justin Tallis/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThe work he does with his coaching staff all has a purpose. You can see the thought process behind everything. We do not do drills for the sake of it; they all have a purpose. That is a good way of keeping players on it \u2014 particularly those who can kind of drift, attention-wise. There are a few of those!\n\n\u201cThey are always short, sharp sessions, with a lot of detail. It is about keeping fitness levels up but also about getting the tactical ideas across. Because that can change, game to game.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Hughton had doubts over whether young Brennan Johnson was ready for Championship football, Cooper has honed the talent of the Wales international, who is now valued at as much as \u00a325 million, such has been his progress. The 20-year-old has contributed 19 goals and 10 assists.\n\nSimilarly, Hughton regarded Jordi Osei-Tutu as Forest\u2019s first-choice right-back at the start of the season and, while injury hampered his progress \u2014 to the point where his loan spell was terminated early and he returned to Arsenal \u2014 fellow loanee Djed Spence has subsequently evolved into a player that the likes of Tottenham, and Arsenal themselves, are watching keenly.\n\nThe only regret is that it will be parent club Middlesbrough who benefit financially from Spence\u2019s rapid development into one of the best young defenders outside of the top flight. He was an outcast in the north east last summer but is now valued at \u00a310 million.\n\nRyan Yates has long been regarded as a bright prospect by those who have worked closely with him, who see his qualities, but the midfielder had struggled to win Forest fans around to the same idea. His work-rate and constant desire for personal improvement are indicative of the attitude Cooper demands. Yates\u2019 personal improvement is a sign that they are more than just words.\n\n\u201cYou rest at the end, not in the middle,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cI have said that to the players. They just have to be hungry to improve and hungry to get the best out of every single day.\n\n\u201cIt is an elite environment. It needs to be challenging. Sometimes people need to be pushed \u2014 including myself. To achieve that, things are not always going to be fluffy. What we try to do is get to a place where, if you are having difficult conversations, we have built good connections and relations with people so that they know it is coming from the right place.\n\n\u201cThick or thin, everyone sticks together. That is so important.\u201d\n\nForest have been granted planning permission to revamp parts of their training ground at the Nigel Doughty Academy. But, while he approves of the club\u2019s ambition, Cooper is also a fan of the intimate, compact nature of the current facilities and does not want that to be lost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd his eye for detail extends to requesting that investment be made in new equipment to allow the ground staff to maintain the training pitches to the same degree that the City Ground\u2019s pitch is carefully manicured.\n\nSignificant money could be invested to level off the slight slope on some of the playing surfaces at the training ground, where Cooper has already overseen significant changes to the previously cramped meeting rooms to create a more welcoming environment.\n\n\u201cHe might as well have a rotating door in his office, because there are players in and out of there so often,\u201d Cook says. \u201cHe is very approachable. He is a good laugh. You don\u2019t want your work environment to be an entirely serious place. (But) there is a line you need to remain on the right side of. Their expectations are very high. It all stems from that.\u201d\n\nAfter Cooper was appointed, Joe Lolley revealed the new manager had held individual meetings with every single player to garner their thoughts on where things stood at Forest. It is a habit Cooper has maintained in the eight months since. Every player has been offered help or guidance of some sort.\n\nWhen regular captain Lewis Grabban was injured and out for most of the season\u2019s final three months, Cooper worked extensively with stand-in Joe Worrall on the challenges and demands of wearing the armband for a club of Forest\u2019s stature \u2014 and encouraged him to think about what kind of skipper he wants to be.\n\nWorrall has had to work on aspects of the role \u2014 including being more of a leader when other players are late for meetings or for training and need reminding of their responsibilities. Worrall\u2019s performances on the pitch have gone up another level this season, as have those of fellow defender Scott McKenna.\n\nBut while the academy product has never been short of confidence, the Scotsman, in contrast, has been encouraged not to be so self-critical.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcKenna would focus on every mistake or poor pass despite the fact that he \u2014 like Worrall \u2014 is hugely respected for his strong, no-nonsense displays and ability to carry the ball out from the back. Along with the experienced Cook and the resurgent Tobias Figueiredo, Forest have built one of English football\u2019s strongest defensive units outside of the Premier League.\n\nWhen Yates was left out of the starting XI, Cooper spoke to him to explain his thinking. The midfielder, respectfully but firmly, informed his manager that he was making a mistake. Cooper, far from being annoyed, loves the attitude of the 24-year-old, who is always the first into meetings and the last to leave the training pitch.\n\nRyan Yates has been in brilliant form under Cooper (Photo: Jon Hobley/MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nWhen Max Lowe was sidelined with injury for the rest of the season in early March, Cooper took midfielder Jack Colback to one side to explain that he would be putting his faith in him to fill the void at left wing-back. His impressive performances culminated in him scoring a contender for goal of the season against West Bromwich Albion.\n\n\u201cThere is so much more improvement we can make still but we have come so, so far since the manager came in, and that is credit to him,\u201d Yates says. \u201cI look back at my clips from his first games in charge and from more recent games and some of the movements he wanted from me, I now do without even thinking.\u201d\n\nEven when they had time off during the March international break, the players could not escape Cooper\u2019s demands.\n\n\u201cThe gaffer was dropping messages into the group chat, reminding us to keep focused for when we come back,\u201d says on-loan Aston Villa forward Keinan Davis. \u201cHe just makes sure that we keep our eye on the ball. It is always about the next match.\u201d\n\nIt says much that Davis and Lowe, who is on loan from Sheffield United, that both wanted to stay at Forest to complete their rehab from injuries rather than returning to their parent clubs.\n\n\u201cIt is great that they want to stay here,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cThey are part of it. They are popular lads and they have made friends here. We just need to shut Keinan up a little bit!\u201d\n\nThe appetite for Premier League football was only whetted by Forest\u2019s FA Cup run, which saw them beat recent winners Arsenal and Leicester City, as well as eventual play-off final opponents Huddersfield Town, before eventually being narrowly beaten by quadruple-chasing Liverpool in the last eight.\n\nForest may not have made it to the Wembley semi-finals because of that 1-0 loss to a club who would win both domestic cups, finish as runners-up in the Premier League by one point and lose Saturday\u2019s Champions League final to the only goal, but Cooper did go along to observe as he looks to continue his own football education.\n\n\u201cIt was an amazing spectacle,\u201d he says. \u201cI am a football nut. I am always up for seeing what might be new, what is happening in the game \u2014 in foreign football as well. You are always looking for something; always looking for ideas.\u201d\n\nWhat was telling in those FA Cup ties was how Forest took the game to their opposition. It is a mindset that has seen them now clinch promotion under Cooper, restoring the club to the top flight for the first time since the 1990s.\n\n\u201cWe do not fear anyone,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cThere is no player I have come up against that has made me think, \u2018I need to be on the back foot\u2019. The gaffer wants us to be positive, on the front foot all over the pitch. We are all confident and believe we can run over teams. That is why we score a lot of goals. We keep going in games, we never change our approach.\n\n\u201cIt was not great at the start here. But once the gaffer came in, things changed so quickly. I cannot speak highly enough about the club.\u201d\n\nIt says much that even an arch-rival can appreciate the job Cooper has done.\n\nDerby defender Curtis Davies played in both the 1-1 draw at Pride Park, which earned Hughton his only point of the season in August, and as Forest won 2-1 in January\u2019s reverse fixture under Cooper.\n\nEven Derby\u2019s Davies can appreciate the impact Cooper has made at arch-rivals Forest (Photo: Mick Walker \u2013 CameraSport via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cRegardless of my feelings about the club, it\u2019s clear he\u2019s done a fantastic job,\u201d Davies tells The Athletic. \u201cUnfortunately, him coming into the club was at the expense of my former manager (Davies worked with Hughton at Birmingham City), someone I have huge respect for \u2014 but at the start of the season, the club had lost a bit of its spark.\n\n\u201cWhen we played them earlier in the season, I think it was a game where Chrissy was on the verge of losing his job and in the second half they basically threw the game at us. They ended up getting the equaliser.\n\n\u201cThe second game, I don\u2019t think there was much in it. But they won the game and played some great football. Keinan Davis has been a great signing, Brennan Johnson has been used really well, leaving him up the pitch to frustrate teams. Not only has he got pace, he\u2019s got skill to break down teams on the counter.\n\n\u201c(Cooper) feels like a perfect fit for the club. Not just the way he wants to play football but his personality. Forest was a squad that was full of players who all thought they should be playing at Championship level, every week. That\u2019s one to 20 who all felt like they should be playing. He\u2019s found a way of keeping people onside. He keeps them ready and keeps them motivated. A hands-on coach but one who people want to work for.\u201d\n\nCloser to home, another experienced defender in Cook \u2014 who signed in January from a Bournemouth side bound for automatic promotion to the Premier League \u2014 has been equally impressed.\n\n\u201cI can appreciate the job he has done. You hear stories of how training used to be before he came in; about how we used to play and how things have changed \u2014 in just such a short amount of time,\u201d Cook says.\n\n\u201cNeil Warnock used to say that 90 per cent of being a manager is about man-management. I don\u2019t know whether that is true but that management side of the game \u2014 dealing with young players, knowing how you can speak to players now and treat them has changed so much.\n\n\u201cThe way that the manager does it here is a perfect example of how to do it. You have to speak to players in a certain way now, when they are on the pitch; you have to put your views across \u2014 there is an understanding of the game on the pitch that is needed, because the game is so tactical now.\n\n\u201cIt is a chess game. You (as a player) have to understand what you are being asked to do. For me, learning that from him has improved me.\u201d\n\nDo not expect things to change too much in the Premier League.\n\n\u201cIt is important to stick to what you do more than ever. Why change? That is my feeling. Stick to the plan. Make sacrifices every day. Plan, prepare and review as you have done all season,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cIf it has been a good enough way of working, it will get you to where you want to be.\n\n\u201cIf it does not, then somebody else has a go, don\u2019t they? That is the way it works. That is it really: stick to the plan. Believe in it.\u201d\n\nForest have had 21 permanent managers since they were last in the top flight in 1999.\n\nWith Cooper being mentioned in wedding speeches due to his success, is it any wonder this has proven to be the union that has finally taken them back to the Premier League?\n\nOther contributors: Phil Buckingham and Daniel Taylor\n\n(Top photos: Getty Images; design: Sam Richardson using Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/that-type-football-steve-cooper-18964038", "page_content": "Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nNever miss breaking news by signing up to our free email updates\n\nSteve Cooper believes Swansea City deserved the victory despite being held to a 0-0 draw by Birmingham City.\n\nThe Swans head coach identified the contributions of Neil Etheridge and Lukas Jutkiewicz as Blues built on last weekend\u2019s success against Brentford.\n\nHowever, he insists the hosts controlled the second half but were unable to find their way past the Blues goalkeeper.\n\n\u201cWe are frustrated not to win the game, we should always be if we don\u2019t win home games - not from a lack of trying.\n\n\u201cWe had some good moments, started well didn\u2019t quite carry the momentum and let them get on the ball\n\nSign up to our Birmingham City newsletter here\n\n\u201cSecond half I thought we completely controlled the game in their half but just didn\u2019t do enough to get chances at their goal.\n\n\u201cThe goalkeeper has made an excellent save from Marc [Guehi] late on and we got in good positions but the frustration is we didn\u2019t do more.\n\n\u201cWe are still getting up to speed we have only been in four weeks now, that\u2019s only two-thirds of your pre-season.

But they more than made up for it as the ball began bouncing their way in a one-sided first half at a bouncing City Ground.\n\nThe game first hinged on Forest's opener from the penalty spot.\n\nFurlong, booked just three minutes earlier for a daft, needless late challenge on Philip Zinckernagel, was lying prone on the ground when James Garner's shot hit his arm. But referee David Webb decided that it was deliberate handball, sent off Furlong and awarded Forest a penalty.\n\nJohnson struck it powerfully low into the left corner, beating Baggies keeper David Button's despairing dive. And, just four minutes later, Forest had a second goal when the officials unquestionably made a mistake.\n\nThey awarded a throw-in the wrong way, and Albion's defence, caught badly wrongfooted, were panicked into conceding the corner from which Yates headed home - from Garner's right-wing flag-kick - to double the home lead.\n\nThen came Colback's wonder strike on the stroke of half-time. The ball bounced up to the wing-back on the left side of the pitch and he launched a wicked, dipping volley over David Button from 25 yards.\n\nWith the game won and Albion's spirited 10 men left running on fumes, Forest could have won by more but they could manage just a very late fourth.\n\nJanuary deadline day signing Surridge ran onto a neat through ball to power his shot over Button for his fourth goal for the club - to match last month's 4-0 win over Reading as Forest's best of the season.\n\nIt was also Albion's heaviest league defeat of the season - and their worst at second-tier level since losing by the same scoreline at Leeds in March 2019.\n\nNottingham Forest boss Steve Cooper:\n\n\"To win a game 4-0, you have to do a lot of things well. We took real control. We forced them into a situation where they were down to 10 men. We forced the 1-0, the 2-0 and got the third.\n\n\"Jack Colback was excellent, man of the match. He is not a character who generally craves extra praise. He is a bit of a throwback on that front. I'm not going to argue with him if he said he meant it.\n\n\"It is one of the best goals we have seen at the City Ground this season, even if we have seen a few good ones. The fourth goal was good as well. I don't know how many passes there were involved.\n\n\"The thing that mattered most was our attitude and approach. We felt really hard done by on Friday when a lot of the decisions and things did not go our way.\"\n\nWest Bromwich Albion boss Steve Bruce told BBC Radio WM:\n\n\"It was an awful night that went against us. Is it a penalty? It's debatable. Is it a red card? That was ludicrous.\n\n\"Then we got that linesman's decision go against us, and the fourth official gets in the ref's ear. And, within 20 minutes, we've got a red card, a penalty and another decision and the game's over.\n\n\"Forest are the form team in the division and you can understand why. It was always going to be difficult for us.\n\n\"But, while you know you need to put in a performance, you also need the officials to do their job. I don't usually complain as I know they have a difficult enough task as it is but you need them to be better and, unfortunately, they were awful.\""}, {"url": "https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-team-news-albion-6264959", "page_content": "Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nGet Reds transfer latest, team news, match updates and analysis delivered straight to your inbox\n\nBoss Steve Cooper makes four changes to his Nottingham Forest line-up for the Friday night clash with West Bromwich Albion.\n\nThe Reds go into the match at The Hawthorns looking to get back to winning ways, after successive draws.\n\nThey are unbeaten in five, but had to settle for a point in midweek as Luton Town held them to a goalless stalemate at the City Ground.\n\nMidfielder Jack Colback was sent off in the second half against the Hatters, so is missing this evening through suspension.

We wanted to really put pressure on West Brom, with and without the ball - and then fall back into position when we got the ball, then try to stick to how we play.\n\n\u201cThey were only subtle changes. I just asked the strikers to play a little bit wider. It was still two strikers, just playing slightly wider.\n\n\u201cWe felt we could get down the sides of West Brom and play the high line.\n\n\u201cWe wanted Phil (Zinckernagel) to go on to the three-man press, really go after their back three, and our wing-backs drop on to their wing-backs.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to play with a bit more intensity without the ball.

I know they had a couple of good moments in the first half, but I didn\u2019t feel like we were ever getting peppered in the game.\n\n\u201cI just felt the game was there to play a bit better than what we did.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m slightly annoyed at it, really.\u201d\n\nThe Reds have still lost just once since Cooper took charge in September, and have made great strides under his stewardship.\n\nThe Welshman felt the progress they have made wasn\u2019t on show at The Hawthorns, however, calling on his team to prove they are better than their display in the West Midlands.\n\nSign on to join the Reds debate We want your views, Reds fans.

A debatable penalty proved the difference between the two sides, on an afternoon when the visitors were not at their best.\n\nThey had their chances to get something from the game, including seeing a Djed Spence goal ruled out for an offside decision which Cooper disputed.

They gave my first start at 38,\" said Bruce.\n\n\"To go back couldn't be more difficult, but every game's tough in this league.\"\n\nBruce, now aged 61, told BBC Radio WM: \"That's what I've always loved about the Championship. It's a tough but a fair league.\n\n\"It's not like the Premier League where the top six are pretty much who you expect them to be every season, but it's a fair league.\"\n\nBruce's first game as a boss was as Blades player-manager way back in August 1998.\n\nSteve Bruce was only with Sheffield United for a season - but was involved in one of the biggest controversies of his 1,000 games as a boss in February 1999 when the furore of Marc Overmars' 'goal' in an FA Cup fifth-round tie against Arsenal at Highbury led to the game being replayed\n\nBut he is now up against a United side going well under Paul Heckingbottom with seven wins from their past nine league games.\n\nThat followed a poor start to the season, including a 4-0 defeat at The Hawthorns in August, which ultimately cost Slavisa Jokanovic his job - and if the Blades, in 10th, won by three goals or more, they would even go above sixth-placed Albion in the table.\n\n\"I saw Sheffield United last week,\" said Bruce. \"They've still got the nucleus of a Premier League squad. But, tough start or not, we still have an outstanding chance to go up there and get a result.\"\n\nBruce's Baggies old boys\n\nIf you have had as many clubs as Bruce has had, you build up a lot of contacts in the game - and he has already run into several old faces who have played for him.\n\nGoalkeeper Sam Johnstone, set to return to the team now his fall-out with previous boss Valerien Ismael is gone and forgotten, was Bruce's loan keeper at Aston Villa.\n\nBruce also worked with Jake Livermore and Conor Townsend at Hull City, while he took Andy Carroll back to Newcastle United, before Albion's new striker was let go again last summer.\n\n\"One of the biggest parts of this job is seeing lads who you've had before and watching them flourish as their career develops,\" added Bruce. \"I'm looking forward to working with them again.\n\n\"I took Jake Livermore from Tottenham a long time ago and watched him come through. He did fantastically well for me and he's been a great servant for Albion too.\n\n\"Conor Townsend is another. I remember saying well done to him on the pitch last year [when Albion played Newcastle]. I'm delighted to see how he's improved and modelled his career.\"\n\nAndy Carroll is one of four players Steve Bruce has worked with before, having taken him back to Newcastle in 2019\n\nAs to how Albion shape up on Wednesday against a Blades side now without injured striker Rhian Brewster and possibly also defender Jack Robinson, who missed Friday's 2-1 win at Birmingham with tonsillitis, Bruce is expected to start all four of his old boys.\n\nBut otherwise he is giving nothing away, except the need for misfiring Albion to be more flexible than they were under Ismael - one of the discontented Baggies fans' main moans.\n\n\"We won't implement huge changes straight away but we will change,\" said Bruce. \"Val Ismael's a very good man who plays a certain way and sticks with it. But I do believe you have to have the scope and flexibility to change at times.\"\n\nBruce's backroom staff\n\nAs for the men he will have with him in the away dugout at Bramall Lane, that is a tried and trusted mixture of old and new.\n\nBruce's old Birmingham City midfield general Stephen Clemence, who has been with him at his past six clubs, and Steve Agnew, who first worked under him at Aston Villa, are back with him at The Hawthorns.\n\nAnd he has also brought in his own son Alex Bruce as coach to supplement a backroom staff already containing his long-time friend and former Manchester United team-mate Gary Walsh, the goalkeeping coach, who also worked for him at Hull City and Villa, and former Albion midfielder James Morrison.\n\nThe three Steves - Clemence, Bruce and Agnew\n\n\"Stephen Clemence and Steve Agnew have been with me a long time,\" said Bruce. \"I've also brought along my son.\n\n\"Alex was desperate to get into coaching. He's done all his badges. A bit like when I started Stephen Clemence off when he retired at 32.\n\n\"It's nice to have a bit of a younger voice in and around you, especially when you're getting a bit older and things change.\n\nAlex Bruce, who helped his dad to two of his four Championship promotions with Hull City, has taken on his first coaching role at The Hawthorns\n\n\"Gary Walsh I've known a long time. And James Morrison has been a great player for this club. He wants to coach, he's hungry and I wanted to keep him part of it.\n\n\"There's a lot of good people here at the club. And I didn't want to make too much change.\"\n\nSteve Bruce was talking to BBC Radio WM's Rob Gurney."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/02/valerien-ismael-sacked-as-west-brom-head-coach-after-just-over-seven-months", "page_content": "Steve Bruce is being seriously considered by the West Bromwich Albion hierarchy to replace the sacked Val\u00e9rien Isma\u00ebl. The former Aston Villa and Birmingham manager suggested he would not return to the dugout after leaving Newcastle in October but has been identified as an ideal candidate to help the flagging Championship side.\n\nIsma\u00ebl\u2019s remit was to win promotion this season but the club are fifth and in danger of dropping out of the play-offs. He has departed less than 12 months into a four-year contract after three defeats in the past four matches.\n\nLast month West Brom sanctioned the signing of Daryl Dike, who worked with Isma\u00ebl at Barnsley, but the striker has since been ruled out for two months with a hamstring injury. Last week Isma\u00ebl dropped the goalkeeper Sam Johnstone after a row, and other players were unconvinced by the Frenchman\u2019s methods.\n\nIsma\u00ebl was appointed on 24 June after West Brom paid compensation to take him from Barnsley but supporters have been critical of results and the team\u2019s direct style. Isma\u00ebl guided Barnsley to fifth in the Championship last season, after taking over in October 2020 with the club 21st.\n\n\u201cWest Bromwich Albion Football Club can confirm Val\u00e9rien Isma\u00ebl has today left his position as head coach,\u201d a statement said. \u201cAssistant head coach Adam Murray has also departed.\u201d\n\nIsma\u00ebl succeeded Sam Allardyce after West Brom\u2019s relegation and won four and drew one of his first five league games. Andy Carroll was another forward signed in January but he played once before Isma\u00ebl\u2019s exit.\n\nQuick Guide Championship: costly defeats for Derby and Barnsley Show Derby County and Barnsley both remain mired in the Championship relegation zone after defeats on Wednesday. Two late goals saw Huddersfield past Wayne Rooney's side, while the Tykes lost 1-0 at home to fellow strugglers Cardiff. Derby had lost just one of their last seven league games but suffered a huge blow after only three minutes when Richard Stearman was sent off for a studs-up challenge on Lewis O'Brien. Duane Holmes (pictured) went close three times for Huddersfield in the first half, with Louis Sibley sending a shot just wide for the visitors. In the second half, Derby continued to frustrate their opponents and were 15 minutes from a priceless point when Holmes' shot flicked off Krystian Bielik and looped beyond keeper Ryan Allsop. Substitute Jordan Rhodes secured victory on the rebound after Allsop had parried Danny Ward's shot, as Huddersfield climbed to fifth in the table. At Oakwell, on-loan substitute Uche Ikpeazu scored the only goal for Cardiff, just eight minutes after coming on for his debut. The tall forward latched on to a long ball forward and held off a defender before scuffing his shot into the bottom corner. Aaron Leya Iseka thought he had snatched a point for Barnsley in stoppage time, but was flagged offside. Victory allows Cardiff to move nine points clear of the bottom three as Barnsley (eight points) and Derby (seven) remain a long way behind Reading in 21st place.
