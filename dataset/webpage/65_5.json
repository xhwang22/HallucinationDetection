Thanks for your support!\n\nBackground\n\nThe Washington Freedom was one of eight original franchises in the Women\u2019s United Soccer Association (WUSA). The WUSA formed in April 2000 in an effort to capitalize on the extraordinary success of the 1999 Women\u2019s World Cup in the United States.\n\nThe financial backers of the league were a consortium of cable television companies including Comcast, Cox Communications and Time Warner Cable and a pair cable industry executives, John Hendricks and Amos Hostetter. Each investor claimed operating rights to one (or more) of the WUSA\u2019s eight clubs. The Maryland-based Hendricks chose the Washington D.C. franchise. Along with his wife Maureen, Hendricks would become the most commited benefactor of the women\u2019s pro game in its first decade.\n\nWUSA\n\nEach WUSA franchise received an allocation of three \u201cFounders\u201d \u2013 the members of the U.S. Women\u2019s National Team that electrified the nation during the 1999 Women\u2019s World Cup. The Freedom received midfielder Michelle French, goalkeeper Siri Mullinix and the ultimate prize, forward Mia Hamm. Hamm was the transcendent star of the women\u2019s game and, in many respects, the player on whose shoulders the aspirations of the WUSA rested. The league\u2019s other seven clubs routinely drew their best crowds when Mia and the Freedom came to town.\n\nThe Freedom hosted the WUSA\u2019s inaugural game at RFK Stadium on April 14th, 2001. The match pitted Hamm\u2019s Freedom against the Bay Area CyberRays, who featured the league\u2019s other biggest star, 1999 World Cup final hero Brandi Chastain. In the 69th minute, Chastain was called for a foul on Hamm in the penalty area. Brazilian forward Pretinha converted the ensuing penalty kick for the first goal in WUSA history. The Freedom won 1-0 and the RFK assemblage of 34,148 fans remains the largest women\u2019s pro soccer crowd in U.S. history nearly two decades later.\n\nThe 2001 Freedom were a disappointment on the field, finishing in 7th place with a 6-12-3 record. At the turnstiles, the Freedom led the WUSA in attendance with 14,421 fans per match. They would ultimately finish first in attendance for all three years that the WUSA operated, helped by the enduring appeal of Hamm and a series of attendance-inflating doubleheaders with D.C. United of Major League Soccer.\n\nBack-to-Back Founders Cup Appearances\n\nIn 2002 the Freedom added the emerging U.S. National Team star Abby Wambach in the college draft. Wambach led the Freedom in both goals (10) and assists (9) en route to Rookie-of-the-Year honors. The Freedom advanced to the 2002 Founders Cup championship game on August 24, 2002 in Atlanta where they lost 3-2 to the Carolina Courage.\n\nOne year to the day later, the Freedom returned to play in Founders Cup III against the Atlanta Beat in San Diego, California. The Freedom were the lowest seed in the WUSA playoffs, but upset the top-seed Boston Breakers on penalty kick in the semi-final. In the final, the Freedom ousted the Beat 2-1 on a pair of Wambach goals, including a golden goal during sudden-death overtime.\n\nThe euphoria was short-lived. The WUSA folded less than a month later on September 15, 2003.\n\n2004-2008: Into The Wilderness\n\nAlone among the WUSA\u2019s eight franchises, the Freedom soldiered onward after the demise of the league, thanks to the financial backing of the Hendricks family. The Freedom moved out of RFK to the more intimate and afforable Maryland SoccerPlex. The great senior National Team stars like Hamm and Wambach fell away from club soccer, playing only in residence and international competition with the U.S. National Team. Hamm retired following the 2004 Athens Olympics and a 10-match farewell tour of the U.S. with her USWNT teammates.\n\nThe Freedom played a series of exhibition matches in 2004 and 2005. In 2006 the Freedom played a more structured schedule of exhibitions, competing in home-and-home friendlies against several East Coast-based clubs in the amateur W-League. A new generation of U.S. U-21 National Team players such as Ali Krieger and Joanna Lohman suited up for the Freedom during this era.\n\nThe Freedom joined the W-League as a full-fledged member in 2007, participating in a true league table for the first time since the WUSA\u2019s final campaign in 2003. They defeated the Atlanta Silverbacks 3-1 in the 2007 W-League championship game.\n\nAll the while, plans were afoot to launch a new women\u2019s pro league in the U.S. to replace the old WUSA. The new league announced its formation (but not yet its name) in 2007 with an anticipated 2008 debut. Washington expected to leave the W-League for the new pro circuit in 2008, but the league\u2019s launch was delayed until April 2009. The Freedom played one final amateur season in the W-League in 2008.\n\nMeanwhile, the name of the new women\u2019s league was announced in January 2008: Women\u2019s Professional Soccer (WPS). The league\u2019s logo was a silhouette of the now-retired Mia Hamm.\n\n2009-2010 Women\u2019s Professional Soccer\n\nAs they had in WUSA eight years earlier, the Washington Freedom played in the inaugural match from Women\u2019s Professional Soccer on March 29, 2009. It was the club\u2019s first professional match in nearly six years. Once again, the match featured the league\u2019s two biggest stars: Brazilian forward Marta of the Los Angeles Sol and Wambach, returning to the Freedom after a six-year absence. The crowd was much smaller though. 14,382 turned out at the Home Depot Center in suburban L.A. to witness the Sol\u2019s 2-0 victory.\n\nWambach and Lori Lindsey were the only players to return from the WUSA-era Freedom. The club also brought back a number players that played for the team during their W-League/exhibition years. Key newcomers included USWNT defender Cat Whitehill, Japanese striker Homare Sawa and French midfielder Sonia Bompastor.\n\nBesides Hendricks, Wambach and Lindsey, there was one other holdover from the WUSA era who requires mention here. Jim Gabarra was the Freedom\u2019s only head coach in its long and winding history. Unfortunately, that history was about to come to an end.\n\nWPS wobbled into its second season in the spring of 2010. The league\u2019s Los Angeles franchise abruptly closed its doors after the college draft in January. The league was dealt another embarrassing black eye when St. Louis Athletica folded in midseason in late May. Crowds were down across the league, including in Washington where averaged attendance dipped below 4,000 per match at the Maryland SoccerPlex. In September the Freedom went out in the first round of the WPS playoffs for the second straight year.\n\nDemise & Aftermath\n\nAs the 2010 season ended, John & Maureen Hendricks revealed they were seeking new investors for the club. Up until this point, the Freedom were not considered to be one of WPS\u2019 many trouble spots. Soon enough it became clear that the Hendricks\u2019 were through with WPS.\n\nIn November 2010, they handed the keys to the franchise to Dan Borislow, the wealthy communications entrepreneur behind the MagicJack Voice over IP device that was ubiquitous on late night cable TV commercials during the aughts. Borislow moved the club to his home base of West Palm Beach, Florida and renamed it MagicJack after his signature product. The story of MagicJack is too twisted to get into here, but Borislow turned out to be a deeply corrosive figure in the already badly weakened league. Borislow immediately alienated just about everyone involved with WPS. His fellow owners terminated the franchise in October 2011 to get him out of the league. The league itself folded three months later in January 2012.\n\nWomen\u2019s pro soccer returned to the Maryland SoccerPlex in 2013 with the formation of the National Women\u2019s Soccer League and the Washington Spirit franchise. Former Freedom head coach Jim Gabarra coached the Spirit from 2016 to 2018.\n\nWashington Freedom Shop\n\nWashington Freedom Video\n\nThe Freedom host St. Louis Athletica at the Maryland SoccerPlex in 2009.

The Freedom was founded in 2001 as a member of the defunct Women's United Soccer Association. Since 2004, the Freedom had played its home games at the Maryland SoccerPlex. In 2011, the team relocated to Boca Raton, Florida and became magicJack.\n\nWUSA (2001\u201303)\n\nThe team played its home games at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in Washington, D.C., where the team offices were also located. The team's \"founding players\" (players from the national team allocated three to each WUSA team) were Mia Hamm, Siri Mullinix and Michelle French. The team was expected by some to be one of the best in the league but finished seventh out of the eight teams their first season.\n\nHowever, this finish allowed the Freedom to select Abby Wambach as their first pick in the 2002 WUSA draft. Additional personnel changes, better performance from retained players, and a Mia Hamm improved by off-season knee surgery led to a far better finish, as Washington went undefeated in their last eight matches and finished in third place (only two points out of first). In the postseason, they won their semifinal match against the Philadelphia Charge, 1\u20130, and went to the Founders Cup, the WUSA championship match, which they lost, 3\u20132, to the Carolina Courage.\n\nIn 2003, the Freedom were just good enough to make the playoffs, clinching the fourth and final spot with two games to go. However, they would go on to beat the regular season champion Boston Breakers in the semifinals, 0\u20130 (3\u20131 penalty kick shootout), and then defeated the Atlanta Beat in the Founders Cup, 2\u20131, in overtime. It was the last Golden Goal in a FIFA-sanctioned first-division league before the practice was changed.\n\nExhibition years (2004\u201305)\n\nAfter the WUSA folded, the Freedom maintained an existence as the Washington Freedom Soccer Club, moving their home stadium to the Maryland Soccerplex and putting together a team called the Washington Freedom Reserves, which consisted of half-a-dozen players from the WUSA days along with young local players. In 2004, they played assorted exhibition matches against college and W-League teams and participated in the WUSA Festivals.\n\nIn 2005, the roster was significantly upgraded by adding former WUSA players like Tiffany Roberts, Kylie Bivens, and Emily Janss, as well as players Ali Krieger and Joanna Lohman from the U-21 National Team. The team also brought in former star soccer players Sun Wen and Brandi Chastain as guest players for one game each. In a season of exhibition matches, almost all against W-League teams, the Freedom compiled a 7\u20132\u20132 record.\n\nW-League (2006\u201308)\n\nThe team became an associate member of the W-League in 2006 and played an exhibition season based on home-and-home series against east coast W-League teams. Then, on December 7, 2006, Washington announced that they had acquired a full W-League franchise.\n\nIn 2007, playing games that mattered for the first time since 2003, the Freedom compiled a 12\u20131\u20131 record, defeated the regular season champion Ottawa Fury in the Eastern Conference championship game, then went on to beat the Atlanta Silverbacks, 3\u20131, in the W-League championship match.\n\nIn 2008, the Freedom went 11\u20131\u20132 in the regular season, winning the Northeast Division, then defeated the Atlanta Silverbacks, 2\u20131, to capture the Eastern Conference championship, but then fell to the eventual W-League champion Pali Blues, 2\u20130, in the W-League semifinals.\n\nWomen's Professional Soccer: The first season (2009)\n\nWhen the Women's Professional Soccer league formed in 2008, the Freedom became one of the original seven teams that started play in 2009.\n\nThe coaching staff went to considerable lengths to retain as many players with past Freedom experience as possible. The initial WPS player allocation, announced on September 16, 2008, assigned US Women's National Team players Abby Wambach, Cat Whitehill and Ali Krieger to the Freedom. Wambach had played for the Freedom in 2002 and 2003, while Krieger played for the Washington Freedom Reserves in 2004 and 2005, and for the W-League team in 2007.\n\nIn the 2008 WPS International Draft, conducted on September 24, 2008, the Freedom selected Japanese striker Homare Sawa, French players Sonia Bompastor and Louisa Necib and Australian forward Lisa De Vanna. Following the draft, the Freedom named Erin McLeod and Lene Mykj\u00e5land as post-draft discovery players.\n\nFollowing that was the 2008 WPS General Draft on October 6, 2008, and all of the players selected by the Freedom were from the Freedom's 2008 W-League roster: Sarah Huffman, Becky Sauerbrunn, Lori Lindsey and Emily Janss. Lindsey had been on the Freedom roster since the final WUSA season in 2003, and Janss had been with the team since 2005.\n\nThe 2009 WPS Draft took place on January 16, 2009. The Freedom drafted Allie Long, Alex Singer, Jill Gilbeau, Parrissa Eyorokon, Briana Scurry, Rebecca Moros, Sarah Senty, Kati Jo Spisak, Claire Zimmeck, and Christen Karniski. Additionally, the Freedom received the rights to Joanna Lohman in a trade with Saint Louis Athletica. All of the players except for Long, Eyorokon, and Scurry had previous experience playing for the Freedom's W-League team.\n\nTwo players were added to the roster after tryouts and training camp: Kristin DeDycker and Madison Keller. Keller had experience with the Freedom going back to 2004, while DeDycker (n\u00e9e Warren) had played for the Atlanta Beat in the WUSA.\n\nMcLeod was intended to be the starting goalkeeper, but visa issues kept her unavailable through the first five matches of the regular season, and the Freedom had mixed success with Briana Scurry and Kati Jo Spisak in goal. Following her arrival, though, the Freedom won three out of the next six matches while only losing once.\n\nAbby Wambach, meanwhile, was recovering from a broken leg and didn't feel fully recovered until late in the season, when she returned from national team duty having scored her 100th international goal. She then went on a tear, scoring five goals and two assists in the team's final four games. The Freedom won three of those four matches and thereby clinched third place in the standings and a home playoff match. But despite looking strong going into the playoff match, and coming off a solid 3\u20131 victory over their opponents, Sky Blue FC, they put on a listless performance and were eliminated from the playoffs, 2\u20131.\n\nWomen's Professional Soccer: season two (2010)\n\nUnlike most of the other WPS teams, the Freedom made only limited changes in the offseason. The marquee signing was of young forward Lene Mykj\u00e5land from the Norwegian national team, followed by picking up Nikki Marshall, Beverly Goebel, Kristi Eveland, and Caitlin Miskel in the 2010 college draft. The team then signed Christie Welsh, who had helped lead the 2007 Freedom to the W-League championship before being drafted by the WPS Los Angeles Sol and then traded to the St. Louis Athletica. Brittany Bock was acquired in the dispersal draft to place former Los Angeles Sol players. Marisa Abegg and Meagan McCray were brought in after going unsigned by their former WPS team, FC Gold Pride. After the St. Louis Athletica folded, the Freedom signed their 2010 second-round draft pick Ashlyn Harris, who went on to become the starting goalkeeper after Erin McLeod tore her ACL in a match on July 24. On August 5, the Freedom traded their rights to Nigerian defender Faith Ikidi to the Chicago Red Stars for English national team defender Anita Asante.\n\nPlayers did not return for several reasons. Lori Lindsey and Sarah Senty were picked up in the expansion draft by the Philadelphia Independence, one of the two new WPS teams for 2010. Lindsey had originally joined the team in 2003 during its last year in the WUSA, while Senty joined the W-League team in 2007. Ali Krieger signed a two-year contract with FFC Frankfurt, keeping her there into 2012. Other players with extended Freedom experience not re-signed included Emily Janss (since 2005), Joanna Lohman (2005), Kati Jo Spisak (2007), and Christen Karniski (2008). Additionally, Alex Singer, who joined the W-League team in 2007, was cut on August 5 to make room for Anita Asante.\n\nThe Freedom started their season solidly in April and May, with a 4\u20132\u20131 record good enough for second place. However, in July and August they went on a ten-game winless streak ending with five losses in a row that put them out of playoff position and put head coach Gabarra's job in jeopardy. Longtime assistant coach Clyde Watson resigned and former Chicago Red Stars head coach Emma Hayes was hired as a consultant. The team rebounded to finish the regular season 4\u20131\u20132, good enough for the fourth and final playoff position. That led to a road match against the Philadelphia Independence, which the Freedom lost on a goal from Amy Rodriguez in the waning seconds of overtime, wasting a superb performance from rookie backup goalkeeper Ashlyn Harris.\n\nFollowing the season, Gabarra announced his resignation, citing \"irreconcilable differences\" between himself and team management.\n\nWomen's Professional Soccer: purchase, relocation, and termination (2011)\n\nFinancial troubles that had stirred in the background during the middle of the previous season came to the front during the offseason, with the longtime team owners finally deciding to back out after ten years of supporting the club. With multiple teams having trouble making offseason payments, the league was under threat of folding.\n\nDan Borislow, owner of the phone service MagicJack, bought the Freedom in 2011. He changed the team name to Magicjack and moved the team to Boca Raton, Florida. He quickly came into conflict with the players and owners of other teams and the league terminated the franchise on October 25, 2011, accusing Borislow of misconduct. The WPS subsequently cancelled the 2012 season and the WPS ceased to exist.\n\nMost recent squad\n\nThis was the final roster to play under the Washington Freedom name.\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

The team won the WUSA Founders Cup III in their final year, shortly before the league announced on September 15, 2003, that it was suspending operations. Unique among the WUSA teams, though, the Freedom maintained a continued existence, playing exhibition seasons in 2004 and 2005, then joining the USL W-League in 2006 and winning the W-League Championship in 2007. The Freedom became a part of Women's Professional Soccer that launched in April 2009 and participated in that league in 2009 and 2010. The team was then sold, moved to Florida, and renamed MagicJack.\n\nDespite the addition of a professional team, the Freedom maintained an elite amateur team, which played in the W-League in 2009 and 2010, finishing second in the league in 2009.\n\nHead coaches\n\nJim Gabarra 2001\u20132010\n\nStadia\n\nRobert F.
