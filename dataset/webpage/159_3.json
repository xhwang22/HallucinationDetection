{"David Collings made his stage debut in 1962.": [{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/26/david-collings-obituary", "page_content": "After a spectacular start to his television career in the 1960s, when he played leading roles in two classics by Dostoevsky, the actor David Collings, who has died aged 79, became a cult favourite of sci-fi fans with weird appearances in UFO (produced by the Thunderbirds team of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson), three Doctor Who sagas and the 1979 supernatural detective series Sapphire and Steel, co-starring Joanna Lumley and David McCallum.\n\nAlthough he started out on the stage, Collings did not consolidate his reputation there until completing more than a decade of television stardom, after which he was in a string of important roles for the Royal Shakespeare Company.\n\nAt the Open Air theatre in Regent\u2019s Park he was a genuinely funny Polonius opposite newcomer Damian Lewis\u2019s firebrand Hamlet in 1994, directed by Tim Pigott-Smith; he had first played a tetchy but benignly well-meaning Polonius for an RSC touring production with Philip Franks in 1987.\n\nCollings was a fine featured, red-haired actor with sensitive blue eyes who was equally good at playing neurotic and sweet-natured characters. On television he also ran a good line in eminent characters from history: Percy Grainger in Ken Russell\u2019s Song of Summer (1968), Sir Anthony Babington in Elizabeth R (1971), John Ruskin in The Love School (1975), William Wilberforce in The Fight Against Slavery (1975) and William Pitt in Prince Regent (1979).\n\nHe was born in Brighton, East Sussex, to George Collings, a greengrocer, and his wife, Lillian (nee Parsons). At Varndean grammar school he enjoyed acting but had no thoughts of setting out to be a professional actor and, on leaving, started work as a designer in lettering, inheriting that interest from his father, a keen artist. From 1960 he was happily involved in amateur dramatics for the Withdean Players and the Lewes Little theatre, but then was recommended by the actor Freda Dowie to the director David Scase, who had been appointed to run the Liverpool Rep.\n\nAfter six months in rep, Collings found himself pitched into television through another unsolicited recommendation, this time from the actor John Slater, who thought he might be suitable casting in a 1964 Play of the Week presentation of Crime and Punishment. Thus he found himself playing the impoverished tragic hero, Raskolnikov, murderer of an old pawnbroker, in a three-and-a-half hour existential epic alongside Steven Berkoff, Peter Bowles, Julia Foster and Sylvia Coleridge.\n\nFive years later, in 1969, he was in another mighty Dostoevsky production, a BBC version in six episodes of The Possessed, as the charismatic rabble-rouser Pyotr Verkhovensky, alongside Rosalie Crutchley, Joan Hickson and Angela Pleasence. In the same year he was the Clerk in a BBC adaptation in seven long episodes of Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales, with Barbara Jefford as the Wife of Bath and Barry Linehan as the Miller.\n\nHe made a rare feature movie appearance as a lovable Bob Cratchit in the musical Scrooge (1970), with Albert Finney, in the same year as he was captured by aliens and imbued with superhuman powers in UFO. In Doctor Who he was an alien himself, in a rubber mask, with ideas of blowing up the Cybermen with a home-made rocket in 1975; a robot-phobic, Poul, in a 1977 narrative that found him crawling round the floor and sobbing; and in 1983, Peter Davison having succeeded Tom Baker in the title role, he was mistaken for the good doctor before mutating into a mutant with a wild spaghetti hairstyle.\n\nCollings as Bob Cratchit in the 1970 film Scrooge, with Frances Cuka as his wife. Photograph: Allstar/Waterbury\n\nPausing only to play Legolas in Lord of the Rings on BBC Radio 4 in 1981, and a guest appearance in the final wipe-out episode of Blake\u2019s 7, Collings joined the RSC for the first time as Newman Noggs in the 1985 revival of David Edgar\u2019s Nicholas Nickleby on tour and on Broadway. He also appeared in a star-studded chorus in the fine Don Taylor television script of Sophocles\u2019 Oedipus (1986), with Michael Pennington, Claire Bloom and John Gielgud.\n\nFor the RSC subsequently, between 1996 and 2001, he played Thomas Cranmer in Henry VIII, Baron de Charlus in Tennessee Williams\u2019s Camino Real, Count Lerma in Schiller\u2019s Don Carlos, Sir Politic Would-Be in Ben Jonson\u2019s Volpone, Cardinal Pandulph in King John and Sancho in Lope de Vega\u2019s Madness in Valencia. You could not devise a more varied roster of roles, but he discharged them all with a bitter charm and watchful, wary eye.\n\nIn this millennium, he played a neat double of Sir Henry Green and the Duke of Surrey in Kevin Spacey\u2019s Richard II (2005), directed by Trevor Nunn at the Old Vic, and graced a startling revival of Middleton and Rowley\u2019s Jacobean shocker The Changeling (2006) for Declan Donnellan\u2019s Cheek by Jowl company at the Barbican; the cast also included Will Keen, Olivia Williams and an unknown but tremendous Tom Hiddleston.\n\nA favourite \u201cjob\u201d was appearing with his son, Samuel, in Toby Frow\u2019s 1950s revival of Marlowe\u2019s Edward II at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, in 2011; he was old Mortimer and Matrevis while Sam doubled as the king\u2019s lover, Piers Gaveston, and his poker-wielding murderer, Lightborn.\n\nCollings was married firstly to Deirdre Bromfield, whom he met at the Lewes Little theatre, in 1962 (they divorced in 1975), and secondly to the actor Karen Archer in 1983, from whom he was separated, although they remained close friends. He is survived by Karen, by their children, Samuel and Eliza, his daughter, Kate, from his first marriage, and his sister, Nola. He was predeceased by Deirdre and two of their children, Matthew and Bethian."}, {"url": "https://www.bafta.org/heritage/in-memory-of/david-collings", "page_content": "BAFTA Guru\n\nBAFTA Guru is BAFTA\u2019s content hub for career starters packed full of inspirational videos, podcasts and interviews.

His soulful eyes could ignite vividly on his striking, yet sometimes doleful, countenance - under a lustrous mane of red hair - giving him an enigmatic, otherworldly quality that made him especially useful to science-fiction productions.\n\nAs Silver in the beguiling series Sapphire and Steel (1981-82) he was an eccentric, mercurial foil to David McCallum and Joanna Lumley. A popular contributor to Doctor Who \u2013 memorably guest-starring in three stories between 1975-83 \u2013 his powerful yet nuanced performances helped to ground the fantastical with requisite realism. Actor Mark Gatiss has described him as \u201cthe greatest Doctor Who we never had\u201d; Collings finally got to play his own incarnation of the Time Lord in an audio adventure for Big Finish (2003), capitalising on his vast experience in radio.\n\nIn BBC Radio 4\u2019s epic and strongly cast version of The Lord of the Rings (1981) he played Legolas, and latterly he was the perfect audiobook reader for the haunting stories of MR James.\n\nHis dusky yet melodic voice, perfectly modulated, also adopted an amusingly boorish bravado for the the title character in Monkey (1979-80),the dubbed English language version of the cult Japanese TV series.\n\nDavid Cressy Collings was born in Brighton, the son of a greengrocer. Upon leaving Varndean Grammar School he worked in retail before becoming an apprentice draughtsman at a design practice.\n\nHe joined the amateur company Lewes Little Theatre, partly to help with a speech impediment, and was spotted by actress Freda Dowie, who recommended him to the Liverpool Repertory Theatre. Whilst there the actor John Slater suggested him for a three-hour, live TV production of Crime and Punishment (1964) - and so, at 24 and with no formal training, he played his first leading television role.\n\nMore notable parts followed, in Ken Russell\u2019s Song of Summer (as an unforgettable Percy Grainger, 1968), Elizabeth R (1971, with Glenda Jackson), the BBC Shakespeare Julius Caesar (an intense Cassius, 1979), The Prince Regent (as William Pitt, 1979), A Tale of Two Cities (1980), Dark Towers (terrifying a generation of children as Lord Dark, 1981), and Press Gang (1989-93).\n\nHe also guest-starred in most popular series from Z-Cars (1965) to Holby City (2015) via UFO (1970), The Professionals (1978) and Blake\u2019s 7 (1981). On film he was an excellent Bob Cratchit to Albert Finney\u2019s eponymous miser in Scrooge (1970).\n\nHe was a gifted classical stage actor - his Mercutio at St George\u2019s Theatre, Tufnell Park (1976) was, according to Kenneth Branagh, who watched it as a schoolboy, \u201cthrilling\u201d and \u201cbrilliant\u201d.\n\nHe spent several seasons with the Royal Shakespeare Company, where his insightful character work benefited several good parts over the decades - a favourite engagement was touring with them from Stratford to Broadway in the 1985 revival of Nicholas Nickleby with his wife, Karen Archer, also in the cast, and their infant twins Samuel and Eliza (both destined to be actors themselves) in tow. He and Samuel also shared the stage in the Manchester Royal Exchange\u2019s 2011 production of Edward II.\n\nHe is survived by Karen, Samuel and Eliza, his sister Nola and step-daughter Juliet and daughter Kate from his earlier marriage, to Deirdre Bromfield.

On television he also ran a good line in eminent characters from history: Percy Grainger in Ken Russell\u2019s Song of Summer (1968), Sir Anthony Babington in Elizabeth R (1971), John Ruskin in The Love School (1975), William Wilberforce in The Fight Against Slavery (1975) and William Pitt in Prince Regent (1979).\n\nHe was born in Brighton, East Sussex, to George Collings, a greengrocer, and his wife, Lillian (nee Parsons). At Varndean grammar school he enjoyed acting but had no thoughts of setting out to be a professional actor and, on leaving, started work as a designer in lettering, inheriting that interest from his father, a keen artist. From 1960 he was happily involved in amateur dramatics for the Withdean Players and the Lewes Little theatre, but then was recommended by the actor Freda Dowie to the director David Scase, who had been appointed to run the Liverpool Rep.\n\nAfter six months in rep, Collings found himself pitched into television through another unsolicited recommendation, this time from the actor John Slater, who thought he might be suitable casting in a 1964 Play of the Week presentation of Crime and Punishment. Thus he found himself playing the impoverished tragic hero, Raskolnikov, murderer of an old pawnbroker, in a three-and-a-half hour existential epic alongside Steven Berkoff, Peter Bowles, Julia Foster and Sylvia Coleridge.\n\nFive years later, in 1969, he was in another mighty Dostoevsky production, a BBC version in six episodes of The Possessed, as the charismatic rabble-rouser Pyotr Verkhovensky, alongside Rosalie Crutchley, Joan Hickson and Angela Pleasence. In the same year he was the Clerk in a BBC adaptation in seven long episodes of Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales, with Barbara Jefford as the Wife of Bath and Barry Linehan as the Miller.\n\nHe made a rare feature movie appearance as a lovable Bob Cratchit in the musical Scrooge (1970), with Albert Finney, in the same year as he was captured by aliens and imbued with superhuman powers in UFO. In Doctor Who he was an alien himself, in a rubber mask, with ideas of blowing up the Cybermen with a home-made rocket in 1975; a robot-phobic, Poul, in a 1977 narrative that found him crawling round the floor and sobbing; and in 1983, Peter Davison having succeeded Tom Baker in the title role, he was mistaken for the good doctor before mutating into a mutant with a wild spaghetti hairstyle.\n\nCollings as Bob Cratchit in the 1970 film Scrooge, with Frances Cuka as his wife.

He also appeared in a star-studded chorus in the fine Don Taylor television script of Sophocles\u2019 Oedipus (1986), with Michael Pennington, Claire Bloom and John Gielgud.\n\nFor the RSC subsequently, between 1996 and 2001, he played Thomas Cranmer in Henry VIII, Baron de Charlus in Tennessee Williams\u2019s Camino Real, Count Lerma in Schiller\u2019s Don Carlos, Sir Politic Would-Be in Ben Jonson\u2019s Volpone, Cardinal Pandulph in King John and Sancho in Lope de Vega\u2019s Madness in Valencia. You could not devise a more varied roster of roles, but he discharged them all with a bitter charm and watchful, wary eye.\n\nIn this millennium, he played a neat double of Sir Henry Green and the Duke of Surrey in Kevin Spacey\u2019s Richard II (2005), directed by Trevor Nunn at the Old Vic, and graced a startling revival of Middleton and Rowley\u2019s Jacobean shocker The Changeling (2006) for Declan Donnellan\u2019s Cheek by Jowl company at the Barbican; the cast also included Will Keen, Olivia Williams and an unknown but tremendous Tom Hiddleston.\n\nA favourite \u201cjob\u201d was appearing with his son, Samuel, in Toby Frow\u2019s 1950s revival of Marlowe\u2019s Edward II at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, in 2011; he was old Mortimer and Matrevis while Sam doubled as the king\u2019s lover, Piers Gaveston, and his poker-wielding murderer, Lightborn.\n\nCollings was married firstly to Deirdre Bromfield, whom he met at the Lewes Little theatre, in 1962 (they divorced in 1975), and secondly to the actor Karen Archer in 1983, from whom he was separated, although they remained close friends. He is survived by Karen, by their children, Samuel and Eliza, his daughter, Kate, from his first marriage, and his sister, Nola.

In Revenge of the Cybermen, he was hidden behind a mask but still made an impression as Vorus, full of pride and aggression as he sought to defend his people.\n\n1977\u2019s The Robots of Death was perhaps his most memorable Doctor Who appearance, as Poul, an undercover agent who succumbed to a paralysing fear of the robots which were steadily eliminating the crew of the Sandminer.\n\nLater, in 1983\u2019s Mawdryn Undead, he took the title role of the character who begged the Doctor to give up his future lives so that his people may die, and was himself mistaken for the Doctor by Nyssa and Tegan.\n\nIndeed, Collings was one of those actors whose names often came up when fans pondered suitable actors to be cast as the Doctor. He would briefly take on the part in Big Finish\u2019s Full Fathom Five in their Doctor Who: Unbound range. Further Big Finish appearances followed, including a return to the part of Poul for The Robots, a spin-off from The Robots of Death.\n\nThere was, of course, far more to Collings\u2019 acting career than Doctor Who. He was no stranger to distinguished roles in the theatre including in RSC productions of Henry VIII, Don Carlos, Volpone, and King John.\n\nHe was something of a specialist in playing characters from history including Sir Anthony Babington in Elizabeth R, John Ruskin in The Love School, William Wilberforce in The Fight Against Slavery, and William Pitt in Prince Regent.\n\nA regular on television screens, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s, Collings had a number of sci-fi and fantasy drama credits. Appearing alongside Joanna Lumley and David McCallum he played Gold, colleague of the enigmatic Sapphire and Steel. He played Deva in the memorably bloody final episode of Blakes 7 in 1981. And viewers of a certain age will remember his vocal talents as the dubbed voice of the title character in the Chinese folk-tale adaptation, Monkey.\n\nNon-genre TV work included Dr. Finlay\u2019s Casebook, By the Sword Divided, and Miss Marple. On radio, Collings was heard as Legolas in the enduringly popular BBC dramatisation of The Lord of the Rings.\n\nA regular guest at conventions and signings, David Collings was held in high regard by many in the Doctor Who community.

The three-times Doctor Who guest artist took time out from recording to talk to Alan Stevens about cities of gold, robot wars and playing undead...\n\n\"You know, I didn\u2019t really set out to become a professional actor at all,\" says David Collings. \"I was invited. Sounds silly, doesn\u2019t it? But it\u2019s true. While appearing in amateur productions during the early 1960s, I was seen by a fine actress called Freda Downing, and she rather kindly recommended me to a director called David Skace. He had recently taken over the Liverpool Repertory Theatre, and he rang me and asked if I would like to turn professional and join his company. I told him to bugger off and put the phone down on him, but fortunately he rang back, and that's really how it all started.\"\n\nDavid pauses for a moment. \"You know, I don\u2019t normally give interviews, because I\u2019m usually asked about things I don\u2019t remember!\"\n\nOne thing David does recall, however, is his first work for television. \"I had been playing at the Liverpool Rep. for about six months when this wonderful actor called John Slater recommended me to Associated Rediffusion Television, who were about to do a three and a half hour version of Crime and Punishment. I went to see them and was offered the part of Raskolnikov. That got me into television, where I was then trapped for many years. Well, I say trapped, but it was actually a delightful place to be. So there you are. I didn\u2019t even go to Drama School, which I suppose is obvious to anyone who sees any of my performances.\"\n\nDavid's first science fiction appearance was in the Gerry Anderson live action series UFO.\n\n\"The episode was called 'Psychobombs', and I played this poor fellow who had been kidnapped by aliens and turned into a human explosive. I don't remember a lot about it, but I do recall that they had built this trick wire fence, and I was supposed to cut my way through it with a karate chop. Anyway, they got a bit upset with me because, although they weren't ready, I thought I heard someone say 'Action,' and chopped away, which then meant they had to build another fence.\"\n\nFor a tall, powerfully built man, who has spent the best part of forty years playing major roles on stage, screen and television, David Collings comes across as surprisingly modest and self-deprecating. In fact, he seems a million light years away from the ranting, power-mad character he played in the 1975 Doctor Who adventure \"Revenge of the Cybermen\". \"Yes, in that story I was a sort of scientist/politician, packed into a rubber mask, and thinking, \u2018Thank God they can\u2019t see what I look like!\u2019 We certainly had a lot of laughs while rehearsing for that one. I like to laugh. You can\u2019t take this business too seriously, can you? Now, if I recall, I played an alien [Vorus] from Voga, the Planet of Gold, who wanted to blow up the Cybermen with a rocket he had built called the Skystriker. Anyway, in the end he gets to fire his big rocket, but then dies in the process. Another character shoots him.\" David clutches his back with one hand, and, reaching out with the other, proclaims, \"My Skystriker! My glory!\" Dropping out of character, he continues, \"And then he falls down dead, and that was the end of that. Only it wasn\u2019t, because soon after, and I don\u2019t know why, they asked me back to do 'The Robots of Death'.\"\n\nCould the reason be that both stories were directed by Michael E. Briant?\n\n\"I\u2019d prefer to think that I got the job on merit,\" grins David, \"But, no, I think you\u2019re probably right. I did a lot of things for Michael Briant. Maybe he found me easy to get along with. I worked with him a great deal. He looked about twelve years old at the time, but he was very good, and that of course was the story with those very pretty, but rather murderous robots in.\"\n\nDavid was cast as Chief Mover Poul and was called upon to wear a quite elaborate costume. \"Very butch, wasn\u2019t it?\" David remarks. Did he have any idea what the costume would have looked like before taking on the part? \"Oh, yes, certainly, you get to see drawings of your costumes when you start. The designer brings his or her sketches along, so you get to know roughly what you\u2019re in for. I remember the costume I wore was quite flimsy, but to be fair I thought it matched the story rather well. It had to fit with the style of that particular show and was designed to go with the d\u00e9cor of the set. It was quite a decadent society they were showing, and I think it was put over very well through the general look.\"\n\nHowever, for David, seeing the costume designs wasn\u2019t the most important factor in developing the character of Poul. \"It was of some help, I suppose, but really I\u2019m the sort of actor who likes to work from the inside out with a character. I mainly work from what I find in the script and then plan from that what I intend to do with the part, and the direction in which I want to take it. Sometimes you might get inspired and change certain things in your performance on the day, but you can only rely on inspiration up to a certain point. It\u2019s got to come from the script, not the costume you\u2019re wearing.\"\n\nDuring the story it is revealed that Poul suffers from Robophobia, a morbid dread of robots. As a consequence, David had a number of scenes where he had to crawl around the floor, sobbing. \"I didn\u2019t find that difficult at all,\" smiles David, \"It comes quite naturally to me.\"\n\nAlthough David\u2019s first Doctor Who had been with Tom Baker, it was only on \"The Robots of Death\" that they really got to know each other. \"With the first story, I didn\u2019t have many scenes with Tom, but with the second, that was different, and so we spent a great deal of time together rehearsing up at North Acton. We also spent a lot of time, as I recall, in the pub.\"\n\nBetween this story and his final brush with Doctor Who, David was to play another memorable role, in the supernatural detective series Sapphire & Steel. \"The head of casting sent me a script and asked if I was interested. To be honest, although I read through the script a number of times, I couldn\u2019t make head nor tail of it. All very complex and mysterious. I didn\u2019t understand a word, but it seemed like a great deal of fun to do and it was a nice part to play, so that\u2019s why I agreed to do it.\"\n\nThis was the first time that David was to meet either of the show\u2019s stars. \"I\u2019d never worked with Joanna Lumley or David McCallum before. I got on with Joanna particularly well, and we\u2019ve remained firm friends ever since. The character I played, Silver, was what they called a Specialist. He was a kind of technician who was able to conjure things out of thin air. In fact I invented all of that. All those sort of magic tricks he used to do. Do you remember that glowing doorknob in my first story? That was one of mine. In the last story I had this business with a fruit machine. I had this special device that allowed me to hit the jackpot all the time. \u2018I\u2019m not enjoying this game at all,\u2019 says Silver, and Sapphire replies, \u2018That\u2019s because most times you\u2019re supposed to lose.\u2019 Lovely stuff. I also remember that on that story, which was my second one, we were underrunning, and so they told me to improvise a scene with Joanna, but they didn\u2019t tell her that this was what we were doing. She thought I\u2019d gone mad I think, but she kept up with the improvising anyway. Very game girl, Joanna.\"\n\nDavid recalls that there were a lot of alterations made to the scripts during recording. \"There was endless rewriting. David McCallum would always insist on rewriting everything, which of course upset the writers. I also think it wasted a lot of time, and it didn\u2019t make any more sense after he had rewritten them then they did before.\"\n\nAt one point, there were even plans for David\u2019s character to become a permanent fixture of the series, making it, perhaps, Sapphire, Silver & Steel? \"I think Silver would have come third, Sapphire, Steel & Silver. The television company were very keen on the idea and they wanted to do another series, but then Joanna and David decided that they\u2019d had enough of it by then, and didn\u2019t want to do any more. The story where they were whirled off into space, that became the last one. I think it was more David McCallum then Joanna really who wanted it over. I was very keen for it to go on because there was a very good relationship developing between Sapphire and my character, which of course might have been part of the problem with David.\"\n\nHaving appeared in the last episode of Sapphire & Steel, David was soon approached to appear in the last episode of Blake\u2019s 7. \"I was sent this script where I had a lot of scenes with Blake, and I thought, \u2018This looks promising,\u2019 and then I got to the last page and guess what? Blake and everyone else, including myself, is shot dead! I always try and do a good death,\" quips David. \"For that one I dived into the wall, and almost brought the set down. Oh, yes, you can always rely on me to finish off any series that I\u2019m in.\"\n\nDavid\u2019s final appearance in Doctor Who was as the title role in the 1983 adventure, \"Mawdryn Undead\". \"Well, I had hysterics doing that. I mean we were in hysterics all through rehearsals, including the director. I remember him saying, \u2018Look, we\u2019ve all got to take it seriously when the producer comes along to watch,\u2019 but then if it\u2019s not fun to do it\u2019s not worth doing.\"\n\nDuring recording, David had to undergo two extensive make-ups jobs. \"For the first one I had to look as if I had been burnt very badly. In fact so badly, I could be confused with Peter Davison! Sheelagh Wells did the make-up and she was very good. It took several hours to do, but that was all right as you can always read the paper and chat. The problem is when you go to lunch afterward which can be a little embarrassing, walking around pretending to be a burnt Peter Davison. For the second make-up I had to stop being Peter Davison and turn into a mutant instead, with all this spaghetti falling out of my head. Again, as Mawdryn wasn\u2019t in very good health, I had to do a lot of crawling around on the floor. It\u2019s a recurring theme of my career, that!\"\n\nDavid has recently returned to science fiction through his involvement with the thriller audio CD series Kaldor City. \"I have Louise Jameson to thank for that. The BBC had written to me asking if I\u2019d like to attend a Doctor Who convention in Manchester as part of the promotional launch for 'The Robots of Death' DVD. I was going to say no, but then Louise said to me, \u2018Come on, I\u2019m doing it, so why don\u2019t you come and do it too.\u2019 So I did, and actually it was quite enjoyable. I had a really nice time, and it was there that I was first approached to come back as Poul, my character from 'The Robots of Death', in Kaldor City. It\u2019s always nice to have somebody ask you back to play the same role, it means they must like you.\"\n\nHow does David think the character of Poul has developed since he last played him?\n\n\"I\u2019m very pleased with what\u2019s been done with the character and I think it\u2019s a very clever twist on what has gone before. No more sobbing and hiding under tables. Poul\u2019s much happier now-- as he\u2019s gone completely mad.\"\n\nFinally, I wondered if David was aware that he was always a hot tip in Doctor Who fan circles to become the next Doctor. \"Well, I\u2019ve never heard that before. Is that why the BBC stopped making it-- because they were afraid I might become the next Doctor Who?\"\n\nI hastily deny that this was the reason.\n\n\"David Collings, the next Doctor Who.

His soulful eyes could ignite vividly on his striking, yet sometimes doleful, countenance - under a lustrous mane of red hair - giving him an enigmatic, otherworldly quality that made him especially useful to science-fiction productions.\n\nAs Silver in the beguiling series Sapphire and Steel (1981-82) he was an eccentric, mercurial foil to David McCallum and Joanna Lumley. A popular contributor to Doctor Who \u2013 memorably guest-starring in three stories between 1975-83 \u2013 his powerful yet nuanced performances helped to ground the fantastical with requisite realism. Actor Mark Gatiss has described him as \u201cthe greatest Doctor Who we never had\u201d; Collings finally got to play his own incarnation of the Time Lord in an audio adventure for Big Finish (2003), capitalising on his vast experience in radio.\n\nIn BBC Radio 4\u2019s epic and strongly cast version of The Lord of the Rings (1981) he played Legolas, and latterly he was the perfect audiobook reader for the haunting stories of MR James.\n\nHis dusky yet melodic voice, perfectly modulated, also adopted an amusingly boorish bravado for the the title character in Monkey (1979-80),the dubbed English language version of the cult Japanese TV series.\n\nDavid Cressy Collings was born in Brighton, the son of a greengrocer. Upon leaving Varndean Grammar School he worked in retail before becoming an apprentice draughtsman at a design practice.\n\nHe joined the amateur company Lewes Little Theatre, partly to help with a speech impediment, and was spotted by actress Freda Dowie, who recommended him to the Liverpool Repertory Theatre. Whilst there the actor John Slater suggested him for a three-hour, live TV production of Crime and Punishment (1964) - and so, at 24 and with no formal training, he played his first leading television role.\n\nMore notable parts followed, in Ken Russell\u2019s Song of Summer (as an unforgettable Percy Grainger, 1968), Elizabeth R (1971, with Glenda Jackson), the BBC Shakespeare Julius Caesar (an intense Cassius, 1979), The Prince Regent (as William Pitt, 1979), A Tale of Two Cities (1980), Dark Towers (terrifying a generation of children as Lord Dark, 1981), and Press Gang (1989-93).\n\nHe also guest-starred in most popular series from Z-Cars (1965) to Holby City (2015) via UFO (1970), The Professionals (1978) and Blake\u2019s 7 (1981). On film he was an excellent Bob Cratchit to Albert Finney\u2019s eponymous miser in Scrooge (1970).\n\nHe was a gifted classical stage actor - his Mercutio at St George\u2019s Theatre, Tufnell Park (1976) was, according to Kenneth Branagh, who watched it as a schoolboy, \u201cthrilling\u201d and \u201cbrilliant\u201d.\n\nHe spent several seasons with the Royal Shakespeare Company, where his insightful character work benefited several good parts over the decades - a favourite engagement was touring with them from Stratford to Broadway in the 1985 revival of Nicholas Nickleby with his wife, Karen Archer, also in the cast, and their infant twins Samuel and Eliza (both destined to be actors themselves) in tow. He and Samuel also shared the stage in the Manchester Royal Exchange\u2019s 2011 production of Edward II.\n\nHe is survived by Karen, Samuel and Eliza, his sister Nola and step-daughter Juliet and daughter Kate from his earlier marriage, to Deirdre Bromfield. Their other two children, Matthew (12) and Bethian (aged just a few months), predeceased him."}, {"url": "https://www.wikizero.com/en/David_Collings", "page_content": "From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia\n\nEnglish actor (1940\u20132020)\n\nDavid Collings (4 June 1940 \u2013 23 March 2020)[1] was an English actor.
