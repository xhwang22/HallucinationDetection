Mackenzie who was born in Naperville, Illinois started her gymnastics career at Aerial Gymnastics Club. When Mackenzie, who also has a younger sister who was an Elite Gymnast, once told her mom during the 1996 Olympic Games that she one day would be an Elite with dreams of the Olympics, Mackenzie worked towards those goals everyday after that moment.\n\nWhile at Aerial Mackenzie was the 2007 JO National AA Champion, in 2007 Mackenzie would also compete in her first Elite competition the U.S. Classic held in Battle Creek, Michigan. Mackenzie then competed in the junior division at the 2007 Visa Championships finishing 16th in the AA. In 2008 the Olympic Year Mackenzie would become a Senior International Elite, which would now give her the opportunity to chase her Olympic Dream.\n\nIn the Olympic Year, Mackenzie competed at the U.S Classic finishing 1st on the Vault, 3rd on the Bars and 4th AA. This solid meet qualified her to the Visa Championships placing 10th in the AA securing her a spot on her first US National Team and a place at the U.S Olympic Team Trials. However, Mackenzie only competed in day 1 of the trials placing 12th in the AA on that specific day.\n\nIn 2009, Mackenzie began training along with her sister Bridgette at Naperville Gymnastics under two Chinese Olympians (Jiani Wu & Yuejiu Li). Mackenzie had a breakout year in 2009 having successful competitions at the U.S Classic and the U.S Nationals placing 3rd on the Uneven Bars and 5th in the AA then 2nd\n\non the Vault, Uneven Bars, 8th on the Floor and 3rd in the AA respectively despite suffering a pretty serious knee injury in June of 2009. After a successful showing at the US Championships Mackenzie was named to the World Championship Selection camp. She would be named as an alternate to the 2009 World Team. Mackenzie was them selected to represent Team USA at a few international competitions. The Toyota International Competition in Japan (2nd on bars), the USA-Germany Friendly Exchange (1st team, 2nd uneven bars, 3rd AA & vault ), the USA-France Exchange (1st team, 2nd AA & Vault) and then the USA-Japan Friendship Meet (1st team, vault & 2nd AA).\n\nIn 2010 Mackenzie found herself at a new gym, her coaches Jiani Wu & Yuejiu Li opened their own training facility in Naperville called Legacy Elite. Mackenzie started off her season representing Team USA at the City of Jesolo Trophy meet in Italy, where she placed 1st with the Team & 7th AA. Macko also competed at the CoverGirl Classic placing 2nd on Vault, Bars and 3rd in the AA, thus qualifying herself to the 2010 Visa Championships. At Championships she was 4th on Bars, 7th on Beam and 5th AA. Her placing at Championships would qualify her again to the USA National Team and onto the World Championship Selection Camp. Having been an alternate last year to the World Championships, in 2010 Mackenzie would selected at a Worlds Team member, at the final selection camp she won the AA. Mackenzie traveled to Rotterdam, Netherlands as part of Team USA. In Rotterdam, Mackenzie competed in the AA placing 9th in the qualifications, unfortunately she did not advance to the finals because of the two per country ruling. However, she did compete in the team finals on Bars and Vault contributing scores for both to the team. The USA Team ended up finishing 2nd behind the Russians.\n\nAfter the World Championships Mackenzie, who had previously committed to the University of Florida on a full ride scholarship started her season with the Gators. In her freshman season Mackenzie faced some injuries, but still competed in the AA for her team at the NCAA Championships, however once the NCAA season was over Mackenzie decided to wanted to make an elite comeback, so she returned to Legacy Elite at competed two events at the 2011 CoverGirl Classic finishing 4th on the Uneven Bars. At the 2011 Visa Championships she\u2019s competed in the AA finishing 4th, she also placed 2nd on the Uneven Bars. Mackenzie earned herself a spot on her 4th US National Team and a spot at the Worlds Selection Camp. Unfortunately, while doing a dismount off the beam she injured both her ankles and had to withdraw from the selection process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMackenzie returned to the University of Florida for her sophomore season, however she would only compete the Uneven Bars and eventually the balance beam. In 2012 the Gators placed 2nd as a Team at the NCAA Championships and Caquatto placed 6th on the Uneven Bars. In 2013, Mackenzie helped the Gators win their first NCAA National Championship in the schools history, she also placed 4th on the Uneven Bars and Balance Beam. In her final year as a Florida Gator Mackenzie once again helped lead her to their second NCAA Championship Team Title and placed 4th on the Uneven Bars.\n\nMackenzie had fought through injuries and adversity to find great success in her gymnastics career as an Elite & a Collegiate Student-Athlete. As a Florida Gator Mackenzie received many honors, as a Freshman she received SEC Freshman of the week honors, multiple event titles. As a sophomore she earned All-America first-team honors at the NCAA Championships for the Uneven Bars, All SEC Second Team member and she was a member of the SEC Academic Honor Roll. In 2011 as a Junior Caquatto, earned All-America first-team honors at the NCAA Championships for the Uneven Bars and Balance Beam, first-team All-American for the Uneven Bars and Balance Beam in the first National Association of Collegiate Gymnastics Coaches (NACGC) All-America regular-season awards, she was also the fifth Gator Gymnast to score a perfect 10 on the Uneven Bars and first since 2009, she was named the SEC Specialist of the Week, she also shared team\u2019s Heart & Soul award and was again a member of the SEC Academic Honor Roll and named to NACGC Scholastic All-America team.\n\nIn her final season she earned again first-team All-American honors for the Uneven Bars and Balance Beam at the NCAA Championships and the NACGC All-America regular-season awards.

She was also a member of the SEC Academic Honor Roll for the 4th year in a row.\n\nMackenzie graduated in 2014 with a bachelors degree in elementary education, she has wanted to become a teacher since she was very young. After graduation she would go onto her graduate degree from the University of Florida, in 2015 she graduated with her Masters in Elementary and Special education. Currently she is in the second year of of Florida\u2019s three-year ProTeach program. Mackenzie can be seen in the stands at Gator Gymnastics Meets cheering on her former team, but most importantly her younger sister who is also a Florida Gymnast.\n\nLike many Region 5 Athletes before her Mackenzie chased her Olympic Dream, she however was plagued by injuries, but she did work hard, persevere and did something super hard and special, competing in both NCAA & Elite at the same time, not many have achieved this feat. Mackenzie found success at the University of Florida, and on the world stage. Thank you Mackenzie for inspiring not only the Elite & Olympic Hopefuls of Region 5, but all gymnasts in general. I hope through your teaching that you continue to inspire and education young people for generations to come.\n\nHere are Mackenzie\u2019s routines from the 2008 Olympic Trials and 2010 World Championships:\n\n2010 Worlds Beam, 2010 Worlds Floor, 2010 Worlds Bars,\n\n2008 Olympic Trials Vault\n\n***Pictures provided by Google Search, Info & Bio provided by USA Gymnastics, Wikipedia, Gator Gymnastics and Videos from Youtube Gymcat67 & Gymnweb Account***"}, {"url": "https://olympics.com/en/athletes/mackenzie-caquatto", "page_content": "Year of Birth\n\nYear of Birth 1992\n\nUnited States of America\n\nTeam United States of America"}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/mackenzie-caquatto/", "page_content": "Mackenzie Caquatto (born March 26, 1992) is an American artistic gymnast.

She was named as the first alternate for the team. In addition to her status as an alternate, she was sent to the Toyota International in Toyota City, Japan. At this competition, she competed on the uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise; winning the silver medal on the uneven bars with a score of 14.675, only behind world silver medalist on the event, Koko Tsurumi of Japan.\n\nCaquatto started her 2010 season by competing at the City of Jesolo Trophy, where she had the highest beam score but made mistakes on the floor which kept her from medaling in the all-around. Caquatto competed at the 2010 CoverGirl Classic and placed 3rd in the all-around, scoring the second highest on vault and the uneven bars but falling from the balance beam. She had qualified to compete at the 2010 US National Championships. At the 2010 US National Championships, Mackenzie placed 5th in the all-around. She fell on a simple change grip skill on the uneven bars, her best event, placing 4th.\n\nAfter the US Nationals, Mackenzie was selected to attend a selection camp for the 2010 World Championships. From there, she advanced to the second camp where she won the all-around competition. She was eventually selected to compete.\n\nAt the World Championships, Mackenzie competed in the all-around in the qualifying round. After hitting all her routines without major error, she placed 9th individually and 3rd with the team. Although the top 24 qualifiers advance to the individual all-around final, she was left out because fellow American athletes Aly Raisman and Rebecca Bross had qualified ahead of her and only two athletes from each country can qualify to a final.\n\nAfter the qualifying round, Mackenzie was selected to compete on the uneven bars and the vault during the team finals. She contributed a 14.666 on the bars and a 15.000 on the vault to help the team win the silver medal behind Russia and ahead of China.\n\nShe competed as a Florida gator at the NCAA level for the 2010\u20132011 season where she became injured but still competed the all-around for her team at the NCAA Championships. After finishing the NCAA season, Mackenzie decided to train for a comeback to elite gymnastics for the 2011 season.\n\nMackenzie began her 2011 elite season by competing at the CoverGirl Classic. At the classic, she competed a slightly watered down balance beam routine and a solid uneven bars routine; scoring 14.100 and 14.750, respectively.\n\nAt the 2011 US Visa National Championships, Mackenzie surprised many by competing in the all-around. On day 1 of the competition, Mackenzie was in second place after the two rotations; after scoring a 14.700 and 15.000 on vault and uneven bars, respectively. Unfortunately, she counted her first fall on the balance beam. After having a solid floor exercise, she finished her night in sixth place with an all-around score of 56.000. On the final day of competition, Mackenzie competed solidly on all her events. Taking advantage of injuries to defending national champion Rebecca Bross and Chellsie Memmel, Mackenzie went on to finish the championships in fourth place behind Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, and champion Jordyn Wieber. She also took second place on the uneven bars just behind Wieber by 0.050.\n\nMackenzie was given a spot on her fourth national team and has been invited to compete at the first world team selection camp. She was considered to be a likely pick for the world team, but injured her ankles when dismounting the beam at the selection camp and therefore lost her chance of going to Tokyo. After sitting out the beginning of the NCAA season, she competed on the uneven bars in early 2012 and is expected to reintroduce her beam routine soon.\n\nCompetition skills\n\nMackenzie performed the following skills on bars, beam, floor, and vault as of 2010.\n\nApparatus Skills D Score Top Score in World Championship/World Cup/Olympic Competition Vault Double-Twisting Yurchenko 5.8 15.000 Uneven Bars Jump to high bar mount, Kip cast to reverse grip handstand, Jaeger (D), Kip cast to handstand, toe on piked Tkatchev (E) to Pak Salto (D), Kip cast to handstand, Maloney (D) to Bail (D) to toe-on full pirouette (D) to toe-on shoot to high bar, Kip cast to handstand, Tkatchev (D), Kip cast to handstand, giant, full twisting double tuck dismount (D) 6.2 14.666 Balance Beam Leap on to beam mount, side sommie (D), front aerial (D) to flip flop (B) to layout step-out (C), full turn with leg at horizontal (C), split jump to sissone, switch split leap 1/2 (D) to back tuck (C)*, front pike take off from one foot (C), switch split leap (C) to back tuck (or pike) (C), roundoff to double pike dismount (E) 5.7 (5.8*) 14.266 Floor Exercise Roundoff back handspring to full-in double pike (E) (triple twisting back layout (E)*), roundoff back handspring to a triple twisting back layout (E) (roundoff to 1 1\u2044 2 back layout (C) to full twisting front layout (C)*), double turn with leg at horizontal (D), tour jete 1/2 (C), switch split ring leap (C) to switch split leap 1/2 (C), roundoff to 1 1\u2044 2 twisting back layout (C) to full twisting front layout (C) (front handspring to double twisting front layout (D)*), roundoff back handspring double pike dismount (D) 5.6 (5.5*) 13.533 (With slightly watered down exercise)\n\n*Variation competed for 2011.\n\nCompetitive history\n\nSenior career history\n\nYear Competition Description Location Apparatus Rank-Final Score-Final Rank-Qualifying Score-Qualifying 2011 CoverGirl Classic Chicago, IL Uneven Bars 4 14.750 Balance Beam 12 14.100 U.S. Championships Saint Paul, MN All-Around 4 112.500 6 56.000 Uneven bars 2 29.750 2 15.000 Balance Beam 12T 26.700 18 12.650 Floor Exercise 10 27.200 6T 13.650\n\nYear Competition Description Location Apparatus Rank-Final Score-Final Rank-Qualifying Score-Qualifying 2010 CoverGirl Classic Chicago, IL All Around 3 56.450 Vault 2 14.850 Uneven Bars 2 15.050 Balance Beam 20 12.950 Floor Exercise 8 13.600 U.S. Championships Hartford, CT All-Around 5T 113.350 5T 56.800 Uneven bars 2 28.900 4 15.000 Balance Beam 7T 27.550 9 13.500 Floor Exercise 8 27.700 10T 13.700 World Gymnastics Championships Rotterdam, The Netherlands Team All-Around 2 175.196 3 233.643 All-Around 9 57.198 Vault 15.000 (team finals) 6 14.933 (no average) Uneven Bars 14.666 (team finals) 12 14.466 Balance Beam 21 14.266 Floor Exercise 39 13.533\n\nYear Competition Description Location Apparatus Rank-Final Score-Final Rank-Qualifying Score-Qualifying 2009 CoverGirl Classic Des Moines, IA Uneven Bars 9 13.350 U.S. Championships Dallas, TX All-Around 5 111.950 5 56.000 Uneven bars 3 29.000 4 14.450 Balance Beam 17 26.000 15 13.000 Floor Exercise 10 27.350 9 13.850 Toyota International Toyota City, Japan Uneven bars 2 14.675 Balance Beam 12 12.275 Floor Exercise 11 12.100"}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/mackenzie-caquatto", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nMackenzie Caquatto was born on 26 March, 1992 in United States, is an American gymnast.

Caquatto made her collegiate debut with the Gators last season, earning 10 event titles. But she was still active in the sport's elite level, earning her fourth consecutive spot on the U.S. Senior National Team last August with her fourth-place all-around finish in the Visa Championships.\n\nCaquatto traveled to the USA Gymnastics National Team Training Center to compete for a spot on the 2011 World Championships and Pan American Games teams. A strong showing at those meets could ultimately mean a chance to compete for a spot Caquatto's dream team \u2013 the 2012 U.S. Olympic gymnastics team.\n\n\u201cTraining was all about polish, consistency, being tight and hitting every single time you got up. We were working on our fine details so we could be at our peak when we got to Japan (for the World Championships),\u201d she said. \u201cI was having a really good training camp. I felt really prepared and I was ready to go and compete. Everything was going well and I couldn't have asked for anything else.\u201d\n\nCaquatto was on the balance beam on the team's first day of the second and final camp when she got the injury that has kept her sidelined since September.\n\n\u201cI had done one of the best beam routines in my life,\u201d she said. \u201cOn my dismount, my hand slipped off my leg.\u201d\n\nThe gymnast landed short on her double pike dismount, spraining and tearing ligaments in both her ankles in the process.\n\n\u201cI was so upset because I had worked the whole summer. It was something that I really wanted. I had really pushed myself and told myself that I wouldn't look back in regret. I just wanted to say that I did everything that I could, which I did,\u201d Caquatto said.\n\nShe went home for three weeks, where she took her UF classes on-line while in two boots and a wheelchair. When she came back to school, she found nothing but support that has continued on through the beginning of this season.\n\n\u201cThe whole team was very supportive. They have been encouraging me, trying to help me get better,\u201d Caquatto said. \u201cIt's really nice to know that I have those people behind me and they're wanting me to come back and do the best that I can.\u201d\n\nThough Caquatto loved cheering her teammates on during the first two meets, she was anxious to get back to competing.\n\n\u201cWhen I'm on the sidelines, I feel like I should be out there contributing. I don't feel like I'm doing my job when I'm standing there injured,\u201d she said. \u201cCompeting is the best thing about the sport for me.\u201d\n\nShe made her return to the Gators' competitive lineup last Friday at Kentucky, performing an uneven bars routine.\n\nTo get to the point where she could compete again, Caquatto attacked her rehabilitation regimen with same vigor as she does with training. Her rehab, which included meetings with her athletic trainer three times a day, physical therapy twice a week and a weekly chiropractor visit, has also taught Caquatto patience and helped to build her confidence.\n\n\u201cI hadn't done gymnastics in three months, and I was still able to do it. That's comforting to me. I was really worried when I first got injured that the skills wouldn't be there and it would be really difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I came back, all my skills were still there. It was really nice to just jump back in there.\u201d\n\nDespite her progress, Caquatto has to remind herself to take time with her rehab so she can be properly healed by the season's end.\n\n\u201cI want to be out there competing with the team every single weekend. It is so exciting. It's what we live for, it's what we do, and it's why we're here. But as much as I would like to get out there and compete on more events now, I'd rather be healthier and not hurting as much by the end of the season,\u201d Caquatto said. \u201cMy mentality is just to get back as quickly as I can and be as healthy as I can, and be able to contribute to the team score in the long run.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/sports/american-captures-gymnastics-all-around.html", "page_content": "GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) \u2014 The American gymnast Bridgette Caquatto wobbled on the balance beam but did not fall on the dismount.\n\nThat, and an excellent uneven bars routine, added up to a gold medal for Caquatto in the all-around competition at the Pan American Games on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe beam routine went pretty smoothly for me,\u201d said Caquatto, 17, who became the seventh straight American to win the event at the Pan Am Games. \u201cI just had one major wobble.\u201d\n\nCaquatto, from Naperville, Ill., scored 14.725 points on the uneven bars, the only competitor to break 14. That put her in the lead heading into her final event, the balance beam.

Her younger sister, Bridgette Caquatto, is also a former elite gymnast.\n\n2007\u20139\n\nCaquatto first qualified as an elite gymnast in 2007 and competed at the National Championships that year, finishing 17th.\n\nHer first senior competition was the 2008 National Championships, where she placed 10th in the all-around. She was named to the national team and qualified to the Olympic Trials, but competed only on the first day, finishing 12th.\n\nIn 2009, she competed at her first international meets as a member of the national team and placed 5th at the National Championships, despite a knee injury. At the Toyota International in Japan, she competed on the uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise and won the silver medal on bars with a score of 14.675, behind world silver medalist Koko Tsurumi of Japan. She was also the first alternate to the U.S. team for the 2009 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.\n\n2010\n\nCaquatto started her 2010 season at the City of Jesolo Trophy in Italy, where she had the highest beam score but missed a medal in the all-around because of mistakes on floor exercise. At the 2010 U.S. Classic, she placed 3rd in the all-around, with the second-highest scores on vault and uneven bars but a fall on balance beam. She qualified to the National Championships, where she placed 5th in the all-around after falling on a simple grip change on the uneven bars, her best event.\n\nBased on her performance at Nationals, Caquatto advanced to the team selection camp for the 2010 World Championships. She went on to win the all-around at a second selection camp and was named to the team.\n\nAt the World Championships, she placed 9th in the all-around in qualifications but did not advance to the individual all-around final because only two athletes per country can qualify, and her teammates Aly Raisman and Rebecca Bross scored higher. In the team final, she scored 14.666 on bars and 15.000 on vault to help the U.S. win the silver medal, behind Russia but ahead of China.\n\n2011\n\nAfter competing for the University of Florida for the 2010\u201311 season, Caquatto decided to train for a comeback to elite gymnastics. At the 2011 U.S. Classic, she competed on bars, scoring 14.750, and performed a somewhat watered-down routine on balance beam, scoring 14.100.\n\nAt the National Championships, she competed in the all-around and finished the first day of competition in sixth place with a score of 56.000, counting a fall on beam. However, with solid performances on the second day of competition and injuries to Chellsie Memmel and defending national champion Bross, she placed fourth behind Jordyn Wieber, Raisman, and McKayla Maroney. She also took second place on the uneven bars, just 0.050 behind Wieber.\n\nCaquatto earned a spot on her fourth national team and was invited to the first world team selection camp, but she injured her ankles on a beam dismount at the camp. After sitting out the beginning of the NCAA season, she began competing on the uneven bars again in early 2012.\n\nSkills\n\nCaquatto performed the following skills in 2010:\n\n*Variation competed for 2011."}, {"url": "https://www.flogymnastics.com/articles/5067401-catching-up-with-former-florida-gator-mackenzie-caquatto", "page_content": "FloGymnastics: What have you been up to since graduating in 2014?\n\nTell us about how teaching is going and what you enjoy the most.\n\n\n\nWhen you look back at your career at Florida, what moments stand out to you the most?\n\nWhat are you most proud of as a Florida Gator?\n\nWhat do you miss most about gymnastics and being a Florida Gator?\n\nWhat was it like competing with your sister, Bridgette?\n\nWhat was it like watching Bridgette compete after you had graduated?\n\nWhat personal accomplishment are you most proud of?\n\n\n\nYou competed under former UF coach Rhonda Faehn -- what is the biggest thing you learned from her?\n\n\n\nWhat is next for you personally?

As a former elite who joined the Gators with a long list of accomplishments, she was part of two national and two SEC team titles in her time at Florida. Caquatto scored a perfect 10 on bars in her time at Florida and saw action consistently on all four events.FloGymnastics recently caught up with Caquatto to talk about her life after gymnastics:Caquatto: I graduated in 2014 with my bachelor's in elementary education. I then graduated in 2015 with my master's in elementary and special education. I got hired after graduation to teach fourth-grade math and science in Gainesville.I LOVE teaching and working with kids every day. I like to create my own atmosphere in the classroom and make it like a family. I like to do lots of hands-on activities and make their learning relatable. Each day is a new challenge, but I love that I can make an impact on their lives every day.Definitely winning two national championships and two SEC titles as a team! College was the best time of my life. I had amazing coaches who always wanted to best for you in all parts of your life. I made friends for life and loved being with my teammates who understood what I was going through and always had my back.Representing the University of Florida and being able to wear the \"F\" on my chest. I am still proud to wear my Florida gear and be a part of the Gator community.I miss the camaraderie with my teammates and having someone to support me all the time. I also miss competing and the feeling of adrenaline with my teammates.I was so happy when my sister came to Florida. We trained our whole lives together, so when I came to Florida first, it felt like part of me was missing. She knows me better than anyone and was able to be there for me and push me and encourage me.I think the year after I graduated I was living vicariously through her. It was really hard to be up in the stands. I wanted to be down on the floor cheering her on. It was great to see her win another national championship and have her time to shine. I was also so nervous watching her.Being a part of a national championship team. As a junior, I was a member of the first-ever gymnastics team to win a national championship at Florida, so that was pretty special.Rhonda was a very calm and encouraging coach, which was very contagious. Every time we went to compete she told us we could do and you could feel that she believed in you and knew you could do it. That has stuck with me as I am now a teacher and I encourage my students and believe in them. Rhonda also knew our limits and knew how to get us where we needed to be. She cared about each of us as a person and was more than a coach to us.I plan to stay dedicated to teaching, as that is another passion of mine. I want to find a way to stay connected to the sport of gymnastics. I may want to try college coaching or judging to stay involved with the sport I love. I am currently coaching summer camps, and I love doing that.My time at Florida really was the best experience ever as I was surrounded by awesome girls and coaches. College gymnastics was the cherry on top for me.
