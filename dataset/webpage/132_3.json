Carpenter and his daughter Frances to illustrate his popular writings on travel and geography.\n\nBackground and Scope\n\nFrank Carpenter | Frances Carpenter | Scope of the Collection\n\nFrank Carpenter\n\nBorn in Mansfield, Ohio, Frank G. Carpenter (1855-1924) became a journalist, photographer, world traveler, and the author of books on geography. His wanderlust resulted in articles and books that informed American readers about life in other countries and enabled him to accumulate an impressive rangeof visual documentation.\n\nCarpenter began his writing career as a journalist and his assignments fueled his compilation of images from around the world. After graduating from the University of Wooster (Ohio) in 1877, Carpenter began newspaper work as the Columbus, Ohio, correspondent for the Cleveland Leader newspaper. He got a taste of life abroad as a foreign correspondent for that paper in 1881. In 1882 his work for the Cleveland Leader took him to Washington, D.C., where he was the paper\u2019s Washington correspondent until 1888, writing a regular column on life in \"Carp\u2019s Washington.\" He also did work for the American Press Association starting in 1885 and the New York World in 1887. Carpenter collected enough assignments with newspaper syndicates and Cosmopolitan Magazine to pay for a trip around the world in 1888-1889. He was charged with sending a \"letter\" each week to twelve periodicals, describing life in the countries to which he traveled. He continued to travel extensively, logging 25,000 miles in South America in 1898, and later doing letter-writing tours of Central America, South America, and Europe.\n\nA Fellow of the Royal Geographic Society, the National Press Club, and numerous scientific societies, Carpenter published widely on travel and authored the Carpenter\u2019s Geographic Readers, standard texts used in American schools for forty years. His writings helped popularize culturalanthropology and geography.\n\nCarpenter's globetrotting did not preclude his having a family and sinking roots in the Washington, D.C., area. He married Joanna Condict in 1883, and they had two children. His real estate holdings inWashington, D.C., made him a millionaire.\n\nFrank Carpenter died in Nanking, China, in 1924 at age 69, on his third trip around the world.\n\nFrances Carpenter\n\nFrances Carpenter (1890-1972) began accompanying her father Frank on his travels as both secretary and photographer upon her graduation from Smith College in 1912. She co-authored a number of books with him including The Clothes We Wear (1926) and The Foods We Eat (1926). She later edited the articles her father had written in the 1880s about life in Washington, D.C., resulting in the publication, Carp\u2019sWashington (1960).\n\nInheriting her father's interest in cultures outside the U.S., Frances Carpenter became an author and geographer in her own right. She wrote of foreign legends and peoples for a youthful audience in books such as Our Neighbors Near and Far (1933) and Tales of A Russian Grandmother (1933). Not only do the books reflect the knowledge Frances gained through her travels, but a few also include illustrations she chose from the Carpenter collection. Frances Carpenter was a Fellow of the Royal Geographic Society and Vice President of the International Societyof Women Geographers.\n\nShe married W. Chapin Huntington, the commercial attach\u00e9 at the American Embassy in Paris. As Mrs. W. Chapin Huntington she presented the Carpenter collection to the Library of Congress in 1951 and continued to donatematerial until her death in 1972.\n\nScope of the Collection\n\nThe Carpenter collection consists of an estimated 5,400 photographic prints in albums and 10,400 photographic prints not in albums (an occasional non-photographic image is found among this material), as well as 7,000 glass and film negatives. The degree of overlap among images in these different formats has not been calculated. The images were taken between 1880 and 1934, with the majority dating from 1910 to 1925. Frank and Frances Carpenter took many of the photographs themselves, but they also collected images from commercialsources.\n\nThe images reflect the Carpenters'travels in:\n\nEurope (including unusually full coverage of the Basque country)\n\nthe Near and Far East\n\nAfrica\n\nNorth, Central, and South America and some areas of the Caribbean.\n\nThe images highlight many aspects of human geography, focusing on the daily lives of various peoples, with particular respect to:\n\nPhotographs taken in the United States emphasize natural resources, food and agriculture, industries, health, and welfare. There are some portraits of Native Americans, including the Siksika (Blackfoot) andPlateau Region Indians.\n\nA large portion of the images of Alaska before it became a state appear as digital images both here in the Prints & Photographs Online Catalog and as a \"Meeting of Frontiers\" presentation elsewhere on the Library of Congress web site [view Meeting of Frontiers presentation].\n\nThe Near Eastern and North African collections are rich in large gold-toned 19th-century albumen prints collected from various commercial firms such as Sebah, Cassa (Malta), Lehnert & Landrock (Tunis), C. Vincent, Bonfils, Dittrich, Garrigues, Lekegian, Arnoux, Albert (Tunis), and Abdullah Freres(Istanbul).\n\nPrepared by: Marilyn Ibach, Reference Specialist. Last revised: June 2006.\n\nArrangement and Access\n\nThe Frank and Frances Carpenter collection consists of approximately:\n\n5,400 photographic prints in 29 albums\n\n10,400 photographic prints not in albums\n\n5,000 nitrate film negatives\n\n2,000 glass plate negatives\n\nThe degree of overlap between the prints in the albums to those not in the albums has not been analyzed. The albums contain many contact prints from negatives in the collection, but some album images have no corresponding original negative. The prints not in albums also include some images printed from original negatives.\n\nPhotographic Prints in Albums\n\nFrank and Frances Carpenter compiled the albums, generally grouping images along regional lines. The Prints and Photographs Division staff assigned LOT (group) numbers to the albums and prepared a group-level description for each LOT. In the Prints & Photographs Online Catalog, each LOT description includes a link to check for any individual images cataloged online, many of which are accompanied by digital images.\n\nWithin the albums, English captions accompany most images, but dates are not consistently indicated. The Carpenters may have taken many of the images, especially those made 1910-1924, but the albums also include images that they collected, and the origin of such images is not always noted.\n\nRetrieve catalog records for albums\n\nPhotographic Prints Not in Albums\n\nPrints and Photographs Division staff organized the loose prints into groups (LOTS) on the basis of their subject matter (generally by country or region represented). In the Prints & Photographs Online Catalog, each LOT description includes a link to check for any individual images cataloged online, many of which are accompanied by digital images.\n\nRetrieve catalog records for groups not in albums\n\nNegatives\n\nMost of the images appearing online are ones for which copy photos have been produced, generally because P&P staff have not found a corresponding original negative in the collection that can be used to produce copies. Images with copy photos generally have reproduction numbers beginning, LC-USZ...\n\nPreservation considerations prevent public users from directly handling the negatives, which are kept in cold storage. The original negatives have generally been matched to corresponding prints, primarily in the albums.\n\nFormat and size information for the original negatives can be helpful in planning photoduplication requests (see the Photoduplication Service's price list) and serves as an indication of the type of equipment used to make an image. If a photographic print in the collection bears a reproduction number beginning with one of the series codes below, there is an original negative in the format indicated in the righthand column."}, {"url": "https://allthatsinteresting.com/frank-carpenter-photos", "page_content": "Stunning vintage portraits of the world's diverse cultures \u2014 from Brazilian headhunters to Indian snake charmers \u2014 from over a century ago.\n\nLike this gallery?\n\nShare it: Flipboard\n\nEmail And if you liked this post, be sure to check out these popular posts: When Farmers Ruled Hollywood: 24 Astounding Turn-Of-The-Century Photos Inside Turn-Of-The-Century New York's Immigrant Slums 25 Stunning Photos Of Shuri Castle, Okinawa's 14th-Century World Heritage Site 1 of 43 Man peddling vegetables, Japan, 1890-1923.

So when Carpenter published his visual dispatches from the far corners of the Earth, he offered more than just photos.\n\nIndeed, Carpenter introduced millions to the many fabrics of human life. Over the course of his life, Frank Carpenter would travel the world three times, amassing tens of thousands of photos of the cultures and geographies he encountered throughout.\n\nBorn in Mansfield, Ohio in 1855, Carpenter commenced his career as a journalist, a profession that paved the way for his travels. By 1888, he had enough assignments with newspaper syndicates and magazines to pay for his first trip around the world. His sole responsibility? Send a letter each week to these periodicals, wherein he described what he saw.\n\nOn some of these travels, Carpenter brought his daughter, Frances. She followed in her father's footsteps and became an author and geographer, and the father-daughter duo \u2014 when not globetrotting \u2014 would write books together, such as The Clothes We Wear and The Foods We Eat, which detailed cultural variance in otherwise humdrum affairs.\n\nFrank Carpenter's work \u2014 specifically Carpenter's Geographic Readers \u2014 would become the gold standard in the United States for geography textbooks for decades as well as popularize the disciplines of cultural anthropology.\n\nFittingly enough, it was on his third lap around the world that Carpenter died at age 69. The world-revealing geographer would draw his last breath in Nanking, China.\n\nAbove, you'll find a handful of photos that Carpenter took during his travels, which spanned from 1880 to 1934.\n\nNext, look back on American diversity with these portraits of Ellis Island immigrants.

After a brief association with the surrealist movement in Paris, he developed his own concept of \u201clo real maravilloso\u201d (the marvelous real), a forerunner to the magical realist genre popular in Latin American fiction. Carpentier lived outside his homeland for many years, and his expatriate experience supplied the stimulus for his novels, which portray the encounter of European culture with the mysterious primitivism of the untouched New World.\n\nWorks in Biographical and Historical Context\n\nTwo Childhoods and the Struggle for Reconciliation Alejo Carpentier y Valmont inherited from his family background a Latin American cosmopolitanism. Born in Lausanne, Switzerland, on December 26, 1904,\n\nhe was taken to Havana as an infant, and later claimed he was born in Cuba. His father was a French architect; his mother was of Russian descent and had studied medicine in Switzerland. His parents were new arrivals in the Spanish-American republic but not poor immigrants. Carpentier would later recall roaming in his father's spacious library. Throughout his life, he struggled to reconcile the two worlds of his childhood: the sheltered European one of his home and the livelier world of Cuban blacks in the street.\n\nThe Afro-Cuban Avant-Garde Carpentier's first language was French, and he spoke Spanish with a French accent. He attended private schools, and received advanced musical training at a prestigious Parisian lycee as a teenager. He began studies in architecture at the University of Havana in 1920. His education ended abruptly, however, when his father deserted the family in 1922. Forced to leave the university, he supported himself as a journalist. He wrote music and theater reviews for Havana newspapers and at the age of nineteen became editor of the avant-garde weekly Carteles. Later, he helped to found another influential periodical, Revista de Avance.\n\nBy 1927 Carpentier had begun to distinguish himself as a promoter of the nascent Afro-Cuban movement, which introduced African elements into the arts. He\n\nwrote librettos and collaborated in the creation of ballets, comic operas, and experimental theater pieces. Carpentier and his companions viewed black culture as a source of creative and political energy, a rejection of European values. For them, Afro-Cuban art spread the spirit of rebellion and helped uplift the faith of black people in their own culture.\n\nThe political situation in Cuba was becoming more chaotic. Rebellion was growing against the dictatorship of Gerardo Machado y Morales, who had come to power in 1925. During a roundup of dissidents in 1927, Carpentier was arrested and held for forty days. While in prison, he began writing Ecue-yamba-o!, an Afro-Cuban novel that would later become his first published book. Upon his release, he knew he was blacklisted and under suspicion. A French poet, Robert Desnos, allowed the Cuban to use his papers to escape to France.\n\nThe Paris Years Carpentier spent eleven years in Paris. Through his connection with Desnos, he became associated with the surrealists. He also met many Spanish and Latin American writers in Paris and Madrid. Carpentier continued to write for Carteles and other Cuban publications; his reviews kept the Cuban public informed about the artistic revolution developing in Europe. He even published a column on women's fashion under the pseudonym Jacqueline.\n\nCarpentier began to work in radio broadcasting as a writer, publicist, and sound-effects specialist. Radio and advertising would be his occupation for the next three decades. He wrote experimental radio plays and collaborated on musical programs with avant-garde composers. While he was in Paris, he published his first novel, Ecueyamba-o! (1933). The book fared poorly with critics, and he did not attempt to publish fiction again for more than a decade.\n\nCarpentier immersed himself in studying the history and culture of the Americas. He was fascinated with African religious and social practices, and the way these were transplanted to the Europeanized Cuban culture. Years later, Carpentier would attempt to reconcile the Spanish America that he discovered in books in Paris with another experienced firsthand; the gap between them would furnish the material for his greatest fiction.\n\nThe Lost Steps By 1939, the situation in Europe was growing tense, and Carpentier returned to Cuba. In 1945, he left Havana for Caracas, Venezuela, to work in advertising and radio. In Venezuela, he entered his most productive period. His first important publication, which he had started to research before leaving Cuba, was Music in Cuba (1946), a work of scholarship. In his attempt to trace the origins of Cuban music and the essence of Cuban culture, Carpentier reaches back to the first ballads sung by Spanish mariners of the sixteenth century and to the ritual music of Native Americans as well as Africans.\n\nSome of the important features of Cuban music were contributed by the first Haitian exiles. Researching this early stage in Cuban history brought his attention to Haiti and its revolution. A trip there in 1943 brought him face to face with the \u201cmarvelous real\u201d in the landscape, myths, and history of the Americas and inspired him to write his historical novel, The Kingdom of This World (1949). This story of Haiti, told largely from a slave's point of view, sets the values of the European Enlightenment up against the intensity of Caribbean culture, with its supernatural and magical aspects.\n\nOrigin of a Reflective Stance During vacations from his busy life in the metropolis of Caracas, Carpentier took trips to the jungles along the Orinoco River. Experiencing both a Latin America of the future and one of the remote past furnished him with the reflective stance found in The Lost Steps (1953), considered by many to be his greatest novel. The novel's narrator, a musician, travels into the Amazonian rainforest in search of indigenous musical instruments and explores the possibility of evading time and casting off civilization. This allegorical story casts doubt on whether modern man, with his diminished urban existence, can recover his authentic nature in any guise.\n\nLITERARY AND HISTORICAL CONTEMPORARIES\n\nCarpentier\u2019s famous contemporaries include:\n\nHistory and Revolution In Caracas, Carpentier succeeded in becoming one of the best-known Latin American writers, but it was not easy. He was forced to help finance the publication of his books. A second edition of The Lost Steps in 1959 was widely circulated in the Spanish-speaking world. That year, Cuba underwent a communist revolution, and Fidel Castro became the nation's political leader. Carrying the manuscript for his next novel in his luggage, Carpentier returned to his home country. He accepted the position of director of the state-run Cuban Publishing House in Havana.\n\nCarpentier completed the manuscript of Explosion in a Cathedral and published it in 1962. The book was a best seller and incited much political debate. It is a historical novel centering on the effects of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution on Latin America. It offers a model of Latin American fiction based on the history of the New World, expanding on the themes and problems posed in The Kingdom of This World and The Lost Steps.\n\nAfter Explosion in a Cathedral there was a twelve-year hiatus in Carpentier's fiction writing. However, in 1964 he published a book of essays, Probes and Differences, that had an enormous impact on Latin American literature. The book republished his prologue to The Kingdom of This World, his fullest statement of the theory of the \u201cmarvelous real.\u201d Invoking the magical presence he found in Latin America's indigenous interior, Carpentier argued for a mode of narration that could incorporate miraculous elements without seeming artificial. His theory, appearing in the wake of the Cuban Revolution and the Latin American boom, created rifts among critics of the Spanish-American novel. Probes and Differences also contained Carpentier's ideas on the baroque style, an important quality in Latin American literature and in his own novels.\n\nLater Career as a Controversial Figure Carpentier's connection with the revolutionary Cuban government transformed him into a controversial figure in Latin American cultural politics. While artists and intellectuals became disillusioned with the repressiveness of the Castro regime and its dependence on the Soviet Union, Carpentier remained faithful to the revolutionary government, turned his back on friends who did not, and refrained from criticism about government policies. The Cuban government rewarded Carpentier with a privileged position. He spent from 1968 until the end of his life in France as a cultural ambassador. He was allowed to receive royalties and publish outside the island, as other Cuban writers were not.\n\nCarpentier's next work was his only satirical novel. Reasons of State (1974) concerns a dictator attempting to rule the fictitious Nueva Cordoba from his home in Paris, periodically returning to his country to control revolutionary outbreaks. A tragicomic figure of artificiality, he ends up with no control over anything. His final novel, The Harp and the Shadow (1979), is based on the life of Christopher Columbus. Readers find out that it was by seducing Queen Isabella that Columbus secured her help, thereby rendering the entire American enterprise part of an illicit love affair. Carpentier wrote the novel after being diagnosed with cancer; he died in Paris on April 24, 1980.\n\nWorks in Literary Context\n\nAlejo Carpentier grew up in an affluent family and received a fine education. In his father's library, he satisfied his curiosities as a young reader with classic French authors such as Honor\u00e9 de Balzac and Gustave Flaubert, as well as Pio Baroja, the modern Spanish novelist. While he spoke French at home, his association with Cubans of African, Indian, and Spanish origin influenced him as he sought to combine the European and American worlds of his childhood.\n\nThe \u201cMarvelous Real\u201d Carpentier's studies in Latin American history exerted a profound influence on his writing. So did his firsthand experiences in the ruins of Haiti and the jungles of the Orinoco, from which arose his concept of the \u201cmarvelous real.\u201d In his novels, the continent's ancient past is forcefully alive, and the natural environment is sentient and magical. Critic Roberto Gonzales-Echeverria, in his book Alejo Carpentier: The Pilgrim at Home, writes: \u201cCarpentier searches for the marvelous buried beneath the surface of Latin American consciousness, where African drums still beat and Indian amulets rule; in depths where Europe is only a vague memory of a future still to come.\u201d Incongruity and paradox, according to Carpentier, are at the heart of Latin American life and the \u201cmarvelous real.\u201d\n\nCOMMON HUMAN EXPERIENCE\n\nAlejo Carpentier probed the tangled history of the New World in his novels, illuminating the connection between the past and present as few historical texts do. Here are some additional works in the relatively new genre of Latin American historical fiction:\n\nThe War of the End of the World (1981), a novel by Mario Vargas Llosa. A novel based on the true story of a religious fanatic and his followers, who provoke a civil war in Brazil in the 1890s. The General in His Labyrinth (1989), a story by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez. A fictional account of the \u201cGreat Liberator\u201d of South America, Simon Bolivar, in his final days. All Souls' Rising (2004), a novel by Madison Smartt Bell. The first installment of an epic trilogy about the slave uprising in Haiti that turned a colonial outpost into the world's first black republic. In\u00e9s of My Soul (2006), a novel by Isabel Allende. The story of the origins of Chile told through the life of In\u00e9s Suarez, a sixteenth-century conquistadora (female conquistador). Malinche (2007), a novel by Laura Esquivel. A historical novel based on the love affair between conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and his Native American interpreter.\n\nFueling the Boom Carpentier's literary theory\u2014and works such as The Kingdom of This World, which put his ideas into practice\u2014influenced the writers who created\n\nthe Latin American literary boom of the 1960s. Two notables clearly influenced by Carpentier are Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez of Colombia and Carlos Fuentes of Mexico. It is reported that upon reading Explosion in a Cathedral, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez abandoned a draft of his most famous novel, One Hundred Years of Solitude, and started over from scratch. More broadly, Carpentier is acknowledged among the originators of magical realism.\n\nWorks in Critical Context\n\nAlthough considered a major literary force in Latin America, Alejo Carpentier did not achieve widespread recognition with the American reading public. Critics have asserted that the erudite quality of his prose\u2014discoursing on such disparate subjects as anthropology, geography, zoology, history, philosophy, musicology, and cuisine\u2014may repel many readers. On the other hand, his work has rated better among French readers and critics. Both The Kingdom of This World and The Lost Steps won literary prizes in France. Taken as a whole, his writing is considered without parallel in twentieth-century literature for having defined the special role of Latin America in global culture and its mythologies.\n\nThe Lost Steps When Carpentier's The Lost Steps was published in English in 1956, it commanded little attention from American readers, despite the success of the novel in other languages. The lack of American success was even more disappointing, since the main character of the novel is a Manhattan musician who journeys to the heart of the jungle in search of undiscovered musical instruments played by the indigenous people there. The reception from American critics was positive, though it did not translate into sales. An unnamed reviewer from Time calls it \u201cone of the finest fictional forays toward an answer\u201d of whether humans are happier in modern civilization or in a more primitive state of nature. The reviewer also notes that the author \u201cis equipped with an elegance of perception and distinction of style,\u201d and that despite the lack of a clear-cut message, he proves to be \u201ca more rewarding guide than many a more decisive pundit.\u201d\n\nResponses to Literature\n\nCarpentier spent many years studying music when he was young. How are these studies reflected in his published works? In what ways does the character of Columbus in The Harp and the Shadow represent Carpentier himself? Compare the \u201cmarvelous real\u201d in Carpentier's fiction to magical realist authors such as Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and Isabel Allende. After the Cuban revolution, Carpentier became controversial for his acceptance of the Castro regime. What political issues and stances stand out in his novels?\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nBooks\n\nGonzalez-Echevarria, Roberto. Alejo Carpentier: The Pilgrim at Home.

Born in England in 1906; daughter of a cinema entrepreneur; married Charles Scruby (a developer); married Russell F. Akers, Jr. (an American colonel), in 1946; children: (first marriage) one son, one daughter.\n\nRetired from journalism (early 1930s) to raise a family; start of World War II motivated her to return to the profession to cover the Battle of Britain; facing strong discrimination by British military authorities and determined to be a combat reporter, was hired by the Boston Globe and was accredited with the 1st American Army; her reports from the front lines and hospitals in France and Germany described in graphic prose some of the bloodiest fighting on the Western front, including the Battle of the Bulge as well as the liberation of Nazi concentration camps; remained in the U.S., working for Voice of America.\n\nIris Carpenter was one of the most intrepid and respected women war correspondents of World War II. With her powerful stories appearing in the Boston Globe, many of her loyal readers were unaware that Carpenter was not an American, but a British-born journalist. Born into a wealthy family (her father was a cinema magnate), she used her father's connections to land a job in 1924 as a film critic for a British publication called The Picture Show. Her talent pushed her up the professional ladder, and she signed on with London's Daily Express. Following her marriage to Charles Scruby, a wealthy developer, Carpenter quit journalism in 1933 to devote her energy to raising a young son and daughter.\n\nThe start of World War II in September 1939 ended Iris Carpenter's life of secure domesticity. From the outset, the conflict came uncomfortably close to her private life when five German planes were shot down in the woods behind her home. Determined not to sit out the war, she reported on the conflict in several roles, including as a broadcaster for the BBC as well as a print reporter for both the Daily Express and the Daily Herald. Ignoring the dangers around her, Carpenter turned in colorful and perceptive articles documenting the heroism and destruction of the Battle of Britain. By 1942, the United States had joined the war effort, and it was clear that one day Hitler's Fortress Europe would be invaded by an Allied armada. A tested veteran war correspondent, Carpenter believed that she had earned a right to be part of the first wave of troops liberating the Nazi-occupied European Continent.\n\nHer application to be accredited with the British Expeditionary Force for its coming invasion of Europe was vetoed. Carpenter's book, No Woman's World, notes the hostile attitudes of the British high command toward female reporters at the front: \"The only chance a newspaper girl had in talking to troops was by touring camps with the Red Cross doughnut girls.\" Refusing to be excluded from one of the greatest stories of the war, she decided to find a job with an American newspaper and report on American participation in the upcoming invasion. Her meeting with Carlyle Holt of the Boston Globe was a persuasive one, and she was hired as that newspaper's accredited correspondent with the U.S. 1st Army. On D-Day plus four, Iris Carpenter became one of the first women to land on the Allies' precarious Normandy airstrip. Though she and a handful of other women had now appeared on the scene, the British War Office continued to place obstacles in their way, reflecting the openly hostile attitudes of Field Marshall Bernard Montgomery, whose position was a flat: \"We will not tolerate them.\"\n\nTaking advantage of the American military's greater receptivity to female reporters, Carpenter followed the troops beyond the immediate area of France's rapidly expanding Normandy beachhead. On her first return to London to file some stories, she discovered that she had broken a rule by advancing with the troops and was subject to a court-martial and subsequent disaccreditation if found guilty. Fortunately she had saved her typed orders (in triplicate), satisfying her accusers that she had not consciously broken the rules, which were now recast to redefine the beachhead as being four miles inland from Omaha Beach to the city of Cherbourg. Despite Carpenter's escape from punishment, institutional hostility toward women journalists remained strong. The Public Relations Division (PRD) of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces (SHAEF) had full jurisdiction over female reporters, dictating that they could only write about subjects the PRD approved, which included such topics as the Women's Army Corps (WACS), wounded soldiers and hospital life. Women reporters, regarded as little more than a nuisance, were severely restricted in their access to the front lines, being ordered to go no farther than the areas designated for nurses and Red Cross staff. Whereas male correspondents were usually assigned to camps that had jeeps and drivers as well as teletype and radio transmitters, women reporters enjoyed few of these professional advantages. The hospitals to which they were assigned, often situated in areas more exposed to enemy shelling, rarely had jeeps, making it difficult for reporters to get their stories to the local press camp.\n\nAs the Germans retreated, Carpenter followed the Allied forces through the shattered French city of Caen and across the River Orne, reporting not only the exploits of American troops but the involvement of the local population against their Nazi oppressors. She was perceptive in her observations of both the evil and altruistic traits that the end of foreign occupation brought out in the French\u2014some displayed malevolence, others heroism. In her constant search for good stories, she ignored the dangers of the war. Only in her memoirs could she look back on the dangers of her exhilarating, perilous job, noting that \"No combat soldier, however experienced or well trained, did a better job of inching out in retreat with the fanny well down than this correspondent.\" Despite the courage and competence of female war correspondents like Carpenter during the first weeks of the invasion, SHAEF continued its policy of discrimination and none of them were present for the exhilarating first hours of the liberation of Paris. Arriving in Paris after having been \"quarantined\" along with other women reporters by a PR officer, Carpenter more than made up for her frustration by reporting on the final stages of mopping-up operations by French resistance forces of holdout German troops, which she called \"head-hunting.\"\n\nSoon after leaving liberated Paris, Carpenter suffered a shattered eardrum during a bombing raid on St. L\u00f4, which became infected. A painful and dangerous case of mastoiditis was suspected, but she refused to submit to an operation, fearing that by the time she had fully recovered the war would be over. She ameliorated her condition by remaining with a field hospital as it moved toward the front; in this manner, she maintained medical treatment and stayed close enough to the action to continue reporting.\n\nCarpenter's stories of wounded soldiers and of the skillful, compassionate medical and nursing staff were among the best published during the final phase of the war in Europe. The horror of war was never far from her reportage: \"Time was taken out to bury the men, but carcasses of cattle were everywhere. I don't know why the sight of a flock of sheep bowled stiffly on their sides, or a cow with the soft, flabby folds of her neck stretched taut to the sky, or a horse with his four legs jutting from a bloated belly, should seem more sadly to heighten the horridness of war than anything it does to men. I know only that it did. Maybe it's because animals are so unresponsible for it all.\"\n\nIn her reporting on the carnage of the battle of the H\u00fcrtgen Forest, Carpenter again pointed up the animal life sacrificed to the war. Wounded American soldiers sought shelter in a barn while the war raged around them: \"Every time another crash shook the trembling structure, the surviving animals burrowed into the hay among the wounded, squealed and whinnied and bleated. A youngster with a dangling bloody mess of coat-sleeve where his left arm should have been had the other one firmly around a frightened pig. 'Silly, isn't it?' he cracked. 'Me, with pork my favorite meat!'\" Once in Germany, Carpenter began to write not only of American and Allied soldiers but of the German civilian population as well, who, she said, \"were Germans, but that made them no less pitiable\" as they wandered the roads with a handful of salvaged possessions. Determined to see as much as she could, Carpenter moved from place to place by cub plane in what were often dangerous forays, not only because of enemy fire but hostile weather; on one trip, she spent three hours in a wild storm, finally finding a safe airfield with only a few minutes of fuel left in the tank.\n\nThe war ended for Iris Carpenter with scenes both horrific and exhilarating. She reported on the concentration camps at Buchenwald, Dachau and Nordhausen, telling of monstrous deeds her readers could not always easily accept as part of the human experience in the 20th century. More optimistic were her reports from Torgau on the Elbe river, where American and Soviet troops met and celebrated a hardwon victory, hopefully foreshadowing a new era of peace and cooperation. The war ended for Carpenter in Weimar, the city of both Goethe and Schiller as well as Buchenwald. After composing her last dispatches, she came to the United States in early June 1945 and consciously began the transition to a world at peace. Wrote Carpenter after seeing the New York skyline: \"I was afraid that the sensation of combat would deprive me of the quality of being excited about anything else \u2026 but I am excited.\"\n\nThe Allied victory in Europe brought other changes to Carpenter's life. She divorced her husband and married an American officer, Colonel Russell F. (\"Red\") Akers, Jr. Her son came to the United States while her daughter remained in school in England. Iris and \"Red\" settled down in the Washington, D.C., area, he remaining in the military and she finding a job with the Voice of America. Her war memoirs, No Woman's World, were published in 1946, receiving positive reviews. Carpenter remained in the United States, living out a long retirement in her beloved state of Virginia.\n\nsources:\n\nBeasley, Maurine H. \"Women and Journalism in World War II: Discrimination and Progress,\" in American Journalism.

On closer examination, however, Carpenter\u2019s philosophy of daily life was one where self-sufficiency was grounded in a privileging of sensory and somatic experience that placed as much value on conviviality, creative self-expression and sexual liberation as on producing one\u2019s own food, recycling and minimising unnecessary labour. As such, Carpenter offered a radical re-framing of sufficiency as an enriched mode of living and described how the \u2018simplification of life\u2019 opened up a world in which affective bonds between humans, animals, objects and the environment were given a new intensity and pleasure.\n\nEdward Carpenter, prophet of socialist self-sufficiency\u2014whose farm at Millthorpe in the 1880s and 1890s became a beacon to like-minded Victorian radicals seeking to repudiate the trappings of bourgeois morality, capitalism and/or consumerism \u2014may seem at first sight to have advocated a lifestyle based on frugality . Having renounced the security of a fellowship at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in 1874 and distanced himself from the comforts of his middle-class upbringing in Brighton, Carpenter joined the nascent University Extension scheme as a lecturer in the north of England, an itinerant life that he found draining but rewarding. After his father\u2019s death, the purchase of seven acres at Millthorpe near Sheffield in 1882 allowed Carpenter a more settled life, although one now occupied by the physically demanding work associated with a productive market garden, in addition to his writing and socialist campaigning. From these bare biographical details, one might easily assume that Carpenter\u2019s evaluation of what was \u2018just enough\u2019 would err on the side of asceticism, if not self-denial.\n\nOn closer examination, however, Carpenter\u2019s philosophy of daily life was one where self-sufficiency was grounded in a privileging of sensory and somatic experience that placed as much value on conviviality, creativity and sexual expression as producing one\u2019s own food , recycling and minimising unnecessary labour. Today, Carpenter is best known as an early campaigner for homosexual equality whose writings challenged his contemporaries to embrace and explore their sexuality.Footnote 1 In an era when the Oscar Wilde trial made any public acknowledgement of homosexuality a considerable risk, Carpenter was a courageous trailblazer whose openness about the pleasures of same-sex relationships\u2014both in his life and his writings\u2014deserves still greater recognition. While this chapter is chiefly concerned with Carpenter\u2019s articulation of self-sufficiency, his celebration of sexuality was consistent with the privileging of bodily and sensory pleasures that his poetry, essays and lectures advocated as central to all aspects of life. In Carpenter\u2019s somewhat idiosyncratic version of socialism, a new social order would \u2018only be possible when we rethink our relationship with our bodies\u2019 (Hatt, p. 399). Even Carpenter\u2019s best-known eccentricity\u2014his advocacy of the wearing of handmade sandals\u2014was motivated not by any kind of bodily mortification but a desire to liberate \u2018the most menial and despised members and organs of the body\u2019 (\u2018Simplification\u2019, p. 94). Freed from \u2018their leathern coffins\u2019, Carpenter argued, feet could regain \u2018the pleasure of grasping the ground\u2019 (p. 94). Employing a metaphor of death and resurrection to condemn the constraints of middle-class mores, Carpenter described a more vital mode of living based on the immediacy of physical experience and bodily awareness.\n\nCarpenter\u2019s approach to the simple life was not one that merely reduced life to the basics, to how much labour was enough to survive or \u2018to furnish a man with ordinary necessaries\u2019 (qtd. in Rowbotham, p. 88). Reversing the terms of bourgeois commodity culture where, according to Carpenter, the proliferation of possessions led to unethical social relations and the impoverishment of daily life, he offered a radical re-framing of sufficiency as an enriched mode of existence. Carpenter described how the \u2018simplification of life\u2019 (in an essay of this name included in England\u2019s Ideal and Other Papers on Social Subjects in 1887b) opened up a world in which affective bonds between humans, animals, objects and the environment were given a new intensity. For Carpenter, affluence resulted in an insufficient awareness of sensory experience while the \u2018simplification of life\u2019 meant an enhancement, not a diminution, of pleasure and well-being . Communicating this philosophy of ethical self-sufficiency through his writings, moreover, was as essential as living it: Carpenter was involved in an ongoing dialogue with, rather than a retreat from, wider society, keen to show middle-class audiences what they were missing out on, what they could gain from self-sufficiency. Carpenter thus articulated a position that sounds somewhat akin to Voluntary Simplicity as it developed in the twentieth century in wealthy Western nations: a more frugal mode of daily life willingly adopted by those who could afford to live otherwise but who chose\u2014for ethical, religious, political or environmental reasons \u2014to reduce their consumption of goods and energy and become more self-sufficient while also enjoying a greater quality of life. Where Carpenter differed, of course, was in his advocacy of socialist principles such as the nationalisation of industry and the collectivisation of agriculture and his belief in the inevitability of revolution. Even so, Carpenter\u2019s socialism was broad in its scope; it was the \u2018oceanic character\u2019 of the socialist cause, he said, that most strongly appealed to him: The real value of the modern Socialist movement \u2013 it has always seemed to me \u2013 has not lain so much in its actual constructive programme as (1) in the fact that it has provided a text for a searching criticism of the old society and of the lives of the rich, and (2) the fact that it has enshrined a most glowing and vital enthusiasm towards the realization of a new society. (My Days, p. 126)\n\nCarpenter\u2019s emphasis on the need to re-imagine society by starting at the micro-level of daily life perhaps seems at odds with the goal of organised, mass revolution and it is true that Carpenter\u2019s writings place a value on individualism that is not always consistent with the views of other revolutionary thinkers of the socialist movement in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. William Morris \u2019s socialist writings and speeches in the same period, for instance, while vague on the details of revolution, accepted the reality of class struggle and the need for direct action grounded in an organised collective. Deeply moved by the death of Alfred Linnell, as a result of police violence in the events surrounding the Bloody Sunday protest by thousands of unemployed workers and a range of socialist organisations in Trafalgar Square in 1887, Morris (who attended Linnell\u2019s funeral) wrote \u2018A Death Song\u2019 which included a refrain that stressed the mass movement that revolution required: \u2018Not one, not one nor thousands must they slay / But one and all if they would dusk the day\u2019.\n\nConsidered alongside other prominent socialists of the time, Carpenter\u2019s views on what kind of resources were enough for everyday life, while distinctive in many ways, may also be seen as part of an ongoing debate about the relation between personal sufficiency in one\u2019s own domestic life and the advancement of radical social change. Like Carpenter, Morris\u2014whom Carpenter greatly admired and who visited Millthorpe in 1886\u2014drew a direct connection between a political commitment to socialism and the practices of everyday life but the style of interior design associated with Morris & Co. seems a world away from the simplicity of Millthorpe. The riot of pattern and colour of Morris designs, typically combined to excess in bourgeois Victorian drawing rooms, implied that too much was never enough. Privately, however, Morris envied the austerity of Carpenter\u2019s home, confiding to him at Millthorpe: \u2018I have spent, I know, a vast amount of time designing furniture and wall-papers, carpets and curtains; but after all I am inclined to think that sort of thing is mostly rubbish, and I would prefer for my part to live with the plainest whitewashed walls and wooden chairs and tables\u2019 (qtd. in My Days, p. 217). If Morris the socialist\u2019s concept of enough was sharply at odds with that of Morris the businessman, a similar problem with reconciling a socialist politics with everyday comforts was evident in the views of George Bernard Shaw , who was acquainted with Morris and Carpenter. Having expressed his dismay both with the austere lifestyle to which he was subjected at Morris\u2019s country retreat, Kelmscott Manor, and at the home of Carpenter disciples, Henry and Kate Salt (who \u2018[kept] a house at a hole called Tilford, down Farnham way, \u2026 subsisting on the fungi of the neighbourhood \u2019, according to Shaw in \u2018A Sunday on the Surrey Hills\u2019), Shaw\u2019s preference for the conveniences of urban modernity nonetheless co-existed with a no-nonsense adoption of vegetarianism and the simpler clothing of the Jaeger suit , marking an eschewal of excess in any form that carried over into his politics, as he moved from a more utopian position (associated with the idealistic Fellowship of the New Life) to Fabian socialism. As Ruth Livesey has argued, \u2018For the Salts, Shaw, and Carpenter, experimenting with vegetarianism was in part a means of identifying themselves with a well-established nineteenth-century radical tradition\u2019 and, as such, signalled a complex and potentially contradictory articulation of concepts of sufficiency and plenitude, abstinence and consumption, through links to figures as diverse as Shelley and Tolstoy (Socialism, Sex and the Culture of Aestheticism, p. 108). Evaluating what was enough\u2014where the line should be drawn regarding either personal consumption or revolutionary politics\u2014was, like now, no simple matter, even as they all agreed on the imbrication of the two and were, to varying degrees, publicly associated with a \u2018radical political identity through dress and diet\u2019 that represented a rejection of the excesses of capitalism (Livesey, Social, Sex and the Culture of Aestheticism, p. 106).\n\nAt the same time, however, Carpenter distinguished his approach to self-sufficiency from more romanticised forms of a \u2018retreat to nature\u2019 and, in his autobiography, outlined his struggle to reconcile the idealism of simplicity with the practicalities of life in which living in a state of nature could never be entirely possible for subjects who had always already been shaped by their social environment (whether of class, gender or sexuality). For example, while Carpenter acknowledged the powerful impact that reading Thoreau \u2019s Walden in 1883 had on him, he also recognised the rather rarefied ideal that Walden represented: Having just committed myself to all the exasperations of carrying on a house and market-garden and the petty but innumerable bothers of \u2018trade,\u2019 the charming ideal of a simplification of life below the level of all such things was opened out before me \u2013 and for the time I felt almost paralyzed. [Walden\u2019s] ideal of life spent with Nature on the very ground-plane of simplicity (though probably only permanently realizable by a highly cultured humanity, having access to all the results of art and science, as Thoreau had at Concord) \u2026, I must confess, [made] me uncomfortable for some years. I felt that I had aimed at a natural life and completely failed \u2026. \u2026. At any rate I do not regret now that things happened as they did. Instead of escaping into solitude and the wilds of nature \u2026 I was tied to the traffic of ordinary life, and thrown inevitably into touch with all sorts of people. (My Days, pp. 115\u2013116)\n\nHere, Carpenter positions a retreat into nature as a temptation towards solipsism to be avoided rather than an unqualified virtue and came to see that life by Walden Pond was a luxury available only to those with other resources (from \u2018highly cultured humanity\u2019) rather than a solution to more wide-scale insufficiency or deprivation. Carpenter\u2019s own experience of sharing a life with working-class men such as Albert Fearnehough and George Merrill gave him an insight into the gulf\u2014of privilege, opportunity and education\u2014that resulted from class divisions, even in a utopian space like Millthorpe.Footnote 2 Although Carpenter eroticised cross-class same-sex relationships as an idealised form of sociality that presaged a more utopian future in his version of socialist democracy, he remained clear-eyed throughout his life not only about the way class privilege had habituated him from childhood to certain restrictive forms of social life (etiquette, dress, mode of speech and forms of leisure) but also how class differences could remain a point of contention even in the most intimate relationships.Footnote 3\n\nNevertheless, Carpenter\u2019s Millthorpe experience\u2014\u2018liv[ing] with cottagers \u2026 and shar[ing] their life\u2019 (\u2018Simplification\u2019, p. 79)\u2014gave him a first-hand knowledge of the practicalities of self-sufficiency that permanently alienated him from his class background. He could, he wrote, thenceforward only regard middle-class lifestyles as marred by unnecessary and unsatisfying forms of consumption and restrictive social practices that he dubbed variously as \u2018waste\u2019 (\u2018Simplification\u2019, p. 79) or \u2018congestion\u2019 in his essay \u2018The Enchanted Thicket\u2019: It is all congestion. Congestion at the dance \u2013 so many people, such dresses, that dancing is impossible. Congestion at the dinner party \u2013 congestion in twelve courses; so much to eat that eating is impossible. Congestion of books \u2013 so much to read, that reading is impossible. Congestion in church \u2013 stitched and starched to the eyes\u2026. Such a congestion of unused wealth and property, such a glut, as surely the world before has never seen, and to purge which away will surely require such medicine as the world before has never seen \u2013 no gilded pill or silent perambulator this time, but a drastic bolus plowing its way through the very frame of \u201csociety,\u201d not without groans and horrible noises. (\u2018Enchanted,\u2019 p. 141)\n\nCarpenter\u2019s deliberately corporeal depiction of over-consumption on a massive scale, requiring a purgative of similar proportions, provides a powerful image of the dire consequences of excess and affluence on the Victorian body politic. Here, as elsewhere, Carpenter is at pains to show that such excess deprives the privileged as well as the disenfranchised of an authentic quality of life derived from \u2018a full and unmediated awareness of one\u2019s body, a world of somatic relations where the body is unconstrained and unsullied by things\u2019 (Hatt, p. 399).\n\nFor Carpenter, then, the concept of \u2018enough\u2019 was central to his exploration of the good life\u2014or \u2018a simple, self-supporting life\u2019 (\u2018Enchanted\u2019, p. 148)\u2014that he believed was the foundation of a healthy society and underpinned his vision of a socialist future. Too much (wealth, food, possessions and elaborate social conventions), and the \u2018slow poison and paralysis\u2019 of the entire society results (\u2018Enchanted\u2019, p. 140); too little, and the starvation, disease and rage of \u2018hundreds of thousands [in] the slums of our great cities\u2019 is the inevitable outcome (p. 140). So how can sufficiency be calculated? This is the question with which Carpenter begins his essay, \u2018Simplification of Life\u2019: the \u2018great question of practical life\u2019 (p. 79), he proposes, is how much labour is enough to earn or produce the means to sustain life? Given the idealism associated with Carpenter\u2019s socialism, the level of detail that he provides in this essay may come as a surprise to some readers: he calculates not only the costs of provisions per head per day (flour costs \u2018about 1d. per day each\u2019) but the amount of land needed to \u2018provide a year\u2019s bread for a family of five\u2019 (an acre), with an additional quarter acre \u2018sufficient to grow all potatoes and other vegetables and some fruit for the year\u2019s use \u2019 (\u2018Simplification\u2019, p. 80). Interestingly, however, these calculations for self-sufficiency assume that this labour is not one\u2019s sole occupation but combined with other means of support, such as wage-earning through a trade or\u2014as in his own case\u2014writing: \u2018Such a piece of land may easily be cultivated by anyone in the odd hours of regular work\u2019 (p. 80), Carpenter writes, with a pragmatism informed by his own experience and observation of the \u2018traffic of ordinary life\u2019 at Millthorpe.\n\nIt is this experience that causes Carpenter, throughout this essay, to ground his outline of the simplification of life on the model of the \u2018cottager\u2019s way of life\u2019 as providing the best template for a more equitable and pleasurable mode of living in \u2018a socialistic state of society\u2019 (p. 98). While here, as elsewhere in England\u2019s Ideal, he assumes a middle-class reader, Carpenter argues that it is the experience of self-sufficiency he has learned (initially through living with the Fearnehoughs) from which the \u2018well-to-do\u2019 would benefit: Of course the current mode of life is so greatly wasteful, and we have come to consider so many things as necessaries \u2013 whether in food, furniture, clothing, or what not \u2013 which really bring us back next to no profit or pleasure compared with the labour spent upon them, that it is really difficult to know where the balance of true economy would stand if, so to speak, left to itself. All we can do is to take the existing mode of life in its simpler forms \u2026 and work from that as a basis. For though the cottager\u2019s way of living, say in our rural districts or in the neighbourhood of our large towns, is vastly superior to that of the well-to-do, that does not argue that it is not capable of improvement. (\u2018Simplification,\u2019 p. 83)\n\nSo it is an increase in (true) profit and pleasure for all that is Carpenter\u2019s goal in the simplification of life but while the cottagers possess a knowledge of self-sufficiency that Carpenter seeks to pass on to his readers, he avoids the temptation to romanticise their way of life, being all too aware of the hardships and limitations that life on the land created. The cottagers\u2019 way of life, that is, was a good starting point for a future society (which would include, Carpenter hoped, the collectivisation of land ownership) but it was not the end point of social transformation.\n\nGiven his focus here on the everyday domestic economy of a household , however, Carpenter also necessarily turns his attention to the inequitable gendered division of labour as of vital significance in improving the quality of daily life: For it must be remembered that with this whole matter hangs the question of women\u2019s work. Woman is a slave, and must remain so as long as ever our present domestic system is maintained. I say that our average mode of life, as conceived under the bourgeois ideal of society, cannot be kept up without perpetuating the slavery of women. (\u2018Simplification,\u2019 p. 86, original emphasis)\n\nFrom the over-worked female servants in country houses to the middle-class matrons stifled by the conventions of decorous femininity and household management, Carpenter\u2019s philosophy of simplification as a form of social and somatic liberation was an inclusive one. In \u2018The Enchanted Thicket\u2019, his critique of women\u2019s enslavement to domesticity was especially pronounced. Addressing women of his own class directly to incite them to take action against the exploitation of lower-class women, Carpenter wrote: \u2018this life that you lead, with its perpetual denial of humanity, cannot satisfy you for long\u2026. But now you are shut away \u2013 you are in prison\u2019 (p. 145). As in his vision for the social emancipation of men as requiring firstly a liberation of the body represented as a resurrection from a form of death, here too Carpenter depicts middle-class women as \u2018chained to the dead body of yourself. This weary weight you drag from room to room\u2019 (p. 146). In outlining his principles of sufficiency and simplicity as the basis of a wider social transformation, then, Carpenter sought to challenge current understandings of gender and sexuality, as well as class. Reorganising the everyday practicalities of the production and consumption of food, dress and the contents of the domestic interior, he believed, would transform and enrich the daily lived experience of men and women of all classes.\n\nIn \u2018Simplification of Life\u2019, Carpenter detailed these practicalities in ways that are intended to demonstrate how the minutiae of everyday life could advance the utopian ideals of simplicity and sufficiency but which also frankly laid bare the inconsistencies of his attempts to live out his ideals. If there is a blurring of the lines at times between clear ethico-political principles as the basis of this mode of living and his own personal tastes or preferences, Carpenter is not beyond a refreshing degree of humour or self-mockery that both deflects any charge of pomposity and makes plain the difficulties of consistently living according to the principles of self-sufficiency. While advocating a mostly vegetarian diet on the grounds of both health and the ethical treatment of animals, for instance, Carpenter also makes unequivocal pronouncements such as: Less that a pennyworth of oatmeal will make one person a large dish of porridge, and this with an egg, or some cheese and a little fruit, will form a first-class dinner. As to the fearful and wonderful receipts contained in the cookery books, the formula \u2013 Serve up hot and throw out of the window \u2013 might, with advantage, be appended to most of them. (p. 84, original emphasis)\n\nHaving framed the question of the consumption of meat in terms of a moral argument concerning our relation to animals (p. 84), Carpenter does not, however, always take the high-minded approach more typical of, say, Henry Salt\u2019s advocacy of vegetarianism.Footnote 4 For example, Carpenter subsequently confesses that principles sometimes give way to less lofty human feelings at Millthorpe: On my little farm we have fowls in plenty, but we cannot get one for dinner, simply because no member of the household is sufficiently goaded by hunger to be willing to perform the sacrifice: and so Peggy and Fluffy, though old, are respited from month to month, or taken to market \u2013 such is human inconsistency! \u2013 to be killed ultimately by some one else. (p. 87)\n\nSimilarly, Carpenter\u2019s case for the \u2018simplifications of our daily life\u2019 in the domestic interior is premised on a deep familiarity with the imbrication of objects and social practices in the middle-class Victorian home, which he then humorously details in a way that suggests his own experience of entanglement in such processes in the past: It cannot be too often remembered that every additional object in a house required additional dusting, cleaning repairing, and lucky are you if its requirements stop there. When you abandon a wholesome tile or stone floor for a Turkey carpet, you are setting out on a voyage of which you cannot see the end. The Turkey carpet makes the old furniture look uncomfortable, and calls for stuffed couches and armchairs, the couches and armchairs demand a walnutwood table; the walnutwood table requires polishing, and the polish bottles require shelves; the couches and armchairs have castors and springs \u2013 which give way and want mending; they have damask seats which fade and must be covered; the chintz covers require washing, and when washed they call for antimacassars to keep them clean. The antimacassars require wool, and the wool requires knitting-needles, and the knitting-needles require a box, the box demands a side-table to stand on, and the side-table involves more covers and castors \u2013 and so we go on. (\u2018Simplification,\u2019 pp. 87\u201388)\n\nCarpenter\u2019s second-person address here implicitly includes the speaker: he is not so much a sage pronouncing on the vanities of the bourgeoisie, as sympathising out of a sense of a shared frailty, acknowledging the ease with which such domestic excess becomes normalised (and, in the process, conveying a keen awareness of the usually feminine labour, whether paid or unpaid, that such domestic d\u00e9cor required that strikes one as atypical as the perspective of the average middle-class Victorian man).\n\nIn marked contrast to the upholstered excesses of Victorian design, Carpenter\u2019s principle of simplification advocates simplicity of the domestic interior that, in a manner consistent with William Morris \u2019s lectures on domestic aesthetics, is not a call to Spartan austerity but to a simplified d\u00e9cor in which individual objects and natural materials can become the focus of aesthetic attention as they serve a useful purpose. \u2018I like a room which looks its best when the sun streams into it through wide open windows and doors\u2019, Carpenter writes. \u2018If the furnishing of it cannot stand this test \u2013 if it looks uncomfortable under the operation \u2013 you may be sure there is something unwholesome about it\u2019 (\u2018Simplification\u2019, p. 89). Related to this rejection of excess in interior design is Carpenter\u2019s advocacy of recycling: both are based on giving due attention and value to each item that we possess and use in our home. In a simply furnished house , \u2018Everything is alive, and transparent too with cleanly human life. But your modern drawing-room is dead \u2013 a stupor comes over the mind as it gazes at the aimless armchairs\u2019 (\u2018Simplification\u2019, p. 90). Giving due acknowledgement to the worth of what we own and use can itself offer a form of pleasure that, for Carpenter, can also be expressed through wasting nothing, recycling or repurposing objects and materials that extends their life. He describes how hats past wear may be \u2018cut up into strips for nailing creepers to the wall\u2019 (\u2018Simplification\u2019, p. 96) or how worn undergarments may become bandages or washing cloths but it is in the example of an old coat that Carpenter best expresses his philosophy of recycling as a form of relationship between humans, animals and matter: When my coat has worn itself into an affectionate intimacy with my body, when it has served for Sunday best, and for weekdays, and got weather-stained out in the fields with sun and rain \u2013 then, faithful, it does not part from me, but getting itself cut up into shreds and patches descends to form a hearthrug for my feet. After that, when worn through, it goes into the kennel and keeps my dog warm, and so after lapse of years, retiring to the manure-heaps and passing out on to the land, returns to me in the form of potatoes for my dinner; or being pastured by my sheep reappears upon their backs as the material of new clothing. Thus it remains a friend to all time, grateful to me for not having despised and thrown it away when it first got behind the fashions. (\u2018Simplification,\u2019 p. 96)\n\nThe circulation and transformation of organic materials within the ecosystem described here, in which the death of an individual organism gives way to new forms of life, is as much a transmission of affect (articulated in terms like friendship, gratitude and fidelity) as of matter, where sustainability also includes sustaining relationships between organisms.\n\nEdward Carpenter\u2019s ideal of sufficiency, then, was a means to escape the suffocating social practices and futility of purpose he had experienced in the late-Victorian middle-class home and the cloisters of Cambridge. Marrying socialist ideals with the pleasures of \u2018Plain food , the open air, the hardiness of sun and wind\u2019 (My Days, p. 166), Carpenter\u2019s philosophy of simplicity and sustainability was not immune from Romantic conceptions of nature but it was a lived practice that required daily physical labour and engagement with a wide range of human actors across the social spectrum. \u2018To live in opulent and luxurious surroundings\u2019 was, for Carpenter, not enough because \u2018One loses the most precious thing the world can give \u2013 the great freedom and romance of finding expression and utterance for one\u2019s most intimate self in the glorious presence of Nature and one\u2019s fellows\u2019 (My Days, p. 166). Carpenter believed that adopting a life of simplicity was a means not only to ensure greater social equality but would\u2014paradoxically\u2014enrich the lives of the privileged whose wealth protected them from experiencing life to the full. Consuming less not more, Carpenter believed, was the means to live the good life\u2014good in both senses, as a virtue and a pleasurable experience."}, {"url": "https://blogs.bl.uk/thenewsroom/2016/05/digital-archives-of-british-national-newspapers.html", "page_content": "Did you know that the historic back runs of most of the British national newspapers that are published today have been digitised by online publishers and that these are all available for free in British Library Reading Rooms?

Most of the reviewers write far more about Potter than the book. Most agree that Carpenter does not capture the \"true\" Potter.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Reviews :\n\n\"(W)hat is valuable about this book is that it reveals Potter\u2019s real private life, which barely features in his plays: the happiness and stability of his marriage to Margaret, his childhood sweetheart. (...) But a biography presenting Potter as Mr Happy Family Man would add hardly an atom of understanding to the work. For the work we need to understand the illness, which in turn induced the sexual yearning, and Carpenter is good on that.\" - Lynn Barber, Daily Telegraph\n\n\n\n\n\n\"(Carpenter's) neutrality, his refusal to mediate, also becomes irritating: there is too little intelligence and insight, too much tape. There are so many many interviews, so many quotes from journalists and critics, that all narrative flow is lost, and with it any sense of Potter himself.\" - Stephen Moss, The Guardian\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Carpenter does present a vast amount of material, but he tends to do so indiscriminately and, apart from the obvious chronology of a life, the whole lacks shape and direction. (...) Essentially, then, this is an oversized lucky dip of a book, containing lots of sawdust and muck but with a few smart prizes for the persistent digger -- particularly at the end.\" - Sarah J. Smith, Historical Journal of Film, Radio, and Television\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Carpenter's approach proves fully justified. (...) Carpenter paints a compelling portrait of a complex man with deep emotional and physical scars, whose religious faith failed to exorcise his inner demons. He shows how Potter's overwhelming sense of guilt at once drove him to write (not for nothing did be repeatedly refuse analysis) and furnished him with his lifelong subject.\" - Michael Arditti, The Independent\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yet even those familiar with Potter's career might be astonished by Humphrey Carpenter's disturbing, engrossing, fair-minded biography. (...) He writes fluently and stays out of his subject's way, marshaling information and allowing readers to arrive at their own judgments.\" - Caryn James, The New York Times Book Review\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Humphrey Carpenter's 'authorised' biography is absurdly long. (...) Carpenter trudges through the life, enumerating the women with whom Potter did, or did not (almost certainly not) have affairs, and giving the plot of every play, film and novel, followed by a summary of critical comment. Media studies departments will find this useful, but Dennis would have slaughtered it. The book wholly fails to capture the spirit of a very difficult, tormented, hugely talented man who changed the way we look at ourselves through television.\" - Julian Mitchell, The Spectator\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Assured in combining analysis of the life and the work (in contrast to the many literary biographers who prefer to eschew the latter), Carpenter quotes superbly, whether from Potter himself or people writing about Potter (.....) (H)e is also an outstanding interviewer, extracting wonderfully vivid recollections.\" - John Dugdale, The Sunday Times\n\n\n\n\n\n\"(Carpenter's) door-stopping tome is largely a dutiful plod through the documentary record of Potter's life, right down to his voluminous medical records, interminable plot summaries and blow-by-blow accounts of his rows with producers, directors and editors. (...) But in the end we are brought back to Potter's reasons for not wanting anyone to write his biography. If people could so misinterpret him in life, they would surely do even worse in death. \"Biography,\" he wrote, \"is the most brutish of the arts\". Carpenter has proved him right.\" - John Naughton, The Times\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Humphrey Carpenter's meticulous and grimly readable biography shows clearly not only how his upbringing as the son of a miner in the Forest of Dean was likely to make Potter a socialist of the awkward-sod variety, but also the fissure which his academic intelligence and aspirations drove between him and his background\" - Sean O'Brien, Times Literary Supplement\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Potter was, to be sure, a complex, fascinating character, at once tender and (in several senses) scabrous, rebarbative and admirable (.....) And yet, for all this, Potter's life does not make for terribly interesting reading. (...) For the above reasons alone, I cannot recommend Dennis Potter to general readers. There are, moreover, problems inherent to the biography itself. Carpenter has devoted too many pages to plot summary and network squabbling, too few to Potter's inner and family life. As a result, his book feels, despite its considerable heft, oddly perfunctory\" - Ben Downing, The Washington Post\n\nPlease note that these ratings solely represent the complete review 's biased interpretation and subjective opinion of the actual reviews and do not claim to accurately reflect or represent the views of the reviewers.

From his first efforts in the 1960s to the posthumously produced Karaoke (see our review) and Cold Lazarus (see our review) he was responsible for some of the finest television programming of these times. He was a master of the medium, best known for the classics Pennies from Heaven and The Singing Detective. In addition, he was also a novelist and an Academy Award-nominated screenwriter, responsible for the scripts to such movies as Dreamchild, Gorky Park, and Nicholas Roeg's Track 29\n\nHumphrey Carpenter presents the \"only authorized biography\" (so the American edition), a tome that offers a useful if not ideal overview of Potter's life. The prologue acknowledges Potter's alter ego Daniel Feeld's plaintive dying wish in Cold Lazarus: \"No biography !\" It is, of course, a demand no biographer can accept -- and Carpenter had long been beaten to the punch by W. Stephen Gilbert, whose Potter-biography Fight & Kick & Bite appeared in 1995. Part of the fun in writing Potter's biography of course also lies in the fact that, despite his protestations to the contrary, much of his work seems very autobiographical.\n\nCarpenter's biography relies a great deal on quotes. Potter's work and words are extensively quoted, as are friends, relatives, and co-workers who were either interviewed by Carpenter or wrote letters in reply to Carpenter's questions. It makes for a varied read, but is perhaps not ideal for a biography. In particular the interviews -- reminiscences generally dredged up long after the fact -- make for a muddle of disparate versions and opinions. Other quotes, in particular from Potter's work (much of it not readily available) and the reactions at the time (newspaper articles and reviews), are, however, very effective and informative. Some of Carpenter's choices are a bit untidy -- so the many early references to and quotes from The Changing Forest, uselessly described for those not familiar with it (most of us, we suggest) simply as \"Potter's second book\" (only much later does Carpenter get to the book itself, clearing up some of the mystery), or the excessive use of quotes from Potter's two Desert Island Discs appearances.\n\nThe somewhat flat beginning still manages to convey Potter's humble beginnings in the Forest of Dean. Once Potter is at Oxford Carpenter does quite well, and it is this period that is of particular interest to those who know only the later Potter. The uneasy balance between Potter's personal life and his writing is perhaps most convincingly presented here, when much of Potter's writing was still straightforwardly political and social, as he stood as a candidate to be a Labour MP (member of parliament) and wrote for (and edited) Isis and other journals.\n\nPotter was a young success, making an impression -- and making the best of the opportunities that came his way. He managed to get a much sought after place as a BBC trainee, and wrote extensively: books, reviews, and, eventually, TV plays.\n\nCarpenter follows Potter's progress well enough, devoting some space to (and including some quotes from) what seems to be every major piece. He lingers longer over some works than others, but few are ignored entirely (though the ill-fated Mesmer certainly deserves a bit more coverage). His summaries of how the works came about (often based on previous work), the works themselves, and popular and critical reaction to them give a good overview of almost all of Potter's output. The summaries of the works are particularly useful for those who have no memory (or knowledge) of them and for whom they would otherwise be inaccessible (as most of Potter's writings are out of print and his TV plays -- with a few exceptions -- almost impossible to find).\n\nCarpenter makes a great deal of Potter's psychosexual inclinations -- as he perhaps inevitably must. There was a childhood violation of Potter, which surfaces in some form in many of his works. Potter's view of women -- as also reflected in his characters -- was also less than enlightened or completely healthy. Carpenter may seem to harp on this a bit much, but it is hard to get around it, and overall he does a good enough job of it.\n\nCarpenter seems a bit less certain about Potter's debilitating ailment, the psoriatic arthropathy that crippled his hands and left him constantly shedding his skin. Carpenter devotes significant space to it, but the coverage still seems somewhat inadequate -- though he mentions that Potter always wanted hotel rooms with light-coloured carpeting (so that the shed skin flakes weren't too noticeable) far too often.\n\nMost disappointing is Carpenter's coverage of Potter's domestic life, which comes into focus only once or twice in the entire book. Potter's wife, portrayed as an anchor for Potter, remains largely a cypher, and his home life (with three children) a mystery. Similarly, longtime associate Kenith Trodd moves in and out of Potter's life constantly but remains an awkward presence: Carpenter has to note his role and presence but doesn't seem to be able to make anything of it.\n\nStill, the personality of the man does come across. The cigarette addiction, the heavy drinking, the rude outbursts, than shy flirtations with his leading ladies: all are convincingly conveyed, mainly because so many episodes document them.\n\nCarpenter offers a fill of fact, carefully researched -- one imagines. But perhaps one only imagines it: most of the facts are too obscure for the casual reader (or reviewer) to check, but there are mistakes that are obvious to all. Writing about the Hollywood movie production of Pennies from Heaven (directed by Herbert Ross, starring Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters) Carpenter notes that Potter's screenplay \"was nominated for an Academy Award\" and he confidently (if parenthetically) adds that this was \"the only nomination Pennies received\". In fact, of course, in addition to being nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay, \"Pennies\" was also nominated for Best Costume Design (Bob Mackie) and Best Sound. These may be second tier awards, but they are Academy Award nominations nonetheless. If Carpenter gets such facts wrong what can one make of his other facts ? (A pox on the editors too, by the way -- this is exactly the sort of mistake they are supposed to catch.)\n\nSome of reminiscences are particularly poignant and illuminating, and the book reads fairly fluidly. Much of the information one would want is here. There is little analysis of the works; what interpretation there is tends to be of the psychological variety: Carpenter treads warily here -- but not warily enough. The book is too immediate to make for a truly good biography: all the quotes and information read more like the notes for such an undertaking than the actual finished product. Potter's definitive biography will have to be written by someone with more distance from the subject. As an introduction and overview this book will, however, certainly do.\n\n- Return to top of the page -\n\n:\n\nFaber Finds publicity page\n\nClenched Fists - the official Dennis Potter web site\n\nBrief biography and bibliography\n\nThe Passion of Dennis Potter -- a collection of international essays\n\nSee Index of Biographical works under review\n\nSee Index of TV and Film-related books\n\n- Return to top of the page -\n\nAbout the Author :\n\nHumphrey Carpenter is the author of numerous biographies.\n\n- Return to top of the page -"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Times", "page_content": "The Times, daily newspaper published in London, one of Britain\u2019s oldest and most influential newspapers. It is generally accounted, with The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph, one of Britain\u2019s \u201cbig three\u201d and has long been recognized as one of the world\u2019s greatest newspapers.\n\nFounded by John Walter on January 1, 1785, as The Daily Universal Register, the newspaper began as a 2 1/2-penny broadsheet whose main function was to publicize a system of typography in which Walter was then interested. It became The Times on January 1, 1788, publishing commercial news and notices, along with some scandal. The founder\u2019s son, John Walter II, took over the newspaper in 1803. He expanded it from 4 pages to 12 large pages, and, by the time control of the paper passed to his son, John Walter III, in 1848, the foundations of The Times\u2019s reputation as Britain\u2019s preeminent national journal and daily historical record had been laid.\n\nUnder its first great liberal editor, Thomas Barnes (editor from 1817 to 1841), The Times developed into a strong independent newspaper popularly described as the \u201cThunderer.\u201d By the mid-1800s it had become a widely respected influence on British public opinion, and its circulation had grown from 5,000 in 1815 to 40,000 in 1850. The Times maintained rigorous standards of reporting and writing and strove for meticulous accuracy. It came to be ruled by tradition, although its editorial views were independent, articulate, and strong. It was also seen as the very epitome of the British establishment, yet repeatedly it introduced innovative changes. John T. Delane became editor in 1841, and in his 36-year tenure his brilliant journalistic imprint was left on every aspect of the paper. In the midst of expanding The Times\u2019s national coverage, he hired the world\u2019s first war correspondent, William Howard Russell, to cover the Crimean War (1853\u201356). The British government first learned of Russian peace proposals in The Times.\n\nLate in the 19th century, overspending and the inadvertent publication of a forgery against the Irish hero Charles Stewart Parnell brought The Times\u2019s finances, reputation, and circulation to a serious low. As part of a recovery effort, The Times entered into an agreement with the publishers of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica for advertising and selling the 9th and 10th editions. It was not until 1908\u2014when the sensationalist press lord Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe, purchased the paper\u2014that The Times was financially secure, but its editorial reputation continued to deteriorate until Lord Northcliffe\u2019s death in 1922.\n\nIn the 1950s, when Sir William Haley, then the director general of the BBC, became the editor (1952\u201367), The Times once again became a great newspaper. Makeup and editorial changes were introduced to make the paper livelier and more interesting. News was put permanently on its front page in 1966 in place of advertisements. Later that year it was announced that Roy Thomson, owner of The Sunday Times, was acquiring the paper, and, beginning the following year, the two papers were published by the newly created Times Newspapers Ltd. In 1978, disputes between management and labour over a range of issues, including the implementation of modern typesetting and printing equipment, led to the suspension of publication for nearly a full year. But the newspaper and its reputation survived, and The Times continued to thrive.\n\nIn 1981 Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation acquired the paper through its purchase of Times Newspapers. In 2013 News Corporation divided its print and its television and film holdings into separate conglomerates, and ownership of the paper was transferred to the reconstituted News Corporation."}, {"url": "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/static/about-us/", "page_content": "Thetimes.co.uk hosts the digital edition of The Times, Britain\u2019s oldest national daily newspaper, and its sister title The Sunday Times.\n\nThe Times was founded in 1785 by the editor and publisher John Walter I, \u201cto record the principal occurrences of the times\u201d for the service of the public.

Please wait...\n\nOne hundred years ago the name of Edward Carpenter, now largely forgotten, was known throughout the left in Britain. Yet Carpenter\u2019s ideals had little in common with what we think of as Victorian values.\n\nHe supported trade unions and called for industries to be controlled by workers. But he also argued that socialism must mean a total transformation of society \u2013 including changes to personal life and relationships.\n\nGay himself, Carpenter argued for the liberation of sexuality and the rejection of narrow male and female roles. He attempted to live self-sufficiently, rejecting complex technology in favour of a lifestyle that included simple clothes, vegetarianism and nude sun-bathing.\n\nHe travelled to Europe, America and Sri Lanka, where he developed an interest in eastern mysticism. He was a sort of Victorian hippy.\n\nNot that Carpenter was an isolated individual. He was part of an alternative network in the north of England \u2013 he lived near Sheffield \u2013 which included socialist meeting halls, coffee shops, Sunday schools and choirs.\n\nNow the socialist feminist writer Sheila Rowbotham has revived that forgotten world with her biography Edward Carpenter: A Life of Liberty and Love.\n\nIn it we encounter activists such as Jack Murphy, a young Sheffield worker who in 1913 bought a copy of The Suffragette from Molly Morris, who was selling papers in the street.\n\nJack normally bought The New Age, which included articles about trade union militancy, eastern religion and the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. But on this occasion he wanted to get chatting to Molly.\n\nEight years later they were married and heading off to revolutionary Russia. Molly was surprised to hear Jack, now a communist shop steward, reciting poetry \u2013 including some of Carpenter\u2019s.\n\nTwo socialist organisations existed at the time, the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) and the Independent Labour Party (ILP). Not only were activists interested in a wide range of ideas, they wanted to apply new thinking to their own lives.\n\nFor instance, in the 1890s a socialist tea party in the Colne Valley, Lancashire, saw men instead of women pouring the tea and doing the washing up. I asked Sheila where this culture of radicalism on gender issues had come from.\n\nTradition\n\n\u2018The West Yorkshire ILP had a strong tradition of supporting women\u2019s emancipation, though people have pointed out that other ILP areas were not so good,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018I think this was because working class women worked on a large scale in Lancashire and Yorkshire. There was a history of them working and having an independent life through their earnings.\u2019\n\nCarpenter had arrived in this environment in 1874 at the age of 30, having rejected an upper middle class upbringing and a teaching job at Cambridge University.\n\nInfluenced initially by the radical US poet Walt Whitman, Carpenter had come to find the privileged society in which he lived both artificial and spiritually dead.\n\nHe moved to the north of England to give lectures for the University Extension Movement, which aimed to give more people access to university level learning \u2013 though Carpenter was disappointed to find few workers attended.\n\nThree years later he arrived in Sheffield, where he became a socialist. He lectured at the Hall of Science, a centre for working class radicals and utopians.\n\nFrom the beginning, Carpenter\u2019s socialism was deeply connected to his feelings about nature and his personal life. He was horrified by the levels of air pollution in the city, went walking in the surrounding countryside and started to live on a farm.\n\nHe also began to have sexual \u00adencounters with workers \u2013 \u2018railwaymen, porters, clerks, signalmen, ironworkers\u2026\u2019 as he put it in his autobiography. He became involved in the SDF, where he met writer and artist William Morris. Sheila notes that \u2018both men\u2019s politics arose from a longing for free and equal human relations\u2019.\n\nSheffield Socialist Society was independent of both the ILP and SDF, and characterised by a wide range of viewpoints. The organisation\u2019s aims combined a utopian desire to regenerate society with practical demands. These included labour representation in parliament and on school boards, and municipal control of fuel, water and public transport.\n\nMembers ranged from wild revolutionaries to \u2018hard-headed municipal reformers\u2019 and included socialists of various stripes, anarchists and trade unionists.\n\nCarpenter\u2019s vision of simple socialist living was reflected in Millthorpe, the house he had built in 1883 after inheriting a substantial amount from his father. Here he settled with friends and attempted to live self-sufficiently by market gardening.\n\nSnarling\n\nThe house saw a constant stream of visitors of all kinds. Carpenter felt at home in this varied and contradictory movement. \u2018I stick up for Fabians and trade unions just as much as I do for anarchists. We are all travelling along the same road. Why should we be snarling at each other\u2019s heads?\u2019 he later wrote.\n\nWhile Carpenter was generous and unsectarian to a fault, he was generally unwilling to take up a party position or a decided point of view. Sometimes a virtue, this could become a fault.\n\nThe beginning of the First World War, for example, saw socialists across Europe divided. Many sided with their \u2018own\u2019 countries and supported the war, while only a few revolutionaries opposed it. For the first 18 months of the conflict, Carpenter was simply unable to decide.\n\n\u2018He is woolly,\u2019 says Sheila. \u2018A lot of his associates expected him to be anti-war. But his family did have this strong navy connection which seems to have affected him. And he did have these ideas \u2013 which quite a few liberal people who supported the war had too \u2013 that Germany was more militaristic and aggressive, and so the greater evil.\u2019\n\nSheila is clear that at times Carpenter was downright wrong. \u2018Carpenter had this wide vision of socialism, but he\u2019s not to be taken as some kind of ideal model,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018He spoke on one occasion in favour of immigration controls, and there are scattered references through his writings which are pretty antisemitic. That was quite common, but there were people at the time who criticised it.\u2019\n\nSexuality\n\nOne of the most fascinating and inspiring aspects of Carpenter\u2019s life was his sexuality. He was 42 when he fell in love with George Hukin, a 26 year old razor grinder. Their relationship is recorded in letters.\n\nHukin wrote to Carpenter that \u2018I don\u2019t think I ever felt so happy in my life.\u2019 Carpenter wrote to a friend that Hukin was \u2018too good almost to be true\u2019. For several months they wrote loving letters to each other and slept together \u2013 but then things went wrong.\n\nCarpenter was gay in the modern sense, loving and desiring only men. But Hukin was not. In fact, historical studies show that many working class men in this period identified as neither gay nor straight \u2013 categories which were only just beginning to be defined.\n\nAfter ten months of their relationship, as they lay in bed together, Hukin plucked up the courage to tell Carpenter that he was in love with a woman called Fannie and had got engaged to her. Carpenter was devastated.\n\nHukin did his best not to hurt anyone, writing to Carpenter that \u2018you really must come and live with us when we do marry. You will, won\u2019t you Ted? We shall all be so happy then\u2026\u2019 But this was hardly a practical solution, and the relationship ended.\n\nFour years later in 1891 Carpenter met George Merrill, the working class man who was to be his partner for the next 37 years \u2013 though their relationship wasn\u2019t monogamous. They lived openly together at Millthorpe, a courageous act in the decade that saw Oscar Wilde sent to prison for homosexuality.\n\nCarpenter wrote a series of pamphlets in the 1890s about women, marriage and sexuality, published by the Labour Press in Manchester. He circulated privately a fourth pamphlet, Homogenic Love, that opposed attacks on homosexuality.\n\nLater in that decade Carpenter also wrote Love\u2019s Coming of Age, which argued in favour of sex education. He celebrated the growing assertiveness of the \u2018new woman\u2019 \u2013 middle class women achieving equality by going to university and working in jobs such as teaching and medicine.\n\n\u2018He talks about the incomprehension that often arises between men and women in sexual relationships,\u2019 Sheila told me. \u2018He\u2019s very funny about that, about upper middle class men who get in a complete mess when they fall in love because they\u2019ve been taught never to express emotion.\u2019\n\nI asked Sheila about the extent to which Carpenter had risked disgrace and prison by writing about homosexuality and living openly as a gay man.\n\n\u2018His friend Lowes Dickenson said he didn\u2019t know how Carpenter had managed to get away with it. But he covered himself in a way by writing about sex generally \u2013 he could be seen as somebody who was just raising these issues.\n\n\u2018Because Homogenic Love couldn\u2019t be printed for public circulation, he got known as a theorist of modern relationships in general. He was always a little cautious. He never said that people should get off with everybody and have a wild time \u2013 he was always very \u2018proper\u2019 in the way he put things.\u2019\n\nRespectable\n\nCarpenter campaigned as openly as possible for gay rights, helping to found the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology in 1914. This organisation gave personal advice to large numbers of men, including the novelist EM Forster and poet Siegfried Sassoon. While openly respectable, he always ran the risk of jail.\n\nCarpenter was 70 when the First World War began in 1914. His sandals and rural living were beginning to look old-fashioned \u2013 and his vision didn\u2019t quite relate to the post-war world of Labour governments and the Communist Party.\n\nHe had little to say, for example, in response to the Russian Revolution of 1917, though he continued to support trade union struggles such as Britain\u2019s 1926 general strike.\n\nThe last years of Carpenter\u2019s life saw him admired throughout the left. On his 80th birthday in 1924 he received greetings from the first Labour Party cabinet, the TUC and dozens of other organisations. He died in 1929, aged 85.\n\nHe was remembered, Sheila explains, in two ways. \u2018First, through the local labour movement, who were the people who knew him. When socialist historians Dorothy and Edward Thompson went to Halifax in the late 1940s, working class people they met there had books by Carpenter on their shelves.\n\n\u2018Gay men also remembered him. A whole generation read his books and he\u2019d helped so many people. He was a kind of networking political therapist.\u2019\n\nA hundred years on from Carpenter\u2019s heyday his mistakes and eccentricities are easy to mock, but they are the least important thing about him. Far more significant is his determination to live according to his principles.\n\nHe left behind a privileged life to grow his own vegetables and darn his own socks, lived with George Merrell though they risked prison, and inspired thousands of workers with his vision of socialism.\n\nFor Carpenter, in Sheila\u2019s words, \u2018socialism wasn\u2019t just about external inequality, it was also about how people interact in their everyday relationships\u2019. In that vision socialism is about the workplace and economic power \u2013 but also about a new life of love, fellowship and harmony with nature. It is a vision that can still inspire us today.\n\nEdward Carpenter: A Life of Liberty and Love by Sheila Rowbotham is published by Verso, price \u00a324.99.

According to the Sunday Express Special Representative, who wrote the piece in 1918, Patricia \u201cloved to take little informal trips to places of interest\u201d and the correspondent organised a trip to the cinema for her and Alexander where \u201cthe party arrived at the entrance, waited just a moment to allow others to pass them and slipped quietly upstairs without any fuss and no one knew they had been there until the next morning.\u201d Just like our modern couple.\n\nGETTY Sir Arthur Pearson was a journalist and newspaper proprietor, who founded the Daily Express in 1900\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Sunday Express was launched in 1918 under editor James Douglas, with sister title the Scottish Daily Express following 10 years later. John Gordon became editor in 1931, and one of his major innovations was the newspaper horoscope. He commissioned astrologer RH Naylor to write a horoscope for Princess Margaret and it appeared three days after her birth, on August 24, 1930. Naylor correctly predicted the Princess would have \u201can eventful life\u201d and his predictions became the first regular newspaper stars column.\n\nGETTY The Sunday Express was the first paper to report the romance between Patricia and Alexander Ramsay\n\nUnder Gordon\u2019s editorship there was also an extremely popular gossip column called Londoner\u2019s Log, written by Valentine Browne, Lord Castlerosse. Playboy Castlerosse weighed 18st, lived the high life and was terribly well connected, with high society eager to see what he\u2019d written that week. He was the inspiration for Mr Chatterbox, the gossip columnist in Evelyn Waugh\u2019s novel Vile Bodies. The best-known Sunday Express editor was tough-talking Glaswegian John Junor, who took up the reins in 1954. He began as a reporter on the Daily Express in 1948 and within months he was penning the Sunday Express\u2019s Cross-Bencher political gossip column.\n\nGETTY The Sunday Express was the first newspaper to break the news of Prince Harry and Meghan's romance\n\nSir John edited the paper for 32 years and revelled in controversy and bringing politicians to account. In 1956, he wrote a furious condemnation of a Government scheme that allowed MPs to keep their generous fuel allowances while the rest of the nation suffered under the rationing that came as a result of the Suez Crisis. Parliament viewed this as contempt and Sir John was the last \u201cstranger\u201d \u2013 or non-MP \u2013 to be brought before the Speaker of the House to account for their actions, in January 1957. He apologised but added: \u201cIn my judgment these allowances were a proper and, indeed, an inescapable subject of comment in a free Press.\u201d Sir John\u2019s JJ column was written in \u201cman of the people\u201d style.\n\nHe thought Prince Charles should get a job and coined the phrase \u201cPass the sick-bag, Alice\u201d as a sign-off for a comment that made him feel nauseous. Gossip and show-business were key parts of the Sunday Express mix. Peter Dacre wrote the Ephraim Hardcastle diary column and got a major scoop in 1954 with the story of industrialist James Goldsmith eloping with Bolivian heiress Isabel Patino. Dacre was also the first British journalist to get an interview with Elvis Presley. Fellow show-business writer Roderick Mann was another with impeccable Hollywood contacts and was a close friend of Cary Grant (who left Mann his stylish wardrobe of clothes when he died), Anthony Hopkins, Richard Burton and David Niven.\n\nGETTY Carl Giles was the Express's official war artist during the Second World War\n\nCartoonists were also important to the paper. Carl Giles not only created his famous family, with outspoken black-clad Grandma, but was also the Express\u2019s official war artist during the Second World War. Michael Cummings, with his familiar heavy-lined cartoons and caricatures was also a stalwart. But ultimately, it\u2019s news stories and bringing them to the readers that have been most important to the Sunday Express. We were one of the first newspapers to break the news when Princess Diana died in 1997 and we have run an award-winning Crusade For Mental Health since 2012."}, {"url": "http://www.isabelperez.com/module4_tesis/pages/NEWSPAPERS%20IN%20BRITAIN.htm", "page_content": "NEWSPAPERS IN BRITAIN All newspapers in Britain, daily or Sunday ones, can broadly he divided into the quality press and the popular press. The quality newspapers are also known as \u201cheavies\u201d and they usually deal with home and overseas news, with detailed and extensive coverage of sports and cultural events. Besides they also carry financial reports, travel news and book and film reviews.\n\nThe popular press or the \u201cpopulars\u201d are also known as tabloids as they are smaller in size being halfsheet in format. Some people also call them the \u201cgutter press\u201d offering news for the people less interested in daily detailed news reports. They are characterised by large headlines, carry a lot of big photographs, concentrate on the personal aspects of news, with reports of the recent sensational and juicy bits of events, not excluding the Royal family. The language of a tabloid is much more colloquial, if not specific, than that of quality newspapers.\n\nHere is a possibly witty though true classification of English newspapers: \u201cThe Times\u201d is read by the people who run the country; \u201cThe Mirror\u201d is read by the people who think they run the country; \u201cThe Guardian\u201d is read by the people who think about running the country; \u201cThe Mail\u201d is read by wives of the people who run the country; \u201cThe Daily Telegraph\u201d is read by the people who think the country ought to be run as it used to be; \u201cThe Express\u201d is read by the people who think it is still run as it used to be; \u201cThe Sun\u201d is read by the people who don\u2019t care who runs the country as long as the naked girl at page three is attractive.\n\nIn Britain today there are four nationwide quality papers: \u201cThe Times\u201d, \u201cThe Daily Telegraph\u201d, \u201cThe Guardian\u201d and \u201cThe Independent\u201d. \u201cThe Daily Mail\u201d, \u201cThe Daily Mirror\u201d, \u201cThe Sun\u201d, \u201cThe Daily Express\u201d and \u201cThe Daily Star\u201d are usually considered to be \u201cpopulars\u201d. \u201cThe Times\u201d founded in 1785, is read by the minority of people today. It has a rather small circulation, but its influence is greater than its circulation figures (100,000 copies a day). It is an establishment newspaper, read by lawyers, politicians, and businessmen, by all those who work in the government at large. It is not an organ of the Conservative Party, but still is rather conservative in views it expresses, though it is reliable and unbiased and claims to be politically independent.\n\nHowever, \u201cThe Times\u201d, as many Englishmen stress themselves, always supports the government in power, the bureaucracy, because the bureaucracy in Britain, they say, does not change when the general elections take place. It is, thus, the newspaper for the upper echelon of the civil service. \u201cThe Daily Telegraph\u201d, founded in 1855, is a very conservative paper. However, it has a circulation twice as big as that of \u201cThe Times\u201d, \u201cThe Guardian\u201d or \u201cThe Independent\u201d. It has a nickname \u2013 \u201cThe Torygraph\u201d after the nickname \u201cTory\u201d of the Conservative Party. This newspaper has rather a comprehensive news and sports coverage. Some say it has a more objective reporting of what is going on in the world than any other quality newspaper. It is right of centre and has always supported the Conservative Party.\n\nIt is notable that although newspapers are normally associated with a particular political viewpoint, either left or right, most of them have no formal or legal links with political parties. \u201cThe Guardian\u201d has a slightly bigger circulation than \u201cThe Times\u201d. It is a liberal newspaper, noted for its lively reporting and campaigning support for \u201cworthy causes\u201d such as education, medical reforms, the problems of aging people and retirees, protection of the environment, etc. It also claims to be politically independent, but it is left of centre and formally supports the Liberal Party of Britain. Some British people say that the reporting of \u201cThe Guardian\u201d is biased and trendy, concentrating mostly on things like fashions, homosexuals, etc., but still it is enjoyed by its readers. \u201cThe Independent\u201d was founded in 1986 and has rapidly acquired a reputation for its excellent news coverage, intelligent reports, informal commentaries, and a good balanced sense of humour. \u201cThe Sun\u201d, founded in 1964, has a circulation of around four million and outsells all other \u201cpopulars\u201d. \u201cThe Daily Mirror\u201d with a circulation of about three million, was founded in 1903 and has always traditionally supported the Labour Party. Both \u201cThe Daily Mail\u201d and \u201cThe Daily Express\u201d have circulations of about a million and a half, and were founded in 1900 and 1896 respectively. Of the above mentioned newspapers, The Mail is the most sophisticated of the others. The populars as a rule, however, express, though they are mass circulation papers, no news. There you will find leading articles about murders, games, bingo and lotteries. Because they are in constant competition with each other, and want to sell more copies than their competitors in an effort to increase the readership and circulation, they actually all have nude girls in unconventional poses on page three or seven, devote much room to advertising holidays, vacation tours, etc. Actually all newspapers in Britain, both the quality and popular ones, have their sister Sunday issues. Thus, \u201cThe Sunday Times\u201d leads the field in the Sunday qualities. It has a circulation of over a million and is known for its excellent reporting in eight separate sections: a main news section and others devoted to sports news review, business, the arts, job advertisements, fashion and travel as well as book reviews. It was founded in 1822 and is right of centre. \u201cThe Observer\u201d is the oldest Sunday paper. It was founded in 1791 and today has a circulation of around half a million and is politically moderate in views. Founded in 1961 \u201cThe Sunday Telegraph\u201d is more right-wing and its circulation has been steadily declining. The best-selling Sunday popular newspaper is \u201cThe News of the World\u201d. Its circulation is over five million, and it has a reputation for its detailed reports of crime and sex stories but also for its sports coverage. \u201cThe Sunday Mirror\u201d offers a lot of photographs and much gossip.\n\nOther Sunday mass papers resemble their daily equivalents in style, in coverage and colour. In general, however, English people themselves, though slightly sniffy and condescending about their \u201cpopulars\u201d, underline that the quality of newspapers in Great Britain of late is much better than 20 years ago. They argue that it is much lower if they take the example of \u201cThe Times\u201d newspaper, which was taken over by Rupert Murdoch in the early eighties. He is the owner of News International and is among the people who have control over the press. Rupert Murdoch also owns \u201cThe Sun\u201d, which is, as it has already been stressed, a very low quality newspaper. To increase readership into \u201cThe Times\u201d he gradually increases a lot of techniques in it similar to those he introduced in \u201cThe Sun\u201d paper.\n\nMost people in Great Britain perceive the press in Great Britain as objective, since they claim that there is no overt censorship, no overt bias in reporting the news, and that there is a wide choice of newspapers apart from the national dailies.\n\nThere are a lot of different regional daily papers in Britain as well. One can mention the following \u201cThe Scotsman\u201d and \u201cThe Yorkshire Post\u201d. There are also local weekly papers and many London and local papers delivered or distributed free and paid for entirely from advertising. Thus in Britain one can find newspapers of every political colour, from the far left to the far right. There are several socialist newspapers on sale each week, for example, \u201cSocialist Worker\u201d, and many others. Most people are satisfied that there is a free and objective press. They say that the British press is also investigative, uncovers scandals in the governments, and if they are not satisfied with what they read in \u201cThe Times\u201d and think it is not true, they have the opportunity to go and pick up another newspaper and compare reportings.
