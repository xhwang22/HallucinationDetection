Among the winners were Damian Duffy and John Jennings\u2018 graphic novel adaptation of Octavia E. Butler\u2018s The Parable of the Sower, which won the 2021 Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story or Comic.\n\nThe 2020-released adaptation of Butler\u2019s 1993 dystopian science fiction novel beat \u2013 amongst others \u2013 Marjorie Liu and Sana Takeda\u2018s already three-time award winning series Monstress, and two Kieron Gillen-written series on the ballot (the second volume of Die, with Stephanie Hans; and the first volume of Once & Future, with Dan Mora).\n\nDuffy, accepting the 2021 Hugo on behalf of himself and Jennings, first read out a statement from the Octavia Butler Estate:\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, it is most important to say that Octavia Butler has Treasured The Two previous coveted Hugo awards she has received during the coUrse of her lifetime, and today, On behalf of The Octavia Butler Estate and Octavia E. Butler Enterprises, we are deeply honored and proud that this adaptation of PARABLE OF THE SOWER has been nominated for \u201cBest Graphic Novel\u201d, which now makes for a Third Hugo Award for Octavia Butler. Again we are most appreciative for receiving this award on Behalf of Octavia Butler\u2026 Thank you.\n\nDuffy continued,\n\n\u201cFrom John and I both: Thank you to, obviously, Octavia E. Butler \u2013 because she\u2019s a genius and awesome and why we do anything. And thank you to the Butler Estate\u2026for letting us work with them to do these adaptations. Thank you to our editor, Charlotte Greenbaum and our editorial consultant the great Tananarive Due. Thank you to Nalo Hopkinson for writing our introduction, and to our many colour flatters who \u2013 I don\u2019t have a list of names but you know who you are and thank you. And thank you to Charlie Kochman and maya Bradford, and to everyone at Abrams ComicArts. On behalf of John, thank you to his wife Tawana and their son Jaxon, who was born during the creation of this book. So, of course, I have to thank my family now: thank you to my parents, my mom Sharon, my wife Jen, my son Simon, my daughter Gwen. Thank you also to Chris and Jeff for giving me a space to drink beer and not have a nervous breakdown waiting for the announcement of this award. While such an honour and a privilege to collaborate with Octavia\u2019s words, and to win this award and to be part of all of this, I wish even more that the Earthseed books, their dystopian warning of a capitalistic hellscape were not so prescient, and I hope that Octavia\u2019s advice for hope and resistance for the future is more carefully attended. Thank you so much. Thank you to everyone I forgot. Thank you.\n\nJohn Jennings later posted on Facebook,\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a fan of science fiction as long as I can remember. My mom got me hooked on speculative fiction at a young age and I\u2019ve never looked back. However, when I read WILD SEED by Octavia E. Butler, I saw something that I\u2019d never seen before in those stories. I saw people who looked like me. The novel had a connection to the African diaspora and Black people were central and vital to the narrative. WILD SEED changed everything about what I was doing with my own attempts at writing. Octavia Butler shifted the paradigm for me. Today, my friend and collaborator Dr. Damian Duffy won The Hugo Award for the adaptation we did of one of Butler\u2019s most beloved and prescient works: THE PARABLE OF THE SOWER. It\u2019s an honor that I am incredibly moved by and I hope that we truly have added to her legacy. Feeling very grateful.\u201d\n\nPublisher Abrams tweeted:\n\nAmazing news! The graphic novel adaptation of PARABLE OF THE SOWER has won the 2021 @thehugoawards for Best Graphic Story or Comic. A huge congratulations to @JIJennings and Damian Duffy! https://t.co/PaOfV3YupA pic.twitter.com/5gGLF3jIsh \u2014 ABRAMS Books (@ABRAMSbooks) December 20, 2021\n\nDuffy and Jennings are already at work on adapting Butler\u2019s 1998 sequel Parable of the Talents.\n\nParable of the Sower is the pair\u2019s second Butler adaptation. In 2017 they released Kindred. A New York Times bestseller, the book also earned the pair a Bram Stoker Award that same year.\n\nAlso comics-related, the movie adaptation of Greg Rucka and Leandro Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019 2017 Image series The Old Guard won the 2021 Hugo for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form. Rucka himself wrote the screenplay for the Netflix-released movie, directed by Gina Prince-Bythwood and starring Charlize Theron.\n\nIn other news, the widely lauded Supergiant Games\u2019 Hades won the one-off special Video Game Hugo, and the series finale of The Good Place won Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form.\n\nBelow are the winners and nominees of the 2021 Hugo Awards in full.\n\nBest Novel\n\nWINNER: Network Effect, Martha Wells (Tor.com)\n\nBlack Sun, Rebecca Roanhorse (Gallery / Saga Press)\n\nThe City We Became, N.K.

Dick have in common? What about John Williams and Dungeons & Dragons? Jack Kirby and Steven Spielberg? Star Trek and Wonder Woman? George Lucas and Myst? Harlan Ellison and The Princess Bride? Although an eclectic group of writers, directors, games, films and artists, each of these iconic mainstays of Geek Culture share one significant honor \u2013 induction into into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame located at the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle, Washington.\n\nScience Fiction and fantasy have been literary genres for centuries, dating back to the publication of Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein in 1818 and the emergence of twin talents Jules Verne and H.G. Wells later that same century. The collection of stories known as The Arabian Nights and even Sir Francis Bacon\u2019s New Atlantis have elements of sci-fi within them, and date back even further. Fantasy has a much longer tradition, meanwhile, with the works of Homer from Ancient Greece and the legend of King Arthur from Medieval Britain all falling within the genre.\n\nBecause of the timeless nature of science fiction and fantasy, its influence on human history, and its growth in popularity during the twentieth century, the Kansas City Science Fiction and Fantasy Society teamed with the Center for the Study of Science Fiction at the University of Kansas to launch the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame in 1996. During its nine years in Kansas City, the Hall inducted eighteen members \u2013 all of whom were either writers or editors \u2013 including the aforementioned Mary Shelley, Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, as well as Edgar Rice Burroughs, Ursula K. Le Guin, Arthur C. Clarke, and Ray Bradbury.\n\nHugo Gernsback \u2013 often considered the \u201cfather of science fiction\u201d \u2013 was also an initial inductee. Although not a writer, it was Gernsback who published the first science fiction pulp magazine, Amazing Stories, in 1926. Not only did the pulps of the 1920s and 1930s embed an interest in science fiction in the minds of multiple generations, they likewise directly led to modern day Geek Culture and such staples as fan conventions and cosplay.\n\nIn 2004, the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame moved from Kansas City to Seattle, where Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen had already established the Experience Music Project. The Hall was merged into that venue and jointly became known as Experience Music Project and Science Fiction Hall of Fame, which was later shortened to simply EMP. The museum underwent an additional name change in 2016 \u2013 becoming the Museum of Pop Culture, or MoPOP for short \u2013 to better reflect its diverse nature.\n\nThe Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame also went through changes, with \u201cfantasy\u201d initially being dropped from its title before being restored in 2013, and a wider scope that included film, television and video games. Creations as well as creators likewise became eligible, and twenty additional inductees were added in 2016 to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the Hall of Fame\u2019s founding. While those changes went beyond the original scope established by the Kansas City-based partnership that established the Hall in 1996, they provided a broader perspective to the genres while making the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame more inclusive.\n\n\u201cFrom early on, we thought we\u2019d have to tell the whole story,\u201d Greg Bear, former chairman of the Experience Music Project\u2019s advisory board, told NBC News in 2004. \u201cThat means you take key artifacts \u2013 those you could get \u2013 and put them on display, everything from books and magazines to films. You interview authors, filmmakers, the creative minds and talk about what inspired them. And you put scientists into the mix. Put all that together and you\u2019ve got a fabulous story, one that hasn\u2019t been told before.\u201d\n\nAlthough it took a while, the Museum of Pop Culture eventually found ways to fulfill Greg Bear\u2019s vision with exhibits on Avatar and Star Trek, as well as the museum\u2019s involvement with the 2018 AMC miniseries James Cameron\u2019s Story of Science Fiction. \u201cEarly in development we gave feedback on the overall structure of the show \u2013 how to organize the sprawling topic that is science fiction into episodes and acts,\u201d MoPop curator Brooks Peck explained to AMC regarding the documentary. \u201cOnce that was established, I helped connect the producers to authors, critics, and other experts who could speak to the topics. I gave feedback on what science fiction creations to cover, especially in classic literature. We did a fair bit of wrangling over what to include and where, hashing out questions like, is Battlestar Galactica more appropriate in the Space section, or Intelligent Machines?\u201d\n\nIn addition to its involvement with James Cameron\u2019s Story of Science Fiction, the Museum of Pop Culture likewise launched a permanent Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame exhibit that not only honors each of the inductees but also spotlights their achievements through props from the creations that made them famous. The leather jacket and fedora worn by Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, for instance, compliments the Steven Spielberg display, while a lightsaber from the original 1977 Star Wars corresponds with George Lucas. Other highlights include a spacesuit from Lost in Space, a manuscript notebook from Ursula K. Le Guin, an IBM Selectric typewriter owned by Isaac Asimov, and the costume worn by Maurice Evans as Dr. Zaius in The Planet of the Apes.\n\n\u201cScience fiction and fantasy are two of the most important kinds of storytelling because they show us realities beyond our own,\u201d the exhibit explains. \u201cScience fiction offers reflections on our social structures and the technologies we use. Fantasy examines our spiritual values and the nature of good and evil. Both stimulate our imaginations, show us new possibilities, and take us away from our everyday lives.\u201d\n\nIn 1996, the Kansas City Science Fiction and Fantasy Society teamed with the Center for the Study of Science Fiction at the University of Kansas to launch the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame. Today, that endeavor continues at the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle. The location, however, is irrelevant as those inducted have already achieved a lasting legacy that goes beyond space and time while leaving an indelible mark on the history of the human race as well.\n\nAs the Museum of Pop Culture puts it, they \u201care the game-changers, the visionaries, the people and ideas who, each in their day, expanded the borders of imagination.\u201d\n\nAnthony Letizia"}, {"url": "https://www.geekwire.com/2014/5-geeky-inductees-science-fiction-fantasy-hall-fame/", "page_content": "Geek Life: Fun stories, memes, humor and other random items at the intersection of tech, science, business and culture.

And a Japanese animator whose Princess Mononoke fantasy adventure film is one of the most celebrated of all time.\n\nThose are among some of the 2014 inductees into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame, which is housed in Seattle at the EMP Museum. Inductees include author and screenwriter Leigh Brackett, artist Frank Frazetta, film director Stanley Kubrick, writer and animator Hayao Miyazaki, and author Olaf Stapledon.\n\nThey were nominated by EMP members, with final inductees chosen by a panel of award-winning authors, artists, editors, publishers, and film professionals. Other Hall of Fame members include musician David Bowie, author J.R.R. Tolkien and filmmaker George Lucas. The Hall of Fame was established in 1994, and moved to Seattle in 2004 from the University of Kansas.\n\nHere\u2019s more on each of the inductees, courtesy of EMP.\n\nLeigh Brackett, December 7, 1915 \u2013 March 17, 1978\n\nLeigh Brackett has been hailed as the \u201cQueen of the Space Opera\u201d\u2014a master of richly detailed stories of planetary romance. She began writing during the early years of the Golden Age of science fiction, quickly gaining prominence as a novelist and screenwriter.\n\nA native of Los Angeles, Brackett joined the Los Angeles Science Fiction Society in 1939 where she met other emerging science fiction authors including Ray Bradbury and Robert Heinlein. They would remain close personal friends for years to come. In 1940, her first published science fiction story, \u201cMartian Quest\u201d appeared in Astounding Science Fiction. She worked in many genres\u2014not only science fiction, but also crime, mystery, and westerns. Most of her science fiction falls into the planetary romance style (also called science fantasy)\u2014sagas of adventure and struggle across a fantastical solar system that included desert barbarians on Mars, jungles on Venus, and deadly storms on Mercury.\n\nEven at the time these stories were written it was known that these planets couldn\u2019t harbor such wonders, hence the term science fantasy. She embraced the escapist nature of the genre, saying, \u201cThese stories served to stretch our little minds, to draw us out beyond our narrow skies into the vast glooms of interstellar space, where the great suns ride in splendor and the bright nebulae fling their veils of fire parsecs-long across the universe\u2026. Escape fiction? Yes, indeed!\u201d Notable works include Shadow Over Mars (1951), The Long Tomorrow (1955), and Alpha Centauri or Die! (1963).\n\nSimultaneously, Brackett built a career as a screenwriter, notably with The Big Sleep (1946), Rio Bravo (1959), El Dorado (1966), and The Long Goodbye (1973). She contributed episodes to various TV series including The Alfred Hitchcock Hour and The Rockford Files. In 1977, director George Lucas hired Brackett to write the screenplay for Star Wars: Episode V \u2013 The Empire Strikes Back, bridging her space opera and screenwriting talents. She completed the first draft in 1978, just a few weeks before her death.\n\nFrank Frazetta, February 9, 1928 \u2013 May 20, 2010\n\nFrank Frazetta\u2019s prolific art graced the pages of comic books, the covers of paperback adventure novels, and the sleeves of record albums with a distinctively rugged style that strongly influenced future generations of illustrators.\n\nHis work is immediately recognizable and larger than life. The men in his illustrations flex their rippling musculature as scantily clad Amazon women flaunt improbable proportions\u2014both fighting off grotesque monsters conjured from Frazetta\u2019s imagination.\n\nA precocious child with preternatural artistic abilities, Frazetta enrolled at the Brooklyn Academy of Fine Arts at age 8 and by age 16 was working in Bernard Baily\u2019s studio as an assistant. In 1947, Graham Ingels gave Frazetta his big break with a job at Standard Comics. Frazetta drew comics across many genres: fantasy, westerns, and mysteries among them. Throughout the 1950s he worked at EC Comics and National Comics, as well as created covers for Buck Rogers and daily Flash Gordon strips. While his experiences in the comic book industry helped Frazetta hone his craft, he found the work to be stifling to his emerging personal style and vision.\n\nFrazetta hit his stride with painted covers for paperback adventure books. His covers for the Conan the Adventurer collection by Robert E. Howard redefined the sword and sorcery illustration completely\u2014many new readers bought the book based on the cover alone.\n\nThroughout his career, Frazetta accumulated many accolades, including a 1966 Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist and a Life Achievement Award in 2001 from the World Fantasy Convention. Frazetta was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1995 and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\nFrazetta is cited as an influence by a diverse group of artists including Yusuke Nakano (Nintendo\u2019s The Legend of Zelda), Roger Sweet (He-Man creator), and fantasy artist Joseph Vargo.\n\nStanley Kubrick, July 26, 1928 \u2013 March 7, 1999\n\nStanley Kubrick\u2019s impact on science fiction filmmaking cannot be underestimated. He brought otherworldly concepts to wide audiences and mainstream acceptance, and his film 2001: A Space Odyssey continues to influence the genre to this day.\n\nStarting in high school, Kubrick worked as a freelance photographer for Look magazine, and later became an employee. He began to hone his visual storytelling skills by creating stories told in series of still images. Soon he moved into documentary filmmaking, tackling diverse subjects such as boxers, sailors, and priests. His first feature film, a war story titled Fear and Desire (1953), had only two crew\u2014Kubrick and his wife Toba Metz. Seven years later he directed Spartacus (1960), the highest budget American film to date. With the apocalyptic satire Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964), Kubrick adapted a serious novel about nuclear destruction into a comedy\u2014to controversial effect.\n\nHis next project, 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), changed science fiction film forever. Based on Arthur C. Clarke\u2019s short story \u201cThe Sentinel\u201d and written in collaboration with him, the film is an ambitious portrayal of the evolution of humanity as assisted by extraterrestrials. It features bold special effects and a highly realistic portrayal of spaceflight. Many directors cite 2001 as a key influence, and the film set the stage for the coming era of the science fiction blockbuster.\n\nKubrick went on to write and direct A Clockwork Orange (1971), based on Anthony Burgess\u2019 novel about a sociopathic teen who is brainwashed into docility. He also worked for many years on an adaptation of Brian Aldiss\u2019 short story \u201cSuper-Toys Last All Summer Long,\u201d but died before he could realize the film. Steven Spielberg took over the project, which became A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001).\n\nHayao Miyazaki, January 5, 1941 \u2013\n\nWriter, animator, and film director Hayao Miyazaki has spent his career creating fantastic and wondrous worlds for a global audience. His films depict pastoral, sometimes utopian landscapes and celebrate nature, flight, imagination, and the simple joys of childhood.\n\nHe began his animation career in 1963 working as a concept artist, in-between artist, and storyboard artist, working his way up to directing for television. He directed his first feature film Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro, in 1979. In 1984 he founded Studio Ghibli, proceeding to produce a string of successful films such as Castle in the Sky (1986), Princess Mononoke (1997), and Spirited Away (2001).\n\nBetween 1982 and 1994, Miyazaki wrote and drew the manga Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind, an epic story set approximately one thousand years in the future, in a time when the Earth is recovering from a war that left the landscape ravaged and strangely altered. The heroine, Princess Nausica\u00e4, is a brave young woman called upon to lead her small nation. She is the first of a series of strong heroines created by Miyazaki such as Satsuki in My Neighbor Totoro (1988), Kiki in Kiki\u2019s Delivery Service (1989), Sophie in Howl\u2019s Moving Castle (2004), and others.\n\nMiyazaki garnered international acclaim with Princess Mononoke, which won the Picture of the Year Japanese Academy Award, a Nebula Award for Best Script, and numerous others. Spirited Away claimed the Best Animated Film Academy Award in the United States. In 2005 the Venice Film Festival awarded him a lifetime achievement award.\n\nOlaf Stapledon, May 10, 1886 \u2013 September 6, 1950\n\nOlaf Stapledon was many things: philosopher, educator, veteran of WWI, and pacifist activist\u2014but he is remembered most fondly as the author of ambitious, prescient, and seminal works of science fiction.\n\nA graduate of Oxford, Stapledon worked in a variety of jobs before taking up social work and tutoring for the Workers\u2019 Educational Association teaching philosophy, history, and poetry. During World War I he served as a conscientious objector with the Friends\u2019 Ambulance Unit in France and Belgium. He later attended the University of Liverpool and was awarded a PhD in Philosophy in 1925. His first novel, Last and First Men, was published in 1930 and with its success, Stapledon devoted himself to writing full time.\n\nSet two billion years in the future, Last and First Men describes an epic journey of human evolution through the rise and fall of 18 human races. In 1937, Stapledon published Star Maker\u2014a story spanning 100 billion years of human and alien evolution. Odd John (1935) concerns a precocious young boy who discovers that he is one of a number of mutant geniuses. The mutants create an isolated colony and ask only to be left alone, but find that simple request too great for their fellow humans to respect.\n\nStapledon\u2019s works collectively explore the capacity of human intelligence, compassion, and the ability to comprehend our place in the universe. He is credited with first describing phenomena that have moved from fiction to science including genetic engineering and terraforming. He frequently lectured throughout Europe, was an outspoken agnostic and advocate for peace, and was involved in the anti-apartheid movement. Stapledon Wood, near his home in Caldy, is named after him. In 2001, he was awarded the first annual Cordwainer Smith \u201cRediscovery\u201d Award."}, {"url": "http://www.midamericon.org/halloffame/", "page_content": "The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame was founded in 1996 by the Kansas City Science Fiction and Fantasy Society and the J. Wayne and Elsie M. Gunn Center for the Study of Science Fiction at the University of Kansas. Each year from 1996-2004, the Hall of Fame honored four individuals on the basis of their continued excellence and long-time contribution to the science fiction and fantasy field. The final year of indications was 2004 , when Brian Aldiss and Harry Harrison were inducted into the Hall of Fame with Mary Shelley, and E. E. \"Doc\" Smith being inducted posthumously. Following that year, inductions were made into the renamed Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame in Seattle, Washington. The new Hall of Fame emphasized only science fiction and expanded the Hall of Fame to recognize artists and motion picture professionals while reducing the emphasis on authors. Following the closing of that museum in 2011, the once again named Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame is part of the Museum of Pop Culture. Each year's inductions in the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame took place in Lawrence, Kansas during the Campbell Conference at the University of Kansas in early July.

Stan has also served as an executive producer on nearly every Marvel film & TV production, as well as cameoing in most of them. Stan Lee has co-created some of the greatest Marvel heroes that we love today, such as Spider-Man, Hulk, Iron Man and the X-Men, among many more.\n\nJ.K. Rowling was stuck waiting for a train when the inspiration for a story about a boy attending a school of wizardry came to her. Five years later, she finished Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone and the rest is history. She wrote seven books in the Harry Potter series, which were in turn made into hugely successful film series. She has also written other novels from that same universe, like Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which was also turned into a film and its sequel, The Crimes of Grindelwald is due out this year.\n\nAs well as the two amazing creators above, there will be two other inductees into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame this year. The Legend of Zelda video game series will also be inducted along with the Buffy the Vampire Slayer franchise."}, {"url": "http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/sf_hall_of_fame", "page_content": "Science Fiction Hall of Fame\n\nEntry updated 26 February 2021. Tagged: Award.\n\nA life achievement honour (see Awards) inaugurated in 1996 by the Kansas City SF and Fantasy Society and the J Wayne and Elsie M Gunn Center for the Study of Science Fiction at the University of Kansas, as the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame, with both sf and fantasy authors eligible. Initially four authors were inducted each year, two posthumously. After the 2004 inductions the Hall of Fame was transferred to the Seattle-based Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame, now a part of the EMP Museum of popular culture and (in particular) popular music. Since 2004 the four inductees have been drawn from the wider categories Film, Literature, Media and Open; also from 2004, the name changed to Science Fiction Hall of Fame and fantasy authors were for a time ineligible but were welcomed back into the fold in and after 2013, when J R R Tolkien was honoured and the initial award title Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame restored. To preserve continuity the headword of this entry retains the name applicable at the time of its creation.\n\nIn 2016 the scope was changed again to include not only creators but creations (examples of genre Cinema, Television and Games), with two examples of each being honoured. Also in this twentieth anniversary year a total of twenty additional inductees in both categories were announced, perhaps as a catching-up exercise.\n\nFor the unrelated Science Fiction Hall of Fame anthology sequence whose contents are voted by members of Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, see Nebula Anthologies.

Animation master Hayao Miyazaki will join classic painter Frank Frazetta, space opera queen Leigh Brackett, philosopher and writer Olaf Stapledon, and god-of-iconoclastic-directors Stanley Kubrick!\n\nThe inductees include:\n\nFrank Frazetta, an artist who not only spent many years in the comics trenches but also breathed new life into Robert E. Howard\u2019s Conan stories with his highly-detailed paintings.\n\nHayao Miyazaki, one of the greatest figures in animation, whose films Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind, My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki\u2019s Delivery Service only scratch the surface of a rich career.\n\nLeigh Brackett, \u201cQueen of the Space Opera\u201d had two careers: in one she wrote pulp masterpieces across genres, including Shadow Over Mars, The Long Tomorrow, and Alpha Centauri or Die! In the other, she was the screenwriter for classic films like The Big Sleep, Rio Bravo, El Dorado, and The Long Goodbye. As if all of that wasn\u2019t enough, she also wrote a draft of the screenplay for Star Wars: Episode V \u2013 The Empire Strikes Back, in which she introduced the idea that Luke Skywalker needed a twin, and it needed to be a sister.\n\nOlaf Stapledon was a prescient thinker and writer who used his work to explore the greatest possibilities of humanity. His novels, including Last and First Men, Star Maker, and Odd John track human evolution, mutation, and the limits of human intelligence. Stapledon was the first science fiction writer to deal seriously with genetic engineering and terraforming, and also toured the world advocating for peace and protesting apartheid.\n\nAnd finally, Stanley Kubrick, who is one of the greatest filmmakers in the history of the medium, with classics including 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, and The Shining.\n\nThe Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame was founded in 1996, and later relocated from the Gunn Center for the Study of Science Fiction at the University of Kansas to its permanent home at EMP in 2004. The final inductees are chosen by a panel of award-winning science fiction and fantasy authors, artists, editors, publishers, and film professionals.
