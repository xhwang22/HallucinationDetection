Since the last general election I am regularly asked, \u201cWill Fianna F\u00e1il recover?\u201d Since last month\u2019s local and European elections I have been repeatedly asked \u201cWill this Government last?\u201d. However the one question I have been asked most often by strangers in recent years is \u201cWhat is Vincent Browne really like\u201d? It is assumed that because I have been in his studio occasionally I can offer some insight to the man. What they really want to know is whether he is actually as annoyed and aggressive as his television persona suggests.\n\nI tend to answer that Vincent Browne is a nice guy and to offer the view that much of the sighing and barking at guests is put on for show. That is not to suggest that Vincent isn\u2019t a substantial broadcaster or that he doesn\u2019t sometimes get genuinely annoyed. He is a serious journalist and he is passionate on many issues especially when it comes to social inequalities. Much of his style of presenting and interviewing, however, is shaped by a shrewd recognition that in order to gather an audience a late night politics programme must above all else be entertaining.\n\nConflict makes for more dramatic television than the calm exchange of ideas. Vincent Browne's relatively successful formula on his TV3 programme is to seek to provoke his panelists to row with each other. If he can't get them to do so, then he himself will row with at least one of the guests, and if all else fails then at times he will even row with himself. It was Michael White, the political writer with the Guardian who most famously described Vincent Browne as Ireland's Jeremy Paxman. White's comparison of the two was in a particular context. He did so in a reflective piece written during a visit here to cover the 2011 election and in the context of Enda Kenny's refusal to participate in a TV3 leaders' debate because Vincent Browne had previously suggested that Kenny's media performances were so bad he should go into a quiet room with bottle of whiskey and a revolver and do the necessary.\n\nOn the week in which Paxman retires from his role presenting the BBC flagship Newsnight programme it is worth reflecting on whether that aggressive style of political interviewing actually serves the viewer and the process of democratic debate.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nIt can be argued firstly that, of itself, the more aggressive interview style typified by Paxman and Browne has proved ultimately counterproductive. When Paxman started out on his role as Newsnight inquisitor, the confrontational style of political interview was relatively new. Politicians, and especially government politicians, were still not used to being confronted directly by anyone.\n\nOver time, however, politicians came to expect a more aggressive approach and have either schooled themselves in techniques to circumvent it or simply refuse to subject themselves at all to extending interviews.\n\nNowadays most senior politicians confine themselves to set piece parliamentary contributions or short, controlled commentaries on topical events when \u2018doorsteped\u2019 by political correspondents.\n\nEven Newsnight with its substantial audience has seldom had frontline government politicians in studios in recent years. On this side of the Irish Sea those senior government politicians who occasionally do go on programmes tend to go for the shows presented by the less aggressive interviewers.\n\nIt is hard to remember the last time Vincent Browne had a Government Minister in studio. He has instead had to sate his appetite on political panels made up of lowly junior ministers \u2013 or more often aspirant junior minister anxious to prove themselves \u2013 and on Opposition or Independent politicians grateful for whatever media opportunity they can get. The Paxman/Browne style of aggressive interviewing tends to close down the opportunity for real political debate and accountability. It leads to the politicians adopting absolutist and overly defensive positions. It prevents politicians from advancing more nuanced or considered views since any such approach is likely to be pounced on as a weakening or an admission of error. The overly aggressive interview style closes off the opportunity for real communication between guest and viewer and prevents any real exchange of ideas between politicians.\n\nThere have been many times when Newsnight or Tonight with Vincent Browne have been presented by one of the substitute presenters when real discussion takes place and viewers find themselves thinking I wish it could be like this every night. It may be less entertaining but it is certainly more useful as political coverage. Of course it may not get the same audience."}, {"url": "http://www.tomasz-lis.com/biography", "page_content": "He was the driving force behind the European premiere of John Harbison's song cycle with poems by Czeslaw Milosz.

This study provided valuable insights in understanding the longer-term needs of Malaysian police officers. The findings obtained seem to stress a need to establish a systematic investigative interviewing framework whereby professionals working with suspects, victims, and witnesses are properly trained to conduct investigative interviews.\n\nOne notable strength of this study is that it was not based on samples drawn from Western, educated, industrialised, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) societies (Henrich et al. 2010), instead it was conducted in Malaysia, a Southeast Asian country with a complex multiracial Asian population. According to the Hofstede\u2019s (1980) cultural dimension theory (see also Hofstede 2011), Malaysia is considered a collectivistic society with a high power distance. Not only are people in such societies likely to accept and operate under a hierarchical structure, but they also tend to suppress their own interests and opinions to maintain social harmony. It has been put forward by Leal et al. (2018) that during an interview, individuals from collectivistic cultures tend to leave many things unsaid, assuming that the context will communicate what is implied, while on the contrary, individuals from individualistic cultures tend to be more explicit and direct in their communication. Moreover, high power distance societies tend to give less attention to rapport-building (Hofstede 1980), which may stand in the way of the current recommended best practices in investigative interviewing. As such, it is expected that the conduct of investigative interviewing in Malaysia will differ substantially from where the concepts of evidence-based investigative interviewing were derived from, that is, highly individualistic nations that sit in the lower rankings on Hofstede\u2019s power distance index. For instance, Anakwah et al. (2020) suggested that in collectivistic cultures, investigative interviewers may be required to prompt interviewees to elaborate further on the initial information they provide. The current findings should be interpreted with the understanding that the cultural setting in which an investigative interview has taken place may influence the way information is elicited.\n\nIt is worth noting at the outset of this discussions that the Royal Malaysia Police is a federal institution with a centralised, hierarchical model. The Inspector General of Police at headquarters directs operations in 14 regions across the country, but the bulk of the policing lies with the respective states and territories. Whilst there are Crime Investigation Department officers operating at different contingents, formal training is largely central.\n\nBased on the responses received, there were potential concerns about interviewing practices. Almost half of the officers indicated that they had not received formal training or additional \u2018refresher\u2019 courses, even though almost all of them conduct investigative interviews with suspects and/or children as lead interviewers. Investigative interviewing is a demanding and specialised area, requiring a broad comprehension of psychological aspects, including memory, cognitive biases, and suggestibility. Having access to up-to-date training is crucial to ensure that interviewing practices are evidence-based and reflect the current understanding of forensic interviewing. While several respondents may not yet see the value of having longer and repeated training sessions, improvement in interviewing practice may only be observed following refresher training (Rischke et al. 2011). It is acknowledged that it takes time for trainees to consolidate new information and integrate skills into practice; nevertheless, Rischke et al. (2011) asserted that training programmes that space learning, in which materials are reviewed at regular intervals, may be more effective at encouraging maximum information retention and behaviour change.\n\nMoreover, while the majority of interviewers viewed the interview process to be a very important part of the investigation process, many rated their own interviewing skills as average. The fact that both trained and untrained officers report their proficiency as average may point towards a lack of confidence in their investigative interviewing practice. It also appears that there is little evidence of routine supervision on the quality of interviews. As suspect interviews are not recorded, there is limited opportunity for interviewers to review their practice and obtain feedback. These findings serve to further highlight a deficit in investigative interviewing training, likely due to the lack of financial resources for appropriate expertise and facilities to support such activities. That being said, a small number of participants in the current sample reported an initiative in gaining more information about evidence-based investigative interviewing techniques that works. They exhibited an interest in role-playing interviews with fellow colleagues as part of the practical training process and to receive feedback.\n\nAn inadequacy of training and implementation of a structured, standardised guide may have led to some unintended consequences. It is not surprising that officers still engage in inappropriate methods of investigative interviewing, with approximately half the respondents in the current sample indicating that they have used maximisation tactics and repetitive questioning in at least one of their interviews with suspects. Similarly, a substantial percentage of participants reported using suggestive questioning in their child interviews and thought this was an effective technique. The present data reflects a pattern that is similar to that seen in other countries prior to the introduction of structured and evidence-based protocols (e.g. Baldwin 1993). For instance, a study conducted by Sumampouw et al. (2020) in Indonesia, a neighbouring country that shares many cultural similarities with Malaysia, reported that police interviewers who have not been trained in an evidence-based protocol used directive and option-posing questions extensively in child forensic interviewing. It is now established that tactics such as maximisation and situation futility are problematic in that they increase a one\u2019s susceptibility to false confessions (Kassin 2014), whereas the use of leading or suggestive questions that implies a desired response tends to yield information of poorer quality (Loftus 2005; Sharman and Powell 2012).\n\nWith regard to deception detection, more than half of the present sample were confident that they can detect deceit during a suspect interview. Interestingly, many attributed their lie detection ability to non-verbal cues, despite research to date showing that not only the relationship between non-verbal behaviour and deception is faint and unreliable, people also often overestimate their ability to detect deception (for a review, see Vrij et al. 2019). Non-verbal lie detection techniques remain popular among investigators even when there is no clear evidence that they actually work. Misjudging deception can cause innocent people to suffer unjust punishment; it is therefore important to highlight gaps in non-verbal deception research in order to ensure that practitioners are engaging in evidence-based practice, as well as to prevent miscarriages of justice. Continuous training is crucial to enhance practitioners\u2019 knowledge and understanding of investigative interviewing.\n\nBuilding and maintaining rapport during investigative interviewing is said to enhance trust, produce more cooperation, overcome resistance, which can in turn increase the amount of information provided by suspects, witnesses, or victims (Collins et al. 2002). However, the present data shows that many interviewers are unable to define critical elements of rapport clearly, which is unsurprising given that even researchers within the field have yet to achieve definitional clarity of the construct (Saywitz et al. 2015). There is therefore a need to further refine its operationalisation, and to test its effects through empirical research.\n\nIn relation to the use of props in child interviews, there has not been consistent evidence that forensic interviewing aids such as anatomical dolls improve children\u2019s ability to produce more accurate details without elevating the risk of erroneous reporting (Poole et al. 2011). In fact, guidelines in several countries (e.g., Sweden) strongly advise against the use of props or objects. However, the use of anatomical dolls appears to be prevalent in practice according to the current data. Practitioners often report specific barriers relating to forensic interviews with very young children and the necessity to modify existing protocols, which signifies a need for additional guidelines for this age group (Magnusson et al. 2020). To be able to come up with standardised guidelines that are empirically validated and fit for purpose, researchers should take into account concerns raised by investigative interviewers.\n\nA substantial percentage of respondents endorsed the video-recording of interviews with criminal suspects, and many interviewers in the current sample review their own recordings of child interviews. Electronic recording of interviews provides veridical documentation of the interview procedures and individuals\u2019 statements. This is promising, as it has been shown that video-recording may inhibit the use of certain confrontational interrogation tactics that could increase the risk of false confessions in suspects, including maximisation and minimisation (Kassin et al. 2014). Having recorded interviews also makes it possible for interviewers, supervisors, and trainers to appraise existing interview practices and facilitate professional development.\n\nWhile there are decades of scholarship by researchers, social scientists, and clinicians on best ways to elicit comprehensive and accurate information from suspects, witnesses, and victims, the transfer of knowledge to practitioners have not always been successful, evident through the failure of agencies to align their practices with evidence-based recommendations. The lack of investment in adequate and appropriate training makes it very challenging to translate robust research findings into policies and practices in the field. Expert interviewing skills can only be developed through practice and routine guidance, it is thus important for forensic interviewers to train and utilise best practice strategies consistently, enabling them to recognise instances of poor practice and work towards improving standards. According to Lamb (2016), the key players in the criminal justice system, namely the police force, social service agencies, prosecutors, defence lawyers, and judges, need to be aware that the quality of testimony is heavily depended upon the interviewers\u2019 ability to elicit information. Only when this fact is widely acknowledged that policy makers will push for improvements in the investigative interviewing process."}, {"url": "https://losspreventionmedia.com/the-evolving-techniques-of-interviewing-according-to-wicklander-zulawski/", "page_content": "During LP Magazine\u2019s fifteen-year history, loss prevention investigations have changed and transformed.

From the column:\n\n\u201cMost companies are using the WZ non-confrontational interrogation style, and more and more law enforcement agencies are beginning to shy away from the aggressive confrontational approach, preferring instead a more ethical standard of interviewing. During the next ten years, there will be a dramatic shift away from a confrontational style of interrogation. This has begun in several countries around the globe and is beginning to creep into the North American marketplace. Many companies in an effort to stay ahead of the potential for civil litigation have elected to establish strong ethical interviewing practices in their corporate culture. They begin this practice by training their investigators in the WZ non-confrontational approach to interviewing and then monitor and measure each investigator\u2019s performance against this benchmark to make sure a standardized interview method is used across the company. Some companies also use recordings of the investigators\u2019 interviews to continually monitor the treatment of associates being interviewed and to maintain a stream of feedback to the interviewer on his or her efforts.\u201d\n\nIn the column, Zulawski and Sturman also cover the advancements in telephone interviewing over the years and reveal plans for an interview simulator designed to help industry pros hone their skills.

It depends on the firm and the kind of job to decide on the best interview style for them.\n\nDifferent Types of Interviews:\n\n1. Behavioural Interviews:\n\nThe basic principle behind behavioural interviews is to assume about a candidate\u2019s future behaviour and performance based on his or her past behaviour.\n\nIt is a face to face interview; questions are asked not using words such as \u2018would\u2019 or \u2018should\u2019 but as to \u2018what you have done\u2019.\n\nFor example, a question to a candidate interviewing for a manager\u2019s job would be, \u201cHow did you solve a dispute in your former office?\u201d\n\nKey features:\n\nA behavioural interview benefits both the candidate and the interviewer. The former gets to inform about his past achievements and reveal facts about his leadership skills or working under pressure.\n\nFor the interviewer, this is a chance to know the real capabilities of the candidate because the responses of the candidate during the behavioural interview cannot be rehearsed or lied about.\n\n2. Case interviews:\n\nIn this interview, the interviewer puts before the candidate a situation to solve, generally relating to business. The candidate is expected to understand the situation and probe deep into the topic by asking relevant questions and then gather a solution.\n\nKey features:\n\nA case interview gives an understanding about the reasoning, business and numerical skills of the candidate. While for the candidate, this is the perfect occasion to reveal his expertise in problem resolving and to exhibit his market knowledge.\n\n3. Competency interviews:\n\nThis is where the candidate\u2019s competency at a job-related skill is tested.\n\nFor example, a candidate interviewed for a secretary\u2019s post may be asked to undertake a typing or a short-hand test.\n\nKey features:\n\nA competency interview helps the firm to zero in on the most skilled candidate for the job while a more proficient candidate gets to demonstrate his job skills and gets a direct chance of getting the job. Such an interview is more suitable for only junior levels and may not suit higher level hiring.\n\n4. Planned or Structured Interviews:\n\nThis is one of the most common interviews held all over the world. The same set of questions is asked of every candidate.\n\nThe questions are such that they test various skills of the candidate such as communication skills, team spirit, interpersonal skills and consensus-building.\n\nThe interviewer gives scores to each candidate depending on the answers and who gets the maximum score is the preferred candidate.\n\nKey features:\n\nIt is easier for the interviewer. The structured interview offers a structure to the process and saves time and gives a definite flow to the interview. As the questions asked in the structured interview are conventional, candidates get to practices and prepare well for the interview.\n\n5. Situational interviews:\n\nThe interviewer puts before a hypothetical situation and the candidate is expected to explain as to how he will handle the situation.\n\nFor example, a candidate applying for a sales job can be asked to demonstrate selling an item wherein the interviewer may pose as a customer. The latter may even pretend to be a difficult team member and pose before the candidate a work situation.\n\nKey features:\n\nSituational interview can replace behavioural interview if the candidate is a fresher. Such an interview can be an additional interview to enhance the process so that it is more effective. Candidates too may find such interviews useful to demonstrate their skills and talents.\n\n6. Panel interviews:\n\nAs the name suggests, a panel interview is conducted by a group of interviewers. This panel prepares a set of questions which are put forth to each applicant.\n\nThe panel members take turns in asking. The panel may also put forward some on the spot questions depending on the candidate\u2019s response.\n\nKey features:\n\nSince there is more than one interviewer, there is more accuracy and clarity. Also as most of the questions are the same, the panel gets to hear different perspectives on the same topic and this makes selection easier as comparing becomes easy and reaching a consensus becomes faster.\n\n7. Telephone interviews:\n\nAlso referred to as the pre-screening interview, this is often the first step for further interview or interviews.\n\nA telephone interview is best to know if the candidate is viable and also to know the qualifications, communications skills, experience etc of the candidate.\n\nKey features:\n\nTelephone interviews are cost-effective both for the employer and the candidate. For the firm it also saves much time as it can short list candidates for the main interview through telephone interviews. The candidate also feels at home with a telephone interview and has chances of doing well at it.\n\n8. Unstructured interviews:\n\nIn an unstructured interview, there can be planned and unplanned questions and these can vary with the candidate.\n\nQuestions are asked to gauge the candidate\u2019s understanding and capability. Some questions come up as per the candidate\u2019s response.\n\nKey features:\n\nWhile the interviewer gets to dig deeper and get more clarity about the candidate in an unstructured interview, the candidate too feels at ease as the interview tilts to an informal meeting and he gets a chance to explain and put forward details.\n\nAt the same time, since responses of different candidates are varied, there can be lack of precision and dependability.\n\n9. One-to-one interviews:\n\nAlso referred to as the traditional interview, there are only two people involved in this interview style, the candidate and the interviewer, who is mostly the HR manager or the department head.\n\nExcept for the panel interview, most of the above interviews can be a one-to-one interview.\n\nKey features:\n\nFor the firm, a one-to-one interview works well because it is easy to set up, and it helps to build a rapport with the candidate. For the latter too, such an interview is easy to handle because he only has to communicate with one interviewer, so the pressure is less.\n\nThe cons can be that since only one representative of the company takes the decision unless there are further interviews, the decision may or not work.\n\n10. Stress interviews:\n\nThis interview style was considered as a great option earlier to detect how a candidate responded to stressful situations but today, hiring processes have become more practical and sophisticated and stress interviews are rarely conducted nowadays.\n\nWhile there are many components of a stress interview, a technique used by interviewers are to ask sudden and repeated questions and not giving enough time for the candidate to think or interrupting the candidate while he is responding.\n\nKey features:\n\nThe employers believed that such kind of interview could identify worthy candidates who could perform under stressful situations or tasks. The disadvantage is that this interview style does not suit all jobs.\n\nAlso, there is also a chance that the firm may lose out on a potentially capable candidate just because he wasn\u2019t too good at responding to a mock stress. For the candidates too, such an interview tends to get too intimidating and not a great place to exhibit his talents and skills.\n\n11. Serial interviews:\n\nIn such an interview style, there are two or more interviews with the same candidate. The first interview will be the basic one to gauge if the candidate is the right one and then he will be passed on for a one-to-one interview or behavioural interview and then a task interview or a panel interview.\n\nGenerally, some firms like to conduct all the interviews in a single day while some might prefer different days for each.\n\nKey features:\n\nSuch an interview helps to get precision while hiring because the candidate who clears all levels proves his competence and is found to be efficient in all areas.\n\nThe flipside is that serial interviews can get too tiring for candidates if conducted in a single day. The other con is that too many people interviewing the same candidate means varying opinions about him which can lead to inconsistencies.\n\n12. Lunch interviews:\n\nOne or more interviewers take the candidate to a lunch to test his or her social skills, manners and to find how they fit in. Lunch interviews are mostly the second interview and very rarely the first.\n\nKey features:\n\nThe employer gets to find etiquette of the candidate and since the interview is mostly unstructured and not in an office but at a restaurant, an informal atmosphere is created which puts both the interviewer and the interviewee at ease.\n\nAlso the candidate too gets a chance to ask his questions regarding the job or the firm. The key to handle a lunch interview is to treat it as a lunch time although formally.\n\nConclusion:\n\nInterview process is important for both the applicant and the employer. Hence it is necessary that it is conducted in such a way that it suits both parties.\n\nThe hiring processes undertaken today have undergone changes and are evolving day by day, but the above job interview styles are the ones that have been practiced by most of the organizations.\n\nIt really depends on the type of job and the firm\u2019s principles as to which style suits them but at the end of the day, whatever the interview style, the best one is which will put both parties at ease and gives them a chance for a honest and transparent conversation which paves way for a long-term association."}]}
