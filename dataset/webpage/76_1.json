It was a scout from Newcastle United, and he wanted to discuss a player at the heart of the U18 team he coached at Haydon Bridge in Northumberland.\n\nShaun Elliott had been a stand-out player for some time. After an unsuccessful trial with the Magpies, the defender was on the verge of signing for Sunderland, the club he and his family supported.\n\nDavid recalled:\n\nJoe Harvey was the Newcastle manager at the time. The scout claimed he was in the manager\u2019s office, and said I was welcome to speak to him if I wanted to. They\u2019d heard Shaun was joining Sunderland and asked me if I could persuade him to sign for them instead. It was a shock because they\u2019d previously shown no interest after the trial he\u2019d had with them.\n\nDavid informed Shaun and his family, but the teenager had already made up his mind. And the rest is history, for Elliott went on to become one of the most decorated players in Sunderland\u2019s post-war history, clocking up well over 300 appearances in over a decade at Roker Park.\n\nA cultured performer, Elliott formed one half of a highly-successful central defensive partnership alongside Jeff Clarke, and was a key member of the promotion side of 1979/80.\n\nAn England B international, Elliott captained Sunderland and was devastated to miss out on the League Cup final of 1985 due to suspension.\n\n\u2018\u2019Shaun\u2019s success in the professional game was no surprise to me,\u2019\u2019 said David. \u2018\u2019I had seen what he could do and had every confidence in him.\n\n\u2018\u2019He played a junior league representative game at Corbridge with his arm in a sling and was still the best player on the field. He was a class act and was also a really good lad.\u2019\u2019\n\nHimself a lifelong Sunderland supporter, David, now 85, has fond memories of watching his former charge from the stands at Roker Park.\n\nHaydon Bridge Football Club received a modest fee for Elliott, who had impressed Sunderland\u2019s chief scout Charlie Ferguson in a number of games for the junior side.\n\nDavid still has handwritten letters from Ferguson, who he said had been full of praise for the junior set-up at Haydon Bridge.\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe added:\n\nI wrote to Sunderland after the Newcastle trial didn\u2019t work out. They sent Charlie Ferguson out to watch our games and everything worked out well in the end. Our Haydon Bridge junior team didn\u2019t win anything of note, but we had some very good players. I think more of them could have made it. A lot of players in junior and local football don\u2019t get the chance because they never get spotted, or they might not catch the eye on the day a scout is at the match. We had David and Ernie Edwards who were very talented. Shaun\u2019s brother Paul Elliott was a good player, especially if you got him fired up.\n\nShaun Elliott joined Sunderland, initially as an apprentice, in January 1974, before later turning professional. David wrote to Sunderland again in 1976 to inform them about other promising youngsters, but despite receiving another encouraging letter from Ferguson, nothing came to fruition second time around.\n\nElliott moved to Norwich in 1986, but his two seasons at Carrow Road were restricted due to injury. Spells at Blackpool and Colchester followed before returning North to turn out for Gateshead, Bishop Auckland, Whitley Bay and Durham City.\n\nDespite suffering strokes in recent years, David Tulip is still a season ticket holder at Sunderland and has a wheelchair seat in the East Stand, where he is joined by son Joseph."}, {"url": "https://www.itv.com/news/tyne-tees/2022-04-27/mystery-solved-victorian-orphan-who-asked-not-to-be-forgotten-was-us-hero", "page_content": "A Victorian orphanage choirboy, who hid a letter in a Sunderland church pew asking not to be forgotten, went on to become a US naval hero, it has been revealed.\n\nWritten in 1897 by 13-year-old William Elliott, the note was recently found by workmen renovating Sunderland\u2019s former Holy Trinity Church.\n\nThe choirboy, whose time at the nearby Sunderland Orphanage Asylum was drawing to an end, asked the finder to \u201ckeep it, in remembrance of me, W Elliott.\u201d\n\nWhen the letter was found it created headlines around the UK and William\u2019s fate was discovered by researchers who found he had gone on to have a remarkable life serving in with the US Navy in both world wars.\n\nHe was born in Sunderland on 29 October 1883 to Thomas Duncan Elliott \u2013 a chief officer in the Mercantile Marine, the forerunner of the Merchant Navy \u2013 and his wife Sarah Ann. Disaster struck in 1897 when Thomas, who was sailing on the Skyros merchant vessel, drowned in a storm.\n\nHis struggling mother put William in the orphanage when he turned eight, where he would stay for the next six years.\n\nHis sad letter said: \u201cDear friend whoever finds this paper think of William Elliott, who had two months, two weeks and four days on 11 of August 1897.\n\n\u201cWhoever you are that finds this paper, don\u2019t tear it up or throw it away, keep it in remembrance of me, W.

Just weeks away from being sent out alone into the harsh world, he left a heartfelt message to anyone who might read it.\n\nFULL OF HOPE: Young William Elliot\n\n\"I love you if you love me,\" he scrawled in pencil on the back of a chorister's order of service, asking whoever found the note to \"keep it in remembrance of me,W. Elliott.\" Then he pushed his touching message down the back of a pew in Sunderland Parish Church, where it lay hidden for 125 years until recently discovered during renovations. William's note made headlines across the UK, but the choirboy's life has remained a mystery - until now. The Daily Express, aided by ancestral researchers Findmypast, has traced the life of the fatherless boy whose message searched for love and connection at a time when his future must have seemed daunting. The lad from County Durham could hardly have imagined that he would soon move to America, wear the golden epaulettes, ceremonial sword and smart dress uniform of a US naval officer, and proudly serve in the US Navy for 42 years, becoming a Commander in the Second World War. That sad 13-year-old orphanage boy had no idea that he would go on to find love, and found a dynasty that today numbers dozens of his great-great-grandchildren. William Elliott's great-granddaughter Dawn Barrett wept when the Daily Express revealed to her his message from beyond the grave. \"It's very emotional, to hear my greatgrandfather speaking from over a century ago,\" said Dawn, 53, of Yelm, Washington. \"It brought me to tears. I had chills reading his words for the first time. \"He was a scared boy of 13, about to set out alone into the world, and wanting to be heard. I'm so glad that he found love and had a family that lives on to this day. I think he'd be happy to know that.\"\n\nWilliam's letter\n\nHer sister, Erin Barrett, 60, of Arcadia, California, said: \"I'm so happy that the note he left in church has been found. I'm shocked, ecstatic, overwhelmed. \"My grandmother Edith - William's daughter - used to tell us how she would dress up in furs as a young woman to accompany her father to the Officer's Ball. She was probably just a teenager. \"She mentioned an orphanage, but I didn't realise that it was her father who had lived there.\" Their brother, Eric Barrett, 61, of Los Angeles, California, said: \"We've been trying for years to find out more about our great-grandfather, but the trail always went cold. \"This is the first we've heard of his early life, and the first we've heard of the note he left in the church. I don't think he even mentioned it to anyone in the family.\" William was born in Sunderland on October 29, n , 1883, the son of Thomas Duncan Elliott and his wife Sarah Ann (nee Barker). Thomas was a Chief Officer in the Mercantile Marine, the forerunner of the Merchant Navy, and his family was prospering, with four young children. But on December 9, 1887, disaster struck while Thomas was sailing on the Skyros merchant vessel, carrying a cargo of wood from Sundsvall in Sweden to Dordt in Germany. Battered by a violent storm and overloaded with more lumber than she could safely carry, the ship dipped sharply into a wave and Thomas was washed overboard along with crewmateWilliamWynn. Thomas clung desperately to a rope, but his energy failed and his hands slipped away. Both men drowned.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Though it was the Victorian era, the orphanage was hardly Dickensian: it gave children a decent education, occasional outings for fun, and - since it was well-funded by sailors at the port city - taught its wards seafaring skills. But orphanage rules determined that when William turned 14 he would have to leave and make his own way in the world. Counting down the days before his imminent departure, choirboyWilliam sat in a pew at the Sunderland Parish Church and scrawled his moving note. \"Dear friend,\" he wrote, \"whoever finds this paper think of William Elliott, who had two months, two weeks and four days on 11 of August 1897. Whoever you are that finds this paper, don't tear it up or throw it away, keep it in remembrance of me, W. Elliott. I was the leading boy of this choir. I love you if you love me.\" Thanks to research by Findmypast, the Daily Express has traced William's journey since writing that touching note. He left the orphanage in October 1897 - records indicate that his conduct throughout his years there had been \"very good\" - and by 1901 was working as a clerk for a local solicitor. He even moved back in with his mother, Sarah. But then William's life took a turn he could have hardly imagined while scribbling his appeal to the future in the church pew. His sister Edith, four years his senior, had married California-born Alexander Stuart and travelled to America in 1900 to start a new life. William was 19 years old when his sister invited him to join her in the US. He left Glasgow on the steamship Columbia on March 3, 1903, giving his occupation as 'clerk'. He arrived in New York 20 days later with just $25 to his name.\n\nDISTINGUISHED CAREER: As a Navy officer in his twenties\n\nWilliam lived at 20 Evarts Street, Newport, Rhode Island - a sailing mecca. All his seafaring training at the orphanage paid off: seven months after arriving in America he enlisted in the US Navy, on October 26, 1903, just three days short of his 20th birthday. Five years later he married American Dora MacIntire, on August 3, 1908, having two children:William Jr. and Edith. Records show he was stationed at Boston, Massachusetts, where he rose to the rank of Chief Yeoman before being honourably discharged in February 1916, the year he became a US citizen. But when the First World War broke out,William wanted to play his part, and in 1918 he re-enlisted in the US Navy. Fate conspired to keep him safe, and he was assigned to work with the pay corps. By 1920 he had been promoted to the rank of Lieutenant. US files also recorded William's sister, Edith, aged 43 in 1923, accompanied by her daughter Louise, aged 21, sailing aboard the Cunard steamship Scythia from Florida to England to visit her mother in Sunderland. William travelled the world with Dora, but their happiness was cut short when she died in 1936, aged 52. She was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Washington, D.C., in a grave that he would eventually share.\n\nHis obituary in the San Diego Union reveals that he served on supply ships, submarine tenders, destroyer tenders, the repair ship Vestal, at the Cristobal submarine base in Panama, and at the Boston Navy Yard, before commanding the supply department at the Naval Training Centre in San Diego, California, where he made his home after retiring from the Navy in 1939. But when America joined the Second World War in 1941, William re-enlisted, working as a supply officer, reaching the rank of Commander before retiring again after the war. He had an active social life in retirement, belonging to officers' clubs, military associations, a Masonic Lodge and a men's club. He married again to Boston-born Mabel Frances, who died in 1962, and according to his obituary was in his eighties when he finally wed a third time to Florence, who survived him when William died at a San Diego rest home in April, 1968, aged 84. Findmypast research specialist Jen Baldwin said: \"We were all touched by William Elliott's note and were determined to discover what happened to him. This has been a very difficult do one to settle - if only he had a less common name. if he thought of I hope now that in fact, \"We successfully traced his journey from the UK to the US as well as confirming his sister's movements across the pond. He and his first wife are buried in Arlington National Cemetery, a solemn and reverent location.\" William Elliott's wish in his childhood note has been fulfilled: he has not been forgotten.\n\nWilliam's grave"}, {"url": "https://www.sunderland.ac.uk/about/staff/public-allied-health/paulelliott-1/", "page_content": "I'm a Senior Lecturer with the Paramedic Science team.

Now, it\u2019s his job to capitalize on this life-changing opportunity.\n\nThis Friday, 28 January, the Englishman makes his promotional debut against Brazilian hard-hitter Anderson \u201cBraddock\u201d Silva in a light heavyweight mixed martial arts clash at ONE: ONLY THE BRAVE, and he knows a victory over the kickboxing star could change his life.\n\nAhead of this colossal showdown at the Singapore Indoor Stadium, learn about the 29-year-old\u2019s fascinating journey to the global stage.\n\nKing Of Sports Day\n\nElliott was born and raised in the industrial town of Middlesbrough. The Brit lived with his parents \u2013 who were both in the army \u2013 and his older sister, and he thinks he had a pretty standard upbringing.\n\n\u201cI grew up in an average sort of area. It wasn\u2019t anything flashy. It was an average childhood, I guess,\u201d he says.\n\nThe military careers of his parents gave Elliott a stable base, though it was the family\u2019s penchant for sports that separated him from his peers.\n\n\u201cMy dad was a rugby player all his life, and he was a boxer in the army. My mum has been a keep-fit instructor all her life. My sister\u2019s a professional hockey player as well,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cIn school, at sports day, they would be like, \u2018This is obviously the Elliotts\u2019 day, so no one\u2019s going to win apart from them.\u2019\n\n\u201cSports were my thing. I had a lot of talent when it came to sports. I would play football, rugby, and [other] athletics.\u201d\n\nElliott excelled at soccer and played in the academy sides for local professional teams Hartlepool and Middlesbrough.\n\nHis parents supported him all the way, driving him around the country for practices and matches. By all accounts, it looked as if the Englishman was destined for a career on the pitch.\n\n\u201cI knew footballers were on a lot of money, and the fact I was very talented and my parents knew that it was good money too, they pushed me to do that,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThey would take me to all the games at all the different stadiums to play. I could see that sort of life would be very good.\u201d\n\nFollowing His Passion\n\nDespite the massive prospects Elliott had in soccer, something dragged him away.\n\n\u201cI stumbled across kickboxing when I was 15 and it was on Eurosport, in the big Japanese arenas, with fighters like Remi Bonjasky and Jerome Le Banner fighting in the tournaments,\u201d he recalls.\n\n\u201cI was instantly hooked. I went to my first class when I was 15. I started picking up things really quickly.\u201d\n\nElliott tried to juggle martial arts and soccer, but his motivation quickly waned for the latter.\n\nHe was on the cusp of a pro career, but he wanted to follow his passion. Even though his parents didn\u2019t quite understand his choice, they let him follow his own path.\n\n\u201cWhen I started doing kickboxing, it took over my life. I just enjoyed it that much,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI started doing judo along with it, and then just kind of slowly stopped being as interested in football. Even though I\u2019d still go to the academy practices and the games, I ended up getting released because I wasn\u2019t anywhere near as interested as I used to be.\n\n\u201cMy parents got a bit annoyed at me because it was the year where they decide if you get a scholarship. It was my decision. They could have forced me to change that and they didn\u2019t, so I was thankful for that because I don\u2019t regret anything I\u2019ve done in my life so far.\u201d\n\nA Stern Word To Relight The Fire\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a constant upward trajectory for Elliott in his new endeavor, however.\n\nHe experienced an impressive run in the amateur kickboxing ranks and then moved to mixed martial arts training when he struggled to get matched, hoping to find more opportunities in the new code.\n\nBut everything came to a complete halt when he decided to retrain for a new career in instrumentation, and it took a stern word from an old friend to bring him back to martial arts.\n\n\u201cI stepped away from the combat side of things and studied for three years. All I would do is go off to college, and then go to the gym and lift weights,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAn older gentleman called Paul that used to go to all my fights was training in the gym and there\u2019s this trolley next to him with medical supplies. We found out he had stomach cancer, unfortunately.\n\n\u201cI always talked to him, explaining to him what I study, and then he said the doctors told him that he had six weeks to live. He said to me, raising his voice as well, \u2018What on earth are you doing? Stop lifting all the weights. Go back to your fighting, something that you\u2019re good at.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe fact that he said that to me and in the situation that he was in, it meant a lot to him. It was a kick in the [butt], and the light bulb came on. I put myself back to work in the situation where I should have been all along.\n\n\u201cThat was probably November time. So I changed the whole training plan, put a new fight plan together, and then I fought that January. That was 2017 and since then, I\u2019ve not been beaten.\u201d\n\nPersevering To Reach The Top\n\nElliott has been on a tear since then. He made his amateur MMA debut in 2017, smashed through the regional circuit, and then moved swiftly into the pro ranks, where he has compiled a perfect 4-0 record with four first-round knockouts.\n\n\u201cThe King Of The North\u201d was making a name for himself domestically and preparing to go international when a series of injuries sidelined him. First, a torn meniscus, followed by a pectoral tear, and then a blown ACL.\n\nIt was a tough time, but two surgeries later and back to full fitness, he got the call from ONE that made all the adversity seem worthwhile.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest \u2013 it\u2019s not just physically challenging, it\u2019s very mentally challenging as well. It\u2019s probably taken me the longest in terms of trying to get back to full mental strength. The physical comes first, but the mental side of things takes a lot longer, surprisingly,\u201d he offers.\n\n\u201cFor a while when I first came back, I wasn\u2019t doing anywhere near as well as I should have been doing because of the ACL. Part of me was thinking, \u2018Maybe this isn\u2019t going to be the fairy-tale ending.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut as time went on, I persevered and continued. Gradually, I started to get a bit better and more confident. And now, it\u2019d be just over two years and I\u2019m at a point where I\u2019m the strongest I\u2019ve ever been, the fastest I\u2019ve ever been, and, skill-wise, I\u2019m the best I\u2019ve ever been.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re injured and you haven\u2019t fought in a while, and then ONE reaches out to you, let\u2019s just say I was extremely happy. I may have shed a tear or two. I think things happen for a reason. I\u2019m in touching distance of getting [to my ONE debut], and I feel like maybe this is all a blessing in disguise. Maybe this was meant to be.\u201d\n\nElliott is now just days away from his debut in The Home of Martial Arts, and it\u2019s all coming together. The Englishman has big aspirations for himself among the elite in the light heavyweight and heavyweight divisions, and he can\u2019t wait to showcase what he\u2019s all about in \u201cThe Lion City.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just want to try and take it all in, live in the moment and experience it firsthand,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAnd when it comes to the fight, don\u2019t give up and keep punching and kicking until he stops.\u201d\n\nRead more: \u2018Braddock\u2019 Expects Fireworks Against Fellow Slugger Paul Elliott"}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/julie-elliott", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nJulie Elliott was born on 29 July, 1963 in Sunderland District, United Kingdom, is a British Labour politician.

The reason he was back at the Bridge was to talk about two months in particular.\n\nOne is the current month of October \u2013 or more specifically its role as Black History Month. The other was the last month of September but way back 30 years ago, and the ramifications of what happened to Paul during one game in Liverpool in 1992.\n\n\n\nPaul\u2019s signing for Chelsea from the Scottish top division two summers earlier was a big deal for the club at the time. It felt a step-up from the average level of recruitment at the Bridge in that era, the capturing of a highly regarded and coveted central defender, with Serie A experience and the potential to take the team up to a new level.\n\n\n\nIt went well from the start \u2013 with Paul becoming the first black player to score on his Chelsea debut and later when he was handed the captain\u2019s armband on occasions, the first player of colour to skipper the side.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it was to screech to a halt with a career-ending challenge on him, a moment he discusses here among many other subjects including his highly successful post-playing projects (he is chair of the FA\u2019s Inclusion Advisory Board and his work in this field led him to become the first player from the Premier League era to be awarded a CBE), in this special interview as we mark Black History Month, which is where the talking begins\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul, what is your opinion on Black History Month as a concept?\n\n\n\nI subscribe to celebration and I can understand the empathy and the rationale behind Black History Month. I\u2019ve been having conversations about celebrating the Windrush anniversary, which is in June, and I think this kind of area should be all round because this is the journey to where we are now but that said, Black History Month does give a focal point which is always important.\n\n\n\nI understand why some people ask why we just celebrate this during Black History Month, but I think it focuses minds to the significance and the importance, and across football black history is celebrated in Black History Month and sometimes the messaging could be eroded if it was over the year.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresumably there are younger generations of fans who may not be as familiar with the earlier black history in football as the older fans\u2026\n\n\n\nThat's a reason why the celebration is always important, not just to remember but to articulate the journey and the challenges. There's so many shoulders that people have stood on, to create where we are now.\n\n\n\nIt's important younger generations understand that journey. Players like myself stood on the shoulders of Cyrille Regis, Laurie Cunningham, Brendon Batson, Garth Crooks. I was the next generation that followed on the back of that, and people need to understand that because there were challenging times, on the pitch especially.\n\nIn some ways you were part of a second generation of black players at Chelsea, in that Paul Canoville, Keith Jones and Keith Dublin suffered regular abuse from a significant proportion of the support, but later Clive Wilson was more accepted from the start of his time at the club, as then were players like Ken Monkou and you, enjoying an instantly good rapport.\n\n\n\nI think a lot of it was because I\u2019d had a good career. Chelsea was a huge move for me but I was at Celtic before, in Italy before then, Aston Villa before then in the First Division, Luton Town in the First Division. I started at Charlton and I remember playing as a 16-year-old kid at Stamford Bridge, and it wasn't for the faint-hearted. Those are experiences that shaped me, particularly mentally to give you that character.\n\n\n\nI've seen so many players over my time who have been traumatised mentally as a consequence of those behaviours and that's been my sadness, because many of them were extremely talented players that could really forge a career in the game, but couldn't cope mentally. That's not a sign of weakness. I feel sorry for them not having the tools and the support mechanisms to cope with that, because it does affect so many people in different ways.\n\n\n\nIssues of race or discrimination are actually a societal problem, so until you resolve society, you can't resolve football, but what you can do is what a lot of clubs, stakeholders, the law, are now doing which is addressing people's behaviours inside stadiums, because it's like my workplace and everybody has that fundamental right to work in a racism-free environment, and footballers are no different.\n\n\n\nWhat we've got today are 21st Century challenges and the great thing is we've got a generation of players who are exceedingly powerful, and are now using their power to great effect. We've got a great England manager in Gareth Southgate who has been the advocate and the lead for the FA and the England players in anti-discrimination, and I think the biggest single change now has been the influence of the players on those issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Chelsea having a reputation at the time, was that ever in your mind before deciding to come here?\n\n\n\nYeah it was, but that didn't stop me because I played in Scotland for two years, I was in Italy for two years before then. Scotland was a very challenging environment, the same issues I got down south, and I had it in Italy as well, players just being abused for the colour of their skin.\n\n\n\nI saw it as a great challenge, but I had that previous experience and also living through it as a family. My family was the Windrush generation and we grew up with \u2018no Irish, no blacks, no dogs\u2019. My mum always embedded into my mindset that you've got to work twice as hard, be twice as good to have an opportunity because that was her attitude to life.\n\n\n\nSo I\u2019ve gone through my whole life with that in mind and I just wanted to prove people wrong, break down barriers and lead by the quality of my football and my leadership and my character. I was told years after when I finished the game that I was Chelsea\u2019s first black captain, the first black captain in the Premier League, the first black English player to play in Italy, but I wasn't aware at the time.\n\nWhen you came to Chelsea in 1991 you were a sought-after player and you started well with a goal in each of your first two home games. By the end of the season you were Chelsea Player of the Year. There is an interview you gave shortly after that award to the club\u2019s newspaper at the time, Onside, where you were asked about the standard of the top flight and you replied you thought it would be harder.\n\n\n\nYeah, that's right but remember I had played in other top-quality environments as well. There was a step up from Celtic but it wasn't as I thought it would be and I could cope, maybe because for a centre-half I was mobile and I was quick on the ground and I could play a bit. You had to concentrate more but it was a natural adjustment.\n\n\n\nI virtually moved every two years because I think my characteristics were sought after. My first game in Italy was against AC Milan and look at the team sheet - Van Basten, Rijkaard, Gullit, Baresi, Maldini, Costacurta, Evani. My second game, Napoli, Maradona.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is quite prescient in the interview is your answer to the question will the Premier League (starting the following season) lead to a rise in standards. You were hopeful and in favour of the new structure.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s grown through the roof and it's been unbelievable. Now you've got to be an athlete to play in the Premier League, with the pace of the game now, but what I love as well is you see players who are not the quickest across the ground but their range of technique, spatial awareness and vision means they are already two steps ahead. There were some players like that in my day - Kenny Dalglish was exactly the same, he knew what he was doing with the ball before he received it.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou were also asked if racism in English football had declined since you had been away. Back then you could see matters moving in the right direction.\n\n\n\nI've always wanted to speak positively about it and some of the big pieces of work I've done regarding equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI), Chelsea have been very supportive of under the former regime, and what\u2019s really pleased me is with the new owners, the whole EDI culture is very central to their thinking and that\u2019s a credit to their values.\n\n\n\nEverything in an organisation, from your staffing to your boards, councils, committees, on the pitch, off the pitch, EDI has to be embedded in the organisational DNA.\n\n\n\nIt's not just about the social and the human value, but also the economic imperative of diversity because clubs are global brands. The Premier League is shown in 195 countries, 4.6 billion people annually watch the game. Staggering!\n\n\n\nWe're on a journey now with equality, diversity and inclusion and that's been my work on the field as a player and in doing what I've done in the 30 years since. I co-founded Kick It Out in 1992 with Lord Ouseley and the PFA and I've seen videos of me back then with a curly perm and a moustache and I think look what has happened to me 30 years later! It's been a hell of a journey.\n\n\n\nIn stadiums, people\u2019s behaviour, the diversity, it's better now than it's ever been, but with social media, that's a huge challenge but one I think people are addressing. The government's addressing, it, football is addressing it, and I'm part of that, with my work with the Online Safety Bill. It\u2019s an ongoing process, a very complex process, but I think there is an aspiration to get to the destination. with the Online Safety Bill.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo although it is thought generally there has been a decline in behaviour inside grounds since lockdown, you don\u2019t see racism in stadiums worsening?\n\n\n\nI think there's a lot of big issues of racism at grassroots but at matches in the modern game there is a lot of self-policing. People can take photos of people now, take photos of seats. You can go online and instantly send your report in to Kick It Out or the club and it's going to be investigated. There is a kind of zero tolerance. I think that's genuinely there.\n\nWere you surprised the Chelsea fans voted you Player of the Year in your first season?\n\n\n\nYeah, I was, I\u2019d had a good season, but I was over the moon. I remember the night, it was at a club in Vauxhall and I remember it was a fabulous night and I was so proud.\n\n\n\nIt was a kind of continuity on the back of Celtic [where Paul had been Scotland\u2019s Players\u2019 Player of the Year the previous season] and I was at that right age of 27, 28 and it felt great because the supporters\u2019 opinions of you are very important. It's hard for players sometimes when they don't have that support. When you feel the supporters can't take to you, there\u2019s nothing worse psychologically. It doesn't matter how much your players value you, you want the respect of the people who watch too.\n\n\n\nIt's just amazing, everywhere I've gone in the world I've met Chelsea fans who want to talk to me. It's unbelievable that people don't forget you and you also meet the next generation. It means a lot. I'm very lucky.\n\n\n\n\n\nShould we have won the FA Cup in that first year, going out to Second Division side Sunderland in the quarter-finals with Norwich lined up in the semis?\n\n\n\nI remember the replay in Sunderland after we conceded a late equaliser here, that was a tough game. That was my biggest disappointment because that was the best opportunity we had to get to the final and it wasn't a great Liverpool side that beat Sunderland in it.\n\n\n\n\n\nLook out for part two of the interview in which Paul discusses his playing-career-ending injury, the court case that followed, what he hopes for from the projects he now devotes his energies to and his admiration for Raheem Sterling."}, {"url": "https://www.julie4sunderland.co.uk/legacy/2017/11/07/tribute_paid_to/", "page_content": "It was so very sad to hear that Councillor Paul Watson, Leader of Sunderland City Council, passed away this week after bravely fighting cancer for well over a year.\n\nMy thoughts are with Paul\u2019s family at this very sad time.\n\nPaul, who was born in Pennywell in 1954, worked as a shipwright in Sunderland\u2019s shipyards until they slipped into decline and, like many others, he was made redundant.\n\nHe then studied law in his early 40s at Teesside University before becoming a councillor in 1997, and taking over the top job in 2008.\n\nHe also served as chair of the Association of North East Councils and helped found the Key Cities Group -; which represents 26 mid-sized cities across the country and speaks up for them with Whitehall.\n\n\u201cPaul has led the Council through a period of enormous regeneration, with many things now coming to fruition before our eyes,\u201d said Julie.\n\n\u201cKeel Square, the New Wear Crossing, the redevelopment of the Vaux site and the International Advanced Manufacturing Park are all legacies of his strong leadership of the Council.\u201c"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/julie.elliott/2289575", "page_content": "Julie Elliott Edit Profile\n\nJulie Elliott is a British Labour Party politician, who has been the Member of Parliament for Sunderland Central since 2010 and was re-elected in 2015 with 20,959 votes.\n\nBackground Elliott was born in Whitburn in Sunderland and educated at Seaham Northlea Comprehensive, and gained a degree in Government and Public Policy at Newcastle Polytechnic.\n\nEducation Northumbria University.\n\nCareer Elliott joined the Labour Party in 1984, and has held office at branch, constituency and regional level since then She is Parliamentary Private Secretary to Caroline Flint and in 2013 she was appointed as Shadow Minister for Climate Change.\n\nPolitics Since her election in 2010, Elliott has served on the European Scrutiny Committee and the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee and is Company-Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Primary Care and Public Health."}, {"url": "http://www.julie4sunderland.co.uk/about-julie/", "page_content": "About Julie\n\nJulie\u2019s Story:\n\nI was born in Whitburn, Sunderland, in 1963 and have lived in and around the city all my life, now residing in Roker.

Word Count: 754\n\nGeorge Paul Elliott, the son of Paul R. Elliott and Nita Gregory, was born in a small town in Indiana and raised on a Southern California farm. Elliott was educated at the University of California at Berkeley, where he received his B.A. in 1939 and his M.A. in 1941. That same year, he married Mary Emma Jeffries; they had one daughter, Nora Catherine. In 1947, he began his academic career with a teaching position at St. Mary\u2019s University in California. In 1955, he joined the faculty of Cornell University, at which time he began work on the anthology Fifteen Modern American Poets. In 1957, he moved to Barnard College, where he received a Hudson Review Fellowship that allowed him to concentrate more fully on his creative interests. One year later he published his first novel, Parktilden Village.\n\nIn 1960, he was offered a position with the Writers\u2019 Workshop at the University of Iowa. While there, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1962, he moved to the University of California at Berkeley. That same year he received a D. H. Lawrence Fellowship to the University of New Mexico. In 1963, Elliott accepted a position at Syracuse University, where he remained until his death in 1980. While at Syracuse he served as director of the graduate writing program.\n\nElliott is one of the most diverse American writers, known for working in almost every imaginable genre, including science fiction, fantasy, psychological realism, satire, and romance. Much of his work first appeared in such periodicals as The American Scholar, The Nation, Atlantic Monthly, and the Times Literary Supplement. Many of his lectures were collected in A Piece of Lettuce and Conversions. These essays, which range in subject from religion to politics, usually have their foundation in personal experience.\n\nElliott\u2019s poetry, like much of his prose, is concerned with issues of self-knowledge and the way in which humans can better know themselves within a moral framework. Elliott labeled such moral awareness \u201cbeauty,\u201d and his verse attempts to draw readers into such experiences. His prose, on the other hand, exposes the moral ugliness of human behavior and the way humankind has become disconnected from the beautiful by emphasizing the tangible over the intangible. Writing during the age of nuclear discoveries, Elliott in his fiction was concerned with how empirical knowledge has become the only acceptable way of knowing. Because such knowledge lacks a moral dimension, it is often grotesque and dangerous. In much of Elliott\u2019s fiction, then, the only way characters can truly know beauty is to peel away their layers of social and cultural being, exposing an innate spirituality that elevates their moral sense and leads them toward avenues of self-knowledge. Such is the concern of David Knudsen, for example, a work about the effects of nuclear warfare on individuals. This somewhat disturbing novel helped carve a place for Elliott among contemporary novelists.\n\nNone of Elliott\u2019s novels, however, has met with the same critical acclaim as his first collection of short stories, Among the Dangs, which was nominated for a National Book Award in 1962 and exemplified his moral vision. The title work, \u201cAmong the Dangs,\u201d which is set in the remote Andes, relays the story of an anthropology professor who spends several years studying the bizarre, ritualistic behavior of the Dang tribe. At first, the professor is motivated by academic instincts, but once he becomes a member of the tribe, he begins a harrowing journey into his own moral and spiritual consciousness. In an ironic twist he reiterates biblical prophecies while in a drug-induced trance, and in so doing is forced to question his own disbelief, a process that becomes an avenue for self-discovery.\n\nNot all of Elliott\u2019s characters are able to achieve such knowledge. In \u201cThe NRACP,\u201d Elliott\u2019s most popular story from The Dangs, the main character, a writer, is swept up in a system that resembles that of National-Socialist Germany. Despite his insistence that he is \u201cassisting at the birth of a new age,\u201d he becomes automated, and his inability to act on his own conscience leaves him emotionally and spiritually bankrupt.\n\nMany of Elliott\u2019s characters find themselves in similar moral dilemmas, and as a result of the craft with which they are presented the reader cannot help but identify with the characters. Elliott warned his readers not to accept blindly what life seems to offer but instead to question and to let a moral consciousness be the guide. Whether Elliott\u2019s characters succeed in this or not depends on how willing they are to know themselves."}, {"url": "https://www.liquisearch.com/st_aidans_catholic_school/a_brief_history", "page_content": "A Brief History\n\nSt Aidan\u2019s school can trace its roots back to the \u2018Roaring Twenties.\u2019\n\nCanon Smith, then parish priest of St Mary\u2019s in Sunderland, founded St Mary\u2019s Grammar School at Bede Towers in 1928/29. The building in Burdon Road is a villa in Italianate style originally the home of mayor John Moore. Records show the first schoolmaster, Mr J Goundry, was a layman.\n\nThe Jesuits took over the running of the school in 1935 \u2013 two years after taking on Ashbrooke Hall as a retreat for local Catholic men and renaming it Corby Hall.\n\nAshbrooke Hall, in Ashbrooke Road, had originally been built for glassmaker James Hartley in 1864 by architect Thomas Moore, whose masterpiece was Monkwearmouth Station.\n\nIt later became the home of the Short shipbuilding family, before being taken over by the Jesuits. The original Superior of the teaching staff, and of Corby Hall Retreat House, was Father SJ Whittaker.\n\nThe school transferred from Bede Towers to The Briery in Ashbrooke Road in 1936 \u2013 previously the home of Mr Craven of Craven Ropery. There was a pedestrian tunnel under the road to gardens opposite which the school later used as a sports ground\n\nThe name was then changed to Corby Hall, to avoid confusion with another school.\n\nFurther confusion arose, however, between Corby Hall and Corby Hall School, so that \u201can interchange of letters was necessary after each of the postman\u2019s rounds,\u201d according to Jesuit archives.\n\nJust a year later, in 1937, the name of the school was changed yet again, to Sunderland Catholic College, and in 1939 it became Corby School.\n\nThe dedication of both Corby School and Corby Hall recalled, according to the Jesuit archives, the historical association of Sunderland with Father Ralph Corby who was captured by Puritans in 1644 and hanged.\n\nThe name Corby School lasted until 1948, when the Jesuits left and handed running of the school over to the Christian Brothers of Ireland. It was renamed as St Aidans RC Grammar School and remained a grammar school until 1975, when a new school block and gymnasium building was completed on the opposite side of Ashbrooke Road and linked to the old school site by a tunnel. At this date the school was reclassified as a comprehensive school. St Aidans retained the Briery building for use by the sixth form.\n\nAshbrooke House was used as a retreat by the Brothers for many years, but was sold off in the 1970s and demolished to make way for flats. St Aidans school uniform is black blazer with school crest, black trousers, white shirt, yellow and black tie. St Aidans pupils have the option of wearing a grey school sweatshirt with their blazers."}, {"url": "https://biblehub.com/topical/naves/p/paul--educated_at_jerusalem_in_the_school_of_gamaliel.htm", "page_content": "Nave's Topical Index\n\nNave's Topical Index\n\nI am truly a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as you all are this day.\n\nActs 26:4\n\nMy manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among my own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;\n\nNave's Topical Index\n\nLibrary\n\nSt. Paul's Wish to be Accursed from Christ.\n\n... of Cilicia; but sent to Jerusalem for an ... destined chieftain among Christians, is\n\neducated among Pharisees ...

As a result of sex abuse he claims to have suffered at the hands of two members of the Christian Brothers at St. Aidan's Roman Catholic Grammar School in northeast England, Turner was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, and has since been paid \u00a317,000 (about $25,000).\n\nThe Congregation of Christian Brothers settled the lawsuit just before the case was to go to trial, where the order would've been forced to disclose whether other students had also been abused, and how the Congregation handled those complaints.\n\nThe Congregation is refusing to admit liability, stating it's unable to admit or deny the allegations, and that it would be \"quite impossible\" to investigate the charges long after the the alleged abusers' death.\n\nThe Christian Brothers have been dogged by multiple sex abuse scandals worldwide, suffering a sharp drop in members over the last few decades. In addition to the United Kingdom, lawsuits have been filed against the Congregation in Ireland, Australia, Canada and the United States.\n\nIn Australia, at least three Christian Brothers were convicted of sex crimes that took place in the 1970s at two schools in Ballarat, Victoria. In spite of the convictions, two of the brothers were transferred to another campus, where they continued to abuse boys.\n\nHundreds of former students of Mt. Cashel Orphanage in Newfoundland, Canada claim to have been abused by members of the Congregation, which ended up paying $23 million in 1993 in a legal settlement.\n\nAmong the American cases of abuse includes that of Br. Edward Chrysostom Courtney at Brother Rice High School in Chicago, whose sexual abuse of students led to a payout of $16.5 million.\n\nAllegations of abuse in Ireland against the Christian Brothers have been the most severe, including charges of rape, torture and bribing of thousands of victims to keep them silent. A commission tasked with investigating the claims found that the Christian Brothers had been charged with more cases of abuse than all other male religious orders combined. The Congregation has since paid about \u00a3145 million ($211 million) in reparations in Ireland alone.\n\nTurner, now 66, claims the abuse at St. Aidan's in Sunderland began at age 12. The abuse was \"so common,\" he said, students thought of it as normal.\n\nAccording to Turner, one of his teachers, Br. Norman Williams, would frequently call students to his desk to read aloud, and while they did so, he would run his hand up their legs and fondle them.\n\nStudents would sit in dread of being the next one called by the teacher. \"Ironically, you'd be sitting there saying a 'Hail Mary' hoping that the prayer would mean that you weren't the next one to be called up.\"\n\nAt least one other witness has corroborated Turner's claims. Ray Stewart, a student in his class, claims to have been abused by Williams in 1961, and saw him \"feeling up other boys in my class in exactly the same way.\"\n\nThe headmaster of St. Aidan's, Br. Dennis O'Brien, was allegedly also involved in the abuse. Turner recounts one time being called into O'Brien's office, who said to him, \"I need to check that you are still a good boy.\" O'Brien then asked him to take down his trousers, and proceeded to molest him. This reportedly took place four times, before the headmaster was transferred to another school.\n\nAfter six years of abuse, Turner left the school and tried to shut it out from his mind, but lost his Catholic faith in the process. \"I stopped going to Church,\" he said. \"I lost my faith.\"\n\nEven so, Turner went on to become a teacher at a Catholic school, hoping to set a different example. \"I wanted to be a teacher, I wanted to teach in Catholic schools,\" he explained, \"but I wanted to be a teacher who did things differently, who treated their pupils with respect.\"\n\nWatch the full documentary here.\n\nHave a news tip?
