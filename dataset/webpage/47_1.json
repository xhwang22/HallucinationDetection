{"Irena Sendler was part of the Polish Underground's \u017begota resistance organization.": [{"url": "https://www.biography.com/activist/irena-sendler", "page_content": "(1910-2008)\n\nWho Was Irena Sendler?\n\nWhen the Nazis invaded in 1939, Irena Sendler was a social worker and so had access to the Warsaw Ghetto, where hundreds of thousands of Jews were imprisoned. As a member of \u017begota (aka Konrad \u017begota Committee, the Council to Aid Jews), she helped rescue 2,500 Jewish children from the ghetto. For her courageous actions during the Holocaust, in 1965, Israel\u2019s Yad Vashem honored her as \u201cRighteous Among the Nations.\u201d Sendler died in Warsaw in 2008.\n\nEarly Life\n\nSendler was born Irena Krzy\u017canowska on February 15, 1910, in Otwock, Poland. Her parents were members of the Polish Socialist Party, and her father, Stanis\u0142aw Krzy\u017canowski was a medical doctor who died of typhus when Sendler was a child. In 1931 Sendler married Mieczys\u0142aw Sendler, and the couple moved to Warsaw before the outbreak of World War II.\n\nWarsaw Ghetto\n\nIn Warsaw, Sendler became a social worker, overseeing the city\u2019s \u201ccanteens,\u201d which provided assistance to people in need. When the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939, Sendler and her colleagues also used the canteens to provide medicine, clothing and other necessities to the city\u2019s persecuted Jewish population.\n\nIn 1940, the Nazis forced Warsaw\u2019s more than 400,000 Jewish residents into a small locked ghetto area, where thousands died every month from disease and starvation. As a social worker, Sendler was able to enter the ghetto regularly to help the residents and soon joined \u017begota, the Council to Aid Jews. Putting themselves at great risk, she and about two dozen of her colleagues set out to save as many Jewish children as possible from death in the ghetto or deportation to concentration camps.\n\n\u017begota began by saving Jewish orphans. They had several ways of smuggling them out of the ghetto: Some were carried out in caskets or potato sacks; others left in ambulances or snuck out through underground tunnels. Still others entered the Jewish side of a Catholic church that straddled the ghetto boundary and left on the other side with new identities. Sendler then helped place the children at convents or with non-Jewish families.\n\nAs the situation became more dire for the ghetto\u2019s inhabitants, Sendler went beyond rescuing orphans and began asking parents to let her try to get their children to safety. Although she couldn\u2019t guarantee the children\u2019s survival, she could tell parents that their children would at least have a chance. Sendler kept detailed records and lists of the children she helped buried in a jar. Her plan was to reunite the rescued children and their parents after the war. However, most of the parents did not survive.\n\nOn October 20, 1943, the Nazis arrested Sendler and sent her to Pawiak Prison. There they tortured her, trying to get her to reveal the names of her associates. She refused and was sentenced to death. However, \u017begota members bribed the prison guards, and Sendler was released in February 1944.\n\nSendler continued her work until the war ended, by which time she and her colleagues had rescued some 2,500 children. It has been estimated that Sendler personally saved about 400.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nAfter the war, Sendler\u2019s first marriage ended in divorce. In 1947 she married Stefan Zgrzembski, with whom she had three children, daughter Janka, and sons Andrzej (who died in infancy) and Adam. After the death of Zgrzembski, Sendler remarried her first husband, Mieczys\u0142aw Sendler, but their reunion didn't last and they again divorced.\n\nHonors and Awards\n\nIn 1965, Yad Vashem, Israel\u2019s Holocaust memorial organization, named Sendler as Righteous Among the Nations for her work saving Jewish children. In 2003, Poland honored her with its Order of the White Eagle. In 2008, Sendler was nominated for (but did not win) a Nobel Peace Prize. The story of her life was also captured in a 2009 TV movie The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler, which starred Anna Paquin in the title role.\n\nDeath\n\nSendler died on May 12, 2008, in Warsaw, Poland, at the age of 98.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nBirth Year: 1910\n\nBirth date: February 15, 1910\n\nBirth City: Otwock\n\nBirth Country: Poland\n\nGender: Female\n\nBest Known For: Irena Sendler was a Polish social worker who, during World War II, helped to rescue 2,500 Jewish children from the Warsaw Ghetto, and placed them in convents or with non-Jewish families.\n\nAstrological Sign: Aquarius\n\nDeath Year: 2008\n\nDeath date: May 12, 2008\n\nDeath City: Warsaw\n\nDeath Country: Poland\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION"}, {"url": "https://www.holocaustmatters.org/irena-sendler/", "page_content": "Irena Sendler was a Polish social worker, nurse, and director of the children\u2019s department for the Council for Aid to Jews, Zegota (an underground resistance group during WWII). She has been recognized by Yad Vashem as a Righteous Among the Nations, and awarded the Jan Karski for Valor and Courage.\n\nTo say the least, Irena Sendler is an inspiring humanitarian with a fascinating life story; her incredible courage and bravery saving the lives of many Jewish people throughout WWII. In this piece, we will be exploring the life of this influential figure, and her part to play during the Holocaust.\n\nFor more information on the Holocaust, and other influential figures throughout it, please click here.\n\nEarly Life\n\nBorn in Warsaw on the 15th of February 1910, Irena Sendler (or Irena Kryzyzanowski at the time) was the daughter of Janina and Dr Stanislaw Kryzyzanowski. Although born in Warsaw, Irena grew up in a town near the city called Otwock, and was an only child.\n\nHer father (Dr Stanislaw Kryzyzanowski) died from typhus, which he contracted whilst treating patients, when Irena was only seven years old. Stanislaw, although dying when Irena was very young, had a profound impact on the life values she carried throughout her life, claiming that through her father \u201cI was taught that if you see a person drowning, you must jump into the water to save them, whether you can swim or not.\u201d\n\nAfter Stanislaw\u2019s death, many leaders in the Jewish community helped to fund Irena\u2019s education, which lead her to study at Warsaw University in Polish Literature.\n\nDuring her time at university, Irena disagreed with the ghetto bench system that had already been established in some of the universities prior to the war. In reaction to this, she vandalised her grade card and was consequently put on a three year-long suspension from the university.\n\nThis was not the last of Irena\u2019s protests against Jewish discrimination, but rather the beginning to her humanitarian career, fighting for the lives of Jewish people throughout the Holocaust.\n\nHow Did Irena Sendler Help During the War?\n\nEven in the very beginnings of WWII, as the Germans invaded Irena\u2019s birthplace of Warsaw, she started to help the city\u2019s Jews, providing them with food and water. However, once the ghetto was built within the city this cut off Irena\u2019s access to those who needed her aid. She then started to plan out another way in which to help.\n\nOnce the Warsaw Ghetto was established in the year 1940, Irena then started to smuggle out orphaned children. She used her status as a social worker, in addition to documentation from an employee at the Contagious Disease (who also became a part of the underground group Zegota) to gain access into the Warsaw Ghetto, and access to the orphaned children who lived in it.\n\nAfter the underground Polish resistance group for the Provisional Committee for Aid to Jews (Zegota) was established in 1942. Irena was soon appointed as head of its children\u2019s division. During her position with Zegota, Irena and her team helped to rescue around 2,500 Jewish children from the Warsaw Ghetto. There were four main ways in which Irena\u2019s team would smuggle out children from the ghetto, these being as follows:\n\nSmuggled through an old courthouse next to the ghetto.\n\nEscape through underground passages such as the sewer.\n\nHide in a luggage bag and then carried out by a trolley.\n\nVia ambulance; hidden under stretchers, faking illness or genuinely being ill.\n\nThose rescued were sent to numerous different orphanages and religious institutions that took in vulnerable children. Irena used her contacts with these places to smuggle the children in under false names. Some of the main places these children were smuggled into included the Rodzina Marii Orphanage, and religious institutions in and around Chotomow, Turkowice and Lublin.\n\nWhy Was Irena Sendler Imprisoned?\n\nOn the 20th of October 1943, Irena was arrested, and sent to Piawiak prison. During her time in imprisonment she was tortured for information on the other members of Zegota, and Irena fed the interrogators false information. Irena was then sentenced to death, however did not fulfil this sentence as her fellow Zegota members bribed workers in the prison to let her escape.\n\nThe day after Irena\u2019s escape, Nazi officials interestingly announced that she had been shot, with posters with this false news dotted all around Warsaw. Irena was in hiding throughout the rest of the war, and once over, started to try and connect the children she had saved with their parents. Unfortunately, nearly all of these parents had been killed during the holocaust.\n\nLater Life\n\nWhen the war was over, Irena carried on her career as a social worker. She received numerous awards for her outstanding bravery and courage; these included the previously mentioned Yad Vashem\u2019s Righteous Among the Nations, and Jan Karski\u2019s Valor and Courage. In addition to these, Irena was also awarded Poland\u2019s Order of the White Eagle, and has been a nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nIrena then spent the latter part of her life cared for in Warsaw by a woman called Elzbieta Ficowska. Eizbieta was one of the children (six months old at the time) Irena had smuggled out of city\u2019s ghetto.\n\nIrena has remarked on her actions during the war, stating that \u201cWe who were rescuing children re not some kind of heroes. That term irritates me greatly. The opposite is true \u2013 I continue to have qualms of conscience that I did so little. I could have done more. This regret will follow me to my death.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.ushmm.org/information/press/in-memoriam/irena-sendler-1910-2008", "page_content": "The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum mourns the passing of Irena Sendler, a Polish social worker who helped smuggle more than 2,500 Jewish children out of the Warsaw ghetto during the Holocaust.\n\nAs head of the children\u2019s section of \u017begota, the Polish underground Council for Aid to Jews, Irena (\u201cJolonta\u201d) Sendler regularly used her position as a social worker to enter the Warsaw ghetto and help smuggle children out. Hiding them in orphanages, convents, schools, hospitals, and private homes, she provided each child with a new identity, carefully recording in code their original names and placements so that surviving relatives could find them after the war.\n\nArrested and tortured by the Gestapo (the German secret state police) in the fall of 1943, she was sentenced to death, but \u017begota managed to rescue her before she could be executed. She assumed a new identity and continued her work for \u017begota.\n\nYad Vashem recognized Ms. Sendler with the Righteous Among the Nations medal in 1965. She died in Warsaw, Poland, on May 12, 2008, following a long illness."}, {"url": "https://1943.pl/en/artykul/about-irena-sendler/", "page_content": "The war was the most difficult lesson for humanity, when for such elementary norms as compassion for victims, aid for the needy or respect \u2013 regardless of their origin, nationality, or creed \u2013 the dignity of the other person, there was not enough space. All the rules of coexistence were deformed, the hierarchy of values was definitively lost, and the order of the \u201eold world\u201d had fallen apart. The sense of fear that existed determined all behaviours and attitudes. People had to face choices between alternatives, each carrying a decision that exceeded the scope of feeling and imagination. Continuous disintegration and atomisation of the society led to a breakdown of pre-war bonds. All activities of the pauperised, poor, and humiliated population focused on survival, which resulted in the numbing of sensitivity to the external. The tragedy was made worse by indifference to the suffering of others. In a situation of constant, everyday danger, the vast majority of Poles was unable to act for the sake of an individual, not to mention the collective which \u2013 according to the fascist \u201cnew order\u201d \u2013 was excluded and doomed to extermination. The Holocaust revealed the true face of a human being.\n\nIf we were to assess the courage of some and the indifference of others with the same measure, who would be the first in line? Is it the minority ready to sacrifice their lives, or is it the silent majority \u2013 on the other side? Looking from the perspective of the time that passed away, probably the former \u2013 the Righteous Among the Nations. Irena Sendler, aka \u201cJolanta\u201d defined the state of affairs at the time very clearly, saying: \u201dHuman nature commanded us not to remain passive in the face of the greatest barbarism towards our Jewish fellow citizens\u201d [Sendlerowa, 2007, pp. 97 \u2013 98]\n\nIrena Sendler was born twice. The first one was recorded in the memory of loved ones as well as church and partitionist administration files. For the second time \u2013 during the war. She had already been sentenced earlier. Most probably the sentence was passed by her fellow countryman. A Pole. He denounced her. Maybe he knew that her life in occupied Warsaw was taking place on two levels \u2013 the official one: employee of the Social Welfare Department of the Management Board of the city of Warsaw and the unofficial one: underground activities? Maybe because he knew that she was helping someone? Or because of regret that she was able to wage civilian resistance? Whatever the reasons, their effect was one: on 18 October, 1943, the Gestapo began its implementation. She was arrested in the middle of the night, then imprisoned and tortured in Pawiak for weeks. Neither the one who reported nor those who received it could know who she was or what role played in the underground world. [A\u017bIH, 301/6313] Probably everything was \u201conly\u201d in the sphere of \u2018suspicions\u2019. Perhaps because during the search of her apartment neither the list of children whom she had been helping, nor the funds intended for them, nor the fake Kennkarten fell into in the hands of the Germans. She was aware of the threat if her previous actions were to be revealed. \u201eI was silent,\u201d she said years later. \u201eI would have rather died than exposed our activities. What did my life mean compared to the lives of so many people I could have exposed to death?\u201d [Miszkowska, 2018, p. 180]\n\nFrom mid-October 1943, round-ups increased in Warsaw. And there was terror. Murders were the norm. [Doma\u0144ska, 1988, p. 37] Everyone was in danger of death, especially prisoners \u2013 outlaws. Each day could be their last. At the Pawiak prison, the \u201eprocedure\u201d was simple. Gestapo men would enter the cell: \u201cWe stood in a row and they pointed which ones were to step forward.\u201d [Miszkowska, 2018, p. 186] On Saturday, 13 October, such an order was issued to \u201eJolanta\u201d. The prisoners from Pawiak were transported to the Gestapo headquarters in Szucha Alley: \u201eI was aware that this was my last path.\u201d [I. Sendlerowa, 2007, pp. 105 \u2013 106] She was expecting to be shot. But her life was bought out by \u201e\u017begota\u201d[A. Bikont, 2017, pp. 225 \u2013 227]. She was reborn. As Klara D\u0105browska, she helped Jewish children with equal dedication, risk, and devotion.\n\nShe lived in two worlds. From the very beginning. Even before the ghetto became a closed district, during the \u201cGrossaktion\u201d, when the Uprising was taking place in the ghetto, or later when the Germans formed KL Warschau concentration camp on its ruins. Until the very end \u2013 Warsaw\u2019s liberation from German occupation. She had always known many people from the Jewish community and was just as well-known herself. Therefore, she had to be present in the centre of the ghetto life, individually and voluntarily, before the walls were erected. When they were erected, thanks to the support of the head of Warsaw\u2019s Sanitary Unit, she was also present in the \u201eclosed district\u201d. She submitted reports to the Nazi overseers on the so-called \u201csanitary actions,\u201d and in them \u201eshocking pictures of tuberculosis and other infectious diseases\u201e: \u201eIt gave hope,\u201d she reported, \u201ethat the German controllers would bypass these addresses.\u201d [I. Sendlerowa, 2007, pp. 96 \u2013 97. Also: A\u017bIH, 301/6466]\n\nShe also had to be present in \u201c\u017begota\u201d. \u201cThe Children\u2019s Department, led by Irena Sendler (\u201eJolanta\u201d), tried to solve the difficult problem of orphans or Jewish children separated from their parents \u2013 as it was written in the \u201cReport on activities of the Council for Aid to Jews by the Government Plenipotentiary for the Country for the period of December 1942 \u2013 October 1943\u201d \u2013 placing them individually with Polish families or collectively in various shelters, hospitals, orphanages, monasteries, care and educational institutions.\u201e[W. Bartoszweski, 2007, p. 27. Also: Report \u2026, 2007, 701] Irena Sendlerowa was present \u201eon both sides of the wall\u201d. In the ghetto: \u201cI put on an armband with the Star of David\u201d. To express solidarity with the oppressed people. She provided food, money, and documents. She led children out of the ghetto. On the Aryan side \u2013 for the need of the hour \u2013 she participated in falsifying documentation, co-creating biographies of fictional characters, or forging signatures. [R. Sakowska, 1993, pp. 94-103; R.C. Lukas, 2018, 206] There was one truth in these two worlds: selfless help.\n\nMaybe because she was the daughter of a doctor and socialist, she would say: \u201cI grew up among these people. I was familiar with the customs and misery of Jewish homes.\u201d [Sendlerowa, 2007, pp. 97-98] Maybe under the influence of the daily reproduced image of the Warsaw ghetto: \u201cBarely moving skeletons in rags lying under the walls of buildings, skeletons of mothers with skeletons of children in their arms, powerless shadows of human figures. Resignation and hopelessness appeared on the sad faces of these children\u201d [M. Kalwary, 2014] Maybe it was a response to the call of ghetto doctors who \u201ewrote with pain about hundreds of small children affected by various plagues and diseases, wrapped in rags, ragged creatures that the world has not seen before?\u201d Maybe it was a reaction to Janusz Korczak\u2019s \u201edeath march\u201d with children to the Umschlagplatz? [R. Sakowska, 1993, p. 95] Perhaps because she saw with her own eyes how the Gestapo officer in Pawiak Square \u201eshoots the little one straight in the back\u201e? [A. Miszkowska, 2018, 184 \u2013 185] Was it the reason why she constantly brought aid? Or was it enough to just be human?\n\nDuring the war, there were people who had such a driving force, thanks to which others had a chance to survive. To be human again. Irena Sendler was such a figure. She would always emphasise that only thanks to working with \u201c\u017begota\u201d people, cooperation with Polish families, churches, or convents \u2013 it was possible to help the most needy, abandoned, and defenceless. The children. How many of them survived? As \u201emany\u201d as five hundred or \u201eonly\u201d two and a half thousand? [T. Prekerowa, 1982, pp. 213-217. Also: K. Dzi\u0119cio\u0142owska, 2018] Considering only numbers, one could conclude that many survived. Or that only few managed to survive. However, there was a human life behind every digit. [H. Grubowska, 2014, pp. 21-62]\n\nTime did not relieve Jolanta\u2019s children from the power of fear \u2013 both at the individual and collective level. For those who remained silent for decades and sometimes all their lives, the medicine was opening up. In a sense, the memory of the tragic past had become their joint, collective soul, a substitute for other sources of bonds destroyed in the times of the Holocaust. It is a kind of therapy \u2013 a bridge connecting the generation of those who survived the Holocaust with those who wish to learn the truth about the not-so-past past: their own, their loved ones and strangers, all coming from one nation. Paraphrasing the title of Hanna Krall\u2019s book, it is worth to shield the flame, but not from God but for the last of the Children of the Holocaust. And listen to their voice.\n\nThe Senate resolution of 2007 says: \u201eServing the values that motivated Irena Sendler and other people to save the lives of others while risking their own lives is still a role model.\u201d [Ten jest z ojczyzny mojej, 2007, p. 850] The preservation of the memory of the heroic deeds of these people is another step towards filling the \u201eanniversary\u201d niche. And a hint that it is not necessarily becoming to put figures from the circles of the \u201ccursed soldiers\u201d in the pantheon of Polish national heroes, when so many others have remained anonymous. Fortunately, some \u2013 the rescuers and the rescued \u2013 come out of the shadows. And they regain their identity.\n\nPawe\u0142 Wieczorek \u2013 Doctor of humanities.

Assisted by some two dozen other \u017begota members, Sendler saved 2,500 Jewish children by smuggling them out of the Warsaw Ghetto, providing them with false documents, and sheltering them in individual and group children's homes outside the Ghetto. Film, based on her story is made (filmed in Riga)\n\nSendler was born as Irena Krzyzanowska on 15 February 1910 in Warsaw. Her father, Stanislaw Krzyzanowski, was a physician. Sendler sympathised with Jews from childhood. Her father died in February 1917 of typhus contracted while treating patients his colleagues refused to treat. Many of those patients were Jews. After his death, Jewish community leaders offered to pay for Sendler's education. She opposed the ghetto-bench system that existed at some prewar Polish universities and as a result was suspended from Warsaw University for three years.\n\nDuring the German occupation of Poland, Sendler lived in Warsaw (prior to that, she had lived in Otwock and Tarczyn while working for urban Social Welfare departments). As early as 1939, when the Germans invaded Poland, she began aiding Jews. She and her helpers created over 3,000 false documents to help Jewish families, prior to joining the organized \u017begota resistance and the children's division. Helping Jews was very risky\u2014in German-occupied Poland, all household members risked death if they were found to be hiding Jews, a more severe punishment than in other occupied European countries.\n\nShe cooperated with others in Warsaw's Municipal Social Services department, and the RGO (Central Welfare Council), a Polish relief organization that was tolerated under German supervision. She and her co-workers organized the smuggling of Jewish children out of the Ghetto. Under the pretext of conducting inspections of sanitary conditions during a typhus outbreak, Sendler and her co-workers visited the Ghetto and smuggled out babies and small children in ambulances and trams, sometimes disguising them as packages. She also used the old courthouse at the edge of the Warsaw Ghetto (still standing) as one of the main routes for smuggling out children.In August 1943, \u017begota (the Council to Aid Jews) nominated her (by her cover name Jolanta) to head its children's section. As an employee of the Social Welfare Department, she had a special permit to enter the Warsaw Ghetto to check for signs of typhus, something the Nazis feared would spread beyond the Ghetto.During these visits, she wore a Star of David as a sign of solidarity with the Jewish people and so as not to call attention to herself.\n\nThe children were placed with Polish families, the Warsaw orphanage of the Sisters of the Family of Mary, or Roman Catholic convents such as the Little Sister Servants of the Blessed Virgin Mary Conceived Immaculate at Turkowice and Chotom\u00f3w. Sendler cooperated very closely with social worker and catholic nun, mother provincial of Franciscan Sisters of the Family of Mary - Matylda Getter. She rescued between 250-550 Jewish children in different education and care facilities for children in Anin, Bia\u0142o\u0142\u0119ka, Chotom\u00f3w, Mi\u0119dzylesie, P\u0142udy, Sejny, Vilnius and others. Some children were smuggled to priests in parish rectories. She and her co-workers buried lists of the hidden children in jars in order to keep track of their original and new identities. \u017begota assured the children that, when the war was over, they would be returned to Jewish relatives.\n\nIn 1943, Sendler was arrested by the Gestapo, severely tortured, and sentenced to death. \u017begota saved her by bribing German guards on the way to her execution. She was listed on public bulletin boards as among those executed. For the remainder of the war, she lived in hiding, but continued her work for the Jewish children. After the war, she and her co-workers gathered together all of their records with the names and locations of the hidden Jewish children and gave them to their Zegota colleague Adolf Berman and his employees at the Central Committee of Polish Jews. However, almost all of their parents had been killed at the Treblinka extermination camp or had otherwise gone missing.\n\nAfter the war and the Soviet takeover of Poland, Irena Sendler was persecuted by the communist Polish state authorities for her relations with the Polish government in exile and with the Home Army. During this period she miscarried her second child.\n\nIn 1965, Sendler was recognized by Yad Vashem as one of the Righteous among the Nations. She also was awarded the Commander's Cross by the Israeli Institute. Only in that year did the Polish communist government allow her to travel abroad, to receive the award in Israel.\n\nIn 2003, Pope John Paul II sent Sendler a personal letter praising her wartime efforts. On 10 October 2003 she received the Order of the White Eagle, Poland's highest civilian decoration, and the Jan Karski Award \"For Courage and Heart,\" given by the American Center of Polish Culture in Washington, D.C.. She was also awarded the Commander's Cross with Star of the Order of Polonia Restituta (November 7, 2001).\n\nOn 14 March 2007, Sendler was honored by Poland's Senate. At age 97, she was unable to leave her nursing home to receive the honor, but she sent a statement through El\u017cbieta Ficowska, whom Sendler had helped to save as an infant. Polish President Lech Kaczy\u0144ski stated she \"can justly be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize\" (though nominations are supposed to be kept secret). On 11 April 2007, she received the Order of the Smile as the oldest recipient of the award.\n\nIn May 2009, Irena Sendler was posthumously granted the Audrey Hepburn Humanitarian Award. The award, named in honor of the late actress and UNICEF ambassador, is presented to persons and organizations recognised for helping children. In its citation, the Audrey Hepburn Foundation recalled Irena Sendler's heroic efforts that saved two thousand five hundred Jewish children during the German occupation of Poland in World War II.\n\nSendler was the last survivor of the Children's Section of the \u017begota Council to Assist Jews, which she had headed from August 1943 until the end of the war.\n\nAmerican filmmaker Mary Skinner began working on a historical documentary film based on Irena Sendler's memoir as told to Anna Mieszkowska in 2003. Irena Sendler, In the Name of Their Mothersfeatures the last long interviews Irena Sendler gave before she died. Also featured are three of Sendler's co-workers and several of the Jewish children they saved. Filmed in Poland and the United States with Polish cinematographers Andrzej Wolf and Slawomir Grunberg, the film uses evocative location footage of Irena Sendler's wartime apartment, \u017begota headquarters, Gestapo headquarters and the Pawiak Prison along with rare footage of the city during the German occupation to vividly re-create the events of Sendler's life. This is the first historical documentary made outside Poland to record the true story of Irena Sendler and the daring conspiracy of women who worked with her to save the children of the Warsaw ghetto. Skinner recorded over 70 hours of interview material for the film and spent seven years consulting archives, historical experts, and eyewitnesses in the United States and Poland to uncover many unknown details about their operation. The film made its broadcast premiere on PBS in May 2011 in honor of Holocaust Remembrance Day, through KQED Presents. The DVD is distributed through PBS.\n\nIn 1999, Kansas students produced a play based on research into Irena Sendler's life story titled Life in a Jar. It has since been adapted to television as The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler.\n\nSendler's story was largely unknown to the world until the students developed The Irena Sendler Project, producing their performance Life in a Jar. This student-produced drama has now been performed over 285 times all across the United States, in Canada and in Poland. Sendler's message of love and respect has grown through the performances, over 1,500 media stories, a student-developed website with 30,000,000 hits, a national teaching award in Poland and the United States, and an educational foundation, the Lowell Milken Education Center, to make Sendler\u2019s story known to the world.\n\nLife in a Jar continues to travel around the country sharing Irena's story.\n\nIrena Sendler died in Warsaw on May 12, 2008.\n\nWikipedia\n\nwww.irenasendler.com"}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/sendler-irenadeg", "page_content": "SENDLER, IRENA\u00b0\n\nSENDLER, IRENA \u00b0 (1910\u2013 ), head of the children's section of the Council for Aid to Jews (codenamed Zegota), a Polish underground organization created in the latter part of 1942 and which operated primarily in the Warsaw area; and Righteous Among the Nations. In the early days of the German occupation, Sendler worked to alleviate the suffering of many of her prewar Jewish friends and acquaintances. As a social worker for the Social Welfare Department of the Warsaw municipality, she carried a special permit allowing her to visit the ghetto area, ostensibly for the purpose of combating contagious diseases. This afforded her ample opportunity to learn of the terrible conditions inside the ghetto and try to alleviate the suffering of the people there with additional clothing, medicine, and money. In the summer of 1942, Irena Sendler was invited to join Zegota, which was then in the stages of formation. Readily consenting to this, she had already assembled a group of people dedicated to her charitable work, including her companion Irena Schulz, and she developed a widespread network of contacts inside and outside the ghetto. Under the codename Jolanta, with the help of her coworkers, she arranged for Jewish children to be smuggled out of the ghetto and for sheltering them in secure places either with non-Jewish families or in religious institutions. \"I myself had eight or ten flats where Jews were hiding under my care,\" Irena proudly recalled. The sheltering families received financial support from Zegota for their additional expenses. In October 1943, she was betrayed and arrested by the Gestapo, taken to the infamous Pawiak prison, and brutally tortured. Failing to elicit information from her, her inquisitors condemned her to be shot. However, unbeknownst to her, the Jewish underground operating in the Warsaw region had managed to contact and bribe one of the Gestapo agents, and on the day of her execution she was freed, although she was officially listed among those executed. Forced to stay out of sight for the remainder of the German occupation, Irena carried out her humanitarian activities from her hiding place. Irena Sendler explained that the motivation for her humanitarian work came from lessons learned at home. Her father was a physician, and most of his patients were poor Jews. \"I grew up among these people. All my life, I had Jewish friends.\" She then added, \"My family taught me that what matters is whether people are honest or dishonest, not what religion they belong to.\" In 1965, Irena Sendler was awarded the title of Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem.\n\nbibliography:\n\nYad Vashem Archives m31\u2013153; J.

Irena Passed on on 12 May 2008. She was was a Polish humanitarian, social worker, and nurse.\n\nIrena served in the Polish Underground Resistance during World War II in German-occupied Warsaw. From October 1943 she was head of the children\u2019s section of \u017begota, the Polish Council to Aid Jews. In the article are the top ten outstanding facts about Irena Sendler.\n\n1. She engaged in conspirational activities during World War II\n\nDuring the war, Irena pursued conspiratorial activities, such as rescuing Jews, primarily as part of the network of workers and volunteers from that department, mostly women.\n\nSendler participated, with dozens of others, in smuggling Jewish children out of the Warsaw Ghetto and then providing them with false identity documents and shelter with willing Polish families or in orphanages and other care facilities, including Catholic nun convents, saving those children from the Holocaust.\n\n2. Bribery bought back her life after she was sentenced to death\n\nTOP TEN FASCINATING FACTS ABOUT ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKI\n\nThe German occupiers suspected Sendler\u2019s involvement in the Polish Underground and in October 1943 she was arrested by the Gestapo. However, she managed to hide the list of the names and locations of the rescued Jewish children.\n\nShe prevented this information from falling into the hands of the Gestapo. Withstanding torture and imprisonment, Sendler never revealed anything about her work or the location of the saved children.\n\nShe was sentenced to death but narrowly escaped on the day of her scheduled execution, after \u017begota bribed German officials to obtain her release. \u017begota was the successor institution to the Provisional Committee to Aid Jews and was established specifically to save Jews.\n\nPoland was the only country in German-occupied Europe where such a government-established and -supported underground organization existed. So it\u2019s to Zegota that Sendler was saved from the Gestapo.\n\n3. Sendler was recognized as Righteous Among the Nations\n\nRighteous Among the Nations is an honorific used by the State of Israel to describe non-Jews who risked their lives during the Holocaust to save Jews from extermination by the Nazis for altruistic reasons.\n\nThe term originates with the concept of \u201crighteous gentiles\u201d, a term used in rabbinic Judaism to refer to non-Jews, called ger toshav, who abide by the Seven Laws of Noah. Why was Sendler recognized as Righteous Among Nations by Israel?\n\nInitially in the 1930s, Sendler conducted her social work as one of the activists connected to the Free Polish University. Also, in post-war communist Poland, Sendler continued her social activism but also pursued a government career. This is the main reason why she was recognized as Righteous Among Nations.\n\n4. Sendler received many decorations throughout her life\n\nAmong the many decorations, Sendler received was the Gold Cross of Merit granted her in 1946 for the saving of Jews. The Cross of Merit is a Polish civil state decoration established on 23 June 1923, to recognize services to the state.\n\nAt the time of its establishment in 1923, the Cross of Merit was the highest civilian award in Poland. It was awarded to citizens who went beyond the call of duty in their work for the country and society as a whole. May be awarded twice in each grade to the same person.\n\nThe other decoration she received was the Order of the White Eagle. The Order of the White Eagle is Poland\u2019s highest order awarded to both civilians and the military for their merits. It was officially instituted on 1 November 1705 by king Augustus II the Strong of Poland and the elector of Saxony.\n\nIt was bestowed on eight of his closest diplomatic and political supporters. It is one of the oldest distinctions in the world still in use. The decoration was awarded late in Sendler\u2019s life for her wartime humanitarian efforts.\n\n5. She grew up in a Jewish community\n\nSendler was born in Warsaw, to Stanis\u0142aw Henryk Krzy\u017canowski, a physician, and his wife, Janina Karolina. She was baptized Irena Stanis\u0142awa on 2 February 1917 in Otwock. She initially grew up in Otwock, a town about 15 miles southeast of Warsaw, where there was a Jewish community.\n\n6. Why was Sendler devoted to helping the Jews soo much?\n\nHer father, Stanis\u0142aw Henryk Krzy\u017canowski, was a humanitarian who treated the very poor, including Jews, free of charge. Unfortunately, Stanislaw died in February 1917 from typhus contracted by his patients.\n\nAfter his death, the Jewish community offered financial help for the widow and her daughter, though Janina Krzy\u017canowska declined their assistance. This is the main reason why she wanted to pay back for the kindness the Jews gave their helpless single-parent family when the father died.\n\n7. Sendler started her activism while at the University\n\nFrom 1927, Sendler studied law for two years and then Polish literature at the University of Warsaw, interrupting her studies for several years from 1932 to 1937. She opposed the ghetto benches system practiced in the 1930s at many Polish institutions of higher learning.\n\nDue to her opposition to ghetto benches, she defaced the \u201cnon-Jewish\u201d identification on her grade card. She reported having suffered from academic disciplinary measures because of her activities and reputation as a communist and Philo-Semite.\n\n8. Sendler once worked in a legal counseling and social help clinic\n\nIn the legal counseling and social help clinic, the Section for Mother and Child Assistance at the Citizen Committee Sendle helped the Unemployed. She published two pieces in 1934, both concerned with the situation of children born out of wedlock and their mothers.\n\nShe worked mostly in the field, crisscrossing Warsaw\u2019s impoverished neighborhoods, and her clients were helpless, socially disadvantaged women. In 1935, the government abolished the section. Many of its members became employees of the City of Warsaw, including Sendler in the Department of Social Welfare and Public Health.\n\n9. Sendler divorced Mieczys\u0142aw Sendler twice\n\nIn 1931 Sendler married Mieczys\u0142aw Sendler. He was mobilized for war, captured as a soldier in September 1939, and remained in a German prisoner of war camp until 1945. They divorced in 1947.\n\nIrena then married Stefan Zgrzembski, a Jewish friend and wartime companion. They were blessed with three children, Janina, Andrzej (who died in infancy), and Adam (who died of heart failure in 1999).\n\nIn 1957 Zgrzembski left the family; he died in 1961 and Irena remarried her first husband, Mieczys\u0142aw Sendler. Ten years later they divorced again.\n\n10. American filmmaker Mary Skinner filmed a documentary about Irena Sendler\n\nThe film documentary is called Irena Sendler. The documentary was filmed In the Name of Their Mothers. It features the last interviews Sendler gave before her death.\n\nThe film made its national U.S. broadcast premiere through KQED Presents on PBS in May 2011 in honor of Holocaust Remembrance Day and went on to receive several awards, including the 2012 Gracie Award for outstanding public television documentaries."}, {"url": "https://www.jewsandpolesdatabase.org/2021/01/23/do-not-minimize-zegota-a-polish-underground-organization-irena-sendler-analyzed-but-with-uncorrected-anti-polonism-mayer/", "page_content": "Life in a Jar: The Irena Sendler Project: A Novel, by Jack Mayer. 2010. Long Trail Press, Middlebury, Vermont\n\nIrena Sendler, Zegota, and Her Rescue of 2,500 Jewish Children. Polish AND Jewish Collaborators\n\nAs a long-term student of Polish-Jewish relations and of the Holocaust, I found this book to be right on the mark on most issues, with a few exceptions. This work juxtaposes the situation in Poland during WWII with the decades-later research by American high school students. The title of the book refers to a jar, hidden by Irena Sendler, containing the names of the transferred Jewish children, their parents, and Polish benefactors\u2013a very risky piece of property under the German occupation, but also a necessity for effecting child-parent reunions after the war.\n\nMayer provides good coverage of the 1939 German-Soviet conquest of Poland, the compulsory ghettoization of the Polish Jews under the Nazis, the deportations to the death camps, the German-imposed death penalty (often against entire families) for aid to Jews (p. 22, 207, 245, 339,\u2014worth belaboring in light of the denials of Jan T. Gross), the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, the legendary work of Jan Karski, Irena Sendler\u2019s spiriting-away of Jewish children from the Warsaw Ghetto and her numerous close calls, Irena Sendler falling into the hands of the Gestapo (followed by torture, impending execution, and bribe-release), etc.\n\nUNCORRECTED ANTIPOLISH NOTIONS\n\nThe author alludes to certain Polonophobic shibboleths that the high school students had picked up, but unfortunately does not correct them. These misconceptions include the premise that most Poles were indifferent or hostile to persecuted Jews (p. 8), that Polish Blue police (POLICJA GRANATOWA) drank anti-Semitism with their mother\u2019s milk (p. 123), that Irena Sendler was not recognized more in Poland, in part, because Poles did not want to confront their past anti-Semitism (p. 268), and that MAUS (with its absurd portrayal of Poles as well-fed pigs under the German occupation) is worth including in the bibliography (p. 378).\n\nIn all fairness to Mayer, he does mention some Poles who account for the relatively low-level of Polish attention to Sendler by the fact that Poles want to move on from the horrors of the war and German occupation. (p. 263). [Millions of gentile Poles were also murdered by the Germans during WWII, and hardly any Polish family did not lose at least one member\u2013a fact not mentioned anywhere in this book.]\n\nZEGOTA: A SOPHISTICATED, POLISH UNDERGROUND ORGANIZATION\n\nThe Polish Underground organization ZEGOTA, named after no existing person, was the code name of a one-of-a-kind organization in all of German-occupied Europe that gave organized help to Jews. Some Jewish authors have tried to belittle ZEGOTA as the work of a handful of idealists acting on their own. Mayer realizes that ZEGOTA was actually a relatively large, full-fledged organization within the Polish Underground, endorsed and financed by the Polish Government in Exile in London. Moreover, ZEGOTA had chapters not only in Warsaw but also in other major Polish cities. (p. 196).\n\nALL NATIONALITIES HAD BETRAYERS\n\nGerman informants were a constant danger. Mayer realizes the fact that both Poles and Jews could denounce fugitive Jews and their Polish rescuers, often as the outcome of being broken by torments and privations, threatened with death, spared, bribed, and then recruited by the Gestapo. (p. 130). Mayer also quotes Irena Sendler: \u201c\u2018The mathematics of rescue was also severe. To save one Jewish child, ten Poles and two Jews had to risk death. To betray that same child and the family that had hid him required only one informer, or, worse still, one blackmailer.'\u201d (p. 338).\n\nHIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS APPRECIATE IRENA SENDLER\n\nThis book contains moving chapters on the high school students and their research on Irena Sendler, their excitement when they established correspondence with her, their many performances of the LIFE IN A JAR play, help from people such as Bozenna Gilbride, their visits to Poland and the many historical sites, their thrilling meeting with Irene Sendler, her eventual death at the age of 98, and the lives of the now-adult Sendler admirers (as of 2010).\n\nResources are included for further study.

From October, 1943 she was head of the children\u2019s section of Zegota, the Polish council to aid Jewish people. Her nick name was \u2018Jolanta.\u2019\n\nWho Was this Great Lady?\n\nIrena Sendler was a Polish woman, who along with her trusted network, is credited to have saved the lives of 2,500 Jewish children during the Holocaust. She was working as a nurse and a social worker; she was very active in the Polish underground\u2014The Polish resistance movement during World War II\u2014in German occupied Warsaw.\n\nAs a young woman she was deeply influenced by her father who was a doctor and also one of the first Polish socialists. She grew up watching her father tend to poor patients and this instilled in her a desire to help the needy and the under privileged in whatever ways she could.\n\nWhen the Germans invaded Warsaw in 1939 and started inflicting unspeakable tortures on the Jewish population, she made it her priority to help out Jewish people by offering them food and shelter. She collaborated with some of her trusted allies and used her position to obtain thousands of false documents to help the Jewish families.\n\nAs a nurse and a social worker, Irena was in charge of the children\u2019s division of Zegota, a Polish underground group to assist Jewish people. In this position, she worked tirelessly with her helpers to smuggle around 2,500 children out of the Warsaw Ghetto and provided them safe shelter outside the ghetto.\n\nEarly Life\n\nIrena was born as Irena Krzyzanowska on the 15th of February, 1910 in Otwock, near Warsaw, to Stanislaw Krzyzanowski and his wife Janina. She was her parents\u2019 the only child. Her father was a physician and also one of the first Polish socialists. She was greatly influenced by his selfless service to his patients, mostly poor and Jewish. He did not charge them for his services. Her father contracted typhus while treating Jewish patients the other doctors refused to treat and died in February, 1917.\n\nFrom 1927 Sendler studied law for two years and then Polish literature at the University of Warsaw, interrupting her studied for several years from 1932 to 1937. She became associated with social and educational units of the Free Polish University, where she met and was influenced by activists.\n\nOne was Wszechnica Sendler, who belonged to a group of social workers led by Professor Helena Radlinska; a dozen or more women from that circle would later engage in rescuing Jewish people from her social work on site interviews.\n\nSendler recalled many cases of extreme poverty that she encountered among the Jewish population of Warsaw. She married Mieczyslaw Sendler in 1931. He was mobilized for war, captured as a soldier in September, 1939 and remained in a German prisoner of war camp until 1945; they divorced in 1947. She then married Stefan Zgrzembski, a Jewish friend and wartime companion, with whom he had three children. In 1957 he left the family; he died in 1961 and Irena remarried her first husband, Mieczyslaw Sendler. Ten years later they divorced again.\n\nHer Career\n\nDuring the late 1930s Irena Sendler moved to Warsaw and started working for municipal social welfare departments. The Germans invaded Poland in 1939 and the Nazis started brutalizing the citizens, especially the Jewish population.\n\nShe was working as a Senior Administrator in the Warsaw social welfare department at that time. The department operated canteens all over the city and provided meals and other necessities to the orphans, elderly and the poor.\n\nIrena Sendler realized the situation of the Jewsish people under the Nazis and helped them by registering them under fictitious Christian names and reported the Jewish families as being afflicted with highly infectious diseases in order to prevent inspections. She was taking a huge a huge risk by helping the Jewish people, as giving any kind of assistance to them in German\u2014occupied Poland was punishable by death. Yet she courageously continued her services.\n\nTo the Jewish population, the Zegota, an underground organization also known as the Council to Aid Jewish People, selected her. To head its Jewish children\u2019s section in 1943 during this time, she was assigned the name of Jolanta, her nickname, in order to protect her real identity.\n\nAs an employee of the social welfare department, she had a special permit to enter the Warsaw ghetto, an area into which hundreds of thousands of Jewish people were herded and imprisoned.\n\nInside the ghetto, the Jewish people lived in highly deplorable conditions and were most likely to be killed b the Nazis in the near future. Sendler, along with some other like-minded and courageous women, started smuggling out Jewish children from the ghetto. The babies and children were hidden in gunny bags, buried inside loads of goods, or sometimes even placed in coffins to hide them from the Nazis and transported to safer places.\n\nSendler participated, with dozens of others, in smuggling Jewish children out of the Warsaw ghetto and then providing them with false identity documents and sheltering them with willing Polish families or in orphanages and other care facilities, including Catholic nun convents, saving those children from the Holocaust.\n\nSendler ensured that the children were provided with false identities and placed them in non-Jewish homes. She also documented the children\u2019s original names and new identities in coded form and hid the records by placing them inside jars and burying them under trees. She was a very courageous young girl. She and her helpers had succeeded in saving around 2.500 children in this manner. However, her activities were discovered by the Gestapo, and she was severely tortured. She refused to divulge any vital information in spite of being brutally tortured and finally sentenced to death.\n\nThe German occupiers suspected Sendler\u2019s involvement in the Polish underground and in October, 1943 she was arrested by the Gestapo, but she managed to hide the list of the names and locations of the rescued Jewish children, preventing this information from falling into the hands of the Gestapo. Withstanding torture and imprisonment, she never revealed anything about her work or the locations of the saved children.\n\nShe was sentenced to death, but narrowly escaped on the day of her scheduled execution after Zegota bribed German officials to obtain her release. She then acquired a false identity and continued her work with the Zegota, working as a nurse until the Germans left Warsaw.\n\nDuring her later years, she worked for the ministries of education and health, and helped to organize a number of orphanages and children, family, and elderly care centers. She is best remembered for the pivotal role she played in saving the lives of approximately 2,500 Jewish children during the Holocaust in which most of the parents ultimately perished. She smuggled them out of the Warsaw Ghetto and helped in finding them homes with non-Jewish families, an act for which she later received wide spread recognition.\n\nIrena Sendler lived a long life, and spent her last years in Warsaw. She died on the 12th of May 2008 at the age of 98 and is buried in Warsaw\u2019s Powazki Cemetery.\n\nRecognition and Awards\n\nIn 1965 Sendler was recognized by Yad Vashem as one of the Polish Righteous Among the Nations. In 1983 she was present when a tree was planted in her honor at the Garden of the Righteous Among the Nations.\n\nIn 1991 Sendler was made an Honorary Citizen of Israel. In June, 1996 she was awarded the Commander\u2019s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. She received a higher version of this award, the Commander\u2019s Cross with Star on the 7th of November, 2001. She was honored with the Order of the White Eagle, Poland\u2019s highest civilian decoration, in 2003. Sendler was posthumously granted two awards in 2009: The Humanitarian of the Year Award from the Sister Rose Thering Endowment, and the Audrey Hepburn Humanitarian Award.\n\nIn 2003 Pope John Paul II sent Sendler a personal letter praising her wartime efforts. She was awarded The Polish-American Award, the Jan Karski Award \u201cFor courage and heart,\u201d given by The American Center of Polish Culture in Washington, DC.\n\nIn 2006 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland, and the Life in a Jar Foundation established the Irena Sendler Award \u201cfor repairing the world.\u201d The Life in a Jar Foundation dedicated to promoting the attitude and message of Irena Sendler. On the 14th of March in 2007, Sendler was honored by the Senate of Poland and a year later, on the 30th of July, by the United States Congress. On the 11th of April in 2007 she received the Order of the Smile. At that she was the oldest recipient of the award.\n\nIn 2007 she became an Honorary Citizen of the Cities of Warsaw and Tarczyn. In 2013 the walkway in front of the Polin Museum of the history of Polish Jews in Warsaw was named after Sendler. \u201cThis noble woman \u2026worked for Zegota and saved hundreds of Jewish children.\u201d\n\nReferences: (1) Irena Sendler\u2014Wikipedia; (2) Irena Sendler Biography-Facts, Childhood, Family Life, and Achievements; (3) Irena Sendler\u2014Stories of Women, Who Received Jews during the Holocaust ."}], "Irena Sendler was responsible for saving the lives of 2,500 Jewish children.": [{"url": "https://allthatsinteresting.com/irena-sendler", "page_content": "Irena Sendler even managed to survive torture by the Gestapo and a death sentence.\n\nAt the onset of World War II, the Germans outlawed helping Jews, making it punishable by death in Poland. And not only the death of the one offering assistance, but the death of their entire family.\n\nIrena Sendler was well aware of the danger, but that didn\u2019t stop her from risking everything to save the lives of over 2,000 Jewish children.\n\nA Fitting Heir To A Legacy Of Courage And Sacrifice\n\nRemembered today as \u201cthe female Oskar Schindler,\u201d Irena Sendler was an activist and outspoken critic of antisemitic policies long before the outbreak of World War II.\n\nLater, she would attribute the values that guided her work to her upbringing: \u201cI was taught by my father that when someone is drowning you don\u2019t ask if they can swim, you just jump in and help.\u201d\n\nHer father lived and died by his philosophy. He was a doctor to the poor, whom he often treated at no cost. It was on an errand of mercy that he contracted typhus from a patient. When he died, his daughter was just seven years old.\n\nThe Jewish community that he had so often practiced in offered financial support to his widow, but she turned them down, saying that she and her daughter would manage.\n\nAs she grew older, Irena Sendler proved herself a fitting heir to her parents\u2019 legacy. At school, she was a vocal critic of the system that segregated Jewish pupils from their non-Jewish counterparts during classes and lectures.\n\nShe frequently joined Jewish friends on the other side of the aisle, and when a Jewish friend was beaten, she crossed out the stamp on her grade card that marked her as a gentile and made the move permanent. The administration wasn\u2019t a fan; they suspended her for three years.\n\nForged Papers, Secret Supplies, And Smuggled Children\n\nAt the time of the German invasion of Poland, Irena Sendler was working for the Polish Social Welfare Department. When the Nazis came to power, she watched her Jewish coworkers turned away, dismissed from their jobs after years of service.\n\nThe entire Polish Social Welfare Department was then barred from helping any Polish Jews \u2014 they would be served by the institutions in their own communities, the Germans said.\n\nIrena Sendler wasn\u2019t going to let that stop her. She enlisted a group of supportive co-workers and began to created falsified papers that enabled her and her team to help Jewish families. Over four years, she fabricated 3,000 documents.\n\nShe continued to do so even when the stakes rose sharply in 1941: it was announced that the penalty for being found to have helped Polish Jews was death.\n\nIn 1943, Sendler joined the Zegota, an underground organization devoted to helping Jewish people escape the Holocaust. Under the fake name Jolanta, she was elected to head the Jewish children\u2019s section.\n\nBecause of her job with the Social Welfare Department, Sendler had authorization to enter the Warsaw Ghetto, the portion of the city where 300,000 Jews were being held captive.\n\nThough the Germans cared not at all for the lives of Polish Jews behind the ghetto\u2019s walls, they did fear typhus. Specifically, they worried that the deadly infectious fever could spread from inside the ghetto to the soldiers standing guard. So they allowed doctors in to check for symptoms and treat it.\n\nUnder the guise of performing these sanitation inspections, Irena Sendler would enter the ghettos, sneaking in food, medicine, and clothing. But she didn\u2019t leave empty-handed: in the ambulances and trams that drove away from the ghetto were babies and small children. When no other means were available, children were even loaded into packages and suitcases.\n\nOver 2,500 children were smuggled out of the ghettos, at least 400 of them by Sendler herself. She recalls heart-wrenching conversations as families decided whether to send their children out into the city, where discovery meant death.\n\nWhen parents asked Sendler whether she could promise that their children would be safe, she replied that she could not; she didn\u2019t even know whether she herself would make it out of the ghetto alive that day. All she could offer was the promise that she would never stop working on their behalf to protect and one day reunite them.\n\nPrayer Drills And Christian Training For Jewish Children\n\nOnce outside of the ghetto\u2019s confines, the smuggled children were dispersed among friends of the Zegota. Some were placed in the care of Christian Polish families and given Christian names. They were also taught Christian prayers and values in case they were tested.\n\nOne member of the Zegota remembers waking children at night and asking them to recite their prayers, drilling them endlessly so that they would remember them someday under pressure. These small proofs could be the difference between life and death.\n\nSome of the children were sent to the Warsaw orphanage of the Sisters of the Family of Mary or similar Roman Catholic convents and schools. They were also renamed and taught Christian traditons to mask their heritage.\n\nSendler\u2019s ultimate goal was to keep the children safe until the end of the war and then return them to their families, so she kept careful records of the children\u2019s whereabouts, new names, and given names. She kept the lists in jars buried underground.\n\nBut any hope for those someday reunions was growing dim. In July of 1942, the Nazis began what they called the Grossaktion, or Great Action. They had started to systematically round up the Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto and \u201cresettle them\u201d in the east. But the trains the Warsaw Jews boarded were bound for death camps.\n\nIrena Sendler, well known within the ghetto\u2019s walls, was forced to watch her friends disappear.\n\nThe Arrest And Torture Of Irena Sendler\n\nSendler was arrested in late 1943 and tortured by the Gestapo \u2014 and through it all, she managed to keep the children\u2019s identities safe. In the moments preceding her arrest, she was able to toss the documents she had with her to a friend, who concealed them in her clothes.\n\nIn the face of brutal beatings and captivity, Sendler never named any of her comrades or the children they saved.\n\nShe even managed to survive being sentenced to death. As the officers of the Gestapo were bringing her to her execution, fellow members of the Zegota saved her life with a last minute bribe.\n\nEven though her work had almost cost her her life, Sendler returned to her position with the Zegota after her escape, this time under a different name.\n\nAfter the war, Irena Sendler continued helping people by taking a job as a nurse. Despite the demands of her job, she still attempted to make good on her promise to return the children to their families. Sadly, she learned that almost all of the families had been killed at the Treblinka concentration camp or were missing.\n\nFor her efforts, Sendler was recognized by the state of Israel as one of the Righteous Among the Nations, an award created in 1963 for outstanding citizens. She was initially unable to go to Israel to receive it because of travel restrictions imposed by Poland\u2019s communist government \u2014 but finally, in 1983, the award made it to her.\n\nIn 2003, Pope John Paul II personally wrote to her to thank her for her efforts, and later that year, she received Poland\u2019s highest civilian honor, The Order of the White Eagle. She was also given the Jan Karski award for \u201cCourage and Heart\u201d by the American Center for Polish Culture.\n\nThough she\u2019s received countless other awards, Irena Sendler has remained humble about her contribution to the Jewish community.\n\n\u201cI was brought up to believe that a person must be rescued when drowning, regardless of religion and nationality,\u201d she said in a 2007 interview, one year before her death at age 98.\n\n\u201cThe term \u2018hero\u2019 irritates me greatly. The opposite is true. I continue to have pangs of conscience that I did so little.\u201d\n\nAfter this look at Irena Sendler and her amazing heroism during the Holocaust, read about Ilse Koch, the concentration camp guard who was called \u201cthe bitch of Buchenwald.\u201d Then, check out Inga Arvad, the girlfriend that Adolf Hitler and John F. Kennedy had in common."}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/activist/irena-sendler", "page_content": "(1910-2008)\n\nWho Was Irena Sendler?\n\nWhen the Nazis invaded in 1939, Irena Sendler was a social worker and so had access to the Warsaw Ghetto, where hundreds of thousands of Jews were imprisoned. As a member of \u017begota (aka Konrad \u017begota Committee, the Council to Aid Jews), she helped rescue 2,500 Jewish children from the ghetto. For her courageous actions during the Holocaust, in 1965, Israel\u2019s Yad Vashem honored her as \u201cRighteous Among the Nations.\u201d Sendler died in Warsaw in 2008.\n\nEarly Life\n\nSendler was born Irena Krzy\u017canowska on February 15, 1910, in Otwock, Poland. Her parents were members of the Polish Socialist Party, and her father, Stanis\u0142aw Krzy\u017canowski was a medical doctor who died of typhus when Sendler was a child. In 1931 Sendler married Mieczys\u0142aw Sendler, and the couple moved to Warsaw before the outbreak of World War II.\n\nWarsaw Ghetto\n\nIn Warsaw, Sendler became a social worker, overseeing the city\u2019s \u201ccanteens,\u201d which provided assistance to people in need. When the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939, Sendler and her colleagues also used the canteens to provide medicine, clothing and other necessities to the city\u2019s persecuted Jewish population.\n\nIn 1940, the Nazis forced Warsaw\u2019s more than 400,000 Jewish residents into a small locked ghetto area, where thousands died every month from disease and starvation. As a social worker, Sendler was able to enter the ghetto regularly to help the residents and soon joined \u017begota, the Council to Aid Jews. Putting themselves at great risk, she and about two dozen of her colleagues set out to save as many Jewish children as possible from death in the ghetto or deportation to concentration camps.\n\n\u017begota began by saving Jewish orphans. They had several ways of smuggling them out of the ghetto: Some were carried out in caskets or potato sacks; others left in ambulances or snuck out through underground tunnels. Still others entered the Jewish side of a Catholic church that straddled the ghetto boundary and left on the other side with new identities. Sendler then helped place the children at convents or with non-Jewish families.\n\nAs the situation became more dire for the ghetto\u2019s inhabitants, Sendler went beyond rescuing orphans and began asking parents to let her try to get their children to safety. Although she couldn\u2019t guarantee the children\u2019s survival, she could tell parents that their children would at least have a chance. Sendler kept detailed records and lists of the children she helped buried in a jar. Her plan was to reunite the rescued children and their parents after the war. However, most of the parents did not survive.\n\nOn October 20, 1943, the Nazis arrested Sendler and sent her to Pawiak Prison. There they tortured her, trying to get her to reveal the names of her associates. She refused and was sentenced to death. However, \u017begota members bribed the prison guards, and Sendler was released in February 1944.\n\nSendler continued her work until the war ended, by which time she and her colleagues had rescued some 2,500 children. It has been estimated that Sendler personally saved about 400.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nAfter the war, Sendler\u2019s first marriage ended in divorce. In 1947 she married Stefan Zgrzembski, with whom she had three children, daughter Janka, and sons Andrzej (who died in infancy) and Adam. After the death of Zgrzembski, Sendler remarried her first husband, Mieczys\u0142aw Sendler, but their reunion didn't last and they again divorced.\n\nHonors and Awards\n\nIn 1965, Yad Vashem, Israel\u2019s Holocaust memorial organization, named Sendler as Righteous Among the Nations for her work saving Jewish children. In 2003, Poland honored her with its Order of the White Eagle. In 2008, Sendler was nominated for (but did not win) a Nobel Peace Prize. The story of her life was also captured in a 2009 TV movie The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler, which starred Anna Paquin in the title role.\n\nDeath\n\nSendler died on May 12, 2008, in Warsaw, Poland, at the age of 98.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nBirth Year: 1910\n\nBirth date: February 15, 1910\n\nBirth City: Otwock\n\nBirth Country: Poland\n\nGender: Female\n\nBest Known For: Irena Sendler was a Polish social worker who, during World War II, helped to rescue 2,500 Jewish children from the Warsaw Ghetto, and placed them in convents or with non-Jewish families.\n\nAstrological Sign: Aquarius\n\nDeath Year: 2008\n\nDeath date: May 12, 2008\n\nDeath City: Warsaw\n\nDeath Country: Poland\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION"}, {"url": "https://aboutholocaust.org/en/facts/who-was-irena-sendler-and-why-did-she-smuggle-jewish-children-out-of-the-warsaw-ghetto", "page_content": "Irena Sendler (1910-2008) was a Polish social worker who helped Jews in Warsaw throughout the German occupation.

She has been recognized by Yad Vashem as a Righteous Among the Nations, and awarded the Jan Karski for Valor and Courage.\n\nTo say the least, Irena Sendler is an inspiring humanitarian with a fascinating life story; her incredible courage and bravery saving the lives of many Jewish people throughout WWII. In this piece, we will be exploring the life of this influential figure, and her part to play during the Holocaust.\n\nFor more information on the Holocaust, and other influential figures throughout it, please click here.\n\nEarly Life\n\nBorn in Warsaw on the 15th of February 1910, Irena Sendler (or Irena Kryzyzanowski at the time) was the daughter of Janina and Dr Stanislaw Kryzyzanowski. Although born in Warsaw, Irena grew up in a town near the city called Otwock, and was an only child.\n\nHer father (Dr Stanislaw Kryzyzanowski) died from typhus, which he contracted whilst treating patients, when Irena was only seven years old. Stanislaw, although dying when Irena was very young, had a profound impact on the life values she carried throughout her life, claiming that through her father \u201cI was taught that if you see a person drowning, you must jump into the water to save them, whether you can swim or not.\u201d\n\nAfter Stanislaw\u2019s death, many leaders in the Jewish community helped to fund Irena\u2019s education, which lead her to study at Warsaw University in Polish Literature.\n\nDuring her time at university, Irena disagreed with the ghetto bench system that had already been established in some of the universities prior to the war. In reaction to this, she vandalised her grade card and was consequently put on a three year-long suspension from the university.\n\nThis was not the last of Irena\u2019s protests against Jewish discrimination, but rather the beginning to her humanitarian career, fighting for the lives of Jewish people throughout the Holocaust.\n\nHow Did Irena Sendler Help During the War?\n\nEven in the very beginnings of WWII, as the Germans invaded Irena\u2019s birthplace of Warsaw, she started to help the city\u2019s Jews, providing them with food and water. However, once the ghetto was built within the city this cut off Irena\u2019s access to those who needed her aid. She then started to plan out another way in which to help.\n\nOnce the Warsaw Ghetto was established in the year 1940, Irena then started to smuggle out orphaned children. She used her status as a social worker, in addition to documentation from an employee at the Contagious Disease (who also became a part of the underground group Zegota) to gain access into the Warsaw Ghetto, and access to the orphaned children who lived in it.\n\nAfter the underground Polish resistance group for the Provisional Committee for Aid to Jews (Zegota) was established in 1942. Irena was soon appointed as head of its children\u2019s division. During her position with Zegota, Irena and her team helped to rescue around 2,500 Jewish children from the Warsaw Ghetto. There were four main ways in which Irena\u2019s team would smuggle out children from the ghetto, these being as follows:\n\nSmuggled through an old courthouse next to the ghetto.\n\nEscape through underground passages such as the sewer.\n\nHide in a luggage bag and then carried out by a trolley.\n\nVia ambulance; hidden under stretchers, faking illness or genuinely being ill.\n\nThose rescued were sent to numerous different orphanages and religious institutions that took in vulnerable children. Irena used her contacts with these places to smuggle the children in under false names. Some of the main places these children were smuggled into included the Rodzina Marii Orphanage, and religious institutions in and around Chotomow, Turkowice and Lublin.\n\nWhy Was Irena Sendler Imprisoned?\n\nOn the 20th of October 1943, Irena was arrested, and sent to Piawiak prison. During her time in imprisonment she was tortured for information on the other members of Zegota, and Irena fed the interrogators false information. Irena was then sentenced to death, however did not fulfil this sentence as her fellow Zegota members bribed workers in the prison to let her escape.\n\nThe day after Irena\u2019s escape, Nazi officials interestingly announced that she had been shot, with posters with this false news dotted all around Warsaw. Irena was in hiding throughout the rest of the war, and once over, started to try and connect the children she had saved with their parents. Unfortunately, nearly all of these parents had been killed during the holocaust.\n\nLater Life\n\nWhen the war was over, Irena carried on her career as a social worker. She received numerous awards for her outstanding bravery and courage; these included the previously mentioned Yad Vashem\u2019s Righteous Among the Nations, and Jan Karski\u2019s Valor and Courage. In addition to these, Irena was also awarded Poland\u2019s Order of the White Eagle, and has been a nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nIrena then spent the latter part of her life cared for in Warsaw by a woman called Elzbieta Ficowska. Eizbieta was one of the children (six months old at the time) Irena had smuggled out of city\u2019s ghetto.\n\nIrena has remarked on her actions during the war, stating that \u201cWe who were rescuing children re not some kind of heroes. That term irritates me greatly. The opposite is true \u2013 I continue to have qualms of conscience that I did so little. I could have done more. This regret will follow me to my death.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.neh.gov/article/irena-sendler-and-girls-kansas", "page_content": "Between 1942 and 1943, Sendler and her network of 10 compatriots rescued 2,500 Jewish children from the Warsaw ghetto. Disguised as an infection-control nurse, Sendler knocked on doors in the ghetto, asking parents and grandparents to give up their children and grandchildren so that she could smuggle them out. Each child was given a new Polish name and forged identity papers and hidden in foster homes, orphanages, or convents. Sendler insisted that lists of the children be kept, documenting their Jewish and Polish names, so that after the war they would know their original identities. She hid the lists in milk jars that were buried in the backyard of one of her co-conspirators.\n\nPhoto caption A young Irena Sendler, in Warsaw, circa 1930. \u2014 AF Fotografie / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAfter the war, Poland\u2019s Communist government persecuted members of Poland\u2019s wartime resistance, Zegota, of which Sendler was a part. They were harassed, interrogated, imprisoned, and even executed. Sendler and others who rescued Jews during the war kept silent. Almost no one knew of Sendler and her heroism.\n\nShe would have remained an unsung hero were it not for three teenage American girls who discovered her forgotten story 60 years later. Liz, Megan, and Sabrina, who began as students of history for a National History Day competition, became recorders of history, championing Sendler\u2019s legacy in Poland, the U.S., and around the world. Three teenagers from rural Kansas helped crack open the silence about the Holocaust in Poland.\n\nMy first brush with this story came in the winter of 2001, in my Middlebury, Vermont, pediatric office, while going through my mail. This was before the electronic health record, and I daily triaged a prodigious stack of paper. Everything had about three seconds to be kept, filed, recycled, or thrown away.\n\nI am a member of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM). Each year I send a contribution, and they send me a calendar highlighting 12 monthly Holocaust heroes. As I quickly flipped through, I was brought up short by the November entry. It was the photo that stopped me\u2014a young Irena Sendler, twenty-nine years old, who looked a lot like my niece. I read the short paragraph below the photo:\n\nIrena Sendlerowa, (1916\u2013UNKNOWN) As head of the children\u2019s division of Zegota, the Polish underground Council for Aid to Jews, social worker Irena Sendlerowa (code name \u201cJolanta\u201d) helped smuggle more than 2,500 Jewish children out of the Warsaw ghetto. Hiding them in orphanages, convents, schools, hospitals, and private homes, she provided each child with a new identity, carefully recording in code their Jewish names and placements so that surviving relatives could find them after the war. Arrested by the Gestapo in the fall of 1943, Sendlerowa was sentenced to death. Zegota rescued her before her execution. She assumed a new identity and continued her work for Zegota.\n\nI was stunned. I\u2019m a child of Holocaust survivors. How could I not know Irena Sendler\u2019s story? Everybody knows Oskar Schindler, who rescued 1,100 Jews from a German concentration camp in Poland and whose story was told in the Steven Spielberg film Schindler\u2019s List. Even at the USHMM, the preeminent scholars of the Holocaust didn\u2019t know much about Sendler. They had her birth year wrong (it was 1910, I later found out), and they didn\u2019t know if she was still alive.\n\nI kept this calendar in a file labeled \u201cInteresting Stuff.\u201d And there it sat for almost three years.\n\nPhoto caption These children rescued by Sendler were sent to live with new identities at a Polish convent, circa 1943. \u2014 World History Archive / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nThen, in February 2004, I came into my office one night to see a sick child. On my desk someone had left a copy of the Ladies Home Journal, opened to an article, \u201cThe Woman Who Loved Children.\u201d It was about Irena Sendler and three Kansas teens who uncovered her story. The article explained that, in 1999, while planning a National History Day project, they found a brief reference to Sendler in a U.S. News and World Report article entitled \u201cThe Other Schindlers.\u201d Sendler\u2019s story inspired their NHD project: a play they wrote and performed called Life in a Jar. It retold, in dramatic form, the emotional story of Sendler knocking on ghetto doors and asking Jewish parents to give up their children to save them. The title, Life in a Jar, refers to the lists Sendler buried.\n\nThe teens read that Irena had been arrested in 1943 by the Gestapo and tortured in Pawiak Prison, the most notorious prison in the ghetto, from which almost no one escaped. Logically, they began searching cemetery records and reached out to the Jewish Foundation for the Righteous, seeking information about where she might be buried. Soon after, they received a letter from the foundation, saying that Sendler was alive! She was in her nineties and living in poverty with her daughter-in-law in Warsaw. The foundation then put them in touch with Sendler.\n\nThe three students made plans to travel to Poland and meet Sendler, first trying to raise money through candy sales, until philanthropists and Holocaust survivors from the Kansas City Jewish community stepped in to help cover the trip. Traveling out of the country for the first time (the first time on a plane for one of them), the girls finally met Sendler at her Warsaw home in 2001. They maintained a tender friendship with her for the next seven years until she passed, making several trips to Poland to visit her, each time performing Life in a Jar at various venues. And they began working with Polish high school students who were telling the forgotten stories of rescuers from their own communities.\n\nPhoto caption The original three students\u2014Liz,Megan, and Sabrina\u2014are joined by Jessica Shelton-Ripper (third from left), who performed many times with Life in a Jar.

This story now took on a new dimension. I have been a closet writer most of my life, and I was thinking about writing a novella about the Warsaw ghetto. Irena Sendler seemed like a compelling character, and I wanted to know more about her. I was also intrigued by the two stories\u2014Irena\u2019s wartime history and the contemporary story of three Kansas teens. I called their teacher in Kansas, Norm Conard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s serendipitous that you should call,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for someone to write these two stories.\u201d\n\nI hesitated. I had not written nonfiction before, only fiction and poetry. But I felt the powerful synergy of these two stories. I was not eager to write a wartime history of a Holocaust hero because most Holocaust literature leaves me angry, sad, depressed, and frustrated. But this story was different\u2014an inspiring story of three typical American teenagers who helped restore the history of a great hero.\n\nI agreed to write the story and, in 2004, visited Uniontown, Kansas, where the girls went to school. A small town with a population of 264, it was down on its luck. Many stores were shuttered. It had the look of a Dorothea Lange or Walker Evans black-and-white photo from the Depression. I met Norm and the girls at the high school, and I was hooked.\n\nUniontown High School, with only about 120 students, is one of the lowest-income school districts in Kansas. There was no diversity in the school\u2014never a Jew, an African American, or even a Catholic\u2014yet these teens had discovered Sendler\u2019s story and told the world. I spent a week interviewing the students, their families, their teacher, community members, and Holocaust survivors from Kansas City who had taken a great interest in the play and the Irena Sendler project.\n\nMy wife and I accompanied the students and Conard to Poland on their third visit, in 2005. I was able to do more extensive research and interview Sendler, Holocaust scholars, and some of the children Sendler had rescued, now in their sixties and seventies. We met Elzbieta Ficowska, rescued as a six-month-old infant. Sendler had sedated her and put her in a carpenter\u2019s box. Her parents kissed their baby good-bye and left a small spoon in the box with her name inscribed on one side and her birthdate on the other. It is the only memento of her parents, who were murdered at Treblinka. She and I have become good friends, and I have held her spoon many times, always with tears. Ficowska became one of Sendler\u2019s caregivers and the chairperson of the Association of Children of the Holocaust in Poland.\n\nIt was Sendler\u2019s ninety-fifth birthday when I interviewed her. She was energetic, and her memory was clear and specific. She wanted to be sure that I credited all of her network of rescuers and liaisons. She ensured that I had everyone\u2019s name spelled correctly.\n\nPhoto caption Megan took this picture of Sendler on May 3, 2008, during a visit to Poland. Sendler passed away nine days later on May 12. \u2014 Megan Felt\n\nPoland was arguably the most victimized country in occupied Europe. The consequence for hiding or even feeding a Jew was execution, often in public as a warning to other Poles. When I asked Sendler why she put herself and her family at such risk, she said, \u201cIt was a need of my heart.\u201d She rejected the appellation of hero. \u201cI only did what any decent person would do. . . . The heroes were the babies\u2014they were the heroes of their mothers\u2019 hearts. . . . It was the parents and grandparents who gave up their children, they were the true heroes.\u201d\n\nShe said it was her father\u2019s teaching that inspired her. \u201cIf you see someone drowning you must rescue them, even if you cannot swim.\u201d And \u201cthere are only two kinds of people in the world, good and bad, regardless of race, religion, or creed. And most people are good.\u201d\n\nShe lamented that she had not done enough\u2014for every child they saved almost one hundred went to their deaths at Treblinka.\n\nSendler has become a Polish national hero. Poles have been eager to tell their stories, in part because the Life in a Jar project stimulated Polish/Jewish dialog as well as scholarship about Poland during the German occupation. Although there has been a disturbing return of anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial in Poland, Sendler\u2019s story continues to be told.\n\nYad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Jerusalem, recognizes more Righteous Gentiles\u2014those who rescued out of principle, not for personal gain\u2014from Poland than from any other country in occupied Europe. In 2019, it listed 27,362 Righteous Gentiles, with 6,992 from Poland, or around 26 percent. But because of postwar Poland\u2019s Communist anti-Semitism, Polish rescuers who had received Yad Vashem medals hid them and told no one of their wartime activities.\n\nAt one performance of Life in a Jar in Warsaw, I sat beside an old man, old enough to have been an adult during the war. Throughout the performance he sat with his hands together, clutching something inside. After the performance I asked him about it, and he opened his hands to reveal his Yad Vashem medal. There were tears in his eyes as he explained, \u201cI have kept this buried in my basement for 60 years. I told no one except my wife. I didn\u2019t tell my children, family, friends, or coworkers. Now, because of these American students, I can show this proudly. It was the finest thing I have ever done.\u201d\n\nMy first time in Warsaw, in 2005, I could find few markers of the Warsaw ghetto and no commemoration of the wall. In my research for the book, I found no reference to Irena Sendler before 2000 other than by Yad Vashem (1965 Righteous Gentile medal, and in 1983 a tree planted in her honor next to that of Raoul Wallenberg) and the U.S. News and World Report article that launched the Kansas teens on their National History Day project.\n\nWhen I returned in 2013 for the release of the Polish translation of my 2011 book Life in a Jar: The Irena Sendler Project (also translated into Russian, Chinese, and Mongolian), I saw how much had changed in Poland. Where there had been no markers of the wall, now there is a footprint, 10 inches wide that says, \u201cMUR GETTA/GHETTO WALL 1940\u20131943,\u201d placed in sidewalks and lawns showing the exact location of the ghetto wall. At each of the 22 gates there is a memorial plaque with a map and description of what happened in the ghetto.\n\nThere are now 35 Irena Sendler schools in Poland, three in Germany, one in France, and one in England. I have met to discuss Sendler with Poland\u2019s Deputy Foreign Secretary Jerzy Pomianowski, given radio, TV, and print interviews, and met with a journalist from the Catholic News Agency. The Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw opened in 2014, and the Lowell Milken Center Europe, a Polish office of the Irena Sendler/Life in a Jar Foundation, works with Polish teens on similar projects.\n\nThe project changed Poland as well as the American students who started it all. From my time with the Kansas teens, I learned that each girl knew something about losing or almost losing their own parent. Liz was abandoned by her parents as a young child and raised by her grandparents, Megan\u2019s mother developed cancer, and Sabrina\u2019s mother suddenly died during the project. The girls courageously allowed me to tell their own painful stories in my book. And it became clear to me that the last three children Irena Sendler rescued were the girls from Kansas.\n\nToday, Elizabeth Cambers Hutton has two master\u2019s degrees and teaches Holocaust history in Missouri. Sabrina Coons-Murphy is an elementary schoolteacher in Kansas. Megan Stewart Felt, the program coordinator for the Irena Sendler/Life in a Jar Foundation, still works with Norm Conard to further Sendler\u2019s legacy and continues to play Sendler in performances of Life in a Jar.\n\nThe story has also changed me. I am a German-American Jew, born after the war to parents who narrowly escaped the Holocaust. Others in my family did not. For the first five years of my life I lived in upper Manhattan, in Washington Heights\u2014an urban shtetl of German Jews who had survived the Holocaust. I didn\u2019t speak English until I was five years old. The Holocaust was the baffling but iconic story of my childhood, a subject of nervous, hushed, adult conversation. It was frightening, mysterious, impossible to grasp, yet everywhere\u2014it was the atmosphere. There was an awkward gracelessness on the part of those who lived through it, a furtiveness I now understand to be a kind of PTSD. It was the unacknowledged elephant in the living room\u2014huge but shrouded.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was in my twenties that I learned that my grandfather had been arrested on Kristallnacht, November 9, 1938, and imprisoned in Dachau. My grandmother went to high school with one of the administrative guards at Dachau. He accepted a bribe from her, and my grandfather was released after six months. In 1999, my parents were interviewed as part of Steven Spielberg\u2019s Shoah project. In the course of the interview my mother brought out her identity papers, marked \u201cJew,\u201d and her nursing certificate, stamped with a swastika. My brother and I had never seen these artifacts.\n\nGrowing up as a child of survivors, I had a sense of mission about the Holocaust, but didn\u2019t know how that would manifest. Now in my seventies, I find that in writing Life in a Jar, and speaking about it to new audiences, I am fulfilling that mission.\n\nIn my talks, sponsored by the Vermont Humanities Council, I emphasize how Sendler and the girls from Kansas were repairing the world\u2014tikkun olam in Hebrew. Few of us would have the courage to do what Sendler did, but all of us can do what Liz, Megan, and Sabrina did\u2014performing small acts of decency and respect for all people. Acts that change the world."}, {"url": "https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/irena-sendler", "page_content": "When Hitler and his Nazis built the Warsaw Ghetto and herded 500,000 Polish Jews behind its walls to await liquidation, Irena Sendler defied the Nazis and saved 2,500 Jewish children by smuggling them out of the Warsaw Ghetto. As a health worker, she sneaked the children out between 1942 and 1943 to safe hiding places and found non-Jewish families to adopt them.\n\nHer achievement went largely unnoticed for many years. Then the story was uncovered by four young students at Uniontown High School, in Kansas, who were the winners of the 2000 Kansas state National History Day competition by writing a play Life in a Jar about the heroic actions of Irena Sendler. The girls - Elizabeth Cambers, Megan Stewart, Sabrina Coons and Janice Underwood - have since gained international recognition, along with their teacher, Norman Conard. The presentation, seen in many venues in the United States and popularized by National Public Radio, C-SPAN and CBS, has brought Irena Sendler's story to a wider public.\n\nSendler was born in 1910 in Otwock, a town some 15 miles southeast of Warsaw. She was greatly influenced by her father who was one of the first Polish Socialists. As a doctor his patients were mostly poor Jews.\n\nIn 1939, Germany invaded Poland, and the brutality of the Nazis accelerated with murder, violence and terror.\n\nAt the time, Irena was a Senior Administrator in the Warsaw Social Welfare Department, which operated the canteens in every district of the city. Previously, the canteens provided meals, financial aid, and other services for orphans, the elderly, the poor and the destitute. Now, through Irena, the canteens also provided clothing, medicine and money for the Jews. They were registered under fictitious Christian names, and to prevent inspections, the Jewish families were reported as being afflicted with such highly infectious diseases as typhus and tuberculosis.\n\nBut in 1942, the Nazis herded hundreds of thousands of Jews into a 16-block area that came to be known as the Warsaw Ghetto. The Ghetto was sealed and the Jewish families ended up behind its walls, only to await certain death.\n\nSendler was so appalled by the conditions that she joined Zegota, the Council for Aid to Jews, organized by the Polish underground resistance movement, as one of its first recruits and directed the efforts to rescue Jewish children.\n\nTo be able to enter the Ghetto legally, Irena managed to be issued a pass from Warsaws Epidemic Control Department and she visited the Ghetto daily, reestablished contacts and brought food, medicines and clothing. But 5,000 people were dying a month from starvation and disease in the Ghetto, and she decided to help the Jewish children to get out.\n\nFor Sendler, a young mother herself, persuading parents to part with their children was in itself a horrendous task. Finding families willing to shelter the children, and thereby willing to risk their life if the Nazis ever found out, was also not easy.\n\nSendler, who wore a star armband as a sign of her solidarity to Jews, began smuggling children out in an ambulance. She recruited at least one person from each of the ten centers of the Social Welfare Department. With their help, she issued hundreds of false documents with forged signatures and successfully smuggled almost 2,500 Jewish children to safety and gave them temporary new identities.\n\nSome children were taken out in gunnysacks or body bags. Some were buried inside loads of goods. A mechanic took a baby out in his toolbox. Some kids were carried out in potato sacks, others were placed in coffins, some entered a church in the Ghetto which had two entrances. One entrance opened into the Ghetto, the other opened into the Aryan side of Warsaw. They entered the church as Jews and exited as Christians. \"Can you guarantee they will live?\" Irena later recalled the distraught parents asking. But she could only guarantee they would die if they stayed. \"In my dreams,\" she said, \"I still hear the cries when they left their parents.\"\n\nIrena Sendler accomplished her incredible deeds with the active assistance of the church. \"I sent most of the children to religious establishments,\" she recalled. \"I knew I could count on the Sisters.\" Irena also had a remarkable record of cooperation when placing the youngsters: \"No one ever refused to take a child from me,\" she said.\n\nThe children were given false identities and placed in homes, orphanages and convents. Sendler carefully noted, in coded form, the children's original names and their new identities. She kept the only record of their true identities in jars buried beneath an apple tree in a neighbor's back yard, across the street from German barracks, hoping she could someday dig up the jars, locate the children and inform them of their past. In all, the jars contained the names of 2,500 children.\n\nBut the Nazis became aware of Irena's activities, and on October 20, 1943 she was arrested, imprisoned and tortured by the Gestapo, who broke her feet and legs. She ended up in the Pawiak Prison, but no one could break her spirit. Though she was the only one who knew the names and addresses of the families sheltering the Jewish children, she withstood the torture, refusing to betray either her associates or any of the Jewish children in hiding.\n\nSentenced to death, Irena was saved at the last minute when Zegota members bribed one of the Germans to halt the execution. She escaped from prison but for the rest of the war she was pursued by the Gestapo.\n\nAfter the war she dug up the jars and used the notes to track down the 2,500 children she placed with adoptive families and to reunite them with relatives scattered across Europe. But most lost their families during the Holocaust in Nazi death camps.\n\nThe children had known her only by her code name Jolanta. But years later, after she was honored for her wartime work, her picture appeared in a newspaper. \"A man, a painter, telephoned me,\" said Sendler, \"`I remember your face,' he said. `It was you who took me out of the ghetto.' I had many calls like that!\"\n\nIrena Sendler did not think of herself as a hero. She claimed no credit for her actions. \"I could have done more,\" she said. \"This regret will follow me to my death.\"\n\nShe has been honored by international Jewish organizations - in 1965 she accorded the title of Righteous Among the Nations by the Yad Vashem organization in Jerusalem and in 1991 she was made an honorary citizen of Israel.\n\nIrena Sendler was awarded Poland's highest distinction, the Order of White Eagle in Warsaw Monday Nov. 10, 2003.\n\nThis lovely, courageous woman was one of the most dedicated and active workers in aiding Jews during the Nazi occupation of Poland. Her courage enabled not only the survival of 2,500 Jewish children but also of the generations of their descendants.\n\nShe passed away on May 12, 2008, at the age of 98."}, {"url": "https://www.warhistoryonline.com/instant-articles/irena-sendler-saved-children.html", "page_content": "In times of war, it is not only soldiers who perform feats of great valor and display incredible courage.\n\nOften, non-combatant civilians risk their lives by performing quiet yet extraordinary acts of selflessness and gallantry that require just as much bravery as a soldier charging head-on into enemy fire.\n\nIrena Sendler was one such civilian. She was a gentle but determined Polish social worker who managed to smuggle 2,500 children out of the Warsaw Ghetto during the Second World War. As amazing as this feat was, she was only internationally honored for her immense bravery toward the end of her life.\n\nSendler was born in 1910 in Warsaw, Poland. Her father\u2019s dedication to doing the right thing regardless of the risk involved must certainly have made an impression on the young Irena, despite the tragic consequences of his unshakable devotion to good: in 1917, he died from typhus, contracted while treating patients other doctors refused to treat.\n\nMany of his former patients happened to be Jews, and in gratitude for what he had done, Jewish community leaders sponsored Irena\u2019s education.\n\nWhen Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, Sendler immediately began to help local Jews by offering them food and shelter.\n\nHowever, once the Nazis had established the infamous Warsaw Ghetto, into which the entire Jewish population of the city was corralled in October 1939, it became much more difficult for Sendler to provide help.\n\nThen, on November 16, 1940, when the Warsaw Ghetto was completely sealed off from the rest of the city, she realized that she would have to adopt an alternative \u2013 and more covert \u2013 approach.\n\nSurrounding the entire Warsaw Ghetto was a 3.5 meter (11.5 foot) high concrete wall topped with barbed wire and broken glass. All access points were heavily guarded by Nazi troops. Getting in, as an ordinary Polish citizen, would have been nigh on impossible.\n\nIrena Sendler knew she had to help, though. Conditions in the ghetto for the nearly 400,000 Jews crammed into the small area were horrific.\n\nAs a result of severe overcrowding and a lack of sanitation in tandem with the Nazis\u2019 miserly rations (only 200 calories per day), starvation and disease ran rampant.\n\nRealizing that her identification documents, which stated that she was a social worker, were insufficient to obtain access to the ghetto, Sendler managed to get fake ID documents identifying her as a nurse. This allowed her to get in and out of the ghetto.\n\nTo begin with, she smuggled in medicine, food, and clothes. The risks associated with something seemingly so innocuous were in fact substantial. From October 1941, the Nazis stated that helping Jews was a serious crime \u2013 one punishable by death.\n\nHowever, this did not stop Sendler and she courageously continued smuggling food and medicine to the residents of the Warsaw ghetto, as well as forging paperwork to help them.\n\nIn 1942, when the Nazi occupiers began deporting Jews from the ghetto to the notorious Treblinka death camp, it became clear to Sendler that time was running out and that she would have to take more drastic measures to help the Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto.\n\nShe joined the newly-formed underground resistance organization, Zegota, and soon became head of its Children\u2019s Unit.\n\nThis was when her most dangerous and difficult work would begin. Desperate times called for desperate measures, and Irena Sendler vowed to do whatever it took to save as many children as she could from being taken to Treblinka.\n\nSendler and ten close friends began to undertake the extremely risky business of smuggling young Jewish children out of the Warsaw Ghetto.\n\nBecause of the extreme danger involved in what they were doing, they came up with a number of inventive ways of smuggling young children out.\n\nThese methods ranged from sending them through secret underground tunnels to physically carrying them out, hiding them in suitcases, boxes, or even coffins.\n\nWhen it came to smuggling babies, whose cries might attract the attention of the guards, Sendler and her friends sedated them to make sure they stayed quiet.\n\nJewish children who were rescued by these means were then taken to Roman Catholic orphanages and convents, sometimes even private homes, and given non-Jewish names to keep their true identities safe from the German authorities.\n\nHowever, Sendler recorded the name of every child she saved, as well as the names of the child\u2019s parents and relatives. She wrote these details on scraps of paper that she put in jars which she secretly buried in a friend\u2019s backyard.\n\nShe hoped that, by preserving these details, she could reunite the children with their families after the war.\n\nIn this way, Irena Sendler and her friends were able to rescue an astonishing number of children from the Warsaw Ghetto: almost 2,500, to be exact. However, the Nazis soon became aware that someone was smuggling children out, and they arrested Sendler in October 1943.\n\nShe was brutally tortured during interrogation sessions, and her torturers broke both of her feet and her legs. But she refused to betray her friends in Zegota and did not give up any information.\n\nShe was sentenced to death, but on the day of her execution, the Gestapo officer charged with ending her life informed her that her friends in Zegota had successfully bribed him to spare her life. He secretly released her, adding her name to a list of executed prisoners.\n\nAfter this, she had go into hiding and stay underground. Even while in hiding, though, she continued to help the resistance movement in whatever way she could.\n\nAfter the war, she returned to her friend\u2019s backyard to dig up all the jars she had buried there, hoping to reunite the children she had rescued with their parents and families. Unfortunately, by that time, almost all of the children\u2019s families had been exterminated in the death camps.\n\nThe rescued children were thus either adopted by Polish families or sent to Israel.\n\nDespite Irena Sendler\u2019s incredible courage, selflessness and tenacity, and the remarkable fact that she risked her life day in and day out for years to save close to 2,500 children, her heroic actions went unrecognized for most of her life, and she remained a little-known figure outside of Poland.\n\nRead another story from us: Albert G\u00f6ring, Despised the Nazi Regime \u2013 Saved Countless Jews & Dissidents, Unlike His Brother\n\nShe finally received the recognition she deserved \u2013 but never asked for, as a truly humble person \u2013 in 1999, when a group of high school students in Kansas produced a play, Life In A Jar, based on her exploits in Warsaw.\n\nAfter this, her story became known around the world, and she was presented with a number of international awards.

Her death prompted the circulation of an online message aimed at informing the many people who remained unfamiliar with her heroic deeds during the Holocaust:\n\nThere recently was a death of a 98 year old lady named Irena. During WWII, Iliana, got permission to work in the Warsaw Ghetto. She had an ulterior motive... She KNEW what the Nazi's plans were for the Jews. Iliana smuggled infants out in the bottom of her tool box she carried, and she carried in the back of her truck a Burlap sack, (for larger kids). She also had a dog in the back, that she trained to bark when the Nazi soldiers let her in, and out of the ghetto. The soldiers of course wanted nothing to do with the dog, and the barking covered the kids/infants noises. During her time and course of doing this, she managed to smuggle out and save 2500 kids/infants. She was caught, and the Nazi's broke both her legs, and arms, and beat her severely. Iliana kept a record of the names of all the kids she smuggled out, and kept them in a glass jar, buried under a tree in her back yard. After the war, she tried to locate any parents that may have survived it, and reunited the family. Most of course had been gassed. Those kids she helped got placed into foster family homes, or adopted. Last year Iliana was up for the Nobel Peace Prize.... She LOST. Al Gore won, for a slide show on Global Warming. Check it out: www.irenasendler.org\n\nIrena has often been referred to as \"the female Oskar Schindler\" in her native Poland for her daring and ingenuity in saving the lives of more than 2,500 Jews (most of them children) in German-occupied Poland during World War II. Unlike Oskar Schindler, whose story was the subject of the Academy Award-winning 1993 film Schindler's List, Irena Sendler was a relatively unknown figure to the world at large until 1999, when four Kansas high school students wrote and performed \"Life in a Jar,\" a play about Irena's life-saving efforts in the Warsaw Ghetto:\n\nA Los Angeles Times obituary for Irena described how the Polish social worker passed herself off as a nurse to sneak supplies and aid into (and children out of) the Warsaw Ghetto, and the punishment she endured when she was finally caught by the Nazis:\n\nShe studied at Warsaw University and was a social worker in Warsaw when the German occupation of Poland began in 1939. In 1940, after the Nazis herded Jews into the ghetto and built a wall separating it from the rest of the city, disease, especially typhoid, ran rampant. Social workers were not allowed inside the ghetto, but Sendler, imagining \"the horror of life behind the walls,\" obtained fake identification and passed herself off as a nurse, allowed to bring in food, clothes and medicine. By 1942, when the deadly intentions of the Nazis had become clear, Sendler joined a Polish underground organization, Zegota. She recruited 10 close friends \u2014 a group that would eventually grow to 25, all but one of them women \u2014 and began rescuing Jewish children. She and her friends smuggled the children out in boxes, suitcases, sacks and coffins, sedating babies to quiet their cries. Some were spirited away through a network of basements and secret passages. Operations were timed to the second. One of Sendler's children told of waiting by a gate in darkness as a German soldier patrolled nearby. When the soldier passed, the boy counted to 30, then made a mad dash to the middle of the street, where a manhole cover opened and he was taken down into the sewers and eventually to safety. Most of the children who left with Sendler's group were taken into Roman Catholic convents, orphanages and homes and given non-Jewish aliases. Sendler recorded their true names on thin rolls of paper in the hope that she could reunite them with their families later. She preserved the precious scraps in jars and buried them in a friend's garden. In 1943, she was captured by the Nazis and tortured but refused to tell her captors who her co-conspirators were or where the bottles were buried. She also resisted in other ways. According to Felt, when Sendler worked in the prison laundry, she and her co-workers made holes in the German soldiers' underwear. When the officers discovered what they had done, they lined up all the women and shot every other one. It was just one of many close calls for Sendler. During one particularly brutal torture session, her captors broke her feet and legs, and she passed out. When she awoke, a Gestapo officer told her he had accepted a bribe from her comrades in the resistance to help her escape. The officer added her name to a list of executed prisoners. Sendler went into hiding but continued her rescue efforts. Felt said that Sendler had begun her rescue operation before she joined the organized resistance and helped a number of adults escape, including the man she later married. \"We think she saved about 500 people before she joined Zegota,\" Felt said, which would mean that Sendler ultimately helped rescue about 3,000 Polish Jews. When the war ended, Sendler unearthed the jars and began trying to return the children to their families. For the vast majority, there was no family left. Many of the children were adopted by Polish families; others were sent to Israel.\n\nIrena Sendler is often claimed to have been a candidate to receive the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, but that honor was not awarded to her. It's not possible to state categorically that she was \"nominated\" for the award, since information about Nobel Prize \"nominations, investigations, and opinions is kept secret for fifty years.\" (Since 1974 the statutes of the Nobel Foundation have stated that \"work produced by a person since deceased shall not be considered for an award,\" so she presumably could not be subsequently honored.)\n\nIn 2007, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded jointly to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and former U.S. Vice-President Albert Arnold (Al) Gore Jr. \"for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change.\" (Al Gore was also involved with another significant award in 2007, when An Inconvenient Truth, a documentary about his campaign to make the issue of global warming a recognized problem worldwide, claimed an Academy Award as \"Best Documentary Feature.\")\n\nThe International Federation of Social Workers (IFSW) expressed its disappointment that Irena Sendler had not yet been honored with a Nobel Prize:"}, {"url": "https://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/irena-sendler-6152.php", "page_content": "Irena studied Polish literature at Warsaw University, and joined the Polish Socialist Party.

Due to this she was suspended from the University of Warsaw for three years.\n\nHer father was a physician and also one of the first Polish Socialists. She was greatly influenced by his selfless service to the patients, most of whom were Jewish and poor. Her father contracted typhus while treating Jewish patients the other doctors had refused to treat and died in February 1917.\n\nShe was born as Irena Krzy\u017canowska on 15 February 1910 in Otwock, near Warsaw, to Stanis\u0142aw Krzy\u017canowski and his wife Janina.

Her father was a humanitarian-minded physician who treated Jews in Otwock during typhus outbreaks when other doctors refused to do so. He later died from the disease when Sendler was seven years old. She later recalled that it was a proverb often repeated by her father that served as the inspiration for her own actions: \u201cIf you see a person drowning,\u201d she told Norman Conard in NEA Today, \u201cyou must jump into the water to save them, whether you can swim or not.\u201d\n\nJoined Resistance Movement\n\nAs a young woman, Sendler entered the field of social work, and was 29 years old when World War II broke out in the late summer of 1939. The origin of the conflict was Nazi Germany's occupation of Poland. Horrified by the Nazis' anti-Semitic policies already in place in Germany and now being implemented in Poland under the occupation, Sendler joined the Polish Underground, which aided Polish Jews. By then the Germans were deporting thousands of Jews to large-scale extermination camps on Polish soil, including Auschwitz and Treblinka.\n\nIn Warsaw, Sendler had a job with the social welfare department of the municipal government. In 1942, her work in the Polish Underground brought her to the newly formed Rada Pomocy Zydom, or Council for Aid to Jews, and known by the codename \u201cZegota.\u201d This was an organization to help Jews, funded in part by the Polish government in exile, and those who belonged to it risked their lives, for in Poland under German rule, if a family was found to be hiding a Jew, all occupants of the house were ordered to be put to death. In December of 1942, Sendler was made head of Zegota's children's division, and given the code name \u201cJolanta.\u201d\n\nWore Star of David\n\nEarlier, in 1940, Nazi officials in Warsaw had started walling off a section of the city that became known as the Warsaw Ghetto, in order to isolate the city's 400,000 Jews from the rest of the populace. Conditions in the Ghetto were abysmal, with food scarce and poor sanitation leading to outbreaks of deadly diseases. Because Sendler worked for the city government, she received a special permit that allowed her to come and go from the Ghetto. Whenever she passed through its heavily fortified checkpoints, she wore a Star of David on her clothing\u2014as all Jews in lands occupied by Nazi Germany were required to do by law\u2014in order to make her less noticeable to authorities in her secret line of work, and also to show solidarity with the Ghetto's residents.\n\nSendler also began to carry forged papers that listed her occupation as nurse, which gave her increased access to the Ghetto. This proved especially true when a typhoid fever outbreak occurred and few Germans wished to venture inside to provide aid; instead, they were happy to let Poles do the dangerous work. Sendler's real mission, however, was to search out families with young children in the Ghetto and convince the parents to let her take their children to safety on the outside. There were orphanages as well as families in both the city and countryside who were willing to hide Jewish children, and as word spread that Jews elsewhere were being deported to work camps\u2014which few realized were actually designed to exterminate Europe's Jewish populace via large-scale gas chambers\u2014Poles like Sendler realized that to rescue children from such a fate had now become an urgent humanitarian mission.\n\nSendler smuggled children out of the Ghetto by various means. Some buildings had secret basements with tunnels that connected to the outside; there was also a municipal court building that had doors on both the Jewish and \u201cAryan\u201d (non-Jewish) sides, and janitors who often looked the other way when such smuggling operations were being carried out. Often the children were hidden in tool boxes, crates, or other means and loaded onto trucks. Infants had to be quieted with medicine to keep them from crying and thus alerting guards at the checkpoints. There were also dogs who rode along on the truck and were trained to bark in order to cover up any suspicious noises.\n\nBuried Names in a Jar\n\nOnce safely outside the Ghetto, the children were taken to host families sympathetic to their plight, or to Roman Catholic orphanages whose nuns were willing to disguise the children as Gentiles. The children received new names, false identity papers, and were given instruction in Catholic rituals and prayers in order to help them blend in. Sendler told her charges, \u201cDo not remember your family, your ways or your one life; you must learn to survive,\u201d according to Kirk Shinkle in Investor's Business Daily. In order to keep track of the children who left the Ghetto and began living under new identities elsewhere, Sendler wrote down all the relevant information in a special code on used cigarette papers she collected. These lists of names were then put in jars and buried in the yard of a friend's house at 9 Ledarska Street in Warsaw.\n\nOn October 20, 1943, the Nazi secret police unit known as the Gestapo raided Sendler's apartment and arrested her. She was taken to Pawiak Prison in Warsaw, a notorious place from which few emerged alive. There she was tortured and her legs and feet broken. She received a death sentence, but on the way to the execution site a Zegota operative managed to bribe a German guard, and she was able to flee. Her name never left the list of those who had been shot that day, however, and after that point she was truly underground. She managed to continue her work, however, and when World War II finally ended in 1945, she hoped to reunite many of the 2,500 children taken out of the Ghetto with their parents. By that point, however, the Ghetto was largely empty, and she was devastated to learn that few of the parents whose names were on her list had survived the Holocaust. Most of the Ghetto families had died at the Treblinka death camp.\n\nHonored by Israel\n\nAfter the war, Poland became a Soviet ally and fell under one-party Communist rule. Though Sendler was able to reclaim her original identity, she suffered some harassment because she had worked with \u201cZegota\u201d, which had ties to the staunchly anti-Communist Polish government in exile. She married, but because of the campaign against her a son was born prematurely and did not survive. Most of her postwar career was spent helping to found orphanages and nursing homes, and she also worked for the Department of Education for a number of years. The first official recognition of her heroism came in 1965, when she was named one of the \u201cRighteous Among the Nations\u201d by Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority of Israel. In 2003 she was honored with the Order of the White Eagle, the highest civilian decoration in Poland. Four years later she was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nSendler's wartime heroism was the inspiration for an educational project in the United States that began in the late 1990s. A high school teacher in Pittsburg, Kansas, named Norm Conard assigned four students to research a brief U.S. News and World Report article that mentioned her as one of the war's forgotten names. Conard believed that the magazine had erred in claiming that Sendler had saved some 2,500 Jews, for this number was a good deal higher than the number rescued by Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist named who ran a factory in Krakow and saved 1,200 Jews. Schindler's story was well known, thanks to the 1993 film Schindler's List that won an Academy Award for Best Picture. The students affirmed that Sendler had indeed saved that many lives, and their report became the basis for a play they titled Life in a Jar. It has been performed in scores of schools in both the United States and Europe. The students were also astounded to learn that Sendler was still alive, though like many senior citizens in the post-Communist world she was living on a very meager income. They began a fundraising effort to send money to her, and a local business leader was so moved by their work that he sponsored their trip to Poland to meet her in person in May of 2001.\n\nSendler was living in a nursing home in 2006 when a German academic named Joachim Wieler visited her. Wieler told Derren Hayes for the journal Community Care that Sendler remained baffled by the attention to her wartime service. \u201cWhen you know that something is basically at stake, like real life, you do everything to save it. You don't talk about it and discuss it. You do it,\u201d she told Wieler. She also noted that there were many others who played a role in saving the children, adding \u201cI did not do it alone.\u201d\n\nSendler died on May 12, 2008, in Warsaw, Poland.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nCommunity Care, May 3, 2007.\n\nGuardian (London, England), March 15, 2007.\n\nInvestor's Business Daily, February 4, 2004.\n\nKansas City Star, May 30, 2002.\n\nNEA Today, September 2002.\n\nPretoria News (South Africa), May 17, 2007.\n\nOnline\n\n\u201cLife in a Jar: The Irena Sendler Project,\u201d Irenasendler.org, http://www.irenasendler.org/ (December 15, 2007)."}], "Irena Sendler saved the lives of 2,500 Jewish children by smuggling them out of the Warsaw Ghetto.": [{"url": "https://allthatsinteresting.com/irena-sendler", "page_content": "Irena Sendler even managed to survive torture by the Gestapo and a death sentence.\n\nAt the onset of World War II, the Germans outlawed helping Jews, making it punishable by death in Poland. And not only the death of the one offering assistance, but the death of their entire family.\n\nIrena Sendler was well aware of the danger, but that didn\u2019t stop her from risking everything to save the lives of over 2,000 Jewish children.\n\nA Fitting Heir To A Legacy Of Courage And Sacrifice\n\nRemembered today as \u201cthe female Oskar Schindler,\u201d Irena Sendler was an activist and outspoken critic of antisemitic policies long before the outbreak of World War II.\n\nLater, she would attribute the values that guided her work to her upbringing: \u201cI was taught by my father that when someone is drowning you don\u2019t ask if they can swim, you just jump in and help.\u201d\n\nHer father lived and died by his philosophy. He was a doctor to the poor, whom he often treated at no cost. It was on an errand of mercy that he contracted typhus from a patient. When he died, his daughter was just seven years old.\n\nThe Jewish community that he had so often practiced in offered financial support to his widow, but she turned them down, saying that she and her daughter would manage.\n\nAs she grew older, Irena Sendler proved herself a fitting heir to her parents\u2019 legacy. At school, she was a vocal critic of the system that segregated Jewish pupils from their non-Jewish counterparts during classes and lectures.\n\nShe frequently joined Jewish friends on the other side of the aisle, and when a Jewish friend was beaten, she crossed out the stamp on her grade card that marked her as a gentile and made the move permanent. The administration wasn\u2019t a fan; they suspended her for three years.\n\nForged Papers, Secret Supplies, And Smuggled Children\n\nAt the time of the German invasion of Poland, Irena Sendler was working for the Polish Social Welfare Department. When the Nazis came to power, she watched her Jewish coworkers turned away, dismissed from their jobs after years of service.\n\nThe entire Polish Social Welfare Department was then barred from helping any Polish Jews \u2014 they would be served by the institutions in their own communities, the Germans said.\n\nIrena Sendler wasn\u2019t going to let that stop her. She enlisted a group of supportive co-workers and began to created falsified papers that enabled her and her team to help Jewish families. Over four years, she fabricated 3,000 documents.\n\nShe continued to do so even when the stakes rose sharply in 1941: it was announced that the penalty for being found to have helped Polish Jews was death.\n\nIn 1943, Sendler joined the Zegota, an underground organization devoted to helping Jewish people escape the Holocaust. Under the fake name Jolanta, she was elected to head the Jewish children\u2019s section.\n\nBecause of her job with the Social Welfare Department, Sendler had authorization to enter the Warsaw Ghetto, the portion of the city where 300,000 Jews were being held captive.\n\nThough the Germans cared not at all for the lives of Polish Jews behind the ghetto\u2019s walls, they did fear typhus. Specifically, they worried that the deadly infectious fever could spread from inside the ghetto to the soldiers standing guard. So they allowed doctors in to check for symptoms and treat it.\n\nUnder the guise of performing these sanitation inspections, Irena Sendler would enter the ghettos, sneaking in food, medicine, and clothing. But she didn\u2019t leave empty-handed: in the ambulances and trams that drove away from the ghetto were babies and small children. When no other means were available, children were even loaded into packages and suitcases.\n\nOver 2,500 children were smuggled out of the ghettos, at least 400 of them by Sendler herself. She recalls heart-wrenching conversations as families decided whether to send their children out into the city, where discovery meant death.\n\nWhen parents asked Sendler whether she could promise that their children would be safe, she replied that she could not; she didn\u2019t even know whether she herself would make it out of the ghetto alive that day. All she could offer was the promise that she would never stop working on their behalf to protect and one day reunite them.\n\nPrayer Drills And Christian Training For Jewish Children\n\nOnce outside of the ghetto\u2019s confines, the smuggled children were dispersed among friends of the Zegota. Some were placed in the care of Christian Polish families and given Christian names. They were also taught Christian prayers and values in case they were tested.\n\nOne member of the Zegota remembers waking children at night and asking them to recite their prayers, drilling them endlessly so that they would remember them someday under pressure. These small proofs could be the difference between life and death.\n\nSome of the children were sent to the Warsaw orphanage of the Sisters of the Family of Mary or similar Roman Catholic convents and schools. They were also renamed and taught Christian traditons to mask their heritage.\n\nSendler\u2019s ultimate goal was to keep the children safe until the end of the war and then return them to their families, so she kept careful records of the children\u2019s whereabouts, new names, and given names. She kept the lists in jars buried underground.\n\nBut any hope for those someday reunions was growing dim. In July of 1942, the Nazis began what they called the Grossaktion, or Great Action. They had started to systematically round up the Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto and \u201cresettle them\u201d in the east. But the trains the Warsaw Jews boarded were bound for death camps.\n\nIrena Sendler, well known within the ghetto\u2019s walls, was forced to watch her friends disappear.\n\nThe Arrest And Torture Of Irena Sendler\n\nSendler was arrested in late 1943 and tortured by the Gestapo \u2014 and through it all, she managed to keep the children\u2019s identities safe. In the moments preceding her arrest, she was able to toss the documents she had with her to a friend, who concealed them in her clothes.\n\nIn the face of brutal beatings and captivity, Sendler never named any of her comrades or the children they saved.\n\nShe even managed to survive being sentenced to death. As the officers of the Gestapo were bringing her to her execution, fellow members of the Zegota saved her life with a last minute bribe.\n\nEven though her work had almost cost her her life, Sendler returned to her position with the Zegota after her escape, this time under a different name.\n\nAfter the war, Irena Sendler continued helping people by taking a job as a nurse. Despite the demands of her job, she still attempted to make good on her promise to return the children to their families. Sadly, she learned that almost all of the families had been killed at the Treblinka concentration camp or were missing.\n\nFor her efforts, Sendler was recognized by the state of Israel as one of the Righteous Among the Nations, an award created in 1963 for outstanding citizens. She was initially unable to go to Israel to receive it because of travel restrictions imposed by Poland\u2019s communist government \u2014 but finally, in 1983, the award made it to her.\n\nIn 2003, Pope John Paul II personally wrote to her to thank her for her efforts, and later that year, she received Poland\u2019s highest civilian honor, The Order of the White Eagle. She was also given the Jan Karski award for \u201cCourage and Heart\u201d by the American Center for Polish Culture.\n\nThough she\u2019s received countless other awards, Irena Sendler has remained humble about her contribution to the Jewish community.\n\n\u201cI was brought up to believe that a person must be rescued when drowning, regardless of religion and nationality,\u201d she said in a 2007 interview, one year before her death at age 98.\n\n\u201cThe term \u2018hero\u2019 irritates me greatly. The opposite is true. I continue to have pangs of conscience that I did so little.\u201d\n\nAfter this look at Irena Sendler and her amazing heroism during the Holocaust, read about Ilse Koch, the concentration camp guard who was called \u201cthe bitch of Buchenwald.\u201d Then, check out Inga Arvad, the girlfriend that Adolf Hitler and John F. Kennedy had in common."}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/activist/irena-sendler", "page_content": "(1910-2008)\n\nWho Was Irena Sendler?\n\nWhen the Nazis invaded in 1939, Irena Sendler was a social worker and so had access to the Warsaw Ghetto, where hundreds of thousands of Jews were imprisoned. As a member of \u017begota (aka Konrad \u017begota Committee, the Council to Aid Jews), she helped rescue 2,500 Jewish children from the ghetto. For her courageous actions during the Holocaust, in 1965, Israel\u2019s Yad Vashem honored her as \u201cRighteous Among the Nations.\u201d Sendler died in Warsaw in 2008.\n\nEarly Life\n\nSendler was born Irena Krzy\u017canowska on February 15, 1910, in Otwock, Poland. Her parents were members of the Polish Socialist Party, and her father, Stanis\u0142aw Krzy\u017canowski was a medical doctor who died of typhus when Sendler was a child. In 1931 Sendler married Mieczys\u0142aw Sendler, and the couple moved to Warsaw before the outbreak of World War II.\n\nWarsaw Ghetto\n\nIn Warsaw, Sendler became a social worker, overseeing the city\u2019s \u201ccanteens,\u201d which provided assistance to people in need. When the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939, Sendler and her colleagues also used the canteens to provide medicine, clothing and other necessities to the city\u2019s persecuted Jewish population.\n\nIn 1940, the Nazis forced Warsaw\u2019s more than 400,000 Jewish residents into a small locked ghetto area, where thousands died every month from disease and starvation. As a social worker, Sendler was able to enter the ghetto regularly to help the residents and soon joined \u017begota, the Council to Aid Jews. Putting themselves at great risk, she and about two dozen of her colleagues set out to save as many Jewish children as possible from death in the ghetto or deportation to concentration camps.\n\n\u017begota began by saving Jewish orphans. They had several ways of smuggling them out of the ghetto: Some were carried out in caskets or potato sacks; others left in ambulances or snuck out through underground tunnels. Still others entered the Jewish side of a Catholic church that straddled the ghetto boundary and left on the other side with new identities. Sendler then helped place the children at convents or with non-Jewish families.\n\nAs the situation became more dire for the ghetto\u2019s inhabitants, Sendler went beyond rescuing orphans and began asking parents to let her try to get their children to safety. Although she couldn\u2019t guarantee the children\u2019s survival, she could tell parents that their children would at least have a chance. Sendler kept detailed records and lists of the children she helped buried in a jar. Her plan was to reunite the rescued children and their parents after the war. However, most of the parents did not survive.\n\nOn October 20, 1943, the Nazis arrested Sendler and sent her to Pawiak Prison. There they tortured her, trying to get her to reveal the names of her associates. She refused and was sentenced to death. However, \u017begota members bribed the prison guards, and Sendler was released in February 1944.\n\nSendler continued her work until the war ended, by which time she and her colleagues had rescued some 2,500 children. It has been estimated that Sendler personally saved about 400.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nAfter the war, Sendler\u2019s first marriage ended in divorce. In 1947 she married Stefan Zgrzembski, with whom she had three children, daughter Janka, and sons Andrzej (who died in infancy) and Adam. After the death of Zgrzembski, Sendler remarried her first husband, Mieczys\u0142aw Sendler, but their reunion didn't last and they again divorced.\n\nHonors and Awards\n\nIn 1965, Yad Vashem, Israel\u2019s Holocaust memorial organization, named Sendler as Righteous Among the Nations for her work saving Jewish children. In 2003, Poland honored her with its Order of the White Eagle. In 2008, Sendler was nominated for (but did not win) a Nobel Peace Prize. The story of her life was also captured in a 2009 TV movie The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler, which starred Anna Paquin in the title role.\n\nDeath\n\nSendler died on May 12, 2008, in Warsaw, Poland, at the age of 98.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nBirth Year: 1910\n\nBirth date: February 15, 1910\n\nBirth City: Otwock\n\nBirth Country: Poland\n\nGender: Female\n\nBest Known For: Irena Sendler was a Polish social worker who, during World War II, helped to rescue 2,500 Jewish children from the Warsaw Ghetto, and placed them in convents or with non-Jewish families.\n\nAstrological Sign: Aquarius\n\nDeath Year: 2008\n\nDeath date: May 12, 2008\n\nDeath City: Warsaw\n\nDeath Country: Poland\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION"}, {"url": "https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/irena-sendler", "page_content": "When Hitler and his Nazis built the Warsaw Ghetto and herded 500,000 Polish Jews behind its walls to await liquidation, Irena Sendler defied the Nazis and saved 2,500 Jewish children by smuggling them out of the Warsaw Ghetto. As a health worker, she sneaked the children out between 1942 and 1943 to safe hiding places and found non-Jewish families to adopt them.\n\nHer achievement went largely unnoticed for many years. Then the story was uncovered by four young students at Uniontown High School, in Kansas, who were the winners of the 2000 Kansas state National History Day competition by writing a play Life in a Jar about the heroic actions of Irena Sendler. The girls - Elizabeth Cambers, Megan Stewart, Sabrina Coons and Janice Underwood - have since gained international recognition, along with their teacher, Norman Conard. The presentation, seen in many venues in the United States and popularized by National Public Radio, C-SPAN and CBS, has brought Irena Sendler's story to a wider public.\n\nSendler was born in 1910 in Otwock, a town some 15 miles southeast of Warsaw. She was greatly influenced by her father who was one of the first Polish Socialists. As a doctor his patients were mostly poor Jews.\n\nIn 1939, Germany invaded Poland, and the brutality of the Nazis accelerated with murder, violence and terror.\n\nAt the time, Irena was a Senior Administrator in the Warsaw Social Welfare Department, which operated the canteens in every district of the city. Previously, the canteens provided meals, financial aid, and other services for orphans, the elderly, the poor and the destitute. Now, through Irena, the canteens also provided clothing, medicine and money for the Jews. They were registered under fictitious Christian names, and to prevent inspections, the Jewish families were reported as being afflicted with such highly infectious diseases as typhus and tuberculosis.\n\nBut in 1942, the Nazis herded hundreds of thousands of Jews into a 16-block area that came to be known as the Warsaw Ghetto. The Ghetto was sealed and the Jewish families ended up behind its walls, only to await certain death.\n\nSendler was so appalled by the conditions that she joined Zegota, the Council for Aid to Jews, organized by the Polish underground resistance movement, as one of its first recruits and directed the efforts to rescue Jewish children.\n\nTo be able to enter the Ghetto legally, Irena managed to be issued a pass from Warsaws Epidemic Control Department and she visited the Ghetto daily, reestablished contacts and brought food, medicines and clothing. But 5,000 people were dying a month from starvation and disease in the Ghetto, and she decided to help the Jewish children to get out.\n\nFor Sendler, a young mother herself, persuading parents to part with their children was in itself a horrendous task. Finding families willing to shelter the children, and thereby willing to risk their life if the Nazis ever found out, was also not easy.\n\nSendler, who wore a star armband as a sign of her solidarity to Jews, began smuggling children out in an ambulance. She recruited at least one person from each of the ten centers of the Social Welfare Department. With their help, she issued hundreds of false documents with forged signatures and successfully smuggled almost 2,500 Jewish children to safety and gave them temporary new identities.\n\nSome children were taken out in gunnysacks or body bags. Some were buried inside loads of goods. A mechanic took a baby out in his toolbox. Some kids were carried out in potato sacks, others were placed in coffins, some entered a church in the Ghetto which had two entrances. One entrance opened into the Ghetto, the other opened into the Aryan side of Warsaw. They entered the church as Jews and exited as Christians. \"Can you guarantee they will live?\" Irena later recalled the distraught parents asking. But she could only guarantee they would die if they stayed. \"In my dreams,\" she said, \"I still hear the cries when they left their parents.\"\n\nIrena Sendler accomplished her incredible deeds with the active assistance of the church. \"I sent most of the children to religious establishments,\" she recalled. \"I knew I could count on the Sisters.\" Irena also had a remarkable record of cooperation when placing the youngsters: \"No one ever refused to take a child from me,\" she said.\n\nThe children were given false identities and placed in homes, orphanages and convents. Sendler carefully noted, in coded form, the children's original names and their new identities. She kept the only record of their true identities in jars buried beneath an apple tree in a neighbor's back yard, across the street from German barracks, hoping she could someday dig up the jars, locate the children and inform them of their past. In all, the jars contained the names of 2,500 children.\n\nBut the Nazis became aware of Irena's activities, and on October 20, 1943 she was arrested, imprisoned and tortured by the Gestapo, who broke her feet and legs. She ended up in the Pawiak Prison, but no one could break her spirit. Though she was the only one who knew the names and addresses of the families sheltering the Jewish children, she withstood the torture, refusing to betray either her associates or any of the Jewish children in hiding.\n\nSentenced to death, Irena was saved at the last minute when Zegota members bribed one of the Germans to halt the execution. She escaped from prison but for the rest of the war she was pursued by the Gestapo.\n\nAfter the war she dug up the jars and used the notes to track down the 2,500 children she placed with adoptive families and to reunite them with relatives scattered across Europe. But most lost their families during the Holocaust in Nazi death camps.\n\nThe children had known her only by her code name Jolanta. But years later, after she was honored for her wartime work, her picture appeared in a newspaper. \"A man, a painter, telephoned me,\" said Sendler, \"`I remember your face,' he said. `It was you who took me out of the ghetto.' I had many calls like that!\"\n\nIrena Sendler did not think of herself as a hero. She claimed no credit for her actions. \"I could have done more,\" she said. \"This regret will follow me to my death.\"\n\nShe has been honored by international Jewish organizations - in 1965 she accorded the title of Righteous Among the Nations by the Yad Vashem organization in Jerusalem and in 1991 she was made an honorary citizen of Israel.\n\nIrena Sendler was awarded Poland's highest distinction, the Order of White Eagle in Warsaw Monday Nov. 10, 2003.\n\nThis lovely, courageous woman was one of the most dedicated and active workers in aiding Jews during the Nazi occupation of Poland. Her courage enabled not only the survival of 2,500 Jewish children but also of the generations of their descendants.\n\nShe passed away on May 12, 2008, at the age of 98."}, {"url": "https://www.neh.gov/article/irena-sendler-and-girls-kansas", "page_content": "Between 1942 and 1943, Sendler and her network of 10 compatriots rescued 2,500 Jewish children from the Warsaw ghetto. Disguised as an infection-control nurse, Sendler knocked on doors in the ghetto, asking parents and grandparents to give up their children and grandchildren so that she could smuggle them out. Each child was given a new Polish name and forged identity papers and hidden in foster homes, orphanages, or convents. Sendler insisted that lists of the children be kept, documenting their Jewish and Polish names, so that after the war they would know their original identities. She hid the lists in milk jars that were buried in the backyard of one of her co-conspirators.\n\nPhoto caption A young Irena Sendler, in Warsaw, circa 1930. \u2014 AF Fotografie / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAfter the war, Poland\u2019s Communist government persecuted members of Poland\u2019s wartime resistance, Zegota, of which Sendler was a part.

Almost no one knew of Sendler and her heroism.\n\nShe would have remained an unsung hero were it not for three teenage American girls who discovered her forgotten story 60 years later. Liz, Megan, and Sabrina, who began as students of history for a National History Day competition, became recorders of history, championing Sendler\u2019s legacy in Poland, the U.S., and around the world.

I read the short paragraph below the photo:\n\nIrena Sendlerowa, (1916\u2013UNKNOWN) As head of the children\u2019s division of Zegota, the Polish underground Council for Aid to Jews, social worker Irena Sendlerowa (code name \u201cJolanta\u201d) helped smuggle more than 2,500 Jewish children out of the Warsaw ghetto. Hiding them in orphanages, convents, schools, hospitals, and private homes, she provided each child with a new identity, carefully recording in code their Jewish names and placements so that surviving relatives could find them after the war. Arrested by the Gestapo in the fall of 1943, Sendlerowa was sentenced to death. Zegota rescued her before her execution. She assumed a new identity and continued her work for Zegota.\n\nI was stunned. I\u2019m a child of Holocaust survivors. How could I not know Irena Sendler\u2019s story? Everybody knows Oskar Schindler, who rescued 1,100 Jews from a German concentration camp in Poland and whose story was told in the Steven Spielberg film Schindler\u2019s List. Even at the USHMM, the preeminent scholars of the Holocaust didn\u2019t know much about Sendler. They had her birth year wrong (it was 1910, I later found out), and they didn\u2019t know if she was still alive.\n\nI kept this calendar in a file labeled \u201cInteresting Stuff.\u201d And there it sat for almost three years.\n\nPhoto caption These children rescued by Sendler were sent to live with new identities at a Polish convent, circa 1943. \u2014 World History Archive / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nThen, in February 2004, I came into my office one night to see a sick child. On my desk someone had left a copy of the Ladies Home Journal, opened to an article, \u201cThe Woman Who Loved Children.\u201d It was about Irena Sendler and three Kansas teens who uncovered her story. The article explained that, in 1999, while planning a National History Day project, they found a brief reference to Sendler in a U.S. News and World Report article entitled \u201cThe Other Schindlers.\u201d Sendler\u2019s story inspired their NHD project: a play they wrote and performed called Life in a Jar. It retold, in dramatic form, the emotional story of Sendler knocking on ghetto doors and asking Jewish parents to give up their children to save them. The title, Life in a Jar, refers to the lists Sendler buried.\n\nThe teens read that Irena had been arrested in 1943 by the Gestapo and tortured in Pawiak Prison, the most notorious prison in the ghetto, from which almost no one escaped. Logically, they began searching cemetery records and reached out to the Jewish Foundation for the Righteous, seeking information about where she might be buried. Soon after, they received a letter from the foundation, saying that Sendler was alive! She was in her nineties and living in poverty with her daughter-in-law in Warsaw. The foundation then put them in touch with Sendler.\n\nThe three students made plans to travel to Poland and meet Sendler, first trying to raise money through candy sales, until philanthropists and Holocaust survivors from the Kansas City Jewish community stepped in to help cover the trip. Traveling out of the country for the first time (the first time on a plane for one of them), the girls finally met Sendler at her Warsaw home in 2001. They maintained a tender friendship with her for the next seven years until she passed, making several trips to Poland to visit her, each time performing Life in a Jar at various venues. And they began working with Polish high school students who were telling the forgotten stories of rescuers from their own communities.\n\nPhoto caption The original three students\u2014Liz,Megan, and Sabrina\u2014are joined by Jessica Shelton-Ripper (third from left), who performed many times with Life in a Jar.

This story now took on a new dimension. I have been a closet writer most of my life, and I was thinking about writing a novella about the Warsaw ghetto. Irena Sendler seemed like a compelling character, and I wanted to know more about her. I was also intrigued by the two stories\u2014Irena\u2019s wartime history and the contemporary story of three Kansas teens. I called their teacher in Kansas, Norm Conard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s serendipitous that you should call,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for someone to write these two stories.\u201d\n\nI hesitated. I had not written nonfiction before, only fiction and poetry. But I felt the powerful synergy of these two stories. I was not eager to write a wartime history of a Holocaust hero because most Holocaust literature leaves me angry, sad, depressed, and frustrated. But this story was different\u2014an inspiring story of three typical American teenagers who helped restore the history of a great hero.\n\nI agreed to write the story and, in 2004, visited Uniontown, Kansas, where the girls went to school. A small town with a population of 264, it was down on its luck. Many stores were shuttered. It had the look of a Dorothea Lange or Walker Evans black-and-white photo from the Depression. I met Norm and the girls at the high school, and I was hooked.\n\nUniontown High School, with only about 120 students, is one of the lowest-income school districts in Kansas. There was no diversity in the school\u2014never a Jew, an African American, or even a Catholic\u2014yet these teens had discovered Sendler\u2019s story and told the world. I spent a week interviewing the students, their families, their teacher, community members, and Holocaust survivors from Kansas City who had taken a great interest in the play and the Irena Sendler project.\n\nMy wife and I accompanied the students and Conard to Poland on their third visit, in 2005. I was able to do more extensive research and interview Sendler, Holocaust scholars, and some of the children Sendler had rescued, now in their sixties and seventies. We met Elzbieta Ficowska, rescued as a six-month-old infant. Sendler had sedated her and put her in a carpenter\u2019s box. Her parents kissed their baby good-bye and left a small spoon in the box with her name inscribed on one side and her birthdate on the other. It is the only memento of her parents, who were murdered at Treblinka. She and I have become good friends, and I have held her spoon many times, always with tears. Ficowska became one of Sendler\u2019s caregivers and the chairperson of the Association of Children of the Holocaust in Poland.\n\nIt was Sendler\u2019s ninety-fifth birthday when I interviewed her. She was energetic, and her memory was clear and specific. She wanted to be sure that I credited all of her network of rescuers and liaisons. She ensured that I had everyone\u2019s name spelled correctly.\n\nPhoto caption Megan took this picture of Sendler on May 3, 2008, during a visit to Poland. Sendler passed away nine days later on May 12. \u2014 Megan Felt\n\nPoland was arguably the most victimized country in occupied Europe. The consequence for hiding or even feeding a Jew was execution, often in public as a warning to other Poles. When I asked Sendler why she put herself and her family at such risk, she said, \u201cIt was a need of my heart.\u201d She rejected the appellation of hero. \u201cI only did what any decent person would do. . . . The heroes were the babies\u2014they were the heroes of their mothers\u2019 hearts. . . . It was the parents and grandparents who gave up their children, they were the true heroes.\u201d\n\nShe said it was her father\u2019s teaching that inspired her. \u201cIf you see someone drowning you must rescue them, even if you cannot swim.\u201d And \u201cthere are only two kinds of people in the world, good and bad, regardless of race, religion, or creed. And most people are good.\u201d\n\nShe lamented that she had not done enough\u2014for every child they saved almost one hundred went to their deaths at Treblinka.\n\nSendler has become a Polish national hero. Poles have been eager to tell their stories, in part because the Life in a Jar project stimulated Polish/Jewish dialog as well as scholarship about Poland during the German occupation. Although there has been a disturbing return of anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial in Poland, Sendler\u2019s story continues to be told.\n\nYad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Jerusalem, recognizes more Righteous Gentiles\u2014those who rescued out of principle, not for personal gain\u2014from Poland than from any other country in occupied Europe. In 2019, it listed 27,362 Righteous Gentiles, with 6,992 from Poland, or around 26 percent. But because of postwar Poland\u2019s Communist anti-Semitism, Polish rescuers who had received Yad Vashem medals hid them and told no one of their wartime activities.\n\nAt one performance of Life in a Jar in Warsaw, I sat beside an old man, old enough to have been an adult during the war. Throughout the performance he sat with his hands together, clutching something inside. After the performance I asked him about it, and he opened his hands to reveal his Yad Vashem medal. There were tears in his eyes as he explained, \u201cI have kept this buried in my basement for 60 years. I told no one except my wife. I didn\u2019t tell my children, family, friends, or coworkers. Now, because of these American students, I can show this proudly. It was the finest thing I have ever done.\u201d\n\nMy first time in Warsaw, in 2005, I could find few markers of the Warsaw ghetto and no commemoration of the wall. In my research for the book, I found no reference to Irena Sendler before 2000 other than by Yad Vashem (1965 Righteous Gentile medal, and in 1983 a tree planted in her honor next to that of Raoul Wallenberg) and the U.S. News and World Report article that launched the Kansas teens on their National History Day project.\n\nWhen I returned in 2013 for the release of the Polish translation of my 2011 book Life in a Jar: The Irena Sendler Project (also translated into Russian, Chinese, and Mongolian), I saw how much had changed in Poland. Where there had been no markers of the wall, now there is a footprint, 10 inches wide that says, \u201cMUR GETTA/GHETTO WALL 1940\u20131943,\u201d placed in sidewalks and lawns showing the exact location of the ghetto wall. At each of the 22 gates there is a memorial plaque with a map and description of what happened in the ghetto.\n\nThere are now 35 Irena Sendler schools in Poland, three in Germany, one in France, and one in England. I have met to discuss Sendler with Poland\u2019s Deputy Foreign Secretary Jerzy Pomianowski, given radio, TV, and print interviews, and met with a journalist from the Catholic News Agency. The Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw opened in 2014, and the Lowell Milken Center Europe, a Polish office of the Irena Sendler/Life in a Jar Foundation, works with Polish teens on similar projects.\n\nThe project changed Poland as well as the American students who started it all. From my time with the Kansas teens, I learned that each girl knew something about losing or almost losing their own parent. Liz was abandoned by her parents as a young child and raised by her grandparents, Megan\u2019s mother developed cancer, and Sabrina\u2019s mother suddenly died during the project. The girls courageously allowed me to tell their own painful stories in my book. And it became clear to me that the last three children Irena Sendler rescued were the girls from Kansas.\n\nToday, Elizabeth Cambers Hutton has two master\u2019s degrees and teaches Holocaust history in Missouri. Sabrina Coons-Murphy is an elementary schoolteacher in Kansas. Megan Stewart Felt, the program coordinator for the Irena Sendler/Life in a Jar Foundation, still works with Norm Conard to further Sendler\u2019s legacy and continues to play Sendler in performances of Life in a Jar.\n\nThe story has also changed me. I am a German-American Jew, born after the war to parents who narrowly escaped the Holocaust. Others in my family did not. For the first five years of my life I lived in upper Manhattan, in Washington Heights\u2014an urban shtetl of German Jews who had survived the Holocaust. I didn\u2019t speak English until I was five years old. The Holocaust was the baffling but iconic story of my childhood, a subject of nervous, hushed, adult conversation. It was frightening, mysterious, impossible to grasp, yet everywhere\u2014it was the atmosphere. There was an awkward gracelessness on the part of those who lived through it, a furtiveness I now understand to be a kind of PTSD. It was the unacknowledged elephant in the living room\u2014huge but shrouded.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was in my twenties that I learned that my grandfather had been arrested on Kristallnacht, November 9, 1938, and imprisoned in Dachau. My grandmother went to high school with one of the administrative guards at Dachau. He accepted a bribe from her, and my grandfather was released after six months. In 1999, my parents were interviewed as part of Steven Spielberg\u2019s Shoah project. In the course of the interview my mother brought out her identity papers, marked \u201cJew,\u201d and her nursing certificate, stamped with a swastika. My brother and I had never seen these artifacts.\n\nGrowing up as a child of survivors, I had a sense of mission about the Holocaust, but didn\u2019t know how that would manifest. Now in my seventies, I find that in writing Life in a Jar, and speaking about it to new audiences, I am fulfilling that mission.\n\nIn my talks, sponsored by the Vermont Humanities Council, I emphasize how Sendler and the girls from Kansas were repairing the world\u2014tikkun olam in Hebrew. Few of us would have the courage to do what Sendler did, but all of us can do what Liz, Megan, and Sabrina did\u2014performing small acts of decency and respect for all people. Acts that change the world."}, {"url": "https://aboutholocaust.org/en/facts/who-was-irena-sendler-and-why-did-she-smuggle-jewish-children-out-of-the-warsaw-ghetto", "page_content": "Irena Sendler (1910-2008) was a Polish social worker who helped Jews in Warsaw throughout the German occupation. She became a leading activist in Zegota after it was established in autumn 1942. From 1943, as head of the Children\u2019s Section, she used her contacts with orphanages and other institutions to find hiding places for children. The exact number of children she saved through this work is unknown, but estimates have ranged as high as 2,500.\n\nSendler was just 29 when the Germans occupied Warsaw at the beginning of WW2. She risked her life to gain access to the Warsaw Ghetto after it was sealed in November 1940, obtaining a permit to inspect sanitary conditions. She used her access to help smuggle people out of the ghetto. When Zegota was established after the \u201cGreat Deportation\u201d of summer 1942, Sendler became a leading activist, working to smuggle survivors out and establish hiding places for them.\n\nIn September 1943, Sendler was appointed head of the Children\u2019s Section, and helped place children abandoned after the final destruction of the ghetto in orphanages and religious institutions in and around the cities of Warsaw and Lublin. She was arrested, tortured and sentenced to death in the Pawiak prison in October 1943. She was released in February 1944 after the Polish underground secured her release by bribing officials. After her release, Sendler continued to work for the resistance, after a brief period in hiding. When asked to explain her actions, she replied: \u201cI was taught by my father that when someone is drowning you don\u2019t ask if they can swim, you just jump in and help.\u201d She was awarded the title of Righteous Among the Nations in 1965.

Coming up the stairs were nine Nazi soldiers, ready to arrest her for her work with the Polish underground. Sendler would be sent to the notorious Pawiak prison; there she was tortured to divulge the names of her co-conspirators and to reveal the contents of that package. The little parcel contained a list of the true identities of thousands of Jewish children whom Sendler and her team had smuggled out of the Warsaw Ghetto in 1942 and 1943, hiding them among non-Jewish families.\n\nBorn in 1910, Irena Sendler was a Catholic employee of the Warsaw Social Welfare Department when the Nazis herded hundreds of thousands of Jews into the 16-block ghetto. Joining Zegota, the Council for Aid to Jews led by the Polish underground resistance movement, Sendler enlisted workers in each of the ten centers of the Welfare Department to issue hundreds of forged documents to create new identities for Jewish children.\n\nSendler had agonizing discussions persuading Jewish parents to part with their children and Christian parents to shelter them; all were risking their lives if they were discovered. Some children were smuggled out in gunnysacks and bodybags, others in a mechanic\u2019s toolbox, in ambulances, and even coffins.\n\nSendler enlisted the active assistance of the Church in her work. Some children were taken in one door of a church in the ghetto and emerged through another door in the free zone, exiting with new Christian identities. Irena carefully noted the true names and family members of the youngsters in code and buried the list in jars under a neighbor\u2019s apple tree, hoping to one day dig up the jars and reunite the families.\n\nThe list was in the parcel Sendler threw out the window that day, re-buried by her compatriot. Some 2,500 children\u2019s names were in the jars.\n\nIn Pawiak prison, the Nazi soldiers broke Sendler\u2019s feet and legs, crippling her for life in their efforts to pry information from her. Sentenced to death, she escaped when her helpers bribed a Nazi guard and remained on the run for the rest of the war. When peace came, she dug up the jars again and used her notes to track down the children she had rescued; many had parents who were killed in the Holocaust. She never considered herself a heroine. \u201cI could have done more,\u201d she said later. \u201cThis regret will follow me to my death...Every child saved with my help is the justification of my existence on this Earth, and not a title to glory.\u201d\n\nIn 1965, Irena Sendler was accorded the title of The Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem in Jerusalem. But her achievement was barely recognized elsewhere until in 1999 a group of four Kansas students wrote a play about her, Life in a Jar, for their National History Day competition. The students won the state championship, and almost fifteen years later, the play is still performed, spreading the story of Irena Sendler to audiences across the country.\n\nSources: \u201cIrena Sendler,\u201d Auschwitz Online Resource; \u201cIrena Sendler,\u201dJewish Virtual Library; \u201cIrena Sendler: In the Name of Their Mothers,\u201d PBS; New York Times obituary, May13, 2008.\n\nVisit \u201cLife in a Jar\u201d for more information about the play."}, {"url": "https://www.haaretz.com/2008-05-12/ty-article/irena-sendler-who-saved-2-500-jews-from-holocaust-dies-at-98/0000017f-e70d-d62c-a1ff-ff7f2e2d0001", "page_content": "Irena Sendler - a Polish social worker who helped save some 2,500 Jewish children from the Nazis by smuggling them out of the Warsaw Ghetto and giving them false identities - has died.

At the time, Poland was occupied by Nazi troops, and Sendler risked her own life many times over to smuggle young children out of the Warsaw Ghetto, where thousands of the city's Jews were walled in. Honored decades later for her work, Sendler scoffed at the idea that she had behaved heroically as one of the small number of Gentiles who helped rescue Jews from death camps. \u201cThe term \u2018hero\u2019 irritates me greatly,\u201d a report by Kate Connolly in the London Guardian quoted her as saying. \u201cThe opposite is true. I continue to have pangs of conscience that I did so little.\u201d\n\nBorn on February 15, 1910, in Warsaw, Sendler grew up both there and in a small town called Otwock, about 25 miles southeast of the city. During her childhood, Poland belonged to imperial Russia, and her family were practicing Roman Catholics, the predominant religion in the area along with the Jewish faith. Her father was a humanitarian-minded physician who treated Jews in Otwock during typhus outbreaks when other doctors refused to do so. He later died from the disease when Sendler was seven years old. She later recalled that it was a proverb often repeated by her father that served as the inspiration for her own actions: \u201cIf you see a person drowning,\u201d she told Norman Conard in NEA Today, \u201cyou must jump into the water to save them, whether you can swim or not.\u201d\n\nJoined Resistance Movement\n\nAs a young woman, Sendler entered the field of social work, and was 29 years old when World War II broke out in the late summer of 1939. The origin of the conflict was Nazi Germany's occupation of Poland. Horrified by the Nazis' anti-Semitic policies already in place in Germany and now being implemented in Poland under the occupation, Sendler joined the Polish Underground, which aided Polish Jews. By then the Germans were deporting thousands of Jews to large-scale extermination camps on Polish soil, including Auschwitz and Treblinka.\n\nIn Warsaw, Sendler had a job with the social welfare department of the municipal government. In 1942, her work in the Polish Underground brought her to the newly formed Rada Pomocy Zydom, or Council for Aid to Jews, and known by the codename \u201cZegota.\u201d This was an organization to help Jews, funded in part by the Polish government in exile, and those who belonged to it risked their lives, for in Poland under German rule, if a family was found to be hiding a Jew, all occupants of the house were ordered to be put to death. In December of 1942, Sendler was made head of Zegota's children's division, and given the code name \u201cJolanta.\u201d\n\nWore Star of David\n\nEarlier, in 1940, Nazi officials in Warsaw had started walling off a section of the city that became known as the Warsaw Ghetto, in order to isolate the city's 400,000 Jews from the rest of the populace. Conditions in the Ghetto were abysmal, with food scarce and poor sanitation leading to outbreaks of deadly diseases. Because Sendler worked for the city government, she received a special permit that allowed her to come and go from the Ghetto. Whenever she passed through its heavily fortified checkpoints, she wore a Star of David on her clothing\u2014as all Jews in lands occupied by Nazi Germany were required to do by law\u2014in order to make her less noticeable to authorities in her secret line of work, and also to show solidarity with the Ghetto's residents.\n\nSendler also began to carry forged papers that listed her occupation as nurse, which gave her increased access to the Ghetto. This proved especially true when a typhoid fever outbreak occurred and few Germans wished to venture inside to provide aid; instead, they were happy to let Poles do the dangerous work. Sendler's real mission, however, was to search out families with young children in the Ghetto and convince the parents to let her take their children to safety on the outside. There were orphanages as well as families in both the city and countryside who were willing to hide Jewish children, and as word spread that Jews elsewhere were being deported to work camps\u2014which few realized were actually designed to exterminate Europe's Jewish populace via large-scale gas chambers\u2014Poles like Sendler realized that to rescue children from such a fate had now become an urgent humanitarian mission.\n\nSendler smuggled children out of the Ghetto by various means. Some buildings had secret basements with tunnels that connected to the outside; there was also a municipal court building that had doors on both the Jewish and \u201cAryan\u201d (non-Jewish) sides, and janitors who often looked the other way when such smuggling operations were being carried out. Often the children were hidden in tool boxes, crates, or other means and loaded onto trucks. Infants had to be quieted with medicine to keep them from crying and thus alerting guards at the checkpoints. There were also dogs who rode along on the truck and were trained to bark in order to cover up any suspicious noises.\n\nBuried Names in a Jar\n\nOnce safely outside the Ghetto, the children were taken to host families sympathetic to their plight, or to Roman Catholic orphanages whose nuns were willing to disguise the children as Gentiles. The children received new names, false identity papers, and were given instruction in Catholic rituals and prayers in order to help them blend in. Sendler told her charges, \u201cDo not remember your family, your ways or your one life; you must learn to survive,\u201d according to Kirk Shinkle in Investor's Business Daily. In order to keep track of the children who left the Ghetto and began living under new identities elsewhere, Sendler wrote down all the relevant information in a special code on used cigarette papers she collected. These lists of names were then put in jars and buried in the yard of a friend's house at 9 Ledarska Street in Warsaw.\n\nOn October 20, 1943, the Nazi secret police unit known as the Gestapo raided Sendler's apartment and arrested her. She was taken to Pawiak Prison in Warsaw, a notorious place from which few emerged alive. There she was tortured and her legs and feet broken. She received a death sentence, but on the way to the execution site a Zegota operative managed to bribe a German guard, and she was able to flee. Her name never left the list of those who had been shot that day, however, and after that point she was truly underground. She managed to continue her work, however, and when World War II finally ended in 1945, she hoped to reunite many of the 2,500 children taken out of the Ghetto with their parents. By that point, however, the Ghetto was largely empty, and she was devastated to learn that few of the parents whose names were on her list had survived the Holocaust. Most of the Ghetto families had died at the Treblinka death camp.\n\nHonored by Israel\n\nAfter the war, Poland became a Soviet ally and fell under one-party Communist rule. Though Sendler was able to reclaim her original identity, she suffered some harassment because she had worked with \u201cZegota\u201d, which had ties to the staunchly anti-Communist Polish government in exile. She married, but because of the campaign against her a son was born prematurely and did not survive. Most of her postwar career was spent helping to found orphanages and nursing homes, and she also worked for the Department of Education for a number of years. The first official recognition of her heroism came in 1965, when she was named one of the \u201cRighteous Among the Nations\u201d by Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority of Israel. In 2003 she was honored with the Order of the White Eagle, the highest civilian decoration in Poland. Four years later she was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nSendler's wartime heroism was the inspiration for an educational project in the United States that began in the late 1990s. A high school teacher in Pittsburg, Kansas, named Norm Conard assigned four students to research a brief U.S. News and World Report article that mentioned her as one of the war's forgotten names. Conard believed that the magazine had erred in claiming that Sendler had saved some 2,500 Jews, for this number was a good deal higher than the number rescued by Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist named who ran a factory in Krakow and saved 1,200 Jews. Schindler's story was well known, thanks to the 1993 film Schindler's List that won an Academy Award for Best Picture. The students affirmed that Sendler had indeed saved that many lives, and their report became the basis for a play they titled Life in a Jar. It has been performed in scores of schools in both the United States and Europe. The students were also astounded to learn that Sendler was still alive, though like many senior citizens in the post-Communist world she was living on a very meager income. They began a fundraising effort to send money to her, and a local business leader was so moved by their work that he sponsored their trip to Poland to meet her in person in May of 2001.\n\nSendler was living in a nursing home in 2006 when a German academic named Joachim Wieler visited her. Wieler told Derren Hayes for the journal Community Care that Sendler remained baffled by the attention to her wartime service. \u201cWhen you know that something is basically at stake, like real life, you do everything to save it. You don't talk about it and discuss it. You do it,\u201d she told Wieler. She also noted that there were many others who played a role in saving the children, adding \u201cI did not do it alone.\u201d\n\nSendler died on May 12, 2008, in Warsaw, Poland.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nCommunity Care, May 3, 2007.\n\nGuardian (London, England), March 15, 2007.\n\nInvestor's Business Daily, February 4, 2004.\n\nKansas City Star, May 30, 2002.\n\nNEA Today, September 2002.\n\nPretoria News (South Africa), May 17, 2007.\n\nOnline\n\n\u201cLife in a Jar: The Irena Sendler Project,\u201d Irenasendler.org, http://www.irenasendler.org/ (December 15, 2007)."}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL12654106", "page_content": "(Fixes typo in paragraph 12)\n\n(Adds Yad Vashem statement)\n\nWARSAW, May 12 (Reuters) - Irena Sendler, a Polish woman who saved thousands of Jewish children during World War Two by smuggling them out of the Warsaw Ghetto, died in the Polish capital on Monday after a long illness, local media said.\n\nIsrael's Holocaust remembrance authority, Yad Vashem, said in a statement that it mourned her death.\n\nThe web portal of Poland's leading daily, Gazeta Wyborcza, said Sendler, 98, died in Plocka Street hospital early on Monday.

Supported by the Polish government-in-exile, \u017begota coordinated efforts to save Jews from Nazi persecution and murder. It operated from 1942 to 1945.\n\nIrena Sendler (Sendlerowa) was working as a social worker in Warsaw when World War II broke out in 1939. After the Nazis forced Warsaw\u2019s Jews to move into the ghetto in the fall of 1940, Irena used her position and prewar network to supply food and offer financial assistance to Jews. By early 1943, Irena had joined \u017begota. \u017begota members secured hiding places for Polish Jews. They also delivered money, food, false identity documents, and medical assistance to those in their care.\n\nUnder the alias \u201cJolanta,\u201d Irena helped smuggle several hundred Jewish children out of the Warsaw ghetto. She found hiding places for them in orphanages, convents, schools, hospitals, and private homes. Irena provided each child with a new identity. She carefully recorded their original names and placements in code so that relatives could find them after the war. In the fall of 1943, Irena was appointed head of \u017begota\u2019s children's section. Only a few days later, she was arrested by the Gestapo (German secret state police). The Gestapo brutally beat and tortured her. Nonetheless, Irena never revealed the names of the children or her colleagues. She was later released from the Gestapo prison thanks to a bribe organized by her fellow rescuers. Despite the dangers, Irena continued working with \u017begota under a new alias.\n\nIrena Sendler survived the war. In 1965, Yad Vashem recognized her as \u201cRighteous Among the Nations.\u201d\n\nIn this interview, Irena Sendler describes how she was arrested and tortured by the Gestapo."}, {"url": "https://allthatsinteresting.com/irena-sendler", "page_content": "Irena Sendler even managed to survive torture by the Gestapo and a death sentence.\n\nAt the onset of World War II, the Germans outlawed helping Jews, making it punishable by death in Poland. And not only the death of the one offering assistance, but the death of their entire family.\n\nIrena Sendler was well aware of the danger, but that didn\u2019t stop her from risking everything to save the lives of over 2,000 Jewish children.\n\nA Fitting Heir To A Legacy Of Courage And Sacrifice\n\nRemembered today as \u201cthe female Oskar Schindler,\u201d Irena Sendler was an activist and outspoken critic of antisemitic policies long before the outbreak of World War II.\n\nLater, she would attribute the values that guided her work to her upbringing: \u201cI was taught by my father that when someone is drowning you don\u2019t ask if they can swim, you just jump in and help.\u201d\n\nHer father lived and died by his philosophy. He was a doctor to the poor, whom he often treated at no cost. It was on an errand of mercy that he contracted typhus from a patient. When he died, his daughter was just seven years old.\n\nThe Jewish community that he had so often practiced in offered financial support to his widow, but she turned them down, saying that she and her daughter would manage.\n\nAs she grew older, Irena Sendler proved herself a fitting heir to her parents\u2019 legacy. At school, she was a vocal critic of the system that segregated Jewish pupils from their non-Jewish counterparts during classes and lectures.\n\nShe frequently joined Jewish friends on the other side of the aisle, and when a Jewish friend was beaten, she crossed out the stamp on her grade card that marked her as a gentile and made the move permanent. The administration wasn\u2019t a fan; they suspended her for three years.\n\nForged Papers, Secret Supplies, And Smuggled Children\n\nAt the time of the German invasion of Poland, Irena Sendler was working for the Polish Social Welfare Department. When the Nazis came to power, she watched her Jewish coworkers turned away, dismissed from their jobs after years of service.\n\nThe entire Polish Social Welfare Department was then barred from helping any Polish Jews \u2014 they would be served by the institutions in their own communities, the Germans said.\n\nIrena Sendler wasn\u2019t going to let that stop her. She enlisted a group of supportive co-workers and began to created falsified papers that enabled her and her team to help Jewish families. Over four years, she fabricated 3,000 documents.\n\nShe continued to do so even when the stakes rose sharply in 1941: it was announced that the penalty for being found to have helped Polish Jews was death.\n\nIn 1943, Sendler joined the Zegota, an underground organization devoted to helping Jewish people escape the Holocaust. Under the fake name Jolanta, she was elected to head the Jewish children\u2019s section.\n\nBecause of her job with the Social Welfare Department, Sendler had authorization to enter the Warsaw Ghetto, the portion of the city where 300,000 Jews were being held captive.\n\nThough the Germans cared not at all for the lives of Polish Jews behind the ghetto\u2019s walls, they did fear typhus. Specifically, they worried that the deadly infectious fever could spread from inside the ghetto to the soldiers standing guard. So they allowed doctors in to check for symptoms and treat it.\n\nUnder the guise of performing these sanitation inspections, Irena Sendler would enter the ghettos, sneaking in food, medicine, and clothing. But she didn\u2019t leave empty-handed: in the ambulances and trams that drove away from the ghetto were babies and small children. When no other means were available, children were even loaded into packages and suitcases.\n\nOver 2,500 children were smuggled out of the ghettos, at least 400 of them by Sendler herself. She recalls heart-wrenching conversations as families decided whether to send their children out into the city, where discovery meant death.\n\nWhen parents asked Sendler whether she could promise that their children would be safe, she replied that she could not; she didn\u2019t even know whether she herself would make it out of the ghetto alive that day. All she could offer was the promise that she would never stop working on their behalf to protect and one day reunite them.\n\nPrayer Drills And Christian Training For Jewish Children\n\nOnce outside of the ghetto\u2019s confines, the smuggled children were dispersed among friends of the Zegota. Some were placed in the care of Christian Polish families and given Christian names. They were also taught Christian prayers and values in case they were tested.\n\nOne member of the Zegota remembers waking children at night and asking them to recite their prayers, drilling them endlessly so that they would remember them someday under pressure. These small proofs could be the difference between life and death.\n\nSome of the children were sent to the Warsaw orphanage of the Sisters of the Family of Mary or similar Roman Catholic convents and schools. They were also renamed and taught Christian traditons to mask their heritage.\n\nSendler\u2019s ultimate goal was to keep the children safe until the end of the war and then return them to their families, so she kept careful records of the children\u2019s whereabouts, new names, and given names. She kept the lists in jars buried underground.\n\nBut any hope for those someday reunions was growing dim. In July of 1942, the Nazis began what they called the Grossaktion, or Great Action. They had started to systematically round up the Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto and \u201cresettle them\u201d in the east. But the trains the Warsaw Jews boarded were bound for death camps.\n\nIrena Sendler, well known within the ghetto\u2019s walls, was forced to watch her friends disappear.\n\nThe Arrest And Torture Of Irena Sendler\n\nSendler was arrested in late 1943 and tortured by the Gestapo \u2014 and through it all, she managed to keep the children\u2019s identities safe. In the moments preceding her arrest, she was able to toss the documents she had with her to a friend, who concealed them in her clothes.\n\nIn the face of brutal beatings and captivity, Sendler never named any of her comrades or the children they saved.\n\nShe even managed to survive being sentenced to death. As the officers of the Gestapo were bringing her to her execution, fellow members of the Zegota saved her life with a last minute bribe.\n\nEven though her work had almost cost her her life, Sendler returned to her position with the Zegota after her escape, this time under a different name.\n\nAfter the war, Irena Sendler continued helping people by taking a job as a nurse. Despite the demands of her job, she still attempted to make good on her promise to return the children to their families. Sadly, she learned that almost all of the families had been killed at the Treblinka concentration camp or were missing.\n\nFor her efforts, Sendler was recognized by the state of Israel as one of the Righteous Among the Nations, an award created in 1963 for outstanding citizens. She was initially unable to go to Israel to receive it because of travel restrictions imposed by Poland\u2019s communist government \u2014 but finally, in 1983, the award made it to her.\n\nIn 2003, Pope John Paul II personally wrote to her to thank her for her efforts, and later that year, she received Poland\u2019s highest civilian honor, The Order of the White Eagle. She was also given the Jan Karski award for \u201cCourage and Heart\u201d by the American Center for Polish Culture.\n\nThough she\u2019s received countless other awards, Irena Sendler has remained humble about her contribution to the Jewish community.\n\n\u201cI was brought up to believe that a person must be rescued when drowning, regardless of religion and nationality,\u201d she said in a 2007 interview, one year before her death at age 98.\n\n\u201cThe term \u2018hero\u2019 irritates me greatly. The opposite is true. I continue to have pangs of conscience that I did so little.\u201d\n\nAfter this look at Irena Sendler and her amazing heroism during the Holocaust, read about Ilse Koch, the concentration camp guard who was called \u201cthe bitch of Buchenwald.\u201d Then, check out Inga Arvad, the girlfriend that Adolf Hitler and John F. Kennedy had in common."}, {"url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna24574531", "page_content": "Irena Sendler, a Polish social worker who helped save some 2,500 Jewish children from the Nazis by smuggling them out of the Warsaw Ghetto and giving them false identities, has died. She was 98.\n\nSendler died at a Warsaw hospital on Monday morning, her daughter, Janina Zgrzembska, told The Associated Press. She had been hospitalized since last month with pneumonia.\n\nBorn in Warsaw, Sendler served as a social worker with the city's welfare department, masterminding the risky rescue operations of Jewish children from the Warsaw Ghetto during Nazi Germany's brutal World War II occupation.\n\nRecords show that Sendler's team of some 20 people saved nearly 2,500 children from the Warsaw Ghetto between October 1940 and April 1943, when the Nazis burned the ghetto, shooting the residents or sending them to death camps.\n\nUnder the pretext of inspecting the ghetto's sanitary conditions during a typhoid outbreak, Sendler and her assistants went inside in search of children who could be smuggled out and given a chance of survival by living as Catholics.\n\nBabies and small children were smuggled out in ambulances and in trams, sometimes wrapped up as packages. Teenagers escaped by joining teams of workers forced to labor outside the ghetto. They were placed in families, orphanages, hospitals or convents.\n\nIn hopes of one day uniting the children with their families \u2014 most of whom perished in the Nazis' death camps \u2014 Sendler wrote the children's real names on slips of paper that she kept at home.\n\n\u2018A true miracle\u2019\n\nWhen German police came to arrest her in 1943, an assistant managed to hide the slips, which Sendler later buried in a jar under an apple tree in an associate's yard. Some 2,500 names were recorded.\n\n\"It took a true miracle to save a Jewish child,\" Elzbieta Ficowska, who was saved by Sendler's team as a baby in 1942, recalled in an AP interview in 2007. \"Mrs. Sendler saved not only us, but also our children and grandchildren and the generations to come.\"\n\nAfter World War II, Sendler worked as a social welfare official and director of vocational schools, continuing to assist some of the children she rescued.\n\nHonored in Jerusalem\n\nIn 1965, Sendler became one of the first so-called Righteous Gentiles honored by the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem for wartime heroics. Poland's communist leaders at that time would not allow her to travel to Israel; she collected the award in 1983.\n\nDespite the Yad Vashem honor, Sendler was largely forgotten in her homeland. Only in her final years, confined to a nursing home, did she finally become one of Poland's most respected figures, with President Lech Kaczynski and other politicians backing a campaign that put her name forward for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nSendler is survived by her daughter and a granddaughter."}, {"url": "https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/09/25/irena-sendler-female-schindler-saved-2500-jewish-children/", "page_content": "\u201cI was brought up to believe that a person must be rescued when drowning, regardless of religion and nationality.\u201d \u2013 Irena Sendler.\n\nIrena Sendler was born on February 15, 1910, to a family in Warsaw, Poland. Her father died when she was only seven years old, so her mother had to struggle alone to send Irena to school, and later to Warsaw university, where she studied literature.\n\nShe was a true modern hero who risked her own life in order to save the lives of 2500 Jewish children. She smuggled the children out of Warsaw in coffins, ambulances, suitcases, and rucksacks, also providing them with false identities.\n\nThe Second World War began with the invasion of Poland in 1939. At that time, Irena was a 29-year-old graduate working as a social worker in the capital. She was employed by the Welfare Department of the Warsaw Municipality. During the Nazi occupation, Warsaw\u2019s Jews were imprisoned behind a ghetto wall without food or medicine. Irena witnessed the imprisonment of nearly 500,000 Jews in the Warsaw ghetto \u2013 an area the size of New York\u2019s Central Park. She saw the opportunity to help the children escape and she risked her life to save them.\n\nEveryone in Poland was warned that any attempt to help Jewish people would result in them being tortured and killed, together with the rest of their family.\n\nTogether with her closest friends, Irina brought in aid and smuggled Jewish orphans out of the ghetto in coffins, suitcases, and on one occasion, in a tool box. The older children were led out through secret passageways and the city\u2019s sewers.\n\nTaking advantage of the Germans\u2019 paranoia about germs, she was able to go into the ghetto under the ruse of wanting to stop the spread of disease. Officially, she was doing her job of examining the Jews for signs of illness. At the same time, she was on a mission \u2013 to save as many children as she could.\n\nWhen children were smuggled out they were taken in different orphanages and they were given false identity cards. Children were to be returned to their families after the war. Irena kept a list of children she saved, hoping that they will be reunited with their families. Unfortunately, most of the parents were killed or missing when the war was over.\n\nOn October 20, 1943, the Gestapo surrounded Irina\u2019s home. The list with all the children she saved was in her house. In that moment of panic, she gave it to her colleague and went to open the door. The list was saved only because her friend hid it in her underwear. The same night, Irena was arrested and taken to the Pawiak prison where she was tortured for several days. One leg and one hand were fractured. She refused to reveal anything to the Germans, so she was sentenced to death. However, her friends managed to bribe the guards to free her. Using a new identity she continued to try and save lives.\n\nFinally, the war was over. But a new one began for Irina. The Russians took over and occupied Poland and Irena was interrogated and beaten for her liberal views. She spent two years in prison. Even this came to an end. In 1989 communism fell in Poland and after many years Irina Sendler was recognized for her humanitarian work. She died on 12 May 2008, at the age of 98."}, {"url": "https://www.neh.gov/article/irena-sendler-and-girls-kansas", "page_content": "Between 1942 and 1943, Sendler and her network of 10 compatriots rescued 2,500 Jewish children from the Warsaw ghetto. Disguised as an infection-control nurse, Sendler knocked on doors in the ghetto, asking parents and grandparents to give up their children and grandchildren so that she could smuggle them out. Each child was given a new Polish name and forged identity papers and hidden in foster homes, orphanages, or convents. Sendler insisted that lists of the children be kept, documenting their Jewish and Polish names, so that after the war they would know their original identities. She hid the lists in milk jars that were buried in the backyard of one of her co-conspirators.\n\nPhoto caption A young Irena Sendler, in Warsaw, circa 1930. \u2014 AF Fotografie / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAfter the war, Poland\u2019s Communist government persecuted members of Poland\u2019s wartime resistance, Zegota, of which Sendler was a part. They were harassed, interrogated, imprisoned, and even executed. Sendler and others who rescued Jews during the war kept silent. Almost no one knew of Sendler and her heroism.\n\nShe would have remained an unsung hero were it not for three teenage American girls who discovered her forgotten story 60 years later. Liz, Megan, and Sabrina, who began as students of history for a National History Day competition, became recorders of history, championing Sendler\u2019s legacy in Poland, the U.S., and around the world. Three teenagers from rural Kansas helped crack open the silence about the Holocaust in Poland.\n\nMy first brush with this story came in the winter of 2001, in my Middlebury, Vermont, pediatric office, while going through my mail. This was before the electronic health record, and I daily triaged a prodigious stack of paper. Everything had about three seconds to be kept, filed, recycled, or thrown away.\n\nI am a member of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM). Each year I send a contribution, and they send me a calendar highlighting 12 monthly Holocaust heroes. As I quickly flipped through, I was brought up short by the November entry. It was the photo that stopped me\u2014a young Irena Sendler, twenty-nine years old, who looked a lot like my niece. I read the short paragraph below the photo:\n\nIrena Sendlerowa, (1916\u2013UNKNOWN) As head of the children\u2019s division of Zegota, the Polish underground Council for Aid to Jews, social worker Irena Sendlerowa (code name \u201cJolanta\u201d) helped smuggle more than 2,500 Jewish children out of the Warsaw ghetto. Hiding them in orphanages, convents, schools, hospitals, and private homes, she provided each child with a new identity, carefully recording in code their Jewish names and placements so that surviving relatives could find them after the war. Arrested by the Gestapo in the fall of 1943, Sendlerowa was sentenced to death. Zegota rescued her before her execution. She assumed a new identity and continued her work for Zegota.\n\nI was stunned. I\u2019m a child of Holocaust survivors. How could I not know Irena Sendler\u2019s story? Everybody knows Oskar Schindler, who rescued 1,100 Jews from a German concentration camp in Poland and whose story was told in the Steven Spielberg film Schindler\u2019s List. Even at the USHMM, the preeminent scholars of the Holocaust didn\u2019t know much about Sendler. They had her birth year wrong (it was 1910, I later found out), and they didn\u2019t know if she was still alive.\n\nI kept this calendar in a file labeled \u201cInteresting Stuff.\u201d And there it sat for almost three years.\n\nPhoto caption These children rescued by Sendler were sent to live with new identities at a Polish convent, circa 1943. \u2014 World History Archive / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nThen, in February 2004, I came into my office one night to see a sick child. On my desk someone had left a copy of the Ladies Home Journal, opened to an article, \u201cThe Woman Who Loved Children.\u201d It was about Irena Sendler and three Kansas teens who uncovered her story. The article explained that, in 1999, while planning a National History Day project, they found a brief reference to Sendler in a U.S. News and World Report article entitled \u201cThe Other Schindlers.\u201d Sendler\u2019s story inspired their NHD project: a play they wrote and performed called Life in a Jar. It retold, in dramatic form, the emotional story of Sendler knocking on ghetto doors and asking Jewish parents to give up their children to save them. The title, Life in a Jar, refers to the lists Sendler buried.\n\nThe teens read that Irena had been arrested in 1943 by the Gestapo and tortured in Pawiak Prison, the most notorious prison in the ghetto, from which almost no one escaped. Logically, they began searching cemetery records and reached out to the Jewish Foundation for the Righteous, seeking information about where she might be buried. Soon after, they received a letter from the foundation, saying that Sendler was alive! She was in her nineties and living in poverty with her daughter-in-law in Warsaw. The foundation then put them in touch with Sendler.\n\nThe three students made plans to travel to Poland and meet Sendler, first trying to raise money through candy sales, until philanthropists and Holocaust survivors from the Kansas City Jewish community stepped in to help cover the trip. Traveling out of the country for the first time (the first time on a plane for one of them), the girls finally met Sendler at her Warsaw home in 2001. They maintained a tender friendship with her for the next seven years until she passed, making several trips to Poland to visit her, each time performing Life in a Jar at various venues. And they began working with Polish high school students who were telling the forgotten stories of rescuers from their own communities.\n\nPhoto caption The original three students\u2014Liz,Megan, and Sabrina\u2014are joined by Jessica Shelton-Ripper (third from left), who performed many times with Life in a Jar. Here they visit the Irena Sendler exhibit at the Lowell Milken Center for Unsung Heroes in Fort Scott, Kansas, in 2018. \u2014 Kenny Felt\n\nAs I read the Ladies Home Journal article, I remembered the USHMM calendar. This story now took on a new dimension. I have been a closet writer most of my life, and I was thinking about writing a novella about the Warsaw ghetto. Irena Sendler seemed like a compelling character, and I wanted to know more about her. I was also intrigued by the two stories\u2014Irena\u2019s wartime history and the contemporary story of three Kansas teens. I called their teacher in Kansas, Norm Conard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s serendipitous that you should call,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for someone to write these two stories.\u201d\n\nI hesitated. I had not written nonfiction before, only fiction and poetry. But I felt the powerful synergy of these two stories. I was not eager to write a wartime history of a Holocaust hero because most Holocaust literature leaves me angry, sad, depressed, and frustrated. But this story was different\u2014an inspiring story of three typical American teenagers who helped restore the history of a great hero.\n\nI agreed to write the story and, in 2004, visited Uniontown, Kansas, where the girls went to school. A small town with a population of 264, it was down on its luck. Many stores were shuttered. It had the look of a Dorothea Lange or Walker Evans black-and-white photo from the Depression. I met Norm and the girls at the high school, and I was hooked.\n\nUniontown High School, with only about 120 students, is one of the lowest-income school districts in Kansas. There was no diversity in the school\u2014never a Jew, an African American, or even a Catholic\u2014yet these teens had discovered Sendler\u2019s story and told the world. I spent a week interviewing the students, their families, their teacher, community members, and Holocaust survivors from Kansas City who had taken a great interest in the play and the Irena Sendler project.\n\nMy wife and I accompanied the students and Conard to Poland on their third visit, in 2005. I was able to do more extensive research and interview Sendler, Holocaust scholars, and some of the children Sendler had rescued, now in their sixties and seventies. We met Elzbieta Ficowska, rescued as a six-month-old infant. Sendler had sedated her and put her in a carpenter\u2019s box. Her parents kissed their baby good-bye and left a small spoon in the box with her name inscribed on one side and her birthdate on the other. It is the only memento of her parents, who were murdered at Treblinka. She and I have become good friends, and I have held her spoon many times, always with tears. Ficowska became one of Sendler\u2019s caregivers and the chairperson of the Association of Children of the Holocaust in Poland.\n\nIt was Sendler\u2019s ninety-fifth birthday when I interviewed her. She was energetic, and her memory was clear and specific. She wanted to be sure that I credited all of her network of rescuers and liaisons. She ensured that I had everyone\u2019s name spelled correctly.\n\nPhoto caption Megan took this picture of Sendler on May 3, 2008, during a visit to Poland. Sendler passed away nine days later on May 12. \u2014 Megan Felt\n\nPoland was arguably the most victimized country in occupied Europe. The consequence for hiding or even feeding a Jew was execution, often in public as a warning to other Poles. When I asked Sendler why she put herself and her family at such risk, she said, \u201cIt was a need of my heart.\u201d She rejected the appellation of hero. \u201cI only did what any decent person would do. . . . The heroes were the babies\u2014they were the heroes of their mothers\u2019 hearts. . . . It was the parents and grandparents who gave up their children, they were the true heroes.\u201d\n\nShe said it was her father\u2019s teaching that inspired her. \u201cIf you see someone drowning you must rescue them, even if you cannot swim.\u201d And \u201cthere are only two kinds of people in the world, good and bad, regardless of race, religion, or creed. And most people are good.\u201d\n\nShe lamented that she had not done enough\u2014for every child they saved almost one hundred went to their deaths at Treblinka.\n\nSendler has become a Polish national hero. Poles have been eager to tell their stories, in part because the Life in a Jar project stimulated Polish/Jewish dialog as well as scholarship about Poland during the German occupation. Although there has been a disturbing return of anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial in Poland, Sendler\u2019s story continues to be told.\n\nYad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Jerusalem, recognizes more Righteous Gentiles\u2014those who rescued out of principle, not for personal gain\u2014from Poland than from any other country in occupied Europe. In 2019, it listed 27,362 Righteous Gentiles, with 6,992 from Poland, or around 26 percent. But because of postwar Poland\u2019s Communist anti-Semitism, Polish rescuers who had received Yad Vashem medals hid them and told no one of their wartime activities.\n\nAt one performance of Life in a Jar in Warsaw, I sat beside an old man, old enough to have been an adult during the war. Throughout the performance he sat with his hands together, clutching something inside. After the performance I asked him about it, and he opened his hands to reveal his Yad Vashem medal. There were tears in his eyes as he explained, \u201cI have kept this buried in my basement for 60 years. I told no one except my wife. I didn\u2019t tell my children, family, friends, or coworkers. Now, because of these American students, I can show this proudly. It was the finest thing I have ever done.\u201d\n\nMy first time in Warsaw, in 2005, I could find few markers of the Warsaw ghetto and no commemoration of the wall. In my research for the book, I found no reference to Irena Sendler before 2000 other than by Yad Vashem (1965 Righteous Gentile medal, and in 1983 a tree planted in her honor next to that of Raoul Wallenberg) and the U.S. News and World Report article that launched the Kansas teens on their National History Day project.\n\nWhen I returned in 2013 for the release of the Polish translation of my 2011 book Life in a Jar: The Irena Sendler Project (also translated into Russian, Chinese, and Mongolian), I saw how much had changed in Poland. Where there had been no markers of the wall, now there is a footprint, 10 inches wide that says, \u201cMUR GETTA/GHETTO WALL 1940\u20131943,\u201d placed in sidewalks and lawns showing the exact location of the ghetto wall. At each of the 22 gates there is a memorial plaque with a map and description of what happened in the ghetto.\n\nThere are now 35 Irena Sendler schools in Poland, three in Germany, one in France, and one in England. I have met to discuss Sendler with Poland\u2019s Deputy Foreign Secretary Jerzy Pomianowski, given radio, TV, and print interviews, and met with a journalist from the Catholic News Agency. The Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw opened in 2014, and the Lowell Milken Center Europe, a Polish office of the Irena Sendler/Life in a Jar Foundation, works with Polish teens on similar projects.\n\nThe project changed Poland as well as the American students who started it all. From my time with the Kansas teens, I learned that each girl knew something about losing or almost losing their own parent. Liz was abandoned by her parents as a young child and raised by her grandparents, Megan\u2019s mother developed cancer, and Sabrina\u2019s mother suddenly died during the project. The girls courageously allowed me to tell their own painful stories in my book. And it became clear to me that the last three children Irena Sendler rescued were the girls from Kansas.\n\nToday, Elizabeth Cambers Hutton has two master\u2019s degrees and teaches Holocaust history in Missouri. Sabrina Coons-Murphy is an elementary schoolteacher in Kansas. Megan Stewart Felt, the program coordinator for the Irena Sendler/Life in a Jar Foundation, still works with Norm Conard to further Sendler\u2019s legacy and continues to play Sendler in performances of Life in a Jar.\n\nThe story has also changed me. I am a German-American Jew, born after the war to parents who narrowly escaped the Holocaust. Others in my family did not. For the first five years of my life I lived in upper Manhattan, in Washington Heights\u2014an urban shtetl of German Jews who had survived the Holocaust. I didn\u2019t speak English until I was five years old. The Holocaust was the baffling but iconic story of my childhood, a subject of nervous, hushed, adult conversation. It was frightening, mysterious, impossible to grasp, yet everywhere\u2014it was the atmosphere. There was an awkward gracelessness on the part of those who lived through it, a furtiveness I now understand to be a kind of PTSD. It was the unacknowledged elephant in the living room\u2014huge but shrouded.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was in my twenties that I learned that my grandfather had been arrested on Kristallnacht, November 9, 1938, and imprisoned in Dachau. My grandmother went to high school with one of the administrative guards at Dachau. He accepted a bribe from her, and my grandfather was released after six months. In 1999, my parents were interviewed as part of Steven Spielberg\u2019s Shoah project. In the course of the interview my mother brought out her identity papers, marked \u201cJew,\u201d and her nursing certificate, stamped with a swastika. My brother and I had never seen these artifacts.\n\nGrowing up as a child of survivors, I had a sense of mission about the Holocaust, but didn\u2019t know how that would manifest. Now in my seventies, I find that in writing Life in a Jar, and speaking about it to new audiences, I am fulfilling that mission.\n\nIn my talks, sponsored by the Vermont Humanities Council, I emphasize how Sendler and the girls from Kansas were repairing the world\u2014tikkun olam in Hebrew. Few of us would have the courage to do what Sendler did, but all of us can do what Liz, Megan, and Sabrina did\u2014performing small acts of decency and respect for all people. Acts that change the world."}, {"url": "https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/photo/irena-sendler", "page_content": "Portrait of Irena Sendler in Warsaw, Poland, circa 1939.\n\nIrena Sendler (1910\u20132008) was a member of the Council for Aid to Jews, codenamed \u201c\u017begota.\u201d \u017begota was a clandestine rescue organization of Poles and Jews in German-occupied Poland.

During WWII, Iliana, got permission to work in the Warsaw Ghetto. She had an ulterior motive... She KNEW what the Nazi's plans were for the Jews. Iliana smuggled infants out in the bottom of her tool box she carried, and she carried in the back of her truck a Burlap sack, (for larger kids). She also had a dog in the back, that she trained to bark when the Nazi soldiers let her in, and out of the ghetto. The soldiers of course wanted nothing to do with the dog, and the barking covered the kids/infants noises. During her time and course of doing this, she managed to smuggle out and save 2500 kids/infants. She was caught, and the Nazi's broke both her legs, and arms, and beat her severely. Iliana kept a record of the names of all the kids she smuggled out, and kept them in a glass jar, buried under a tree in her back yard. After the war, she tried to locate any parents that may have survived it, and reunited the family. Most of course had been gassed. Those kids she helped got placed into foster family homes, or adopted. Last year Iliana was up for the Nobel Peace Prize.... She LOST. Al Gore won, for a slide show on Global Warming. Check it out: www.irenasendler.org\n\nIrena has often been referred to as \"the female Oskar Schindler\" in her native Poland for her daring and ingenuity in saving the lives of more than 2,500 Jews (most of them children) in German-occupied Poland during World War II. Unlike Oskar Schindler, whose story was the subject of the Academy Award-winning 1993 film Schindler's List, Irena Sendler was a relatively unknown figure to the world at large until 1999, when four Kansas high school students wrote and performed \"Life in a Jar,\" a play about Irena's life-saving efforts in the Warsaw Ghetto:\n\nA Los Angeles Times obituary for Irena described how the Polish social worker passed herself off as a nurse to sneak supplies and aid into (and children out of) the Warsaw Ghetto, and the punishment she endured when she was finally caught by the Nazis:\n\nShe studied at Warsaw University and was a social worker in Warsaw when the German occupation of Poland began in 1939. In 1940, after the Nazis herded Jews into the ghetto and built a wall separating it from the rest of the city, disease, especially typhoid, ran rampant. Social workers were not allowed inside the ghetto, but Sendler, imagining \"the horror of life behind the walls,\" obtained fake identification and passed herself off as a nurse, allowed to bring in food, clothes and medicine. By 1942, when the deadly intentions of the Nazis had become clear, Sendler joined a Polish underground organization, Zegota. She recruited 10 close friends \u2014 a group that would eventually grow to 25, all but one of them women \u2014 and began rescuing Jewish children. She and her friends smuggled the children out in boxes, suitcases, sacks and coffins, sedating babies to quiet their cries. Some were spirited away through a network of basements and secret passages. Operations were timed to the second. One of Sendler's children told of waiting by a gate in darkness as a German soldier patrolled nearby. When the soldier passed, the boy counted to 30, then made a mad dash to the middle of the street, where a manhole cover opened and he was taken down into the sewers and eventually to safety. Most of the children who left with Sendler's group were taken into Roman Catholic convents, orphanages and homes and given non-Jewish aliases. Sendler recorded their true names on thin rolls of paper in the hope that she could reunite them with their families later. She preserved the precious scraps in jars and buried them in a friend's garden. In 1943, she was captured by the Nazis and tortured but refused to tell her captors who her co-conspirators were or where the bottles were buried. She also resisted in other ways. According to Felt, when Sendler worked in the prison laundry, she and her co-workers made holes in the German soldiers' underwear. When the officers discovered what they had done, they lined up all the women and shot every other one. It was just one of many close calls for Sendler. During one particularly brutal torture session, her captors broke her feet and legs, and she passed out. When she awoke, a Gestapo officer told her he had accepted a bribe from her comrades in the resistance to help her escape. The officer added her name to a list of executed prisoners. Sendler went into hiding but continued her rescue efforts. Felt said that Sendler had begun her rescue operation before she joined the organized resistance and helped a number of adults escape, including the man she later married. \"We think she saved about 500 people before she joined Zegota,\" Felt said, which would mean that Sendler ultimately helped rescue about 3,000 Polish Jews. When the war ended, Sendler unearthed the jars and began trying to return the children to their families. For the vast majority, there was no family left. Many of the children were adopted by Polish families; others were sent to Israel.\n\nIrena Sendler is often claimed to have been a candidate to receive the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, but that honor was not awarded to her. It's not possible to state categorically that she was \"nominated\" for the award, since information about Nobel Prize \"nominations, investigations, and opinions is kept secret for fifty years.\" (Since 1974 the statutes of the Nobel Foundation have stated that \"work produced by a person since deceased shall not be considered for an award,\" so she presumably could not be subsequently honored.)\n\nIn 2007, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded jointly to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and former U.S. Vice-President Albert Arnold (Al) Gore Jr. \"for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change.\" (Al Gore was also involved with another significant award in 2007, when An Inconvenient Truth, a documentary about his campaign to make the issue of global warming a recognized problem worldwide, claimed an Academy Award as \"Best Documentary Feature.\")\n\nThe International Federation of Social Workers (IFSW) expressed its disappointment that Irena Sendler had not yet been honored with a Nobel Prize:"}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/activist/irena-sendler", "page_content": "(1910-2008)\n\nWho Was Irena Sendler?\n\nWhen the Nazis invaded in 1939, Irena Sendler was a social worker and so had access to the Warsaw Ghetto, where hundreds of thousands of Jews were imprisoned. As a member of \u017begota (aka Konrad \u017begota Committee, the Council to Aid Jews), she helped rescue 2,500 Jewish children from the ghetto. For her courageous actions during the Holocaust, in 1965, Israel\u2019s Yad Vashem honored her as \u201cRighteous Among the Nations.\u201d Sendler died in Warsaw in 2008.\n\nEarly Life\n\nSendler was born Irena Krzy\u017canowska on February 15, 1910, in Otwock, Poland. Her parents were members of the Polish Socialist Party, and her father, Stanis\u0142aw Krzy\u017canowski was a medical doctor who died of typhus when Sendler was a child. In 1931 Sendler married Mieczys\u0142aw Sendler, and the couple moved to Warsaw before the outbreak of World War II.\n\nWarsaw Ghetto\n\nIn Warsaw, Sendler became a social worker, overseeing the city\u2019s \u201ccanteens,\u201d which provided assistance to people in need. When the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939, Sendler and her colleagues also used the canteens to provide medicine, clothing and other necessities to the city\u2019s persecuted Jewish population.\n\nIn 1940, the Nazis forced Warsaw\u2019s more than 400,000 Jewish residents into a small locked ghetto area, where thousands died every month from disease and starvation. As a social worker, Sendler was able to enter the ghetto regularly to help the residents and soon joined \u017begota, the Council to Aid Jews. Putting themselves at great risk, she and about two dozen of her colleagues set out to save as many Jewish children as possible from death in the ghetto or deportation to concentration camps.\n\n\u017begota began by saving Jewish orphans. They had several ways of smuggling them out of the ghetto: Some were carried out in caskets or potato sacks; others left in ambulances or snuck out through underground tunnels. Still others entered the Jewish side of a Catholic church that straddled the ghetto boundary and left on the other side with new identities. Sendler then helped place the children at convents or with non-Jewish families.\n\nAs the situation became more dire for the ghetto\u2019s inhabitants, Sendler went beyond rescuing orphans and began asking parents to let her try to get their children to safety. Although she couldn\u2019t guarantee the children\u2019s survival, she could tell parents that their children would at least have a chance. Sendler kept detailed records and lists of the children she helped buried in a jar. Her plan was to reunite the rescued children and their parents after the war. However, most of the parents did not survive.\n\nOn October 20, 1943, the Nazis arrested Sendler and sent her to Pawiak Prison. There they tortured her, trying to get her to reveal the names of her associates. She refused and was sentenced to death. However, \u017begota members bribed the prison guards, and Sendler was released in February 1944.\n\nSendler continued her work until the war ended, by which time she and her colleagues had rescued some 2,500 children. It has been estimated that Sendler personally saved about 400.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nAfter the war, Sendler\u2019s first marriage ended in divorce. In 1947 she married Stefan Zgrzembski, with whom she had three children, daughter Janka, and sons Andrzej (who died in infancy) and Adam. After the death of Zgrzembski, Sendler remarried her first husband, Mieczys\u0142aw Sendler, but their reunion didn't last and they again divorced.\n\nHonors and Awards\n\nIn 1965, Yad Vashem, Israel\u2019s Holocaust memorial organization, named Sendler as Righteous Among the Nations for her work saving Jewish children. In 2003, Poland honored her with its Order of the White Eagle. In 2008, Sendler was nominated for (but did not win) a Nobel Peace Prize. The story of her life was also captured in a 2009 TV movie The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler, which starred Anna Paquin in the title role.\n\nDeath\n\nSendler died on May 12, 2008, in Warsaw, Poland, at the age of 98.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nBirth Year: 1910\n\nBirth date: February 15, 1910\n\nBirth City: Otwock\n\nBirth Country: Poland\n\nGender: Female\n\nBest Known For: Irena Sendler was a Polish social worker who, during World War II, helped to rescue 2,500 Jewish children from the Warsaw Ghetto, and placed them in convents or with non-Jewish families.\n\nAstrological Sign: Aquarius\n\nDeath Year: 2008\n\nDeath date: May 12, 2008\n\nDeath City: Warsaw\n\nDeath Country: Poland\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION"}], "Irena Sendler provided shelter to the Jewish children she saved in individual and group children's homes in the city.": [{"url": "https://allthatsinteresting.com/irena-sendler", "page_content": "Irena Sendler even managed to survive torture by the Gestapo and a death sentence.\n\nAt the onset of World War II, the Germans outlawed helping Jews, making it punishable by death in Poland. And not only the death of the one offering assistance, but the death of their entire family.\n\nIrena Sendler was well aware of the danger, but that didn\u2019t stop her from risking everything to save the lives of over 2,000 Jewish children.\n\nA Fitting Heir To A Legacy Of Courage And Sacrifice\n\nRemembered today as \u201cthe female Oskar Schindler,\u201d Irena Sendler was an activist and outspoken critic of antisemitic policies long before the outbreak of World War II.\n\nLater, she would attribute the values that guided her work to her upbringing: \u201cI was taught by my father that when someone is drowning you don\u2019t ask if they can swim, you just jump in and help.\u201d\n\nHer father lived and died by his philosophy. He was a doctor to the poor, whom he often treated at no cost. It was on an errand of mercy that he contracted typhus from a patient. When he died, his daughter was just seven years old.\n\nThe Jewish community that he had so often practiced in offered financial support to his widow, but she turned them down, saying that she and her daughter would manage.\n\nAs she grew older, Irena Sendler proved herself a fitting heir to her parents\u2019 legacy. At school, she was a vocal critic of the system that segregated Jewish pupils from their non-Jewish counterparts during classes and lectures.\n\nShe frequently joined Jewish friends on the other side of the aisle, and when a Jewish friend was beaten, she crossed out the stamp on her grade card that marked her as a gentile and made the move permanent. The administration wasn\u2019t a fan; they suspended her for three years.\n\nForged Papers, Secret Supplies, And Smuggled Children\n\nAt the time of the German invasion of Poland, Irena Sendler was working for the Polish Social Welfare Department. When the Nazis came to power, she watched her Jewish coworkers turned away, dismissed from their jobs after years of service.\n\nThe entire Polish Social Welfare Department was then barred from helping any Polish Jews \u2014 they would be served by the institutions in their own communities, the Germans said.\n\nIrena Sendler wasn\u2019t going to let that stop her. She enlisted a group of supportive co-workers and began to created falsified papers that enabled her and her team to help Jewish families. Over four years, she fabricated 3,000 documents.\n\nShe continued to do so even when the stakes rose sharply in 1941: it was announced that the penalty for being found to have helped Polish Jews was death.\n\nIn 1943, Sendler joined the Zegota, an underground organization devoted to helping Jewish people escape the Holocaust. Under the fake name Jolanta, she was elected to head the Jewish children\u2019s section.\n\nBecause of her job with the Social Welfare Department, Sendler had authorization to enter the Warsaw Ghetto, the portion of the city where 300,000 Jews were being held captive.\n\nThough the Germans cared not at all for the lives of Polish Jews behind the ghetto\u2019s walls, they did fear typhus. Specifically, they worried that the deadly infectious fever could spread from inside the ghetto to the soldiers standing guard. So they allowed doctors in to check for symptoms and treat it.\n\nUnder the guise of performing these sanitation inspections, Irena Sendler would enter the ghettos, sneaking in food, medicine, and clothing. But she didn\u2019t leave empty-handed: in the ambulances and trams that drove away from the ghetto were babies and small children. When no other means were available, children were even loaded into packages and suitcases.\n\nOver 2,500 children were smuggled out of the ghettos, at least 400 of them by Sendler herself. She recalls heart-wrenching conversations as families decided whether to send their children out into the city, where discovery meant death.\n\nWhen parents asked Sendler whether she could promise that their children would be safe, she replied that she could not; she didn\u2019t even know whether she herself would make it out of the ghetto alive that day. All she could offer was the promise that she would never stop working on their behalf to protect and one day reunite them.\n\nPrayer Drills And Christian Training For Jewish Children\n\nOnce outside of the ghetto\u2019s confines, the smuggled children were dispersed among friends of the Zegota. Some were placed in the care of Christian Polish families and given Christian names. They were also taught Christian prayers and values in case they were tested.\n\nOne member of the Zegota remembers waking children at night and asking them to recite their prayers, drilling them endlessly so that they would remember them someday under pressure. These small proofs could be the difference between life and death.\n\nSome of the children were sent to the Warsaw orphanage of the Sisters of the Family of Mary or similar Roman Catholic convents and schools. They were also renamed and taught Christian traditons to mask their heritage.\n\nSendler\u2019s ultimate goal was to keep the children safe until the end of the war and then return them to their families, so she kept careful records of the children\u2019s whereabouts, new names, and given names. She kept the lists in jars buried underground.\n\nBut any hope for those someday reunions was growing dim. In July of 1942, the Nazis began what they called the Grossaktion, or Great Action. They had started to systematically round up the Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto and \u201cresettle them\u201d in the east. But the trains the Warsaw Jews boarded were bound for death camps.\n\nIrena Sendler, well known within the ghetto\u2019s walls, was forced to watch her friends disappear.\n\nThe Arrest And Torture Of Irena Sendler\n\nSendler was arrested in late 1943 and tortured by the Gestapo \u2014 and through it all, she managed to keep the children\u2019s identities safe. In the moments preceding her arrest, she was able to toss the documents she had with her to a friend, who concealed them in her clothes.\n\nIn the face of brutal beatings and captivity, Sendler never named any of her comrades or the children they saved.\n\nShe even managed to survive being sentenced to death. As the officers of the Gestapo were bringing her to her execution, fellow members of the Zegota saved her life with a last minute bribe.\n\nEven though her work had almost cost her her life, Sendler returned to her position with the Zegota after her escape, this time under a different name.\n\nAfter the war, Irena Sendler continued helping people by taking a job as a nurse. Despite the demands of her job, she still attempted to make good on her promise to return the children to their families. Sadly, she learned that almost all of the families had been killed at the Treblinka concentration camp or were missing.\n\nFor her efforts, Sendler was recognized by the state of Israel as one of the Righteous Among the Nations, an award created in 1963 for outstanding citizens. She was initially unable to go to Israel to receive it because of travel restrictions imposed by Poland\u2019s communist government \u2014 but finally, in 1983, the award made it to her.\n\nIn 2003, Pope John Paul II personally wrote to her to thank her for her efforts, and later that year, she received Poland\u2019s highest civilian honor, The Order of the White Eagle. She was also given the Jan Karski award for \u201cCourage and Heart\u201d by the American Center for Polish Culture.\n\nThough she\u2019s received countless other awards, Irena Sendler has remained humble about her contribution to the Jewish community.\n\n\u201cI was brought up to believe that a person must be rescued when drowning, regardless of religion and nationality,\u201d she said in a 2007 interview, one year before her death at age 98.\n\n\u201cThe term \u2018hero\u2019 irritates me greatly. The opposite is true. I continue to have pangs of conscience that I did so little.\u201d\n\nAfter this look at Irena Sendler and her amazing heroism during the Holocaust, read about Ilse Koch, the concentration camp guard who was called \u201cthe bitch of Buchenwald.\u201d Then, check out Inga Arvad, the girlfriend that Adolf Hitler and John F.

As a health worker, she sneaked the children out between 1942 and 1943 to safe hiding places and found non-Jewish families to adopt them.\n\nHer achievement went largely unnoticed for many years. Then the story was uncovered by four young students at Uniontown High School, in Kansas, who were the winners of the 2000 Kansas state National History Day competition by writing a play Life in a Jar about the heroic actions of Irena Sendler. The girls - Elizabeth Cambers, Megan Stewart, Sabrina Coons and Janice Underwood - have since gained international recognition, along with their teacher, Norman Conard. The presentation, seen in many venues in the United States and popularized by National Public Radio, C-SPAN and CBS, has brought Irena Sendler's story to a wider public.\n\nSendler was born in 1910 in Otwock, a town some 15 miles southeast of Warsaw. She was greatly influenced by her father who was one of the first Polish Socialists. As a doctor his patients were mostly poor Jews.\n\nIn 1939, Germany invaded Poland, and the brutality of the Nazis accelerated with murder, violence and terror.\n\nAt the time, Irena was a Senior Administrator in the Warsaw Social Welfare Department, which operated the canteens in every district of the city. Previously, the canteens provided meals, financial aid, and other services for orphans, the elderly, the poor and the destitute. Now, through Irena, the canteens also provided clothing, medicine and money for the Jews. They were registered under fictitious Christian names, and to prevent inspections, the Jewish families were reported as being afflicted with such highly infectious diseases as typhus and tuberculosis.\n\nBut in 1942, the Nazis herded hundreds of thousands of Jews into a 16-block area that came to be known as the Warsaw Ghetto. The Ghetto was sealed and the Jewish families ended up behind its walls, only to await certain death.\n\nSendler was so appalled by the conditions that she joined Zegota, the Council for Aid to Jews, organized by the Polish underground resistance movement, as one of its first recruits and directed the efforts to rescue Jewish children.\n\nTo be able to enter the Ghetto legally, Irena managed to be issued a pass from Warsaws Epidemic Control Department and she visited the Ghetto daily, reestablished contacts and brought food, medicines and clothing. But 5,000 people were dying a month from starvation and disease in the Ghetto, and she decided to help the Jewish children to get out.\n\nFor Sendler, a young mother herself, persuading parents to part with their children was in itself a horrendous task. Finding families willing to shelter the children, and thereby willing to risk their life if the Nazis ever found out, was also not easy.\n\nSendler, who wore a star armband as a sign of her solidarity to Jews, began smuggling children out in an ambulance. She recruited at least one person from each of the ten centers of the Social Welfare Department. With their help, she issued hundreds of false documents with forged signatures and successfully smuggled almost 2,500 Jewish children to safety and gave them temporary new identities.\n\nSome children were taken out in gunnysacks or body bags. Some were buried inside loads of goods. A mechanic took a baby out in his toolbox. Some kids were carried out in potato sacks, others were placed in coffins, some entered a church in the Ghetto which had two entrances. One entrance opened into the Ghetto, the other opened into the Aryan side of Warsaw. They entered the church as Jews and exited as Christians. \"Can you guarantee they will live?\" Irena later recalled the distraught parents asking. But she could only guarantee they would die if they stayed. \"In my dreams,\" she said, \"I still hear the cries when they left their parents.\"\n\nIrena Sendler accomplished her incredible deeds with the active assistance of the church. \"I sent most of the children to religious establishments,\" she recalled. \"I knew I could count on the Sisters.\" Irena also had a remarkable record of cooperation when placing the youngsters: \"No one ever refused to take a child from me,\" she said.\n\nThe children were given false identities and placed in homes, orphanages and convents. Sendler carefully noted, in coded form, the children's original names and their new identities. She kept the only record of their true identities in jars buried beneath an apple tree in a neighbor's back yard, across the street from German barracks, hoping she could someday dig up the jars, locate the children and inform them of their past. In all, the jars contained the names of 2,500 children.\n\nBut the Nazis became aware of Irena's activities, and on October 20, 1943 she was arrested, imprisoned and tortured by the Gestapo, who broke her feet and legs. She ended up in the Pawiak Prison, but no one could break her spirit. Though she was the only one who knew the names and addresses of the families sheltering the Jewish children, she withstood the torture, refusing to betray either her associates or any of the Jewish children in hiding.\n\nSentenced to death, Irena was saved at the last minute when Zegota members bribed one of the Germans to halt the execution. She escaped from prison but for the rest of the war she was pursued by the Gestapo.\n\nAfter the war she dug up the jars and used the notes to track down the 2,500 children she placed with adoptive families and to reunite them with relatives scattered across Europe. But most lost their families during the Holocaust in Nazi death camps.\n\nThe children had known her only by her code name Jolanta. But years later, after she was honored for her wartime work, her picture appeared in a newspaper. \"A man, a painter, telephoned me,\" said Sendler, \"`I remember your face,' he said. `It was you who took me out of the ghetto.' I had many calls like that!\"\n\nIrena Sendler did not think of herself as a hero. She claimed no credit for her actions. \"I could have done more,\" she said. \"This regret will follow me to my death.\"\n\nShe has been honored by international Jewish organizations - in 1965 she accorded the title of Righteous Among the Nations by the Yad Vashem organization in Jerusalem and in 1991 she was made an honorary citizen of Israel.\n\nIrena Sendler was awarded Poland's highest distinction, the Order of White Eagle in Warsaw Monday Nov. 10, 2003.\n\nThis lovely, courageous woman was one of the most dedicated and active workers in aiding Jews during the Nazi occupation of Poland. Her courage enabled not only the survival of 2,500 Jewish children but also of the generations of their descendants.\n\nShe passed away on May 12, 2008, at the age of 98."}, {"url": "https://www.neh.gov/article/irena-sendler-and-girls-kansas", "page_content": "Between 1942 and 1943, Sendler and her network of 10 compatriots rescued 2,500 Jewish children from the Warsaw ghetto. Disguised as an infection-control nurse, Sendler knocked on doors in the ghetto, asking parents and grandparents to give up their children and grandchildren so that she could smuggle them out. Each child was given a new Polish name and forged identity papers and hidden in foster homes, orphanages, or convents. Sendler insisted that lists of the children be kept, documenting their Jewish and Polish names, so that after the war they would know their original identities. She hid the lists in milk jars that were buried in the backyard of one of her co-conspirators.\n\nPhoto caption A young Irena Sendler, in Warsaw, circa 1930. \u2014 AF Fotografie / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAfter the war, Poland\u2019s Communist government persecuted members of Poland\u2019s wartime resistance, Zegota, of which Sendler was a part. They were harassed, interrogated, imprisoned, and even executed. Sendler and others who rescued Jews during the war kept silent. Almost no one knew of Sendler and her heroism.\n\nShe would have remained an unsung hero were it not for three teenage American girls who discovered her forgotten story 60 years later. Liz, Megan, and Sabrina, who began as students of history for a National History Day competition, became recorders of history, championing Sendler\u2019s legacy in Poland, the U.S., and around the world. Three teenagers from rural Kansas helped crack open the silence about the Holocaust in Poland.\n\nMy first brush with this story came in the winter of 2001, in my Middlebury, Vermont, pediatric office, while going through my mail. This was before the electronic health record, and I daily triaged a prodigious stack of paper. Everything had about three seconds to be kept, filed, recycled, or thrown away.\n\nI am a member of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM). Each year I send a contribution, and they send me a calendar highlighting 12 monthly Holocaust heroes. As I quickly flipped through, I was brought up short by the November entry. It was the photo that stopped me\u2014a young Irena Sendler, twenty-nine years old, who looked a lot like my niece. I read the short paragraph below the photo:\n\nIrena Sendlerowa, (1916\u2013UNKNOWN) As head of the children\u2019s division of Zegota, the Polish underground Council for Aid to Jews, social worker Irena Sendlerowa (code name \u201cJolanta\u201d) helped smuggle more than 2,500 Jewish children out of the Warsaw ghetto. Hiding them in orphanages, convents, schools, hospitals, and private homes, she provided each child with a new identity, carefully recording in code their Jewish names and placements so that surviving relatives could find them after the war. Arrested by the Gestapo in the fall of 1943, Sendlerowa was sentenced to death. Zegota rescued her before her execution. She assumed a new identity and continued her work for Zegota.\n\nI was stunned. I\u2019m a child of Holocaust survivors. How could I not know Irena Sendler\u2019s story? Everybody knows Oskar Schindler, who rescued 1,100 Jews from a German concentration camp in Poland and whose story was told in the Steven Spielberg film Schindler\u2019s List. Even at the USHMM, the preeminent scholars of the Holocaust didn\u2019t know much about Sendler. They had her birth year wrong (it was 1910, I later found out), and they didn\u2019t know if she was still alive.\n\nI kept this calendar in a file labeled \u201cInteresting Stuff.\u201d And there it sat for almost three years.\n\nPhoto caption These children rescued by Sendler were sent to live with new identities at a Polish convent, circa 1943. \u2014 World History Archive / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nThen, in February 2004, I came into my office one night to see a sick child. On my desk someone had left a copy of the Ladies Home Journal, opened to an article, \u201cThe Woman Who Loved Children.\u201d It was about Irena Sendler and three Kansas teens who uncovered her story. The article explained that, in 1999, while planning a National History Day project, they found a brief reference to Sendler in a U.S. News and World Report article entitled \u201cThe Other Schindlers.\u201d Sendler\u2019s story inspired their NHD project: a play they wrote and performed called Life in a Jar. It retold, in dramatic form, the emotional story of Sendler knocking on ghetto doors and asking Jewish parents to give up their children to save them. The title, Life in a Jar, refers to the lists Sendler buried.\n\nThe teens read that Irena had been arrested in 1943 by the Gestapo and tortured in Pawiak Prison, the most notorious prison in the ghetto, from which almost no one escaped. Logically, they began searching cemetery records and reached out to the Jewish Foundation for the Righteous, seeking information about where she might be buried. Soon after, they received a letter from the foundation, saying that Sendler was alive! She was in her nineties and living in poverty with her daughter-in-law in Warsaw. The foundation then put them in touch with Sendler.\n\nThe three students made plans to travel to Poland and meet Sendler, first trying to raise money through candy sales, until philanthropists and Holocaust survivors from the Kansas City Jewish community stepped in to help cover the trip. Traveling out of the country for the first time (the first time on a plane for one of them), the girls finally met Sendler at her Warsaw home in 2001. They maintained a tender friendship with her for the next seven years until she passed, making several trips to Poland to visit her, each time performing Life in a Jar at various venues. And they began working with Polish high school students who were telling the forgotten stories of rescuers from their own communities.\n\nPhoto caption The original three students\u2014Liz,Megan, and Sabrina\u2014are joined by Jessica Shelton-Ripper (third from left), who performed many times with Life in a Jar.

This story now took on a new dimension. I have been a closet writer most of my life, and I was thinking about writing a novella about the Warsaw ghetto. Irena Sendler seemed like a compelling character, and I wanted to know more about her. I was also intrigued by the two stories\u2014Irena\u2019s wartime history and the contemporary story of three Kansas teens. I called their teacher in Kansas, Norm Conard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s serendipitous that you should call,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for someone to write these two stories.\u201d\n\nI hesitated. I had not written nonfiction before, only fiction and poetry. But I felt the powerful synergy of these two stories. I was not eager to write a wartime history of a Holocaust hero because most Holocaust literature leaves me angry, sad, depressed, and frustrated. But this story was different\u2014an inspiring story of three typical American teenagers who helped restore the history of a great hero.\n\nI agreed to write the story and, in 2004, visited Uniontown, Kansas, where the girls went to school. A small town with a population of 264, it was down on its luck. Many stores were shuttered. It had the look of a Dorothea Lange or Walker Evans black-and-white photo from the Depression. I met Norm and the girls at the high school, and I was hooked.\n\nUniontown High School, with only about 120 students, is one of the lowest-income school districts in Kansas. There was no diversity in the school\u2014never a Jew, an African American, or even a Catholic\u2014yet these teens had discovered Sendler\u2019s story and told the world. I spent a week interviewing the students, their families, their teacher, community members, and Holocaust survivors from Kansas City who had taken a great interest in the play and the Irena Sendler project.\n\nMy wife and I accompanied the students and Conard to Poland on their third visit, in 2005. I was able to do more extensive research and interview Sendler, Holocaust scholars, and some of the children Sendler had rescued, now in their sixties and seventies. We met Elzbieta Ficowska, rescued as a six-month-old infant. Sendler had sedated her and put her in a carpenter\u2019s box. Her parents kissed their baby good-bye and left a small spoon in the box with her name inscribed on one side and her birthdate on the other. It is the only memento of her parents, who were murdered at Treblinka. She and I have become good friends, and I have held her spoon many times, always with tears. Ficowska became one of Sendler\u2019s caregivers and the chairperson of the Association of Children of the Holocaust in Poland.\n\nIt was Sendler\u2019s ninety-fifth birthday when I interviewed her. She was energetic, and her memory was clear and specific. She wanted to be sure that I credited all of her network of rescuers and liaisons. She ensured that I had everyone\u2019s name spelled correctly.\n\nPhoto caption Megan took this picture of Sendler on May 3, 2008, during a visit to Poland. Sendler passed away nine days later on May 12. \u2014 Megan Felt\n\nPoland was arguably the most victimized country in occupied Europe. The consequence for hiding or even feeding a Jew was execution, often in public as a warning to other Poles. When I asked Sendler why she put herself and her family at such risk, she said, \u201cIt was a need of my heart.\u201d She rejected the appellation of hero. \u201cI only did what any decent person would do. . . . The heroes were the babies\u2014they were the heroes of their mothers\u2019 hearts. . . . It was the parents and grandparents who gave up their children, they were the true heroes.\u201d\n\nShe said it was her father\u2019s teaching that inspired her. \u201cIf you see someone drowning you must rescue them, even if you cannot swim.\u201d And \u201cthere are only two kinds of people in the world, good and bad, regardless of race, religion, or creed. And most people are good.\u201d\n\nShe lamented that she had not done enough\u2014for every child they saved almost one hundred went to their deaths at Treblinka.\n\nSendler has become a Polish national hero. Poles have been eager to tell their stories, in part because the Life in a Jar project stimulated Polish/Jewish dialog as well as scholarship about Poland during the German occupation. Although there has been a disturbing return of anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial in Poland, Sendler\u2019s story continues to be told.\n\nYad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Jerusalem, recognizes more Righteous Gentiles\u2014those who rescued out of principle, not for personal gain\u2014from Poland than from any other country in occupied Europe. In 2019, it listed 27,362 Righteous Gentiles, with 6,992 from Poland, or around 26 percent. But because of postwar Poland\u2019s Communist anti-Semitism, Polish rescuers who had received Yad Vashem medals hid them and told no one of their wartime activities.\n\nAt one performance of Life in a Jar in Warsaw, I sat beside an old man, old enough to have been an adult during the war. Throughout the performance he sat with his hands together, clutching something inside. After the performance I asked him about it, and he opened his hands to reveal his Yad Vashem medal. There were tears in his eyes as he explained, \u201cI have kept this buried in my basement for 60 years. I told no one except my wife. I didn\u2019t tell my children, family, friends, or coworkers. Now, because of these American students, I can show this proudly. It was the finest thing I have ever done.\u201d\n\nMy first time in Warsaw, in 2005, I could find few markers of the Warsaw ghetto and no commemoration of the wall. In my research for the book, I found no reference to Irena Sendler before 2000 other than by Yad Vashem (1965 Righteous Gentile medal, and in 1983 a tree planted in her honor next to that of Raoul Wallenberg) and the U.S. News and World Report article that launched the Kansas teens on their National History Day project.\n\nWhen I returned in 2013 for the release of the Polish translation of my 2011 book Life in a Jar: The Irena Sendler Project (also translated into Russian, Chinese, and Mongolian), I saw how much had changed in Poland. Where there had been no markers of the wall, now there is a footprint, 10 inches wide that says, \u201cMUR GETTA/GHETTO WALL 1940\u20131943,\u201d placed in sidewalks and lawns showing the exact location of the ghetto wall. At each of the 22 gates there is a memorial plaque with a map and description of what happened in the ghetto.\n\nThere are now 35 Irena Sendler schools in Poland, three in Germany, one in France, and one in England. I have met to discuss Sendler with Poland\u2019s Deputy Foreign Secretary Jerzy Pomianowski, given radio, TV, and print interviews, and met with a journalist from the Catholic News Agency. The Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw opened in 2014, and the Lowell Milken Center Europe, a Polish office of the Irena Sendler/Life in a Jar Foundation, works with Polish teens on similar projects.\n\nThe project changed Poland as well as the American students who started it all. From my time with the Kansas teens, I learned that each girl knew something about losing or almost losing their own parent. Liz was abandoned by her parents as a young child and raised by her grandparents, Megan\u2019s mother developed cancer, and Sabrina\u2019s mother suddenly died during the project. The girls courageously allowed me to tell their own painful stories in my book. And it became clear to me that the last three children Irena Sendler rescued were the girls from Kansas.\n\nToday, Elizabeth Cambers Hutton has two master\u2019s degrees and teaches Holocaust history in Missouri. Sabrina Coons-Murphy is an elementary schoolteacher in Kansas. Megan Stewart Felt, the program coordinator for the Irena Sendler/Life in a Jar Foundation, still works with Norm Conard to further Sendler\u2019s legacy and continues to play Sendler in performances of Life in a Jar.\n\nThe story has also changed me. I am a German-American Jew, born after the war to parents who narrowly escaped the Holocaust. Others in my family did not. For the first five years of my life I lived in upper Manhattan, in Washington Heights\u2014an urban shtetl of German Jews who had survived the Holocaust. I didn\u2019t speak English until I was five years old. The Holocaust was the baffling but iconic story of my childhood, a subject of nervous, hushed, adult conversation. It was frightening, mysterious, impossible to grasp, yet everywhere\u2014it was the atmosphere. There was an awkward gracelessness on the part of those who lived through it, a furtiveness I now understand to be a kind of PTSD. It was the unacknowledged elephant in the living room\u2014huge but shrouded.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was in my twenties that I learned that my grandfather had been arrested on Kristallnacht, November 9, 1938, and imprisoned in Dachau. My grandmother went to high school with one of the administrative guards at Dachau. He accepted a bribe from her, and my grandfather was released after six months. In 1999, my parents were interviewed as part of Steven Spielberg\u2019s Shoah project. In the course of the interview my mother brought out her identity papers, marked \u201cJew,\u201d and her nursing certificate, stamped with a swastika. My brother and I had never seen these artifacts.\n\nGrowing up as a child of survivors, I had a sense of mission about the Holocaust, but didn\u2019t know how that would manifest. Now in my seventies, I find that in writing Life in a Jar, and speaking about it to new audiences, I am fulfilling that mission.\n\nIn my talks, sponsored by the Vermont Humanities Council, I emphasize how Sendler and the girls from Kansas were repairing the world\u2014tikkun olam in Hebrew. Few of us would have the courage to do what Sendler did, but all of us can do what Liz, Megan, and Sabrina did\u2014performing small acts of decency and respect for all people. Acts that change the world."}, {"url": "https://jwa.org/thisweek/oct/20/1943/this-week-in-history-irena-sendler-saves-jewish-children-from-warsaw-ghetto", "page_content": "On October 20, 1943, Irena Sendler threw a package out a window to a friend below, who quickly hid it under her arm. Coming up the stairs were nine Nazi soldiers, ready to arrest her for her work with the Polish underground. Sendler would be sent to the notorious Pawiak prison; there she was tortured to divulge the names of her co-conspirators and to reveal the contents of that package. The little parcel contained a list of the true identities of thousands of Jewish children whom Sendler and her team had smuggled out of the Warsaw Ghetto in 1942 and 1943, hiding them among non-Jewish families.\n\nBorn in 1910, Irena Sendler was a Catholic employee of the Warsaw Social Welfare Department when the Nazis herded hundreds of thousands of Jews into the 16-block ghetto. Joining Zegota, the Council for Aid to Jews led by the Polish underground resistance movement, Sendler enlisted workers in each of the ten centers of the Welfare Department to issue hundreds of forged documents to create new identities for Jewish children.\n\nSendler had agonizing discussions persuading Jewish parents to part with their children and Christian parents to shelter them; all were risking their lives if they were discovered. Some children were smuggled out in gunnysacks and bodybags, others in a mechanic\u2019s toolbox, in ambulances, and even coffins.\n\nSendler enlisted the active assistance of the Church in her work. Some children were taken in one door of a church in the ghetto and emerged through another door in the free zone, exiting with new Christian identities. Irena carefully noted the true names and family members of the youngsters in code and buried the list in jars under a neighbor\u2019s apple tree, hoping to one day dig up the jars and reunite the families.\n\nThe list was in the parcel Sendler threw out the window that day, re-buried by her compatriot. Some 2,500 children\u2019s names were in the jars.\n\nIn Pawiak prison, the Nazi soldiers broke Sendler\u2019s feet and legs, crippling her for life in their efforts to pry information from her. Sentenced to death, she escaped when her helpers bribed a Nazi guard and remained on the run for the rest of the war. When peace came, she dug up the jars again and used her notes to track down the children she had rescued; many had parents who were killed in the Holocaust. She never considered herself a heroine. \u201cI could have done more,\u201d she said later. \u201cThis regret will follow me to my death...Every child saved with my help is the justification of my existence on this Earth, and not a title to glory.\u201d\n\nIn 1965, Irena Sendler was accorded the title of The Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem in Jerusalem. But her achievement was barely recognized elsewhere until in 1999 a group of four Kansas students wrote a play about her, Life in a Jar, for their National History Day competition. The students won the state championship, and almost fifteen years later, the play is still performed, spreading the story of Irena Sendler to audiences across the country.\n\nSources: \u201cIrena Sendler,\u201d Auschwitz Online Resource; \u201cIrena Sendler,\u201dJewish Virtual Library; \u201cIrena Sendler: In the Name of Their Mothers,\u201d PBS; New York Times obituary, May13, 2008.\n\nVisit \u201cLife in a Jar\u201d for more information about the play."}, {"url": "https://www.ushmm.org/information/press/in-memoriam/irena-sendler-1910-2008", "page_content": "The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum mourns the passing of Irena Sendler, a Polish social worker who helped smuggle more than 2,500 Jewish children out of the Warsaw ghetto during the Holocaust.\n\nAs head of the children\u2019s section of \u017begota, the Polish underground Council for Aid to Jews, Irena (\u201cJolonta\u201d) Sendler regularly used her position as a social worker to enter the Warsaw ghetto and help smuggle children out.

About 400,000 Jews from the city and the surrounding region were forced to move into an area of 1.3 square miles. In mid-November the ghetto was sealed. On account of the cramped conditions, poor sanitation, and very limited food and medicine, disease and starvation claimed thousands of lives each month.\n\nIn July 1942, mass deportations of Jews from the Warsaw ghetto began. Most were sent to Treblinka. Horrified by the German persecution of the Jews, a group of Polish citizens formed an underground organization called the Council for the Aid to Jews, or Zegota, in September 1942. Irena Sendler became the head of Zegota\u2019s Children\u2019s Bureau. She obtained documents that allowed her to enter the ghetto, and she began to smuggle children out.\n\nIrena and the members of Zegota led some children out through the underground corridors of a courthouse and through a tram depot. They sedated some infants and carried them out in potato sacks or coffins. A church located on the edge of the ghetto also became useful. It had two entrances, one inside the ghetto and one on the Christian side of Warsaw. With Zegota\u2019s help, some children entered the church as Jews and exited as \u201cChristians.\u201d\n\nIn addition to smuggling children out of the ghetto, Irena found safe places for them to hide \u2013 often with Catholic families in the Warsaw area.

On October 20, 1943, she was arrested by the Gestapo and taken to Pawiak prison. Irena was tortured brutally, but she refused to give any information about Zegota or about the children she had placed in hiding. She was sentenced to death. Members of Zegota bribed one of the Gestapo agents, and on the day Irena was to be executed, she was permitted to escape. She had to go into hiding for the remainder of the war but continued to coordinate her rescue work. By January 1945, when Warsaw was liberated by Soviet troops, the Children\u2019s Bureau of Zegota had helped more than 2,500 Jewish children. The exact number of children saved by Irena and her partners is unknown.\n\nIrena Sendler passed away in May 2008 at the age of 98."}, {"url": "https://www.liveaction.org/news/irena-sendler-saved-children-nazis/", "page_content": "There have been many heroic women throughout history. The story of Irena Sendler, the woman who courageously defied the Nazis to save thousands of children, is truly amazing and significant for our times. A young Polish Catholic social worker in Warsaw during WWII, Sendler saved 2,500 Jewish children from the Nazis by smuggling them out of the Warsaw Ghetto.\n\nWhen War broke out in 1939, Sendler was 29 years old and working for the Welfare Department of the Warsaw Municipality. She worked in canteens throughout the city \u2013 places that provided food, money, and other necessities for orphans, the elderly, and the poor. She began giving aid to Jewish families through her organization, making false documents for them after the Germans invaded Poland in September 1939.\n\nIn October 1940, Jews living in Warsaw were placed in the ghetto, an area walled off from the rest of the city. A month later, the ghetto was sealed and 400,000 people were left there to die. The cramped, dirty, and impoverished conditions of the ghetto caused disease to spread rapidly. The death rate of Jews living in the ghetto reached 5,000 per month.\n\nSendler was horrified by the conditions in the ghetto. She joined Zegota, a council of the Polish underground resistance movement that aided Jews, and she succeeded in obtaining a legal pass to enter the ghetto from Warsaw\u2019s Epidemic Control Department. Disguised as a nurse, under the pretext of inspecting Jews for disease and giving medical aid, Sendler began smuggling Jewish children out of the ghetto. She saved the children from death by disease, starvation, or the Treblinka death camp, where the Nazis began deporting ghetto survivors in 1942.\n\nIrena, with a few helpers, found creative ways to take infants and children out of the ghetto. Infants were carried out in sacks, bodybags, carts, toolboxes, and even coffins. Older children were led through a church in the ghetto that opened up into the city.\n\nSendler gave the children she saved false identities and found homes for the children with generous families, convents, and orphanages. She wrote down each child\u2019s real name, family, and location on a slip of paper and placed the papers in jars which she buried, ironically enough, across the street from German barracks. After the War, she dug up the jars and tried to reunite families.\n\nIn October 1943, the Nazis became aware of Sendler\u2019s undercover activities and the Gestapo arrested her. Sendler was tortured severely in prison \u2013 the Nazis broke her legs and feet trying to force information from her \u2013 but Sendler bravely endured the torture and refused to betray the children and the people helping them. Sendler spent eight weeks in prison and was sentenced to death, but Zegota members bribed some Nazis to let her go, and she escaped.\n\nSendler was on the run from the Nazis during the remainder of the War, but she continued helping the Jews at great personal risk. After the War, she dug up the jars with the children\u2019s names and tracked down all 2,500 children and the locations of their families and relatives. She continued to be involved in social work for the rest of her life.\n\nSendler received many awards for her work, including the Polish Gold Cross of Merit and Israel\u2019s Righteous Among the Nations Award. Still, Sendler\u2019s story remained largely unknown, until four schoolgirls from Kansas did a project on her story in 1999, starting a worldwide movement.\n\nA movie, \u201cThe Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler,\u201d was released in 2009, the year after Sendler\u2019s death.\n\nThroughout her life, Sendler did not give herself much credit for what she did during the War. She said, \u201cEvery child saved with my help and the help of all the wonderful secret messengers, who today are no longer living, is the justification of my existence on this earth, and not a title to glory.\u201d\n\nOn another occasion she said, \u201cI was brought up to believe that a person must be rescued when drowning, regardless of religion and nationality. The term \u2018hero\u2019 irritates me greatly \u2013 the opposite is true \u2013 I continue to have pangs of conscience that I did so little.\u201d\n\nIn our time, when close to the number of children Sendler saved during WWII are being aborted every day in the United States, and children are being threatened in Ukraine near Sendler\u2019s native Poland, Sendler\u2019s story is a great inspiration and example for all of us to stand up to evil so others might live.\n\n\u201cLike\u201d Live Action News on Facebook for more pro-life news and commentary!"}]}
