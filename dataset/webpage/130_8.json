{"Bill Brown played in the 1967 European Cup Final, which Celtic lost 2\u20131 to Inter Milan.": [{"url": "https://www.thecelticwiki.com/1967-05-25-celtic-2-1-inter-milan-european-cup/", "page_content": "Celtic win the European Cup for the first time and create history.\n\nThe greatest day in the club\u2019s history, and a landmark in European footballing history.\n\nT rivia\n\nCeltic became the first British, Northern-European & Non-Latin side to win the European Cup.\n\nOnly Scottish club to have won the European Cup and reach the final.\n\nCeltic completed a clean sweep of all five competitions they entered \u2013 League, League Cup, Scottish Cup, Glasgow Cup & European Cup. An incredible achievement.\n\nThe winning team of players were dubbed \u2018The Lisbon Lions\u2018 in honour of their success.\n\nInter Milan were favourites and were previous winners of the tournament. Inter had lost only once in the European Cup in four successive seasons, winning the trophy twice and losing that sole game to Real Madrid. What a challenge!\n\nCeltic had an astonishing 42 attempts on goal to Inter\u2019s five, and Celtic had ten corners to Inter\u2019s nil. Inter\u2019s catenaccio defensive formation was truly destroyed.\n\nIn April 2010, highly regarded \u2018 World Soccer\u2019 magazine ranked this match amongst the top 50 games since the first publication of their magazine (50 years ago in April 1960).\n\nmagazine ranked this match amongst the top 50 games since the first publication of their magazine (50 years ago in April 1960). Rangers were in the final of the European Cup Winners Cup six days later against Bayern Munich in Nuremberg. They lost 1-0 and the city of Glasgow was denied a unique record.\n\nThe Lead-Up to the game\n\nThe game itself was played on a Thursday. But Celtic began their lead up to the game over a week before, immediately after their last Scottish league game against Kilmarnock. Celtic spent most of their time in Scotland after the last league game at Seamills training, relaxing and planning for the big game. As ever Jock Stein the master tactician closeted the players with schemes and tactics, so not only were they physically fit and prepared but they were also mentally sharp and ready.\n\nA report appeared in the Evening Times saying that a new Chicago football team were trying to entice Bobby Murdoch, Willie Wallace and Bobby Lennox to the USA with salaries around the \u00a320,000 mark being offered. As all three had re-signed for the new season the story was thought to be a ringer.\n\nThe Celtic party of 20 left for Lisbon on Tuesday 23rd May by charter flight from Glasgow Airport. As well as the side that played Celtic also took just about everybody that had played during the season. This included sub Fallon, Young, Cattanach, Cushley (the subject of overtures from West Ham), McBride (on the road to recovery from knee surgery), Hughes, Brogan, O\u2019Neill, and Charlie Gallacher.\n\nJock Stein was named British Manager of the Year for the second year in succession.\n\nOn the Monday prior to the game Inter found out that their ace striker Luis Suarez was out with a torn cartilage. He would not make the game.\n\nA training schedule was worked out on their arrival in Lisbon. The Players would train on the Estadio Nacional pitch on the Tuesday afternoon from 5:30pm. exactly 48 hours before the game. On Wednesday there would be a light training session with more talks on tactics and positions. Each team were allotted a time schedule on the pitch Inter were given from 10:00am and Jock Stein planned to bring the Bhoys to the ground to watch Inter training. In a bluff though, Herrera and Inter turned up early and when Celtic arrived at 10:30 Inter had finished and were gone. Instead Inter sat and watched Celtic train.\n\nThere was very much a feeling, both in Italy and in Portugal, that Inter were not a well-liked team. This came to a degree from their arrogance that they could and should win everything, but in Italy there was also a sense of something a little more underhand with referees and league planners. They were offhand with the Press and gave the feeling of being above their supporters. By contrast Jock Stein went out of his way to be accommodating and welcoming to the European Press and the Portugese, and this openness made Celtic friends.\n\nCeltic had already been invited to play Real Madrid in Alfredo di Stefano\u2019s Testimonial. But whilst they were in Lisbon they received a further invitation from the Spanish Football Federation to take part in a four-team tournament in Malaga in August. Celtic were considering the option.\n\nThe Thursday was fully mapped out. The Celtic players were under orders not to leave their beds before 10am. They were under orders NOT to go out in the sun at the hotel before arrival of the coach in the afternoon to take them to the stadium.\n\nMany of the players\u2019 wives travelled to watch the game leaving Glasgow early on Thursday morning. Over 20 charter flights left Glasgow airport between 1:30 and 9:30am to make the three to four hour flight to Lisbon.\n\nMatch Review\n\nCeltic had absolutely no chance of winning the European Cup according to outsiders. As Inter Milan had won the trophy twice before and had a glittering array of stars on the park, then Celtic were only there as cannon fodder. Big mistake, someone had forgot to tell big Jock and the rest of the Lisbon Lions.\n\nCeltic took to the field signing the Celtic song, to the amazement of the Milan players. Milan manager Herrera was furious when big Jock took the bench he had earmarked for himself, but his backside was planted and he was not moving.\n\nThe match kicked off and it was first blood to the Italians, Mazzola opened the scoring for Inter from a penalty award in the 7th minute, which to this day James Craig states was never a penalty as it was never a foul.\n\nCeltic followed the Stein script to the letter by firing in shot after shot until the Italian stronghold broke.Celtic got their just rewards, when Big Tam Gemmell blasted the ball into the Milan net from 20 yards, 1-1.\n\nWith 5 minutes left in the match it was Gemmell again, with a clever pass to Bobby Murdoch who drove the ball into the area, cannoning off Steve Chalmers and into the net for the winner. Celtic had ripped the script to shreds, 2-1.\n\nWith so little time left, the Inter Milan players could not do much more. They were run off their feet, and Celtic had made history and won the European Cup.\n\nJock Stein had been manager for a little over two seasons and had taken Celtic to the pinnacle of club success, the European Cup, the first British side to mount the summit.\n\nIt was a truly phenomenal achievement.\n\nMatch Details\n\nCeltic Team\n\nManager: Jock Stein\n\nRonnie Simpson ;\n\nJames Craig, Thomas Gemmell; Robert Murdoch, Billy McNeill (captain), John Clark;\n\nJimmy Johnstone, William Wallace, Stevie Chalmers, Bertie Auld, Robert Lennox\n\nReserve: John Fallon (goalkeeper)\n\nScorers:\n\n63\u2032 Tommy Gemmell 1-1\n\n84\u2032 Stevie Chalmers 2-1\n\nInternazionale (Inter Milan)\n\nManager: Helenio Herrera\n\nGiuliano Sarti; Tarcisio Burgnich, Giacinto Facchetti; Giancarlo Bedin, Aristide Guarneri, Armando Picchi (captain); Angelo Domenghini, Sandro Mazzola, Renato Cappellini, Mauro Bicicli, Mario Corso\n\nReserve: Ferdinando Miniussi (goalkeeper)\n\nScorers:\n\n6\u2032 Sandro Mazzola 0-1\n\nLocation: Est\u00e1dio Nacional, Vale do Jamor, near Lisbon\n\nDate: May 25, 1967\n\nAttendance: 45,000 spectators\n\nReferee: Kurt Tschenscher (Germany)\n\nStats\n\nInter\n\nCeltic\n\nGoal Attempts 5 42 Shots On Target 4 24 Shots Off Target 0 16 Fouls 20 20 Corners 0 10 Offside 2 7\n\nFull Game :\n\nHighlights:\n\nPictures\n\nLinks\n\nArticles\n\nPre-match Report\n\nMatch Reports\n\nStadium\n\nKStreet\n\nQuotes\n\nStein\u2019s inspiring pre-match battle cry was: \u201cIf you\u2019re ever going to win the European Cup, then this is the day and this is the place. But we don\u2019t just want to win this cup, we want to do it playing good football \u2013 to make neutrals glad we\u2019ve won it, glad to remember how we did it.\u201d\n\nJock Stein before the game\n\n\u2018We thought it would be impossible. We had seen Real Madrid play and all those teams, Milan and all those and we thought they were magnificent.\u2019\n\nBobby Lennox speaking in 2003 about the players assessment of success in 1967\n\n\u2018At that point we had no thoughts about winning the European Cup. In fact it was a big thrill for us to just go to Zurich because we had never been there.\u2019\n\nBobby Lennox speaking in 2003 about Celtic\u2019s opening tie of the European Cup 66/67.\n\n\u201cBig Jock always said we\u2019d win,\u201d Jinky recalled last time we met, \u201cbut, to be honest, I thought we\u2019d get a right gubbin\u2019. I can see them yet standing alongside us in the tunnel waiting to go out on the pitch: Facchetti, Domenghini, Mazzola, Cappellini, all six-footers wi\u2019 Ambre Solaire suntans, Colgate smiles and slicked-back hair. Each and every wan o\u2019 them looked like yon film star Cesar Romero. They even smelt beautiful.\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s us midgets. Ah\u2019ve got nae teeth, Bobby Lennox has\u2019nae any either, and old Ronnie Simpson\u2018s got the full monty, nae teeth top and bottom. The Italians are starin\u2019 doon at us and we\u2019re grinnin\u2019 back up at \u2019em wi\u2019 our great, gumsy grins. We must have looked like something oot o\u2019 the circus.\u201d\n\nJimmy \u201cJinky\u201d Johnstone\n\n\u201cIt (Winning the European Cup) might have been for Scotland, but it definitely wasn\u2019t for Britain\u2026it was for Celtic.\u201d\n\nBilly McNeill on European Cup Final win of 1967 (1995)\n\n\u201cI doubt whether they (Celtic) would beat us in the final at Lisbon. After all we need only one goal.\u201d\n\nInter Milan manager Herera on facing Celtic in 1967 final\n\n\n\n\u201cMy time will come!\u201d\n\nJock Stein to John Mackenzie of the Scottish Daily Express, prior to European Cup final 1967 after enduring snubs and mind games from opposite number Herrera (Inter Milan Manager)\n\nStein\u2019s inspiring pre-match battle cry was: \u201cIf you\u2019re ever going to win the European Cup, then this is the day and this is the place. But we don\u2019t just want to win this cup, we want to do it playing good football \u2013 to make neutrals glad we\u2019ve won it, glad to remember how we did it.\u201d\n\nJock Stein before the game 25th March 1967\n\n\u201cTell me, the 9 o\u2019clock and 10 o\u2019clock mass are all ticket?\u201d\n\nJock Stein joking to Hugh McIlvaney on the surge of Celtic fans coming to Lisbon to see the team play in the European Cup Final (retold by Hugh McIlvaney)\n\nItalian interviewer: \u201cWho is your star player?\u201d\n\nJock Stein: \u201cMadam, I have eleven stars & their names are on the programme\u201d\n\nJock Stein interview question (May 1967)\n\n\u201cI am now going to tell him (Herrera) how Celtic will be the first team to bring the European Cup back to Britain. But it will not help him in any manner, shape or form: we are going to attack as we have never attacked before. Cups are not won by individuals, but by men in a team who put their club before personal prestige. I am lucky \u2013 I have the players who do just that for Celtic\u201d\n\nJock Stein 23rd May 1967\n\n\u201cWe must play as if there are no more games, no more tomorrows\u2026\u201d\n\nJock Stein, shortly before kick off in Lisbon\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t just want to win the European Cup. We want to do it playing good football, to make neutrals glad we won it, pleased to remember how we did it.\u201d\n\nJock Stein before the European Cup win in 1967\n\n\u201cComing here you\u2019ve made history, go out and play to your capability and enjoy yourself\u201d\n\nJock Stein to the players as they were to go out to play in the European Cup Final (1967)\n\n\u201cWe just knew, even after 15 minutes, that we were not going to keep them out. It was a miracle that we were still 1-0 up at half-time. Sometimes in those situations your confidence increases and you start to believe. Not on that day. Even in the dressing room at half-time we looked at each other and we knew we were doomed\u2026\n\n(Following the equaliser) \u201cI remember at one point Picchi turned to the goalkeeper and said \u2018Giuliano, let it go, just let it go. Sooner or later they\u2019ll get the winner\u2019. I never thought I would hear those words. I never imagined my captain would tell our keeper to throw in the towel. But that shows how destroyed we were at that point. It\u2019s as if we did not want to prolong the agony.\u201d\n\nInter Milan defender Tarcisio Burgnich speaking about the game years later, from \u2018Inverting The Pyramid \u2013 A History of Football Tactics\u2019 by Jonathan Wilson (2008).\n\n\u201cI shall be a Celtic supporter on Thursday.\u201d\n\nScott Symon, Rangers manager, in an interview with Tuttosport. He predicted the Celtic victory (1967)\n\n\n\n\u201cOnce Inter scored, John Clark and I could have gone and sat in the stand.\u201d\n\nBilly McNeill on the 1967 European Cup final\n\n\u201cCeltic had proved that attacking football had a future, and it wasn\u2019t just Shankly who was grateful for that.\u201d\n\nFrom the seminal \u2018Inverting The Pyramid \u2013 A History of Football Tactics\u2019 by Jonathan Wilson (2008)\n\n\u201cWe were also angry with the manager because he had watched them play and hadn\u2019t told us they were so good.\u201d\n\nInter Milan legend Sandro Mazzola (2017)\n\nAfter winning the European Cup\n\n\u201cWe did it by playing football. Pure, beautiful, inventive football\u201d.\n\nJock Stein\n\n\u201cThere is always a time to move on.\u201d\n\nJock Stein\n\n\u201cWe can have no complaints. Celtic deserved their victory. We were beaten by Celtic\u2019s force. Although we lost, the match was a victory for sport.\u201d\n\nHelenio Herrera, Inter Milan manager after the 1967 European Cup Final\n\n\u201cThis team will never be beaten!\u201d\n\nJock Stein to Bill Shankly on bus back, overheard by Bertie Auld\n\n\u201cThere is not a prouder man on God\u2019s Earth than me at this moment. Winning was important, aye, but it was the way that we have won that has filled me with satisfaction. We did it by playing football. Pure, beautiful, inventive football. There was not a negative thought in our heads. Inter played right into our hands; it\u2019s so sad to see such gifted players shackled by a system that restricts their freedom to think and to act. Our fans would never accept that sort of sterile approach. Our objective is always to try to win with style.\u201d\n\nJock Stein, 1967\n\n\u201cWhat a performance, what a performance\u201d\n\nBill Shankley\n\n\n\nInterviewer : \u201cWhat a wonderful season!\u201d\n\nJock Stein: \u201cAye, but what do I do next year?\u201d\n\n\u201cI actually broke down in tears of joy that night, the first time in all my years in the game that I had cried. What a thrill it was to see young boys like Murdoch, McNeill, Johnstone, Gemmell, Clark and Lennox coming of age. What a thrill it was to see the club I had served all my life reach its pinnacle. My one ambition now is to live long enough to shed some more tears into that magnificent European Cup.\u201d\n\nCeltic legend Jimmy McGrory on the victory (from A Lifetime in Paradise, 1975)\n\n\u201cWords just cannot express this achievement after such a wonderful season.\u201d\n\nRangers\u2019 Scot Symon on Celtic\u2019s European Cup win, 1967\n\n\u201cWe hope that the next hands on the European Cup are yours.\u201d\n\nProphetic words from Jock Stein to Matt Busby in 1967, as he received the BBC Sports team of the year award form 1967 (Man U under Matt Busby ended up winning the European Cup in 1968)\n\n\n\n\u201cPlayers come and go but some achievements live forever. The thing about the Lisbon Lions is we stick together for everything in the bad times and the good times, we\u2019re always there.\u201d\n\nJohn Clark on Lisbon Lions, the greatest of them all\n\n\u201cFor an assassination of Celtic\u2019s character was now under-way by those, particularly outside Scotland but not exclusively so, who paid scant attention to the preliminaries before Montevideo and who in any case could not accept Celtic\u2019s achievements as anything other than fortuitous.\n\n\u201cOne such was Peter Lorenzo, an English journalist and broadcaster who was known to have given Celtic some savaging in his reports and was upbraided by an equally famous Scottish journalist James Sanderson, or \u2018 Solly \u2018 as he was generally known, in the airport lounge before flying home from Montevideo when there was a delay for two hours due to fog. In keeping with the mayhem of the preceding day, Solly, who would have entered the ring as a bantamweight, decided to defend Celtic\u2019s honour against the heavyweight Lorenzo\u2019s bad-mouthing by delivering him a swift right hook to the jaw, which floored the Englishman. Although apologies were made for this misconduct, by other journalist\u2019s, Solly had acted as many of his colleagues had felt like doing, though they opted to chose the old adage that the pen is mightier than the sword.\u201d\n\nArchie MacPherson from his biography on Jock Stein\n\n\u201cRangers or Celtic? My first feeling was Celtic. When I was 13 years old I saw for the first time in my life a European Cup final \u2013 Inter against Celtic. That image is, even today, clear in my mind; that day, that game, Jimmy Johnston, Riva\u2026 I was so impressed. When I was in Mozambique, far away from football in Europe, I always remembered that day and that team. Especially because when they started to play in the national stadium in Portugal I thought Celtic were Sporting Lisbon because they dressed like Sporting.\u201d\n\nCarlos Quieroz (Man U assistant manager in 2007)\n\n\n\n\u201cTo get a team from within a 25-mile radius of Glasgow going up against that Inter Milan, coming from a goal down and going on to win, it\u2019s an unbelievable story. The only one that\u2019s looked to match it since has been Leicester winning the Premier League last year. But although that\u2019s a creditable second, it\u2019s a good distant second.\n\n\u201cIt (Lisbon) was a frightening achievement. It was surreal when they won it but to think that 50 years have now passed \u2013 time just flies by.\n\n\u201cThe achievement will always be number one. And the way that team went about their work after Lisbon, and the success they enjoyed, was a huge credit to them and their attitude.\u201d\n\nKenny Dalglish on the Lisbon Lions (2017)\n\n\u201cThe greatest feat in football. They set the pattern for a period, particularly when Manchester United the next year did it. From \u201965 to \u201967, if someone had written a book about it they would call it fiction. It was amazing.\u201d\n\nAlex Ferguson (2017)\n\nThe Match in their own words\n\nBERNIE BOYLE was a 29-year-old draughtsman and a fanatical Celtic fan.\n\nSTEVIE CHALMERS was 30 years old and the Celtic centre-forward.\n\nJOHN CLARK was the 26-year-old Celtic left-half.\n\nJACKIE CONNOR was a 44-year-old bookmaker and friend of Jock Stein.\n\nBOBBY LENNOX was 23 years of age and played on the left wing for Celtic.\n\nBILLY McNEILL was an established Scottish international and was the 27-year-old captain of Celtic.\n\nJACK MARSHALL was a 43-year-old a wholesale confectioner. He first saw Celtic play in 1936 and even followed their fortunes from a POW camp in World War II.\n\nERNIE WILSON was a 25-year-old unemployed, soon-to-be-divorced Celtic fan.\n\nTHE BUILD UP\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cAt the beginning of the season I don\u2019t really think the European Cup was on our horizon at all to be fair. I think we thought we were just going to enjoy the adventure.\u201d\n\nJohn Clark: \u201cOnce we got by the first stage of the European Cup people started looking up and saying, \u2018There\u2019s a team in Scotland that seems to be doing well\u2019. Every time we progressed to the next stage we got more confident about ourselves.\u201d\n\nJackie Connor: \u201cAt that time the players mixed with the fans. Everybody knew Bertie Auld, big \u2018Tam\u2019 Gemmell, wee Jimmy Johnstone. They were OUR team and every one of them was friendly with the fans.\u201d\n\nBilly McNeill: \u201cWe were all very local boys. Bobby Lennox had come the farthest and that was only 30 miles away on Ayrshire coast. The rest of us lived virtually next door to the ground. Having come through the ranks at Celtic without any real success was the thing that stimulated that group of players. We were very determined, very positive in our attitude to the game. When Big Jock had come back to Celtic in 1965 he realised the potential and really got us playing to our full.\u201d\n\nErnie Wilson: \u201cWhen Celtic got through we just couldn\u2019t believe that our team was going to play in the European Cup final. Even if we didn\u2019t win, the thought of just being there was just terrific. Even friends who were Rangers supporters were wishing me luck when they heard that I was going. They told me not to come back to Glasgow without the trophy.\u201d\n\nJackie Connor: \u201cWho had ever heard of a team of local boys from Glasgow getting to the European Cup final. Everyone thought that it would be an impossible feat to beat Inter Milan. They were the top team at the time and Helenio Herrera was reckoned the best manager in the world. It was fully understood that if they scored a goal you just packed your bags and went home. They were the unbeatables.\u201d\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cI think they had won the European Cup twice in the previous three years and they had also won the world club championship \u2013 they had a lot of good players.\u201d\n\nBernie Boyle: \u201cEverybody was very excited, no doubt about it. If you look at pictures of people leaving for this game, they were going dressed in suits and collars and ties. A workingman in Glasgow wouldn\u2019t wear a collar and tie unless he was either going to church on Sunday or going to something special like a wedding or a funeral. These guys went to that game dressed in collars and ties because it really was something special.\u201d\n\nJackie Connor: \u201cThere had been nothing seen like the contingent that went out to Lisbon. Celtic fans just took over all forms of transport and a lot of guys even set off in old bangers and you\u2019d wonder how they were going to get out of London Road, never mind get to Lisbon.\u201d\n\nErnie Wilson: \u201cI saw on the news that the fans were leaving by car and coach and that\u2019s when it really got to me that I had to be there. I would have done anything bar murder or rob a bank to see my team play in the European Cup final. But I\u2019d just been laid off work from my job as a fireman on the old steam engines and I just couldn\u2019t raise the money to go, so I gave my scarf to a friend, John McCabe, so that if I wasn\u2019t there, at least my scarf got there.\u201d\n\nBernie Boyle: \u201cI had been due to travel out on a charter flight that a local pub had been running but they overbooked the plane and I was one of the people they let down. I phoned about trying to find a spare seat on a plane but with no success I drove to Glasgow Airport and explained my predicament. I must have been sat there for an hour when I was rushed onto an aircraft, where I found myself seated next to my boyhood hero, Charlie Tully, who had played for Celtic for many years. I arrived in Lisbon at six o\u2019clock the next morning.\u201d\n\nErnie Wilson: \u201cI was sitting in my house a week ahead of the game, desperately wanting to go when I had a brainstorm. I decided to sell my house. I told my wife that I was moving in with my mother and got managed to get a deposit on the house and this got me to Lisbon. When I came back I still had to go through with the deal to sell and needless to say it didn\u2019t go down very well with my wife. It had been a kind of a trial separation, but it was looking liked I would be staying on for the kids. Of course when I broke the news of what I\u2019d done, that was goodbye to my marriage. It was worth every penny. I\u2019m sure my family didn\u2019t see it like that at the time but I had to get there.\u201d\n\nBilly McNeill: \u201cFor about four or five days before we left Glasgow for Lisbon we had been down at Seamill, which was a hotel down the Ayrshire coast that we would use for training. It was a relaxed training session and during the course of those four or five days we started to hear the names of the Inter Milan players and how the \u2018Big Man\u2019 thought they would set themselves up.\u201d\n\nJohn Clark: \u201cJock Stein had been invited out to Milan a few years earlier to watch Herrera\u2019s methods of training. Little did he know at the time that he would be facing Herrera in the European Cup final maybe two years hence.\u201d\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cWe knew about Facchetti and all these guys, they were great players \u2013 Mazzola, Bicicli, Burgnich, they were all top men at the time. They were a team of internationals.\u201d\n\nJackie Connor: \u201cI was a bookmaker at the time and I\u2019d made Celtic favourites to win the final, which was ridiculous. I took out an advert in the newspaper \u2013 everyone thought I was off my head but it got me plenty of publicity.\u201d\n\nBernie Boyle: \u201cAs fans we weren\u2019t afraid of Inter because we knew little or nothing about European football. For that particular game I would say the vast majority of fans stepped on board an aeroplane for the first time in their lives.\u201d\n\nLISBON\n\nBilly McNeill: \u201cWe went to Lisbon early on the Tuesday morning and the game was on the Thursday. We did a reasonable training session on the Tuesday evening and after the game Jock announced the team at a press conference \u2013 two days before the game. I think that was to let Inter see that we weren\u2019t afraid of them.\n\nStevie Chalmers: \u201cJock was always a move in front of everybody else and he would have done that to upset Herrera.\u201d\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cThe team was exactly as had been expected. That team had played in the second leg of the semi-final and it had played the last couple of league games. If there had been a change in the team it would have been a surprise.\u201d\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cHerrera was trying to get the Portuguese to support Inter Milan but I think most of them came for the underdogs and supported us, which was great for us, but we had a massive support with us anyway.\u201d\n\nJohn Clark: \u201cWe were the underdogs by a mile, but we were a team full of confidence in our own ability and teamwork, plus we had an excellent manager who prompted us all the time and made sure our feet were on the ground. We concentrated a lot on what we were asked to do and we did it thoroughly.\u201d\n\nJackie Connor: \u201cCeltic fans knew that they had a chance because the team didn\u2019t play like everybody else. The backs \u2013 Jim Craig and big \u2018Tam\u2019 Gemmell \u2013 were actually forwards, which had never been seen before. They were up beside the wingers Jimmy Johnstone and Bobby Lennox every game. Whenever Gemmell or Craig got the ball they were at liberty to go up the pitch and that baffled other teams because they couldn\u2019t work out how these guys got the freedom on the park.\u201d\n\nBilly McNeill: \u201cOn the Wednesday morning we did a training session at the stadium. Inter Milan switched their training so they could sit and watch us, but that only helped to make us more determined.\u201d\n\nStevie Chalmers: \u201cWe thought they were having a good laugh at us, that we were a nothing team. I honestly believe they thought they\u2019d only to turn up and they\u2019d win. They sat there laughing, so the boss just said to us, \u2018Okay, we\u2019ll show them very little, we\u2019ll just muck about\u2019.\u201d\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cBig Jock had everybody playing in different positions. We had as much fun watching them as they did watching us. Jock said, \u2018You go and play left-back Bobby and Tommy Gemmell will go and play centre-forward and Billy McNeill will go to the sidelines\u2019. At that session nobody played where they would have normally. The cat and mouse stuff had started.\u201d\n\nJohn Clark: \u201cJock was a bit of a psychologist that way. The Italians were overconfident, but these guys were the superstars of the football world at the time.\u201d\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cWe stayed in a hotel called the Pal\u00e1cio in Estoril and it was absolutely wonderful. It was a beautiful hotel set in lovely gardens with a fabulous swimming pool, which we didn\u2019t use because Big Jock wanted to keep us out of the sun. The build up was great and everything that could have been done was done for us.\u201d\n\nJackie Connor: \u201cI was very friendly with Jock Stein and I knew a lot of the players. We would often go to training and spend time with the team at their hotel when they were playing away, but for the Inter Milan game they were kept more to themselves than usual. Any other game they were free to do more or less what they liked, but for that game Jock didn\u2019t even allow them to take their strips of at the hotel in case they got sunburnt.\u201d\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cI shared a room with Jimmy Johnstone as usual. Although he was a great player he was he was a bit of a worrier. He\u2019d be saying, \u2018But they\u2019ve got Facchetti and they\u2019ve got Mazzola\u2019. I\u2019d say, \u2018But we\u2019ve got you and Billy and Tommy Gemmell, we\u2019ve got great players in our team too\u2019.\u201d\n\nBilly McNeill: \u201cWe were so relaxed on the night before the game. There was a lad called Brodie Lennox who had a country club not far from the hotel and he\u2019d invited us to his house. He put on a meal for us and we watched England play against Spain on his television. We walked back the hotel afterwards.\n\nJohn Clark: \u201cOn the way back the trainer Neil Mochan took us on a short cut but it came to a dead end and we had to climb over a fence. On the eve of the European Cup final we were climbing over a fence to get back onto the road again.\u201d\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cWhen we got back to the hotel we had a wee cup of tea, as usual. There were be a few nerves but there were more nerves the next day.\u201d\n\nTHE DAY OF THE GAME\n\nStevie Chalmers: \u201cIt was a Holy Day Of Obligation and you\u2019re supposed to go to mass.\u201d\n\nJohn Clark: \u201cA friend of ours, Father Bertie O\u2019Reagan, was in Lisbon and when Jock Stein found out it was a religious day he asked him if he would he say Mass for the players who had to go. We\u2019d been brought up in the religious way and you always kept to your rules. It worked out for us and God looked after us.\u201d\n\nStevie Chalmers: \u201cThere were four non-Catholics in the team \u2013 Ronnie Simpson, Tommy Gemmell, Willie Wallace and Bertie Auld \u2013 and they obviously didn\u2019t go to church, but they didn\u2019t think anything of it because it often happened when we were playing away and they would just make a joke about it. But it wasn\u2019t a team of sectarianism in any way, we were all working together.\u201d\n\nBilly McNeill: \u201cIt was important because a lot of the lads were good living and religion was an important aspect of their lives, but it was also good because it ate into the morning and it gave us something to concentrate on.\u201d\n\nBernie Boyle: \u201cThe majority of Celtic fans were Catholics, so the chapels were packed with fans and I think it helped win over the Lisbon people. The locals were expecting these cold-hearted Scots and there we were, not only singing and dancing in the main square and showing off our colours, but attending Mass too.\u201d\n\nErnie Wilson: \u201cIt was the first time I\u2019d been abroad and when I arrived in Lisbon all the Celtic fans were gathered in the plaza in the city centre, but who was the first face I saw but John McCabe \u2013 and he still had my scarf wrapped round his neck. So I ended up at the game with my scarf.\u201d\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cThe kick-off was at five o\u2019clock so when we got back to the hotel we had our lunch and got away to our beds and spent the afternoon resting.\u201d\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cWe had the team-talk at the hotel. Jock just said, \u2018You know it\u2019s been a wonderful season and this can be a season that we can all look back on with great fondness. It can be the best season of our careers\u2019.\u201d\n\nJohn Clark: \u201cHe told us was that we had a chance to make history, that the opportunity was there and the platform was there for each and every one of us to make history.\u201d\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cOn the way to the stadium I think the coach driver went the wrong way, but we were at the back of the bus singing songs so we wouldn\u2019t have particularly noticed anyway.\u201d\n\nBilly McNeill: \u201cThe stadium was set in a national park and it was chaos around the ground, but we got there eventually and I think sometimes things like take your mind off the game and you can relax.\u201d\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cWe arrived 50 minutes before kick-off, which suited us perfectly. We came into the stadium, walked up the tunnel and onto the park. The Celtic support were already in, thousands of them. We waved to the supporters and then went back into the dressing room. There was no time to sit about and worry or get too nervous.\u201d\n\nJack Marshall: \u201cI flew in just for in time for the match. Approaching the ground we were jammed in the traffic and getting held back, so I jumped out of the mini bus coming to the stadium and I held up the traffic so we wouldn\u2019t miss the match. We got us in just in time. It wasn\u2019t a big ground but it was marvellous, with beautiful surroundings and with trees along one side.\u201d\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cWhen I first saw the stadium I thought it was spectacular. It was three sided with a wee press box along one side and I could picture Billy going up to collect the cup at the top of the podium.\u201d\n\nTHE GAME\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cJock could usually be like anything with the players, depending on what side of the bed he had got out of, but before that game he was wonderful. He got us all at ease and talked to us all before the game and he was very calm and relaxed. We had been given the bench in the shade and Inter were given the bench in the sun and when we went out they were sitting on our bench. Big Jock had to threaten them to move them on.\u201d\n\nBilly McNeill: \u201cWe came out of the dressing room and through a courtyard, before going into a long tunnel. They held us there for a while. I remember turning round and the Italian team were looking absolutely magnificent. It\u2019s quite an inspiring strip, the blue and black stripes, the black shorts, black stockings, the tanned legs, the athleticism of their team and the handsome Italian faces. Then out of nowhere Bertie Auld, a real Glaswegian character, started singing \u2018The Celtic Song\u2019 and we all joined in. You should have seen the expressions on the faces of the Italians.\u201d\n\nJohn Clark: \u201cThey must have got the shock of their lives \u2013 how do you deal with a team singing a football song seconds before they walk out to play in a big game.\u201d\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cThe next thing we were up the steps and suddenly the green and white scarves went up from the big Celtic support. It was wonderful.\u201d\n\nBilly McNeill: \u201cThe biggest thing I had to do as captain was in illustrating to the team that we had nothing to fear. I had to swap pennants with their captain, Picchi before the kick-off. We exchanged words but I didn\u2019t have any Italian and I don\u2019t think he had any English, but you always manage to get through.\u201d\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cRight after kick-off Bicicli ran past me and planted a kiss on the side of my cheek and then just carried on. I guess he was kind of excited. It\u2019s different if you score a goal and your team-mates plant one on your cheek but that was strange.\u201d\n\nStevie Chalmers: \u201cIn those days the Italians played very defensively and they marked man-to-man. One of our plans for the game was for our forwards to take their defenders to stupid positions because they were going to follow us, leaving spaces for our fullbacks to attack. Left-back Tommy Gemmell had six or seven shots on goal inside six or seven minutes, really good shots. We played the game an awful lot quicker than the Italians. Now they were all superb players but they were not used to people coming at them, which is what we did.\u201d\n\nBernie Boyle: \u201cThere was a kind of calmness amongst the fans before the game that was shattered in the seventh minute when the penalty was given.\u201d\n\nBilly McNeill: \u201cWith catenaccio in vogue then, the worst thing we wanted to do was concede an early goal. I don\u2019t know what happened to Jim Craig because we pushed out to keep the game as tight as we could and all of a sudden Jim was five yards behind us. Although he swears he didn\u2019t bring Cappellini down, it looks now as though he did.\u201d\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cWith just seven minutes gone I thought it was never a penalty, but when you look at it now it was. At the time, though, you think you\u2019ve been hard done by.\u201d\n\nErnie Wilson: \u201cThere was a sinking feeling among the fans when Inter scored, but a chorus of \u2018Hail, hail\u2019 went up and the whole crowd just started to lift themselves again and we knew it was just a matter of time until Celtic were going to score. There was just wave after wave of attack as they hit the woodwork three times. I don\u2019t know if Sarti ever had a game like it, but I\u2019d certainly never seen a goalkeeping display of the like in my life.\u201d\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cBefore the game we\u2019d heard that Sarti, the goalkeeper, was the weak link in the Inter team but he was absolutely great for them.\u201d\n\nJohn Clark: \u201cJock had told us that Inter were a team who would want us to come to them all the time and the more you come to them, the more you\u2019ve got to be on your toes, because they liked to hit you on the break. When they got the goal with the penalty kick, that\u2019s more or less what they did, but they didn\u2019t realise that we could come at them all night.\u201d\n\nJackie Connor: \u201cCeltic were playing the game like they were down at Barrowfields where they trained. They had no anxieties at all.\u201d\n\nBilly McNeill: \u201cAt half-time Jock Stein calmed us down just a little bit because we all thought that the referee had done us in just a little bit by the penalty kick. He hadn\u2019t as it happened, but I think it suited Big Jock that he could have a wee go at us. He said, \u2018Never mind concentrating on what the referee had done, we can\u2019t do anything about that, it\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna do in the second half that\u2019s important\u2019.\u201d\n\nJack Marshall: \u201cI was with this feller who was bursting for the toilet at half-time. Inside the ground there was lots of shrubbery and trees. He went in there and the next minute he came out with two policemen with their guns out and they were going to arrest him.\u201d\n\nJackie Connor: \u201cBig Jock had a theory and I know this from talking to him. They had no chance of scoring against that mob if they were in the Inter penalty box, so they had to get it ball outside the box \u2013 and that\u2019s where our goal came from.\u201d\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cThe two full backs had got up the park at the same time, which shouldn\u2019t really have happened, but just shows how much we were on top.\u201d\n\nJackie Connor: \u201cThe ball was passed back from Craig to Tommy Gemmell and the next thing the ball was in the back of the net, through about eight Milan players. The place erupted then.\u201d\n\nBernie Boyle: \u201cWhen Tommy Gemmell\u2019s goal went in it was probably one of the most beautiful goals that you\u2019ll ever see in a European Cup final. I\u2019ve never hugged so many people in my life.\u201d\n\nJohn Clark: \u201cIt was a thunderous shot from 25 yards out. It was unstoppable.\u201d\n\nErnie Wilson: \u201cI jumped up and a Portuguese chap in a Celtic scarf got hold of me and he was shouting, \u2018Celtic, Celtic\u2019. I was on cloud nine.\u201d\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cWhen the ball went in we all jumped on top of big Tommy. It was relief and pleasure \u2013 all the emotions at one time. We know when that went in that we were going to win the match.\u201d\n\nStevie Chalmers: \u201cIf we\u2019d have got beaten we\u2019d have got credit for going there and putting up a good performance, but I didn\u2019t feel as if we were in awe of these people \u2013 we really took the game to them and let them worry about it.\u201d\n\nJohn Clark: \u201cIn the 83rd minute Bobby Murdoch hit a tremendous shot across goal. Whether it was going in or not I don\u2019t know, but Stevie Chalmers prodded it in and made it 2-1 for us.\u201d\n\nJackie Connor: \u201cI was in ecstasy. I was jumping up and down \u2013 I think I nearly squeezed my wife to death.\u201dStevie Chalmers: \u201cPeople say that was quite lucky \u2013 but Jock Stein had us working on that move at least three times a week.\u201d\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cStevie must have done that a thousand times in training \u2013 the ball came through and he pushed it in the corner of the net.\u201d\n\nErnie Wilson: \u201cI think I burst out crying. We were going to be European Champions, the first British team to do it. The way Celtic were playing they probably could have moved up the park and scored a third goal, but they just played it about. It was wonderful.\u201d\n\nBilly McNeill: \u201cAfter we scored the second goal I was convinced that we would be up against it, so I said to John Clark, \u2018This is when we\u2019ve got to win this, we\u2019ve got to play\u2019, but they didn\u2019t. I think they were a spent force. They\u2019d underestimated the ability that we had in that side and I think they also underestimated our fitness. The conditions were ideal for an Italian team, but we were running and chasing and hunting right to the last minute of the game. By the end of the game they were a much more tired team than we were.\u201d\n\nErnie Wilson: \u201cI remember Jimmy Johnstone running down time at the end of the game and he took the ball for a walk. Three Inter players came round him and were desperate to get the ball back. Jimmy gave a wee drop of one shoulder and then a wee drop of the other \u2013 then he was away. He left the three of them for dead.\u201d\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the final whistle \u2013 I was in the centre circle near John Clark and the two of us jumped into each others arms and jumped about deliriously. \u201d\n\nJohn Clark: \u201cBobby Lennox and myself were hugging each other on the halfway line and that\u2019s the last I can remember about the final whistle because then the crowd broke onto the field.\u201d\n\nBernie Boyle: \u201cAfter the equalising goal I had moved down, along with hundreds of others, to this big wall that ran around the pitch. On the other side of the wall there was a small moat and armed Portuguese police stood facing us. When the final whistle went a few fans jumped over on to the grass. It was a trickle to start with \u2013 I watched a man who was the same age as my father jumping over and thought if he can do it, I can too. It was the only time in my life I ran onto the park.\u201d\n\nJack Marshall: \u201cA lot of the fans fell into the moat and had to be pulled out. By the time they got to the park they were kissing the grass, doing the highland fling and cutting bits of the grass out. I just sat and laughed at all these characters going cuckoo.\u201d\n\nBilly McNeill: \u201cA few of the boys had to make a mad dash to Ronnie Simpson\u2019s goal \u2013 the ones with false teeth had kept them in Ronnie Simpson\u2019s cap in the goal so they could put them in quickly for the presentation, but Ronnie forgot to bring them when he ran up the pitch to join us. Thankfully they were still there. It was astonishing that no-one had taken the bonnet as a souvenir.\u201d\n\nStevie Chalmers: \u201cI changed jerseys with Bedin, who had been marking me. Then I tried to get to the dressing room. By that time there were thousands of Celtic supporters on the park and it was very difficult to get off because the people were wanting to take your jerseys, your boots, anything as souvenirs.\u201d\n\nErnie Wilson: \u201cI jumped onto the park and headed for what players I could see. I got hold of big \u2018Tam\u2019 Gemmell and hugged him and I chased after Bobby Lennox. I feel sorry for the players, as they were getting strips ripped off them. I saw Billy McNeill and the scratches that man had on his back were unbelievable, just from people trying to get the strip off him. Two big heavy men were shielding him and trying to get him into the tunnel.\u201d\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cOnce the crowd started to get on the park we all scattered back into the tunnel and the changing room. I think it was Burgnich that I met in the tunnel and the two of us swapped strips.\u201d\n\nStevie Chalmers: \u201cIt was chaos in the dressing room. It was mostly reporters and friends of the manager. Bill Shankly was there and he congratulated everybody and said what a great man Jock was.\u201d\n\nErnie Wilson: \u201cThere was an announcement, first in English, then in Italian and Portuguese, saying that the presentation of the trophy would be delayed.\u201d\n\nBilly McNeill: \u201cI remember Big Jock coming to me and saying that I and myself and the assistant manager Sean Fallon had to go and get the trophy. At the time I hadn\u2019t a clue what he was talking about because we were back in the dressing room and we were jumping up and down for joy.\u201d\n\nBernie Boyle: \u201cIt was only Billy McNeill who was taken through the crowd up to this huge balcony with pillars on either side of him. I think the fact that the Celtic fans had invaded the pitch then prevented the team coming out again.\u201d\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cWe didn\u2019t know the cup wasn\u2019t there or that Billy wasn\u2019t there. The dressing room was chaos.\u201d\n\nErnie Wilson: \u201cWe stood in a massive crowd and waited for the trophy to come up. We saw the green and white strip coming out and it was Billy and when he raised it I don\u2019t think there was a dry eye in the house. I can still see him now \u2013 that big smile of his when he held it up.\u201d\n\nBilly McNeill: \u201cHaving seen the footage of the presentation so often I know what happened, but I don\u2019t have any distinct recollection of it. The Portuguese police didn\u2019t think it was safe for us to go back across the pitch so they decided to take us back to the dressing rooms around the outside of the stadium in a police car. But before they took us there it seemed as though every policeman on duty had their photo taken with the cup. Not with us, but with the cup.\u201d\n\nStevie Chalmers: \u201cCertainly it would have been nice if we\u2019d had a lap of honour but thousands of these people came from Glasgow and some of them left themselves skint for years. They would all want to celebrate at the same time as us \u2013 and with us. So although we didn\u2019t get a lap of honour, the fans at least got their money\u2019s worth when they got onto the park.\u201d\n\nErnie Wilson: \u201cI was on the park a good hour after the game, kissing the grass. I ran into the net where the goals were scored and I was swinging on the crossbar. If my family had seen me they would have got me locked up.\u201d\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cLater on that evening when we were sitting in the restaurant, when Billy came in with a box and gave us all our medals. It\u2019s probably the worst presentation of medals in the history of the European Cup.\u201d\n\nHOMEWARD BOUND\n\nBernie Boyle: \u201cWe took the coaches back into Lisbon. I think we had time for a couple of beers and then it was out to the airport. I think I was home at one o\u2019clock and in my bed. My wife often says I was home quicker from Lisbon than I\u2019d ever been from Aberdeen.\u201d\n\nErnie Wilson: \u201cWhen the busses left for the airport the locals were lined up on the streets clapping us at one or two in the morning \u2013 mothers, kids, grannies. Some of us hadn\u2019t slept for two days but our adrenaline kept us going. I threw my Celtic shirt into the crowd. We owed the locals of Lisbon a big thank you because they were terrific.\u201d\n\nJack Marshall: \u201cIt was different three years later when we got to the European Cup final again. I went to Milan to see Celtic play Feyenoord and that time locals didn\u2019t like us at all because we\u2019d beaten Inter in Lisbon.\u201d\n\nErnie Wilson: \u201cI\u2019ve read stories that some fans ended up staying in Lisbon and getting jobs. There were definitely lots of fans who lost their passports and there were delays. Hundreds of passports were on laid out on tables at the airport waiting for people to claim them.\u201d\n\nJackie Connor: \u201cI think some of the planes flew out with maybe a dozen people missing.\u201d\n\nErnie Wilson: \u201cAt the airport we heard a roar as the Celtic team arrived with their wives. Jock Stein made all the players come out and they were singing \u2018Hail, Hail\u2019 with the fans. One of the fans shouted to Tommy Gemmell \u2018How are you doing Tam?\u2019 and I remember him saying \u2018Top of the world\u2019.\u201d\n\nBernie Boyle: \u201cThe day I came home I dressed my car up with flags and took my brother and two sons to the airport to see the team come home. Thankfully a policeman who had a leaning for Celtic told me to go round to the back entrance as that was the way the team were coming out and I followed right behind them all the way through Glasgow and back to the ground. When we were just about to turn into Celtic Park a police sergeant on horseback came galloping after me, so I abandoned the car. A friend of mine behind the railings shouted \u2018Bernie, you made good time back\u2019. He thought I\u2019d driven all the way back from Lisbon to Celtic Park!\u201d\n\nJohn Clark: \u201cThe best thing that happened was when we came back to Celtic Park \u2013 that made up for not getting the cup presented the right way. The streets were lined with people all the way from the centre of Glasgow to Celtic Park. We were put on the back of a lorry and we went round the track three or four times, getting our lap of honour.\u201d\n\nBernie Boyle: \u201cWhen I got home the following day I went round to visit my dad. In his lapel he had a sprig of white heather with a green, white and gold ribbon \u2013 he was a very committed Celtic man, but that was the first and only time I saw him with colours on. He gave me a big hug and he said \u2018Were you on the pitch?\u2019. I wondered whether I should tell him because he was kind of strict, but I said, \u2018Yes, I was Dad\u2019. He said, \u2018I thought you would be, I was on it myself looking for you\u2019. I could not believe that my father had done such a thing, but that just shows you that everybody was just caught up in the euphoria of that occasion.\u201d\n\nErnie Wilson: \u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have but I had dug up a big bit of the pitch and brought it home in my bag. I took it in the pub the next day but everybody grabbed big chunks of this turf and I ended up with just a wee spot that wouldn\u2019t fit in a box of matches. My mum put it in a plant pot in the window and she said, \u2018It\u2019s always there if you need it\u2019.\u201d\n\nJackie Connor: \u201cAfter that game for the first time ever I sent a letter to Big Jock Stein and thanked him for everything he had done for Celtic.\u201d\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cWinning the European Cup was the making of the club. After that everyone knew about Celtic. We even beat Real Madrid two week later. They\u2019d won it the previous year and they kept saying they were the real champions, but we went a beat them 1-0 on their own patch in front of 135,000 people.\u201d\n\nBilly McNeill: \u201cIt was Di Stefano\u2019s testimonial. It was a fantastic evening and the game was very competitive. Bobby Lennox scored the goal for us \u2013 and afterwards there could be no doubt that we could be called true European Champions.\n\nBobby Lennox: \u201cThat just proved to Europe that we were the best team. We entered five tournaments that year and we won all five of them.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/1967/may/25/championsleague.sport", "page_content": "Celtic flags fly triumphantly in the evening shadows here today. At last, like the World Cup, the European Cup comes home to Britain. Celtic are the new champions and worthy ones at that, having beaten Inter Milan 2-1 in the final after a remarkable match; by sheer determination when all seemed stacked against them, when frustration and defeat stared them straight in the eye.\n\nThere is no individual hero. Every man gave his all. No other British club has ever reached the final, let alone won Europe's most coveted prize. And as the shadows lengthened just five minutes away from extra time Celtic scored the winning goal. It seemed the final minutes would never pass for their 7,000 supporters, who had travelled so far and so hopefully. It was like Wembley all over again after the Scottish victory against England. Jubilation was everywhere as the supporters cavorted around their heroes.\n\nBut hope had been slim for so long. Not for an hour could the despairing Scots break the defensive wall Inter built round their goal. Inter have done it so often, so successfully, it seemed Celtic, for all Johnstone's cunning and Murdoch's support of the forwards, had not the key to prise apart the tall Facchetti from his cohorts, Burgnich, Guarneri and Bedin. But the assistance of the backs and particularly the shooting of Gemmell from outside the wall was rewarded in the end.\n\nFor all the great expectation of high tension, no one could have expected it to erupt so sharply or suddenly. Within the first six minutes Celtic were a goal down to a penalty. It came as Craig fouled Cappellini and was scored by Mazzola, for whom this must have been an emotional experience for it was here his father played his last match before he died so tragically in the air crash afterwards. Inter, for all their leisurely approach, snapped into action near goal with surprising skill and speed and only seconds before the goal Cappellini sprinted down the wing and Mazzolla's low header glanced off Simpson's knees.\n\nFrom that disastrous goal, however, Celtic gained in strength. Back came Inter into the old familiar pattern of massed defence behind which stalked Sarti plucking the high shots out of the air. There was no way through for Celtic. There was no way over the wall either. It had to be from outside the wall in the hope of a chink being made that success would come. Celtic waited so long. Incident piled upon incident, thrill upon thrill. Auld hit the crossbar, a low left from Johnstone was smothered by Sarti, who in the next minute tipped a header from Johnstone over the crossbar.\n\nNine men were pulled back to stem Celtic. Inter were well content and determined to hold what they had. It demanded defence of the highest order against an attack as consistent and resolute as Celtic's. Sarti just managed to smother one free kick which Gemmell deflected off this wall of defence. Later, lobbing rather speculatively, Gemmell's shot his the bar as the evening sun glinted in Sarti's eyes. And all the while Inter had not threatened again. And when they needed to come from their defensive box they could not.\n\nGemmell claimed the goal which brought Celtic level after an hour, and what a beautifully taken goal it was, coming from the clever understanding of Murdoch and Craig. This time the groping fingers of Sarti could not touch Gemmell's fierce, first time shot. With the goal cam renewed hope for in spite of Inter's stubborn defence, Celtic were back with a real chance. It did not come until five minutes from time and then Chalmers was promptly submerged by his jubilant colleagues after he had scored the most crucial goal of his career. And so on to the rejoicing."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0045/", "page_content": "\u00a9 SCRAN\n\nOn Thursday 25 May 1967, Scottish Football reached a pinnacle of success in Europe which has yet to be surpassed in the modern era, when Glasgow Celtic Football Club, under the leadership of manager Jock Stein defeated Internacionale of Milan 2-1 at the Estadio Nacionale in Lisbon to win the European Cup.\n\nLess than 24 hours earlier, Kilmarnock FC exited the semi-finals of the Uefa Cup (known then as the Fair Cities Cup), when Leeds United defeated them 4-2 at Rugby Park, with both sides having played out a goalless encounter in the first leg at Elland Road on Wednesday 19 May.\n\nDespite the disappointment of failing to become the first Scottish side to reach the final of a major European trophy, Malky McDonald's Killie managed to defeat Royal Antwerp of Belgium 8-2 on aggregate and La Gantoise of Ghent 3-1 along the way, before Don Revie's men booked their ultimately doomed place in the finals against Dynamo Zagreb.\n\nSix days later, on Wednesday 31 May, Rangers failed to overcome Bayern Munich in the final of the European Cup Winners Cup in Nuremberg, with the Franz Roth notching up the only goal of a dull match during extra-time.\n\n1967 was indeed an exciting time for Scottish football, but it was Celtic who eventually lasted the distance in Europe, when an officially-recorded crowd of over 45,000 crammed into the Portuguese national stadium to witness the famous Glasgow side wrestle the greatest prize in club football from the preserve of Europe's Latin sides, for the first time in the history of the tournament.\n\nBefore kick-off, few neutrals believed Celtic were capable of overcoming the negative defensive tactics of Helenio Hererra's outfit, who had successfully dismissed such giants as CSKA Sofia, Real Madrid and Torpedo Moscow en route to the final. But Stein's side were galvanised by an overwhelming self-belief in their own invincibility, and their football was both exciting and attack-based, drawing from the great Hungarian sides of the 1960s and pioneering the concept of 'total football', many years in advance of the Dutch masters.\n\n\u00a9 SNSpix\n\nAccording to the Celtic players, Stein's instructions ahead of the game were simple: go out enjoy yourself; but his plan almost went off the rails in the opening moments when Jim Craig felled Cappellini and Mazolla netted the resulting penalty, sending Ronnie Simpson the wrong way with barely eight minutes on the clock and giving Milan a vital early lead.\n\nThe opener seemed nothing more than a minor diversion for the Glasgow side, as Stein pressed for his players to attack and lay siege to the Italian goalmouth. Milan reverted to their famous defensive pattern and successfully thwarted Celtic's every effort on goal, but not without the help of some miraculous saves from goalkeeper Sarti and a fair amount of good fortune from the woodwork.\n\nWhen half-time arrived, the scoreline remained 1-0 in favour of Inter, but Stein knew that Celtic were capable of scoring from any position on the pitch, and shortly after the break their much-needed equaliser arrived - from the boot of Celtic's full-back, Tommy Gemmell. On 65 minutes, the adventurous defender linked up with Jim Craig and Bobby Murdoch to send home an unstoppable shot and level the score. Almost an hour had passed since Mazolla had handed Inter the lead, but Celtic had finally found the inspiration they needed to take full control of the game and press on for victory."}, {"url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/what-became-of-celtic-s-lisbon-lions-1.3869157", "page_content": "Celtic became the first British team to win the European Cup on May 25th, 1967.\n\nJock Stein\u2019s \u2018Lisbon Lions\u2019 beat Inter Milan 2-1 at the Estadio Nacional in the Portuguese capital.\n\nHere we remember the trailblazing side which made history and takes a look at what became of the players, all of whom were born within a 30-mile radius of Glasgow.\n\nRonnie Simpson\n\nREAD MORE\n\nThe goalkeeper enjoyed one of the most spectacular Indian summers in football after joining Celtic in 1964 from Hibernian, who were then managed by Stein. Signed as understudy to John Fallon, he forced his way into the first team and made his Scotland debut aged 36 in the 3-2 Wembley win over world champions England. Six weeks later he was a European Cup winner. After hanging up his gloves in 1970, he had a spell as Hamilton boss and served as a local councillor in Edinburgh. Glasgow-born Simpson died of a heart attack in 2004.\n\nJim Craig\n\nThe right-back began the 1964-65 season playing for Glasgow University while studying to become a dentist. He ended it in the Celtic reserves and he soon made the Parkhead club\u2019s first team, becoming a regular fixture in time for Lisbon glory. Craig, who went to primary school in the shadow of Ibrox, later became a dentist and the 75-year-old is still a regular at Celtic Park, often helping with commentary duties for the club\u2019s TV channel as well as his own on-line blog.\n\nTommy Gemmell\n\nMotherwell-born Gemmell signed for Celtic on the same night as Jimmy Johnstone in October 1961 and the pair caught the same bus back to Lanarkshire. The attacking left-back scored the equaliser against Inter and also netted in the 1970 European Cup final defeat by Feyenoord before leaving the club for Nottingham Forest a year later. He played for and managed Dundee before running a hotel and then becoming a financial adviser, having a brief stint as Albion Rovers manager too. He remained a familiar figure at Parkhead, but died in March 2017 following a long illness.\n\nBilly McNeill\n\nAnother Lanarkshire-born defender, the centre-back went down in history in Lisbon as the first British player to lift the European Cup. The Lisbon Lions skipper spent 18 years at Celtic as a player \u2014 making a club-record 790 appearances \u2014 and had two spells as manager, where his greatest achievement was guiding the club to the double in their centenary season, 1987-88. Nicknamed Cesar after actor Cesar Romero, who played the getaway driver in the original Ocean's Eleven, because he was one of the few players to own a car in the early 1960s. McNeill also managed Aberdeen, Manchester City and Aston Villa and later worked in television. McNeill's family confirmed during 2017 that he had been diagnosed with dementia. The former Celtic captain died in April 2019, aged 79.\n\nJohn Clark\n\nNicknamed \u2018The Brush\u2019, Clark was the sweeper behind McNeill \u2014 both men were born in Bellshill. He first joined Celtic in 1958 and the 78-year-old has continued his close relationship with the club, having worked at the Lennoxtown training ground and also on matchdays as the first-team kit man. Clark managed Cowdenbeath, Stranraer and Clyde before returning to Celtic, where he was a regular in the dugout until very recently.\n\nBobby Murdoch\n\nDescribed by Stein as \u201cjust about the best player I had as manager\u201d, Murdoch\u2019s passing ability was a key feature of the Lions and his nickname \u2018Chopper\u2019 also signified his hard side. He spent 11 seasons at Celtic Park before playing for and later managing Middlesbrough. Murdoch, who was from Rutherglen just down the road from Parkhead, later had a spell as a publican. Murdoch was the first of the Lions to die after suffering a stroke at the age of 56 in 2001.\n\nBertie Auld\n\nThe midfielder epitomised the fearless approach of the Lions, starting a rendition of \u2018The Celtic Song\u2019 in the tunnel as the Inter team watched in bemusement. The former Birmingham player\u2019s intervention helped settle the nerves of his team-mates and more than likely unsettled his opponents. The Glaswegian later managed the likes of Partick Thistle and Hibernian and remains a much-loved figure among his fellow Celtic supporters. Often appearing as a guest on Celtic TV, Auld was inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame in November 2009. Auld, now 81, showed he had not lost his singing prowess at the 2016/2017 Betfred Cup final with a table-topping, glass-thumping performance inside a Hampden executive box.\n\nJimmy Johnstone\n\nThe most naturally-gifted of the Lions, 'Jinky' was voted the club's greatest player by fans in 2002. The winger mesmerised many a top team other than Inter and weeks after the Lisbon triumph he stole the show in Alfredo Di Stefano's testimonial as Celtic defeated Real Madrid in the Bernabeu. The 23-times capped Scotland international struggled to deal with his Celtic exit in 1975 and battled with alcohol problems. He returned to Celtic in a coaching role in the 1980s after finishing his playing career with spells with the likes of San Jose Earthquakes, Sheffield United, Shelbourne and Dundee. Johnstone was diagnosed with motor neurone disease, campaigning to raise money and awareness to fight the condition, and lost his battle in 2006. He is immortalised in a statue outside Celtic Park.\n\nBobby Lennox\n\nHugely popular with the Celtic fans, Lennox spent 19 seasons playing for the club, minus a few months in the United States of America. He was the last Lion to retire as a player, in 1980, and stayed on in a coaching capacity at Celtic Park. He won 25 major trophies during his time with the club \u2014 almost a quarter of Celtic\u2019s total \u2014 and his 277-goal haul is second only to Jimmy McGrory in the team\u2019s scoring charts. Hailing from Saltcoats in Ayrshire, Lennox was the only one of the Lisbon Lions to have been born more than 10 miles from Parkhead. The 75-year-old is still a familiar face at the ground, often working as a matchday host and recently had a statue unveiled in his honour in his home town.\n\nStevie Chalmers\n\nThe man who scored the winner, Chalmers was told he had three weeks to live as a 20-year-old when he contracted tuberculosis meningitis, but was one of the first Scots to survive the illness after being given pioneering treatment. Four years later in 1959 he joined Celtic from Ashfield Juniors and had to wait six years for his first trophy, but then enjoyed unprecedented success. Glasgow-born Chalmers scored three goals in five Scotland appearances and netted 231 times in 12 years for Celtic. He later played for Morton and Partick Thistle before running an off-licence business and then becoming a sales agent for the Celtic Pools. Now 83, Chalmers, whose son Paul played for Celtic, suffered a heart attack in the late 1980s. His family revealed Chalmers was unable to attend the Lisbon Lions 50th anniversary events due to ill health, having been diagnosed with dementia.\n\nWillie Wallace\n\nThe prolific goalscorer joined Celtic six months before Lisbon in a club record transfer from Hearts. With Joe McBride suffering a bad knee injury weeks later, \u2018Wispy\u2019 formed a partnership with Chalmers which carried Celtic to a clean sweep of trophies. Wallace, from Kirkintilloch, netted 134 goals in five years for Celtic before moving to Crystal Palace in 1972. He rounded off his career in Australia, where he still lives, but the 78-year-old has made the long journey back from Down Under to attend some games at at Celtic Park."}, {"url": "https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/celtic-2-1-inter-european-cup-final-report-lisbon-1967-1448956", "page_content": "In old Lisbon tonight Celtic annihilated Inter Milan by a single goal. They were hailed uproariously as new champions of Europe and not since Real Madrid in 1960 has there been more decisive and satisfying winners of the European Champions Cup. They were great as they became the first club ever to win their National Championship, their National Cup and the European Cup.\n\nThe Scotsman's John Rafferty and journalist colleague Hugh McIlvanney lead Billy McNeill through the crowds to the trophy presentation.\n\nIf annihilated needs explaining it needs explained that Celtic \u2013 after losing a goal to a penalty kick and being pestered and frustrated by an unsatisfactory referee \u2013 destroyed the theorising of the alleged magician, Herrera, with refreshing attacking football. Had they won by four goals it would have been a fair reflection of the play.\n\nPerhaps, however, it was appropriate that they should win by a single goal for that is how this defensive-minded Inter planned to win. The biter was bitten.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nJock Stein said before the game that Celtic would win with pace. Tonight he can add to that adventure, ball skill, courage and all the football phrases beloved by the spectators.\n\nHe has claimed, too, that Celtic could raise their game on the big occasion. That they did tonight with two glorious goals far above anything that Inter could have imagined. It was perhaps their finest game of the season. Stein did not play three forwards in the modern manner but instead there was not a player, apart from Simpson, who was not at one time or another committed to attack.\n\nIn modern football this was revolutionary.\n\nIn the second half Tommy Gemmell, a full back, was so committed to racing up the wing that he was on the point of collapse and sought refreshment from the trainer. Indeed, Stein\u2019s answer to the massive defending of the Italians was to play the ball back to a defender running on to it.\n\nThe mightiest shooting came from Murdoch and Gemmell, but they were in the limelight doing the finishing and were no more important than Chalmers, Lennox and Wallace, who kept defenders committed and moving with them and making spaces for the big guns coming from the rear.\n\nIf football is a game like draughts then Stein out-thought and out-witted Herrera. If it is a game to entertain the masses then Celtic are the worthiest champions and the greatest thing to hit European football since the decline of Real Madrid.\n\nAll who sat in this great national stadium in the burning sunshine were happy that once more attacking football had won. Those of us who were Scots and indeed British were wildly emotional and ranged from those who had hitch-hiked across 1700 miles of Europe to those of us who thought we were blas\u00e9 and had seen it all. We do not like to see a football field invaded, but when these Celtic supporters broke in at the end and took command of the field and knelt and kissed the turf, and some \u201chowked\u201d out souvenir clods, we could understand.\n\nWe watched proudly as Celtic struggled to their dressing-room, Murdoch crying unashamedly, Lennox was without a boot but he was not caring, Billy McNeill strode majestically as the winning captain should, and then there was the light relief when he had to be taken from the dressingroom when it was discovered that in the hectic enthusiasm they had forgotten the presentation of the Cup. He was on the point of collapse but finally he struggled up to get his hands on it.\n\nThe atmosphere was weird and wonderful and wildly Celtic from the moment Jock Stein took his players onto the field to test the turf. He came round to the dressingroom obviously deeply moved to see the crowd out there and he said: \u201cThey are ALL Celtic supporters, it is inspiring.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nIndeed they all seemed to be Celtic supporters and all around the great bowl green flags were waving and Celtic chants breached the air and hysteria raged when the teams came out of the hole in the ground that led from the dressing rooms.\n\nThe first Celtic burst looked promising. Johnstone skipped away and beat Burgnich three different ways. This early the Celtic approach was clear. Stein had turned Johnstone loose to prod all around the forward line. Herrera sent the tough little Burgnich to mark him.\n\nThere was a touch of luck for Celtic in the third minute. Mazzola headed Cappellini\u2019s cross and the ball hit Simpson on the shins. Then Johnstone was near with a header before, in the seventh minute, calamity befell Celtic.\n\nCraig tackled Cappellini in the penalty box and swept the legs from under him. Immediately the referee signalled a penalty kick. Mazzola took it and his low shot was unsavable.\n\nThen there was an exciting spell of exhilarating Celtic attacking in which three chances were made and Inter were so rattled that Herrera was on the field beseeching Italian action and Sarti, the goalkeeper, was reprimanded by the referee for wasting time.\n\nAuld glided through the defence and his well-hit shot looked a goal but the ball smacked against the crossbar.\n\nWallace had a shot brilliantly saved and then on his knees he headed just wide. In the attacking skills, Celtic, as their first half progressed, completely overwhelmed Inter. Their play out of defence was masterly, the build up of Murdoch and Auld devastating in the way their long passes sent men racing up the flanks.\n\nInter were crushed back on Sarti by the massive attacking, and the ball work of Johnstone and Auld seemed to surprise the defenders, who were obviously not used to such adventurous football. Celtic had often been less in command and had run up a string of goals.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nIn contrast to this Celtic approach, Inter looked miserably dull. Their man-to-man marking was shattered by the foraging of Craig and Gemmell, but, as Celtic pressed on, the goal refused to come.\n\nThere was another great try by Auld that was worth a goal, a drive from volley by Gemmell that would have been a goal any other day, but Sarti, diving to his left, saved instinctively.\n\nAs half-time approached, the game took on a farcical appearance, with standing room limited in the penalty area among the crush of bodies while Herrera screamed from the sideline. It was a relief when Mazzola had a shot at Celtic\u2019s goal \u2013 from 30 yards.\n\nCeltic might have had a penalty kick at the start of the second half but instead got an indirect free-kick inside the box and then, in the scramble from the kick, the ball seemed over the line but this unsatisfactory referee waved play on.\n\nGemmell was booked for a foul. Then, in the 60th minute, he scored one of the greatest goals ever seen on any football field. Craig\u2019s pass rolled in front of him and he put everything into the shot \u2013 the most powerful in Britain. And all the way it was a goal, a memorable one and not before time.\n\nWhat a beating Inter took then. If they had not been so dull one could have been sorry for the once great team taking such humiliation. There was a spell in the second half when one wondered how their goal held.\n\nShots rained on it. Gemmell struck the crossbar and a shot from Murdoch struck Picchi on the face. There was a blatant penalty kick denied when Wallace\u2019s leg was felled near goal and then at last with five minutes to go Celtic had won it.\n\nMurdoch drove the ball hard across the goal and Chalmers slid on to it and pushed it into the net. Justice had indeed been done and Inter knew it. There was no fight back as Celtic played out time.\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n\nAdvertisement Hide Ad"}, {"url": "https://theconversation.com/lisbon-lions-why-celtics-historic-1967-european-cup-win-was-a-defining-moment-for-the-irish-diaspora-in-scotland-131708", "page_content": "Like anywhere else in the world on St Patrick\u2019s Day, where there are people of Irish Catholic descent there will be celebrations of national pride \u2013 and the same is true of Scotland. But for many people of Irish descent in Scotland, there is one particular cause for celebration that eclipses even St Patrick\u2019s Day. It\u2019s the story of how an iconic \u2013 and unexpected \u2013 win for a Glasgow football team in Portugal 50 years ago raised the esteem and restored the pride of a marginalised community.\n\nOn May 25 1967, Celtic FC came from behind to defeat Italian side Inter Milan 2-1, becoming the first club from outside of Spain, Portugal or Italy to win the European Cup (now called the UEFA Champions League). Widely recognised as the most prestigious club soccer trophy in the world, only 22 clubs have managed to win it since its inception in 1956.\n\nBut only through closer inspection can this victory\u2019s more profound religious, ethnic and cultural meaning for Catholics of Irish descent in Scotland be properly understood. Celtic\u2019s win has been noted, reported and highlighted regularly through the years, particularly in 2017 during the club\u2019s recent 50th anniversary celebration.\n\nThough other teams in Britain have won the trophy since, the significance of Celtic\u2019s win went beyond the successes normally associated with such sporting achievement. In our research, we tasked ourselves to find out how this footballing triumph affected Catholics of Irish descent and contributed to the confidence and pride experienced within that community.\n\nCeltic roots\n\nCeltic\u2019s origins are rooted in the cataclysmic Great Starvation (An Gorta Mor in Irish) in Ireland between 1845 and 1849, when millions of people died or were forced to flee the island. The immediate trigger was the failure of the main dietary staple of the potato \u2013 but the history of centuries-long British colonisation of Ireland, and the wars and conflict that followed, provides the greater cultural, economic and political context for this human disaster.\n\nFor Scotland, a predominantly Protestant country, one of the main consequences was the influx of Irish Catholic refugees. In 1888, out of the newly forming Irish communities in west-central Scotland, a football club was established in Glasgow by a member of a Catholic religious order called Brother Walfrid. The aim of the club was to raise funds to educate and feed the mainly Catholic Irish poor in and around the east end of the city.\n\nCeltic FC has been one of this Irish immigrant community\u2019s most revered totems since the late 19th century. Fifty years after the Lisbon Lions\u2019 win, the enormity of the achievement was recalled by Scottish historian Tom Devine, who encapsulated its significance, saying:\n\nA key factor in the long story of the emancipation of the Catholic Irish in this country \u2026 in terms of signal events, the Lisbon Lions victory probably stands alongside the visit of Pope John Paul II in 1982.\n\nWhile not specifically a Catholic football club, without Catholicism, Irish Catholic immigration and a revival of the Catholic church in post-Reformation Scotland, there would be no Celtic. This fact is fundamental to understanding the club\u2019s origins, identity, appeal and resilience. Former Celtic player and manager Tommy Burns once commented that Celtic players had to remember that:\n\nIt\u2019s more than just a football team they\u2019re playing for. They\u2019re playing for a cause and a people.\n\nSigificance of \u201867\n\nFor Celtic and its supporters, 1967 has become a moment when the underdogs of Scottish society became the most successful underdogs on the football field. To understand the impact and legacy of Celtic\u2019s win, our study examined several commemorative accounts of the victory, and conducted a focus group with fans that travelled to Lisbon in 1967.\n\nIn a commemorative book, one supporter wrote:\n\nIt was the best week of my short life. I made my confession on the 19th, my holy communion on the 20th, my confirmation on the 24th and Celtic won the European Cup on the 25th. I was the centre of the world that week. When Tommy Gemmell scored the equaliser my two big brothers held me up and waved me about. Could life get any better?\n\nOne supporter who attended the match said that in Scotland, \u201cWe were no longer afraid to stand up and be counted\u201d. Another described how the Celtic players, \u201cwere our heroes in a way that Muhammad Ali might be for black guys in America\u201d. In 2018, academic Paddy Hoey added his own gloss:\n\nTheir achievement was a powerful beacon \u2026 for an immigrant community that had been forced to deal with sectarianism and political marginalisation in Scotland.\n\nAlthough people from non-Catholic and non-Irish backgrounds have always supported Celtic and other football fans celebrated the win too, this European Cup victory must be examined in relation to the history of the multi-generational Irish community in Scotland. On what other occasion was there ever \u2013 among those of Irish descent in Scotland at least \u2013 such enthusiasm and sense of community as when Celtic triumphed as European champions? Its 1967 victory was an iconic moment in the social and cultural history of Scotland and its Irish Catholic diaspora. This is a success memorialised in documentaries and through song, story, theatre, books, vintage football jerseys and casual wear.\n\nCelebrated on a grand scale during its 25 and 50 year anniversaries, the story of the \u201cLisbon Lions\u201d represents an indelible link for generations of Celtic supporters. It connects to Celtic\u2019s roots and ethos; to the Great Irish Starvation; to the immigrant Catholic Irish experience in Scotland; and to the worldwide Irish diaspora.\n\nThe European Cup win of 1967 is a monument to the survival, experience and success of a resilient community that has frequently viewed aspects of its Irishness and Catholicism in Scotland as ignored, unrecognised and discriminated against. Celtic\u2019s win has become a central component of group memory, linking the past, present and future, offering confidence and hope to a marginalised community in Scotland. It also demonstrates the symbolic power of sport to rise above events on the field of play and represent something more resonant and enduring."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/52520874", "page_content": "Davie Hay in action against Feyenoord in the 1970 European Cup final\n\nBilly McNeill, captain of the Lisbon Lions, buries his face in the turf. Midfielder Bertie Auld is bowled over with his hands on his knees. Goalkeeper Evan Williams struggles to his feet. He has just been delicately lobbed by Feyenoord's Swedish striker Ove Kindvall. Three minutes of extra-time remain.\n\nCeltic are 2-1 down. Their grip on the club's second European Cup loosens further with every passing second.\n\nThe pandemonium spills over on to the pitch, photographers encroach the penalty area and surround Kindvall. Celtic's players pick themselves up and desperately search their minds for ideas of how to rescue a replay. None were forthcoming.\n\nIn a matter of a few seconds, referee Concetto lo Bello blows the final whistle, confirming Feyenoord as European Cup winners for the first time - and Celtic as European Cup final losers for the first time. Delirium for the Dutch and dismay for the Scots.\n\nHere, BBC Scotland hears about games being decided by a coin toss, career lows and final complacency.\n\n'My greatest disappointment in football'\n\nWhile the heat of Lisbon is still felt upon the steep slopes of Celtic Park even in the depths of winter every 67th minute, there is little rejoicing about the near miss just three years later. That despite the almost herculean feat of getting to two European finals in such a short period.\n\n\"The greatest disappointment of my footballing career,\" admits Davie Hay, Celtic's right-back on that evening in Milan.\n\n\"When you look at the pictures of us going up to get our medals, there is a total look of despair and despondency.\n\n\"We hadnae heard of Feyenoord. They were something like 44-1 rank outsiders.\"\n\nThere is a beautiful irony about Hay's comments. Three years prior, Helenio Herrera's glamorous Inter Milan side would have felt similar about Celtic's team of locals before they succumbed to one of football's greatest upsets. Celtic became the first British team to win the European Cup in 1967 by beating them 2-1 in Lisbon.\n\nThis time, there was no such fairytale ending. Tommy Gemmell's opener from a free-kick - his second European Cup final goal - after half-an-hour gave Jock Stein's side a lead that lasted just two minutes. Rinus Israel's equaliser quickly brought them back down to earth.\n\nTo go from the underdogs to the favourites must have come as a bit of a culture shock for Stein's men. In the years that followed the triumph of '67, Celtic's domestic form had been impeccable, winning successive league titles and cups. They were used to being domestic powerhouses, but their European form had been lacking.\n\nIn 1968, they exited the European Cup in the first round following a 3-1 aggregate defeat by Dynamo Kiev, and a narrow 1-0 loss to AC Milan dumped them out at the quarter-final stage in 1969.\n\n'The toss of a coin was farcical'\n\nThe club were in a transitional stage. Williams had taken the place of Ronnie Simpson in goals, Hay had moved into Jim Craig's spot at right-back, George Connelly was already making his mark on the first team, while Kenny Dalglish, Danny McGrain and Lou Macari were all flying through the ranks.\n\nThere was hope of another European challenge in 1970, and things got off to a good start with an aggregate victory over Basel, but Celtic faced a great scare in the second round. After beating Benfica 3-0 at Celtic Park, it should have been a comfortable passage through to the quarter-final, but Stein's men got a taste of their own medicine, losing 3-0 at Estadio da Luz, as Benfica equalised with the last kick of the 90 minutes.\n\nWith the scores level after extra-time, how do you decide who goes through to the quarter-finals? Penalties? A replay? No. The referee took the two captains, Celtic's McNeill and Mario Coluna of Benfica, into his dressing room for a coin toss.\n\nMcNeill called heads, it landed on heads. He was then informed that round was merely for the right to toss the actual coin. He stuck to his guns. Heads again. He won, Celtic won, and were through to the quarter-finals.\n\n\"It was midnight before the game was decided,\" the late McNeill told BBC Scotland in 2006. \"The toss of a coin was a farcical way of deciding a tie - irrespective of who won.\n\n\"It was done in the referee's room. It was just myself, Sean Fallon and Big Jock. The room was a bit away from the dressing rooms.\n\n\"After it was decided, it was chaos. I didn't speak to any of the Benfica players afterwards, but I know they were angry.\"\n\nFeyenoord doing homework & underestimating the Dutch\n\nIn the quarter-finals, Celtic beat Fiorentina 3-1 to set-up an all-British semi-final. Though they beat Don Revie's Leeds United, the consensus seems to be that Celtic became complacent for the final as a result.\n\nDid they think the hard work had already been done?\n\n\"Everybody in Britain thought that,\" says former Celtic midfielder Auld. \"Leeds had a very good team and they were doing extremely well down in England.

Leagues, cups, the lot. It was my privilege to play with and get to know those Celtic boys, to say I was a player under Jock Stein. I'm a lucky man to have those memories.\"\n\n\"Evan is right,\" says Auld. \"Although we lost, it is such a highlight - Celtic in a second European Cup final.
