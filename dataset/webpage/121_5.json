Football family: His father, John Gutekunst, was head coach at the University of Minnesota from 1985-91, compiling a 29-37-2 record. Brian Gutekunst, 44, was born July 19, 1973 in Raleigh, N.C., where his father was starting his coaching career as an assistant at Duke.\n\n2. Family man: Gutekunst and his wife, Jen, have three daughters (Marley, 12; Joie, 11; and Kacey, 6) and one son (Michael, 8).\n\n3. Wisconsin roots: Gutekunst played two seasons of college football at Wisconsin-La Crosse. A shoulder injury ended his career, but he remained involved in the game. Gutekunst served as an assistant coach with the team in 1995-96; he was a linebackers coach during the team\u2019s 1995 Division III national-championship season.\n\n4. On the coaching track: Gutekunst\u2019s first NFL experience came in the summer of 1995. During training camp, he assisted the New Orleans Saints\u2019 coaching staff with the offensive line. It deviated from his father, who spent his career coaching defense.\n\n5. Switch to scouting side: In 1998, Gutekunst made a decision that would define the rest of his career. His first full-time employment in scouting came that year as a scouting assistant with the Kansas City Chiefs. Gutekunst\u2019s time with the Chiefs overlapped with the end of Packers vice president of football administration and player finance Russ Ball\u2019s time in Kansas City. Ball was an administrative assistant to then-Chiefs coach Marty Schottenheimer. It was also the first time Gutekunst worked in the same organization as Packers coach Mike McCarthy, the Chiefs' quarterbacks coach in 1998.\n\n6. Joining the Packers: Gutekunst first worked with the Packers' scouting department as an intern in 1997. After one year with the Chiefs, Gutekunst returned to the Packers when general manager Ron Wolf hired him as a college scout Dec. 30, 1998. Gutekunst primarily scouted the East Coast in his first two years before transitioning to the Southeast, a plum job because of the fertile Southeastern Conference.\n\n7. Impressive pedigree: As a Wolf hire, Gutekunst hails from a long line that has produced several successful NFL talent evaluators. The Wolf tree includes five men who worked under him in Green Bay and went on to become general managers: Thompson (assistant director of pro personnel 1992, director of pro personnel 1993-97, director of player personnel 1997-99), Seattle Seahawks general manager John Schneider (intern 1992, pro personnel assistant 1993-96), Cleveland Browns general manager John Dorsey (scout 1991-96, director of college scouting 1997-98), Oakland Raiders general manager Reggie McKenzie (pro personnel assistant 1994-96, director of pro personnel 1997-Wolf\u2019s retirement in 2001) and Scot McCloughan (regional scout 1994-99). Gutekunst started late in Wolf\u2019s tenure, and most of his time with the Packers has come working under Thompson, but he would be the sixth from the Wolf line to become a general manager.\n\n8. The corporate ladder: After 13 years as a college scout, Gutekunst was promoted to director of college scouting in 2012. Three years later, on March 21, 2016, he was promoted to director of player personnel. In that role, Gutekunst was one of Thompson\u2019s top lieutenants. He has been involved in most player acquisition decisions.\n\n9. Not his first interview: When Gutekunst interviewed with Packers President/CEO Mark Murphy for the GM vacancy, he had plenty of experience with the process. In the past year, Gutekunst interviewed for GM jobs with the Buffalo Bills and San Francisco 49ers. He was thought to be on the short list of candidates in San Francisco before removing himself from consideration, a sign that he was not going to get the job. The 49ers ultimately hired John Lynch, while the Bills hired Brandon Beane.\n\n10. In demand: If the Packers hadn't hired him, Gutekunst still could have gained a GM job this offseason. While there are fewer openings than a year ago, the Houston Texans were set to interview him for their opening Sunday."}], "Brian Petrovek was named the team's assistant general manager in 1989.": [{"url": "https://www.recordnet.com/story/sports/pro/2021/06/16/ahl-hockey-stockton-heat-name-new-president-ahead-2021-22-season/7718325002/", "page_content": "When Jamie Cochrane and his family move to Stockton from Calgary in July, one of his first goals is to start building relationships with charities and understanding key issues in the community to make a positive difference.\n\nThe Stockton Heat announced that Cochrane, who has overseen team business operations since February 2020, was named the new team president. And his vision for the team is one that amends its relationship with the city and embraces its Stockton locale.\n\n\"I think in the past we have done a decent job in selling hockey, but we haven't done a great job of connecting with the community and becoming a real partner and leader in the community,\" Cochrane said via phone call Wednesday afternoon. \"To connect people together and to connect with key business partners, key nonprofits, charities. I want this to be a place where everyone comes together at the same place and make the Stockton Heat actually representative of the Stockton community and not just a place to watch a hockey game.\u201d\n\nCochrane takes over the position from Brian Petrovek, who was let go in early 2020. Cochrane had overseen operations from Calgary, home the Heat's parent NHL team Calgary Flames, since then, according to a team spokesperson.\n\nICYMI:Stockton Heat will return to Stockton for upcoming season, AHL says\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to begin this new role in Stockton,\u201d Cochrane said in a news release. \u201cIn my time working with the Heat I\u2019ve developed a great appreciation for the team\u2019s passionate fan base, the City of Stockton\u2019s vibrant community, and the opportunity for accelerated growth. I look forward to deepening the connection between the team and Stockton and the surrounding communities, starting with a return to play in front of our fans back on home ice at the Stockton Arena later this year.\u201d\n\nCochrane takes over as the team returns to San Joaquin County after one season in Canada. The Heat relocated to Calgary, Alberta, and become part of a Canadian Division for the 2020-21 season due to cross-border travel complications caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The franchise played its home games at the Scotiabank Saddledome, the home ice of its NHL parent club, the Calgary Flames.\n\nIn January, Heat general manager Brad Pascall said the decision to play the season out of town was \u201ccompletely separate\u201d from negotiations over a new lease at Stockton Arena. The Heat\u2019s original five-year lease to play at Stockton Arena officially ended after the 2019-20 season, but the team and city agreed to a one-season extension for 2020-21.\n\nCochrane recognized the optics of moving to Canada without a long-term agreement with the city wasn't great. But he hopes the team's return to California can be the start of a new chapter, where the Heat are fully immersed into the future of Stockton.\n\n\"It was a tough situation and I know it hurt people in the Stockton community,\" Cochrane said. \"I wish we didn't have to go through that. We really want to make things work in Stockton. We always have and I think today is going to be the start of a new story here.\"\n\nThe 2021-22 Heat schedule, which will be 68 games within the Pacific division, has not yet been announced. That number will increase to 72 games in the 2022-23 season. And Cochrane has every intention for the Heat to play that season, and many beyond, in Stockton Arena.\n\n\"I am coming in here with two feet as well,\" he said. \"I want to make this work as much as anyone.\"\n\nRecord reporter Justin Frommer covers prep and college sports.

Bullard remained the majority owner until this winter, when Ron Cain increased his stake in the team and, shortly thereafter, took over CEO duties from Petrovek, who remained president of business development.\n\nChurch said he believes Petrovek retains his ownership stake. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not an owner,\u201d Church said, \u201cso I don\u2019t know for sure.\u201d\n\nCalls to Petrovek, Cain and Bullard were not returned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in a prepared statement, Petrovek said, \u201cMy decision allows Ron to steer the ship on his own course and begin a new journey for the brand and our fans and sponsors as the team prepares for the 2014-15 season.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Cain thanked Petrovek for his service.\n\n\u201cBrian is at the top of his game,\u201d Cain said. \u201cOur loss will be another\u2019s gain.\u201d\n\nCain lauded Petrovek\u2019s success in attracting the AHL all-star game to Portland in 2003 and 2010 and his involvement in civic and charitable organizations. Petrovek has served on the boards of Maine Medical Center, the United Way of Greater Portland and Portland\u2019s Downtown District.\n\nPetrovek was also the face and voice of the team\u2019s difficult and extended lease negotiations with trustees of the Cumberland County Civic Center in 2003, 2010 and 2013. \u201cWe\u2019ll give it three more years,\u201d he said after grudgingly signing a 2003 agreement. \u201cWe will not play in the building three years from now unless it has been renovated or the economic terms are different.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Petrovek flirted with moving the franchise to Albany, N.Y., before agreeing to a two-year extension. After voters approved a $33 million bond in 2011 to renovate the civic center, its trustees reached an agreement with the Pirates on a one-year lease with an eye toward a longer-term deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch a deal, which seemed to be imminent in April 2013, fell apart in August. In September, the team filed a lawsuit and then announced that its entire 38-game home schedule would be played at the Androscoggin Bank Colisee in Lewiston.\n\n\u201cWith any sports team, there\u2019s a certain amount of friction around the guy who\u2019s the face of the organization,\u201d said Chris Hall, CEO of the Portland Regional Chamber of Commerce. \u201cCertainly, the last year and a half has been difficult, but people should reflect on all the good years and the contributions. The city of Portland is well known as a great minor-league sports town. Well, one of the reasons is because of people like Brian Petrovek.\u201d\n\nThe first few months in Lewiston included three sellouts and an average attendance of more than 2,600 fans. The Pirates won a franchise-low 10 \u201chome\u201d games. They ended the season with a 10-game losing streak and an average attendance of 2,185 \u2013 the only one of 30 AHL franchises below 3,000.\n\nA new five-year lease with the civic center was announced in February, after Cain became majority owner and the Pirates dropped their lawsuit against the county-owned facility.\n\n\u201cRon, Lyman and I started talking more definitively about the opportunity and need for change as the ink dried on a new long-term lease with the civic center and the completion of the renovation project,\u201d Petrovek said in his statement.\n\nNeal Pratt, chairman of the civic center\u2019s board of trustees, said he and Petrovek often disagreed, but their relations were never disagreeable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBrian was always a zealous advocate for the team and a tireless promoter of the Pirates brand,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cHe tried to do what was best for his team and his business and I respect that and wish him well.\u201d\n\nPratt said the list of Petrovek\u2019s charitable efforts is impressive.\n\n\u201cHe has done a lot of volunteer work for the community,\u201d Pratt said, \u201cand I think he should be recognized for that.\u201d\n\nIn March 2013, Petrovek pleaded guilty to operating under the influence as part of a deal to avoid jail time after he crashed his Jeep Wrangler into the concrete barrier on Spring Street in Portland. His blood-alcohol content was measured at three times the legal limit for driving.\n\n\u201cWhat his legacy will be, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Church. \u201cMy hope is that people look at the big picture and recognize all the good that has come with his leadership of the organization.\u201d\n\nIn another, unrelated change, the Pirates lost their general manager Monday when Brad Treliving, former assistant GM of their parent NHL club, the Phoenix Coyotes, was hired as GM of the NHL\u2019s Calgary Flames.\n\nGlenn Jordan can be contacted at 791-6425 or at:\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: GlennJordanPPH"}], "Brian Petrovek was named the general manager of the Providence Bruins in 1993.": [{"url": "https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/264128/brian-petrovek", "page_content": "Edit Mode\n\nGo Premium to enter Edit Mode\n\nTake control of your EliteProspects profile!

Bullard remained the majority owner until this winter, when Ron Cain increased his stake in the team and, shortly thereafter, took over CEO duties from Petrovek, who remained president of business development.\n\nChurch said he believes Petrovek retains his ownership stake. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not an owner,\u201d Church said, \u201cso I don\u2019t know for sure.\u201d\n\nCalls to Petrovek, Cain and Bullard were not returned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in a prepared statement, Petrovek said, \u201cMy decision allows Ron to steer the ship on his own course and begin a new journey for the brand and our fans and sponsors as the team prepares for the 2014-15 season.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Cain thanked Petrovek for his service.\n\n\u201cBrian is at the top of his game,\u201d Cain said. \u201cOur loss will be another\u2019s gain.\u201d\n\nCain lauded Petrovek\u2019s success in attracting the AHL all-star game to Portland in 2003 and 2010 and his involvement in civic and charitable organizations. Petrovek has served on the boards of Maine Medical Center, the United Way of Greater Portland and Portland\u2019s Downtown District.\n\nPetrovek was also the face and voice of the team\u2019s difficult and extended lease negotiations with trustees of the Cumberland County Civic Center in 2003, 2010 and 2013. \u201cWe\u2019ll give it three more years,\u201d he said after grudgingly signing a 2003 agreement. \u201cWe will not play in the building three years from now unless it has been renovated or the economic terms are different.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Petrovek flirted with moving the franchise to Albany, N.Y., before agreeing to a two-year extension. After voters approved a $33 million bond in 2011 to renovate the civic center, its trustees reached an agreement with the Pirates on a one-year lease with an eye toward a longer-term deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch a deal, which seemed to be imminent in April 2013, fell apart in August. In September, the team filed a lawsuit and then announced that its entire 38-game home schedule would be played at the Androscoggin Bank Colisee in Lewiston.\n\n\u201cWith any sports team, there\u2019s a certain amount of friction around the guy who\u2019s the face of the organization,\u201d said Chris Hall, CEO of the Portland Regional Chamber of Commerce. \u201cCertainly, the last year and a half has been difficult, but people should reflect on all the good years and the contributions. The city of Portland is well known as a great minor-league sports town. Well, one of the reasons is because of people like Brian Petrovek.\u201d\n\nThe first few months in Lewiston included three sellouts and an average attendance of more than 2,600 fans. The Pirates won a franchise-low 10 \u201chome\u201d games. They ended the season with a 10-game losing streak and an average attendance of 2,185 \u2013 the only one of 30 AHL franchises below 3,000.\n\nA new five-year lease with the civic center was announced in February, after Cain became majority owner and the Pirates dropped their lawsuit against the county-owned facility.\n\n\u201cRon, Lyman and I started talking more definitively about the opportunity and need for change as the ink dried on a new long-term lease with the civic center and the completion of the renovation project,\u201d Petrovek said in his statement.\n\nNeal Pratt, chairman of the civic center\u2019s board of trustees, said he and Petrovek often disagreed, but their relations were never disagreeable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBrian was always a zealous advocate for the team and a tireless promoter of the Pirates brand,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cHe tried to do what was best for his team and his business and I respect that and wish him well.\u201d\n\nPratt said the list of Petrovek\u2019s charitable efforts is impressive.\n\n\u201cHe has done a lot of volunteer work for the community,\u201d Pratt said, \u201cand I think he should be recognized for that.\u201d\n\nIn March 2013, Petrovek pleaded guilty to operating under the influence as part of a deal to avoid jail time after he crashed his Jeep Wrangler into the concrete barrier on Spring Street in Portland. His blood-alcohol content was measured at three times the legal limit for driving.\n\n\u201cWhat his legacy will be, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Church. \u201cMy hope is that people look at the big picture and recognize all the good that has come with his leadership of the organization.\u201d\n\nIn another, unrelated change, the Pirates lost their general manager Monday when Brad Treliving, former assistant GM of their parent NHL club, the Phoenix Coyotes, was hired as GM of the NHL\u2019s Calgary Flames.\n\nGlenn Jordan can be contacted at 791-6425 or at:\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: GlennJordanPPH"}]}
