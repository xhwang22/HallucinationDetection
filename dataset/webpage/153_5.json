I had doubts in the backstroke, but I pushed through the pain and just looked to bring it home.\"\n\nBovell's leadoff butterfly stroke was a 26.22, which put him in sixth at the first turn. He then turned over to clock a 29.94 in the backstroke, which moved him into third behind eventual gold-medalist and world record holder Michael Phelps of the United States and silver-medalist Ryan Lochte, also an American.\n\nWith 100-meter to go, Bovell registered a 33.95 in the breaststroke leg, the best split in the field, before clocking a 28.64 to out-touch Laszlo Cseh of Hungary by .04 seconds.\n\n\"George did this in a meet where he was struggling. He wasn't performing up to his or our (the Auburn coaches) standards up to this point,\" Auburn coach David Marsh said. \"But he stepped up tonight and got the job done. He was fighting tooth and nail with Cseh and was able to out-touch him at the wall.\"\n\n\"I hope this success will improve swimming in Trinidad and Tobago and I hope it will encourage the government to improve the swimming facilities,\" Bovell said.\n\nThe medal is Trinidad and Tobago's first in international swimming competition.\n\n\"George is really relieved right now,\" Marsh said. \"The weight that he and his nation put on his shoulders is now gone.\"\n\nJust prior to his swim, the contingent of Auburn swimmers and divers in Athens surrounded Bovell and reminded him to think like it was a SEC or NCAA meet and that he was in Athens as a part of the Auburn team.\n\nPhelps won the event with an Olympic record time of 1:57.14 while Lochte took the silver with a 1:58.78.\n\nAlso on Thursday, Kirsty Coventry and Margaret Hoelzer advanced into the finals of the women's 200-meter backstroke. Coventry, who has already captured two medals at the Olympics, is seeded second with a time if 2:10.04 while Hoelzer is fifth with a 2:11.68.\n\n\"Yesterday, I had a rest day and tonight I just wanted to go out and have fun,\" Coventry said.\n\nShould Coventry win a medal in Friday's finals, she we join Rowdy Gaines as the only Auburn swimmers to ever capture three medals at a single Olympics.\n\nCoventry and Hoelzer had qualified third and fourth, respectively, in the prelims going 2:12.49 and 2:12.55, respectively.\n\n\"I'm like everyone else here, I want to win a gold medal,\" Hoelzer said. Everything is going to plan so far, so I'm OK.\"\n\nAlso moving onto a Friday night final was former Tiger and Australian native Brett Hawke, who holds the second-best time coming out of the semi-finals of the men's 50-meter freestyle with a new Australian record of 22.07. He had qualified for the semis with a 22.42, which placed him tenth.\n\n\"I wanted to come here it and make it to the final, so I'm very happy,\" Hawke said.\n\nCurrent Tiger Fred Bousquet failed to make the finals of the 50m free as his 22.29 in the semis was only 12th-best, that after qualifying second in the prelims with a 22.24.\n\n\"I'm not sad, I'm just disappointed,\" Bousquet said. \"This was one of the fastest 50m (freestyle races) in history. There is just something small missing.\"\n\nBousquet also swam in the prelims of the 100-meter butterfly, clocking a 53.63 to place 25th.\n\nThe individual qualifying will come to an end on Friday. Panamanian Eileen Coparropa will swim the women's 50-meter freestyle while Romain Barnier and Bousquet, both of France, and Matt Kidd of England are all scheduled to swim the prelims of the men's 4x100-meter medley relay.

(AFP PHOTO) -\n\nTRINIDAD AND Tobago have made their mark on the Olympic stage, bringing joy to the people of this country. Weightlifter Rodney Wilkes got the ball rolling at the 1948 London Games which was followed by some memorable performances. Sprinter Hasely Crawford, javelin thrower Keshorn Walcott and a men\u2019s 4x100-metre team all reached the top of the podium and the efforts of swimmer George Bovell and sprinter Ato Boldon will never be forgotten.\n\nOn Tuesday, TT added a third gold medal to this country\u2019s tally as the men\u2019s 4x100m relay team were upgraded to gold, 14 years after earning a silver medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nThis reporter takes a look back at the 19 medals (three gold, five silver and 11 bronze) this country won in the history of the Olympic Games.\n\nTT have picked up medals in three sports at the Olympics \u2013 track and field, weightlifting and swimming.\n\nGOLD\n\nCrawford won TT\u2019s first gold medal at the 1976 Montreal Games.\n\nCrawford had stiff competition heading into the Games as the event included 1972 gold medallist Valeriy Borzov of Soviet Union and the highly favoured Donald Quarrie of Jamaica.\n\nIn the second semifinal, Crawford sealed a place in the final by winning in 10.22 seconds. Quarrie was second in 10.26.\n\nIn the final, Crawford became a household name in TT when crossed the finish line in 10.06. Quarrie was second in 10.08 and Borzov had to settle for bronze in 10.14.\n\nAt the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Jamaica won the men\u2019s 4x100m event, led by legendary sprinter Usain Bolt.\n\nJamaica won the event in 37.10 in a then Olympic and world record.\n\nTT finished second in 38.06.\n\nHowever, in 2017, the International Olympic Committee revealed that Jamaica team member Nesta Carter had violated the anti-doping code by testing positive for methylhexaneamine. Jamaica were disqualified and TT were announced as the new winners.\n\nThe TT team of Richard Thompson, Marc Burns, Keston Bledman, Emmanuel Callender and Aaron Armstrong received their medals in a short Olympic medal reallocation ceremony at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Tuesday.\n\nNot much was expected of Walcott heading into the 2012 London Games. By the end of the Games, Walcott was considered one of this country\u2019s greatest Olympians.\n\nWalcott, only 19 at the time, was still a national junior athlete.\n\nIn the qualifying round, he sealed a place in the final by throwing 81.75m on his third and final throw. Walcott had the tenth best throw among the 12 finalists.\n\nIn the final, Walcott broke the national record with a throw of 84.58m to cop gold.\n\nIt was Walcott\u2019s day as Vitezslav Vesely of Czech Republic, who threw a massive 88.34m in the qualifying round, could only manage an 83.34m throw in the final to snatch bronze.\n\nAntti Ruuskanen of Finland took silver with an 84.12m effort.\n\nSILVER\n\nTT made their Olympic debut at the 1948 London Games with five athletes.\n\nWeightlifter Wilkes became this country\u2019s first Olympic medallist after finishing second in the men\u2019s featherweight.\n\nWilkes, nicknamed the Mighty Midget, died in 2014 at age 89.\n\nWendell Mottley was one of many formidable 400m runners this country produced in the 1960s. At the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Mottley grabbed a silver medal in the men\u2019s 400m event. It was a memorable Games for TT as it was the first Olympics that this country claimed medals in track and field.\n\nTT had to wait 36 years before earning another silver medal. During the 2000 Sydney Games, TT fans had to set their alarms to wake up in the wee hours of the morning to watch Ato Boldon in action because of the 14-hour time difference.\n\nIt was worth it in the end as Boldon finished second in the men\u2019s 100m event. From the mid 1990s to early 2000s TT\u2019s track and field medal hopes relied almost entirely on Boldon\u2019s shoulders.\n\nBoldon inspired a new wave of sprinters and at the 2008 Beijing Games, Richard Thompson announced himself.\n\nThompson was in the form of his life heading into the Beijing Games.\n\nRunning for Louisiana State University, Thompson won the NCAA Men's Outdoor Track Athlete of the Year award and the SEC Men's Outdoor Track Athlete of the Year award.\n\nThompson copped silver in the men\u2019s 100m final behind Bolt, who set a world record of 9.69.\n\nFour years later at the 2012 London Olympics, the quartet of Thompson, Bledman, Callender and Burns took silver in the men\u2019s 4x100m event. It was the most successful Olympics for TT as the team left London with four medals.\n\nBRONZE\n\nEleven of TT\u2019s 19 medals are bronze with Wilkes grabbing the first one at the 1952 Helsinki Games. Following up his silver medal four years earlier, Wilkes took bronze in the men\u2019s featherweight.\n\nWilkes was not the only TT weightlifter to earn a medal at the games as Lennox Kilgour was third in the men\u2019s middle-heavyweight division.\n\nAt the 1964 Tokyo Games, Edwin Roberts became the first TT track and field athlete to cop a sprint medal with his bronze in the men\u2019s 200m event.\n\nRoberts was joined by Mottley, Kent Bernard and Edwin Skinner in the men\u2019s 4x400m race. They did not leave empty-handed, ending third.\n\nIt was a dry period for TT between 1964 and 1996 as during that time Crawford\u2019s gold medal in 1976 was the lone podium finish.\n\nAt the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Boldon ended TT\u2019s drought by copping bronze medals in both the 100m and 200m.\n\nThe 100m final was drama-filled. Linford Christie of Great Britain, the former Olympic champion, false started to add more tension to the race.\n\nBoldon then false started and on the third attempt to start the race Christie false started again and was disqualified.\n\nChristie was reluctant to leave the track but, when he eventually left, the race began.\n\nBoldon led at the 60m mark, but Frankie Fredericks of Namibia and Donovan Bailey of Canada surged to the front. Bailey grabbed gold in a new world record of 9.84, Fredericks was second in 9.89 and Boldon had to settle for bronze in 9.90.\n\nIn the men\u2019s 200m final, Boldon copped his second bronze medal of the Games when he stopped the clock in 19.80.\n\nAmerican Michael Johnson broke the world record on his way to gold in 19.32 and Fredericks was second in 19.68.\n\nBoldon snatched his third bronze medal of his illustrious Olympic career in the men\u2019s 200m event at the 2000 Sydney Games.\n\nBovell was the next athlete to get bronze for TT becoming the first swimmer to earn an Olympic medal at the 2004 Athens Games. A few TT swimmers competed at the Olympics before Bovell.\n\nBovell\u2019s achievement was celebrated as it was TT\u2019s only medal at the 2004 Games.\n\nBovell, competing in the men\u2019s 200m individual medley, touched the wall in one minute, 58.80 seconds (1:58.80) in a new national record.\n\nAmerican swim legend Michael Phelps won in an Olympic record of 1:57.14 and countryman Ryan Lochte was second in 1:58.78.\n\nAt the 2012 London Games, TT, as they did in 1964, showed their prowess in the men\u2019s 400m event.\n\nLalonde Gordon earned bronze in the men\u2019s 400m event and the men\u2019s 4x400m team also took bronze. The TT relay contingent included Gordon, the late Deon Lendore, Jarrin Solomon, Renny Quow, Machel Cedenio and Ade Alleyne-Forte.\n\nTT could not continue their prolific form at the 2016 Rio Olympics as a bronze medal by Walcott in the closing stages of the meet was the only medal earned. It was his second medal after winning gold four years earlier."}, {"url": "https://newsday.co.tt/2020/04/14/olympics-not-life-or-death/", "page_content": "Olympics not life or death\n\nIn this Aug 19,2004 file photo, TT\u2019s George Bovell adjusts his crown after winning the men\u2019s 200m individual medley bronze medal, at the 2004 Olympic Games at the Olympic Aquatic Center in Athens.

I feel sorry for all those athletes who sacrificed so much, trained so hard and some of them who take on lots of debts and spend years after the Olympics paying off.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very sad to see their hopes and dreams crushed like that, and have to postpone everything by a year.\n\nHowever, Bovell III said, \u201cA lot of athletes after the Olympics, experience something called \u2018post-Olympics depression\u2019. It\u2019s where after the Olympics, they\u2019re lost, they don\u2019t know what to do next. They cannot even see beyond the Olympics.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not even living in reality. They\u2019re living in illusions, this kind of collective psychosis as Olympics being the most important thing in the universe. I think this is a reality check. If you fail to live with reality, reality would come and live with you, and you\u2019re not ready for it.\u201d\n\nThe former men\u2019s 200m IM short-course world record holder added, \u201cI think this, for a lot of athletes who have very unhappy lifestyles, mentally unhealthy, very unhappy people, it puts things in perspective. The Olympics is not life or death, it\u2019s just sports and something (we) do because (we) love it. If you need to (get) a medal in the Olympics to prove that you are a champion, if you need that external validation then, deep down inside, you are a loser.\n\n\u201cIf you are secure with yourself, you understand who you are and you understand your limitations, you wouldn\u2019t need any external validation. You don\u2019t need anybody else to tell you you\u2019re great. There are a lot of Olympic gold medallists who, deep down inside, still feel like losers.\u201d\n\nBovell III, who was inducted into the First Citizens Sports Foundation\u2019s Hall of Fame on Sunday, continued, \u201cYou need to be secure with yourself and say are you really doing it for the Olympic status and can show off on social media, because that is a big illusion, or are you doing it because you love it, because it\u2019s a path to self-mastery.\n\n\u201cWhen you control your mind, you control how you think, you have control over yourself. Instead of your environment and your life dictating how you should feel, you choose how you should feel.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://panamericanworld.com/en/magazine/sports/ten-sports-legends-in-trinidad-tobago/", "page_content": "Trinidad & Tobago is a small Caribbean country, but its sports talent is huge. Cricket is the most popular sport in the country and that is why Brian \u201cPrince\u201d Lara is described as a local legend; although this nation\u2019s most outstanding results in international events have delivered by athletics. Who have been the best Trinitarian athletes of all time?\n\nDWIGHT YORKE\n\nThe best moment for one of Trinidad & Tobago\u2019s collective sports was lived back in 2005, when the national soccer team qualified for FIFA World Cup, organized by Germany in 2006. Dwight Yorke was one of the main stars in that team and the most successful Trinitarian soccer player of all time.\n\nHe began his career with Aston Villa club, from the British Premier League, where he scored 97 goals in 231 games. He later took a quality jump by signing with Manchester United, which was managed by Sir Alex Fergusson.\n\nDuring the time he spent playing with 4 clubs, Dwight Yorke conquered 9 titles, 6 with \u201cThe Red Devils\u201d, including three leagues, one FA Cup and one Champions. Yorke wore Trinidad & Tobago\u2019s uniform 72 times and scored 19 goals, won a Caribbean Cup in 1989, and was the captain of the team in the 2006 World Championship.\n\nRelated Article: The 10 Best Colombian Athletes of All Time\n\nBRIAN \u201cPRINCE\u201d LARA\n\nCricket is the most popular sport in Trinidad & Tobago and, among all players born in that country, Brian Lara has been the most acclaimed athlete, also called the \u201cPrince of Port of Spain\u201d. This great athlete, who is already retired, has been labeled as one of the finest batsmen of all time. He holds a record with the highest number of runs scored, both in Test and First Class game: 501, in 1994. Lara is one of the three cricket players that have been given the Foreign Figure of the Year award by BBC and, in 2012, he was included in the cricket Hall of Fame.\n\nATO BOLDON\n\nAto Boldon is the Trinitarian athlete that has won the highest number of medals in Olympic Games, one of the most outstanding Caribbean sprinters in the 1990s, who was on the podium four times in two editions of these Games.\n\nIn Atlanta Games, back in 1996, he finished third in 100-200 meter dash. Four years later, in Sidney, he conquered the silver medal in 100 meter dash, only surpassed by U.S. Maurice Greene, and he repeated the bronze in 200 meter dash. As for IAAF World Championships, Boldon won the title in 200 meter dash, Athens 1997, and he was the runner-up in 100 meter dash in Gothenburg 1995 and Edmonton 2001. The Trinitarian athlete retired in 2005 and he still holds his country\u2019s record in 200 meter dash, with 19.77 seconds.\n\nHASELY CRAWFORD\n\nHasely Crawford was another great Trinitarian sprinter, who wrote his name in record books by becoming the first Caribbean athlete to be an Olympic champion in 100 meter dash. In Montreal Games, 1976, Crawford was the first man to cross the finish line, with 10.06 seconds, barely 0.02 seconds before Jamaican Donald Quarrie.\n\nIn that edition of the Olympic Games, he also qualified for the final of 200 meter dash, but he could not finish the race because of an injury. Crawford also competed in the Moscow Games, 1980, and Los Angeles, 1984, although he was far from his best results.\n\nCrawford got three medals in the British Commonwealth Games: two bronzes in 100 meter dash, in 1970 and 1978, and one silver medal in 4\u00d7100 meter relay, in 1978. That very year, he was also given the highest distinction of the country, the Order of Trinidad & Tobago Republic, and a stadium was named after him. In 2000, he was chosen Best Athlete of the 20th Century in that nation.\n\nKESHORN WALCOTT\n\nThis javelin thrower has made history. In 2012, he stood out as junior world champion, in Barcelona, and conquered the Olympic title some months later, during London Games, with 84.58 meters, thus becoming the first Caribbean javelin thrower to be on top of the podium in an Olympic edition.\n\nThis spectacular win turned him into a local hero and, when he returned to his country, the authorities declared a festive day for the Trinitarian people to celebrate with the champion. Both a lighthouse located in the northeast region of Trinidad and a high school in Toco (his hometown) were named after him.\n\nFour years later, in Rio Olympic Games, Walcott finished third with 85.38 meters. Moreover, Walcott got the title in Toronto Pan-American Games, in 2015, and won the silver medal in the British Commonwealth Games, Glasgow 2014.\n\nRICHARD THOMPSON\n\nThe \u201cTorpedo\u201d Thompson has been one of the best Caribbean sprinters of all time. His 9.82 seconds in 100 meter dash, clocked in Port of Spain 2014, is the ninth fastest mark in history. His curriculum includes an Olympic title in Beijing Games 2008, as a member of the 4\u00d7100 meter relay (second position), right behind Jamaica; but, years later, this team, including Usain Bolt, was disqualified because of Nesta Carter\u2019s doping and, therefore, Thompson changed the color of his medal.\n\nIn that very Olympic edition, the Trinitarian athlete won the silver in 100 meter dash, where he was only left behind by Bolt. In London 2012, the Trinitarian relay team did it great again and Thompson was the closer of the team that finished second. In World Championships, the \u201cTorpedo\u201d collected a silver medal, in 4\u00d7100 relay, in Berlin 2009.\n\nRODNEY WILKES\n\nThis weightlifter was the first athlete to conquer an Olympic medal for Trinidad & Tobago. His name made headlines when he won the Central American and Caribbean Games, in Barranquilla, 1946. In London Olympic Games, 1948, he won the silver medal by lifting 317.5 kilograms, only surpassed by Egyptian Mahmoud Fayad.\n\nIn the Helsinki Olympic Games, 1952, Wilkes was once again on the podium, in the third position. The Trinitarian athlete was strong enough to compete in his third Olympic Games, in Rome 1960, where he finished fourth. Furthermore, Wilkes was the champion in the first edition of Pan-American Games, hosted by Buenos Aires in 1951, and got the title in the British Commonwealth Games, in 1954. Wilkes died of prostate cancer at a San Fernando hospital in 2014, aged 89.\n\nGEORGE BOVELL\n\nBovell can be described as the best Caribbean swimmer of all time. He holds a bronze medal in 200 meters combined, in Athens Olympic Games 2004, as well as two world medals, one in the short event (Istanbul, 2012, bronze in 100 meters combined) and another one in the normal event (Barcelona, 2013, bronze in 50 meters free style). Moreover, Bovell has obtained six medals in Pan-American Games, 2003-2015: 2 gold medals (both in Santo Domingo, 2003), 2 silvers and 2 bronze medals. His curriculum also includes 8 medals in Central American and Caribbean Games (3 gold, 2 silver and 3 bronze medals).\n\nKELLY-ANN BAPTISTE\n\nAlthough this runner has been marked by doping, she can be considered one of the best athletes of her country. In IAAF World Championships, she has obtained two medals: bronze in Daegu 2011, in 100 meter dash, and bronze in Beijing 2015, as a member of her country\u2019s short relay team. She participated in London Olympic Games, 2012, but she didn\u2019t make it to the final in 100 meter dash. This year, she competed in the World Championship hosted by the British capital, where she finished eighth in 100 meter dash.\n\nLALONDE GORDON\n\nGordon has obtained very good results in 400 meter dash and as a member of his country\u2019s 4\u00d7400 relay team. As for Olympic Games, Gordon has won two bronze medals, both in London 2012, and he conquered the title in London 2017, 4\u00d7400 relay. His career also includes a silver medal, in Beijing 2015. He has conquered two medals in indoor World Championships: bronze in long relay in 2012 and 2016."}, {"url": "https://www.meppublishers.com/trinidad-tobagos-olympic-hopefuls-for-london-2012/", "page_content": "As the London 2012 Olympic Games opened Friday night, the hopes of a nation were stirred once again as the 31-member Trinidad & Tobago contingent paraded into the Olympic stadium led by flag-bearer Marc Burns.\n\nDespite the islands\u2019 small size, Trinidad & Tobago has won a number of Olympic medals \u2013 14 overall \u2013 since competing for the first time in 1948.

As in many previous years, Trinidad & Tobago\u2019s best chances lie in Track & Field.\n\nIt was at at the World Junior (under-20) Championships in Moncton, Canada that a young Trinidad and Tobago sprinter, Jehue Gordon, romped home in the men\u2019s 400 hurdles. He had drawn attention a year earlier with a fourth-place finish at the World Championships in Berlin. That championship run was one of the best performances I have ever seen by a Trinidad and Tobago athlete. I stood in awe at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin as the 17-year-old matched strides with the best one-lap hurdlers on the planet. He got home in 48.26 seconds, just three-hundredths of a second slower than bronze medallist Bershawn Jackson of the United States.\n\nIn Berlin, this teenager from Maraval, Port of Spain, became the youngest-ever World Championship finalist in an individual sprint event. Now 20, Gordon is hoping to turn his potential into precious metal in London.\n\nKelly-Ann Baptiste, from Plymouth, Tobago, is another Caribbean woman who could shine in London. In Daegu last year, she became the first female Trinidad and Tobago sprinter to earn a medal at a major senior global meet, taking bronze in the women\u2019s 100.\n\nCycling, Sailing & Swimming\n\nThe 21-year-old Trinidad and Tobago cyclist Njisane Phillip will make his Olympic debut in London: he will not be the favourite for sprint gold, but he should acquit himself well. His compatriot George Bovell, on the other hand, is a veteran swimmer who won a bronze medal in 2004 for the 200 metres individual medley. He will be 29 by the time he dives into the Olympic pool this year. London will be his fourth Olympic Games, and quite possibly his last; but he is determined to make an impression in the 50 metres free.\n\nAndrew Lewisis the first sailor from Trinidad and Tobago to achieve the Olympic qualifying standard in the Laser Class and will be one of only 12 sailors from around the world to compete in that class in London.\n\nIn a nutshell: the Trinidad & Tobago stars to watch\n\nKelly-Ann Baptiste Born October 14, 1986\n\nMain events 100m, 200m\n\nPersonal best 10.84, 22.60\n\nOlympic medals 0 Andrew Lewis Born November 30, 1989\n\nEvent Sailing (Laser standard)\n\nPersonal best National Champion\n\nOlympic medals 0 George Bovell Born July 18, 1983\n\nMain events Swimming: individual medley, freestyle\n\nPersonal best 200m medley 1:58.80, 50m freestyle 21.20\n\nOlympic medals 1 bronze Njisane Phillip Main event Cycling\n\nOlympic medals 0 Jehue Gordon Born December 15, 1991\n\nMain event 400m hurdles\n\nPersonal best 48.26\n\nOlympic medals 0 Richard Thompson Born June 7, 1985\n\nMain events 100m, 200m\n\nPersonal best 9.85, 20.18\n\nOlympic medals 2 silver\n\nAdapted with permission from Caribbean Beat magazine\u2019s Olympic coverage by Kwame Lawrence"}, {"url": "https://olympics.sporting99.com/track-field/mens-200-meter-individual-medley.html", "page_content": "List of all Olympics Men's 200 Meter Individual Medley winners including gold, silver and bronze medalists.\n\nMen's 200 Meter Individual Medley\n\nMen's 200 Meter Individual Medley swimming found a place for the first time at Olympic Games in 1968.

Qualifying for team sports, such as soccer or basketball, usually means surviving the cut at team selection camps. For individual events, such as track and swimming, athletes must earn a position in Olympic Trials that often serve as national championships. In track, for example, the top three athletes in head-to-head competition qualify for an event such as the 100-meter dash.\n\nMSU\u2019s Three-Time Olympians\n\nSix Spartans have participated in three different Olympics.\n\nChris-Carol Bremer, MSU swimmer in 1993-94, competed as a member of the German swimming team in 1992 and 1996, and made Germany\u2019s 2000 Olympic team as captain.

At the first Olympics, a short sprint was the only event, run by men competing in the nude. The Games were held every four years. The period between Games became known as an \u2018Olympiad\u2019. The Greeks used Olympiads as one of their methods to count years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Games declined in importance as the Romans gained power in Greece. When Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire, the Games were seen as a pagan festival and in discord with Christian ethics. In 394 AD emperor Theodosius I outlawed the Olympics...ending a 1,170-year tradition.\u201d (Wikipedia).\n\nHistory And Magnitude of the Modern Olympics\n\nThe first modern Olympics\u2014designated the Games of First Olympiad\u2014were staged in Athens, Greece in April 1896. Opening ceremonies drew 80,000 spectators, including King George I of Greece and his wife Olga, to Panathenaic Stadium. Two hundred forty-one athletes from 14 nations competed in 43 events in 9 sports. Olympic sports then included athletics (track & field), cycling, fencing, gymnastics, shooting, swimming, tennis, weightlifting, and wrestling.\n\nAt the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics, there were 10,625 competitors from 201 countries. There were 301 medal events in 28 different sports. Swimming, diving, synchronized swimming, and water polo are classified as disciplines within the sport of aquatics. For the first time, women\u2019s wrestling was featured.\n\nThe 28 Olympic summer sports are archery, aquatics, badminton, baseball, basketball, boxing, canoeing, cycling, equestrian, fencing, field hockey, football/soccer, gymnastics, handball, judo, modern pentathlon, rowing, sailing, shooting, softball, table tennis, taekwondo, tennis, triathlon, volleyball, weightlifting, wheelchair racing (demonstration event), and wrestling.\n\nU.S. Olympians dominated the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics, winning 102 medals\u201436 gold, 39 silver, and 27 bronze. Other top ten medal winning nations were: Russia-92, China-63, Australia-49, Germany-49, Japan-37, France-33, Italy-32, Great Britain-30, and South Korea-30.\n\nThe 2006 Turin, Italy Winter Olympics featured 2,508 athletes from 80 nations.

Competition will be held in 86 events in 8 sports.\n\nThree Olympic Games were cancelled: in 1916 due to World War I; and in 1940 and 1944 due to World War II.\n\nOlympics: Great Media Events\n\nThe Olympics have become one the world\u2019s great news media events. At the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics, more than 16,000 journalists and broadcasters were present to report on the Games. An estimated 3.8 billion viewers watched the Games on television. A record number of journalists is expected to attend the Beijing Olympics and Spartan Kevan Gosper, \u201955, heads up the IOC Press Commission.\n\nThe Olympic Flame\n\n\u201cAt the Ancient Olympic Games\u2014held in Greece 2,700 years ago\u2014the tradition of an Olympic flame was ignited, and it burned throughout the games every four years. It symbolized the death and rebirth of Greek heroes.\n\n\u201cThe first torch relay was launched at the 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics. A new flame is lit for every Olympiad in the ancient Olympic stadium in Olympia, Elis, Greece, using a parabolic mirror to focus the rays of the sun.\n\n\u201cThe Olympic Torch Relay begins by touring Greece. The flame is then transported (usually by air) to the nation where the Games will be held. After traversing the nation of the Games, carried by runners, walkers, riding horses, and even camels, the last runner lights the large torch in the Olympic stadium where it burns for the duration of the Games.\u201d (Enchanted Learning.com).\n\nThe Olympic Flag\n\n\u201cThe flag of the Olympic Games has five interlocking rings\u2013blue, yellow, black, green, and red\u2013on a white background. The rings represent the five sections of the world joined together in the Olympic movement: Africa, the Americas, Asia, Australia, and Europe.\n\n\u201cBaron de Couberin (1863-1937), a French educator, designed the flag in 1913-1914. It was first used at the 1920 Antwerp, Belgium Summer Olympics.\n\n\u201cThe flag is paraded during the opening ceremonies of each Olympics and flown during the Games. At the closing ceremonies of each Olympics, the mayor of the host-city presents the flag to the mayor of the next host-city. The flag then remains in the city hall of the next host-city until the opening ceremonies of the Games.\u201d (Enchanted Learning.com)\n\nAs the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics approach\u2014August 8-24\u2014the Michigan State family will be pulling for a dozen Spartans to earn positions on U.S. Olympic teams: Jamie Krzyminski in the women's marathon; Christen Brown in rowing; Nicole Bush in track; Sevatheda Fynes in track; Jolene Crooks Moore and Kristen Furseth-Mullaney in racewalking; Jeremy Orr in track; Marcus Poteete in swimming; Nick Simmons in wrestling; and Paul Terek in the decathlon. Spartans will also be pulling for two Canadian athletes\u2014MSU junior Danielle Williams, who is vying to make the Canadian team in three-meter diving, and MSU graduate student Nicole Forrester, Canada\u2019s top-ranked high jumper, who has a great chance to compete for her country in Beijing. If one or all succeed, it will sustain MSU's record of participating in every Summer Olympics from 1924 to 2008\u201419 consecutive\u2014with the exception of the boycotted 1980 Moscow Games.\n\nMSU OLYMPIANS BY YEAR\n\n1924\u2013Colonel William D.

Barring the inaugural modern Games at Athens 1896, the men\u2019s 200m has seen a permanent presence at the Olympics from Paris 1900. The women\u2019s event has been held since London 1948.\n\nThe USA have been the most successful nation in the 200m, winning 17 out of the 28 gold medals in the men\u2019s 200m and six out of 19 in the women\u2019s 200m. Jamaica have won as many overall medals as the USA in women\u2019s 200m \u2013 13.\n\nAmerican men have swept all three 200m medals at the Olympics on as many as six occasions: St Louis 1904, Los Angeles 1932, Helsinki 1952, Melbourne 1956, Los Angeles 1984 and Athens 2004. No country has swept the three 200m medals in the women\u2019s event so far, although there have been quite a few doubles.\n\nUsain Bolt is the most successful athlete in the 200m with three gold medals, while another Jamaican Merlene Ottey has won the most medals \u2013 four (one silver, three bronze).\n\nNo man apart from Usain Bolt has won multiple 200m gold medals.

(AFP PHOTO) -\n\nTRINIDAD AND Tobago have made their mark on the Olympic stage, bringing joy to the people of this country. Weightlifter Rodney Wilkes got the ball rolling at the 1948 London Games which was followed by some memorable performances. Sprinter Hasely Crawford, javelin thrower Keshorn Walcott and a men\u2019s 4x100-metre team all reached the top of the podium and the efforts of swimmer George Bovell and sprinter Ato Boldon will never be forgotten.\n\nOn Tuesday, TT added a third gold medal to this country\u2019s tally as the men\u2019s 4x100m relay team were upgraded to gold, 14 years after earning a silver medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nThis reporter takes a look back at the 19 medals (three gold, five silver and 11 bronze) this country won in the history of the Olympic Games.\n\nTT have picked up medals in three sports at the Olympics \u2013 track and field, weightlifting and swimming.\n\nGOLD\n\nCrawford won TT\u2019s first gold medal at the 1976 Montreal Games.\n\nCrawford had stiff competition heading into the Games as the event included 1972 gold medallist Valeriy Borzov of Soviet Union and the highly favoured Donald Quarrie of Jamaica.\n\nIn the second semifinal, Crawford sealed a place in the final by winning in 10.22 seconds. Quarrie was second in 10.26.\n\nIn the final, Crawford became a household name in TT when crossed the finish line in 10.06. Quarrie was second in 10.08 and Borzov had to settle for bronze in 10.14.\n\nAt the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Jamaica won the men\u2019s 4x100m event, led by legendary sprinter Usain Bolt.\n\nJamaica won the event in 37.10 in a then Olympic and world record.\n\nTT finished second in 38.06.\n\nHowever, in 2017, the International Olympic Committee revealed that Jamaica team member Nesta Carter had violated the anti-doping code by testing positive for methylhexaneamine. Jamaica were disqualified and TT were announced as the new winners.\n\nThe TT team of Richard Thompson, Marc Burns, Keston Bledman, Emmanuel Callender and Aaron Armstrong received their medals in a short Olympic medal reallocation ceremony at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Tuesday.\n\nNot much was expected of Walcott heading into the 2012 London Games. By the end of the Games, Walcott was considered one of this country\u2019s greatest Olympians.\n\nWalcott, only 19 at the time, was still a national junior athlete.\n\nIn the qualifying round, he sealed a place in the final by throwing 81.75m on his third and final throw. Walcott had the tenth best throw among the 12 finalists.\n\nIn the final, Walcott broke the national record with a throw of 84.58m to cop gold.\n\nIt was Walcott\u2019s day as Vitezslav Vesely of Czech Republic, who threw a massive 88.34m in the qualifying round, could only manage an 83.34m throw in the final to snatch bronze.\n\nAntti Ruuskanen of Finland took silver with an 84.12m effort.\n\nSILVER\n\nTT made their Olympic debut at the 1948 London Games with five athletes.\n\nWeightlifter Wilkes became this country\u2019s first Olympic medallist after finishing second in the men\u2019s featherweight.\n\nWilkes, nicknamed the Mighty Midget, died in 2014 at age 89.\n\nWendell Mottley was one of many formidable 400m runners this country produced in the 1960s. At the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Mottley grabbed a silver medal in the men\u2019s 400m event. It was a memorable Games for TT as it was the first Olympics that this country claimed medals in track and field.\n\nTT had to wait 36 years before earning another silver medal. During the 2000 Sydney Games, TT fans had to set their alarms to wake up in the wee hours of the morning to watch Ato Boldon in action because of the 14-hour time difference.\n\nIt was worth it in the end as Boldon finished second in the men\u2019s 100m event. From the mid 1990s to early 2000s TT\u2019s track and field medal hopes relied almost entirely on Boldon\u2019s shoulders.\n\nBoldon inspired a new wave of sprinters and at the 2008 Beijing Games, Richard Thompson announced himself.\n\nThompson was in the form of his life heading into the Beijing Games.\n\nRunning for Louisiana State University, Thompson won the NCAA Men's Outdoor Track Athlete of the Year award and the SEC Men's Outdoor Track Athlete of the Year award.\n\nThompson copped silver in the men\u2019s 100m final behind Bolt, who set a world record of 9.69.\n\nFour years later at the 2012 London Olympics, the quartet of Thompson, Bledman, Callender and Burns took silver in the men\u2019s 4x100m event. It was the most successful Olympics for TT as the team left London with four medals.\n\nBRONZE\n\nEleven of TT\u2019s 19 medals are bronze with Wilkes grabbing the first one at the 1952 Helsinki Games. Following up his silver medal four years earlier, Wilkes took bronze in the men\u2019s featherweight.\n\nWilkes was not the only TT weightlifter to earn a medal at the games as Lennox Kilgour was third in the men\u2019s middle-heavyweight division.\n\nAt the 1964 Tokyo Games, Edwin Roberts became the first TT track and field athlete to cop a sprint medal with his bronze in the men\u2019s 200m event.\n\nRoberts was joined by Mottley, Kent Bernard and Edwin Skinner in the men\u2019s 4x400m race. They did not leave empty-handed, ending third.\n\nIt was a dry period for TT between 1964 and 1996 as during that time Crawford\u2019s gold medal in 1976 was the lone podium finish.\n\nAt the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Boldon ended TT\u2019s drought by copping bronze medals in both the 100m and 200m.\n\nThe 100m final was drama-filled. Linford Christie of Great Britain, the former Olympic champion, false started to add more tension to the race.\n\nBoldon then false started and on the third attempt to start the race Christie false started again and was disqualified.\n\nChristie was reluctant to leave the track but, when he eventually left, the race began.\n\nBoldon led at the 60m mark, but Frankie Fredericks of Namibia and Donovan Bailey of Canada surged to the front. Bailey grabbed gold in a new world record of 9.84, Fredericks was second in 9.89 and Boldon had to settle for bronze in 9.90.\n\nIn the men\u2019s 200m final, Boldon copped his second bronze medal of the Games when he stopped the clock in 19.80.\n\nAmerican Michael Johnson broke the world record on his way to gold in 19.32 and Fredericks was second in 19.68.\n\nBoldon snatched his third bronze medal of his illustrious Olympic career in the men\u2019s 200m event at the 2000 Sydney Games.\n\nBovell was the next athlete to get bronze for TT becoming the first swimmer to earn an Olympic medal at the 2004 Athens Games. A few TT swimmers competed at the Olympics before Bovell.\n\nBovell\u2019s achievement was celebrated as it was TT\u2019s only medal at the 2004 Games.\n\nBovell, competing in the men\u2019s 200m individual medley, touched the wall in one minute, 58.80 seconds (1:58.80) in a new national record.\n\nAmerican swim legend Michael Phelps won in an Olympic record of 1:57.14 and countryman Ryan Lochte was second in 1:58.78.\n\nAt the 2012 London Games, TT, as they did in 1964, showed their prowess in the men\u2019s 400m event.\n\nLalonde Gordon earned bronze in the men\u2019s 400m event and the men\u2019s 4x400m team also took bronze. The TT relay contingent included Gordon, the late Deon Lendore, Jarrin Solomon, Renny Quow, Machel Cedenio and Ade Alleyne-Forte.\n\nTT could not continue their prolific form at the 2016 Rio Olympics as a bronze medal by Walcott in the closing stages of the meet was the only medal earned. It was his second medal after winning gold four years earlier."}, {"url": "https://auburntigers.com/news/2004/8/19/Bovell_Wins_Bronze_Medal_in_200m_IM_at_2004_Olympics.aspx", "page_content": "Bovell Wins Bronze Medal in 200m IM at 2004 Olympics\n\nAug. 19, 2004\n\nGeorge Bovell\n\nATHENS, Greece -- George Bovell captured a bronze medal in the men's 200-meter individual medley at the XXVIII Olympic Games on Thursday night as the Trinidad and Tobago native clocked a 1:58.80.\n\n\"I dived in and felt my stroke fly,\" Bovell said afterward. \"I felt it would be an easy, smooth race. I had doubts in the backstroke, but I pushed through the pain and just looked to bring it home.\"\n\nBovell's leadoff butterfly stroke was a 26.22, which put him in sixth at the first turn. He then turned over to clock a 29.94 in the backstroke, which moved him into third behind eventual gold-medalist and world record holder Michael Phelps of the United States and silver-medalist Ryan Lochte, also an American.\n\nWith 100-meter to go, Bovell registered a 33.95 in the breaststroke leg, the best split in the field, before clocking a 28.64 to out-touch Laszlo Cseh of Hungary by .04 seconds.\n\n\"George did this in a meet where he was struggling. He wasn't performing up to his or our (the Auburn coaches) standards up to this point,\" Auburn coach David Marsh said. \"But he stepped up tonight and got the job done. He was fighting tooth and nail with Cseh and was able to out-touch him at the wall.\"\n\n\"I hope this success will improve swimming in Trinidad and Tobago and I hope it will encourage the government to improve the swimming facilities,\" Bovell said.\n\nThe medal is Trinidad and Tobago's first in international swimming competition.\n\n\"George is really relieved right now,\" Marsh said. \"The weight that he and his nation put on his shoulders is now gone.\"\n\nJust prior to his swim, the contingent of Auburn swimmers and divers in Athens surrounded Bovell and reminded him to think like it was a SEC or NCAA meet and that he was in Athens as a part of the Auburn team.\n\nPhelps won the event with an Olympic record time of 1:57.14 while Lochte took the silver with a 1:58.78.\n\nAlso on Thursday, Kirsty Coventry and Margaret Hoelzer advanced into the finals of the women's 200-meter backstroke. Coventry, who has already captured two medals at the Olympics, is seeded second with a time if 2:10.04 while Hoelzer is fifth with a 2:11.68.\n\n\"Yesterday, I had a rest day and tonight I just wanted to go out and have fun,\" Coventry said.\n\nShould Coventry win a medal in Friday's finals, she we join Rowdy Gaines as the only Auburn swimmers to ever capture three medals at a single Olympics.\n\nCoventry and Hoelzer had qualified third and fourth, respectively, in the prelims going 2:12.49 and 2:12.55, respectively.\n\n\"I'm like everyone else here, I want to win a gold medal,\" Hoelzer said. Everything is going to plan so far, so I'm OK.\"\n\nAlso moving onto a Friday night final was former Tiger and Australian native Brett Hawke, who holds the second-best time coming out of the semi-finals of the men's 50-meter freestyle with a new Australian record of 22.07. He had qualified for the semis with a 22.42, which placed him tenth.\n\n\"I wanted to come here it and make it to the final, so I'm very happy,\" Hawke said.\n\nCurrent Tiger Fred Bousquet failed to make the finals of the 50m free as his 22.29 in the semis was only 12th-best, that after qualifying second in the prelims with a 22.24.\n\n\"I'm not sad, I'm just disappointed,\" Bousquet said. \"This was one of the fastest 50m (freestyle races) in history. There is just something small missing.\"\n\nBousquet also swam in the prelims of the 100-meter butterfly, clocking a 53.63 to place 25th.\n\nThe individual qualifying will come to an end on Friday.

AFP PHOTO -\n\nOLYMPIC 2004 bronze medallist George Bovell III feels sorry for the athletes who had to delay either their 2020 Tokyo Olympics dreams or participation by a year, due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHowever, the 36-year-old legendary swimmer made it clear that this episode can be a reality check for a number of athletes since there is more to life than the Olympics.\n\nThe Tokyo Games, which were originally carded from July 24 to August 9, 2020, will now take place from July 23 to August 8, 2021.\n\nBovell III finished third in the men\u2019s 200-metre individual medley at the Athens Olympics, becoming the lone TT Olympic swimming medallist.\n\nDuring a recent interview, Bovell III, who competed in five Olympics (2000 in Melbourne, Australia; 2004; 2008 in Beijing, China; 2012 in London, England and 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), said, \u201cIt\u2019s very unfortunate.

It\u2019s where after the Olympics, they\u2019re lost, they don\u2019t know what to do next. They cannot even see beyond the Olympics.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not even living in reality.

The Olympics is not life or death, it\u2019s just sports and something (we) do because (we) love it. If you need to (get) a medal in the Olympics to prove that you are a champion, if you need that external validation then, deep down inside, you are a loser.\n\n\u201cIf you are secure with yourself, you understand who you are and you understand your limitations, you wouldn\u2019t need any external validation. You don\u2019t need anybody else to tell you you\u2019re great. There are a lot of Olympic gold medallists who, deep down inside, still feel like losers.\u201d\n\nBovell III, who was inducted into the First Citizens Sports Foundation\u2019s Hall of Fame on Sunday, continued, \u201cYou need to be secure with yourself and say are you really doing it for the Olympic status and can show off on social media, because that is a big illusion, or are you doing it because you love it, because it\u2019s a path to self-mastery.\n\n\u201cWhen you control your mind, you control how you think, you have control over yourself.

Michael Phelps, arguably the best swimmer in history, is regarded as one of the greatest athletes of all time, not just due to his record-breaking feats, but also due to the longevity of his career. Born on June 30, 1985, in Baltimore, Maryland, Phelps took to swimming at the age of seven. He trained with coach Bob Bowman at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club and quickly broke multiple age-group records. His large frame, broad shoulders and big feet, which act like fins in the water, made his body the perfect fit for swimming. So much that Phelps won the highest number of medals in the entire Olympics - 28 medals across five Summer Games. Michael Phelps\u2019 Olympics medals tally consists of 23 gold medals \u2013 the most Olympic gold medals ever won - three silver and two bronze medals. Here, we take a look at Michael Phelps\u2019 medal performances in each of the Olympics he took part in: Athens 2004 Michael Phelps was only 15 when he made the American swimming Olympics team for Sydney 2000. He finished just fifth in the 200-metre butterfly final but he would win golds four years later. The 400m individual medley at Athens 2004 gave Phelps his first Olympic gold medal and his time of 4:08.26 made him the then-world record holder, which was three seconds faster than his second-placed compatriot Erik Vendt.\n\nMichael Phelps celebrates his first Olympic gold medal at Athens 2004.\n\nBronze in the 4x100 m freestyle and 200m freestyle followed in the next two days before Phelps reached the top step again in the 200-metre butterfly in an Olympic record time of 1:54.04. In the 4x200m freestyle relay, his second team event, Phelps, Ryan Lochte, Peter Vanderkaay and Klete Keller became gold medallists before Phelps won two more golds - the 200-metre individual medley and 100-metre butterfly. He then opted out of swimming in the 4x100m medley final, instead allowing Ian Crocker to swim. The American team duly won gold with a world record time of 3:30.68 but since Phelps had swum in the heats, he was also handed a gold medal. Over the course of a week, the 19-year-old Phelps had won five golds and two bronze, his seven-medal haul making it the second biggest in Olympic history behind Mark Spitz, who had won seven golds at Munich 1972. Phelps would go on to beat that in four years\u2019 time. Athens 2004 Medal Haul: Five golds, two bronze Beijing 2008 The swimming pools at the Beijing National Aquatics Centre played host to the American swimming legend\u2019s consummate Olympic performance. How many gold medals did Michael Phelps win you ask? Well, the answer is eight, each of them in either world or Olympic record time, and it also broke Mark Spitz\u2019s 36-year record for most gold medals in a single Olympics. He ended up winning gold medals in the 400-metre individual medley, 200-metre freestyle, 100-metre butterfly, 200-metre butterfly, 200-metre medley, 4x100m freestyle, 4x200m freestyle and 4x100m medley. He broke his own world records in the first categories while setting new ones in every other category except the 100-metre butterfly. However, Phelps swam the 100-metre butterfly in an Olympic record time to become the first swimmer to defend an Olympic butterfly title. It also brought his seventh gold at Beijing 2008, which took him level with Mark Spitz then. Phelps went on to break that long-standing record with an incredible eighth gold medal of the Olympics in the 4x100m medley relay as teammates Brendan Hansen, Aaron Peirsol and Jason Lezak helped deliver it in a world record time of 3:29.34, breaking their existing record by more than a second. Michael Phelps, already a great after the 2004 Olympics, had now truly etched his name in the annals of history. Beijing 2008 Medal Haul: Eight golds\n\nPhelps conquers all in Beijing\n\nLondon 2012 In contrast to his other Olympics appearances, London 2012 did not start off with a medal for Phelps. In fact, his first gold medal came in the fourth event he participated in. He finished fourth in the 400-metre individual medley, the first time he had missed out on any medal since 2000. He was consigned to silver medals in the 200-metre butterfly by South African swimmer Chad le Clos and 4x100m freestyle relay by the French team. The American swimmer won his first gold at the 2012 Olympics in the 4x200m freestyle relay and followed it up with another in the 200-metre individual medley, beating compatriot Ryan Lochte. At this point, Michael Phelps' medals tally at the Olympics was 19, one more than gymnast Larisa Latynina, and became the all-time record holder of most Olympic medals won.\n\nMichael Phelps\u2019 gold in the 200-metre individual medley made him the most successful athlete in Olympic history.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t done yet. Phelps returned to the pool to win two more golds \u2013 in the 100-metre butterfly and 4x100m medley to end with six medals at the event, making him the most successful swimmer for the third Olympics in a row. He announced his retirement after the 2012 Olympics, claiming that he was \u2018done with the sport\u2019. There was one final twist in the tale for the decorated Olympian though. London 2012 Medal Haul: Four golds, two silvers Rio 2016 The allure of the water proved too tempting for Phelps and the American legend announced in April 2014 that he would make a return to the pool. The motivation now was to just swim for himself and not train specifically for any glory. However, you cannot quite keep Phelps away from medals, as was proved at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. The 4x100m freestyle relay brought Phelps his first gold medal at Rio 2016. The 200-meter butterfly and 200-metre individual medley brought two more solo gold medals. Conor Dwyer, Townley Haas and Ryan Lochte played their part in delivering yet another gold medal for Phelps in the 4x200m freestyle relay. Phelps\u2019 final individual event at the Olympics did not end with a customary gold, as he was beaten in the 100-meter butterfly by Singapore\u2019s Joseph Schooling to end up with silver.\n\nMichael Phelps ended his career with team gold in the 4x100m medley relay at Rio 2016.\n\nHowever, in quite the perfect way to end his swimming career, Michael Phelps won gold in the 4x100m medley along with Ryan Murphy, Cody Miller and Nathan Adrian with the American team breaking the Olympic record with a 3:27.95. It brought the curtains on a terrific career for Michael Phelps, who had won six more medals at 31 years old, when most swimmers are well into retirement. Phelps is undoubtedly one of the greatest Olympians of all time.

Their U.S. team berets became the \u201cmust have\u201d item at the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Games. They also have outfitted Canadian and British Olympic teams.\n\nMSU turfgrass experts John \u201cTrey\u201d Rogers, III, professor of crop and soil sciences, and doctoral student Alec Kowalewski spearheaded the construction of the modular turfgrass field for the Beijing National Stadium.\n\nMSU Olympic Gold Medal Winners\n\n1928\u2014The first Spartan to win Olympic gold was sprinter Frederick P. Alderman at the 1928 Summer Games in Amsterdam, Holland, who helped set the world record in the 4x400-meter relay (3:14.2).\n\nAlderman was MSU\u2019s first individual NCAA champion in any sport. He blazed to NCAA titles in the 100-yard and 220-yard dashes at the 1927 NCAA track & field championships in Chicago\u2019s Soldier Field. Along with fellow Spartan sprinters Bohn Grim, Forrest Lang, and Henry Henson, they tied the world record in the 4x110-yard relay at 41.6 seconds in 1927. In 1996, Alderman, then 91, helped carry the Olympic torch to the Atlanta Summer Games.\n\n1952\u2014Clarke C.

Qualifying for team sports, such as soccer or basketball, usually means surviving the cut at team selection camps. For individual events, such as track and swimming, athletes must earn a position in Olympic Trials that often serve as national championships. In track, for example, the top three athletes in head-to-head competition qualify for an event such as the 100-meter dash.\n\nMSU\u2019s Three-Time Olympians\n\nSix Spartans have participated in three different Olympics.\n\nChris-Carol Bremer, MSU swimmer in 1993-94, competed as a member of the German swimming team in 1992 and 1996, and made Germany\u2019s 2000 Olympic team as captain. Bremer holds the MSU record in the 200-yard butterfly (1:45.71) and ranks in MSU\u2019s top ten in 200-, 500-, 1,000- and 1,650-yard freestyle and in the 400-yard individual medley.\n\nErnest Crosbie represented the U.S. in the 50 kilometer race walk at the 1932 Los Angeles Summer Olympics; the 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics; and the 1948 London Summer Olympics. It\u2019s remarkable that the span of time between Crosbie\u2019s second and third Olympics was 12 years. This resulted from cancellation of the 1940 and 1944 Olympiads due to World War II. Crosbie\u2019s race walking event was not an NCAA track event.\n\nDr. Adolf Weinacker, \u201951,participated in the 50 kilometer race walk at the 1948 London Summer Olympics; the 1952 Helsinki Summer Olympics; and the 1956 Melbourne Summer Olympics.\n\nAllan S.

Young\u2013MSU Athletic Director\u2014associate U.S. track coach\u20131932 Los Angeles Summer Olympics; and assistant treasurer U.S. Olympic team\u20131952 Helsinki Summer Olympics. Under Young, MSU athletic director (1923-1954), MSU became a national sports power. During the five-year span 1950-1954, MSU had no fewer than five sports teams ranked in the top ten nationally every year. Young initiated the annual NCAA cross country meet, which was held on the MSU campus every year from 1938 through 1964.\n\nMSU\u2019s outdoor track and field facility is named in Young\u2019s honor, as is the athletic fund that helps underwrite MSU\u2019s 25 sports\u201412 men\u2019s and 13 women\u2019s.\n\nCharles W. Speiser\u2013Boxing\u20131948 London Summer Games; 1952 Helsinki Summer Games. Speiser won NCAA boxing titles in 1951 at 175 pounds; and in 1952 at 178 pounds.\n\nKevan Gosper, \u201855\u2013 Australian track team\u20131956 Melbourne, and 1960 Rome Summer Olympics (see profile).\n\nVirginia Baxter McKendrick\u2013Figure Skating\u20131956 Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo, Italy Winter Olympics; 1960 Squaw Valley Winter Olympics.\n\nWeldon H.

Russell was inducted into the U.S. National Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 1986. She was the University of Florida gymnastics coach and led the Gators to three national team titles, and posted a record of 140 dual meet victories versus just eight losses. In 1955 Russell won a National Amateur Athletic Union title.\n\nJudy K.

He didn't medal in the Olympics but won five national weightlifting championships (at 165 and 181 pounds) along with gold medals at the Pan American Games of 1963 and 1967. Because of the 65-nation boycott of the 1980 Moscow Summer Games, Puleo competed in a substitute championship held in China and thus became the U.S. weightlifter with the longest international career.\n\nMarilyn Corson Whitney, \u201972, M.A. \u201874\u2014Swimming (4x100-meter freestyle relay)\u2014Canada\u2014Bronze Medal\u20141968 Mexico City and 1972 Munich Games.

Young, associate track coach, USA, Los Angeles Summer Games.\n\n1960\u2014Pete Newell, MSU men\u2019s basketball coach from 1950-54, was head coach of the 1960 U.S. men\u2019s basketball team\u2014a powerful squad that some later called the \u201coriginal Dream Team.\u201d Newell led players like Oscar Robertson, Jerry Lucas, Walt Bellamy and Jerry West to an undefeated Olympics, averaging 102 points and a 42.4-point winning margin per game. A \u201cHall of Fame\u201d coach, Newell is one of only three coaches to have won an N.I.T. championship, an NCAA championship, and Olympic gold.\n\n1968\u2014Danny Litwhiler, MSU baseball coach from 1964-82 and a member of the American Baseball Coaches Hall of Fame, led the U.S. baseball team to a gold medal in the 1968 Mexico City Games. Baseball was then a demonstration sport.\n\n1988, 1992\u2014Tom Minkel, MSU wrestling coach since 1991, was assistant coach of the U.S. Greco-Roman wrestling team at the 1988 Seoul Summer Games and head Greco-Roman coach at the 1992 Barcelona Summer Games, where he led his team to a bronze medal, the highest finish ever by a U.S. team in Greco-Roman wrestling.\n\n1996\u2014Michele Madison, assistant coach, USA field hockey, Atlanta Summer Games.\n\n2000\u2014Karen Dennis, \u201977, M.A. \u201979, was the U.S. Olympic Women\u2019s Track Coach in 2000, leading the team to five gold and three bronze medals at the Sydney Summer Olympics.

Dennis now serves as women\u2019s track coach at The Ohio State University.\n\n2004\u2014Manabu \u201cManny\u201d Noguchi, Barbadosswimming coach at the Athens Summer Games.\n\nThe Ancient Olympic Games\n\n\u201cThe Ancient Olympic Games were initiated in 776 BC in Greece, and were held on the plain of Olympia in Peloponnesos. At the first Olympics, a short sprint was the only event, run by men competing in the nude. The Games were held every four years. The period between Games became known as an \u2018Olympiad\u2019. The Greeks used Olympiads as one of their methods to count years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Games declined in importance as the Romans gained power in Greece. When Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire, the Games were seen as a pagan festival and in discord with Christian ethics. In 394 AD emperor Theodosius I outlawed the Olympics...ending a 1,170-year tradition.\u201d (Wikipedia).\n\nHistory And Magnitude of the Modern Olympics\n\nThe first modern Olympics\u2014designated the Games of First Olympiad\u2014were staged in Athens, Greece in April 1896. Opening ceremonies drew 80,000 spectators, including King George I of Greece and his wife Olga, to Panathenaic Stadium. Two hundred forty-one athletes from 14 nations competed in 43 events in 9 sports. Olympic sports then included athletics (track & field), cycling, fencing, gymnastics, shooting, swimming, tennis, weightlifting, and wrestling.\n\nAt the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics, there were 10,625 competitors from 201 countries. There were 301 medal events in 28 different sports. Swimming, diving, synchronized swimming, and water polo are classified as disciplines within the sport of aquatics. For the first time, women\u2019s wrestling was featured.\n\nThe 28 Olympic summer sports are archery, aquatics, badminton, baseball, basketball, boxing, canoeing, cycling, equestrian, fencing, field hockey, football/soccer, gymnastics, handball, judo, modern pentathlon, rowing, sailing, shooting, softball, table tennis, taekwondo, tennis, triathlon, volleyball, weightlifting, wheelchair racing (demonstration event), and wrestling.\n\nU.S. Olympians dominated the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics, winning 102 medals\u201436 gold, 39 silver, and 27 bronze. Other top ten medal winning nations were: Russia-92, China-63, Australia-49, Germany-49, Japan-37, France-33, Italy-32, Great Britain-30, and South Korea-30.\n\nThe 2006 Turin, Italy Winter Olympics featured 2,508 athletes from 80 nations. They competed in 84 events in 15 different disciplines\u2014ice hockey, figure skating, speed skating, snowboarding, luge, bobsled, skeleton (a type of sledding), curling, cross-country skiing, freestyle skiing, slalom, downhill (Alpine) skiing, ski jumping, Nordic combined (skiing plus ski jumping), and biathlon (skiing and shooting).\n\nThe top 11 medal winning nations were\u2014Germany-29, United States-25, Canada-24, Austria-23, Russia-22, Sweden-14, Switzerland-14, South Korea-11, Italy-11, France-9, Netherlands-9.\n\nThe 2010 XXI Winter Olympics will be held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada at the Whistler Olympic Park. Competition will be held in 86 events in 8 sports.\n\nThree Olympic Games were cancelled: in 1916 due to World War I; and in 1940 and 1944 due to World War II.\n\nOlympics: Great Media Events\n\nThe Olympics have become one the world\u2019s great news media events. At the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics, more than 16,000 journalists and broadcasters were present to report on the Games. An estimated 3.8 billion viewers watched the Games on television. A record number of journalists is expected to attend the Beijing Olympics and Spartan Kevan Gosper, \u201955, heads up the IOC Press Commission.\n\nThe Olympic Flame\n\n\u201cAt the Ancient Olympic Games\u2014held in Greece 2,700 years ago\u2014the tradition of an Olympic flame was ignited, and it burned throughout the games every four years. It symbolized the death and rebirth of Greek heroes.\n\n\u201cThe first torch relay was launched at the 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics. A new flame is lit for every Olympiad in the ancient Olympic stadium in Olympia, Elis, Greece, using a parabolic mirror to focus the rays of the sun.\n\n\u201cThe Olympic Torch Relay begins by touring Greece. The flame is then transported (usually by air) to the nation where the Games will be held. After traversing the nation of the Games, carried by runners, walkers, riding horses, and even camels, the last runner lights the large torch in the Olympic stadium where it burns for the duration of the Games.\u201d (Enchanted Learning.com).\n\nThe Olympic Flag\n\n\u201cThe flag of the Olympic Games has five interlocking rings\u2013blue, yellow, black, green, and red\u2013on a white background. The rings represent the five sections of the world joined together in the Olympic movement: Africa, the Americas, Asia, Australia, and Europe.\n\n\u201cBaron de Couberin (1863-1937), a French educator, designed the flag in 1913-1914. It was first used at the 1920 Antwerp, Belgium Summer Olympics.\n\n\u201cThe flag is paraded during the opening ceremonies of each Olympics and flown during the Games. At the closing ceremonies of each Olympics, the mayor of the host-city presents the flag to the mayor of the next host-city. The flag then remains in the city hall of the next host-city until the opening ceremonies of the Games.\u201d (Enchanted Learning.com)\n\nAs the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics approach\u2014August 8-24\u2014the Michigan State family will be pulling for a dozen Spartans to earn positions on U.S. Olympic teams: Jamie Krzyminski in the women's marathon; Christen Brown in rowing; Nicole Bush in track; Sevatheda Fynes in track; Jolene Crooks Moore and Kristen Furseth-Mullaney in racewalking; Jeremy Orr in track; Marcus Poteete in swimming; Nick Simmons in wrestling; and Paul Terek in the decathlon. Spartans will also be pulling for two Canadian athletes\u2014MSU junior Danielle Williams, who is vying to make the Canadian team in three-meter diving, and MSU graduate student Nicole Forrester, Canada\u2019s top-ranked high jumper, who has a great chance to compete for her country in Beijing. If one or all succeed, it will sustain MSU's record of participating in every Summer Olympics from 1924 to 2008\u201419 consecutive\u2014with the exception of the boycotted 1980 Moscow Games.\n\nMSU OLYMPIANS BY YEAR\n\n1924\u2013Colonel William D.
