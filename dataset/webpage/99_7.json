{"Hope Cooke was instrumental in the modernization of Sikkim.": [{"url": "https://www.historyofroyalwomen.com/the-royal-women/last-gyalmo-sikkim-hope-cooke/", "page_content": "\u201cThe Fairytale Turned Nightmare?\u201d reads the headline of the New York Times from May 1981 referencing to a lesser known American woman who married into a royal family. That woman was Hope Cooke. It was based on her autobiography.\n\nIt spoke about how the American media was enamoured with an American marrying Crown Prince Palden Thondup Namgyal of Sikkim in 1963. The press always heavily followed any trips of theirs to the United States. Vogue wanted to know her beauty secrets. What the media did not know was that this so-called fairy tale was anything but.\n\nHope Cooke was born on 24 June 1940 in San Francisco, California to John J. Cooke and Hope Noyes. When Hope was not yet two, her mother died in a single person plane crash in 1942. Her father then moved her and her sister, Harriet, to New York City with him to an apartment that was across the hall from their maternal grandparents (who Hope claimed were aloof and refused to talk about her mother). Hope and Harriet were raised by governesses; one beat the future royal with a coat hanger when she could not remember the Lord\u2019s Prayer. Their grandfather died when Hope was 12, and their grandmother passed away just three years later when Hope was 15.\n\nFrom then, Hope and Harriet lived with their maternal aunt and uncle; the latter was the former US Ambassador to Iran and Peru. Hope studied at both the Chaplin School in New York and the Madeira School in Virginia. She completed her high school education in Iran.\n\nShe chose to continue her studies and head to university. She enrolled at Sarah Lawrence College in 1959 where she majored in Asian Studies. One summer she travelled to India with her later recalling, \u201cI\u2019ve never been so happy \u2026 India! My heart explodes \u2026 The East is my home\u2026\u201d It was in Darjeeling that she met the recently widowed Palden Thondup Namgyal, Crown Prince of Sikkim.\n\nThey became engaged two years later, in 1961, after bonding over what the New York Times called the \u201csimilar isolation of their childhoods.\u201d The couple did not marry until 1963 due to astrologers claiming 1962 was a bad year for marriages.\n\nThe Crown Prince and Hope wed after the latter had renounced her American citizenship, in a Buddhist monastery on 20 March 1963; their ceremony was officiated by 14 lamas \u2013 the title for a high priest in Tibetian Buddhism. Although the wedding was a Buddhist ceremony, Hope never converted from Christianity. However, she was known to have practised Buddhism from an early age.\n\nTogether, they had two children: Prince Palden Gyurmed Namgyal and Princess Hope Leezum Namgyal. Hope gained three stepchildren (Prince Tenzing Kunzang Jigme Namgyal, Prince Tobgyal Wangchuk Tenzing Namgyal and Princess Yangchen Dolma Namgyal) from the union who she adored. She vowed that her children would know happiness and not grow up with the sad family life like both their parents.\n\nJust two years after their nuptials, the Crown Prince was proclaimed Sikkim\u2019s monarch (Chogyal or King) on 4 April 1965. His reign would be short, as he was deposed ten years later on 10 April 1975. He was put under house arrest in the palace. Not long after, Hope and Palden separated with Hope returning with their two children to the United States.\n\nHope later described her ex-husband as a heavy-drinker, sexist and philanderer. He continued his affair that started before he married Hope with a Belgian woman during their marriage. However, she was not innocent as she was also having an affair with an American man.\n\nHer popularity waned with Newsweek even calling her the Himalayan Marie-Antoinette after Sikkim was annexed into India. A US Representative and US Senator co-sponsored a bill to give Hope her American citizenship back, but the bill would not pass until the language was altered to only give her permanent residence status. President Ford signed it in 1976. She and the Chogyal divorced in 1980. He died just two years later of cancer.\n\nIn 1983, she married for a second time to Mike Wallace, but this union did not last. She resided in London for a time, but she eventually returned to the United States. Hope now works as a writer and lecturer and lives in Brooklyn, New York."}, {"url": "https://theprint.in/pageturner/excerpt/when-hope-cooke-the-american-socialite-wife-of-sikkim-king-asked-for-return-of-darjeeling/659102/", "page_content": "On the demise of Tashi Namgyal in 1963, his second son, Palden Thondup Namgyal, took over as the twelfth ruler of the Namgyal dynasty of Sikkim. Thondup was originally slated to be ordained as a Buddhist monk, and was trained as such till he was eleven, having been recognized as a reincarnated Rinpoche. In 1941, he was enthroned as the Maharaja Kumar, replacing his elder brother, Paljor, who died in a plane crash while serving as an officer in the Royal Indian Air Force.\n\nPalden Thondup married twice. His first wife, Samyo Kushoe Sandeki, was from the Tibetan aristocracy and died in 1957. Sandeki was a popular figure in Sikkim and was widely respected by the people. Palden met a young American socialite, Hope Cooke, in Darjeeling and married her in 1963. His coronation as the Maharaja took place on an astrologically determined auspicious date, 4 April 1965, although he had taken over as ruler on 2 December 1963 after his father\u2019s death. The coronation was a grand ceremony, covered by American and European media that were attracted by another American marrying royalty, following the wedding of Hollywood actress, Grace Kelly, with the ruling Prince of Monaco.\n\nAlso read: For over 10 years, this Sikkim man has kept a lake litter-free at 12,406 ft\n\nPalace intrigue\n\nHope Cooke was ambitious and allowed her naivet\u00e9 to overcome the reality of her position as an \u2018outsider\u2019. She was caught early in the web of palace intrigues and shallow politicking. When my wife and I made our first call on the Chogyal and Gyalmo (queen consort), our initial impression of Hope Cooke was of a young person who had adopted the outward poise of Tibetan aristocracy, reducing the soft tones in which Tibetan ladies expressed themselves to a mostly incomprehensible whisper. She obviously did not realize that she was not taken as seriously as she thought she was by senior courtiers. What is more, she was at the receiving end of Palden Thondup\u2019s favourite sister, Princess Pema Tsedeun, also known as Kukula. Kukula was urbane and politically savvier than her brother. There was an immediate clash of personalities between her and Hope Cooke, with each in her own way trying to exert her influence on the ruler.\n\nOur first meeting with the Chogyal\u2014whose request to be addressed as such and not Maharaja had been acceded to by the Indian government\u2014and the Gyalmo took place in an intimate private sitting room at the palace. It was just the four of us around cups of tea and cakes from Calcutta\u2019s Swiss bakery and cafe, Flurys, along with an array of Sikkimese snacks. The Chogyal was his charming self, ready to discuss everything including politics. It was clear to me that he was trying to gauge whether I would be useful to him in the games he indulged in, of sharpening differences between officials of the political office and the political officer.\n\nThe same attempt was also in play where the relations between the political officer and the divisional commander of the 17th Mountain Division, were concerned. Prior to the visit, I had discussed the call with my boss, N.B. Menon, who let me have his insight into the mind of the Chogyal and his ways. I had little difficulty in reading his motives and the ideas that lay behind them. He was intent on creating confusion that he could take advantage of, in order to achieve his political ambition.\n\nAlso read: The sordid underbelly of \u2018golden state\u2019 Sikkim \u2014 it\u2019s India\u2019s suicide capital\n\nI managed to convey, indirectly, that I would not be part of any political game-playing, suggesting that given the norms of protocolary behaviour as first secretary (I was yet to be promoted to that status), I would of course be in touch with his principal secretary, Jigdal Densappa, and the concerned officials at the Sikkim secretariat. Palden Thondup took the hint and soon thereafter arranged for Karma Topden, the son of his political confidante, Martem Topden, a senior politician and legislator from the Sikkim National Party, to be the one to interact with me on political issues. This was, of course, along with Jigdal Densappa, who was Karma\u2019s mentor.\n\nKarma Topden had been trained in intelligence and was part of the so-called Study Group that was the backup in both political and socio-economic spheres to serve the ruler\u2019s ambitions and interests. It was also the think-tank that advised the Chogyal on all matters related to India. Hope Cooke was involved in broader policy formulations that emerged out of the deliberations of the Study Group that had Jigdal as its administrative head. It was this group, along with a set of legal advisors, that fed the Chogyal\u2019s ambitions to the point where he tended to fail to realistically evaluate the possible.\n\nOne of the outcomes of the deliberations of this group, where Hope Cooke had taken the lead, was to resurrect the controversy surrounding the grant of Darjeeling to the East India Company, adding the twist of asking for its return from India. What lay behind this attempt was the supposition that by placing the Indian government under this kind of pressure, it could force Delhi to negotiate a fresh treaty with Sikkim where in return for a settlement on Darjeeling, Sikkim would ask to be treated as an independent state in a special relationship with India.\n\nAlso read: Coercion, not accommodation \u2014 India and China need a new compact for 3,488-km border\n\nExpanding ambition\n\nTo grant credence to this ambition, Hope Cooke published an article in 1967, putting forward the claim that all land within the territory of Sikkim belonged to the ruler in eternity and as such could only be held in trust till he sought its return. She demanded the return of Darjeeling and its surrounds to the kingdom of Sikkim,1 suggesting that this was what her husband was seeking by revoking the trust deed that had granted Darjeeling to the East India Company. This article contributed to the atmosphere of distrust between the Chogyal and the Indian government, and it was felt that Hope Cooke was a \u2018trojan horse\u2019 planted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Sikkim. It was also a wake-up call to the mandarins in South Block, both at the prime minister\u2019s office and the ministry of external affairs.\n\nThe Chogyal was informed in no uncertain terms that this attempt at muddying issues was unacceptable and that his wife was stepping into dangerous waters. Hope Cooke, of course, was also playing to the gallery. By bringing Darjeeling into the Sikkim\u2013India equation, she felt that both the Bhutia and the Gurkha elements of the Nepali population would ensure that they endorsed her husband and his will to get a revision of the Treaty of 1950. In this endeavour she was unsuccessful, as the bulk of the Nepali and many among the Bhutia hierarchy were suspicious of her. This was also part of the palace politics and intrigues let loose by Kukula against her sister-in-law, the Gyalmo.\n\nEven among the top Sikkimese bureaucracy, there were quite a few who resented Hope Cooke\u2019s attempts to interfere and put barriers in the way of their dealings with the palace on matters of administration and policy. This resentment was to reach a climax when a pliant Indian Civil Service officer, I.S. Chopra, was selected by Foreign Secretary T.N. Kaul to take over the post of the principal administrative officer in Gangtok. Chopra, falling under the blandishments of Palden Thondup, accepted the title of \u2018Sidelong\u2019, a Tibetan title equivalent to the designation of \u2018prime minister\u2019. He in turn bent before the Chogyal and Hope Cooke\u2019s wishes to the point where he pressurized the chief secretary to divert plan funds provided by India in favour of projects that benefitted the Bhutia interests adding to the feelings of alienation of the Nepali majority.\n\nI.S. Chopra was unfit for the job entrusted to him. He was protocol-conscious and attempted to undercut N.B. Menon, who may have been junior to him in the foreign service but was the senior interlocutor between Delhi and the Chogyal. P.N. Haksar as the principal secretary to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had no confidence in Chopra, describing him as someone who had \u2018no loyalties to anything and least of all to his own country. But he was a friend of the Foreign Secretary (T.N.Kaul) and has always been a smooth operator. Having become the Dewan of Sikkim, he could not care less what happened to Indo-Sikkimese relations.\u2019"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1976/06/18/archives/hope-cooke-from-queen-of-sikkim-to-regular-new-yorker.html", "page_content": "\u201cI am no longer in a state of suspense,\u201d Mrs. Namgyal said, brushing her short, reddish\u2010brown hair out of her eves. \u201cI know now that we will be able to stay here and we just want to get on with our lives.\u201d\n\nYesterday she was wearing a chocolate\u2010colored T\u2010shirt, white cotton slacks and canvas espadrilles.

That woman was Hope Cooke. It was based on her autobiography.\n\nIt spoke about how the American media was enamoured with an American marrying Crown Prince Palden Thondup Namgyal of Sikkim in 1963. The press always heavily followed any trips of theirs to the United States. Vogue wanted to know her beauty secrets. What the media did not know was that this so-called fairy tale was anything but.\n\nHope Cooke was born on 24 June 1940 in San Francisco, California to John J. Cooke and Hope Noyes. When Hope was not yet two, her mother died in a single person plane crash in 1942. Her father then moved her and her sister, Harriet, to New York City with him to an apartment that was across the hall from their maternal grandparents (who Hope claimed were aloof and refused to talk about her mother). Hope and Harriet were raised by governesses; one beat the future royal with a coat hanger when she could not remember the Lord\u2019s Prayer. Their grandfather died when Hope was 12, and their grandmother passed away just three years later when Hope was 15.\n\nFrom then, Hope and Harriet lived with their maternal aunt and uncle; the latter was the former US Ambassador to Iran and Peru. Hope studied at both the Chaplin School in New York and the Madeira School in Virginia. She completed her high school education in Iran.\n\nShe chose to continue her studies and head to university. She enrolled at Sarah Lawrence College in 1959 where she majored in Asian Studies. One summer she travelled to India with her later recalling, \u201cI\u2019ve never been so happy \u2026 India! My heart explodes \u2026 The East is my home\u2026\u201d It was in Darjeeling that she met the recently widowed Palden Thondup Namgyal, Crown Prince of Sikkim.\n\nThey became engaged two years later, in 1961, after bonding over what the New York Times called the \u201csimilar isolation of their childhoods.\u201d The couple did not marry until 1963 due to astrologers claiming 1962 was a bad year for marriages.\n\nThe Crown Prince and Hope wed after the latter had renounced her American citizenship, in a Buddhist monastery on 20 March 1963; their ceremony was officiated by 14 lamas \u2013 the title for a high priest in Tibetian Buddhism. Although the wedding was a Buddhist ceremony, Hope never converted from Christianity. However, she was known to have practised Buddhism from an early age.\n\nTogether, they had two children: Prince Palden Gyurmed Namgyal and Princess Hope Leezum Namgyal. Hope gained three stepchildren (Prince Tenzing Kunzang Jigme Namgyal, Prince Tobgyal Wangchuk Tenzing Namgyal and Princess Yangchen Dolma Namgyal) from the union who she adored. She vowed that her children would know happiness and not grow up with the sad family life like both their parents.\n\nJust two years after their nuptials, the Crown Prince was proclaimed Sikkim\u2019s monarch (Chogyal or King) on 4 April 1965. His reign would be short, as he was deposed ten years later on 10 April 1975. He was put under house arrest in the palace. Not long after, Hope and Palden separated with Hope returning with their two children to the United States.\n\nHope later described her ex-husband as a heavy-drinker, sexist and philanderer. He continued his affair that started before he married Hope with a Belgian woman during their marriage. However, she was not innocent as she was also having an affair with an American man.\n\nHer popularity waned with Newsweek even calling her the Himalayan Marie-Antoinette after Sikkim was annexed into India. A US Representative and US Senator co-sponsored a bill to give Hope her American citizenship back, but the bill would not pass until the language was altered to only give her permanent residence status. President Ford signed it in 1976. She and the Chogyal divorced in 1980. He died just two years later of cancer.\n\nIn 1983, she married for a second time to Mike Wallace, but this union did not last. She resided in London for a time, but she eventually returned to the United States. Hope now works as a writer and lecturer and lives in Brooklyn, New York."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1976/06/18/archives/hope-cooke-from-queen-of-sikkim-to-regular-new-yorker.html", "page_content": "\u201cI am no longer in a state of suspense,\u201d Mrs. Namgyal said, brushing her short, reddish\u2010brown hair out of her eves. \u201cI know now that we will be able to stay here and we just want to get on with our lives.\u201d\n\nYesterday she was wearing a chocolate\u2010colored T\u2010shirt, white cotton slacks and canvas espadrilles.

Grandfather dies when she's 12, Granny dies three years later. She goes to live with her aunt and uncle, Mary and Selden Chapin, then the ambassador to Iran, and finishes high school there. One summer in her late teens she travels to India: ''I've never been so happy ... India! My heart explodes ... The East is my home ... I must stay near India somehow ...''\n\nHope Cooke is majoring in Asian studies at Sarah Lawrence when she meets the recently widowed Crown Prince of Sikkim in Darjeeling (where, with typical eccentricity, she is taking a course in typing). Two years later they are engaged. The writer immediately hints at the complex pragmatism of this alliance: Her impulse toward him may be inspired by her fascination with Indian spirituality and her desire for some kind of rootedness; his impulse toward her is in part prompted by his need to find a mother for his children. Both are also driven toward each other by the similar isolation of their childhoods. ''Even more than me,'' Hope muses about the Prince's ''Chaplinesque loneliness,'' ''when he was small he had a rather sad life.''\n\nHope Cooke is an exceptionally chaste adventuress who seeks the tamer shores of security rather than the wilder shores of love. She's perhaps more infatuated with the prospect of nesting in her little Oriental palace than she is with the moody king. ''I want a family so much. I want to fill this nest, make it a real home.'' One of the most touching aspects of this story is her delight in recapturing childhood through her affection for her three stepchildren, whom she seems to love quite as much as she will later love her own son and daughter. She exults when her modest (five-bedroom) palace explodes with offspring and the family consumes 12 dozen eggs a week. She has made a fierce resolution to reverse the karma that had saddened her childhood and her husband's.''These children will be happy. The wheel of unhappiness that both my husband and I grew up on will not go to this generation.''\n\nBut the monsters lurking in Hope's fairy tale appear soon after her marriage. The Crown Prince may well have been one of the Far East's most enlightened rulers, as both the author and the historical record confirm: He shaped a model Asian state whose literacy rate and per capita income were twice as high as the neighboring countries of Nepal, Bhutan and India; he retained a measure of independence for a tiny country threatened on two sides, by an India intent on annexation and an equally aggressive Communist-dominated Tibet. Yet, as Hope Cooke describes him, he was also a heavy-drinking philanderer with an odious streak of macho sexism. Notwithstanding his strained finances, the Crown Prince managed to maintain a love affair with a married woman in Belgium before and during his marriage to Hope; he even flew to visit her a few weeks before Hope's first child was born. The lover wrote letters to the Prince on ''crisp rustling paper'' that Hope could hear crinkling in her husband's bathrobe when he hugged her at night. If a letter dropped to the floor, she read it while he went to the altar to perform his Buddhist prayers.\n\nWhen Sikkim's independence was endangered by the death of Nehru, who had carefully preserved Sikkim's autonomy under the terms of a protectorate, the Crown Prince began to drink more and throw temper tantrums. During one such tantrum, he tosses Hope's record player, her ''lifeline to the West,'' out the window. Fairy tale turns to nightmare as Indira Gandhi conspires to deprive Sikkim of the little independence it has. While Hope entertains visiting reporters interested in ''My Thirty Ways of Preparing Yak,'' she is secretly tippling beer in the morning, living on whisky, Valium and cigarettes from noon on. She begins to realize that the manic fervor with which she'd developed Sikkim's cottage industries and helped her husband fight Indian domination is a substitute for a love that barely exists, if it ever existed. On one of her yearly trips to New York, she has an affair with a man who had been a friend during her lonely adolescence, and the memory of this affair haunts her for the rest of her stay in the Far East. She lies in bed more dazed than ever by whisky and Valium, listening to Joan Baez sing freedom songs."}, {"url": "https://satyaagrah.com/history/diary/1337-when-in-a-special-referendum-in-1975-people-of-sikkim-chose-india-over-monarchy-to-become-the-22nd-state-of-the-indian-union-rule-of-the-chogyal-king-and-his-mysterious-american-wife-hope-cooke-ended", "page_content": "Settled in the mountains of the Himalayan range, the state of Sikkim has a very interesting history hardly known by anyone. The state of Sikkim formally became a part of India on April 14, 1975, after the Sikkimese people unitedly demanded the end of the monarchy.\n\nIn a special referendum held in 1975, more than 97% of the electorate ie around 97,000 people had voted for the merger of Sikkim with India. Reportedly, the voter turnout ratio stood at 63 percent then.\n\nBefore 1975, the state of Sikkim was widely known as the \u2018kingdom of Sikkim\u2019 and was ruled by the Chogyal dynasty. Years after Phuntsog Namgyal, the first spiritual king who ruled the state in 1642, the \u2018kingdom of Sikkim\u2019 was handed over to Palden Thondup Namgyal who ruled as king till the year 1975.\n\n\n\nThe 12th Chogyal (King) of Sikkim and his Gyalmo (Queen consort), Hope Cooke, with their daughter, Hope Leezum, watch birthday celebrations in Gangtok, Kingdom of Sikkim\n\nThe Namgyals belonged to the Bhutia community and had first entered India from Tibet in the 14th century. The then king of Sikkim, Palden Thondup Namgyal had an American wife Hope Cooke who became infamous for playing a major role in Namgyal\u2019s resistance to merging Sikkim with India.\n\nCooke had declared the special referendum held in 1975 \u2018illegal and unconstitutional\u2019. But the opinion of the Sikkimese mattered the most to the then Sikkim\u2019s pro-India Chief Minister Kazi Lendup Dorji.\n\nDorji immediately sent the results of the latest election to the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and asked her to accept the decision. The Chogyals also asked the Indian government to take over the administration after the political situation in the state got out of control.\n\nMeanwhile, China who had intentions to expand its territorial boundaries and had long kept an eye on Sikkim accused India of forcefully trying to annex Sikkim. Prime Minister Gandhi in response reminded the Chinese of their \u2018take over\u2019 of Tibet, which borders Sikkim. Gandhi stated that India in the case of Sikkim was only responding to the popular wishes and votes of the Sikkimese.\n\nThe 36th amendment of the Constitution of India in the year 1975 repealed the 35th Amendment i.e., \"2A. Sikkim to be associated with the Union- Sikkim, which comprises the territories specified in the Tenth Schedule, shall be associated with the Union on the terms and conditions set out in that Schedule.\" and made Sikkim the 22nd state of the Indian Union which abolished the monarchy in Sikkim.\n\nThe Chinese administration further accused India of influencing the people of Sikkim to vote for Sikkim\u2019s merger with India and demand an end to the monarchy. This is after the people of Sikkim began to form political parties and protest against Namgyal.\n\nThe Sikkimese aimed to abolish feudalism, establish a popularly elected government, and merge Sikkim with India, all of which were resisted by the Chogyal and his supporters. The Chogyal, who had lost his value as a king later alleged that India had deliberately sent the Indian army to disarm his 400\u2010man army. But the Indian Army was sent to Sikkim to protect the king amid the not-so-good political situation in the state.\n\nWhile China kept on accusing India of influencing the voters in the latest election, the Chogyal said that the referendum should have been conducted by a neutral agency and not by either the Sikkim administration or the Indian Election Commission.\n\nChina also accused India was attempting to illegally access Sikkim by interfering in the election process. It stated that India was upset with Namgyal creating problems for the country after consulting his American wife.\n\nAmerica meanwhile ridiculed China\u2019s accusations and believed that India had no intentions to forcefully annex the state of Sikkim and that the country was just respecting the decision of the people of Sikkim who wanted to be a part of India.\n\nSpeaking geographically, the north-eastern part of the country is of strategic importance as it occupies eight states of India- Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Assam, Tripura, Mizoram, Meghalaya, and Sikkim. To the north of Sikkim lies Tibet, over which China claims its control. To the east of the state is Bhutan, an allied nation of India but China has been trying its best to woo it. To the west of Sikkim is Nepal, the rulers of which incline on both India and China, depending on the situation.\n\n#OnThisDay in 1975 Sikkim officially became 22nd state of India #History pic.twitter.com/1VgcxYU97c \u2014 DD News (@DDNewslive) May 16, 2019\n\nAnother important part of Sikkim\u2019s history lies in understanding the relationship between the British and the state. The kingdom of Sikkim was established in 1642 and since then it had been fighting territorial wars with Bhutan and Nepal.\n\nIn the mid-18th century, the Nepalese had captured a few parts of western Sikkim and the Nepalese largely began to migrate to Sikkim. In 1816 the Nepal-occupied territories were restored to Sikkim by the British in return for its support during the Anglo-Nepalese War. Later in the year 1817, Sikkim signed the Treaty of Title with the British that guaranteed security to the then kingdom of Sikkim.\n\nThe British East India Company and the kingdom of Sikkim further signed the Anglo-Sikkimese Treaty of 1861. The treaty gave Britishers the right to free trade and road making through Sikkim to Tibet.\n\n\n\nAmerican wife Hope Cooke became infamous for playing a major role in Namgyal\u2019s resistance to merging Sikkim with India\n\nIn 1890 an agreement was concluded between the British and the Tibetans that defined the border between Sikkim and Tibet. The Chogyals favoured the Chinese and allegedly allowed China to expand its territory. After the Britishers left, the Sikkimese began protests against the Chogyals. They kept on protesting and reduced the Chogyals to a figurehead monarch. Even today, China continues to stake its claim on a large part of Sikkim and continues to violate international rules.\n\nIt is worth noting that the state of Sikkim became an integral part of India after 28 years of India\u2019s independence. Discussions on the process of its merger with the Republic of India started after the Indo-China war in 1962, in which India had to face defeat.\n\nOne of the reasons for India\u2019s defeat during the Indo-China war is also considered to be the difficulties faced by the Indian Army in the North-East region. The Chogyal of Sikkim was more inclined towards China and the dragon, known for its expansionist character, wanted to capture every state of India adjacent to its border.\n\n#OnThisDay in the year 1975, #Sikkim joined the Indian Union and became India's 22nd State. pic.twitter.com/vyhNs7TngS \u2014 ALL INDIA RADIO \u0906\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0935\u093e\u0923\u0940 (@AkashvaniAIR) April 26, 2017\n\nChina even today continues to possess the same policy, due to which major disputes like the Doklam issue surface on the borders of India and China. Nobody but Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s decision-making ability is to be questioned here as he proposed no clear idea about the northeast policy.\n\nAccording to the reports, the American diplomats based in India also had stated to the State Department of the USA that if Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had accepted the policy proposed by Sardar Vallabbhai Patel, Sikkim would have become a part of India 25 years ago.\n\nAbout Hope Cooke\n\nHope Cooke was born in San Francisco, to an Irish-American father, John J. Cooke, a flight instructor, and Hope Noyes, an amateur pilot.\n\nIn 1959, Cooke was a freshman majoring in Asian Studies at Sarah Lawrence College and sharing an apartment with actress Jane Alexander. She went on a summer trip to India and met Palden Thondup Namgyal, Crown Prince of Sikkim, in the Hotel in Darjeeling, India.\n\nOn March 20, 1963, Cooke married to Namgyal, who soon became the last king of Sikkim, in a Buddhist monastery in a ceremony performed by fourteen lamas. Wedding guests included members of Indian royalty, Indian and Sikkimese generals, and the U.S. Ambassador to India, John Kenneth Galbraith.\n\nBy 1973, both the country and their marriage were crumbling: Sikkim was annexed by India. Five months after the takeover of Sikkim had begun, Cooke returned to the United States.\n\nAmerican Hope Cooke became Queen of Sikkim in 1965, after Prince Namgyal became last King of Sikkim.

Thondup was originally slated to be ordained as a Buddhist monk, and was trained as such till he was eleven, having been recognized as a reincarnated Rinpoche. In 1941, he was enthroned as the Maharaja Kumar, replacing his elder brother, Paljor, who died in a plane crash while serving as an officer in the Royal Indian Air Force.\n\nPalden Thondup married twice. His first wife, Samyo Kushoe Sandeki, was from the Tibetan aristocracy and died in 1957. Sandeki was a popular figure in Sikkim and was widely respected by the people. Palden met a young American socialite, Hope Cooke, in Darjeeling and married her in 1963. His coronation as the Maharaja took place on an astrologically determined auspicious date, 4 April 1965, although he had taken over as ruler on 2 December 1963 after his father\u2019s death. The coronation was a grand ceremony, covered by American and European media that were attracted by another American marrying royalty, following the wedding of Hollywood actress, Grace Kelly, with the ruling Prince of Monaco.\n\nAlso read: For over 10 years, this Sikkim man has kept a lake litter-free at 12,406 ft\n\nPalace intrigue\n\nHope Cooke was ambitious and allowed her naivet\u00e9 to overcome the reality of her position as an \u2018outsider\u2019. She was caught early in the web of palace intrigues and shallow politicking. When my wife and I made our first call on the Chogyal and Gyalmo (queen consort), our initial impression of Hope Cooke was of a young person who had adopted the outward poise of Tibetan aristocracy, reducing the soft tones in which Tibetan ladies expressed themselves to a mostly incomprehensible whisper. She obviously did not realize that she was not taken as seriously as she thought she was by senior courtiers. What is more, she was at the receiving end of Palden Thondup\u2019s favourite sister, Princess Pema Tsedeun, also known as Kukula. Kukula was urbane and politically savvier than her brother. There was an immediate clash of personalities between her and Hope Cooke, with each in her own way trying to exert her influence on the ruler.\n\nOur first meeting with the Chogyal\u2014whose request to be addressed as such and not Maharaja had been acceded to by the Indian government\u2014and the Gyalmo took place in an intimate private sitting room at the palace. It was just the four of us around cups of tea and cakes from Calcutta\u2019s Swiss bakery and cafe, Flurys, along with an array of Sikkimese snacks. The Chogyal was his charming self, ready to discuss everything including politics. It was clear to me that he was trying to gauge whether I would be useful to him in the games he indulged in, of sharpening differences between officials of the political office and the political officer.\n\nThe same attempt was also in play where the relations between the political officer and the divisional commander of the 17th Mountain Division, were concerned. Prior to the visit, I had discussed the call with my boss, N.B. Menon, who let me have his insight into the mind of the Chogyal and his ways. I had little difficulty in reading his motives and the ideas that lay behind them. He was intent on creating confusion that he could take advantage of, in order to achieve his political ambition.\n\nAlso read: The sordid underbelly of \u2018golden state\u2019 Sikkim \u2014 it\u2019s India\u2019s suicide capital\n\nI managed to convey, indirectly, that I would not be part of any political game-playing, suggesting that given the norms of protocolary behaviour as first secretary (I was yet to be promoted to that status), I would of course be in touch with his principal secretary, Jigdal Densappa, and the concerned officials at the Sikkim secretariat. Palden Thondup took the hint and soon thereafter arranged for Karma Topden, the son of his political confidante, Martem Topden, a senior politician and legislator from the Sikkim National Party, to be the one to interact with me on political issues. This was, of course, along with Jigdal Densappa, who was Karma\u2019s mentor.\n\nKarma Topden had been trained in intelligence and was part of the so-called Study Group that was the backup in both political and socio-economic spheres to serve the ruler\u2019s ambitions and interests. It was also the think-tank that advised the Chogyal on all matters related to India. Hope Cooke was involved in broader policy formulations that emerged out of the deliberations of the Study Group that had Jigdal as its administrative head. It was this group, along with a set of legal advisors, that fed the Chogyal\u2019s ambitions to the point where he tended to fail to realistically evaluate the possible.\n\nOne of the outcomes of the deliberations of this group, where Hope Cooke had taken the lead, was to resurrect the controversy surrounding the grant of Darjeeling to the East India Company, adding the twist of asking for its return from India. What lay behind this attempt was the supposition that by placing the Indian government under this kind of pressure, it could force Delhi to negotiate a fresh treaty with Sikkim where in return for a settlement on Darjeeling, Sikkim would ask to be treated as an independent state in a special relationship with India.\n\nAlso read: Coercion, not accommodation \u2014 India and China need a new compact for 3,488-km border\n\nExpanding ambition\n\nTo grant credence to this ambition, Hope Cooke published an article in 1967, putting forward the claim that all land within the territory of Sikkim belonged to the ruler in eternity and as such could only be held in trust till he sought its return. She demanded the return of Darjeeling and its surrounds to the kingdom of Sikkim,1 suggesting that this was what her husband was seeking by revoking the trust deed that had granted Darjeeling to the East India Company. This article contributed to the atmosphere of distrust between the Chogyal and the Indian government, and it was felt that Hope Cooke was a \u2018trojan horse\u2019 planted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Sikkim. It was also a wake-up call to the mandarins in South Block, both at the prime minister\u2019s office and the ministry of external affairs.\n\nThe Chogyal was informed in no uncertain terms that this attempt at muddying issues was unacceptable and that his wife was stepping into dangerous waters. Hope Cooke, of course, was also playing to the gallery. By bringing Darjeeling into the Sikkim\u2013India equation, she felt that both the Bhutia and the Gurkha elements of the Nepali population would ensure that they endorsed her husband and his will to get a revision of the Treaty of 1950. In this endeavour she was unsuccessful, as the bulk of the Nepali and many among the Bhutia hierarchy were suspicious of her. This was also part of the palace politics and intrigues let loose by Kukula against her sister-in-law, the Gyalmo.\n\nEven among the top Sikkimese bureaucracy, there were quite a few who resented Hope Cooke\u2019s attempts to interfere and put barriers in the way of their dealings with the palace on matters of administration and policy. This resentment was to reach a climax when a pliant Indian Civil Service officer, I.S. Chopra, was selected by Foreign Secretary T.N. Kaul to take over the post of the principal administrative officer in Gangtok. Chopra, falling under the blandishments of Palden Thondup, accepted the title of \u2018Sidelong\u2019, a Tibetan title equivalent to the designation of \u2018prime minister\u2019. He in turn bent before the Chogyal and Hope Cooke\u2019s wishes to the point where he pressurized the chief secretary to divert plan funds provided by India in favour of projects that benefitted the Bhutia interests adding to the feelings of alienation of the Nepali majority.\n\nI.S. Chopra was unfit for the job entrusted to him. He was protocol-conscious and attempted to undercut N.B. Menon, who may have been junior to him in the foreign service but was the senior interlocutor between Delhi and the Chogyal. P.N. Haksar as the principal secretary to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had no confidence in Chopra, describing him as someone who had \u2018no loyalties to anything and least of all to his own country. But he was a friend of the Foreign Secretary (T.N.Kaul) and has always been a smooth operator. Having become the Dewan of Sikkim, he could not care less what happened to Indo-Sikkimese relations.\u2019"}, {"url": "https://sundayguardianlive.com/news/book-review-fresh-insight-sikkims-merger-india", "page_content": "The king\u2019s American wife, Hope Cooke did very little to change the perception of her being a CIA agent.

The book, originally published in 1984 and later reprinted in 2013, attempted to shatter the long-held perception that Sikkim\u2019s merger with India was all smooth and hunky-dory.\n\nReading Datta-Ray, a sense of guilt and solecism emerges. It makes us believe that democratic India did to Sikkim in the 1970s what Communist China committed in Tibet in the 1950s\u2014smash and grab. The Indian forces took over the kingdom ruled by a \u201cbenign\u201d and \u201cbenevolent\u201d monarch, Chogyal Palden Thondup Namgyal, who\u2014much like the reader of the book\u2014was utterly bewildered by Delhi\u2019s move. \u201cThey\u2019ve got everything already! What more can India possibly want?\u201d the king would say. Under the 1950 treaty, after all, India controlled Sikkim\u2019s foreign relations, defence and communications, and could also intervene if law and order were threatened or if there was gross internal maladministration.\n\nBut was Thondup as na\u00efve, benign and benevolent as he had been made out to be? Was the merger such a travesty of justice, fair play and, worse, common sense, as Datta-Ray wanted us to believe? If G.B.S. Sidhu\u2019s just released Sikkim: Dawn of Democracy is anything to go by, these assumptions can\u2019t be further than truth. What adds to the book\u2019s credibility is that Sidhu was the head of the three-man RAW team in Gangtok, tasked to raise a united opposition to compel the Chogyal for the merger. The book defends the move, saying it not just \u201cundid the wrong done by India to the people of Sikkim by denying them the right to accede to, and finally merge with, the Union of India\u201d, but also protect its strategic interests in \u201cthis vulnerable and heavily defended sector\u201d along the Sino-Indian border.\n\nIndia no longer, writes Sidhu, had to depend on the whims and fancies, and the growing unpredictability of the Chogyal, who was getting restless\u2014especially after his marriage with Hope Cooke, a young American he had met at a hotel in Darjeeling\u2014to secure an independent status for Sikkim on the lines of neighbouring Bhutan. \u201cImagine the implications of a dissatisfied, sulking or even a revolting Chogyal in the background of a Doklam-like face-off between China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) and the Indian Army, with the Communist Party of China\u2019s People\u2019s Daily publication, Global Times, threatening to incite revolt in Sikkim against India,\u201d the author reminds us.\n\nSidhu\u2019s assessment of the Chogyal is in sharp contrast to that of a \u201cbenign, benevolent\u201d king. \u201cThondup was like a man possessed. He was possessed with the idea of securing independent status for Sikkim, like the one enjoyed by neighbouring Bhutan, whose king was a relative of his.\u201d But in doing so, adds the author, \u201che became totally oblivious to the changed geopolitical realities and India\u2019s security interests in Sikkim.\u201d\n\nOne finds a similar portrayal of the Sikkimese king in Andrew Duff\u2019s account, which seems largely sympathetic to the royalty, but bereft of any romanticism attached. The British journalist, for instance, quotes Henry Kissinger asking one of his staffers, Mr Atherton, why India \u201cannexed\u201d Sikkim. To this Mr Atherton replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think they (India) really wanted to take this last step, until the Chogyal started to assert more authority than he had. And he made some statements at the coronation of the King of Nepal publicly, which upset the Indians.\u201d\n\nDuff mentions several instances of Thondup aggressively seeking an independent identity for Sikkim, despite the geopolitical scenario turning more complex and grim for the Himalayan state, especially since the debacle of 1962. Several local newspapers had also come up in recent years, calling for Sikkim\u2019s independence. Coupled with these, the presence of the king\u2019s American wife must have alarmed the Indian authorities. Hope Cooke, on her part, did very little to change the perception of her being a CIA agent (interestingly, Sidhu disapproves the idea of her being a CIA agent), indulged as she did in cultivating powerful friends in the West, and, worse, she wrote a piece in 1966 arguing that Darjeeling should be returned to Sikkim. These developments, especially in the post-Nehruvian set-up, made Sikkim appear as \u201cthe weakest buckle in the Himalayan belt\u201d.\n\nAlso, to the Chogyal\u2019s disadvantage, Indira Gandhi didn\u2019t have her father\u2019s nostalgia and romanticism associated with the Himalayan state, a notion which had in the past discouraged any democratic opposition to acquire critical mass in Sikkim. Things worsened further when P.N. Haksar and P.N. Dhar became Principal Secretaries and overturned the pro-Chogyal line of Foreign Secretary T.N. Kaul. Till then, writes Sidhu, the word merger was a \u201cvarjit swar\u201d (prohibited word) in the corridors of power.\n\nSidhu, however, concedes that the timing of using a heavy-handed Indian Army operation to disarm the Sikkim Guards was a mistake. The author believes the Foreign Office misread the situation and, in panic, pulled in the Indian Army into action that was highly avoidable. \u201cThe disarming of the Sikkim Guards a day before the Assembly passed the resolutions, made the whole operation look as if it was undertaken to neutralise opposition from within the Sikkim Congress legislature group to the proposed passing of the merger-related resolutions in the Assembly on 10 April, which was far from the truth,\u201d he writes.\n\nThe book is also significant for the fact that it attempts to correct the distorted image of Kazi Lhendup Dorji, the man who successfully led the democratic movement in Sikkim, but got marginalised politically and was later, unfortunately, accused of selling his \u201ccountry\u201d to India. Sidhu, while throwing fresh light on him, concedes that when Kazi was being attacked viciously, no Indian agency or person in authority chose to do anything to neutralise such false and motivated propaganda. Kazi was the real hero of the Sikkim saga, but the nation chose to ignore, worse, forget him.\n\nSidhu, with this book, puts the record straight as far as Sikkim\u2019s merger with India is concerned. There were other books, especially M.K. Dhar\u2019s Open Secrets: India\u2019s Intelligence Unveiled, which in the past challenged the Gangtok-centric narratives, but they lacked the gravitas, originality and even authenticity which Sidhu brings in this volume. Sikkim: Dawn of Democracy offers an incisive insight into how India, 28 years after stupidly thwarting Sikkim\u2019s merger with it, could prevent another Himalayan blunder from happening, just in the nick of time."}]}
