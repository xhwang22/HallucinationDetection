The 19th century virtuoso Niccol\u00f2 Paganini started playing aged seven, while Yehudi Menuhin caused a sensation with his performance, at the same age, of Mendelssohn\u2019s Violin Concerto.\n\nNow, however, there\u2019s a new kid on the block, whose backers say transforms from \u201cnormal child\u201d to \u201cabsolute superstar\u201d the moment the lights dim. Christian Li, a 12-year-old schoolboy violinist from Melbourne, recently became the youngest-ever artist signed by the Decca Classics record label. He will release a new recording later this month, a contemporary adaptation of a traditional Chinese folk tune.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen some amazing young children go on to become great legends,\u201d said Decca\u2019s executive producer, Helen Lewis. \u201cChristian\u2019s joining a long line of wunderkinds\u2026 Menuhin, [Jascha] Heifetz, [Maxim] Vengerov, [Christian\u2019s] hero.\u201d\n\nLewis says she was overwhelmed by Li\u2019s talent when, aged 10, he became the youngest-ever winner of the Menuhin competition, the world\u2019s leading violin competition. The Chinese-Australian was joint winner of its 2018 junior prize, performing Summer from Vivaldi\u2019s Four Seasons, with videos of that performance since attracting millions of views online.\n\n\u201cI was struck by his skill, maturity and musicianship,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cIt\u2019s astonishing to witness. From his physicality, you can tell he\u2019s completely immersed in the music. His interaction and his silent dialogue with the orchestra is really amazing to watch. He has real confidence on stage and leadership of the ensemble\u2026\n\n\u201cLater on, I learned from the Menuhin competition, our friends there, that Christian had formed really lovely friendships with other competitors \u2013 playing about with them backstage. So you really get the impression that, when the stage lights are turned off, he\u2019s just a normal child. Then the lights turn on and he\u2019s an absolute superstar.\u201d\n\nLike Vengerov, one of the most celebrated violinists playing today, Li began learning the violin aged five. He practises for four hours a day during the week, and more at weekends. Otherwise, he loves reading and watching films, particularly science fiction ones, and Harry Potter: when he first visited Decca in London last year he was \u201cextremely excited\u201d about the Harry Potter shop at King\u2019s Cross Station, recalled Lewis.\n\nWe really recognised his ability when he started studying the violin at the age of five Katherine Li\n\n\u201cBut then, in the very next breath, he\u2019s talking about how much he loves the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto, and the ins and outs of the music\u2026 It\u2019s really quite remarkable to hear these sorts of things from someone so young.\u201d\n\nLi\u2019s mother, Katherine Li, said she believed his talents ran in the family.\n\n\u201cAlthough we are not a musical family \u2013 I am a certified practising accountant and my husband, George, is an electronics engineer \u2013 I assume Christian inherited his grandfather\u2019s gift for music,\u201d she told the Observer. \u201cHe has a very good ear, good musical memory and shows great passion for music. We really recognised his ability when he started studying violin at the age of five. His first few music teachers were constantly surprised by his talent.\u201d\n\nOn May 22 Decca Classics will release Li\u2019s recording of the Fisherman\u2019s Harvest Song, a traditional folk tune inspired by the fisherman\u2019s harvest in the South China Sea and adapted by contemporary Chinese composer Li Zili.\n\nLi said: \u201cI chose this piece because it connects me to my Chinese heritage through music. The beautiful melody in the opening expresses the fisherman\u2019s strong emotion as he returns to his village after being at sea. I love being able to express this heartfelt song through the singing quality of the violin.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love playing in front of people,\u201d he added.\n\nLewis praised Li\u2019s technical dexterity when performing works such as the fiendishly difficult La Ronde des Lutins (Dance of the Goblins), by the Italian composer and violinist Antonio Bazzini, which Decca released in March to announce his signing.\n\nShe said: \u201cIt requires all manner of techniques. He\u2019s got an extraordinary accomplishment of all the techniques\u2026 [and] he just infuses it with light, colour and vitality. That\u2019s what sets him apart. You compare that recording with the long list of greats who\u2019ve recorded that piece and he\u2019s really up there with the best.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.euyo.eu/about/players/members/", "page_content": "Trombone\n\nMateusz Markiewicz was born in 2002 in Szczecinek, Poland.

By age five, he had already composed his first piece of music. As a child, he mastered the piano, along with several other instruments including the violin, organ and harpsichord. By all accounts, he was a child prodigy. But he was far from the only composer to have a head start: Ludwig van Beethoven, Martha Argerich, Vincenzo Bellini, Claudio Arrau, and many of history\u2019s greatest musicians all began their training in early childhood and went on to wow the world.\n\nThe success of these musicians raises the question: Do you need to start early to be great? Many of us assume that the younger we start, the better our chances of becoming the best. Certain research backs up this claim. Some psychologists have even suggested that there may be a key period in early childhood when we have a particularly powerful capacity to absorb musical aptitude. According to this view, if you wait until your teens or even early adulthood to begin your training, you will have missed a critical window.\n\nYet a new study by Laura Wesseldijk of Vrije University Amsterdam and her colleagues challenges this view: It explores the possibility that environmental and familial factors are the driving forces behind the success of \u201cearly starters.\u201d Such individuals may have an edge not because they learn in a developmentally unique period but because they inherit talent, have access to instruments and instruction, or get a head start on practice. So it is possible that starting late might not prevent you from becoming great.\n\nWhen comparing early starters to late bloomers, one critical factor to consider is total practice time. We know that practice matters because it can take thousands of hours to achieve expertise. Any study seeking to isolate the benefits of early exposure has to match training time for those who start early versus late in life. But there is a challenge in matching total training time: late bloomers with extensive practice tend to be much older than early starters with the same practice. Given that some kinds of cognitive performance often start to decline in early adulthood, comparing old late bloomers to young early starters could inflate the advantages of beginning young.\n\nTo add to the challenge, practice time and age are not the only factors to consider. Imagine you are the child of a concert pianist. It is possible that some aspects of musical talent have a genetic component, and if so, you may have inherited a predisposition to excel musically. Even if you did not, you are raised in a musically-enriched environment, with a piano in your home and a parent who plays regularly. Either your natural talent or your experience, or both, may lead you to begin banging on the piano keys as a toddler. Lucky for you, you have a parent with the knowledge and expertise to nurture that interest. You are indeed an early starter, but you also have familial and environmental advantages that could accelerate your musical development.\n\nWesseldijk and her colleagues explored the effect of these familial and environmental influences by assessing musical aptitude and expertise in two independent populations\u2014professional musicians and adult twins with musical experience. By including professional musicians, the researchers assessed aptitude and expertise in a cohort of highly trained, active experts who had begun their training at varying ages (from age two to 18). Through studying identical twins, the researchers could examine differences in aptitude and expertise for pairs of individuals who shared the same familial environment and genetic predispositions but may have started their training at different times.\n\nMore than 300 musicians and 7,000 twins participated in the study, and they ranged in age from 27 to 54. The musicians selected were still active in the field, and each of the twins had received musical training at some point in their lives. Participants reported the age at which they started to play and the hours they practiced each week during different age intervals (for example, six to 11 years and 12 to 17 years). Using this information, the researchers estimated the age of onset of training and accumulated practice for each participant. Participants also completed two online assessments: one for musical aptitude and the other for musical achievement. The aptitude test measured the basic musical skills of pitch, melody and rhythm discrimination. The achievement test evaluated different metrics of musical success, including the body of composed and performed works, number of awards, national and international reviews, and pieces featured in public performances.\n\nThe team\u2019s findings suggest that early starters do not benefit from a critical developmental window for cultivating skill and expertise but rather from additional hours of practice, the experience of growing up in a musically engaged family and perhaps even a genetic predisposition for musical prowess. They first examined the relation between starting early and later musical aptitude and achievement in both the musician and twin samples, controlling for total practice time. In this analysis, an earlier start in musical training was associated with higher scores on some aptitude measures but not higher musical achievement. In other words, when total practice was held constant, individuals who were exposed to music at an early age showed higher scores on the basic skill of pitch discrimination\u2014yet they were no more likely than late bloomers to have their music played on the radio or in public concerts, to win awards, or to receive national or international reviews.\n\nTo understand the contribution that genes and environment play in musical prowess, researchers turned to the twin data. Researchers estimated genetic and environmental factors by comparing identical twins to each other, to fraternal twins (who share only 50% of their genes on average), and to experienced musicians in the general population. If there is no genetic component to musical talent, then the data from identical twin pairs should be similar to data from fraternal twin pairs. Similarly, if familial environment has no influence on musical success, then data for twins reared together should look the same as data for unrelated musicians. Not surprisingly, the findings suggest that heredity and environment do contribute to musical aptitude and achievement. When the researchers further controlled for these genetic and environmental influences, an early start was no longer predictive of musical aptitude. Put simply: the early starters didn\u2019t score higher on the aptitude tests because they began their training earlier but because of genetic and environmental factors that gave them an edge. Children who have a natural talent for music and/or a musically gifted parent are more likely to be exposed to music at an early age and have their talent nurtured. These factors explain the advantage that early starters have over late bloomers with respect to musical skill.\n\nSo we can all take a breath and relax if we (or our children) failed to start playing a musical instrument by the age of five. You didn\u2019t miss the window because, as the findings demonstrate, no such window exists. If your passion for the piano emerges in your teens or even in adulthood, you are not destined for mediocrity. Those of us learning to play later in life can still aspire to greatness, just as Bill Withers, who began his musical career in his late 20s, still managed to write and produce award-winning music and to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. That said, one essential ingredient in the recipe for success is practice. If you don\u2019t get an early start, you may need to stay up late, putting in the hours\u2014practice makes perfect."}, {"url": "https://www.classicfm.com/artists/andre-rieu/pictures/andre-rieu-facts/childhood/", "page_content": "Andr\u00e9 Rieu's Stradivarius violin\n\nThis image appears in the gallery:\n\nAndr\u00e9 Rieu: Concerts, wife, net worth and more facts about the violinist"}, {"url": "https://www.asmf.org/musician-profiles/", "page_content": "Tomo Keller was born in Stuttgart to German-Japanese musicians and started playing the violin at the age of six.

Dr. Suzuki developed a specific strategy for teaching children to play the violin that is known today as the \u201cSuzuki method\u201d (Bugeja 22). This method is based on Suzuki\u2019s philosophy, according to which the ability to learn how to play the musical instrument is not influenced by the talent as the inherited feature. According to Dr. Suzuki, the time when a child begins to play the violin is of the high importance (Wade 24). Thus, the \u201cSuzuki method\u201d is based on the claim that children can learn to play musical instruments as they learn to speak. In this case, the basic aspects of the successful teaching are the listening to the music, the constant repetition of music elements while playing, and the parents\u2019 support (Suzuki 9). Therefore, according to Dr. Suzuki, any child can learn to play the musical instrument if he or she is encouraged and loved; supported by parents and the peers; focused on the constant practice, repetition, and the technique development; and listening to the music regularly.\n\nSuzuki\u2019s philosophy and the teaching method are grounded on three main conditions. All these factors are important to support the main idea that the talent of a musician needs to be actively evolved. The first aspect is the children\u2019s age. According to Dr. Suzuki, to develop the playing technique, children need to start learning early, at the age of three or five years (Trainor 263). This condition depends on Dr. Suzuki\u2019s \u201cmother-tongue approach\u201d and an assumption that a child can learn to play the violin similar to the process of language acquisition (Comeau 60). In this context, the second key aspect is the daily listening to music. As children constantly hear the language they speak, they also need to hear the music they play. The third important principle that also comes from the theory of the language acquisition is the regular practice based on repeating small pieces and musical elements (Mehl 14). Hearing his or her parents speaking, a child learns words one by one, and their repetition contributes to the development of the skills and mastery. The repetition of musical pieces and elements many times contributes to the children\u2019s development of their repertoire. In Nurtured by Love, Dr. Suzuki stated that at this stage, children need to demonstrate their patience to see actual results in the future (Suzuki 6). However, more attention needs to be paid to the environments in which a child studies.\n\nThe focus on the environments for the teaching of playing the violin is significant because Dr. Suzuki developed the idea of cooperation within the beneficial setting. First, much attention is paid to the \u201ctriangle\u201d of a child, a teacher, and a parent in the process of learning the music (Comeau 60). This cooperation depends on the following premises: the teacher acts as a master in playing the violin, the child is loved and encouraged, and the parent is supportive and actively involved in the process of teaching (Suzuki 22). Therefore, the teacher stimulates a child to practice daily and listen to the high-quality music regularly. In his turn, a parent attends the classes and studies with a child. During the early childhood, this experience is important for a young person to feel the support and love (Trainor 264). In addition, it is expected that children play together in groups once a week to demonstrate their successes, but without the unnecessary competition and the focus on grades. In this approach, Dr. Suzuki realizes the idea of the true cooperation within the specific musical community (Wade 14). As a result, the persons involved in the process of teaching, including other children, create the positive environment for a child to study with pleasure and develop the mastery, and these outcomes are associated with the main objectives of the \u201cSuzuki method\u201d.\n\nThe teaching goals of Dr. Suzuki differ significantly from the traditional ones followed in the musical education. The main aim of teaching children according to the \u201cSuzuki method\u201d is to develop their musical abilities and their personality. Dr. Suzuki claimed that he did not intend to educate future professional musicians, but the main goal is to nurture children to grow and develop as good persons with the love in their hearts (Suzuki 20). While listening to the high-quality music daily and while developing the skills in playing the violin, a child develops sensitivity, patience, discipline, and his inner abilities. In addition, being taught in the community of the cooperated teacher, parents, and other students, a child develops his skills in respecting the other person. As a result, a child grows as a good person with the loving heart.\n\nIn spite of the fact that Dr. Suzuki\u2019s teaching philosophy and approach are often discussed as provocative, they are followed not only in Japan but also in the Western countries. The main reason for attracting many parents and children to the \u201cSuzuki method\u201d is the development of a child\u2019s abilities and skills in playing the violin with the focus on developing him or her as a personality. Therefore, this approach is actively used for the musical education of three- or five-year-old children.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBugeja, Clare. \u201cParental Involvement in the Musical Education of Violin Students: Suzuki and \u201cTraditional\u201d Approaches Compared.\u201d Australian Journal of Music Education 1.2 (2009): 19-28.

Over the years, Mozart aligned himself with a variety of European venues and patrons, composing hundreds of works that included sonatas, symphonies, masses, chamber music, concertos and operas, marked by vivid emotion and sophisticated textures.\n\nEarly Life\n\nCentral Europe in the mid-18th century was going through a period of transition. The remnants of the Holy Roman Empire had divided into small semi-self-governing principalities. The result was competing rivalries between these municipalities for identity and recognition. Political leadership of small city-states like Salzburg, Vienna, and Prague was in the hands of the aristocracy and their wealth would commission artists and musicians to amuse, inspire, and entertain. The music of the Renaissance and Baroque periods was transitioning toward more full-bodied compositions with complex instrumentation. The small city-state of Salzburg would be the birthplace of one of the most talented and prodigious musical composers of all time.\n\nBorn on January 27, 1756, in Salzburg, Austria, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\u2019s was the sole-surviving son of Leopold and Maria Pertl Mozart. Leopold was a successful composer, violinist, and assistant concert master at the Salzburg court. Wolfgang\u2019s mother, Anna Maria Pertl, was born to a middle class family of local community leaders. His only sister was Maria Anna (nicknamed \u201cNannerl\u201d). With their father\u2019s encouragement and guidance, they both were introduced to music at an early age. Leopold started Nannerl on keyboard when she was seven, as three-year old Wolfgang looked on. Mimicking her playing, Wolfgang quickly began to show a strong understanding of chords, tonality, and tempo. Soon, he too was being tutored by his father.\n\nLeopold was a devoted and task-oriented teacher to both his children. He made the lessons fun, but also insisted on a strong work ethic and perfection. Fortunately, both children excelled well in these areas. Recognizing their special talents, Leopold devoted much of his time to their education in music as well as other subjects. Wolfgang soon showed signs of excelling beyond his father\u2019s teachings with an early composition at age five and demonstrating outstanding ability on harpsichord and the violin. He would soon go on to play the piano, organ and viola.\n\nIn 1762, Mozart\u2019s father took Nannerl, now age eleven, and Wolfgang, age six to the court of Bavaria in Munich in what was to become the first of several European \"tours.\" The siblings traveled to the courts of Paris, London, The Hague, and Zurich performing as child prodigies. Mozart met a number of accomplished musicians and became familiar with their works. Particularity important was his meeting with Johann Christian Bach (Johann Sebastian Bach's youngest son) in London who had a strong influence on Mozart. The trips were long and often arduous, traveling in primitive conditions and waiting for invitations and reimbursements from the nobility. Frequently, Mozart and other members of his family fell seriously ill and had to limit their performance schedule.\n\nBudding Young Composer\n\nIn December 1769, Mozart, then age 13, and his father departed from Salzburg for Italy, leaving his mother and sister at home. It seems that by this time Nannerl\u2019s professional music career was over. She was nearing marriageable age and according to the custom of the time, she was no longer permitted to show her artistic talent in public. The Italian outing was longer than the others (1769-1771) as Leopold wanted to display his son\u2019s abilities as a performer and composer to as many new audiences as possible. While in Rome, Mozart heard Gregorio Allegri\u2019s Miserere performed once in the Sistine Chapel. He wrote out the entire score from memory, returning only to correct a few minor errors. During this time Mozart also wrote a new opera, Mitridate, re di Ponto for the court of Milan. Other commissions followed and in subsequent trips to Italy, Mozart wrote two other operas, Ascanio in Alba (1771) and Lucio Silla (1772).\n\nMozart and his father returned from their last stay in Italy in March 1773. His father\u2019s benefactor, Archbishop von Schrattenbach had died and was succeeded by Hieronymus von Colleredo. Upon their return, the new archbishop appointed young Mozart as assistant concertmaster with a small salary. During this time, young Mozart had the opportunity to work in several different musical genres composing symphonies, string quartets, sonatas and serenades and a few operas. He developed a passion for violin concertos producing what came to be the only five he wrote. In 1776, he turned his efforts toward piano concertos, culminating in the Piano Concerto Number 9 in E flat major in early 1777. Mozart had just turned 21.\n\nDespite his success with the compositions, Mozart was growing discontent with his position as assistant concert master and the confining environment of Salzburg. He was ambitious and believed he could do more somewhere else. Archbishop von Colloredo was becoming impatient with the young genius\u2019s complaining and immature attitude. In August 1777, Mozart set out on a trip to find more prosperous employment. The archbishop wouldn\u2019t give Leopold permission to travel, so Anna Maria accompanied Wolfgang on his quest to the cities of Mannheim, Paris and Munich. There were several employment positions that initially proved promising, but all eventually fell through. He began to run out of funds and had to pawn several valuable personal items to pay traveling and living expenses. The lowest point of the trip was when his mother fell ill and died on July 3, 1778. After hearing the news of his wife\u2019s death, Leopold negotiated a better post for his son as court organist in Salzburg and Wolfgang returned soon after.\n\nMaking it in Vienna\n\nBack in Salzburg in 1779, Mozart produced a series of church works, including the Coronation Mass. He also composed another opera for Munich, Idomeneo in 1781. In March of that year, Mozart was summoned to Vienna by Archbishop von Colloredo, who was attending the accession of Joseph II to the Austrian throne. The Archbishop\u2019s cool reception toward Mozart offended him. He was treated as a mere servant, quartered with the help, and forbidden from performing before the Emperor for a fee equal to half his yearly salary in Salzburg. A quarrel ensued and Mozart offered to resign his post. The Archbishop refused at first, but then relented with an abrupt dismissal and physical removal from the Archbishop\u2019s presence. Mozart decided to settle in Vienna as a freelance performer and composer and for a time lived with friends at the home of Fridolin Weber.\n\nMozart quickly found work in Vienna, taking on pupils, writing music for publication, and playing in several concerts. He also began writing an opera Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail (The Abduction from the Seraglio). In the summer of 1781, it was rumored that Mozart was contemplating marriage to Fridolin Weber\u2019s daughter, Constanze. Knowing his father would disapprove of the marriage and the interruption in his career, young Mozart quickly wrote his father denying any idea of marriage. But by December, he was asking for his father\u2019s blessings. While it\u2019s known that Leopold disapproved, what is not known is the discussion between father and son as Leopold\u2019s letters were said to be destroyed by Constanze. However, later correspondence from Mozart indicated that he and his father disagreed considerably on this matter. He was in love with Constanze and the marriage was being strongly encouraged by her mother, so in some sense, he felt committed. The couple was finally married on August 4, 1782. In the meantime, Leopold did finally consent to the marriage. Constanze and Mozart had six children, though only two survived infancy, Karl Thomas and Franz Xaver.\n\nAs 1782 turned to 1783, Mozart became enthralled with the work of Bach and George Frederic Handel and this, in turn, resulted in several compositions in the Baroque style and influenced much of his later compositions, such as passages in Die Zauberflote (The Magic Flute) and the finale of Symphony Number 41. During this time, Mozart met Joseph Haydn and the two composers became admiring friends. When Haydn visited Vienna, they sometimes performed impromptu concerts with string quartets. Between 1782 and 1785 Mozart wrote six quartets dedicated to Haydn.\n\nEuropean Fame\n\nThe opera Die Entf\u00fchrung enjoyed immediate and continuing success and bolstered Mozart\u2019s name and talent throughout Europe. With the substantial returns from concerts and publishing, he and Constanze enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. They lived in one of the more exclusive apartment buildings of Vienna, sent their son, Karl Thomas, to an expensive boarding school, kept servants, and maintained a busy social life. In 1783, Mozart and Constanze traveled to Salzburg to visit his father and sister. The visit was somewhat cool, as Leopold was still a reluctant father-in-law and Nannerl was a dutiful daughter. But the stay promoted Mozart to begin writing a mass in C Minor, of which only the first two sections, \"Kyrie\" and \"Gloria,\" were completed. In 1784, Mozart became a Freemason, a fraternal order focused on charitable work, moral uprightness, and the development of fraternal friendship. Mozart was well regarded in the Freemason community, attending meetings and being involved in various functions. Freemasonry also became a strong influence in Mozart\u2019s music.\n\nFrom 1782 to 1785, Mozart divided his time between self-produced concerts as soloist, presenting three to four new piano concertos in each season. Theater space for rent in Vienna was sometimes hard to come by, so Mozart booked himself in unconventional venues such as large rooms in apartment buildings and ballrooms of expensive restaurants. The year 1784, proved the most prolific in Mozart\u2019s performance life. During one five-week period, he appeared in 22 concerts, including five he produced and performed as the soloist. In a typical concert, he would play a selection of existing and improvisational pieces and his various piano concertos. Other times he would conduct performances of his symphonies. The concerts were very well attended as Mozart enjoyed a unique connection with his audiences who were, in the words of Mozart biographer Maynard Solomon, \u201cgiven the opportunity of witnessing the transformation and perfection of a major musical genre.\u201d During this time, Mozart also began to keep a catalog of his own music, perhaps indicating an awareness of his place in musical history.\n\nBy the mid-1780s, Wolfgang and Constanze Mozart\u2019s extravagant lifestyle was beginning to take its toll. Despite his success as a pianist and composer, Mozart was falling into serious financial difficulties. Mozart associated himself with aristocratic Europeans and felt he should live like one. He figured that the best way to attain a more stable and lucrative income would be through court appointment. However, this wouldn\u2019t be easy with the court\u2019s musical preference bent toward Italian composers and the influence of Kapellmeister Antonio Salieri. Mozart\u2019s relationship with Salieri has been the subject of speculation and legend. Letters written between Mozart and his father, Leopold, indicate that the two felt a rivalry for and mistrust of the Italian musicians in general and Salieri in particular. Decades after Mozart\u2019s death, rumors spread that Salieri had poisoned him. This rumor was made famous in 20th-century playwright Peter Shaffer\u2019s Amadeus and in the 1984 film of the same name by director Milos Foreman. But in truth, there is no basis for this speculation. Though both composers were often in contention for the same job and public attention, there is little evidence that their relationship was anything beyond a typical professional rivalry. Both admired each other\u2019s work and at one point even collaborated on a cantata for voice and piano called Per la recuperate salute di Ophelia.\n\nWolfgang Mozart Photo: Universal History Archive/Getty Images\n\nToward the end of 1785, Mozart met the librettist Lorenzo Da Ponte, a Venetian composer and poet and together they collaborated on the opera The Marriage of Figaro. It received a successful premiere in Vienna in 1786 and was even more warmly received in Prague later that year. This triumph led to a second collaboration with Da Ponte on the opera Don Giovanni which premiered in 1787 to high acclaim in Prague. Noted for their musical complexity, the two operas are among Mozart\u2019s most important works and are mainstays in operatic repertoire today. Both compositions feature the wicked nobleman, though Figaro is presented more in comedy and portrays strong social tension. Perhaps the central achievement of both operas lies in their ensembles with their close link between music and dramatic meaning.\n\nLater Years\n\nIn December 1787, Emperor Joseph II appointed Mozart as his \"chamber composer,\" a post that had opened up with the death of Gluck. The gesture was as much an honor bestowed on Mozart as it was an incentive to keep the esteemed composer from leaving Vienna for greener pastures. It was a part-time appointment with low pay, but it required Mozart only to compose dances for the annual balls. The modest income was a welcome windfall for Mozart, who was struggling with debt, and provided him the freedom to explore more of his personal musical ambitions.\n\nToward the end of the 1780s, Mozart\u2019s fortunes began to grow worse. He was performing less and his income shrank. Austria was at war and both the affluence of the nation and the ability of the aristocracy to support the arts had declined. By mid-1788, Mozart moved his family from central Vienna to the suburb of Alsergrund, for what would seem to be a way of reducing living costs. But in reality, his family expenses remained high and the new dwelling only provided more room. Mozart began to borrow money from friends, though he was almost always able to promptly repay when a commission or concert came his way. During this time he wrote his last three symphonies and the last of the three Da Ponte operas, Cosi Fan Tutte, which premiered in 1790. During this time, Mozart ventured long distances from Vienna to Leipzig, Berlin, and Frankfurt, and other German cities hoping to revive his once great success and the family\u2019s financial situation but did neither. The two-year period of 1788-1789 was a low point for Mozart, experiencing in his own words \"black thoughts\" and deep depression. Historians believe he may have had some form of bipolar disorder, which might explain the periods of hysteria coupled with spells of hectic creativity.\n\nBetween 1790 and 1791, now in his mid-thirties, Mozart went through a period of great music productivity and personal healing. Some of his most admired works -- the opera The Magic Flute, the final piano concerto in B-flat, the Clarinet Concerto in A major, and the unfinished Requiem to name a few -- were written during this time. Mozart was able to revive much of his public notoriety with repeated performances of his works. His financial situation began to improve as wealthy patrons in Hungary and Amsterdam pledged annuities in return for occasional compositions. From this turn of fortune, he was able to pay off many of his debts.\n\nHowever, during this time both Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\u2019s mental and physical health was deteriorating. In September 1791, he was in Prague for the premiere of the opera La Clemenza di Tito, which he was commissioned to produce for the coronation of Leopold II as King of Bohemia. Mozart recovered briefly to conduct the Prague premiere of The Magic Flute, but fell deeper into illness in November and was confined to bed. Constanze and her sister Sophie came to his side to help nurse him back to health, but Mozart was mentally preoccupied with finishing Requiem, and their efforts were in vain.\n\nDeath and Legacy\n\nMozart died on December 5, 1791, at age 35. The cause of death is uncertain, due to the limits of postmortem diagnosis. Officially, the record lists the cause as severe miliary fever, referring to a skin rash that looks like millet seeds. Since then, many hypotheses have circulated regarding Mozart's death. Some have attributed it to rheumatic fever, a disease he suffered from repeatedly throughout his life. It was reported that his funeral drew few mourners and he was buried in a common grave. Both actions were the Viennese custom at the time, for only aristocrats and nobility enjoyed public mourning and were allowed to be buried in marked graves. However, his memorial services and concerts in Vienna and Prague were well attended. After his death, Constanze sold many of his unpublished manuscripts to undoubtedly pay off the family\u2019s large debts. She was able to obtain a pension from the emperor and organized several profitable memorial concerts in Mozart\u2019s honor. From these efforts, Constanze was able to gain some financial security for herself and allowing her to send her children to private schools.\n\nMozart\u2019s death came at a young age, even for the time period. Yet his meteoric rise to fame and accomplishment at a very early age is reminiscent of more contemporary musical artists whose star had burned out way too soon. At the time of his death, Mozart was considered one of the greatest composers of all time. His music presented a bold expression, oftentimes complex and dissonant, and required high technical mastery from the musicians who performed it. His works remained secure and popular throughout the 19th century, as biographies about him were written and his music enjoyed constant performances and renditions by other musicians. His work influenced many composers that followed -- most notably Beethoven. Along with his friend Joseph Haydn, Mozart conceived and perfected the grand forms of symphony, opera, string ensemble, and concerto that marked the classical period. In particular, his operas display an uncanny psychological insight, unique to music at the time, and continue to exert a particular fascination for musicians and music lovers today.\n\nLudwig van Beethoven\n\n\"],[\"\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach\n\n\"],[\"\n\nFranz Joseph Haydn\n\n\"],[\"\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin\n\n\"],[\"\n\nGeorge Frideric Handel\n\n\"]]\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\">\n\nVideos\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Wolfgang Mozart\n\nBirth Year: 1756\n\nBirth date: January 27, 1756\n\nBirth City: Salzburg\n\nBirth Country: Austria\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: A prolific artist, Austrian composer Wolfgang Mozart created a string of operas, concertos, symphonies and sonatas that profoundly shaped classical music.\n\nIndustries\n\nClassical\n\nAstrological Sign: Aquarius\n\nNacionalities\n\nAustrian\n\nDeath Year: 1791\n\nDeath date: December 5, 1791\n\nDeath City: Vienna\n\nDeath Country: Austria\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION\n\nArticle Title: Wolfgang Mozart Biography\n\nAuthor: Biography.com Editors\n\nWebsite Name: The Biography.com website\n\nUrl: https://www.biography.com/musicians/wolfgang-mozart\n\nAccess Date:\n\nPublisher: A&E; Television Networks\n\nLast Updated: September 16, 2022\n\nOriginal Published Date: April 3, 2014\n\nQUOTES"}, {"url": "https://www.violinist.com/blog/laurie/202111/28991/", "page_content": "V.com weekend vote: At what age did you start playing the violin?\n\nRecently I read an article by Daniel Kurganov, about how he started playing the violin when he was 16 years old.

As a result, singing is deeply anchored in the Faroese national identity and the Faroese people simply cannot stop singing.\n\nToday, however, the voice no longer stands alone, and the instrumental variations and creations have no ending.\n\nBUZZING MUSIC. The music scene on the Faroe Islands is buzzing. Artists and creators across all genres are delivering world class performances and recordings. Teitur and Eiv\u00f8r are undoubtedly among the best known Faroese artists on the international stage. Their respective careers span over more than a decade and both enjoy international acclaim. On the local stage we have a multitude of acts making a name for themselves, including the funky pop band Byrta and the gifted artist Heidrik. The metal scene is also alive and well. The Viking Metal band T\u00fdr has a successful career in Europe and the charismatic dark doom metal band Hamfer\u00f0 is knocking on new doors. Two new artists within alternative music are singer, songwriter, theatre composer and actor Budam and the avant-garde Orka, who have wowed media and audiences across Europe.\n\nISLAND JAZZ. Since the foundation of the local Jazz Club in 1975 the Faroe Islands jazz scene has been active and a few bars the Faroe Islands still have nights dedicated to live jazz and blues music. Current artists include Yggdrasil, a cross-national collaboration lead by Kristian Blak, the founder and owner of TUTL, which is the largest record company in the Faroe Islands. TUTL is collectively owned by musicians and composers, who have released their music through the label, and is unique amongst labels as it emphasises total artistic freedom. The TUTL shop in T\u00f3rshavn is the only music store in the world that is dedicated to Faroese music. Other jazz artists include Magnus Johannesen, who is best known for his lyrical playing and melodic perspective and in recent years Magnus has emerged as a very capable composer and orchestrator.\n\nCONTEMPORARY COMPOSITION. The Faroe Islands have a rich pool of active contemporary music composers. Sunleif Rasmussen is the most internationally acclaimed. Kristian Blak, Tr\u00f3ndur Bogason, Atli Petersen and K\u00e1ri B\u00e6k are all among composers with regular commissions from local and international artists. The instrumental ensemble Aldub\u00e1ran is dedicated to performing and promoting Faroese music. They have recorded several albums with music made by Faroese composers and regularly tour across Europe with a Faroese repertoire.\n\nMUSIC ALIVE. The thriving live music scene on the islands is taking people by surprise, and creating awe amongst visitors. Live music events, in all genres, take place all year round in many different and fascinating venues. The largest venue is the Nordic House in T\u00f3rshavn, which has been an active contributor to the music scene on the Faroe Islands since 1983. Every year this prime venue offers high-quality performances from around the world. There is also a great cultural house in Fuglafj\u00f8r\u00f0ur. In 2013, an old building in the centre of T\u00f3rshavn, called Reinsar\u00edi\u00f0, was renovated to house a growing number of live music events, and today, Reinsar\u00edi\u00f0 is booked almost every week. On a smaller scale, TUTL, the record company, offers weekly free concerts in their shop in T\u00f3rshavn city centre and numerous smaller venues regularly promote live music. Grottoes offer the most amazing acoustics and are also used as stages for live music.\n\nMUSIC FESTIVALS. The summer season on the Faroe Islands is full of music festivals. In July there is the G! Festival in G\u00f8tu. \u201cThe most curious place left on earth\u201d New York Times stated after attending a G! Festival and the Guardian claimed it as \"probably the wildest event on the festival calendar\". The live music scene on the Faroe Islands is indeed curious and wild, and the G! Festival has, without a doubt, brought the world's attention to Faroese music. In August there is the popular Summer Festival in Klaksv\u00edk on the Northern Islands. The Summer Festival is more of a well-rounded and community friendly festival and attracts thousands of happy festival-goers every year.\n\nOther annual festivals in the Faroe Islands include Fjar\u00f0afestivalurin, a Christian music festival, S\u00f8rv\u00e1gs Country & Blues Festivalur and Summart\u00f3nar, a festival for classical and contemporary music, including Jazz and experimental. There are also a few day-long musical events, such as Voxbotn, T\u00f3rsfest and Vi\u00f0 Br\u00fanna, featuring both local and international artists. The Faroe Islands also host what is probably the smallest Folk music festival in the world \u2013 sometimes described as \u201cthe hidden festival\u201d as it primarily promoted by word of mouth. The latest festival news is the Winter Jazz Days taking place during the cold dark winter months of January and February.\n\nCOMPLETE SYMPHONY. Against all odds, and with a population of only approximately 50.000, the Faroe Islands have managed to put together its very own symphony orchestra. Conductor of the Faroe Islands Symphony Orchestra is Mr. Bernhar\u00f0ur Wilkinson and the orchestra is made up of a mixture of accomplished students and professional musicians, all of whom are teachers in the Faroese Music School. The orchestra also includes talented amateurs and Faroese people that are pursuing musical educations abroad. The orchestra is sometimes further strengthened by professional musicians from abroad.\n\nThe rich singing traditions are manifested in the many choirs in the Faroe Islands. The T\u00f3rshavn Choir was founded by \u00d3lavur H\u00e1t\u00fan, pioneer and choirmaster, and in 2011 the choir celebrated 45 years of existence. The more recent chamber choir Tarira, with Sunleif Rasmussen as choirmaster, has firmly established its reputation through many high level international performances. Today the international classical music scene is enjoying some of our classical talents in concert halls, opera houses and other prime venues across the world.\n\nFaroe Islands Symphony Orchestra:\n\nCHAIN DANICING. One of the most unique cultural features of the Faroe Islands is the chain dance, which was originally a mediaeval ring dance. Today, it is known as the Faroese chain dance, and rightly so as it has only managed to survive in the Faroe Islands. The rhythm is quite quirky and the ballads about kings and heroes may have several hundred verses. A captain leads the singing and everybody joins in the chorus. The symbolic significance of the chain dance is the full circle of people, from all walks of life, who join hands and meet face-to-face on true common ground."}, {"url": "https://www.faroeislands.fo/the-big-picture/news/faroe-islands-pledge-to-curb-emissions/", "page_content": "01-11-2016\n\nFaroe Islands pledge to curb emissions\n\nPrime Minister Axel V.

That program was the inspiration for the Chinese orchestra's formation.\n\nTo provide China's finest young musicians access to the same superior training and performance opportunities, more than 100 Chinese musicians gathered at East Stroudsburg University in Pennsylvania for two weeks this month to participate in a training program under the guidance of conductor Ludovic Morlot, artistic director Cai Jindong and a suite of world-class teaching artists.\n\nLiao said that after intensive training under Morlot, a Grammy Award-winning principal conductor of the Seattle Symphony, he had gained a deeper understanding of orchestra performance.\n\n\"The concert is highly successful; I can tell from the audience's reaction,\" Liao told China Daily. \"You see, the cooperation is pretty well today.

Such mutual understanding and friendship helps lay the foundation for a strong state-to-state relationship,\" said Zhang Qiyue, Chinese consul general in New York.\n\nThe debut concert repertoire also included Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto and The Rhyme of Taigu by Zhou Long, a Chinese-American and Pulitzer Prize-winning Zhou Long.\n\nPianist Yuja Wang, who was honored as Musical America's 2017 Artist of the Year, played solo in the First Piano Concerto.\n\nNYO-China's concert tour will take the ensemble to Beijing, Shanghai and Suzhou from Wednesday through Saturday, giving the young musicians the chance to share what they have learned abroad musically in their home country.\n\n\"Actually, this is the first time that I have had a chance to closely interact with students from top music conservatories in China,\" said Liao, now a freshman at the Juilliard School in New York.\n\nLiao, who was born in Xiamen in Fujian province and raised in Shenzhen, took up the cello in kindergarten.\n\n\"It indeed expanded my social circle and improved my understanding of China's music business,\" he said. \"We will definitely keep in touch,\" he said of his fellow musicians. \"And all I think about at this moment is how to play better in the following tour to China.\"\n\nxiaohong@chinadailyusa.com\n\n(China Daily USA 07/28/2017 page1)"}, {"url": "https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/national-youth-orchestra-children-facts-auditions/", "page_content": "National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain: how to join, what to expect and how to ace your audition\n\nBy Rosie Pentreath\n\nAuditions for NYO and NCO have come round again \u2013 but once you get in, what can you expect from being a member of a youth orchestra?

It\u2019s something that becomes unforgettable for people\u201d.\n\nBenedetti names the friendships young musicians form, as well as the music itself underpinning the emotional experience as real highlights in the experience of being in a youth orchestra.\n\nRead more: Nicola Benedetti named National Youth Orchestra Ambassador\n\nAlumni include the spectacular Sir Simon Rattle, Sir Mark Elder, Kwam\u00e9 Ryan and Alison Balsom and currently 25 per cent of the principal seats in held in London orchestras belong to former NYO members.

Picture: PA\n\nWhat can you expect at a National Youth Orchestra residency?\n\n\u201cMy experience of playing in residencies was with National Children\u2019s Orchestras, both in Scotland and England,\u201d Benedetti says.\n\nIt\u2019s all about getting the chance to play incredible music, while having the time to look at scores in depth and, of course, meet fellow musicians and like-minded people.\n\nResidencies at the National Youth Orchestra take place three times a year over major school holidays, for either a week or two, with members of the orchestra staying overnight. Schedules include daily warm ups, rehearsals, workshops, coaching opportunities. performances and social events during down time.\n\nA lot of the musicians at a recent National Youth Orchestra residency got the chance to rehearse with Benedetti, and even form personal connections with her.\n\n\u201cA lot of the musicians have felt able to come and say \u2018Can I play this bit to you?\u2019, \u2018I\u2019m struggling a little bit with that\u2019, or \u2018What do you think of this or that?\u2019 \u2013 so I\u2019ve managed to start some personal connections to individuals in the orchestra.\u201d\n\nThis is something the violinist sees as being valuable to the young members of the orchestra, but also a rare treat for her.\n\n\u201cIt makes a real difference to me when you get to know an orchestra in a way that is not just a sea of faces but is very personal,\u201d she tells us.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between National Youth Orchestra and National Children\u2019s Orchestra?\n\nWhile the National Youth Orchestra is exclusively for teenagers, the National Children\u2019s Orchestras (NCO) is a charity-based selection of ensembles based both nationally and regionally.

Picture: Classic FM\n\nWhat\u2019s it like playing with a youth orchestra compared to a professional orchestra?\n\n\u201cWith a youth orchestra, what I always hope for is that they\u2019re willing to take more risks and they\u2019re less fearful,\u201d Benedetti explains.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a job that they could lose,\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s experiential.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd through that youthfulness, I hope players are a bit more fearless. At that age you have that love for, and innocence towards, music itself.\u201d\n\nFor Benedetti, that innocent energy given to music making is something that\u2019s possible to maintain as you get older, but not always easy. \u201cThe mystery is not there to the same extent\u201d, she says.\n\nHow do you ace a National Youth Orchestra audition?\n\nFor Benedetti, auditioning is all about sound first, and then just being yourself (watch her give advice above). Here are her three top tips for a youth orchestra audition:\n\n\u201cFocus on your fundamentals\u201d \u201cSound,\u201d the Nicky stresses, \u201cis everything. Never neglect that in order to just make sure you get one passage right or tick a box.\u201d \u201cAllow your personality to show\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t try to be too robotic. I think especially in today\u2019s world we\u2019re searching for a musical community, and musicians on stage, who are proud of who they are and will give you who you are.\u201d \u201cAccept that mistakes are a part of trying to do anything hard\u201d \u201cPlaying an instrument is something that\u2019s really challenging, so embrace that and don\u2019t fall at small hurdles,\u201d violinist Benedetti says. \u201cKeep the larger picture in place and focus as much as you can on your largest objectives and you\u2019ll have better success overall.\u201d\n\nVisit www.nyo.org.uk and www.nco.org.uk to find out more."}, {"url": "https://www.kennedy-center.org/education/opportunities-for-artists/pre-professional-artist-training/nso-youth-fellows/", "page_content": "Standards of Acceptance\n\nThe program is intended for serious music students with the primary acceptance standard being musical talent.
