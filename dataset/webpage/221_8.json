{"As Archbishop, John Joseph Hughes was a strong advocate for the establishment of the Catholic Church in the United States.": [{"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/philosophy-and-religion/roman-catholic-and-orthodox-churches-general-biographies/john-joseph-hughes", "page_content": "HUGHES, JOHN JOSEPH\n\nFirst archbishop of New York; b. County Tyrone, Ireland, June 24, 1797; d. New York, N.Y., Jan. 3, 1864. John was the third of seven children of Patrick and Margaret (McKenna) Hughes, small farmers who avoided involvement in Ireland's political disturbances. John attended the local schools, and soon showed an interest in the priesthood. In 1816 the father and an older son immigrated to the U. S., sending for John the following year, and for the rest of the family in 1818. They settled in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, where John worked in the quarries, at mending roads, and as a gardener. He made several applications for admission to Mt. St. Mary's Seminary, Emmitsburg, Md., only to learn that there was no room. When, however, Rev. John dubois offered to take him as a gardener until a vacancy occurred, Hughes went to Mt. St. Mary's on Nov. 10, 1819, and a year later was received in the seminary. He was accepted by Bp. Henry conwell for the Diocese of phila delphia, Pa., and ordained in St. Joseph's Church, Philadelphia, on Oct. 15, 1826; arrangements were made for him to continue his studies under Michael Hurley, OSA, who was assigned to St. Augustine's parish in that city.\n\nCareer in Philadelphia. When Hughes arrived, the trustees of St. Mary's Cathedral were in open conflict with Conwell as a result of the Hogan schism, which dated from 1821. After about a year at St. Augustine's, where he had a chance to watch developments at St. Mary's, Hughes spent a few weeks as pastor of Bedford, Pa.; he was then recalled to Philadelphia to become, successively, pastor at St. Joseph's (January 1827) and at St. Mary's (April 1827). When the trustees of St. Mary's refused to pay his salary, he returned in July to St. Joseph's, where he remained until St. John's Church was built and dedicated in April 1832. The new church had no lay incorporators and Hughes administered his parish with a firm hand.\n\nAlthough highly successful in his pastoral activities, he attracted more attention by his controversial writings and speeches. His first published sermon, which enhanced his reputation as a preacher, was on Catholic emancipation, then recently granted in Ireland, and was dedicated to Daniel O'Connell, whom he greatly admired. Anti-Catholicism, then strong in Philadelphia, was expressed freely in sermons, lectures, and the bitterly polemical Protestant weeklies. There was no Catholic paper, since many Catholics, including Bp. Francis Kenrick, who had been appointed coadjutor with full jurisdiction in 1830, thought the best policy was to suffer in silence. Hughes, on the contrary, believed in a vigorous defense. He founded the Catholic Herald, a newspaper that he later turned over to the diocese. Earlier he had established a Catholic Tract Society to distribute free pamphlets. In 1830, using the pseudonym \"Cranmer,\" he wrote letters to the Protestant, a New York weekly specializing in anti-Catholic propaganda. When, however, his wildly improbable accounts of Catholic plots and progress failed to strain the credulity of the editors and readers, he exposed the hoax. His best known controversy in Philadelphia was with Dr. John Breckinridge, a Presbyterian clergyman, with whom he debated in writing (1833) and orally (1835) on the Rule of Faith, and Catholicism as an obstacle to civil and religious liberty.\n\nHughes did not overestimate the value of controversy, but used it to make the enemies of the Church more cautious and to raise the morale of the sorely tried Catholic masses. His talents and his achievements attracted attention, and his promotion to the episcopate was generally expected. He had been recommended as coadjutor of Philadelphia by Conwell in 1829, and for Cincinnati in 1833. In 1836 the Holy See designated Hughes as coadjutor of Philadelphia and Kenrick as bishop of a new see to be erected at Pittsburgh, but Gregory XVI delayed formal approval. In 1837 when the Third Provincial Council of Baltimore asked that the division of Philadelphia be postponed, Hughes was preconized titular bishop of Basileopolis and coadjutor, with the right of succession, of New York. He was consecrated there on Jan. 7, 1838, in old St. Patrick's Cathedral.\n\nNew York. The diocese then consisted of all of New York State and about one-half of New Jersey, an area of about 55,000 square miles. Hughes found 22 churches, 10 of which had been erected in 1837, and 40 priests, to serve the needs of 200,000 Catholics, in a total population of about 2,700,000. The Emmitsburg Sisters of Charity were the only religious community in the diocese. Seven parochial schools, all in New York City, and four orphan asylums, two of which were in the city, made up the total of Catholic charitable and educational institutions. The population of the U.S. was increasing rapidly; in New York City the increase was five times the national rate. Moreover, the churches of the city were burdened with a heavy debt, $300,000. When, in January 1838, Dubois suffered a stroke, responsibilty for the diocese devolved upon Hughes, who was named apostolic administrator in August 1839 and succeeded to the see on Dec. 20, 1842. He became archbishop of New York on July 19, 1850, when it was made an archdiocese.\n\nHughes's authority was challenged in February 1839, when the cathedral trustees had a catechist appointed by Dubois ejected from the Sunday school by the police. A pastoral, written by Hughes and signed by Dubois, threatened the parishoners with an interdict unless they repudiated the trustees. This was done promptly, at a meeting summoned, addressed, and presided over, by Hughes. Except for the parish of St. Louis in Buffalo, where the trustees held out for years, New York had no further difficulty with trusteeism.\n\nAfter a preliminary visitation of the diocese, Hughes went to Europe in October 1839, seeking aid in Paris, Rome, Munich, Vienna, and Dublin. On his return in 1840, he engaged in his greatest contest over the question of religion and the public schools. The Public School Society, a private organization, practically monopolized public funds for education in New York City from 1825 to 1840. Professedly nonsectarian, it provided religious training that was offensive to Catholics, who wanted state aid for denominational schools and a proportionate share of public funds. Governor William Seward agreed with the Catholics, but the city aldermen and the state legislature were hostile. The resultant controversy, which destroyed the Public School Society, led to two quite unexpected developments\u2014the total secularization of U.S. public education on all levels, and the creation of the parochial school system in the U. S.\n\nThe growth of political nativism had led, in 1844, to the burning of Catholic churches and widespread riots in Philadelphia. Hughes's success in arousing his people to defend the churches against mob violence, while exhorting them to give no provocation, prevented similar disorders in New York. His firm stand on this and on the school question made him known throughout the country. Although attacked and misrepresented in the press, he was, nevertheless, highly respected in both Catholic and non-Catholic circles.\n\nHis achievements in the diocese included the erection of four new sees; the beginning of the new St. Patrick's Cathedral; the founding of a seminary, and of a college at Fordham, New York City, which he later transferred to the Jesuits; the introduction of many religions communities; and the development of charitable and educational works. He was instrumental in separating a group of Sisters of Charity from Emmitsburg, Md., thus founding the independent Mt. St. Vincent community in New York City.\n\nNational and International Affairs. Hughes was a vigorous defender of the temporal power of the pope, and sponsored more than one special collection to help Pius IX. He took a leading part in the founding of the North American College at Rome in 1859. Thoroughly unsym-pathetic to the abolitionist movement in the U. S., he believed that sudden emancipation would injure the slaves. He opposed plans to settle Irish immigrants on farm lands in the West, fearing they would be lost to the Church because of the shortage of priests. Although he endorsed Irish nationalism, he disapproved of risings that he thought could not succeed, and condemned Irish antislavery sentiment as an intrusion into U. S. politics. Because he was convinced of the basic harmony between American political institutions and Catholicism, he urged Catholic support of the U. S. Constitution and was friendly with officials of the national government. When President James Polk tried to send him to Mexico in 1847, he refused the mission because of its unofficial character. A visit to Europe in support of the Union, 1861\u201362, was undertaken at the request of President Lincoln and Secretary Seward. He was recommended to Rome for the red hat by Lincoln's government; when no action was taken, some believed the time was not ripe for an American cardinal, while others thought Hughes was not the best choice. His last public appearance was made in July 1863, at the request of New York Gov. Horatio Seymour, who was attempting to stop the draft riots that were then occurring in the City of New York.\n\nCharacter and Personality. Archbishop Hughes was a born leader and fighter. Prompt and vigorous in action, and unyielding in conflict, he believed he had the duty and the ability to lead and defend his people, and to prove that American Catholics were not second-class citizens. If he was autocratic and at times fought harder than was necessary, he merely displayed the defects of his virtues.\n\nAlthough Hughes became increasingly intolerant of disagreement, he nevertheless rendered valuable service to both Church and country. As his successor, Abp. John McCloskey, said: \"\u2026 if ever there was a man who in the whole history and character of his life impressed upon us the sense and conviction that he had been raised up by God, was chosen as His instrument to do an appointed work \u2026 that man was Archbishop Hughes.\" Hughes died of Bright's disease, after a long illness, and was buried in the old cathedral. His remains were translated to the new St. Patrick's Cathedral in 1883.\n\nBibliography: Complete Works, comp. and ed. l. kehoe, 2v.

He was raised there until immigrating to the United States in 1817. Once settled with his family in Chambersburg, Penn., Hughes made several unsuccessful applications to be admitted to Mount St. Mary's College in Emmitsburg, Md. He was eventually hired by its rector, the Abb\u00e9 John Dubois, S.S., as a gardener. During this time, he befriended Mother Elizabeth Ann Seton. Seton was favorably impressed by Hughes and persuaded Dubois to reconsider his admission. Hughes was subsequently admitted as a regular student of Mount St. Mary's in September 1820.\n\nIn his time as a seminarian, Hughes devotedly served his home diocese of Philadelphia. On October 15, 1826, he was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Henry Conwell at St. Joseph's Church in Philadelphia. During his early years as a priest, Hughes faithfully carried out his ministerial duties but also succeeded in bringing new life and an air of vibrancy to the Church he so deeply cared for in Philadelphia. Hughes founded St. John's Orphan Asylum in 1829 and was responsible for the structuring of a new church, St. John the Evangelist, in 1832. St. John the Evangelist became regarded as one of the finest and most impressive churches in the country at that time.\n\nHughes' passion for the welfare of the Church and his innate sense of initiative was soon recognized by the Catholic Church far beyond the confines of the Diocese of Philadelphia. On August 7, 1837, Pope Gregory XVI called upon Hughes to serve as the coadjutor bishop for the then Diocese of New York.\n\nConsistent with his desire to educate people on the Word of God, Hughes began searching in 1838 for a suitable location to establish a new seminary and college. It was not long before Hughes resolved that the 100 acres of Rose Hill Manor bordering the Bronx River was the perfect spot. After three short but productive years, St. John's College (now Fordham University), the first Catholic institution of higher learning in the northeast, was established. In 1846, St. John's College was sold to the Jesuit Order and Archbishop Hughes recruited five Jesuit priests from St. Mary's College in Kentucky to staff the College. On April 10th of the same year, the governor of the State of New York granted the College a university charter. Then, in 1907, after the recent addition of a law school and medical school, the name was changed to Fordham University, and St. John's College became Fordham College. After remaining a men's college for 133 years, Fordham College merged with Thomas More College for women in 1974, becoming coeducational.\n\nAfter his thoughtful work founding what we now call Fordham University, Hughes went on to succeed his predecessor and former rector, Bishop John Dubois, in late December of 1842. In becoming the bishop of the Diocese of New York, Hughes assumed responsibility for a diocese that stretched across the entire state of New York and northern New Jersey. Always a man eager to spread God's holy Word, he embraced this new position with both courage and conviction. He worked zealously to uphold the dignity of each human being and the integrity of the Catholic faith, standing in unique solidarity with the Irish immigrants of his time and giving careful consideration to the ways by which young children were being educated on the foundations of the Catholic faith. And when the Diocese of New York was elevated to the status of an Archdiocese by Pope Pius IX, so, too, was Hughes' own status elevated to that of an Archbishop.\n\nThe vision of \"Dagger John,\" as Archbishop Hughes became known due to his aggressive and determined personality, remains actively alive at Fordham today. We know this because the men and women of Fordham emerge from their Jesuit experiences and are guided by conscience, empowered by competence, and fortified by a sincere sense of compassion. These are the characteristics of men and women who live with and for others."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/nyregion/dont-mess-with-dagger-john.html", "page_content": "In his St. Patrick\u2019s Day sermon in 1852, John J.

Tyrone, third son among seven children of Patrick Hughes, farmer and weaver from Dernaved, and his wife Margaret (n\u00e9e McKenna). A parish and hedge school contemporary was the novelist William Carleton (qv) (whom Hughes later aided when visiting Dublin in 1862); Carleton's better work depicts their earlier shared background. After 1800 the family moved to a farmhouse in Dernaved townland, nearby in Co. Monaghan (since rebuilt at the Ulster American Folk Park). Unusually Hughes stayed in a chapel school there until 16 (or 17) to prepare for priesthood. A bad farming year then caused his withdrawal and training as a gardener (1814). Two of his siblings died around this time. His father went (1816) to Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, to prepare a life for the remaining family; John himself went out in 1817, and the rest followed in 1818. John worked as a labourer in Maryland, then as a gardener at St Joseph's school, Emmitsburg, which shared a campus with Mount St Mary's, a secondary school with a senior seminary stream. Its Parisian-born rector Fr John Dubois thwarted Hughes's desire to become a seminarian until St Joseph's superior, Mother (later St) Elizabeth Seton, stressed his merit. Dubois then hired him as overseer of his farm and slaves until he saw for himself the Tyrone man's capacities, and allowed him to enter the school by age 23. On 15 October 1826 Hughes was ordained for Philadelphia, a month before Fr Dubois was himself installed as bishop of New York.\n\nEarly career, 1826\u201338 Hughes had thus already observed the command of others and practised it as a foreman, a local controversialist, and a funds collector. Two cultured European priests, Dubois and Simon Brut\u00e9, formed him; two American converts, Mother Seton and Fr Samuel Cooper, influenced him. As a seminarian he was sponsored by Philadelphia's bishop, who liked him \u2013 the aged Ulster churchman Henry Conwell, sent there in 1820 when already 75. Hughes witnessed the bishop's loss of power to the fractious (and briefly schismatic) local lay trustees of St Mary's, the city's premier (and cathedral) church, to which Hughes was himself appointed pastor in spring 1827. There he decided that clear hierarchy was the way forward, and mobilised the \u2018new\u2019 Irish against the trustees. In 1830 Francis Kenrick (qv), a Dubliner educated in Rome and there ordained in April 1821, was put in with some control as coadjutor bishop to Conwell. Hughes's exact contemporary, they differed markedly. Hughes held that the morale of the poorer Irish required a forceful counter-attack on the anti-catholicism then spreading as a result of the convergence of new mass Irish immigration and America's evangelical revival. Both Dublin and Rome had shaped Kenrick's more irenic approach, which was not dissimilar to that religiously usual in Philadelphia's older catholic community. Hughes acted boldly on each front. He rejected the claim that substantial lay power in church matters was appropriate to the new nation's civic or \u2018republican\u2019 culture, and linked it to wider anti-catholic propaganda. Instead he shaped a relevant apologetics and a joint political argumentation. American religious and civil freedoms required that catholics sustain their position, not that they hide or negate it. Religious prejudice against them was both anti-American, and all too reminiscent of the position but recently endured in Ireland. But his own initially abusive polemics marred his case. As Dubois once disciplined him for bullying students when a prefect, Kenrick now rebuked his uncharity. Hughes learned to modify his methods as he matured his insights. Gradually he transformed the thrust of \u2018Americanisation\u2019 among many catholics to one that accommodated a robust group-assertion, rather than cultivated the pieties of otherness quietly, or adjusted more or less to socio-political secularity.\n\nCoadjutor and archbishop of New York, 1838\u201364 Leadership of catholic New York, the epicentre of catholic immigration, offered him a wider context. Hughes was consecrated coadjutor there on 7 January 1838, taking effective command when Dubois suffered a stroke within the month. Dubois had been consecrated at 62 for New York. Lay factions rode roughshod over him. Within ten years he was exhausted, and died on 20 December 1842. Hughes had right of immediate succession. In 1850 New York was made an archdiocese; on 3 October 1850 Hughes received the documents (issued 19 July) confirming this and appointing him archbishop. He was given the pallium personally by Pius IX on 3 April 1851.\n\nThus from February 1838 until his final incapacity (from Bright's disease) in autumn 1863, the Irish-born prelate effectively ruled the diocese and then archdiocese. Within state and nation, he sought to change \u2018an apologetic people . . . into a militant people\u2019 (R. J. Purcell, DAB, ix (v, pt 1), 353). Gradually he won acceptance of this by official (but not popular) America, perhaps because in his archdiocese he harmonised massive catholic growth with the city's secular expansion. While he could not provide fully for the huge increases of his people, he provided New York's model ecclesial and school structures for a century. He pioneered and focused its metropolitan character. Twice he cut his jurisdiction's extent, to one-eleventh its original size, carving off almost all upstate New York in 1847, and Long Island and northern New Jersey in 1853. Hughes opened twenty-three parishes during 1840\u201363 within the city, and a further thirty-seven in the lower Hudson valley outside it. Manhattan's population more than doubled to 805,358 by 1860, its Irish-born then 203,730. Despite such increase, practising catholics for each city parish grew only slightly (10 per cent) from 1840 to 1865, vindicating his new creations. About one-half of catholics practised in the city itself, partly as the provision of parochial schools for their offspring remained very inadequate, with only 5,000 children covered in 1840 and 12,000 in 1860.\n\nIn 1840 Hughes sought to overthrow the city's Public School Society (wholly protestant) and its curricula, and to gain New York state recognition and funding for parochial schools. The state then created a secular public school system for the city, run on district lines. Hughes thus triggered the emergence of exclusively secular public schools, and thereby turned many moderate protestants toward nativism, as express Christian education was driven from their schools of choice. Yet he failed to win the funding that could have held his own poor more fully to their church. In 1857 he said: \u2018In our age, the question of education is the question of the church\u2019 (Cohalan, 56). His delivery was thus plainly unequal to his vision. His strategy of exclusive and defensive concentration, however understandable, left many unprovided for, with results later modified only by the rising and more politic affluence of many catholics. Through informal \u2018Tammany\u2019 links his successor John McCloskey wisely gained catholic teachers in the new district schools educating most catholic children. Hughes did, however, create the formative free parochial school system in the city.\n\nHughes gradually squeezed lay trusteeism out of New York. Despite a Know-Nothing law to prop it up (1855), he won a state law guaranteeing episcopal title to church properties (1863). He often co-opted trustees onto replacement boards of management. He won informal approval for a catholic chaplaincy in the US military by 1847, and its expansion in 1861 through William Seward, a friend since 1840.\n\nGaining major funding for New York from various missionary societies in Europe, he convinced Rome that his archdiocese must be a chief priority of the missionary church. He relied on a seasoned inner circle of pre-1835 fellow immigrants active in business (with whom he set up the Emigrant Savings Bank) to fund major projects, including the start of St Patrick's cathedral. He introduced many religious orders, including the Redemptorists (1841), the Irish Sisters of Mercy (May 1846), the Jesuits (also 1846) (granting them control of the nascent Fordham), and the Christian [D. L. Salle] Brothers in two stages (1848, 1853). Oddly, he split Mother Seton's original order by his drive to control their local work; those accepting this (including his sister, Ellen) created a new order based in the city (1846), while \u2013 fearing further such pressures elsewhere \u2013 the original American Sisters of Charity affiliated to the French Daughters of Charity (St Vincent de Paul) in 1850. Hughes was no \u2018devotionalist\u2019 in the by-then-current French or Italian styles. Critics of most Irish clergy, such as George Templeton Strong and John Blake Dillon (qv), excepted him as a man of doctrine, clarity, and intelligence. In 1846 he introduced the choice of the Blessed Virgin as patroness of the US at the sixth provincial council in Baltimore. Though he disliked \u2018national\u2019 parishes, Hughes did accept German and French ones, though he distanced Italian claims. He also accepted the creation both of \u2018select\u2019 (fee-paying) schools, and of up-market parishes (St Ann's, St Francis Xavier). His view of an urban American church was thus realist and comprehensive. He was certainly no Irish-ghetto builder. To Bishop John England (qv), Hughes was an \u2018emphatically self-made man\u2019 (Shaw, Dagger John, 91). He advanced many American-born and convert catholics as vital to his church's future.\n\nHe famously faced off public authority when nativist riots impended in April 1844. But this obscures a deeper change. His early and continued counter-polemics with anti-catholic partisans (e.g., Controversy between Rev. Messrs Hughes and Breckenridge (1834); Kirwan unmasked (1848)) gave way to the realisation that in an emergent metropolis with a bare majority then catholic (if problematically so), the analogous problems had shifted to those posed by the attractions of secularity, the indifference of elites, and the irresolute commitment of many formal adherents. The Know-Nothings of 1854\u20135 did not worry him as much as had their 1840s forerunners. His later battles were with secular spokesmen who respected him, notably Horace Greeley of the New York Tribune, and James G. Bennett, editor of the New York Herald, both highly political men. All three sought rival definitions of a culture, variously to sustain, exclude, contain, or modify Hughes's insistence that American liberty accept the spiritual obediences of catholics as fully licit, and their culture as a public contribution to urban and national vitality and order. His disputes with immigrant Young Ireland and Confederation leaders of 1848 had similar roots (except in the breaches with Thomas D'Arcy McGee (qv), who was less sanguine about both America and its Irish than was Hughes). A supporter of Daniel O'Connell (qv), and very active in famine relief, Hughes showed initial sympathy for both 1848 goals and later the Fenians, unsurprisingly given the trend to an overlap of Defender and United Irish interests in his childhood townlands.\n\nPolitically, and unlike most Irish, Hughes disliked the Democrats (despite many Democratic associates) for their assertive secularity, regretted Irish captivity to them, and preferred the orderly Whigs. Like most Irish, he distrusted the anti-slavery enthusiasms of the new Republicans. Having tried a \u2018catholic\u2019 slate in 1841 during the schools battle, thereafter he held that catholics as such ought to be non-partisan. This precedent became a tradition and was upheld by most Irish American bishops and laity (notably in 1901).\n\nYet Hughes had not forgotten the youthful anti-slavery reactions of his own Maryland years. His reform patriotism was deepened by many trips to Europe (October 1839\u2013February 1840, summer 1843, December 1845, December 1850\u2013July 1851), on which he was scandalised by Old World inequities. The shock of southern secession elicited a mature loyalty to the US, made contentious in his city in that many of his people's editors and leaders were Democrats wishing a \u2018moderate\u2019 and short war and a negotiated peace. The Lincoln administration sent him to France and Rome on the union's behalf in late 1861. He stayed in Rome until summer 1862.The anti-draft riots of July 1863 shadowed his last year, but his standing curbed their divisive impact.\n\nIt is as flexible planner of a metropolitan catholicism in a culture of multiple freedoms that he is most admirable. He disciplined his \u2018tough\u2019 and combative sides to that task. A rural Irishman seasoned to a rural America, Hughes tamed an urban-ward flood. His opposition to mass westward colonisation by the Irish newcomers reflected his close experience of farming in both Ireland and America; he did not oppose migration by stages to the land. Through it all he sustained a quiet and exhausting charity into the decline of his later years (c.1858\u201363), which drove him to live with his sister's family and move in a very limited circle. He died 3 January 1864.\n\nPapers The papers of John Hughes are principally in the archdiocesan archives at St Joseph's, Dunwoodie, Yonkers, New York. The collections include the diaries of two of his secretaries, Fr James R. Bayley and Fr Thomas Preston, and photocopies and microfilms of many of his letters in other archives, starting with those first made by his would-be biographer Peter Guilday. As the American church was under the jurisdiction of Rome's Congregation of Propaganda Fide until 1908, key papers went through it; these are catalogued and calendared by Anton Debevec and Finbar Kenneally, United States documents in the Propaganda Fide archives: a calendar, 1st ser. (5 vols, Washington, DC, 1966\u201374). Copies of the relevant ones are now in the above archives. So too are copies of his correspondence with the Society for the Propagation of the Faith (Lyon and Paris, its papers housed at its archives in Lyon). Photocopies were sent to the relevant American dioceses (United States) from 1987 to 1992: see a summary list by diocese in Jean-Marie Jammes in Catholic Historical Review, lxxv (Apr. 1989), 264\u20137. Henry J. Browne, another would-be biographer, also amassed collections on Hughes and his times. His unpublished biography is in the archives at Columbia University in the H. J. Browne papers there. Various sermons, articles, and pamphlets of Hughes are in Lawrence Kehoe (ed.), Complete works of the Most Rev. John Hughes, D.D. (2 vols, 1865); it is very incomplete and there has never been a collected works. The counter-view was closely provided and documented by James Gordon Bennett in his New York Herald. There is no published full scholarly biography."}, {"url": "https://www.americamagazine.org/arts-culture/2018/07/11/leader-needed-strength-archbishop-john-hughes", "page_content": "Immigration. The numbers are astounding:\n\nThe \u2018Irish hemorrhage\u2019 started in earnest in the first months of 1847. The resulting stigmatization would quickly make \u2018Irish Catholic,\u2019 more than ever before, bywords for dirty, dangerous and socially destructive.\n\nIn 1847, the number of Irish immigrants arriving at the port of New York doubled from its yearly average in the earlier part of the decade, climbing to almost 53,000. The next year just over 90,000 desperate travelers poured off ships. (The number nationwide was 151,000.) Almost 113,000 people landed in New York in 1849. These numbers were unfathomable (184-185).\n\nDagger John by John Loughery Cornell University Press. 420p, $32.95\n\nThese men and women were fleeing starvation in their homeland. When they arrived in New York, they were \u201cwasted, ill-clothed, and dazed with grief\u201d (185). They had nothing, the conditions they lived in were hellish, and they were despised by the rest of the populations of New York City, Philadelphia and Boston.\n\nThirty years prior to the potato blight that depopulated much of Ireland, John Hughes, an emigr\u00e9 from Northern Ireland, landed in Baltimore. He was 20 years old. He was literate but unschooled because he had been forced to labor in support of his family. He became a day laborer in his new country, worked alongside slaves on farms, cut stone in a quarry and later became a gardener on the grounds of a Maryland seminary that was just getting its legs. Though the rector refused this gardener\u2019s desire to enter the seminary for years, John Hughes persevered, was admitted and eventually succeeded that same seminary rector as the fourth bishop of New York.\n\nJohn Hughes was an immigrant to the United States. He spent his ecclesial career caring for the Irish immigrants that swarmed New York and defending the Roman Catholic Church against violence, arson and bigotry. Perhaps even more astounding than this immigrant\u2019s rise to ecclesial and political power was Hughes\u2019s fierce love for the United States. In fact, in the last years of his life, Hughes, departing dramatically from the political sensibilities of the same immigrants that he intended to serve, supported President Lincoln and the Union forces in the Civil War at a time when New York City itself was contemplating secession. Hughes was not anti-slavery, but he was beholden to the notion of the United States as a cohesive Union bound by law. The Confederacy had fractured this Union by violence and defiance of law. Like the revolutionary insurgencies of Europe\u2014Italian, French, Hungarian, Spanish\u2014such violence threatened to dissolve a nation and imperil Catholicism, so Dagger John stuck with Lincoln until his death.\n\nJohn Hughes spent his ecclesial career caring for the Irish immigrants that swarmed New York and defending the Roman Catholic Church against violence, arson and bigotry.\n\nJohn Hughes fought all his life. Beyond pugnacious, he was truculent. John Loughery\u2019s portrait of John Hughes is fascinating because of his depictions of the ferocity of Hughes and the wildness of New York from the 1840s through the 1860s. This biography is anything but parochial. It documents the life of a man trying to raise money for, build, staff and defend fledging Catholic institutions in a political context that violently dismissed Catholicism as anti-American. It offers a window into antebellum politics in the United States and John Hughes\u2019s dealings with Presidents Polk, Buchanan and Lincoln. It describes Hughes\u2019s interactions with European monarchs and men like Daniel O\u2019Connell of Ireland. It details how the Catholic Church itself broke apart at the start of the Civil War.\n\nDagger John is the story, as Loughery writes, of a man who \u201cwanted to be a cardinal, not a saint\u201d (344). Thoughtfully, Loughery applies a quote from Arthur Schlesinger Jr.\u2019s work on Orestes Brownson\u2014one of Hughes\u2019s adversaries in print and in various public events\u2014to Hughes himself: \u201cSchlesinger Jr. wrote, \u2018Brownson may have indeed brought rudeness to Boston, but he also brought strength, and strength was badly needed.\u2019 Exactly the same could be said of John Hughes and New York. Rudeness and strength were the future; drift and patience were the past\u201d (91).\n\nHughes confronted anyone who denigrated Catholicism or\u2014internally\u2014any Catholic who challenged his authority. Where parish councils seemed to impinge on Hughes\u2019s command, Hughes placed their churches under interdict. Any priest who did not work, defied the bishop or was not above scandal, Hughes relieved of his duties\u2014even as he needed priests desperately. When a religious order felt the bishop had overstepped his own canonical authority, Hughes fought for further control, even causing a schism within Elizabeth Ann Seton\u2019s order of nuns. Any Irishman who coupled the Catholic Church as an oppressor along with England, Hughes denounced as a rebel harmful to the well-being of Ireland. Hughes picked fights, responded to bullies and bigots and always held his ground. One might argue that Hughes helped hatch the Catholic Church in the United States through perseverance and truculence.\n\nDagger John is the story, as author John Loughery writes, of a man who \u201cwanted to be a cardinal, not a saint.\u201d\n\nHughes\u2019s strength resided in the sheer numbers of the Catholic men and women in and around New York City. His concrete power came from the rabble that poured into the city during the famine. He was an unelected leader of a huge constituency of Catholics whose brute numbers translated into political power. In the 1840s, he was able, through his influence over electoral politics, to dismantle the private guild of Protestants who administered public schools in New York City. Hughes wanted Catholic immigrants to attend school in order to break the cycle of poverty. After all, it was education that elevated him from a vegetable patch to an archdiocese.\n\nLoughery acknowledges that John Hughes was racist, paternalistic and imperious, but at the same time, Hughes was far more complicated a human being than these labels. Furthermore, Hughes\u2019s historical context was far more complicated than we can now imagine. Such a life, such insights into the history of our own church in the United States will surely provoke conversation. Here are some questions to get started:"}, {"url": "https://www.mrlincolnandnewyork.org/new-yorkers/archbishop-john-j-hughes-1797-1863/", "page_content": "\u201cIt is an understatement to say that John Hughes was a complex character,\u201d wrote Monsignor Thomas Shelley, who researched the life of New York\u2019s first archbishop, John J. Hughes. \u201cHe was impetuous and authoritarian, a poor administrator and worse financial manager, indifferent to the non-Irish members of his flock, and prone to invent reality when it suited the purposes of his rhetoric. One of the Jesuit superiors at Fordham with whom he quarreled said, \u2018He has an extraordinarily overbearing character; he has to dominate.'\u201d1\n\n\u201cHe was feared and love; misunderstood and idolized; misrepresented even to his ecclesiastical superiors in Rome, whose confidence in him, however, remained unshaken. Severe of manner, kindly of heart, he was not aggressive until assailed,\u201d according to the Catholic Encyclopedia. \u201cHe was a forceful, impressive and convincing speaker; an able, resourceful and talented controversialist, a clear, logical and direct writer. His writing were usually hastily done, as occasion required, but commanded general attention from friend and opponent.\u201d2\n\n\u201cEqually vigorous in disciplining lay trustees, in hitting back at nativists, and in setting up new churches, Hughes was particularly determined to reassert the traditional powers of the priesthood in church government,\u201d wrote the authors of A History of New York State.3 Archbishop Hughes was a forceful speaker and domineering leader with special influence among Irish-Americans in New York City and special entree into the Lincoln Administration.\n\nPresident Lincoln wrote that \u201chaving formed the Archbishop\u2019s acquaintance in the earliest days of our country\u2019s present troubles, his counsel and advice were gladly sought and continually received by the Government on those points which his position enabled him better than others to consider. At a conjuncture of deep interest to the country, the Archbishop, associated with others, went abroad, and did the nation a service there with all the loyalty, fidelity and practical wisdom which on so many other occasions illustrated his great ability for administration.\u201d4\n\nNew York\u2019s Catholic bishop had long fought anti-Catholic and nativist prejudice. Mr. Lincoln called on him to fight for the Union. Archbishop Hughes served as President Lincoln\u2019s semiofficial envoy to the Vatican and to France in later 1861and early 1862. \u201cThe Archbishop was old, wise, and influential with foreign-born Catholics in America. A Whig in politics, he had been intimate with Weed and Seward for twenty years. Advancing age had not dulled the twinkle in his eye nor palsied the firmness of his step,\u201d wrote Jay Monaghan in Diplomat in Carpet Slippers. \u201cBefore he embarked, Lincoln called him to Washington. Busybodies who saw the Archbishop enter Lincoln\u2019s office speculated on the conference. The prelate came out with the mien of a man entrusted with a secret mission. He said that he was going to Europe \u2014 France, Spain, Italy \u2014 the Catholic countries. \u2018Neither the North nor the South knew my mission,\u2019 Hughes wrote a friend. \u2018I alone knew it.\u201d5\n\nSeward was apparently more enthusiastic about sending Hughes on this mission than to include their mutual friend Thurlow Weed. Archbishop Hughes first declined to undertake the trip during a meeting with Seward in October 1861. But Archbishop Hughes insisted he would go only if he was accompanied by Weed. Secretary of State Seward was left with no choice. Weed recalled:\n\nThe secretary, after I came in, resumed the conversation and renewedly urged the Archbishop to accept. But he persisted in his declination, repeating, as I inferred, the reasons previously given for declining. The conversation was interrupted by a servant who ushered Baron von Gerolt, the Prussian minister, into the parlor. The Secretary seated himself with the baron upon a sofa in the ante-room, and I took advantage of the interruption to urge the Archbishop with great earnestness to withdraw his declination. He reiterated his reasons for declining. I told him that I had already listened attentively to all he had said, and that while I knew he always had good and sufficient reasons for whatever he did or declined to do, he had not yet chosen to state them; and that while I did not seek to know more than he thought proper to avow, I must again appeal to him as a loyal citizen, devoted to the Union, and capable of rendering great service at a crisis of imminent danger, not to persist in his refusal unless his reasons for doing so were insurmountable. After a long pause he placed his hand upon my shoulder, and, in his impressive manner and clear, distinct voice, said, \u201cWill you go with me?\u201d I replied, \u2018I have once enjoyed the great happiness of a voyage to Europe in your company, and of a tour through Ireland, England, and France under your protection. It was a privilege and a pleasure which I shall never forget. I would cheerfully go with you now as your secretary or your valet, if that would give to the government the benefit of your services. And here the conversation rested until Baron von Gerolt took his leave. When Governor Seward returned the Archbishop rose and said, \u201cGovernor, I have changed my mind, and will accept the appointment with this condition, that he,\u201d placing his hand again upon my shoulder, \u201cgoes with me as a colleague. And as you want us to sail next Wednesday, I shall leave for New York by the first tram in the morning. I lodge at the convent at Georgetown, and I will now take my leave. So good-night and good-by. I accompanied the Archbishop to his carriage where, after he was seated, he said with a significant gesture, \u2018This programme is not be changed.\u201d6\n\nArchbishop Hughes wrote Weed shortly thereafter that \u201cI do hereby appoint you, with or without the consent of the Senate, to be my friend (as you always have been) and my companion in our brief visit to Europe. The more I reflect upon the subject the more I am convinced that whether successful or not, the purpose is marked, in actual circumstances, by large, enlightened, and very wise statesmanship.\u201d Weed met up with Hughes in New York City two days before their departure where Secretary of State Seward read to them their instructions. Among the reasons for the choice of Archbishop Hughes for the mission \u201cwere doubtless the contacts with notables which he had made on previous European visits, and the prestige he had gained through his financial and moral support of the papal cause whenever the temporal sovereignty of the Pope was imperiled. However, his anglophobe tendencies, which he tried vainly to overcome or disguise, would have unfitted him for effective service in England,\u201d wrote Rena Mazyck Andrews.7 But even the U.S. Minister to Paris, William Dayton, seemed uncooperative to the Irish-American prelate. According to biographer Andrews, Dayton \u201cwas in no mood to encourage the diplomatic activities of an unofficial agent, and declined to arrange for the Archbishop\u2019s presentation at court. Hughes then took matters in his own hands, with the result that a few days later he was being received with marked courtesy by [Emperor] Napoleon and [Empress] Eugenie at the Tuileries.\u201d\n\nIn November the Union delegation met in Paris with Minister to France William Dayton, Minister to Belgium Henry S. Sanford, and John Bigelow, the influential journalist who was U.S. Consul in Paris. \u201cSeveral hours were spent in discussing the situation and maturing a plan of action. Mr. Sanford and been connected with the American Embassy at Paris. Both he and Mr. Bigelow had familiar access to the clubs and to men in power. They pressed upon Mr. Weed the discouraging conviction that the French people would universally condemn the arrest of Mason and Slidell, of which tidings had just reached Paris,\u201d wrote Thurlow Weed Barnes. \u201cVarious contingencies were considered at this consultation. \u201cIt was finally agreed that the Archbishop should immediately seek an audience with the Emperor. Mr. Weed, after inducing General [Winfield] Scott to outline a public letter, which Mr. Bigelow volunteered to write, was to cross the Channel, confer with Bishop McIlvaine, and see what could be accomplished in England. These arrangements perfected Mr. Weed retired with his colleague, Archbishop Hughes, to their apartments in the H\u00f4tel de l\u2019Europe. Subsequently the Archbishop\u2019s audience resulted in a long courteous, but inconclusive conversation with the Emperor, from which it was impossible to extract the slightest crumb of comfort.\u201d8 Biographer Rena Mazyck Andrews wrote:\n\nTo his imperial hosts he urged two courses of action. One was to mediate in the event of a war between the United States and England. The other was to make France independent of southern cotton by encouraging its culture in Algeria. But the Emperor declined to commit himself to either proposition\u2026. So gracious was his reception that the Archbishop went away highly elated and convinced that recognition of the Confederacy was not likely soon to occur. However, if we take into account the varied forces that were to influence the ultimate decision of Napoleon, it would seem that the imperial audience had been for Hughes a personal, rather then a diplomatic, triumph, Yet, not altogether without significance was the fact that after being relieved of his last apprehension of intervention by the pacific tone of the Emperor\u2019s address at the opening of the Corps Legislatif, Hughes could depart for Rome feeling assured that he left behind a much friendlier feeling for America on the part of the French people than he had found on his arrival. In Rome the Archbishop basked in the favor of the Pope and his ministers. Meeting pilgrims and high ecclesiastics from every Catholic country, he continued to create sentiment for the Union cause. Repeating the tactics he had used with Eugenie, he convinced the Spanish bishops that their country\u2019s hold upon Cuba would be endangered if the Confederates won the war.9\n\nLincoln biographer Carl Sandburg wrote that \u201cthe Archbishop became one of the President\u2019s personal agents with full powers to set forth the Union cause in Europe. The Archbishop had interviewed the French Emperor, attended a canonization of martyrs in Rome, laid the cornerstone of a new Catholic university in Dublin built partly from moneys collected in America. In this tour of eight months over Europe the Archbishop spoke the pro-Northern views which he gave in a published letter to the pro-Southern Archbishop of New Orleans.\u201d10 Hughes\u2019 expenses of $5200 were paid by the government, but the archbishop actually proposed a more extensive tour of the continent that would have cost $10,000. The Lincoln Administration declined to underwrite such expenses.\n\nHughes had become a close ally of then New York Governor William H. Seward when in 1840 he started a campaign to get state funding for Roman Catholic schools to compete with schools run by the Public School Society which denigrated the Catholic religion. The issue forged an alliance between the usually pro-Democratic Catholic Church and the usually anti-immigrant Whig Party. Biographer Andrews wrote: \u201cA serious detriment, however, to his influence at home was the wide-spread belief that he was a politician. The origin of this idea may be traced to his interest in national affairs and to his close relations with Thurlow Weed and William H. Seward. Somehow, behind the scenes, he was supposed to be politically active in their behalf, even as they, in turn reciprocated by promoting Catholic interests.\u201d11\n\nLike Seward and Weed, Hughes took an interest in patronage. One patronage applicant wrote President Lincoln in August 1862: \u201cI have the honor to advise You that the most Revd Arch Bishop Hughes has kindly notified me that he will be in the City this evening, and that he will Seek an opportunity to Call upon You in referance [sic] to my application for the position of Collector for the 8th District of New York.\u201d12 President Lincoln also sought Hughes\u2019 advice on appointing hospital chaplains:\n\nI am sure you will pardon me if, in my ignorance, I do not address with technical correctness \u2014 I find no law authorizing the appointment of Chaplains for the our hospitals; and yet the services of chaplains are more needed, perhaps, in the hospitals, than with the healthy troops soldiers in the field \u2014 With this view, I have given a sort of quasi appointment, (a copy of which I inclose) to each of three protestant ministers, who have accepted, and entered upon the duties- If you perceive no objection, I will thank you to give me the name or names of one or more suitable persons of the Catholic Church, to whom I may properly with propriety, tender the same service- Many thanks for your kind, and judicious letters to Gov. Seward, and which he regularly allows me both the pleasure and the profit of seeing. perusing.13\n\nHughes had influence in the Lincoln Administration, but his views were very different from those of Seward and President Lincoln on slavery. Biographer Rena Mazyck Andrews wrote in the 1850s that \u201cdespite the fact that the attitude of the Roman Church to slavery was one of studied silence, Archbishop Hughes could not resist publishing a controversial article entitled \u2018The Abolition views of Brownson Overthrown.\u2019 Here his protest against the hysterical propaganda of the abolitionists was so vigorous as to leave the impression in many minds that he was a zealous defender of the \u2018peculiar institution\u2019 as it then existed in the Southern States, if not an apologist for the slave trade.\u201d14\n\nWhen the South seceded, however, Hughes\u2019 loyalty to the Union was clear and he expressed his views forcefully, especially in letters to Secretary of State Seward. According to Lincoln biographer Carl Sandburg, \u201cCheers and applause greeted the public reading of a letter of John Hughes, Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Church of New York, declaring for the Star Stripes: \u2018This has been my flag and shall be till the end.\u2019 At home and abroad, the Archbishop would have it wave \u2018for a thousand years and afterward as long as Heaven permits, without limit, of duration.'\u201d\n\nHughes\u2019 support for the War effort brought him a new source of criticism \u2014 American Catholics without loyalty and admiration of the South. They were sharply critical and some of their criticism reached the Vatican. President Lincoln apparently attempted to counter that criticism by writing that he \u201cwould feel particular gratification in any honor which the Pope might have it in his power to confer upon him.\u201d15 Vatican authorities failed to respond to the President\u2019s hint that Hughes be elevated to Cardinal. It was on Hughes\u2019 successor that the honor of becoming the first American Cardinal was bestowed.\n\n\u201cUrging adequate protection of the national capital and a strict enforcement of the blockade, he urged even more the importance of opening the Mississippi,\u201d noted biographer Rena Mazyck Andrews. \u201cAmong his own people he stimulated volunteer enlistments in the army and services of chaplains and nurses. One of his most inspiring appeals was addressed to the Catholic clergy of his province on \u2018Duty to the Country.'\u201d16 After his mission to Europe, Archbishop Hughes preached a sermon in which he urged that \u201cvolunteering continue and the draft be made; if 300,000 be not enough this week, next week make a draft of 300,000 more.\u201d17\n\nAlthough a supporter of the Union, Archbishop Hughes did not support President Lincoln on Emancipation and remained a supporter of the South\u2019s right to maintain slavery. Historians Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace wrote: \u201cEmancipation also alienated the Catholic Church hierarchy. Up till then Archbishop Hughes had been friendly with the administration, especially Secretary of State William H. Seward, his old ally on the education issue, and New York political boss Thurlow Weed.\u201d18 Lincoln biographer Carl Sandburg noted that President Lincoln \u201ccould not be oblivious to the viewpoint of which Seward as a friend of Archbishop John Hughes of New York was the spokesman, and Archbishop\u2019s widely reprinted declaration in his official organ, the Metropolitan Record: \u2018We, Catholics, and a vast majority of our brave troops in the field, have not the slightest idea of carrying on a war that costs so much blood and treasure just to gratify a clique of Abolitionists in the North.\u201d19\n\nHughes\u2019 was born in Ireland and ordained in Philadelphia. He became head of the New York diocese on the death of Bishop John Dubois in 1842 and archbishop of New York 1850 when New York was upgraded to an archdiocese. \u201cWhen John Hughes came to New York in 1838, the diocese was 10 times the size of the present-day Archdiocese of New York,\u201d wrote Monsignor Thomas J. Shelley. \u201cIt included all of New York state and the northern half of New Jersey, an area of 55,000 square miles, with about 200,000 Catholics. In that extensive diocese there were only 38 churches and 50 priests, two Catholic schools and a few orphan asylums. There was not a single Catholic College, seminary, rectory, hospital or other institution.\u201d20\n\nThe next two and half decades were a time of tremendous growth for the city and the Catholic Church. According to Monsignor Shelley, \u201cThis rapidly growing Catholic population created an insatiable demand for more churches, schools and charitable institutions. In 1859 Archbishop Hughes boasted that he had dedicated 97 churches in the previous 20 years, an average of one new church every 10 weeks. In the area that remained part of the archdiocese, he established no fewer than 61 new parishes.\u201d21 Archbishop Hughes was particularly active in attracting religious orders to set up charitable and educational organizations in New York. In August 1858, Archbishop Hughes laid the cornerstone for the current St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral on Fifth Avenue \u2014 the most lasting monument to his ministry.\n\nArchbishop Hughes was also a strong defender of Catholic rights against anti-immigration, Native American and Know-Nothing movements in the 1840s and 1850s. He packed Old St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in lower Manhattan in 1844 with his Catholic followers and prevented its destruction. Some of the enemies the Catholic prelate made were less easily intimidated. One fight in which Archbishop Hughes became engaged was with the owner of the New York Herald, James Gordon Bennett. Bennett\u2019s biographer, Don C. Seitz wrote: \u201cAs the Know-Nothing sentiment grew, the Archbishop became more virulent, thundering against Bennett in press and pulpit \u2014 rival editors being foolish enough to print his fulminations. He also, in effect, excommunicated the aggressive editor \u2014 all of which helped the Herald. Undauntedly the editor continued his crusade, and went so far as to demand the separation of the Catholic Church in America from the rule of Rome. He wanted an American church free from the overlordship of the hierarchy and argued at length.\u201d22 Archbishop Hughes returned the enmity, calling Bennett \u201ca very dangerous man.\u201d23\n\nWhen the draft riots hit New York City in July 1863, Governor Horatio Seymour asked a dying Archbishop Hughes to help restore order by speaking to his largely Irish flock from his Madison Avenue residence. Seymour wrote Hughes: \u201cI do not wish to ask you anything inconsistent with your duties, but if you can with propriety aid the civil authorities at this crisis, I hope you will do so. Historian Frank Klement wrote: \u201cArchbishop Hughes, in turn, wrote a letter and sent copies to the city\u2019s newspapers, hoping that the letters would be published and his advice heeded. He asked all \u2018Catholic rioters\u2019 to \u2018cease and desist\u2019 from mob action and \u2018unchristian practices,\u2019 and return to peaceful pursuits and bring \u2018the disorders\u2019 to an end. Then he circulated (via a flyer) stating that he would give \u2018a talk\u2019 next morning (the sixteenth) from the steps of his residence.\u201d24\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t until July 17, 1863, six days after the riots started, that Hughes gave the requested speech. The previous day he circulated a poster which said: \u201cMen! I am not able, owing to the rheumatism in my limbs to visit you, but that is not a reason why you should not pay me a visit in your whole strength. Come, then, tomorrow, Friday at 2 o\u2019clock to my residence, northwest corner of Madison Avenue and Thirty-sixth Street. There is abundant space for the meeting, around my house. I can address you from the corner balcony. If I should not be able to stand during its delivery, you will permit me to address you sitting; my voice is much stronger than my limbs. I take upon myself the responsibility of assuring you, that in paying me this visit or in retiring from it, you shall not be disturbed by any exhibition of municipal or military presence. You who are Catholics, or as many of you as are, having a right to visit your bishop without molestation.\u201d25\n\nHistorian Iver Bernstein wrote: \u201cOn Friday, Archbishop John Hughes, who believed slavery should be tolerated, gave a speech outside his residence in which he urged that change be made through legal means.\u201d Historian Frank Klement wrote that \u201ca crowd estimated at 5,000 assembled in front of Archbishop Hughes\u2019 residence. Suffering from rheumatism and a recent illness, and enfeebled with age, the revered churchman appeared, wearing the insignia of office. He addressed his flock as \u2018my friends,\u2019 saying that some had gone \u2018astray.\u2019 They were Catholics, he said, and so was he. They were Irish and so was he. The \u2018disturbances\u2019 must stop for the sake of their religion and for the sake of Ireland. \u2018Violence begets violence.\u2019 There was more. In closing, he asked \u2018all\u2019 to return peacefully to their homes and avoid mobs \u2018where immortal souls are launched into eternity.\u2019 After waving farewell, he limped back to his quarters. The crowd dispersed; its members returned peacefully and quietly to their houses and shacks.26 One Union officer, who worked to suppress the riot, later complained: \u201cSuch an effort, if made four days earlier, would have prevented incalculable suffering and loss.\u201d27 Hughes delivered what historian William Alan Bales called \u201ca good speech. But it came too late\u2026.The arrival of the military had made his talk academic\u201d Hughes told the crowd:\n\nEvery man has a right to defend his home or his shanty at the risk of life. The cause, however, must be just. It must not be aggressive or offensive. Do you want my advice? Well, I have been hurt by the report that you were rioters. You cannot imagine that I could hear these things without being grievously pained. Is there not some way by which you can stop these proceedings and support the laws, none of which have been enacted against you as Irishmen and Catholics? You have suffered already. No government can save itself unless it protects its citizens. Military force will be let loose upon you. The innocent will be shot down and the guilty will be likely to escape.28\n\nAccording to biographer Rena Mazyck Andrews, \u201cWhile it may be that the insurrection had very nearly spent its force before Hughes made his appeal, and that military coercion and the promise of suspension of the daft were the most effective of arguments, yet the rambling speech of the fast-aging prelate was not without significance. Like his August sermon, the Archbishop\u2019s message to the rioters was designed to reach a wider audience than his immediate hearers. It was a critical point in time and place, Hughes exerted his powerful influence to steady an allegiance that was wavering.\u201d29\n\nIn The Great Riots of New York City, John Tyler Headley asked: \u201cWhy Archbishop Hughes took no more active part than he did in quelling this insurrection, when there was scarcely a man in it except members of his own flock, seems strange. It is true he had published an address to them, urging them to keep the peace; but it was prefaced by a long, undignified, and angry attack on Mr. Greeley, of the Tribune, and showed that he was in sympathy with the rioters, at least in their condemnation of the draft. The pretence that it would be unsafe for him to pass through the streets, is absurd; for on three different occasions common priests had mingled with the mob, not only with impunity, but with good effect. He could not therefore, have thought himself to be in any great danger. One thing, at any rate, is evident: had an Irish mob threatened to burn down a Roman Catholic church, or a Roman Catholic orphan asylum, or threatened any of the institutions or property of the Roman Church, he would have shown no such backwardness or fear. The mob would have been confronted with the most terrible anathemas of the church, and those lawless bands quailed before the maledictions of the representative of \u2018God\u2019s viceregent on earth.'\u201d30\n\nHistorian Bales wrote that the Riots were \u201cneither a Catholic insurrection nor a Catholic plot. The rioters being mostly Irish immigrants were, of course, Catholic. But they were not bent on Catholic errands, although they were themselves sometimes confused and so some of the violence was done in the name of protection against heretics. But most of the police were Irish, too, and Catholic, and no police have ever worked harder or stood more resolute in the face of danger or showed more courage or devotion to duty than the police during those first three terrible days.\u201d31\n\nOver the next five months, Hughes\u2019 health continued to fail. His funeral in early January 1864 was a major public event in Civil War New York. Not everyone mourned. New York attorney and active Episcopalian lay leader, George Templeton Strong may have reflected elite WASP opinion: \u201cArchbishop Hughes is dead. Pity he survived last June and committed the imbecility of his address to the rioters last July. That speech blotted and spoiled a record which the Vatican must have held respectable, and against which Protestants had nothing to say, except, of course, \u2018Babylon,\u2019 \u2018Scarlet Woman,\u2019 and \u2018anti-christ.'\u201d32\n\nAccording to Carl Sandburg, the death of Archbishop Hughes took a political twist: Treasury Secretary Salmon P. \u201cChase took it on himself to see that the powers at Rome should, if possible, choose a proper prelate for the vacancy. And Chase wrote to the Most Reverend Archbishop Purcell of Cincinnati on February 1 letting that high official of the church know that he, Chase, was not idle: \u2018Deeply impressed with the importance of having a successor to Archbishop Hughes, of clear intellect and earnest sympathy with the poor, the oppressed, and enslaved, I ventured, without consulting you, to ask Governor [William] Dennison, when here some time ago, to name the subject to the President. He did so, as he informed me at the time. Subsequently, I spoke to the President myself. He mentioned that Governor Dennison had spoken to him \u2014 seemed pleased with the suggestion \u2014 and referred me to Mr. Seward. Today I have had a conversation with Mr. Seward, who expresses himself in relation to the subject, as I would wish.\u201d33"}, {"url": "https://news.fordham.edu/university-news/celebrating-the-180th-anniversary-of-fordhams-founding/", "page_content": "The elm-lined paths of the Rose Hill campus lead to a bronze statue of Fordham\u2019s founder, Archbishop John Hughes, dedicated on June 24, 1891.\n\nOn June 24, 1841, Bishop John Hughes opened St. John\u2019s College in the village of Fordham with just six students. It was the first Catholic institution of higher education in the Northeast. Five years later, the Jesuits took over the fledgling college, fulfilling the ardent hopes of Bishop Hughes, who\u2019d always wanted the school to be in Jesuit hands. In 1907, having achieved university status, St. John\u2019s College officially changed its name to Fordham University.\n\nToday, as we celebrate Fordham\u2019s auspicious founding, we reflect on the story of an Irish immigrant who sought to elevate his people\u2014and all immigrants\u2014with the promise of higher education. Below is a 2016 homily delivered by Monsignor Thomas J. Shelley, Ph.D., GSAS \u201966, professor emeritus of theology at Fordham.\n\nFounding Father: Archbishop John Hughes\n\nLady Chapel, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, June 24, 2016\n\n219 years ago today, on June 24, 1797, St. John\u2019s Day, Fordham\u2019s founding father, John Joseph Hughes, was born in the little village of Annalogan in County Tyrone, Ireland. \u201cThey told me when I was a boy,\u201d he said, \u201cthat for the first five days I was on a social and civil equality with the most favored subject of the British Empire. These five days would be the interval between my birth and my baptism.\u201d Once John Hughes was baptized a Catholic, however, like every Catholic in eighteenth-century Ireland, he immediately became a second-class citizen in the land of his birth.\n\nJohn Hughes also preserved another vivid childhood memory. When his younger sister died, after the funeral Mass, the parish priest led the funeral procession to the local cemetery, which was the property of the Protestant Church of Ireland. Catholic priests were forbidden by law from entering these cemeteries. And so, outside the gate of the cemetery, the parish priest bent down, scooped up a clump of earth in his hands, blessed it, and handed it to Hughes\u2019s father to sprinkle it over his daughter\u2019s coffin as it was lowered into the grave. Childhood memories of this kind are not easily erased, and John Hughes never forgot this example of the prejudice suffered by Catholics in his native land.\n\nJohn Hughes spent the first twenty years of his life in Ireland as the son of a poor Ulster farmer where he experienced not only prejudice but also the grinding poverty that prevented him from obtaining more than a rudimentary education. When he emigrated to America in 1817, he worked in the only occupations for which he was qualified, as a laborer in the construction trades and in quarries. When he applied for admission to a seminary to study for the priesthood, he had to spend his first year in remedial studies in order to qualify for the entrance requirements.\n\nExposure to prejudice and poverty was not limited to John Hughes. It was the common experience of Irish Catholics both in their homeland and in America. However, the difference was that America was the land of opportunity for immigrants, if they had the education to take advantage of these opportunities. This was one of the primary motives that led Bishop Hughes to establish St. John\u2019s College at Fordham in 1841. He considered education the indispensable means for the members of his immigrant flock to break loose from the cycle of poverty that ensnared them and that prevented them from participating in what today we would call the American dream. John Hughes\u2019s first biographer, John Hassard, a graduate of St. John\u2019s College, Fordham, in 1855, and Hughes\u2019s former secretary who knew him well, said, \u201cThe subject that of all others that [Hughes] had nearest his heart was education.\u201d\n\nA public official who saw what Hughes was doing and came to admire him greatly was William Seward, the politically astute governor of New York State. Later, as secretary of state during the Civil War, Seward became the indispensable man in Lincoln\u2019s cabinet. Governor Seward told Hughes, \u201cYou have begun a great work in the elevation of the rejected immigrant, a work auspicious to the destiny of that class and still more beneficial to our common country.\u201d Incidentally Hughes never made a distinction between Catholic and non-Catholic immigrants. He framed the issue this way, that foreign-born American citizens should enjoy the same legal rights as native-born American citizens.\n\nBishop Hughes became the effective leader of New York Catholics in June 1839. Only two months later he made his first major decision when he purchased 106 acres at Rose Hill for a college, which confirms the statement of John Hassard that \u201cthe subject of all others that [Hughes] had nearest his heart was education.\u201d The price of the real estate was $30,000 ($29,750) and Hughes needed an additional $10,000 to renovate the two buildings on the property. \u201cI had not, when I purchased the site of this new college, St. John\u2019s, Fordham,\u201d Bishop Hughes said, \u201cso much as a penny wherewith to commence the payment for it.\u201d He immediately launched a fund-raising campaign among New York\u2019s impoverished Catholics. After nine months the campaign netted a paltry $10,000. Hughes then went to Europe on a ten-month begging trip, and generous Catholics in France and Austria contributed the money that he needed to start St. John\u2019s College at Fordham.\n\nJohn Hughes\u2019s new college opened its doors 175 years ago today, on St. John\u2019s Day, June 24, 1841, with a grand total of six students. The faculty was larger than the student body. For the next five years Hughes struggled to maintain his college as a diocesan institution with a faculty of New York diocesan priests, but it was a losing battle. There were four presidents in five years. One president became a cardinal, another became an archbishop, but neither of them was a professional educator.\n\nThen there was a third diocesan priest as president, the ineffable and eminently forgettable Ambrose Manahan, a scatterbrain cleric whom Hughes dismissed for incompetence. When Hughes gave him his walking papers, he sent him this priceless letter, \u201cI advise you to resign . . . in the almost extinguished hope that, on a new scene where your future character will be determined by your future conduct, you may disappoint the melancholy anticipations that the past is too well calculated to inspire.\u201d Fordham\u2019s founding father may not have had much formal education, but he certainly possessed the innate Irish gift of eloquence.\n\nFordham\u2019s fourth and most capable diocesan president was a young cleric named Father John Harley, but he died at the age of twenty-nine, a not uncommon occurrence at that time because of the rigors of seminary education. Hughes had no one among his own diocesan clergy to replace Harley, and so in 1845 he turned to the Society of Jesus, an international order of scholars with a reputation as professional educators, to take charge of his fledgling college. The Jesuits in turn were happy to establish a foothold in the largest city in the United States.\n\nAlthough St. John\u2019s College remained a diocesan college for only five years, we rightly honor Archbishop John Hughes today as our founding father. It was he who purchased the property at Rose Hill, raised the funds to pay for it, recruited the original faculty and administration, obtained the state charter and left to the Jesuits a flourishing little college whose ownership they were happy to obtain. It was no mean accomplishment even for a man of the stature of John Joseph Hughes.\n\nI do not think that the influence of John Hughes on Fordham University is limited to the past. In many respects he remains an inspiration for us today. For example, you are all familiar with the statue of Archbishop Hughes outside Cunniffe House on the Rose Hill campus. That statue was the gift of the alumni on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of St. John\u2019s College, Fordham, in 1891. Many of the alumni would have known Hughes when they were students. Hughes had only been dead for 27 years.\n\nThe alumni wanted these words of John Hughes to be engraved on the pedestal of the statue: \u201cI have always preached that every denomination, Jews, Christians, Catholics, Protestants\u2014of every shade and sex\u2014were all entitled to entire freedom of conscience, without let or hindrance from any sect or number of sects, no matter how small their number or how unpopular the doctrine that they profess.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately those words of John Hughes were not engraved on the pedestal of his statue perhaps, perhaps\u2014and here I am only guessing\u2014because the theologically conservative Jesuit Fathers at Fordham considered John Hughes\u2019s words to be too bold and radical. They certainly would have set off alarm bells in the Vatican. However, in 1965, the Second Vatican Council effectively if posthumously endorsed those words of Archbishop Hughes in its Declaration on Religious Liberty and in Nostra Aetate, the council\u2019s document on the relationship between the Catholic Church and the Jewish people. Isn\u2019t it inspiring to know that, at least in this all-important area of freedom of conscience, our founding father anticipated the work of the Second Vatican Council by a whole century?\n\nJohn Hughes was no Mother Theresa. He will never be canonized because, among his many other qualities, he was a tough and feisty street fighter who gave no quarter and asked no quarter in an often hostile environment. In 1844 a Nativist mob unleashed several days of rioting and violence on the Catholic community in Philadelphia. They then threatened to do the same thing in New York City. Bishop Hughes told the Nativist mayor of New York City, James Harper, that, if any harm came to his churches, he would turn the city into \u201ca second Moscow,\u201d a reference to the destruction of Moscow by the Russians in 1812 when Napoleon attacked the city.\n\nThat does not sound like Mother Theresa. To be honest, it is also far removed from the spirit of the Sermon on the Mount. But it worked and may be justified on the grounds that it preserved peace and law and order. The Nativist leaders backed down and disbanded their mob and spared New York City from the violence that only days earlier had engulfed the city of Philadelphia.\n\nMany historians have criticized Archbishop Hughes for his bellicose style of leadership, but at least one distinguished historian of American Catholicism, Monsignor John Tracy Ellis, offered a more nuanced appraisal of John Hughes\u2019s leadership. Ellis said that \u201cthere were times when [Hughes\u2019s\u2019] very aggressiveness was about the only approach that would serve the end that he was seeking, viz., justice for his people.\u201d An integral element in his quest to obtain justice for his people and to give them economic and social equality in American society was to give them access to higher education. That is why he went to such great pains to establish the university whose 175th anniversary we celebrate today.\n\nIt is difficult to envision anyone else in the Catholic community in nineteenth-century New York City who could have accomplished what Archbishop John Hughes did for \u201cthe elevation of the rejected immigrant\u201d (to quote again Governor William Seward). A key element in Archbishop Hughes\u2019s plan to elevate the rejected immigrant was to give them the opportunity for a college education. We all owe him a great debt of gratitude for establishing St. John\u2019s College at Rose Hill, the future Fordham University. It is a debt that we gladly acknowledge today and will continue to acknowledge and repeat in many different ways over the course of the next twelve months.\n\nThomas J. Shelley"}, {"url": "https://www.catholic.com/encyclopedia/john-hughes", "page_content": "Returning from Europe , whither he had gone in 1839 to seek aid for his diocese, Bishop Hughes found his flock involved in a movement to modify the existing common school system, which, professing to be non-sectarian, was undermining, in fact, the religious belief of Catholic children. The bishop immediately placed himself at the head of the movement, and deemed it incumbent on him to oppose the Public School Society , a private corporation controlling the management of the schools and the distribution of the school fund provided by the municipality. He based his objection to this society on the ground that it violated a fundamental American principle, namely, freedom of conscience. Catholics could not accept any system of education which ignored, undermined, or opposed the religious faith their conscience dictated to be true. After a two years\u2019 unceasing contest, he finally brought about the overthrow of the Public School Society . He had hoped, and Governor Seward was kindly disposed, that the Legislature might be so truly American as to sanction and support separate Catholic schools. Religious animosity proved too bitter. The bishop\u2019s hopes were not realized. The establishment of the present public schools followed, which, likewise failing to satisfy Catholic conscience, led the bishop to lay the foundation, on a firm basis, of the existing Catholic school system in New York . An anti- Catholic outbreak of the \u201cNative American\u201d political party occurred in 1844, in Philadelphia , where churches and convents were destroyed. A meeting of this party was announced to take place in New York City. Apprehensive that the result would be riot and bloodshed, the bishop called personally on the mayor of the city to prevent the meeting, warning him of the consequences if any anti- Catholic outrage were attempted. He at the same time solemnly cautioned his flock against violence, but took measures to resist any possible attacks against church property. His fearless and determined attitude prevented the holding of the meeting and averted disturbance of the peace. Ten years later the \u201cKnow-nothing\u201d faction became active. He again advised his people to keep aloof from centers of trouble. He was deeply convinced that all such movements, being as anti-American as they were anti- Catholic , could not possibly thrive in the United States.\n\nThe abolition of trusteeism in New York marked the beginning of his episcopate. He confronted a critical diocesan condition arising from differences between Bishop Dubois (q.v.) and the lay trustees whose control of church revenues was working injury to religion, and had encumbered the ten churches then in the city with a debt of $300,000, a crushing burden in those days. Bishop Hughes\u2019s experience in Philadelphia with trusteeism served him well in taking up the defense of Bishop Dubois. He appealed directly to the people, before whom he forcefully defended the Divine authority to govern granted by Christ to the hierarchy, and clearly exposed the viciousness of lay domination in the administration of church matters. The people readily passed a resolution condemning the cathedral trustees who gave way to a new board well disposed to obey ecclesiastical authority. The bishop convoked in 1841 the first Diocesan Synod of New York , which enacted timely legislation affecting spiritual matters, and devised for the tenure and administration of church property wise regulations which placed the rector of the church in control of temporals as well as spirituals. His triumph over the trustee system would have been complete and final at the very outset had the trustees of St. Louis\u2019s church, Buffalo, been as prompt to submit as all others. Their attitude brought the archbishop, as late as 1855, into a controversy with Erastus Brooks, editor and state senator, who assailed in the Legislature the archbishop\u2019s plan of holding church property. Unfavorable legislation followed, but was soon repealed, and prepared the way for the present satisfactory religious corporation law of the State of New York .\n\nHughes, JOHN, fourth Bishop and first Archbishop of New York , b. at Annaloghan, Co. Tyrone, Ireland , June 24, 1797, of Patrick Hughes and Margaret McKenna; d. in New York , January 3, 1864. His father, a farmer of limited means, immigrated to the United States in 1816, and settled at Chambersburg, Pa. John\u2019s early education was received at a school in Augher, and later in Auchnacloy, near his native village. Though he felt called to the priesthood, circumstances did not permit him to continue his studies; being disinclined to farm life, he was placed with a friend of his father to study horticulture. He followed his father to America in 1817, landed at Baltimore, and soon after went to Chambersburg, where he aided his family for a year or more. His ardent desire to become a priest brought him in 1819 to Mount St. Mary\u2019s College , Emmitsburg, Md\u2014which he entered as an employee, being received a year later as a student. Ordained to the priesthood October 15, 1826, by Bishop Conwell, in St. Joseph \u2018s Church , Philadelphia , he labored first at St. Augustine\u2019s, Philadelphia , later at Bedford, Pa\u2014finally returning to Philadelphia to become pastor of St. Joseph \u2018s, and afterwards of St. Mary\u2019s, whose trustees were in open revolt against the bishop, and were subdued by Father Hughes only when he built St. Joseph \u2018s church, 1832, then considered one of the finest in the country. Previous to this, in 1829, he founded St. John\u2019s Orphan Asylum. About this period he was engaged in a religious controversy with Rev. John A. Breckenridge, a distinguished Presbyterian clergyman, with the result that Father Hughes\u2019s remarkable ability attracted widespread attention and admiration. His name was mentioned for the vacant See of Cincinnati and for the Coadjutorship of Philadelphia . On January 7, 1838, however, Father Hughes was consecrated Bishop of Basileopolis and Coadjutor of New York , by Bishop Dubois, in St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral , Mott Street, New York . In 1839 he became administrator Apostolic of New York , and on the death of Bishop Dubois succeeded to the vacant see, December 20, 1842. He was raised to the dignity of first Archbishop of New York , July 19, 1850, receiving the pallium personally from Pius IX at Rome , April 3, 1851.\n\nFew public men of his day possessed a more statesmanlike grasp of the genius of the American Republic. He had unbounded confidence in its institutions, when their very existence was precarious. He looked upon America as a land of promise opened by a beneficent Providence to the oppressed of the nations. No one could question his own abiding love of his native soil; but he would not permit this love to make him lament as an exile of Erin when he might rejoice as an American citizen. Thus he taught his people. So far-seeing was he in this respect that he looked with disfavor on national churches, lest they might perpetuate racial differences and foreign customs. All must be formed into a common people; and no influence could do this better for the American people, he contended, than the Catholic Church sent by Christ to teach all nations. Archbishop Hughes will ever rank among America\u2018s foremost citizens. His towering character, genius for government, and intense patriotism won for him the respect and often the admiration of his opponents, the esteem and even the life-long friendship of distinguished statesmen. President Polk, through Secretary Buchanan, in 1846, proffered him a diplomatic mission to Mexico, which he was unable to accept. On invitation of John Quincy Adams, Stephen A. Douglas, and John C. Calhoun, he lectured in 1847 before Congress in the Capitol, Washington, his topic being \u201cChristianity the only Source of Moral, Social, and Political Regeneration\u201c. At the outbreak of the Civil War, although not an abolitionist, he boldly sustained the Union cause, and was in frequent communication with William H. Seward, Secretary of State, to whom he offered useful suggestions on the conduct of the war. President Lincoln, in an auto-graph letter, expressed his appreciation of the counsel given. Secretary Seward, desiring to hold France in a friendly attitude towards the Federal Government, entrusted the archbishop with an important mission to the Court of Napoleon III, who received him most graciously, and was dissuaded by him from recognizing the Confederacy. On this visit to Europe, wherever he went, he left nothing undone to create sympathy for the Union side. During the Draft Riots of 1863 in New York City, Governor Seymour invoked the aid of the archbishop to suppress disorder, to which invitation, though he was fatally broken in health, he willingly responded, addressing a large assemblage from the balcony of his residence.\n\nHis loyalty to his adopted country was well balanced and finely adjusted to the duties and responsibilities of his sacred office. He exercised the strictest vigilance lest American liberty might engender liberal influences tending to minimize the doctrine and discipline of the Catholic Church. He unsparingly condemned those who, through fear of anti-Catholic feeling, were disposed to conciliate their opponents by seemingly harm-less concessions. He was intolerant of the slightest modification or innovation in religion unless sanctioned by the Supreme Head of the Church. He believed that adherence to Catholic faith should be bold, fearless, out-spoken, and uncompromising in the extreme, and especially so in the face of opposition. Pius IX, exiled in 1848, and again threatened in 1860, found the archbishop one of the stanchest defenders of the Holy See. Strong agencies of power and influence were conspiring against the temporal sovereignty of the pope, and this alarming condition intimidated not a few Catholics into a policy of silent and ineffective sympathy; others somewhat less timid favored action, but of a conservative character. The archbishop approved of no such methods, and boldly proclaimed himself an uncompromising supporter of the Vicar of Christ and his lawful patrimony. By appeal, sermon, lecture, and pastoral letter he aroused his flock at home to unbounded enthusiasm, and stirred Christendom abroad in a masterly vindication of the temporal independence of the sovereign pontiff. He raised in 1860 the princely sum of $53,000, as an offering from his diocese to the Holy Father; and his pastoral letter, circulated throughout Europe and translated into Italian, afforded solace to the afflicted soul of Pius IX.\n\nConjointly with all this prominence and activity demanded by public and vital interests of Church and nation, the archbishop followed faithfully and zealously the exacting life of a hardworking missionary bishop in the upbuilding of a rapidly growing diocese. In 1842 there were some forty priests, fifty churches, and 200,000 Catholics scattered over his jurisdiction, which embraced the State of New York and the eastern part of New Jersey. Bishop McCloskey, later the first Bishop of Albany, was Coadjutor of New York from 1844 to 1847. Albany and Buffalo were erected into episcopal sees in 1847; Brooklyn and Newark in 1853. Besides these four separate dioceses made within the original territory of the Diocese of New York, the archbishop before his death in 1864 ruled 150 priests, 85 churches, 3 colleges, 50 schools and academies, and over 400,000 people. He stated in 1858 that he had dedicated his ninety-ninth church. As metropolitan, created in 1850, he presided over New York, New Jersey, and all New England, with suffragan sees at Albany, Buffalo, Brooklyn, Newark, Boston, Burlington, Hartford, and Portland. The First Provincial Council of New York was convened in September, 1854, after which the archbishop journeyed to Rome and he was present at the proclamation of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception.\n\nDuring his administration institutions of charity and higher learning grew apace with churches and schools. The seminary was moved in 1840 from Lafargeville to Fordham, where a college also was opened a year later. The Jesuits assumed charge of it in 1846, but in 1855 the archbishop withdrew the seminary from Fordham, and in 1862 secured property at Troy, New York, for the establishment of St. Joseph\u2018s Provincial Seminary. He also proved to be one of the warmest supporters of the North American College, Rome, projected by Pius IX in 1855, and successfully opened in 1859. To meet diocesan needs he introduced into New York the Christian Brothers, the Religious of the Sacred Heart, the Sisters of Mercy, the Ursulines, the Sisters of Notre Dame, and the Sisters of the Good Shepherd. Finding the Sisters of Charity of Emmitsburg, Maryland, who were laboring in New York, restricted by their rule to a limited field and restrained from undertaking certain good works which the archbishop desired, he organized an independent diocesan community of the Sisters of Charity, who, today, are managing a variety of educational, charitable, protective, and industrial institutions, and form one of the most flourishing and successful sisterhoods in the United States. Foreseeing the future greatness of his diocese and cathedral city, he planned the erection of a cathedral which would be commensurate with the importance of the city and See of New York, and would express in enduring stone the faith of his flock. He laid the cornerstone of St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, Fifth Avenue, August 15, 1858; this lofty and inspiring pile stands a monument to his genius and prevision.\n\nHe lived and passed away amid stirring times; it was providential for Church and country that he lived when he did. His natural gifts of mind and heart, independent of his education, were of a high order and made him pre-eminent in leadership; not only was he a great ruler of an important diocese in a hierarchy remarkable for distinguished bishops, but also a master-builder of the Church in the United States and one of the most helpful and sagacious of the makers of America. Church and nation are indebted forever to the prelate and citizen whose strong personality, indomitable courage, and invaluable service constituted him the man needed in his day to meet critical conditions. He was resolute, fearless, far-sighted, and full of practical wisdom based on the sanest and soundest principles. To bring out the innate power within him required but the opportunity presented by the Church struggling for a footing in a rather hostile community, and by the nation endeavoring to cope with harassing questions at home and impending trouble abroad. His failures were few; his achievements many and lasting. He was feared and loved; misunderstood and idolized; misrepresented even to his ecclesiastical superiors in Rome, whose confidence in him, however, remained unshaken. Severe of manner, kindly of heart, he was not aggressive until assailed.\n\nHe was a forceful, impressive, and convincing speaker, an able, resourceful, and talented controversialist, a clear, logical, and direct writer. His writings were usually hastily done, as occasion required, but commanded general attention from friend and opponent. His works are published in two volumes, which contain lectures, sermons, and pamphlets on historical and doctrinal subjects; open letters to public men like Horace Greeley, General Cass, Mayor Harper, Senator Brooks; and \u201cKirwan Unmasked\u201d, a series of six letters to a Presbyterian minister, writing under the assumed name of Kirwan; these letters are considered models of good English and are among the best written by the archbishop. His mortal remains were interred in old St. Patrick\u2019s, but were transferred, January 30, 1883, to their final resting-place under the sanctuary of the cathedral in Fifth Avenue. His death elicited a general expression of sympathy and respect, and his memory was honored by tributes from President Lincoln, Secretary Seward, Governor Seymour, and the Common Council of New York.\n\nP.

He had hoped, and Governor Seward was kindly disposed, that the Legislature might be so truly American as to sanction and support Catholic schools. Religious animosity proved too bitter. The bishop's hopes were not realized. The establishment of the present public school system followed, which likewise, failing to satisfy Catholic conscience, led the bishop to lay the foundation, on a firm basis, of the existing Catholic school system in New York. An anti-Catholic outbreak of the \"Native American\" political party occurred in 1844, in Philadelphia, where churches and convents were destroyed. A meeting of this party was announced to take place in New York City. Apprehensive that the result would be riot and bloodshed, the bishop called personally on the mayor of the city to prevent the meeting. Warning him of the consequences if any anti-Catholic outrage were attempted. He at the same time solemnly cautioned his flock against violence, but took measures to resist any attack against church property. His fearless determined attitude prevented the holding of the meeting and averted disturbance of the peace. Ten years later the \"Know-nothing\" faction became active. He again advised his people to keep aloof from the centres of trouble. He was deeply convinced that all such movements, being as anti-American as they were anti-Catholic, could not possible thrive in the United States.\n\nFew public men of his day possessed a more statesmanlike grasp of the genius of the American Republic. He had unbounded confidence in its institutions, when their very existence was precarious. He looked upon America as a land of promise opened by a beneficent xxyyyk.htm\">Providence to the oppressed of the nations. No one would question his own abiding love of his native soil; but he would not permit this love to make him lament as an exile of Erin when he might rejoice as an American citizen. Thus he taught his people. So far-seeing was he in this respect that he looked with disfavor upon national churches, lest they might perpetrate racial differences and foreign customs. All must be formed into a common people; and no influence could do this better for the American people, he contended, than the Catholic Church sent by Christ to teach all nations. Archbishop Hughes will ever rank among America's foremost citizens. His towering character, genius for government, and intense patriotism won for him the respect and often the admiration of his opponents, the esteem and even the lifelong friendship of distinguished statesmen. President Polk, through Secretary Buchanan, in 1846, proffered him a diplomatic mission to Mexico, which he was unable to accept. On invitation of John Quincy Adams, Stephen A. Douglas, and John C. Calhoun, he lectured before Congress in the Capitol, Washington, his topic being \"Christianity, the Only Source of Moral Social and Political Regeneration\". At the outbreak of the Civil War, although not an abolitionist, he boldly sustained the Union cause, and was in frequent communication with William H. Seward, Secretary of State, to whom he offered useful suggestions on the conduct of the war. President Lincoln, in an autograph letter, expressed his appreciation of the counsel given. Secretary Seward, desiring to hold France in a friendly attitude towards the Federal Government, entrusted the archbishop with an important mission to the court of Napoleon III, who received him most graciously, and was dissuaded by him from recognizing the Confederacy. On this visit to Europe, wherever he went, he left nothing undone to create sympathy for the Union side. During the Draft Riots of 1863 in New York City, Governor Seymour invoked the aid of the archbishop to suppress disorder, to which invitation, though he was fatally broken in health, he willingly responded, addressing a large assemblage from the balcony of his residence.\n\nWe ask you, humbly: don't scroll away.

He exercised the strictest vigilance lest American liberty might engender liberal influence tending to minimize the doctrine and discipline of the Catholic Church. He unsparingly condemned those who, through fear of anti-Catholic feeling, were disposed to conciliate their opponents by seemingly harmless concessions. He was intolerant of the slightest modification or innovation in religion unless sanctioned by the Supreme Head of the Church. He believed that the adherence to Catholic faith should be bold, fearless, outspoken and uncompromising in the extreme, and especially so in the face of opposition. Pius IX, exiled in 1848, and again threatened in 1860, found the archbishop one of his staunchest defenders of the Holy See. Strong agencies of power and influence were conspiring against the temporal sovereignty of the pope, and this condition intimidated not a few Catholics into a policy of silent and ineffective sympathy; others somewhat less timid favored action, but of a conservative character. The archbishop approved of no such methods, and boldly proclaimed himself an uncompromising supporter of the Vicar of Christ and his lawful patrimony. By appeal, sermon, lecture, and pastoral letter he aroused his flock at home to unbounded enthusiasm, and stirred Christendom abroad in a masterly vindication of the temporal independence of the sovereign pontiff. He raised in 1860 the princely sum of $53,000, as an offering from his diocese to the Holy Father; and his pastoral letter, circulated throughout Europe and translated in Italian, afforded solace to the afflicted soul of Pius IX.\n\nConjointly with all this prominence and activity demanded by public and vital interests of Church and nation, the archbishop followed faithfully and zealously the exacting life of a hardworking missionary bishop in the upbuilding of a rapidly growing diocese. In 1842 there were some forty priests, fifty churches and 200,000 Catholics scattered over his jurisdiction, which embraced the State of New York and eastern part of New Jersey. Bishop McClosky, later the first bishop of Albany, was Coadjutor of New York from 1844 to 1847. Albany and Buffalo were erected into episcopal sees in 1847; Brooklyn and Newark in 1853. Besides these four separate dioceses made up within the original territory of the diocese of New York, the archbishop before his death in 1864 ruled 150 priests, 85 churches, 3 colleges, 50 schools and academies and over 400,000 people. He stated in 1858 that he had dedicated his 99th church. As metropolitan, created in 1850, he presided over New York, New Jersey and all New England, with suffragan sees at Albany, Buffalo, Brooklyn, Newark, Boston, Burlington, Hartford and Portland. The First Provincial Council of New York was convened in September, 1854, after which the archbishop journeyed to Rome and he was present at the proclamation of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception.\n\nDuring his administration institutions of charity and higher learning grew apace with churches and schools. The seminary was moved in 1840 from Largerville to Fordham, where a college was opened a year later. The Jesuits assumed charge of it in 1846, but in 1855 the archbishop withdrew the seminary from Fordham, and in 1862 secured property at Troy, New York, for the establishment of St. Joseph's Provincial Seminary. He also proved to be one of the warmest supporters of the North American College, Rome, projected by Pius IX in 1855, and successfully opened in 1859. To meet diocesan needs he introduced into New York the Christian Brothers , the Religious of the Sacred Heart, the Sisters of Mercy, the Ursulines, the Sisters of Notre Dame, and the Sisters of the Good Shepherd. Finding the Sisters of Charity of Emmitsburg, Maryland, who were labouring in New York, restricted by their rule to a limited field and refrained from undertaking certain good works which the archbishop desired, he organized an independent diocesan community of Sisters of Charity, who today, are managing a variety of educational, charitable, protective and industrial institutions, and form one of the most flourishing and successful sisterhoods in the United States . Foreseeing the future greatness of his diocese and cathedral city, he planned the erection of a cathedral which would be commensurate with the importance of the city and See of New York, and would express in enduring stone the faith of his flock. He laid the cornerstone of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Fifth Avenue, 15 August 1858; this lofty and inspiring pile stands as a monument to his genius and prevision.\n\nHe lived and passed away amid stirring times; it was providential for church and country that he lived when he did. His natural gifts of mind and heart, independent of his education, were of a high order and made him pre-eminent in leadership; not only was he a great ruler of an important diocese in a hierarchy remarkable for distinguished bishops, but also a master-builder of the Church in the United States and one of the most helpful and sagacious of the makers of America. Church and nation are indebted forever to the prelate and citizen whose strong personality, and indomitable courage and invaluable service constituted him the man needed in his day to meet critical conditions. He was resolute, fearless, far-sighted and full of practical wisdom based on the sanest and soundest principles. To bring out the innate powers within him required but the opportunity presented by the Church struggling for a footing in a rather hostile community, and by the nation endeavoring to cope with harassing questions at home and impending trouble abroad. His failures were few; his achievements many and lasting. He was feared and loved ; misunderstood and idolized; misrepresented even to his ecclesiastical superiors in Rome, whose confidence in him, however, remained unshaken. Severe of manner, kindly of heart, he was not aggressive until assailed.\n\nHe was a forceful, impressive and convincing speaker; an able, resourceful and talented controversialist, a clear, logical and direct writer. His writing were usually hastily done, as occasion required, but commanded general attention from friend and opponent His works are published in two volumes, which contain lectures, sermons, and pamphlets on historical and doctrinal subjects; open letters to men like Horace Greeley, General Cass, Mayor Harper, Senator Brooks and \"Kirwin Unmasked\", a series of six letters to a Presbyterian minister, writing under the assumed name of Kirwin; these letters are considered models of good English and are among the best written by the archbishop. His mortal remains were interred in the old St. Patrick's but were transferred 30 January, 1883 to their final resting place under the sanctuary of the cathedral in Fifth Avenue. His death elicited a general expression of sympathy and respect, and his memory was honored by tributes from President Lincoln and Secretary Seward, Governor Seymour and the Common Council of New York."}, {"url": "https://www.libraryireland.com/biography/ArchbishopJohnHughes.php", "page_content": "Archbishop John Hughes\n\nAlfred Webb A Compendium of Irish Biography\n\nHughes, John, Archbishop of New York, was born in the parish of Errigal Trough, County of Monaghan, in 1798. He has written of his boyhood: \"My schoolboy days were spent among my neighbours who were not Catholics; but I think if I had been reared in the most Catholic portion of the island, I could not have been surrounded with kinder or more gallant friends than the scholars, of whom there were not a dozen Catholics.\" His father, a respectable farmer, emigrated to the United States in 1817, and John was placed with a florist. He devoted his spare time to study, entered a Catholic seminary in Maryland, and in 1825 was ordained a priest. As a preacher he soon distinguished himself, and was elected a member of various literary societies. In 1838 he was consecrated Coadjutor Bishop of New York, and in 1842, upon the death of Bishop Dubois, was confirmed in the see. Already he had made a tour through France, Austria, and Italy, to collect funds for the spread of his faith in the United States. In 1850 New York was made an archbishopric, and he was created the first Archbishop, as his countryman Archbishop Kenrick had been created first Primate of the United States.\n\nHe was a bitter opponent of the abolitionists, and a strenuous apologist for slavery. Drake says: \"He was prominent in the effort made by the Catholics to modify the existing school-system in their favour, and was successful.\" In 1847 he delivered, by request, before Congress an address \u2014 \"Christianity the only source of moral, social, and political regeneration.\" The organization and extension of Catholicism through the United States was largely due to his statesmanlike abilities. He was ever devoted to the cause of Irish nationality, and when the report reached New York in 1848 that Ireland was in insurrection, a public meeting was held to subscribe funds. \"I attended,\" says Bishop Hughes, \"to show, that in my conscience I have no scruple in aiding this cause in every way worthy a patriot and a Christian.\" \"My contribution shall be for a shield, not for a sword,\" he added, \"but you can contribute for what you choose.\" After the breaking out of the Civil War in 1861, he was by the United States government sent on a mission to Europe to counteract the intrigues of the Confederates. He does not appear to have been the author of any works beyond lectures and pamphlets. Archbishop Hughes died in New York, 3rd January 1864, aged 66. His sister Ellen (Mother Angela), who died two years after him, was for many years superioress of a New York hospital, and during the war was active in aiding the Sanitary Commission.\n\nSources\n\n37a.
