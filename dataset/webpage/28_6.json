{"Gordon David Strachan won three consecutive Scottish Premier League titles.": [{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/14/gordon-strachan-scotland-manager", "page_content": "The Scottish Football Association has called a news conference for midday on Tuesday, when Gordon Strachan is expected to be named the new manager of the national team.\n\nThe 55-year-old, who has been out of work since leaving Middlesbrough in October 2010, has been in negotiation with the SFA with regards to his salary and contract length since the turn of the year. Although those conditions remain unclear, Strachan will be handed at least the remainder of Scotland's failed 2014 World Cup qualification campaign plus the country's attempt to make it to the 2016 European Championship.\n\nScotland have not appeared at a major finals since 1998, a matter which has had a negative impact on public confidence towards the SFA and the governing body's financial position. The SFA has also been heavily criticised for its role in the deeply unpopular reforms of Scotland's domestic set-up.\n\nStrachan was immediately the favoured choice of senior figures within the SFA and among the country's international football support after the inevitable sacking of Craig Levein. Under Levein, Scotland failed to qualify for last summer's European Championship and made an abysmal start to the 2014 campaign; they lie bottom of Group A with two points from four matches.\n\nStrachan was the country's outstanding candidate, with Joe Jordan, who has joined Harry Redknapp at Queens Park Rangers, and Owen Coyle only tentatively mentioned as alternatives. Alex McLeish was briefly quoted, but distanced himself from a return to the Scotland role and has been appointed as the manager of Nottingham Forest.\n\nStrachan, when asked directly about the Scotland job, which will be his first in international management, said in November: \"It's quite simple really \u2013 it would be an honour to be asked to be the manager of your own national side; it's terrific.\"\n\nLevein remains in a legal dispute with the SFA in relation to the remainder of his contract. The association has been seeking to retain Levein on its payroll but the 48-year-old wants the balance of his contract paid up.\n\nStrachan has been employed as a pundit by ITV since leaving Middlesbrough. His 12-month spell in the north-east was less than distinguished, with Boro 20th in the Championship when he left, their lowest position for two decades. Of 46 games in charge after he succeeded Gareth Southgate, Strachan won only 13 and, according to the chairman, Steve Gibson, was so chastened by the experience he refused any compensation, despite having two and a half years left on his contract.\n\nBefore that, Strachan managed Coventry City, Southampton and Celtic. He was relegated with Coventry but bounced back with Southampton, whom he took to the 2003 FA Cup final where they lost 1\u20130 to Arsenal.\n\nStrachan took a 16-month break after resigning from Southampton in 2004 before becoming manager of Celtic, where he won three successive league titles before resigning in May 2009 after failing to win a fourth title."}, {"url": "https://www.thecelticwiki.com/managers/strachan-gordon/", "page_content": "Personal\n\nFullname: Gordon David Strachan\n\naka: Gordon Strachan, WGS (Wee Gordon Strachan)\n\nHeight: 5.06\n\nWeight: 10.06\n\nBorn: 9 Feb 1957\n\nBirthplace: Muirhouse, Edinburgh, Scotland\n\nPosition (as a player): RHS Midfielder (attacking)\n\nInternationals (as a player): Scotland\n\nInternational Caps (as a player): 50 caps\n\nInternational Goals (as a player): 5 goals\n\nManager: 1 June 2005 \u2013 25 May 2009\n\nSucceeding: Martin O\u2019Neill\n\nSuccessor: Tony Mowbray\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if there is another big club where the supporters have a love like the supporters have a love for this club.\u201d\n\nWGS on the Celtic fans (quote taken from \u201cCeltic Minded 2\u201d (book), 2006)\n\nPlayer\n\nDuring his playing career he played for\n\nDundee (1974-1977),\n\nAberdeen (1977-1984),\n\nManchester United (1984-1989),\n\nLeeds United (1989-1995) and\n\nCoventry City (1995-1997).\n\nHe won 50 international caps for Scotland and is in the Scotland Football Hall of Fame.\n\nGordon Strachan was an aggressive, skilful right-sided midfield player. He never played for Celtic as a player, and generally was not the most popular opposition player. Nippy and aggressive, he irked some of the Celtic support but mostly it was due to his ability as being just a great player for Aberdeen during a golden period for them.\n\nOverall, he was a great entertaining Scottish player and the Celtic support appreciated that at least.\n\nManagement\n\nWGS became Coventry City\u2019s Director of Football in November 1996.\n\nHe finally retired as a player at the end of the season after making his last appearance at the age of 40, a record in the English Premiership.\n\nStrachan kept Coventry in the Premiership until 2001, when they finally went down after 34 years of top division football. He was sacked shortly after the start of the 2001-02 Division One campaign.\n\nGordon Strachan returned to management within weeks, taking the manager\u2019s job at Southampton \u2013 after Strachan\u2019s appointment in October 2001, they finished 11th in the Premiership.\n\nIn 2002-03 when they finished eighth and reached the FA Cup final, where they lost 1-0 to Arsenal, but since Arsenal had qualified for the UEFA Champions League, Southampton qualified for the 2003-04 UEFA Cup.\n\nIn March 2004, Gordon Strachan announced his resignation as Southampton manager, earlier than intended because he wanted to spend time with his family.\n\nWhen Berti Vogts stepped down as Scottish national coach, Strachan was widely tipped to take over until Walter \u201cWattie\u201d Smith got the job, and he was even linked with the manager\u2019s job at Portsmouth, but turned down the offer to take over. He later took on the Scotland role from January 2013 as the popular choice amongst the Scotland support, resigning in October 2017 after failing to get Scotland through to at least the play-offs of the 2018 World Cup, and having not qualified to Euro 2016.\n\nGordon Strachan has also been an analyst of football matches for the media, most notably on the BBC\u2019s Match of the Day 2 show. Renowned for his deadpan humour as much as his shrewd tactical awareness, quotes attributed to Strachan have become legendary among football supporters.\n\nAs Celtic Manager\n\nGordon Strachan finally returned to management on 1 June 2005, when he succeeded Martin O\u2019Neill as manager of Celtic in the Scottish Premier League (SPL).\n\nHe resigned on 25 May 2009, after 4 years in charge having won the league three times in a row, with a lot to look on to be proud on, both domestically and in European competition.\n\nPREMIER LEAGUE CIS LEAGUE CUP SCOTTISH CUP EUROPE TOTALS SEASON P W D L F A PTS P W D L F A P W D L F A P W D L F A P W D L F A 2005-06 38 28 7 3 93 37 91 4 4 0 0 9 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 2 1 0 1 4 5 45 33 7 5 107 46 2006-07 38 26 6 6 65 34 84 2 1 1 0 3 1 5 5 0 0 13 3 8 3 1 4 9 10 53 35 8 10 90 48 2007-08 38 28 5 5 84 26 89 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 2 1 1 9 3 8 3 0 5 7 10 52 34 6 12 102 42 2009-09 38 24 10 4 80 33 82 4 4 0 0 9 1 3 2 0 1 4 3 6 1 2 3 4 7 51 31 12 8 97 44 TOTALS 152 106 28 18 322 130 346 12 10 1 1 23 7 13 9 1 3 27 11 24 8 3 13 24 32 201 133 33 35 396 180\n\nFirst season (2005-06)\n\nFor 2005/06, his stated aim was to regain the SPL title off current holders (Rangers).\n\nThings didn\u2019t exactly get off swimmingly, and an embarrassing start to his campaign as Celtic manager losing 5-0 to Slovakian champions Artmedia Bratislava on 27 July 2005 and 3 days later only managing to draw 4-4 away to Motherwell in his first SPL match in charge of the Glasgow club. A few days later he recorded his first win in charge as Celtic won 4-0 in the return leg of the Champions League qualifier.\n\nHowever, that was not enough to avoid being put out of Europe before the season had got started in earnest. For many Celtic fans, these set of matches set the tone (for both WGS and the supporters) on how the mentality on governing the side\u2019s tactics was to be for future matches. It was a huge psychological blow, and some fans never seemed to forgive him. It was too regularly brought up in seasons to come.\n\nNevertheless, Celtic improved under Strachan, leading the SPL by as much as 20 points at one point despite playing with a defence that came under regular criticism from the media and fans. Rangers were in turmoil as Alex McLeish lurched from one disaster to another. Two notable victories over Rangers in November (scoring 5 goals and conceding none) was a gem of a time, and saw the emergence of Shaun Maloney as a front runner for the team.\n\nNot all went Celtic\u2019s way, and another low-point was the shock defeat in the third-round of the Scottish Cup to First Division Clyde on 8 January 2006. However, the following month his team made history when they beat Dunfermline Athletic 8-1, a record victory margin for the SPL. Over the period after beating Rangers twice in November, the First Team went through a poor spell for two months where the First Team went behind in too many games, but thankfully fought back in to recover.\n\nWorse was that the First Team kept on conceding goals in all the games. It was not until Celtic played against Rangers in mid-February that the first team had a game that they didn\u2019t concede a goal in.Celtic were winning games but the weaknesses of the side were beginning to be seen, and in many ways they were the weaknesses that were to begin to haunt Celtic for over the next couple of seasons.\n\nAn important point that has to be made is that this was a season of transition, and anyone taking over from Martin O\u2019Neill as manager was going to have a hard task in front of them (a lot to live up to). Spats with Sutton and Agathe, saw both leave prematurely yet both could have contributed more. On the other hand, the players have to take in that the old regime was over and you have to understand and work with the new regime. With the less than stellar playing achievements of both after leaving Celtic, maybe WGS was right. Sutton in particular can be a prickly character and not predictable, so maybe it was best to move him on.\n\nOverall, Strachan\u2019s first season was ultimately successful as he coached Celtic to victory in the Scottish League Cup and, on 5 April 2006, his side clinched the SPL title in record time with six matches remaining. A difficult year of transition, but he\u2019d won most over to his side at this point.\n\nReflecting this achievement, Strachan was voted \u2018Manager of the Year\u2018 by the Scottish Football Writers\u2019 Association eight days after the title was clinched.\n\nThis was just the beginning, and much better was expected of both him and the team in the next season in terms of entertainment and results (goals conceded, scored etc).\n\nSecond season (2006-07)\n\nHis second season was even more of a roller coaster compared to his first, with excuses out the window for many, and the arrival of Paul le Guen (PLG) seen by the press as leading \u201cLe Revolution\u201d at Rangers to challenge Celtic. To the surprise of practically everyone, there was no actual domestic challenge. Rangers went comedic from failure to tragic farce, and Celtic simply took advantage going over 20 points ahead of them at one point in the season. In games v Rangers, the best PLG did was one draw. The \u2018Hearts Revolution\u2019 was also a joke with their challenge petering out before it had even began.\n\nKnocked out early in the league cup was no issue, and WGS easily made it up with winning the Scottish Cup to wrap up a cup and league double. Overall, WGS was having a respite domestically from any strong challenge, but nobody should understate the level of his achievement. Whilst others floundered, he ensured that Celtic did not, and the players were building up a fair reputation as a unit.\n\nThe Champions League was where it\u2019s at, and there he excelled. Despite a tough group, Celtic won all three home games, with a special victory against Man Utd which led Celtic to qualify from the Group stages for the first time. You can\u2019t understate the work done by Gordon Strachan in this. He galvanised the players and had set them out correctly to push further than they expected. Not a unit of players as highly rated together as the best under Martin O\u2019Neill yet they achieved what they did not. The players were fit and able, and were pushing to the last minute of matches. It made a whole difference. Strachan was able to utilise players like Nakamura to his best and it was paying out.\n\nOn the other hand,Celtic were poor away from home and lost all 3 games, with WGS stating that he knew the problem and would have it resolved. The next round v AC Milan was very special for the Support, and WGS held to what he said and the first team didn\u2019t concede in 180mins of football, but sadly didn\u2019t score either. Ultimately,Celtic were outdone by a classic goal by Kaka in extra time. A sad way to go out, but a great achievement by WGS and he deserves all the credit in the world.\n\nRegardless of the European achievements, some criticism must also be put at WGS for his second season domestically. The quality of football in the last third of the season in particular was appalling, and the player effort by too many of the squad was deemed non-existent. Rangers\u2019 new manager (Walter Smith) had the better of WGS with a very comfortable win in the last game v Rangers in the season, and Celtic lost in some very drab games. People pay to enjoy the product on the pitch, it really was not good at Celtic. It wasn\u2019t \u2018The Celtic Way\u2019.\n\nA number of the signings were disappointing that season, Gravesen, Miller and Jarosik in particular, whilst Jan Venegoor of Hasselink was injured too often. A spat with Maloney over new contracts saw the club lose a great new wee player (transferred to Aston Villa) and the defence was as bad at the end of the season as at the start. The manager appeared to bamboozle and patronise fans on many occasions with his team selections, and what appeared to be a continuing spat with Derek Riordan saw the player play few games and being overshadowed by the far less productive Kenny Miller. A round of boos as Riordan was taken off in one match late in the season was evidence of this. It was a sorry situation.\n\nMany fans were simply disillusioned by WGS at the end despite the successes, and simply couldn\u2019t see where he was taking the team. The fear was that the club was moving backwards despite what had been accomplished in the last year. This should have put an end to the rubbish that the fans didn\u2019t like him as he wasn\u2019t a \u201cCeltic man\u201d (lazy journalism), it was all because of the criticisms as said above. A real roller coaster of a season, and after all the achievements in the season it\u2019s sad to have to have to summarise it all in a negative tone.\n\nThird season (2007-08)\n\nFor WGS, this season had seen him lose the support of most of the fans. However the death of Tommy Burns and his near breakdown after his loss (a close friend and work colleague) showed a side of WGS which many had not seen before in his time here.\n\nThe Support all felt for him and just how much the job and the club really did mean to him. Winning the league against the odds (big odds at that) appeared to have moved the fans and split the fans opinion on him whether to stay or go at the end of it all.\n\nThis season for WGS can be termed a success on paper. To quote him, the team achieved what he set out at the start of the year to do. On paper, Celtic won the league (three in a row) and got through the Champs League group stages again (two in a row) which cemented the club as being more than just a flash in the pan side as others in the past have been cynically referred as being.\n\nCeltic sold hapless Kenny Miller to Derby County for \u00a33m (amazing!), brought in a few quality players like Barry Robson, beat Rangers twice at home in very entertaining games and so on. Adding in that Celtic were seven points (plus a game played more) behind Rangers going into the end of the season, WGS must be given his due, even by his harshest critic, for leading the team to somehow comeback and win the league. The first team won the last seven games (which included 2 wins v Rangers) and got much pride back. That can\u2019t be smirked at by anyone, and the last win came just a week after Tommy Burns death (not an easy time).\n\nAt the end of the day, his style of football was uninspiring and unentertaining, and he seemed to stick with some players in his squad way beyond what he should have and then moved them on (e.g. Caldwell, Donati, JVoH), demonstrating an inability to accept criticism and that he had been wrong. A public rift with Derek Riordan depicted an unsettled atmosphere in the changing room although other comments by players, like Mark Wilson, Pressley and Venegoor, said otherwise praising WGS for his man management skills.\n\nBringing in Barry Robson into the Celtic team seemed to show admission that he needed steel in a lightweight side (and what a change he made to the team), whilst Hartley was a revelation this season and deserved all the praise in the world. Boruc as ever was great, but a kick up the back side was needed as it took him a year to manage a game where he didn\u2019t lose a goal away from home.\n\nAllegations were thrown at the Celtic support that they were spoilt (see this story) and that the support didn\u2019t like WGS as he wasn\u2019t a \u2018Celtic man\u2018. Complete balderdash and it was simply sloppy & cheapshot journalism. The fans pay up good money to watch Celtic, and many a time the performances were dreadful to watch with the manager unwilling to admit change was needed and seemed to anger many, especially when he criticised the fans for not understanding what he was trying to do. The zonal defensive play was not working, the formations weren\u2019t working and certain players needed a kick up the backside.\n\nThe First Team lost v Inv Caley when they were two ahead, lost against Hibs, Motherwell and even struggled in games v Gretna. The First Team lost the first two games v Rangers, with poor tactics amongst other points to blame for it. Transfers weren\u2019t working out, especially the enigma that was Donati. Taking in the club had spent more money than Rangers, it was embarrassing to go behind in the league and watching Rangers going to the end for a very undeserved potential quadruple (which thankfully they didn\u2019t achieve).\n\nAdding all this up, WGS has to take flak. However, as said, his emotions after Tommy Burns showed his real self to everyone and all felt for him. This season may probably have shown him to be more of a coach than a great manager, but unlike the other pundits on television at least he puts his money where his mouth is and takes up the challenge of football management. Moving on to next season he should have learnt from what had happened to become a more complete rounded manager.\n\nMust be said, any manager who wins three league titles in a row must be doing something right, so maybe the critics amongst the fans are wrong. A late find in Barry Robson was a revelation, whilst bringing Lennon into the coaching staff seemed to freshen things up.\n\nWGS can be quite an enigma but moving into the next season, more entertaining football really was a requirement.\n\nFourth Season (2008-2009)\n\nSo, was WGS to cement his name as a legend at Celtic by achieving the coveted \u201c4-in-a-row\u201d of league titles? But more importantly, it was questioned on how was his relationship with the fans going to develop this year? It was a (near) clean sheet for many on WGS after the emotional end to the last season.\n\nBefore the season had even begun, rumblings (as usual) had restarted about WGS and his transfers. Few buys to excite the fans made many apprehensive about the hope for greater entertainment, but in general the mood was that, despite all else, Celtic were going to win the league (confidence was high).\n\nThe season started off rather easily until the first game v Rangers where basically Celtic were turned over (at home) 4-2 and lucky not to have lost by more. The first team were hopeless, and the daggers were out for the manager. The pent up frustration from sections of the crowd was released in one big explosion, and the tone was decidedly frosty for the rest of the season with respect to the manager\u2019s relationship with the fans. Not a good start.\n\nNevertheless following on from there was a cracking set of games which saw Celtic take advantage and overhaul Rangers to go top of the league. There was some great football in the first third of the season, and this was the best to watch Celtic for a few seasons at least.\n\nAnyhow, the big headaches of the season began with injuries besetting the manager in his aim to overhaul Rangers. Credit to WGS as his policy of squad numbers above single big signings did pay off which enabled Celtic to be able to squad rotate players to cover for gaps in the side and keep their nose in front. Amazingly Celtic went 7pts ahead at the end of November, and December became the brightest time of the season and it was capped off with a Scott McDonald inspired 1-0 victory at Ibrox against Rangers. Great! Everyone thought Celtic were set up for the rest of the campaign. How the support were to be disappointed.\n\nDuring all this was the Champions league escapade. A poor final set of results saw Celtic finish bottom of their group and again fail to win any of the away games (see link for full write-up). After 4 years, WGS still hadn\u2019t managed an away win in Europe, something that can\u2019t be put down to bad luck alone, and something that was noticeable to all. Celtic got the breaks last season in Europe, this time they didn\u2019t.\n\nBack to the league, when did it all begin to go wrong? Basically from the turn of the new year, yet WGS seemed to do little.\n\nWhat was going on? To everyone\u2019s surprise, WGS himself summarised the situation well in a post-match interview:\n\n\u201cYou have to determine your own destiny. The eyes of the football world are upon us all. The question being asked is, \u2018Are you a team that plays just when everything is right for you?\u2019 That can\u2019t happen. The best way for us to recover is to get back on form as quickly as possible.\u201d (Mar 09)\n\nHowever, he quickly turned back to old irritating ways by stating in an interview a few weeks later: \u201cIf anyone can find a negative \u2013 and I\u2019m sure they will \u2013 then they are warped!\u201d after a Dundee Utd game in April where Celtic drew 2-2. Clearly and sadly showed a dividing line between the management and the fans. An unnecessary dig and it was an unworkable relationship. This post-match comment was very insulting and patronising to the support (and uncalled for). Difficult to see how things were going to be mended easily for many. Why exactly did WGS have to patronise and insult the support? Only he could answer this question, but best left to the end of the season.\n\nAdd to that, complaints about the lack of entertaining football were being swatted away with abandonment: \u201cIn terms of entertainment, yes, we do have responsibilities at Celtic and Rangers, because we have greater resources than most clubs up here to entertain, But most of the songs that the supporters sing are all about winning trophies \u2014 they don\u2019t sing nice wee ditties about the beautiful game. No one remembers the beautiful football, but they do remember the defeats.\u201d This line again seemed to show his distance from the Celtic ideal.\n\nOne nice break was the league cup final, beating Rangers 2-0 after extra-time, with both goals scored by two Irish internationals (O\u2019Dea & McGeady).\n\nFrom then on in, little went right for Celtic again, and after dropping points, Celtic were up against Rangers to see who was to win the league. The final league game v Rangers was a failure, losing one-nil and from then on the writing was on the wall.\n\nCeltic had lost the league to a poor Rangers side. The Celtic players did not perform, and the apathy around the club was heart-breaking. It was overall a poor season with under-performing players.\n\nThe football was generally poor to watch and it had been a continual complaint over the past few years. For many who were tired of the turgid football on display this was a bit much, and swathes of empty seats at Celtic matches became the norm rather than exception. With the global credit crunch beginning and hitting one and all, it was not a time to alienate the support. Yet WGS did, so why? Who knows? It doesn\u2019t require much to get on the side of the fans.\n\nThere are many reasons for the loss, but the manager has to take the flak and he was not one to ever take criticism lightly, being self-admittedly easily irritated. In fairness there were mitigating points, e.g. the loss of Barry Robson to injury was probably more costly to the First Team than anyone realised, as he was a strong driving force to the title run-in last season.\n\nWGS handed in his resignation with little surprise the day after the league defeat, and he left rightly with his head held high for his achievements over the past four seasons with uncharacteristically no smart remarks from him (thankfully). There was actually some sadness to see him go as there had been many good memories over his time. He had been the creator of his own downfall this last season, and in his own reflection on this last season will have to admit, to himself at least, where he went wrong.\n\nReview\n\nSo after all that, how should anyone take and look back on WGS? His predecessor is still lauded to this day, and in reflection Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s achievements were hanging over WGS during his whole tenure at the club. Regardless, he had to deal with them, and if truth be said, then WGS can argue that on paper at least he has exceeded on par with what Martin O\u2019Neill achieved. Not that WGS would but the argument of who was the better manager (WGS or MoN) was a never ending debate which is all academic now. Martin O\u2019Neill was blessed to have had Henrik Larsson at hand so comparisons for WGS aren\u2019t easy or likely entirely fair.\n\nForgetting his predecessor, WGS had a few tasks to fulfill. Firstly, was to regenerate the squad and lower the cost base after the more spendthrift MoN years, win the league back and get Celtic further in Europe. On that score, he more than achieved what was set out. Wage costs were reduced, Celtic won the league back and in time achieved getting past the group stages in the Champions League twice in a row. Brilliant stuff.\n\nWinning the league three times in a row, as well as outliving two Rangers managers is surely a sign of success, especially after the hoo-haa over Paul Le Guen\u2019s management signing. Add in some incredible achievements in Europe (e.g. in beating European Cup holders AC Milan, the Naka winner v Manchester Utd, qualifying twice out of the Champions League group stages etc), and he can easily hold his head up high. The support were spoilt with success at many points.\n\nWhen Celtic won the league for the third time with him as manager, there is no denying that he had silenced all the doomsayers who were worrying that Celtic were out of the league title race. That last seven game winning run to win the league title against the odds will be spoken about for many a year. It was a phenomenal achievement to pick the players up and get them motivated. No matter what else can be said of his managerial ability, that was exceptional. The First Team came so close to reaching the quarter-finals of the European Cup in one season and what a mark that would have been. This was all done without the sublime talents of Larsson, Petrov and Sutton.\n\nEurope had been a sore bugbear for predecessor Martin O\u2019Neill, and Gordon Strachan achieved what Martin O\u2019Neill failed to achieve by qualifying past the group stages (and did it twice). It put Celtic on the pedestal with the premier clubs in Europe, and it was a great place to be.\n\nGordon Strachan was the architect for the high points, and when they came off they were exceptional, and WGS deserves all the credit in the world. Post-match interviews could also be enlivened by some of his emotive witticisms, which on a number of occasions lightened the mood and made everyone smile.\n\nThe most exciting game? Well there were many. WGS himself said that the Spartak Moscow win in 2007 was the most exciting and many would agree but defeating Manchester Utd 1-0 to reach the KO stages of the Champions League was also very special.\n\nHe also helped to foster the careers of some of the younger players, such as Maloney, McManus, McGeady & Wilson, and in reflection they will be thankful for the role that WGS has played in their careers. Some will succeed (at Celtic or elsewhere) whilst others inevitably won\u2019t but at least he gave them the opportunity. WGS likely was the best developer of youngsters we\u2019d had for the past twenty years or so. Billy McNeil was the last to have done well with youngsters in the squad.\n\nSo why in reflection, is the mood relatively more sombre over WGS than an outsider would expect? Much of it has been reflected above in the season reviews. The fans can be said to have been very patient with him, but the truth is that the football in general was too often poor to watch and after four years of that, what are the fans to say? He failed with a number of big transfers, and many players seemed to have declined under him rather than improved.\n\nMany fans take the belief that he couldn\u2019t coach well; confusing squad rotations and team selections baffled players as much as fans, and the last season was woeful in so many ways, throwing away major leads. Tackling Rangers in his last two seasons shouldn\u2019t have been as difficult as it was as Celtic were far better resourced, yet tripped up in both seasons and only got out of jail the first time.\n\nHe never helped himself with a number of his post-match remarks either, the \u201cwarped\u201d comment in his last season in particular was particularly poor judgement. He readily admits that he is easily irritated, but he\u2019d been in football for over twenty years and worked in the media for some time, so he should have been able to know how to deal with it. Yet he couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t!\n\nMany would agree that \u201cned-culture\u201d had been on the rise, and WGS in particular had been very vocal on this issue, taking journalists to task on occasion as well. However, when you give a flippant remark to a question or a thinly veil snide remarks to others, then how really is anyone to see him in a different light to those he criticised? Bit extreme but the point stands and he could end up making things worse for himself. All are irked by neds but he made too much of a crusade of it at times, and at Celtic it was the wrong place for his campaign.\n\nCeltic is a social community club, and thefore reflects a cross-section of society. So admittedly the support can have a small share of nefarious characters, but the support does push and emphasise the roots of the club in terms of charity and community, and this in turn is reflected by the good nature and reputation of the support. Winning is not the only aim, it\u2019s also about the ineffable \u201cto play the Celtic Way\u201d. WGS did not seem to comprehend this, and dismissed any criticism of his tactics stating that others didn\u2019t understand what he was trying to do. That was simply nonsense.\n\nHis \u201cwin at the cost of entertainment\u201d style may find favour in the cut-throat English championship but not at Celtic. That in itself had been what has been the crux of the friction between the support and WGS, and that was what created his downfall. He did things by the training manual but that is never sufficient, and he could be quite robotic with his decisions (such as always subbing on players in matches at an exact certain time) so leaving little room for flexibility or showing that he was able to be experimental in matches.\n\nFrom the outside, everything appeared to be rosy as Celtic won trophies but it\u2019s about more than that with the Celtic support. The supporters weren\u2019t most often enjoying the play on the pitch, reflected in the falling attendances.\n\nWGS is actually a very decent man. The players all spoke very highly of him, and there was little if any dissent at the time (McGeady and Riordan apart) even from those who left prematurely, although one or two (e.g. Sutton & Gravesen) have been quite critical of Strachan since leaving but much later on. All Celtic fans who have met him have generally commented well on him. Away from it all, a long one-on-one interview in December 2008 with Radio Scotland brought out his good side and there was a general amount of respect for him from this.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not the full qualification to be a successful football manager, and WGS\u2019 natural managerial ability was below that level which all wish he was at. Maybe if he had spent some time with some great managers learning their skill, he could have been a far better manager. He was a player with Manchester Utd and Aberdeen under Alex Ferguson but his coaching began at Leeds (under the dour Howard Wilkinson) and then Coventry, and sadly it\u2019s those latter clubs that his coaching philosophy stems from. Ex-Celt Gravesen in an interview in 2018 commented on Strachan\u2019s extreme fear of losing games, noting criticisms made to Gravesen on defending the lead when he had scored a hat-trick after the game in question.\n\nAn important point must be noted that WGS is the first Celtic manager to have to grapple with the new media. Martin O\u2019Neill was manager when the internet got going, but it was in its infancy throughout most of MoN\u2019s reign, and the scale and importance in which the internet had taken in WGS\u2019 time had meant that he had another task to take on.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy anymore. Replays and events are dissected more thoroughly and for longer than ever before. There are cameras to capture everything, statisticians to tally up the most mundane of figures and heated wipe-spread discussions begin on the matches before they\u2019re even over (on the forums & social media) and not hours later in the pub as it all used to be. Sky Sports & its peers are everywhere, and unconscious comparisons with richer foreign leagues had been rising, which doesn\u2019t help with the club\u2019s limited resources. Sadly, that was the future, and WGS was the first Celtic manager to deal with it and few seemed to sit back and notice. Maybe if they did then he\u2019d have been cut more slack.\n\nHis biggest mistake? Should have left at the end of 2007/08 season as many fans were calling for. He stayed 12 months longer than he should have, and that set in the rot which accelerated over time. At the end of it all, most fans wanted him gone, and it\u2019s sad to see him have to leave in that kind of atmosphere. Much of it had been of his own creation, and his successor had the unenviable task to rebuild the squad in much the same way that WGS himself had to when he himself began.\n\nFor those who still believe that the Celtic support were irrational, they should take the following comment from Middlesborough legend & ex-player Bernie Slaven on Gordon Strachan\u2019s brief reign at Middlesborough after leaving Celtic, as there are parallels from his comment to the Celtic supporters\u2019 criticisms of Strachan\u2019s time at Celtic:\n\n\u201cAfter a year in charge, we [Middlesborough] had not improved one iota \u2013 the football was average, away results were abysmal, the worst league position in 20 years and he still doesn\u2019t know his best team. It wasn\u2019t just on the field that Strachan let himself down, off the field during post-match interviews he became an embarrassment to himself, the club and the fans. He was arrogant, obnoxious, sarcastic, cutting and rude. He came across to me like a man who was on the borderline of insanity.\u201d\n\nWe hoped WGS all the very best in the future, in whatever direction he was to take. Everyone knows from his honest comments that he grew to love the club, just at times his daft side too often got in the way. He is a good man, and for the great memories all will forever be thankful for them and there were a number of them along the way. In time, all at least missed his sense of humour from his interviews [see Quotes by and on Gordon Strachan].\n\nHe signed off from Celtic with a wonderful speech which contained the following great quote (from the Tommy Burn\u2019s tribute match, full wording below):\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to pretend I came here as a Celtic supporter. I don\u2019t believe in kissing badges to get your support. I didn\u2019t know the words of \u2018Fields of Athenry\u2019\u2026. [but] From today, I\u2019ve become a Celtic supporter.\u201d\n\nGordon Strachan (May 2009)\n\nPost-Celtic & Scotland management\n\nSince leaving Celtic, he had a relatively unsuccessful time as manager at Middlesborough. He took over a set of former Celtic (& Rangers) players to his new club making it dubbed by some as some kind of Glasgow old boys team. It didn\u2019t work out at all, and his time as a club side manager was over.\n\nHe returned to football analysis on TV & Radio, and to the joy of every Celtic fan, he has been incredible towards Celtic. Never hides his sympathy, and talks up the club at every opportunity. Really puts to shame some former players who have taken pot-shots. Without the pressure of management, Strachan has shown his knowledge of the game on TV and applied it in an easy accessible manner for the viewer and is very popular. A very different character to the fish-bowl like environment that a Celtic manager has to endure in Glasgow.\n\nThe support was very much warming to him, and possibly it\u2019s an indication that he may have regretted not having shown this more amiable side during his time at Celtic. Sometimes you don\u2019t know what you have until it\u2019s gone, and maybe only once he was at a distance that he was able to admire what Celtic had offered and given him. The affection that Strachan now has with the support was increasingly mutual as was shown on his frequent trips back to Celtic Park.\n\nMust add that he had acted as a mentor in part for Neil Lennon. At one point there were stories of bringing Strachan back as a paid mentor for Neil Lennon but this didn\u2019t materialise. However, he has still acted as such and Neil Lennon publicly paid his respect to Strachan once after advise given by him which helped Celtic win a vital game against Rangers (and helped keep Neil Lennon in his job).\n\nCuriously, Strachan has claimed that there was no bias against Celtic in his time as manager of the club, but then again Rangers were so bad during much of the spell, bias wouldn\u2019t have made a difference (as it was to do so during Lennon\u2019s reign).\n\nScotland Managerial Tenure\n\nOver his entire time as a manager, his name was continually brought up as a possible future Scotland manager, and with the lack of candidates putting themselves forward for the role, Strachan in January 2013 was announced the new manager. Interestingly, one of the first questions he was posed at his initial press conferences was: \u201cIs this the biggest job in your career so far?\u201d, to which Strachan retorted: \u201cI was manager of Celtic, there\u2019s no bigger job than that!\u201d. Bless him, the support loved him more now than ever.\n\nThere was to be added spice for the Celtic fans. In 2013, Martin O\u2019Neill was announced as the Republic of Ireland manager with ex-Celtic player Roy Keane as his assistant. If you ever read back to the old match threads, reports and reviews by Celtic fans from the 2000\u2019s, a common argument was \u201cMoN v WGS\u201c, as who was the better manager: Martin O\u2019Neill or Gordon Strachan?\n\nThe comparisons were difficult, and the arguments at times nauseating, but in 2014 both Martin O\u2019Neill and Gordon Strachan were drawn to face each other in competitive matches for the Euro Championships. The first match was ironically played at Celtic Park as Hampden was being renovated, and Scotland triumphed 1-0, and the return leg ended 1-1 with ex-Celt Maloney (who had played under both at Celtic) the scorer for Scotland in both games. Nobody was going to truly believe this would settle any old arguments. Time has now passed by for the old debaters, and both managers should be respected for their time at Celtic.\n\nStrachan\u2019s second run at qualification had certain parallels to his time at Celtic, as in the roller-coaster aspect. A grim start to the qualification for the 2018 World Cup was compounded by his stubbornness where he opted to remain loyal to old stalwarts rather than new players or those regarded as currently on form in the Scottish league. Many also argued he had a bias against those based in the Scottish leagues in preference to the English leagues.\n\nThe qualifying campaign for Strachan to the 2018 World Cup was a roller coaster mirroring that of his time at Celtic. Having begun the campaign very poorly, his head was on the block, only to incredibly recover but then fell at the final hurdle. Part of the problem was his initial intransigence to play Celtic players who were then by far the best in the country, publicly rebuking calls for more Celtic players, most notably Griffiths.\n\nA 3-0 loss to Lithuania at the start of the campaign featured no Celtic players, but the turnaround featured a number. His fall at the final hurdle was in part due to the loss of two key Celtic central midfielders (Brown & Armstrong) to injury. The biggest issue was to be his patter, and a post-match comment about Scot\u2019s lacking height & genetics made him lampooned across the footballing circuits and infuriated everyone. He was still rubbing everyone up the wrong way.\n\nOn the other hand, Scotland were again a fighting side under his management. As at Celtic, last minute goals were notable event, e.g. crucial winner v Slovakia in Oct 2017, it was a great attribute. The amount of times his Celtic and Scotland teams have done it is remarkable. There comes a point where you can no longer say it\u2019s luck or fortune, and he genuinely does instil a belief and winning mentality into his teams. Fair enough the football wasn\u2019t always free-flowing and the mentality didn\u2019t necessarily always turn into victories, but the winning belief was a great trait to have.\n\nHe resigned in Oct 2017 after failing to get Scotland through to at least the play-offs of the 2018 World Cup, and having not qualified to the 2016 Euros.\n\nFew were bemoaning the decision, but he had made a rod for his own back. His positives and negatives again came very much to the forefront in this role as it did at his time at Celtic. Sadly he would leave with little to write home about with Scotland (despite some progress) whilst his Celtic tenure had many wonderful highs. If anything, it vindicated the often ambivalent opinion the Celtic fans had of Gordon Strachan over his time at the club.\n\nPost-Football Management\n\nIn a curious twist of fate, his son Gavin Strachan was on the Celtic coaching staff in 2020/21 during the Covid-19 pandemic, and after a trip to Dubai due to Covid-19 isolation of 13 players and the manager & assistant manager, Gavin Strachan was the de facto acting manager for a couple of games. This meant the first father & their son to have managed Celtic.\n\nThere were reports he would join his son at Celtic, with Gordon Strachan given a role as director of football following Neil Lennon\u2019s departure. This was though was shot down by a number in the support, and the board likely backed away from it as at that point there was a lot of friction between the board & the support. Gordon Strachan did eventually return to Celtic for a short consultancy role in 2021.\n\n[\u2026.]\n\nWe wished Gordon Strachan the best.\n\nHonours as Celtic Manager\n\nScottish Premier League winner:\n\nScottish Cup winner:\n\nScottish League Cup winner:\n\nSPFA Manager of the Year:\n\n2005\u201306, 2006\u201307, 2008-09\n\nSPL Manager of the Year:\n\nPictures\n\nQuotes\n\nForums\n\nArticles"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/21023913", "page_content": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nGordon Strachan has been confirmed as the new manager of Scotland.\n\nThe former Celtic and Middlesbrough boss replaces Craig Levein, who was sacked in November.\n\nStrachan has signed a contract that will cover the remainder of the current World Cup qualifying campaign and the Euro 2016 qualifiers.\n\n\"I'm very proud but also my family are proud.

Asad Butt points out that, as part of his all-conquering career, Zlatan won consecutive titles at Internazionale (2009), Barcelona with his old mate Pep (2010) and Milan (2011).\n\nIn any game of oneupmanship, Eric Cantona is usually king, too. Before settling at Old Trafford he wandered from club to club and won the title with Marseille (1991), Leeds (1992) and Manchester United (1993). Thanks to Tom Funnell for that one.\n\nThere\u2019s more. Dirk Maas highlights the case of Alexei Mikhailichenko, who was champion with Dynamo Kyiv in 1990, played a bit part in the great Sampdoria fairytale of 1990-91 and then won the Scottish title with Rangers the following season. Dirk also reminded us that Kingsley Coman won three in a row from 2014-16 with PSG, Juventus and Bayern Munich.\n\nAll very impressive, but Admir Pajic knows a man who won three titles with three different clubs in the space of 18 months. \u201cIvica Olic has managed to win three league titles with three different teams in two different countries. Olic was the best player of NK Zagreb in 2001-02 when they won their first (and only) league title to this date. Then, after a lot of controversies, he ended up at NK Dinamo Zagreb where he forged a formidable partnership with the Aston Villa legend Bosko Balaban. Tired of conquering Croatia, Olic signed for CSKA Moscow and won the league with the Russian club in the same calendar year.\u201d\n\nCan anyone top that? If so, email knowledge@theguardian.com or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU\n\n\u201cHas a player ever refused a transfer or refused to play for a team because of a team\u2019s sponsor?\u201d asks JF Mamjjasond.\n\nYes, some footballers really do have a conscious. Newcastle\u2019s Papiss Ciss\u00e9 refused to wear Newcastle\u2019s Wonga-sponsored kit for a while in 2013 because it clashed with his Muslim beliefs. He changed his mind in the end, which may or may not have had anything to do with his being photographed in a casino.\n\nAt Sevilla, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9 did something similar: he originally refused to wear shorts with an 888.com logo, as gambling was against his Islamic beliefs, but relented eventually.\n\nThere is also the famous case of Johan Cruyff at the 1974 World Cup. The Dutch FA had a deal with Adidas to supply their kit, and your Johnny Reps and Rob Rensenbrinks of this world were only too happy to wear the stripy orange shirts during the 1974 World Cup in Germany. Cruyff, of course, had other ideas. He had an exclusive personal deal with Adidas\u2019s rivals Puma, who supplied him with their classic Puma King boots. Because of this, he was unwilling to sport the three trademark stripes of Adidas and insisted on a two-striped version instead. As you would expect, he got exactly what he wanted.\n\nHome/away points differential\n\n\u201cWith Burnley\u2019s current great form at home and woeful away record, I was wondering what was the biggest difference in points gained at home to away based on three points for a win?\u201d wonders Sean Cole. \u201cI make Burnley\u2019s this season 2.07 to 0.1 so a difference of 1.97.\u201d\n\nSam Holden highlights the case of Coventry in the 1999-2000 Premier League season. \u201cThey took 37 points (12 wins, one draw) from their 19 home games and drew seven of their away games, averaging 1.95 points per home game and 0.37 per away game, a difference of 1.58 points. Although lower than Burnley\u2019s current differential, Burnley\u2019s remaining six away games are at teams in the bottom seven.\u201d\n\nGordon Strachan, Coventry manager of the time, is a common link with another bunch of homers: the Leeds United team of 1992-93, who famously defended their league title by finishing 17th. They won none of their 21 away matches but were formidable at home, with only one defeat. Overall they took 44 points at home (average 2.10) and seven away (0.33) for a home/away difference of 1.77.\n\nRobbie Keane, here scoring the winner against Aston Villa, was part of a Coventry side formidable at home in 1999-2000. Photograph: Ben Radford/Allsport\n\nAll this is really just a preamble to one of the greatest league tables ever committed to print. The Nigerian League of 2013 is utterly astonishing, with no team winning more than three away games. Gombe United, who finished seventh, won 18 of their 19 home games \u2013 and lost all 19 away matches. Their home/away difference was 2.89. Good luck beating that.\n\nKnowledge archive\n\n\n\n\u201cMe and my friend have been having a heated debate over who was the best outfield emergency goalkeeper,\u201d asked Brian Deegan back in the day. \u201cI am standing firm on Peter Beardsley; other names in the hat include Lucas Radebe and St\u00e9phane Henchoz. Sort this out!\u201d\n\nLucas Radebe, who went in goal for Leeds at Old Trafford in April 1996, famously threatened to derail Manchester United\u2019s title challenge in the game that sparked the Alex Ferguson rant that in turn fuelled Kevin Keegan\u2019s \u201cI would love it\u201d outburst. Radebe went in goal in the 16th minute and kept the door shut until the 72nd minute, when Roy Keane scored a crucial goal.\n\nSt\u00e9phane Henchoz is certainly worthy of mention. As any Arsenal or Manchester United fan will remember, he made a couple of great saves in the Millennium Stadium during the FA Cup final and Community Shield in 2001. Sadly, he was still playing centre-half at the time.\n\nNat Lofthouse and Bobby Moore both saved penalties for Bolton and West Ham respectively (though Moore was unfortunate enough to have the rebound blasted straight past him), and there are honourable mentions for Beardsley, Mal Donaghy, David Speedie and Vinnie Jones. But the daddy of stand-in goalkeepers has to be Niall Quinn.\n\nOn 20 April 1991, the Manchester City keeper Tony Coton hauled down Derby\u2019s Dean Saunders in the box and was sent off. From the resulting penalty, taken by Saunders, Quinn dived full-length to his left to save. Eight years later, having just put Sunderland 1-0 up at Bradford, Quinn had to go in goal for the final 14 minutes when Thomas Sorensen was stretchered off \u2013 and he kept a clean sheet.\n\n\n\nCan you help?\n\n\u201cIt occurs to me that Leicester now lie 39 points behind Chelsea (and with a much inferior goal difference) with only 39 points left to play for,\u201d points out Oliver Raven. \u201cI wondered if this is the earliest effectively confirmed failure to defend a league title, either in terms of how much time is left in the season, ie more than three months, or according to the proportion of matches yet to be played \u2013 which would mean 34% of games still to come in this case?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIn a recent game of Football Manager (I\u2019m noticing a trend with recent submissions to the Knowledge \u2026), I ended up in charge of Chester in the Vanarama North,\u201d begins Tom Dempster. \u201cOne season started with 15 consecutive games (league and cup) without a draw (10 wins, five defeats). This got me thinking about similar streaks in real life. What is the longest streak of games a team has gone without a draw? And on a related note, what is the lowest percentage of drawn games by a team in a single season?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDuring the DFB-Pokal match against Hertha Berlin, Borussia Dortmund played with four different team captains,\u201d notes Julian Unkel. \u201cOfficial captain Marcel Schmelzer started, but had to be substituted at half-time, with vice-captain Marco Reus taking over. With the game going into extra-time, Reus had to be substituted due to injury as well, passing the armband to Sokratis Papastathopoulos, who was then sent off in the final moments of extra time. Thus, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang became the fourth team captain of the night and led the team into the penalty shootout. Which they won. Is this the most captains a team has ever fielded during a competitive match?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Manchester City were the first English champions to be relegated in 1938 they were the highest scorers with 80 goals,\u201d explains David Forster. \u201cWest Brom also went down that year with an incredible 77 goals. Has it ever happened elsewhere that relegated teams have gone down scoring so many goals?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI remember a picture of a Turkish goalkeeper years ago that caught my attention for some peculiar reason,\u201d writes Max Cheung. \u201cHe was sporting an Uhlsport jersey, a pair of Reusch gloves, a pair of Umbro shorts, as well as Adidas socks and Puma boots. For years I have been unable to find it on the internet until just moments ago, when I stumbled across the name of that goalkeeper (Engin \u0130peko\u011flu) and found this, which proved that my memories were indeed correct (unluckily the picture didn\u2019t show his socks and boots, but we can assume that he was indeed wearing some Adidas products as his teammates next to him were). A total of five different brand names were used by him. Can anyone top that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere must be some reason players keep returning to Motherwell,\u201d writes Alan Paterson. \u201cIn the fairly recent past Brian McClair, John Sutton, Henrik Ojamaa and the late Phil O\u2019Donnell all returned to play at Fir Park after time playing for other clubs on a permanent basis. Last week Stephen Pearson returned to Motherwell to begin his third spell with the club. As of January 2016, though, Motherwell had six players in their squad (Stephen Pearson, Scott McDonald, Steven Hammell, Keith Lasley, James McFadden and David Clarkson) all in, at least, their second spell with the club. Has any club ever had more returning players in their squad at the same time? Particularly, with none of the spells at or away from the club being on loan.\u201d\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/gordon-david-strachan-1535.php", "page_content": "Before he professionally started playing football, he was offered a contract by Eddie Turnbull to play for a club, but his father opposed the decision by stating that the club did not cover sufficient expenses.\n\nGeorge David Strachan was born to Jim and Catherine in Muirhouse, Edinburgh.

They also defeated Hamburg in the 1983 European Super Cup Final.\n\nIn the 1984-1985 season, he took four goals in a total of seven games and even though he did not participate in the 1985 FA Cup Final at Wembley, the team went on to win the opening ten league games in the 1985-1986 season.\n\nAfter accepting a contract by Ron Atkinson, he led the Leeds United Club to the Second Division title in the 1989-1990 season. They finished fourth overall, but managed to secure a place in the semi-finals of the League Cup.\n\nHe signed a two-year contract with Leeds and captained them to record a victory in the league title of 1991-1992. However, due to poor health and back problems, he started missing a number of games and thus, became unable to build on the success of Leeds Untied.\n\nOn April 10, 1993, despite his downfalls and tough seasons, he scored a hat-trick against the Blackburn Rovers and then moved to Coventry City to serve as an assistant to the manager, Ron Atkinson.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nHe coached the team and trained them and also appeared in the seasons 1994-1995 and 1995-1996. The club struggled at the start of the 1996-1997 season, which resulted in Atkinson being asked to step down from the managerial position.\n\nAfter Strachan was appointed as manager, he helped his team reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in 1997-1998.\n\nIn 2001, he was appointed as the manager of Premier League Southampton, succeeding Stuart Gray. Under his leadership, the Southampton team earned their place for the UEFA Cup.\n\nAfter a brief hiatus, he returned to manage the team, Celtic, on June 1, 2005. Although he had a very shaky start as a manager, the team eventually began to do well under his management and started winning tournaments.\n\nOn October 26, 2009, he was signed on as the manager for Middlesbrough. However, after a series of defeats, he voluntarily stepped down as the manager during the 2010-2011 season."}, {"url": "https://www.footballdatabase.eu/en/player/details/2570-gordon-strachan", "page_content": "Adblocker detected!

Confirmation of the move, which had been widely anticipated, arrived this afternoon after Strachan decided the time was right to leave the Parkhead outfit.\n\nHaving won three Scottish Premier League titles in succession from his appointment in Glasgow in 2005, Strachan lost out on this year's championship to Rangers yesterday. However, it is understood he had already made up his mind to take what would be his second self-imposed exile from football.\n\nStrachan has twice guided Celtic to the last 16 of the Champions League and has overseen a massive reduction in debt. Yet he was never fully embraced by the Celtic support in the manner his predecessor, Martin O'Neill, was.\n\nThe 52-year-old is currently on holiday in Spain but released a statement via the club's website, saying: \"I have enjoyed my time immensely at Celtic and clearly I will be sad to leave this great club. As I have said before, Celtic is a special club, with special supporters. There is no club like it and it has been an absolute honour and privilege to be the club's manager for the past four years.\n\n\"We have done all we can to bring success to the club and we were delighted to deliver three SPL titles, other domestic silverware, as well as making some great progress in Europe. It is just disappointing that we did not manage the fourth championship. However, the players can hold their heads high in terms of what they have done for the club in recent years.\"\n\nOwen Coyle, who has masterminded Burnley's promotion to the Premier League, has been installed as the leading candidate to replace Strachan. Tony Mowbray, Roberto Martinez, Alan Curbishley, Mick McCarthy and Mark McGhee are also in the frame. David Moyes, greatly admired within Parkhead, is currently thought to be out of Celtic's financial reach.\n\nSunderland, meanwhile, have rapidly dismissed speculation they will move for Strachan as the replacement for Ricky Sbragia. That may change, though, with the news the former Coventry and Southampton manager is now a free agent."}, {"url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/gordon-strachan-lined-up-celtic-24357400", "page_content": "Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nGet the latest Celtic news sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter\n\nCeltic are said to be ready to bring Gordon Strachan back to the club in a behind the scenes role.\n\nThe former Scotland boss is currently technical director at Dundee, combining his role with punditry jobs.\n\nAn ex-Parkhead manager, Strachan has provided analysis on Celtic TV as well as other outlets.\n\nAccording to the Scottish Sun he's set to make a return to his former club, with the 64-year-old to occupy a similar role to his job at Dens Park.\n\nStrachan won three league titles in a row during his time as Celtic manager, as well as lifting two League Cups and the Scottish Cup.\n\n(Image: SNS Group)\n\nHis return was teased by former Parkhead man Charlie Nicholas earlier this season.\n\nHe wrote: \"The way Gordon Strachan has been talking, I wouldn't be surprised if there is a role for him at Celtic.\n\n\"If the club is assessing potential candidates for a technical director or director of football then the likelihood is that he will be under consideration.\n\n\"Strachan seems to be the mouthpiece for Celtic just now.\n\n\"He is the one who is coming out in the media and really defending the club.\n\n\"He also seems to know a lot about what is happening behind the scenes and claimed with a fair degree of certainty that his son Gavin will remain at the club.\n\n\"Director of football at Parkhead is clearly a job Gordon would be interested in, even if he is doing a similar role at Dundee at the moment.\""}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/may/25/gordon-strachan-factfile-quits-celtic", "page_content": "1957 Born February 9, Edinburgh.\n\n1974 Signs for Dundee.

Strachan played for Dundee, Aberdeen, Manchester United, Leeds United and Coventry City, as well as the Scotland national team. He has since managed Coventry City, Southampton, Celtic, Middlesbrough and Scotland.\n\nIn club football, he played 635 league games, scoring a total of 138 goals, playing 21 of 25 career seasons in either the English or Scottish top-flight. In international football Strachan earned 50 caps, scoring five goals and playing in two FIFA World Cup final tournaments, Spain 82 and Mexico 86. Strachan retired from playing in 1997 at age 40, setting a Premier League record for an outfield player.\n\nA right-sided midfielder, Strachan made his senior debut in 1974 with Dundee before moving on within Scotland, to spend seven seasons at Aberdeen. He first played for the Scotland national team in 1980. While at Aberdeen Strachan won multiple domestic league and cup honours in the early 1980s, as well as the 1982\u201383 European Cup Winners' Cup and 1983 European Super Cup. Moving to England, Strachan won the 1985 FA Cup Final in five seasons with Manchester United. He spending the next seven seasons as club captain at Leeds, winning the 1989\u201390 Second Division and 1991\u201392 First Division league titles. He played his last game for Scotland in 1992. He moved to Coventry in 1995 for a final three seasons, as a player-coach.\n\nStrachan became full-time manager of Coventry when the incumbent Ron Atkinson was appointed as director of football. After five years as Coventry manager, he was sacked in 2001 after the club was relegated from the top-flight for the first time in 34 years. He returned to the Premier League as Southampton manager and guided the \"Saints\" to the 2003 FA Cup Final, where they lost 1\u20130 to Arsenal. Strachan resigned from Southampton in 2004 and took a 16-month break from management. He returned to Scotland to become manager of Celtic, where he achieved three successive league titles and other domestic cup wins. Strachan left Celtic in May 2009 after failing to win a fourth title. He then became manager of Middlesbrough in the English Championship, but left the club after an unsuccessful 12 months in the job. Strachan then managed the Scotland national team for five years, but was unable to secure qualification for a major tournament.\n\nStrachan was named as FWA Footballer of the Year for the 1990\u201391 season while at Leeds. He was also named Manager of the Year in Scotland several times by writers and players while at Celtic. In 2007, Strachan was inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame. He is the father of Craig Strachan and Gavin Strachan, also footballers.\n\nClub career\n\nBorn and raised in Muirhouse, Edinburgh, Strachan supported Hibernian as a boy. His father, Jim, worked as a scaffolder, and his mother, Catherine, worked at a whisky distillery. At age 15, he damaged his vision playing football on the school playground when a pen in his pocket became lodged in his right eye; the pen came within \"a thousandth of an inch\" of permanently costing him the vision in his eye. He was offered a contract by Hibernian manager Eddie Turnbull, but his father decided against the offer after stating the club did not pay sufficient expenses for footwear.\n\nDundee\n\nStrachan began his career with Dundee, having decided to sign with the Scottish club at age 14. In joining the club, he rejected an approach from Manchester United, reasoning he had a better chance to establish himself in the first team at Dens Park. His natural talent was immediately apparent and he quickly earned a reputation as an outstanding player in the second team, twice winning the Scottish Reserve Player of the Year Award. He made his mark as an 18-year-old when he outplayed Alan Ball in a friendly with Arsenal in August 1975; The Sunday Post compared him to a young Billy Bremner. Strachan became a regular player in the 1975\u201376 season, the inaugural season of the Scottish Premier Division, featuring in 17 of the club's 36 league matches. However David White's \"Dee\" were relegated on the last day of the season after rivals Dundee United edged ahead on goal average with an unlikely draw with champions Rangers.\n\nNew boss Tommy Gemmell handed 19-year-old Strachan the captaincy for the 1976\u201377 First Division campaign, and he remains the youngest player to have captained Dundee. However, the club failed to shine in the lower divisions, and Strachan lost his first team place early in the 1977\u201378 season following a drinking session with Jimmy Johnstone; Gemmell was also concerned that Strachan was \"getting kicked a lot\" after opposition teams worked out that the way to stop Dundee was to take out their playmaker. Strachan decided to leave Dundee as the club seemed unlikely to win back their top-flight status; the Dundee chairman was also keen on cashing in his most prized asset, and told Gemmell that \"we need \u00a350,000 by Friday or the banks are closing the gate\". His last match for Dundee was on 26 October 1977 in a 6\u20130 defeat in the League Cup to Queen of the South at Palmerston Park, which Strachan described in his autobiography as \"embarrassing\".\n\nAberdeen\n\nStrachan was signed by Aberdeen manager Billy McNeill in November 1977 for a fee of \u00a350,000 plus Jim Shirra. Poor form and niggling injuries made 1977\u201378 a poor season for Strachan, though the \"Dons\" went on to finish second in the Scottish Premier Division. He was not picked for the 1978 Scottish Cup Final defeat to Rangers.\n\nMcNeill left the Pittodrie Stadium for Celtic in summer 1978, and Alex Ferguson was appointed as the new manager. Strachan played at Hampden Park in the 1979 League Cup defeat to Rangers, and set up Duncan Davidson for the game's opening goal. Though the 1978\u201379 campaign was a disappointment, Aberdeen went on to win the league title in 1979\u201380 after closing a ten-point deficit over Celtic with a late run that included two victories at Celtic Park. They again reached the League Cup Final, beating both Old Firm sides en route, where they lost 3\u20130 to Dundee United at Dens Park. At the end of the season, Strachan was elected SFWA Footballer of the Year. After gaining assurance Alex McLeish would also stay with the club, Strachan signed a new contract to keep him at Pittodrie until 1984.\n\nThe \"Reds\" could only manage a second-place finish in 1980\u201381, as Celtic regained the league title. They exited the European Cup in the second round with defeat to eventual champions Liverpool; manager Bob Paisley said Strachan would become \"Britain's first \u00a32 million player\", in what was a (successful) early attempt at mind games. He missed the second half of the season with a muscle tear in his stomach. With fit-again Strachan on the right flank \u2013 supported by full-back Stuart Kennedy \u2013 and record signing Peter Weir on the left-flank, Aberdeen mounted a genuine title challenge in 1981\u201382, but had to settle for second place to Celtic. They did though lift the Scottish Cup with a 4\u20131 extra-time victory over Rangers, with Strachan contributing one assist and one goal.\n\nThe 1982\u201383 campaign was the greatest in the history of the club, and Strachan made his mark early on with four goals in a 5\u20131 victory at former club Dundee in the League Cup. Despite only finishing third in the league (albeit only one point behind champions and New Firm rivals Dundee United) and exiting the League Cup in the quarter-finals, Aberdeen won the Scottish Cup and the European Cup Winners' Cup. The club's European success came with a 2\u20131 after-extra-time victory over Spanish giants Real Madrid at Ullevi in Gothenburg. The Scottish Cup came with a 1\u20130 win over Rangers. The \"Dons\" continued their success by delivering the league title and Scottish Cup in 1983\u201384, with Strachan setting up Mark McGhee for the winning goal in the cup final win over Celtic. This completed a unique treble, as they defeated Hamburger SV in the 1983 European Super Cup.\n\nManchester United\n\nIn August 1984, Manchester United spent \u00a3500,000 to take Strachan to Old Trafford. However, because Strachan had previously signed a pre-contract agreement with Bundesliga side 1. FC K\u00f6ln, United paid \u00a375,000 compensation to resolve the row \u2013 teammate Mark McGhee had also signed a contract with Hamburger SV on the understanding that Strachan would also be playing in Germany. Strachan opened the 1984\u201385 campaign with four goals in seven matches, though the \"Red Devils\" could only manage a fourth-place finish in the First Division. He featured at Wembley Stadium in the 1985 FA Cup Final, as United ran out 1\u20130 winners over Everton; his lung-bursting run off-the-ball helped Norman Whiteside to find the space for his extra-time winner.\n\nAfter winning their opening ten league matches of the 1985\u201386 season, United had to cope without Strachan, who was sidelined for much of the season with injury. They proved unable to cope with their injuries \u2013 another key player facing extended time in the treatment room was Bryan Robson \u2013 and limped to another fourth-place finish. Atkinson was replaced by Alex Ferguson in November 1986, and Strachan mocked sobbing as he told his teammates, \"I never thought he'd follow me this far south!\" After his arrival, Ferguson speculated that no longer being the star player had negatively affected Strachan's form. United finished a disappointing 11th in 1986\u201387, before rising to second place in 1987\u201388. Strachan's form was again patchy in 1988\u201389, as United slipped back down to 11th.\n\nLeeds United\n\nIn March 1989, Sheffield Wednesday manager Ron Atkinson had a bid of \u00a3200,000 accepted by Manchester United, and he offered Strachan a contract paying more money than anyone in the club's history. However likely a move to Sheffield seemed, Leeds United manager Howard Wilkinson matched the offer and convinced Strachan to drop down into the Second Division. He quickly became a popular figure at Elland Road, earning comparisons to former favourites Bobby Collins and Johnny Giles. Signing a two-year contract, he was awarded with the captain's armband. He formed an unlikely midfield partnership with hard-man Vinnie Jones and led the club to the Second Division title in 1989\u201390.\n\nWith the \"Whites\" now in the First Division, Wilkinson secured a midfield quartet of Strachan, Gary McAllister, David Batty and Gary Speed. They achieved a commendable fourth-place finish in 1990\u201391, and also reached the semi-finals of the League Cup. Strachan was voted FWA Footballer of the Year for his performances during the campaign, becoming the first player to win the award both in Scotland and in England.\n\nStrachan signed a new two-year contract, before captaining Leeds to the league title in 1991\u201392. In so doing, he denied former boss Alex Ferguson and Leeds' hated rivals Manchester United the title. However, Strachan (now nearing age 35) was beginning to feel the effects of his sciatica and missed a number of matches due to his bad back. Following the club's success, Strachan was appointed an OBE for his services to sport.\n\nHowever, Leeds were unable to build on their success, and finished the 1992\u201393 season down in 17th place in what was newly re-branded as the Premier League. Strachan continued to impress though, and was given the club's Player of the Year award. He scored a hat-trick against Blackburn Rovers on 10 April 1993. This was his second hat-trick for Leeds, the first having come in September 1989 when he found the net three times in a 4\u20130 win over promotion rivals Swindon Town in the Second Division at Elland Road.\n\nStrachan managed 37 starts in 1993\u201394, and Leeds rose to fifth. He was rarely selected in the 1994\u201395 season, which would prove to be the end of his spell at Elland Road, where he had spent six years.\n\nCoventry City\n\nIn March 1995, Strachan moved to Coventry City to work as assistant manager under new manager Ron Atkinson, the man who had brought him south of the border to Manchester United 11 years earlier. It was also agreed he would replace Atkinson as manager in summer 1997. Strachan coached the team and led training sessions while learning the finer points of management from Atkinson. He also took to the field at Highfield Road, playing 26 Premier League matches for the Sky Blues over the next two years before finally hanging up his boots in his 40th year. Atkinson signed Aberdeen midfielder Eoin Jess in 1996 purely on the basis of Strachan's recommendation. However, Isa\u00edas left the club after falling-out with Strachan. Coventry signed Gary McAllister for \u00a33 million on wages of \u00a320,000 per week; the deal was done by McAllister's former teammate and friend Strachan, while Atkinson was largely opposed to the deal. The club struggled at the start of the 1996\u201397 campaign, and the club's board of directors asked Atkinson to step aside in November 1996, some months earlier than first agreed, and Strachan was appointed manager.\n\nInternational career\n\nStrachan won his first cap for Scotland on 16 May 1980, in a British Home Championship defeat to Northern Ireland at Windsor Park. Strachan helped Scotland qualify for the 1982 FIFA World Cup and scored a crucial goal in qualifying by scoring the only goal against Sweden at the R\u00e5sunda Stadium in Stockholm. He did not feature in the 1982 British Home Championship, as Jock Stein wanted to rest him for the World Cup, held in Spain. The Scots cruised to a 5\u20132 victory over New Zealand at La Rosaleda Stadium, M\u00e1laga; Strachan was named Man of the Match. Scotland then lost 4\u20131 to a world-class Brazil side at the Estadio Benito Villamar\u00edn, Seville. In the third match, a 2\u20132 draw with the Soviet Union back in M\u00e1laga saw Scotland exit the tournament on goal difference.\n\nScotland also qualified for the 1986 FIFA World Cup. However, shortly after the draw with Wales at Ninian Park on 10 September 1985, Jock Stein died of a heart attack, and his assistant Alex Ferguson took charge for the World Cup campaign. To complete their qualification, they had to beat Australia in a play-off. Strachan played in the first leg at Hampden Park, but did not travel to Melbourne for the second leg. The Scots faced a tough draw in Mexico and lost their opening match 1\u20130 at the Estadio Neza 86 in the Mexico City suburb of Nezahualc\u00f3yotl to the unseeded \u2013 but highly fancied \u2013 Denmark. Strachan then scored in a 2\u20131 defeat to West Germany at the Estadio Corregidora in Queretaro; his goal celebration was memorable, as he tried to climb the advertising hoardings, but was thwarted by his short stature and so merely rested his leg on the hoarding before he was joined by his teammates. In the third and final group match back in Nezahualc\u00f3yotl, Scotland drew 0\u20130 with Uruguay despite their opponents going down to ten men after less than a minute of play when Jos\u00e9 Batista attempted to take Strachan out of the game.\n\nStrachan fell out of the first team picture under Andy Roxburgh, and was omitted from the squad for the 1990 World Cup. Nevertheless, he enjoyed a national team revival between 1990 and 1992, and captained his country in qualification for UEFA Euro 1992. However, he did not travel to Sweden as a member of the squad, as he announced his retirement due to long-term back troubles. He won 50 full caps, and scored five international goals.\n\nManagerial career\n\nCoventry City\n\nWhen Ron Atkinson became Coventry City's director of football in November 1996, Strachan was promoted to the manager's seat. He appointed Alex Miller as his assistant. After an upturn in results, Strachan was named Manager of the Month in December. However, 1 win in 12 matches in the New Year left the \"Sky Blues\" in the relegation zone. Late wins over Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur saved their season though, and relegation was avoided by a one-point margin. Strachan played in the win over Chelsea at Highfield Road at age 40, in what was at the time a record age for an outfield player in the Premier League.\n\nStrachan signed Swedish goalkeeper Magnus Hedman and defender Roland Nilsson, Dutch midfielder George Boateng, and Romanian striker Viorel Moldovan \u2013 all of whom would win international caps. Coventry rose to 11th place in 1997\u201398, and also reached the quarter-finals of the 1997\u201398 FA Cup. After Miller left the club, Strachan replaced him with Garry Pendrey, who would go on to spend many years as his assistant at various clubs. Strachan was again named Manager of the Month in February 1998.\n\nThe club finished 15th in 1998\u201399 and 14th in 1999\u20132000, as Strachan spent \u00a36 million on Irish striker Robbie Keane and \u00a35 million on Moroccans Mustapha Hadji and Youssef Chippo, while selling Dion Dublin to Midlands rivals Aston Villa. Coventry were relegated at the end of the 2000\u201301 season, making Strachan unpopular with fans. New signing Craig Bellamy proved disappointing, while Robbie Keane was sold and Gary McAllister departed for Liverpool. Strachan attempted to launch a promotion campaign by signing striker Lee Hughes, but in the face of increasing supporter unrest, he was sacked five matches into the 2001\u201302 First Division campaign. His replacement, Roland Nilsson, took the club to an 11th-place finish.\n\nSouthampton\n\nStrachan returned to management within weeks, taking the manager's job at Premier League Southampton, who had sacked manager Stuart Gray after a terrible start to their first season at the new St Mary's Stadium. Most pundits had already written off their survival chances by the time of Strachan's appointment in October 2001, but he turned round their fortunes and they finished 11th in the Premier League. The Saints progressed further in 2002\u201303 when they finished eighth and reached the FA Cup Final, where they lost 1\u20130 to Arsenal. As Arsenal had already qualified for the 2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League, Southampton won a place in the UEFA Cup.\n\nIn February 2004, Strachan announced his resignation as Southampton manager after his decision not to stay on at the club in the summer was leaked to the press. He wanted to take a break from football, but was forced to resign earlier than initially intended due to the speculation surrounding his and the club's future following the leak.\n\nCeltic\n\nAfter a 16-month break, Strachan returned to management on 1 June 2005, when he succeeded Martin O'Neill as manager of Celtic in the Scottish Premier League (SPL). For 2005\u201306, his stated aim was to regain the SPL title from rivals Rangers. He had an embarrassing start to his campaign as Celtic manager, losing 5\u20130 to Slovakian champions Artmedia Bratislava on 27 July 2005 and three days later, drawing 4\u20134 with Motherwell in his first SPL match in charge of the Glasgow club. The loss against Artmedia meant Celtic suffered an early exit from European competition, despite winning the return match 4\u20130. After this disastrous start, Celtic started to improve under Strachan. A low-point was the shock defeat in the third round of the Scottish Cup to First Division Clyde on 8 January 2006. However, the following month his team made history when they defeated Dunfermline Athletic 8\u20131, a record victory margin for the SPL at the time. Strachan's first season was ultimately successful as he coached Celtic to victory in the League Cup and, on 5 April 2006, his side clinched the SPL title in record time and with six matches remaining. Reflecting this achievement, Strachan was voted Manager of the Year by the Scottish Football Writers' Association eight days later.\n\nStrachan ahead of Celtic's Champions League qualifier against Spartak Moscow, August 2007\n\nThe following year, Strachan restructured the team and made a series of signings, bringing in players such as Hibernian's Derek Riordan; Chelsea's Ji\u0159\u00ed Jaro\u0161\u00edk; Kenny Miller and Lee Naylor from Wolverhampton Wanderers; Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink from PSV; Thomas Gravesen from Real Madrid; and Paul Hartley and Steven Pressley from Hearts. Celtic flourished and by mid-January 2007 held a 17-point lead in the SPL table. UEFA Champions League football again returned to Celtic Park, the team having automatically qualified for the group stages and drawn alongside Benfica, Copenhagen and Manchester United. Home victories against all three Group F members saw the team progress to the round of 16 of the Champions League for the first time since the competition was re-formatted in 1993. Celtic lost the tie, against eventual winners Milan in extra time, missing out on a place in the quarter-finals. On 22 April 2007, Strachan guided Celtic to their 41st league championship, and second in succession. A 2\u20131 victory against Kilmarnock left Celtic 13 points clear of Rangers with four matches remaining. Later that day, Strachan was recognised as the inaugural PFA Scotland Manager of the Year for 2007. Celtic went on to win the Scottish Cup, beating Dunfermline Athletic.\n\nIn the 2007\u201308 season, Strachan led Celtic into the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League again after defeating Milan, Benfica and Shakhtar Donetsk. However, by April, there was significant criticism from the press and the fans after a 1\u20130 loss to Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup quarter-final and a 1\u20130 loss to ten-man Motherwell in the SPL. However, after defeating Rangers twice at home, on 22 May 2008 Strachan became only the third ever Celtic manager to guide the club to three consecutive Scottish league titles.\n\nDespite winning the League Cup after extra time against Rangers, after failing to lead Celtic to another league title in the 2008\u201309 season, he resigned as manager on 25 May 2009.\n\nMiddlesbrough\n\nStrachan signed a four-year contract with English Championship team Middlesbrough on 26 October 2009, succeeding Gareth Southgate. He had been linked with the Middlesbrough manager's job 15 years earlier, when still a Leeds United player. His first match in charge was on 31 October, a 1\u20130 defeat to Plymouth Argyle, with Adam Johnson missing a penalty. On 5 December, Middlesbrough won their first match under Strachan, 5\u20131 away to Queens Park Rangers. After a poor run of results, including a 3\u20130 loss at home to Blackpool and a 1\u20130 loss at home to Cardiff City, Strachan earned his first home win after his team beat Scunthorpe United 3\u20130.\n\nAfter a poor start to the 2010\u201311 season meant Middlesbrough were down in 20th place, Strachan left the club by mutual consent on 18 October. He voluntarily tore up his contract and left without compensation.\n\nScotland\n\nStrachan was appointed manager of the Scotland national team on 15 January 2013, succeeding Craig Levein. His first match in charge was at Pittodrie Stadium in a friendly match against Estonia on 6 February. The game ended 1\u20130 to Scotland, with Charlie Mulgrew getting his first international goal. Scotland suffered defeats to Wales and Serbia in Strachan's first two competitive matches, which ended the Scots' slim chances of qualification for the 2014 World Cup. After this, Scotland had an upturn in form, winning both matches against Croatia and away against Macedonia. Scotland finished fourth in qualifying Group A.\n\nIn Euro 2016 qualifying, Scotland appeared to have a better chance of qualification as the finals tournament was expanded from 16 teams to 24, but were drawn in a tough group with Germany, Poland and the Republic of Ireland. After losing their opening match in Germany, Scotland recorded home wins against Georgia, Ireland and Gibraltar, and away draws against Poland and Ireland. In their following match, Scotland produced an \"insipid\" performance, as they lost 1\u20130 in Georgia. A home defeat by Germany left Scotland four points behind third-placed Ireland, with two matches to play. In the penultimate matches of the group, Scotland needed to beat Poland, or hope that Ireland would lose to Germany. Scotland came from behind to lead 2\u20131 in their match, but Ireland had scored the only goal of their match, leaving the Scots needing a win to stay alive. A late scrambled goal by Robert Lewandowski gave Poland a draw that eliminated Scotland from contention. Strachan bemoaned what he perceived to be bad luck. After a win against Gibraltar in the last qualifier, Strachan agreed to a new contract with the Scottish Football Association. After failing to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Strachan resigned from his position on 12 October 2017.\n\nManagement style\n\nTypically playing a traditional 4\u20134\u20132 formation, and very occasionally 4\u20135\u20131, Strachan is widely known for his rigorous management style, and states that he watches video replays of his club's matches two, sometimes three, times. He also places great emphasis on player health and fitness, forbidding his players to drink alcohol excessively or regularly, and often giving dietary advice to his players, attributing his own longevity as a player to a strict and somewhat unusual diet involving seaweed. Players such as Scotland international Gary Caldwell have attributed their success at Celtic to lifestyle changes enforced by Strachan.\n\nRenowned for his deadpan humour in media interviews, quotes attributed to Strachan have become part of popular football culture.\n\nEnmity with Alex Ferguson\n\nDespite playing for Alex Ferguson at two clubs, the pair had an ongoing public feud during Strachan's managerial career. In his 1999 autobiography, the former Manchester United manager said, \"I decided this man could not be trusted an inch \u2013 I would not want to expose my back to him in a hurry.\" In his own 2006 autobiography, in response to Ferguson's comments, Strachan said he was \"surprised and disappointed\". The rivalry dates from Strachan's time playing under Ferguson, first at Aberdeen and later Manchester United. In August 2006, after his Celtic team was drawn to play Ferguson's Manchester United in the Champions League, Strachan said that there was no longer any enmity between the two managers.\n\nOther work\n\nStrachan has analysed football matches for the media, including alongside Adrian Chiles on BBC Sport's Match of the Day 2. He has worked as a regular pundit for ITV's coverage of the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League. During the 2014 World Cup, he worked as a pundit for ITV. In April 2019, Strachan apologised for remarks he made during The Debate on Sky Sports. Following the release of convicted sex offender Adam Johnson from prison, Strachan had appeared to suggest that abusing Johnson for that offence was comparable with racial abuse.\n\nFor the 2006 World Cup, Strachan was appointed as the official FIFA Ambassador for Scotland, joining 50 others in fundraising for SOS Children's Villages, the official charity of the tournament.\n\nStrachan and his two sons started their own football school in the Coventry area in August 2009.\n\nIn July 2019, Strachan was appointed to a technical director position with Dundee.\n\nPersonal life\n\nStrachan married Lesley Scott in 1977; George Mackie was his best man. Together, they had three children: Craig and Gavin Strachan, also footballers, and Gemma Strachan.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nClub\n\nClub performance League Cup League Cup Continental Total Season Club League Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Scotland League Scottish Cup League Cup Europe Total 1974\u201375 Dundee Division One 1 0 1975\u201376 Premier Division 23 6 1976\u201377 Division One 36 7 1977\u201378 Division One 9 0 1977\u201378 Aberdeen Premier Division 12 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 16 1 1978\u201379 31 5 4 0 8 0 3 1 46 6 1979\u201380 33 10 5 1 11 4 2 0 51 15 1980\u201381 20 6 0 0 6 3 4 0 30 9 1981\u201382 30 7 6 4 8 6 6 3 50 20 1982\u201383 32 12 3 0 7 7 10 1 52 20 1983\u201384 25 13 7 2 6 0 9 3 47 18 England League FA Cup League Cup Europe Total 1984\u201385 Manchester United First Division 41 15 7 2 2 0 6 2 56 19 1985\u201386 28 5 5 0 1 0 0 0 34 5 1986\u201387 34 4 2 0 2 0 0 0 38 4 1987\u201388 36 8 3 0 5 1 0 0 44 9 1988\u201389 21 1 6 0 3 0 0 0 30 1 1988\u201389 Leeds United Second Division 11 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 11 3 1989\u201390 46 16 1 0 2 1 0 0 49 17 1990\u201391 First Division 34 7 6 1 7 1 0 0 47 9 1991\u201392 36 4 0 0 4 1 0 0 40 5 1992\u201393 Premier League 31 4 4 0 3 1 5 1 43 6 1993\u201394 33 3 3 1 2 0 0 0 38 4 1994\u201395 6 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 7 0 1994\u201395 Coventry City Premier League 5 0 1995\u201396 12 0 1996\u201397 9 0 Total Scotland 252 68 England 383 70 Career total 635 138\n\nInternational appearances\n\nAs of 29 October 2018\n\nNational team Year Apps Goals Scotland 1980 7 1 1981 2 0 1982 8 0 1983 9 1 1984 2 0 1985 5 0 1986 6 2 1987 2 0 1989 2 0 1991 5 1 1992 2 0 Total 50 5\n\nInternational goals\n\nAs of 29 October 2018\n\nNo. Date Venue Cap Opponent Score Result Competition 1 10 September 1980 R\u00e5sunda Stadium, Stockholm 6 Sweden 1\u20130 1\u20130 1982 FIFA World Cup qualification 2 12 June 1983 Empire Stadium, Vancouver 22 Canada 1\u20130 2\u20130 Friendly match 3 26 March 1986 Hampden Park, Glasgow 34 Romania 1\u20130 3\u20130 Friendly match 4 8 June 1986 Estadio La Corregidora, Queretaro 36 West Germany 1\u20130 1\u20132 1986 FIFA World Cup 5 1 May 1991 Stadio Olimpico, Serravalle 46 San Marino 1\u20130 2\u20130 UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying\n\nManagerial record\n\nAs of 8 October 2017 (competitive club matches and all international matches)\n\nTeam From To Record G W D L Win % Coventry City 5 November 1996 10 September 2001 215 70 56 89 0 32.56 Southampton 22 October 2001 13 February 2004 110 39 32 39 0 35.45 Celtic 1 June 2005 25 May 2009 182 122 28 32 0 67.03 Middlesbrough 26 October 2009 18 October 2010 46 13 13 20 0 28.26 Scotland 15 January 2013 12 October 2017 40 19 9 12 0 47.50 Total 593 263 138 192 0 44.35\n\nHonours\n\nPlayer\n\nAberdeen\n\nScottish Premier Division: 1979\u201380, 1983\u201384\n\nScottish Cup: 1981\u201382, 1982\u201383, 1983\u201384\n\nEuropean Cup Winners' Cup: 1982\u201383\n\nEuropean Super Cup: 1983\n\nManchester United\n\nFA Cup: 1984\u201385\n\nLeeds United\n\nFootball League Second Division: 1989\u201390\n\nFootball League First Division: 1991\u201392\n\nFA Charity Shield: 1992\n\nIndividual\n\nIOC European Footballer of the Season: 1982\u201383\n\nSFWA Footballer of the Year: 1979\u201380\n\nPFA Team of the Year Second Division: 1989\u201390\n\nPFA Team of the Year First Division: 1990\u201391\n\nFWA Footballer of the Year: 1990\u201391\n\nScotland national football team roll of honour: 1992\n\nLeeds United Player of the Year: 1993\n\nPFA Merit Award: 1995\n\nEnglish Football Hall of Fame inductee: 2016\n\nManager\n\nSouthampton\n\nFA Cup runner-up: 2002\u201303\n\nCeltic\n\nScottish Premier League: 2005\u201306, 2006\u201307, 2007\u201308\n\nScottish Cup: 2006\u201307\n\nScottish League Cup: 2005\u201306, 2008\u201309\n\nIndividual"}], "Gordon David Strachan won the Scottish League Cup twice.": [{"url": "https://www.scottishfootballmuseum.org.uk/exhibitions/hall-of-fame/gordon-strachan/", "page_content": "Inducted in 2007\n\n1957 \u2014\n\nCurrent Scotland manager Gordon Strachan is now a high profile manager but he was successful at club level too especially with Aberdeen, Manchester United and Leeds where he was voted Player of the Year in 1991.

He won two Scottish League Championship titles, three Scottish Cups, the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup and the European Super Cup. He also won the FA Cup in 1985 and the Football League Second Division in 1990 and the First Division in 1992.\n\nAs a manager, Strachan would lead his Southampton side to the 2003 FA Cup final, losing 1-0 to Arsenal.

Strachan wasn\u2019t the only new face in the Leeds side that day, with fellow new recruit Chris Fairclough also included in the side for the first time as Ian Baird\u2019s goal secured the Whites all three points. Strachan\u2019s appearance against Portsmouth was the first of 245 outings he would make for Leeds.\n\nManager Howard Wilkinson who had arrived in the previous October from Sheffield Wednesday had at this point steered the side away from the threat of relegation and was now intent on building a side to challenge for promotion in the following 1989/90 season. The arrival of Strachan from arch rivals Manchester United was seen as a major coup for the club. Like Wilkinson, Strachan dropped down from the First Division to join Second Division Leeds and arrived with a glorious playing career, having won the Scottish Football League twice, the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup and European Super Cup with Aberdeen, along with the FA Cup at Manchester United. Wilkinson, managing director Bill Fotherby and chairman Leslier Silver all played key roles in persuading Strachan to move to Elland Road and it went on to be one of the most successful periods in the club\u2019s history.\n\n\ufeff\n\nWilkinson named Strachan as his captain for the 1989/90 season. The Whites manager made more additions throughout the summer and five players made their debuts in the opening day defeat away at Newcastle United. Strachan scored his first goal of the campaign in a 1-1 draw away at Stoke City in September. He scored his only hat-trick for the club against Swindon Town as the Robins were defeated 4-0 at Elland Road as Leeds made it six unbeaten in the league following the opening loss, moving up to fourth spot.\n\nIn November, Strachan netted in back to back home games as Plymouth were beaten 2-1 and AFC Bournemouth defeated 3-0 as Leeds\u2019 unbeaten league run reached 15 games, with the club now sitting in second spot. He then netted for his third straight league match, but Leeds\u2019 good run came to an end with a narrow 4-3 defeat against Leicester City at Filbert Street. Throughout January and February, Strachan once more scored in three straight league matches against Stoke City, Swindon Town and Hull City.\n\nIn our final home match of the season, Strachan scored a vital goal in the 84th minute with a fabulous strike from the edge of the area. Leicester City were defeated 2-1 at Elland Road and it meant Leeds went into the final day of the season away at Bournemouth top of the league, knowing victory would secure both promotion and the Second Division Championship. Strachan led Leeds out at Dean Court and Lee Chapman\u2019s goal secured the Whites a 1-0 victory and promotion to the top flight. Strachan followed in the footsteps of Jim Baker and Bobby Collins in captaining Leeds to glory in the second tier, playing in all 46 league games and scoring a total of 16 goals.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 \"Have you ever seen a better goal, and seen one better timed?\" https://t.co/IYP90JQ6Ee pic.twitter.com/5m9ADWnWpm \u2014 Leeds United (@LUFC) March 25, 2020\n\nGary McAllister was brought in from Leicester City ahead of the 1990/91 First Division campaign and he formed the final piece of an iconic midfield, including Strachan and young duo David Batty and Gary Speed who had come through the ranks at the club. The Whites began life back in the top flight with a 3-2 victory over Everton at Goodison Park and Strachan scored his first goal of the season in a 2-0 victory over fellow newly promoted side Sheffield United at Elland Road. He netted against Arsenal in September before again netting three in a row against Nottingham Forest, Manchester City and Derby County in November. He was on the score-sheet against Everton and Luton Town and also helped the club reach the semi-final of the League Cup, but the Whites were defeated by Manchester United over two legs. Strachan ended the season having played in 34 of Leeds\u2019 38 league matches, scoring seven goals. Leeds finished fourth place in the first season back in the top flight, picking up 64 points.\n\nWilkinson strengthened the side again for the 1991/92 campaign, in what was the last ever First Division, prior to the formation of the Premier League. Leeds made a great start to the campaign going 10 games unbeaten, with Strachan netting a brace in a 4-0 away win at Southampton, along with efforts in a 2-2 draw with Arsenal and 3-0 victory over Manchester City at Elland Road. Strachan missed Leeds\u2019 first league defeat of the season against Crystal Palace and the Whites went 22 First Division matches undefeated with Strachan in the side, before falling to defeat away at Oldham Athletic in February 1992.\n\n\ufeffLeeds and Strachan\u2019s former club Manchester United had been neck and neck in the race for the title throughout the campaign, but Leeds\u2019 hopes suffered a major blow after a 4-0 defeat at Maine Road against Manchester City left Manchester United a point ahead of Leeds with two games in hand and a total of seven left to play. After both sides drew on Saturday 18th April, Manchester United had gained a two point advantage and had four games left to Leeds\u2019 three. However with the title looking like it was heading over the Pennines, there was a final twist. Strachan captained Leeds to victory over Coventry City, whilst Manchester United were defeated at home to Nottingham Forest, which saw Leeds go top. The Red Devils then lost their game in hand away at West Ham and on Sunday 26th April, Leeds went to Bramall Lane and defeated Sheffield United 3-2. In the late kick-off, Manchester United lost a third game in a row at Liverpool, ensuring Leeds had won the First Division title for the third time in the club\u2019s history. In the final game of the campaign against Norwich City at Elland Road, Strachan became the second Leeds captain to lift the First Division, just as Billy Bremner had done in 1969 and 1974.\n\n\ufeff\n\n\n\nStrachan came on as a substitute in the 1992 Charity Shield victory over Liverpool and made 44 appearances in all competitions in the following season, scoring six goals and was named the club\u2019s Player of the Year. He was also awarded an OBE for his services to football.\n\nThe 1993/94 season was Strachan\u2019s last full season at Leeds and he made 38 appearances. His final Leeds match came in the 1994/95 campaign, on New Year\u2019s Eve as Liverpool defeated the Whites 2-0 at Elland Road. Strachan announced his retirement from football, before eventually being tempted to move to Coventry City in March 1994 to become a player coach, ahead of going on to manage the club. He also went on to have managerial stints at Southampton, Celtic, Middlesbrough and the Scotland national side.\n\nStrachan remains a club icon at Leeds United and remains the only captain to have lifted both the Second Division and First Division titles."}, {"url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/gordon-strachans-brilliant-response-alex-29871038", "page_content": "There's a twinkle in Gordon Strachan\u2019s eye as he casts his mind back 40 years this month to the Scottish Cup Final of 1983.\n\nThe day that Aberdeen backed up their incredible European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup triumph over Real Madrid by beating Rangers at Hampden thanks to Eric Black\u2019s extra-time winner \u2013 only to earn the rollicking of all time from gaffer Alex Ferguson. \u201cWe\u2019re the luckiest team in the world,\u201d Fergie ranted in an interview on the Hampden turf minutes after Willie Miller had held the cup aloft. \u201cWe were a disgrace of a performance.\n\n\u201cMiller and (Alex) McLeish won the Cup for Aberdeen. Miller and McLeish played Rangers themselves. And I\u2019m not caring, winning cups doesn\u2019t matter. Our standards have been set long ago and I\u2019m not going to accept that from any Aberdeen team. No way can we take any glory from it.\u201d\n\nStrachan is speaking on our Off The Record podcast and there\u2019s a gleefulness as the memories roll in. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to him (Ferguson) about this and told him it\u2019s made me laugh for the last 40 years. Not at the time, but it\u2019s wonderful.\n\n\u201cAt the time, it was like: \u2018What happened there? Did we not just win that?\u2019 We had our winners\u2019 medals on the bus and everybody\u2019s crying, not speaking to each other. He kept saying: \u2018McLeish and Miller won it, McLeish and Miller won it\u2019.\n\n\u201cSo every time I see big Alex, he asks me: \u2018Have you still got that medal I won for you?\u2019\n\n\u201cUsually you get an open top bus when you win the cup, but we really just needed a tandem. Willie and Alex waving from their tandem. The whole day was hilarious and it was really strange behaviour but when you look back on it now, it\u2019s absolute gold and I wouldn\u2019t have missed it for the world.\u201d\n\nStrachan had his fall-outs with Fergie but time has mellowed both firebrands and they now have a warm relationship. And the former Dons midfielder admits that learning from arguably Britain\u2019s greatest manager of all time was a privilege. \u201cWe thought we were competitive before he arrived, but we weren\u2019t really,\u201d he admits. \u201cWe were bad tempered, girny, moany wee kids. He changed it from that to: \u2018Do you really want to win? Well, your whole life has to be about being ready to win.\n\n\u2018You have to give up everything to win. You have to be disliked to win and you have to change your mentality if you really want to win.\u2019 He taught us what winning meant. And we were just scared of getting beat - absolutely petrified!\u201d\n\nStrachan smiles at memories of the player he was initially, to the player he became under the gruff Glaswegian. I was useless for a year when I went to Aberdeen,\u201d he says. Absolutely minging.\n\n\u201cWhen they named the team over the tannoy, No.6 Willie Miller would get a big cheer. No.7 Gordon Strachan... mumbling. But what would you pay to be in a dressing room with Sir Alex at his best? We had it for 300-400 games.\n\n\u201cAt times you thought it was a bit much, but it was wonderful. Looking back now, how lucky were we to be at that point when Sir Alex was at his rawest? Forget wind and sea and waves, he could have created energy from that dressing room. The standards were everywhere. Everything we did, the way we dressed. He\u2019d know where we were.\n\n\u201cThe discipline was there even for the youth team players. My babysitters were Bryan Gunn and Eric Black. Sir Alex would ask them where they were going on a Saturday night and they\u2019d tell him and he\u2019d say: \u2018No you\u2019re not, you\u2019re babysitting for McGhee or Strachan.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt worked both ways \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t go out and have a drink AND on the Monday morning he\u2019d have them in and ask them: \u2018What time did Strachan get in on Saturday night.? Was he with McGhee? Were they eating curries?\u2019\n\n\u201cI remember getting sent off against Tottenham in a friendly on a Tuesday night, so he sent me up to Elgin with the B team the following night! The discipline was unbelievable.\u201d\n\nStrachan and Ferguson were front and centre of a golden era for Scottish football in the early 80s. People think Aberdeen dominated the 80s. Well, you had Dundee United and Celtic. Celtic were a right good side. They won the league twice, Dundee United won it once.\n\n\u201cIn the UEFA rankings, Aberdeen were first at one point, Celtic got to 11th and Dundee United got to between 11th and 15th at times. So to win that league at that time, not only did you have to beat Rangers \u2013 you had to beat two of the top teams in Europe.\n\n\u201cIt was phenomenal. Dundee United were getting to finals, beating Barcelona.That was a wonderful period for Scottish football. The competitiveness was unbelievable. The Dundee United team was magnificent and the Rangers team was always going to give you\n\nproblems. We played them in a couple of finals and they were always there, so you had to beat some of the best teams in Europe to win the league.\u201d\n\nStrachan had moved to Manchester United by the time the pair were reunited with Scotland. \u201cI always knew he\u2019d end up going somewhere,\u201d he added. \u201cAt the 1986 World Cup he was in the room next to me and I asked him one morning if he was thinking of moving on. \u2018I\u2019m only going to leave Aberdeen for Barcelona or Man United,\u2019 he said, and I\u2019m hoping to Christ it\u2019s Barcelona!\n\n\u201cI should have known because people at Manchester United like Martin Edwards always kept asking me questions about him.\n\n\u201cThey were picking my brains. When Sir Alex came down it took him a wee while to get it going because he had huge characters there.\n\n\u201cIt was like a football party kind of atmosphere at Manchester United. It took him a while to sort that out and then we became a different animal. But I bet they are glad now that they gave him that time for it to happen.\u201d\n\nREAD NEXT"}, {"url": "https://www.thecelticwiki.com/managers/strachan-gordon/", "page_content": "Personal\n\nFullname: Gordon David Strachan\n\naka: Gordon Strachan, WGS (Wee Gordon Strachan)\n\nHeight: 5.06\n\nWeight: 10.06\n\nBorn: 9 Feb 1957\n\nBirthplace: Muirhouse, Edinburgh, Scotland\n\nPosition (as a player): RHS Midfielder (attacking)\n\nInternationals (as a player): Scotland\n\nInternational Caps (as a player): 50 caps\n\nInternational Goals (as a player): 5 goals\n\nManager: 1 June 2005 \u2013 25 May 2009\n\nSucceeding: Martin O\u2019Neill\n\nSuccessor: Tony Mowbray\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if there is another big club where the supporters have a love like the supporters have a love for this club.\u201d\n\nWGS on the Celtic fans (quote taken from \u201cCeltic Minded 2\u201d (book), 2006)\n\nPlayer\n\nDuring his playing career he played for\n\nDundee (1974-1977),\n\nAberdeen (1977-1984),\n\nManchester United (1984-1989),\n\nLeeds United (1989-1995) and\n\nCoventry City (1995-1997).\n\nHe won 50 international caps for Scotland and is in the Scotland Football Hall of Fame.\n\nGordon Strachan was an aggressive, skilful right-sided midfield player. He never played for Celtic as a player, and generally was not the most popular opposition player. Nippy and aggressive, he irked some of the Celtic support but mostly it was due to his ability as being just a great player for Aberdeen during a golden period for them.\n\nOverall, he was a great entertaining Scottish player and the Celtic support appreciated that at least.\n\nManagement\n\nWGS became Coventry City\u2019s Director of Football in November 1996.\n\nHe finally retired as a player at the end of the season after making his last appearance at the age of 40, a record in the English Premiership.\n\nStrachan kept Coventry in the Premiership until 2001, when they finally went down after 34 years of top division football. He was sacked shortly after the start of the 2001-02 Division One campaign.\n\nGordon Strachan returned to management within weeks, taking the manager\u2019s job at Southampton \u2013 after Strachan\u2019s appointment in October 2001, they finished 11th in the Premiership.\n\nIn 2002-03 when they finished eighth and reached the FA Cup final, where they lost 1-0 to Arsenal, but since Arsenal had qualified for the UEFA Champions League, Southampton qualified for the 2003-04 UEFA Cup.\n\nIn March 2004, Gordon Strachan announced his resignation as Southampton manager, earlier than intended because he wanted to spend time with his family.\n\nWhen Berti Vogts stepped down as Scottish national coach, Strachan was widely tipped to take over until Walter \u201cWattie\u201d Smith got the job, and he was even linked with the manager\u2019s job at Portsmouth, but turned down the offer to take over. He later took on the Scotland role from January 2013 as the popular choice amongst the Scotland support, resigning in October 2017 after failing to get Scotland through to at least the play-offs of the 2018 World Cup, and having not qualified to Euro 2016.\n\nGordon Strachan has also been an analyst of football matches for the media, most notably on the BBC\u2019s Match of the Day 2 show. Renowned for his deadpan humour as much as his shrewd tactical awareness, quotes attributed to Strachan have become legendary among football supporters.\n\nAs Celtic Manager\n\nGordon Strachan finally returned to management on 1 June 2005, when he succeeded Martin O\u2019Neill as manager of Celtic in the Scottish Premier League (SPL).\n\nHe resigned on 25 May 2009, after 4 years in charge having won the league three times in a row, with a lot to look on to be proud on, both domestically and in European competition.\n\nPREMIER LEAGUE CIS LEAGUE CUP SCOTTISH CUP EUROPE TOTALS SEASON P W D L F A PTS P W D L F A P W D L F A P W D L F A P W D L F A 2005-06 38 28 7 3 93 37 91 4 4 0 0 9 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 2 1 0 1 4 5 45 33 7 5 107 46 2006-07 38 26 6 6 65 34 84 2 1 1 0 3 1 5 5 0 0 13 3 8 3 1 4 9 10 53 35 8 10 90 48 2007-08 38 28 5 5 84 26 89 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 2 1 1 9 3 8 3 0 5 7 10 52 34 6 12 102 42 2009-09 38 24 10 4 80 33 82 4 4 0 0 9 1 3 2 0 1 4 3 6 1 2 3 4 7 51 31 12 8 97 44 TOTALS 152 106 28 18 322 130 346 12 10 1 1 23 7 13 9 1 3 27 11 24 8 3 13 24 32 201 133 33 35 396 180\n\nFirst season (2005-06)\n\nFor 2005/06, his stated aim was to regain the SPL title off current holders (Rangers).\n\nThings didn\u2019t exactly get off swimmingly, and an embarrassing start to his campaign as Celtic manager losing 5-0 to Slovakian champions Artmedia Bratislava on 27 July 2005 and 3 days later only managing to draw 4-4 away to Motherwell in his first SPL match in charge of the Glasgow club. A few days later he recorded his first win in charge as Celtic won 4-0 in the return leg of the Champions League qualifier.\n\nHowever, that was not enough to avoid being put out of Europe before the season had got started in earnest. For many Celtic fans, these set of matches set the tone (for both WGS and the supporters) on how the mentality on governing the side\u2019s tactics was to be for future matches. It was a huge psychological blow, and some fans never seemed to forgive him. It was too regularly brought up in seasons to come.\n\nNevertheless, Celtic improved under Strachan, leading the SPL by as much as 20 points at one point despite playing with a defence that came under regular criticism from the media and fans. Rangers were in turmoil as Alex McLeish lurched from one disaster to another. Two notable victories over Rangers in November (scoring 5 goals and conceding none) was a gem of a time, and saw the emergence of Shaun Maloney as a front runner for the team.\n\nNot all went Celtic\u2019s way, and another low-point was the shock defeat in the third-round of the Scottish Cup to First Division Clyde on 8 January 2006. However, the following month his team made history when they beat Dunfermline Athletic 8-1, a record victory margin for the SPL. Over the period after beating Rangers twice in November, the First Team went through a poor spell for two months where the First Team went behind in too many games, but thankfully fought back in to recover.\n\nWorse was that the First Team kept on conceding goals in all the games. It was not until Celtic played against Rangers in mid-February that the first team had a game that they didn\u2019t concede a goal in.Celtic were winning games but the weaknesses of the side were beginning to be seen, and in many ways they were the weaknesses that were to begin to haunt Celtic for over the next couple of seasons.\n\nAn important point that has to be made is that this was a season of transition, and anyone taking over from Martin O\u2019Neill as manager was going to have a hard task in front of them (a lot to live up to). Spats with Sutton and Agathe, saw both leave prematurely yet both could have contributed more. On the other hand, the players have to take in that the old regime was over and you have to understand and work with the new regime. With the less than stellar playing achievements of both after leaving Celtic, maybe WGS was right. Sutton in particular can be a prickly character and not predictable, so maybe it was best to move him on.\n\nOverall, Strachan\u2019s first season was ultimately successful as he coached Celtic to victory in the Scottish League Cup and, on 5 April 2006, his side clinched the SPL title in record time with six matches remaining. A difficult year of transition, but he\u2019d won most over to his side at this point.\n\nReflecting this achievement, Strachan was voted \u2018Manager of the Year\u2018 by the Scottish Football Writers\u2019 Association eight days after the title was clinched.\n\nThis was just the beginning, and much better was expected of both him and the team in the next season in terms of entertainment and results (goals conceded, scored etc).\n\nSecond season (2006-07)\n\nHis second season was even more of a roller coaster compared to his first, with excuses out the window for many, and the arrival of Paul le Guen (PLG) seen by the press as leading \u201cLe Revolution\u201d at Rangers to challenge Celtic. To the surprise of practically everyone, there was no actual domestic challenge. Rangers went comedic from failure to tragic farce, and Celtic simply took advantage going over 20 points ahead of them at one point in the season. In games v Rangers, the best PLG did was one draw. The \u2018Hearts Revolution\u2019 was also a joke with their challenge petering out before it had even began.\n\nKnocked out early in the league cup was no issue, and WGS easily made it up with winning the Scottish Cup to wrap up a cup and league double. Overall, WGS was having a respite domestically from any strong challenge, but nobody should understate the level of his achievement. Whilst others floundered, he ensured that Celtic did not, and the players were building up a fair reputation as a unit.\n\nThe Champions League was where it\u2019s at, and there he excelled. Despite a tough group, Celtic won all three home games, with a special victory against Man Utd which led Celtic to qualify from the Group stages for the first time. You can\u2019t understate the work done by Gordon Strachan in this. He galvanised the players and had set them out correctly to push further than they expected. Not a unit of players as highly rated together as the best under Martin O\u2019Neill yet they achieved what they did not. The players were fit and able, and were pushing to the last minute of matches. It made a whole difference. Strachan was able to utilise players like Nakamura to his best and it was paying out.\n\nOn the other hand,Celtic were poor away from home and lost all 3 games, with WGS stating that he knew the problem and would have it resolved. The next round v AC Milan was very special for the Support, and WGS held to what he said and the first team didn\u2019t concede in 180mins of football, but sadly didn\u2019t score either. Ultimately,Celtic were outdone by a classic goal by Kaka in extra time. A sad way to go out, but a great achievement by WGS and he deserves all the credit in the world.\n\nRegardless of the European achievements, some criticism must also be put at WGS for his second season domestically. The quality of football in the last third of the season in particular was appalling, and the player effort by too many of the squad was deemed non-existent. Rangers\u2019 new manager (Walter Smith) had the better of WGS with a very comfortable win in the last game v Rangers in the season, and Celtic lost in some very drab games. People pay to enjoy the product on the pitch, it really was not good at Celtic. It wasn\u2019t \u2018The Celtic Way\u2019.\n\nA number of the signings were disappointing that season, Gravesen, Miller and Jarosik in particular, whilst Jan Venegoor of Hasselink was injured too often. A spat with Maloney over new contracts saw the club lose a great new wee player (transferred to Aston Villa) and the defence was as bad at the end of the season as at the start. The manager appeared to bamboozle and patronise fans on many occasions with his team selections, and what appeared to be a continuing spat with Derek Riordan saw the player play few games and being overshadowed by the far less productive Kenny Miller. A round of boos as Riordan was taken off in one match late in the season was evidence of this. It was a sorry situation.\n\nMany fans were simply disillusioned by WGS at the end despite the successes, and simply couldn\u2019t see where he was taking the team. The fear was that the club was moving backwards despite what had been accomplished in the last year. This should have put an end to the rubbish that the fans didn\u2019t like him as he wasn\u2019t a \u201cCeltic man\u201d (lazy journalism), it was all because of the criticisms as said above. A real roller coaster of a season, and after all the achievements in the season it\u2019s sad to have to have to summarise it all in a negative tone.\n\nThird season (2007-08)\n\nFor WGS, this season had seen him lose the support of most of the fans. However the death of Tommy Burns and his near breakdown after his loss (a close friend and work colleague) showed a side of WGS which many had not seen before in his time here.\n\nThe Support all felt for him and just how much the job and the club really did mean to him. Winning the league against the odds (big odds at that) appeared to have moved the fans and split the fans opinion on him whether to stay or go at the end of it all.\n\nThis season for WGS can be termed a success on paper. To quote him, the team achieved what he set out at the start of the year to do. On paper, Celtic won the league (three in a row) and got through the Champs League group stages again (two in a row) which cemented the club as being more than just a flash in the pan side as others in the past have been cynically referred as being.\n\nCeltic sold hapless Kenny Miller to Derby County for \u00a33m (amazing!), brought in a few quality players like Barry Robson, beat Rangers twice at home in very entertaining games and so on. Adding in that Celtic were seven points (plus a game played more) behind Rangers going into the end of the season, WGS must be given his due, even by his harshest critic, for leading the team to somehow comeback and win the league. The first team won the last seven games (which included 2 wins v Rangers) and got much pride back. That can\u2019t be smirked at by anyone, and the last win came just a week after Tommy Burns death (not an easy time).\n\nAt the end of the day, his style of football was uninspiring and unentertaining, and he seemed to stick with some players in his squad way beyond what he should have and then moved them on (e.g. Caldwell, Donati, JVoH), demonstrating an inability to accept criticism and that he had been wrong. A public rift with Derek Riordan depicted an unsettled atmosphere in the changing room although other comments by players, like Mark Wilson, Pressley and Venegoor, said otherwise praising WGS for his man management skills.\n\nBringing in Barry Robson into the Celtic team seemed to show admission that he needed steel in a lightweight side (and what a change he made to the team), whilst Hartley was a revelation this season and deserved all the praise in the world. Boruc as ever was great, but a kick up the back side was needed as it took him a year to manage a game where he didn\u2019t lose a goal away from home.\n\nAllegations were thrown at the Celtic support that they were spoilt (see this story) and that the support didn\u2019t like WGS as he wasn\u2019t a \u2018Celtic man\u2018. Complete balderdash and it was simply sloppy & cheapshot journalism. The fans pay up good money to watch Celtic, and many a time the performances were dreadful to watch with the manager unwilling to admit change was needed and seemed to anger many, especially when he criticised the fans for not understanding what he was trying to do. The zonal defensive play was not working, the formations weren\u2019t working and certain players needed a kick up the backside.\n\nThe First Team lost v Inv Caley when they were two ahead, lost against Hibs, Motherwell and even struggled in games v Gretna. The First Team lost the first two games v Rangers, with poor tactics amongst other points to blame for it. Transfers weren\u2019t working out, especially the enigma that was Donati. Taking in the club had spent more money than Rangers, it was embarrassing to go behind in the league and watching Rangers going to the end for a very undeserved potential quadruple (which thankfully they didn\u2019t achieve).\n\nAdding all this up, WGS has to take flak. However, as said, his emotions after Tommy Burns showed his real self to everyone and all felt for him. This season may probably have shown him to be more of a coach than a great manager, but unlike the other pundits on television at least he puts his money where his mouth is and takes up the challenge of football management. Moving on to next season he should have learnt from what had happened to become a more complete rounded manager.\n\nMust be said, any manager who wins three league titles in a row must be doing something right, so maybe the critics amongst the fans are wrong. A late find in Barry Robson was a revelation, whilst bringing Lennon into the coaching staff seemed to freshen things up.\n\nWGS can be quite an enigma but moving into the next season, more entertaining football really was a requirement.\n\nFourth Season (2008-2009)\n\nSo, was WGS to cement his name as a legend at Celtic by achieving the coveted \u201c4-in-a-row\u201d of league titles? But more importantly, it was questioned on how was his relationship with the fans going to develop this year? It was a (near) clean sheet for many on WGS after the emotional end to the last season.\n\nBefore the season had even begun, rumblings (as usual) had restarted about WGS and his transfers. Few buys to excite the fans made many apprehensive about the hope for greater entertainment, but in general the mood was that, despite all else, Celtic were going to win the league (confidence was high).\n\nThe season started off rather easily until the first game v Rangers where basically Celtic were turned over (at home) 4-2 and lucky not to have lost by more. The first team were hopeless, and the daggers were out for the manager. The pent up frustration from sections of the crowd was released in one big explosion, and the tone was decidedly frosty for the rest of the season with respect to the manager\u2019s relationship with the fans. Not a good start.\n\nNevertheless following on from there was a cracking set of games which saw Celtic take advantage and overhaul Rangers to go top of the league. There was some great football in the first third of the season, and this was the best to watch Celtic for a few seasons at least.\n\nAnyhow, the big headaches of the season began with injuries besetting the manager in his aim to overhaul Rangers. Credit to WGS as his policy of squad numbers above single big signings did pay off which enabled Celtic to be able to squad rotate players to cover for gaps in the side and keep their nose in front. Amazingly Celtic went 7pts ahead at the end of November, and December became the brightest time of the season and it was capped off with a Scott McDonald inspired 1-0 victory at Ibrox against Rangers. Great! Everyone thought Celtic were set up for the rest of the campaign. How the support were to be disappointed.\n\nDuring all this was the Champions league escapade. A poor final set of results saw Celtic finish bottom of their group and again fail to win any of the away games (see link for full write-up). After 4 years, WGS still hadn\u2019t managed an away win in Europe, something that can\u2019t be put down to bad luck alone, and something that was noticeable to all. Celtic got the breaks last season in Europe, this time they didn\u2019t.\n\nBack to the league, when did it all begin to go wrong? Basically from the turn of the new year, yet WGS seemed to do little.\n\nWhat was going on? To everyone\u2019s surprise, WGS himself summarised the situation well in a post-match interview:\n\n\u201cYou have to determine your own destiny. The eyes of the football world are upon us all. The question being asked is, \u2018Are you a team that plays just when everything is right for you?\u2019 That can\u2019t happen. The best way for us to recover is to get back on form as quickly as possible.\u201d (Mar 09)\n\nHowever, he quickly turned back to old irritating ways by stating in an interview a few weeks later: \u201cIf anyone can find a negative \u2013 and I\u2019m sure they will \u2013 then they are warped!\u201d after a Dundee Utd game in April where Celtic drew 2-2. Clearly and sadly showed a dividing line between the management and the fans. An unnecessary dig and it was an unworkable relationship. This post-match comment was very insulting and patronising to the support (and uncalled for). Difficult to see how things were going to be mended easily for many. Why exactly did WGS have to patronise and insult the support? Only he could answer this question, but best left to the end of the season.\n\nAdd to that, complaints about the lack of entertaining football were being swatted away with abandonment: \u201cIn terms of entertainment, yes, we do have responsibilities at Celtic and Rangers, because we have greater resources than most clubs up here to entertain, But most of the songs that the supporters sing are all about winning trophies \u2014 they don\u2019t sing nice wee ditties about the beautiful game. No one remembers the beautiful football, but they do remember the defeats.\u201d This line again seemed to show his distance from the Celtic ideal.\n\nOne nice break was the league cup final, beating Rangers 2-0 after extra-time, with both goals scored by two Irish internationals (O\u2019Dea & McGeady).\n\nFrom then on in, little went right for Celtic again, and after dropping points, Celtic were up against Rangers to see who was to win the league. The final league game v Rangers was a failure, losing one-nil and from then on the writing was on the wall.\n\nCeltic had lost the league to a poor Rangers side. The Celtic players did not perform, and the apathy around the club was heart-breaking. It was overall a poor season with under-performing players.\n\nThe football was generally poor to watch and it had been a continual complaint over the past few years. For many who were tired of the turgid football on display this was a bit much, and swathes of empty seats at Celtic matches became the norm rather than exception. With the global credit crunch beginning and hitting one and all, it was not a time to alienate the support. Yet WGS did, so why? Who knows? It doesn\u2019t require much to get on the side of the fans.\n\nThere are many reasons for the loss, but the manager has to take the flak and he was not one to ever take criticism lightly, being self-admittedly easily irritated. In fairness there were mitigating points, e.g. the loss of Barry Robson to injury was probably more costly to the First Team than anyone realised, as he was a strong driving force to the title run-in last season.\n\nWGS handed in his resignation with little surprise the day after the league defeat, and he left rightly with his head held high for his achievements over the past four seasons with uncharacteristically no smart remarks from him (thankfully). There was actually some sadness to see him go as there had been many good memories over his time. He had been the creator of his own downfall this last season, and in his own reflection on this last season will have to admit, to himself at least, where he went wrong.\n\nReview\n\nSo after all that, how should anyone take and look back on WGS? His predecessor is still lauded to this day, and in reflection Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s achievements were hanging over WGS during his whole tenure at the club. Regardless, he had to deal with them, and if truth be said, then WGS can argue that on paper at least he has exceeded on par with what Martin O\u2019Neill achieved. Not that WGS would but the argument of who was the better manager (WGS or MoN) was a never ending debate which is all academic now. Martin O\u2019Neill was blessed to have had Henrik Larsson at hand so comparisons for WGS aren\u2019t easy or likely entirely fair.\n\nForgetting his predecessor, WGS had a few tasks to fulfill. Firstly, was to regenerate the squad and lower the cost base after the more spendthrift MoN years, win the league back and get Celtic further in Europe. On that score, he more than achieved what was set out. Wage costs were reduced, Celtic won the league back and in time achieved getting past the group stages in the Champions League twice in a row. Brilliant stuff.\n\nWinning the league three times in a row, as well as outliving two Rangers managers is surely a sign of success, especially after the hoo-haa over Paul Le Guen\u2019s management signing. Add in some incredible achievements in Europe (e.g. in beating European Cup holders AC Milan, the Naka winner v Manchester Utd, qualifying twice out of the Champions League group stages etc), and he can easily hold his head up high. The support were spoilt with success at many points.\n\nWhen Celtic won the league for the third time with him as manager, there is no denying that he had silenced all the doomsayers who were worrying that Celtic were out of the league title race. That last seven game winning run to win the league title against the odds will be spoken about for many a year. It was a phenomenal achievement to pick the players up and get them motivated. No matter what else can be said of his managerial ability, that was exceptional. The First Team came so close to reaching the quarter-finals of the European Cup in one season and what a mark that would have been. This was all done without the sublime talents of Larsson, Petrov and Sutton.\n\nEurope had been a sore bugbear for predecessor Martin O\u2019Neill, and Gordon Strachan achieved what Martin O\u2019Neill failed to achieve by qualifying past the group stages (and did it twice). It put Celtic on the pedestal with the premier clubs in Europe, and it was a great place to be.\n\nGordon Strachan was the architect for the high points, and when they came off they were exceptional, and WGS deserves all the credit in the world. Post-match interviews could also be enlivened by some of his emotive witticisms, which on a number of occasions lightened the mood and made everyone smile.\n\nThe most exciting game? Well there were many. WGS himself said that the Spartak Moscow win in 2007 was the most exciting and many would agree but defeating Manchester Utd 1-0 to reach the KO stages of the Champions League was also very special.\n\nHe also helped to foster the careers of some of the younger players, such as Maloney, McManus, McGeady & Wilson, and in reflection they will be thankful for the role that WGS has played in their careers. Some will succeed (at Celtic or elsewhere) whilst others inevitably won\u2019t but at least he gave them the opportunity. WGS likely was the best developer of youngsters we\u2019d had for the past twenty years or so. Billy McNeil was the last to have done well with youngsters in the squad.\n\nSo why in reflection, is the mood relatively more sombre over WGS than an outsider would expect? Much of it has been reflected above in the season reviews. The fans can be said to have been very patient with him, but the truth is that the football in general was too often poor to watch and after four years of that, what are the fans to say? He failed with a number of big transfers, and many players seemed to have declined under him rather than improved.\n\nMany fans take the belief that he couldn\u2019t coach well; confusing squad rotations and team selections baffled players as much as fans, and the last season was woeful in so many ways, throwing away major leads. Tackling Rangers in his last two seasons shouldn\u2019t have been as difficult as it was as Celtic were far better resourced, yet tripped up in both seasons and only got out of jail the first time.\n\nHe never helped himself with a number of his post-match remarks either, the \u201cwarped\u201d comment in his last season in particular was particularly poor judgement. He readily admits that he is easily irritated, but he\u2019d been in football for over twenty years and worked in the media for some time, so he should have been able to know how to deal with it. Yet he couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t!\n\nMany would agree that \u201cned-culture\u201d had been on the rise, and WGS in particular had been very vocal on this issue, taking journalists to task on occasion as well. However, when you give a flippant remark to a question or a thinly veil snide remarks to others, then how really is anyone to see him in a different light to those he criticised? Bit extreme but the point stands and he could end up making things worse for himself. All are irked by neds but he made too much of a crusade of it at times, and at Celtic it was the wrong place for his campaign.\n\nCeltic is a social community club, and thefore reflects a cross-section of society. So admittedly the support can have a small share of nefarious characters, but the support does push and emphasise the roots of the club in terms of charity and community, and this in turn is reflected by the good nature and reputation of the support. Winning is not the only aim, it\u2019s also about the ineffable \u201cto play the Celtic Way\u201d. WGS did not seem to comprehend this, and dismissed any criticism of his tactics stating that others didn\u2019t understand what he was trying to do. That was simply nonsense.\n\nHis \u201cwin at the cost of entertainment\u201d style may find favour in the cut-throat English championship but not at Celtic. That in itself had been what has been the crux of the friction between the support and WGS, and that was what created his downfall. He did things by the training manual but that is never sufficient, and he could be quite robotic with his decisions (such as always subbing on players in matches at an exact certain time) so leaving little room for flexibility or showing that he was able to be experimental in matches.\n\nFrom the outside, everything appeared to be rosy as Celtic won trophies but it\u2019s about more than that with the Celtic support. The supporters weren\u2019t most often enjoying the play on the pitch, reflected in the falling attendances.\n\nWGS is actually a very decent man. The players all spoke very highly of him, and there was little if any dissent at the time (McGeady and Riordan apart) even from those who left prematurely, although one or two (e.g. Sutton & Gravesen) have been quite critical of Strachan since leaving but much later on. All Celtic fans who have met him have generally commented well on him. Away from it all, a long one-on-one interview in December 2008 with Radio Scotland brought out his good side and there was a general amount of respect for him from this.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not the full qualification to be a successful football manager, and WGS\u2019 natural managerial ability was below that level which all wish he was at. Maybe if he had spent some time with some great managers learning their skill, he could have been a far better manager. He was a player with Manchester Utd and Aberdeen under Alex Ferguson but his coaching began at Leeds (under the dour Howard Wilkinson) and then Coventry, and sadly it\u2019s those latter clubs that his coaching philosophy stems from. Ex-Celt Gravesen in an interview in 2018 commented on Strachan\u2019s extreme fear of losing games, noting criticisms made to Gravesen on defending the lead when he had scored a hat-trick after the game in question.\n\nAn important point must be noted that WGS is the first Celtic manager to have to grapple with the new media. Martin O\u2019Neill was manager when the internet got going, but it was in its infancy throughout most of MoN\u2019s reign, and the scale and importance in which the internet had taken in WGS\u2019 time had meant that he had another task to take on.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy anymore. Replays and events are dissected more thoroughly and for longer than ever before. There are cameras to capture everything, statisticians to tally up the most mundane of figures and heated wipe-spread discussions begin on the matches before they\u2019re even over (on the forums & social media) and not hours later in the pub as it all used to be. Sky Sports & its peers are everywhere, and unconscious comparisons with richer foreign leagues had been rising, which doesn\u2019t help with the club\u2019s limited resources. Sadly, that was the future, and WGS was the first Celtic manager to deal with it and few seemed to sit back and notice. Maybe if they did then he\u2019d have been cut more slack.\n\nHis biggest mistake? Should have left at the end of 2007/08 season as many fans were calling for. He stayed 12 months longer than he should have, and that set in the rot which accelerated over time. At the end of it all, most fans wanted him gone, and it\u2019s sad to see him have to leave in that kind of atmosphere. Much of it had been of his own creation, and his successor had the unenviable task to rebuild the squad in much the same way that WGS himself had to when he himself began.\n\nFor those who still believe that the Celtic support were irrational, they should take the following comment from Middlesborough legend & ex-player Bernie Slaven on Gordon Strachan\u2019s brief reign at Middlesborough after leaving Celtic, as there are parallels from his comment to the Celtic supporters\u2019 criticisms of Strachan\u2019s time at Celtic:\n\n\u201cAfter a year in charge, we [Middlesborough] had not improved one iota \u2013 the football was average, away results were abysmal, the worst league position in 20 years and he still doesn\u2019t know his best team. It wasn\u2019t just on the field that Strachan let himself down, off the field during post-match interviews he became an embarrassment to himself, the club and the fans. He was arrogant, obnoxious, sarcastic, cutting and rude. He came across to me like a man who was on the borderline of insanity.\u201d\n\nWe hoped WGS all the very best in the future, in whatever direction he was to take. Everyone knows from his honest comments that he grew to love the club, just at times his daft side too often got in the way. He is a good man, and for the great memories all will forever be thankful for them and there were a number of them along the way. In time, all at least missed his sense of humour from his interviews [see Quotes by and on Gordon Strachan].\n\nHe signed off from Celtic with a wonderful speech which contained the following great quote (from the Tommy Burn\u2019s tribute match, full wording below):\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to pretend I came here as a Celtic supporter. I don\u2019t believe in kissing badges to get your support. I didn\u2019t know the words of \u2018Fields of Athenry\u2019\u2026. [but] From today, I\u2019ve become a Celtic supporter.\u201d\n\nGordon Strachan (May 2009)\n\nPost-Celtic & Scotland management\n\nSince leaving Celtic, he had a relatively unsuccessful time as manager at Middlesborough. He took over a set of former Celtic (& Rangers) players to his new club making it dubbed by some as some kind of Glasgow old boys team. It didn\u2019t work out at all, and his time as a club side manager was over.\n\nHe returned to football analysis on TV & Radio, and to the joy of every Celtic fan, he has been incredible towards Celtic. Never hides his sympathy, and talks up the club at every opportunity. Really puts to shame some former players who have taken pot-shots. Without the pressure of management, Strachan has shown his knowledge of the game on TV and applied it in an easy accessible manner for the viewer and is very popular. A very different character to the fish-bowl like environment that a Celtic manager has to endure in Glasgow.\n\nThe support was very much warming to him, and possibly it\u2019s an indication that he may have regretted not having shown this more amiable side during his time at Celtic. Sometimes you don\u2019t know what you have until it\u2019s gone, and maybe only once he was at a distance that he was able to admire what Celtic had offered and given him. The affection that Strachan now has with the support was increasingly mutual as was shown on his frequent trips back to Celtic Park.\n\nMust add that he had acted as a mentor in part for Neil Lennon. At one point there were stories of bringing Strachan back as a paid mentor for Neil Lennon but this didn\u2019t materialise. However, he has still acted as such and Neil Lennon publicly paid his respect to Strachan once after advise given by him which helped Celtic win a vital game against Rangers (and helped keep Neil Lennon in his job).\n\nCuriously, Strachan has claimed that there was no bias against Celtic in his time as manager of the club, but then again Rangers were so bad during much of the spell, bias wouldn\u2019t have made a difference (as it was to do so during Lennon\u2019s reign).\n\nScotland Managerial Tenure\n\nOver his entire time as a manager, his name was continually brought up as a possible future Scotland manager, and with the lack of candidates putting themselves forward for the role, Strachan in January 2013 was announced the new manager. Interestingly, one of the first questions he was posed at his initial press conferences was: \u201cIs this the biggest job in your career so far?\u201d, to which Strachan retorted: \u201cI was manager of Celtic, there\u2019s no bigger job than that!\u201d. Bless him, the support loved him more now than ever.\n\nThere was to be added spice for the Celtic fans. In 2013, Martin O\u2019Neill was announced as the Republic of Ireland manager with ex-Celtic player Roy Keane as his assistant. If you ever read back to the old match threads, reports and reviews by Celtic fans from the 2000\u2019s, a common argument was \u201cMoN v WGS\u201c, as who was the better manager: Martin O\u2019Neill or Gordon Strachan?\n\nThe comparisons were difficult, and the arguments at times nauseating, but in 2014 both Martin O\u2019Neill and Gordon Strachan were drawn to face each other in competitive matches for the Euro Championships. The first match was ironically played at Celtic Park as Hampden was being renovated, and Scotland triumphed 1-0, and the return leg ended 1-1 with ex-Celt Maloney (who had played under both at Celtic) the scorer for Scotland in both games. Nobody was going to truly believe this would settle any old arguments. Time has now passed by for the old debaters, and both managers should be respected for their time at Celtic.\n\nStrachan\u2019s second run at qualification had certain parallels to his time at Celtic, as in the roller-coaster aspect. A grim start to the qualification for the 2018 World Cup was compounded by his stubbornness where he opted to remain loyal to old stalwarts rather than new players or those regarded as currently on form in the Scottish league. Many also argued he had a bias against those based in the Scottish leagues in preference to the English leagues.\n\nThe qualifying campaign for Strachan to the 2018 World Cup was a roller coaster mirroring that of his time at Celtic. Having begun the campaign very poorly, his head was on the block, only to incredibly recover but then fell at the final hurdle. Part of the problem was his initial intransigence to play Celtic players who were then by far the best in the country, publicly rebuking calls for more Celtic players, most notably Griffiths.\n\nA 3-0 loss to Lithuania at the start of the campaign featured no Celtic players, but the turnaround featured a number. His fall at the final hurdle was in part due to the loss of two key Celtic central midfielders (Brown & Armstrong) to injury. The biggest issue was to be his patter, and a post-match comment about Scot\u2019s lacking height & genetics made him lampooned across the footballing circuits and infuriated everyone. He was still rubbing everyone up the wrong way.\n\nOn the other hand, Scotland were again a fighting side under his management. As at Celtic, last minute goals were notable event, e.g. crucial winner v Slovakia in Oct 2017, it was a great attribute. The amount of times his Celtic and Scotland teams have done it is remarkable. There comes a point where you can no longer say it\u2019s luck or fortune, and he genuinely does instil a belief and winning mentality into his teams. Fair enough the football wasn\u2019t always free-flowing and the mentality didn\u2019t necessarily always turn into victories, but the winning belief was a great trait to have.\n\nHe resigned in Oct 2017 after failing to get Scotland through to at least the play-offs of the 2018 World Cup, and having not qualified to the 2016 Euros.\n\nFew were bemoaning the decision, but he had made a rod for his own back. His positives and negatives again came very much to the forefront in this role as it did at his time at Celtic. Sadly he would leave with little to write home about with Scotland (despite some progress) whilst his Celtic tenure had many wonderful highs. If anything, it vindicated the often ambivalent opinion the Celtic fans had of Gordon Strachan over his time at the club.\n\nPost-Football Management\n\nIn a curious twist of fate, his son Gavin Strachan was on the Celtic coaching staff in 2020/21 during the Covid-19 pandemic, and after a trip to Dubai due to Covid-19 isolation of 13 players and the manager & assistant manager, Gavin Strachan was the de facto acting manager for a couple of games. This meant the first father & their son to have managed Celtic.\n\nThere were reports he would join his son at Celtic, with Gordon Strachan given a role as director of football following Neil Lennon\u2019s departure. This was though was shot down by a number in the support, and the board likely backed away from it as at that point there was a lot of friction between the board & the support. Gordon Strachan did eventually return to Celtic for a short consultancy role in 2021.\n\n[\u2026.]\n\nWe wished Gordon Strachan the best.\n\nHonours as Celtic Manager\n\nScottish Premier League winner:\n\nScottish Cup winner:\n\nScottish League Cup winner:\n\nSPFA Manager of the Year:\n\n2005\u201306, 2006\u201307, 2008-09\n\nSPL Manager of the Year:\n\nPictures\n\nQuotes\n\nForums\n\nArticles"}, {"url": "https://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/gordon-david-strachan-1535.php", "page_content": "Before he professionally started playing football, he was offered a contract by Eddie Turnbull to play for a club, but his father opposed the decision by stating that the club did not cover sufficient expenses.\n\nGeorge David Strachan was born to Jim and Catherine in Muirhouse, Edinburgh.

With Hampden one of the host venues for the next European Championship, Scotland will be even more desperate to end their qualification hoodoo.\n\nBut who can become the first Scotland manager since Craig Brown to get the team over the line?\n\nIt's a question that will preoccupy the minds of SFA board members, supporters and journalists alike but with no further confirmed fixtures in the diary, it will not necessarily be a quick appointment.\n\nThe waiting continues."}, {"url": "https://www.thesportsdb.com/player/34171859-Gordon-Strachan", "page_content": "Gordon David Strachan OBE (born 9 February 1957) is a Scottish football coach and former player.
