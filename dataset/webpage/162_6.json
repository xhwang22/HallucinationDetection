McClendon is an extremely valuable coach who players seem to love, and decision-makers seem to respect, made clear by him being offered the interim tag. Fans would obviously like to keep him around.\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn\u2019t look like that will be the case, with some recent leaks online signaling that B-Mac might be taking off for Miami as soon as the season is over to join Cristobal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t how much is out there is actually true, to be honest with you,\u201d McClendon said Monday after Oregon\u2019s practice. \u201cThe frustrating thing about it and disappointing thing about it is regardless of how some stuff came up, which I still don\u2019t know how that happened until this point, I think everything did get rectified in that sense. The thing that\u2019s frustrating though is I haven\u2019t even thought about it as much as some of the other people have.

On Monday, McClendon stated again that he has yet to even think about where his next destination should be if it is outside of Oregon, and that he wants to keep his focus on the players, who deserve it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not right for those guys for my focus to be other places. So I haven\u2019t done it,\u201d McClendon said. \u201cIt\u2019s not right, quite honestly, for my family to try to make a family decision while my focus is on the guys right now. I feel like anything that\u2019s out there right now, it did not come from me and I would \u2014 not to sit up here and say one way or another, but it did not come from me. However all that stuff came out there, I think it got rectified and I do look forward to being able to make those decisions. I just feel like it\u2019ll be a hard decision to make right now while my focus is solely on these guys and making sure that these guys have a positive influence. I don\u2019t want to cheat them. I don\u2019t want to make a bad decision for my family because my focus is so much on these guys right now.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s extremely possible, and probable, that we find out more about McClendon\u2019s future over the next few days or weeks as Oregon\u2019s appearance in the Alamo Bowl comes and goes. If you were inclined to bet, I could give you a good idea of where to put your money. For now, though, B-Mac is keeping his focus on the players wearing green and yellow.

Under McClendon\u2019s direction, Deebo Samuel earned All-SEC honors with 62 catches for 882 yards and 11 touchdowns while Bryan Edwards and Shi Smith also combined for 100 receptions, 1,519 yards and 11 touchdowns. McClendon then went to Oregon for two seasons as the wide receivers coach and passing game coordinator, also serving as the interim head coach when Cristobal made the move to Miami.\n\nMcClendon will be tasked with replacing quite a bit of lost talent and production in the wide receiver room this coming season. Aside from the departure of former position coach Cortez Hankton, Georgia saw George Pickens leave for the NFL Draft and Jermaine Burton, as well as Justin Robinson and Jaylen Johnson, enter the transfer portal.
