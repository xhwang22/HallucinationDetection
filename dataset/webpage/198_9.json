Tisci was also quick to align himself with celebrities of an ilk that many at the time wouldn\u2019t dream of associating with, creating moments that would guarantee his place in the firmament of fashion and culture.\n\nAnd while his high-profile collaborations \u2013 Nike, Beyonc\u00e9, Madonna, Kanye West and Jay Z \u2013 garnered the Italian designer a great deal of popular acclaim, his many endeavours into other, more quiet creative realms suggested Tisci was interested in much more than high wattage moments.\n\nBelow, revisit five of Riccardo Tisci\u2019s most memorable artistic collaborations over the course of his time at Givenchy.\n\nMarina Abramovic\n\nOn occasion of his tenth year at Givenchy in 2015, Tisci decamped to New York\u2019s Pier 26 to present his women\u2019s spring/summer 2016 collection on the anniversary of 9/11 in the shadow of the Freedom Tower.\n\nTisci\u2019s black-and-white show was art directed by the controversial performance artist Marina Abramovic, who stationed silent performers throughout the show, which for the first time was also open to the public. Their austere performances and Tisci\u2019s universally praised collection of couture-worthy looks proved to be a fitting tribute to the city and an industry that had so warmly embraced him over the course of the last decade.\n\nTisci and Abramobic\u2019s relationship was also the focus of a great deal many more memorable moments during his time at Givenchy. The designer enlisted the artist to feature in his guest-edited \u2018Religion\u2019 edition of Visionaire in 2011, which featured a Piet\u00e0 style image of Ambramovic and Tisci \u2013 the designer posing as if breastfeeding from the artist.\n\nIn a much more subdued image, Abramovic also starred in the brand\u2019s Spring/Summer 2013 advertising campaign, shot by Tisci\u2019s good friends, Mert & Marcus.\n\n\n\nPerformers overlook the runway at the Givenchy Spring Summer 2016 fashion show during New York Fashion Week on September 11, 2015\n\nCredit: Catwalking/Getty Images\n\nKehinde Wiley\n\nFor An Economy of Grace, Kehinde Wiley\u2019s first body of work dedicated to all female subjects, the artist asked Tisci to create custom-made couture gowns for each of his street cast models.\n\nPosed in a manner that replicated the historical portraits of society women seen by the artist at the Louvre by artists like Jacques-Louis David, Thomas Gainsborough and John Singer Sargent, among others, the women ranged from Rikers Island prison guards to teen mothers. It was the artist\u2019s intention to create \u201ca rightful place for them within art history, which has to date been an almost exclusively white domain.\u201d\n\n\n\nA work from Kehinde Wiley\u2019s An Economy of Grace, The Two Sisters, 2012, oil on linen, 96\u2033 x 72\u2033\n\nCredit: Courtesy of the artist\n\nBenjamin Shine\n\nIn 2013, Tisci created a line of sweatshirts with the British-born, Canberra-based artist Benjamin Shine, featuring the kind of Madonna-and-Child iconography informed by Tisci\u2019s strict Catholic upbringing that the designer so heavily drew on for his collections \u2013 only this time rendered in the artist\u2019s signature tulle formations.\n\nThe following year, Tisci created the first instalment of what would become an ongoing and extremely popular collaboration with Nike, drawing on another reliable component of his design oeuvre \u2013 think Fall 2013\u2019s now iconic Bambi sweatshirts and the seasonal variations that have followed.\n\nShine\u2019s collaboration with Tisci also paved the way for his incredible collaboration with John Galliano and Maison Margiela\u2019s most recent Artisanal collection.\n\n\n\nCredit: Courtesy of the artist/Givenchy\n\nPaul Veroude\n\nRumours of Tisci\u2019s departure from Givenchy have been percolating for years. It was at the time that he showed his Spring 2015 Menswear collection that they reached a fever pitch, the intimation being that he was Gucci-bound (Frida Giannini presented what would be her final menswear collection for Gucci the week prior).\n\nIt was in Paris that week, however, that Tisci would issue something of a statement to the contrary.\n\nIn a vast hanger, Tisci\u2019s models circled a deconstructed Cessna that had been \u201cexploded\u201d by the Dutch artist Paul Veroude, whose work celebrates the power of machinery through the process of deconstruction. The almost anatomical, worshipful diagram was also something of a cipher for Tisci\u2019s pious sartorial precision and devotion to his craft.\n\n\n\nAt the Spring 2015 Givenchy menswear show, Dutch sculptor Paul Veroude deconstructed a Cessna for an installation commissioned by the house\n\nCredit: Michel Dufour/Wireimage\n\nM/M Paris\n\nA more surreptitious, though nonetheless significant, collaboration has been the one Tisci has enjoyed with M/M Paris, the creative consultancy helmed by Michael Amzalag and Mathias Augustyniak.\n\nThe acclaimed design duo designed all of Tisci\u2019s show invitations for the house for the duration of his tenure at Givenchy and in 2013, in occasion of their 20th anniversary, Amzalag and Augustyniak released The Givenchy Files to celebrate their ongoing collaboration: a hardback, limited edition tome amassing their always memorable designs for the Parisian house.\n\n\n\n\u201cCelebration\u201d: M/M Paris\u2019s invitation for Riccardo Tisci\u2019s 10th anniversary show, featuring a likeness of Tisci\u2019s chief muse, Italian supermodel Mariacarla Boscono\n\nCredit: M/M Paris/Instagram\n\nTile image: Catwalking/Getty Images\n\nCover image: Courtesy of Benjamin Shine/Givenchy"}, {"url": "https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/riccardo-tisci-life-in-looks", "page_content": "After bowing out of his creative directorship at Burberry with a goth-at-the-beach spring/summer 2023 show and Shakira-fronted Christmas campaign, Riccardo Tisci is taking a break. But don\u2019t think he\u2019s forgotten about the industry completely. Already, the designer has fashioned his first solo work in 17 years for friend Michaela Coel and now, he\u2019s sifted through his vast archive to compile his Life in Looks for British Vogue. For a man who has collaborated with Madonna, Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna, and calls Naomi Campbell and Mariacarla Boscono muses and sisters, this is no mean feat. It was also, says Tisci, highly emotional.\n\nWhile there have been obvious professional highs \u2013 including the first Riccardo Tisci show, which saw friends Karen Elson and Liya Kebede model his anti-polished, pro-gothic looks for free, and Givenchy\u2019s anniversary show during which the rain clouds parted and a glorious sunset backdropped his darkly sensual work \u2013 many of the Italian\u2019s creatives wins are deeply personal. He accepted that coveted Givenchy contract in 2005, for example, not because of the prestige, but because of the pay cheque that would enable him to save his mother from selling the family home to make ends meet.\n\nTisci\u2019s collaboration with Nike, back when it was unheard of for a couturier to elevate sportswear into high fashion, was also rooted in a childhood where a simple pair of trainers acted as a great leveller and allowed him to fit in. And so, years down the line, when industry outsider Kim Kardashian was not considered in vogue, it was Tisci who stepped forward to dress the then-heavily pregnant reality TV star for the 2013 Met Gala \u2013 an event she was only allowed to attend as the plus one of Kanye West. The blossoming rose gown he made was symbolic of the woman he saw: a strong individual expressing one of the most powerful acts of femininity.\n\nIt is unsurprising, then, that before Tisci\u2019s next move (a new vacancy at Gucci has just become available), he is taking stock of his core values: making his new house in London a home, spending time with the eight sisters who shaped him and, he reveals, \u201ctrying to have a child\u201d. Rather than jumping into the next project, \u201csimplicity\u201d is the biggest trend in Tisci\u2019s life right now \u2013 and it looks good.

West told Martinez about a time when he asked Nike when the Air Yeezy 2 Red Octobers were set to release. When they replied, \u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d he took it as a sign that he was being cut out of the brand\u2019s braintrust and, above all, completely undervalued as a creative entity. On the Breakfast Club radio show in November 2013, he said, incredulously, that Nike had not asked him to design new products in almost three years despite the success of the Yeezys. In West\u2019s view, Nike had grown weary of his accomplishments, fearing that by giving him a broader design deal, they would be opening the door for his products to eventually compete with, or even overshadow, Nike\u2019s main line designs. As West said in a separate radio interview with Hot 97, \u201cAs soon as [the Yeezy] was too big, it\u2019s scary. Nike is, like, \u2018No. We\u2019re not going to let you blow to [that] level. We already have Jordan Brand, we already have that one baby. And we don\u2019t even like that we have to compete with brand Jordan.\u201d\n\nTo further expand his point, West then went on Power 99 radio in Philadelphia and described how big name fashion brands don\u2019t respect the influence people like him\u2014specifically, black rappers\u2014have on consumers. \u201c[They\u2019re], like, \u2018All you can do is promote our products\u2026all we want to do is keep serving y\u2019all with these Louis Vuitton prints until none of your bills are paid.\u201d He then went on to describe his issue with the way that \u201cgood design\u201d seems to only be available to those with money. \u201cI had a conversation [with Alexander Wang],\u201d West told the station, \u201cjust from a philanthropist perspective, as an influencer of clothing. I bought the $1,000 dollar Balenciaga sneakers because I thought it had a nice shape. Now there\u2019s kids saving up their check for four weeks because it does have a nice shape, and they also saw me wear it. But these kids don\u2019t need to be buying no $1,000 sneakers, and the shape that is good doesn\u2019t have to be $1000.\u201d Ultimately, it seems his need for corporate structure stems further than just job security, but as a way to keep costs down and get his designs onto as many people as possible by designing clothes that are available at a democratic price."}, {"url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/riccardo-tisci-a-beyonce-and-kim-kardashian-favorite-leaves-givenchy", "page_content": "Riccardo Tisci will exit the house of Givenchy after serving nearly 12 years as its chief designer. The longest-serving creative director aside from Hubert de Givenchy himself, Tisci helped push the French house to a cultural relevance it had not seen in years. With a flair for adding gothic touches and a speed dial that seemed to include everyone from Kim Kardashian and Beyonc\u00e9 to Marina Abramovi\u0107 and Pedro Almodovar, Tisci\u2019s influence, both at the legacy French house and on his own, is felt throughout culture.\n\nIn a statement on Instagram attached to a picture of a sun setting, Tisci wished a public farewell to his Givenchy staff.\n\n\u201cA giant heartfelt thank you to #givenchy, #lvmh, my incredible team, the magical atelier and everyone who made these 93 collections possible and all the other crazy adventures,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYour love and support, in the day and in the night, will forever remain in my heart.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter he was blunter, simply writing, \u201cThat\u2019s all, Folks!\u201d\n\nThe news comes just a short time after the Italian-born designer showed both the label\u2019s Fall 2017 men\u2019s collection and Fall 2017 couture. WWD reports that his split from the company was effective as of January 31st, after his most recent contract expired. Givenchy\u2019s parent company LVMH, which also owns Louis Vuitton and Dior, will have its in-house studio design the fall collection to show retailers in lieu of a runway show on March 5 during the upcoming Paris Fashion Week, though custom dresses Tisci was working on for celebrity clients for both the Grammy and Academy Awards red carpets will still be completed. Fittingly, Givenchy became a red carpet favorite under Tisci\u2019s tenure.\n\nTisci\u2019s exit comes amid growing speculation that he may take over the reigns at Versace. Tisci, who is from Southern Italy, is good friends with Donatella Versace, and even took the unusual step of casting the competing designer in Givenchy\u2019s own ad campaign back in 2015. And just eight weeks ago, Tisci posted a picture of Gianni Versace on Instagram to commemorate the late designer\u2019s birthday and hashtagged the photo with \u201c#idol\u201d and \u201c#master.\u201d\n\nFor the moment, however, indications of his future plans remain just that\u2014speculation.\n\nTisci had brought stability to a couture house the had come to be known as something of a springboard after the 1995 retirement of Monsieur de Givenchy. John Galliano briefly held the position of creative director for two years after Givenchy\u2019s retirement, but the English designer was quickly reassigned to fellow LVMH brand Dior and Alexander McQueen, who replaced Galliano, didn\u2019t stay long either and found greater success with his namesake label. Julien MacDonald helmed the house in the early \u201900s, but his time is mostly forgotten. Tisci was named creative director of couture and the women\u2019s line in 2005, and soon took over duties as the menswear designer in 2007.\n\nHe had a gift for putting high fashion in touch with popular culture without necessarily cheapening the brand. He designed Kardashian\u2019s wedding gown for her marriage to Kanye West, for instance. Givenchy T-shirts bearing images of an angry rottweilers and Disney\u2019s Bambi became streetwear sensations. He also designed tour costumes for Beyonc\u00e9, Rihanna and Madonna.\n\nTisci had a direct line several artistic and underground figures as well, like Abramovic and the musician Anohni, for whom he art directed a Naomi Campbell-starring music video called \u201cDrone Bomb Me. Tisci was also an early champion of transgender models on the runway\u2014Lea T, a transgender model, is a close friend and frequent muse and model for the house.\n\nWith Tisci\u2019s flair for capturing the interest of high culture, pop culture and underground culture, it only seemed natural that the designer would one day be destined for bigger things. Only time will tell where he goes next, though it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll have to wait long for more clarification.\n\nEvery Time Beyonc\u00e9 Slayed in Givenchy Beyonc\u00e9 in Givenchy at the 2015 Met Ball.

Impressively, the designer crafted distinct brand identities for all of Givenchy\u2019s product categories across women\u2019s and men\u2019s ready-to-wear and haute couture lines. At Burberry, he lifted sales after faltering period, and revamping the company's brand identity.\n\nTisci grew up in a tight-knit, single-parent, working-class family in Italy. The designer describes his family life as hugely influential on him and remembers his childhood as one filled with love. Tisci left regular school aged 11 to enroll in art school in Milan. \u201cI wanted to express myself and I couldn't really do it through words at that point,\" he told The Daily Telegraph. The designer was selected for a scholarship by Central Saint Martins, from which he graduated in 1999. He then held design positions at Puma, Antonio Berardi and with Ruffo Research, before embarking on his own brand in 2004. As a result of his bold, powerfully-feminine designs, Tisci was announced as the creative director of Givenchy\u2019s womenswear and haute couture lines in 2005. After announcing his amicable departure from the house in February 2017 with a subsequent sabbatical, Tisci was named chief creative officer at Burberry in March 2018, succeeding Christopher Bailey .\n\nTisci\u2019s creations found willing consumers immediately; the designer\u2019s vision for Givenchy initially found traction with consumers rather than editors. In just two years Tisci had revitalised the house\u2019s couture business. He chose to stop showing couture in 2012, taking the business behind the scenes in-house once more.\n\nIn May 2008 he was appointed chief designer of menswear and menswear accessories in addition to his womenswear role. His menswear collections have received rampant critical acclaim and caused the formation of tribe-like followers, many of whom, such as Kanye West, are very much in the public eye. Tisci\u2019s marriage of streetwear influences, Parisian sensibilities and global motifs made Givenchy\u2019s printed sweatshirts a fashion staple, as well as broadening the brand\u2019s appeal exponentially.\n\nFollowing over a decade of experience at the creative helm of Givenchy, Tisci transitioned to Burberry, an announcement that sent share prices soaring by over 5 percent. Joining Marco Gobetti a second time, who also joined Burberry as its chief executive following a stint at Givenchy, Tisci took on plans to reinvigorate product and consumer experiences and expand Burberry's first venture into high end streetwear after a partnership with Gosha Rubchinsky in 2018. Under Tisci's watch, both Burberry's London flagship location and it's monogram logo underwent a revamp, the latter of which debuted with a series of international pop-up installations featuring the new Peter Saville -designed Burberry logo. Following the highly anticipated first Spring/Summer 2019 collection and logo redesign, Burberry reported a 4 percent rise in first quarter comparable store sales in 2019."}, {"url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/givenchys-riccardo-tisci-why-he-782524/#!", "page_content": "This story first appeared in the March 27 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.\n\nA smartly dressed sea of Parisians are gathered in an apartment replete with gilt moldings and white flowers on historic Rue de Presbourg.

He created Madonna\u2018s two Grammy looks, not to mention her 2012 Super Bowl looks. Among his most conspicuous achievements is having made Kardashian\u2019s gown and West\u2019s tux for their 2014 wedding, which he attended.

He had practically no reputation; expectations weren\u2019t high. Being shrewd, he knew how to handle that. \u201cI didn\u2019t do any interviews at the beginning,\u201d he says. \u201cI really wanted people to forget Givenchy a little bit \u2014 and to gain back the respect. The first big emotional moment for me was Nicole Kidman in a black dress in 2007. Then Naomi Watts chose a striped dress \u2014 another moment! We did a Mermaid collection in 2007 couture, and there were three dresses my team didn\u2019t love. But I was obsessed with one of those black dresses. Then Cate Blanchett wears it in Berlin! I was shocked. Even my mother was shocked!\u201d\n\nPike in her 2015 Oscars dress, which Tisci coaxed her to wear.\n\nThe relationship with Blanchett grew to include Oscar and SAG Awards gowns. \u201cMy favorite Oscar look of all time is the lavender gown on Cate in 2011,\u201d says Blanchett\u2019s stylist, Elizabeth Stewart (who also works with Chastain and Seyfried). \u201cRiccardo holds a very special place in my heart. When he shot Amanda Seyfried for his campaign a few years back, the look was pure him and pure her \u2014 that takes talent.\u201d\n\nRead more Riccardo Tisci Opens Men\u2019s Givenchy Store in Paris\n\nA week after his Blanchett moment, \u201cI get a call from Madonna,\u201d recalls Tisci. It turned out to be the beginning of a beautiful friendship: \u201cIn magazines I\u2019d seen her wearing a few of our pieces. Then I did the Latin collection in 2008, and Madonna\u2019s stylist Arianne Phillips wanted a dress for a video. A few days after, I get a call from Madonna herself to meet me in New York. Can you imagine? The ultimate icon.\u201d At the meeting, the pop star diffused Tisci\u2019s nerves with \u201ca joke that made me turn red! Now we are friends. I know what she likes. I know what she wants to show of her body \u2014 like all women.\u201d\n\nOne of Tisci\u2019s unique talents is knowing how to flatter a shape and make a woman look like a bombshell \u2014 albeit a sophisticated one. \u201cSome women are very aware of the best of their bodies,\u201d he says. \u201cSome are not. Me, I\u2019m very honest. We work with some princesses, and I say, \u2018Baby, that\u2019s not right.\u2019 I won\u2019t argue, but I will be upfront. It\u2019s my job to tell them what looks best. Cate, Madonna or Jessica, when you start knowing them and their bodies well after years, it\u2019s easy. With Rosamund [Pike at the Oscars], she listened to me a bit more because she has a fear of fashion, and I wanted for her a big fashion moment. I said, \u2018For me, this is what you should do.\u2019 She was afraid of the red; she almost didn\u2019t wear it. But she went for it \u2014 it was a moment!\u201d\n\nFor the 2013 Met Gala, Tisci dressed Mara, who says, \u201cRiccardo combines two of my favorite things: romance with a bit of edge. His dresses feel of-the-moment or even of-the-future \u2014 a little bit gothic, a little bit punk, always unique.\u201d\n\nOscar nominee Pike confirms the story: \u201cRiccardo has a fire in his belly! There\u2019s an enfant terrible inside of him. He wanted the dress to have a corset and a big split up the front, which was really bold. I felt very vulnerable about an Oscar dress \u2014 you can be eaten alive! Then I realized, in the end, it made me feel relaxed, free and even safe.\u201d\n\nSee more Paris Fashion Week\u2019s Front Row\n\nAmong designers who often work with Hollywood \u2014 Dior, Lanvin, Valentino, Chanel, Michael Kors \u2014 Tisci truly is friends with what he calls his \u201ctribe\u201d: Chastain, Madonna, Rooney Mara (who wore Givenchy throughout the 2012 awards season), Kim and Kanye, Seyfried and Moore. Italian family obsession drives him to such intimacy: He has eight sisters and is close to his mother, who sits front row at every show. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s not so much the girls of the moment,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes we make clothes for an actress with no projects out, possibly not even famous yet. I don\u2019t use stars to sell clothes \u2014 I dress my friends. People talk about the movie business, the fashion business. It\u2019s about people for me.\u201d What traits does his \u201ctribe\u201d share? \u201cIntelligence first. Beauty is great, but not when you have nothing to say. They are confident. They have talent.\u201d Significantly, in an age of red-carpet appearance fees, Instagram endorsements and brand ambassadors, Givenchy never has paid a star to wear the brand. \u201cI find that very sad, very cynical,\u201d says Tisci. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be about money; it should be about beauty, passion and family.\u201d\n\nMoore, one of Tisci\u2019s \u201ctribe,\u201d in Givenchy haute couture at the 2015 SAG Awards.\n\nHaving graduated from London design school Central Saint Martins (where John Galliano and Alexander McQueen also went before stints at Givenchy), Tisci was ready for Paris couture with his first Givenchy show in July 2005 (couture only being done during the past decade by the likes of Chanel, Valentino, Dior, Armani and Elie Saab). Despite several highly successful seasons, he suspended couture shows in 2012: \u201cAll these women working on one dress \u2014 it can take 300 hours to make a top! And people saw it from a runway and couldn\u2019t see the workmanship. So I do couture for Hollywood and real life. When actresses wear these dresses at major events, the world is watching. The way we do couture now is personal \u2014 it\u2019s modern.\u201d Says Moore, who sported couture during the recent awards season: \u201cRiccardo is always present for fittings for major events \u2014 I love it. He\u2019s so precise about fit and proportion. When he designed my Golden Globes dress, he submitted 40 sketches. Leslie [Fremar, Moore\u2019s stylist] and I were blown away! We winnowed to three, and I wore two. Both were spectacular.\u201d Adds Fremar: \u201cComing from Vogue, I know that in some fashion circles Hollywood is secondary. Some designers still have a hard time embracing the red carpet. Riccardo loves it! He\u2019s so passionate. When we asked for an awards-season dress, he sent a book! Not everyone can interpret a body into a shape. His dresses fit like a glove: amazing on paper, better in person.\u201d\n\nRead more Kim Kardashian Wears Givenchy to Her Wedding (Photo)\n\nFremar is among a lucky few. \u201cWe do say no a lot,\u201d says Tisci of the many requests from actresses and stylists, \u201cand I\u2019m very upfront about it. Not rude. I say: \u2018I don\u2019t think we are right for you, and you are probably not right for us. Why should we waste time?\u2019 \u201d With no hesitation, he mentions his favorite stylists: Fremar, Stewart and Phillips. \u201cI work with people who know what they want,\u201d says Tisci. \u201cIt can be the person who completes the relationship between you and the actress: A third opinion can be very important. But I\u2019ve been in a situation where I had to tell the stylist to shut up.\u201d\n\nStewart has put Roberts in a number of Givenchy looks \u2014 a jumpsuit at the recent SAG Awards, a lace peplum gown at the 2014 Oscars \u2014 so it wasn\u2019t a huge surprise when Tisci reached out for the actress to star in his spring 2015 ad campaign. But it was shocking when the somewhat anti-style Oscar winner, who never had done a fashion campaign, said yes. The black-and-white result of Roberts in a brilliantly cut suit (for which she reportedly was paid less than $1 million, compared with Jennifer Lawrence\u2018s $15 million Dior campaign) \u201cwas a big success because she let herself go, with very little hair and makeup,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a new way of seeing Julia.\u201d\n\nGivenchy and Audrey Hepburn at a 1958 fitting.\n\nThen there\u2019s Kardashian. It was Tisci who made her a person of fashion interest. \u201cKanye is a friend for seven years,\u201d he explains, \u201cso when he called me up and said, \u2018I\u2019m dating a girl; I want you to meet her,\u2019 I jumped. She\u2019s intelligent, sweet, beautiful. She\u2019s the girlfriend of my friend. I\u2019m not into judgment. She started coming to my shows, and some people criticized me. But I love Kanye and now I love Kim, and I didn\u2019t care what people thought.\u201d Tisci invited Kardashian to the 2013 Met Ball, which he co-hosted. \u201cI needed to have my gang with me, and Anna [Wintour] understood. Not everyone was positive about it \u2014 fine. I say, \u2018It\u2019s your problem if you have a problem with Kim coming.\u2019 Then, after two years, I was proud when she received the cover of American Vogue. Four or five years ago, no fashion house would touch her. But Kim represents the woman of today \u2014 she defines society today.\u201d\n\nRead more Fashion Month: 10 Doppelgangers on the Runways\n\nTisci himself has been a subject of speculation, for being offered the stewardship of Dior before Raf Simons took the job; Gucci, even before Frida Giannini resigned; and Chanel, as Karl Lagerfeld\u2018s possible heir. \u201cI know,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cI think it\u2019s a compliment. I don\u2019t call myself a genius; I just want to do my job properly. I literally saved this house of Givenchy out of pure love,\u201d he declares, showing major confidence, for he believes in nothing so much as his design talent \u2014 a faith validated by wildly enthusiastic reviews (often commenting on his goth sensibilities, which Tisci deems \u201cdark romance\u201d) and sales. Most of his fall 2015 collection sold out before it hit a store floor.\n\nAudrey Hepburn donned Givenchy in 1954\u2019s \u2018Sabrina.\u2019\n\nIn contrast to his bold collections, Tisci constantly describes himself as \u201cshy.\u201d But his personal Instagram posts \u2014 his 40th birthday in Ibiza, vacations in St. Tropez \u2014 have won him many fashion fans, and the Givenchy brand\u2019s feed has 1.8 million followers. \u201cWhen I was a teenager \u2014 I grew up quite poor [in Como, Italy] \u2014 I cut out pictures to make fashion scrapbooks. Now Instagram is my scrapbook. If it gives kids hope that they can live their dreams, then it\u2019s positive.\u201d\n\nTisci\u2019s fall 2015 show was set in a high school gym, with models in Victorian-style velvet devore dresses, black architectural suits and chola-style braids (courtesy of makeup artist Pat McGrath) walking among old TVs, motorcycle helmets and video games. \u201cI wanted to do \u2018chola Victorian,\u2019 \u201d says Tisci. \u201cI wasn\u2019t worried because I knew the clothes were strong.\u201d Not unlike their creator. \u201cWhat I\u2019m most proud of,\u201d he says, \u201cis two things: couture and business. I\u2019ve got a gift from God that is very rare \u2014 the clothes are wearable. I can do couture, and I can do street. I come from the street. I\u2019m probably lucky I come from such a poor family. Perhaps that is a gift, too.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/fashion-runway-givenchy-clare-waight-keller-beyonce-kim-kardashian-west", "page_content": "\n\n\n\n1 / 5 Chevron Chevron Photo: Getty Images Solange Knowles\n\nChanges are afoot at Givenchy as former Chlo\u00e9 designer Clare Waight Keller readies herself to step into the role of artistic director at the LVMH-owned house on May 2. She replaces Riccardo Tisci who served a 12-year stint at the label, turning it into a successful brand beloved by both high-wattage stars and the fashion obsessives who follow their every move.\n\nDuring his tenure at Givenchy, Tisci was one of the first designers to put his stamp on luxury streetwear, creating T-shirts with Bambi cartoons and Rottweilers that became style totems for the Instagram generation. The designer brilliantly balanced edgy, skater-kid-inspired ready-to-wear with entrancing and dramatic couture gowns that he designed for the ultra-famous women in his inner circle. Tisci counts Beyonc\u00e9 and Kim Kardashian West among his most loyal fans; in fact he was one of the first big designers to dress Mrs. Yeezy when others were still unsure of her sartorial bonafides. Tisci has also walked the Met Gala red carpet with a bare bottom Madonna and partied it up on more than one occasion with Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner."}]}
