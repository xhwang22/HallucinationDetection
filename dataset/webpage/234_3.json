Think of the policy shop as the \u201cbig picture\u201d unit inside an agency whose larger mission \u2014 move stuff around \u2014 hasn't changed. But Vision Zero? Dedicated bus lanes? Battling community boards? Bike lanes? Citi Bike expansion? Automated vehicle testing? Climate change strategies? Replogle has seen it all (even if you haven't seen him). On Friday, Replogle marked his last day on the job (he's leaving for personal reasons that you don't need to know about), but we expect to see him again, perhaps at the next mayor's DOT. In any event, he chatted with Streetsblog's Gersh Kuntzman about the challenges of inter-agency work, the importance of strong leadership, his concerns about the future of automated vehicles, and more. What follows is a lightly edited transcript.\n\nGersh Kuntzman: Let's start with the idea of leadership. If you look at the mayoral race, it's amazing how seven or eight years ago there was one guy, Bill de Blasio, who talked about issues like the Green New Deal, or the desire to have more cycling, or better bus lanes, etc, and now everybody is talking about these issues. But there\u2019s a large problem in our city right now: when I talk to people about these issues, everybody\u2019s behind them. But then you talk about how it could get done, like for example, \u201cHey on Hylan Boulevard, we want to remove 300 parking spaces to make a dedicated bus lane,\" people freak out. Or on 34th Avenue in Jackson Heights, where DOT has created the open street that worldwide could be acknowledged as a leading effort during Covid, you now hear pushback against the idea of a permanent open street because of the notion that maybe people would have to give up parking. Could you speak about the challenge you faced in that arena, and give any advice about what needs to be done in the next administration?\n\nMichael Replogle\n\nMichael Replogle: I think its heartening that all of the candidates for mayor are basically saying that they want to do most of these things that the de Blasio administration did to advance the sustainable transportation, and they want to do those things more, faster, and with greater intensity. And no doubt that will present leadership challenges for whoever takes that post \u2014 the city is constantly hampered by the governing structures that we\u2019re caught in. The state controls a lot of what the city can do, so we end up having to make second-best choices in many cases because of politics, or because we don\u2019t have the authority under the city charter, or we have to get permission from Albany to do something.\n\nSo finding ways of establishing a better relationship between the mayor and the governor, and between the city and the state, certainly could help facilitate more timely progress on a lot of these things. I think the next mayor and members of the council will have to face the challenge of how to build coalitions that can be supportive in these areas that can be deeply controversial, like loss of parking. Despite these challenges, I think we\u2019ve got some really outstanding models that we\u2019ve developed through our response to COVID, which will give whoever is next in office some really good material to work from, and successes to point to, which will I think make it easier to have faster progress.\n\nKuntzman: As that guy once said, \"Never let a crisis go to waste.\" You talked about those second-best choices you needed to make in some cases, but DOT has so much power to establish dedicated bus lanes, busways for example, which was so successful on 14th street and so successful elsewhere...\n\nReplogle: Yes!\n\nKuntzman: ... but so controversial! So this barrier you speak of is interesting: you mentioned that state partners don\u2019t always make things easy, and also on the community board level, but really you guys have so much latitude anyway. Do you feel frustrated that even more wasn\u2019t done? That a busway on 14th Street didn\u2019t automatically lead to five of those in every borough? On some level, you've got to be frustrated that you can\u2019t do what you probably consider the easier jobs.\n\nReplogle: I certainly aspire to see more accomplished than we were able to accomplish during this term, but that said we have had very strong leadership at this agency, from Janette Sadik Khan, to Polly Trottenberg, to Margret Forgione, to Hank Gutman [current DOT commissioner]. Each of them has brought a different leadership style to the agency, and I found it easy to work with each of them, to try and advance things. Often the challenges lay in that triangulation: We do what an agency can do day to day, but City Hall needs to take into account other factors such as \"What can we get NYPD to do\" and \"How do we deal with the state Assembly member or state Senator who wants to weigh in on these issues?\" There are a lot of issues in play, and often issues tangential to transportation become impediments to our making progress in transportation; good progress gets held hostage to other issues.\n\nKuntzman: What do you mean?\n\nReplogle: Well, it took us four years to get through the state legislature for the reauthorization of speed cameras and to expand the time in which they could be used and the locations, and even now that fight continues. That got hung up on issues around standards for yeshivas \u2014 something that really didn\u2019t have much to do with transportation. I think that\u2019s where city hall gets caught in a box. I sense the frustration that you feel from your angle on this, but our agency is doing the best it can with the resources we\u2019ve got.\n\nNew York City does not have massive pedestrian places like the K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe is Stuttgart.\n\nKuntzman: (laughs) \"The best it can do\" depends on your perspective. The perspective of someone in your Bridges division would be very different from the perspective of someone in your biking division, I would imagine, or the public space division.\n\nLet's stay on the topic of different levels of success within DOT divisions. One of the issues we talk a lot about that you've worked on is the open streets and open restaurants program, which was really so successful. It was a quick build, which needed to be done at that time, but there are longer-term issues with creating permanent truly safe public spaces, pedestrian plazas for example. I know you guys create those spaces, but not on a massive scale in terms of what some of our readers call for. Many people complain, \"Why isn\u2019t X avenue a car-free plaza from what street to whatever street?\" I know you guys have to ram projects through community boards, and you\u2019ve got to get the mayor on board with that, but at the end of the day, NYC doesn't have these permanent pedestrianized places like other cities do. Talk to me a little about the frustration there. Like I said the Bridges division can look at the \"level of service\" of your roadways and say, \"Hey, our level of service is awesome,\" but your bike division can look at the level of service and say, \"Well, its not as awesome as it should be.\" Are these different levels of success within DOT frustrating?\n\nReplogle: As you would expect within an agency this large, there is healthy tension between different parts of the agency over a lot of these things and for me its been satisfying to sit in the policy shop of the commissioner's office trying to help divisions break out of their silos, and to talk to each other more effectively, and where things have been stuck try to unstick them. The policy unit that I\u2019ve headed is basically a sort of think-do tank within the agency, and we\u2019ve done a number of pilot projects in different areas \u2014 car sharing, bike sharing, scooter sharing, and the like. We\u2019re now about to launch electric vehicle charging, and those pilots have all generally proven themselves to be pretty successful, and gone on to be made permanent.\n\nThe pace of change has been frustrating to me. We are often encumbered by our procurement rules. I wish honestly that several years ago we might have started a process to take a franchise, to develop multiple bicycle parking units around the street like Oonee was trying to do, but our procurement rules, and our plaza rules, under the city charter, prevent us from rolling that out unless we go through a franchise process, which is about a three-year process and requires city council approval. This is common in our work: things that on the surface look like they ought to be simple and nimble and quick often take longer.\n\nMichael Replogle, far right, with (from right), then-DOT Commissioner Polly Trottenberg, UN Habitat Executive Director Maimunah Mohd Sharif and Sierra Club President Ram\u00f3n Cruz.\n\nI think that the open restaurants program is a good example of things being much harder than they should be. Some of our own rules and regulations have been put into place in response to political pressure to make sure community boards have a strong voice in whether a restaurant would have sidewalk seating, tables, and to make sure we went through a detailed and fairly expensive process to design and engineer those treatments on a runoff basis. During COVID, those rules were getting in the way of saving the restaurant industry, so we found a way during the crisis to identify the need for a nimble scaling of an open restaurant program, we had 6,000 open restaurants three weeks after we first put that idea together, and I think that's a lesson that we should take and apply to more places.\n\nKuntzman: That\u2019s the kind of thing that I\u2019m talking about. We\u2019re going to move out of a crisis and a lot of the people are going to come back to community boards and say, \"I was never consulted!\" and \"Yyou gotta undo all the great stuff that you did,\" which most of us think would be absurd because it was so successful.\n\nReplogle: We saw this around the pedestrianization of Broadway a few years ago, which was a very successful and popular program. At one point there were suggestions in City Hall that we should take back some of the pedestrianization of Broadway, there was a public outcry saying, \"No, we actually like this quite a lot,\" and I think it might take some public outcry saying, \"No, we don\u2019t want to see open streets and open restaurants rolled back.\" In fact the de Blasio administration is making those programs permanent, and I think we\u2019re trying to move these things as quickly as possible into being irreconcilable, unrollbackable facts on the ground.\n\nKuntzman: I always come back to all the interviews I did for the council election preview we did earlier this year, where I talked to people who are such strong supporters of climate change initiatives and such strong supporters of the Green New Deal, but then they come back to, \"Oh but there are people in my neighborhood that like to drive.\" Sure, I get that, but at some point, we really do have to reduce the use of the car. The mayor talks a lot about how we need to reduce our reliance on the car almost every time I ask him about it, and DOT can play some role in that.\n\nReplogle: Buses play a role...\n\nKuntzman (rudely interrupting): Yeah, and if a bus ride from Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights to Astoria would take eight minutes because there's a busway, a lot of people wouldn\u2019t drive to Astoria, because obviously it's hard to find parking anyway. On a personal level it has to be very frustrating.\n\nReplogle, posing with then-Transportation Alternatives Executive Director Paul Steely White after a ride.\n\nReplogle: It is when we don\u2019t see leadership, and sometimes it's very gratifying when we do see leadership. There are plenty of times where Mayor de Blasio has, in fact, stood up to community boards who\u2019ve said, \"No we don\u2019t want a vital traffic safety improvement,\" and the mayor said we\u2019re going to do it anyway and backed the transportation commissioner. It\u2019s going to take profiles in leadership in the next administration to build on that record of success, and to make sure that the next mayor is even more successful in moving us towards being the more European style city of sustainable transport that we have the potential to be.\n\nKuntzman: The mayor doesn\u2019t like when I tweak him about what Mayor Hidalgo does in Paris, but she really used that crisis to transform her city for the better.\n\nReplogle: She did. I followed what\u2019s going on in Paris closely, and I think that she\u2019s done some pretty amazing stuff. She\u2019s also working with a city government area that is much more compact. If Paris were reshaped to New York\u2019s geography, it would only cover Manhattan and western Brooklyn/Queens, excluding Staten Island, excluding Eastern Queens, and Northern Bronx. She\u2019s dealing with different politics there than the New York mayor has to deal with.\n\nKuntzman: Staying on parking for a second, Mayor de Blasio has talked about the pay-by-plate system for so many years. I know it got a little delayed because of COVID, but that solution (fixing placard abuse, preventing city employees from parking all over the place, enabling the creation of pickup and drop-off zones that are timed, and people being charged by different times) is like talking about how, when I was a kid, they said we would all be driving flying cars. I feel like it\u2019s 2021 and this kind of technology must have existed for a while now, and it's still not in place. What can we do to make sure the next mayor does this?\n\nReplogle: I think we\u2019re on the cusp of putting it in place here, with the new meters where they\u2019ll put in your license plate number so that the data from your payment session goes into the cloud and we will be at a place where no longer will the traffic enforcement agent go down the street and look for a little piece of paper on the windshield. Then it becomes much easier to create a culture of compliance around our parking and curb regulations. I think that\u2019s an essential predicate to dealing with the whole placard abuse problems, and to restoring more order to the curbs, to reducing double parked trucks, which present a safety problem. So I\u2019m quite optimistic about whole architecture of plate based enforcement that you described. It's one that I have really been like a dog on a bone for the last six years at DOT, helping our staff promote it and move it to reality. The key challenge on implementation would be getting the collaboration of the Police Department on the enforcement side of that. It\u2019s gonna take the leadership of the mayor and the police commissioner to make that happen. That\u2019s above my pay-grade.\n\nKuntzman: Sure, but you\u2019re an observer of politics and policy. I think if there is any agency we\u2019ve examined as critically as the DOT, it\u2019s the NYPD. We\u2019ve found them to be, quite frankly, not a very good Vision Zero partner in terms of what we\u2019ve documented. Do you have any comments on the NYPD as a Vision Zero partner?\n\nReplogle: There have been disappointments for sure, along the way, but I think that the Police Ddepartment has come a long way in the six years that I\u2019ve been here, in terms of getting that paradigm shift. Again, it comes down to leadership. Part of it is culture change, too, within the agency, and culture change happens slowly. Again, it\u2019s a question of leadership and what the expectations are that are set by the mayor, and whoever is a future police commissioner.\n\nKuntzman: You\u2019re a diplomat in the sense that it does come down to leadership, and if I was in your position I would be so frustrated all the time because we have 51 percent of the Police Department that lives in the suburbs, and the vast majority of cops drive to work every day, and have a parking space waiting for them. So even if they're doing their jobs 100 percent right, there\u2019s a culture gap between your biking division, for example, and the NYPD that is not merely bridgeable by appointing a new police commissioner. It\u2019s like you\u2019ve got to change the whole thing, what's that expression, from the root to, um, I'm not a farmer, whatever it is that comes out of the ground. And that\u2019s not something that you could do personally, nor could Hank Gutman do that personally, but it has got to be frustrating.\n\nReplogle: Some of these things are frustrations, to those who are trying to implement more rapid reform. I\u2019ve been working on advancing sustainable transportation for 40 years in a variety of venues from local government to global negotiations and doing a lot of work nationally, and there are no permanent enemies and no permanent allies.\n\nYou have to take each of these opportunities from where you are at the time and be really cold-eyed about what are the barriers today, and how we can bridge some of those places of resistance and opposition. We need to either find a way to work through them, or work around them. For example with this curb management thing, some of that can be facilitated by implementing the 21st-century technologies of curb management, and some of it will also take management command structures of the NYPD being used to say to lowly traffic enforcement agents, \"We need you to do your job.\" That\u2019s something that can be done in the kind of military style of organization that the NYPD is, and hence I have some sense of optimism that within the next administration, this is a problem that can be addressed, and it will make the city a much better place to live in.\n\nKuntzman: As you leave, is there some project that you just wish you had gotten done, that you haven't during your tenure? Or maybe there\u2019s more than one?\n\nReplogle: There is more than one. I would\u2019ve loved to see us build some high capacity bike parking at major transit facilities. As Port Authority Bus Terminal, Penn Station, and other facilities get modernized and rebuilt, the city needs to exert strong leadership to insist that we have to have 5,000 or 10,000 bicycle parking stations in those places so that people can use bikes, leave them overnight, or go from the station to a nearby job or employment, so we can relieve overcrowding in the subway system. We also need better high capacity secure bike parking at some of the outer stations, at the edge of transit deserts in the outer boroughs, because there\u2019s more to be done to provide equitable access for people who don\u2019t have cars or can\u2019t afford cars but often are dependent on them because the transit isn\u2019t as good as it needs to be to get them where they need to go.\n\nI think there are opportunities to expand the use of pedal-assist electric bikes, and e-cargo bikes, and we\u2019re making some really promising progress on that. It has taken longer to get to a place of progress because we had to change the state law to legalize the e-bikes in the first place, but now that we\u2019ve gotten past that, I think we\u2019re seeing some changes there, and hopefully we get some further legislation in the Senate in Albany on legislation of wider e-cargo bikes passed in the next couple of weeks, which will really open up that whole sector.\n\nI think that we could replace 10-15 percent of all trucks in Manhattan within the next several years with pedal assist e-cargo bikes, and it would do wonders for congestion, noise, and air pollution, as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These are opportunities that we\u2019ve demonstrated, and our e-cargo bike program is showing that we get a one-to-one reduction of truck miles for e-cargo bike miles when we substitute, when they\u2019re substituted by the private sector.\n\nKuntzman: Yeah, but more cargo bikes means that we're going to come back to you for wider bike lanes because presumably if you replace a lot of those trucks with cargo bikes, you can repurpose the roads a little bit.\n\nReplogle: We need more bike lanes, wider bike lanes, and more bus priority across the city, without a doubt, and I\u2019m very proud of what we did with 14th Street, and I\u2019m very heartened that we\u2019re going to be developing many more bus rapid transit quarters like that in the future.\n\nHonestly, we should be focusing our bus priority measures most especially on the places where the most bus riders suffer the most congestion and delay, even though those are the hardest places to put these, because they create obviously the greatest potential backlash in terms of other traffic displacement. But those are the places where you get the biggest bang for the buck. And that counts really more than the number of miles of the busway, which everyone tends to fixate on.\n\nKuntzman: Well that\u2019s true. Finally, I\u2019m going to play the Devil\u2019s Advocate: I\u2019m asking on behalf of the people who don\u2019t like what you do. You\u2019ve been in the middle of Vision Zero for a long time, and Vision Zero is a signature initiative of the de Blasio administration, and we at Streetsblog and the street advocacies community have obviously covered very closely the successes of it. But we\u2019re not at zero, which means that we're constantly hearing that inane frustration from car drivers, car owners, car enablers in the council who say, \"Well you\u2019ve just waged this war on cars, and you didn\u2019t even get to zero; in fact you got to about 200 and now its ticking up again, and you\u2019re cutting the speed limits, cutting the places we can drive, and now you want to give more of our space to restaurants, and culture, and pedestrians, and you didn\u2019t even get to zero.\" What\u2019s the best pushback to that attitude that Vision Zero was a failure?\n\nReplogle: Well I think the best pushback is that seven out of the last eight years have been the safest on record in NYC, we\u2019ve cut pedestrian deaths by a third since the pre-Vision Zero era while the rest of the country pedestrian deaths are up by 30 percent or 40 percent. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve seen changes in vehicle design: a lot more utility vehicles and trucks that have higher grills that are more fatal. They hit pedestrians and vulnerable road-users, and since COVID hit, we\u2019re seeing a lot more highly irresponsible aggressive and fast driving, which is deadly. That\u2019s what accounts for most of the rise in vehicle deaths that we\u2019ve seen in the last year.\n\nSo is the answer to stop what has reduced our pedestrian deaths and traffic deaths compared to the rest of the country? No! The answer is to do what we\u2019ve been doing more effectively, like increasing the hours we can operate our speed cameras, putting them in more places, doing more automated enforcement and reducing speed limits where that makes sense, and pressing the federal government to be a better partner, by insisting on safer vehicle design."}, {"url": "https://itdp.academia.edu/MichaelReplogle", "page_content": "This paper reviews typical techniques in use today for estimating the travel behavior effects of ...\n\nmore\n\nThis paper reviews typical techniques in use today for estimating the travel behavior effects of bicycle and pedestrian facilities and programs and other factors that influence use of non-motorized travel modes and offers suggestions for near-term advances in the state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice. The principle approaches that have been used to evaluate the effects of transportation policies and infrastructure on bicycle and pedestrian travel include regression analysis, market-share diversion analysis and discrete choice analysis. In practice, inadequacies of both data and modeling frameworks have led to less than satisfactory performance for all of these methods in the American metropolitan planning context. Problems in evaluating the travel behavior effects of factors influencing walking and bicycling are compounded when conventional emission factor models are used to evaluate some of these strategies. In the past several years, some analysts have worked to develop indicators of bicycle Level of Service, bicycle friendliness, bicycle stress level, bicycle suitability of streets and the like. However, little of this work has been integrated with regional travel demand model development. The author suggests that an immediate priority should be for the demonstration of advanced state-of-the-art travel models with substantially greater inclusion of pedestrian/bicycle travel factors, working in one or more regions where data and agency interest can support rapid and efficient progress. He recommends two specific and inter-related areas of work as immediate high priorities for research, development and demonstration funding: Advanced Regional Models Integrating Non-Motorized Modes and Factors; and Quick-Response Models Sensitive to Pedestrian and Bicycle Travel Factors. Elaboration of these models is given."}, {"url": "https://onthinktanks.org/think-tank/institute-for-transportation-development-policy/", "page_content": "Support us\n\nOn Think Tanks was founded in mid 2010.

See below for impacts of our work, an interactive timeline of our history, and more.\n\nImpacts\n\nTimeline\n\nSee an interactive timeline of some of our favorite projects\n\nClick around the map to see highlights from 30 years of ITDP, or follow the arrows to take a tour.\n\nOur Vision for Cities\n\nThe Institute for Transportation and Development Policy uses technical expertise, advocacy and policy work to promote efficient, sustainable transport systems, dense, mixed-use cities, and safe, equitable urban spaces.\n\nITDP has a range of experience, covering:\n\nBus rapid transit\n\nBike share\n\nCycling and walking infrastructure\n\nTransit-oriented development\n\nTravel demand management\n\nParking reform\n\nTransport policy\n\nAnd a focus on the health, equity, and sustainability impacts of transit\n\nThoughts from Partners\n\nOver three decades, ITDP has worked with some of the best and brightest minds in sustainable transport. A few of them were generous enough to share their thoughts on the past 30 years.\n\n30 Years of Progress\n\nby Michael Replogle\n\nIn 1984, with the U.S. involved in an illegal war on Nicaragua a conversation with a friend of a friend, bike mechanic Karl Kurz, resulted in a simple idea: to send bikes (not bombs)* to teachers and health workers as humanitarian aid. We set out to organize bike clubs and churches to donate secondhand bicycles to Nicaragua as a response to the CIA\u2019s drugfunded war, and as a way of empowering ordinary American citizens who felt helpless to stop the actions of their government, but also as a way to demonstrate how basic mobility can massively improve quality of life.\n\nClick here to continue reading\n\nThe following year, we incorporated the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy. What started with 100 bikes, quickly grew to 10,000, moved beyond Nicaragua, to Haiti and Mozambique, and included efforts to reform the transport policies of both the World Bank and the U.S. government. Thirty years ago, cycling was considered a fringe element in U.S. transportation research, planning and engineering. \u201cSustainable transportation\u201d was not yet established as a concept, and proposals for research papers and conference sessions about it were initially rejected. A 1984 World Bank report on China, a country where the vast majority of people traveled by cycling, did not even contain the word \u201cbicycle,\u201d and the World Bank\u2019s Urban Transport Sector Study mentioned cycling just four times in 300 pages, disparaging it as a marginal mode suited just for villages. These policy choices demonstrated just how forcefully American car culture was being exported to the rest of the world, to everyone\u2019s detriment. The\n\nWorld Bank was happy to fund road and railway construction but considered walking and bicycling\n\nto be backward modes of travel, not worthy of attention, let alone financial support. Through conference sessions, publications and letter writing campaigns, our small team challenged the World Bank and other institutions to pay attention to bicycling and walking and the transport needs of the poor. Gradually, we made progress. We got the World Bank to hire its first bicycle coordinator. Invitations to train Bank staff and advise on integrating non-motorized transport into Bank strategies and projects followed in the 1990s. In a mark of how far we have come in 30 years, in 2012, the eight largest multilateral development banks (MDBs) offered a voluntary commitment to invest USD 175 billion over ten years in more sustainable transport. This action was spurred behind the scenes by ITDP and the Partnership on Sustainable Low Carbon Transport (SLoCaT), which ITDP helped organize in 2009. This brought a new dedication to efforts to advance, measure and report on progress toward sustainable transport. Though there are still bad ring road motorways and costly metro projects being advanced, many MDBs have adopted sustainable transport policies and initiatives. To accelerate the transformation of lending, we need to continue a long march through the institutions, helping cities develop and operate more efficient and cost-effective urban transport, integrated travel demand management, non-motorized transport and green freight. It\u2019s amazing to look back and see how much has been accomplished over 30 years, and it\u2019s due to decades of work by ITDP\u2019s dedicated staff, volunteers and donors. I want to say thank you for all you\u2019ve helped us do together. *Bikes Not Bombs, the group that launched ITDP, is now based in Boston: bikesnotbombs.org.\n\n30 Years of S\u00e3o Paulo by Helena Orenstein de Almeida\n\nFormer Director, ITDP Brazil Today, more and more people in S\u00e3o Paulo are switching to bikes, public transport and walking\u2014and contributing to a more rational, sustainable and pleasant experience in the city. Many feel as if they\u2019ve come to know a new city, gaining new perspectives on S\u00e3o Paulo by trading the isolation of a private automobile for the freedom of a bicycle. Click here to continue reading Thirty years ago, such a scenario was unthinkable, not only in S\u00e3o Paulo, but in other Brazilian cities as well. Car culture reigned in the 1980s, and cycling or promoting the rights of pedestrians were not options considered by either society or government. Tunnels and urban highways were then opened to give passage to a fleet that was beginning to grow and would explode in the 1990s. The city of S\u00e3o Paulo has made steady progress in the past ten to fifteen years with regard to urban mobility. A consolidated vision of a city where public transport is the primary mode of transportation has taken hold among both the public and the city government. In corridors of power, this vision has transcended partisan bickering to become a nearly universal goal. The positive political agenda and legacies of recent city administrations have been connected to this perception of public space: Marta Suplicy is remembered for having created the Bilhete \u00danico smart card fare control system and for installing the city\u2019s first bus corridors; Serra and Kassab are remembered for the Virada Cultural (with metro and buses running all night for the shows) and their campaign for pedestrians. This progress paved the way for the current mayor, Fernando Haddad, to take even greater strides toward the development of a more just and sustainable S\u00e3o Paulo. Haddad just approved a daring master plan, aligned with the most contemporary visions of urbanism, which are\u2014not by chance\u2014those defended by ITDP. Exclusive bus lanes continue to be expanded, in an initiative supported by 95 percent of the population. Meanwhile, each month around 40 kilometers of new cycle lanes are implemented and eventually will cover 400 kilometers, the goal established for the end of 2015. This includes the Butant\u00e3 bike lane, which ITDP designed in partnership with the city. \u201cThe example comes from abroad,\u201d said the Mayor in a recent interview, thus hinting at the important role that ITDP played and continues to play in these positive developments in S\u00e3o Paulo. By influencing public opinion through the media and through direct contact with the government, ITDP can be proud of its role in S\u00e3o Paulo, as in so many other cities throughout the world. For a youth of just 30 years, this is no small accomplishment\u2014and this is just the beginning.\n\nOld Values, New Again By Paul Steely White, Executive Director, Transportation Alternatives and former Regional Director for ITDP Africa As we go deeper into the 21st century, demand for ITDP\u2019s work is growing. That\u2019s in part because of urbanization, and in part because of concerns about climate change, and in part because of the huge successes in ITDP\u2019s past 30 years\u2014the world-class BRT systems and bike networks and pedestrian spaces. Mostly though, I think the growing demand for ITDP\u2019s work is because of the organization\u2019s particular vision. Click here to continue reading The public right-of-way should be designed and managed for the public. Until ITDP\u2019s founding in 1985, that revolutionary idea was hidden in plain sight, obscured by the decades-long reign of the \u201cexpert\u201d traffic engineer, who insisted that rigorous analysis conducted during a site visit or two was the most reasonable way to shape the streets and communities that people called home for their whole lives. ITDP was the first to plant a big green and white flag and shout to the world: \u201cThe engineers have no clothes!\u201d They insisted, with dogged persistence, that there were smarter, more efficient, more inclusive ways to design city streets and urban transportation systems. This is the sacred work of ITDP\u2014work that has drawn thousands to dedicated service, has caused hundreds of thousands to take action and impacted the lives of hundreds of millions around the world. Because of the improvements ITDP has won, future generations will be healthier, happier and more connected. And as we go further into the 21st century, and the demand for ITDP\u2019s work further increases, it\u2019s that particular vision that must carry the day. If I have one big idea for ITDP to ensure 30 more years of success, it is for the organization to meet this challenge of demand by growing its direct engagement with the public and honoring its particular vision for smarter, more efficient, more inclusive ways to design city streets and urban transportation systems. While policy makers and practitioners are more likely to know ITDP, revere ITDP and demand its services, the riding public is our real customer base. ITDP may be the most effective organization that average citizens know nothing about. Most urbanites are unaware that their public space and transportation resources are being squandered. More widespread familiarity with ITDP, its values, its heroic history and its innovative solutions will ultimately unlock the resources needed to meet the rising demand for sustainable, equitable transportation. An inclusive way of thinking about streets was what set us apart, and an inclusive way of changing them is what will carry us forward with great success.\n\nThe Triumph of TransJakarta By Alfred Nakatsuma\n\nRegional Environmental Office Director, USAID When ITDP began, BRT only existed in a substantial form in Curitiba, Brazil, and convincing governments to consider this new system of mobility for their cities was a monumental task. I witnessed this firsthand as the USAID project manager for a grant to ITDP to undertake the establishment of the TransJakarta busway. In 2002, I went with ITDP and Jakarta\u2019s Governor Sutiyoso to Colombia to see the Trans-Milenio busway in Bogot\u00e1. Click here to continue reading The purpose of this trip was to convince the Governor that a similar busway should be built in Jakarta. We thought this would be a difficult task because BRT was relatively new to Asia, the required budget was big, and there was little human capacity to implement it. We were not highly optimistic. Due in large part to the impressive show in Bogot\u00e1, Sutiyoso saw the potential of a high quality BRT system and agreed. ITDP and USAID were elated. ITDP quickly provided a superior technical design, and Jakarta started construction. However, the six months of major traffic disruption on the city\u2019s main north-south corridor created public outcry and political pushback\u2014not from Indonesians, but from the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta. Their acquiescence came only with the assurance that USAID\u2019s funding for ITDP\u2019s design would not be publicly revealed. We kept our secret safe for the time being and were certain that the temporary pain would be compensated over the long run. After months of finger pointing and complaints about nasty traffic, TransJakarta was launched and became highly popular. The year the system opened in 2004, it served over 50,000 people per day. Today, it\u2019s increased to 11 corridors, serving 360,000 people per day. Unfortunately, the quality of construction was far below the quality of design we provided, rendering the BRT less effective and less efficient than it might have been, and leading to jail time for the contractors involved. But despite all the skepticism and headaches, TransJakarta is still serving the poor, improving air quality and moving thousands of people every day. Since those difficult times, thanks in large part to ITDP, BRT has increased in popularity and has been developed in many other cities, including impressive projects in China. Cities across Asia and beyond are much more certain about BRT\u2019s benefits, and improved designs are creating larger impacts for the benefit of people and our planet. Congratulations to ITDP for 30 years of hard work. Though your organization is small, you have made large impacts and have helped transform bus rapid transit into a tool for efficient urban transportation, pollution and climate change mitigation, as well as human livability.\n\nUrban Mobility in 2045: Energy Production By Julio Lamas, Journalist, Brazil According to the United Nations, 6.5 billion people will inhabit cities by 2045, with more than 80 percent of them living in emerging countries like Brazil, China and India. Especially in cities in these countries, one of the most important issues for the next 30 years is how to plan urban centers that will provide a better quality of life for the 84 percent increase in global population that experts anticipate. Click here to continue reading Today, many urban planning transformations are underway to create more density in cities, options for public transportation and spaces for cyclists and pedestrians. In the future, the energy matrix will play a larger role in the debate over urban mobility in the context of imminent global warming and the containment of greenhouse gas emissions. But this discussion won\u2019t be held on the field of growing consumption as much as it will be in the perspective of production. At this moment, renewable sources account for 22 percent of world energy production, according to the Renewable Energy Policy Network. Indeed, a great leap forward has happened in this direction, but until 2044, solar energy and other clean sources must be assimilated in every economic activity inside cities to answer for a new class of consumers and producers. From this point of view, public transportation, cars, cyclists and pedestrians will be partly responsible for pushing forward energy production in more advanced cities. Projects like solar roadways, which make roads and venues pickups for solar energy, will be taken very seriously and will provide electricity for houses and the operation of clean transportation systems and their infrastructure. New buildings will also be smart and involve new intelligent materials in their designs, as slighter, more transparent and flexible solar cells are developed. Imagine a building by Frank Gehry or Renzo Piano that is able to produce energy enough for its offices and apartments, and at the same time feed the central grid that powers subways, bus rapid transit systems, light rails, electric cars and delivery drones. Drones will lessen short and medium distances between cities, generate information about traffic, facilitate the exchange of products and help to expand the areas covered by local public services and private businesses. In another technological improvement, we will probably see more use of data-analyzing software for sustainable urban planning and mobility control. And this is exactly what researchers from MIT in India and Singapore and the University of Michigan in the U.S. have been developing over the past ten years. The objective is to allow decision making on urban interventions with the maximum of real-time information and the minimum of direct impact on the cities, through a series of simulations and studies. It will be easier\n\nto find new spaces for construction, expand public transportation on demand, create projects with connections between urban mobility modes and avoid traffic congestion. It\u2019s hard to play the role of a fluent and coherent futurologist like Arthur C. Clarke or Ray Kurzweil, but we can try. It helps to think that we in fact live (right now!) in a golden age of knowledge about cities and urban mobility. With great help from ITDP, Brazil has conquered so much in terms of educating and enlightening minds about the importance of sustainable and democratic developments in urban spaces that the vision I described does not seem like such a distant future.\n\nPlanning and Implementing Mobility By Yonah Freemark\n\nMetropolitan Planning Council, Chicago Change has set in. In virtually every American city, the fastest-growing neighborhoods are those located in the core. These communities are dense, mixed-use and made for sustainable transportation. In city after city, this growth has produced more walking, more biking and higher rates of public transit use. Click here to continue reading For the most part, the private market has triggered these changes by responding to popular demand that\u2014after two decades of a steady uptick\u2014has ceased to be a \u201ctrend\u201d and is now the new development paradigm in U.S. cities. In too many places, however, development is constrained, and with it our ability to produce transit-rich metropolitan regions. Governmental regulations promote limited density, offer too little transit and require an oversupply of roads and parking. As poverty declines in the core, producing increasingly exclusive neighborhoods, it has shifted to the suburbs, reducing the ability of the transit system to expand access to opportunity and forcing the most needy to rely on unsustainable, expensive personal automobility. It\u2019s time for the public sector to revamp development regulations to build more livable cities and fully harness this growth. Stronger political will is needed to fund the transit investments that serve people living in dense areas, particularly in large metropolitan areas. New York, Los Angeles and Chicago each have expanded their rail and rapid bus networks to meet their respective needs, but these efforts pale in comparison with those being made in major European and Asian regions. If we\u2019re not careful, continued core growth without corresponding transit investments will mean increased congestion and journey times, reducing quality of life. A failure to invest outside of the traditional city will mean a continued geographical disconnect between the transit system and the population that most needs it. To seize growth\u2019s momentum and ensure equity in our transit-oriented neighborhoods, we must allow increased density. This requires not only regulatory changes, but also a commitment to using city land more effectively as a development resource that prioritizes mixed-use, mixed-income projects. Not doing so will reduce the potential for economic growth, increase housing prices and ultimately limit our ability to contain unsustainable, automobile-oriented greenfield development. Over the next 30 years, leaders of American cities must take a more dominant role not only in developing proactive plans for transit-based developments designed in the public interest, but also in leading their implementation. With political leadership, whole neighborhoods can be transformed into urban communities designed specifically around sustainable transport, with equitable access to housing, jobs and other resources.\n\nTransport Takes Center Stage By Rehana Moosajee, Transportation Planner\n\nCity of Johannesburg, South Africa Transport is more than just vehicles and infrastructure. Transport is about the dignity of the people using it. Transport policies and practices influence people\u2019s access to opportunity, often dictate what life prospects are open to them and substantially influence economies and quality of life. Click here to continue reading Transportation has been integral in shaping movements for rights and human dignity, from when Mahatma Gandhi came to South Africa and got kicked out of the first class compartment because he had the wrong skin color to Rosa Parks who sat down to stand up, giving birth to the civil rights movement that has transformed the United States. But even as transport has the power to stir us to act in defense against the indefensible, inequity still plagues transport in the form of where we are putting our resources. I am hopeful that the next movement spawned by transportation is for people-centered cities. The next 30 years of sustainable transport will need to throw off\n\nvehicles and modes and focus on human beings. More pedestrians are killed in car crashes than motor vehicle drivers or passengers. Streets and roads around the world are built without sidewalks or cycle lanes, only for cars. And the voices we hear on the radio or TV news are the car captives, complaining about the injustices that car drivers are suffering. What I hope from the next 30 years is to hear more voices. The voices of the disenfranchised and displaced, demanding transportation that responds to their needs\u2014to reach work and school and hospitals\u2014in an affordable and convenient manner. I hope to hear the silent voices of today demanding sidewalks, so that they do not have to walk in the street, afraid of cars. I hope that the movement for designing cities for people swells forth, beginning with how we design our streets. We show value for people by giving them dignified and safe options. To do that, we require an ongoing investment in building transportation leaders who boldly and fearlessly provide thought leadership, challenge the status quo, help to break through siloed thinking and provide voice for the billions whose transport experiences remain challenging on a daily basis. A commitment to knowledge sharing, respect for local conditions and culture, an openness to share and learn, collaboration rather than competition, approaches that incorporate head and heart: these are what need to inform transport policies and planning as we move forward. We must resist the temptation to see placemaking and transit options as merely engineering disciplines, lest we lose the human component of the decisions being made. Rea Vaya, the bus rapid transit project I worked on in Johannesburg, was the first investment in public transport that connected townships to the downtown in over a decade. With ITDP\u2019s help, we were able to launch based on this. We needed the sharpest minds and the strongest hearts to do this, and now it is expanding and hopefully only getting better. As ITDP reflects on its past 30 years, may we be reminded of the ongoing urgency in elevating transport in the quest to change the lives of the citizens across the globe. As the world grapples with issues of sustainability, quality of life, growing inequality, poverty and imbalance, the Institute for Transport Development and Policy is likely to have an increasingly important role. Urban migration, depletion of resources, loss of life through road crashes, diminishing air quality, increasingly insular communities and a focus on infrastructure development to the exclusion of people are all issues that require bold and visionary leadership. ITDP and the policies it advocates have the potential to equip leaders, decision-makers, service providers and civil-society activists alike with the tools to make decisions that are about the well-being of humans and the planet. As ITDP turns 30, it is time to create a spotlight on transport that clarifies its interdependency and relationships with other aspects of life. As we pause to celebrate, may we be reminded of the ongoing urgency in elevating transport in the quest to change the lives of citizens across the globe.\n\nThe Word on the Street\n\nWe asked advocates, experts, activists and everyone in between to share their perspective onhow far the field of sustainable transportation has come, where it\u2019s going next, and what it means to the people involved. See some of our favorite responses"}, {"url": "https://www.itdp.org/who-we-are/history-of-itdp/", "page_content": "Founded in 1985, the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) has become a leading organization in the promotion of environmentally sustainable and equitable transportation policies and projects worldwide. ITDP was created by sustainable transport advocates in the U.S. to counteract the export to developing countries of costly and environmentally damaging models of dependence on the private automobile. In its first ten years, ITDP successfully advocated for the redirection of lending activity by the World Bank and other multi-lateral institutions away from an exclusive focus on road projects and toward more multi-modal transport solutions.\n\nIn more recent years, we have focused on working with municipalities and non-governmental organizations in developing countries to implement projects that demonstrate how transport emissions, collisions, and road fatalities can be reduced, or how the basic mobility of the poor can be improved. ITDP\u2019s primary programs include the development of bus rapid transit (BRT) systems, promoting the use of Transit-oriented Development (TOD), and planning facilities for bicycles and pedestrians. Further programs include traffic demand management (TDM), parking regulations, and the revitalization of city centers. Below is a brief history of ITDP and how our work has developed.\n\n\n\n2016 Global communities take note of successful projects. The Yichang BRT wins the ADB Best Performing Project and the Sustainable Transport Award, Chennai\u2019s NMT Policy and pedestrian projects earn it the international Sustainia Award, and several cities join India\u2019s Smart Cities initiative to invest in sustainable infrastructure for rapidly growing regions.\n\n\n\n2015 ITDP celebrates our 30th year advancing sustainable transport and livable cities. ITDP has worked in over 100 cities in more than 35 countries, improving quality of life for millions. ITDP welcomes new CEO Clayton Lane. In addition, ITDP is instrumental is bringing car-free days to Chennai and Coimbatore, India, and Vision Zero to Mexico City. New ITDP-led BRT systems in Yichang, China and Pune, India receive regional and international acclaim. In two of the most critical, high-level agreements, the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Climate Summit, advocacy by ITDP and our partners help cities, transport, and people achieved unprecedented recognition.\n\n\n\n2014 In Brazil, Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Transcarioca is awarded a BRT Standard Gold rating. Two additional gold-standard corridors open in Belo Horizonte. ITDP releases an updated version of the BRT Standard in 2014, refining and improving details on evaluating best practices. Chennai adopts India\u2019s first NMT policy, guaranteeing that 60% of the city\u2019s budget be dedicated to walking and cycling initiatives. Rio de Janeiro saw the delivery of 380 km of cycling and walking infrastructure, and Belo Horizonte made significant progress toward its 100km goal. S\u00e3o Paulo also gained an impressive 400km of pedestrian and cycling. Lanzhou, China launched a new bike share, complementing the city\u2019s recently opened BRT corridor.\n\n2013 Buenos Aires, Argentina, expands its BRT along the world\u2019s widest avenue, 9 de Julio. In Mexico City, Line 5 of the Metrob\u00fas BRT is the first corridor in the country to feature a complete street model, integrating green space, pedestrian and cycling-friendly measures. ITDP releases updated BRT and TOD Standards, as well as a Bike-Share Planning Guide. The BRT and TOD Standards define and refine best practices, and provide metrics for evaluation of specific projects. The Bike-Share Planning Guide tracks the growing bike-share trend and evaluates key aspects for creating successful systems moving forward.\n\n2012 ITDP releases the BRT Standard, the first tool of its kind to clearly define the essential features of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). Rio de Janeiro opens its first true BRT corridor, TransOeste, which scores a gold ranking on the BRT Standard. The Lanzhou BRT opens in December, and is Asia\u2019s second-highest capacity BRT system, after Guangzhou. Mexico City\u2019s Metrobus opens its forth corridor this year, notable for its path through the historic center. At the Rio+ 20 Summit, ITDP and our partners are instrumental in winning a commitment from the eight largest multilateral development banks to direct $175 billion to sustainable transport over the next decade.\n\n2011 ITDP launches Our Cities Ourselves, a visioning, exhibition, and design program to help cities plan more sustainable transportation. 2011 sees OCO programs in cities around the world, including New York City, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Ahmedabad, Johannesburg, Rio de Janeiro and Guangzhou. Buenos Aires opens its first line of BRT in May, with 12 km of dedicated lanes. The city also constructs more than 40 kilometers of bike lanes and opens a bike share system. In India, the Ahmedabad BRT grows to 50 kilometers with over 130,000 passengers per day.\n\n2010 In our 25th year, ITDP realizes a major goal in establishing a world class Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in each region where we work. On February 21, Guangzhou, China opens a 22.5km (14-mile) BRT. It is the first BRT to directly connect to a metro system, the first BRT system in China to include bike parking, and has the world\u2019s highest number of passengers, highest bus frequency, and the longest BRT stations. ITDP serves as the lead technical advisor to the city. In non-motorized transit, Mexico City\u2019s Ecobici bike-share system opens as the largest in Latin America, initially attracting 10,000 users and more than 2,000 trips daily.\n\n2009 Ahmedabad\u2019s Janmarg (\u2018The People\u2019s Way\u2019 in Hindi), BRT system opens. ITDP serves as a lead technical advisor to the city in developing the system. It is the first BRT integrated system in India. Rea Vaya BRT opens in Johannesburg, South Africa after a two-year planning and construction process. This innovative BRT connects the township of Soweto to the central business district, becoming the first real public transit system implemented since the end of apartheid. ITDP, together with local authorities, begins working with taxi operators to help transform the industry and launch BRT operating companies.\n\n2008 Amidst global financial concerns, investment in public transportation holds steady. Cities around the world commit to building BRT, bike lanes, and affordable, efficient housing. Plans to add bike lanes on major roads are advanced in Mexico City, Guadalajara, Harbin, Delhi, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Bogot\u00e1. Ridership on TransJakarta increases to over 120,00 riders per day, and approximately 97 kilometers (60.3 miles).\n\n2007 ITDP releases the BRT Guide, providing detailed support and guidance on the creation of high quality BRTs. The guide is translated into Portuguese, Spanish, and Chinese for international use. TransJakarta opens five new lines, dramatically increasing access and ridership through the city. Ahmedabad begins construction on the eagerly anticipated Janmarg BRT system.\n\n2006 With a renewed focus on city center revitalization, ITDP begins work with Sao Paulo and Mexico city to protect their Historic Centers through pedestrianization and traffic control. ITDP co-sponsors a conference with the National Urban Development Ministry in India, which leads to a new urban transport policy and qualifies BRT projects for government funding. This results in the approval of new BRT systems in Pune, Indore, Jaipur, and Bhopal.\n\n2005 Bogot\u00e1, Colombia win the first ever Sustainable Transport Award, recognizing leadership and vision in sustainable transportation and urban livability. Bogot\u00e1 continues to serve as a model for BRT implementation, bike path integration, and the establishment of public space. As TransJakarta expands, it more than triples its ridership, from an average of 30,000 passengers in its first year to nearly 100,000 by the end of 2005. ITDP research examines the link between transportation and healthcare in rural Africa.\n\n2004 In January, Jakarta, Indonesia unveils Asia\u2019s first Bogot\u00e1-inspired BRT system built outside of Latin America, TransJakarta. ITDP is a key technical advisor on the project. Implemented in an unprecedented 9 months, TransJakarta has new, enclosed stations, pre-paid ticketing, high levels of security, and comfortable, air-conditioned buses, revolutionizing perceptions of bus-based travel in the country.\n\n2003 As ITDP continues to grow and diversify program areas, progress is achieved on multiple issues around the world. BRT work begins in Cape Town; a pilot Traffic Demand Management project is implemented in Sao Paulo; Yogyakarta, Indonesia pedestrianizes the important commercial and cultural street, Malioboro Avenue; thousands of low-cost \u2018California Bikes\u2019 are brought to Senegal, Ghana, and South Africa; and brownfield cleanup and redevelopment continues in the Czech cities of Plzen, Sternberk, Olomouc and Brno.\n\n2002 ITDP grows presence in Asia, working with the cities of Guangzhou, China, and Jakarta, Indonesia, to develop BRT systems and funded in part by a United States Agency for International Development grant. ITDP launches the California Bike Coalition, an initiative to bring a high quality and affordable bicycles to rural households in Africa. In global policy, ITDP has achieved significant progress in our goal to shift the World Bank\u2019s Urban Transport Policy toward giving priority to non-motorized transport and improving public transit.\n\n2001 TransMilenio continues to expand and improve, moving approximately 550,000 people per day in its first year, making it the world\u2019s busiest BRT system. Building off TransMilenio\u2019s success, ITDP sponsors and organizes workshops and presentations on Bus Rapid Transit in over 15 cities, winning support for BRT projects in many and laying the groundwork for future projects. ITDP begins work replicating the success of the cycle rickshaw project in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, and implementing pedestrian projects in Guangzhou, China.\n\n2000 Bogot\u00e1, Colombia opens the progressive TransMilenio BRT system, created and developed by then-Mayor Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa and influenced by ITDP papers. It inspires the spread of BRT globally and catalyzes ITDP\u2019s work in promoting and providing technical support for BRT projects. ITDP\u2019s Indian Cycle Rickshaw Modernization Project successfully completes its mission, with more than 8000 modern cycle rickshaws improving lives across India. ITDP provides technical support to several institutions in Central and Eastern Europe to guide growth toward denser, mixed land use developments.\n\n1998 In 1998, ITDP coordinates the second General Assembly in Manila for Sustainable Transport Action Network for Asia and Pacific (SUSTRAN), a network of organizations dedicated to transport policies and investments that foster social equity, ecological sustainability, health, and safety. This conference initiates sustainable transport campaigns in Jakarta, Manila, New Delhi, Penang, and Calcutta. ITDP launches Afribike in South Africa, which helps distribute hundreds of bikes to poor communities and healthcare workers.\n\n1997 ITDP leads efforts to refocus guidelines of the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) transport program, opening up millions of dollars for BRT and non-motorized transport projects around the world.\n\n1996 ITDP chairs a transport caucus at UN Habitat II in Istanbul, Turkey in June. Habitat II focus on the dual objectives of adequate shelter for all and sustainable cities. UN Habitat II also marks the first time official dialogue sessions with NGOs, including ITDP, are incorporated into the conference. ITDP Executive Director Walter Hook is the primary dissident to World Bank paper, \u2018Sustainable Transport\u2019 which focuses on privatization as solution to poor quality transit and ignores motorization as an issue.\n\n1995 ITDP\u2019s review of a European Investment Bank (EIB) highway in Hungary helps initiate efforts to make EIB more accountable.\n\n1993 The Transportation Alternatives program, which works on multilateral policy reform, is launched. ITDP and allies, including the EPA, Friends of the Earth, and IIEC, convince the US Treasury to call on the World Bank to draft a formal transport policy consistent with environmental and poverty alleviation goals. ITDP establishes the \u2018Laboratwa Esperance\u2019 at the Albert Schweitzer Hospital in Deschapelles, Haiti. The facility trains local people to assemble, repair, design, and fabricate non-motorized vehicles for use in the hospital and community organizations in the area.\n\n1991 ITDP writes a seminal paper, Non-Motorized Vehicles in Asian Cities, for the World Bank\u2019s Asia Transport Sector Study, identifying strategies to protect and strengthen cycling in modernizing cities.\n\n1990 ITDP helps establish the Campaign for New Transportation Priorities (CNTP). CNTP is a coalition of 37 environmental, labor and citizen groups from across the United States working toward efficiency and environmental priorities in domestic transportation policies. ITDP & CNTP draft four transportation policy papers that play a key role in the creation of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), a bill that passes in 1991.\n\n1989 ITDP reaches its goal of sending over 10,000 bicycles to Nicaragua, which are used to finance a new local bicycle assembly industry there. ITDP wins budget language in the U.S. Congress that helps spur U.S. bicycle programs, including convincing the Peace Corps to put its volunteers on bicycles rather than motorcycles.\n\n1986 ITDP releases a seminal paper by Michael Replogle entitled \u2018Sustainable Transport\u2019, which laid out the fundamental principles of ITDP. ITDP organizes a new task force on non-motorized transportation in developing countries under the sponsorship of the Transportation Research Board of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. Organizing annual meetings dedicated to promoting innovation and progress in transportation through research, this new task force soon grows into a full committee with a unique emphasis on integrating the economic, social, and environmental issues of the developing world into transportation planning."}], "Michael Replogle's projects include bus rapid transit, bike-sharing, and pedestrian-friendly streets.": [{"url": "https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2021/06/11/the-streetsblog-interview-michael-replogle-the-key-dot-official-you-never-heard-of-speaks/", "page_content": "DOT Deputy Commissioner for Policy Michael Replogle is certainly not a household name in the Streetsblog universe, but that's only because he played his vital role in the background in his six-plus years as a high city official. Think of the policy shop as the \u201cbig picture\u201d unit inside an agency whose larger mission \u2014 move stuff around \u2014 hasn't changed. But Vision Zero? Dedicated bus lanes? Battling community boards? Bike lanes? Citi Bike expansion? Automated vehicle testing? Climate change strategies? Replogle has seen it all (even if you haven't seen him). On Friday, Replogle marked his last day on the job (he's leaving for personal reasons that you don't need to know about), but we expect to see him again, perhaps at the next mayor's DOT. In any event, he chatted with Streetsblog's Gersh Kuntzman about the challenges of inter-agency work, the importance of strong leadership, his concerns about the future of automated vehicles, and more. What follows is a lightly edited transcript.\n\nGersh Kuntzman: Let's start with the idea of leadership. If you look at the mayoral race, it's amazing how seven or eight years ago there was one guy, Bill de Blasio, who talked about issues like the Green New Deal, or the desire to have more cycling, or better bus lanes, etc, and now everybody is talking about these issues. But there\u2019s a large problem in our city right now: when I talk to people about these issues, everybody\u2019s behind them. But then you talk about how it could get done, like for example, \u201cHey on Hylan Boulevard, we want to remove 300 parking spaces to make a dedicated bus lane,\" people freak out. Or on 34th Avenue in Jackson Heights, where DOT has created the open street that worldwide could be acknowledged as a leading effort during Covid, you now hear pushback against the idea of a permanent open street because of the notion that maybe people would have to give up parking. Could you speak about the challenge you faced in that arena, and give any advice about what needs to be done in the next administration?\n\nMichael Replogle\n\nMichael Replogle: I think its heartening that all of the candidates for mayor are basically saying that they want to do most of these things that the de Blasio administration did to advance the sustainable transportation, and they want to do those things more, faster, and with greater intensity. And no doubt that will present leadership challenges for whoever takes that post \u2014 the city is constantly hampered by the governing structures that we\u2019re caught in. The state controls a lot of what the city can do, so we end up having to make second-best choices in many cases because of politics, or because we don\u2019t have the authority under the city charter, or we have to get permission from Albany to do something.\n\nSo finding ways of establishing a better relationship between the mayor and the governor, and between the city and the state, certainly could help facilitate more timely progress on a lot of these things. I think the next mayor and members of the council will have to face the challenge of how to build coalitions that can be supportive in these areas that can be deeply controversial, like loss of parking. Despite these challenges, I think we\u2019ve got some really outstanding models that we\u2019ve developed through our response to COVID, which will give whoever is next in office some really good material to work from, and successes to point to, which will I think make it easier to have faster progress.\n\nKuntzman: As that guy once said, \"Never let a crisis go to waste.\" You talked about those second-best choices you needed to make in some cases, but DOT has so much power to establish dedicated bus lanes, busways for example, which was so successful on 14th street and so successful elsewhere...\n\nReplogle: Yes!\n\nKuntzman: ... but so controversial! So this barrier you speak of is interesting: you mentioned that state partners don\u2019t always make things easy, and also on the community board level, but really you guys have so much latitude anyway. Do you feel frustrated that even more wasn\u2019t done? That a busway on 14th Street didn\u2019t automatically lead to five of those in every borough? On some level, you've got to be frustrated that you can\u2019t do what you probably consider the easier jobs.\n\nReplogle: I certainly aspire to see more accomplished than we were able to accomplish during this term, but that said we have had very strong leadership at this agency, from Janette Sadik Khan, to Polly Trottenberg, to Margret Forgione, to Hank Gutman [current DOT commissioner]. Each of them has brought a different leadership style to the agency, and I found it easy to work with each of them, to try and advance things. Often the challenges lay in that triangulation: We do what an agency can do day to day, but City Hall needs to take into account other factors such as \"What can we get NYPD to do\" and \"How do we deal with the state Assembly member or state Senator who wants to weigh in on these issues?\" There are a lot of issues in play, and often issues tangential to transportation become impediments to our making progress in transportation; good progress gets held hostage to other issues.\n\nKuntzman: What do you mean?\n\nReplogle: Well, it took us four years to get through the state legislature for the reauthorization of speed cameras and to expand the time in which they could be used and the locations, and even now that fight continues. That got hung up on issues around standards for yeshivas \u2014 something that really didn\u2019t have much to do with transportation. I think that\u2019s where city hall gets caught in a box. I sense the frustration that you feel from your angle on this, but our agency is doing the best it can with the resources we\u2019ve got.\n\nNew York City does not have massive pedestrian places like the K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe is Stuttgart.\n\nKuntzman: (laughs) \"The best it can do\" depends on your perspective. The perspective of someone in your Bridges division would be very different from the perspective of someone in your biking division, I would imagine, or the public space division.\n\nLet's stay on the topic of different levels of success within DOT divisions. One of the issues we talk a lot about that you've worked on is the open streets and open restaurants program, which was really so successful. It was a quick build, which needed to be done at that time, but there are longer-term issues with creating permanent truly safe public spaces, pedestrian plazas for example. I know you guys create those spaces, but not on a massive scale in terms of what some of our readers call for. Many people complain, \"Why isn\u2019t X avenue a car-free plaza from what street to whatever street?\" I know you guys have to ram projects through community boards, and you\u2019ve got to get the mayor on board with that, but at the end of the day, NYC doesn't have these permanent pedestrianized places like other cities do. Talk to me a little about the frustration there. Like I said the Bridges division can look at the \"level of service\" of your roadways and say, \"Hey, our level of service is awesome,\" but your bike division can look at the level of service and say, \"Well, its not as awesome as it should be.\" Are these different levels of success within DOT frustrating?\n\nReplogle: As you would expect within an agency this large, there is healthy tension between different parts of the agency over a lot of these things and for me its been satisfying to sit in the policy shop of the commissioner's office trying to help divisions break out of their silos, and to talk to each other more effectively, and where things have been stuck try to unstick them. The policy unit that I\u2019ve headed is basically a sort of think-do tank within the agency, and we\u2019ve done a number of pilot projects in different areas \u2014 car sharing, bike sharing, scooter sharing, and the like. We\u2019re now about to launch electric vehicle charging, and those pilots have all generally proven themselves to be pretty successful, and gone on to be made permanent.\n\nThe pace of change has been frustrating to me. We are often encumbered by our procurement rules. I wish honestly that several years ago we might have started a process to take a franchise, to develop multiple bicycle parking units around the street like Oonee was trying to do, but our procurement rules, and our plaza rules, under the city charter, prevent us from rolling that out unless we go through a franchise process, which is about a three-year process and requires city council approval. This is common in our work: things that on the surface look like they ought to be simple and nimble and quick often take longer.\n\nMichael Replogle, far right, with (from right), then-DOT Commissioner Polly Trottenberg, UN Habitat Executive Director Maimunah Mohd Sharif and Sierra Club President Ram\u00f3n Cruz.\n\nI think that the open restaurants program is a good example of things being much harder than they should be. Some of our own rules and regulations have been put into place in response to political pressure to make sure community boards have a strong voice in whether a restaurant would have sidewalk seating, tables, and to make sure we went through a detailed and fairly expensive process to design and engineer those treatments on a runoff basis. During COVID, those rules were getting in the way of saving the restaurant industry, so we found a way during the crisis to identify the need for a nimble scaling of an open restaurant program, we had 6,000 open restaurants three weeks after we first put that idea together, and I think that's a lesson that we should take and apply to more places.\n\nKuntzman: That\u2019s the kind of thing that I\u2019m talking about. We\u2019re going to move out of a crisis and a lot of the people are going to come back to community boards and say, \"I was never consulted!\" and \"Yyou gotta undo all the great stuff that you did,\" which most of us think would be absurd because it was so successful.\n\nReplogle: We saw this around the pedestrianization of Broadway a few years ago, which was a very successful and popular program. At one point there were suggestions in City Hall that we should take back some of the pedestrianization of Broadway, there was a public outcry saying, \"No, we actually like this quite a lot,\" and I think it might take some public outcry saying, \"No, we don\u2019t want to see open streets and open restaurants rolled back.\" In fact the de Blasio administration is making those programs permanent, and I think we\u2019re trying to move these things as quickly as possible into being irreconcilable, unrollbackable facts on the ground.\n\nKuntzman: I always come back to all the interviews I did for the council election preview we did earlier this year, where I talked to people who are such strong supporters of climate change initiatives and such strong supporters of the Green New Deal, but then they come back to, \"Oh but there are people in my neighborhood that like to drive.\" Sure, I get that, but at some point, we really do have to reduce the use of the car. The mayor talks a lot about how we need to reduce our reliance on the car almost every time I ask him about it, and DOT can play some role in that.\n\nReplogle: Buses play a role...\n\nKuntzman (rudely interrupting): Yeah, and if a bus ride from Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights to Astoria would take eight minutes because there's a busway, a lot of people wouldn\u2019t drive to Astoria, because obviously it's hard to find parking anyway. On a personal level it has to be very frustrating.\n\nReplogle, posing with then-Transportation Alternatives Executive Director Paul Steely White after a ride.\n\nReplogle: It is when we don\u2019t see leadership, and sometimes it's very gratifying when we do see leadership. There are plenty of times where Mayor de Blasio has, in fact, stood up to community boards who\u2019ve said, \"No we don\u2019t want a vital traffic safety improvement,\" and the mayor said we\u2019re going to do it anyway and backed the transportation commissioner. It\u2019s going to take profiles in leadership in the next administration to build on that record of success, and to make sure that the next mayor is even more successful in moving us towards being the more European style city of sustainable transport that we have the potential to be.\n\nKuntzman: The mayor doesn\u2019t like when I tweak him about what Mayor Hidalgo does in Paris, but she really used that crisis to transform her city for the better.\n\nReplogle: She did. I followed what\u2019s going on in Paris closely, and I think that she\u2019s done some pretty amazing stuff. She\u2019s also working with a city government area that is much more compact. If Paris were reshaped to New York\u2019s geography, it would only cover Manhattan and western Brooklyn/Queens, excluding Staten Island, excluding Eastern Queens, and Northern Bronx. She\u2019s dealing with different politics there than the New York mayor has to deal with.\n\nKuntzman: Staying on parking for a second, Mayor de Blasio has talked about the pay-by-plate system for so many years. I know it got a little delayed because of COVID, but that solution (fixing placard abuse, preventing city employees from parking all over the place, enabling the creation of pickup and drop-off zones that are timed, and people being charged by different times) is like talking about how, when I was a kid, they said we would all be driving flying cars. I feel like it\u2019s 2021 and this kind of technology must have existed for a while now, and it's still not in place. What can we do to make sure the next mayor does this?\n\nReplogle: I think we\u2019re on the cusp of putting it in place here, with the new meters where they\u2019ll put in your license plate number so that the data from your payment session goes into the cloud and we will be at a place where no longer will the traffic enforcement agent go down the street and look for a little piece of paper on the windshield. Then it becomes much easier to create a culture of compliance around our parking and curb regulations. I think that\u2019s an essential predicate to dealing with the whole placard abuse problems, and to restoring more order to the curbs, to reducing double parked trucks, which present a safety problem. So I\u2019m quite optimistic about whole architecture of plate based enforcement that you described. It's one that I have really been like a dog on a bone for the last six years at DOT, helping our staff promote it and move it to reality. The key challenge on implementation would be getting the collaboration of the Police Department on the enforcement side of that. It\u2019s gonna take the leadership of the mayor and the police commissioner to make that happen. That\u2019s above my pay-grade.\n\nKuntzman: Sure, but you\u2019re an observer of politics and policy. I think if there is any agency we\u2019ve examined as critically as the DOT, it\u2019s the NYPD. We\u2019ve found them to be, quite frankly, not a very good Vision Zero partner in terms of what we\u2019ve documented. Do you have any comments on the NYPD as a Vision Zero partner?\n\nReplogle: There have been disappointments for sure, along the way, but I think that the Police Ddepartment has come a long way in the six years that I\u2019ve been here, in terms of getting that paradigm shift. Again, it comes down to leadership. Part of it is culture change, too, within the agency, and culture change happens slowly. Again, it\u2019s a question of leadership and what the expectations are that are set by the mayor, and whoever is a future police commissioner.\n\nKuntzman: You\u2019re a diplomat in the sense that it does come down to leadership, and if I was in your position I would be so frustrated all the time because we have 51 percent of the Police Department that lives in the suburbs, and the vast majority of cops drive to work every day, and have a parking space waiting for them. So even if they're doing their jobs 100 percent right, there\u2019s a culture gap between your biking division, for example, and the NYPD that is not merely bridgeable by appointing a new police commissioner. It\u2019s like you\u2019ve got to change the whole thing, what's that expression, from the root to, um, I'm not a farmer, whatever it is that comes out of the ground. And that\u2019s not something that you could do personally, nor could Hank Gutman do that personally, but it has got to be frustrating.\n\nReplogle: Some of these things are frustrations, to those who are trying to implement more rapid reform. I\u2019ve been working on advancing sustainable transportation for 40 years in a variety of venues from local government to global negotiations and doing a lot of work nationally, and there are no permanent enemies and no permanent allies.\n\nYou have to take each of these opportunities from where you are at the time and be really cold-eyed about what are the barriers today, and how we can bridge some of those places of resistance and opposition. We need to either find a way to work through them, or work around them. For example with this curb management thing, some of that can be facilitated by implementing the 21st-century technologies of curb management, and some of it will also take management command structures of the NYPD being used to say to lowly traffic enforcement agents, \"We need you to do your job.\" That\u2019s something that can be done in the kind of military style of organization that the NYPD is, and hence I have some sense of optimism that within the next administration, this is a problem that can be addressed, and it will make the city a much better place to live in.\n\nKuntzman: As you leave, is there some project that you just wish you had gotten done, that you haven't during your tenure? Or maybe there\u2019s more than one?\n\nReplogle: There is more than one. I would\u2019ve loved to see us build some high capacity bike parking at major transit facilities. As Port Authority Bus Terminal, Penn Station, and other facilities get modernized and rebuilt, the city needs to exert strong leadership to insist that we have to have 5,000 or 10,000 bicycle parking stations in those places so that people can use bikes, leave them overnight, or go from the station to a nearby job or employment, so we can relieve overcrowding in the subway system. We also need better high capacity secure bike parking at some of the outer stations, at the edge of transit deserts in the outer boroughs, because there\u2019s more to be done to provide equitable access for people who don\u2019t have cars or can\u2019t afford cars but often are dependent on them because the transit isn\u2019t as good as it needs to be to get them where they need to go.\n\nI think there are opportunities to expand the use of pedal-assist electric bikes, and e-cargo bikes, and we\u2019re making some really promising progress on that. It has taken longer to get to a place of progress because we had to change the state law to legalize the e-bikes in the first place, but now that we\u2019ve gotten past that, I think we\u2019re seeing some changes there, and hopefully we get some further legislation in the Senate in Albany on legislation of wider e-cargo bikes passed in the next couple of weeks, which will really open up that whole sector.\n\nI think that we could replace 10-15 percent of all trucks in Manhattan within the next several years with pedal assist e-cargo bikes, and it would do wonders for congestion, noise, and air pollution, as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These are opportunities that we\u2019ve demonstrated, and our e-cargo bike program is showing that we get a one-to-one reduction of truck miles for e-cargo bike miles when we substitute, when they\u2019re substituted by the private sector.\n\nKuntzman: Yeah, but more cargo bikes means that we're going to come back to you for wider bike lanes because presumably if you replace a lot of those trucks with cargo bikes, you can repurpose the roads a little bit.\n\nReplogle: We need more bike lanes, wider bike lanes, and more bus priority across the city, without a doubt, and I\u2019m very proud of what we did with 14th Street, and I\u2019m very heartened that we\u2019re going to be developing many more bus rapid transit quarters like that in the future.\n\nHonestly, we should be focusing our bus priority measures most especially on the places where the most bus riders suffer the most congestion and delay, even though those are the hardest places to put these, because they create obviously the greatest potential backlash in terms of other traffic displacement. But those are the places where you get the biggest bang for the buck. And that counts really more than the number of miles of the busway, which everyone tends to fixate on.\n\nKuntzman: Well that\u2019s true. Finally, I\u2019m going to play the Devil\u2019s Advocate: I\u2019m asking on behalf of the people who don\u2019t like what you do. You\u2019ve been in the middle of Vision Zero for a long time, and Vision Zero is a signature initiative of the de Blasio administration, and we at Streetsblog and the street advocacies community have obviously covered very closely the successes of it. But we\u2019re not at zero, which means that we're constantly hearing that inane frustration from car drivers, car owners, car enablers in the council who say, \"Well you\u2019ve just waged this war on cars, and you didn\u2019t even get to zero; in fact you got to about 200 and now its ticking up again, and you\u2019re cutting the speed limits, cutting the places we can drive, and now you want to give more of our space to restaurants, and culture, and pedestrians, and you didn\u2019t even get to zero.\" What\u2019s the best pushback to that attitude that Vision Zero was a failure?\n\nReplogle: Well I think the best pushback is that seven out of the last eight years have been the safest on record in NYC, we\u2019ve cut pedestrian deaths by a third since the pre-Vision Zero era while the rest of the country pedestrian deaths are up by 30 percent or 40 percent. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve seen changes in vehicle design: a lot more utility vehicles and trucks that have higher grills that are more fatal. They hit pedestrians and vulnerable road-users, and since COVID hit, we\u2019re seeing a lot more highly irresponsible aggressive and fast driving, which is deadly. That\u2019s what accounts for most of the rise in vehicle deaths that we\u2019ve seen in the last year.\n\nSo is the answer to stop what has reduced our pedestrian deaths and traffic deaths compared to the rest of the country? No! The answer is to do what we\u2019ve been doing more effectively, like increasing the hours we can operate our speed cameras, putting them in more places, doing more automated enforcement and reducing speed limits where that makes sense, and pressing the federal government to be a better partner, by insisting on safer vehicle design."}, {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/5/1323", "page_content": "In this study, we designed a model to evaluate the substitution of shared bicycle usage on public transit using the operating data of shared schemes and transit data. In a case study, data from 2016 and 2017 were employed to evaluate the influence of bicycle sharing on the public transit system in Beijing. The findings hopefully may explain how bicycle-sharing schemes should be regulated in the future. The organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2 presents a literature review. Section 3 introduces the methodology employed, followed by the data description in Section 4 Section 5 presents the results, and Section 6 presents the research conclusions and discussions.\n\nThe main advantages of a bicycle-sharing system are the low-cost, flexible mobility, and capability to alleviate the urban traffic congestion problem [ 4 ]. Bicycling is a non-motorized and low-emission transport mode. The wide use of cycling can reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions, thus improving the urban environment [ 5 ]. The bicycle-sharing system is revolutionizing urban transportation systems and mobility modes [ 6 ]. Furthermore, urban residents enjoy riding shared bicycles for short commutes, tourism, and exercise [ 5 ]. In the last few years, millions of shared bicycles purchased by companies have quickly flooded into urban areas; therefore, how and to what extent the shared-bicycle system will influence existing public transit systems has become a concern for researchers [ 7 ]. How to manage and distribute shared bicycles in urban areas is a challenging problem for city governments and planners, if they do not know the potential impacts of shared bicycles on existing public transits [ 8 ]. The distribution and usage of shared bicycles require guidance from both urban planners and traffic management departments; however, they first need to understand the competitive and cooperative interactions between shared bicycles and public transit systems, especially how shared bicycles affect public transit usage [ 9 ]. Because the upsurge in shared bicycles in cities has been a new phenomenon in the last few years, the influences of shared bicycles on the public transit system are not clearly defined in existing studies [ 10 ]. As such, analysis concerning the substitution of shared bicycles in public transit would be helpful to policy-makers in city governments, as well as bicycle companies.\n\nBicycling is encouraged for urban sustainability, public health, and traffic congestion alleviation [ 1 ]. However, a method to evaluate the influences of shared bicycles on public transit is very important for urban and transport planners. This study aimed to investigate the competition and cooperation between bicycle-sharing and public transit, using Beijing as a case study. A bicycle-sharing system is a service through which bicycles are publicly accessible for shared use to individuals on a short-term basis for a small charge, and it has become popular in cities all over the world [ 2 ]. With the emergence of bicycle-sharing in China in 2014, the market has been flourishing since July 2016 (led by companies like Ofo and Mobike). There has seen a substantial rise in bicycle use with significant influences on urban transportation [ 3 ]. In 2017, the number of shared bicycle users reached 70 million in China (Source: AVIC Securities, 2017).\n\nWith respect to the study methods, comparison methods are usually made between bicycle usages in different conditions [ 24 ]. Saberi et al. (2018) conducted a study on the impact of public transit disruption on bicycle-sharing mobility patterns using bicycling data from a tube strike that occurred in London, and they adopted a combined geo-statistical approach to explore the mobility patterns of bicycle-sharing interactions with public transit [ 18 ]. Zhao et al. (2018) surveyed 307 bicycle users to probe how the cyclists would shift to transit in Beijing where air pollution was thought to be a problem [ 25 ]. Shared bicycle ridership and public transit activities are seldom compared from an accurate spatial perspective. Data mining on both bicycling and transit data are rare; most studies are based on bicycling data only.\n\nSome studies use survey data that are limited in scale; few studies use the operating data of large-scale share schemes [ 19 ]. Shared bicycles are usually tracked by scheme operators, and the data collected by the operators have generated new study material for urban researchers and planners [ 20 ], especially in cities where bicycle-sharing schemes have attracted increased attention [ 21 ]. Studies on shared bicycles were usually difficult owing to poor accessibility to operating data [ 22 ], and studies on bicycle\u2013transit integration are more difficult when combining cycling and transit data because of different user identifications [ 23 ]. Although some researchers have recognized that travel distance is a key element for the traveler when choosing a transport mode, the threshold distance between bicycling and public transit service remains uncertain owing to limited data access [ 2 ].\n\nIn general, the reasons behind the competitive and cooperative influences of shared bicycles on public transit systems are not explored with consideration for travel distances. The statistics on travel distances between the two modes, transit distance changes, and transfer distances have not been examined thoroughly. Service distance histograms of transits and bicycling were seldom used in evaluating the potential effects of bicycling on public transit. Furthermore, most of the studies reported that bicycling distances were short without providing detailed differences between route distances and OD (origin\u2013destination) distances.\n\nExisting studies focus too much on the overall influences of bicycle usage on public transit, neglecting the differences owing to short distance and long distance transits. In addition to solving the first-and-last-mile problem, bicycling may also assume a positive role in connecting transit activities. The role of connecting transits is generally omitted in studies on shared bicycles [ 15 ]. Bus and metro transits are often not considered as an integrated transit system in existing research [ 3 15 ], making it difficult to evaluate whether bicycling is helpful in connecting transits between bus and metro lines.\n\nPrevious studies of bicycle sharing addressed the influence of bicycles on transit ridership; however, the conclusions regarding whether the influences are positive or negative were controversial. The positive roles that shared bicycles have in complementing public transit systems were noticed by some researchers. J\u00e4ppinen et al. (2013) believed that bicycles would increase public transit [ 11 ], and Wang et al. (2013) argued that bicycle sharing schemes potentially increased transit use for improved transit facilities by solving the first-and-last-mile problem [ 15 ]. Gordon-Koven et al. (2014) suggested that dense bicycle-sharing networks influenced citizens to substitute bicycling for public transit [ 16 ], and Campbell et al. (2017) found that every bicycle-sharing dock along New York bus routes was associated with a reduction in bus trips [ 17 ]. With respect to the relationship between bicycles and public transit systems, a disruption in London\u2019s tube service increased bicycle sharing trips by 85% and increased trip durations by 88% [ 18 ].\n\nGenerally, bicycling is perceived as a short- and medium-range travel mode, while public transit is a medium- and long-range travel mode. A bicycle-sharing system could be a substitute for a pre-existing public transport network, because an individual could use a shared bicycle instead of other public transit, and this kind of substitution would result in a loss of transit ridership [ 11 ]. A bicycle-sharing system could also be a complement to a pre-existing public transport network, as bicycling improves accessibility to public transit stops [ 11 ]. Midgley (2009) and Liu et al. (2012) argued that shared bicycles are parts or components of public transportation in urban areas [ 12 13 ], while Ma et al. (2015) perceived shared bicycles as complements to urban public transportation [ 4 ]. Furthermore, Replogle (1992) argued that benefits could be greater when bicycles and transit systems are better combined [ 14 ].\n\nAccordingly, r is a number within the range of [\u22121,1], and a higher r means a strong relationship between shared bicycle usage and a certain type of public transit activity. Similarly, R 2 is a number within the range of [0,1], and a higher R 2 means higher reliability for the study approach.\n\nPublic transit systems with long, medium, and short service distances are affected differently by shared bicycle usage. If the shared bicycle usage has a spatial correlation with public transit ridership, the two are probably related. The Pearson product\u2013moment correlation coefficients () are calculated between short transit traffic changes and shared bicycle usage to evaluate the relationship between shared bicycle usage and transits. The correlation coefficient) is the measurement of how the two types of traffic are related to each other. The formula for) is:whereis the covariance, andandare the standard deviations ofandThe relationship betweenandis calculated bywhereis the number of gridded areas,is the shared bicycle usage in cell area number, andis the public transit numbers in cell area number\n\nThe number of bicycling riderships constitute an array= [] ( Figure 3 a). Likewise, the transit ridership counts in the cell areascould form an array= [] ( Figure 3 b). Shared bicycle changes in the cell areas are compared with the public transit changes.\n\nIn this mechanism, the grids are not perfect rectangles because the earth is a sphere. Theof a grid cell within the range of longitude \u2208[] and latitude \u2208[,] is calculated by the formula:where, andare the geographical latitudes and longitudes in radians of the grid boundaries, respectively, andis the radius of the earth. If a grid is small, the errorof the area of the grid can be approximated by:whereandare the latitude limits of the study area. In Beijing, for example, a grid of 1 km by 1 km has an error \ud835\udf00 = 0.0237, compared to a rectangle. In this situation, it is acceptable to consider grids based on latitudes and longitudes to be the same size as rectangles.\n\nIf ridership within certain OD distance intervals changes proportionally, it must be determined whether the change has a spatial relationship with shared bicycle usage. Hence, a spatial correlation mechanism was designed. Transit changes are projected into gridded cell areas to examine the spatial relationship between bicycle usage and transit changes. The transit changes include one-stop transit and transferring. The spatial distribution of shared bicycle usages is also projected onto gridded cell areas to examine the relationship between bicycle sharing and public transit usages. If the proportional change in transit ridership within certain OD distances is accompanied by a change in bicycle usage, then they are correlated. Bicycle usage probably resulted in changes to the transit OD distance and transfer distance. The study area is converted into gridded cell areas A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , \u2026 A n , with each cell area given an index number n . The counts of bicycling origins are projected into cell areas A n based on whether the latitudes and longitudes of the bicycling start points are located in areas A n .\n\nTransit trips with different OD distances might be affected differently by shared bicycles. A histogram-shifting method is designed to examine the influence of bicycle sharing on public transit service distances. The histogram method is an estimate of the probability distribution of the distances. Histograms are used to evaluate the distributions of transit OD distance in different distance intervals. Transit OD distances over 10 km are excluded because transit trips longer than that are less likely to be affected by bicycling. The range of 10 km is divided into 50 intervals, and then a count is taken of how many transits fall into each interval ( Figure 2 ). If the areaof the service distance distribution shifts more than a given criterion, the service of the public transit system is affected by certain factors. The area of shifting can be calculated by:where) and) are the distributions (histograms) of service distances. The area of\u2208[0,2], and lower numbers near 0 mean the service distance change is minimal, while higher numbers near 2 mean the service distance change is substantial. A criterion of 0.2 (10% of the maximum) is set as the threshold; namely, when the area of shifting is greater than 0.2, we consider that the transit OD distances are affected by certain factors. As shown in Figure 2 , the histograms of transit distances during period A and period B are to be compared, andis the probability of the transit trip distance. Period A could be a time when shared bicycle usage is low, and period B may be the time when shared bicycle usage is high. If the two lines overlap, the areais zero. When this happens, we know that the same proportion of transit riders travel in a certain distance range. If the two histograms do not overlap, we know that more people travel within trip distances of less than 4 km in time period B than those in period A, and more riders travel trip ranges between 4 and 7 km in time period B than period A.\n\nThe bicycling OD distance is the Euclidean distance between bicycling origin and destination, and the bicycling trip distances are the lengths of a real bicycling route. Because sometimes only bicycling OD data are available, the bicycling trip distances are simulated by the Google Maps Directions application program interface (API). The Google Maps Directions API is a service that calculates trip distances and travel durations between locations using a web service request. The mode of transport is specified to be bicycling. When a uniform resource locator (URL) contains OD latitudes and longitudes, the response is in JavaScript object notation (JSON) or extensible markup language (XML) format, and the element of \u201cdistance\u201d indicates the total meters covered by the bicycling route. The differences between bicycling OD distances and bicycling trip distances are used to measure the potential effects of shared bicycles on public transits. It is speculated that both shared bicycles trip distances and OD distances are short compared to public transit trips.\n\nThe distances are calculated by the geographical latitudes and longitudes of the OD pairs, and thebetween point A and point B is calculated by the haversine formula:where, andare the geographical latitudes and longitudes in radians of point A and point B, \u0394is the absolute differences betweenand, andis the radius of the Earth.\n\nTo explain the first three distances, Figure 1 shows a transit from point A to point B in a single line, and another trip from point C to F comprises two single transits via two transit lines. The distance between A and B is the transit OD distance, and is the distance between C and D, and E and F. The transit OD distance is the Euclidean distance between a boarding station and an alighting station. If a transit rider exits the transit line at the next stop, the transit OD distance is called a one-stop transit distance. One-stop transit distances need to be examined to evaluate their vulnerability to be replaced by bicycles. There might be competition between one-stop transits and shared bicycle usage. Cooperation between shared bicycles and public transits might also occur in transit transferring when individuals exit the transit system and use shared bicycles to travel to another transit line, like the connection between points D and E in Figure 1 . The distance between D and E is the transfer distance. Smartcard records could be used to monitor transfers when the transit riders exit and return to the transit system. It should be noticed that transferring not only includes intended transferring between transit lines, it also includes situations where riders finish their travel activities after making a transit to point D, and then exit at point E through transit systems. Transfer distances need to be examined because there are areas where shared bicycles could interact with public transit systems in a cooperative manner.\n\nAs mentioned in Section 2.2 , the interaction between shared bicycles and public transit systems might depend on differences in travel distances. Bicycling and transit travel distances are key study objectives in this paper. This paper refers to five different distances as follows:\n\nBicycling data comprise a sample randomly selected from the entire database; therefore, spatial distribution and service distance statistics are not affected by the sampling method. When the data is visualized, bus stops and metro stations are much more evenly distributed than the bicycling start points ( Figure 4 a). In the center areas, shared bicycles show patterns similar to transit access points ( Figure 4 b).\n\nUrban areas in Beijing (as shown in Figure 4 ) are selected as the main study areas. To make the results significant, rural areas are excluded, because approximately 95% of the transit traffic is located within the range of longitude \u2208[116.1,116.8] and latitude \u2208[39.6,40.3]. The study area was divided into 400 gridded cell zones, generating arrays= []. Each grid was approximately 3.5 \u00d7 3.5 km in dimension.\n\nBy the end of 2017, roughly 2.35 million shared bicycles from 15 companies were in service in Beijing (source: www.xinhuanet.com ). Mobike and Ofo were believed to be the top three largest bicycle-sharing companies by the year 2017 (source: fortune.com ), and the two companies shared 31% overlapped users (source: www.questmobile.com.cn ) at the beginning of 2017. The top companies might share far more users by the end of 2017 than other competitors. Shared electric bicycles also emerged in 2017, but they are not considered due to their small number. The randomly sampled bicycling daily log of 15 November 2017 is provided by the Ofo company, and each record contains the starting time and starting location, as well as the ending time and ending location. Altogether, 20,000 bicycling records were used in this study in the same area as transit data, and these records were randomly selected from the total dataset. It is important to note that the market share of the bicycle-sharing companies is presumed to be equal in geographical distribution such that the sample data represent the overall shared bicycle usage in Beijing. The number of riders using a shared bicycle in mid-2016 was substantially smaller compared to that in 2017; hence, the increase of shared bicycle usage could be approximately represented by bicycle usage at the end of 2017.\n\nThe smart card data used in this study include metro and bus transit logs from Beijing\u2019s public transport system. Transit data from the 24th week in 2016 and the 33rd week in 2017 were used, and the transit datasets included boarding stations, boarding time, alighting stations, alighting time. By the end of 2016, there were over 1020 bus lines and 19 subway lines in Beijing, with more than 20,000 bus stops and 345 subway stations (source: www.bjbus.com www.bjsubway.com ). Metro transits and bus transits were treated as equal transits in this paper. Daily bus transit volume or daily metro transit volume is approximately 10 million on a typical working day. The Beijing Municipal Administration and Communication Card (commonly known as the Yikatong, literally one-card pass) is the only type of smart card used in Beijing\u2019s public transport system. The smart card can be used in the bus and metro systems in Beijing. Although passengers can buy the card anonymously, each card has a unique identification number. As such, we could track the travel information of individuals in Beijing\u2019s public transport system and then calculate the user\u2019s transit OD distances and transit transfer distances.\n\nThe high correlation was explored among X , Y, and Z , with corr ( X , Y ) = 0.8326 (p = 0.001), corr ( X , Z ) = 0.7768 ( p = 0.001), and corr ( Y , Z ) = 0.7171 ( p = 0.001). The more shared bicycle usage in one cell area, the more short public transits is reduced in that cell area. In addition, more shared bicycle usage was also found to be associated with more public transit re-entries for travel less than 2 km. That is to say, more people might use shared bicycles when connecting with public transits.\n\nThe results in Section 5.3 suggest that connections between shared bicycle usage, one-stop transits, and short transfers (within 2 km) need to be further examined utilizing a spatial correlation method. The three types of events (shared bicycle usage, one-stop transits, and short transfers) were projected into 400 cell areas according to a method in Section 3.3 . The array= [] was used to represent shared bicycle usage in 2017. The array= [] was used to represent short public transit reduction, while the array= [] was used to represent transfers within distances less than 2 km. When the arrays were calculated and visualized, each had similar spatial distributions. Figure 8 a\u2013c showed the spatial distribution of shared bicycle usage, short transit reduction, and short transfers increase respectively. Although some inconsistencies exist, overall there was a higher distribution of events in central urban zones than in surrounding areas.\n\nDetailed data showed that when the 33rd week of 2016 and the 24th week of 2017 were compared using short transit volumes (one-stop transits), daily short transits dropped from 775,000 to 691,000 on average and short transfers increased from 133,000 to 149,000 on average. The results in Section 5.2 showed the possibility that the usage of shared bicycles might have reduced short public transit ridership and increased public transit connections with displacements of less than 2 km. When transits with distances longer than 10 km were included, the results were similar. Long transits were found to be less likely to be affected by shared bicycles. Further examination could be carried out to measure the interaction of bicycling usage and transit activity changes.\n\nThe histograms of transit trip distances show that trip distances less than 2 km decreased; however, trips ranging from 2\u20136 km increased ( Figure 7 ). The histograms of transit distances show more riders re-enter the transit system if the displacement is less than 2 km. The output offor transit trip distances on a typical working day in 2017 is 0.3397 ( Figure 6 a), and the transfer histogram shift changeis 0.1182 ( Figure 6 b). Bothare notably larger than the average number calculated from the daily data collected for a week in 2016 (avg() = 0.005). Thus, the public transit service changed in both trip distance and connecting distance over this period. What is the cause of this phenomenon?\n\nThe detailed results show (1) most one-stop transits in Beijing were less than 2 km; (2) half of the public transit transfers were within displacements less than 2 km away; (3) approximately 85% of the bicycling distances were less than 2 km. The travel distances of shared bicycles are rather short; therefore, the possibility of riding shared bicycles as a substitute for long transit is low while the possibility of riding shared bicycles as a substitute for short transit is high. This was a reduction of one-stop transits as shared bicycle usage surged. There is also a great potential of cooperation between sharing bicycles and transit systems, for the results support the assumption that public transit riders using shared bicycles to substitute walking between transit stops.\n\nPublic transit smart card data and bicycling data collected on 15 November 2017 were used to develop histograms relating to service distances. One-stop transit distances, transfer transits, bicycling trip distances, and bicycling OD distances were counted and visualized with histograms. The histogram of one-stop transits shows that most one-stop trips are less than 2 km ( Figure 6 a). The statistics of transit riders travel distances between transits in public transit systems indicate that most people transfer within distances of 2 km ( Figure 6 b). The histograms indicate that most one-stop transits are less than 2 km ( Figure 6 c), and most bicyclists travel to destinations within 2 km of their origins ( Figure 6 d). It was also found that histograms of trip durations were similar to distance histograms. So it was reasonable use only distance information of the data to investigate interaction between bicycling and transits.\n\nThe volume of shared bicycle usages most likely underwent the same increase as the number of active users, although we do not have the usage data that directly show how shared bicycle usage has increased over the period from June 2016 to May 2017. In this case study, the usage of shared bicycles has not likely reduced public transit ridership.\n\nOverall, the public transit traffic volumes in Beijing were relatively stable from 2016 to 2017. A sharp drop in transit volume in the 4th and 5th week was due to the Chinese lunar new year holidays. Bus transits and metro transits were equally processed, and they totaled the overall daily transit traffic volumes. In most weeks, transit volumes were moderately higher in 2017 than 2016 ( Figure 5 a), with a dramatic increase of active shared bicycle users ( Figure 5 b).\n\n6. Conclusions and Discussion\n\nThe results show that: (1) the usage of shared bicycles did not result in a reduction in overall transit ridership volume; (2) however, transit ridership volumes for short distances, especially within 2 km, decreased while transfers within 2 km increased with the rise in shared bicycle usage; and (3) the decrease of short transits and increase of near transit transfers were highly correlated to the geographical distribution of shared bicycles\n\nBoth cooperation and competition exist between shared bicycles and public transit systems. We need not be too concerned about the negative effects of shared bicycles on public transit ridership. While the use of shared bicycles may not cause an overall reduction in public transit, only short transit volume may be reduced. Researchers and regulators should not neglect that shared bicycles might also have a potentially significant role in connecting public transits. Policymakers could take advantage of this potential for improving existing public transport systems.\n\nFurther study is needed to investigate how bicycle-sharing systems influence travel behaviors, because the methods in this study are rather uncomplicated and lack onsite surveys. However, we believe our findings could provide urban planners and public transit policymakers with useful information for future transportation planning decisions. A better understanding of the relationship between sharing bicycles and traditional public transport systems will help to create more integrated transportation systems and enrich our cities.\n\nThe results of this study also provide useful information for urban sustainability: public transit systems in metropolitan cities such as Beijing are not sufficiently pedestrian friendly, because a good proportion of transfer distances are much longer than bicycling distances; there should be a strong need to complement the transit system by providing adequate bicycling services at public transit access points and sectors where public transit and bicycle-sharing schemes could work together to make both transport modes appealing. To avoid conflicts between the two transport modes, attention should also be paid to the negative influences of shared bicycles, such as transit access points flooded by shared bicycles."}, {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/4/1299", "page_content": "1. Introduction\n\n5, In recent years, bike-sharing has grown significantly in many Chinese cities, as it caters to the public transport policies of convenience, sustainability, and energy saving [ 1 2 ]. Essentially, bike-sharing is an oriented production-service system (PSS), whereby the ownership of bicycles is retained by providers (e.g., Ofo, Mobike, 99bicycle, and Wisdom-Enjoyed Cycling) who sell the functions of the bikes. Bike-sharing has benefits for short-distance travel and connecting \u201cthe last kilometer\u201d in a given city [ 3 ], which is especially evident in the vicinity of rail transit stations. Bike-sharing is a convenient way for residents to travel, but it also suffers from some shortcomings, such as unreasonable bicycle parking and the failure to transfer bikes in time. Thus, a better understanding of the spatiotemporal characteristics of bike-sharing is needed and could provide management and operational support for enterprises and government departments [ 4 6 ]. Station service areas are especially interesting for their unique characteristics that affect bike-sharing usage.\n\n8,9,12,14,17, Studies on bike-sharing mainly focus on demand forecasting [ 7 10 ], pricing schemes [ 11 13 ], bike-sharing systems (BSS) [ 3 15 ], and spatiotemporal characteristics [ 16 18 ]. Demand forecasting, the preliminary work of bike-sharing, determines the number of shared bikes to some extent. Bike-sharing operation costs comprise the system operation, administration, marketing, and utility costs associated with hardwired stations. Pricing schemes are directly related to passenger flow and operation [ 11 ]. Bike-sharing systems (BSS) are a topic worth studying, especially in terms of user satisfaction [ 19 ], bike-sharing services [ 20 ], rebalancing operations [ 21 ], and the like. Compared with demand forecasting, pricing schemes, and BSS, the spatiotemporal characteristics of bike-sharing usage are fundamental to understand the operation and management of bike-sharing services. While analyzing the interaction between bike-sharing and rail transit, we may also explore the influence of land-use attributes on bike-sharing usage in terms of transit-oriented development (TOD).\n\nThe passenger flow [ 1 ] and built environment [ 22 ] are important influences on the spatiotemporal characteristics of bike-sharing usage. The greater the passenger flow, the more shared bikes are used; however, the effects of passenger-flow volume have been rarely studied even though user attributes, travel characteristics, and user preferences have been frequently analyzed. Analysis of the user attributes (gender, age, income, car ownership, etc.) related to bike-sharing was necessary to understand travel demands and improve customer satisfaction [ 23 ]. The travel characteristics (travel time, travel distance, travel purpose, etc.) of bike-sharing are of great importance in terms of demand forecasting and the planning of bike-sharing operations. Giving full consideration to user preferences could effectively increase operation costs.\n\nIn regard to the built environment, Tran et al. analyzed the factors influencing the usage flow of a bike-sharing system in Lyon, France, and found that the network density of bike-sharing and the station capacity were plausibly correlated to the bike-sharing usage [ 24 ]. Mateo-Babiano et al. analyzed Brisbane\u2019s CityCycle scheme in Australia [ 25 ]. Inner-city stations near to off-road infrastructure saw the most active bike-sharing usage, with CityCycle more heavily used on weekends for recreational purposes. From the survey data of 90 randomly selected residents, the bicycle fare, existence of separated bicycle lane, bicycle quality, pavement quality, proximity of bicycle stations to bus stops, bicycle training programs, and gender and employment statuses of the respondents significantly influenced public preferences regarding BSS in Mashhad [ 26 ]. Bike-sharing linked to the bus rapid transit system played an important role, and minor changes could improve their multimodality [ 27 ]. Bike-sharing affected the built transportation system [ 27 ]. However, the built transportation system also affected bike-sharing usage. Wang et al. analyzed the effects of nearby businesses and jobs on trips to and from stations using bike-sharing [ 28 ]. Bike-sharing programs were, theoretically, best suited to locations with higher population densities and more destinations that could be easily accessed. Built-environment variables, including station attributes and accessibility, cycling infrastructure, public transport facilities, and land-use characteristics, were all considered in analyzing the spatial correlations of bike-sharing usage between nearby stations [ 29 ].\n\nClearly, few previous studies have analyzed the spatiotemporal characteristics of bike-sharing usage in terms of passenger flow and the built environment. Rail transit stations are an important part of urban transportation, and the unique characteristics of their service areas impact on bike-sharing usage. This paper aims to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of bike-sharing usage around rail transit stations using data from Beijing, China. Specifically, the contributions of this work can be summarized as follows: (i) on the basis of analysis of the influencing factors, a geographic weighted regression (GWR) model is built to capture the particular spatiotemporal characteristics of bike-sharing usage around rail transit stations considering the variables of passenger flow and the built environment; (ii) referring to bike-sharing in Beijing, China as a case study, we analyze the influence of the passenger flow into and out of the stations, land use, bus lines, and road-network characteristics on the bike-sharing usage in terms of time and space."}, {"url": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Linking_Bicycle_pedestrian_Facilities_wi.html?id=AFhPAAAAMAAJ", "page_content": "About 40 percent of Americans own bicycles, and many of these people live one-quarter mile to two miles away from express transit stops.

The current proposal is focussed towards improving the efficiency of city\u2019s bus transport system. The new proposal also takes into consideration the alternative modes used by people in order to form a coherent system. The service proposes the use of one master card for every transportation option like the bike, bus, water taxi, public Car2Go services. This is an effort to encourage citizens to use the different transportation modes without worrying about the logistics. Another aspect of the proposal would be to incorporate all the infrastructure needs, of the different transportation modes, within the urban planning proposal. The Oakland expansion plan would be designed to include broad pedestrian walkways, bike lanes, one lane for the buses, dedicated parking areas and the appropriate street furniture like the bus shelters, bike parking racks, benches, dustbins, parking ticket dispensers, pedestrian lights, planters etc. The plan is to build better amenities that supports community and economic development.\n\nExpanded BRT options: one aspect of our transition design proposal, which builds upon existing proposals.\n\nHypothetical Project Profile\n\nThis project is attempting to solve the issue of lack of access to public transportation. Specifically, this project is attempting to reimagine the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system to include alternative fuels and modes of transport, such as biking and walking, through a cohesive system and payment structure. While efforts have been made to improve and expand the BRT system over the past thirty years, this project attempts to expand efforts from a holistic and ecological viewpoint.\n\nProject Sector\n\nTransport\n\nPolicy/Leadership\n\nEnergy\n\nShared amenities\n\nEconomics/development\n\nAreas of Design Focus\n\nService\n\nSocial Innovation\n\nProduct\n\nUrban Planning\n\nLandscape\n\nLevel(s) of Spatial Scale\n\nWhile prior BRT expansion efforts have attempted to connect suburban areas with downtown areas, this project aims to connect inner-city neighborhoods with one another.\n\nNeighborhood\n\nCity\n\nTemporal Scale\n\nAs the current BRT system has existed and been improved upon for fifty years, this project also intends to exist for at least 50 years. A timeline with specific phases will not be able to be developed until funding is secured. While realistically it may take longer to secure funding and logistics, the goal and intention of the Pittsburgh community is to complete the project by 2020.\n\nVision and Lifestyle\n\nThe vision for this proposal is to build infrastructure that supports economically viable and sustainable futures. The development is focused on promoting the use of public transportation as well as providing infrastructure for bikes and pedestrians that would lead to environment-friendly options of travel. The goal is to promote healthier lifestyles by giving people ample options to chose from and supporting seamless connections in the cities for ease. The Oakland expansion is currently planned only between Oakland and downtown areas. Even though the intention is to reduce the travel time of users by 10\u201325 mins, we argue that it would lead to some chaos, since the users are required to change buses at the end stations to be able to reach the residential areas beyond Oakland. Thus, we propose that the plan be revisited and envision the connection between commercial areas of Oakland and downtown and the residential areas happen in the first phase itself. We propose this to enhance the experience of the users and the plan would support the seamless connection to achieve that. We also propose the inclusion of pedestrian walkways and bike lanes within the urban design plan to encourage more users to walk and bike, thereby not only promoting a healthy lifestyle, but, also making the public areas more safe and appreciable to use. We respect the permanency of such infrastructures and expect the plan to last for more than 50 years, thus, it is important to carefully analyze the needs of the users and reflect inclusiveness in the plan.\n\nTheories of Change\n\nBus Rapid Transport, often called \u201clight rail on wheels,\u201d use buses that often operate in a dedicated lane and make fewer stops than regular buses. This approach to urban development through public transportation planning is more cost-effective to the city in its design, installation and maintenance. The overall goal of the new BRT proposal, which seeks to link Oakland with downtown Pittsburgh, shares the same goal as the original 1977 BRT proposal, urban sustainability.\n\nOfficials are hoping that connecting residents of less-developed neighborhoods to jobs in Oakland and downtown and to grocery stores and shopping in the East End will galvanize neighborhoods often overlooked when it comes to urban redevelopment projects. Connecting neighborhoods that have been isolated for about 50 years back to the necessities any person would need. Officials add, the system would also benefit college students who don\u2019t have cars.\n\nAn illustration of the proposed BRT station, via the Tribune-Review.\n\nThe goal of the new BRT plan, with it\u2019s two branch extensions into the neighborhoods of Squirrel Hill and Highland Park, is to connect riders with 24 neighborhoods throughout Pittsburgh, increasing route efficiency and fare transfers with other bus routes, and reducing travel time by 18% for the roughly 44,000 annual riders along the affected routes.\n\nA future vision of a BRT stop, via the Tribune-Review.\n\nOfficials hope riders will preference city buses over cars when it comes to commuting. They hope to entice ridership through the new route \u201calignment,\u201d which includes: wider sidewalks along Forbes ave, better bike infrastructure, transit exposure for businesses, priority signals for buses & maximizing flow and reducing confusion when it comes to traffic patterns.\n\nPlace-Based, Integrated Satisfiers\n\nThe existing BRT system, busways, is mainly associated with the need of subsistence and freedom, from Max Neef\u2019s fundamental human needs, by providing a better mobility as an integrated satisfier for suburban residents of Pittsburgh. On the other hand, the new BRT extension would satisfy the needs of participation and protection by connecting different neighborhoods inside of the city with multi-modal transportation options. The new system will decrease the appeal for cars as well as raise the appeal for public transportation and alternative transport, such as biking and walking. Clean, safe, and slow-speed streets would imbue a pedestrian-favorable atmosphere around the city eventually, which will allow dwellers to interact with communities more. These different approaches to each system would be derived from place-based design. The city seems to understand the needs and problems of different parts of city.\n\nLeveraging Under-Utilized Resources\n\nThe proposed new \u201cbus rapid transit\u201d path to connect Oakland with downtown is an innovative project which has long been planned and discussed. The latest iteration seeks to develop dedicated bus lanes by converting existing local bus and parking lanes. Bike lanes would also be added in existing parking lanes, while improving sidewalks, crosswalks, lighting and trees would also be installed into the overall design. This proposal seeks to be as efficient and cost-effective as possible for the city and its residents. The most practical plan \u201caligning\u201d current traffic flows on Forbes and Fifth avenues with dedicated bus lanes. Identifying this scheme as allowing for \u201cintuitive circulation\u201d as \u201call modes flow in the same direction\u201d in relation to traffic patterns.\n\nThe city\u2019s approach to lean urban development is nothing new for Pittsburgh. In 1964 they acquired the Pittsburgh Railways Company and their infrastructure throughout the city. In 1977, the Port Authority launched the first BRT system in the country. They did this not by adding to old city roads, but identifying and developing underutilized city resources. Removing most of the defunct rail lines, they converted the reclaimed space to dedicated bus lanes.\n\nThe new BRT proposal carries on this lean legacy, seeking to develop \u201cbranch\u201d routes where buses along this path would not have their own lanes, but at key intersections the BRT buses would have priority to get through lights before regular traffic. The new BRT proposal is a system which leverages under-utilized city resources.\n\nEmergent Products, Services, and Outcomes\n\nThe new BRT extension would rise the general attractiveness of public transportation over driving cars. Less cars would in turn lead a different use of parking lot around the city. They might turn into a commercial space, public playgrounds, or a public garden. In addition, the implement of bike lanes and wider sidewalks would also increase the appeal and actual use of these transportation modes by ensuring safety and hospitality. This might bring more residents out and explore the city at a slow speed. On top of that, less noise and less pollution resulted from less cars would encourage people to come out even more. With these potential results, we might be able to anticipate outcomes outside of public transportation sector; revitalized local business from an alley to an alley and increase of general public health. To be specific, local businesses, such as bike repair shops which can also act as bicycle-advocates community or a sidewalk cafe/restaurant, might emerge in the context.\n\nRestoring and Strengthening Relationships\n\nThis solution seeks to connect and restore the relationships between people, the environment, and the \u2018designed\u2019 world by focusing on expanding access between neighborhoods and re-imagining existing infrastructure through an ecological lens. For instance, this BRT expansion would invest in electric buses, bike rentals, bike lanes, and larger, tree-lined sidewalks in order to harmonize with the local ecosystem by conserving resources and restoring trees. It would also seek to strengthen the social system in which it is embedded by connecting Downtown to Oakland as well as potential expansions to neighborhoods like Squirrel Hill and Shadyside. While existing bus route provide some connection between these neighborhoods, this BRT expansion would provide not only faster travel times but also increase the attractiveness of alternative transport options such as biking or walking. An all inclusive payment card would further increase the attractiveness of the system by making renting a bike as convenient, payment wise, as riding the bus.\n\nBarriers and Challenges\n\nThe most significant barriers and challenges to implementing a more integrated public transportation system are those that have always prevented such development in Pittsburgh. The number one barrier is the geography and city layout. Because of the narrow and windy roads, steep hills, and disjointed neighborhoods, it is difficult to dedicate road space to bus lanes or even bike lanes, and even more challenging to build additional infrastructure in an already crowded space.\n\nShifting mindsets towards prioritizing public services transportation is also a challenge. The Port Authority has always struggled with budgetary problems, causing them to increase fares and cut back on bus routes. With the arrival of tech giants like Google and Uber, there is a significant amount of development happening in Pittsburgh to meet their needs (such as Bakery Square development), but not as much investment in the services that serve the long-time residents of Pittsburgh. Our concern is that, with raising income levels, and because of the perception of public transportation in Pittsburgh being reserved for low-income populations, there will be little incentive to invest or improve upon this lagging system. Though plans for the Oakland-Downtown BRT are moving forward, the city will have to seek funding at the state and federal level, which may delay or even halt progress entirely.\n\nThough the convenience of cars may still be preferred to public transportation for errands such as grocery shopping, dry cleaning, or picking up children from school, a speedier, more efficient BRT system that better connects Pittsburgh\u2019s neighborhoods can help to significantly reduce traffic caused by commutes to college, work, or sporting and social events.\n\nScaling your Solution Spatio-temporally\n\nIn order to situate our solution on a timeline, we decided to use the Multi-Level Perspective model to show how each step relates to either niche, regime, or landscape developments. While many other niche, regime, and landscape developments not represented in our timeline may influence our solution, we decided to only represent those core to our solution in order to best show what interventions and smaller visions must precede it. We recognize that this model would need to be constantly iterated over time as projects are realized and as the vision evolves. We\u2019ve also included our original Multi-Level Perspective map, which provides a more cohesive look at the present day niche, regime, and landscape level developments.\n\nOverall, we have an ambitious timeline of securing state and federal funding by the end of this year (2017). We aim to complete construction of the Oakland BRT extension, complete with bike lanes, bike rentals, tree-lined pedestrian walkways, and the creation of a single fare card for all transport options by 2020, based on aspirations provided by the Pittsburgh Mayor in this Tribune-Review article. By 2020 we also think it would be feasible for the city of Pittsburgh to invest in a fleet of rent-by-the-minute smart cars (small, electrically-fueled cars meant for short distances), although the fleet would be small and server only a niche market. By 2025, however, we envision that these smart cars will become mainstream through additional investment in growing the fleet, alongside declining stigma against public transportation at the landscape level. Due to current Uber, Lyft, and local Jitney offerings, attitudes against car ownership will have become widespread by 2025 when the smart car fleet will be large enough to meet citywide demand. By this time, autonomous vehicles will have expanded in many different niche and mass market services. In addition, by 2030 and onwards, the BRT system will continue to grow to reach more neighborhoods, eventually serving the entire city and inspiring other cities to do the same."}, {"url": "https://www.marsdd.com/news/ride-sharing-the-rise-of-innovative-transportation-services/", "page_content": "This is part four in the MaRS Smart Transportation Market Insights, part of the Connected World Market Insights series.\n\nWhat will shape the future of transportation in urban cities? Some people think that ride-sharing will help to determine that answer. Ride-sharing, or shared mobility, is defined as an \u201cinnovative transportation strategy that enables users to gain short-term access to transportation modes on an as-needed basis.\u201d It can include various forms of transportation, such as car-sharing, bike-sharing, carpooling and platform-based ride services (e.g., Uber, Lyft, BlaBlaCar).\n\nHistorically, an individual could choose to move around an urban area in a variety of ways. New travel alternatives enabled by new technology and business models have provided individuals with even more choices. The convenience of requesting a ride from your phone, sharing a ride with a co-worker or grabbing a bike outside your home has helped to propel ride-sharing to the forefront of the sharing economy.\n\nPwC predicts that the five main sharing economy sectors, with transportation being one of the largest, will generate global revenues of $335 billion by 2025. This potential revenue will propel it to match revenues generated by the traditional retail sectors. According to Frost & Sullivan, transportation is one of the most promising sectors for investment opportunities.\n\nMcKinsey&Company predicts that vehicle ownership will move from being the dominant form of mobility to becoming a smaller piece of the transportation pie. This shift will force governments to regulate ride-sharing platforms, such as Uber, so that they can operate fairly in an industry previously monopolized by taxi companies. Cities must accept that ride-sharing is here to stay. Rather than fight ride-sharing, cities should look for ways to integrate new travel options into the current transit system and create a multimodal system. Real Tanguay, Auto Advisor to the Minister of Industry Canada and Minister of Ontario Economic Development, spoke to us about the future of mobility. He stated, \u201cThere [are] many different ways of moving people, and that\u2019s why we say the future of mobility could be quite different in India than it is in North America. It\u2019s a big question, and the answer is not so simple.\u201d\n\nRide-sharing is complex and can be a difficult concept to define. To simplify, companies working in this space can be categorized into two main groups based on their business models. The first group is platform-based ride-sharing: companies that coordinate rides through a platform, such as Uber, Lyft and BlaBlaCar. The second type is inventory-based ride-sharing: companies that own assets, like fleets of cars or bikes, that are shared among users, such as Bike Share Toronto, car2go and Zipcar.\n\nDigitizing mobility solutions with platform-based business models\n\nA digital platform-based business model creates value by connecting individuals or parties. These types of businesses are becoming more common through the evolution of the Internet, and many industries are moving toward platform-based models. Examples of well-known platforms include industry giants eBay, Amazon and Facebook. We\u2019re now seeing transportation startups such as Uber, Lyft and BlaBlaCar adopting this business model. According to Forrester, the digital platform companies that collectively make up the sharing economy represent a $100 billion market.\n\nCompanies are using platform-based business models to increase productivity and ensure the efficient use of their assets, while minimizing their capital expenditure. In fact, most platform-based businesses don\u2019t own the assets that are core to their businesses. This is exemplified through sharing economy companies such as Uber and Airbnb, which are taking advantage of the low personal use rates of cars and extra bedrooms, respectively. UCLA professor Donald Shoup estimated that cars sit unused and parked for 95% of the time.\n\nPlatform-based companies have some key advantages over traditional asset-owning businesses. For instance, platforms avoid much of the high upfront capital cost, which minimizes barriers to entry and allows rapid diversification of service offerings. For example, Apple is evolving its music store into a streaming service, while Uber is expanding to include food delivery through UberEats. Platform-based companies are also able to nimbly expand their operations to different geographies, which allows them to establish global brands almost immediately after launch.\n\nMark Boncheck and Sangeet Paul Choudary wrote an article for The Harvard Business Review that attributed this ability to three transformative technologies: cloud, social and mobile. The authors stated, \u201cThe cloud enables a global infrastructure for production, allowing anyone to create content and applications for a global audience. Social networks connect people globally\u2026 Mobile allows connection to this global infrastructure anytime, anywhere.\u201d Sanjeev Kapoor, Senior Project Manager at Ford Motor Company, stated the following during an interview: \u201cDigital transformation is across all the industries. These are good opportunities for startups. They can put efforts into developing something, say for connected cars, but they can easily customize that technology for other emerging or evolving industries.\u201d This increased adaptability and flexibility sets these businesses up for success.\n\nThe power of Uber\n\n\u201cTo bet against Uber is to bet against the future.\u201d \u2013 Paul Barter, Co-author of \u201cThe Uber of Everything\u201d and Professor at the Schulich School of Business\n\n\u201cIn a world where technology can deliver the ride you need within five minutes wherever you are in the world, just imagine all the goods and services you could one day get delivered quickly and safely, with just the single touch of a button.\u201d \u2013 Travis Kalanick, CEO, Uber\n\nAs of March 2016, Uber has expanded to 397 cities; in 2014, it was available in fewer than 100 cities. The company has nearly quadrupled its geographic footprint in two years. Frost & Sullivan predicts that Uber will be present in 500 cities by the end of 2016, with a current estimate of eight million users.\n\nDespite Uber\u2019s exponential growth, the company is currently the topic of political debate across the world. Some believe that Uber is unfairly taking market share away from incumbent taxi companies. Ipsos conducted a qualitative research consultation for the City of Toronto, wherein consumers described what they liked and disliked about Uber compared to taxis. While taxis are easier to hail, inconsistent payment methods, vehicle conditions, poor customer service, trust issues (such as the recent debit card scandal) and high prices have driven some customers to choose Uber. Frost & Sullivan identified the main reasons that customers use Uber, which include ease of payment (35%), short waiting time (30%), faster commute (30%) and ease of approach (21%). However, Ipsos found that consumers disliked Uber\u2019s unclear insurance policies, surge pricing, the inability to hail an Uber, and uncertainty about data security and safety issues.\n\nAs a company with no assets related to its core business, Uber might face a threat that is common to all platform-based services: a new platform that offers a superior service at a lower price. Regardless of Uber\u2019s global brand awareness and first mover advantage, it might not be immune to competitive threats. Big names have been wiped out in the past; just as Facebook displaced Myspace, it is possible for larger companies\u2014such as Google and Apple, which both have extremely flexible, adaptable and functional platforms\u2014to eventually move into the ride-sharing space. Sean Parker, former president of Facebook and co-founder of Napster, argued that Myspace\u2019s demise was due to its inability to evolve its product over time. He stated, \u201cThere was a period of time where if they had just copied Facebook rapidly, they would have been Facebook.\u201d It will be important for companies like Uber to continually develop their platforms to adapt to increasing competition.\n\nFrost & Sullivan expects Uber to grow at a CAGR of 28.9%, reaching over $42 billion in revenue by 2025. This growth not only derives from geographical expansion, but from the exploration of other services that can evolve from the app. We\u2019ve already seen Uber enter the food delivery market with UberEats and begin to explore the goods delivery market with UberRUSH. Paul Barter argues, \u201cYou think of Uber as a taxi disruptor now, but anything that moves from A to B\u2026 they can be in that business. When you want to predict the potential size of the Uber market, you don\u2019t just count up all the taxi businesses around the world \u2013 you count up anybody who provides services moving anything from A to B. Uber can enter all of those markets.\u201d\n\n\n\nDigital platform players Startups While Uber has not expanded into every possible market yet, other startups are exploring solutions to fill these market gaps. Convoy Convoy, the self-proclaimed \u201cUber of trucking\u201d company from Seattle, is one startup with big plans to disrupt the well-established trucking business. It uses an app-based platform to challenge the current call-centre dispatching process. Convoy is currently focusing on the short-haul trucking market. According to research firm IBISWorld, local freight trucking is a $40.5 billion market in the United States. IBISWorld also expects this industry to keep growing, as the post-recession increase in consumer confidence and spending keeps rising, which requires more goods transportation. Frost & Sullivan believes that this trend of mobile-based freight brokerage is here to stay, expecting the market to grow at a CAGR of 66% and generate $26.4 billion in revenue by 2025, up from $100 million in 2014. BlancRide Toronto startup BlancRide is making big waves with its carpooling app targeted at commuters. Its algorithm connects drivers with passengers who live in nearby neighbourhoods and work close to each other. Drivers can recoup some costs of operating their vehicles through in-app payments from passengers. This leads to shorter ride times as it allows commuters to use High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes. More commuters sharing vehicles also reduces their environmental footprint. BlancRide will also use its innovative platform to facilitate rides between employees at large companies who live near each other. We spoke with Hamid Akbari, CEO & Founder of BlancRide, and Joshua Fernandes, Community Development Specialist at BlancRide, about what they envisioned for the future of transportation. Read the full interview here. BlaBlaCar BlancRide\u2019s platform is similar to the European carpooling service BlaBlaCar, which is based in Paris. With 25 million members in 22 countries, BlaBlaCar has certainly made its presence known. It has also been a leader in addressing trust and safety concerns, with a \u201cLadies Only\u201d option, social media verification, two-way feedback and additional insurance for rides booked online. ecoRIDES Hamilton-based startup ecoRIDES has noticed a gap in the black-car market: a lack of environmentally friendly vehicles. The startup is bringing sustainable transportation options to executive customers with its app-based Tesla ride-sharing service. We spoke with Jason Guanzon, Founder of ecoRIDES, to learn more. Read the interview here. Corporations Large corporations are also starting to realize the impact of ride-sharing on the marketplace. We\u2019re seeing some big names developing plans to tap into this market, from tech giants to automobile OEMs. Tech giants, such as Facebook and Google in particular, have a head start in entering the platform-based ride-sharing market. Their advantage comes from immense resources in terms of cash and access to talent in the platform and developer communities. Facebook Facebook isn\u2019t sleeping while the ride-sharing trend takes off. In January, the $300 billion tech giant filed a patent application to integrate ride-sharing into its events feature. The plan is to have attendees specify whether they are \u201cgoing and driving\u201d or \u201cgoing and not driving.\u201d The patent also addresses the trust issues often associated with ride-sharing by allowing drivers to offer their spare seats to either strangers or just friends. The platform will use data from people\u2019s profiles, like their alma maters and interests, to better match passengers and compatible drivers. Similar to Uber, Facebook will then give the driver an optimized route. Google In 2013, Google acquired Waze, the popular navigation mobile app that uses crowd-sourced traffic data. The company has now built a foothold in the ride-sharing market with the spin-off app WazeRider (previously RideWith), which connects fellow commuters on similar routes. To help the driver recoup the partial costs of operating their vehicle, it charges the rider through the app. The payment is made by a credit card on file, similar to Uber. The pair can also communicate through the app and the rider can provide public feedback on the driver. The app is currently only available as a beta in Israel, though its presence in the Google Play Store suggests expansion in the near future. General Motors Co. Earlier this year, GM and Lyft announced the start of a new partnership. In January, GM invested $500 million USD in the ride-sharing company. More recently, it has been announced that GM will be offering Lyft drivers the use of GM vehicles for $99 USD a week. If drivers make more than 65 trips a week, access to the car will be free. The partners have hinted at further evolution of their relationship. Lyft stated, \u201cWe will work with GM to build a network of on-demand, autonomous vehicles that will make getting around more affordable, accessible and enjoyable. GM will also establish a series of national rental hubs where Lyft drivers can access short-term vehicles, unlocking new ways for people to earn money without having to own a car.\u201d\n\n\n\nRide-sharing brings trust and safety concerns\n\nStartups and large corporations have shown great support for the ride-sharing movement. The response from consumers on ride-sharing platforms has been vastly positive, as demonstrated by their tremendous global growth. However, there has been some pushback on important issues unique to platform-based services. Trust, in particular, has been one of the most concerning issues for both riders and drivers.\n\nAlmost anyone with a driver\u2019s license, registered vehicle and insurance can be an Uber driver if they pass the background check. However, most people don\u2019t trust just anyone. Pew Research says that 19% of Millennials believe that most people can be trusted, while 31% of GenXers felt the same; interestingly, Boomers were the most trusting at 40%.\n\nCompanies such as Uber, Lyft and BlancRide have all diligently tackled trust issues for drivers and passengers by implementing features such as two-way feedback. According to one study, 75% of people trust peer reviews, which have become the foundation for how individuals evaluate holiday destinations, restaurants, consumer goods and even people. This feedback system addresses many inherent trust issues of entering a stranger\u2019s car, and is very strict. For instance, if an Uber driver\u2019s rating drops below 4.6 out of 5, they are at risk of being deactivated. Companies have implemented other measures to enhance trust, such as social media verification and using Twilio to disguise drivers\u2019 phone numbers.\n\nAs previously mentioned, 75% of people trust peer reviews, but what about the other 25%? Ride-sharing incidents, including assault, sexual assault, rape and men harassing female drivers, have received a lot of online press. This has caused both riders and drivers to become skeptical of ride-sharing. Female drivers and riders have been on the receiving end of the abuse, bringing greater societal issues into the ride-sharing picture. Some companies, such as BlaBlaCar, have allowed female drivers and passengers to select other females to ease safety concerns. Other companies, such as Uber, have done the opposite by putting out sexist ad campaigns, which were quickly taken down. Regardless, it is clear that the current low number of female drivers (Uber 14%, Lyft 30% and Sidecar 40%) can be attributed to the perceived risk of being a driver. As one female driver recounts, it took over a week for Uber to reply to her complaint of being sexually assaulted by a male passenger, which caused her to quit driving for the company.\n\nSharing inventory to maximize efficiency\n\nCar-sharing\n\nPaul Barter, co-author of The Uber of Everything and Professor at the Schulich School of Business, describes the sharing model as the \u201chotel model.\u201d In contrast with platform service companies, players in the hotel model own inventory for consumers to share, similar to how a hotel has an inventory of rooms for guests. Car-sharing companies use one of two business models. The one-way model allows drivers to borrow a car and drop it off at a designated parking station in the area. The two-way model requires drivers to pay an hourly rate to use the vehicle and must return it to the same location from which they picked it up.\n\nThe major players operating in this space in the Greater Toronto Area include Enterprise CarShare (previously AutoShare), car2go and Zipcar. Of these companies, car2go is the only provider that offers one-way usage of its fleet. However, one-way models can encounter regulatory hurdles regarding parking vehicles on the street. Cities are concerned that public street parking might become overcrowded, especially around subway lines and shopping districts. Toronto has been slow to update its regulations to accommodate one-way car-sharing providers. car2go, which has been frustrated by this issue, recently gave its members permission to park on city streets without the city\u2019s approval. The company has assured its members that they will not be responsible for parking tickets as long as they follow car2go\u2019s parking guidelines.\n\nUsers have warmly welcomed car-sharing in Canada. The country has 20 car-sharing services with more than 336,000 members and more than 5,200 vehicles as of January 2015 \u2013 a member to vehicle ratio of 64:1. Between January 2014 and January 2015, car-sharing memberships grew by 50% in Canada, while membership rates dropped by 4% in the US.\n\nCollege students and young professionals constituted nearly 66% of the US car-sharing market\u2019s revenue in 2015. Zipcar, for example, currently offers its service at more than 300 schools across the US, while Enterprise CarShare is available at more than 125 colleges and universities. Figure 6 shows the breakdown of American car share users by age group.\n\n\n\nOEM players Car-sharing companies are disrupting the status quo for OEMs. Incumbents are beginning to adapt to the future of transportation. BMW BMW\u2019s car-sharing service, DriveNow, sees Millennials as a promising segment to target. Richard Steinberg, CEO of DriveNow at BMW, said, \u201cMillennials are not so much interested in spending their hard-earned money on buying a car. They\u2019re not interested in parking, insurance and vehicle acquisition. But they still have mobility needs. Public transit, Uber, all the various sharing tools are at their disposal\u2014but there [is no] personal mobility. So that\u2019s where we fit in.\u201d In 2012, the company initiated a pilot in San Francisco, offering on-demand, app-based transportation in BMW\u2019s fuel-efficient or electric models. BMW\u2019s service allows users to find a vehicle through the app, drive it where they need to go and then leave it anywhere when finished. While they are no longer operating in San Francisco, the service is providing rides in select European cities. Ford Motor Company In our previous post, The Connected Car, we discussed how OEMs are increasingly partnering with technology companies to improve their connectedness. Ford Motor Company is using these partnerships to enter the transportation services market. Earlier this year at the Detroit Auto Show, Ford announced a collaboration with IBM to pilot a platform to help drivers find free parking spaces and quicker routes using traffic data. However, this isn\u2019t the first time that we have seen Ford step into this market. Through its Dynamic Social Shuttle service, Ford has taken the concept of an app-based ride-sharing service to the next level. The company is using shuttle busses that can seat up to 10 passengers, in conjunction with a mobile app that riders can use to hail a ride when heading on similar routes. The service has already been tested in London and New York.\n\n\n\nBike-sharing\n\nIn 1965, the first bike-sharing program, Witte Fiesten, was established in Amsterdam. You can now find bike-sharing programs in major cities across the world. This growth is evidenced by the dramatic increase in cities adopting such programs. Looking back, in 2007 only 68 cities had bike-sharing programs but in 2015 that number increased to 850. Bike-sharing programs are growing in popularity as they provide access to a new travel option, one-way travel, and an active, enjoyable way to get around. Figure 7 shows the number of shared bikes within countries that have adopted bike-sharing programs. China leads the world by a wide margin. The first bike-sharing program opened in Hangzhou in May 2008. By 2015, there were 162 programs across the country. Today, China is being recognized globally for its commitment to sustainable transportation. The 2016 Sustainable Transport Award was awarded to the city of Yichang for \u201cexcellent leadership in sustainable transport reforms in bus rapid transit, transit-oriented development, cycling and parking.\u201d The city has improved bicycle conditions by adding 30 kilometres of bike paths as part of a planned 220-kilometre network. A Yichang bike-sharing program is slated to open in early 2016 and will be integrated with the bus rapid transit (BRT) system.\n\nBike-sharing programs have not been as quickly adopted in North America, as shown in Figure 7. In 2015, the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) reported that bicycle/electric bikes account for about 6% of urban trips worldwide. North American urban cycling accounts for only about 1% of the worldwide total. However, there is evidence that efforts are underway to grow the programs. The Government of Ontario created Metrolinx to improve the coordination and integration of all modes of transportation in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area.\n\nIn 2015, it was announced that Metrolinx would invest $4.9 million to double the size of Toronto\u2019s bike-sharing program. The primary goal was to make more bikes available at transit stations. Permission is currently being sought to expand the bike share network outside the city limits to connect with other programs across the region. Start the Cycle is a Hamilton-based non-profit organization that provides bike-sharing access to college and university campuses in its area. We spoke with Shiloh Covey about Start the Cycle\u2019s efforts to teach sustainable practices while on a student budget. Read the full profile here.\n\nThe rapid growth of bike-sharing programs, as well as experimentation with new technologies for bikes and their systems, demonstrate that there will be continued growth for this affordable transportation option. North American cities should emphasize integrating bike-sharing programs with transit systems. This type of forward thinking will place North America on the forefront of sustainable transportation.\n\nShifting the status quo of consumer behaviour\n\nPlatform-based ride-sharing\n\nOver the past few years, ride-sharing companies have grown their market share worldwide, and are having noticeable impacts on other industries. For example, in San Francisco, the taxi industry has suffered a 65% decrease in rides since Uber\u2019s arrival. Without a doubt, ride-sharing is changing how consumers interact with the taxi industry, but is it really disruptive? Clayton Christensen, the Harvard Business School professor who invented the term \u201cdisruptive technology,\u201d argues that companies like Uber are not all that disruptive. Christensen claims that for a company to qualify as disruptive, it must meet one of two criteria: it must either originate in a new market or first target the low-end market. Uber does not meet these criteria. Uber and similar ride-sharing companies have strategically entered an already flourishing taxi industry, and have attracted existing taxi users. As Christensen states, \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you develop a better, less expensive solution to a widespread customer need.\u201d\n\nThat is not to say that the platform-based business model will not change the status quo. For consumers, it has the potential to provide an all-in-one and on-demand platform at a lower cost, as seen in Figure 9. All transportation needs, such as food delivery, taxi services or courier services, can be streamlined and charged to a credit card using a single platform. While it might not be clear how drastically it will change peoples\u2019 livelihoods, customers seem to prefer using ride-sharing platforms over taking traditional taxis.\n\nWhether one classifies Uber as disruptive or not, it has definitely influenced consumer behaviour in the automotive industry. A CNBC survey revealed that 22% of Uber users aged 17 to 64 in the US were delaying the purchase of a car specifically because they had access to the Uber service. This translates to approximately three to four million people holding off on buying cars in an industry that sells about 15 to 20 million units per year.\n\nHowever, Sanjeev Kapoor, Senior Project Manager at Ford Motor Company, believes that the sharing economy will have a positive impact on the automotive industry. In an interview we conducted with Kapoor, he stated, \u201cWhile there might be fewer cars on the road, the amount of mileage will increase.\u201d Kapoor also sees the ride-sharing economy as an accelerator to innovative automotive technologies: \u201cConnectedness will be very important in a sharing car. Car-sharing initiatives will be a win-win for both automotive companies and the consumers.\u201d\n\nUber has even changed how some car dealerships are marketing themselves. A Toyota dealership in the Dallas area gives Uber drivers hefty discounts to have its dealership\u2019s license plate frame on Uber cars. The dealership sells approximately 200 cars per year to Uber drivers, which is about 6% of annual sales. The dealership is losing a significant amount of profit, but as the general manager claims, the loss is made back from valuable advertising on Uber cars.\n\nAsset-based ride-sharing\n\nCar-sharing provides a solution to individuals and households who normally would not have been able to afford either owning a car or using a taxi service as their primary mode of transport. In fact, even for those who can afford a car, if they drive 9,700 kilometres or less per year, it\u2019s probably cheaper to share than to own. This translates to about 27 kilometres per day, which is most likely exceeded only by people who commute long distances to work. Most people who live in the city would actually benefit from opting for car-sharing over owning a car.\n\nNot only is car-sharing increasing accessibility, it also creates environmental benefits. According to the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at UC Berkley, for each car-sharing vehicle, there are about nine to 13 fewer cars on the road, as members either sell their cars or postpone a purchase. This allows households to reduce their carbon emissions by 34\u201341% per year.\n\nBoth platform models and inventory-sharing models are applicable on a global scale. The same app can be used whether you are at home or travelling, which provides users with a familiar and convenient experience. It is evident that customers are changing their behaviours to adapt to this new technology. However, some cities are struggling to initiate urban planning in a timely manner to accommodate for shifting consumer preferences.\n\nUrban planning for the future\n\nRide-sharing is a hot button issue in cities around the world and rightfully so. Planning for how cities will operate today and in the future is an intricate process. Listening to current demands and trends is just as important as predicting future ones. At the rate that technology is currently evolving, it can upset plans that have been years in the making. Governments must consider accounting for future trends during the city planning process to avoid surprises down the road.\n\nToronto waited for decades to enjoy a convenient direct link between Toronto Pearson International Airport and the downtown core. In the spring of 2012, long-awaited construction began for the Union Pearson Express (UPX). Unfortunately, in the time it took to plan and begin construction, an unanticipated competitor arrived in Toronto. Paul Barter spoke to us about the arrival of the Uber model: \u201cToday from where I live at Yonge and Eglinton, the option I would have to utilize [to get to the airport] would be to go down the subway to Union [Station] and then take the Union Pearson Express. Alternatively, I can get into UberX and get to the airport faster and for a lower price.\u201d The UPX opened in June 2015 and by December it averaged 2200 riders a day, well below the daily target of 5000. In a city desperate for improved transit, the UPX was too expensive and inconvenient to make usage worthwhile. This has brought the whole regional transit strategy into question. The Metrolinx Board of Directors met on February 23, 2016 to discuss the UPX Business Strategy. Kathy Haley, President of the UPX, indicated that market conditions changed since launching the UPX, which were not predicted at the onset of the project. She went on to say that changing market conditions were predominantly in relation to ride-sharing services. \u201cWhen we had done the forecasting, we had not anticipated that new market condition coming into effect.\u201d Metrolinx was forced to reduce fares this month in an effort to boost ridership and Haley has resigned from her position as president of UPX.\n\nMobility differs from city to city, so it might be useful to look at the strategies adopted around the world when planning a large-scale transportation project. The National League of Cities (NLC) conducted a content analysis of city and regional transportation planning documents from the 50 most populous US cities, as well as the largest cities in every state \u2013 a total of 68 communities. These results uncovered two troubling facts. First, only 6% of plans consider the potential effect of driverless technology and only 3% of plans account for companies like Uber or Lyft, despite the fact that they operate in 60 of the 68 markets. These statistics are alarming. Cars dominate most major cities in North America, which makes change difficult to bring about. However, heavy traffic, long commutes and environmental concerns might help to move public sentiment toward a more sustainable future of transportation.\n\nOn the other hand, India has been proactive in addressing urban transportation issues. In 2015, the Government of India launched its Smart Cities Mission to promote cities that provide core infrastructure and give citizens a decent quality of life, a clean and sustainable environment, and application of \u201csmart\u201d solutions. The United Nations projects that India will add 404 million urban dwellers to its cities by 2050, adding pressure to ensure that their infrastructure can support such growth. To address these looming issues, the Smart Cities Mission will distribute $15 billion USD between national and local governments to help cities invest in sustainable infrastructure and growth. The mission will support 100 cities over five years. The first 20 proposals were recently selected. They focus on different areas of improvements including BRT planning and design, street design and car-free Sundays, and improvement of pedestrian facilities.\n\nCertain North American cities are beginning to see the value that Uber can provide with the wealth of data it has at its fingertips. Uber recently partnered with the City of Boston to help expand the city\u2019s capability to solve problems by leveraging data provided by the ride-sharing platform. The city will use the data to see where Uber rides begin and end. Paul Barter spoke to us about this partnership: \u201c[Boston] can respond to changes in the transportation environment literally overnight.\u201d By reviewing the detailed information on passenger travel trips, city planners might be able to better plan infrastructure and recognize future transportation trends before they become a reality. Speaking of future transportation trends, the National League of Cities predicts that, by 2020, transportation network companies will not only provide mobility services, but also delivery and freight, and they will be at the point of considering the use of autonomous vehicles. This makes it clear that cities need to accept new mobility solutions and update their regulations.\n\nRegulators and policy-makers playing catch-up\n\nMaRS Solutions Lab recently released a report on the sharing economy that outlined policy recommendations to help Ontario governments introduce effective regulations. The report identified that, while the sharing economy \u201cis adding value for consumers and offering alternate ways to get around, it has also blurred the lines between personal and commercial activities, effectively challenging the grey zone of regulation.\u201d In response, some cities are implementing new regulations and bylaws.\n\nIn January 2016, Edmonton became the first Canadian city to vote to legalize Uber (provided the company\u2019s drivers obtain legal commercial insurance). The same month, Uber received a taxi brokerage license in Toronto, but UberX continued to operate illegally in the city. In April 2016, Toronto released its regulatory plan to accommodate for ride-sharing. Calgary and Ottawa have also implemented regulations. In December 2015, Austin, Texas, approved an ordinance to the city\u2019s code that would require Uber and Lyft drivers to go through mandatory fingerprint requirements. Both companies have now threatened to leave the city if they do not reach an agreeable solution. On the other hand, companies like BlaBlaCar and BlancRide are able to avoid regulatory attention by allowing drivers to only recover costs, which prevents them from turning a profit. Currently, regulations vary by city and can result in unique complex issues for global ride-sharing platforms.\n\nOne prominent issue that has been highlighted in Toronto\u2019s ride-sharing debate is that of taxi drivers fighting to keep their income safe from the Uber threat. While it is important to protect jobs, it is also important to recognize that professions must evolve and transition with technological advancements. A new system might offer an innovative opportunity for society that could challenge the current incumbents\u2019 system. However, two parties make up the incumbents in the traditional taxi industry: drivers and investors.\n\n\u201cWe need to have regulations in place that support taxi drivers and Uber drivers on an equal footing,\u201d argues Paul Barter, an adjunct professor of technology strategy at the Schulich School of Business. When it comes to the investors, he says: \u201cYou don\u2019t protect the people who invested in Blockbuster because Netflix did a better job.\u201d\n\nThe government plays a critical role in helping users and operators to overcome barriers. Through regulation and funding, the government is integral in \u201cguiding and steering the expansion of shared mobility across metropolitan areas.\u201d However, the reality is that many governments are unsure of how to properly regulate ride-sharing models.\n\nLast year, the Mowat Centre published a report on policy-making for the sharing economy. The report\u2019s authors, Sunil Johal and Noah Zon, wrote that governments\u2019 unfamiliarity with sharing economy models has adversely affected their abilities to recognize the potential benefits. These benefits include innovation, economic growth and more efficient networks for urban transportation and logistics.\n\nGovernments and their departments developed the current rules and regulations over a period of decades, and most of them pre-date the sharing economy. In the end, businesses are consumed by a mass of regulations. This means that governments cannot keep pace with the rate of technological innovation and are slow to respond to the regulatory needs of new businesses. This can result in transportation-system silos, as various modes of travel are established separately instead of working together.\n\nRide-sharing and transit systems working together for a multimodal network\n\nRide-sharing has emerged to provide the public with varied transportation options to fill the gaps in their travel journey. Ride-sharing might solve the \u201clast mile\u201d problem (the distance between a transit station and final destination). ITDP reports that bike-sharing and car share users decide to use ride-sharing when public transit underserves their origin or destination. Navigant Research estimates that the demand for multimodal solutions in urban locations will increase by 20% each year for the next five years, and then level out to 12%. This indicates an opportunity for ride-sharing services and platforms to form partnerships with local governments.\n\nThe American Public Transportation Association (APTA) conducted an independent study to examine the relationship between public transportation and ride-sharing systems, including bike-sharing, car-sharing, and platform-based companies like Uber and Lyft. The study found that platform-based companies complement public transit and help to enhance urban mobility. It found that services like Uber and Lyft were most frequently used late at night, especially on the weekends, when public transit services are least available. Public transit agencies are encouraged to engage with ride-sharing services to collaborate and build partnerships. It is noted that \u201csuch a system is only possible if public sector entities make a concerted effort to ensure that collaboration with private mobility providers results in services that work for people of all ages, incomes and mobility needs.\u201d\n\nUber and the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) reached a cooperative agreement to improve their passengers\u2019 \u201clast mile\u201d problem. MARTA users can access the Uber app while using the public transit system to help them reach their final destination. Uber has reached a similar partnership with Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) to help create a solution for mobility issues within the city. The value added to users is the ease with which they are able to transfer between the two modes of transportation. These types of partnerships keep people moving through urban areas and demonstrate the importance of multimodal transportation initiatives.\n\nUber has recognized that multimodal transportation provides them with a huge opportunity to expand and build partnerships. They have learned that they do not need to own the trip from point A to point B. Instead, they can be an integral part of the trip. Earlier this year, Uber announced a partnership with transportation technology company TransLoc. By connecting public transit with ride-sharing platforms, users have an alternative to using their private automobiles. If urban areas continue to adopt multimodal transportation, we might see a decrease in the number of households purchasing vehicles. This could be achieved by combining transit options into a seamless system to make travelling around a city easy, equitable and enjoyable.\n\nLooking forward\u2026\n\nAs previously evidenced, there is no one solution to solving transportation woes; a multimodal system is necessary. It won\u2019t be a bike or a bus that solves the transportation problem. It will be a mixture of multiple transportation modes that allows urban mobility to reach its full potential. This can only be achieved if regulators and policy-makers catch up to fast-paced technological advancements that users have so readily adopted. It\u2019s clear that ride-sharing is here to stay and is making an impact on the transportation industry. It is important for entrepreneurs to continue pushing the boundaries in creating new solutions to shape the future of transportation. If one thing needs to be made clear, it is that ride-sharing lives in a very fluid environment and it might not look the same tomorrow as it does today.\n\nRide-sharing venture profiles\n\nWe spoke to three companies about their technologies and go-to-market plans. Read the profiles:\n\nWe met with Hamid Akbari at the BlancRide office to discuss their carpooling app, which strives to solve social, environmental and economic problems through the use of mobile platforms, while connecting people using new and emerging technologies.\n\nWhat industry do you see BlancRide operating in?\n\nWe are at the intersection of three industries: transportation, the sharing economy and mobile technology. It\u2019s going to be a new space of its own. Taking on the challenge of building something fundamentally different, unique and brand new means that our fight is not with competitors. Our challenge is learning how to build a new space for the general public that is ready for innovative technology, and that is ready to adapt to a different way for transportation.\n\nCould you tell us more about your product and the problem you\u2019re trying to solve?\n\nBlancRide is the Social Transportation Network, and as such, we strive to bring users the ease of a seamless commute with the added bonus of making a real-life connection. Typically, we look at people who are travelling from the suburbs to Toronto, a commute that is anywhere from 15 to 75 kilometres. Taking a taxi on a daily basis is not financially feasible for much of the population, and using public transit can be time-consuming, boring and more often than not uncomfortable.\n\nIn contrast, there are people who drive this route\u2014people who opt out of taking public transit. However, there is a trade-off when taking your own vehicle: traffic. Along with traffic comes the pain of wasted time, spending money on vehicle upkeep and paying for parking. If you\u2019re a Canadian driving to work alone, you\u2019re not alone. In fact, 83% of Canadians make their trip into work by driving alone.\n\nBlancRide\u2019s goal is to connect these two groups: the ones who need seats with the ones who need seats filled. The app is able to pair drivers and passengers who are travelling along the same route. In this way, people looking for a seamless and convenient ride can get one for a fraction of the cost, while those looking to give someone a ride are able to offset the costs of gas, vehicle upkeep and parking. BlancRide is also able to connect those who share certain interests, so not only do people share the ride but they\u2019re able to do so while enjoying a good conversation.\n\nOn a larger scale, BlancRide wanted to change the face of transportation and how we get around by taking vehicles off the road. If people were to adopt carpooling as a true means of transportation, we would be able to get around faster while also spending less money on road infrastructure. On an even larger scale, the potential positive impact it could have on our environment would be very significant. To track the impact of carpooling, BlancRide\u2019s eco-impact feature is able to tell you just how many pounds of carbon emissions you\u2019ve offset with each ride. Studies have shown that 600 pounds of carbon emissions saved is the same amount of CO2 emissions a tree will offset in its lifetime. Therefore, any time you reach the 600-pound mark within the app, you\u2019re given a virtual tree badge and BlancRide plants a physical tree in Ontario in your name.\n\nDo you find it\u2019s difficult to change habits?\n\nYes, and I believe there are three contributing factors to this. The first is that changing the habits of commuters who have been travelling the same way their whole lives is no easy feat and has been the most challenging aspect of growing our platform. With that being said, timing is on our side. Twenty years ago, it would have been impossible (if not extremely difficult) to incite such a drastic behavioural change. Nowadays, with the constant mobile access we have with our smartphones, it brings a whole other level of convenience in terms of helping you find solutions to everyday problems, such as finding a carpool or sharing rides with your colleagues.\n\nThe second aspect of it is psychological. The arrival of other sharing platforms, like Airbnb, helps people adjust to the idea of sharing. They think, \u201cOkay, I can start working with others. I can start sharing my time, my resources, my assets and my slack capacity,\u201d so from a psychological perspective, people are more ready to share than they\u2019ve ever been.\n\nThe third part, which is huge, is the trust aspect: it\u2019s not easy to trust a stranger. We\u2019ve been taught from a young age the perils of stranger danger, and that has clearly stayed with us into adulthood. Many people are not comfortable sharing a ride with a stranger. As a result, ride-sharing or carpooling is limited to friends who happen to live close to you, leaving at the same time and going to the same destination. With so many constraints, it\u2019s pretty much impossible and highly unlikely to find someone who fits these criteria. To help with breaking initial resistance, we have built the trust aspect into our app. We want to help people to overcome that psychological barrier and help people to feel comfortable sharing a ride with each other.\n\nDo you have a vetting process for your drivers and riders?\n\nWe have five mechanisms to establish trust. First, at the end of a trip, both parties rate each other. The community will naturally filter out those with a low rating. Second, we have staff verification. When a person registers, we verify their information. For drivers, we might ask for a photo of their driver\u2019s license, insurance and vehicle ownership, as these features are built into the app. If further verification is necessary, we contact the individual to make sure that people using the platform are helping the platform and becoming a part of the community.\n\nThird, we have GPS to track the ride for safety precautions. Fourth, we integrate with Facebook so that users are able to see common friends and gain trust in whom they\u2019re riding with. The final trust mechanism is that users have the final say and choice. We provide you with matches so you can choose whom you want to share a ride with. It is a mutual decision. The app provides you with a chat option so that you can communicate beforehand to confirm that you would share a ride with someone.\n\nWho are your users?\n\nWe have two major groups of users. The first group is students who commute to campus or who travel from one city to another city. For example, they might go to school in Waterloo but their friends and family live in Toronto. So at the end of each week they are making a trip between cities. The second group is the professional workforce that has a long daily commute.\n\nWe\u2019re looking to move up and start building relationships with big organizations that employ thousands and tens of thousands of employees. One issue they\u2019re facing is the dissatisfaction of employees due to the location of the workplace and the resulting long commute. We want to offer a customized solution to organizations to help employees experience a more convenient commute to their workplace and connect them with people who work in the same organization. Our goal is to help increase employee engagement, satisfaction and productivity. We also see organizations that have serious problems when it comes to parking infrastructure, to the point where there\u2019s no space for employees to park their vehicles. BlancRide can help to solve problems like this with our carpooling solution.\n\nWho would you consider your competitors, and how do you differentiate yourself from them?\n\nIn this case, we don\u2019t see competitors but potential collaborators. We\u2019re all players in transportation, whether it\u2019s a cab company, a ride-sharing company like Uber or public transit. We want to work with them all. We offer a unique service in the sense that we target specific needs. If you need a ride to the airport, our platform is not what you need. We\u2019re a carpooling company built for regular commuters who need to get from home to work and back.\n\nWhat would you say has been your biggest challenge to date as a startup and in bringing your product to market?\n\nThe biggest initial challenge was convincing people to shift their mindset and try carpooling. To overcome the challenge of early adoption, we targeted a campus to convince students to join. In a few months, 10% of students adopted the app.\n\nWe\u2019re now challenged with convincing big organizations to support, join and promote the platform. We have limited resources so it\u2019s challenging to spread awareness and market BlancRide.\n\nHowever, we\u2019re finding creative ways to overcome these challenges. We\u2019re identifying frequent users who benefit from sharing rides on a daily basis.\n\nWhat are your next steps?\n\nIn the next six months, we\u2019re going to build relationships with big organizations and onboard them for employee carpooling. We want BlancRide to work flawlessly in Toronto and show the world that a new form of transportation can actually work and be successful. Not only are individuals saving hundreds of dollars each month but there is also the added positive economic and social impact for the city. From there, we would like to replicate this model in 24 major cities in North America.\n\nWe spoke with Jason Guanzon from ecoRIDES to discuss their economical and eco-friendly automotive transportation solutions.\n\nTell us about ecoRIDES.\n\necoRIDES is a limousine-style transportation service, currently using the Tesla Model S. Our mission is zero emissions. We are an eccentric, economical and eco-friendly transportation service provider, keeping Conscious Capitalism in mind.\n\nWe use a franchise-based business model to grow our fleet, where electric vehicle owners can offer their cars to our sharing service when they are not using them. Our customers can order their ride through our mobile app, and one of our professional drivers will pick them up. We also offer in-app payment, a driver feedback system, and the ability to GPS track and communicate with your driver prior to pickup.\n\nWhat is your market? Who are your customers?\n\nWe are in the black-car market and the ride-sharing market. If you look at the ride-sharing market, it is all basically technology companies. We are coming into that market as a transportation carrier first. We want to take the Uber business model one step further and create home-based business programs using only zero emission fleet vehicles.\n\nOur current customers are mainly business executives. We do a lot of airport transit. We\u2019re also getting into wine tours and social events.\n\nHow do you differentiate from your competition?\n\nWe are one of the only companies to use an all-green fleet of vehicles. We want to be a leader in zero emission transportation. We\u2019re one of the first in the black-car market to use a mobile application to book a ride. We\u2019re also cheaper than regular limo companies. Our price points are more similar to UberX rates.\n\nWe have a competitive advantage in safety and customer experience. First, we use Teslas, which are rated the safest vehicles in North America. Combine that with the autopilot feature, we also have the safest drivers in the world since we can eliminate much of the human error attributed to accidents.\n\nWe also don\u2019t run into the regulatory issues many ride-sharing companies do. All of our vehicles are commercially insured and have local limousine permits. Our drivers also have permits.\n\nThere is still some stigma around safety issues with Uber. You don\u2019t know who is picking you up. We don\u2019t have that problem. We are a referral-based organization in which our clients and drivers are usually within three degrees of separation. We are able to build relationships with our clientele and provide a personalized experience to match their needs.\n\nWhat are your next steps?\n\nLater this year, we will be branching out into more of a ride-sharing service and reaching more cities across Ontario.\n\nWe are planning to expand our fleet with economical electric vehicles as well to cater to a wider audience, and with the Tesla Model X when that is released.\n\nWe also want to incorporate a feature into our app that counts your environmental impact by using our green-car services.

Its narrow, convoluted streets are overflowing with vehicles.\n\nThe total number of private vehicles registered in Vientiane increased at an average annual growth rate of 17% during 2000\u20132009 and at a growth rate of more than 10% since then. Congestion is swelling, pollution is building up, and road accidents are on the rise. Traditionally, Vientiane\u2019s public transport has not been commuter friendly, largely comprising tuk-tuks or tricycles. As a result, there is a high dependence on private vehicles. In 2011, motorcycles accounted for 67% of daily trips compared to an estimated 0.6% for public transport.\n\nTo encourage a shift from private vehicles to public transport, the city\u2019s bus service, the Vientiane Capital State Bus Enterprise (VCSBE), has been improving its services from the central bus station to other points in Vientiane, with technical and financial support from the Japan International Cooperation Agency. To help transform Vientiane into a sustainable city, the Lao PDR government is introducing a bus rapid transit (BRT) system linked to the VCSBE bus networks and other transport modes.\n\n\u201cTransport is the lifeblood of urban development,\u201d says Senior Transport Specialist for Southeast Asia Daisuke Mizusawa. \u201cA sustainable urban transport system can propel a city toward progress while ensuring the safety and mobility of its inhabitants.\u201d\n\nThe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic is working with ADB and cofinancing partners European Union, European Investment Bank, Global Environment Facility, and the OPEC Fund for International Development in setting up a bus rapid transport system.\n\nInterventions\n\nThrough the Vientiane Sustainable Urban Transport Project (VSUTP), the Lao PDR government has found supportive allies that share the same goals\u2014steering Vientiane away from its current unsustainable path. ADB, the European Union\u2019s Asia Investment Facility, European Investment Bank, Global Environment Facility, and the OPEC Fund for International Development, are cofinancing the project. They envision that this initiative will ease congestion in the city and contribute to a significant decrease in carbon emissions.\n\nA bus rapid transit\n\nThe centerpiece of the project is a modern BRT system. Three BRT routes with a length of 149 kilometers (km) (ITECC Mall\u2013Non Teng, Tha Ngon\u2013Thongpong, and National University of Laos\u2013Fa Ngum Statue Park) will be integrated into the VCSBE network. Their combined network will total 304.4 km. A BRT corridor between the National University of Laos and Fa Ngum, consisting of 12.9-kilometer dedicated bus lanes with 28 enclosed stations, will be developed to transform the city center. The BRT system, once completed, will feature 50 new battery-electric buses.\n\nImproved traffic management system\n\nThe BRT system will include a sustainable and safe traffic management system to ensure that the benefits of the BRT are maximized, especially for pedestrians. Road safety concerns will be alleviated when traffic lights and signals at pedestrian crossings, pavements, and universal accessibility features are in place. To ensure smooth traffic flow and entice people to take public transport, the project will also install a parking management system, which includes on-street paid parking in the city center area using electronic meters. A vehicle registration system was already established to help enforce parking regulations while the parking management system will provide 2,100 on-street parking spaces for cars and 1,800 spaces for motorcycles.\n\nAccessibility for pedestrians and non-motorized transport\n\nThe project will also improve pedestrian facilities near BRT station areas by installing signalized pedestrian crossings, street lighting, pavement upgrades, and universal accessibility measures. In addition, it will introduce nonmotorized transit by providing electric pedal vehicles (e-pedicab) which aims to improve the quality of transport service and promote green energy in the city center of Vientiane.\n\nA sustainable transport management entity\n\nThe project is helping the government set up an Urban Transport Management Section (UTMS) that will oversee BRT operations and facilities and other sustainable transport operations in the future. An attached technical assistance financed by the High-Level Technology Fund has been providing staff to be assigned to the UTMS with capacity development programs.\n\nAside from the BRT, the Vientiane Sustainable Urban Transport Project will also provide e-pedicabs to promote the use of green energy in the city.\n\nPotential results\n\nThe BRT will help transform the city, turning it from a congested hub into an environment and pedestrian-friendly center. At project completion, projections indicate that the use of public transport will increase, from its share of 0.6% in 2013 to 6% by 2025. When the BRT is fully operational, it will serve 48,000 riders a day, compared to just 4,000 in 2013. Moreover, it will help cut down the city\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions by 25,000 metric tons per year from 2020 onwards.\n\nThe interventions provided by the project will boost private sector participation. The private sector will be tapped to run the parking and vehicle registration systems. Private service providers will also be tapped to run the bus operations, fare system and control center, and other BRT system functions.\n\nProject completion is estimated to be in 2024.\n\n\u201cWhen work is done, Vientiane will move a step further toward becoming a sustainable urban hub, with a BRT system decked with advanced technology and innovative practices,\u201d says Mr. Mizusawa. \u201cThis new infrastructure will help ensure the accessibility, safety, and mobility of the city\u2019s growing population.\u201d\n\nThe BRT will transform Vientiane from a congested hub into an environment and pedestrian-friendly center."}, {"url": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Linking_Bicycle_pedestrian_Facilities_wi.html?id=AFhPAAAAMAAJ", "page_content": "About 40 percent of Americans own bicycles, and many of these people live one-quarter mile to two miles away from express transit stops.

It increases mobility options, gets more Americans biking and enhances the overall transportation networks in our cities and towns. Bike sharing involves a network of bicycles and stations, where a member or renter can check out a bike from a station and return it to any other station within the network. When planned well, these systems complement existing transportation systems by offering users an option for quick and reliable one-way trips.\n\nBelow is a series of questions which have been frequently asked of both the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) related to bike sharing systems, their eligibility, funding, and relevance within the Department.\n\nFor questions or concerns, please contact Matthew Lesh (FTA) and/or Christopher Douwes (FHWA).\n\nNOTE: These questions and answers apply to laws as in effect July 1, 2012. These questions and answers will be updated to incorporate revisions enacted in the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) that take effect October 1, 2012.\n\nQuestion General Answer\n\nWhat is bike sharing? Bike sharing is an innovative transportation solution, ideal for short-distance, point-to-point trips. These systems provide users the ability to pick up a bicycle at any self-serve bike station and return it to any other bike station located within the service area. Additional information on bike sharing can be located through the Pedestrian and Bicycle Information Center at: www.pedbikeinfo.org/programs/promote_bikeshare.cfm.\n\nFunding\n\nWhat types of Federal funding may be used for bike sharing? FHWA and FTA administer various programs that can be used to fund bike sharing systems, amenities, infrastructure, and components. In 2011, FTA issued a policy stating that amenities related to bicycle access to public transportation have a de facto relationship to transit within a 3-mile radius, and that capital funds could be used for these eligible expenses. A full list of FTA programs and eligibility requirements can be found here: www.transit.dot.gov/regulations-and-guidance/environmental-programs/livable-sustainable-communities/bicycles-transit.\n\nA full list of FHWA programs and eligibility requirements can be found here: www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/bicycle_pedestrian/funding/funding_opportunities.cfm.\n\nWhat existing USDOT discretionary grant opportunities are available at the Federal level for bike share programs? FTA initiates most discretionary grant programs by publishing a Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA). Each NOFA explains the eligibility and evaluation criteria associated with each opportunity. Eligibility under a discretionary grant program will depend on the ability of the bike sharing project to satisfy the eligibility and evaluation criteria. In the recent past, FTA funded bike sharing projects under the Bus Livability Program. Most FHWA funds are apportioned to the States and Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) by formula, and the States and MPOs select projects for funding. FHWA administers a few discretionary grant programs for which bike share projects may be eligible. These include the Transportation, Community, and System Preservation Program, which has provided support for bike sharing programs. Bike sharing projects also are eligible under the DOT TIGER program.\n\nWhat costs can FTA funding be used for in establishing a bike share system? FTA funding may be used for bike share docks, equipment, and other capital costs including infrastructure and amenities related to bicycling, as long as they are related to public transportation (defined by the FTA Bike and Pedestrian Catchment Policy). FTA funds cannot be used to purchase bicycles. Historically, FTA has not included bicycles within the definition of public transportation. Additionally, FTA funds cannot be used for operational costs, or costs associated with system startup.\n\nPolicy\n\nAre there any restrictions on advertising or sponsorship with bike sharing systems? Aside from its standard requirements like full and open competition procurement and a requirement that \u201cprogram income\u201d derived from advertising be used for public transportation, FTA does not place any restrictions on advertising or sponsorship of bike sharing systems that receive FTA funds. Further, State, local, or transit agencies may have their own restrictions on advertising and sponsorship. However, FHWA does have some restrictions on outdoor advertising at bike stations if the bike station is located along or adjacent to a highway that is on the National Highway System, or was on the Federal-aid primary system as of June 1, 1991. FHWA has issued a policy on sponsorship acknowledgments within the public right-of-way, and the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways (MUTCD) contains the national standard for all traffic control devices on, over, or adjacent to a street, pedestrian facility, bikeway, or private road open to public travel.\n\nHow does the Buy America Act apply to bike sharing? FTA and FHWA have separate and distinct Buy America rules. Under FTA guidance, a bicycle sharing system is comprised of several end products. Each end product and its components must be produced in the United States. FTA's rules originated with a provision in the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1978 and are currently codified at 49 U.S.C. \u00a75323(j) and implemented by regulation at 49 C.F.R. Part 661. Under FHWA's Buy America requirements, steel and iron purchased on a contract funded with Federal funds must be produced in the United States. These requirements apply only to the actual steel and iron that is incorporated into a product, and there is an allowance for a minimal amount of foreign-produced steel or iron ($2,500, or one-tenth of one percent of the total contract price, whichever is greater). Consult FHWA's information page for more information on its Buy America guidance. FHWA's Buy America rules are codified at 23 U.S.C. \u00a7313 and implemented by regulation at 23 C.F.R. \u00a7635.410.\n\nBike Share in General\n\nAre there any examples of bike sharing in smaller communities (under 100,000 in population)? In the US, examples include Boulder B-Cycle in Colorado (Population: 97,000 / 110 bicycles), Decobike in Miami Beach (Population 88,000 / ~1,000 bicycles), and others in the planning stages.\n\nIs theft an issue with bike share bicycles or components? Bicycle theft has not been a significant problem in current bike share systems in the U.S., as technology for bicycles locks has greatly improved and has reduced theft. Furthermore, bike sharing bicycles are typically made with special proprietary parts that would not be usable with other bikes, which greatly deters theft of bicycles or parts. Interestingly, Minneapolis only had one theft in 2011, and DC/Arlington Capital Bikeshare's theft rate is less than 1%.\n\nTransit and Bike Share\n\nAre there problems keeping bicycles and open docks available for users at high-traffic transit stations? During peak hours, stations in high demand areas do or can experience shortages. However, most programs have redistribution efforts and vehicles to help address this concern and try to keep bicycles available. This can include providing incentives to users to redistribute bikes (e.g., credits).\n\nAre there any examples in the United States of bike share systems that are planned as a complement to a transit system? Several systems (including Boston's Hubway and an upcoming Orange County CA system) are using FTA discretionary and/or formula grant funding to locate bike share stations at transit stops, along with other bike share stations within the three mile radius around transit to allow transit patrons to take bike sharing to their stop.\n\nAre there any examples of bike share and transit systems sharing a common farecard? In the United States, not yet. There are examples in Europe of transit systems and bike share systems sharing a common farecard, and even offering bike share use as a free transfer from transit."}]}
