It is one of the native homelands of the indigenous Berber people. Geographically, Morocco is characterised by a rugged mountainous interior, large tracts of desert and a lengthy coastline along the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Morocco has a population of over 33.8 million and an area of. Its capital is Rabat, and the largest city is Casablanca. Other major cities include Marrakesh, Tangier, Sal\u00e9, Fes, Meknes and Oujda. A historically prominent regional power, Morocco has a history of independence not shared by its neighbours. Since the foundation of the first Moroccan state by Idris I in 788 AD, the country has been ruled by a series of independent dynasties, reaching its zenith under the Almoravid dynasty and Almohad dynasty, spanning parts of Iberia and northwestern Africa. The Marinid and Saadi dynasties continued the struggle against foreign domination, and Morocco remained the only North African country to avoid Ottoman occupation. The Alaouite dynasty, the current ruling dynasty, seized power in 1631. In 1912, Morocco was divided into French and Spanish protectorates, with an international zone in Tangier, and regained its independence in 1956. Moroccan culture is a blend of Berber, Arab, West African and European influences. Morocco claims the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, formerly Spanish Sahara, as its Southern Provinces. After Spain agreed to decolonise the territory to Morocco and Mauritania in 1975, a guerrilla war arose with local forces. Mauritania relinquished its claim in 1979, and the war lasted until a cease-fire in 1991. Morocco currently occupies two thirds of the territory, and peace processes have thus far failed to break the political deadlock. Morocco is a constitutional monarchy with an elected parliament. The King of Morocco holds vast executive and legislative powers, especially over the military, foreign policy and religious affairs. Executive power is exercised by the government, while legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of parliament, the Assembly of Representatives and the Assembly of Councillors. The king can issue decrees called dahirs, which have the force of law. He can also dissolve the parliament after consulting the Prime Minister and the president of the constitutional court. Morocco's predominant religion is Islam, and the official languages are Arabic and Berber, with Berber being the native language of Morocco before the Arab conquest in the 600s AD. The Moroccan dialect of Arabic, referred to as Darija, and French are also widely spoken. Morocco is a member of the Arab League, the Union for the Mediterranean and the African Union. It has the fifth largest economy of Africa.\n\nNew!!: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 botanique de France and Morocco \u00b7 See more \u00bb\n\nThe National Horticultural Society of France (French: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nationale dhorticulture de France, or SNHF) is a horticultural society founded in 1827 by Louis-\u00c9tienne H\u00e9ricart de Thury.\n\nNew!!: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 botanique de France and National Horticultural Society of France \u00b7 See more \u00bb\n\nThe French National Museum of Natural History, known in French as the (abbreviation MNHN), is the national natural history museum of France and a grand \u00e9tablissement of higher education part of Sorbonne Universities.\n\nNew!!: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 botanique de France and National Museum of Natural History (France) \u00b7 See more \u00bb\n\nPierre \u00c9tienne Simon Duchartre (27 October 1811, Portiragnes \u2013 5 November 1894, Meudon) was a French botanist.\n\nNew!!: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 botanique de France and Pierre \u00c9tienne Simon Duchartre \u00b7 See more \u00bb\n\nThe Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9ologique de France (SGF) is a French learned society founded on 17 March 1830.\n\nNew!!: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 botanique de France and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9ologique de France \u00b7 See more \u00bb\n\nTaxonomy is the science of defining and naming groups of biological organisms on the basis of shared characteristics.\n\nNew!!: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 botanique de France and Taxonomy (biology) \u00b7 See more \u00bb\n\nJean Jacques Timoth\u00e9e Puel (August 22, 1813 \u2013 January 28, 1890) was a French physician and botanist.\n\nNew!!: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 botanique de France and Timoth\u00e9e Puel \u00b7 See more \u00bb\n\nWladimir de Schoenefeld (12 January 1816 in Berlin \u2013 8 September 1875 in Paris) was a German-born, French botanist.\n\nNew!!: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 botanique de France and Wladimir de Schoenefeld \u00b7 See more \u00bb\n\nRedirects here:\n\nBotanical Society of France, Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Botanique de France, Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 botanique de France, Societe botanique de France, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Botanique de France.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci\u00e9t\u00e9_botanique_de_France"}, {"url": "https://wiki.alquds.edu/?query=Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_botanique_de_France", "page_content": "French learned society\n\n\"Journal de Botanique\" and \"J.

The first concert of the society took place on 17 November 1871 at the Salle Pleyel. It featured the Trio in B-flat Major by Franck, two songs by Dubois, Five Pieces in Ancient Style by Castillon, a reduction of the Violin Concerto by Garcin, an Improvisation for tenor by Massenet, and the Caprice h\u00e9ro\u00efque for two pianos by Saint-Sa\u00ebns, played by the composer and Faur\u00e9.\n\nCamille Saint-Sa\u00ebns: Caprice h\u00e9ro\u00efque, Op. 106 (Christian Ivaldi, piano; No\u00ebl Lee, piano)\n\n\n\nFrancis Poulenc described the music of Emmanuel Chabrier as an \u201cinexhaustible treasure.\u201d One of the most individual composers of the French school between Berlioz and Debussy, he was a great admirer of Wagner and he had even made a pilgrimage to Bayreuth. This kind of admiration for Wagner did not sit well with the Society, but Paul Dukas defended him suggesting, \u201cFortunately he has shown himself capable of preserving his native originality.\u201d Chabrier was described as the \u201cmost astonishing, eccentric and prodigious pianist one could ever encounter,\u201d and Vincent d\u2019Indy added, \u201cdespite over-fat fingers and a certain awkwardness in his bearing, he was capable of reaching heights of finesse and a maximum of expression which very few pianist\u2014I should barely except Liszt and Rubinstein\u2014have surpassed.\u201d His Ten Pie\u0300ces pittoresques date from 1880, and Marie Poitevin premiered a selection at the Socie\u0301te\u0301 Nationale de Musique on 9 April 1881. After the premiere, Ce\u0301sar Franck is reported to have exclaimed \u201cWe have just heard something extraordinary: music which links our time with that of Couperin and Rameau.\u201d Chabrier\u2019s detractors did find stylistic improprieties, and Debussy, with reference to the subtitle \u201cpittoresques\u201d sarcastically wrote, \u201cit categorizes things which have nothing to do with what the word represents exactly.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Chabrier: 10 Pi\u00e8ces pittoresques (Aldo Ciccolini, piano)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe society was immensely popular from the very beginning. Soon after its establishment it attracted roughly 150 members, with Georges Bizet, Edouard Lalo, and Charles-Marie Widor among them. Initially, the society had hoped to present orchestral concerts, but lacking funds, they steered towards piano and chamber music. A historian explains, \u201cComposers came to meetings prepared to offer their own compositions or to accompany singers who performed their m\u00e9lodies, and that this set the society\u2019s concerts apart from routine concerts.\u201d Concerts were for members only during the early years, but tickets were later made available to the general public. Since the society was unwilling to engage with opera, it quickly attracted young composers. Gabriel Faur\u00e9 recalled, \u201cThe truth is that before 1870 I would never have dreamt of composing a sonata or a quartet. At that period there was no chance of a composer getting a hearing with works like that. I was given the incentive when Saint-Sa\u00ebns founded the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Musique in 1871 with the primary aim of putting on works by young composers.\u201d\n\nGabriel Faur\u00e9: Violin Sonata No. 1\n\nGabriel Faur\u00e9 premiered his 1st violin sonata at the society in 1877, and Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns commented, \u201ca magic floats above everything.\u201d Saint-Sa\u00ebns had always been a great supporter of the young Faur\u00e9, and during his time as professor at the \u00c9cole Niedermeyer he introduced him to Schumann, Liszt and Wagner. He also helped Faur\u00e9 to find a number of organist jobs, and he introduced him to the uncontested grand diva of the nineteenth century, Pauline Viardot. Faur\u00e9 was soon a regular at Viardot\u2019s salons and his 1st violin sonata is dedicated to her. He did have trouble getting it published, however, as publishers could not get a grip on his peculiar blend of ancient and modern music. However, it perfectly expressed the aesthetic aims of the society. Faur\u00e9 stayed intimately connected to the society, and he heavily leaned on his friends when a prestigious commission for an opera could not be realized. In fact, he left France for a stay in Venice, and as a guest of Winnaretta Singer, he worked on setting to a handful poems by Verlaine. Once he had returned from Italy he completed his Cinq m\u00e9lodies de Venise and the complete cycle was premiered on 2 April 1892 at the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Musique.\n\nGabriel Faur\u00e9: Cinq m\u00e9lodies de Venise (Jean-Francois Lapointe, baritone; Louise-Andree Baril, piano)\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the 1880s, the society had abandoned its purely French direction and allowed foreign composers and works to participate. By that time, Belgium-born C\u00e9sar Franck had long secured his naturalization papers. Born in Li\u00e8ge into the family of a Walloon father and mother of German descent, he was sent to Paris to study with Anton Reicha. In 1836 he applied to enter the conservatory, but was initially refused on grounds of his nationality. He had to wait for an entire year for his citizenship papers to be approved, and he eventually enrolled at the Conservatoire on 4 October 1837. Almost 50 years later, Franck composed his Symphonic Variations for piano and orchestra. It was written for the French pianist Louis Die\u0301mer, who had given the Parisian premie\u0300re of Les Djinns. \u201cYou played splendidly,\u201d Franck told him. \u201cI will write you a special little piece and dedicate it to you.\u201d Die\u0301mer did give the premie\u0300re at a society concert on 1 May 1886 with the composer conducting. However, under the presidency of Vincent d\u2019Indy the society had become increasingly conservative, and Franck\u2019s compositions did not gain favor with the greater public.\n\nC\u00e9sar Franck: Symphonic Variations (Bertrand Chamayou, piano; Royal Scottish National Orchestra; St\u00e9phane Den\u00e8ve, cond.)\n\n\n\nClaude Debussy joined the society in 1888. At that time Vincent d\u2019Indy, Ernest Chausson and members of the C\u00e9sar Franck circle, who idolized the symphonies and quartets of Beethoven, controlled it. Debussy offered his string quartet to the society, and especially to his good friend Chausson as \u201ca token of reassurance of good faith and solidarity\u201d. Years earlier, d\u2019Indy had warmly supported Debussy, and the \u201cDebussy quartet is an act, on the one hand, by which he seeks to return respect for the ideas of those who have shown him and his work respect; and, on the other hand, by which he aspires to a certain legitimacy in the eyes of those who have set the price of legitimacy.\u201d Debussy had returned from his two-year Prix de Rome residency a couple years earlier, and he was eager to compose in a distinctly French musical style. The quartet premiered on 29 December 1893, but it was met with a bewildered reception.\n\nDebussy: String Quartet\n\nBy 1910, a group of young composers led by Mauric Ravel set up the rival Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Musicale Ind\u00e9pendante, and they secured Faur\u00e9 as their president. They were able to attract composers like B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, Manuel de Falla, Arnold Schoenberg, Igor Stravinsky and Anton Webern. Initially, there was an attempt to bring the old and new societies together, but they could not come to terms. In the years between the Wars the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale did present avant-garde works by composers including Arthur Honegger, Francis Poulenc, Bohuslav Martin\u016f, Henri Lutz, Marcel Pollet, Marcel Lubey and D\u00e9odat de S\u00e9verac. However, the days of the society were numbered and it closed its doors for good in 1939. The writer Romain Rolland summarized the importance of this exceptional organization as follows, \u201cIt is with respect that we must speak of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale, which was truly the cradle and sanctuary of French art. Everything that was great in French music, from 1870 to 1900, came through it. Without the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale, most of the works that are the honour of our music not only would not have been performed, but perhaps would not even have been written. It had the rare merit of always being ten or fifteen years ahead of public opinion, which it formed, and which it compelled to honour those whom it was the first to recognise as great.\u201d\n\nFor more of the best in classical music, to our E-Newsletter\n\nDebussy: Pour le piano"}]}
