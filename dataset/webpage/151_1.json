Born 17 years before Charles Dickens began to write about the poverty of the Victorian era, Josiah taught himself to write and joined a unitarian Sunday School as they could provide him with a basic education. He went on to build a vast fortune from self taught engineering skills and astute business knowledge.\n\n\u200b\n\nFrom an early age, Josiah showed an entrepreneurial flare and tried his hand at many inventions, trades and business ventures before moving to Birmingham in 1816. By 1824, he invested the savings he had earned into a business which manufactured split rings. It was here that he improved the machinery that made the rings so that it was bevelled, hence the modern day key ring. He later went on to become the largest manufacturer of steel pens and pen nibs in the World and contributed heavily to the Birmingham pen trade. He also improved the machinery to make the split pen nib.\n\n\u200b\n\nJosiah, most likely influenced by his childhood experiences was an extremely caring and generous man who went on to do many charitable works, including the founding of schools, a dispensary and Mason Science College, the forerunner of the University of Birmingham. He was knighted for his good works in November 1872.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Trust\n\nIn 1858, Josiah built the first Almshouses in Station Road, Erdington for 30 'spinsters and widows' over 50 years old and rooms for 20 orphan girls. These Almshouses were demolished in 1974.\n\n\u200b\n\nIt was 10 years later that the Trust was officially founded on the 29th July 1868, in readiness for the opening of a second, larger orphanage in Bell Lane (now Orphanage Road), Erdington, with rooms for 26 women and dormitories for 300 children. It cost \u00a360,000 to build and was endowed to the sum of \u00a3200,000. All of this was financed by Sir Josiah and it amounted to a huge fortune at this time. Later a new wing was added to enable a total of 500 children to be accommodated. The orphanage was eventually re-designated as a school, but by the 1960's the cost of upkeep had become prohibitive, leading the Trustees to close it in 1960.\n\nThe Trust retained ownership of a small part of the Orphanage site which contained 36 Almshouses built in the 1920's and which are now called Mason Cottages. It then went on to build further Almshouses on our sites in Shirley in 1974 and Olton in 1979 and started providing care services in the 1980's.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Trust has continued to grow and evolve over the years and the need for the Trust is as real today as it was 150 years ago. We now enter an exciting and ambitious new phase of development in which we aim to improve the lives of many more people living in Birmingham and Solihull."}, {"url": "https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Josiah_Mason", "page_content": "Josiah Mason, pen manufacturer and philanthropist\n\n1795 born in Kidderminster, son of Josiah Mason, a carpet-weaver\n\n1816 He moved to Birmingham when he was 21 and stayed there for the rest of his life.

At the age of eight he commenced selling cakes in the streets, and afterwards fruit and vegetables, which he carried from door to door on a donkey. In 1810 he taught himself shoemaking, and was afterwards a carpenter, a blacksmith, and a house-painter. In 1814 he became a carpet-weaver, and from 1817 to 1822 he acted as manager of the imitation gold jewellery works of his uncle, Richard Griffiths of Birmingham. In 1824 he became manager for Samuel Harrison, a split-ring maker, and in 1825 he purchased his master's business for 500l. He then invented a plan for making split key-rings by machinery, which proved to be profitable. John and William Mitchell and Joseph Gillott had already commenced making steel pens, when, in 1829, Mason tried his hand at pen-making, and putting himself into communication with James Perry, stationer, of Red Lion Square, London, became Perry's pen-maker for many years. These pens bore the name of the seller and not of the manufacturer. The first order of one hundred gross of pens was sent to London 20 Nov. 1830. About twelve workpeople were employed, and one hundred weight of steel was thought a large quantity to roll for a week's consumption. In 1874 one thousand persons were employed, the quantity of steel rolled every week exceeded three tons, and on an average a million and a half of pens were produced from each ton of steel. In 1844 the Brothers Elkington took out a patent for the use of cyanides of gold and silver in electro-plating, and, requiring capital to develop the business, were joined by Mason. The electro-plated spoons, forks, and other articles soon came into use, and their popularity was much increased after the Great Exhibition of 1851. Having made a large sum of money in this connection, Mason retired from the firm in 1856. But, with Elkington, he also established copper-smelting works at Pembrey, Carmarthenshire, and became a nickel smelter, importing the ore from New Caledonia. In December 1875 he sold his pen manufactory to a limited liability company. He died at Norwood House, Erdington, near Birmingham, on 16 June 1881. He married, 18 Aug. 1817, his cousin, Anne, daughter of Richard Griffiths of Birmingham. She died 24 Feb. 1870.\n\nMason gradually accumulated upwards of half a million of money, the greater part of which he spent on charitable objects. In 1858 he founded, in Erdington village, almshouses for thirty aged women and an orphanage for fifty girls. Between 1860 and 1868 he spent 60,000l. on the erection of a new orphanage at Erdington, and then, by a deed executed in August, he transferred the edifice, together with an endowment in land and buildings valued at 200,000l., to a body of seven trustees. This orphanage is capable of receiving three hundred girls, one hundred and fifty boys, and fifty infants. On 30 Nov. \u200b1872 he was knighted by letters patent. His most important work, the Scientific College at Birmingham, which cost him 180,000l., was opened on 1 Oct. 1880, and in 1893 had 556 students. Mason placed the trustees of his college under the obligation to overhaul each department every seven years, with a view to maintaining the teachig at the highest level of scientific research. Medical classes have lately been added.\n\nA portrait of Mason by H. J. Munns is in the board-room of the college which he founded at Birmingham, and a seated statue by F. J. Williamson is in front of the college."}, {"url": "http://www.childrenshomes.org.uk/BirminghamMason/", "page_content": "Josiah Mason's Orphanage, Erdington, Birmingham, Warwickshire\n\nJosiah Mason (1795-1881) was born in Kidderminster, the son of a carpet weaver. He was largely self-educated and tried his hand a variety of trades in his native town before moving to Birmingham in 1816. There he became involved in industries such as electro-plating, key-ring making, rubber ring making, and \u2014 most notably \u2014 the manufacture of steel pens and nibs through which he amassed a considerable fortune. He subsequently used much of his wealth for philanthropic purposes.\n\nMason's first orphanage was erected on Station Road, Erdington, and opened in 1858. The building originally accommodated thirty orphan girls who, in addition to a basic education, were taught baking, washing, and other domestic skills. The success of the institution led to its capacity being increased to fifty. Plans for a further extension eventually evolved into a scheme for an altogether much larger institution which would accommodate 300 or more children, two-thirds of them being girls and one-third boys.\n\nThe new building was situated on what was then called Bell Lane, soon renamed Orphanage Road. Its foundation stone was laid by Mason himself, privately, on September 19th, 1860, with the building being completed and first occupied in 1868. In addition to a reported expenditure of \u00a360,000 on the building, the founder endowed the institutions with land and building estates with an estimated value of \u00a3200,000. Following the opening of the new orphanage, the Station Road premises were converted into almshouses for twenty aged women.\n\nThe location of the home is shown on the 1937 map below.\n\nThe building, designed by J.R. Botham, was constructed in brick and had three prominent towers which acted both as chimneys for all the fireplaces but also assisted in the ventilation of the establishment. On the ground floor, at the left-hand end of the south-west front, was a library, with the chapel to its rear. Between the two projecting wings of the front were six private rooms used as offices, and the infants' nursery. At the angle of the building was the infants' school room. Along the south-east front were two store rooms, the officers' dining room, and the children's dining hall. Behind these were the kitchen and laundry, together with stores, pantries and servants' offices. On the first floor, above the library, was the infirmary. Eight bedrooms were placed above the private rooms, and the girls' sewing room above the infants' school room. Three classrooms lay over the stores and officers' dining room, and a school room over the dining hall. Above the kitchen were two lavatories (washrooms) and a store over the laundry. A girls' playroom was above some of the offices at the back. The second floor was occupied by dormitories. The basement under the whole of the south-east front was used as a covered playground.\n\nMason placed the ownership and management of the orphanage in the hands of a board of trustees. The trust deed specified matters such as how the education and religious instruction of the inmates was to be conducted, for example:\n\nThe who are admitted into the Orphanage are to be lodged, clothed, fed, maintained, educated, and brought up gratuitously at the exclusive cost of the Orphanage income. Proper arrangements shall be made by the trustees for the instruction of the children, having due regard to their respective ages and capacities in reading, writing, arithmetic, geography and history. All the children shall be brought up in habits of industry and, as far as possible, the girls be instructed in sewing, baking, cooking, washing, mangling, and in all ordinary household and domestic duties. The children shall be carefully instructed in the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures in the authorised English version.\n\nUnlike many other orphanages, Mason's demanded that candidates for admission were orphans in the strictest sense, namely that they were to be the legitimate children of parents both of whom were dead. Boys were required to be aged from seven to ten years old at their time of admission and left when they were fourteen; girls were admitted between four and ten years old, leaving at the age of fifteen. Certificates were required of the marriage and death of the parents, and of the birth of the child. Admissions were made by the trustees at meetings held for the purpose four times a year.\n\nIn 1874, an additional block was built at the east of the site, containing dormitories and a school room for 120 boys. It was linked to the main building by a large new dining hall where up to 200 girls, 120 boys and 30 infants all met together for meals and prayers.\n\nA mortuary chapel was erected in the grounds of the orphanage, in which the remains of Sir Josiah Mason and his wife were interred. He died at his residence, Norwood House, Erdington, on June 15th, 1881.\n\nOn 26th July, 1919, the orphanage was formally accredited as a Certified School, allowing it to receive children boarded out by the workhouse authorities.\n\nThe orphanage's choir was highly regarded and was regularly featured in BBC radio broadcasts in the 1920s and 30s.\n\nBrowse through a gallery of pictures of the orphanage from the 1930s/40s.\n\nFollowing a steady decline in the number of its residents, the orphanage finally closed in 1964 and the buildings demolished to make way for a housing estate. Mason's work is continued by the Sir Josiah Mason Trust which provides a variety of housing and residential care for the elderly.\n\nRecords\n\nNote: many repositories impose a closure period of up to 100 years for records identifying individuals. Before travelling a long distance, always check that the records you want to consult will be available.\n\nThe Orphanage's records are said to have been destroyed by the Birmingham Social Services when the institution closed.

Already pushing forward the boundaries of research in medicine and the sciences, Birmingham was beginning to change the world.\n\nThe early days\n\nThe University grew out of Mason College, which can trace its roots back to the medical education seminars of Mr John Tomlinson in 1767-68. He was \u2018First Surgeon\u2019 to the Birmingham Workhouse Infirmary and his 28 weekly lectures on anatomy were the first to be held outside London or south of the Scottish border. Mason Science College was founded by Kidderminster-born Josiah Mason in 1875. From humble beginnings, Mason made his fortune by mass-producing key rings, pens, pen nibs and electroplating.\n\nHe became one of the country\u2019s most esteemed industrialists and philanthropists and was knighted for his generosity in establishing a great orphanage in the suburb of Erdington. The College became Mason University College in 1898 with the Rt Hon Joseph Chamberlain MP becoming the President of its Court of Governors.\n\nThe socio-political landscape\n\nTo set the scene, at this time, England\u2019s only other independent universities were in Oxford, Cambridge, Durham and London. While compulsory education had been introduced in 1880 for children between the ages of five and ten years old, most of the population entered work by the age of 14.\n\nJoseph Chamberlain was acutely aware of these limiting factors when he proposed the establishment of the University of Birmingham. He sought to provide \u2018a great school of universal instruction\u2019, so that \u2018the most important work of original research should be continuously carried on under most favourable circumstances\u2019. It was his ambition that \u2018the individual trades of the new University [would] forever associate their name and their industry with this new institution\u2019. Many aspects of Chamberlain\u2019s vision continue to inspire and guide the University today, including our continuing responsibilities to, and aspirations within, our region; providing a skilled, professional workforce and ground-breaking research that benefits regional industries.\n\nEstablishing the University\n\nChamberlain\u2019s impact on the city of Birmingham, beyond the establishment of the University, was immense, particularly in his improvements to living conditions and education. Thanks to Chamberlain's tireless work, the University was granted a Royal Charter by Queen Victoria on 24 March 1900 - and with the generous donation of land and funds, the University of Birmingham was born. Since then we have led the way with research discoveries and Nobel Prize-winners.\n\nPreserving and researching our history\n\nWhile we highlight Chamberlain\u2019s legacy in terms of the impact on establishing our University as a centre of education for the many, we are committed to encouraging our expert historical researchers to reflect on our past and acknowledge contested narratives."}, {"url": "https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/216663", "page_content": "Sir Josiah Mason ( February 23 , 1795 - June 16 , 1881 ) was an English pen-manufacturer.\n\nMason was born in Mill Street, Kidderminster , the son of a carpet-weaver.
