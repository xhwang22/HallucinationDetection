Bassett is nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actress for her role in \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\" (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Everyone but Angela Bassett is a first-time Oscar nominee, and even she is a first-timer in this category. But while Bassett seemingly has this locked up , there is a stunning breadth of experience among the supporting actress nominees, showing that breakout moments aren\u2019t exclusively the territory of the very young.\n\nAll will be celebrated during Sunday\u2019s Academy Awards ceremony , which airs live on ABC beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern. And there\u2019s still time to catch up on their performances before the show.\n\nHere\u2019s a bit more about this year\u2019s contenders.\n\nIt\u2019s been 29 years since Angela Bassett\u2019s last Oscar nomination, for playing Tina Turner in \u201cWhat\u2019s Love Got to Do With It,\u201d and though her nomination for \u201cBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever\u201d was widely expected, it still had a profound effect on her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m literally sitting here holding my head, and holding my heart,\u201d she told the AP nomination morning . \u201cI\u2019m excited, I\u2019m grateful, I\u2019m nervous. I\u2019m going to have to start journaling.\u201d\n\nHer character, Queen Ramonda, she said, \u201cis reflective of what mothers have been doing forever, and also a representation of what Black mothers have been doing \u2014 holding families together. Holding memories, holding wisdom... That\u2019s what she is attempting to do in spite of the trauma she has experienced herself.\u201d\n\nAnd her late co-star Chadwick Boseman has never left her mind.\n\n\u201cThis moment has been so special, it\u2019s been a highlight of my career,\u201d she said. \u201cHe definitely kicked it off.\u201d\n\nAge: 64\n\nNotable Wins: Golden Globes, Critics Choice, Image Awards.\n\nIn Darren Aronofsky\u2019s \u201cThe Whale,\u201d Hong Chau plays best friend and nurse to Brendan Fraser\u2019s obese shut-in professor, his most regular visitor and assertive caregiver. She desperately, unsentimentally prods him to get healthier, to care about himself.\n\n\u201cI guess I just start dreaming up a character,\u201d Chau told the AP about her process. \u201cI start to see flashes of something in my head as I\u2019m reading a script in terms of their appearance, the cadence of their speech.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cThe Whale,\u201d she asked for her character to have tattoos.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really see them in the movie at all,\u201d Chau said. \u201cBut every morning I would sit and get tattoos on both arms and the back of my neck. I don\u2019t think another production would do that.\u201d\n\nAge: 43\n\nKerry Condon\u2019s Siobh\u00e1n occupies an important space in \u201cThe Banshees of Inisherin,\u201d as a kind of voice of reason between the warring ex-friends P\u00e1draic (Colin Farrell) and Colm (Brendan Gleeson). And somewhere in the mess she gets to have her own realization about how she wants to spend the rest of her days \u2014 and it\u2019s not with the \u201cfecking boring\u201d men of Inisherin.\n\n\u201cI tried to play with the idea of somebody who\u2019s hiding how they\u2019re really feeling, and that feeling of depression where you feel like you\u2019re on the verge of tears, but you\u2019re hiding it from everyone,\u201d she said in an interview with IndieWire.\n\nIn accepting her BAFTA award , Condon said Martin McDonagh\u2019s works make her proud to be an Irish woman. McDonagh gave Condon her first major role at 18 in \u201cThe Lieutenant of Inishmore\u201d and then in 2009 she starred in his \u201cThe Cripple of Inishmaan.\u201d\n\nMcDonagh told the AP that Condon is \u201cthe best actress I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\n\nAge: 40\n\nNotable wins: BAFTA\n\nStephanie Hsu was a Broadway veteran with a few TV credits when she worked with the writing and directing duo of Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert for an episode of \u201cNora From Queens.\u201d After that experience, she said, she followed them to Los Angeles and soon after they told her about their idea for \u201cEverything Everywhere All At Once,\u201d in which she gets to play Michelle Yeoh\u2019s daughter and the villainous Jobu.\n\n\u201cThe movie is so special because we could not have possibly expected this to have happened and so we were really able to just throw paint at the wall,\u201d Hsu told The AP. \u201cIt came from a very raw place with zero expectations, only trying to tell the story as deeply and honestly as we can.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThis movie, in so many ways, embodies what I love to do as an artist. So it feels like the most honest handshake I could make with Hollywood.\u201d\n\nAge: 32\n\nNotable Wins: Film Independent Spirit Award (Breakthrough)\n\nJamie Lee Curtis had all but resigned herself to the idea that she was not going to be nominated for an Oscar in her career. She was so shocked to hear her name that she didn\u2019t even notice her friend had taken a picture of the moment that she\u2019d later post on Instagram , writing \u201cTHIS IS WHAT SURPRISE LOOKS LIKE.\u201d\n\nBut the self-proclaimed Nepo baby broke through in the same category her mother Janet Leigh was nominated in (for \u201cPsycho\u201d). One of the best parts of the experience, Curtis told the AP, was that in the short time since the nominations she\u2019s become friends with her fellow nominees.\n\n\u201cFive strangers have become friends,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the surprising and beautiful part of this that I\u2019ve made friends through a competition.\u201d\n\nAge: 64\n\nNotable Wins: Screen Actors Guild\n\n\u2014-\n\nFor more on this year\u2019s Oscars, visit: http://www.apnews.com/academy-awards ."}, {"url": "http://awardsandwinners.com/winner/?mid=/m/03tdlh", "page_content": "1984\n\nNominations 1984 \u00bb Award Nominated Nominated Work Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role Places in the Heart\n\nRole: Margaret Lomax"}, {"url": "https://www.celebsages.com/lindsay-crouse/", "page_content": "Birth Name: Lindsay Ann Crouse Occupation: TV Actress Born In: New York City, New York, USA Birthdate: May 12, 1948 Age: 75 years old (as of 2023) Ethnicity: White Nationality: American Sexuality: Straight\n\nLindsay Crouse was born on the 12th of May, 1948.
