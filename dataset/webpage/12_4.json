(NYSE: WGO), a leading outdoor lifestyle product manufacturer, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Barletta Pontoon Boats (\u201cBarletta\u201d), the industry\u2019s fastest-growing, premium pontoon boat manufacturer, for an initial consideration of $255 million in cash and newly-issued Winnebago Industries shares, plus up to $15 million in Winnebago Industries shares upon the achievement of performance milestones at the end of calendar 2021. Certain growth objectives, if achieved through calendar years 2022 and 2023, provide the opportunity for up to $50 million in additional cash consideration. The transaction extends Winnebago Industries\u2019 marine platform into one of the fastest-growing boating segments, advances the Company\u2019s ongoing evolution into a premier outdoor lifestyle company, and is expected to drive significant financial accretion.\n\nBarletta was founded in 2017 with a focus on high-quality, innovative products, unrivaled service and strong dealer relationships, which has allowed the company to grow rapidly in the pontoon boat segment and establish a strong, differentiated position in the market. The privately-owned company manufactures a portfolio of premium pontoon boats and has a network of 125 dealer locations across the U.S. and Canada with coast-to-coast coverage and significant opportunity for regional expansion. Barletta generated full-year 2020 revenues of $120.6 million and EBITDA of $10.5 million, and expects to deliver full-year 2021 revenues of approximately $214.6 million and EBITDA of $26.4 million. Barletta\u2019s growth trajectory is supported by a strong backlog of orders. The company recently opened a new manufacturing facility in Bristol, Indiana to add production capacity and scale to better meet the demands of its continued growth.\n\n\"The acquisition of Barletta significantly expands Winnebago Industries\u2019 presence in the strong and growing marine market by acquiring the fastest-growing brand within one of the most rapidly-growing boating segments,\" said Winnebago Industries President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Happe. \"Barletta's premium, innovative pontoon boats are a natural fit with our broader brand portfolio, with shared appeal among families looking to create great experiences and memories on land or on water. Barletta's commitment to quality, innovation and service \u2013 the same golden threads that unite all Winnebago Industries brands \u2013 and strong relationships with its dealer partners, has driven tremendous growth, enabling Barletta to become a rising force in the industry in a short period of time. We look forward to leveraging our operational excellence, functional resources and proven expertise in nurturing and growing outdoor lifestyle brands to fuel the organic expansion of Barletta\u2019s product line, market share and margins. We are excited to welcome Barletta\u2019s talented employees to the Winnebago Industries team and believe this transaction positions us well to deliver enhanced growth and significant value creation for employees, customers and shareholders.\u201d\n\nBarletta Pontoon Boats President and Founder Bill Fenech commented, \u201cToday is an exciting day for Barletta, as Winnebago Industries\u2019 track record of cultivating premium outdoor lifestyle brands will allow us to further accelerate our growth, expand our offerings, and gain greater share of the pontoon boat market segment. Our shared values and dedication to creating exceptional outdoor experiences make Winnebago Industries an ideal owner and partner for us. We look forward to continuing to innovate and deliver the highest-quality products, unrivaled customer experience, and win-win partnerships with our dealers as Barletta grows within the Winnebago Industries portfolio.\"\n\nFollowing the close of the transaction, Barletta will operate as a distinct business unit within Winnebago Industries. Winnebago Industries\u2019 public reporting will include the formation of new Marine reporting segment comprised of Barletta and Chris-Craft. Barletta\u2019s manufacturing facilities will remain in Bristol, Indiana. Bill Fenech will continue to lead the Barletta business post-closing as its President.\n\nTransaction Highlights\n\nExtends Winnebago Industries\u2019 Marine Platform into the Highly Attractive Pontoon Market Segment: The acquisition of Barletta broadens Winnebago Industries\u2019 presence in the complementary and growing Marine market. Built on versatility, value and accessibility, pontoon boats represent the largest and one of the fastest-growing boating segments in North America, growing at double-digit CAGR over the past 10 years. As the demand for products by outdoor enthusiasts continues to grow, an expanded marine platform will enable Winnebago Industries to grow its customer reach and further balance its overall portfolio and revenue profile beyond recreational vehicles (RVs). Barletta\u2019s premium pontoons are highly differentiated from Winnebago Industries\u2019 Chris-Craft brand and have very limited dealer overlap with other Winnebago Industries brands. Additionally, the pontoon boat market segment provides an opportunity for Winnebago Industries to leverage the intersections between the RV and marine lifestyles and customer demographics, enhance sales and share best practices across the entire Winnebago Industries enterprise.\n\n\n\nThe acquisition of Barletta broadens Winnebago Industries\u2019 presence in the complementary and growing Marine market.

Known as the eRV2 , the prototype emerged from Winnebago Industries\u2019 original eRV concept vehicle , which debuted at the same event last year.

You can tell the demand is up just by looking at the vast number of new products in the segment, varying from budget two-person campers to ultra-luxurious and expensive motorhomes. One of the largest RV companies, Winnebago, recently celebrated its 500,000th recreational vehicle and it seems the 600,000th will come sooner than expected.\n\nThe Minnesota-based company published its second fiscal quarter 2022 earnings reports earlier this week and noted its revenue grew by $1.2 billion or 29 percent during that period. If that number isn\u2019t impressive enough, the RV manufacturer said it has a $4.37 billion backlog. This backlog includes all accepted orders from dealers which generally have been requested to be shipped within the next six months. However, orders in the backlog generally can be canceled or postponed.\n\nThe motorhome family of models is the largest contributor to this number with $2.21 billion worth of motorhomes waiting to be delivered. The company\u2019s towable models account for another $1.87 billion, while its marine products make for $278,000. Winnebago expects the towable RV backlog to recover relatively fast, but the same can\u2019t be said for the more specific motorized RVs and boats, where supply chain disruptions are still having a great negative effect.\n\nThe good news for the firm is that revenues were up across the board for the second fiscal quarter compared to the same period last year. Deliveries were also way up with virtually every segment in which Winnebago operates registering a positive change compared to the same period last year. For example, 1,786 more towable RVs were delivered to customers and 54 more motorhomes from all classes combined with Class B motorhomes seeing a growth of 15.6 percent.\n\nGallery: Winnebago Revel 4x4 Camper Van"}, {"url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/winnebago-boosts-rv-portfolio-344m-143902266.html", "page_content": "In a bid to boost its portfolio, Winnebago Industries, Inc. WGO recently inked a deal to acquire Indiana-based recreational vehicle (RV) manufacturer, Newmar Corporation, for $344 million.\n\nDeal Details\n\nTotal consideration of the deal is valued at $344 million, which will be funded by a combination of cash and stock, based on Winnebago\u2019s $36.77 closing price on Sep 13. Winnebago will finance the deal with $270 million in cash and 2 million shares of its stock issued to Newmar shareholders. Per the pact, any stock price shortfall \u2014 as of the closing date \u2014 will be compensated by incremental cash payment up to $20 million.\n\nSubject to satisfactory closing conditions and regulatory approvals, the agreement is set for closure in first-quarter fiscal 2020. Upon completion of the deal, Newmar shareholders will hold approximately 6% of Winnebago\u2019s outstanding shares. Newmar will operate as a standalone unit within Winnebago.\n\nDeal Motive\n\nWinnebago, which is a leading producer of RVs in the United States, primarily builds quality motorhomes, travel trailers, fifth wheel products and boats. Newmar, which manufactures luxury motorhomes, seems to be a natural fit in Winnebago\u2019s portfolio of outdoor lifestyle brands. The complementary asset base has been the key driver of the deal.The Newmar buyout adds high-end motorized products to the existing Winnebago brand lineup. The deal will enable the companies to pool their expertise in the region and share their best practices, and bolster the combined entity\u2019s scale and leadership position.\n\nDeal Benefits\n\nThis buyout is likely to bolster Winnebago\u2019s product line and dealer network, and rev up the motor-home segment. The deal will expand Winnebago\u2019s core RV platform, thereby enhancing its position in North American RV landscape.\n\nThe combined entity will have approximately $2.6 billion in pro-forma revenuesand lead to a reduction in debt. The deal is likely to be immediately accretive to its free cash flow and fiscal 2020 EPS. Additionally, the strategic acquisition is expected to lead to significant commercial, financial and operational synergies due to the integration of asset, systems and staff. The deal is also expected to result in cost savings of at least $5 million annually for a period of three years.\n\nWinnebago Gaining From Strategic Buyouts\n\nOn a year-to-date basis, Winnebago has rallied 55.6%, outperforming the industry\u2019s growth of 37.8%. The company also surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. Winnebago has been riding on the strength of its acquisitions, including the buyout of Grand Design and Chris-Craft in 2016 and 2018, respectively. The Grand Design acquisition expanded the existing towable RV product offerings of Winnebago, while the Chris-Craft takeover enabled the company to enter into the marine segment. These acquisitions bolstered the firm\u2019s footprint and diversified portfolio in the outdoor lifestyle market. The Newmar acquisition is also likely to boost the performance of Winnebago.\n\nWill Growth Continue Amid Recession Worries?\n\nThe recreational vehicle industry is influenced by many strong macroeconomic factors and is extremely sensitive to overall strength of the economy, as buying an RV is a large discretionary purchase for majority of customers. With the weakening of the economy, RV sales generally fall sharply, as consumers do not feel confident enough in their financial stability to justify a large recreational purchase.\n\nThe industry has started to show signs of a slowdown, which is considered as an early warning sign of a recession. According to the RV Industry Association, RV unit shipments have declined around 20% so far this year, after declining 4.1% in 2018. Amid such a scenario, RV manufacturing biggie Thor Industries THO is scaling down the production of RVs. Further, LCI Industries LCII has consolidated some of its facilities in view of the slowdown. Headwinds like rising input costs and sluggish demand may impact the near-term performance of Winnebago, which carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nNotably, wholesale shipments of RVs in 2019 are forecast to be 401,200 units, indicating a 17.1% year-over-year decline. Shipments for 2020 are likely to decline 3.5% to about 387,400 units. The industry is at risk from the U.S.-China trade war, with RV components likely to get impacted by tariffs, which would significantly raise prices for manufacturers. The price increase would likely be passed on to consumers, in turn lowering demand.\n\nDespite the cyclical downturn, the industry surely holds promise, as millennials are more inclined to spend on experiences that recreational vehicles can deliver. If the economy stays strong and continues to grow, RV sales will likely get a boost, thereby enhancing the performance of stocks within the industry.\n\nMeanwhile, a better-ranked stock in the RV space is Indiana-headquartered Skyline Champion Corporation SKY, which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe firm builds a variety of manufactured and modular homes, park-model RVs, along with modular buildings. It was formed by the merger of Skyline Corporation and Champion Enterprises Holdings, LLC in June 2018. Skyline Champion, which had generated $1.3 billion revenues last year, is one of the largest homebuilders in America of late.\n\n5 Stocks Set to Double\n\nZacks experts released their picks to gain +100% or more in 2020.

And there are few better examples than the all-new 2022 Journey, a 35-foot-plus diesel pusher that flirts with $400,000. The new travel bus furnishes passengers with a condo-like interior with multiple slide-outs, smart home control, a home theater, a fireplace, and a variety of other comforts and conveniences that many a traveler or camper wouldn't know what to do with.\n\nThe new Journey comes built atop a Freightliner Maxum II XCM chassis powered by a 380-hp 8.9-L Cummins turbo-diesel engine. From the outside, it's your typical Class A RV bus with swooping graphics available in a variety of colors. The most interesting part of the exterior is the outdoor entertainment system that slides out from one of the storage compartments lined up between the axles. It packs a 40-in TV, home theater sound bar and portable Bluetooth subwoofer for game days, starry movie nights and general TV-viewing needs. Buyers can also add an outdoor fridge/freezer to save themselves having to hit \"pause\" and traipse inside.\n\nBig motorhomes like the Journey aren't about putting on exterior appearances, though, and the real story always unfolds inside the door, in this case a passenger-side door with drop-down steps and dedicated awning. Winnebago highlights the most modest 35.5-foot (10.8-m) \"34N\" floor plan in its photos, so that's what we'll stick with, but the Journey will also come in larger 37.8- and 41.3-foot (9.7- and 12.6-m) versions with markedly different layouts.\n\nThe theater seats pictured are available optionally on the base 24N floor plan Winnebago\n\nThe 35-footer relies on three slide-outs to open up the interior, with two of them located across from each other just behind the driver's cab. This vis-a-vis slide-out configuration opens the living room dramatically, and Winnebago makes clear the space is designed for hosting cocktail parties and other types of entertaining.\n\nThe near-full length slide on the passenger side houses a three-seat passenger bench up front, an expandable dining set in the middle, and a residential-style 510-L refrigerator at the rear, before it pushes its way into the bedroom to accommodate a wardrobe. The shorter driver-side slide-out is occupied by a full-cabinet unit topped by a long counter that houses a retractable 50-in smart TV up front and portable dual-burner induction cooktop in the rear corner.\n\nThe sofa sits directly across from the entertainment system, which also includes a sound bar setup. Those who don't need the convertible 48 x 74-in (122 x 188-in) bed that comes part and parcel with the three-seat sofa bench can opt instead for a pair of home theater recliners with built-in cupholders and roomy footrests, making the space a full-on mobile home theater. And should occupants not feel like watching TV, they can lower it away and focus on the view out the window and glow of the electric fireplace below the counter. A standard pair of \"chottomans\" work as footrests and include lifting seat backs to double as chairs.\n\nWatch the pop-up 50-in TV, electric fire or both Winnebago\n\nThe kitchen sink and pull-out counter extension are located on the wall next to the cooktop, creating an L-shaped kitchen that charts the path for the overhead cabinets and microwave/convection oven. An available dishwasher slides in below the sink for buyers who so choose. One nitpick about the kitchen layout is that the fridge gets pushed farther back behind the dining area instead of being directly across from the sink and cooktop. But we suppose you don't want to be dining directly across from the bathroom, either, which is where you'd be if you switched the fridge and dining area. Even huge motorhomes come with some compromises.\n\nThe bathroom between the kitchen and rear bedroom is a dry design that looks almost like it was plucked out of a home. It includes a glass door shower with seat and both wand and rainfall sprayer heads, a central porcelain toilet and a vanity sink surrounded by cabinets.\n\nWinnebago Journey rear king bedroom Winnebago\n\nOwners will find the third slide-out at the rear of the Journey's driver side. It creates a spacious bedroom around the walk-around 72 x 80-in (183 x 203-cm) king bed with power-incline headrest. The full array of storage includes a dresser, two night stands and a clothes closet. A sliding door closes the bedroom off, and a smart TV is there for pre-bedtime entertainment.\n\nMaking the Journey's voluminous interior a little smaller and more connected, the Winnebago Connect system provides monitoring and control of key onboard systems from a centralized touchscreen and smartphones. Using the system, occupants can adjust the temperature all around the motorhome, turn lights on and off and operate the side awning. They can also quickly access information about battery power, tank levels, generator status and more.\n\nThe Winnebago Connect smart control system works on the touchscreen or via mobile app Winnebago\n\nThe Journey living module comes powered by six deep-cycle leisure batteries, a 3,000-W inverter/charger and an 8,000-W Cummins Onan generator with auto-start. It includes dual 15,000-W air conditioners with heat pumps and an Aqua Hot tankless water heater fed by a 397-L fresh water tank. Other coach-wide amenities include a Winegard Air 360+ RV antenna with Wi-Fi router and AT&T SIM card, an available central vacuum system, and available hydronic floor heating.\n\nThe Freightliner driver's cab has swivel armchairs with six-way power adjustability and a 12.3-in infotainment system with navigation, rear color camera and Sirius-XM radio. The 33,400-lb (15,150-kg) chassis rides on an air suspension.\n\nWinnebago debuted the 2022 Journey at this week's Road Ahead event, which also brought the introduction of the new Ekko off-grid motorhome. Pricing will start at a cool $377,181.\n\nSource: Winnebago\n\n"}, {"url": "https://mergr.com/winnebago-industries-acquisitions", "page_content": "Winnebago Industries has acquired 5 companies, including 3 in the last 5 years.

It started life in the late 90s at Bartholomew School in Eynsham , with Ben Perrier (vocals, guitar) and Ben Thomas (then on guitar) writing songs then recruiting a drummer and bass player through an ad. They played their first gig in early 1999 and fired the bass player a few months later, with Ben Thomas switching from guitar to bass. By the summer of 2000, Perrier and Thomas' disatisfaction with their drummer led to his departure, with Thomas switching from bass to drums so the band could continue as a 2-piece. Winnebago Deal now consists of two Bens, Ben Perrier (vocals, guitar) and Ben Thomas (drums).\n\nWinnebago Deal generated strong support from local youth center gigs and many appearances at Oxford's Zodiac club, eventually supporting Fugazi at London's Forum; this led to their first record, the \" Plata O Plomo \" EP in 2003 . They were nominated for the Kerrang Award's 'Best British Newcomer' that year. Soon after, the band signed a recording contract with Double Dragon Music , and produced their debut album \" Dead Gone \" with Jack Endino , producer of the first Nirvana album \" Bleach \". \" Dead Gone \" was released in September 2004 . \"Plata O Plomo\" was reissued in Australia later that year, with an expanded track listing.\n\nThe \"two Bens\" then went on to play as Mondo Generator with Nick Oliveri , former Queens of the Stone Age bassist/vocalist. As well as playing Mondo Generator gigs, they still toured as Winnebago Deal and even supported Mondo Generator , earing them the moniker \"Winnebago Generator\" from fans. After recording tracks at Dave Grohl 's Studio 606 for the next Mondo Generator album with producer Nick Raskulinecz, it was announced in July 2006 that they had left the band for \"undisclosed reasons\".\n\nIn that same month they released their second full-length album \" Flight Of The Raven \", with the band again chosing to record with producer Jack Endino . The album features guest appearances from other artists including band partner Nick Oliveri , Endino, local thugs Paul Morrill and Edward \"Raven\" Heaton from the band Sicarios, and the legendary Rusty Needles of Oxford band Deguello, and was cited as the sixth best album in 2006 by Kerrang! writer Raziq Rauf .

Certain growth objectives, if achieved through calendar years 2022 and 2023, provide the opportunity for up to $50 million in additional cash consideration. The transaction extends Winnebago Industries\u2019 marine platform into one of the fastest-growing boating segments, advances the Company\u2019s ongoing evolution into a premier outdoor lifestyle company, and is expected to drive significant financial accretion.\n\nBarletta was founded in 2017 with a focus on high-quality, innovative products, unrivaled service and strong dealer relationships, which has allowed the company to grow rapidly in the pontoon boat segment and establish a strong, differentiated position in the market. The privately-owned company manufactures a portfolio of premium pontoon boats and has a network of 125 dealer locations across the U.S. and Canada with coast-to-coast coverage and significant opportunity for regional expansion.

Built on versatility, value and accessibility, pontoon boats represent the largest and one of the fastest-growing boating segments in North America, growing at double-digit CAGR over the past 10 years. As the demand for products by outdoor enthusiasts continues to grow, an expanded marine platform will enable Winnebago Industries to grow its customer reach and further balance its overall portfolio and revenue profile beyond recreational vehicles (RVs). Barletta\u2019s premium pontoons are highly differentiated from Winnebago Industries\u2019 Chris-Craft brand and have very limited dealer overlap with other Winnebago Industries brands. Additionally, the pontoon boat market segment provides an opportunity for Winnebago Industries to leverage the intersections between the RV and marine lifestyles and customer demographics, enhance sales and share best practices across the entire Winnebago Industries enterprise.\n\n\n\nThe acquisition of Barletta broadens Winnebago Industries\u2019 presence in the complementary and growing Marine market.

The show is on its 7th season and airs on the Great American Country channel. If you haven't seen the show, it's the same premise as HGTV's House Hunters, but for RVs!\n\nEach episode features a different family and the process they go through while purchasing a brand-new RV. The family shares their list of must-haves, their budget, and looks at three different models. Then comes the suspenseful deliberation scene and the final decision ... and, of course, a happy ending! You get to see the family on their first camping trip and hear how they are liking their choice.\n\nSince the episode aired, we've had so many people want to know all the behind-the-scenes, juicy secrets of reality TV! While we can't share everything, we wanted to write about our overall experience and what the process looked like as the \"on screen talent.\" So, let's start from the beginning, shall we?\n\nGetting Casted\n\nWe'd known a few people who had been on the show before, so it was definitely in the back of our minds when we decided we were going to purchase a brand-new RV. In fact, we met some friends at a campground in Malibu who were on the show and recommended us to the casting director. At the time, though, we were living in our used fifth-wheel and were just beginning the search for our new Winnebago.\n\nWe had a phone conversation with the casting director about what stage of the buying process we were in. Because we hadn't really narrowed down our options, we weren't considered for an interview at that time for Season 6. But, we were encouraged to connect again when we were closer to purchasing. Five months later, we had walked around more dealerships than we could count. We had gone from wanting another fifth-wheel to a travel trailer to a class A, but had finally narrowed our options down to a few specific models.\n\nAround that same time, I saw an advertisement on Facebook from the production company, RIVR media. They were casting for season 7! So, in perfect timing, we filled out a casting application, sent in some photos, and reached out to the casting director again. We had a Skype interview a few days later and received an email that same week informing us that we were chosen. We weren't able to share the news with anyone except close family and friends!\n\nPreparing for Filming\n\nWe had an initial, logistics call with the Supervising Producer very early on. We had about ten different options of dates for filming all spread out between three months. She informed us of the basic process of filming, what to expect, and answered any questions we had. As our shooting dates approached, we had a final phone call where we walked through the schedule of our three filming days.\n\nIt was clear that by Season 7, they had the process down! It was helpful in calming our nerves and made us feel relaxed knowing all we had to do was show up. The only hard part for us was wardrobe! If you know anything about Colorado's weather in the spring, you'll understand.\n\nWe were told we would need to wear the same thing for our two days of filming at the dealership. We were also told that if we chose to wear coats or jackets, we would be required to keep them on the whole time of filming. They like to have 100% consistency with outfits, and wanted the buying process to be featured as one whole day, not split into two, since that is the typical process.\n\nThe funny part was, we were asked to take and send photos of the clothes we planned on wearing a few weeks in advance. They needed to confirm that our clothes had no visible logos for trademark reasons. But, planning in advance for spring in the Rockies is almost impossible. Sure enough, it snowed the first day of filming and was in the 60s the second day. So, sweaters and light jackets were perfect for day one, but a little uncomfortable for day two. But we survived!\n\nLights, Camera, Action!\n\nFirst Day of Filming: The Walk Throughs\n\nWe showed up at the dealership feeling excited but nervous. We had been on camera quite a bit before this, but not for an actual TV show! We met the whole crew right away. There was one producer, two camera men, a sound tech, and a production assistant. There were tons of equipment and snacks ... we of course were thrilled about the snacks!\n\nEveryone was ready to go and they started by putting an action camera in our vehicle so we could drive back up to the lot while discussing our feelings. We reviewed our must-haves, our concerns, and excitement for the day. We then moved quickly into the next scene, which was meeting our sales person and discussing the type of RV we were hoping to purchase.\n\nThe rest of the day was all about looking at the different models of RVs that we had narrowed down. We looked at three different Winnebago motorhomes: the Intent 26M, the Intent 30R, and the Navion 24D. Our budget was $140,000 because as full-timers, this is not just an RV, it's our home.\n\nHere were our overall impressions of each model:\n\nIntent 26M\n\nBeautiful interior and exterior design\n\nLoved the outdoor kitchen\n\nGreat storage\n\nWanted a couch separate from the dining\n\nSpacious bedroom and bathroom\n\nComfortable work space\n\nTV placement felt awkward\n\nGreat length\n\nPlenty of room for guests\n\nNo kitchen pantry\n\nUnder budget\n\nIntent 30R\n\nBeautiful interior and exterior design\n\nLoved the outdoor kitchen\n\nGreat storage\n\nHas separate couch\n\nSpacious bedroom and closet space\n\nSpacious bathroom\n\nA bit longer than we wanted\n\nLindsay was too scared to drive it\n\nPlenty of room for guests\n\nHard to access kitchen pantry\n\nUnder budget\n\nNavion 24D\n\nPerfect length\n\nNo outdoor kitchen\n\nGreat, spacious layout\n\nGreat kitchen counter space\n\nLighting feels a little dark\n\nNo separate bedroom area\n\nHas separate couch from dinette\n\nComfortable work space\n\nSmall bathroom\n\nLimited outdoor storage\n\nLarge kitchen pantry\n\nEasy to drive\n\nOver budget\n\nDiesel engine\n\nThe cameras followed us throughout every little area of each RV to capture our initial reactions and comments. We had to touch, open, and try everything and discuss our impressions. We had a lot of fun and laughs! (If you want to check out these RVs for yourself, you can get more information about the Intent here - including both floorplans listed above. And you can get more information about the Navion here.)\n\nSecond Day of Filming: Driving to the Decision\n\nDay two at the dealership was all about test driving and the final decision. The test drives took quite some time to set up. They had to set up the cameras to film us driving by, install the action cameras to the windshield, and ensure our audio was nice and clear despite the road noises. But, the test drives really helped us with the decision.\n\nTo be honest, we loved all three models and it was such a hard decision. But ultimately, we chose the smaller size and mobility of the Navion. (You can read more about our decision to purchase the Navion in this post.) We like to think it was love at first sight! They filmed us talking through each of the models and sharing why the Navion was eventually the clear choice.\n\nFilming at the Campground\n\nEvery show has to have a happy ending, right? And what's happier than a waterfront campsite, a joyful couple and their dogs, and getting to do the things you love while having the comforts of home. Our last day of filming was all about showcasing our life in our new RV. We set up camp, played with the dogs, fished steps from our RV and showed the cameras the beauty of RV life.\n\nThe shoot wrapped up with interviews about our story and our decision to RV full time. We also talked about how we've been liking the RV so far and if we were happy with our choice. The answer to that is an absolute yes! We have zero regrets and that's very obvious by our photos and stories that we share on our social media and blog.\n\nWe're on TV!\n\nThe episode first aired on August 29th and will replay several more dates in the coming months. You can click here to see the schedule and we'd love it if you watched! It was such a memorable experience and in fact, at times while watching it brought tears to our eyes. Our friends and family were sending us photos of them watching it in their homes and in a small way, it also reminded us of what a great support network we have!\n\nIt meant so much to us that Going RV and RIVR Media captured one of the most important parts of our journey as full-time RVers. They even sent us a DVD so we can hold on to the memory for years to come. If you're considering buying a new RV, we'd highly recommend casting for the show and would love for another couple or family to have the same wonderful experience as we did."}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Winnebago-Deal", "page_content": "Winnebago Deal are a rock music band from Oxford, United Kingdom. They started life in the late 1990s at Bartholomew School in Eynsham, with Ben Perrier (vocals, guitar) and Ben Thomas (then on guitar) writing songs then recruiting a drummer and bass player through an ad. They played their first gig in early 1999 and fired the bass player a few months later, with Ben Thomas switching from guitar to bass. By the summer of 2000, Perrier and Thomas' dissatisfaction with their drummer led to his departure, with Thomas switching from bass to drums so the band could continue as a two-piece. Winnebago Deal now consists of two Bens, Ben Perrier (vocals, guitar) and Ben Thomas (drums).\n\nContents\n\nWinnebago Deal generated strong support from many appearances at Oxford's Zodiac club, eventually supporting Fugazi at London's Forum; this led to their first record, the Plata O Plomo EP in 2003. They were nominated for the Kerrang Award's 'Best British Newcomer' that year. Soon after, the band signed a recording contract with Double Dragon Music, and produced their debut album Dead Gone with Jack Endino, producer of the first Nirvana album Bleach. Dead Gone was released in September 2004. Plata O Plomo was reissued in Australia later that year, with an expanded track listing.\n\nThe \"two Bens\" then went on to play as Mondo Generator with Nick Oliveri, former Queens of the Stone Age bassist\u2013vocalist. As well as playing Mondo Generator gigs, they still toured as Winnebago Deal and even supported Mondo Generator, earning them the moniker \"Winnebago Generator\" from fans. After recording tracks at Dave Grohl's Studio 606 for the next Mondo Generator album with producer Nick Raskulinecz, it was announced in July 2006 that they had left the band for \"undisclosed reasons\".\n\nIn that same month they released their second full-length album Flight Of The Raven, with the band again choosing to record with producer Jack Endino. The album features guest appearances from other artists including band partner Nick Oliveri, Endino, Paul Morrill and Edward \"Raven\" Heaton from the band Sicarios, and Rusty Needles of Oxford band Deguello, and was cited as the sixth best album in 2006 by Kerrang! writer Raziq Rauf.\n\nWinnebago Deal's third full-length album, \"Career Suicide\", was recorded in November 2009 and released a year later."}, {"url": "https://dryheaverecords.bandcamp.com/album/bail-out-ep-2", "page_content": "Digital Album Streaming + Download Includes unlimited streaming via the free Bandcamp app, plus high-quality download in MP3, FLAC and more.

Mixing up hard rock sensibility with high-energy punk rock they cast a suspicious and cynical eye over anybody stupid enough not to appreciate this simple yet solid aesthetic. Surviving a nuclear holocaust of bad fashion, bad ideas and short-lived trends that music in the 21st century has thrown up, the 'Deal always come out unscathed. Why? Because rather than relying on a haircut and five minutes of fame Winnebago Deal stick to something that will always be understood. Playing rock and roll.\n\n\n\nReturning after a four year hiatus Oxford\u2019s bastard sons of noise, Winnebago Deal recently re-united for two sold out, sweaty, chaotic shows that will go down in gig folklore. Swiftly re-affirming their stature as one of the loudest and hardest two piece bands ever conceived, they raised both, Oxford\u2019s Cellar club and London\u2019s, Black Heart to the ground leaving the question on everybody\u2019s lips, \u2018what next?\u2019\u2026 the new \u2018Bail Out EP\u2019, that\u2019s what. \u2018Bail Out\u2019 is four unreleased tracks that are classic \u2018Deal, recorded during the sessions of their punk alter ego The Dresdens. Tales of incarceration, betrayal, revenge and criminal behaviour, all served up with their inimitable rock n\u2019roll fury. Razor sharp, urgent and ultimately infectious, these recordings demonstrate their rawer, punker side whilst still retaining the signature aesthetic that make them so unique.\n\ncredits\n\nreleased April 21, 2014\n\nlicense\n\nall rights reserved"}]}
