Venture capital generally comes from well-off investors, investment banks, and any other financial institutions. Venture capital doesn't always have to be money. In fact, it often comes as technical or managerial expertise. VC is typically allocated to small companies with exceptional growth potential or to those that grow quickly and appear poised to continue to expand.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways Venture capital is a term used to describe financing that is provided to companies and entrepreneurs.\n\nVenture capitalists can provide backing through capital financing, technological expertise, and/or managerial experience.\n\nVC can be provided at different stages of their evolution, although it often involves early and seed round funding.\n\nVenture capital funds manage pooled investments in high-growth opportunities in startups and other early-stage firms and are typically only open to accredited investors.\n\nVenture capital evolved from a niche activity at the end of the Second World War into a sophisticated industry with multiple players that play an important role in spurring innovation.\n\n1:24 Venture Capital\n\nUnderstanding Venture Capital (VC)\n\nAs noted above, VC provides financing to startups and small companies that investors believe have great growth potential. Financing typically comes in the form of private equity (PE) and may also come as some form of expertise, such as technical or managerial experience.\n\nVC deals generally involve the creation of large ownership chunks of a company, which are sold to a few investors through independent limited partnerships. These relationships are established by venture capital firms and may consist of a pool of several similar enterprises.\n\nOne important difference between venture capital and other private equity deals, however, is that venture capital tends to focus on emerging companies seeking substantial funds for the first time, while PE tends to fund larger, more established companies that are seeking an equity infusion or a chance for company founders to transfer some of their ownership stakes.\n\nThe potential for above-average returns is often what attracts venture capitalists despite the risk. For new companies or ventures with limited operating history (under two years), VC is increasingly becoming a popular and essential source for raising money, especially if they lack access to capital markets, bank loans, or other debt instruments. The main downside is that the investors usually get equity in the company, and, thus, a say in company decisions.\n\nHistory of Venture Capital\n\nVenture capital is a subset of private equity. While the roots of PE can be traced back to the 19th century, VC only developed as an industry after the Second World War.\n\nHarvard Business School professor Georges Doriot is generally considered the \"Father of Venture Capital.\" He started the American Research and Development Corporation in 1946 and raised a $3.58 million fund to invest in companies that commercialized technologies developed during WWII.\n\nThe corporation's first investment was in a company that had ambitions to use x-ray technology for cancer treatment. The $200,000 that Doriot invested turned into $1.8 million when the company went public in 1955.\n\nHit From the 2007-2008 Financial Crisis\n\nThe VC industry was impacted by the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Venture capitalists and other institutional investors, who were an important source of capital for many startups and small companies, tightened their purse strings.\n\nThings changed after the end of the Great Recession with the emergence of the unicorn. A unicorn is a private startup whose value is over $1 billion. These companies began attracting a diverse pool of investors seeking big returns in a low-interest-rate environment, including sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) and major PE firms. Their entry resulted in changes to the venture capital ecosystem.\n\n\n\nWestward Expansion\n\nAlthough it was mainly funded by banks located in the Northeast, VC became concentrated on the West Coast after the growth of the tech ecosystem. Fairchild Semiconductor, which was started by eight engineers (the \"traitorous eight\") from William Shockley's Semiconductor Laboratory, is generally considered the first technology company to receive VC funding. It was funded by east coast industrialist Sherman Fairchild of Fairchild Camera & Instrument Corp.\n\nArthur Rock, an investment banker at Hayden, Stone & Co. in New York City, helped facilitate that deal and subsequently started one of the first VC firms in Silicon Valley. Davis & Rock funded some of the most influential technology companies, including Intel and Apple. By 1992, 48% of all investment dollars went into West Coast companies; Northeast Coast industries accounted for just 20%.\n\nAccording to Pitchbook and National Venture Capital Association, the situation has not changed much. During 2022, West Coast companies accounted for more than 37% of all deals (but about 48% of deal value) while the Mid-Atlantic region saw just around 24% of all deals (and approximately 18% of all deal value).\n\n\n\n$160 billion The amount American VC-backed companies raised in 2022.\n\nHelp From Regulations\n\nA series of regulatory innovations further helped popularize venture capital as a funding avenue:\n\nThe first one was a change in the Small Business Investment Act (SBIC) in 1958. It boosted the VC industry by providing tax breaks to investors. In 1978, the Revenue Act was amended to reduce the capital gains tax from 49% to 28%.\n\nThen, in 1979, a change in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) allowed pension funds to invest up to 10% of their assets in small or new businesses. This move led to a flood of investments from rich pension funds.\n\nThis move led to a flood of investments from rich pension funds. The capital gains tax was further reduced to 20% in 1981.\n\nThese three developments catalyzed growth in VC and the 1980s turned into a boom period for venture capital, with funding levels reaching $4.9 billion in 1987. The dot-com boom also brought the industry into sharp focus as venture capitalists chased quick returns from highly-valued internet companies.\n\nAccording to some estimates, funding levels during that period went as high as $30 billion. But the promised returns did not materialize as several publicly-listed internet companies with high valuations crashed and burned their way to bankruptcy.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Venture Capital\n\nVenture capital provides funding to new businesses that do not have access to stock markets and do not have enough cash flow to take on debts. This arrangement can be mutually beneficial because businesses get the capital they need to bootstrap their operations, and investors gain equity in promising companies.\n\nThere are also other benefits to a VC investment. In addition to investment capital, VCs often provide mentoring services to help new companies establish themselves, and provide networking services to help them find talent and advisors. A strong VC backing can be leveraged into further investments.\n\nOn the other hand, a business that accepts VC support can lose creative control over its future direction. VC investors are likely to demand a large share of company equity, and they may start making demands of the company's management as well. Many VCs are only seeking to make a fast, high-return payoff and may pressure the company for a quick exit.\n\nPros Provides early-stage companies with capital to bootstrap operations\n\nCompanies don't need cash flow or assets to secure VC funding\n\nVC-backed mentoring and networking services help new companies secure talent and growth Cons Demand a large share of company equity\n\n\n\nCompanies may find themselves losing creative control as investors demand immediate returns\n\nVCs may pressure companies to exit investments rather than pursue long-term growth\n\nTypes of Venture Capital\n\nVenture capital can be broadly divided according to the growth stage of the company receiving the investment. Generally speaking, the younger a company is, the greater the risk for investors.\n\nThe stages of VC investment are:\n\nPre-Seed: This is the earliest stage of business development when the founders try to turn an idea into a concrete business plan. They may enroll in a business accelerator to secure early funding and mentorship.\n\nThis is the earliest stage of business development when the founders try to turn an idea into a concrete business plan.

Since there are no revenue streams yet, the company will need VCs to fund all of its operations.\n\nThis is the point where a new business seeks to launch its first product. Since there are no revenue streams yet, the company will need VCs to fund all of its operations. Early-Stage Funding: Once a business has developed a product, it will need additional capital to ramp up production and sales before it can become self-funding. The business will then need one or more funding rounds, typically denoted incrementally as Series A, Series B, etc.\n\n\n\nVenture Capital vs. Angel Investors\n\nFor small businesses, or for up-and-coming businesses in emerging industries, venture capital is generally provided by high net-worth individuals (HNWIs)\u2014also often known as angel investors\u2014and venture capital firms. The National Venture Capital Association is an organization composed of hundreds of venture capital firms that offer to fund innovative enterprises.\n\nAngel investors are typically a diverse group of individuals who have amassed their wealth through a variety of sources. However, they tend to be entrepreneurs themselves, or recently retired executives from the business empires they've built.\n\nSelf-made investors providing VC typically share several key characteristics. The majority look to invest in well-managed companies, that have a fully-developed business plan and are poised for substantial growth. These investors are also likely to offer to fund ventures that are involved in the same or similar industries or business sectors with which they are familiar. If they haven't worked in that field, they might have had academic training in it. Another common occurrence among angel investors is co-investing, in which one angel investor funds a venture alongside a trusted friend or associate, often another angel investor.\n\nThe Venture Capital Process\n\nThe first step for any business looking for venture capital is to submit a business plan, either to a venture capital firm or to an angel investor. If interested in the proposal, the firm or the investor must then perform due diligence, which includes a thorough investigation of the company's business model, products, management, and operating history, among other things.\n\nSince venture capital tends to invest larger dollar amounts in fewer companies, this background research is very important. Many venture capital professionals have had prior investment experience, often as equity research analysts while others have a Master in Business Administration (MBA) degree. VC professionals also tend to concentrate on a particular industry. A venture capitalist that specializes in healthcare, for example, may have had prior experience as a healthcare industry analyst.\n\nOnce due diligence has been completed, the firm or the investor will pledge an investment of capital in exchange for equity in the company. These funds may be provided all at once, but more typically the capital is provided in rounds. The firm or investor then takes an active role in the funded company, advising and monitoring its progress before releasing additional funds.\n\nThe investor exits the company after a period of time, typically four to six years after the initial investment, by initiating a merger, acquisition, or initial public offering (IPO).\n\nA Day in the Venture Capital Life\n\nLike most professionals in the financial industry, venture capitalists tend to start their day with a copy of The Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times, and other respected business publications. Venture capitalists who specialize in an industry tend to also subscribe to the trade journals and papers that are specific to that industry. All of this information is often digested each day along with breakfast.\n\nFor the VC professional, most of the rest of the day is filled with meetings. These meetings have a wide variety of participants, including other partners and/or members of their venture capital firm, executives in an existing portfolio company, contacts within the field of specialty, and budding entrepreneurs seeking venture capital.\n\nAt an early morning meeting, for example, there may be a firm-wide discussion of potential portfolio investments. The due diligence team will present the pros and cons of investing in the company. An around-the-table vote may be scheduled for the next day as to whether or not to add the company to the portfolio.\n\nAn afternoon meeting may be held with a current portfolio company. These visits are maintained regularly in order to determine how smoothly the company is running and whether the investment made by the VC firm is being utilized wisely. The venture capitalist is responsible for taking evaluative notes during and after the meeting and circulating the conclusions among the rest of the firm.\n\nAfter spending much of the afternoon writing up that report and reviewing other market news, there may be an early dinner meeting with a group of budding entrepreneurs who are seeking funding for their venture. The venture capital professional gets a sense of what type of potential the emerging company has, and determines whether further meetings with the venture capital firm are warranted.\n\nAfter that dinner meeting, when the venture capitalist finally heads home for the night, they may take along the due diligence report on the company that will be voted on the next day, taking one more chance to review all the essential facts and figures before the morning meeting.\n\nLate-stage financing has become more popular because institutional investors prefer to invest in less-risky ventures (as opposed to early-stage companies where the risk of failure is high).\n\nVenture Capital Trends\n\nThe first VC funding was an attempt to kickstart an industry. To that end, Georges Doriot adhered to a philosophy of actively participating in the startup's progress. He provided funding, counsel, and connections to entrepreneurs.\n\nAn amendment to the SBIC Act in 1958 led to the entry of more novice investors in small businesses and startups. The increase in funding levels for the industry was accompanied by a corresponding increase in the number of failed small businesses. Over time, VC industry participants have coalesced around Doriot's original philosophy of providing counsel and support to entrepreneurs building businesses.\n\nGrowth of Silicon Valley\n\nDue to the industry's proximity to Silicon Valley, the overwhelming majority of deals financed by venture capitalists are in the technology industry\u2014the internet, healthcare, computer hardware and services, and mobile and telecommunications. But other industries have also benefited from VC funding. Notable examples are Staples and Starbucks (SBUX), which both received venture money.\n\nVC is no longer the preserve of elite firms. Institutional investors and established companies also entered the fray. For example, tech behemoths Google and Intel have separate venture funds to invest in emerging technology. In 2019, Starbucks also announced a $100 million venture fund to invest in food startups.\n\nWith an increase in average deal sizes and the presence of more institutional players in the mix, VC has matured over time. The industry now comprises an assortment of players and investor types who invest in different stages of a startup's evolution, depending on their appetite for risk.\n\nLatest Trends\n\nAccording to data from the NVCA and PitchBook, 2022 was marked with both highs and lows for the VC industry. Sweeping momentum in the industry carried through from 2021. But it was primarily centered in the first two quarters. VC activity in the final quarter was 25% of what took place in Q1. The VC industry raised about $160 billion for the entire year.\n\nThe momentum in this report was due in large part to the zero-to-low interest rate environment that followed during the COVID-19 pandemic and because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Silicon Valley Bank was among the rush of institutional investors that began funding startups, particularly in the tech sector. It was very popular with venture capitalists, many of which used the bank to park their cash. But rising rates led to lower deposits by backers, causing winds to shift in the industry. The bank disclosed that it lost about $2 billion from the sale of an investment portfolio, causing customers to pull their money out. The FDIC swept in to take control on March 12.\n\n\n\nWhy Is Venture Capital Important? Innovation and entrepreneurship are the kernels of a capitalist economy. New businesses, however, are often highly-risky and cost-intensive ventures. As a result, external capital is often sought to spread the risk of failure. In return for taking on this risk through investment, investors in new companies are able to obtain equity and voting rights for cents on the potential dollar. Venture capital, therefore, allows startups to get off the ground and founders to fulfill their vision.\n\nWhat Percentage of a Company Do Venture Capitalists Take? Depending on the stage of the company, its prospects, how much is being invested, and the relationship between the investors and the founders, VCs will typically take between 25 and 50% of a new company's ownership.\n\nWhat Is the Difference Between Venture Capital and Private Equity? Venture capital is a subset of private equity. In addition to VC, private equity also includes leveraged buyouts, mezzanine financing, and private placements.\n\nHow Does a VC Differ From an Angel Investor? While both provide money to startup companies, venture capitalists are typically professional investors who invest in a broad portfolio of new companies and provide hands-on guidance and leverage their professional networks to help the new firm. Angel investors, on the other hand, tend to be wealthy individuals who like to invest in new companies more as a hobby or side-project and may not provide the same expert guidance. Angel investors also tend to invest first and are later followed by VCs.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nVenture capital represents an central part of the lifecycle of a new business. Before a company can start earning revenue, it needs enough start-up capital to hire employees, rent facilities, and begin designing a product. This funding is provided by VCs in exchange for a share of the new company's equity.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://dealroom.net/blog/top-venture-capital-firms", "page_content": "Firms - startups and VC funders - now make project management tools like DealRoom a central part of their due diligence process . This is the DealRoom overview of the world\u2019s top 15 venture capital firms in 2023.\n\nIn the space of 10 years, venture capital has evolved more in the past decade than it did in the previous three. DealRoom has been witness to and catalyst in this evolution. There is no longer a \u2018catch as catch can\u2019 culture in venture capital.\n\nThe title of a 2021 Economist article , \u201cthe bright new age of venture capital,\u201d seems to perfectly capture a reality about venture capital that is rarely commented on: Venture capital as a concept is still in its infancy. The industry is only limited by people\u2019s drive for new ideas. Not only are American venture capital firms becoming more effective in churning out innovative startups, but the industry is growing apace in regions like Africa, Asia, and Latin America.\n\nVenture capital is a form of private equity financing where the investment focus is startups, early-stage and emerging companies. The financing is provided by venture capital firms or funds, who seek to invest in companies within these categories that they believe have high growth potential due to something innovative about their business model.\n\nAt the VC stage, the startups, early-stage and emerging companies usually require investment to fund their growth ambitions, which is beyond their present ability to generate cash.\n\nHow Does Venture Capital Work?\n\nThe end goal for venture capital is for investor capital to flow to the best ideas.\n\nThis brings benefits for the startup founders and their employees, the venture capital investors, and often society at large, who gain access to a new product or service that enhances their quality of life. Getting the process right, and ensuring capital flows to the ideas that will succeed, goes well beyond just investor returns.\n\nBelow, we look at the process for investors and startups.\n\nThe venture capital process for investors\n\nThe rise of the venture capital industry, and the countless financial press coverage given to unicorns (startups that achieve valuations of $1 billion or more before an IPO), means the big venture capital firms receive hundreds of applications for funding every week. Look at the website of any venture capital fund, and they outline what they\u2019re looking for (revenue, technology, industry, etc.) to filter out as many unsuitable companies as possible. This is the beginning of the VC investor process\u2026\n\n1. Screening\n\nThe process through which VC investors work their way through the thousands of applications for funding is known as screening. This involves a designated analyst looking through startup pitch decks, and filter out what appear, at first glance, to be the best candidates for investment (usually around 15-20% of the pile).\n\n2. Partner review\n\nOnce a company has made it past screening, an analyst passes the pitch deck to the VC fund\u2019s partners who provide a second, more rigorous set of criteria. Getting past this stage is arguably the hardest of all, as impressing the people who\u2019ve got the ability to write checks is key in VC funding.\n\n3. Initial meeting\n\nAs the name suggests, this is where the VC firm meets the startup founder and his/her leadership team. More than a \u2018getting to know you\u2019 meeting, as would be the case with a regular first interview, this ia \u2018do I want to invest in you\u2019 meeting.\n\n4. Internal review\n\nHaving met the startup founders and familiarized themselves with the business model, the partners of the VC firm will hold an internal review - usually once every two-four weeks, to discuss the companies that they see having the most potential. They\u2019ll also use these reviews to discuss potential offers to the startups they\u2019ve seen.\n\n5. Due diligence\n\n\u200dDue diligence in venture capital is a complex process, whereby the VC firm will \u2018look under the hood\u2019 of the startup, understanding the business better, and seeing where the company\u2019s risks and opportunities are. With several due diligence processes running at once, the VC firm is likely to conduct this process using technology.\n\nAdditionally, get yourself a copy of our venture capital due diligence checklist VCs use to evaluate companies.\n\n6. Investment committee\n\nThe results of the due diligence process of each of the potential investments are brought before the investment committee - usually comprising the partners, some external advisors, managers, and other select individuals - to give the final verdict, and decide which companies are worthy of an offer.\n\n7. Closing\n\nAn offer is made to the startup, and a term sheet is drawn up outlining the terms of the deal. The money is transferred to the startup, and their post-money period begins, with the VC firm on-board.\n\nVenture Capital Process for startups\n\nNaturally, the funding process for the startup firm mirrors that of the VC fund in some respects.\n\nFor most startup firms, there\u2019s a steep learning curve, where not only is the founding team trying to iron out the early difficulties that the company experiences, but also trying to put together a winning pitch deck (itself no easy feat). To learn more, see what are the 7 crucial steps to take before a VC fundraising round.\n\nThe steps generally taken by startup firms to achieve VC funding follow:\n\n1. Prepare documents\n\nThe documents that a startup company prepares are how it communicates its value to investors. Although each startup is different, a typical group of startup documents will comprise an elevator pitch, a one-page teaser, a business plan and pitch deck (most relevant of all).\n\n2. Acquire technology\n\nWhen these documents have been completed, it\u2019s important that they\u2019re shared with the right people through the right channels. This means using a virtual data room, and enabling interested investors to see your documents - and more importantly, that you\u2019ve got your sh*t together.\n\n3. Know your terms\n\nAlthough the business plan and pitch deck should outline the company\u2019s sources and uses of funds, it\u2019s important for the founder to know what terms the company can stretch to - usually translated to: \u201cHow much equity can we give away for the funding being sought?\u201d\n\n4. Select suitable VC firms\n\nThere is an expanding universe of VC firms, and it\u2019s important for the startup to choose carefully among them. Although the immediate concern is bringing a cash investment into the company, it\u2019s important for the founder to remember that the investor\u2019s equity share means they\u2019re going to have some input into the management of the company. So they need to be suitable.\n\n5. Field responses\n\nStartup founders, at least those at startups that have potential, will usually talk to several VC investors at once. This is a good opportunity to learn what VC investors ask, where the holes are in the business model, and how the documents can be improved. The models can subsequently be updated in the virtual data room.\n\n6. Review term sheets\n\nAssuming there is interest from the VC side, the startup will receive an offer (or several offers). It\u2019s then their turn to decide which, if any, offers should be accepted, carefully reading through the terms with a lawyer, and seeing what impact any investment would have on the company\u2019s capitalization table.\n\n7. Due diligence\n\nIt\u2019s important for the startup to make the due diligence process as simple as possible for the VC firm. Not only will the VC firm be looking at the documents and the business, they\u2019ll also have an eye on how easy it is to deal with the startup during the process. Again, technology makes it easier on everyone here.\n\n8. Closing\n\nAssuming the company passes due diligence, the startup\u2019s management team can decide whether or not to accept the VC fund\u2019s offer to acquire equity. As soon as they sign on the dotted line, the funds are transferred and the partnership begins."}, {"url": "https://hbr.org/2021/03/how-venture-capitalists-make-decisions", "page_content": "Over the past 30 years, venture capital has been a vital source of financing for high-growth start-ups. Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Gilead Sciences, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Whole Foods, and countless other innovative companies owe their early success in part to the capital and coaching provided by VCs. Venture capital has become an essential driver of economic value. Consider that in 2015 public companies that had received VC backing accounted for 20% of the market capitalization and 44% of the research and development spending of U.S. public companies.\n\nDespite all that, little is known about what VCs actually do and how they create value. To be sure, most of us have the broad sense that they fill a crucial market need by connecting entrepreneurs who have good ideas but no money with investors who have money but no ideas. But while the companies that VCs fund may make headlines and transform entire industries, venture capitalists themselves often prefer to remain in the background, shrouded in mystery.\n\nTo pull back the curtain, we recently surveyed the vast majority of leading VC firms. Specifically, we asked about how they source deals, select and structure investments, manage portfolio companies post-investment, organize themselves, and manage their relationships with limited partners (who provide the capital VCs invest). We received responses from almost 900 venture capitalists and followed up with several dozen interviews\u2014making our survey of VCs the most comprehensive to date.\n\nAbout the Research To solicit respondents to our survey, we used alumni databases from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Harvard Business School, and the Stanford Graduate School of Business. According to a study by Pitchbook, more than 40% of the VCs with MBAs graduated from one of those schools. We also tapped the Kauffman Fellows program\u2019s data on its VC alumni. The National Venture Capital Association generously gave us a list of its individual members. Finally, we used the contact information of VCs in the VentureSource database. We administered the survey between November 2015 and March 2016. The survey was fully confidential, and all the reported results are based on an aggregation of many responses to exclude the possibility of inferring any specific respondent\u2019s answers. However, the survey was not anonymous, and we matched the respondents with VentureSource and other data sources.\n\nOur findings are useful not just for entrepreneurs hoping to raise money. They also offer insights to educators training the next generation of founders and investors; leaders of existing companies seeking to emulate the VC process; policy makers trying to build start-up ecosystems; and university officials who hope to commercialize innovations developed in their schools.\n\nHunting for Deals\n\nThe first task a VC faces is connecting with start-ups that are looking for funding\u2014a process known in the industry as \u201cgenerating deal flow.\u201d Jim Breyer, the founder of Breyer Capital and the first VC investor in Facebook, believes high-quality deal flow is essential to strong returns. What\u2019s his primary source of leads? \u201cI\u2019ve found that the best deals often come from my network of trusted investors, entrepreneurs, and professors,\u201d he told us. \u201cMy peers and partners help me quickly sift through opportunities and prioritize those I should take seriously. Help from experts goes a long way in generating quantity and then narrowing down for quality.\u201d\n\nBreyer\u2019s approach is a common one. According to our survey, more than 30% of deals come from leads from VCs\u2019 former colleagues or work acquaintances. Other contacts also play a role: 20% of deals come from referrals by other investors, and 8% from referrals by existing portfolio companies. Only 10% result from cold email pitches by company management. But almost 30% are generated by VCs initiating contact with entrepreneurs. As Rick Heitzmann of FirstMark told us, \u201cWe believe that the best opportunities don\u2019t always walk into our office. We identify and research megatrends and proactively reach out to those entrepreneurs who share a vision of where the world is going.\u201d\n\nWhat these results reveal is just how difficult it can be for entrepreneurs who are not connected to the right social and professional circles to get funding. Few deals are produced by founders who beat a path to a VC\u2019s door without any connection. Some of the VC executives we interviewed acknowledged the downsides of this reality: that the need to be plugged into certain networks can disadvantage entrepreneurs who aren\u2019t white men. Nonetheless, many VCs felt the situation was improving. For instance, Theresia Gouw, an early investor in Trulia and a founding partner at Acrew Capital, told us, \u201cWhile historically there have been significant roadblocks for women and underrepresented minorities to break into these networks, the industry has begun to recognize the missed opportunities and talent these groups represent. Firms have prioritized diversifying their partnerships, and as a result these networks are becoming increasingly easier to penetrate.\u201d\n\nNarrowing the Funnel\n\nEven for entrepreneurs who do gain access to a VC, the odds of securing funding are exceedingly low. Our survey found that for each deal a VC firm eventually closes, the firm considers, on average, 101 opportunities. Twenty-eight of those opportunities will lead to a meeting with management; 10 will be reviewed at a partner meeting; 4.8 will proceed to due diligence; 1.7 will move on to the negotiation of a term sheet with the start-up; and only one will actually be funded. A typical deal takes 83 days to close, and firms reported spending an average of 118 hours on due diligence during that period, making calls to an average of 10 references.\n\nFew VCs use standard financial-analysis techniques to assess deals. The most commonly used metric is simply the cash returned from the deal as a multiple of the cash invested.\n\nThough VCs reject far more deals than they accept, they can be very aggressive when they spot a company they like. Vinod Khosla, a cofounder of Sun Microsystems and the founder of Khosla Ventures, told us that the power dynamic can quickly flip when VCs become excited about a start-up, particularly if it has offers from other firms. \u201cThe best start-ups with inspiring entrepreneurs have intense competition to fund them,\u201d he explained. \u201cFor VCs, having a clear message about what you will and will not do, how you provide real venture assistance, and how you approach bold visions is key to winning these types of opportunities. And they matter tremendously for fund returns.\u201d\n\nWhat factors do VCs consider as they go through the winnowing process? One framework suggests that VCs favor either the \u201cjockey\u201d or the \u201chorse.\u201d (The entrepreneurial team is the jockey, and the start-up\u2019s strategy and business model are the horse.) Our survey found that VCs believe both the jockey and the horse are necessary\u2014but ultimately deem the founding management team to be more critical. As the legendary VC investor Peter Thiel told us, \u201cWe live and die by our founders.\u201d\n\nIndeed, in our survey founders were cited the most frequently\u2014by 95% of VC firms\u2014as an important factor in decisions to pursue deals. The business model was cited as an important factor by 74% of firms, the market by 68%, and the industry by 31%.\n\nInterestingly, the company\u2019s valuation was only the fifth most-cited factor in decisions about which deals to pursue. Indeed, while CFOs of large companies generally use discounted cash flow (DCF) analyses to evaluate investment opportunities, few VCs use DCF or other standard financial-analysis techniques to assess deals. Instead, by far the most commonly used metric is cash-on-cash return or, equivalently, multiple of invested capital\u2014simply the cash returned from the investment as a multiple of the cash invested. The next most commonly used metric is the annualized internal rate of return (IRR) a deal generates. Almost none of the VCs adjusted their target returns for systematic (or market) risk\u2014a mainstay of MBA textbooks and a well-established practice of corporate decision-makers. Strikingly, 9% of the respondents in our survey did not use any quantitative deal-evaluation metric. Consistent with this, 20% of all VCs and 31% of early-stage VCs reported that they do not forecast company financials at all when they make an investment.\n\nPablo Boneu/BABEL \u2022 SP \u2022 NY\n\nWhat explains this disregard for traditional financial evaluation? VCs understand that their most successful M&A and IPO exits are the real driver of their returns. Although most investments yield very little, a successful exit can generate a 100-fold return. Because exits vary so much, VCs focus on finding companies that have the potential for big exits rather than on estimating near-term cash flows. As J.P. Gan of INCE Capital explained to us, \u201cSuccessful VC deals take a long time to develop, mature, and exit. We very much focus on potential return multiple rather than on NPV or IRR at the time of investment. IRR is only calculated after the fact, when there is an exit for our limited partners.\u201d\n\nAfter the Handshake\n\nTo aspiring entrepreneurs, the typical VC term sheet often seems to be written in a foreign language. Of course, it\u2019s critical for company founders to understand these contracts. They\u2019re designed to ensure that the entrepreneur will do very well financially if he or she performs but that investors can take control of the business if the entrepreneur doesn\u2019t deliver. Prior studies of VC investment terms show that VCs accomplish that through the careful allocation of cash flow rights (the financial upside that gives founders incentives to perform), control rights (the board and voting rights that allow VCs to intervene if needed), liquidation rights (the distribution of the payoff if the company flounders and has to be sold), and employment terms, particularly vesting (which gives entrepreneurs incentives both to perform and to stay at the company). In general, deals are structured so that entrepreneurs who hit specific milestones retain control and reap monetary rewards. If they miss those milestones, however, the VCs can bring in new management and change direction.\n\nLess is known, however, about which investment terms are most critical to VCs and how they make trade-offs among them. So in our survey we asked which ones they used and which ones they were willing to negotiate.\n\nWe asked VCs what contributed most to the success or failure of their portfolio companies. The management team was identified as the most important factor by far.\n\nThe VCs indicated that they were relatively inflexible on pro rata investment rights, liquidation preferences, and antidilution rights (which protect their potential economic upside) as well as on the vesting of the founders\u2019 equity, the company\u2019s valuation, and board control (which is often seen as the most important control mechanism). As one VC put it, pro rata rights, which allow VCs to acquire an additional stake in a company, were paramount because \u201cthe biggest source of our returns is our ability to double down on our winners.\u201d VCs were more flexible on the option pool, participation rights, investment amount, redemption rights, and, in particular, dividends. Many of those terms have a smaller effect on the potential returns of the VCs and hence are more likely to be negotiable.\n\nNonetheless, many VCs try not to focus too narrowly on financial terms during their courtship with start-ups\u2014and give equal emphasis to how the company fits into their portfolios and why their experience and expertise can help the founding management team. As Khosla explained to us, \u201cTo attract the best entrepreneurs, it\u2019s important to have a clear point of view beyond just making money. What are you as a venture firm trying to do, and does it align with what the entrepreneurs\u2019 vision is?\u201d\n\nFinding Alpha\n\nOnce VCs have put money into a company, they roll up their sleeves and become active advisers. VCs told us that they \u201cinteract substantially\u201d with 60% of their portfolio companies at least once a week and with 28% multiple times a week. They provide a large number of post-investment services: strategic guidance (given to 87% of their portfolio companies), connections to other investors (72%), connections to customers (69%), operational guidance (65%), help hiring board members (58%), and help hiring employees (46%). Intensive advisory activities are the main mechanism VCs use to add value to their portfolio companies. (Surveys reveal that this is also true for private equity investors.) Jon Callaghan of True Ventures says his firm believes that advisory services play such a crucial role in attracting the best entrepreneurs that it has spent 15 years and $10 million developing them. \u201cWe do this because we\u2019ve learned time and time again that the founders are key to building and leading the teams that create the biggest outcomes in venture capital,\u201d he notes.\n\nThe top VC funds make a spectacular amount of money. Yet a definitive explanation for how VCs deliver \u201calpha,\u201d or positive risk-adjusted returns, has yet to be articulated. We decided to ask the VCs directly\u2014having them assess the relative importance of deal sourcing, deal selection, and post-investment actions to the creation of value in their portfolios. A plurality reported that while all three were key, deal selection was the most critical.\n\nA Venture Capital Glossary Antidilution rights allow the number of shares that current investors hold to be adjusted if future financing rounds are done at a lower price than the current round. Liquidation rights ensure that if a company is sold, the venture capitalists get paid before the founders do. They typically guarantee the amount invested or some multiple of it (for example, double). Option pool refers to an amount of equity set aside for grants to compensate current and future employees of the start-up. Usually it\u2019s a percentage of the company\u2019s total value. Participation rights allow venture capitalists to get back the face value of their investment (or a multiple of it) and then to share in the value created above that level at the time of a company exit. Pro rata investment rights give venture capitalists the right to invest in a company\u2019s subsequent investment rounds and preserve their initial percentage of ownership. Redemption rights give venture capitalists the ability to return stock to the company\u2014that is, force it to pay back the amount of the investment.\n\nWe also asked VCs what contributed most to the success or failure of their portfolio companies. Again, the management team was identified as the most important factor by far. As Brian Jacobs, a cofounder of Emergence Capital, told us: \u201cI have never seen a venture success for which one person deserves all the credit. The winners always seem to be the founders who can build a kick-ass team.\u201d Other factors the VCs cited included timing, luck, technology, business model, and industry, which they rated roughly equal in importance. Perhaps surprisingly, they didn\u2019t cite their own contributions as a major source of success. These answers suggest that it is entrepreneurs rather than VCs who create the most value for start-ups. One VC executive put it this way: \u201cOur firm puts a huge amount of work into helping our companies\u2014everything from assisting with hiring to acting as the founder\u2019s psychologist. But in the end the real success or failure of a venture comes from the founders.\u201d\n\nThe VC Way\n\nTourists who drive along Sand Hill Road in Palo Alto\u2014the street where many of the leading multibillion-dollar venture capital funds are located\u2014are often shocked to find only small, conventionally designed offices set discreetly behind leafy trees. The modest offices only add to the air of mystery around how exactly these firms are structured and operate.\n\nIn our survey the average VC firm had just 14 employees and five senior investment professionals. This pocket-sized, flat structure allows for quick decision-making and action\u2014but perhaps fewer checks and balances.\n\nPablo Boneu/BABEL \u2022 SP \u2022 NY\n\nAlthough they worked more than traditional banking hours, most VCs in our survey reported that their workweek was by no means excessive. On average, they put 55 hours a week in on the job, spending 22 hours a week networking and sourcing deals and 18 hours working with portfolio companies. In a recent update to our survey, done during a peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, we found that while VCs\u2019 pace of investment had slowed slightly, venture capitalists were allocating their time in roughly the same way\u2014pursuing new deals, performing due diligence, closing new investments, and helping portfolio companies.\n\nFinally, we asked about their interactions with their limited partners. The majority said that they believed their investors cared more about absolute performance than about relative performance. Nevertheless, the vast majority (93%) of VCs said that they expected to beat the market on a relative basis. That optimism is understandable. As of June 2020 the VC funds raised from 2007 to 2016 in the Burgiss Manager Universe had outperformed the Russell 2000 (a small-cap index) by 7% a year, on average, and the S&P 500 by nearly 5% a year. Almost 75% of those funds had beaten the Russell 2000, and roughly 60% had beaten the S&P 500.\n\n. . .\n\nHow can these findings be used in practice? For academics, our results offer a good base from which to further explore the nature and relative importance of deal sourcing, deal selection, and post-investment support services.\n\nIn addition, the preeminence of the founding team in the minds of VCs points to a potentially fruitful area of research for academics: Are there experiences or attitudes that define the people likely to be successful founders?\n\nOur survey results also offer critical takeaways to entrepreneurs. Because VCs rely on their networks to source opportunities, entrepreneurs should research who belongs to a VC\u2019s network and try to get an introduction from someone in it. Because the management team weighs so heavily in investment decisions, entrepreneurs should think carefully about how to present themselves in the best possible light when they do meet a VC. Because VCs look at more than 100 opportunities for every one they invest in, entrepreneurs should be prepared to pitch to many VCs.\n\nAs noted earlier, entrepreneurs who are not plugged into venture networks may face hurdles. Those entrepreneurs may include not only founders of color and female company builders but also those who live in regions outside the traditional hubs of venture capital, such as Silicon Valley, London, Boston, and Beijing. Sarah Kunst, the managing director of Cleo Capital, noted that years of success funding entrepreneurs in VC hubs have made the barriers to entry even higher for nontraditional founders. \u201cOur networks are often a reflection of where we live and where we\u2019ve worked. When certain groups are consistently disenfranchised, there is a cumulative network debt that accrues that can\u2019t be quickly overcome,\u201d she said, adding that even minorities who live in VC hubs are at a disadvantage. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been underpromoted at every job you\u2019ve ever had, your title might be several levels below your work experience, and your peers might not be in C-suites where they could hire you or appoint you to boards. If you\u2019ve been underpaid, you may not have the free cash flow to join exclusive clubs or angel-invest, and those missed network nodes add up to incalculable losses in career and net worth.\u201d\n\nIt is incumbent upon educators, venture capitalists, and society at large to work to mitigate systemic financial discrimination and ensure that a broader pool of entrepreneurs receives funding and support. There are no easy answers, and research has pointed to a variety of frictions that exist in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. For our part, we hope our research can help entrepreneurs from all backgrounds successfully network with and pitch VCs by understanding the criteria they use to evaluate investments, how they spend their time, what they do on a day-to-day basis, and which factors are most critical in ensuring great returns.\n\nFinally, many corporations have started investment arms over the past decade to try to harness the potential of entrepreneurial activity, and they can learn from the practices of the VC industry. The critical role that the management team and deal sourcing play in determining the success of investments should inform whom they choose to fund\u2014and where and when. The many local policy makers who seek to build sustainable venture capital ecosystems to foster economic growth can likewise benefit from understanding VCs\u2019 tactics. The ability of government leaders and officials to promote high-quality, high-potential entrepreneurs should not be overlooked. Finally, universities are often the source of innovations that end up in the portfolios of VCs. University officials can learn how to better leverage the innovative activity happening within their halls. Building relationships with leading VCs and promoting an entrepreneurial community can help spur start-up activity."}, {"url": "https://www.cbinsights.com/research/top-venture-capital-partners/", "page_content": "100 Biggest Venture Capital Firms & Partners: For a fourth consecutive year, we worked with The New York Times to develop a data-driven ranking of the world's best venture capital partners.

Introduction\n\nIPO underpricing refers to the phenomenon that the initial public offering price of a stock is significantly lower than the initial market closing price of the listing, and this phenomenon is widespread in the capital market. It is generally believed that information asymmetry is one of the main reasons for IPO underpricing. In order to make up for investors who are at an information disadvantage [ 1 2 ], stock issuers will actively reduce the issuance price of stocks to promote the successful issuance of the stocks. In my country, recent study (2014) verified the impact of information asymmetry between issuers and purchasers on IPO underpricing, through empirical methods [ 3 ].\n\nThe \u201cThirteenth Five-Year Plan\u201d clearly proposes to implement an \u201cinnovation-driven development strategy\u201d to promote the sustainable development of enterprises, with technological innovation as the core. Among them, R&D activities, as an important method of innovation realization, can promote the sustainable development of enterprises, and have attracted more and more attention from policy makers and enterprises. Although R&D activities can help enterprises maintain long-term competitive advantages and keep sustainability, they will aggravate the information asymmetry in the process of investment and financing [ 2 4 ]. On this basis, many scholars have carried out research on the correlation between R&D investment and IPO underpricing, and generally believe that R&D investment will increase the degree of company IPO underpricing.\n\nThe majority of companies listed on ChiNext are high-technology companies with high growth potential, and a large number of empirical studies have shown that venture capital plays a role in signaling high-quality equity offerings in the corporate process. This is because venture capital plays a monitoring and certification role, which means venture capitalists can determine which R&D activities are more likely to be successful, and they can provide investors with accurate information about R&D investment and whether the information disclosed at the IPO is true [ 5 ]. Some scholars explores the impact of venture capital on IPO underpricing in a sample of North African companies, arguing that a good reputation for venture capital increases managerial confidence and overvalues the true price of the stock [ 6 ]. Amit et al. argued that only those firms in bad situations tend to seek venture capital support, and venture capital-backed firms, with poor operations and quality, have relatively high IPO underpricing [ 7 ]. Elston and Yang empirically analyzed the effect of venture capital equity structure and accounting standards on IPO underpricing, using German firms as an example [ 8 ]. The findings show that venture capital has a significant effect on IPO underpricing in many countries, such as the U.S., but this finding is not confirmed in Germany. Pennacchio explored the role of venture capitalists in Italian IPO firms and concluded that firms with venture capital support have lower IPO underpricing rates compared to firms without venture capital support [ 9 ]. Gompers found that venture capitalists, especially immature venture capitalists, usually push their invested firms to IPOs earlier [ 10 ], and this improper timing of IPOs can make venture capital-backed firms have higher IPO depression rates [ 11 ]. The above studies, in general, verify that venture capitalists recognize that venture capital investment directly transmits information about the quality of IPO firms, but whether it reduces the uncertainty of R&D activities is unclear because the effect of the interaction of venture capital R&D investment on IPO underpricing is understudied.\n\nCompared with developed countries, China\u2019s venture capital market is at a stage of development, with a small-scale and insufficient standardization. Therefore, it is still unclear whether Chinese venture capital can provide effective support and services to enterprises. However, it is undeniable that if market participants have professional technical knowledge related to R&D, their evaluations of companies will be relatively accurate. Venture capitalists have an advantage in this regard. They can conduct comprehensive investigations of technologies with high risks and high uncertainties. Therefore, given that previous studies have directly tested the impact of venture capital on IPO underpricing, various conclusions have emerged. This article intends to focus on indirect testing of the relationship between venture capital and IPO underpricing, and examine the impact of venture capital on R&D investment and IPO underpricing. Does underpricing have a regulatory effect?\n\nVenture capital syndication is an investment behavior involving many venture capital institutions, which often participate in the equity financing of high-tech enterprises before going public. Compared with individual VC, syndication can not only provide more value-added services for the growth of enterprises [ 12 ], but also deliver good market signals through the authentication and supervision functions, so it is accepted by more and more IPO companies. However, VC syndication may also lead to \u201cfree rider\u201d behavior and aggravation of the type II agency cost [ 13 ], which are both potential factors that trigger information asymmetry in the stock market. Then, as one of the ways of VC investment, will syndication affect the effect of R&D investment on IPO underpricing after entering the enterprise? How do the different characteristics of VC syndication affect them?\n\nMost of the companies listed on ChiNext are high-tech companies. Compared with the main board, and small- and medium-sized companies, they invest more in R&D. Therefore, there is a higher information asymmetry. Whether this asymmetry, caused by R&D investment, will lead to higher IPO underpricing for ChiNext companies is a question worthy of attention. Venture capital, as a professional investment institution, often participates in equity financing of high-tech companies before listing. Joint investment is a syndication of venture capital; due to its good risk dispersion and resource sharing advantages, it is mostly adopted by venture capital institutions. Joint investment is naturally related to the R&D activities of enterprises. Whether its intervention has a moderating effect on the relationship between R&D investment and IPO underpricing, and whether the different characteristics of joint investment will also cause different effects, are issues worthy of discussion and research.\n\nThis article takes the companies successfully listed on ChiNext from 2009 to 2018 as a sample, and uses the literature method and empirical method to study the following issues: (1) the impact of corporate R&D investment on IPO underpricing; (2) the moderating effect of VC syndication between corporate R&D investment and IPO underpricing; (3) the moderating effect of VC syndication on corporate R&D and IPO underpricing depends on the characteristics of it. The innovation of this paper mainly lies in the following: (1) The use of the latest data. In 2014, China began to impose a limit on the rise and fall of new shares. Therefore, it is impossible to use the closing price on the first day of listing after 2014 as the basis for calculating the IPO underpricing rate. This article uses the average of the closing prices on the 5th and 10th day of listing as the calculation of IPO underpricing. The basis of the price rate makes the research results more able to reflect the actual situation in China at present. (2) The selection of adjustment variables is novel. Innovatively introduce VC syndication as a moderating variable between enterprise R&D investment and IPO underpricing, and then further explore whether the length and reputation of leading VC will play a different degree of moderating effect. The previous research on the three variables of R&D investment, VC syndication and IPO underpricing has been expanded to make it more complete."}, {"url": "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220524005552/en/Early-Stage-Venture-Capital-Firm-Ridge-Ventures-Adds-Partner-Akriti-Dokania", "page_content": "SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Ridge Ventures, a seed and early-stage, enterprise-focused venture capital firm whose investments include Bolt, Braze, and Discord, announced that Partner Akriti Dokania has joined its team.

In return, the investor will receive an equity stake in the business in the form of shares.\n\nCompanies that raise venture capital do so for a variety of reasons, including to scale the existing business or to support the development of new products and services. Due to the capital-intensive nature of starting a company, many venture-backed companies will operate at a loss for many years before becoming profitable.\n\nKey Highlights Venture capital firms make private equity investments in disruptive companies with high potential returns over a long-time horizon.\n\nThere are different stages of venture capital financing for companies depending on their phase of growth and objectives.\n\nInvestors in a venture capital firm generate returns when a portfolio company is either acquired by another company or taken public through an initial public offering (IPO).\n\nHow Does Venture Capital Work?\n\nPrivate equity investments are equity investments that are not traded on public exchanges (such as the New York Stock Exchange).\n\nInstitutional and individual investors usually invest in private equity through limited partnership agreements, which allow investors to invest in a variety of venture capital projects while preserving limited liability (of the initial investment).\n\nVenture capital funds are run similarly to private equity funds, where the portfolio of companies they invest in generally falls within a specific sector specialization. For instance, a venture capital fund specializing in the healthcare sector may invest in a portfolio of ten companies focused on disruptive healthcare technologies and equipment.\n\nStructure of a venture capital firm (fund)\n\nA venture capital fund is usually structured in the form of a partnership, where the venture capital firm (and its principals) serve as the general partners and the investors as the limited partners.\n\nLimited partners may include insurance companies, pension funds, university endowment funds, and wealthy individuals, among others. Limited partners are passive investors.\n\nAll the partners have an ownership stake in the venture firm, but the general partners are actually hands-on. They may even serve as managers, advisors, or board representatives to the companies they invest in. These are called portfolio companies.\n\nProfits from the disposition of investments made in the various portfolio companies are split between the general partners and limited partners. The general partners, who are also the private equity fund managers, usually get 20% of the profits as a performance incentive (often called a \u201ccarry\u201d). They may also receive an annual management fee of up to 2% of the total capital invested.\n\nThe other 80% of any profits are divided equally (pro-rata) among the limited partners who invested in the fund.\n\nStages of venture capital financing\n\n1. Pre-seed/accelerator-stage capital\n\nPre-seed-stage is capital provided to an entrepreneur to help them develop an idea. Many entrepreneurs interested in raising venture capital funding will enter business incubators (accelerators), which provide various services and resources for entrepreneurs to connect them with venture firms and networks that will help them develop their business idea and product.\n\n2. Seed-stage capital\n\nSeed-stage capital is the capital provided to help an entrepreneur (or prospective entrepreneur) develop their idea into an early-stage product. Seed stage capital usually funds the research and development (R&D) of new products and services and research into prospective markets.\n\n3. Early-stage capital\n\nEarly-stage capital is venture capital provided to set up initial operation and basic production. Early-stage capital supports product development, marketing, commercial manufacturing, and sales.\n\nThis kind of financing will usually come in the form of a Series A or Series B round.\n\n4. Later-stage capital\n\nLater-stage capital is the venture capital provided after the business generates revenues but before an initial public offering (IPO).\n\nIt includes capital needed for initial expansion (second-stage capital), capital needed for major expansions, product improvement, major marketing campaigns, mergers & acquisitions (third-stage capital), and capital needed to go public (mezzanine or bridge capital).\n\nCharacteristics of Venture Capital\n\n1. Illiquid\n\nVenture capital investments are usually long-term investments and are fairly illiquid compared to market-traded instruments (like stocks or bonds). Unlike publicly traded securities, VC investments don\u2019t offer the option of a short-term payout.\n\nLong-term returns from venture capital investments depend largely on the success of the firm\u2019s portfolio companies, which generate returns either by being acquired or through an IPO.\n\n2. Long-term investment horizon\n\nVenture capital investments feature a structural time lag between the initial investment and the final payout and usually have a time horizon of 10 years. The structural time lag increases the liquidity risk. Therefore, VC investments tend to offer very high (prospective) returns to compensate for this higher-than-normal liquidity risk.\n\n3. Large discrepancy between private and public valuation (market valuation)\n\nUnlike standard investment instruments that are traded on some organized exchange, VC investments are held by private funds. Thus, there is no way for any individual investor in the market to determine the value of the investment.\n\nThe venture fund may also not completely understand how the market values its investment(s). This causes IPOs to be the subject of widespread speculation from both the buy-side and the sell-side.\n\n4. Entrepreneurs lack full information about the market\n\nThe majority of venture capital investing is into innovative projects whose aim is to disrupt the market. Such projects offer potentially very high returns but also come with very high risks. As such, entrepreneurs and VC investors often work in the dark because no one else has done what they are trying to do.\n\n5. Mismatch between entrepreneurs and VC investors\n\nAn entrepreneur and an investor may have very different objectives regarding a project. The entrepreneur may be concerned with the process (i.e., the means), whereas the investor may only be concerned with the return (i.e., the end).\n\nThis can make discussions and general collaboration between entrepreneurs and investors challenging as they may have conflicting objectives around how the company should be run.\n\nVenture Capital Exit Strategies\n\nThe process that allows venture capitalists to realize their returns is called an \u201cexit.\u201d Venture capitalists can exit at different stages and with different exit strategies. A proper decision on how and when to exit also significantly impacts the return of the investment.\n\n1. Secondary market sales\n\nBefore the company goes public, the venture capitalists who invested in the earlier stage can sell their holdings to new investors during the later rounds. Since the shares have not been issued in the public exchanges, the trades take place in the private equity secondary market.\n\n2. Acquisition\n\nAnother exit strategy is for another firm to acquire the investee company. The acquirer is usually a strategic buyer that is interested in the investee company\u2019s growth and technology. Alternatively, a financial buyer could be an acquirer, although this is a little less common.\n\n3. Initial public offering (IPO)\n\nIf the company is operating well and moving to the public exchange, the venture capitalists can take the IPO strategy by selling their portions of shares in the open marketplace after the IPO. There is usually a lock-up period after the initial offering that insiders (including venture capitalists) are not allowed to sell their shares. It is to prevent a decline in the stock price as a result of large numbers of shares flooding into the market. The length of the lock-up period is specified in the contract.\n\nVenture Capital vs. Private Equity Investors\n\nAlthough venture capital and private equity investors are both active in the private equity market by investing in and exiting companies through equity financing, there are still significant differences between the two types of investors.\n\n1. Type of investee companies\n\nOne of the major differences is the type of investee companies. Private equity investors usually buy mature companies that may be undervalued for various reasons. The investee companies are not limited to private ones, as private equity investors can also acquire control of public companies and take them private.\n\nOn the other hand, venture capitalists target start-up companies that demonstrate significant growth potential with innovative technology but require capital financing. The companies are all private and relatively small in size.\n\n2. Size of ownership stake\n\nAnother key difference is that private equity investors usually acquire 100% ownership of the target companies through leveraged buyouts (LBO), financing the cost of acquisition with a significant portion of borrowed money.\n\nHowever, venture capitalists generally purchase no more than 50% of the investee company, mostly through equity investments. This allows the VC firm to diversify its investments into various companies to spread out the risks if a portfolio company fails.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nVenture Debt Course\n\nSeed Financing\n\nUnicorn\n\nSee all capital markets resources"}, {"url": "https://www.starterstory.com/dubai-vc-firms", "page_content": "The 30 Top VC Firms In Dubai [2023]\n\nAre you looking for a VC firm for your Dubai based startup?\n\nVenture capital activity in Dubai is thriving.

Venture Capital is a form of equity financing where investors fund a company in exchange for equity.\n\nThe firm or person making the investments is the venture capitalist. Therefore, the venture capitalist buys a stake in an entrepreneur's idea, nurtures the idea for a short period, before existing. Note that a venture capital fund is not long-term investment. ideally, the venture capitalist invests in the company balance sheet until it reaches a certain size and credibility.\n\nWhat Are The Roles Of A Venture Capital Firm? Typically, good venture capitalists in San Diego provide assistance to startups in many significant ways. The top five roles of VC firms include: General Partners: As general partners, the VC firm is responsible for all fund investment decisions and normally invest their capital in the fund.\n\nVenture Partners: The VC firm will source investment opportunities and they are paid based on the deals they close.\n\nInvestment Principals: The VC firms take the mid-level investment-focused position, and have experience in investment banking or other experience relative to the fund investment strategy.\n\nAssociates: Junior staff experienced in investment banking or management consulting.\n\nEntrepreneur-in-residence: They are industry experts hired as advisors or consultants to the venture capital firm temporarily, and often assist with due diligence or pitching new startup ideas.\n\n\n\nWhat Does A Venture Capitalist Look for When Making an Investment? VC firms look for a competitive advantage in the market. They are interested in their portfolio companies to be able to generate sales and profits before competitors enter the market. Therefore, before putting money into an opportunity, the VC firms want to know if the firm's management is up to the task, that the size of the market opportunity, and whether the product has what it takes to make money. Ideally, all this is to reduce the riskiness of the opportunity."}, {"url": "https://www.smartcapitalmind.com/what-is-a-venture-capital-firm.htm", "page_content": "One additional benefit that a venture capital firm often brings to the table is the ability to create new vendor relationships between its clients. For example, Client A may manufacture an outstanding product, but does not have adequate distribution facilities. Client B possesses excellent distribution technology and facilities and can take over that function at a price that will cut expenses for Client A. The venture capitalist introduces the two clients, who are then able to strike a deal. As a result, both clients experience a healthier bottom line and, at the same time, the firm benefits from the healthier financial outlook of the clients.\n\nWhat sets this type of company apart from other funding sources is that venture capitalists do not tend to be passive in their approach to the task. While many funding agencies will simply loan the money and expect nothing more than repayment according to terms, the venture capital firm will often take an active interest in the setup, operation, marketing, distribution, and sales efforts of the funded company. Generally, the contract between the firm and the client receiving funding will specify the rights and privileges of the firm in regard to involvement in the day-to-day functions of the client.\n\nThe size of a venture capital firm may vary from a small operation that works with a limited amount of seed money supplied by a few investors to a company that includes hundreds of investors and has billions of dollars at its command. However, the size of the firm is not always indicative of the type of venture capital deals that the company will take on. A large firm may choose to devote a portion of its attention to startups along with funding major deals involving the restructuring and renewal of well established international business entities.\n\nVenture capital firms are investment companies that operate only to handle investments in business ventures that may be considered high risk. This type of firm may specialize in working with startup companies that are seeking funds to cover operational expenses until profitability is achieved, or it may focus on rescuing established firms that are in financial trouble but demonstrate some potential for becoming profitable again after some retooling. Some venture capital investment firms will provide funding for both situations, as well as short term projects that fall anywhere along the spectrum.\n\nAfter many years in the teleconferencing industry, Michael decided to embrace his passion for trivia, research, and writing by becoming a full-time freelance writer.

It isn't surprising, though, that the vast majority of them are located in California where there are a lot of computer related start up companies. I think it should be said, too, that most venture capital firms won't take just anyone, even if they do have a good idea. The companies are very selective, and only take 4 or 5 new projects a year. They want to make sure that they have plenty of time to devote to make the projects successful. Because of that, it is imperative that the companies have great ideas that can make a lot of money quickly. Most of the leading venture capital firms won't take any new business that they don't think can get to a point of earning several million dollars a year very quickly. I am really only familiar with the major companies, though. I am curious if smaller venture capital companies exist to support small businesses like new restaurants and things like that.\n\ncardsfan27 January 30, 2012 How are venture capital firms usually compensated for their work? Obviously, they would get repayment of their loan, but is there anything else? Are the loans from a venture capital firm on par with those from a bank, or are they usually a little higher? Given a venture firm's involvement in the business, I am willing to guess that they also get a certain percentage of any profits. I would almost have to think they get some sort of extra payment given their increased role. Also, if they are taking on all this extra risk of start-up businesses that have been turned down by other lenders, there are clearly cases where a business will fail, and they will never get their money back, so they have to make up for that somehow. As far as firms in general, what are the top venture capital firms? Are there any common ones that I may have heard of, or are they generally low key businesses that aren't in the mainstream?\n\nmatthewc23 January 29, 2012 @JimmyT - I don't know if it is a steadfast rule, but I am willing to say you're probably right. If someone is willing to come to a venture capital firm and hand over part of the responsibility for their company to the firm, then it is probably because they couldn't find private capital from other sources. I don't think most start-ups would prefer to be in charge of everything if possible. On the other hand, though, some new businesses might turn to venture capital firms because they actually do need someone who knows more about running a business than they do. They would also get the added benefits that the article mentions of possibly being put in contact with manufacturers and distributors that could increase their profitability. I guess there could be a variety of reasons someone would turn to a venture capital firm.\n\nJimmyT January 28, 2012 Reading the description about using a venture capital firm compared to just getting money from investors, it sounds like maybe venture capital companies are more important for businesses that can't find a way to get money from regular investors. Is that a good assumption? In other words, venture capital firms are more willing to take on riskier companies, hence their increased involvement. I figure that when the companies succeed, though, they are much more successful than regular companies. Just an example I am imagining in my head would be something like Apple or Microsoft. I don't know if it was the case for either of them, but I doubt most investors would have really been willing to put their money into a wild concept like personal computers, but a venture capital firm might have been willing to take the risk with the hope that it worked out and was hugely successful.\n\nPost your comments"}], "Ridzik Enterprises invests in early-stage technology companies.": [{"url": "https://foundershield.com/blog/venture-capital-investing-early-stage-startups/", "page_content": "CB Insights reported that global funding for startups dropped by almost 25% between Q1 and Q2 2022 \u2014 and the reasons for this are endless.

So, which venture capital (VC) firms should you watch out for?\n\nThere is a funder for every solid company \u2014 even during the darkest days. It\u2019s easy when everyone can access investment, but during more uncertain times, you should consider which kind of company you are and test the waters by talking to VCs with dry powder. Here\u2019s a list of some of the top early-stage investors.\n\nEarly-stage investors are more demanding now, but late-stage companies are even more affected. Startups must remember: If VC funds adopt a particularly harsh approach toward late-stage investments, that could trigger a shift to growth startups with smaller deal sizes.\n\nSequoia Capital warned founders that they shouldn\u2019t expect a quick market recovery \u2014 it\u2019s time to cut costs. However, at the same time, some of the most successful startups were founded during recessions, including Microsoft, Airbnb, Slack, Uber, Instagram, and others. This time, the winners will be those able to face head-on the challenges that \u201cmay have been masked during the exuberance and distortions of free capital over the past two years.\u201d\n\nBut why? For starters, the Federal Reserve implemented interest rate hikes to help tackle inflation. As a result, money is expensive to borrow, meaning reduced liquidity and less money for investments. High inflation and tighter monetary policy also affected crypto markets, which are in turmoil after the market collapse in the summer of 2022. Bitcoin (BTC) has been down more than 17% recently, and Ethereum (ETH) nearly 18%.\n\nThere\u2019s been a pull-back on funding, and investors have turned away from companies heavily reliant on capital to stay afloat. Some investors have even stuck their heads in the sand and avoided investing entirely. Furthermore, early-stage startups now face more scrutiny from investors, with sustainable, long-term growth potential being more crucial than ever.\n\nTop 10 Early-Stage Investors for Startups\n\n1.

It follows that, as a proportion of all announced investments, first round fundraises dropped to a new low in Q3 2020.

We help startups scale, guide innovation, and generate discussion in the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence. We\u2019re a venture fund and incubator founded in 2015. We invest in early stage artificial intelligence (AI) and deep technology companies transforming the world\u2019s biggest industries. Our thesis is that AI and Robotics will revolutionize productivity in every vertical and unlock human potential. AI and machine learning technology have matured dramatically in just the past few years. The line of what is possible has been pushed back. However, it has become apparent that introducing AI to traditional industries requires a new and more collaborative approach. We started as a fund focused on investing in AI startups, but quickly understood that AI startups have little trouble raising money. Instead, they have a whole assortment of other common needs and challenges with building their businesses. That\u2019s why we didn\u2019t stop at the fund. We created the Labs programs, each providing an environment in which to build and grow companies. We partner with established industry brands to give startups access to vital resources and knowledge that otherwise would be out of reach. Together, we set up programs to help startups and partners discover new insights about how AI and robotics can transform industries like healthcare, agriculture, construction, transportation, and more. We\u2019re always on the lookout for new thoughts and ideas about how AI will impact our society in the not-so-distant future. We\u2019d love to hear yours.
