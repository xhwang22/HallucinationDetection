They\u2019ve got the midfield, they\u2019ve got everything there. I just don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t take the risk using a future pick if it had to be to get an established ruckman,\u201d the dual premiership Kangaroo said.\n\n\u201cSomeone like (Todd) Goldstein or can you pry a Brodie Grundy? You\u2019re in there now and I know they\u2019re going to be in this window for a long period of time. So I don\u2019t think one or two draft picks over the next couple of years would seriously impact what this group is going to be able to do for I think six to eight years.\u201d\n\nHerald Sun reporter Jon Ralph highlighted that Ladhams\u2019 management made contact with the Bulldogs, but the club\u2019s need to retain draft points to match an early bid on father-son prodigy Sam Darcy limited its capacity to broker a trade.\n\nKing believes the Bulldogs have to maximise their window of opportunity with the current list and deliver more silverware.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got the biggest window of anyone in the competition right now,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t win two premierships in the next six years, it\u2019s a blown opportunity. When you get the list build to correct like this, this is what it afford you, a sustained opportunity.\n\n\u201cIf you asked all 18 coaches which group they\u2019d love to get their hands on, I reckon the Dogs would come out favourably.\u201d\n\n\n\nSt Kilda champion Leigh Montagna thinks the Bulldogs are backing in the natural improvement of English and Jordon Sweet to make them more competitive in the ruck.\n\n\u201cThey were 19 points up in the third quarter of the Grand Final, you give Tim English and Jordon Sweet another 12 months and another pre-season to develop, give them a bit of faith and confidence to develop,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ll be OK without that extra ruckman. When you do get in the window, history shows you do get the chance to play in multiple Grand Finals.\u201d\n\nThe Bulldogs\u2019 depth took a hit in the trade period through the departures of Young (Carlton) and Patrick Lipinski (Collingwood) to rival clubs.\n\nBut they were able to land former Hawk Tim O\u2019Brien as an unrestricted free agent to give their defence a boost, having ranked 14th in the competition in intercept marks in 2021.\n\nO\u2019Brien showed the Dogs first hand how effective he can be in arguably a career-best performance against them in Round 22, gathering 24 disposals, 14 intercepts and six intercept marks with a 24.9 AFL Players Rating \u2013 all of which were rated elite by Champion Data.\n\n\u201cI love the Tim O\u2019Brien addition, they really lack for an interceptor down back,\u201d King said.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the Grand Final when that ball came out of the middle, they really struggled to win it back.\n\n\u201cO\u2019Brien gives you that versatility, it\u2019s worth the risk at no cost.\u201d\n\n"}, {"url": "https://wwos.nine.com.au/afl/news-2023-kane-cornes-and-david-king-clash-over-tom-de-konings-impending-deal-after-shock-omission-carlton-blues/0ff27473-aad7-4836-9b42-559d95cf8312", "page_content": "Apr 28th, 2023\n\nApr 28th, 2023\n\nAFL greats Kane Cornes and David King have clashed over the market value of Blues ruckman Tom De Koning after the young gun was omitted from Carlton's senior team for a second straight week.\n\nDe Koning was managed for the Blues' 22-point loss to St Kilda and has now been named in Carlton's VFL squad for this weekend's match against West Coast.\n\nThe 23-year-old \ufeffis unsigned beyond the 2023 season and has two years remaining before he becomes a free agent in 2026.\n\n\ufeffREAD MORE: Hynes' emotional message amid Green tribute\n\nREAD MORE: Big-money Eels star on verge of code switch\n\nREAD MORE: New detail in AFL great's 'mind-blowing' affair\n\nThe hype surrounding De Koning has been building over the past two seasons with the 23-year-old shouldering a majority of the ruck load in a predominantly unsteady Carlton side.\n\nSt Kilda's pursuit of Carlton big man revealed\n\nNow, the youngster is being \ufefftouted as the pick of the market, with reports of him already attracting big-money offers from Sydney and St Kilda.\n\nDebating the figure on SEN radio, Cornes argued De Koning's skills in the ruck and up forward were highly sought after by rival clubs, which could trigger contracts in the ballpark of $1 million annually.\n\nHowever, King, who has previously said he's not convinced of De Koning's influence so early into his career, believes that being out of Carlton's team will impact his asking price.\n\nTom De Koning.

It\u2019s the way he\u2019s getting around the ground, his touch by foot, his ability to impact forward when he has more support,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey are desperate for someone forward to support, they\u2019ve actually got it, they just need to fill the other pieces.

The Bulldogs are also the best team in the league, both frequency and scoring-wise, at handballing the footy out of stoppage.\n\nBut King said the stats prove how heavily the Dogs rely upon their stoppage brilliance to win them games, adding Sunday provided evidence that Beveridge\u2019s side can be beaten at the coalface, especially if an opposition team has strong rucks.\n\nLuke Beveridge, senior coach of the Bulldogs.

You never get it exactly right\u201d.\n\nWith the substitute rule operating in recent seasons, most coaches would admit to having more than the game demanded.\n\nThey were once reluctant to play two ruckmen under the substitute conditions and if they did, one of them would invariably finish the game in red.\n\nHowever, with the return of four interchange players in 2016, some might now be wondering whether they\u2019ve got enough.\n\nFox Footy analyst David King believes ruckmen will be the greatest beneficiaries of this rule change.\n\nHe predicts coaches will select two ruckmen more often and, specifically, to combat a dominant opposition ruckman.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the Kangaroos\u2019 advantage over the past few years it\u2019s been Todd Goldstein\u2019s ability to play 90 per cent of game time in the ruck,\u201d he told SEN radio.\n\n\u201cNow there will be an ability to double team him because you can rest a ruckman on the bench.\u201d\n\nKing suggested that the cap on rotations would also give coaches greater confidence to play two ruckmen, even if it means playing limited minutes.\n\n\u201cThey can rest for longer and you can still spin the bench at the same pace you have over the last couple of years,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think the challenge would be balancing your rucks. Would you go for one, would you go for one and a makeshift? Or, could you go for a bona fide two ruckmen?\u201d\n\nChampion Data analyst Glenn Luff says some clubs might opt to pick two ruckmen if they don\u2019t have the luxury of a competent part-timer.\n\n\u201cIt depends if you have a player that can actually play forward-ruck and there\u2019s not many that can play it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe all thought Paddy Ryder could go over to Port and play that forward can go into the ruck, but Paddy is a ruckman then a resting forward.\u201d\n\nGeelong has no such restriction with Zac Smith, Rhys Stanley, Nathan Vardy and Mitch Clark at coach Scott\u2019s disposal.\n\nWhile, on the flip side, Essendon has just two pure ruckmen on its senior list plus Shaun McKernan, who is likely to fill a key forward role.\n\n\u201cThey are all athletic and can play centre-half forward, they can play deep forward, they can run in the ruck and almost be an extra on-baller ... I want to see how they go because they are something unique we haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d King said.\n\nHow much ruck depth does your club have and what\u2019s the best combination?\n\nADELAIDE\n\nRucks\n\nSam Jacobs\n\nLuke Lowden\n\nPinch hitters\n\nJosh Jenkins\n\nDeveloping\n\nHarry Dear\n\nPaul Hunter\n\nReilly O\u2019Brien\n\nSam Jacobs is one of the finest tap ruckmen in the AFL and has a mortgage on that position for Adelaide, although he will again be well supported by Josh Jenkins this season \u2014 the duo having played together in all but three matches last year. Luke Lowden has arrived from Hawthorn as back up but it\u2019s unlikely the Jacobs/Jenkins combination will change too much in 2016.\n\nBRISBANE\n\nRucks\n\nStefan Martin\n\nTrent West\n\nPinch hitters\n\nJonathan Freeman\n\nSam Skinner\n\nDeveloping\n\nArchie Smith\n\nThe arrival of Trent West as a replacement for Matthew Leuenberger will provide adequate cover for first choice ruckman Stefan Martin. Justin Leppitsch found room for two ruckmen with the sub rule in 2015 so it appears highly likely he will partner West and Martin in 2016, with rookie Archie Smith not far off the mark.\n\nCARLTON\n\nRucks\n\nDaniel Gorringe\n\nMatthew Kreuzer\n\nAndrew Phillips\n\nCameron Wood\n\nPinch hitters\n\nLevi Casboult\n\nDeveloping\n\nMatt Korcheck\n\nBrendon Bolton looks likely to start the year with Matthew Kreuzer and Levi Casboult in the forward-line with Andrew Phillips in the ruck. Rookie Cameron Wood can be upgrade if needed, while Daniel Gorringe is a viable alternative to Phillips should the former Giant break down or have a slump in form.\n\nMatthew Kreuzer may spend more time forward this year.

Jesse White will provide good support if selected, while Darcy Moore\u2019s development means he is also capable of pinch hitting in the ruck.\n\nESSENDON\n\nRucks\n\nMark Jamar\n\nShaun McKernan\n\nMatthew Leuenberger\n\nPinch hitters\n\nJoe Daniher\n\nDeveloping\n\nGach Nyuon\n\nEssendon signed Mark Jamar because of his mature body and experience, however it may be tough to fit him in the senior team if Matthew Leuenberger and Shaun McKernan are at their best. McKernan rucked in 2015, but the club\u2019s recent additions signal an intention to use him more as a forward.\n\nFREMANTLE\n\nRucks\n\nAaron Sandilands\n\nJack Hannath\n\nJonathon Griffin\n\nZach Clarke\n\nPinch hitters\n\nAlex Pearce\n\nDeveloping\n\nSean Hurley\n\nAaron Sandilands has more hit outs than any other player in the history of the game, but as he nears retirement, Ross Lyon will be keen to hand more games to Jonathon Griffin and Zach Clarke. Griffin has the inside running on Fremantle\u2019s No. 2 ruck spot and will likely partner Sandilands in Round 1.\n\nGEELONG\n\nRucks\n\nNathan Vardy\n\nZac Smith\n\nRhys Stanley\n\nMark Blicavs\n\nPinch hitters\n\nMitch Clark\n\nDeveloping\n\nPadraig Lucey\n\nA fit Geelong ruck division is about the most versatile and exciting in the AFL. Rhys Stanley will be Chris Scott\u2019s primary ruckman, while Mark Blicavs will just alternate between midfielder and wing and be the club\u2019s third man up. Zac Smith and Nathan Vardy are supporting role players rather than front-liners.\n\nRhys Stanley looks primed to take the No. 1 ruck position at the Cats. Photo: Nathan Dyer Source: News Corp Australia\n\nGOLD COAST\n\nRucks\n\nTom Nicholls\n\nDaniel Currie\n\nKeegan Brooksby\n\nPinch hitters\n\nPeter Wright\n\nDeveloping\n\nCameron Loersch\n\nTom Nicholls cemented his status at Gold Coast\u2019s No. 1 in 2015 and his understudy will be one of Daniel Currie or Keegan Brooksby this year. Currie was lured from North Melbourne and is ready-made, while Brooksby played three senior games last year and looks primed for the opportunity.\n\nGWS GIANTS\n\nRucks\n\nShane Mumford\n\nRory Lobb\n\nDawson Simpson\n\nTom Downie\n\nPinch hitters\n\nJonathon Patton\n\nDeveloping\n\nMatthew Flynn\n\nOnly time will tell if Shane Mumford can get back to his dominant best after a season-ending ankle injury in Round 11 last year. Tom Downie and Rory Lobb played the back half of the season in his absence, although the acquisition of Dawson Simpson from Geelong will make competition for spots fierce.\n\nHAWTHORN\n\nRucks\n\nJon Ceglar\n\nBen McEvoy\n\nJack Fitzpatrick\n\nPinch hitters\n\nJarryd Roughead\n\nDeveloping\n\nMark Pittonet\n\nDavid Hale\u2019s retirement opens the door for Jon Ceglar to finally cement his spot in Hawthorn\u2019s best 22. McEvoy and Ceglar appear certain to start the season, with ex-Demon Jack Fitzpatrick adding versatility to the Hawks line-up.\n\nMELBOURNE\n\nRucks\n\nMax Gawn\n\nJake Spencer\n\nPinch hitters\n\nChris Dawes\n\nCameron Pederson\n\nDeveloping\n\nMax King\n\nMitch King\n\nThrough Gawn and Spencer Melbourne has two pure ruckman plus key forwards Dawes and Pederson are capable of contributing in the forward half. Paul Roos used the ruck pair in the same side on just three occasions in 2015, but that could increase this season with a horses for course approach.\n\nNORTH MELBOURNE\n\nRucks\n\nTodd Goldstein\n\nMajak Daw\n\nPinch hitters\n\nBen Brown\n\nDrew Petrie\n\nDeveloping\n\nBraydon Preuss\n\nTodd Goldstein shouldered the vast majority of the ruckwork last year. He was helped by Ben Brown and occasionally Drew Petrie, and it\u2019s hard to see system this changing any time soon.\n\nTodd Goldstein was the premier ruckman in 2015. Photo: Colleen Petch. Source: News Corp Australia\n\nPORT ADELAIDE\n\nRucks\n\nMatthew Lobbe\n\nPinch hitters\n\nCharlie Dixon\n\nDeveloping\n\nBilly Frampton\n\nPaddy Ryder\u2019s suspension leaves the Power a ruckman short heading into 2016. Matthew Lobbe will have to rediscover his 2014 form and rely on Charlie Dixon and even Justin Westhoff for help. Frampton is raw and was plagued by shin injuries last year.\n\nRICHMOND\n\nRucks\n\nIvan Maric\n\nShaun Hampson\n\nPinch hitters\n\nBen Griffiths\n\nTy Vickery\n\nLiam McBean\n\nDeveloping\n\nIvan Soldo\n\nIvan Maric is Richmond\u2019s oldest player and will likely require more support in 2016. This help will come from a combination of Ty Vickery and Ben Griffiths, with Shaun Hampson an able understudy.\n\nST KILDA\n\nRucks\n\nBilly Longer\n\nTom Hickey\n\nLewis Pierce\n\nPinch hitters\n\nJosh Bruce\n\nDeveloping\n\nJason Holmes\n\nBilly Longer usurped Tom Hickey as St Kilda\u2019s first choice ruck option in 2015 and the ex-Brisbane big man will get first crack again this year. As a result, Longer may find Hickey or possibly rookie Jason Holmes alongside him. The Saints significantly prefer Bruce as a permanent forward rather than a part-time ruckman.\n\nSYDNEY\n\nRucks\n\nTom Derickx\n\nToby Nankervis\n\nCallum Sinclair\n\nKurt Tippett\n\nPinch hitters\n\nSam Reid\n\nDeveloping\n\nKyle Galloway\n\nSam Naismith\n\nIt may be a case of one in, one out at Sydney with Mike Pyke\u2019s retirement opening the door for ex-West Coast Eagle Callum Sinclair to assume No. 1 ruck duties alongside Kurt Tippett. Tom Derickx appears the most likely to push Sinclair for a spot in John Longmire\u2019s best 22.\n\nWEST COAST\n\nRucks\n\nJonathan Giles\n\nScott Lycett\n\nNic Naitanui\n\nWest Coast boasts three genuine 200cm ruckmen, with only Nic Naitanui guaranteed a spot in Round 1. Jonathan Giles and Scott Lycett will battle to be Naitanui\u2019s sidekick, however neither big man had overly productive 2015 seasons.\n\nWESTERN BULLDOGS\n\nRucks\n\nWill Minson\n\nTom Campbell\n\nJordan Roughead\n\nPinch hitters\n\nTom Boyd\n\nDeveloping\n\nLuke Goetz\n\nWill Minson and Tom Campbell won\u2019t play in the same team given Jordan Roughead\u2019s and Tom Boyd\u2019s versatility. Both Minson and Campbell have mature bodies and will fight it out to be Luke Beveridge\u2019s first choice ruckman. Roughead will more than likely be used in defence."}, {"url": "https://www.nmfc.com.au/news/688425/afl-this-centurys-best-rucks", "page_content": "Dominant tap specialist or athletic around-the-ground option? The hitout king or the undersized trier?\n\nThe ruckman is the start of everything in our game, so the team at AFL.com.au has looked through every club's records to name the best ruck at each since the turn of the century.\n\nIn making our decisions, we only factored in their form from 2000-onwards. Therefore, the chances of some players could be hindered if they did their best work in the 1990s.\n\nSam Jacobs (184 games from 2011-2019)\n\n'Sauce' joined the Crows from Carlton at the end of 2010 and established himself as one of the premier ruckmen in the competition. He made the Virgin Australia AFL All-Australian squad on three occasions and amassed huge numbers of hitouts feeding the ball to a hungry midfield. He was central to the Crows' rise to the preliminary final in 2012 and continued at a high level, totalling a career-best 996 hitouts in the club's 2017 Grand Final season. Departed Adelaide at the end of last season to join Greater Western Sydney. - Callum Twomey\n\nClark Keating (77 games from 2000-2006)\n\nOthers have had bigger numbers and greater longevity, but a triple premiership ruckman simply couldn't be overlooked. Keating was a September specialist for the Lions. After the 2001 flag, the Queenslander played just nine and eight games in respective 2002 and 2003 home and away seasons due to injury before standing tall in the finals with his bullocking presence. Jamie Charman (129 games) and Beau McDonald (85 games from 2000-2007) also played in flags, while Stefan Martin (126) was a best and fairest winner. Matthew Leuenberger (108) was another considered. - Mitch Cleary\n\nMatthew Kreuzer (189 games from 2008-2020)\n\nKreuzer might have endured a troubled run with injury during his time at Carlton, but his impact when he is on the park can't be questioned. The first selection in the 2007 NAB AFL Draft, Kreuzer is renowned for his follow-up work on ground level and his tackling pressure around the ball. Despite the likes of Robbie Warnock, Sam Jacobs and Shaun Hampson arriving at the Blues during his time at the club, Kreuzer has never been knocked from his perch as its primary ruckman. He currently ranks No.2 in the club's history for hitouts, behind only Justin Madden. - Riley Beveridge\n\nBrodie Grundy (133 games from 2013-2020)\n\nHe might still be relatively early into his Collingwood career, but Grundy has already firmly established himself as one of the game's best ruckman. Able to play virtually as another midfielder, Grundy is redefining the role with his consistent ability to average more than 20 disposals per game. He is a dual best and fairest winner and a dual All-Australian, dominating the position alongside Max Gawn over the last two seasons. It takes him beyond premiership ruckman Darren Jolly and the experienced Josh Fraser in Collingwood colours. He already sits No.2 in Collingwood's history for hitouts, behind only Len Thompson. - Riley Beveridge\n\nDavid Hille (197 games from 2001-2013)\n\nIn 2008 Hille became Essendon's first ruckman to win a club best and fairest since club legend Simon Madden in the Bombers' 1984 premiership season. It was Hille's best year of his career, averaging 16 disposals, 18 hitouts and booting 19 goals in an impressive campaign. He was a long-kicking athletic big man who could be used as a forward option \u2013 he finished his career with 153 goals. Just when Hille looked set to elevate further, he suffered a season-ending knee injury on Anzac Day in 2009. He also captained the Bombers in 2006 when Matthew Lloyd missed most of the year with injury. - Callum Twomey\n\nAaron Sandilands (271 games from 2003-2019)\n\nThe recently retired champion is easily the Dockers' best ever ruckman and is one of the all-time great rookie list success stories. The equal tallest player to play in the AFL went on to become a four-time All-Australian and two-time Doig medallist \u2013 even beating Nat Fyfe to the award in a Brownlow Medal year (2015). Sandilands became one of the game's most dominant big men and fell agonisingly close to cracking 1000 hitouts during the 2015 season (998). Recurring calf injuries saw the star play just 32 games in his final four seasons. - Chris Correia\n\nBrad Ottens (116 games from 2005-2011)\n\nFormer captain Steven King was a dual best and fairest, All-Australian and member of the 2007 flag but narrowly misses out because Ottens lifted the silverware three times. Arriving as an All-Australian from Richmond, Ottens took time to find his feet in his first two seasons playing in tandem with King. The former Tiger then played one of the great individual games in the 2007 preliminary final to get Geelong into the decider. He returned from injury to be the best ruckman on the ground in the 2009 premiership, before notching 500 hit-outs in the 2011 season that finished with glory in his final match. - Mitch Cleary\n\nJarrod Witts (63 games from 2017-2020)\n\nAfter being largely a back-up ruckman at Collingwood, Witts headed north to the Suns for the 2017 season and has become a dominant tap specialist. Witts took over the Suns' co-captaincy for the 2019 season and claimed its best and fairest last year as well, recording a huge 1008 hitouts for the season, at an average of 46 a game. Witts last year had 69 hitouts against Greater Western Sydney in what is a club record for the Suns. - Callum Twomey\n\nShane Mumford (92 games from 2014-2020)\n\nMumford made the switch from Sydney to its crosstown rivals at the end of 2013 and has been the most influential ruckman in the club's history. The bullocking big man proved to be a crucial piece in the Giants' rise up the ladder, adding a competitive and forceful presence to a young group. He came out of retirement to play 20 games last season as the Giants made it to their first ever Grand Final, averaging 31 hitouts a game. The Giants have used a number of rucks through their time in the AFL but Mumford is the most dominant. - Callum Twomey\n\nBen McEvoy (116 games from 2014-present)\n\nThere are probably three contenders \u2013 McEvoy, David Hale and Peter Everitt \u2013 but only one right answer. David Hale was a great addition from North Melbourne, playing in four straight Grand Finals for three premierships. However, both Hale and Everitt were ruck-forwards. Everitt was a solid contributor at the Hawks despite being past his peak but another ex-Saint, McEvoy, had the greatest impact. He played in flags in his first two years in brown and gold and was in the top handful of ruckmen in the AFL for his steady tapwork, mobility, contested marking and deadeye set-shot kicking until his switch into defence. - Marc McGowan\n\nMax Gawn (121 games from 2011-present)\n\nThe Demons' penchant for producing quality ruckmen didn't end when Brownlow medallist Jim Stynes' career ended in 1998. Jeff White (2004) \u2013 after starting at Fremantle as a No.1 draft pick \u2013 Mark Jamar (2010) and Gawn (2016, 2018 and 2019) all earned All-Australian selection as Melbourne's No.1 ruckman this century. But how can you go past 208cm Gawn, who's blossomed from an undisciplined kid with ACL setbacks into a ruck great and the Dees' captain? He won the AFL Coaches' Association Champion Player of the Year in 2018 and is also a dual Melbourne best and fairest. - Marc McGowan\n\nTodd Goldstein (235 games from 2008-present)\n\nThe Roos spent top-10 picks on ruckmen in 2001 and 2002 but it was the man who slid to No.37 in 2006 who shone brightest. David Hale and Hamish McIntosh were serviceable before Goldstein usurped them. The likes of Matthew 'Spider' Burton and Mark Porter were also tried, while Drew Petrie spent time in the ruck as well. Goldstein was the Roos' clear-cut No.1 ruckman by 2011 and hasn't averaged fewer than 30 hitouts in any season since, including being the first player to amass 1000 in a single year in 2015, when he was an All-Australian and won the Syd Barker Medal. - Marc McGowan\n\nBrendon Lade (169 games from 2000-2009)\n\nLade narrowly pips former skipper Matthew Primus and fellow premiership player Dean Brogan, having played the bulk of his career on this side of the turn of the century. He played an integral role in the club's inaugural AFL flag in 2004, before winning the best and fairest in 2006. He was a dual All-Australian in back-to-back years in 2006 and 2007, while his ability to also push forward and become a consistent goal threat made him a versatile option throughout his career. He currently ranks No.1 in Port Adelaide's history for hitouts in the AFL era. - Riley Beveridge\n\nBrad Ottens (95 games from 2000-2004)\n\nDespite playing predominately as a forward and back-up ruck to Brendon Gale and later Greg Stafford, Ottens actually lead the team for hitouts in every season bar '03 when injury restricted him to just 12 matches. Produced his best season in Tiger colours in 2001 when he was selected in the All-Australian team as the back-up ruck/third tall forward option. Would later become a three-time premiership player as Geelong's No.1 ruck. Gets the nod over Toby Nankervis, who has been a key contributor to the Tigers' recent success, but only has two very good seasons to his name with Ivan Soldo carrying the ruck last year. - Ben Sutton\n\nBen McEvoy (91 games from 2008-2013)\n\nRemarkably, the Saints had 11 different ruckmen lead their season hit-outs in the 20 years to start the century. While Michael Gardiner and Steven King, both played in Grand Finals across 2009-2010, McEvoy was the Saints' most consistent big man before he was traded to Hawthorn. Peter Everitt won the Saints' best and fairest in 2001 but just missed out to McEvoy because he only played 48 games in the century before he too was traded to Hawthorn. Justin Koschitzke was rated as a forward. - Mitch Cleary\n\nDarren Jolly (118 games from 2005-2009)\n\nThe Swans had various ruckmen across their Grand Final appearances this century, including Jolly, Stephen Doyle, rugby convert Mike Pyke and Sam Naismith. They also had ruck-forwards Kurt Tippett, Jason Ball and Peter Everitt, while Callum Sinclair went from that dual role to the No.1 mantle during Naismith's knee-related absence. It came down to Jolly and Pyke, who both made more than 100 appearances for the club. Jolly played in the 2005 and 2006 Grand Finals and was a consistent and durable ruckman who was named in the 40-man All-Australian squad in his first season with Collingwood in 2010 after departing Sydney. - Marc McGowan\n\nDean Cox (290 games from 2001-2014)\n\nA once-in-a-generation ruckman who will be the best big man in this column. The six-time All-Australian changed the requirements of the modern-day ruckman and acted as an midfielder alongside greats Chris Judd, Ben Cousins, Daniel Kerr in a fearsome onball unit. Cox tasted premiership success in 2005 and won the club's best and fairest in 2008. Nic Naitanui's influence at stoppages would have him in consideration at most other club's for this debate but couldn't get in the conversation besides Cox. - Mitch Cleary\n\nLuke Darcy (131 games from 2000-2007)\n\nDarcy might have played a fair portion of his Western Bulldogs career before 2000, but it was arguably after the turn of the century where the father-son pick enjoyed his best football. He won the club's best and fairest in 2001, before sharing the AFL Players' Association MVP award with Michael Voss the following season. It was during that campaign where he averaged more than 20 disposals and a goal per game to also earn All-Australian honours. He narrowly pips Will Minson, who ranks No.1 in the club's history for hitouts. - Riley Beveridge"}, {"url": "https://www.theage.com.au/sport/afl/2015-afl-draft-combine-harvester-ruckman-20151008-gk47g6.html", "page_content": "Gach Nyuon (19/3/1997. 201cm, 81kg.

He's always been seen as a project and I think it took him a while to stop seeing himself as a project, to be honest. I don't think he saw himself as being up to the level for a long time. He knew he had ability, but once he got accepted by the Vic Country group he completely changed, and started to believe he could get there. Majak Daw came down one day to half a conversation with him, and I think it was: mate, this is going to slip away if you don't really take hold of it. But he has talent, and he's going to get better and better.

He came out of retirement to play 20 games last season as the Giants made it to their first ever Grand Final, averaging 31 hitouts a game.

Everitt was a solid contributor at the Hawks despite being past his peak but another ex-Saint, McEvoy, had the greatest impact.

Produced his best season in Tiger colours in 2001 when he was selected in the All-Australian team as the back-up ruck/third tall forward option.

Champion utility Adam Goodes was the 2003 All-Australian ruckman, too. It came down to Jolly and Pyke, who both made more than 100 appearances for Sydney.

Did he really give the North Melbourne Football Club a chance? I question that.\n\n\u201cI question whether he absolutely respected the senior players and respected what it was to be in a professional environment and prepare yourself to the nth degree.\n\n\u201cWe thank him for what he has done and his year of service and we move on.\u201d\n\nKing played 241 games in the blue and white over his 11-year career, and he was a member of North\u2019s 1996 and 1999 premiership winning sides and is a two-time AFL All-Australian.\n\nSince his retirement, King has become part of the football media landscape, working for Fox Footy and SEN 1116.\n\nBut even though he covers the league as a whole, King said he still had a special affection for the Kangaroos.\n\n\u201cMost of my opportunities in my life have come through North Melbourne, so there is always a soft spot for the club,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI have real empathy for those that are working as hard as they are at the moment and not getting anywhere, I ride the bumps with the club, but I try not to show it.\u201d\n\nIt has been a hard few seasons for North with the Kangaroos finishing last on the ladder in back-to-back seasons, but King said he hoped the club could turn things around.\n\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t go any lower, we have finished 17th, 18th, 18th in the last three seasons,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe just hope that Alastair Clarkson can come back, get his feet under the desk and deliver on what is an unbelievable coaching CV and help build this football club.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to talk about finals or winning finals, we just need to get some credibility back.\u201d\n\nKing was in Echuca on Tuesday as one of the guests at the Echuca Racecourse\u2019s annual publicans day.\n\nHe was invited up by his good friend and renowned football commentator Tony Leonard \u2014 who was the MC for the day \u2014 and King said he jumped at the opportunity.\n\nThe pair have known each other for 20 years, with King commentating alongside Leonard back in the day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Tony for a long time.

January 31, 1955, Melbourne, Australia.\n\nDavid King was a member of the Melbourne Filmmakers Co-Operative in the mid-1970s when \u2013 inspired by the likes of Jean-Luc Godard, Vilgot Sj\u00f6man, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Ingmar Bergman, and Federico Fellini \u2013 he began making student films on black and white 16mm with a borrowed spring-wound Bolex, a shaky tripod, and a handful of photoflood lights.\n\nFollowing this, he briefly became a professional cameraman, shooting promotional, educational, and horse racing films throughout Victoria.\n\nIn the 1980s, he freelanced as a scriptwriter for the ABC, penning four episodes of the Awgie Award-winning young peoples\u2019 television series, Home, which subsequently sold to networks all over the world.\n\nAround this time, he collaborated with Brian Jones on the privately-funded independent low budget erotic rock\u2019n\u2019roll comedy Coming Of Age which was released through Greg Lynch Film Distributors and subsequently through Golden Lion.\n\nHe also received Government funding to develop a 13-part young people\u2019s sci fi television series called The Parallax Factor, and had a feature film treatment for an erotic psychological thriller accepted for development by a New York-based distribution company. Unfortunately, neither project was produced.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, David worked primarily as a journalist, writing a wide range of features and news articles for newspapers and magazines before returning to independent film/video-making in 1995 with the ultra-low budget educational documentary, Getting Together.\n\nIn Brisbane, he revived a semi-commercial film/video-making career by producing and directing a series of innovative ultra-low budget community service announcements, promotional, corporate, and educational videos for non-profit organizations. Although working for clients, he had total freedom to create, write, produce, and direct the projects as he saw fit.\n\nDavid returned to dramatic film/video-making in 1999 with the short film Enigma (Digital Betacam, 16 mins) followed in 2002 by The Job (DVCam/MiniDV, 15 mins) which has now screened at 14 international film festivals in the UK, Europe, the Middle East, and Canada.\n\nDystopic Overload gained immediate acceptance, being screened at the Peel Your Eyes exhibition in Geelong, the Short Cut film/video screenings in Melbourne, Exploding Cinema in London, on Art television in France, and was the only Australian work of video art to be included in the 2012 Cologne International Videoart Festival which screens at numerous venues around the world."}]}
