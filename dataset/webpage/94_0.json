It was also Sagen who took up a collection that made it possible for Dahl to go to Copenhagen in 1811 to complete his education at the academy there.\n\nAs important as Dahl's studies at the academy in Copenhagen were his experiences in the surrounding countryside and in the city's art collections. In 1812 he wrote to Sagen that the landscape artists he most wished to emulate were Ruisdahl and Everdingen, and for that reason he was studying \u201cnature above all,\u201d Dahl's artistic program was, then, already in place: he would become a part of the great landscape tradition, but he would also be as faithful as possible to nature itself.\n\nDahl held that a landscape painting should not just depict a specific view, but should also say something about the land's nature and character \u2013 the greatness of its past and the life and work of its current inhabitants. The mood was often idyllic, often melancholy. When he added snow to a landscape he painted in the summer, it was not to show the light and colors of snow; it was to use snow as a symbol of death. As one critic has put it, \u201cUnlike the radically Romantic works also appearing at the time, Dahl softens his landscape, introducing elements of genre painting by imbuing it with anecdotal materials: In the background a wisp of smoke rises from a cabin, perhaps the home of the hunter on the snow-covered field.\u201d Thanks to Sagen's recommendations and to his own personal charm, Dahl soon gained access to the leading social circles in Copenhagen.\n\nDahl took part in annual art exhibitions in Copenhagen beginning in 1812, but his real breakthrough came in 1815, when he exhibited no fewer than 13 paintings. Prince Christian Frederik of Denmark, who developed an early interest in Dahl's artistic genius and saw to it that his works were purchased for the royal collection, became a lifelong friend and patron of the artist.\n\nIn 1816 C. W. Eckersberg returned from abroad with his paintings of Roman settings; Dahl was impressed at once, and they became good friends and exchanged pictures. Dahl's 1817 painting Den Store Kro i Fredensborg marked the real beginning of his lifelong production of oil paintings depicting natural subjects.\n\nAfter his success in Copenhagen, Dahl realized that he wanted to live as an independent, self-supporting artist. One challenge facing him was that the academic preference of the day was for historical paintings with moral messages. Landscapes were considered the lowest kind of art, and perhaps even not as art at all, but as a purely mechanical imitation of nature. The only landscapes that could be considered art, according to the academy, were ideal, imaginary landscapes in pastoral or heroic styles. In accordance with this reigning taste, Dahl attempted to give his Danish themes a certain atmospheric character in order to lift them up above what was considered a merely commercial level. But at the same time it was his deepest wish to provide a more faithful picture of Norwegian nature than were offered by the old-fashioned, dry paintings of Haas and Lorentzen. This desire was partly motivated by homesickness and patriotism, but it was also suited to the public taste of the day for \u201cpicturesque\u201d works.\n\nDahl traveled to Dresden in September 1818. He arrived with introductions to the city's leading citizens and to major artists such as Caspar David Friedrich, who helped him establish himself there and became his close friend. One critic has written: \u201cFriedrich's still, meticulously executed landscapes - products of an art informed by his strict Protestant upbringing and a seeking for the divine in nature - were justifiably famous by the time he and Dahl became acquainted. We are able to see his Two Men Contemplating the Moon (1819), which ranks among his greatest works, and features two \"R\u00fcckfiguren,\" or figures seen from behind, solemnly and companionably gazing at a young sickle moon from the edge of an old forest. 'Greifswald in Moonlight' (1816\u201317) depicts the artist's birthplace in Pomerania, on the Baltic coast: bathed in an even, gauzy moonlight, the ancient university town assumes an almost ethereal appearance.\u201d\n\nFriedrich was fourteen years Dahl's elder and an established artist, but the two found in each other a shared love for nature and a shared enthusiasm for a way of depicting nature that was based on the study of nature itself rather than on the academic cliches that they both profoundly despised. One writer has put it this way: \u201cA warm and sociable character, he soon met and became friendly with the more introverted and reclusive Friedrich, recording how they once walked together in the park of the Gr\u00f6sser Garten among 'many lovely trees of different kinds, and the moon looked beautiful behind the dark fir trees.'\u201d\n\nTogether with Friedrich and Carl Gustav Carus, Dahl would become one of the Dresden painters of the period who exerted a decisive influence on German Romantic painting.\n\nIn Dresden, as in Copenhagen, Dahl traveled around the area to draw subjects that could be of use to him in larger works that would be painted later in his atelier. He wrote to Prince Christian Frederik in 1818 that \u201cmost of all I am representing nature in all its freedom and wildness.\u201d Dahl found enough material in the Dresden area to supply motifs for his paintings, but he continued to paint imaginary landscapes with forests, mountains, and waterfalls. One such painting, completed in 1819, entitled Norsk fjellandskap med elv (Mountainous Norwegian landscape with river\u201d), garnered great attention among younger artists who considered the striking natural quality of the painting a breath of fresh air on Dresden's stagnant art scene. Another monumental waterfall painting, completed the next year, was lavished with praised by the critic for Kunstblatt who said that Dahl was greater than Jacob van Ruisdael. Dahl was accepted into the Dresden academy in 1820.\n\nPrince Christian Frederik wrote to Dahl in 1820 from Italy and invited him to join him at the Gulf of Naples. Dahl was at the time courting a young woman named Emilie von Bloch, but felt he should take the prince up on his offer, so he married Emilie quickly and traveled to Italy the next day. He ended up spending 10 months in Italy. Though he missed his bride, the sojourn was a decisive factor in his artistic development. It was in Italy, with its strong southern light, that Dahl's art truly flowered. It forced him to see nature plain, without the mediation of the old masters' renderings of light and color.\n\nDahl went to Rome in February 1821. He spent a great deal of time visiting museums, meeting other artists, and painting pictures to sell. In addition to painting sights in Rome and pictures of the Gulf of Naples, he painted landscapes inspired by the mountains of Norway. Dahl said that not until he was in Rome did he truly appreciate Norwegian nature. In June 1821 Dahl returned north to Emilie and a quiet life of family and painting.\n\nDahl quickly became a member of Dresden's leading circles of poets, artists, and scientists, among them the archeologist C. A. B\u00f6ttiger, publisher of Artistisches Notizenblatt, who ran a major article on Dahl in 1822.\n\nAs a member of the academy, Dahl always dedicated his time to young artists who sought him out. In 1824 he and Friedrich were named \u201cextraordinary professors\u201d who had no chair but who received a regular salary. In 1823 Dahl moved in with Friedrich, so that many of his students, such as Knud Baade, Peder Balke, and Thomas Fearnley, were equally influenced by both artists. \u201cWell before their meeting,\u201d writes one critic, \u201cDahl had also painted a number of 'moonlights' and, travelling in Europe, he was in the Bay of Naples in 1821 when Mount Vesuvius was active. Here he painted 'Boats on the Beach Near Naples', where fishing crafts lie at anchor in the calm, shimmering waters with the twin peaks of the mountain smoking and flaming behind. Predictably, after his close association with Friedrich began\u2014the two families shared a house in Dresden from 1823\u2014he was considerably influenced by him, but his own more spontaneous and painterly style soon prevailed. Clients sometimes commissioned pictures from them both, a tranquil coastal scene by Friedrich to pair with a more stormy subject from Dahl.\u201d\n\nDahl never formed a \u201cschool\u201d around himself, but rather preferred for his students to cultivate their own styles; it was against his principles and his respect for artistic freedom to try to inhibit his students' individuality. It was this impulse toward individuality that later caused him to turn down an offer of a permanent chair at the academy \u2013 he didn't want to feel compelled to show up for class when he was busy working on a painting.\n\nDahl continued his studies of nature in the area around Dresden when he had the time, or on longer trips which provided him with themes for his paintings. But most often he painted the view of the Elbe outside his windows in various kinds of light. Like John Constable, Dahl felt that the sky was an important part of a landscape painting, and he never grew tired of watching the clouds move over the flat plain. One critic has compared two paintings of Friedrich and Dahl: \u201cIn...Dahl's 'Mother and Child by the Sea', there are echoes of Friedrich's 'Woman by the Sea' (1818). Whereas in Friedrich's work a woman dressed for the windy weather sits idly watching five fishing boats sailing past, in Dahl's picture, there seems to be a more personal note, with echoes of his own upbringing in a seafaring community, as the mother and small child eagerly await the return of the little ship from the sea.\u201d The same critic has written about one of his paintings of Dresden: \u201cDahl also commemorated the magnificent Baroque buildings of his adopted city, and a version of his View of Dresden by Moonlight (1838) has travelled from the National Museum of Art, Architecture, and Design in Oslo. This small picture, measuring only 18.5 x 34.5 cm, shows the dome of the Frauenkirche and the tower of the Hofkirche dominating the skyline; silvers and deep blue combine to give it a wonderful jewel-like effect, together with a certain elegiac quality, perhaps indicative of the artist's awareness that his long friendship with Friedrich was nearing an end.\u201d\n\nAs Dahl wrote in 1828 to the director of the Dresden academy, he found the area around Dresden useful for nature studies, but the \u201creal thing\u201d was always missing; that was something he could only find in his mountainous homeland. He viewed himself as a \u201cmore Nordic painter\u201d with a \u201clove for seacoasts, mountains, waterfalls, sailboats, and pictures of the sea in daylight and moonlight.\u201d He longed to return to Norway, but not until 1826 was he able to make a journey home.\n\nHe made subsequent trips to Norway in 1834, 1839, 1844, and 1850, mostly exploring and painting the mountains, leading to the monumental works Fortundalen (1836) and Stalheim (1842). During his visits to Norway he received \u201can enthusiastic welcome as a painter of renown.\u201d\n\nA critic notes Dahl's late stylistic changes: \u201cIn his late Fjord at Sunset (1850), based on studies made earlier, free and adventurous brush strokes represent the cloud-swept sky and broken surface of the water. Here he has moved far away from the purity and intensity of Friedrich's oeuvre.\u201d\n\nIn 1827 Emilie Dahl died in childbirth while having their fourth child, and two years later two of the older children died of scarlet fever. In January 1830, Dahl married his student Amalie von Bassewitz, but she, too, died in childbirth in December of that same year. Dahl was crushed, and many months passed before he was able to paint again. Some years later this youngest child also died, leaving Dahl with two surviving children, Siegwald and Caroline, who married the Norwegian minister Anders Sand\u00f8e \u00d8rsted Bull 1848.\n\nDahl's trip to Norway in 1850 would be his last. He was aging and weak, but continued to paint landscapes in the mountains. This last journey to his homeland resulted in several magnificent works, including M\u00e5b\u00f8dalen, Fra Stugun\u00f8set, and Hjelle i Valdres.\n\nDahl was among the founding fathers of the National Gallery of Norway (Norwegian: Nasjonalgalleriet), now the National Museum of Art, Architecture, and Design, and donated his own art collection to the institution. Together with Johan Sebastian Welhaven, Frederik Stang, and Henrik Heftye, he founded the Art Society in Oslo (Oslo Kunstforening).\n\nDahl died after a brief illness and was buried on 17 October 1857 in Dresden. In 1902, a statue of Dahl by Norwegian sculptor Ambrosia T\u00f8nnesen (1859\u20131948) was erected on the facade of the West Norway Museum of Decorative Art in Bergen. In 1934, his remains were brought back to Norway and buried in the cemetery of St. Jacob's Church (Sankt Jakob kirke) in Bergen.\n\nJ.C. Dahl occupies a central position in Norwegian artistic life of the first half of the 19th century. His Romantic yet naturalistic interpretations of Norwegian scenery were greatly admired in Norway as well as on the European continent, particularly in Denmark and Germany."}, {"url": "https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/839044", "page_content": "Use your arrow keys to navigate the tabs below, and your tab key to choose an item\n\n\n\nThomas Fearnley was the foremost Norwegian landscape painter to follow in the naturalistic vein of his elder contemporary Johan Christian Dahl (1788\u20131857). An itinerant artist, Fearnley left Norway for the first time at the age of eighteen in 1821; for the remaining two decades of his life, he traveled all over Europe, returning to his native country intermittently. His final sojourn there lasted two years, from 1838 until 1840, when he married and moved to Amsterdam. In the summer of 1839, he visited his birthplace of Frederikshald. He set out from there on a sketching expedition in the western part of the country together with the D\u00fcsseldorf-based painters Andreas Achenbach (1815\u20131910) and Christian Breslauer (1802\u20131882). Staying in Balholm, about seventy miles northeast of Bergen, they passed through Graven, Valdres, Sogn (where they encountered Dahl), Voss, and Hardanger.[1]\n\n\n\nOn July 22, Fearnley made this plein-air study of mountains and plunging waterfalls at Gudvangen, situated at the end of the N\u00e6r\u00f8yfjord, where the N\u00e6r\u00f8ydalselvi River empties into the fjord. He pushed his brush through the wet paint with demonstrable speed and assuredness, allowing the brush marks to convey the geological formations of the fjord\u2019s walls. He then inscribed the place name, date, and his initials into the wet paint using the butt-end of his brush or another stylus. Although this is a sketch and not a finished picture, it is entirely characteristic of the subject matter with which Fearnley made his reputation during his brief life. Dahl praised Fearnley\u2019s plein-air sketches: after the artist\u2019s death he wrote that these were \"better than his finished paintings, for in them he gave of his true self, as he was and as he felt when face-to-face with nature.\"[2]\n\n\n\nAsher Miller 2020\n\n\n\n[1] \"Chronology\" in Ann Sumner and Greg Smith eds., In Front of Nature: The European Landscapes of Thomas Fearnley, exh. cat., Barber Institute of Fine Arts, Birmingham, 2012, p. 113.\n\n[2] Dahl\u2019s letter to the Board of the Nationalgalleriet in Christiania (Oslo) after Fearnley\u2019s death, originally published in Vedastine Aubert, \"Breve fra Thomas Fearnley til J.

C. Dahl or I. C. Dahl, was a Norwegian artist who is considered the first great romantic painter in Norway, the founder of the \"golden age\" of Norwegian painting, and one of the greatest European artists of all time. He is often described as \"the father of Norwegian landscape painting\" and is regarded as the first Norwegian Painter ever to reach a level of artistic accomplishment comparable to that attained by the greatest European artists of his day.

Indeed, if one sets aside his own monumental artistic creations, his other activities on behalf of art, history, and culture would still have guaranteed him a place at the very heart of the artistic and cultural history of Norway. He was, for example, a key figure in the founding of the Norwegian National Gallery and of several other major art institutions in Norway, as well as in the preservation of Norwegian stave churches and the restoration of the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim and H\u00e5konshallen in Bergen.\n\n\n\nDahl came from a very simple background \u2013 his father was a modest fisherman in Bergen, Norway \u2013 and he would later look back at his youth with bitterness. He regretted that he never had a \"real teacher\" in his childhood and, despite all his spectacular success, he believed that if he had been more fortunate in his birth, he would have achieved even more than he had.\n\n\n\nAs a boy, Dahl was educated by a sympathetic mentor at the Bergen Cathedral who at first thought that this bright student would make a good priest, but then, recognizing his remarkably precocious artistic ability, arranged for him to be trained as an artist. From 1803 to 1809 Dahl studied with the painter Johan Georg M\u00fcller (no), whose workshop was the most important one in Bergen at the time. Still, Dahl looked back on his teacher as having kept him in ignorance in order to exploit him, putting him to work painting theatrical sets, portraits, and views of Bergen and its surroundings.

It was also Sagen who took up a collection that made it possible for Dahl to go to Copenhagen in 1811 to complete his education at the academy there.\n\n\n\nAs important as Dahl's studies at the academy in Copenhagen were his experiences in the surrounding countryside and in the city's art collections. In 1812 he wrote to Sagen that the landscape artists he most wished to emulate were Ruisdahl and Everdingen, and for that reason he was studying \u201cnature above all,\u201d Dahl's artistic program was, then, already in place: he would become a part of the great landscape tradition, but he would also be as faithful as possible to nature itself.\n\nThis is a part of the Wikipedia article used under the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 3.0 Unported License (CC-BY-SA).

Depicted from behind, a pair of finely attired visitors on their Grand Tour view the event up-close. Their guides and donkeys wait patiently in the foreground at the lower right. The Eruption of Vesuvius is a striking depiction of a force of nature that animated the European imagination after 1748, when Pompeii, buried by the eruption of 79 AD, was rediscovered. A few years later, Edmund Burke described major natural phenomena that inspire a sense of awe as \u201cSublime\u201d in his treatise A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1757). The text became foundational to the incipient Romantic era. By the early nineteenth century, visitors to Italy traveled south from Rome to Naples not only to see the city and its glorious Mediterranean setting, but with the hope of witnessing an eruption like the one depicted here.[1]\n\n\n\nThis painting was commissioned in 1821 by Dahl\u2019s most important patron, Danish Crown Prince Christian Frederik, the future King Christian VIII, who eventually acquired eighteen works by the Norwegian artist. A longtime territory of Denmark\u2019s, Norway received its own constitution in 1814, but ambitious Norwegians typically sojourned in Copenhagen to develop their skills after reaching the limits of educational possibilities in their still-provincial country. Dahl left his native Bergen in 1811, studying for seven years with the landscape painter Christian August Lorentzen (1749\u20131828) at the Royal Academy of Fine Art. It was there that Dahl first gained the attention of Christian Frederik. In 1818, Dahl moved to Dresden, where Christian Frederik visited him in the spring of 1819, en route to Italy. In May 1820, Dahl received an invitation to join the prince, who offered to cover his expenses. The painter left Dresden on June 13 and arrived at the palace of Quisisana, above Castellammare on the Bay of Naples, on August 11. He remained in Italy for ten months, leaving from Rome on June 21, 1821.\n\n\n\nVesuvius erupted on December 20, 1820, and Dahl ascended the volcano as quickly as he could to observe the phenomenon on the spot. The next day he painted a sketch, or study, to record what he had seen. On July 13, 1824, Christian Frederik wrote to Dahl, expressing pleasure that the artist was working on a painting of Vesuvius for him, which \u201cjudging from the sketch, cannot fail to impress.\u201d This was presumably the sketch that Dahl executed immediately after the eruption, which Christian Frederik could have seen in Naples, or afterward, in Rome. That sketch is probably the one now in the Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen, which is signed and dated December 24, 1820 (Bang 1987, no. 257). Dahl exhibited the present work in the Dresden Academy\u2019s annual exhibition in 1824. It was delivered to the patron in January 1825 and exhibited at the Danish Academy\u2019s annual exhibition in Copenhagen later that year.\n\n\n\nDahl painted two versions of this composition before he left Italy. One, dated February 21, 1821, is also in the Statens Museum (Bang 296). Another was produced in Rome in 1821 for the Prussian consul, Jacob Bartholdi, and is now in the KODE Art Museums, Bergen (Bang 316). There are at least four other versions, dated 1826 (St\u00e4del Museum, Frankfurt; Bang 510), 1845 (whereabouts unknown, Bang 1032), what may be a copy after the present work possibly executed by 1832 (Nasjonalmuseet, Oslo; Bang 1254), and another, possibly datable about 1820\u201324 (private collection, Salten, Norway, in 1987; Bang 1284).\n\n\n\nThere are two related drawings, a study of ships in the bay, dated \u201c24 Octbr 1820,\u201d and a study of the man to the right by the flames, signed, dated, and inscribed \u201cProf. Friedrich\u2019s Figur.

In 1812 he wrote to Sagen that the landscape artists he most wished to emulate were Ruisdahl and Everdingen, and for that reason he was studying \u201cnature above all,\u201d Dahl's artistic program was, then, already in place: he would become a part of the great landscape tradition, but he would also be as faithful as possible to nature itself.\n\nDahl held that a landscape painting should not just depict a specific view, but should also say something about the land's nature and character \u2013 the greatness of its past and the life and work of its current inhabitants. The mood was often idyllic, often melancholy. When he added snow to a landscape he painted in the summer, it was not to show the light and colors of snow; it was to use snow as a symbol of death. As one critic has put it, \u201cUnlike the radically Romantic works also appearing at the time, Dahl softens his landscape, introducing elements of genre painting by imbuing it with anecdotal materials: In the background a wisp of smoke rises from a cabin, perhaps the home of the hunter on the snow-covered field.\u201d Thanks to Sagen's recommendations and to his own personal charm, Dahl soon gained access to the leading social circles in Copenhagen.\n\nDahl took part in annual art exhibitions in Copenhagen beginning in 1812, but his real breakthrough came in 1815, when he exhibited no fewer than 13 paintings. Prince Christian Frederik of Denmark, who developed an early interest in Dahl's artistic genius and saw to it that his works were purchased for the royal collection, became a lifelong friend and patron of the artist.\n\nIn 1816 C. W. Eckersberg returned from abroad with his paintings of Roman settings; Dahl was impressed at once, and they became good friends and exchanged pictures. Dahl's 1817 painting Den Store Kro i Fredensborg marked the real beginning of his lifelong production of oil paintings depicting natural subjects.\n\nAfter his success in Copenhagen, Dahl realized that he wanted to live as an independent, self-supporting artist. One challenge facing him was that the academic preference of the day was for historical paintings with moral messages. Landscapes were considered the lowest kind of art, and perhaps even not as art at all, but as a purely mechanical imitation of nature. The only landscapes that could be considered art, according to the academy, were ideal, imaginary landscapes in pastoral or heroic styles. In accordance with this reigning taste, Dahl attempted to give his Danish themes a certain atmospheric character in order to lift them up above what was considered a merely commercial level. But at the same time it was his deepest wish to provide a more faithful picture of Norwegian nature than were offered by the old-fashioned, dry paintings of Haas and Lorentzen. This desire was partly motivated by homesickness and patriotism, but it was also suited to the public taste of the day for \u201cpicturesque\u201d works.\n\nDahl traveled to Dresden in September 1818. He arrived with introductions to the city's leading citizens and to major artists such as Caspar David Friedrich, who helped him establish himself there and became his close friend. One critic has written: \u201cFriedrich's still, meticulously executed landscapes - products of an art informed by his strict Protestant upbringing and a seeking for the divine in nature - were justifiably famous by the time he and Dahl became acquainted. We are able to see his Two Men Contemplating the Moon (1819), which ranks among his greatest works, and features two \"R\u00fcckfiguren,\" or figures seen from behind, solemnly and companionably gazing at a young sickle moon from the edge of an old forest. 'Greifswald in Moonlight' (1816\u201317) depicts the artist's birthplace in Pomerania, on the Baltic coast: bathed in an even, gauzy moonlight, the ancient university town assumes an almost ethereal appearance.\u201d\n\nFriedrich was fourteen years Dahl's elder and an established artist, but the two found in each other a shared love for nature and a shared enthusiasm for a way of depicting nature that was based on the study of nature itself rather than on the academic cliches that they both profoundly despised. One writer has put it this way: \u201cA warm and sociable character, he soon met and became friendly with the more introverted and reclusive Friedrich, recording how they once walked together in the park of the Gr\u00f6sser Garten among 'many lovely trees of different kinds, and the moon looked beautiful behind the dark fir trees.'\u201d\n\nTogether with Friedrich and Carl Gustav Carus, Dahl would become one of the Dresden painters of the period who exerted a decisive influence on German Romantic painting.\n\nIn Dresden, as in Copenhagen, Dahl traveled around the area to draw subjects that could be of use to him in larger works that would be painted later in his atelier. He wrote to Prince Christian Frederik in 1818 that \u201cmost of all I am representing nature in all its freedom and wildness.\u201d Dahl found enough material in the Dresden area to supply motifs for his paintings, but he continued to paint imaginary landscapes with forests, mountains, and waterfalls. One such painting, completed in 1819, entitled Norsk fjellandskap med elv (Mountainous Norwegian landscape with river\u201d), garnered great attention among younger artists who considered the striking natural quality of the painting a breath of fresh air on Dresden's stagnant art scene. Another monumental waterfall painting, completed the next year, was lavished with praised by the critic for Kunstblatt who said that Dahl was greater than Jacob van Ruisdael. Dahl was accepted into the Dresden academy in 1820.\n\nPrince Christian Frederik wrote to Dahl in 1820 from Italy and invited him to join him at the Gulf of Naples. Dahl was at the time courting a young woman named Emilie von Bloch, but felt he should take the prince up on his offer, so he married Emilie quickly and traveled to Italy the next day. He ended up spending 10 months in Italy. Though he missed his bride, the sojourn was a decisive factor in his artistic development. It was in Italy, with its strong southern light, that Dahl's art truly flowered. It forced him to see nature plain, without the mediation of the old masters' renderings of light and color.\n\nDahl went to Rome in February 1821. He spent a great deal of time visiting museums, meeting other artists, and painting pictures to sell. In addition to painting sights in Rome and pictures of the Gulf of Naples, he painted landscapes inspired by the mountains of Norway. Dahl said that not until he was in Rome did he truly appreciate Norwegian nature. In June 1821 Dahl returned north to Emilie and a quiet life of family and painting.\n\nDahl quickly became a member of Dresden's leading circles of poets, artists, and scientists, among them the archeologist C. A. B\u00f6ttiger, publisher of Artistisches Notizenblatt, who ran a major article on Dahl in 1822.\n\nAs a member of the academy, Dahl always dedicated his time to young artists who sought him out. In 1824 he and Friedrich were named \u201cextraordinary professors\u201d who had no chair but who received a regular salary. In 1823 Dahl moved in with Friedrich, so that many of his students, such as Knud Baade, Peder Balke, and Thomas Fearnley, were equally influenced by both artists. \u201cWell before their meeting,\u201d writes one critic, \u201cDahl had also painted a number of 'moonlights' and, travelling in Europe, he was in the Bay of Naples in 1821 when Mount Vesuvius was active. Here he painted 'Boats on the Beach Near Naples', where fishing crafts lie at anchor in the calm, shimmering waters with the twin peaks of the mountain smoking and flaming behind. Predictably, after his close association with Friedrich began\u2014the two families shared a house in Dresden from 1823\u2014he was considerably influenced by him, but his own more spontaneous and painterly style soon prevailed. Clients sometimes commissioned pictures from them both, a tranquil coastal scene by Friedrich to pair with a more stormy subject from Dahl.\u201d\n\nDahl never formed a \u201cschool\u201d around himself, but rather preferred for his students to cultivate their own styles; it was against his principles and his respect for artistic freedom to try to inhibit his students' individuality. It was this impulse toward individuality that later caused him to turn down an offer of a permanent chair at the academy \u2013 he didn't want to feel compelled to show up for class when he was busy working on a painting.\n\nDahl continued his studies of nature in the area around Dresden when he had the time, or on longer trips which provided him with themes for his paintings. But most often he painted the view of the Elbe outside his windows in various kinds of light. Like John Constable, Dahl felt that the sky was an important part of a landscape painting, and he never grew tired of watching the clouds move over the flat plain. One critic has compared two paintings of Friedrich and Dahl: \u201cIn...Dahl's 'Mother and Child by the Sea', there are echoes of Friedrich's 'Woman by the Sea' (1818). Whereas in Friedrich's work a woman dressed for the windy weather sits idly watching five fishing boats sailing past, in Dahl's picture, there seems to be a more personal note, with echoes of his own upbringing in a seafaring community, as the mother and small child eagerly await the return of the little ship from the sea.\u201d The same critic has written about one of his paintings of Dresden: \u201cDahl also commemorated the magnificent Baroque buildings of his adopted city, and a version of his View of Dresden by Moonlight (1838) has travelled from the National Museum of Art, Architecture, and Design in Oslo. This small picture, measuring only 18.5 x 34.5 cm, shows the dome of the Frauenkirche and the tower of the Hofkirche dominating the skyline; silvers and deep blue combine to give it a wonderful jewel-like effect, together with a certain elegiac quality, perhaps indicative of the artist's awareness that his long friendship with Friedrich was nearing an end.\u201d\n\nAs Dahl wrote in 1828 to the director of the Dresden academy, he found the area around Dresden useful for nature studies, but the \u201creal thing\u201d was always missing; that was something he could only find in his mountainous homeland. He viewed himself as a \u201cmore Nordic painter\u201d with a \u201clove for seacoasts, mountains, waterfalls, sailboats, and pictures of the sea in daylight and moonlight.\u201d He longed to return to Norway, but not until 1826 was he able to make a journey home.\n\nHe made subsequent trips to Norway in 1834, 1839, 1844, and 1850, mostly exploring and painting the mountains, leading to the monumental works Fortundalen (1836) and Stalheim (1842). During his visits to Norway he received \u201can enthusiastic welcome as a painter of renown.\u201d\n\nA critic notes Dahl's late stylistic changes: \u201cIn his late Fjord at Sunset (1850), based on studies made earlier, free and adventurous brush strokes represent the cloud-swept sky and broken surface of the water. Here he has moved far away from the purity and intensity of Friedrich's oeuvre.\u201d\n\nIn 1827 Emilie Dahl died in childbirth while having their fourth child, and two years later two of the older children died of scarlet fever. In January 1830, Dahl married his student Amalie von Bassewitz, but she, too, died in childbirth in December of that same year. Dahl was crushed, and many months passed before he was able to paint again. Some years later this youngest child also died, leaving Dahl with two surviving children, Siegwald and Caroline, who married the Norwegian minister Anders Sand\u00f8e \u00d8rsted Bull 1848.\n\nDahl's trip to Norway in 1850 would be his last. He was aging and weak, but continued to paint landscapes in the mountains. This last journey to his homeland resulted in several magnificent works, including M\u00e5b\u00f8dalen, Fra Stugun\u00f8set, and Hjelle i Valdres.\n\nDahl was among the founding fathers of the National Gallery of Norway (Norwegian: Nasjonalgalleriet), now the National Museum of Art, Architecture, and Design, and donated his own art collection to the institution. Together with Johan Sebastian Welhaven, Frederik Stang, and Henrik Heftye, he founded the Art Society in Oslo (Oslo Kunstforening).\n\nDahl died after a brief illness and was buried on 17 October 1857 in Dresden. In 1902, a statue of Dahl by Norwegian sculptor Ambrosia T\u00f8nnesen (1859\u20131948) was erected on the facade of the West Norway Museum of Decorative Art in Bergen. In 1934, his remains were brought back to Norway and buried in the cemetery of St. Jacob's Church (Sankt Jakob kirke) in Bergen.\n\nJ.C. Dahl occupies a central position in Norwegian artistic life of the first half of the 19th century. His Romantic yet naturalistic interpretations of Norwegian scenery were greatly admired in Norway as well as on the European continent, particularly in Denmark and Germany."}, {"url": "https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/438954", "page_content": "Use your arrow keys to navigate the tabs below, and your tab key to choose an item\n\nJ\u00f8rgen Hansen Koch.

Several people gave him valuable help that enabled his success.\n\nDahl\u2019s father worked as a fisher and ferryman, and the family struggled to make ends meet.\n\nEarly in his childhood, Dahl showed enthusiasm and talent for drawing, and at 15, he was taken on as an apprentice by the master painter Johan Georg M\u00fcller.\n\nSix years later, he gained his certificate as a journeyman painter.\n\nBy now, Dahl\u2019s abilities were attracting wider attention, and in the opinion of Lyder Sagen, a well-known educator, Dahl had \u201ca rare talent for the art of painting\u201d and \u201cpoverty and artistic genius are almost always indivisible on this earth\u201d.\n\nSagen wrote to Bergen\u2019s wealthier citizens asking them for donations so that Dahl could attend the art academy in Copenhagen.\n\nThanks to Sagen\u2019s fund-raising efforts and the generosity of Bergen\u2019s citizens, Dahl travelled to Copenhagen in 1811.\n\nOver the following years in Copenhagen, the art student was taken up by the city\u2019s elite and had a major breakthrough when he sold a painting to the Danish king.\n\nFollowing his success in Copenhagen, Dahl travelled further to the German city of Dresden.\n\nAt the age of 36, he became a professor at the Dresden\u2019s art academy, where his students included important future artists. Dahl\u2019s rise through the ranks of society was complete!\n\nAlthough Dahl spent the greater part of his life in what today is Germany, his homeland continued to play a major role in his art. Whenever he visited Norway, he made sketches and studies of the Norwegian landscape, and eventually these would become some of his most famous paintings.\n\nFrom his impoverished beginnings as the journeyman son of a fisherman, Dahl became the first Norwegian painter to achieve fame and join the cultural elite."}]}
