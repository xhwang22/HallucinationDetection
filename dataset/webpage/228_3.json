He was selected to the all California Interscholastic Federation team and twice captured All Irvine League honors. As a 6\"2\" forward for Orange Coast College, Vallely averaged 26 points per game and broke 18 scoring records. He was selected a junior college All American. He dribbled with his left hand and shot with his right hand. Vallely was quick to make the transition from forward to guard at University of California, Los Los Angeles In his first season, he was the Bruins\" third leading scorer (129 ppg) and adapted smoothly to head coach John Wooden\"s \"attack and gamble offense\". Vallely majored in economics at University of California, Los Angeles and had a 3.36 grade point average as a junior. He was selected to the twelve man 1968 Olympic trials team coached by Jerry Tarkanian which competed in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He was taken by the Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the 1970 National Basketball Association Draft. He sat on the bench much of the time, playing behind Pete Maravich, Lou Hudson, Walt Hazzard, and Herm Gilliam. Vallely was acquired by the Houston Rockets in November 1971 along with 6\"7\" forward Jim Davis. Vallely was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma in 2003. He had a single stem cell treatment which was unsuccessful. He received a second offer from a stem cell donor bank, which received a nearly exact match from a winemaker who lived near Frankfurt, Germany. This time the treatment was a success.

They were Olympics swimming champion Johnny Weissmuller, Heisman Trophy winner Pete Dawkins and golf great Jack Nicklaus.\n\nWeissmuller got polio at 9. He took up swimming as part of his rehabilitation therapy and the treatment was the beginning of a championship career. Weissmuller won five gold medals and one bronze in the 1924 and 1928 Olympics. He would later star in several \u201cTarzan\u201d movies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDawkins was diagnosed with polio at 11. But aggressive physical treatment helped him recover. He was selected the best player in college football in 1958 at Army, and other honors included earning consensus All-America status and capturing the Maxwell Award. He didn\u2019t play in the NFL but attended Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, followed by careers in the military and in business.\n\nNicklaus contacted polio at 13, a year before the Jonas Salk vaccine was made available in the mid-1950s.\n\nNicklaus remembers his muscles feeling stiff and his joints aching. Over a two-week period, he said, \u201cI lost my coordination and 20 pounds.\n\n\u201cI recovered after a few weeks but my joints have gotten awfully sore at times.\u201d\n\nHe holds the record for most victories in major tournaments.\n\nIn sports events canceled by the current pandemic, the Lakers would continue their road schedule today at Detroit.\n\nAnd, winners in the second round of the NCAA basketball tournament would advance to the Sweet 16.\n\nHere is a look at memorable games and outstanding sports performances on this date:\n\n1932 \u2014 The blue lines are eliminated and the center red line is used to determine offsides in an experiment by the NHL. With both teams out of playoff contention, the league tries it in a game between the New York Americans and Boston Bruins. New York wins 8-6.\n\n1958 \u2014 Vern Hatton scores 30 points and Johnny Cox scores 24 to lead Kentucky 84-72 over Seattle in the NCAA basketball final. The Wildcats, referred to as \u201cfiddlers, not violinists\u201d by coach Adolph Rupp, erase an 11-point deficit when Don Mills scores to give Kentucky a 61-60 lead with six minutes to go. Elgin Baylor, playing with injured ribs, leads the Chieftains with 25 points and 19 rebounds.\n\n1969 \u2014 Lew Alcindor scores 37 points to lead UCLA to the NCAA men\u2019s basketball title with a 97-72 win over Purdue. Alcindor, who in 1971 changed his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, also grabs 20 rebounds in his last college game. John Vallely contributes 15 points for the Bruins and Rick Mount scores 25 for the Boilermakers.\n\n1969 \u2014 West Chester State beats Western Carolina 65-39 to win the first women\u2019s collegiate national championship. The game is played using a six-player format at the Pennsylvania school\u2019s Hollinger Field House. The tournament, which consisted of 16 teams, many from Division I schools, ran three days and was the forerunner to the NCAA women\u2019s national tournament.\n\n1986 \u2014 Trevor Berbick wins a unanimous 15-round decision over Pinklon Thomas in Las Vegas for the World Boxing Council heavyweight title. Berbick\u2019s reign as champion, though, was short because he would lose the title to Mike Tyson later in the year. The Jamaican was the last boxer to fight Muhammad Ali, defeating him in 1981.\n\n1994 \u2014 The NFL announces the addition of the two-point conversion, the league\u2019s first scoring change in 75 seasons. The American Football League had used the two-point rule from 1960 until the AFL merged with NFL after the 1969 season, although the rule did not carry over.\n\n1997 \u2014 Tara Lipinski, who could perform the cleanest and surest jumps in women\u2019s figure skating, becomes, at 14, the youngest to win the women\u2019s world championship, at Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\n2013 \u2014 Florida Gulf Coast, a school so new it wasn\u2019t eligible for the NCAA men\u2019s tournament until 2012, upsets second-seeded Georgetown 78-68 in the second round of the South Regional at Philadelphia. The Eagles, coached by Andy Enfield, use a 21-2 second-half run to pull away from the Hoyas and hold on in the final minute to become the seventh No. 15 seed to beat a No. 2. Sherwood Brown scores 24 points and Bernard Thompson scores 23 for Florida Gulf Coast. The Eagles beat San Diego State in the second round for a trip to the Sweet 16, and in April, Enfield is hired by USC as coach.\n\n2017 \u2014 Marcus Stroman takes a no-hitter into the seventh inning, Ian Kinsler hits a two-run home run and the United States beats Puerto Rico 8-0 to win its first World Baseball Classic in four tries.\n\n2017 \u2014 Russell Westbrook records his 35th triple-double of the season with 18 points, 11 rebounds and 14 assists as Oklahoma City cruises to a 122-97 win over Philadelphia. Westbrook, who made all six of his field-goal attempts and all six of his free throws, is the first NBA player to have a triple-double without missing a field-goal attempt or free throw.\n\nSources \u2014 Los Angeles Times and Associated Press"}, {"url": "https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/uchistory/general_history/campuses/ucla/bibliography.html", "page_content": "print-friendly format Los Angeles: Bibliography General Books and Monographs Ackerman, William Coit.

His sky hook became one of the hardest to defend against of all moves in the NBA.\n\nWhile Purdue has not been back to an NCAA final, UCLA returned with a more balanced team to the in 1970.\n\nhttps://www.dailyadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/web1_Ron-Griffitts-PRINT-3-12.jpg\n\nBy Ron Griffitts Contributing Columnist\n\nRon Griffitts a contributing columnist for the Daily Advocate"}, {"url": "http://www.collegehoopedia.com/seasons/1969-70", "page_content": "Final National Polls - Coming Soon\n\nNational Statistical Leaders - Coming Soon\n\nNCAA Tournament Results - Coming Soon\n\nFinal Four Box Scores - Coming Soon\n\nNational Title Team Statistics - Coming Soon\n\nAll-Conference Teams - Coming Soon\n\nAt a Glance\n\nNCAA Champion--UCLA (28-2; coached by John Wooden/22nd of 27 seasons with Bruins; won the Pacific-8 title by three games with a 12-2 record).\n\nNIT Champion--Marquette (26-3; coached by Al McGuire/sixth of 13 seasons with Warriors).\n\nNew Conference--Pacific Coast Athletic Association (forerunner of Big West).\n\nNCAA Probation--Centenary, Florida State, La Salle, Yale.\n\nNCAA Consensus First-Team All-Americans--Dan Issel, F-C, Sr., Kentucky (33.9 ppg, 13.2 rpg, 55.3 FG%); Bob Lanier, C, Sr., St. Bonaventure (29.1 ppg, 16 rpg, 56.1 FG%); Pete Maravich, G, Sr., Louisiana State (44.5 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 6.2 apg); Rick Mount, G, Sr., Purdue (35.4 ppg, 83.1 FT%); Calvin Murphy, G, Sr., Niagara (29.4 ppg, 3.6 rpg, 88.1 FT%).\n\nNational Player of the Year--Maravich (AP/UPI/USBWA/Naismith).\n\nNational Coach of the Year--John Wooden, UCLA (28-2/AP, UPI, NABC, USBWA).\n\nThis season boasted perhaps the most dominant senior class in college basketball history. Bob Lanier (St. Bonaventure), Mike Maloy (Davidson), Pete Maravich (LSU), Jim McMillian (Columbia), Rick Mount (Purdue), Calvin Murphy (Niagara) and Charlie Scott (North Carolina) concluded their careers as three-time All-Americans. Two-time first-team All-American Dan Issel (Kentucky) was among the following sterling senior crop supplementing the seven three-time All-Americans: Tiny Archibald (Texas-El Paso), Dennis Awtrey (Santa Clara), Jimmy Collins (New Mexico State), Dave Cowens (Florida State), John Johnson (Iowa), Sam Lacey (New Mexico State), Geoff Petrie (Princeton), Dave Sorenson (Ohio State) and Rudy Tomjanovich (Michigan). Collins, who went on to coach Illinois-Chicago to the NCAA Tournament in 1998, is New Mexico State's first and only All-American.\n\nDuke, North Carolina and North Carolina State haven't always dominated the ACC. But it wasn't until the league's 17th season that a school outside of the Big Four would capture a regular-season title. South Carolina, ranked No. 1 in preseason polls and considered the favorite to upend UCLA, lost its season opener to visiting Tennessee (55-54) before going unbeaten in conference competition and finishing a league-record five games ahead of the Gamecocks' closest rival. It was their only regular-season conference championship in a 51-year span from 1946 through 1996.\n\nThe ACC selected its representative to the NCAA playoffs at the time through its own postseason tourney and seven of the eight previous winners reached the Final Four. But the Gamecocks, featuring a starting lineup with Bobby Cremins as its only senior, lost against N.C. State in the ACC Tournament final (42-39 in double overtime) when Cremins collected two points, no assists and no rebounds in 49 minutes. Cremins, a three-year starter, went on to become Georgia Tech's all-time winningest coach. Consensus second-team All-American John Roche, entering the ACC Tournament with a 23.8-point average, sustained a severely sprained ankle in the semifinals and wound up averaging just nine points per contest in three ACC tourney outings. . . . South Carolina edged Notre Dame, 84-83, in the championship game of the Sugar Bowl Classic despite an almost perfect game by Irish guard Austin Carr, who hit 14 consecutive field goals in one stretch to go 19 of 24 from the floor, sank all five of his free throws, grabbed six rebounds and did not commit a turnover.\n\nMaravich set NCAA single-season records for most points (1,381) and highest average (44.5), finishing his LSU career with NCAA career marks for most points (3,667) and highest average (44.2). He also established an NCAA record for most successful free throws in a game when he converted 30 of 31 foul shots at Oregon State (see accompanying box). Maravich, who broke Oscar Robertson's NCAA career scoring mark with 13 regular-season games remaining, is the only player in NCAA Division I history to score more than 1,000 points and average over 40 points per game in each of three seasons. Pistol Pete finished with 694 more points than the Big O. Maravich had 56 games with at least 40 points in his three-year career, including a school- and SEC-record 69 in a 106-104 postgame brawl-marred defeat at Alabama when he was hampered by leg ailments. No other player has had more than 21 games with a minimum of 40. He averaged more than 50 points per game in a 10-game stretch spanning his last three contests as a junior and first seven as a senior. Incredibly, Maravich improved his field-goal accuracy and assists average each year. Combining scoring and assists, Maravich was responsible for a whopping 59.4 percent of LSU's offense during his career. He was outscored, however, by teammate Danny Hester in two of his three NIT appearances.\n\n\"Shooting is nothing. Anybody can shoot,\" Pistol Pete said. \"The big thrill is putting on a show for the crowd.\" His college teammates included Jeff Tribbett, who had been the playmaker at Lebanon (Ind.) High School for Purdue's Mount, and Russ \"Rusty\" Bergman, who went on to become Coastal Carolina's all-time winningest coach.\n\nMaravich (64) and Kentucky's Issel (51) each scored more than 50 points in the same game on February 21 when the Wildcats won, 121-105 (see accompanying box). It was one of eight times in Issel's senior season that he scored at least 40 to help Kentucky become the most prolific scoring team in SEC history (96.8 points per game).\n\nMount set a Big Ten Conference record with 61 points (13 of his 27 field goals would have been behind the current three-point line), but it wasn't enough to prevent a 108-107 setback against visiting Iowa. The Hawkeyes, snapping Purdue's school-record 30-game homecourt winning streak, went unbeaten in league play in coach Ralph Miller's final season at their helm before moving to Oregon State. They compiled a 5-9 Big Ten record the previous season.\n\nIowa had four players average more than 17 points per game on the Hawkeyes' way to a Big Ten-record 102.9-point average. They went undefeated in the league just one year after finishing in a tie for eighth place. Iowa's Johnson set a school single-game standard with 49 points against Northwestern. . . . Also setting school single-game scoring records were Auburn's John Mengelt (60 points vs. archrival Alabama), Loyola of New Orleans' Ty Marioneaux (53 vs. Virginia Commonwealth), NYU's James Signorile (50 vs. Herbert Lehman), Boston University's Jim Hayes (47 vs. Springfield) and John Conforti of St. Francis, N.Y. (45 vs. Wagner). . . . Maravich, Notre Dame's Carr (38.1 ppg), Purdue's Mount (35.4), Kentucky's Issel (33.9), SMU's Gene Phillips (28.5), Iowa's Johnson (27.9), Butler's Billy Shepherd (27.8), Florida's Andy Owens (27) and Northwestern's Dale Kelley (24.3) set school records for highest scoring average in a single season. . . . Niagara's Murphy, 5-9, finished his career as the only major-college player in the 20th Century shorter than 6-0 to score more than 2,500 points. His mark was shattered by St. Peter's Keydren Clark in 2005-06. Murphy has accounted for 19 of the 21 games with more than 40 points in Purple Eagles' history.\n\nVanderbilt, coached by Roy Skinner, suffered its first losing record (12-14) in 22 seasons. . . . Forward Bob Lienhard became Georgia's first All-SEC AP first-team selection in 16 years. . . . Kentucky forward Mike Pratt, an All-SEC first-team selection, went on to coach UNC Charlotte for four seasons from 1978-79 through 1981-82. . . . Georgia Tech center Rich Yunkus, a three-time NCAA Academic All-American, twice scored 47 points in a game (vs. Furman and North Carolina). His outburst against the Tar Heels is the highest-ever individual total versus a Dean Smith-coached team. . . . North Carolina lost five of its last seven outings to finish with an 18-9 record. It was the Tar Heels' last season in the 20th Century that they failed to win more than 20 games. Eddie Fogler, who led Carolina in assists, went on to coach two SEC schools (Vanderbilt and South Carolina).\n\nSophomore Julius Erving set a Massachusetts record with 20.9 rebounds per game in powering the 18-7 Minutemen to their most victories in 60 years of basketball. . . . Jim Larranaga, Providence's leading scorer for the second consecutive season, eventually coached Bowling Green, George Mason and Miami (Fla.). . . . Jarrett Durham, who led Duquesne in scoring for the second straight year, went on to become Robert Morris' all-time winningest coach in 12 seasons from 1983-84 through 1994-95. . . . New Hampshire's streak of consecutive losing seasons ended at 17 when Gerry Friel compiled a 12-11 record in his first year as coach of the Wildcats. . . . Fran O'Hanlon, who tied a Villanova record with 16 assists against Toledo, would later coach Lafayette in the NCAA playoffs. . . . Fran Dunphy, La Salle's assists leader with 4.35 per game, went on to become Penn's coach and directed the Quakers to nine NCAA Tournament appearances before accepting a similar job with Temple. . . . Scott Beeten, who averaged 11.4 points per game for Lehigh as a junior, eventually coached Albany. . . . Columbia's George Starke, who averaged 4.2 rebounds per game, became an offensive tackle with the Washington Redskins for the Super Bowl XVII champion after the 1982 strike-shortened NFL campaign. . . . Yale, in the second of 11 consecutive losing seasons, pulled off one of the year's biggest upsets with a 97-94 win over LSU in the Rainbow Classic final. . . . Niagara's Calvin Murphy scored a career-low 14 points against Canisius. It was one of only four games in his three seasons with the Purple Eagles where he tallied fewer than 22 points.\n\nJacksonville (27-2/coached by Joe Williams), New Mexico State (27-3/Lou Henson), St. Bonaventure (25-3/Larry Weise), South Carolina (25-3/Frank McGuire) and Army (22-6/Bob Knight) had their winningest seasons in school history. . . . Army, which didn't appear in the NCAA Tournament during the 20th Century, participated in the NIT for the seventh time in 10 years. The Cadets compiled a 13-9 NIT record (.591) in that span. . . . Jacksonville became the first university to average more than 100 points per game (100.3). The Dolphins also finished runner-up in four categories--field-goal shooting, rebounding scoring margin and won-lost percentage. . . . New Mexico State, coached by Lou Henson, finished among the top 12 in a final wire-service poll for the third straight season.\n\nOhio State, coached by Fred Taylor, led the country in both field-goal shooting (54.4 percent) and free-throw shooting (80.9). The Buckeyes were the first team to hit at least 80 percent of its foul shots in a single season. They were the first team in Big Ten history to have three players average more than 20 points per game--Sorenson (24.2), Jim Cleamons (21.6) and Jody Finney (20.6). OSU backup Jim Geddes pitched briefly for the Chicago White Sox in 1972 and 1973. . . . Indiana finished in last place in the Big Ten for the fourth time in five seasons. . . . Iowa opposed intrastate rival Iowa State for the first time in 36 years. . . . Ric Cobb, who paced Marquette in rebounding for the second straight season, went on to coach Wisconsin-Milwaukee for four years from 1995-96 through 1998-99. . . . Ron Snyder became the fifth different Miami (Ohio) player in six years to lead the Mid-American Conference in field-goal percentage. . . . Memphis State finished in the Missouri Valley cellar for the third time in as many seasons, but ended its MVC losing streak at 27 games with an 85-81 victory over Wichita State. Cincinnati was runner-up to Drake in the MVC race in the Bearcats' final season as a member of the league. . . . New St. Louis coach Bob Polk lost all 10 games decided by fewer than six points. He won 23 contests in this category over the next four years.\n\nDavidson of the Southern Conference became the only school since the end of World War II to go undefeated in back-to-back league seasons with different coaches. Terry Holland succeeded Lefty Driesell after his predecessor accepted a similar position at Maryland and Larry Brown began his nomadic head coaching career by resigning following only a couple of months at the Wildcats' helm. Brown reportedly departed primarily because Davidson didn't increase its recruiting budget and lower its high academic requirements for prospective recruits. He was also annoyed about the school's summer basketball camp and receiving bills for his temporary residence and carpeting he ordered for his office. . . . Western Kentucky, coached by John Oldham, went unbeaten in Ohio Valley Conference competition for the second time in five seasons. WKU was the only OVC member to go undefeated in league play during the 20th Century after the alliance was formed in 1949. . . . Jimmy Earle posted a winning record (15-11) in his initial season as Middle Tennessee State's coach although his first three defeats were against small colleges (Bethel, Bellarmine and Carson-Newman).\n\nVirginia Tech, coached by Howie Shannon, dropped five of its first six contests en route to compiling its only losing record (10-12) in a 31-year span from 1955-56 through 1985-86. The Hokies suffered their lone defeat to William & Mary (84-79) in a 21-game stretch of their series from 1966 through 1974. . . . Pittsburgh, coached by Buzz Ridl, compiled a 12-12 record for its first season in six years with more than seven victories.\n\nSouthern Mississippi's Wendell Ladner (32 vs. Pan American), Minnesota's Larry Mikan (28 vs. Michigan), DePaul's Ken Warzynski (28 vs. Harvard), St. Peter's Juan Jiminez (28 vs. Upsala), New Mexico State's Sam Lacey (27 vs. Hardin-Simmons), Brigham Young's Scott Warner (27 at Texas Tech), Tulsa's Dana Lewis (26 vs. McMurry, Tex.), Iowa State's Bill Cain (26 vs. Minnesota) and Weber State's Willie Sojourner (25 vs. West Texas State) set school single-game records for most rebounds.\n\nLou Carnesecca, who left St. John's for the ABA's New Jersey Nets, wasn't the only mentor to depart after the season for the pros. NBA expansion teams Cleveland (Bill Fitch/Minnesota) and Portland (Rolland Todd/UNLV) hired a college coach as did third-year NBA franchise Phoenix (Cotton Fitzsimmons/Kansas State). Two years later, the Blazers lured Jack McCloskey away from Wake Forest.\n\nSouthern California incurred a total of 19 defeats in the last two seasons, but the Trojans won at UCLA for the second straight year when the Bruins were ranked No. 1 in the country. . . . Protestors claimed BYU and the Mormon church discriminated against blacks. The worst incident occurred at Colorado State where angry students stormed the floor and threw objects at the court--including a flaming molotov cocktail. The bottle reached the floor but did not break and the cocktail was extinguished before it could do any damage. . . . Idaho State, coached by Dan Miller, won its last four games to compile a 13-11 record for the Bengals' first winning season in eight years. . . . Gregg Popovich, Air Force's captain and leading scorer (14.3 ppg), went on to become head coach and general manager of the San Antonio Spurs when they captured NBA championships in 1998-99 and 2002-03. . . . Oklahoma (19-9/coached by John MacLeod), which tied a school record for most defeats the previous season (7-19), lost fewer than 10 games for the first time in 21 years. The Sooners, who last appeared in the NCAA playoffs in 1947, made their NIT debut. . . . Baylor (15-9), coached by Bill Menefee, lost three straight SWC games by one point.\n\nOklahoma State's Hank Iba (767-338 record) and Butler's Tony Hinkle (557-393) retired after 41-year coaching careers. Iba served as the United States' head coach for the 1964, 1968 and 1972 Olympic Teams.\n\nIba, the only coach with six or more NCAA Tournament appearances to reach the regional finals every time, is hailed as the patriarch of basketball's first family of coaches. He had seven of his former Oklahoma State players eventually coach teams into the NCAA playoffs--John Floyd (Texas A&M), Jack Hartman (Kansas State), Don Haskins (Texas-El Paso), Moe Iba (Nebraska), Bud Millikan (Maryland), Doyle Parrack (Oklahoma City) and Eddie Sutton (Creighton, Arkansas, Kentucky, Oklahoma State).\n\nSix generations of major college coaches emanate from Iba, encompassing those coaches who were either players or assistant coaches for Iba or later generations of coaches with ties to the sage. By the end of the century, more than 120 Division I schools had at least one head coach who could trace his ancestry to Iba in his family tree of coaches. \"Mr. Iba's system was so sound and he inspired such confidence that there was never any question in my mind that his philosophy offered the best opportunity to be successful,\" Sutton said. \"The things he gave us are as valid today as they were 30 years ago.\"\n\n1970 NCAA Tournament\n\nSummary: Kentucky, after absorbing just one regular-season defeat (at Vanderbilt), was ranked No. 1 in the nation entering the tourney although starting guard Mike Casey missed the entire campaign because of injuries suffered in an auto accident. But UK lost to eventual NCAA Tournament runner-up Jacksonville, 106-100, in the Mideast Regional final. Casey was the Wildcats' leading scorer as a sophomore in 1967-68 with 20 points per game and their second-leading scorer as a junior the next year with a 19.1-point average. JU wound up losing to UCLA in the championship game, 80-69, when the Bruins' Sidney Wicks, 6-8, blocked five shots of 7-2 All-American center Artis Gilmore to help them overcome a nine-point deficit midway through the first half. UCLA enjoyed a 35 to 8 advantage in free-throw attempts, including a 19-2 edge in the opening half. UCLA is the only NCAA titlist to have four players average more than 15 points per game - Wicks (18.6), John Vallely (16.3), Henry Bibby (15.6) and Curtis Rowe (15.3).\n\nStar Gazing: LSU's Pete Maravich became the only three-time first-team All-American to fail to appear in the NCAA playoffs. LSU lost to UCLA by 49 points (133-84) just before Christmas. . . . Kentucky's Dan Issel (44 points vs. Notre Dame in regional semifinal), Santa Clara's Dennis Awtrey (37 vs. Long Beach State in regional third-place contest) and Jacksonville's Artis Gilmore (30 vs. Western Kentucky in first round) set existing school NCAA playoff single-game scoring records. Gilmore tied his JU mark vs. Iowa in regional semifinal.\n\nOne and Only: Notre Dame guard Austin Carr became the only player to score more than 60 points in a single playoff game and the only individual to score more than 43 points at least twice. Carr tallied 35 of Notre Dame's 54 first-half points en route to a school-record 61 points against Ohio University in the first round of the Southeast Regional (see accompanying play-by-play). Carr accounted for half of the eight games in NCAA Tournament history of more than 46 points. He scored 52 points in the next round, but it wasn't enough to prevent a 109-99 defeat against Kentucky as the Wildcats' Issel scored 44 in the only tourney game in history to have two players tally more than 40. Carr's 52-point playoff outburst is the highest ever in a losing effort.\n\nCelebrity Status: Bruce Bochte, who collected eight rebounds in a loss against Utah State and 10 points in a victory against Jerry Tarkanian-coached Long Beach State in the West Regional, went on to become an A.L. All-Star first baseman with the Seattle Mariners in 1979 when he posted career highs in batting average (.316), doubles (38) and RBI (100).\n\nNumbers Game: The best composite winning percentage when four teams converged at a Final Four occurred as UCLA (26-2), New Mexico State (26-2), Jacksonville (26-1) and St. Bonaventure (25-1) combined for a 103-6 record (.945). New Mexico State, JU and St. Bonaventure were making their only Final Four appearances. . . . New Mexico State's Sam Lacey grabbed a tourney-high 24 rebounds in an 87-78 triumph over Drake in the Midwest Regional final. . . . Jacksonville outlasted Iowa, 104-103, in the Mideast Regional semifinals on Pembrook Burrows' put-back with three seconds remaining. . . . UCLA snapped Long Beach State's school-record 19-game winning streak with an 88-65 victory in the West Regional semifinals. . . . Rice made its lone national postseason tournament appearance in a 36-year span from 1955 through 1990. . . . North Carolina State coach Norman Sloan posted his first NCAA playoff victory in his 14th major-college season.\n\nWhat Might Have Been: Dave Cowens-led Florida State, which split two games with national runner-up Jacksonville (losing at JU by just four points), was ineligible for the tourney because of NCAA probation. Cowens went on to coach the NBA's Boston Celtics and Charlotte Hornets. . . . JU might have given UCLA more of a tussle in the title game if the Dolphins didn't redshirt Ernie Fleming, a junior college teammate of Artis Gilmore. Fleming averaged 24.4 ppg in 1971-72 when he set a school single-game scoring standard with 59 points. . . . St. Bonaventure's only regular-season defeat was by two points at Villanova. But the Bonnies' biggest loss against Villanova was in a 23-point victory over the Wildcats in the East Regional final when All-American center Bob Lanier tore a knee ligament in a freak accident. He was clipped accidentally by future Detroit Pistons teammate Chris Ford, who later became coach of the Boston Celtics.\n\nNCAA Champion Defeats: At Oregon (13-point margin) and Southern California (1). . . . LSU's Maravich and Georgia Tech center Rich Yunkus shared the distinction for having the highest single-game scoring output against UCLA during the season with 38 points apiece.\n\nScoring Leader: Austin Carr, Notre Dame (158 points, 52.7 ppg).\n\nRebounding Leader: Artis Gilmore, Jacksonville (93 rebounds, 18.6 rpg).\n\nHighest Rebounding Average: David Hall, Kansas State (40 rebounds, 20 rpg).\n\nAll-Tournament Team\n\nJimmy Collins, G, Sr., New Mexico State (46 points in final two games)\n\nArtis Gilmore, C, Jr., Jacksonville (48 points, 37 rebounds)\n\nCurtis Rowe, F, Jr., UCLA (34 points, 23 rebounds)\n\nJohn Vallely, G, Sr., UCLA (38 points, 11 rebounds)\n\n*Sidney Wicks, F, Jr., UCLA (39 points, 34 rebounds)\n\n*Named Most Outstanding Player.\n\nChampionship Team Results\n\nRegional Semifinal: UCLA 88 (Bibby/Wicks team-high 20 points), Long Beach State 65 (Trapp 20)\n\nRegional Final: UCLA 101 (Rowe/Wicks 26), Utah State 79 (Roberts 33)\n\nNational Semifinal: UCLA 93 (Vallely 23), New Mexico State 77 (Collins 28)\n\nChampionship Game: UCLA 80 (Rowe 19), Jacksonville 69 (Gilmore 19)"}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-ucla-jacksonville-1970-20140416-story.html", "page_content": "A former Jacksonville University basketball coach claims in a new book that the school\u2019s 1970 NCAA title game against UCLA was -- how would one put this delicately? -- rigged.\n\nThomas Errol Wasdin was an assistant on the Jacksonville Dolphins team that made a surprise run to the title game before losing to John Wooden\u2019s powerhouse Bruins.\n\nWasdin, in his memoir, \u201cOnce a Coach, Always a Coach,\u201d written with award-winning Florida-based sportswriter Peter Kerasotis, claims that \u201cthe message we got was that we weren\u2019t going to win because the officials weren\u2019t going to let us. The Establishment didn\u2019t want it. Our chances were very thin.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut why? Jacksonville, Wasdin says, was considered a renegade program that didn\u2019t conform to establishment rules. The Dolphins wore \u201cAfro\u201d haircuts and warmed up before games to \u201cSweet Georgia Brown,\u201d the song associated with the Harlem Globetrotters.\n\nJacksonville players, led by 7-foot-2 center Artis Gilmore, used to dunk during warm-ups even though the slam dunk had been outlawed in college basketball.\n\nWasdin notes that UCLA shot 35 free throws in the game, compared with just eight for Jacksonville. Yeah, so? Well, how could that be if Gilmore was being guarded by Sidney Wicks, who was only 6-foot-8?\n\nJacksonville averaged 29.3 foul shots per game that year. Wicks is remembered in that game for several spectacular blocks against the taller Gilmore. Yet, Wasdin claims that many of the blocks should have been \u201cgoal tending\u201d calls because Gilmore was shooting down at the basketball as he released his hook shot.\n\nEven UCLA players interviewed for the book don\u2019t argue that point. OK, but does that really constitute a conspiracy?\n\nThe book notes that UCLA shot 27 more foul shots than Jacksonville, still the largest title-game differential in NCAA history. The second-highest differential is Arizona\u2019s 24 foul-shot advantage in its win over Kentucky in 1997.\n\nDid \u201cThe Establishment\u201d not want Kentucky to win that year?\n\nHere\u2019s the most compelling counter-argument to Wasdin\u2019s theory: UCLA won the game by 11 points, 80-69. It was UCLA\u2019s fourth straight NCAA title and its sixth in seven seasons. UCLA was really, really, REALLY good. John Wooden\u2019s players were excellent and disciplined defenders who did not foul a lot.\n\nThe chapter on the 1970 game was titled \u201cThis time Goliath won ... with some help.\u201d\n\nBut wait a minute: Wasn\u2019t it Jacksonville that had Goliath in Gilmore? And wasn\u2019t Sidney Wicks more like David?\n\nALSO:\n\n49ers might already be finished with Aldon Smith\n\nFelix Trinidad reaches debt deal after alleged $63-million loss\n\nUFC\u2019s Joe Rogan says Rounda Rousey would beat Floyd Mayweather"}, {"url": "https://www.liquisearch.com/1969_ncaa_mens_division_i_basketball_tournament", "page_content": "The 1969 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament involved 25 schools playing in single-elimination play to determine the national champion of men's NCAA Division I college basketball.

Including consolation games in each of the regions and an overall consolation game, a total of 29 games were played.\n\nUCLA, coached by John Wooden, won the national title with a 92-72 victory in the final game over Purdue, coached by George King. Lew Alcindor of UCLA was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\n\nIn the game, John Vallely, the \"Money Man\", scored 22 points and Alcindor had 37 points, to give UCLA a win over Purdue, which is Wooden's alma mater.

Following the Hawkeyes' prodigious hard-court accomplishments that season was unforgettable. I remember a friend remarking in amazement that Iowa could walk the ball up the court all night and still score 100 points.\n\nThe most painful memory of the season was unquestionably the heartbreaking last-second loss to Jacksonville. Fifty years later, I'm almost over that.\n\nThe high point of the season for me, though, was one evening at Pagliai's Pizza when some fraternity brothers and I looked up and saw Fred Brown and John Johnson walk through the door. We could hardly believe our eyes, as we suddenly found ourselves breathing the rarefied air of our Hawkeye basketball heroes.\n\nHaving moved to Seattle in summer 1979, I was fortunate enough to watch Brown and Johnson play with the SuperSonics. It was a glorious time to be a fan.\n\nRandy Hilfman (72BA, 75JD)\n\nWoodinville, Washington\n\n\"Peace, War, and Basketball\" brought back more than a few fond memories. When I moved into my Hillcrest dorm room in fall 1967 as a freshman, my roommate was a sophomore who knew many Hawkeye football and basketball athletes. His good friend was Chad Calabria (70BBA).\n\nMy roommate and I attended basketball practices in the old Iowa Field House. The practice court was in the middle of a dirt floor and surrounded by a canvas wall that would keep the balls on the court. My memory of Coach Ralph Miller was his gruff, raspy voice grouching constantly at the players and his chain smoking. He dropped his cigarette butts outside the floor onto the dirt, leaving the entire area covered. We all know his coaching style was successful, which brings me to another favorite memory: the team's arrival at the Iowa City airport following its win over Purdue that clinched the Big Ten title.\n\nOur entire Fiji fraternity was among the wild crowd waiting to meet the team plane when the Hawkeyes returned from West Lafayette. The plane was a World War II-era DC-3 twin engine taildragger. As it was taxiing up, students began to swarm it. The pilot spun the plane around to prevent students from running into the turning propellers. Miller and the team deplaned and worked their way through the cheering crowd. I was able to get close enough to attempt to pat Coach on the back. Just as I reached out, someone hit my arm from behind, and I poked Miller in the cheek. I will never forget the look he gave me. If it could have killed, I would have been dead on the spot. Miller was not warm and fuzzy.\n\nOn another note, I have always credited not having to take finals at the end of the 1970 spring semester to Iowa Governor Bob Ray (12LLD). I believe he shut down all three state universities at the same time immediately after the Kent State tragedy. It was difficult being an ROTC cadet on campus during this era. My fraternity brother/roommate and I started out as best friends in fall 1969, and by spring 1970, he was a black armband-wearing, anti-war protestor who left the fraternity at the end of the year and has not been seen or heard from since.\n\nLarry Reed (71BBA)\n\nWaxhaw, North Carolina\n\nI read with interest the story of the 1969-70 Hawkeye basketball team, which, as a resident and fellow at UI Hospitals & Clinics, I was privileged to watch. They were exciting. However, my vote for the greatest team in Iowa history goes to the 1954-56 teams that won the Big Ten twice in two years, played in the Final Four, and went to the national championship game in 1956 before losing to Bill Russell and the undefeated University of San Francisco Dons. The 1955-56 squad had almost an identical record with the 1969-70 team, going 13-1 versus 10-0 in the Big Ten and 20-6 versus 20-5 in the regular season. The earlier team players were as close off the court as on. I found more excitement watching them.\n\nBy the way, I confess to almost dreading receiving the Iowa Magazine. I find that when it comes, I can't put the damned thing down!\n\nJohn W. McBride (59BA, 62MD, 70R)\n\nSt. Paul, Minnesota\n\nI very much enjoyed your article on the 1969-70 basketball team and the anti-war demonstrations that were occurring that school year. I was on campus as a junior journalism major and assistant sports editor of The Daily Iowan and also covered the demonstrations as a stringer for The Waterloo Courier.\n\nI was in Columbus, Ohio, for the game against Jacksonville. My recollection is that Iowa fans, while loud, were not the predominant group at the game. The arena was loaded with fans from Kentucky waving their blue and white pom-poms. In the first game between Kentucky and Notre Dame, Iowa fans supported the underdog Irish, who lost the game. Despite the fact Jacksonville had perhaps 200 fans at the game (the school only recently had converted from a two-year junior college to a four-year school), my recollection is that the Kentucky crowd, in retribution for Iowa fans' support of the Irish, loudly adopted Jacksonville as the team to support. The following day, the Iowa fans as a tit-for-tat loudly supported Jacksonville in its win over Kentucky, so much so that the Jacksonville cheerleaders for a time actually led cheers before the Iowa fans, located across the arena from the Jacksonville supporters.\n\nDuane Swinton (71BA, 77JD)\n\nSpokane, Washington\n\nI was a freshman at Iowa during that season and for some reason decided to spend some of my precious discretionary funds for a season ticket to the basketball games. (The football teams of that time were disappointing, and the Hawkeyes were rumored to have a promising basketball team, so I took the plunge and bought the ticket. I think it was around $20 for students back then. One of my best entertainment purchases ever.)\n\nThe games were played at the Field House, which was just across the street from the new Rienow men's dorms where I resided, so it was an easy walk, regardless of the Iowa winter weather. I remember the Field House had numerous supporting columns located within the bleachers that partially blocked the view from certain seats and was thankful I was not near one. The team played to a packed house, and we watched some games more from a standing than sitting position because of the cheering and constant excitement. The games were a great diversion from all the tumultuous events of the time.\n\nThat team was electrifying to watch, and it could pass the ball and work for the open shot like no other team of the time. Beating Purdue and its hot shooter Rick Mount was a season highlight, and I remember how nervous the Iowa fans were over that away game and its consequences. I also remember how the crowds cheered when Coach Ralph Miller would insert Glenn \"The Stick\" Vidnovic into a critical situation. He always seemed to ignite the team with his defensive efforts. John Johnson was the star, though, and he could hit a running jump shot from more than 30 feet away. It was almost automatic, and there seemed to be little to no arch in his shots.\n\nThe Vietnam War was always on one's mind in those days, especially for draft-eligible males, and those games were a welcome diversion from the reality of a turbulent world. Thanks for bringing back the pleasant memories.\n\nTed McKim (73BBA, 75BSCE, 77MS)\n\nClermont, Florida\n\nCLIPPING COURTESY MARY WINDER A clipping of a 1970 article about the Hawkeyes in the Des Moines Register\n\nThere was a lot of discord on campus at that time. The basketball team was something that gave us some relief from what was going on. As the season went on, the excitement kept building. It was fun going to the practices and games in the Field House and watching Coach Ralph Miller work his magic.\n\nThe Jacksonville game was a battle. My seat was in the eighth row behind the Jacksonville bench, and I was devastated when they put the rebound in to beat us. The Hawks were in my opinion the best passing team I have ever seen in college basketball. I will never forget that game and was happy that I was one of a select group of people who got to witness it.\n\nDave Griesbach, 73BSPh\n\nEldridge, Iowa\n\nI was one of those fans who packed the Field House for every game. I remember when Iowa won despite Purdue's Rick Mount scoring 61 points, and I was at the airport when the team returned to Iowa City. I have seen many games since then, but none compare to that season when the Hawks scored more than 100 points per game with no 3-point line or shot clock. Incredible!\n\nMark Leiserowitz (72BBA)\n\nHouston\n\nYour article stirred a lot of memories. After graduating from Iowa in June 1965 and from Northwestern Law School in 1968, I was drafted into the Army. During Iowa's great 1969-70 season, I was stationed at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. Jim Zabel's game broadcasts could usually be heard in southern Arizona, but the sound quality varied. Taking no chances for the Jacksonville game, I drove into the mountains near the fort to maximize reception. Fortunately, there was no other traffic since any passersby would probably be frightened by the yelling, steering wheel-pounding and fist-pumping accompanying the game. I was convinced Iowa was going to win until Pembrook Burrows' last-second put-back.\n\nTwo months later, the Army discharged me, and I resumed my legal career in Cleveland, where I had a chance to watch the Cleveland Cavaliers' first-ever draft pick, John Johnson, play on a regular basis.\n\nMy legal education in Chicago ended during a tumultuous period in that city's history, and my legal career began when the Kent State shootings occurred. The Hawkeyes' 1969-70 season provided a helpful respite from the divisions and turmoil of the mid-1960s. It was and is great to be a Hawkeye!\n\nM. Neal Rains (65BA)\n\nWestlake, Ohio\n\nI was 9 years old during the 1969-70 basketball season. Listening to my two-way radio from the front porch of my house on Bowery Street in Iowa City, I knew unusual things were happening not only here, but all over the nation. I heard police calls of smashed windows to downtown buildings and sit-ins blocking Iowa Avenue.\n\nAmid all the chaos, there was this constant: an incredible group of Hawkeye basketball players and the towering figure of Ralph Miller orchestrating them. They are still the best true team I have ever seen in my life. Downtown Freddie Brown could hit a shot from literally anywhere in the arena and could dribble the ball like a magician. J.J. (John Johnson) was the toughest, refuse-to-lose competitor on any court. Glenn \"the Stick\" Vidnovic never seemed to miss a free throw, Ben McGilmer was a super sub, and Chad Calabria was one smooth guard.\n\nI remember the noise during games in the old Field House rattling my eardrums. My dad knew a security guard outside the Hawkeyes' locker room who let us go inside to meet my Iowa basketball heroes. They were all so nice to a kid they didn't know. They all talked with me and gave me autographs. That's when I figured out how great sports were, and I have been hooked ever since.\n\nThe experience made me realize the color of a person's skin shouldn't matter. It helped me decide to major in journalism at the UI, become a Phi Beta Kappa Scholar, and achieve my dream of becoming a sportswriter (when I realized as a teen that my other dream of pitching for the Chicago Cubs wasn't going to happen!).\n\nI will never forget this team or the special bond it created between me and my parents watching them. This team and my parents instilled in me a love of sports and the lessons it can teach both on and off the court. These Hawkeyes shaped not only my love of playing sports, but also my life and occupational choice. Their kindness to me in that locker room after they had just got done playing their hearts out shaped me to become an empathetic, kind person and to desire a job that could help others. That's why I found work as a special education para-educator when my sportswriter job ended.\n\nJim Lynch (83BA)\n\nCoralville\n\nI was a student in engineering during that 1969-70 season, and the men's basketball team was great to watch. I can concur that the noise in the old Field House was deafening. But here is the item I wanted to share with you:\n\nMany years after that season, as I was working here in Iowa, the company I worked for hired Johnny Orr to be a spokesman. One time I was able to have a conversation with him. I remembered that Orr was coach at Michigan while Ralph Miller was coach at Iowa. It seems they were pretty good friends and talked a lot about basketball.\n\nDuring that 1970 season, Purdue had Rick Mount, who was among the nation's top scorers. Michigan played them and lost, allowing Mount to score 63 points. Miller, who was big on defense, called Orr the next morning and said, \"What the hell kind of defense did you play?\" (according to Orr). So, a week later, Iowa played Purdue. Mount scored 65 points, so Orr had to let Miller know what he thought. Calling him up the next day, he also asked, \"What kind of defense was that?\" to which Miller responded, \"Yeah, but we won.\"\n\nLeon D. Hofer (72BSEE)\n\nWest Des Moines, Iowa\n\nI was a sophomore during the 1969-70 Hawkeye men's basketball season and attended all the games. At that time, seats were assigned based on years of enrollment at the UI, so my seat was on the top deck in the corner near the band. My seat was behind the bass drum and next to the cymbal player. The games were rocking and the noise was unbelievable, but so much fun. We watched the NCAA tournament in the dorm and could not believe when Pembrook Burrows III tipped the missed shot to beat us. I'll never forget his name.\n\nI also was a member of the Air Force ROTC, so I remember well all the war protests and the fact we could not wear our uniform to campus. I took pass/fail on all my courses and later had to explain why my transcript was unique with all Ps for grades. I served in the Air Force for 28 years, retiring in September 2000. Thanks for the trip down memory lane!\n\nDoug Hammerstrom (72BBA)\n\nSchertz, Texas\n\nWhat an outstanding team to watch! I remember the great teamwork they had, Coach Ralph Miller's chain-smoking, and how he always gave straight answers to reporters' questions after a game. If they played terribly, he didn't sugarcoat it.\n\nDaniel Schleisman (72BS)\n\nIowa City\n\nThank you for the article chronicling the 1969-70 Hawkeye basketball season. It brought back lots of memories. I was a first-year law student at Iowa in 1969-70 and remember that season well. I was an Iowa State University graduate and a member of its men's varsity basketball team from 1965 to 1969, so I was not an Iowa fan when the '69-70 basketball season got underway. However, since Iowa's Tom Schulze (70BA) and I played together on Des Moines Roosevelt High School's 1965 state championship team, I went to every Hawkeye home game that championship season. By midseason, I was an enthusiastic fan. I had never witnessed a more high-powered offensive machine at the collegiate level.\n\nThree things stand out to me about that 1969-70 team: First, the Hawkeyes scored baskets so quickly that, when I tried to keep score in my program during the games, invariably Iowa would score before I could credit an opponent's basket, and I would have to ask a friend, \"Who just scored for Iowa?\" Second, I remember that Adolph Rupp made his Kentucky players go to the locker room at halftime of the Iowa-Notre Dame Mideast Regional consolation game because his players were shell-shocked by the Hawkeyes' huge halftime lead over the Irish. After all, Rupp's team had barely survived Notre Dame two days before, and now the team that lost to Jacksonville (Rupp's next opponent) by a point was trouncing the Irish. Rupp didn't want his players to get too psyched out by watching any more of the Iowa-Notre Dame game. Third, I agree that if Iowa had beaten Jacksonville, the Hawks could have gone on to beat UCLA and win the national title\u2014and this admission is coming from a former Cyclone player and current Cyclone fan.\n\nThe 1969-70 season was truly a great year for Iowa Hawkeye basketball and its fans. Thanks again for the memories!\n\nTom Kreamer (72JD)\n\nLeawood, Kansas\n\nJim Snyder's excellent article completely captured the 1970 Hawkeye team.\n\nWe would go to the Field House, and if you sat high enough in the stands, huge steel beams might block your view. You had to almost sit in the lap of the person next to you to see the other end of the court. Crowds were so loud that the old building shook. Fans would stomp their feet and the decibels were deafening. We occasionally felt particles from the ceiling fall during the game.\n\nHow many points would that team have scored with a 3-point line? Our fans got to the point we knew the Hawks could outscore anybody. Defense be damned.\n\nFive friends and I made the trip to Columbus, Ohio, to see Iowa's heroic effort against those two Jacksonville 7-footers. The Hawks had no fear and came oh, so close! In the consolation game, the Six Pack showed the spirit of champions when it shot the lights out with a 75-point half against Austin Carr and Notre Dame. Toward the end of the game, the legendary Adolph Rupp walked into the arena with his Kentucky team. He did a visible double-take when he looked up at the scoreboard. You could sense Rupp must have been saying to himself, \"Glad we're not playing those guys.\"\n\nOne final note: As a TV journalist, I shot film of John Wooden's final game in 1975 in San Diego. Wooden was a great coach, but I have no doubt Ralph Miller would have given UCLA a much better 1970 championship game than Jacksonville. A lot of us who flocked to Iowa games in that 1969-70 season honestly believe the Six Pack would have taken one of Wooden's national championship trophies and brought it back to Iowa City.\n\nJon Janes (70BA)\n\nTopeka, Kansas\n\nI was a sophomore in 1969-70 and dreamed of being a college basketball player. Our house in Quadrangle Residence Hall played in the finals for an intramural championship against a team that mainly included football players such as Dennis Green (71BS) and Kenny Price. I played and coached the Quad team. Fred Brown watched for a couple minutes, then left. Herschel Epps (73BGS) flatly swung his right elbow rebounding. It landed against my front teeth, and I was out of the game until the second half. We lost.\n\nMy greatest experience in college was the second half of the Big Ten basketball season. I remember the Field House stands were full by 7 p.m. when the games started at 7:30 p.m. The Hawkeyes were a great shooting and passing team, and the crowd loved every minute.\n\nKirk Carter (72BS)\n\nMonroe, Iowa\n\nI will always remember the deafening noise inside the Field House. I was only 11 years old at the time, and my oldest brother was attending the UI. We enjoyed attending a couple games, as that was a huge treat at that time. It is hard to imagine how many points this team would have scored per game with a 3-point line! The Hawks were amazing moving the basketball and making shots. The Miller Six Pack was the best Iowa TEAM ever!\n\nGary Zittergruen (86MA)\n\nWaverly, Iowa\n\nI created a handmade poster in 1970 when I was in junior high school. It read \"We Love Hawks the Best,\" and there is a heart for the \"o\" in the word \"Love.\" My mother took a few of my friends and me to meet the bus at the old Field House where the Iowa Hawkeye basketball team was dropped off after an away game. They flew in that evening. I remember it was dark and very cold.\n\nFIELD HOUSE PHOTO: UI LIBRARIES UNIVERSITY ARCHIVES; POSTER PHOTO COURTESY MARY WINDER\n\nSeveral of my friends also made posters. We waited and waited in the cold. My mother wanted to take us home, but we begged to stay. The bus finally arrived, and our little group cheered and waved our posters. I'm sure the players were tired, but they were quite gracious to us. Several of the players signed my poster: John Johnson, Glenn Vidnovic, Chad Calabria, Ben McGilmer, and Fred Brown. I still remember how excited I was! I kept that poster on display in my bedroom for many years.\n\nMary Hyman Winder (77BS)\n\nTroy, Kansas"}, {"url": "https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2020-02-20/why-1970-final-four-stands-alone-college-basketball-history", "page_content": "Fifty years later, it remains one of the most unusual Final Fours ever held. There was the All-American who didn\u2019t get to play. The coach with the lucky suit that could glow in the dark \u2014 white double-breasted blazer, watermelon red shirt, powder blue pants. The 7-footer who wasn\u2019t even the tallest guy in his own lineup. And the teams themselves \u2014 a quartet that would be unfathomable today. They\u2019d destroy every office pool bracket.\n\nThere was St. Bonaventure, the tiny school of under 3,000 students from western New York, led by future NBA stalwart Bob Lanier, with his 29 points and 16 rebounds a game. Except he blew out his knee in the second half of the regional championship game, and watched the Final Four from a hospital bed.\n\nTHE CRYSTAL BALL: 68 predictions for March Madness, made in February\n\nThere was New Mexico State from the far reaches of Las Cruces, with star Jimmy Collins, who rode a bus four days from his home in Syracuse to first get to school.\n\nThere was Jacksonville, nearly as small as St. Bonaventure, which only six years before had been an NAIA program. Or as a motel marquee in Bowling Green, Kentucky asked when the Dolphins were ready to face Western Kentucky in the NCAA tournament ... Jacksonville who? \u201cOur guys got a little excited about that,\u201d coach Joe Williams said the other day, from his home in Mississippi. But once you saw the Dolphins, you never forgot them \u2014 with their 100-point-a-game offense, their twin 7-footers Artis Gilmore and Pembrook Burrows III, their coach Williams with a wardrobe as loud as his team\u2019s stat sheet. Plus, their practice routine to the Harlem Globetrotters\u2019 theme of Sweet Georgia Brown.\n\nYeah, Jacksonville was . . . different. A loose, fun-loving bunch who would just as soon bury you with 105 points as look at you. They had a good time, they sang in practice, Burrows the leader of the choir. People called them The Mod Squad. Old-schoolers gasped in disbelief. \u201cAfter they saw us practice up there,\u201d Williams mentioned about the Final Four, \u201ca writer said if we won, it would set basketball back 20 years.\u201d\n\nPURSUIT OF PERFECTION: The 20 most important things to know about undefeated San Diego State\n\nNot that any of these three teams were shockers to make long tournament runs. Jacksonville arrived at the Final Four with a 26-1 record, St. Bonaventure 25-1, New Mexico State 26-2. But looking at them from 2020, the collection seems other-worldly.\n\nEven, the established power of the quartet, UCLA, was something of a surprise. True, there had just been the unprecedented feat of three consecutive national championships, and John Wooden was in his full Westwood wizardry. But Lew Alcindor was in the NBA as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, while Bill Walton was still in high school. This particular band of Bruins was supposed to be the dead spot in between.\n\n\u201cThe overall picture was that we were with the team without,\u201d team captain and guard John Vallely said a half-century later. \u201cWe went all the way from 30-0 to 28-2. I always share with everybody when I do a talk about those days, Pauley Pavilion was in an uproar, because we were going downhill.\u201d\n\nThey all gathered in Cole Fieldhouse at the University of Maryland to settle an NCAA tournament that began with only 25 teams. The record will show that Jacksonville beat Lanier-less St. Bonaventure 91-83 in the semifinals. Without the 6-11 Lanier, the Bonnies had no player taller than 6-5 to go against the Jacksonville trees, and Gilmore had 29 points and 21 rebounds. Probably having to foul to try to contend with the size, St. Bonaventure was outscored from the line 37-15.\n\nUCLA whipped past New Mexico State 93-77, with the balance of the Bruins \u2014 all five starters scored in double figures and combined for 91 points \u2014 offsetting Collins\u2019 28. It was the third consecutive year UCLA had knocked the Aggies out of the tournament. \u201cYou get a complex after a while,\u201d New Mexico State coach Lou Henson said that night.\n\nIn the championship game, the Bruins spotted the Dolphins an early nine-point lead but steadily regained control \u2014 more about how later \u2014 and won 80-69. Wooden accepted his sixth trophy and fourth in a row, and his dynasty rolled on.\n\nTHE ZION EFFECT: Duke's Tre Jones thinks Vernon Carey Jr. is playing in Zion Williamson's shadow\n\nFor the other three teams, it was one in many ways fleeting moment in time. In the 49 months of March since, New Mexico State has won three NCAA Tournament games, St. Bonaventure one, Jacksonville none.\n\nBut 50 years ago, they were on the main stage ...\n\nIt was the age of offense. LSU\u2019s Pete Maravich set a record that 1970 season which still stands, averaging 44.5 points. Notre Dame\u2019s Austin Carr scored 61 against Ohio in the NCAA tournament first round. Another record still on the books. New Mexico State averaged nearly 91 points a game, and the Aggies were only 10th in the nation in scoring. Jacksonville scored at least 103 points in a game 13 times and was the first Division I team to ever average 100 points in a regular season.\n\nUCLA was part of the sizzling offensive landscape, too, even though Alcindor had graduated after two losses in three championship seasons, to the considerable relief of the rest of the sport. The Walton Gang was two years away. But Wooden had weapons \u2014 Curtis Rowe, Vallely and Sidney Wicks had been the second, third and fourth leading scorers the season before. Henry Bibby was a smooth-shooting sophomore guard and Steve Patterson had developed an inside game, if only by practicing against Alcindor every day.\n\nThe first real sign that things hadn\u2019t changed all that much was the fifth game of the season, when LSU and Maravich visited Pauley Pavilion. Maravich got his points \u2014 38 of them. But the Bruins, especially Bibby and Vallely, also harassed him into an astonishing 18 turnovers. What a way to get a double-double. They stampeded the Tigers, 133-84.\n\n\u201cWe played our fundamental game, which was real contrary to what LSU had done,\u201d Vallely said. \u201cIt was all about Pistol Pete. I\u2019ll never forget Coach Wooden told me a story about how he went to a camp down in the South and he was talking with (LSU coach and Pete\u2019s father) Press Maravich, his friend, and he said, `Press, you\u2019re developing a monster here.\u2019 Maravich said, `Oh, no, I\u2019m developing the first million-dollar player in the NBA.\u2019\n\n\u201cSo there were very different goals. I can tell you this, if I had two turnovers at UCLA, I was on the bench.\u201d\n\nLater, there were UCLA defeats at Oregon and at home to USC, but the Bruins rolled into the tournament ranked No. 2. We focused on that which we could control,\u201d Vallely said. \u201cThe idea we had to win another championship in order to satisfy outside opinions, I don\u2019t think was very important to any of us. What we were concerned about was being the best we could be.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, 2400 miles across the continent, something remarkable was brewing at Jacksonville.\n\nWhen Williams took the job to build Jacksonville\u2019s program in 1964, he had to teach five classes, as well as coach basketball. He courted old friend Tom Wasdin to be his assistant. \u201cI got him a higher salary than mine because I needed the help. We had to sell tickets and raise money. We had a $500 recruiting budget when I went there. Someone let me use a station wagon and credit card and I would go on the road recruiting. A lot of times I would show up at high school at noon and watch film and then that night I would go to the next place and I\u2019d get there about 8 o\u2019clock and the mother would say, you must be hungry, and they\u2019d feed me.\u2019\u201d\n\nBy 1969, the Dolphins were 17-7 with strong guard play, especially Rex Morgan and his 26 points a game. Now, if only Williams could find some big men ...\n\nThe prize was the enormously gifted 7-2 Gilmore from Gardner-Webb, then a junior college, who Williams found by accident. Ernie Fleming was transferring to Jacksonville from Gardner-Webb and wrote Wasdin a letter, mentioning his friend named Artis, who happened to be 7-2. When Gilmore finally decided he\u2019d come, another 7-footer was already in the Jacksonville bag.\n\nNCAA TOURNAMENT CENTRAL: 2020 March Madness schedule, dates, locations\n\nPembrook Burrows didn\u2019t start growing until he went to high school and didn\u2019t play basketball until his senior year. When he graduated, he had two scholarship offers, and figured he didn\u2019t have much of a chance at either place, so went to work at an auto dealership near his home in Florida. \u201cCar jockey,\u201d he called his job. \u201cGet the cars off the lot to where they would be serviced.\u201d\n\nHe did play a lot of basketball on the playground courts, and hooked up with an AAU team, attending some tournaments where the college scouts collect. \u201cThey would announce the guys\u2019 names and what college they were from,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they got to my name, they just said `Pembrook Burrows\u2019 and that was the end of it.\u201d\n\nBut somebody noticed the 7-footer with no school. One day, his mother summoned him home, because there was a stranger waiting to see him. \u201cWhen I got home, there was this bald-headed white guy who looked like a detective,\u201d Burrows said. \u201cAnd when I pulled up, he was sitting on my porch with my mom. I\u2019m looking at him like, he looks like the police. I ain\u2019t done nothing.\u201d\n\nActually it was Jim Oler, coach of Brevard Junior College, with an offer to play. Burrows headed for Brevard, and by the time he was ready to move on to a regular college, he had a box with letters of interest from 250 schools.\n\nDuring his Brevard days, he had played against Gilmore. \u201cI was in awe he was that tall and that good.\u201d Two weeks after Burrows chose Jacksonville, he got word that Gilmore had made his selection, too. Jacksonville. Say whaaaat? Burrows was on the phone to Williams quicker than you could say, who\u2019s starting?\n\n\u201cHe asked us about it. We said `Pembrook, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re going to start, too,\u2019 \u201d Williams said.\n\n\u201cSo both of us ended up at Jacksonville,\u201d Burrows said. \u201cAnd the rest is history.\u201d\n\nSaid Gilmore, \u201cIt was nothing but a good positive relationship, very competitive. We both were unique in our contribution to the program. We just complimented each other.\u201d\n\nSTORIES BEHIND THE SUCCESS: 13 coaches (with 13 great stories) who could be the next great champion\n\nWilliams blended it all together \u2014 the Morgan-led perimeter game, with the two new giants in town \u2014 and it didn\u2019t take long for him to realize what he had. \u201cAbout the second or third day of practice, we were scrimmaging, and Tom and I went up on about the fourth or fifth row to watch,\u201d he said. \u201cWe looked at each other, can you believe this?\u201d\n\nLots of people couldn\u2019t. As Jacksonville began to pile up victories, the Dolphins became a sensation.\n\n\u201cThey had something in Paris about us being the tallest team. It was all over, not only in America,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThere was a picture of Rex Morgan standing on a chair measuring Artis and Pembrook. We got an awful lot of attention.\u201d\n\nEspecially in Jacksonville, a troubled city feeling the pain of the turbulent 1960s.\n\n\u201cIt was full of racial tension and people have said it was because of the team, it brought the city together,\u201d Burrows said. \u201cI think the team set an example because it was racially mixed with whites and blacks, and we\u2019re winning and now everybody is pulling for not just Jacksonville University\u2019s team, but the city of Jacksonville. I think the trend was, hey these guys can get along, they\u2019re winning games, they\u2019re putting Jacksonville on the map.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the basketball world wasn\u2019t quite sure what to make of the Dolphins. They were short on rules and long on fun. Also, they rolled up and down the court with a relentless intent to score. But there was purpose to their play, too, and how Williams coached them.\n\n\u201cOur rules were when you stepped on the floor, you had to play a hundred percent. And you had to go to class every day. And those were really the only rules we had. We enjoyed it, we played hard. I had to shorten practice sometimes they played so hard. The players told me, `We all made a vow that we were going to play harder than anybody ever played because of the way you treated us.\u2019 So I let them do things they wanted to do because they were such good kids. And every one of them graduated.\u201d\n\nLATEST RANKINGS: NET rankings | AP Top 25 Poll | Top 16 Committee Reveal\n\nBy March, they were 17-1, the lone loss 89-83 at Florida State, later atoned for with an 85-81 win over the Seminoles at home. They had become a story, but how long would the novelty last in the cauldron of the tournament? The Final Four? Jacksonville? Are you kidding?\n\n\u201cI think the only person who had that vision was probably Rex Morgan,\u201d Burrows said. \u201cHe was a hard competitor. The attitude everybody had was, we had a good team and were having fun beating everybody. We never had an idea of getting to the finals, not until it happened.\u201d\n\nThe NCAA assigned the Dolphins a brutal route. First, No. 12 ranked Western Kentucky. Jacksonville won 109-96. Next, No. 7 Iowa. That was nearly the end of the road, with Gilmore fouled out, but a Burrows tip-in in the last second saved the Dolphins, 104-103. Next, with a trip to the Final Four magically on the table, they faced No. 1 Kentucky in the regional championship. The ultimate mismatch in pedigree.\n\n\u201cCertainly, we acknowledged the fact that it was University of Kentucky with their history,\u201d Gilmore said. \u201cAnd Jacksonville was a nobody. We were probably motivated a little extra.\u201d\n\nMorgan had 28 points, Gilmore 24 points and 20 rebounds. Kentucky star Dan Issel fouled out with 10 minutes still left, having already scored 28. Jacksonville guard Vaughn Wedeking \u2014 a state high school track champion in the 440-yard dash in Indiana \u2014 lured Issel into a charge. Jacksonville won 106-100.\n\n\u201cWe woke up (the next day),\u201d Gilmore said, \u201cand recognized that we were enjoying a fairy tale.\u201d\n\nStill, there were always reminders the Dolphins came from a different place than the Kentuckys of the world. \u201cAfter we beat Kentucky,\u201d Williams said, \u201cit was a snowy cold night and some people from the tournament took us out to eat, and we had to collect money to pay for the meal. It was too nice a restaurant for us.\u201d According to one story, they borrowed from the radio play-by-play man.\n\nWe will never know if Jacksonville\u2019s dreamy run would have been cut short at the Final Four, had Lanier not been hurt. St. Bonaventure had been on a roll.\n\n\u201cAs the season progressed and we got better and better I thought that we could win the championship. In my bones I just felt it,\u201d said Larry Weise, then the Bonnies coach. \u201cI think we would have handled Jacksonville because we matched up well. Lanier dominated the front court. I mean, he dominated the front court. Nobody could stop him, not one-on-one. And then when they doubled up, he had such a basketball IQ that he hit the open man. That was the edge I thought we had. That was the edge I thought we had on UCLA.\u201d\n\nThey were on their way to thrashing Villanova in the regional championship 97-74 with 26 points from Lanier, when he went down in a heap. Torn knee ligament. All that elation, all that sense of destiny ... gone.\n\n\u201cIn the locker room, you could hear a pin drop, and we won,\u201d Weise said. \u201cIt was a terrible emotional letdown. I went to the Final Four with a somber heart.\u201d\n\nSt. Bonaventure gave it a fight, but couldn\u2019t match the taller Dolphins. Their championship hopes ended amid searing mixed emotions. The best of times and the worst of times. \u201cYou can\u2019t take one without the other,\u201d Weise said. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible feeling. On the other hand, it\u2019s an excitement of the whole year. We had a shot at it.\u201d\n\nThat left UCLA vs. Jacksonville, aura vs. upstart.\n\n\u201cI guess the biggest thing I remember is they asked me if I was really nervous about having to face the tradition of UCLA,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI said no, we were worried about having to coach John Wooden.\u201d\n\nDON'T MISS A GAME: College basketball TV schedule, game times\n\nCould the Dolphins join another immortal underdog who pulled it off? Stories from 1970 mention how Jacksonville was assigned the same hotel Texas Western had used at the 1966 Final Four, when the Miners beat Kentucky and rattled the college basketball world. But the Dolphins must not have noticed. Williams says now he has no special recollection of where Jacksonville stayed.\n\nThe Dolphins broke to a 24-15 lead against UCLA, with Gilmore doing some real damage. That was until ...\n\n\u201cStarting out, we had Sidney in from of him, and he was getting some scores,\u201d Vallely said. \u201cSidney wanted to play behind him. He actually went to Coach Wooden during the game \u2014 we were behind \u2014 and he asked if he could go behind Artis. Turns out Sidney was right.\u201d\n\nWicks was 6-8, giving away six inches to Gilmore, but was confident he could go up and block his shots. Which he did, four times. But were they legal?\n\nBurrows: \u201cWhen Artis goes up and he\u2019s seven-foot, he has to be shooting down at the goal, but they were saying it wasn\u2019t goal tending. I hate to judge the officials. The call is what the call is.\u201d\n\nGilmore: \u201cReflecting back on that many years ago and the fact we lost, you can always find some reasons why maybe this happened, maybe that shouldn\u2019t have happened, maybe it was goal-tending, maybe it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nVallely: \u201c He was shooting the ball down probably, so there could be some truth to it. But you know what? We don\u2019t referee the game, we just play it.\u201d\n\nBy halftime, UCLA had a 41-36 lead and went on from there. Gilmore ended 9-for-29 shooting and was out-rebounded by Wicks 18-16. A 24-7 advantage in free throws didn\u2019t hurt the Bruins\u2019 cause, either.\n\nPut another UCLA championship team picture on the wall. And this one without an imposing superstar in the middle.\n\n\u201cPersonally I felt it was a huge achievement, because I don\u2019t think anybody expected us to be able to prevail that season, since we no longer had Kareem,\u201d Vallely said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question we feel really good about that. I do, at least, that we were able to keep going and that we were able to continue the legacy. Not much is said about it because Kareem and Bill became such big stars in the NBA. But we all contributed in a big way at UCLA, so it was fun to be a part of that bridge. Those of us who played totally understand what happened.\u201d\n\nWilliams made no mention of the officials then, and doesn\u2019t now. Or how a couple of his guards, including Morgan, were banged up. \u201cWe didn\u2019t make excuses, and we\u2019re not going to. Ever.\u201d He said that night UCLA was the better team. End of story. Later, a letter came from John Wooden thanking Williams. They became friends.\n\nOne other thing. That colorful lucky outfit Williams wore during the tournament? His players had given him a gift certificate for his birthday and he chose those colors because he figured they would like the style. Someone else noticed his wardrobe, too. Mrs. Nell Wooden. \u201c(John Wooden) said the worst thing that happened to him was his wife got upset that the way I dressed, that I made him look like an undertaker. She started buying him bright shirts, and the bad thing was, he had to wear them.\u201d\n\nThat Final Four comes with many postscripts.\n\nLanier went on to a Hall of Fame NBA career. He now fights bladder cancer and doesn\u2019t like to talk much about 1970, the foulness of fate painful even yet. Weise still has anguish, too. \u201cYou always say, what if? In fact, every time the NCAA tournament is on, I say what if? I think my players do, too.\u201d\n\nNew Mexico State\u2019s Henson would one day be back in the Final Four, with Illinois. As for the Aggies, they\u2019ve been past the first weekend of the NCAA Tournament but once since 1970, though they pushed Auburn to the limit in the first round last March.\n\nVallely lost a 12-year-old daughter to cancer, and needed a stem cell transplant to survive the disease himself. He now lives with wife Karen \u2014 sweethearts since the UCLA days \u2014 on Balboa Island, in a home that includes a picture of him with the 1970 net over his head. Plus a basketball with these words written on it, \u201cThank you for all you did that helped me. John Wooden.\u201d\n\nGilmore had a Hall of Fame NBA career and still does some TV work for Jacksonville University. \u201cFifty years later, I\u2019m sitting on the sideline after 18 years as a professional and now with grandkids, I\u2019m enjoying the fact it was part of the 50-year experience,\u201d he said of 1970.\n\nBurrows went into law enforcement in Florida and became the nation\u2019s tallest state patrolman. He\u2019s not an ardent follower of college basketball anymore, but \u201cwhenever they run that (UCLA) game on TV, I get a call.\u201d\n\nUCLA was the deserving champion, but Jacksonville was the most compelling story of 1970. The man who helped create it left for Furman the next season and later Florida State, but eventually retired from coaching at a relatively early age, ran a PBS station in Florida and coached Little League. Joe Williams turned 86 this month and that white coat from 1970 is long gone. He does have \u201ctwo labs and a bulldog and a couple of fishing ponds. I keep up with basketball some, but I\u2019m not avid like I used to be. I\u2019m avid at enjoying life.\u201d\n\nThe memories of 1970 are still there for him to treasure, even on dark days such as the call in 2016. On the other end of the line was a very ill Rex Morgan, his first star at Jacksonville, the spark plug of that fairy tale team.\n\n\u201cWe talked over the phone, and he told me he was about to die and there was nothing else they could do. He said `I love you, Joe\u2019. I told him `I love you too Rex.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSoon, Morgan was gone. So is Wedeking, Fleming and Chip Dublin and Danny Hawkins from the Dolphins. Also UCLA\u2019s Patterson, and Wooden. A half century has taken its toll.\n\nThe UCLA mystique that proved it did not need a legendary center to continue ... the hard luck of St. Bonaventure ... the frustration of New Mexico State ... the fascinating ascension of Jacksonville Who. Fifty years ago, they all shared a very unique Final Four. Only one of them has ever been back."}, {"url": "http://www.johnvallelymotivates.com/", "page_content": "\u201cJohn was a perfect fit into the goals of our meeting as well as teaching us all to be better team members on our quest to being \"One Ply Gem\". His thoughts and ideas were professional, educational and inspirational. The thing i liked the most was that he stayed the entire meeting and joined us for every meeting.....as well as social events, getting to know as many of our leaders as possible. I know our team appreciated his thoughts, and i have heard many comments about how everyone was impressed that he hung around for the entire meeting.\u201d Gary Robinette President & CEO\n\nPly Gem Industries, Inc. \u201cIt is with great pleasure and respect that I write a testimonial for Mr. John Vallely. As a fellow Bruin I had the great opportunity to watch John play, and the honor of sneaking in a listen to Coach Wooden whenever I could. As Coach inspired me, and unbeknownst to him gave me a path to follow for my life, I never thought that in my post UCLA days I would ever hear a more eloquent, wise, and thoughtful intellect. I was wrong. John Vallely is a living breathing testimonial on actually living the \u2018Pyramid of Success\u2019. During times of incredible adversity and heartbreak, he and his family have emerged through it all with unbelievable courage and faith, and he gives all who he comes in contact with, that same magnificent gift of hope through purpose. Although his modesty would probably not permit him from believing this, John Vallely to me stands at the apex of The Pyramid of Success, because he truly encompasses the ideal of being the best that he is capable of becoming. Thank you for being a true inspiration. P.S. Thanks to your son Eric who epitomizes your personal success, and is a realization of God\u2019s greatest gift to all of us who are blessed to be fathers.\u201d Gary Barragan Director of Administration/HR \"I've had the pleasure of meeting many great UCLA student-athletes. I have found them to also be great people, many of whom display with abundance such qualities as competitive fire, sportsmanship, heart, inspiration, leadership, and social conscience. Some of them combine all such attributes and employ them in unique and substantive ways. Indeed, the ones that do are the truly special individuals who not only make you proud to watch them, but to know them. These are the superstars who use their athletic achievements as not only building blocks, but as stepping stones to life's grander assignments. John Vallely is one such person, a man who knows how to win in life...the right way. You'll not only enjoy, but be entertained and empowered by his words and message. I am every time\". Dan Guerrero Director of Athletics\n\nUCLA\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this letter is to recommend John Vallely as an excellent public speaker. As a former teammate, I have heard him on a number of occasions, including most recently at his induction into the UCLA Hall of Fame Induction ceremony in October of 2006. He has a good message and story to tell of his own life experiences that tie into his many accomplishments in life. He has experienced many highs athletically and in his personal life, many lows. During his speech at the Hall of Fame Induction one could hear a pin drop to the floor as he covered some of the difficult parts of his life\u2019s journey.\n\n\n\nWhen one has reached the pinnacle of accomplishments athletically in basketball and beach volleyball and seen the lows in life, it is a truly compelling story. He conveys this concisely and articulately in a straightforward manner without needless whining or complaining. It is indeed inspiring to hear\". Lynn Shackelford \u201cI was uplifted by the humble message and giant heart of an athlete who has walked the walk of cancer that stole the life of his precious young daughter, Erin; yet later spared his own.\n\n\n\nI am grateful and forever changed as I journeyed in spirit with the dynamic John Vallely. The depth of his experience and good humor enlightens the struggles, doubt, loss, restored hope, triumphs, and convictions that he and we all may face as we each seek to make sense of life.\n\n\n\nJohn made me cry, he made me laugh, and he touched my soul. Give yourself the warming gift of his message--it's awesome--it will renew you!\u201d Deedreea Rich, DDS Newport Beach, California \u201cJohn's speech at his induction into the UCLA Hall of Fame was one of the most inspirational I have ever heard. It's obvious that John's passion for life and his belief in the \"Pyramid of Success\" has served him well from the glory days at UCLA to the unimaginable pain of losing a child to cancer. He tells his life story with heartfelt candor and wit, including examples of how the many facets of the \"Pyramid\" shape his daily life. I feel honored to have John as a friend, and thank him for one of the most entertaining evenings I have ever experienced.\u201d Dee DeVaney Retired Airline Pilot\n\n\u201cJohn's story moves his listeners to both tears and laughter, and his ability to weave his life's message around John Wooden's Pyramid of Success is masterful. From the pinnacles of athletic success, to the depths of despair over the death of his beautiful 12 year old daughter, to his own two life-and-death struggles with lymphoma, his faith has been shaken, renewed, and then solidified. John's commitment to useing the Pyramid of Success to face and overcome life's adversites is truly inspirational.\u201d Bob Kendall, Self-employed Mathematics Tutor Karen Kendall, School Administrator \u201cNever have I been so proud. You were on fire last night.That was the greatest moment in the history not only of UCLA Basketball but in the history of Western civilization. You have changed my life. You are an unbelievable humanitarian. I want to thank you for everything, John. You are up there with Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu, Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, and John Vallely. The list is endless. Oh my gosh! What a performance! Forget the jump shot, forget the rebounds, forget the defense, forget the leadership, what you did last night was the greatest thing that any man has ever done in this world as we know it. Intergalactic transmission is the next order of the day. Please, Lets get it going. I have never been so proud. I have been 6ft 11 since I was 19 yrs old; today I have broken the 7 ft. barrier. I have reached nirvana because of you. We are so happy for you. We could not have been more honored to have been in that room last night when the future of all worlds known and unknown were changed irreversibly for the better thanks to one John Vallely. Oh, what a speech!\u201d Bill Walton Class of 1974 \u201cWhen you were speaking at the UCLA Induction Dinner,I was taking notes.\u201d Rafer Johnson Olympic Gold Medalist\n\n\u201cJohn Vallely captivated our audience and his genuine warmth and caring came through in all his words. John wove the concept of team building and relationships into everything he said and presented a talk that was interesting and motivational at the same time. Best of all, he did his homework about the group he was speaking to and included specific references about them in his talk. This personalized presentation was impressive. We have already asked him to return for two more events.\u201d Volunteer Endowment for Patient Support MD Anderson \u201cAs the speaker chairman for the Breakfast Club of Newport Beach, I can confidently say that John's presentation deeply touched everyone in our group on many levels. In telling his life's story, his ability to blend his humility, strength and humor was powerful. What our group especially appreciated was the way John wove the principles of the great John Wooden into his own life in a such an honest manner that any one could relate, even a die-hard Trojan like myself. He is truly a terrific communicator of John Wooden's principles and of his own hard won wisdom.\u201d Bob Bernatz, Ph.D. President \u2013 InsightGlobal \u201cI am grateful that John Vallely participated as one of the Distinguished Speaker\u2019s for the Volcom University. His willingness to speak to our employees and share how we may achieve competitive greatness through \u201cThe Pyramid of Success\u201d was both humbling and a learning experience. I appreciated his intimate stories and personal life experiences, proving how successful this tool has been in his life. I truly believe that everyone who attended felt inspired and learned some tips on how they could individually reach competitive greatness at work and in their personal lives. What a terrific and moving message and I would recommend anyone who wants to be motivated to listen to John speak.\u201d Tara Bennett Sr. Director of the People\u2019s Department\n\nVolcom, Inc."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/15104532/john-wooden-1972-ucla-bruins-top-list-ncaa-champions", "page_content": "If you want to start an argument, try ranking teams that by definition are all distinguished by excellence. These are all national champions, after all, so the \"worst\" team here was better than any opponent it faced in its NCAA tournament.\n\nNevertheless, here we are. You'll notice right away that the 1960s and 1970s show up well on this list, and that's not by accident.\n\nThat era marked the point when two important procedural lines intersected. On the one hand, identifying the best talent coming out of high school had become a routine and relatively efficient process by the middle of the 20th century. On the other hand, the rules at that time still required those talented players (for the most part) to stay in school until they had completed their senior years.\n\nThe reason that decades from long ago show up so well here is not because men were giants back in those days. Instead, it's that the system by which the game was played was much different. If you imagine Nerlens Noel, Ben McLemore, Shabazz Muhammad, Andrew Wiggins, Jabari Parker, Joel Embiid, Aaron Gordon, Nik Stauskas, Zach LaVine, Karl-Anthony Towns, D'Angelo Russell, Jahlil Okafor, Stanley Johnson, Justise Winslow, Myles Turner, Trey Lyles, Devin Booker and Kelly Oubre all still playing for their respective college teams, you'll have some sense of the strength of the teams from yesteryear.\n\n1. UCLA Bruins, 1972 (30-0)\n\nThe average -- repeat, average -- final score of a UCLA game in 1971-72 was 95-64. The Bruins finished the season 30-0, having played only two games that were decided by single digits (one being UCLA's 81-76 victory over Florida State in the national championship game). Bill Walton made his collegiate debut and averaged a 21-point, 16-rebound double-double for the season, and Henry Bibby joined him on the consensus All-American first team. Curiously, in this pre-shot-clock era, only one opponent chose to take the air out of the ball. Notre Dame hosted the Bruins in January, and Digger Phelps' team attempted only one shot in the first 10 minutes of the second half. The Irish lost, 57-32.\n\n2. Indiana Hoosiers, 1976 (32-0)\n\nBob Knight's Hoosiers announced their intentions at the outset in 1975-76 with an easy 20-point win over No. 2-ranked UCLA in a made-for-TV season opener played in St. Louis. The Hoosiers were tested in two overtime games (against Kentucky at Freedom Hall in Louisville, and at home against Michigan), and they also had to prevail in nine additional single-digit contests over the course of the season. Nevertheless, Indiana seemed to gather strength as the season progressed: Knight's team won its NCAA tournament games by an average of 13 points. The Hoosiers were the product of Knight's manifest coaching prowess and elite (though often underrated in subsequent years) talent: Kent Benson, Scott May, Quinn Buckner and Bob Wilkerson were all selected at No. 11 or higher in the two ensuing NBA drafts.\n\n3. UCLA Bruins, 1973 (30-0)\n\nWalton cemented his status as one of the greatest college players of all time with 44 points on 21-of-22 shooting in the national championship game against Memphis State. UCLA's average margin of victory that season was 22 points, and no NCAA tournament opponent was able to come within 10 points of John Wooden's team.\n\n4. San Francisco Dons, 1956 (29-0)\n\nIncredibly USF rolled through that year's bracket with ease despite the fact that coach Phil Woolpert's second-best player, K.C. Jones, had been ruled ineligible for the tournament by the NCAA. Led by Bill Russell, the Dons were the first team in the NCAA tournament era to finish its season undefeated.\n\n5. UCLA Bruins, 1968 (29-1)\n\nArguably the greatest team in NCAA history that didn't go undefeated, the Bruins lost the \"Game of the Century\" in January to Elvin Hayes and Houston 71-69 before a crowd of 52,000 at the Astrodome. That blemish was avenged by Lew Alcindor and his teammates when UCLA defeated the Cougars 101-69 in the Final Four. Dunking was banned across college basketball in 1967-68 as a direct response (more or less) to Alcindor's dominance. The prohibition wasn't lifted until 1976-77.\n\n6. UCLA Bruins, 1967 (30-0)\n\nAlcindor made his collegiate debut and averaged 29 points and 16 rebounds. The Bruins were seriously challenged only twice in the course of recording a perfect season, and both games were played on the road. In February, archrival USC held on to the ball and took the contest to overtime before losing 40-35. Two weeks later, Oregon employed the same strategy but fell short, 34-25.\n\n7. UTEP Miners (Texas Western), 1966 (28-1)\n\nThe school then known as Texas Western made history in more ways than one. For the first time, a team with five black starters won the national title, a feat Don Haskins' Miners achieved by defeating an all-white Kentucky team 72-65 at Cole Field House, in College Park, Maryland. Bobby Joe Hill and Willie Worsley led Western to victory over Pat Riley and the Wildcats. Another starter on that Miners team was David Lattin, grandfather of current Oklahoma starter Khadeem Lattin.\n\n8. North Carolina Tar Heels, 1957 (32-0)\n\nFamed for winning what's reputed to be the greatest NCAA title game of them all, North Carolina became only the second team to go undefeated in the tournament era and win the national championship. In the title game, Frank McGuire's Tar Heels won 54-53 in triple-overtime over Wilt Chamberlain and Kansas. Carolina prevailed despite leading scorer Lennie Rosenbluth fouling out with 1 minute, 45 seconds left in regulation.\n\n9. North Carolina Tar Heels, 1982 (32-2)\n\nDean Smith won his first national title with a roster that boasted 12 future NBA draft picks, including Michael Jordan, James Worthy and Sam Perkins. Yet even with all that talent, the Tar Heels had to be clutch to win the title. Carolina won its first five tournament games by two, five, 10 and five points, respectively, leading up to Jordan's winner in UNC's 63-62 victory over Patrick Ewing and Georgetown. Earlier that March, a nationally televised but unsightly 47-45 win over Ralph Sampson and Virginia in the ACC tournament title game helped persuade college basketball to at last adopt the shot clock.\n\n10. NC State Wolfpack, 1974 (30-1)\n\nDavid Thompson, Tom Burleson, Monte Towe and the Wolfpack did what no team had been able to do for eight years: Norm Sloan's men beat Wooden and UCLA in double-overtime 80-77 in the national semifinal before triumphing over Marquette in the title game. Remarkably the 6-foot-4 Thompson averaged 26 points and shot 55 percent from the field (all 2s, of course) as a junior despite playing in an era when dunks were prohibited.\n\n11. UCLA Bruins, 1969 (29-1)\n\nOne day after being taken to double-overtime by USC at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, the Bruins lost to the Trojans 46-44 at Pauley Pavilion. It proved to be UCLA's only loss of the season, and Alcindor & Co. defeated Purdue, their coach's alma mater, in the NCAA title game 92-72.\n\n12. San Francisco Dons, 1955 (28-1)\n\nBehind Russell and Jones, the Dons became the first team on the West Coast to win a title since Stanford in 1942, a fact that was not lost on coach Phil Woolpert. After watching Jones hold La Salle's Tom Gola to only seven second-half points in the title game, the USF coach said his star had done \"things they have never seen in the middle west.\"\n\n13. Kentucky Wildcats, 1996 (34-2)\n\nThey were called The Untouchables: Tony Delk, Antoine Walker & Co. dropped neutral-site games to John Calipari's UMass squad and to Mississippi State in the SEC tournament title game. Nevertheless Rick Pitino's Wildcats breezed through that year's NCAA bracket, winning six games by an average of 21 points. UK won its rematch against Marcus Camby and the Minutemen in the Final Four, and then defeated John Wallace and Syracuse to win the title.\n\n14. Cincinnati Bearcats, 1962 (29-2)\n\nWith Paul Hogue, Tom Thacker and Tony Yates returning as starters from a defending national champion, expectations were high for Ed Jucker's team. A two-point win over Wooden and UCLA in the Final Four set up a second consecutive meeting in the title game against John Havlicek and Ohio State. The Bearcats won 71-59, heightening a bitter rivalry that had already seen Jucker being briefly detained by Columbus police when he arrived in town to scout the Buckeyes.\n\n15. Duke Blue Devils, 1992 (34-2)\n\nMike Krzyzewski did something no coach since Wooden had done: win back-to-back titles. Propelled by Christian Laettner's iconic buzzer-beater in the Elite Eight against Kentucky, the Blue Devils then survived an 81-78 nail-biter against Knight and Indiana before beating Michigan's Fab Five 71-51 in the final.\n\n16. Kentucky Wildcats, 2012 (38-2)\n\nOnly a miracle shot by Indiana's Christian Watford and a desultory showing by the Wildcats in the SEC tournament title game against Vanderbilt prevented John Calipari's group from becoming the first team in 36 years to go undefeated. In its six-game march through the bracket, UK won every contest by eight points or more. Anthony Davis, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Terrence Jones and Marquis Teague were all first-round picks in the ensuing NBA draft.\n\n17. UCLA Bruins, 1971 (29-1)\n\nNo Alcindor, no Walton, no problem. UCLA lost at Notre Dame in January, but the ensuing win against UC Santa Barbara was the first in what became an 88-game win streak spanning four seasons. (A streak that was also ended by Phelps' Fighting Irish in South Bend.) Both Sidney Wicks and Curtis Rowe were selected first-team All-Americans.\n\n18. UCLA Bruins, 1964 (30-0)\n\nAs the first of what would become 10 national championship teams under Wooden, the 1963-64 Bruins defeated Duke 98-83 in the title game. Wooden always credited assistant coach Jerry Norman (albeit not vocally enough for Norman's tastes) for conceiving the zone press that Gail Goodrich, Walt Hazzard, Keith Erickson and the rest of the team used to such devastating effect.\n\n19. UCLA Bruins, 1970 (28-2)\n\nWicks, Bibby, Rowe and John Vallely all averaged 15 points or more in an era of fast-paced hoops that saw Wooden's team face its toughest challenges in Pac-8 play. Conversely, once the Bruins reached the NCAA tournament they won every game by 11 points or more, including an 80-69 victory in the final over Jacksonville. UCLA averaged 92 points.\n\n20. Kentucky Wildcats, 1978 (30-2)\n\nJack Givens recorded possibly the finest title-game performance of any player not named Bill Walton, scoring 41 points on 18-of-27 (pre-3-point shot) shooting to give the Wildcats a 94-88 win over Duke. Joe B. Hall's balanced rotation also featured Rick Robey, Kyle Macy, James Lee and Mike Phillips.\n\n21. Connecticut Huskies, 1999 (34-2)\n\nThe winner of the 1999 national championship game was fated to be highly ranked on this list. That team was UConn, which prevailed against Elton Brand, Trajan Langdon and favored Duke 77-74 in a final for the ages. Richard Hamilton won most outstanding player honors for the Huskies, as he, Khalid El-Amin and Jake Voskuhl secured a first national title for Jim Calhoun.\n\n22. Ohio State Buckeyes, 1960 (25-3)\n\nIn what still stands as one of the most dominant runs through the bracket in the event's history, Fred Taylor's Buckeyes won their tournament games by an average of more than 19 points. With two future Basketball Hall of Fame inductees on the roster in Havlicek and Jerry Lucas, Taylor had more than enough talent to defeat Cal 75-55 in the title game.\n\n23. UCLA Bruins, 1965 (28-2)\n\nThe defending national champions lost their season opener to Illinois, but went 28-1 the rest of the way. Erickson and Goodrich returned from the team that had won the title the previous season, and led a fast-paced Bruins attack that averaged 100 points per 40 minutes over the tournament's first four games. In the final, Wooden's men defeated Cazzie Russell and Michigan 91-80.\n\n24. Duke Blue Devils, 2001 (35-4)\n\nCoach K's team closed the regular season by winning at North Carolina and avenging an earlier loss to the Tar Heels at Cameron Indoor Stadium. It was the first of what would be 10 consecutive wins to close the season for Shane Battier, Carlos Boozer and Jay Williams. Krzyzewski won his third title when Duke defeated Richard Jefferson and Arizona 82-72 in the championship game.\n\n25. Arkansas Razorbacks, 1994 (31-3)\n\nNolan Richardson called his style \"40 minutes of hell,\" and for opponents the Razorbacks' pressing defense was aptly named. Corliss Williamson shot 63 percent on his 2s and led an Arkansas attack that turned back the likes of Georgetown, Michigan and Arizona all by eight points or more before defeating Grant Hill and Duke 76-72 in the final. Bill Clinton cheered on his home-state team from the stands in Charlotte, North Carolina, marking the first time a sitting president attended a Final Four.\n\n26. Georgetown Hoyas, 1984 (34-3)\n\nJohn Thompson II's run to a championship was very nearly thwarted in the Hoyas' first tournament game. In an era that predated the shot clock, underdog SMU chose to hold on to the ball before falling to Georgetown 37-36. Thompson's men won the title 84-75 over Hakeem Olajuwon and Houston. Ewing averaged 16 points on 66 percent shooting from the field.\n\n27. Kansas Jayhawks, 2008 (37-3)\n\nThis is possibly the best 21st century team never to have been ranked No. 1 in its championship season. Mario Chalmers, Darrell Arthur, Brandon Rush, Sherron Collins and the Jayhawks dropped road games at Kansas State, Texas and Oklahoma State and fell to as low as No. 7 in that year's AP poll. But Bill Self's team showed its true colors in the NCAA tournament, blowing out North Carolina (that season's perennial No. 1) in the national semifinal, and then winning the title with a thrilling overtime victory against Memphis.\n\n28. North Carolina Tar Heels, 1993 (34-4)\n\nDean Smith's Tar Heels won their games in 1992-93 by an average of nearly 18 points, as Eric Montross, George Lynch and Donald Williams all scored 14 points or better per game. UNC clinched the 77-71 win over Michigan in the championship game when Chris Webber called a timeout his team did not have.\n\n29. Louisville Cardinals, 1980 (33-3)\n\nDenny Crum's Cardinals barely survived their first NCAA tournament game, edging Kansas State 71-69. No opponent came that close again, however, as Darrell Griffith, Derek Smith and Wiley Brown led Louisville to a 59-54 win in the title game over surprising No. 8 seed UCLA.\n\n30. North Carolina Tar Heels, 2009 (34-4)\n\nThe Tyler Hansbrough-era Tar Heels that had achieved No. 1 rankings in three consecutive regular seasons closed the deal and won it all. Ty Lawson was named ACC player of the year, and UNC marched through the bracket with no opponent coming closer than 12 points. In the final, Carolina raced out to a 55-34 halftime lead against Michigan State and cruised to an 89-72 victory.\n\n31. Florida Gators, 2007 (35-5)\n\nWith all five starters returning from a national championship team, big things were expected of Billy Donovan's Gators. Big things had to wait: Florida lost two of its first nine games, reeled off 17 wins in a row and then, rather remarkably, recorded a 1-3 stretch in late February. Maybe Corey Brewer, Al Horford and Joakim Noah just needed to make things interesting. Florida turned back Greg Oden, Mike Conley and Ohio State in the title game to win what will remain until at least 2017 the sport's last back-to-back titles.\n\n32. North Carolina Tar Heels, 2005 (33-4)\n\nRoy Williams inherited Rashad McCants, Raymond Felton and Sean May from former UNC coach Matt Doherty, and the former Kansas coach put that talent to good use. After a season-opening loss to Santa Clara, the Tar Heels went 33-3 the rest of the way, including a 75-70 win over Deron Williams, Dee Brown and Illinois in the title game.\n\n33. Indiana Hoosiers, 1987 (30-4)\n\nIn the first year of the 3-point shot, Bob Knight adopted the new weapon with surprising alacrity. Steve Alford made 53 percent of his tries from beyond the arc, and his 7-of-10 shooting on 3s in the title game against Syracuse put teammate Keith Smart in position to hit the winner in the Hoosiers' 74-73 victory. IU reached that point by winning a series of games in the 40th minute, prevailing against Duke, LSU and UNLV by six, one and four points, respectively.\n\n34. UCLA Bruins, 1975 (28-3)\n\nThis was Wooden's final national championship team, and without a doubt his most \"clutch\" group. The Bruins reached the title game after a run that included a three-point win over Montana and a one-point overtime victory against Louisville. When Wooden walked off the floor of the San Diego Sports Arena on March 31, 1975, following UCLA's 92-85 win over Kentucky, the sport said goodbye to a legend.\n\n35. Loyola Ramblers, 1963 (29-2)\n\nIn the last overtime title game until Michigan defeated Seton Hall 26 years later, the Ramblers won the championship 60-58 over two-time defending champion Cincinnati when Vic Rouse tipped in a Les Hunter miss as time expired. George Ireland's team was nicknamed the Iron Men, after NCAA eligibility rulings on two of his players forced the coach to play his five starters virtually without substitution.\n\n36. Maryland Terrapins, 2002 (32-4)\n\nWith a lineup featuring Juan Dixon, Lonny Baxter and Chris Wilcox, the Terrapins averaged 85 points and went 15-1 in the ACC before falling to NC State in the conference tournament. Whether that was the wake-up call Gary Williams' team needed, Maryland won every NCAA tournament game by eight points or more. In the final, the Terps turned back a surprising Indiana team led by Jared Jeffries and coached by Mike Davis.\n\n37. California Golden Bears, 1959 (25-4)\n\nIf you believe defense wins championships, this is the team for you. Coach Pete Newell's Bears limited opponents to only 51 points per game, and the coach's philosophy had a profound and lasting impact on a young student of the game named Bob Knight. In a Final Four renowned for featuring both Oscar Robertson and Jerry West, it was a relatively unknown Cal team that won the title by defeating West Virginia 71-70. Darrall Imhoff tipped in the winner for the Bears with 17 seconds remaining.\n\n38. Duke Blue Devils, 2015 (35-4)\n\nIt was supposed to be Kentucky's year, and indeed the Wildcats sat atop the polls from the preseason all the way into April. But Wisconsin knocked off John Calipari's 38-0 team in the national semifinals, and then Jahlil Okafor, Justise Winslow, Tyus Jones and (more surprisingly) Grayson Allen proved to be too much for the Badgers in the championship game.\n\n39. UCLA Bruins, 1995 (32-1)\n\nJim Harrick's Bruins averaged better than 87 points per outing, and once Tyus Edney made his length-of-the-court dash to beat Missouri in the round of 32, nothing could stop Ed O'Bannon and UCLA. In the final, the Bruins dashed Arkansas' hopes of winning back-to-back championships, beating the Razorbacks 89-78.\n\n40. Cincinnati Bearcats, 1961 (27-3)\n\nHogue and Bob Wiesenhahn both averaged better than 16 points for a Bearcats team that dropped two games in Missouri Valley play, yet still marched to its third consecutive Final Four. In his first season as head coach in Cincinnati, Jucker won a national championship when his team defeated Ohio State in the title game 70-65.\n\n41. Louisville Cardinals, 2013 (35-5)\n\nPitino's Cardinals struggled through a February funk, losing three games in a row and subsequently dropping a five-overtime classic at Notre Dame. However that would be the last time Peyton Siva and Russ Smith would come out on the wrong end of a final score. Entering the tournament as the overall No. 1 seed, the Cardinals moved through the bracket with relative ease before surviving a scare from suddenly unstoppable Michigan guard Spike Albrecht in the national final. George Mason transfer Luke Hancock earned Final Four most outstanding player honors.\n\n42. Kentucky Wildcats, 1998 (35-4)\n\nIt took six years, but the Wildcats extracted payback for the Laettner miracle of 1992. In an Elite Eight game that Duke led comfortably in the second half, Wayne Turner proceeded to slice the Blue Devils' defense to ribbons. Steve Wojciechowski and his teammates couldn't stay in front of Turner, and Tubby Smith's team went on to defeat Rick Majerus and Utah in the title game, 78-69.\n\n43. Kentucky Wildcats, 1951 (32-2)\n\nOther than a 76-74 squeaker against Illinois in the national semifinal, Adolph Rupp's team was never seriously challenged on the road to a third national title for UK. On a Wildcats team that also included sophomore Cliff Hagan, MOP honors went to Bill Spivey.\n\n44. Syracuse Orange, 2003 (30-5)\n\nThe road to a national title for Syracuse went through the heart of the Big 12, and though it was seeded on the No. 3 line Jim Boeheim's team was up to the task. With wins over not only Manhattan and Auburn but also Oklahoma State, Oklahoma, Texas and Kansas, the Orange won it all behind the scoring of freshman Carmelo Anthony and a potentially game-saving shot-block against the Jayhawks by Hakim Warrick.\n\n45. UNLV Rebels, 1990 (35-5)\n\nThough the national championship game is remembered as the most one-sided ever, UNLV's 103-73 win over Duke was recorded by a team that had lost five times in the regular season. (Jerry Tarkanian's group also had to survive a 69-67 scare from No. 12 seed Ball State in the Sweet 16.) It was the Rebels team the following season that really looked unstoppable. Larry Johnson, Anderson Hunt, Stacey Augmon and Greg Anthony all returned and the Rebels won their first 34 games before the Blue Devils got their revenge in the Final Four, 79-77.\n\n46. Villanova Wildcats, 2016 For a third consecutive season the Wildcats won the Big East outright with a 16-2 record, but after two consecutive exits in the round of 32 Jay Wright's team faced its share of skeptics entering the 2016 bracket. Still, nothing defeats skepticism like [historically good offense] (https://johngasaway.com/2016/04/04/meet-two-historically-great-tournament-offenses/) and six straight wins. Kris Jenkins hit a pure release-buzzer-swish game-winner from 3 to give 'Nova the 77-74 win over North Carolina.\n\n47. Duke Blue Devils, 2010 (35-5)\n\nKyle Singler, Jon Scheyer and Nolan Smith didn't get much respect in 2009-10, but the Blue Devils just kept winning. With Singler and Scheyer hitting 3s, and perpetually underrated big man Brian Zoubek gobbling up offensive boards, Coach K's guys were able to overcome aberrantly poor 2-point shooting and win it all when a would-be buzzer-beater for the ages by Butler's Gordon Hayward rimmed out.\n\n48. Connecticut Huskies, 2004 (33-6)\n\nNo tournament opponent could stay with Ben Gordon and Emeka Okafor into the 40th minute but one, and that game came in the national semifinal. Facing a Duke team led by J.J. Redick and Luol Deng, the Huskies overcame Okafor's foul trouble and rallied from a late eight-point deficit to win 79-78. Jim Calhoun's men then defeated Georgia Tech 82-73 in the final to claim the program's second national championship.\n\n49. Michigan State Spartans, 1979 (26-6)\n\nIn a made-for-TV showdown that helped establish the NCAA tournament as a national rite of spring, Magic Johnson, Greg Kelser and Michigan State faced Larry Bird and undefeated Indiana State in the title game in Salt Lake City. Jud Heathcote's Spartans won 75-64, and Johnson helped redefine the sport as a 6-foot-9 point guard who averaged better than eight assists.\n\n50. Indiana Hoosiers, 1953 (23-3)\n\nThe Hoosiers' three losses came by a combined total of five points, all in true road games (at Notre Dame, Kansas State and Minnesota). Once IU was safely ensconced on neutral floors, however, coach Branch McCracken's team beat Kansas 69-68 to win the program its second national championship. In an era not thought of as high-scoring, Indiana averaged better than 80 points behind the consistent production of 6-9 center Don Schlundt.\n\n51. Kentucky Wildcats, 1949 (32-2)\n\nThe Wildcats rode both the scoring and the defense of center Alex Groza, who recorded almost twice as many points as second-leading-scorer Ralph Beard. After watching UK ring up a total of 161 points in wins over Villanova and Illinois, Oklahoma State attempted to slow things down in the title game. The result was a 46-36 victory for Rupp's team.\n\n52. Michigan State Spartans, 2000 (32-7)\n\nWhile Mateen Cleaves sat out the early part of the season because of an injury, the Spartans started 9-4. Included in that early stretch was a loss at Wright State, but once Cleaves returned to the lineup this was a different team. Though Tom Izzo's group lost in overtime at Indiana in late February, MSU closed the season with 11 straight wins where every opponent lost by nine points or more. Cleaves and fellow Flint products Morris Peterson and Charlie Bell (\"the Flintstones\") led the Spartans past Udonis Haslem and Florida 89-76 to win it all.\n\n53. Duke Blue Devils, 1991 (32-7)\n\nThough it wasn't the greatest team Coach K has ever had (particularly on defense), this was the one that won him his first national title. Laettner, Bobby Hurley, Bill McCaffery and Thomas Hill were blown out in the ACC tournament title game 96-74 by North Carolina, but the Blue Devils rallied and won a thrilling grudge match against heavily favored UNLV in the Final Four before securing the championship with a 72-65 victory over Kansas.\n\n54. Florida Gators, 2006 (33-6)\n\nGoing into the 2006 tournament all eyes were on Duke, Connecticut and a bracket that had been drawn up accordingly. But after the Blue Devils lost to LSU in the Sweet 16 and the Huskies were edged by George Mason in one of the best regional finals ever played, the path was clear for Donovan and his young Gators. Al Horford, Joakim Noah and Corey Brewer ended the Patriots' Cinderella run, and then beat UCLA 73-57 for the first of what would be back-to-back titles for coach Billy Donovan.\n\n55. La Salle Explorers, 1954 (26-4)\n\nTom Gola dominated college basketball in the mid-1950s as a 6-foot-7 athlete who could both score and rebound. His Explorers weren't statistically dominant on either end of the court, but no one found a way to beat coach Kenneth Loeffler's La Salle team when it mattered most. The Explorers would play in a second consecutive national title game the following season only to lose to Bill Russell and San Francisco.\n\n56. Kansas Jayhawks, 1952 (28-3)\n\nAfter a close four-point win over TCU in their first NCAA tournament game, the Jayhawks were never seriously threatened on their way to the program's first national championship. At 6-foot-9, Clyde Lovellette averaged 28 points a game and shot 74 percent at the line for coach Phog Allen. In KU's 80-63 win over St. John's in the final, Lovellette recorded a 33-point, 17-rebound double-double.\n\n57. Kentucky Wildcats, 1958 (23-6)\n\nLed by Vernon Hatton and Johnny Cox and dubbed the \"Fiddlin' Five\" for reasons that apparently satisfied Rupp (\"We've got fiddlers, that's all. ... We don't have any violinists.\"), UK beat Elgin Baylor and Seattle 84-72 to bring a fourth championship back to Lexington.\n\n58. Louisville Cardinals, 1986 (32-7)\n\nBilly Thompson, Milt Wagner and freshman sensation Pervis Ellison headlined a high-scoring attack for Crum that seemed to grow stronger as the season progressed. In the championship game the Cardinals eked out a 72-69 win over a Duke team led by Johnny Dawkins, Mark Alarie, David Henderson and Jay Bilas.\n\n59. Marquette Golden Eagles, 1977 (25-7)\n\nMarquette won the national championship as an independent team, unaffiliated with any conference. That unbounded spirit seemed to animate everything and everyone from the uniforms to the team's unfailingly quotable coach, Al McGuire. The uniquely attired players were also good at basketball: Butch Lee averaged 20 points, and Bo Ellis and Jerome Whitehead controlled the boards.\n\n60. Michigan Wolverines, 1989 (30-7)\n\nBo Schembechler made headlines as an athletic director in 1989 when he told basketball coach Bill Frieder not to bother showing up for the NCAA tournament after he agreed to take the job at Arizona State. (\"A Michigan man will coach Michigan.\") Interim and eventual head coach Steve Fisher then led Glen Rice, Rumeal Robinson and Sean Higgins to thrilling last-minute victories at the Final Four over Illinois and, in overtime against Seton Hall, giving Michigan its only national title.\n\n61. Indiana Hoosiers, 1981 (26-9)\n\nRemembered as the team that Isiah Thomas took to a championship, the Hoosiers struggled early and greeted New Year's Day with a 7-5 record. But Knight's emphasis on defense began to pay dividends in conference play, and though IU was a No. 3 seed, Thomas, Ray Tolbert & Co. ended up marching through the bracket without once playing a contest decided by single digits.\n\n62. Arizona Wildcats 1997 (25-9)\n\nStill the only team to defeat three No. 1 seeds in a single NCAA tournament, Lute Olson's Wildcats started their historic run by upsetting top overall seed Kansas 85-82 in the Sweet 16. After defeating fellow Cinderella Providence, Arizona prevailed against North Carolina and won a showdown against a Kentucky team shooting for a second consecutive national title. Instead Michael Dickerson, Mike Bibby and Miles Simon beat the other Wildcats 84-79.\n\n63. Connecticut Huskies, 2011 (32-9)\n\nUConn's 9-9 finish in the Big East was so uninspiring the Huskies were bracketed in the Big East tournament's first-round daytime game against DePaul. The opening tip of that sparsely attended contest, however, marked the beginning of a stunning 11-0 run by Calhoun's team. For much of that run, Kemba Walker and Jeremy Lamb were unstoppable on offense. Then, when the Huskies reached the Final Four, a switch was flipped and the UConn defense held Kentucky and Butler to only 96 combined points over the course of two games.\n\n64. Connecticut Huskies, 2014 (32-8)\n\nShades of 2011: Shabazz Napier took the role of Walker and led the No. 7 seed Huskies on a run to the championship. Kevin Ollie's team needed overtime to escape Saint Joseph's in the round of 64, but from that point forward no opponent came closer to UConn than six points on the scoreboard. That included a win against overall No. 1 seed Florida in the national semifinal, as well as a title-game victory over Kentucky and game-winning-shot specialist Aaron Harrison.\n\n65. Kansas Jayhawks, 1988 (27-11)\n\nLarry Brown's team entered the tournament as a No. 6 seed after a third-place finish in the Big Eight. Yet even during an up and down regular season Danny Manning averaged 24 points, and once the Jayhawks survived a close game against Murray State in the round of 32 it was clear sailing all the way to the finals. That's where Stacey King, Mookie Blaylock and Oklahoma were waiting, but KU emerged victorious thanks to a 31-point, 18-rebound double-double from Manning.\n\n66. NC State Wolfpack, 1983 (26-10)\n\nEveryone remembers the last seconds of the last game, but what Jim Valvano did just to get his team that far was incredible enough. NC State probably wouldn't have received a bid if it hadn't won the ACC tournament, and in the NCAA tournament Valvano's men advanced by margins of two, one, 19, one and seven points, respectively. Facing overwhelming favorite Houston and its Phi Slama Jama lineup of Olajuwon, Clyde Drexler and Michael Young, Valvano slowed the game down all the way to the 40th minute. That's when NC State's Dereck Whittenburg airballed a 30-footer that Lorenzo Charles was able to catch and dunk. Never give up.\n\n67. Villanova Wildcats, 1985 (25-10)\n\nRollie Massimino's veteran core of Ed Pinckney, Dwayne McClain and Harold Pressley was the afterthought at a Final Four that featured fellow Big East members Georgetown and St. John's. But the Wildcats extended their thrilling run of close-game mastery and defeated Ewing and the Hoyas 66-64. In winning six tournament games, Villanova held opponents to an average of 50 points.\n\n68. Oklahoma State Cowboys (Oklahoma A&M Aggies), 1946 (31-2)\n\nThe team then known as Oklahoma A&M featured Bob Kurland, reputed to be the first true 7-footer in college basketball history. With Kurland on the floor and Hank Iba calling the plays, the Aggies went undefeated in Missouri Valley play, breezed to the title game and won a tense 43-40 contest over North Carolina. The semifinals and finals in New York City that year marked the first time that four teams met at a neutral site to determine a national champion.\n\n69. Kentucky Wildcats, 1948 (36-3)\n\nAs he would be again in 1949, Groza was UK's leading scorer in the paint. But in winning the first of what would be back-to-back titles he had help on offense from guard Ralph Beard. The Wildcats won by comfortable margins against Columbia, Holy Cross and Baylor to claim the program's first national championship.\n\n70. Wyoming Cowboys, 1943 (31-2)\n\nAfter beating Georgetown 46-34 to win the NCAA title, Ken Sailors, Milo Komenich and the Cowboys faced NIT champions St. John's in a benefit game with the proceeds going to support the Red Cross. Though Wyoming was effectively the visiting team playing at Madison Square Garden, coach Everett Shelton's team won the mythical national-national championship with a 52-47 victory.\n\n71. Holy Cross Crusaders, 1947 (27-3)\n\nGeorge Kaftan was named the tournament MOP, but any team with Bob Cousy in the backcourt confronted opponents with a taller task than stopping only one player. Coach Alvin \"Doggie\" Julian's team won its championship by defeating Navy, CCNY and Oklahoma.\n\n72. Indiana Hoosiers, 1940 (20-3)\n\nIn later years and indeed until the 1970s, a team would have to win its conference to play in the NCAA tournament. But in 1940 these procedures were still being worked out, and the Hoosiers received a bid after finishing in second in the Big Ten. McCracken's team made the most of the opportunity and won the title behind Marv Huffman's MOP heroics.\n\n73. Wisconsin Badgers, 1941 (20-3)\n\nGene Englund was the consensus first-team All-American, but most outstanding player honors went to John Kotz as coach Bud Foster's Badgers defeated Washington State 39-34 to capture the NCAA tournament's third championship.\n\n74. Oklahoma State Cowboys (Oklahoma A&M Aggies), 1945 (27-4)\n\nIba's team won the first of what would be two consecutive championships when Kurland scored 22 points in the Aggies' 49-45 victory over NYU. Cecil Hankins had 15 points for A&M in the championship game.\n\n75. Stanford Cardinal, 1942 (28-4)\n\nHowie Dallmar won MOP honors for coach Everett Dean's team, as the Cardinal defeated Dartmouth 53-38 to win the title.\n\n76. Oregon Ducks, 1939 (29-5)\n\nThe \"Tall Firs\" bounced back from a 19-point loss at Oregon State to end the season with eight straight wins. Howard Hobson's Ducks beat Texas, Oklahoma and Ohio State to win the first NCAA tournament, as John Dick scored 15 points against a Buckeyes defense focused on Slim Wintermute and Lauren \"Laddie\" Gale.\n\n77. CCNY Beavers, 1950 (24-5)\n\nThe only team to win NCAA and NIT titles in the same season, CCNY beat Bradley 71-68 for its NCAA championship. Irwin Dambrot won most outstanding player honors, and coach Nat Holman would make an appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show,\" but the following season the Beavers were embroiled in a point-shaving investigation. Ultimately the scandal enveloped not only New York-area programs like NYU, Manhattan and LIU but also Kentucky, Bradley and Toledo.\n\n78. Utah Utes, 1944 (21-4)\n\nCoach Vadal Peterson's team featured Arnie Ferrin, and the Utes received an NCAA bid only after an auto accident injured enough members of the Arkansas team to force the Razorbacks to decline their invitation."}]}
