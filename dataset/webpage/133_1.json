The Negro major leagues are kind of like a Rubik\u2019s Cube. Fun to play with, difficult to figure out. More than any other sport, baseball is a game of numbers. Except that for a long time, much Negro Leagues data was inconsistent. If it existed at all. What's more, since schedules were much shorter compared to Major League Baseball, sample sizes were smaller. The participants also moved around, often for financial considerations. Many played in different leagues in different countries throughout the year. The competition level could vary from place to place, which made any statistics moot in some cases. Because the final pitch was thrown in 1958, few with firsthand knowledge are around to share it. We don't have film highlights or even much photographic evidence. But things are evolving. In 2020, MLB recognized the Nego Leagues as major leagues. And in 2021, Baseball Reference, a trusted source for baseball stats, expanded its coverage of the Negro Leagues and integrated Negro League data from 1920 to 1948 into its record books. We still have to separate truth from hyperbole, but more analysis has become available. We always knew that some of the greatest baseball players who ever lived played in the Negro Leagues. Now it's more official. These are the best Negro League players in baseball history.\n\n25. Pete Hill, Outfield Pete Hill batting for the Leland Giants in 1909 Note: Players with brief Negro Leagues careers before they played in the major leagues were not considered. That includes Roy Campanella, Larry Doby, Luke Easter, Minnie Minoso, Don Newcombe and Jackie Robinson, to name a few. Statistics are courtesy of the Seamheads database. Incomplete data is marked by an asterisk. Career: 1904-21, 1923-25 (21 seasons) Primary teams: Habana, Chicago American Giants, Detroit Stars Career statistics/162 games: .324 batting average, 10 home runs, 95 RBI, 43* stolen bases. Baseball Hall of Fame: Inducted in 2006 Bottom line: The five-tool center fielder spent the brunt of his career in the pre-Negro Leagues days and did much to put black baseball on the map. He had a Jackie Robinson-like effect on pitchers when on the bases. Or more accurately, Jackie Robinson created havoc like Pete Hill. He was a mainstay with several legendary teams and served as a player-manager later in his career.\n\n24. Dick Lundy, Shortstop Dick Lundy could field and hit. Career: 1916-35, 1937 (21 seasons) Primary teams: Atlantic City Bacharach Giants, Almendares, Baltimore Black Sox Career statistics/162 games: .322 BA, 9 HR, 112 RBI, 23* SB Baseball Hall of Fame: Not inducted Bottom line: Generally considered to be among the three best black players at his position in league history, \"King Richard\" also was among its top long-ball hitters and gate attractions. The guy had a nose for the money \u2014 10 different teams in all \u2014 and he never stayed in one place too long.\n\n23. John Beckwith, Third Base-Shortstop John Beckwith played 18 years in the Negro Leagues. Career: 1919-37 (18 seasons) Primary teams: Chicago American Giants, Baltimore Black Sox, Homestead Grays Career statistics/162 games: .328 BA, 27 HR, 150 RBI, 13* SB Baseball Hall of Fame: Not inducted Bottom line: The 220-pound strongman could be temperamental and worse, but oh, how his 38-inch bat could abuse a baseball. Think: The original Dick Allen. John Beckwith's signature home run at Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C., struck an ad sign roughly 460 feet away from home plate and 40 feet off the ground. Yet there was more to the man than raw power. His uncommon agility allowed him to play multiple positions in his career.\n\n22. Leon Day, Pitcher Leon Day was one of the best pitchers in baseball history. Career: 1934-39, 1941-43, 1946 (10 seasons) Primary team: Newark Eagles Career statistics/162 games: 38 games, 18-8 W-L, 3.42 earned run average (pitcher); .309 BA, 5 HR, 68 RBI, 4* SB (hitter) Baseball Hall of Fame: Inducted in 1995 Bottom line: While the low-key right-hander could do it all, he didn\u2019t receive the recognition of other star pitchers in his day. In fact, his versatility was such that he played second base or center field on a semi-regular basis. His best work came on the mound, though, where he had no peer in the early 1940s decade. As teammate Monte Irvin once said, \"He was as good or better than Bob Gibson. ... If we had one game to win, we wanted Leon to pitch.\"\n\n21. Ray Brown, Pitcher Ray Brown was inducted in the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006. Career: 1931-45 (15 seasons) Primary team: Homestead Grays Career statistics/162 games: 40 G, 22-8 W-L, 2.98 ERA Baseball Hall of Fame: Inducted in 2006 Bottom line: While teammates Cool Papa Bell, Josh Gibson, Satchel Paige and got most of the pub, the Grays ace methodically went about his business. The right-hander had one of the most lethal curveballs of his time, a money pitch that he would throw to any batter at any time. His .742 win percentage (118-41) was the best in league history.\n\n20. Oliver Marcell (also Marcelle), Third Base Oliver Marcell was an excellent third baseman in his 13 seasons in the Negro Leagues. Career: 1918-30 (13 seasons) Primary teams: Atlantic City-New York Bacharach/New York Lincoln Giants Career statistics/162 games: .306 BA, 5 HR, 88 RBI, 18* SB Baseball Hall of Fame: Not inducted Bottom line: The recluse was known as \"Ghost\" because he spent so little time at the team hotel. He also had part of his nose bitten off in a brawl over a craps game. So, um, yeah, he straddled the line between fiery competitor and raving lunatic. He also could pick it. In fact, to hear many Negro League seamheads tell it, he had no peer as a defender at the hot corner.\n\n19. Bill (Willie) Foster, Pitcher Bill Foster was inducted in the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1996. Career: 1923-37 (15 seasons) Primary teams: Memphis Red Sox, Chicago American Giants Career statistics/162 games: 40 G, 18-11 W-L, 2.79 ERA Baseball Hall of Fame: Inducted in 1996 Bottom line: The stepbrother of Negro Leagues founder Rube Foster was recognized as the best left-handed pitcher in its history. His career highlight came in the 1926 season, when the American Giants ace outpitched Bullet Joe Rogan in both games of a doubleheader to decide an epic pennant race. \"Bill Foster was my star pitcher, not even barring Satchel Paige,\" Dave Malarcher, his manager for the Chicago American Giants, once said.\n\n18. Joe (Bullet) Rogan, Pitcher-Outfielder Bullet Joe Rogan could hit and pitch. Career: 1920-30, 1933-38 (17 seasons) Primary team: Kansas City Monarchs Career statistics/162 games: 38 G, 22-10 W-L, 2.72 ERA (pitcher), 340 BA, 13 HR, 101 RBI, 23* SB (hitter) Baseball Hall of Fame: Inducted in 1998 Bottom line: At all of 5-foot-7, 160-pounds, the right-hander wielded a fastball that rivaled any of his time. The part-time outfielder also could handle a bat \u2014 he ranked second in homers (15) and sixth in batting average (.369) in the 1922 Negro National League season. What designated hitter?\n\n17. Jud (Boojum) Wilson, Third Base-First Base Jud Wilson was inducted in the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006. Career: 1922-45 (24 seasons) Primary teams: Baltimore Black Sox, Homestead Grays, Philadelphia Stars Career statistics/162 games: .361 BA, 14 HR, 130 RBI, 21* SB Baseball Hall of Fame: Inducted in 2006 Bottom line: Boojum? That was the sound that his line drives made upon contact with outfield walls. In one stretch of six seasons, he hit .413 or better five times and .399 in the other. He was one of the all-time hotheads of baseball, a 5-foot-8, 195-pound inferno who attacked everything from fastballs to umpires with legendary ferocity.\n\n16. Mart\u00edn Dihigo, Outfield-Third Base-Pitcher Mart\u00edn Dihigo was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1977. Career: 1923-31, 1935-36, 1945 (12 seasons) Primary teams: Cuban Stars East, Homestead Grays, Philadelphia Hilldale Giants, New York Cubans Career statistics/162 games: .316 BA, 26 HR, 125 RBI, 20* SB (hitter); 40 G, 17-15 W-L, 3.54 ERA (pitcher) Baseball Hall of Fame: Inducted in 1977 Bottom line: Many old-time seamheads consider the Cuban icon to be a Roberto Clemente clone. Others say \"El Maestro\" was \"El Overhyped.\" As is usually the case with such a wide range of opinions, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Let\u2019s just say that not many athletes can play pitcher, first base, second base, shortstop, third base, left field, center field or right field. And do several at an All-Star level.\n\n15. Judy Johnson, Third Base Judy Johnson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1975. Career: 1918, 1921-36 (17 seasons) Primary teams: Philadelphia Hilldale Giants, Homestead Grays, Pittsburgh Crawfords Career statistics/162 games: .299 BA, 6 HR, 99 RBI, 20* SB Baseball Hall of Fame: Inducted in 1975 Bottom line: As gifted as the quiet leader was as a two-way player, his baseball smarts were no less impressive. He was a mainstay with the 1932-35 Crawfords teams that were some of the best ever. After retirement as a player, he served as the first black coach in the big leagues and went on to become an accomplished talent scout.\n\n14. James (Biz) Mackey, Catcher Biz Mackey was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006. Career: 1920-31, 1933-41, 1945-47 (24 seasons) Primary teams: Indianapolis ABCs, Philadelphia Hilldale Giants, Philadelphia Stars, Newark Eagles Career statistics/162 games: .330 BA, 10 HR, 109 RBI, 13* SB Baseball Hall of Fame: Inducted in 2006 Bottom line: So efficient was the Texan behind the plate well into his 30s, his offensive contributions were easy to overlook. Even though the converted shortstop never played in the big leagues, Biz Mackey left his mark there just the same. It was his mentorship that paved the way for Brooklyn Dodgers catcher Roy Campanella to Hall of Fame induction.\n\n13. Ray Dandridge, Third Base Ray Dandridge was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1987. Career: 1933-38, 1942, 1944 (8 seasons) Teams: Newark Dodgers-Eagles Career statistics/162 games: .323 BA, 3 HR, 96 RBI, 15* SB Baseball Hall of Fame: Inducted in 1987 Bottom line: \"Hooks\" was the best of a rather ordinary lot at the position, an accomplished contact hitter who made his name on Gold Glove-caliber defense. His Negro League career was somewhat brief, the result of a move to Mexico because of financial considerations. The 1950 American Association MVP got as far as Triple-A after the majors became integrated, but the New York Giants considered the mid-30-something to be a bit long in the tooth for a promotion.\n\n12. Crist\u00f3bal Torriente, Outfield Crist\u00f3bal Torriente was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006. Career: 1912-25, 1928 (15 seasons) Primary teams: Cuban Stars West, Almendares, Chicago American Giants Career statistics/162 games: .345 BA, 11 HR, 21 RBI, 39* SB Baseball Hall of Fame: Inducted in 2006 Bottom line: As one of the all-time enigmas, the temperamental Cuban is difficult to place in the order here. Not much is known about him, and much of what is remains sketchy at best. By many accounts, he was a franchise player who could do anything on a baseball field. We also know that his passion for the nightlife might resulted in frequent run-ins with team management and reduced his effectiveness to some extent.\n\n11. Norman (Turkey) Stearnes, Center Field Turkey Stearnes was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2000. Career: 1923-25, 1928, 1930-31, 1933-40 (14 seasons) Primary teams: Detroit Stars, Kansas City Stars, Chicago American Giants Career statistics/162 games: .342 BA, 30 HR, 161 RBI, 20* SB Baseball Hall of Fame: Inducted in 2000 Bottom line: No doubt the lefty thumper benefited from cozy Mack Park in Detroit, where its short porch and power alley in right field turned doubles and long outs into homers. Fact is, the guy was capable of the Turkey trot anywhere. Only Oscar Charleston and Josh Gibson hit more homers in league history. Stearnes was a willing base-stealer and plus center fielder as well.\n\n10. James (Cool Papa) Bell, Outfield Cool Papa Bell was inducted in the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974. Career: 1922-25, 1928-29, 1932-37, 1942-46 (17 seasons) Primary teams: St. Louis Stars, Pittsburgh Crawfords, Homestead Grays Career statistics/162 games: .320 BA, 6 HR, 76 RBI, 32* SB Baseball Hall of Fame: Inducted in 1974 Bottom line: If even half the tales about his legendary speed and quickness are accurate, then the 5-foot-9, 157-pound switch-hitter would be worth about, say, $20 million per season today. You heard that he could turn off the lights, then be in bed before the room was dark, didn\u2019t you? Cool Papa fun fact: He got his famous nickname as a 19-year-old kid from Stars manager Bill Gatewood, who was impressed by his coolness under pressure.\n\n9. Willie Wells, Shortstop Willie Wells was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1997. Career: 1924-31, 1933-39, 1941-42, 1945-48 (21 seasons) Primary teams: St. Louis Stars, Chicago American Giants, Newark Eagles Career statistics/162 games: .303 BA, 14 HR, 101 RBI, 21* SB Baseball Hall of Fame: Inducted in 1997 Bottom line: The anchor of the Eagles' so-called \"Million Dollar Infield\" wasn\u2019t just the best shortstop in the league for more than a decade. There was a time in the mid-1930s when he was the most dominant all-around player \u2014 period. What separated him from others at the position was an ability to hit for distance. As a result, he was among the first to wear a helmet at the plate, so often did frustrated pitchers throw at him.\n\n8. Monte Irvin, Outfield-Shortstop Monte Irvin had a great career in the Negro Leagues and major leagues. Career: 1938-43, 1945-48 (10 seasons) Team: Newark Eagles Career statistics/162 games: .354 BA, 22 HR, 118 RBI, 18* SB Baseball Hall of Fame: Inducted in 1973 Bottom line: Most players, team owners and executives of both colors believed that he was the most well-rounded candidate to break the color barrier. In 1949, not long after Jackie Robinson made his Brooklyn Dodgers debut, the New York Giants purchased his contract from the Eagles. Two years later, he already was a star with the National League pennant winners.\n\n7. George (Mule) Suttles, First Base-Left Field Mule Suttles was one of the game's great hitters. Career: 1923-25, 1928-30, 1932-44 (19 seasons) Primary teams: Birmingham Black Barons, Chicago American Giants, Newark Eagles Career statistics/162 games: .317 BA, 27 HR, 134 RBI, 13* SB Baseball Hall of Fame: Inducted in 2006 Bottom line: If any Negro Leaguer could have transitioned to modern times, then this 6-foot-3, 215-pound strongman was the one. The mighty righty hit for power, hit for average, hit in the clutch and wasn\u2019t afraid to swing and miss. His many moonshots were the talk of the league. Mule fun fact: He hit the first homer in East-West All-Star Game history.\n\n6. Smokey Joe Williams, Pitcher Smokey Joe Williams pitched in 279 Negro Leagues games (226 starts) and won 138 of them. Career: 1907-24, 1926-32 (25 seasons) Primary teams: New York Lincoln Giants, Homestead Grays Career statistics/162 games: 38 G, 19-12 W-L, 2.41 ERA Baseball Hall of Fame: Inducted in 1999 Bottom line: The all-time Negro Leagues winner was the Satchel Paige of the first half of Negro Leagues history, a 6-foot-4 right-hander who dominated with size, speed and savvy. The tall Texan threw harder than Bob Feller, some claimed at the time, and another Hall of Famer, Ty Cobb, believed he had 30-win potential in the big leagues. Joe Williams also ranked third in innings pitched and 15th in earned run average on the all-time list.\n\n5. Walter (Buck) Leonard, First Base Buck Leonard was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972. Career: 1933-48 (16 seasons) Primary team: Homestead Grays Career statistics/162 games: .343 BA, 26 HR, 148 RBI, 10* SB Baseball Hall of Fame: Inducted in 1972 Bottom line: Buck Leonard and Josh Gibson were to the Grays what Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig were to the New York Yankees before them. Leonard ranked third in OPS, sixth in homers and 11th in batting average in Negro Leagues history. What\u2019s more, he was nearly as good in the field, not to mention among the most respected players of his era.\n\n4. John Henry (Pop) Lloyd, Shortstop Pop Lloyd played 27 seasons in the Negro Leagues. Career: 1906-32 (27 seasons) Primary teams: Habana, New York Lincoln Giants, Chicago American Giants, Atlantic City Bacharach Giants Career statistics/162 games: .338 BA, 4 HR, 109 RBI, 33* SB Baseball Hall of Fame: Inducted in 1977 Bottom line: Only the great Honus Wagner was in Pop Lloyd's stratosphere at shortstop in his time. The 5-foot-10, 180-pound package of skill and smarts beat opponents every which way save for the long ball. At his position, Pop ranked No. 1 in hits, RBI, runs scored and stolen bases in league history.\n\n3. Oscar Charleston, Center Field-First Base Oscar Charleston was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1976. Career: 1915-41 (27 seasons) Primary teams: Indianapolis ABCs, Hilldale Club, Pittsburgh Crawfords Career statistics/162 games: .352 BA, 22 HR, 135 RBI, 46* SB Baseball Hall of Fame: Inducted in 1976 Bottom line: The social mores of Oscar Charleston's day weighed heavily on the Indianapolis native, who played angry for more than three decades. He fought with police and even Ku Klux Klansmen. And when he was on the field, he vented on opponents and umpires alike. The result was \"the Willie Mays of his day,\" as fellow great Monte Irvin called Charleston, quite possibly the best all-around player in Negro Leagues history. He finished his lengthy career among the top five in every offensive category.\n\n2. Leroy (Satchel) Paige, Pitcher Kansas City Monarchs pitching great Leroy \"Satchel\" Paige warms up at Yankee Stadium in 1942 for a Negro League game against the New York Cuban Stars. Career: 1928, 1930-37, 1941-47 (16 seasons) Primary teams: Homestead Grays, Kansas City Monarchs Career statistics/162 games: 38 G, 16-9 W-L, 2.13 ERA Baseball Hall of Fame: Inducted in 1971 Bottom line: Ol\u2019 Satch was such a master showman/philosopher/quote machine, we tend to forget the extent of his dominance on the field. By his estimation, the ageless wonder took the mound 2,500 times everywhere from Mexico to Canada and won 80 percent of them. There may or may not have been a better pitcher in his time, but it\u2019s hard to argue that he deserved to be the first Negro Leaguer to gain Hall of Fame induction. None had a greater impact on and off the field."}, {"url": "https://baseballcoachinglab.com/third-baseman/", "page_content": "Third base is known as the Hot Corner. It can be challenging to play for a number of other reasons. Third basemen often have to make very long throws to first base and will be required to throw at odd angles -- whether to second base or to first base. The position also requires players to man a bag on the infield, meaning there are plenty of opportunities for contact with an incoming runner. Specific skills are also needed for third basemen to be able to scoop balls out of the dirt and receive throws and then make quick tags. At the plate, third basemen are often counted on to be solid contributors. While they aren't always the biggest offensive weapons a team may have, they normally provide a good amount of power and pop. Batted balls often coming screaming in fast at a third baseman, who doesn't have as much time to react to these as, say, a first baseman does because he often plays much closer to the plate. But what makes a good third baseman? How can you tell if a particular player would be a good fit as a third baseman? Here are some ways.\n\n6 Traits of a Great Third Baseman\n\n1. Third Basemen Have Great Reflexes\n\nThird basemen need to have cat-like reflexes, as they say. They\u2019ll often position themselves even with the bag and sometimes even a little in front of it, depending on the game situation. This means that they won't have a lot of time to react to hard-hit groundballs or line drives hit in their direction. In fact, third basemen will often get the least amount of time to react to a ball than any other position on the field.\n\n2. Third Basemen Have Great Hand-Eye Coordination\n\nNot only do third basemen have great reflexes, but they need to have strong hand-eye coordination as well. It's the only way that they\u2019ll be able to cleanly field hard-hit ground balls and line drives. While a third baseman won't be able to field every ball hit his way with no errors in his glove, he can still get the job done by knocking the ball down with his glove or his body. Even in these situations, though, he'll need good hand-eye coordination to be able to pick up the ball with his bare hand and then throw it across the diamond to first base.\n\n3. Third Basemen Have Strong Arms\n\nThird basemen will sometimes be required to make pretty long throws across the diamond. When they play far back behind the bag -- in situations such as when a team's right-handed hitting cleanup hitter is at the plate -- they'll be very far away from first base. In other situations, a third baseman might not have to make a far throw, but he'll have to get it to first or second base in a hurry. This means he'll need to throw the ball with a lot of velocity. Both of these instances require a third baseman to have a strong arm. He needs to be able to throw the ball with accuracy and velocity so that he can nail runners out before they reach their desired bag. And the only way to do that successfully is if he has a strong arm.\n\n4. Third Basemen Are Tough\n\nA third baseman can sometimes be seen as a catcher who doesn't wear protective equipment. They have batted balls coming at them at high rates of speed, and their job is to knock them down and keep the ball in front of them. That responsibility sounds very similar to that of a catcher -- except a third baseman must do it without a chest and leg protectors, or a full face mask and helmet. Third basemen can't be afraid to get a little banged up. They must be able to handle some bumps and bruises and keep on getting up and doing their job play after play.\n\n5. Third Basemen Have Good Footwork\n\nThird basemen will move from side to side very quickly to try to reach balls that are hit to their left or their right. This will require them to shuffle their feet from side to side quickly as well, just so they can reach the balls. Once they field the ball, they must also quickly shift their feet to a throwing position to either first base or second base (most of the time). And, as mentioned before, they'll often not be facing a very natural direction to make those throws. Therefore, they'll need to have some great footwork to field, pivot, step, and throw.\n\n6. Third Basemen Have Some Pop\n\nThird basemen are often counted on to provide some offensive pop. They don't necessarily have to be the best hitter on the team, but it certainly helps if they can produce a lot of extra-base hits. Third basemen will typically bat anywhere from third through sixth in a batting order. These lineup spots are normally reserved for players who can drive the ball hard and can advance runners in front of them. The best third basemen will often hit a good amount of doubles and home runs.\n\nRoles and Responsibilities\n\nA third baseman has a wide range of roles and responsibilities. Here are a few of them:\n\n1. He Must Keep the Ball in Front of Him\n\nA third baseman's primary responsibility is to keep batted balls his way in front of him. It'll be nearly impossible for a third baseman to cleanly field every ball hit his way, especially with how hard they\u2019re often hit. It also won't be necessary for him to do so, though. One of the advantages the position has in fielding such hard-hit balls is that players will often have more time to corral the ball and throw it to first (or second) base to get a runner out. It isn't as important, then, that he fields the ball cleanly in his glove. If he's able to knock a hard-hit ball down, he'll still have plenty of time to pick it up and make a successful throw across the diamond. It's imperative, though, that he knocks the ball down and keeps it in front of him. If the ball gets by him or bounces too far to either side, a runner could easily end up taking an extra base.\n\n2. He Must Position Himself Properly\n\nA third baseman must always know the game situation and understand where he should position himself on the field as a result. All third basemen will have some help from their coaches in this regard -- especially younger third basemen -- but it's good for them to know where they should be positioned based on the situation. He needs to know whether he should be closer in toward the plate because a bunt is a possibility. He needs to know whether he should be further back behind the bag because a good hitter is at the plate. He needs to know where to position himself in potential double-play situations or stolen base attempts. By being in the proper position, a third baseman will be making it easier on himself, and give himself extra time to react. Even a half-second in this regard can make a world of difference.\n\n3. He Must Serve as a Cut-Off\n\nA third baseman will be heavily involved in cut-off throws from the outfield. On throws to second base, the third baseman needs to be prepared to serve as a back-up in case the ball is thrown off target. On throws to third base, the third baseman must help to align either the second baseman or shortstop correctly between the outfielder and the bag to shorten the distance the ball travels. Then, he must be prepared to catch a throw from that player and potentially apply a tag on a runner heading to third base. On throws to home, the third baseman will sometimes serve as the cut-off man. He\u2019ll be the primary cut-off man for balls hit to left field, and he may even serve in that role for balls hit to the center fielder, especially if it's more toward left-center field.\n\n4. He Must Make Hard Contact\n\nWhen at bat, a third baseman's primary responsibility is to make hard contact. The harder he hits the ball, the harder it\u2019ll be for the other team to field the ball cleanly. As mentioned before, a third baseman will be counted on to contribute offensively by moving runners along the diamond. He'll do this by hitting a bunch of extra-base hits, but also by hitting sacrifice flies and moving runners up with hard-hit ground balls. While he doesn't need to hit for the highest average on the team, he'll be looked at to make a big impact in the game at times. The way to do this is to hit the ball hard and make contact as often as possible.\n\n3 Tips for a Third Baseman\n\nHere are some tips for players who want to be a good third baseman:\n\n1. Get Strong\n\nThird basemen need to be strong. It takes a lot of strength to have a powerful throwing arm -- that much is obvious. But it also takes a lot of lower body strength to be able to shuffle side to side quickly and make the off-balance throws that are necessary for the position. A good regimen in the gym of weight training will help a third baseman acquire the strength he needs to play the position well.\n\n2. Work on Your Hands\n\nIf you want to be a good third baseman, you'll need to work on your hand-eye coordination and your reaction. One great way to do this is to get a tennis ball and stand near a hard wall. Throw the ball off the wall and try to catch it with your left hand. Then shift and try to catch it with your right hand. You can adjust how close you are to the wall and how hard you throw the ball to work on different reaction times. You can even have the ball bounce on the ground before it gets to you so you can work on scooping balls off the ground.\n\n3. Hit the Cages\n\nIf you want to be a good hitter, you need to spend a lot of time in the batting cages. Good hitters who can hit for power and contact are strong and have great hand-eye coordination. So, once you work on the first two steps above, you'll be ready to work on your offense. Spend as much time as you can in the cages, and work first and foremost on making consistent contact. Once you do that, then you can work on making consistently hard contact. Remember, it'll be your job as a third baseman to make an impact at the plate. You'll want to drive in runs and move runners along the diamond.\n\nConclusion"}, {"url": "https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/brownbo03.shtml", "page_content": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhen was Bobby Brown born?\n\nBobby Brown was born on October 25, 1924.\n\nWhere was Bobby Brown born?\n\nBobby Brown was born in Seattle, WA.\n\nHow tall was Bobby Brown?\n\nBobby Brown was 6-1 (185 cm) tall.\n\nHow much did Bobby Brown weigh when playing?\n\nBobby Brown weighed 180 lbs (81 kg) when playing.\n\nHow many seasons did Bobby Brown play?\n\nBobby Brown played 8 seasons.\n\nIs Bobby Brown in the Hall of Fame?\n\nBobby Brown has not been elected into the Hall of Fame.\n\nWhat position did Bobby Brown play?\n\nBobby Brown was a Third Baseman and Shortstop.\n\nHow many hits did Bobby Brown have?\n\nBobby Brown had 452 hits over his career.\n\nHow many home runs did Bobby Brown have?\n\nBobby Brown had 22 home runs over his career.\n\nWhat was Bobby Brown's average?\n\nBobby Brown had a .279 average over his career.\n\nHow many teams has Bobby Brown played for?\n\nBobby Brown played for 1 team, the New York Yankees.\n\nHow many World Series has Bobby Brown won?\n\nBobby Brown won 4 World Series.\n\nWhen did Bobby Brown retire?\n\nBobby Brown last played in 1954.\n\nWhat are Bobby Brown's nicknames?\n\nDoc is a nickname for Bobby Brown."}, {"url": "https://www.purplerow.com/2021/3/9/22296488/colorado-rockies-state-of-the-position-2021-whos-on-first-base-cron-fuentes-bird-joe", "page_content": "After the Rockies did not pick up Daniel Murphy\u2019s option at the end of the 2020 season and his subsequent retirement, it looked like that path was laid clear for Josh Fuentes to take over as the Rockies first baseman of the future after his breakout 2020 campaign. However, the Rockies signed two veteran players in mid-February in Greg Bird and C.J. Cron. They also signed veteran Connor Joe in November. All three were signed to minor league deals with invites to spring training. Now, things are a little less certain at first base.\n\nBird. Cron. Fuentes. Joe. We\u2019ve got a nice position battle going on at first this spring.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how it should be. I think that (competition) makes everyone better:\u201d https://t.co/A9ERCkNuD0 pic.twitter.com/ObneKUXrgw \u2014 Colorado Rockies (@Rockies) March 6, 2021\n\nEntering spring training, the depth chart looked like this:\n\nRockies\u2019 depth chart at first base probably sets up to start spring as:\n\n1. C.J. Cron\n\n2. Josh Fuentes\n\n3. Greg Bird\n\n4. Connor Joe \u2014 Nick Groke (@nickgroke) February 17, 2021\n\nAfter a week of spring training action, this still appears to be the order, so let\u2019s take a look at the \u201cstate of first base\u201d as if this is the Opening Day depth chart.\n\nThe starter\n\nMuch like the catcher position, the starting first baseman is a bit up in the air. As mentioned above, the current favorite to win the starting gig is most recently signed Cron. Renee Dechert wrote about the signing, \u201c[t]he 31-year-old first baseman and designated hitter appeared in 13 games with 52 plate appearances for the Detroit Tigers in 2020 before going down with a knee injury. During that time he slashed .190/.346/.548 for a wRC+ of 138 and an fWAR of 0.3. In 2019, he played 125 games for the Minnesota Twins and slashed .253/.311/.469.\u201d\n\nSo far in five spring games, Cron has hit just 1-for-13 (.077) with a .220 OPS. He has also struck out six times (46.2%), drawn a walk, and scored a run. He is not currently on the 40-man roster.\n\nThe backup\n\nIf Cron figures to be the majority starter, that means that Josh Fuentes will once again likely be relegated to a bench role. The 2018 PCL MVP slashed .306/.320/.439 with two homers and 17 RBI in his 30-game audition with the Rockies in 2020. He also posted a DRS of 8 \u2014 second highest on the team. Most notably, he finished sixth in Purple Row\u2019s 2020 Ranking the Rockies series.\n\nWith the trade of Nolan Arenado and the retirement of Daniel Murphy, this seemed to be Fuentes\u2019 big shot, but it seems as though he\u2019ll either be used at a different position (such as third base or perhaps in the outfield) or relegated to a bench bat.\n\nSo far in six spring games, Fuentes has hit 4-for-13 (.308) with an OPS of .819. He has notched two doubles and three RBI, but has struck out five times (38.5%) and has yet to draw a walk.\n\nDepth options\n\nHere is where I\u2019ll talk about Bird and Joe, neither of whom are on the 40-man roster at this moment, but either or both could make the roster, likely as a veteran bench presence.\n\nDenver-native Greg Bird, 28, was signed by the Rockies on February 11. He was drafted by the Yankees in the fifth round of the 2011 draft, but his career has been marred by injuries. He has never played a full season of major league baseball and hasn\u2019t seen major league action since 2019. In fact, 2018 was the only season he played more than 50 games. He has a career major-league slash of .211/.301/.424 in 186 games.\n\nIn six appearances this spring, Bird has hit 1-for-13 (.077) with a .277 OPS. He has the lowest number of strikeouts (4) and has drawn two walks.\n\nConnor Joe, 28, was signed by the Rockies in November. The IF/OF has bounced around a little bit in his career since being drafted 39th overall by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2014, most recently spending time with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2020. However, did not play at the major league level in 2020; his only major league experience comes from the eight games he played for the San Francisco Giants in 2019. In those eight games, he hit .067/.125/.067 in 15 at-bats and posted a DRS of 2 in the outfield. He has only played left field at the major league level.\n\nIn six spring training games, Joe has hit 2-for-8 (.250) with an OPS of 1.080. Of the candidates vying for first, he\u2019s the only one with a home run. However, if Joe factors into the Rockies\u2019 roster, I\u2019d bet he would be utilized more as a utility man, like Chris Owings, than a true first baseman.\n\nOn the farm\n\nBeyond these four, the Rockies have a plethora of corner infielders in their farm system. Perhaps the most \u201cmajor league ready\u201d prospect is Colton Welker (No. 5 PuRP). Welker was drafted as a third baseman in the fourth round of the 2016 draft but, like other Rockies prospects, has been working at the other infield positions as well. In 2019, Welker played 27 games at first for the Double-A Hartford Yard Goats and 63 at third. He will likely start his season in Triple-A, but might have a major league cameo later in the season.\n\nSo far in spring training, Welker has been on fire. In seven games, he has a slash of .385/.429/.615 with three doubles, four RBI, and one walk. However, all of his defensive reps have been at third base rather than first.\n\nThe Rockies also acquired third baseman Elehuris Montero in the Nolan Arenado trade. The 22-year-old is currently on the 40-man roster, but hasn\u2019t played above Double-A. In 2019, he hit just .188/.235/.317 in 59 Double-A games and committed seven errors. Even though his time has been completely spent at the hot corner thus far, Montero will likely start getting reps at other infield spots and won\u2019t factor into this position battle just yet. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he starts the season in Hartford.\n\nOther options that the Rockies have are recently drafted Michael Toglia (No. 4 PuRP) and Aaron Schunck (No. 6 PuRP). However, they both have a bit of a trek through the minors still due to their recent draft status (both in 2019) and the loss of the 2020 developmental season. They will likely start in High-A in 2021 and work their way up from there.\n\nIn case of disaster\n\nThe Rockies have way too many corner infield/utility options to choose from. If they run through all of them over the course of the 2021 season, that\u2019s the true disaster."}, {"url": "https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/perezjo02.shtml", "page_content": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nHow old is Joe Perez?\n\nJoe Perez is 23 years old.\n\nWhen was Joe Perez born?\n\nJoe Perez was born on August 12, 1999.\n\nWhere was Joe Perez born?\n\nJoe Perez was born in Pembroke Pines, FL.\n\nHow tall is Joe Perez?\n\nJoe Perez is 6-1 (185 cm) tall.\n\nHow much does Joe Perez weigh?\n\nJoe Perez weighs 198 lbs (89 kg).\n\nHow many seasons has Joe Perez played?\n\nJoe Perez is in his 1st season.\n\nWhen was Joe Perez drafted?\n\nJoe Perez was drafted by the Houston Astros in the 2nd round of the 2017 MLB June Amateur Draft from Archbishop McCarthy HS (Southwest Ranches, FL).\n\nWhat position does Joe Perez play?\n\nJoe Perez is a Pinch Hitter and Third Baseman.\n\nHow many hits does Joe Perez have?\n\nJoe Perez had hits over his career.\n\nHow many home runs does Joe Perez have?\n\nJoe Perez had home runs over his career.\n\nWhat is Joe Perez's average?\n\nJoe Perez had a .000 average over his career.\n\nHow many teams has Joe Perez played for?\n\nJoe Perez has played for 1 team, the Houston Astros."}, {"url": "https://twinsdaily.com/news-rumors/minnesota-twins/twins-position-analysis-third-base-urshela-arraez-miranda/", "page_content": "Twins Video\n\nProjected Starter: Gio Urshela\n\nLikely Backup: Luis Arraez\n\nDepth: Tim Beckham, Daniel Robertson\n\nProspects: Jos\u00e9 Miranda, Austin Martin\n\nTHE GOOD\n\nAlthough the inclusion of Gary S\u00e1nchez in the Josh Donaldson deal can hardly be viewed as anything more than a salary dump by New York, the late-blooming Gio Urshela is actually a fairly valuable player, with two remaining years of control and a recent track record of success.\n\nThe 2021 season doesn't qualify, as Urshela struggled to sub par offensive production (.309 wOBA), but in the two seasons prior he had slashed .310/.359/.523 while establishing himself as a high-caliber defender at third base. Urshela would've ranked fifth in fWAR among Twins position players in 2019 (3.1), and second behind Nelson Cruz in 2020 (1.6).\n\nRediscovering his game would turn Urshela into an asset for Minnesota. Who wouldn't want an .880 OPS with defense that merits Gold Glove consideration? (Urshela was a finalist at third base in 2020, but lost out to Isiah Kiner-Falefa.) But even if the 30-year-old can't bounce back, the Twins have plenty of options lined up behind him. In fact, this was likely a big driver in their desire to move on from Donaldson.\n\nFirst and foremost, there is Luis Arraez, who is probably lined up for enough action at the position that we can consider it a timeshare. He doesn't have much arm, but Arraez looked serviceable when playing at third last season (with one glaring and extremely painful exception) and some consider it his strongest defensive position. Obviously, the Twins are motivated to get his bat in the lineup as much as possible, and this is the most natural spot to do it.\n\nThe looming elephant in the room, then, is Jos\u00e9 Miranda. Fifty-two of his defensive starts in the minors last year came at third base (compared to 30 at second and 26 at first), during a breakthrough season that ended in Triple-A and left him looking ready to make an impact in the majors. Some projection systems suggest there's no reason to wait; Steamer for example has him pegged for a .280/.331/.468 line in the big leagues this year, at age 23.\n\nFinally, you've got Austin Martin. Minnesota's #1 prospect might not be pressing quite as hard as Miranda, having finished last year in Double-A, but he's clearly getting close and he'll need to find a defensive landing spot. Martin hasn't yet played third base professionally, but he played there plenty in college and it may be his most natural fit in the infield.\n\nThere are layers of contingency in place at third that help mitigate the relative uncertainty atop the depth chart.\n\nTHE BAD\n\nIt's difficult to count on Urshela after his performance last year, but one wonders how long the Twins will be compelled to stick with him, given he's a veteran owed $6.6 million this season. You don't just pull the plug on someone like that haphazardly, even though the team might be inclined if he's slumping while Arraez, Miranda, or Martin warrant playing time.\n\nOf course, we haven't seen this front office too constrained my sentimentality, and Urshela could possibly offer some value in a utility role anyway, should they opt to move him off third. He made 28 starts at shortstop down the stretch last year and was passable there (leaving one to wonder if he'll be Carlos Correa's top backup instead of Jorge Polanco). He's got some experience at second and first.\n\nBeyond Urshela on the depth chart, exciting upside must be balanced with reality. And the reality is that experience is in somewhat short supply. Arraez has made less than a third of his defensive starts in the majors at third. Miranda has played there plenty, but hasn't yet fielded an inning in the majors and was barely on the prospect radar before last year. Martin has yet to gain any professional experience at the hot corner.\n\nWhereas Donaldson was a prototypical third baseman in many ways (when healthy) the Twins lack such a prototype at present. Urshela is a significant downgrade in terms of talent and track record.\n\nThe Twins are worse now at third base than they were before the trade, at least in the short-term \u2013 even if the move necessarily clears the way for the future.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\n\nThe Twins lost a hell of a player in Donaldson, albeit an aging and undependable one. They're well equipped to move on in his absence, but the short-term picture might be a little shaky. I'd expect a pseudo-platoon of Urshela and Arraez out of the gates, with Miranda primed to take over in the near future and Martin standing ready should anything go awry.\n\nCatch Up on the Rest of Our 2022 Previews:\n\nMORE FROM TWINS DAILY\n\n\u2014 Latest Twins coverage from our writers\n\n\u2014 Recent Twins discussion in our forums\n\n\u2014 Follow Twins Daily via Twitter, Facebook or email\n\n\u2014 Become a Twins Daily caretaker"}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/25459266/is-third-base-passing-first-base-baseball-power-position", "page_content": "Royals utilityman Whit Merrifield was the closest the AL came to having a first baseman receive any MVP consideration last season. Ed Zurga/Getty Images\n\nHere's a trivia question you can bring to your cool holiday parties, where the appetite for baseball trivia is no doubt out of control: Which American League first baseman finished highest in MVP voting this year?\n\nIt's a trick question, of course. No player who played primarily first base was named on a single ballot. Of the 18 hitters who got AL MVP votes, only one spent any time at first: Whit Merrifield, a speedy utility player who played all of 44 innings at the cold corner for Kansas City. That's less time than he spent at second base, center field, right field or designated hitter. But the answer is, somehow, Whit Merrifield. Grab me another drink?\n\nMeanwhile, the top of the ballot was filled with AL third basemen of varied skill sets: Matt Chapman, Alex Bregman and Jose Ramirez all finished in the top seven. The National League had first basemen in contention, but even Freddie Freeman and Paul Goldschmidt finished behind Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado and Cubs sometimes-third baseman Javier Baez.\n\nThese are just anecdotes, names to make the top of this article pop. But the stats suggest something less anecdotal, and perhaps more permanent. An interesting thing might be happening at the corners.\n\nFor as long as baseball has been played, defensive position has been offensive destiny. The harder the position, the fewer living human beings who can play it. The smaller that pool of humans, the lower the chance that there will be a bunch of elite hitters among them. And the less important the position, the more a team is willing to live with bad defense in pursuit of more offense.\n\nHere's a messy chart showing offense (as measured by OPS+) by position by year, going back to 1925:\n\nESPN\n\nMessy as it is, you can tell that those nine lines run mostly alongside each other, rather than crisscrossing with each other. Right fielders always outhit center fielders. DHs always outhit catchers. Left fielders always outhit shortstops. Defensive position is offensive destiny.\n\nVery, very occasionally, though, baseball will start to realign itself, and if you unmess that chart, you can see those moments. In the late 1960s, for instance, baseball changed what it thought of the middle infield. Second base and shortstop had long been offensive equals, but teams discovered second base (with fewer plays and a shorter throw than shortstop) was a position where they could stash a bigger, slower, but better-hitting human:\n\nESPN\n\nAnd, for the next 50 years, shortstops didn't outhit second basemen again. There are blips in the messy chart -- every so often center fielders outhit left fielders, or second basemen match third basemen -- but the realignments are rare.\n\nSo what is happening at the corners, a blip or a realignment? Last year, third basemen hit better (relative to the rest of the league) than they had since 1970. First basemen hit worse than they had since 1951. On Aug. 31, just one point of OPS separated the league's third and first basemen. Third basemen then had a miserable September, but for the season they still nearly closed the extremely reliable gap between first and third base:\n\nESPN\n\nThere is, of course, context to this movement. Just a few years ago, baseball writers were in a panic over the disappearing first basemen, who were worse in 2012 than they'd been in years and were nearly absent from top prospect lists. First basemen recovered -- 13 got MVP votes in 2015, if we include the DHs who also played first -- and the panic looked to have been just one of those fluky aberrations. But here we are again. First basemen are mostly bad. The ones who are good are mostly old. No first baseman this year got a Rookie of the Year vote. And (with some caveats) there are no likely first basemen among at least the top 50 or 60 prospects in the game.\n\nWe could list any number of hypotheses -- about the role that shifts and strikeouts play in teams' defensive decisions, about whether easy homers have made slugging first basemen less special, about the impact of super-utility players on each team's defensive decisions, about the value of athleticism across all levels of the game -- but here are two that are accompanied by what I think are interesting data:\n\n1. It's about bullpens. Yes, bullpens. As starters throw fewer innings and relievers slot into specialized, limited roles, every team carries 12 pitchers and some carry 13. That leaves fewer roster spots for extra hitters and makes versatility almost a requirement for any non-star. The slugging bench bat who offers no defensive versatility is gone; players who can move up and down the defensive spectrum easily fill benches.\n\nAlways Late w/ Katie Nolan Always Late with Katie Nolan is a late-night sports comedy show covering the big (and small) stories of the week. Watch on ESPN+\n\nTwo consequences follow: One is that, when a starting first baseman gets hurt, doesn't hit or simply needs a day off, there is less likely to be a major league caliber backup ready to take his spot. A marginal first-base prospect might also get fewer chances, and a marginal first-base draft candidate might get passed over, shrinking the pool of future first basemen and future breakout candidates.\n\nThe other consequence is that, because there are so few position players available, there's a very good chance that every utility infielder (or utility outfielder or flexible starter, e.g., Whit Merrifield) is going to end up playing some first base. A record 189 players appeared at first base last year, the fifth year in a row that the league set that record. (Records were also set at second base, third base, center field, right field and catcher. They were nearly set at short, left and DH.) So first basemen move closer and closer to league-average offense because more first-baseman plate appearances are going to whatever average guy happens to be standing around with a glove.\n\nThis isn't only about first basemen. Look at that first chart, and you'll see almost all positions moving toward the average. Good fielders are forced to play positions at which the offensive standard has traditionally been higher, and good hitters are forced to play positions they were previously considered unqualified to defend. Offense in left field reached all-time lows in 2016 and 2017; right field had its all-time low in 2016 and DH had its all-time low in 2017, as many teams have decided they can't employ a full-time DH if they're carrying only 12 hitters. Over the past three years, meanwhile, second basemen and shortstops have been around league-average hitters, the highest they've been since the 1940s.\n\nThe bottom line is this: Differences among the nine non-pitching positions (as measured by standard deviation) have shrunk this decade to the lowest in history. In the 1970s, batters at \"offensive\" positions (first base, third base, left field, right field and DH) had an OPS 68 points higher than those at \"defensive\" positions (catcher, second base, shortstop, center field). Last decade, the difference was 59 points. This decade, the difference is just 39 points.\n\n2. It's about age. The roster crunch helps explain why first basemen don't collectively hit as well as they used to -- fewer are given chances to break out, and more of the plate appearances are going to non-first basemen -- but it doesn't explain why third basemen are simultaneously having their best seasons in a half-century. Earlier this week, though, we wrote about something that might offer an explanation: Young players are reaching their offensive peaks much earlier.\n\nNearly every player moves down the defensive spectrum as they age: Shortstops at 23 become second basemen at 29. Second basemen become third basemen. Third basemen become first basemen. And first basemen become DHs as they get thicker, slower, diminished by injury and so on. In any given year, then, the third basemen are going to be collectively younger than the first basemen. Last year, the 30 third basemen who played the most innings were almost two years younger than the 30 first basemen who played the most.\n\nBut while defense peaks early and declines almost immediately, the trade-off traditionally has been that the older players become better hitters. As we wrote earlier this week, that trend has reversed. Players are peaking at younger ages, not just in their defense or running skills, but in power hitting, plate discipline and overall offense. Last year's young players, 25 and under, were better than any young hitters in decades and better than the rest of the league, which is a rarity.\n\nThe consequence of that is that third basemen are no longer young defenders waiting for their power to develop at the plate. They're young defenders who are already developed, who are ready to hit major league pitching.\n\nA third possibility is that this is, in fact, just a blip. Maybe there's just a bunch of good third basemen right now and a dearth of good first basemen, because sometimes that happens. Just eight years ago, third basemen were as bad as they've been in decades, outhit even by second basemen. Just eight years ago, first basemen were dominant, with a collective OPS almost 100 points higher than that of third basemen.\n\nBut there's something about this chart that makes me think it's probably not a blip:\n\nESPN\n\nFor most of history -- at least since the DH was added to the American League -- first basemen, third basemen and DHs tracked each other pretty closely. Sometimes they were a little up, sometimes they were a little down, but they were usually up or down together. This makes sense: The positions overlap a lot, with DHs who often play first base, and first basemen who had just moved over from third base, and first basemen who sometimes play third. If there were a lot of good first basemen, the spillover would benefit third basemen and DHs too. They were a family, and they fluctuated like a family.\n\nLast year, though, they didn't move like a family. First basemen were as bad as they'd ever been, but the scarcity didn't affect either of the 1B-adjacent positions. DHs hit better. Third basemen hit better.\n\nIt suggests that we could be seeing a realignment around first base. There will always be a handful of walloping sluggers who can only play first base. Some will hit 45 homers and win MVP awards. But the way the game is played today, there might not be room for 30 of that type around the league. We might be seeing first base being pulled into the versatility era. We might see third basemen outhit first basemen in 2019. At least it's something to watch.\n\nHistorical stats via the Play Index at Baseball-Reference."}, {"url": "https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/traynor-pie", "page_content": "\"He was a mechanically perfect third baseman,\" legendary baseball executive Branch Rickey said of Pie Traynor upon his induction into the Hall of Fame. \"A man of intellectual worth on the field of play.\"\n\nTraynor was widely regarded as the premier third baseman of his era \u2013 and in 1948 he became the first third baseman elected by the Baseball Writers' Association of America to the Hall of Fame.\n\nTraynor was born and raised in Massachusetts, where he was nicknamed after his favorite desert as a youth.

Charlie Brown's team often lost by ugly scores, such as 123 - 0. The team is known to have won at least eight games. The first record for a season given in any comic strip was \"no wins and twenty losses.\"\n\nTwice, both in 1993, Charlie Brown hit a walk-off home run off Royanne Hobbs, named after the film character Roy Hobbs.\n\nIn the early days of the strip positions were generally not set. In the late 1950s, the typical lineup of Charlie Brown's team had become relatively stable. The lineup was:\n\nViolet also played left field. Pig-Pen also played at second base once. 555 95472, played some third base for the team, while Eudora was in center at times. Shermy was listed as a designated hitter in at least one game, and pitched in a few early games. Linus also played right field, once yelling out for someone to hit the ball his way because he was bored, as well as catching fly balls by holding his blanket out of house windows. He also played shortstop twice and even had a stint as a pitcher when Charlie Brown developed \"Little Leaguer's Elbow,\" and was much more successful, taking the team on a winning streak. When Charlie Brown returns, he temporarily plays third base. Schroeder also pitched one game, with Charlie Brown behind the plate. Charlie Brown was also shown playing center field in one strip, declaring that \"a good center fielder is the backbone of the team\".\n\nLucy also moved around the outfield often, played at both first and second once each, and even tried to pitch on two occasions. She also tried out for catcher, and after suiting up stated \"I feel like I'm in a bird cage ... tweet tweet chirp chirp\"). However by the next strip she returned to the outfield because she \"...refuse[s] to get hit by a flying bat and deprive the world of Miss Universe of 1975.\"\n\nOther characters had limited action with the team. Rerun van Pelt played one game in left field, and gave Charlie Brown's team a rare win with a walk-off walk. A gambling scandal (Rerun had bet Snoopy a nickel the team would win) caused the Little League president to reverse the victory. Woodstock tried out for the team once, but was cut. Sally never played, but occasionally came to the games to cheer on Linus, her \"Sweet Babboo.\"\n\nPeppermint Patty once offered to help out \"Chuck\" by pitching for his team (relegating Charlie Brown to left field). She would quit in disgust after just one game in which she hit five home runs and pitched a no-hitter, but lost 37 - 5, due to the team's poor defense.\n\nPeppermint Patty's team consisted of herself, a pitcher, Franklin, Roy and Jos\u00e9 Peterson, as well as Marcie for a short time.\n\nJoe Shlabotnik was Charlie Brown's favorite player and he was a fan of the San Francisco Giants - cartoonist Charles Schulz lived in northern California. In a December 22, 1962 strip Charlie Brown is shown stoic for the first three frames and in the final frame bursts into tears saying \"Why couldn't have McCovey hit the ball even two feet higher ...?!\" in reference to the Giants loss in the 1962 World Series. He also lost a spelling bee because he spelt \"maze\" M-A-Y-S.\n\nCharacters [ edit ]\n\n555 95472 [ edit ]\n\n555 \"5\" 95472 debuted in 1963, and continued to appear on and off until 1981. He had spiky hair and sometimes wore a shirt with the number five on it. 95472 was the family's \"last name\", with the accent on the 4; the name was actually their ZIP code, which corresponds that of Sebastopol, California.\n\nAs 5 once explained to Charlie Brown, his father, morose and hysterical over the preponderance of numbers in people's lives, had changed all of the family's names to numbers. Asked by Charlie Brown if it was Mr. 95472's way of protesting, 5 replied that this was actually his father's way of \"giving in.\" 5 also has two sisters, identical red-haired girls, named 3 and 4 (\"Nice feminine names,\" in Charlie Brown's sarcastic estimation). It can be assumed that their parents are named 1 and 2.\n\nSally Brown [ edit ]\n\nSally Brown was the younger sister of Charlie Brown, having been born on May 25, 1959. Unlike most of the Peanuts gang, she did not show much interest in playing sports, having never played on Charlie Brown's baseball team. As a baby, she liked being taken out for walks, which caused her brother to miss an important baseball game when he had to walk her around the neighborhood. He left her to return to the game due to the pleading of his team, and they quickly lost the game, causing Charlie Brown to incur both the wrath of his mother and his teammates.\n\nEudora [ edit ]\n\nEudora moved to Charlie Brown's neighborhood from another state in June 13, 1978. She had long, straight black hair and usually wears a knitted hat. The first character she first was Sally and the two girls quickly became friends. She played on Charlie Brown's team, taking the center field spot next to Lucy. It had once been held by Frieda, before she disappeared from the strip; Eudora would eventually disappear as well in 1987. Eudora was the last new character to join the Peanuts world who could arguably be classified as a \"major\" character.\n\nFrieda [ edit ]\n\nFrieda made her debut on March 6, 1961. She sat behind Linus in school and was a chatterbox, and managed to work her most prominent, her \"naturally curly hair,\" into every one of her conversations. She joined Charlie Brown's team as an outfielder, although she tends to be more interested in talking to fellow outfielder Lucy than she is in the game. She is the only player on Charlie Brown's team who does not wear a baseball cap as it would hide her naturally curly hair. Frieda owned a cat named Faron, whom she carried around in her arms. She made last appearance in 1975.\n\nFranklin [ edit ]\n\nFranklin was first introduced on July 31, 1968 as the first (and only) African-American character in the strip. Franklin's father was a soldier fighting in Vietnam, to which Charlie Brown replied \"My Dad's a barber...he was in a war too, but I don't know which one.\" He sits in front of Peppermint Patty in school, and is the center fielder of her baseball team.\n\nViolet Gray [ edit ]\n\nViolet Gray was the first major character to join the cast in 1951. In early strips she was shown with shoulder length dark hair in a pony-tail, but in later strips had her hair in a bun. She and her best friend Patty would berate Charlie Brown whenever the situation presented itself. Despite this, she played for Charlie Brown's baseball team, usually as an outfielder. She was phased out in the 1970s and left the strip in 1984.\n\nMarcie [ edit ]\n\nMarcie is Peppermint Patty's bespectacled best friend. She always referred to Peppermint Patty as \"sir.\" She made her first appearance on June 18, 1968, but was not mentioned by name until October 11, 1971. She was originally, as a bit dim-headed but would later be portrayed as an overachiever and the most academically bright of the Peanuts cast. She played on Peppermint Patty's team for a while. She quit after realizing that she hated baseball.\n\nPatty [ edit ]\n\nPatty appeared, along with Charlie Brown and Shermy,in the very first Peanuts strip. A fair-haired girl, her closest friend was Violet, however both disappeared by the late 1970s. She played outfield for Charlie Brown's team. Patty pretty much disappeared from the strip after 1970 or so, along with her friend Violet. Her last appearance was on April 17, 1995.\n\nJos\u00e9 Peterson [ edit ]\n\nJos\u00e9 Peterson was introduced in 1967 as a friend of Peppermint Patty. She recommended him to Charlie Brown to be on his baseball team as he was a very good hitter. After Peppermint Patty was disappointed in the quality of the rest of Charlie Brown's team, she and Jos\u00e9 decided to start a team in their own neighborhood. Before moving to Peppermint Patty's neighborhood, he had lived in New Mexico and North Dakota. Jos\u00e9 is notable in that his mixed ancestry \u2014 a Swedish-American father and Mexican-American mother \u2014 made him one of the first Hispanic characters in U.S. comics. After his his initial appearance, he was rarely, if ever, seen again.\n\nPig-Pen was the consistantly dirty, having a cloud of dirt and dust that follows him wherever he goes. Once right after washing and dressing in clean clothes, as Charlie Brown watched, Pig-Pen stepped outside and almost instantaneously became dirty and disheveled, and noted, \"You know what I am? I'm a dust magnet!\" On Charlie Brown's baseball team, he played at third base. He is known for kicking up an even bigger cloud of dirt while running on the basepaths and sliding into bases.\n\nPeppermint Patty [ edit ]\n\nPatricia \"Peppermint Patty\" Reichardt is a tomboy who made her first appearance on August 22, 1966. She loved baseball, regularly playing and easily defeating Charlie Brown's squad. She lives across town from Charlie Brown and his school friends and calls Charlie Brown \"Chuck\" and Lucy \"Lucille.\"\n\nRoy [ edit ]\n\nRoy was a minor character who was prominently featured in a mid-1960s storyline in which he met Charlie Brown at summer camp, becoming his friend due to their mutual loneliness. In a running gag, Roy had forgotten Charlie Brown's name, mentioning him as \"that round-headed kid.\" He always wore a sailor's cap and played for Peppermint Patty's baseball team, possibly as an infielder. He disappeared from the strip in the 1970s.\n\nSchroeder [ edit ]\n\nSchroeder was a skilled pianist who loved classical music and the composer Ludwig van Beethoven. He was the catcher on Charlie Brown's baseball team, and always walked back to the mound with the baseball, never throwing it - which he admitted was to prevent the other team to discover his lack of ability. He is also one of the few players who has any respect for Charlie Brown as a manager. In the 1950s, Charlie Brown's baseball team had to have a sponsor to play games, Schroeder's sponsor was \"Beethoven\".\n\nSchroeder was the object of Lucy van Pelt's unrequited infatuation she twice destroyed his piano in an attempt to be rid of the \"competition\" for his affection. He ordered replacement pianos from the Ace Piano Company and along with his new piano, he received an autographed photo of Joe Garagiola.\n\nShermy [ edit ]\n\nShermy was an early character in the comic strip Peanuts, having appeared in the comic's first strip. He role was that of a \"straight man\" for Charlie Brown and by the late 1950s his appearances were becoming noticeably rare, having been replaced by newer characters.\n\nIn a 1977 strip he was referred to by name when Charlie Brown and Lucy were discussing players on their baseball team. He was mentioned as the team's designated hitter, although in his days as a Peanuts regular (which predated the creation of the designated hitter), he usually played first base. He was the team's pitcher in early strips before Charlie Brown took over the mound duties.\n\nSnoopy [ edit ]\n\nSnoopy was Charlie Brown's beagle who made his first appearance in the strip's third strip. He a silent character for the first two years of his existence, but on May 27, 1952 he verbalized his thoughts to readers for the first time via a thought balloon. He frequently daydreams, most famously a World War I flying ace who dueled with Germany's Baron Manfred von Richthofen, the \"Red Baron\". He would also write on a typewriter with the eternal opener of \"It was a dark and stormy night...\" (from Edward George Bulwer-Lytton's 1830 novel Paul Clifford).\n\nSnoopy played shortstop on the Charlie Brown's team and was an offensive powerhouse. In the last game of 1973, Snoopy was one home run away from breaking Babe Ruth's career record of 714 before Hank Aaron who at the time had 713. However, during his at-bat Charlie Brown was picked off at first base, ending the season, denying his chance at the record.\n\nSnoopy also won the league's Rookie of the Year Award, which caused other teams to notice his skills. He was almost traded to Peppermint Patty's team twice, once for \"five good players\" (who stopped the deal when they announced they'd rather give up baseball than play for Charlie Brown), and once for Marcie (that trade was canceled after Snoopy turned up with a broken leg).\n\nSnoopy was also at the center of the biggest scandal in Peanuts baseball history, which caused Charlie Brown's team to forfeit a rare win. He had bet Rerun van Pelt a nickel on the game - against his own team - which was then won on a walk-off walk by Rerun.\n\nLinus van Pelt [ edit ]\n\nLinus van Pelt is Charlie Brown's younger best friend who first appeared on September 19, 1952. Though very young, Linus is unusually smart, and he acts as the strip's philosopher and theologian, often quoting Scripture and is fervent in his belief in the Great Pumpkin. Sally has an unrequited crush on him.\n\nLinus generally plays second base on Charlie Brown's team; who, with Snoopy, forms a double-play combo. Linus inappropriately stands on top of second base when taking his position. When Charlie Brown is unable to pitch, Linus takes the mound and is unhittable to the opposition, allowing his team to always win the games in which he pitches.\n\nLucy van Pelt [ edit ]\n\nLucy van Pelt is the older sister of Linus van Pelt and Rerun van Pelt. She has a dominant personality, is crabby and cynical, and is often mean to the other characters in the strip, particularly her brother and Charlie Brown. She is a self-proclaimed psychiatrist, although her most prominent patient, Charlie Brown, doesn't really believe she does much good. She is convinced that Schroeder is her boyfriend, despite his denials.\n\nOn Charlie Brown's baseball team, Lucy primarily plays center field but has been shown in both right and left field. She is a stupendously inept player, who, when temporarily kicked off the team, turns to heckling the games. She has a knack for coming up with a novel excuse for every fly ball she misses (\"The moons of Saturn got in my eyes\" or \"I think there were toxic substances coming from my glove, and they made me dizzy\").\n\nCharlie Brown once traded Lucy to Peppermint Patty's team for Marcie and a pizza. Once Peppermint Patty discovered what a terrible player Lucy really was, she traded her back. Even on the ball field, Lucy continually flirts with Schroeder, who plays catcher on Charlie Brown's team. She even smacked a home run once, when Schroeder promised he'd kiss her at home plate if she hit a dinger.\n\nRerun van Pelt [ edit ]\n\nRerun van Pelt was Linus and Lucy's younger brother having been \"born\" into the strip in 1972, but his first actual appearance was on March 26, 1973. Lucy, who always wanted to be an only child (or have a younger sister), was less than thrilled at the prospect of having a second younger brother, and commented that getting a second younger brother was like watching reruns on television. Thus, Linus came up with the idea of calling the family's new addition \"Rerun.\"\n\nRerun's first storyline involved a still pre-verbal Rerun becoming a player on Charlie Brown's baseball team and being involved in a gambling scandal that ended in the team having to forfeit one of their rare victories after he won the game on a walk-off walk.\n\nWoodstock [ edit ]\n\nWoodstock was a small yellow bird and friend of Snoopy. He became a full-fledged character on June 22, 1970 (taking his name from the music festival of the previous year). Snoopy is the only non-avian character who can understand his language. He was one of only two players ever cut from Charlie Brown's hapless baseball team. Lucy was the other, but she was quickly reinstated."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/sports/baseball/Outfielders", "page_content": "The three outfielders are positioned so as to best be able to catch or field balls that are batted over or through the infield. The three outfield positions are left fielder, centre fielder, and right fielder. Outfielders must be able to judge the trajectory of flies and have enough speed to run to the point where the ball will come down. Batted or thrown balls that pass beyond the infielders along the ground must be run down and picked up by the outfielders. Outfielders adjust their positions in response to each batter\u2019s hitting tendencies. Strong throwing arms are essential, as is accuracy in throwing the ball to the right point in the infield. Right fielders typically have the strongest and most accurate throwing arms among outfielders. The centre fielder is chosen for his speed and expert judgment of fly balls. The centre fielder not only stations himself at a strategic point for each batter but often directs the playing positions of his outfield teammates. Almost invariably the most skillful defensive outfielders in baseball history, such as Tris Speaker , Joe DiMaggio , Willie Mays , and Ken Griffey, Jr., have been centre fielders.\n\nInfielders\n\nThe infielders form the inner ring of defense. They sometimes catch line drives on the fly, but mainly they pick up ground balls that roll toward the outfield or shoot swiftly across the grass on one or more bounces. When a batted ball strikes the ground, the play becomes a race between the batter running to first and an infielder trying to gain control of the ball and throw it. Like the outfielders, the four infielders shift position to guard against each batter\u2019s individual strengths. They have the additional responsibility of guarding the bases when occupied. When a ball is batted along the ground, only one infielder is called upon to gain control of it, but at least one other almost always covers a base to take the throw. Depending on the situation, sometimes two bases must be covered for a possible throw, sometimes all four. On a ball hit into the outfield, an infielder may need to position himself to receive a throw from an outfielder.\n\nEach position has its special fielding requirements. Usually positioned to the left of second base, shortstop is the most difficult and demanding of the defensive positions, requiring outstanding agility, range, and a strong throwing arm. The throw from the shortstop to first base is the infield\u2019s longest and most difficult. The second baseman, who is typically positioned to the right of second base, does not require an exceptionally strong arm, but he does need as much range and agility as the shortstop. Together the shortstop and second baseman form the keystone of the defense, as both cover second base, take most of the throws from the outfield, and handle the majority of ground balls. Many of the game\u2019s greatest fielding players have been shortstops and second basemen, among them Honus Wagner, Pee Wee Reese, Dave Concepci\u00f3n, Ozzie Smith, and Omar Vizquel at shortstop and Nap Lajoie, Charlie Gehringer, Bill Mazeroski, Joe Morgan, and Roberto Alomar at second base.\n\nThe third baseman, playing to the right of third base and nearer the batter than the shortstop or second baseman, is not called on to cover as much ground, but his reflexes must be exceptional. The long throw across the infield requires a strong and accurate arm. First basemen are typically physically large in order to provide a big target for throws to first base. The first baseman\u2019s fielding of grounders is made easier by his position near the base toward which the batter is running. First basemen are often left-handed, an advantage in throwing from their position, and are generally among the most powerful hitters in the lineup."}, {"url": "https://www.theringer.com/mlb/2018/3/9/17099736/mlb-preview-past-present-future-of-outfield-shifting-phillies", "page_content": "From the late 1940s through the early 1960s, Nino Escalera never went long between baseball games. The Santurce native played for minor league teams in seven states before making the majors with the Cincinnati Redlegs in 1954. He stuck with the Redlegs all season but batted .159, less than his listed weight. For the next eight years, he toiled in Triple-A; with the Havana Sugar Kings, Cincinnati\u2019s Triple-A affiliate, he played outfield and first base in front of Fidel Castro. Each winter, he went home and started his second season, becoming a Puerto Rican winter league legend and eventually earning induction to the Puerto Rico Baseball Hall of Fame. After retiring, he scouted for the Mets and the Giants for almost three more decades. But for most who know his name, Escalera\u2019s baseball life boils down to two plate appearances: one he made, and one he watched from the field.\n\nThe Ringer\u2019s 2018 MLB Preview Check out all of The Ringer\u2019s MLB coverage leading up to Opening Day\n\nEscalera is primarily remembered for a first. When he made his major league debut, pinch hitting and singling for Cincinnati in the seventh inning on April 17, 1954, the then-24-year-old became the first black player in the franchise\u2019s history. (The next batter, pinch hitter Chuck Harmon, became the franchise\u2019s first African American player.) At 88, Escalera is the most senior of three surviving ex-players to have integrated an MLB club.\n\nEscalera\u2019s MLB career was limited to 73 games and 77 plate appearances for that 1954 team, getting most of his meager playing time as a pinch hitter, pinch runner, or defensive replacement. But before being demoted, he made more history, this time as the last to have done something. On May 22 in St. Louis, Escalera, a left-handed thrower, played shortstop, or so the box score said. No left-handed thrower has done so since.\n\nWith the Redlegs leading 4-2 with two out in the bottom of the eighth, the Cardinals\u2019 Red Schoendienst singled off starter Art Fowler, bringing the tying run to the plate. The tying-run-representer was Stan Musial, whom Escalera describes by phone as \u201cthe greatest ballplayer in the league.\u201d (Willie Mays might beg to differ.) Musial had singled in his previous two trips to the plate and had hit a pivotal grand slam in the game before. To prevent Musial from reaching scoring position by driving a ball into the gap, the Redlegs\u2019 rookie manager did something drastic, and probably unprecedented.\n\n\u201cBirdie Tebbetts was the manager, and he made a shift on Stan Musial,\u201d Escalera remembers. \u201cThe shortstop was [Roy] McMillan, and they took him out and they put me in to play right-center. And they left that left side open.\u201d\n\nWriting in the Sporting News on June 2, Tom Swope described \u201cwhat probably was the first four-man outfield formation of its kind ever used in major league society.\u201d The article included a diagram of the unorthodox defense, similar to a display Escalera says he has in his home to this day.\n\nIn becoming the last left-handed \u201cshortstop,\u201d Escalera had also become the first fourth man in an outfield (excluding baseball\u2019s mid-19th-century formative years, when amateur proto-shortstops used to play shallow outfield by default).\n\n\u201cI had no idea it was coming until the game. And the game got so tight, you do it when the [situation] comes up. But it worked all right!\u201d \u2014Nino Escalera\n\nEscalera, who says he liked playing for Tebbetts, describes him as \u201cactive\u201d and \u201cone of the intelligent baseball managers.\u201d Perhaps echoing the ethos of a pre\u2013Seitz decision era when the clubhouse balance of power was tilted more toward the manager than it is today\u2014and when tactics were in some ways more malleable than they are today\u2014he adds, \u201cWhatever he said to me, I would do it.\u201d In the weeks leading up to that game, Tebbetts, a longtime big-league catcher who\u2019d exploit any edge, had schooled some of his players on the strategy, but Escalera wasn\u2019t one of them. \u201cI had no idea it was coming until the game,\u201d Escalera says. \u201cAnd the game got so tight, you do it when the [situation] comes up. But it worked all right!\u201d\n\nMusial was taken aback, too. In the book Birdie: Confessions of a Baseball Nomad, Tebbetts said, \u201cMusial complained to the umpire, but there was nothing he could do about it,\u201d and Swope\u2019s account notes that first-base ump Dusty Boggess briefly halted the game until he was satisfied that Cincinnati didn\u2019t have too many men on the field. Although there\u2019s no way to know whether the extra outfielder affected Musial\u2019s mind-set, Escalera says the alignment was \u201can advantage for us, in that situation.\u201d And on that day, fortune favored the bold. Fowler, a knuckleballer, fanned Stan the Man on what Fowler told media was \u201cthe best fastball I\u2019ve thrown in two years,\u201d and the Redlegs went on to win.Tebbetts explained to Swope that he\u2019d picked that day to deploy the shift because of Busch Stadium\u2019s odd outfield dimensions. If Musial lined a ball off the park\u2019s shallow right-center-field fence, one of the evenly spaced outfielders would have time to retrieve it and hold the lefty to a single. In a piece in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch about his \u201crevolutionary brainchild,\u201d Tebbetts said, \u201cSince I couldn\u2019t play a man on the roof, I did the next-best thing by adding a fourth outfielder to prevent the only other kind of hit that would have bothered me.\u201d And he told the AP, \u201cThey don\u2019t pay fellows like [Eddie] Mathews and Musial to hit singles in the clutch. I\u2019m willing to let them bunt for a hit and give them first base. They can\u2019t hurt you with a home run that way.\u201d\n\nAs Escalera\u2019s adventure reveals, a willingness to tinker with the standard spread of fielders in left, center, and right isn\u2019t solely a 21st-century trait. Almost 64 years after Tebbetts hoisted his left arm to signal for a shortstop, though, the outfield is still baseball\u2019s final defensive frontier. Four-man outfields remain a rarity, but modern managers are showing renewed interest in the tactic that Tebbetts pioneered. And as precise tracking technology enables increasingly accurate estimates of likely batted-ball locations, progressive players, coaches, and front-office analysts are continuing what Tebbetts began, redefining what outfields can look like in an experimental process that\u2019s proceeding in earnest this spring.\n\nLately, infield shifting has lost a little of its revolutionary luster. After years of watching what once would have been singles swallowed by players arrayed to one side of the second-base bag, the standard overshift on pull-heavy hitters no longer qualifies as cutting edge, and watching teams toy with a slow-paced Albert Pujols is just sort of sad. Even the grounders that still sneak through the sides vacated by repositioned players aren\u2019t eliciting the complaints from fielders and pitchers that seemed so routine a few years ago. After a continuous climb over several seasons, the use of infield shifts\u2014which were roughly 11 times more common in 2016 than they had been five years before\u2014actually declined slightly last year, according to Baseball Info Solutions. Although the shift remains roughly as effective as ever when batters hit the ball on the ground, hitters have grown more adept at elevating the ball when the shift is in effect, as FanGraphs\u2019 Travis Sawchik has shown. Because line drives and fly balls tend to do more damage than grounders, more and more teams are turning their attention to optimizing their alignments against balls in the air.\n\nAlthough the basic concept of shifting\u2014stationing fielders in spots where they\u2019re more likely to intercept balls\u2014is the same everywhere on the field, outfield shifting is comparatively complicated. For one thing, fly balls tend to be more evenly distributed in direction than grounders, as revealed by the breakdown below of batted balls from last season.\n\n2017 Batted-Ball Directions Batted-Ball Type Pull % Middle % Oppo % Batted-Ball Type Pull % Middle % Oppo % Ground ball 53.7 33.6 12.7 Fly ball 24 36.7 39.3\n\nThe less predictable the batted-ball tendencies, the fewer the obvious opportunities to take away hits. There are additional drawbacks unique to outfield shifts: For one, there\u2019s more ground to cover in the outfield than the infield, and the potential cost (and embarrassment) of allowing a hit that otherwise would have been fielded is steeper; a gift from an infield shift usually results in a single, while a gift from an outfield shift might mean two to four bases. For another, the greater square footage and lack of landmarks in the outfield makes proper positioning more difficult on a fundamental level, requiring accoutrements like index cards, more memorization or, somewhat controversially, laser rangefinders combined with physical markings on the field. In the case of a four-man outfield, the defensive demands are greater, too; adding an outfielder without burning a bench spot (as Tebbetts did when he summoned Escalera) requires a rover with both infield and outfield experience.\n\nIt took plenty of time for infield shifts to catch on. In Birdie, Tebbetts credited the well-known overshift that Indians manager Lou Boudreau debuted against Ted Williams in 1946 for inspiring his own outfield alignment, but Boudreau may not have been the first to shift against Williams, and the concept dates back at least to the 1920s, if not to the 19th century. By the time Tebbetts began blazing trails in the outfield, Boudreau wasn\u2019t the only infield shifter in a big-league dugout. The opposing manager in the series that featured the first four-man outfield, the Cardinals\u2019 Eddie Stanky, was always in search of an edge, and habitually shifted against pull-oriented lefties like Mathews and righties like Ralph Kiner and Hank Sauer. In fact, the day after Escalera\u2019s milestone moment, Stanky shifted against Cincinnati\u2019s All-Star center fielder Gus Bell, Escalera\u2019s right-hand man in the four-man outfield. Bell, a lefty, grounded a hit through the shift to left field, which kicked off a four-run flurry and forced Stanky to defend his decision. \u201cAs long as my figures show we\u2019re better off, we\u2019ll continue to shift,\u201d he said to the Sporting News.\n\nIt took another half-century for infield shifting to spread, but once the post-Moneyball movement toward data-driven decision-making removed much of the front-office resistance, it quickly became ubiquitous. The four-man outfield, meanwhile, has disappeared and resurfaced every decade or two, often hailed as groundbreaking by observers who weren\u2019t aware that it had happened before.\n\nThe ideal candidate for a four-man outfield is an extreme fly-ball hitter with pronounced pull tendencies on grounders but an all-fields fly-ball pattern, all of which is subject to change based on the ballpark, the pitcher, and even the count. Only so many combinations of matchups that fit the perfect profile, game states that call for a crackdown on extra-base hits, and managers daring enough to risk criticism in pursuit of a theoretical edge without a proven track record arise, especially given that field dimensions have grown more homogenous over time. It\u2019s easy for skittish skippers to eschew extra outfielders by deferring to tradition. \u201cI\u2019m not that smart,\u201d former manager Davey Johnson\u2014himself a sabermetric innovator\u2014said in 1999. \u201cThe way they invented the game, they had four infielders and three infielders.\u201d\n\nYet following Musial\u2019s strikeout, Tebbetts expressed his intention to keep using the strategy, and he did so sporadically against certain sluggers for the rest of his career. As late as June 1966, about two months before he managed his last game, Tebbetts deployed a four-man outfield against Senators slugger Frank Howard, explaining for the umpteenth time, \u201cIf I only overshift in the infield, he might get a double and be in scoring position. I put in the fourth outfielder, and I take away that double.\u201d\n\nIn 1969, Reds manager Dave Bristol used a four-man outfield against the Giants\u2019 Willie McCovey. So did Mets manager Gil Hodges, who also applied it to Dick Allen and Frank Robinson (who\u2019d previously played outfield for Tebbetts). While with Texas, Whitey Herzog used a four-man outfield in the first and third innings against Harmon Killebrew in April 1973, and in May 1978, Herzog\u2019s Royals used a four-man outfield four times against Jim Rice. And in 1999, multiple teams tried it against Mark McGwire, fresh off his 70-homer season.\n\nFound this fantastic image in our archive, of the Reds shift against @SFGiants lefty Willie McCovey in 1969.

Although Maddon\u2019s Cubs were the only team to try it in 2017, they weren\u2019t the only one to consider it; buzz about the idea has been building, and at least two other teams seriously considered implementing it last season. (The midyear demotion of fly-ball extremist Ryan Schimpf removed the majors\u2019 most vulnerable four-man-outfield candidate.)\n\nThe four-man outfield, then, is not close to new. Even the five-man infield in a non-walk-off situation, another reputedly boundary-breaking idea, has happened before; Dodgers manager Chuck Dressen tried it on April 20, 1951, against the Giants\u2019 Artie Wilson, a speedster who supposedly never pulled the ball\u2014and even Dressen borrowed the idea from an earlier minor league game. (Wilson\u2019s major-league career, unsurprisingly, lasted 16 more games, in which he posted a .396 OPS.) A few years later, ex-Dodgers GM Branch Rickey introduced the idea to the Pirates. There\u2019s been a lot of baseball.\n\nWhat is different today is how teams are deciding to set up their defense. We know more today about the batted-ball tendencies of the 1954 Redlegs\u2019 opponents than Tebbetts did at the time; Musial, it turns out, wasn\u2019t an extreme fly-ball hitter in the mid-1950s, although Mays, another Tebbetts shift target, was. When Cubs manager Jim Riggleman rolled out a four-man outfield against McGwire in May \u201999, he justified the decision by saying, \u201cI keep charts, like everybody does, on where everybody hits the ball, and Mark, against us, has not hit ground balls to second. So we pulled a person out of that position.\u201d If Riggleman was relying only on games that McGwire had played against his Cubs prior to the series, he was basing the move on a sample of only 49 at-bats. Today, teams have detailed data on the angle and hardness of hitters\u2019 (and pitchers\u2019) batted balls from the minors on up, with three years, minimum, of radar-derived major league measurements. No one need trust a small sample.\n\nBIS doesn\u2019t track outfield shifts, but that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t out there. Over the past couple of seasons, writers have reported Sasquatchesque sightings of more and more extreme three-man outfield alignments. In August 2016, the Astros almost abandoned right field against the Pirates\u2019 Gregory Polanco, who hits his highest percentage of flies to left; last September, the Diamondbacks entirely abandoned left field against the Rockies DJ LeMahieu, a right-handed hitter who pulls very few flies. At least once, it worked.\n\nAccording to Statcast data on outfielder starting position provided by Major League Baseball Advanced Media, the teams with the greatest combined variation in outfielder starting position last season, summing all three outfield positions, were\u2014surprise!\u2014the Rays and the Astros, both of whom were also among the top three in 2016. League-wide, there\u2019s no evidence that the variation increased from 2016 to 2017 (2015 data isn\u2019t available). But the top shifting teams may be getting more adventurous: The 2017 Rays, Astros, and White Sox all varied their outfield starting positions more than any team did in 2016.\n\nAlthough teams will likely continue to push the outfield envelope along the same lines in 2018, even Astros-style shifts aren\u2019t the newest new thing. The latest innovation isn\u2019t moving outfielders one way or another, but asking them to trade places. \u201cMy guess is that within a couple of decades we\u2019ll see corner outfielders routinely swap spots,\u201d ESPN\u2019s Sam Miller wrote after Maddon\u2019s four-man-outfield defense against Votto. Make that more like seven months.\n\nOver the past several years, proposing unorthodox defensive strategies has been a popular pastime on sabermetric sites. Many of the writers who\u2019ve produced those articles have since gone on to get jobs with teams, working in capacities that may allow them to exert a tangible influence on their clubs\u2019 in-game tactics. In 2012, Baseball Prospectus\u2019s Max Marchi advocated bringing back the Tebbetts Shift; in 2014, the Indians hired him. In 2015, Chris Mosch chronicled incipient outfield shifting at BP; the following year, he went to work for the Angels. In 2016, FanGraphs\u2019 August Fagerstrom broke down the best candidates for a five-man infield and four-man outfield; later that year, the Brewers hired him. And back in 2011, Beyond the Box Score\u2019s Lewie Pollis made the case for what he called \u201cadaptive defense\u201d\u2014alternating fielders between two positions based on the hitter\u2019s handedness and batted-ball distribution, with the goal of assigning the superior fielder to the spot where the ball is more likely to be. Pollis is now a quantitative analyst in the Phillies\u2019 R&D department\u2014and not by coincidence, the Phillies are experimenting with mid-inning corner-outfielder swapping this spring.\n\n\u201cWe now have plenty of evidence that shows why this could be a successful strategy, and we\u2019re not afraid to show that evidence to our players.\u201d\u2014Sam Fuld, Phillies major league player information coordinator\n\nPollis, manager Gabe Kapler, and major league player information coordinator Sam Fuld\u2014the latter two of whom are former MLB outfielders\u2014have individually wondered about position-swapping for years, Fuld says via direct message. Now, the passage of time has brought them together on a team full of pliable players, in a period when players\u2019 resistance to shifting has largely subsided. Fuld, a skilled defender who last played in 2015, says that 10 years ago, swapping corner outfielders would have seemed like a crazy idea. \u201cFive years ago,\u201d he continues, \u201cit would have still been pretty nuts. Today it remains novel, but with the right personnel (younger, open-minded players) I think the swap can be executed without a lot of cynicism. Infield shifting has become so commonplace, so outfield maneuvering doesn\u2019t seem as odd as it once did. Also, we now have plenty of evidence that shows why this could be a successful strategy, and we\u2019re not afraid to show that evidence to our players.\u201d\n\nFuld acknowledges that there\u2019s an ego component to the outfield swap, especially because it isn\u2019t established practice. Thus far, though, the Phillies haven\u2019t encountered any resistance. \u201cOur guys have been very receptive, so they haven\u2019t even necessarily asked for proof that it may work,\u201d Fuld says. \u201cBut we have it if they want to lay eyes on it at any point.\u201d\n\nUnlike the four-man outfield, which forces a team to risk ridicule for an expected benefit of fractions of a run, the value of season-long swapping could quickly add up\u2014especially for the Phillies, who figure to have a big gap in defensive skill on days when the natural first baseman Rhys Hoskins and the speedy Aaron Altherr (who helpfully has experience in right and left, where fly balls break differently) are both manning corners. In 2013, BP\u2019s Russell Carleton calculated that consistent corner-swapping could save a team close to half a win, and maybe more with the right personnel and analysis.\n\nAlthough \u201cnothing new under the sun\u201d is the theme of allegedly unheard-of defense (at least since the \u201950s), the \u201cadaptive defense\u201d idea might genuinely be without precedent if the Phillies pull off the plan with any regularity. The Baseball-Reference database contains only 15 games in which at least one outfielder switched corners more than two times, most or all of which don\u2019t fit the Phillies plan\u2019s profile. Only twice has the swap happened more than twice in one game, and both cases were desperate, injury-ridden, extra-inning games where a pitcher played the field. On May 14, 1988, Cardinals pitcher Jos\u00e9 DeLe\u00f3n swapped corners with Tom Brunansky 11 times, starting in the 16th inning; DeLe\u00f3n caught one fly in the 17th, but couldn\u2019t track down the game-winning double two innings later.\n\n\u201cIt took Cecil twice as long to get across the field as me. I was just nervous as a caged cat.\u201d\u2014Kelly Gruber, former Blue Jays second baseman\n\nOn occasion, we\u2019ve seen similar extremes in the infield, but again only out of necessity. On consecutive days in 1959, the Indians\u2019 Woodie Held and Granny Hamner swapped 16 and 17 times, respectively, at second and short when second baseman Billy Martin was hurt. And in the same month as the DeLe\u00f3n game, Jimy Williams\u2019s Blue Jays lost second baseman Manny Lee to a sore shoulder not long before first pitch. Working with what he had, Williams swapped starting second baseman Kelly Gruber and starting third baseman Cecil Fielder a record 18 times, based on the batter\u2019s handedness. Gruber, the team\u2019s regular third baseman, had some professional experience at second; Fielder, a first baseman/DH, had none. \u201cIt took Cecil twice as long to get across the field as me,\u201d a laughing Gruber says by phone, adding, \u201cI was just nervous as a caged cat \u2026 that wasn\u2019t a position I was put in often.\u201d\n\nLast August, the Mets, who were without injured infielders Jos\u00e9 Reyes and Wilmer Flores, tied that 1988 record for single-game position changes by swapping starting second baseman Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera and starting third baseman Travis d\u2019Arnaud 18 times. Those outlier episodes, like Alfonso Soriano\u2019s 10th-inning tour of the field in 2009, were last-ditch attempts to avoid disaster. The Phillies\u2019 spring experiment is a carefully considered strategy to seek out success.\n\nThe irony of all of this optimization is that fielding opportunities are dwindling by the year. Thanks to rising strikeout and home-run rates, the average pitching staff last season allowed 405 fewer balls in play than the typical staff in 2003, a reduction of roughly 2.5 balls in play per game over 15 seasons. When it comes to designing the defense of the future, teams are fighting over smaller scraps, using similar stats. To outfield the field, they have to be fearless. \u201cIf I can figure out any move that I think will help my ball club win a game, I\u2019ll use it,\u201d Tebbetts said in 1955. \u201cI don\u2019t care whether it\u2019s considered unorthodox. If it helps me, it\u2019s all right.\u201d In his day, that attitude may have made Tebbetts unusual. Today, it might make him mainstream.\n\nThanks to Martin Alonso of Baseball Prospectus, Daren Willman of MLBAM, and Hans Van Slooten of Baseball-Reference for research assistance."}, {"url": "https://ballnerd.com/shortstop-in-baseball-a-complete-guide/", "page_content": "The shortstop position in baseball serves many roles on the diamond. The position requires a wide array of skills. Above all, shortstops are a vital part of any baseball team.\n\nIn this article, we will discuss their position on the field, the role of a shortstop, and the ideal qualities a successful shortstop possesses. Finally, discover a few tips on how to become a great shortstop.\n\nFirst, let us start by answering the question, what is a shortstop in baseball?\n\nA shortstop is a player who is positioned between second and third base on defense. They cover the most ground of any defensive position on the diamond. Shortstops have many defensive responsibilities.\n\nWith a general idea of what a shortstop is, let us look at what position they play.\n\nWhat Position Does A Shortstop Play?\n\nWhen on the field, a shortstop positions themselves between second and third base.\n\nSince a third baseman often plays close to third base, there is a sizable gap between second base and the edge of a third baseman\u2019s range. This gap is defended by the shortstop.\n\nShortstops must possess the ability to cover a lot of ground. Due to this, they also need a strong arm as most throws to first are rather far.\n\nOn offense, shortstops can bat anywhere in the order. Their offensive skill set determines their place in the batting order. However, most shortstops are athletic, making them a great asset in a team\u2019s baserunning game.\n\nCurrently, there are several prolific offensive shortstops in Major League Baseball. These include current free agents Carlos Correa and Francisco Lindor of the New York Mets.\n\nRead on to find out what the role of the shortstop is.\n\nWhat Is The Role Of A Shortstop?\n\nShortstops have many roles on a baseball team. These roles include:\n\nDefensive Specialist,\n\nCommunicator\n\nSecondary Field General.\n\nDefensive Specialist\n\nNo matter what, shortstops must have strong defensive skills.\n\nThe greatest shortstops are known for their range. Any ball hit to the left side of the infield should be within range for a shortstop to field.\n\nIn addition, they are responsible for any balls hit up the middle of the diamond that are out of the reach of the second baseman.\n\nBalls hit to the shortstop are often hit hard. It is a very reactionary position, much like third base.In addition to fielding grounders and pop ups, shortstops are also responsible for taking cut off throws from the outfield.\n\nOn balls hit to left field or center field, a shortstop runs into the outfield grass to receive a throw from the outfielder. Then, they throw the ball to whichever base they can make a play at.\n\nCommunicator\n\nWorking in tandem with the second baseman, a shortstop must communicate effectively with their double play partner.\n\nA shortstop must communicate when they are covering second base, or heading into the outfield to receive a cut off throw. The shortstop and second baseman have to understand who is located where during each play.\n\nWith both positions responsible for defending the same base, clear and effective communication is of the utmost importance.\n\nSecondary Field General\n\nFor the most part, a catcher is considered the field general on defense. However, shortstops are also responsible for helping their fellow players.\n\nWhen a third baseman has to guard close to the third base line, shortstops support them by covering more ground towards the third base area. When a second baseman shifts their defensive alignment toward first, shortstop must support them too.\n\nShortstops often relay the defensive alignment to the second baseman. This is to ensure they both understand their responsibilities on a given play.\n\nRead on to find out which ideal qualities make for a great shortstop.\n\nWhat Makes For A Great Shortstop?\n\nOverall, a great shortstop must have certain qualities. As mentioned early, a shortstop needs to have great range and a strong arm. In addition, they need athleticism and strong communication skills.\n\nThe truly great shortstops of all time are the rare ones who possess all of these qualities, and then some.\n\nRange\n\nRange is defined as the amount of ground a player can cover when fielding a ball in play.\n\nWith a position that is essentially an extra defensive player, shortstops are asked to cover a lot of ground. From a ball hit up the middle, to a foul ball by the left field stands, a shortstop has to reach all of them.\n\nThe greatest defensive shortstops, like Derek Jeter and Ozzie Smith were known for this ability.\n\nStrong Arm\n\nIn addition to range, a shortstop needs to have a strong, accurate arm.\n\nDue to the amount of ground they cover, some throws are farther than others. A shortstop needs a strong arm to make sure they can always make an accurate throw, no matter where they are located. This is also helpful on cut off throws from the outfield.\n\nWhen covering second on a double play ball, they run the risk of getting wiped out by a sliding baserunner. To complete the double play, a shortstop uses their strong arm to get the most velocity on the throw to first base.\n\nAthleticism\n\nAthleticism plays a big role in determining how successful a shortstop will be.\n\nA critical part of how much range a shortstop can cover is how fast they can react and change direction. A quick reaction time or being light on their feet is the difference between making a play and allowing a hit. In order to be a great shortstop, they must have lateral quickness and great reaction time.\n\nCommunication\n\nMuch like every other position in baseball, the non-physical aspects of the position are almost as important as the physical aspects.\n\nA great shortstop must effectively communicate with the second baseman. These two positions work in tandem. Without good communication, miscues can happen.\n\nWith the somewhat free flowing nature of the position, a shortstop has a lot of responsibilities. To ensure the desired outcome, their teammates need to know where they will be on any given play.\n\nNow that we know which qualities a great shortstop has, here are 5 tips on how to become a successful shortstop.\n\n5 Tips To Become a Great Shortstop\n\nNot everyone is cut out to be a shortstop. However, aspiring shortstops should consider these 5 tips on how to become a great shortstop.\n\n1. Study The Game\n\nJust like every other position in baseball, great shortstops need to possess a high baseball IQ. This is done by studying the game. A player can hone their natural instincts by breaking down game film.\n\nPlayers should study great shortstops. Take notice of how they play the position.\n\nOnce a player has the basics down, they should start to consider how they would react during a certain play or situation. In the long run, this will help tremendously.\n\n2. Work On Perfecting Defensive Skills\n\nDefense is the most important part of a shortstop\u2019s game. Without it, they will not stick at the position for long. Take as many ground balls as possible.\n\nWork on cut off throws, double plays, and throws to each base. Even work on off balance throws. The more each situation is practiced, the faster it becomes second nature.\n\nOnce a player is in a game, they can let their body react exactly how they practiced it.\n\n3. Work On Perfecting Offensive Skills\n\nWhile defense is important, a great offensive shortstop is a rare enough commodity that those who can hit will be sought after by any team.\n\nThis can be done by taking extra batting practice, working on strike zone awareness, and hitting off of a tee.\n\nIn addition, a player should work on their baserunning ability too. Stealing bases is great, but smart base running is what matters most in baseball.\n\n4. Work On The Physical Side\n\nOne of the best physical tools a shortstop can have is athleticism. It is their quickness and agility that sets them apart from others.\n\nTo boost a player\u2019s chances of succeeding at the position, they should focus on enhancing their physical tools. This can be done through agility drills and weight training.\n\nConsider consulting a personal trainer or attending a speed camp. All of these can improve a player\u2019s game in the long run.\n\n5. Understand How To Communicate Effectively\n\nBesides the physical tools, the shortstop position requires someone who is a strong communicator. Communication with the second baseman, outfielders and other infielders is necessary.\n\nIf a shortstop can show this skill, teams will be happy to include them on their team. Start learning this early. Understand what needs to be communicated and how to do it effectively.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nIn all, shortstops are a vital piece of a baseball team. Due to the amount of responsibilities they have, the position requires a rather specific skill set.\n\nA player\u2019s defensive and physical tools determine their success at the position. While these tools can be taught and refined, those who go on to become great shortstops usually have some of it come naturally.\n\nOverall, shortstops are a special position on the diamond and it takes a special player to play it.\n\nLearn more about the other Baseball positions:"}, {"url": "https://legionreport.com/why-is-it-called-a-shortstop-in-baseball/", "page_content": "Have you noticed when you watch baseball games that each position corresponds to where they are on the field? It\u2019s very simple, the pitcher pitches the ball, the catcher catches the ball. Positions of first base, second base, and third base all make perfect sense to where the player stands on the field. The outfield positions also make perfect sense, left, center, and right field.\n\nBut what about Shortstop? Without knowing anything else about baseball, you would have to simply guess where the shortstop plays. Why is it called a shortstop in baseball? Why is it called a shortstop? What is a shortstop?\n\nA shortstop is called a shortstop because the player is stopping the short side of the field. In this spot of shortstop, the player acts as a cutoff for the left and centerfielders, making their throws shorter to each base. The ball \u201cstops\u201d there before being relayed to another position.\n\nThe name shortstop is also derived from the very early days of baseball when there were 4 outfielders. One of which was played very shallow, between the infields and outfielders.\n\nThe majority of baseball players bat right-handed, increasing the odds of balls being hit to the left side of the infield. Without someone protecting the large gap between second base and third base, that area was wide open to get a hit. In the earliest days of baseball, players realized this was too large of a gap and that the fourth outfielder could help stop that huge gap by moving in closer to the infield.\n\nThis in turn helped create the term \u201cshortstop\u201d. The outfield was moving in shorter to the infield and acting as a stop to that huge gap between second base and third base.\n\nWhat does the term shortstop refer to?\n\nThe shortstop is considered the captain of the infield. Partly because they are in the middle of the field and are the liaison between the outfield and infield. The shortstop position is played between second base and third base.\n\nThe term shortstop comes from the earliest days of baseball when the game was still in the process of ironing out rules and positions. As stated previously, the term is simply from stopping the massive gap that\u2019s between second base and third base.\n\nInstead of four outfielders, one of which was played shallow, players helped their defense by moving up closer to the infield. Making the gap between second and third base shorter. Thus, \u201cshort\u201d. The \u201cstop\u201d part of the positions name is from that spot being the \u201cstop\u201d of the gap between second and third base.\n\nAnother major role in the development of the shortstop position is it being the cutoff or relay from the outfielders to the infielders, pitcher, and catcher. The baseball used to weight much less than it does today, making it very difficult for outfielders to throw it all the way to the infield. The shortstop became extremely valuable because they became the relay or cutoff point between the outfield and infield.\n\nThe creation of the shortstop position which evolved from a shallow outfield position help revolutionize one of the most important and exciting positions in baseball.\n\nIs shortstop the hardest position?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say shortstop is the hardest position in baseball. Besides outfield, each position is so different than the rest.\n\nA pitcher has a hard position because the entire game starts with them on each pitch. Mental aspects and perseverance are involved in pitching. A catcher has a tough position because of the physical and mental demands. A catcher must stay in a crouch position all game while wearing heavy gear for protection along with being focused on every pitch.\n\nShortstop requires a lot of demands as well. The most important demand for shortstop is being one of the most athletic players on the field. Shortstop must be able to run quickly to the outfield to be the relay or cutoff. They also must cover the large gap in the infield between second and third base. A shortstop should also have a strong arm to throw across the infield. On top of that, with most players being right-handed hitters, the likelihood of balls being hit to shortstop is high, so they also must be a great infielder.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder why shortstop has evolved into one of the most important and popular positions. And why it\u2019s also known as the captain of the infield, even sometimes the captain of the team.\n\nOne of the best players of all time Derek Jeter has the nickname \u201cThe Captain\u201d. The nickname was given by owner George Steinbrenner for being the captain of the Yankees as their shortstop. Many players grew up wanting to be Derek Jeter, and if you watch today\u2019s game, some of the most athletic and best players in baseball play shortstop.\n\nESPN has announced the making of a multi-part documentary series called \u201cThe Captain\u201d featuring Derek Jeter. Be sure to watch when it\u2019s released!\n\nWhy is shortstop 6 and not 5?\n\nGoing back to the earliest days of baseball when there wasn\u2019t a shortstop and there were 4 outfielders, each position already had numbers associated. 1 pitcher, 2 catcher, 3 first base, 4 second base, 5 third base, 6,7,8,9 all for outfielders going from left to right.\n\nHowever, when players decided to stop the large gap between second and third base and to also help outfielders throw the ball to the infield, it made sense to use 6 for shortstop since 1-5 were already for the infield players and 6-10 were for outfield. Use 6 since it\u2019s the lowest outfield number and made sense just to add it to the infielders.\n\nPosition number 5 is already occupied and used for the third base position. Some people think shortstop should be 5 and third base be 6. If you go \u201caround the horn\u201d from first base to second base to third base, you will run into shortstop before reaching third base. That\u2019s why some think it should be 5 instead of 6.\n\nI disagree and think it makes perfect sense as 6 because it\u2019s the last infielder before the outfielders.\n\nWhat is the most important position in baseball?\n\nJust like what is the hardest position in baseball being subjective, so is the question of the most important position.\n\nEach position is important in its own way and each plays an important part in every baseball game. (Sometimes in lower levels right field is kind of known as the spot you put your worst defender).\n\nBoth pitcher and catcher are obviously extremely important because they get everything started. They\u2019re the ones dealing with batters. The pitcher must throw to a catcher while trying to get a batter out. The catcher must catch it and be good enough to handle catching duties. A bad pitcher and bad catcher can ruin a game.\n\nFirst base is important because someone is needed to catch the ball from the infielders after a ball is hit in play. Outfielders are all important because of balls hit beyond the infield. You wouldn\u2019t want infielders having to run those balls down in the outfield and you wouldn\u2019t want fly balls to land on the ground simply because someone wasn\u2019t there.\n\nBut then there\u2019s shortstop, which is extremely important and arguably the most important. I would say the shortstop position is the most important position outside of pitcher and catcher. First base and centerfield come close.\n\nShortstop is so important because of all the things they must do and cover during a game. They must defend the gap between second and third. Be a relay from the outfield. And be extremely athletic, alert, and smart to handle all of that. Therefore, many are known as the captains of the infield and team.\n\nLook at some incredibly athletic plays from today\u2019s best shortstops:\n\nFinal Word\n\nWe\u2019ve covered the earliest days of baseball and where the term shortstop came from. It really is quite fascinating that baseball started out without a shortstop and instead had four outfielders. It wouldn\u2019t take long for players to realize that four outfielders and three infielders was a disadvantage. Especially with the abundance of right-handed hitters and the increased odds of balls being hit to the left side of the infield.\n\nIt\u2019s also interesting how the position developed and evolved from a shallow outfielder who was there to defend the shallow balls hit to the outfield and to also be the relay person between the outfielders throws to the infield. This is where the term \u201cstop\u201d came from in \u201cshortstop\u201d because the ball stops between the outfield and infield. \u201cShort\u201d is from being the shallow or \u201cshort\u201d outfielder. And both \u201cshort\u201d and \u201cstop\u201d are for also covering the huge gap between second and third base.\n\nI truly can\u2019t imagine the game of baseball being played the way it was in the very beginning without a shortstop. The position makes perfect sense.\n\nThankfully it revolutionized the position, the entire infield, and in many ways, the entire game of baseball. Some of the best players and most exciting athletes in baseball of all time are and were shortstops. It\u2019s a very exciting position with a lot of exciting plays.\n\nOther Popular Articles:\n\nDoes Baseball have Overtime?\n\nHow many fouls can you get in baseball?\n\nWhat is a balk in baseball?\n\nHow many baseball games in a season?\n\nWhat is WHIP in baseball?"}, {"url": "https://answer-all.com/language/why-is-it-called-shortstop/", "page_content": "Why is it called shortstop?\n\nThe shortstop position is between the second base and the third baseman.

More hit balls go to the shortstop than to any other position, as there are more right-handed hitters in baseball than left-handed hitters, and most hitters have a tendency to pull the ball slightly."}, {"url": "https://gethypedsports.com/why-is-it-called-a-shortstop-in-baseball/", "page_content": "The shortstop position in baseball is different from every other position on the field. It\u2019s one of the most important positions it often sees the most baseballs in a regular game. Its name is also unique as it differs from the other positions on the field.\n\nThe shortstop position is between the second base and the third baseman. Its name comes from where it\u2019s located, as it requires the player to stop the short side of the field and act as a cutoff for the left and center fielders.\n\nAlso seen on box scores and graphics, the shortstop position is labeled SS. Where did the name shortstop come from, and why is it a critical position on the field.\n\nWhy It\u2019s Called a Shortstop In Baseball\n\nIn short, a player by the name of Doc Adams created the position. He played for the New York Knickerbockers in 1859. Traditionally, 8 players would play on the baseball field, one player at each base, three outfielders, and a pitcher/catcher.\n\nDue to the high number of right-handed hitters ( even today\u2019s game), the large gap between third and second base was massive. Doc Adams decided to vacate his outfield and move closer to what we know as the shortstop position.\n\nDoc\u2019s job as the shortstop was to be the short-side of the field, protecting the large gap between the 3rd and 2nd. It then evolved to shortstop, as he would no longer act as a cutoff man but as a stop to the short side of the field.\n\nWhen Doc Adam\u2019s playing days, the baseball weighed almost half of what it does now. Meaning players in the outfield could not reach a base or even getting the ball back to the pitcher.\n\nThis is the main reason why the shortstop position became so valuable.\n\nDoc remained with the Knickerbockers until 1860, where he helped invent and revolutionize one of the most prolific positions in baseball.\n\nWhat A Shortstop Does In Baseball\n\nA shortstop is one of the most important positions on the field. As mentioned, most baseballs are hit to the shortstop position. This requires the shortstop to be the best glove on the field, as they\u2019ll see the most action.\n\nShortstop requires a talented glove, the ability to turn double plays, and last act as the cutoff man between the center and left fielder.\n\nBelieve it or not, the scores of baseball games looked like American football scores. Often teams would score 20+ runs due to the massive gaps in the field. The addition of the shortstop eliminated the large gaps on the left side of the field and brought the score down dramatically.\n\nThis position now gave teams a chance at getting outs, which dropped the scoring rate.\n\nIn addition to fielding ground balls, the shortstop position must catch fly balls and turn double plays from the second baseman and other infielders.\n\nExamples of a shortstop in the MLB would be Xander Bogaerts, Javier Baez, and Francisco Lindor.\n\nWhy Is The Shortstop Position Numbered 6 and Not 5?\n\nWhen looking at a box score, or a graphic about baseball positions, you may see that shortstop is numbered 6. This doesn\u2019t make sense to the normal counting eye, as each base position is numbered from right to left, but the 3rd base is numbered 5 and shortstop 6.\n\nThe shortstop position was not invented until after all the positions had already been created. Adding this extra position essentially added a new number to the infield.\n\nInstead of renumbering all positions, it was easier to call the shortstop 6 and leave all base positions as normal.\n\nRenumbering of the outfield took place once 9 players were added to the field to finalize all of the personnel on the field.\n\nWhy The Shortstop Position Is The Hardest\n\nShortstop is one of the hardest infield positions to play because most balls are hit toward the shortstop.\n\nShortstops are oftentimes the most athletic player on the field, along with the best glove for fielding ground balls. In baseball, a high majority of hitters are right-handed, which means they\u2019re more likely to pull the ball to the left side of the diamond toward the shortstop.\n\nThe third baseman has to protect the foul line, meaning the shortstop has to range further to his left and his right. Chasing balls in each direction forces the player to throw in difficult such as backhand and forehand.\n\nThe shortstop can often be seen getting the ball on the run, having to flip his hips back around and throw the ball sidearm.\n\nShortstops are not doing this for fun; they\u2019re doing it because it\u2019s the only way they can generate enough velocity behind the baseball to throw the runner out.\n\nThe same kind of throwing style can be seen by shortstops who are fielding a backhand. We can often see the shortstop backhand the baseball, jump in the air, and throw the baseball.\n\nIt would take a half-second longer if the shortstop stopped, planted his foot, then threw the ball all the way across the diamond.\n\nHere are a few off-handed and off-balanced throws from shortstops.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to play the shortstop position, we recommend working on ground balls from both the right and left sides. Practice throwing from awkward angles and fielding softly/hard-hit ground balls.\n\nThe shortstop skill set requires quick lateral movement and precise accuracy when throwing to first.\n\nSee Our Complete List Of Helpful Baseball Articles Here\n\nCan A Lefty Play Shortstop?\n\nDue to the fact, the shortstop is on the left side of the diamond, shortstops are typically right-handed throwers. As a right-handed thrower would be able to scoop the baseball and make an immediate throw, a left-handed shortstop would have to gather the baseball, turn their entire body, then throw the baseball.\n\nDue to this long sequence makes more sense for lefties to play either first base or the outfield. Baseball ground ball outs can be determined by the matter of inches, every second count when fielding, gathering the feet, and throwing the ball across the diamond.\n\nConclusion\n\nShortstops have been added to baseball to help fill the gap between the second and third baseman. The high volume of right-handed hitters often hit the ball between the 2nd and 3rd base hole. This is what led to the creation of the shortstop.\n\nBefore the shortstop, baseball scores looked like football scores, and the innings dragged on. The shortstop allowed the second baseman to play in the gap between second and first, helping the defense be more efficient on the right side of the diamond as well.\n\nThe shortstop position has changed baseball for the better and will continue to provide the top 10 highlights throughout the entire baseball season."}, {"url": "https://thesporting.blog/blog/baseballs-greatest-outfield", "page_content": "Hamilton and Delahanty were even faster than Thompson, whose long legs covered plenty of acreage. All had strong, accurate arms.\n\nIn center field between two six-footers, Hamilton was like a gazelle flanked by a pair of giraffes.\n\nHe was built like Hack Wilson \u2013 5\u20196 and stocky, but at 165 he was 25 pounds under Wilson\u2019s best playing weight. Billy took a chance on catching everything that stayed in the park, often getting a near-miss glove on drives that other fielders would not attempt to catch.\n\nHe stood facing the left fielder, his hands behind him and head turned watching the batter over his left shoulder.\n\nAt the crack of the bat, he took off and pulled down long drives at impossible angles and positions, often doubling off unbelieving base runners. Sprawling snatches of line drives were routine.\n\nSam Thompson is credited with perfecting the one-bounce throw from right field to home plate. In 1894 he went 50 games without muffing a fly ball, a feat in those days of palm-sized gloves. He made seven errors in 1896, when the average game saw five or six misplays.\n\nIn 1897 he was forced to break in a new glove when the old one wore out after nine years.\n\nDelahanty\u2019s work in the field was overshadowed by his slugging, as Babe Ruth\u2019s would be 30 years later. Del had a strong, accurate arm, got the ball away as fast as anybody in the league, and made his share of game-saving catches.\n\nDespite their super outfield, the Phillies could finish no higher than third during this span. In 1893 they were first or second until August, when injuries knocked them out of the race.\n\nThompson\u2019s last full season was 1896. A bad back kept him out of all but a few games in the next two years. He retired to Detroit, where he was an active advisor to Tigers front office magnate Frank Navin, became deputy U. S. Marshal and a court bailiff, and played amateur ball.\n\nIn September 1906 a series of injuries left the Tigers shorthanded, and the 46-year-old Thompson was pressed into service for eight games.\n\nTaking his time at the start of an inning, he would stand on the right field foul line adjusting his new-fangled sun-glasses, One day, the pitcher threw and the batter hit a line drive down the line where Sam was still fiddling with the glasses.

Never did he expect the Astros would have him play more shortstop than center field, which is the message Storey relayed late in spring training, maybe less than a week before major league camp broke.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStraw\u2019s initial surprise even led Storey to circle back a day later to assure him he was serious. Every morning for the rest of that final week in West Palm Beach, Fla., Straw met Astros bench coach Joe Espada and first base coach Don Kelly on a back field for 30 minutes of individual instruction at his new position.\n\n\u201cIt was a little shocking,\u201d Straw said. \u201cI definitely get where they\u2019re coming from, especially with the depth we have in the outfield. It makes me more valuable as a player, so I\u2019m for it. If it\u2019s going to help me develop, get me to where I need to be, I\u2019m willing to do anything.\u201d\n\nThe Astros constantly seek to add value wherever possible, and playing one of their best outfielder prospects at shortstop is the latest example. It is highly unusual to move a player with plus tools at a premium position to another premium position at which he has no meaningful experience. Yet the Astros genuinely believe Straw\u2019s skills are applicable at shortstop.\n\nAdditionally, playing Straw at shortstop alleviates their roster crunch in Triple A. The Round Rock Express are loaded with outfielders. Aside from Straw, there is Kyle Tucker, Derek Fisher, Yordan Alvarez and Drew Ferguson. Taylor Jones, while primarily a first baseman, also dabbles in left field. Only one of these players can DH on a given day. At-bats are at a premium.\n\nAnd so Straw will garner most of his at-bats as a shortstop, at least for now. The plan is for him to start at shortstop roughly four times a week and center field in the other three. Through Thursday night, Round Rock has played eight games. Straw has played shortstop in four and center field in four.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just going to be a fun gimmick,\u201d Astros president of baseball operations Jeff Luhnow said. \u201cWe want him to play and see how it goes.\u201d\n\nStraw, who debuted for the Astros in September and made their ALDS roster as a pinch-runner, is the best defensive outfielder in the team\u2019s minor league system. The 24-year-old Florida JUCO product is one of the fastest players in affiliated baseball, and his range combined with his strong arm have him ready to play center field in the majors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis right-handed bat has not yet proven to be major league ready, though, and the Astros already have a defense-first reserve outfielder in Jake Marisnick. As long as Marisnick remains an Astro, Straw faces an uphill battle to crack the roster, save for reprising his role as a pinch-running specialist in September and October.\n\nYet playing time at shortstop in Houston isn\u2019t exactly available either, which is what makes this Straw-at-shortstop experiment somewhat curious. Even if it works out, when would Straw reasonably garner playing time at the position on a roster that features stars Carlos Correa and Alex Bregman?\n\nFor the Astros, it all comes back to potentially increasing Straw\u2019s value and enhancing his chances at factoring into the team\u2019s plans longterm, even if only in a bench role.\n\n\u201cWe know Myles can play all three outfield positions,\u201d Luhnow said. \u201cIf he can play infield as well, we\u2019ve seen what kind of value a multi-faceted player can add.\u201d\n\nThe Astros flirted with this project last season, when they faced the same glut of outfielders in Triple A-Fresno. Last July 5, Straw made his professional debut at shortstop for the final four innings of Fresno\u2019s game against Las Vegas. But that was it. It didn\u2019t go any further.\n\nBefore those four innings, Straw hadn\u2019t played shortstop in a game since his senior year at Braden River High in Bradenton, Fla. And even in high school he spent a majority of his time in the outfield.\n\nStraw can exceed 90 mph with his arm, but throwing is the biggest challenge he faces in his new life as a shortstop. From the outfield, he rears back and uncorks throws from an over-the-top arm slot. He might make one important throw a game, but gunning down a runner is probably his favorite aspect of being an outfielder, he said.\n\nAs a shortstop, Straw can\u2019t afford to have as long a throwing motion. He needs to shorten up and get rid of the ball quickly. That isn\u2019t easy to do, especially when alternating between the infield and the outfield on a near-daily basis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a much quicker tempo to the game,\u201d Straw said of playing shortstop. \u201cYou\u2019re on a clock. There\u2019s no hiding from that.\u201d\n\nAt shortstop, Straw has dropped down to throw from more of a three-quarters to sidearm motion. He\u2019s made one error so far, on a high throw to the first baseman Jones, who is 6-foot-7. He\u2019s more comfortable making throws on the run on slow rollers. In general, he\u2019s found the less time he has to think, the easier it is to make the throw. Lobbing a short throw while playing on the other side of second base in the shift is foreign to him.\n\nReacting quickly to the harder-hit balls and fielding ground balls hasn\u2019t been an issue, though four games is a minuscule sample. Straw works at shortstop before games, even on days he\u2019s starting in center field, and often requests Storey hit him additional grounders. Round Rock\u2019s more experienced shortstops, Alex De Goti and Jack Mayfield, offer advice.\n\nStraw said he\u2019s enjoyed having teammates to converse with in the infield as opposed to the more lonely existence in the outfield. But his shortstop etiquette is apparently still a work in progress. Manning short during an exhibition game Round Rock played against Double-A Corpus Christi before the season, Straw learned the hard way that infielders aren\u2019t supposed to talk to their pitcher when he\u2019s pitching.\n\nAkeem Bostick was on the mound that game, and Bostick is a talkative guy with a propensity for unique sayings like, \u201cI\u2019m going to get in my bag.\u201d In the middle of an inning Straw quipped, \u201cGet in your bag, Akeem.\u201d On the next pitch, Bostick gave up a run-scoring single.\n\nOver at third base, Nick Tanielu started laughing. \u201cBro, you can\u2019t do that,\u201d Tanielu told Straw.\n\nEvery day at shortstop is a learning experience for Straw, who said his time at the new position hasn\u2019t impacted his outfield play. It\u2019s uncertain exactly how much longer he will play shortstop before the Astros decide whether to proceed. But at some point in the near future, they will gauge whether the experiment is worth continuing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStraw doesn\u2019t lack for confidence, as demonstrated by his stated goal of stealing 100 bases this season. And despite his initial surprise about how much shortstop he\u2019d be playing in Triple A this year, he thinks he can pull it off.\n\n\u201cI think I can do anything in this game,\u201d he said. \u201cI like to think I\u2019m super confident when I\u2019m out on the field, whether I\u2019m hitting, fielding, whatever it may be. I\u2019m definitely looking forward to seeing where it goes. If it works out, it does. If it doesn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m still going to be a good outfielder. Either way, I\u2019m just taking it a day at a time and having fun with it.\u201d\n\n(Top photo: Julia Price/Round Rock Express)"}, {"url": "https://jaysfromthecouch.com/2021/07/20/toronto-blue-jays-defence-and-baserunning-a-mid-season-review/", "page_content": "The Toronto Blue Jays passed the mid-point of the 2021 season. How has their defence and baserunning performed compared to their American League opponents? What, if anything, can Management do to address defensive and baserunning performance issues?\n\nFeatured Image Courtesy Of DaveMe Images. Prints Available For Purchase\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Blue Jays find themselves in the hunt for a 2021 playoff spot. In previous articles, I analyzed Toronto\u2019s pitching and hitting thus far in 2021. Turning to both the Blue Jays defence and baserunning, these game elements have been relatively poor this season. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nDefence\n\nDefensive Metrics\n\nI used the following metrics to measure defensive performance: Def, DRS (\u201cDefensive Runs Saved\u201d) and Outs Above Average (\u201cOAA\u201d). For those who want a Def, DRS and OAA refresher, FanGraphs and Statcast are the websites to visit.\n\nBecause of high-speed cameras and data regarding infielders, batters and baserunners, OAA is more precise and rigorous than DRS. Accordingly, I place much more weight on OAA than DRS when evaluating an infielder\u2019s defensive play, but I use both metrics. If pressed, I would favour OAA over DRS in an 80:20 split.\n\nOAA is a more accurate measure of an outfielder\u2019s range and probability of making catches than DRS for outfielders. However, DRS has value because it also includes assessing an outfielder\u2019s performance in throwing and cutting off balls that limit base runners from advancing beyond their current station. Therefore, analysts should utilize both OAA and DRS to evaluate an outfielder\u2019s defensive performance. However, I would still lean more towards OAA because of its inherent relative accuracy compared to DRS. Perhaps a 65:35 weight.\n\nDefence Summary\n\nThe Blue Jays are a relatively poor defensive team. As a group, Blue Jays infielders have produced a -9 OAA, which ranks 12th among American League teams. The sad tale continues: Toronto\u2019s outfielders are 14th among American League clubs due to their -11 OAA. Tampa, who the Blue Jays are chasing for a wildcard spot, has the best infield and outfield in the American League. Boston\u2019s outfield slots in at #6; their infield is #14. The Yankees infield is 9th best; their outfield is lucky #13.\n\nTable 1 summarizes Toronto\u2019s defensive numbers by position.\n\nTable 2 provides a summary of the defensive rankings for the Blue Jays infield and outfield defenders.\n\nThe Blue Jays have received average or better defence from the catcher position (Danny Jansen and Reese McGuire, each with DRS scores above zero), first base (Vlad Guerrero Jr. \u2013 0 OAA) and the pitchers (as a group). Marcus Semien has been the best defensively among American League second basemen in OAA, Def and DRS.\n\nFive positions require more in-depth analysis: shortstop, third base, and the three outfield posts.\n\nShortstop\n\nThe tables presented provide evidence that the defence from Toronto\u2019s shortstop position has been below average. If you remove Semien\u2019s DRS contribution when he has played shortstop for the Blue Jays, the DRS from Bo Bichette is below-average. Bichette\u2019s -7 OAA ranks 32nd of 36 MLB shortstops.\n\nThird Base\n\nThe data included in Table 1 and Table 2 demonstrate that, collectively, the Blue Jays\u2019 third basemen have been well below-average defensively in 2021. In the good news department, Santiago Espinal\u2019s numbers have been more than acceptable. In limited opportunities (255 innings), he produced a +1 OAA and a +4 DRS. Joe Panik recorded a -6 DRS and a -5 OAA at third; Cavan Biggio has been below-average at third base, as evidenced by his -3 DRS and -5 OAA. In terms of OAA, Toronto\u2019s third basemen rank 27th among MLB teams.\n\nLeft Field\n\nToronto\u2019s left-field contingent, led primarily by Lourdes Gurriel Jr., ranks 11th in OAA in the American League. Gurriel Jr. has a +3 DRS, which is mainly attributable to his arm. However, his range is limited, and his reads are lacking, which results in fewer outs on catchable balls.\n\nGurriel Jr.\u2019s OAA is minus eight, which ranks last among the 38 MLB left fielders. He is a below-average left fielder. Yes, he has a cannon for an arm. Still, too many catchable balls become base hits.\n\nCenterfield\n\nThe data included in Table 1 and Table 2 demonstrate that Toronto\u2019s centerfielders have lagged their American League counterparts. Blue Jay centerfielders have been better than the average outfielder (+1 OAA). However, other American League centerfielders have posted higher OAA marks. Concerning OAA at the player level, the centerfield scores are as follows: Randal Grichuk with a 0 OAA, and Jonathan Davis and George Springer have each posted a +1 OAA. In terms of DRS, Grichuk is minus two and Davis and Springer are minus one.\n\nToronto\u2019s centerfield defence is not a significant concern because they have produced scores that are a tick better than the average outfielder. Also, Springer has been a better-than-average defender in centerfield in his career. He will likely be the primary Blue Jays centerfielder for the balance of the 2021 campaign.\n\nRight Field\n\nThe OAA figures presented in Table 1 and Table 2 suggest that right field should be a concern for the Blue Jays. Toronto has deployed three players in right field in 2021: Grichuk (0 OAA), Teoscar Hernandez (\u20133 OAA and Biggio (-3 OAA). The DRS data paints a more cheerful picture: Grichuk \u2013 +3; Hernandez \u2013 +1; and Biggio +1.\n\nSuppose one assumes that Springer will be the primary centerfielder for the remainder of this season. In that case, Grichuk is likely to see his playing time as a right fielder increase, which should produce better defensive results for the Blue Jays.\n\nWith a Grichuk move to right field, Hernandez should see more time in left field. In a limited number of innings (135), he has generated a +1 OAA and a -1 DRS in left field. Hernandez would be a defensive upgrade over Gurriel Jr.\n\nBaserunning\n\nFanGraphs publishes the BsR metric, which is a measure of a player\u2019s baserunning performance. There are three components to BsR:\n\nWeighted Stolen Bases (wSB) estimates the number of runs above or below average a player contributes to his team by stealing bases and being thrown out.\n\nUltimate Base Running (UBR) pertains to the baserunner\u2019s performance in advancing or not advancing while on base.\n\nWeighted Ground into Double Play Runs (wGDP) measures the extra outs a player costs his team (or saves) by hitting into more double plays (or fewer) than average given his opportunities.\n\nTable 3 contains base running data for the Blue Jays.\n\nConcerning wSB and UBR, the Blue Jays are median in each metric among American League teams. The Blue Jays have 41 stolen bases. Their success rate is 76%; the American League Average is 40 stolen bases and a 76% success rate. The wSB figure is consistent with the stolen base data found at Baseball-Reference. Baseball-Reference does not have a metric comparable to UBR. If you combined the wSB and UBR scores, the Blue Jays rank ninth among American League teams in wSB+UBR.\n\nToronto ranks twelfth in wGDP: they ground into a relatively high number of double plays. Baseball-Reference\u2019s data is consistent with the wGDP figure. Toronto has the tenth highest GDP rate (11.0%); the American League average is 10.3%. The Yankees have the highest GDP rate (12.8%), Boston is fifth (9.5%), and Tampa has the lowest GDP rate (6.0%).\n\nBlue Jays\u2019 baserunning has been relatively poor so far this season. Although their BsR score (-4.1) is better than New York\u2019s (-12), Toronto trails Boston (-1.2) and Tampa (+7.8).\n\nConclusion\n\nLeaving aside pitching and hitting, Toronto is a flawed team. From a defensive standpoint, the Blue Jays rank near the bottom in the American League. The Blue Jays are a little better, relatively speaking, in terms of baserunning, but they are below average. Tampa, the American League East team ahead of them in the wildcard race, is the American League\u2019s best for defence and baserunning. Accordingly, unless the defence and base running improve, the Blue Jays must excel at pitching and hitting if they hope to secure a playoff spot.\n\nWhat should the Blue Jays do?\n\nConcerning baserunning, Toronto can improve by being more alert on the base paths and having a better approach when the risk of grounding into a double play is present.\n\nManagement needs to address the defence immediately. I have summarized my views by position as follows:\n\nCatcher, first base and second base are fine.\n\nShortstop is a weakness that Management cannot tackle this season. Although a Semien-Bichette position switch is an option, my opinion is that it is too late into the season to contemplate seriously.\n\nFrom a defensive perspective, Espinal is the best in-house, third-base option for the Blue Jays.\n\nSpringer, Grichuk, and Hernandez should play centerfield, right field and left field, respectively. Corey Dickerson, a tick above-average defensively in left field, could also see some playing time in left.\n\nThere are players outside of the Toronto organization that Management could consider acquiring. That is a topic for another day.\n\nThe last word\n\nThe Blue Jays are a flawed baseball club. Their hitting has been top-tier, albeit somewhat unbalanced in terms of batting-order length. The starting rotation has stabilized recently, and additions to the bullpen have helped the cause. However, Toronto is well below-average defensively. Shortstop, third base and the outfield have underperformed compared to their American League rivals. Another team weakness is baserunning: Toronto is below-average on the base paths. The combination of poor defence and baserunning reduces the Blue Jays\u2019 chances of securing a spot in the postseason. Management should take action to address these areas of underperformance.\n\n*Featured Image Courtesy Of DaveMe Images.
