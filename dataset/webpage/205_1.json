{"Hephaestion was 'by far the dearest of all the king's friends; he had been brought up with Alexander and shared all his secrets.'": [{"url": "https://www.worldhistory.org/Hephaestion/", "page_content": "Hephaestion was a member of Alexander the Great's personal bodyguard and the Macedonian king's closest and lifelong friend and advisor. So much so, Hephaestion's death would bring the young king to tears. From 334 to 323 BCE Alexander the Great conquered much of the known world. He led his army on a ten-year odyssey across Asia Minor and into Persia, Egypt and India. Eventually, after his defeat of Darius III, he became the self-proclaimed King of Asia. Of course, he could not have done this without the support of his loyal army and staff of skilled officers \u2013 Ptolemy I, Perdiccas, and Craterus, but above all others, Hephaestion.\n\nEarly Life\n\nThe son of Amyntas, Hephaestion was raised in the Macedonian capital of Pella and according to most sources born in 356 BCE, the same year as the king. Being from an aristocratic family, as were many of the staff officers who would follow Alexander into Asia, he became a student, alongside Alexander, of the philosopher Aristotle at Mieza, a city west of Pella. His intelligence impressed the Athenian academic, and, like the king, they would correspond with each other during the long Persian campaign.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nHephaestion was Alexander's closest & most loyal companion throughout the great king's military campaigns.\n\nHephaestion was considered handsome by many, and Alexander's father, Philip II of Macedon, regarded him as an excellent influence on his son. Shortly after Philip married Cleopatra, the future king became concerned about his position as successor. A disagreement erupted between Philip and Alexander, a dispute fueled by his friends. Because of this, many of Alexander's friends were sent into exile; however, because of Philip's respect for Hephaestion, he was spared this humiliation.\n\nOn Campaign\n\nIn 334 BCE, after regaining the loyalties of many of the Greek city-states \u2013 especially following the razing of Thebes \u2013 Alexander and his army crossed the Hellespont on the first leg of their conquest of Persia. However, before clashing with the Persian army at River Granicus, Alexander chose to visit the tomb of his hero (and supposed ancestor) Achilles at Troy (a small village at the time of Alexander). Such was his fascination with the hero, the king always slept with a copy of Homer's Iliad under his pillow. With him at Troy, of course, was, among others, Hephaestion who laid a wreath at the tomb of Achilles' friend Patroclus. Indeed, many saw the relationship of Alexander and Hephaestion to be akin to that of Achilles and Patroclus. Later, the two men stood side-by-side as Alexander severed the Gordian Knot. Because of this unique closeness, many officers grew extremely jealous. Oddly enough, this jealousy was not limited to the staff for Olympias, Alexander's overly-protective mother, also resented the relationship.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nHephaestion's friendship with Alexander would eventually enable him to be appointed chiliarch or second-in-command. Although there is considerable disagreement among contemporary sources, many within the army did not believe Hephaestion to have the necessary leadership or military skills; in fact, some fail to mention any active participation in several of the major battles (although he was seriously wounded at the Battle of Gaugamela); however, luckily for Alexander, he demonstrated a talent for organization. Alexander would leave much of the campaign's logistics to Hephaestion \u2013 the supply and transportation of equipment, bridge building and even the establishment and planning of new settlements.\n\nAlexander the Great (Facial Reconstruction) Arienne King (CC BY-NC-SA)\n\nRivalry & Special Position\n\nOne officer, Craterus, grew to deeply resent Hephaestion (the feeling was mutual), and Alexander had to separate the two on more than one occasion. At one point in India, they had actually drawn swords. Alexander was forced to reprimand them both, scolding Hephaestion and telling him he would be nothing without Alexander. (Historians disagree on the meaning of this statement.) It was often said that Craterus was a friend of the king, but Hephaestion was a friend of Alexander. In his Greek Lives historian Plutarch wrote:\n\nLove History? Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter!\n\n\u2026 he (Alexander) loved Hephaestion best, but respected Craterus most, he was constantly saying that in his opinion while Hephaestion was loyal to Alexander, Craterus was loyal to the king. This helps to explain why there was bad feeling festering between the two of them, so that they often clashed.\n\nLater, Plutarch said that the king brought the two together and made them friends again but gave each a warning \u2013 he would kill both of them if he ever found them quarrelling again. In the end, Craterus would return to Macedonia, eventually dying in 321 BCE during the Wars of the Diadochi after Alexander's death.\n\nThis intimate relationship between Hephaestion and Alexander can also be seen in an incident after the Battle of Issus and the defeat of Darius III. The Persian king ran from the field of battle and escaped capture, leaving his army to suffer a devastating rout. Unfortunately for his mother, wife, and daughters, they were left behind along with abundant riches; Darius would eventually appeal unsuccessfully for their safe return. Realizing the fate of most prisoners of war, especially women, and expecting the worse, Darius' mother, Sisygambis, feared for their safety, and as Alexander and Hephaestion entered the tent, she threw herself before the taller and more handsome Hephaestion, begging for her life. In his The Campaigns of Alexander historian Arrian related the story.\n\n\u2026 Darius' mother, in doubt owing to the similarity of their dress, which of the two was the King, prostrated herself before Hephaestion because he was taller than his companion. Hephaestion stepped back, and one of the Queen's attendant's rectified her mistake by pointing to Alexander; the Queen withdrew in profound embarrassment, but Alexander merely remarked that her error was of no account, for Hephaestion, too, was an Alexander.\n\nArrian added that whether or not the incident was true, the young king should be admired for his respect and confidence in a friend \u2013 but it also speaks for the nature of Alexander's character.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nNaval Command\n\nAfter Issus, Hephaestion was placed in charge of Alexander's naval reinforcements, ordered to follow the army's progress along the Mediterranean coast from Gaza to the city Pelusium on the Egyptian delta \u2013 the latter's governor surrendered both the city and its entire treasury without a fight. In another test of Alexander's confidence in Hephaestion, the king placed him in charge of replacing the old, deposed Persian ruler of the newly seized port city of Sidon with another governor. A member of the old royal family Abdalorymus was quickly found and given the governorship. Next, Hephaestion led the fleet up the Nile River to the Egyptian capital of Memphis where he, Ptolemy, Craterus and Alexander studied Egyptian law and customs. Prior to the final battle against Darius at Gaugamela, Alexander placed Hephaestion in charge of a squadron to scout the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers and build a bridge. Wisely, he did not complete the bridge until the arrival of Alexander, fearing that the Persians would destroy it. Aside from the mention of his wound received, sources do not mention Hephaestion again until the conspiracy trial of Philotas.\n\nCities Named Alexandria by Alexander the Great Simeon Netchev (CC BY-NC-SA)\n\nLoyalty to Alexander\n\nBefore marching into India and prior to their expedition into Bactria, there was major unrest within the army. The veterans were weary and wanted to return home to Macedonia and their families. Also, many staff officers disagreed with the king on many of his atypical decisions \u2013 his adoption of Persian customs and attire as well as his wish that they prostrate themselves before him and kiss his ring. They especially resented both the addition of Persians into the army and being asked to take Persian wives. However, unlike many others, Hephaestion always supported Alexander's decisions even with the idea of taking a Persian wife and he was given one of the daughters of Darius, Drypatis, while Alexander chose the other daughter, Barsine, as his mistress.\n\nHowever, Hephaestion's loyalty to Alexander was best demonstrated during the would-be mutiny against Alexander. In 330 BCE Hephaestion, along with Craterus, spoke against Philotas, the suspected ringleader of the plot, convincing the king that he and the other conspirators should be tortured and executed - this execution also included Parmenio, Philotas' father and the long-time commander from the court of Philip. Afterwards, Alexander rewarded Hephaestion by splitting the command of the Companions between him and Cleitus.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nPortraits of Alexander and a Youth (Hephaestion?) Caroline Cervera (CC BY-NC-SA)\n\nDuring the campaign in India, Hephaestion led a large force through the Khyber Pass subduing any rebellious Indian tribes. Next, Perdiccas and he took half the Companions, the mercenary cavalry, the baggage train and several Indian engineers to build a bridge across the Indus (this same bridge would be used to ford the Hydaspes). When lines of communication were secured, they rejoined Alexander and prepared to cross the Indus and face King Porus \u2013 at the Hydaspes Hephaestion would be placed in command of one squadron. After the victory against Porus, Hephaestion split with Alexander reconnecting later and battling against the Mallians \u2013 it was here that Alexander was injured and near death. Finally, he could go no farther; Alexander succumbed to the wishes of his troops and decided to return northward to Babylon.\n\nDeath\n\nThey spent the summer and fall at Ecbatana where, after a night of heavy drinking, Hephaestion developed a high fever \u2013 Alexander would remain by his friend's side until he showed signs of recovery. Unfortunately, Hephaestion soon relapsed, and in October of 324 BCE, he died (any possibility of poisoning has been dismissed). Alexander would die himself eight months later. The king spent the next two days in tears, grieving for the death of his friend. Besides cutting off his own hair, he ordered the manes and tails of all the horses cut off as well. A state of mourning was declared, sacrifices were made, and sacred fires were lit. Unfortunately, it was a sad day for Hephaestion's doctor, Glaucius, who was executed for his failure to keep his patient alive. Hephaestion's body would eventually be sent to Babylon where a giant pyre was built. Alexander sent an envoy to Siwa to request Hephaestion be declared a god, but the request was refused; he would only be honored as a divine hero. Plutarch wrote:\n\n\u2026he (Alexander) had the wretched doctor impaled on a stake and banned playing the pipes and all music in the camp for a considerable period of time, until he received an oracle from Ammon, telling him to worship Hephaestion as a hero and to institute sacrificial rituals in his honour.\n\nAlthough some sources claim that Hephaestion and Alexander were more than just good friends, most agree that their relationship was unique and strengthened both men. Throughout his life, Hephaestion remained close to the king, serving both as a valuable advisor and friend. Whether or not he was a capable commander is irrelevant, his abilities in logistics assisted in the defeat of the Persians and their king Darius III."}, {"url": "https://ancient-literature.com/alexander-and-hephaestion/", "page_content": "Alexander and Hephaestion are the best of friends and allegedly lovers. Their relationship has been a topic of debate among historians and philosophers. However, the issue attached to them has no credible evidence linking the two romantically or sexually.\n\nLet us discuss and learn more information about the story behind their greatness and know the real score when it comes to their relationship.\n\nWho Are Alexander and Hephaestion?\n\nAlexander and Hephaestion are king and army general, as Alexander was the king of the Macedonian kingdom since the age of 20, and Hephaestion was the general of the army. They worked and shared an amazing friendship together, and later, Hephaestion married Alexander\u2019s sister.\n\nAlexander and Hephaestion\u2019s Early Life\n\nAlexander III was the son and successor of his father and the king of Macedon, Philip II, and his mother was Olympias, the fourth of eight wives of King Philip II and daughter of the King of Epirus, Neoptolemus I. Alexander III was born in the capital of the Kingdom of Macedon.\n\nHowever, Hephaestion\u2019s exact age was unknown, as there was no written biography about him. Many scholars assumed that he was born in 356 BC, the same age as Alexander. The only surviving narrative of him was from the Alexander Romance. A tale saying that Alexander was sailing with Hephaestion at the age of 15 became another clue about Hephaestion, showing that they are in the same age bracket and attending lectures together at Meiza under Aristotle\u2019s tutelage.\n\nAlthough the letters no longer exist today, Hephaestion\u2019s name was found in the catalog of Aristotle\u2019s correspondence, which implies that their content must have been significant and that Aristotle himself was so impressed by his pupil that he sent letters to converse with him while Alexander\u2019s Empire was expanding.\n\nVarious accounts show that since their early life, Alexander and Hephaestion knew each other and learned about philosophy, religion, logic, morals, medicine, and art under the supervision of Aristotle in Mieza at the Temple of Nymphs, which seems to have been their boarding school. They studied together with the children of Macedonian nobles like Ptolemy and Cassander, and some of these students became Alexander\u2019s future generals and \u201cCompanions\u201d with Hephaestion as their leader.\n\nAlexander and Hephaestion Youth\n\nIn their youth, Alexander got acquainted with some exiles at the Macedonian court because they were given protection by King Philip II as they opposed Artaxerxes III, which later on was said to be influenced some changes in the administration of the Macedonian state.\n\nOne of them was Artabazos II, together with his daughter Barsine, who then became Alexander\u2019s mistress; Amminapes, who became Alexander\u2019s satrap; and a nobleman from Persia known as Sisines, who shared with the Macedonian court a lot of knowledge about Persian issues. They resided at the Macedonian court from 352 to 342 BC.\n\nMeanwhile, Hephaestion served in the military service in his youth, even before Alexander the Great became a king. As a teen, he campaigned against the Thracians, sent in King Phillip II\u2019s Danube campaign in 342 BC and the battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC. He was also sent on some important diplomatic missions.\n\nAlexander and Hephaestion\u2019s early life prepared them to intelligently govern the kingdom and serve in the military, and as early as their youth, they bonded and became firm friends, which soon after developed into romance in their adulthood.\n\nAlexander and Hephaestion\u2019s Career Together\n\nIn all of Alexander\u2019s campaigns, there stood Hephaestion on his side. He was the second-in-command, most loyal, and the most trusted friend and general in the army of the king. Their bond became stronger as they went campaigning and battling against different countries and tasted the sweetness of success.\n\nWhen Alexander was 16, he rule in Pella as Regent while his father led an army against Byzantium. During that time, the neighboring country revolted, and Alexander was forced to react and led an army. He eventually defeated them, and to mark his victory, he founded the city of Alexandroupolis on the scene. That was just the first of his many victories.\n\nWhen King Philip came back, he and Alexander led their army through the Greek city-states, where they battled the combined forces of Thebes and Athens. King Philip led the army facing the Athenians, whereas Alexander with his Companions, headed by Hephaestion, took command of the troops against the Thebans. It is said that the Sacred Band, an elite Theban army composed of 150 male lovers, was killed.\n\nAlexander Became The King\n\nIn 336 BC, while attending his daughter\u2019s wedding, King Phillip was assassinated by Pausanias, the head of his own bodyguards and allegedly his ex-lover. Soon after, Alexander succeeded the throne of his father at the age of 20.\n\nThe news of the king\u2019s death reached the city-states they had conquered, all of which immediately revolted. Alexander reacted by taking the title \u201cSupreme Commander,\u201d same as his father, and intended to go to war with Persia. Before leading the campaign to Persian territory, Alexander secured the Macedonian borders by defeating and reasserting control over the Thracians, the Getae, the Illyrians, the Taulanti, the Triballi, the Athenians, and the Thebans. This was also the time when Alexander led the League of Corinth and used his authority to launch the Pan-Hellenic project predicted by his father.\n\nWithin two years of ascending the throne, he crossed the Hellespont with an army of almost 100,000 soldiers. He also detoured to Troy, the setting of Homer\u2019s Iliad, his favorite text since his youth under Aristotle\u2019s tutelage, where Arrian recounts that Alexander and Hephaestion laid a garland on the tomb of Achilles and Patroclus and ran naked to honor their dead heroes. This invited speculation that the two were lovers.\n\nBattles Together\n\nAfter a series of battles, the Macedonian Empire under Alexander\u2019s leadership conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety and overthrew Darius III, the king of Persia at Issos. Then, Alexander proceeded to conquer Egypt and Syria where he founded the city of Alexandria, his most successful city, and he was declared the son of the king of the Egyptian gods, Amun.\n\nAfter the battle of Issus, in 333 BC, it is said that Hephaestion was ordered and authorized to designate to the throne the Sidonian whom he considered most deserving to be appointed to that high office. Alexander also entrusted him to lead after the siege of Tyre in 332 BC.\n\nAt the battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC, Alexander caught Darius III in Mesopotamia and defeated his army, but Darius III again fled where he was killed by his own men. When Alexander\u2019s army found his body, he returned it to his mother, Sisygambis, to be buried in the royal tombs with his predecessors.\n\nDespite Alexander succeeding in numerous campaigns, and taking control of most of modern-day Greece, Egypt, Syria, the Balkans, Iran, and Iraq, he was still determined to reach the Ganges in India. However, his troops had been on the march for eight years, and they wanted to go home, this was all through the command of his best friend and general of the army, Hephaestion.\n\nFinally, Alexander accepted his defeat against his troops who refused to continue the campaign and decided to go to Susa. There, Alexander hosted a feast for his large army, accompanied by a mass marriage of his officers, including Hephaestion. Hephaestion married a Persian noblewoman, to be able to build bridges between their two empires.\n\nAlexander\u2019s Greif by Losing Hephaestion\n\nAfter the feast in Susa, Alexander left for Ectabana, and during that time, Hephaestion fell ill. He had a fever that lasted for seven days, but it was said that he would make a full recovery, allowing Alexander to leave his bedside and make an appearance at the games, which is happening in the city. While he was away, Hephaestion was said to have taken a sudden turn for the worse after eating a meal and died.\n\nAccording to some accounts, Hephaestion died of poisoning, as a motive to hurt the Great King, or the fever he suffered might have been typhoid and caused him to die from internal bleeding. He was cremated, and after which, his ashes were taken to Babylon and honored as a divine hero. The king referred to him as \u201cthe friend I valued as my own life.\u201d\n\nLeaving Alexander in grief, the king suffered a mental breakdown, refused to eat or drink for days, and didn\u2019t pay attention to his personal appearance but rather silently mourned or lay on the ground screaming and cutting his hair short. Plutarch described that Alexander\u2019s grief was uncontrollable. He ordered that the manes and tails of all horses be shorn, he commanded the demolition of all battles, and he banned flutes and every other kind of music.\n\nAlexander\u2019s Death\n\nIn 323 BC, Alexander died in the city of Babylon, which he had initially planned to establish as his empire\u2019s capital in Mesopotamia. There are two distinct versions of Alexander\u2019s death. According to Plutarch, Alexander developed a fever after entertaining Admiral Nearchus and spending the night drinking with Medius of Larissa the next day; this fever worsened until he was unable to speak.\n\nIn another account, Diodorus described that after Alexander drank a large bowl of wine in honor of Heracles, he experienced extreme pain, followed by 11 days of weakness. He did not die of fever but rather died after some agony. Following his death, the Macedonian Empire eventually fell apart because of the Wars of Diadochi, which marked the beginning of the Hellenistic period.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe spreading and combining of the cultures of Greco-Buddhism and Hellenistic Judaism comprise Alexanders\u2019 legacy. He also founded the most prominent city in Egypt, the city of Alexandria, along with several other cities that were named after him.\n\nThe dominance of Hellenistic civilization spread up to the Indian subcontinent. It developed through the Roman Empire and Western culture where the Greek language became the common language or lingua franca, as well as became the predominant language of the Byzantine Empire until its disintegration in the mid-15th century AD. All of this is because he had his best friend and army leader, Hephaestion, next to him at all times.\n\nAlexander\u2019s military achievements and enduring success in battle caused several later military leaders to look up to him. His tactics have become a significant subject of studies in military academies worldwide to this day.\n\nIn particular, Alexander and Hephaestion\u2019s relationship led to numerous accusations and speculations that interest different authors from ancient and modern times to write about their stories and give rise to a different genre of literature.\n\nThe Relationship between Alexander and Hephaestion\n\nSome modern scholars suggested that aside from being close friends, Alexander the Great and Hephaestion were also lovers. However, the truth is that there is no credible evidence linking them romantically or sexually. Even the most reliable sources refer to them as friends, but there is circumstantial evidence suggesting they were really close.\n\nRelationship Narration\n\nAlexander and Hephaestion\u2019s relationship was described as a deep and meaningful one. According to one narrative, Hephaestion was \u201cby far the dearest of all the king\u2019s friends; he had been brought up with Alexander and shared all his secrets,\u201d and their relationship lasted throughout their lives. Aristotle even described their friendship as \u201cone soul abiding in two bodies.\u201d\n\nAlexander and Hephaestion had a strong personal bond. Hephaestion was Alexander\u2019s confidant and closest friend. They worked as partners and were always on each other\u2019s side. Whenever Alexander need to divide his armies, he delegated the other half to Hephaestion. The king appealed for consultation from his senior officers but, it was only with Hephaestion that he would speak privately. The latter displayed unquestionable loyalty and support as the king trusted and relied on him.\n\nRelationship in the Biography of Alexander\n\nAlthough none of Alexander\u2019s extant biographers ever mentioned Hephaestion as anything but Alexander\u2019s friend, Hephaestion\u2019s epithet given by Alexander himself was \u201cPhilolexandros.\u201d \u201cPhilos\u201d was the ancient Greek word for a friend, which also pertained to lovers in the sexual sense.\n\nTheir affection for each other was conspicuous. One piece of circumstantial evidence was stated by Arrian, Curtius, and Diodorus; when the Persian queen Sisygambis mistakenly knelt to Hephaestion instead of Alexander, Alexander pardoned the queen saying, \u201cYou were not mistaken, Mother; this man, too, is Alexander.\u201d Another was when Hephaestion was replying to the letter of Alexander\u2019s mother, he wrote, \u201cyou know that Alexander means more to us than anything.\u201d\n\nHephaestion was Alexander\u2019s first wedding torch-bearer in the painting done by Aetion. This implies not only their friendship but also his support for Alexander\u2019s policies. Their relationship was even compared with that of Achilles and Patroclus. Hammond concludes about their affair: \u201cIt is not surprising that Alexander was as closely attached to Hephaestion as Achilles was to Patroclus.\u201d\n\nLoving Relationship\n\nAccording to Arrian and Plutarch, there was an occasion when the two publicly identified themselves as Achilles and Patroclus. When Alexander led a large army to visit Troy, he placed a garland on the tomb of Achilles, and Hephaestion did the same on the tomb of Patroclus. They ran naked to honor their dead heroes.\n\nHowever, according to Thomas R. Martin and Christopher W. Blackwell, it doesn\u2019t mean that Alexander and Hephaestion related to Achilles and Patroclus in terms of being in a homosexual relationship because Homer never implied that Achilles and Patroclus had a sexual relationship.\n\nWhen Hephaestion died, Alexander referred to him as \u201cthe friend I valued as my own life.\u201d He even suffered a mental breakdown, refused to eat or drink for days, didn\u2019t pay attention to his personal appearance but rather silently mourned or lay on the ground screaming and cutting his hair short.\n\nPlutarch described that Alexander\u2019s grief was uncontrollable. He ordered that the manes and tails of all horses should be shorn, he commanded the demolition of all battles, and he banned flutes and every other kind of music.\n\nAlexander and Hephaestion Books\n\nAs their controversial relationship is a hotly debated topic, many authors became interested in its mystery and wrote books telling their stories. Among the most popular ones was Mary Renault, an English writer widely known for her historical novels set in ancient Greece. Her works are about love, sexuality, and gender preference, with openly gay characters, for which she has received several awards and honors both during her lifetime and after her death.\n\nRenault\u2019s most successful and famous historical novel was \u201cThe Alexander Trilogy,\u201d which includes: Fire from Heaven, written in 1969, about Alexander the Great\u2019s childhood and youth; The Persian Boy, written in 1972 and a best seller within the gay community, where the love between Alexander and Hephaestion was immortalized; and Funeral Games, a 1981 novel about Alexander\u2019s death and the disintegration of his empire.\n\nOther historical novels about Alexander written by Jeanne Reames were Dancing with the Lion and Dancing with the Lion: Rise under the genres of historical fiction, romance novel, and gay fiction.

A member of Alexander the Great\u2019s personal bodyguard, he went on to command the Companion cavalry and was entrusted with many other tasks throughout Alexander's ten-year campaign in Asia, including diplomatic missions, the bridging of major rivers, sieges and the foundation of new settlements. Besides being a soldier, engineer and diplomat he corresponded with the philosophers Aristotle and Xenocrates and actively supported Alexander in his attempts to integrate the Greeks and Persians. Alexander formally made him his second-in-command when he appointed him Chiliarch of the empire. Alexander also made him part of the royal family when he gave him as his bride Drypetis, sister to his own second wife Stateira, both daughters of Darius III of Persia. When he died suddenly at Ecbatana around age thirty-two, Alexander was overwhelmed with grief. He petitioned the oracle at Siwa to grant Hephaestion divine status and thus Hephaestion was honoured as a Divine Hero. Hephaestion was cremated and his ashes taken to Babylon. At the time of his own death a mere eight months later, Alexander was still planning lasting monuments to Hephaestion's memory.\n\n\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u662f\u4e00\u4f4d\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u519b\u4eba\u3002\u4ed6\u662f\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u5927\u5e1d\u8d34\u8eab\u8fd1\u536b\u56e2\u7684\u4e00\u5458\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ed6\u4e5f\u6307\u6325\u7740\u8fd1\u536b\u9a91\u58eb\u56e2\uff0c\u5728\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u8fdc\u5f81\u4e9a\u6d32\u7684\u5341\u5e74\u6218\u5f79\u4e2d\u80a9\u8d1f\u7740\u8bb8\u591a\u91cd\u8981\u804c\u8d23\u3002\u5305\u62ec\u5916\u4ea4\u804c\u8d23\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6cb3\u6d41\u7684\u6865\u6881\u5efa\u8bbe\uff0c\u56f4\u57ce\u6218\u5f79\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u6b96\u6c11\u57ce\u5e02\u7684\u4fee\u5efa\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u540d\u519b\u4eba\uff0c\u4e00\u4f4d\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\uff0c\u4e00\u540d\u5916\u4ea4\u5b98\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u8fd8\u548c\u54f2\u5b66\u5bb6\u4e9a\u91cc\u58eb\u591a\u5fb7\u3001\u54f2\u5b66\u5bb6\u9f50\u8bfa\u514b\u96f7\u8482\u4fdd\u6301\u7740\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u79ef\u6781\u5730\u652f\u6301\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u5bf9\u5e0c\u814a\u4eba\u548c\u6ce2\u65af\u4eba\u7684\u6c11\u65cf\u878d\u5408\u4e3e\u63aa\u3002\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u6b63\u5f0f\u4efb\u547d\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u4e3a\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6307\u6325\u5b98\u3001\u5e1d\u56fd\u5343\u592b\u957f\u4e00\u804c\u3002\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u5c06\u5fb7\u8389\u6bd4\u5a23\u4e1d\u5ac1\u7ed9\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\uff0c\u4f7f\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u6210\u4e3a\u7687\u5ba4\u6210\u5458\uff0c\u800c\u5fb7\u8389\u6bd4\u5a23\u4e1d\u7684\u59d0\u59d0\u5ac1\u4e3a\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4efb\u59bb\u5b50\uff0c\u4e24\u4f4d\u516c\u4e3b\u90fd\u662f\u6ce2\u65af\u5e1d\u56fd\u56fd\u738b\u5927\u6d41\u58eb\u4e09\u4e16\u7684\u5973\u513f\u3002\u5f53\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b8932\u5c81\u5728\u57c3\u514b\u5df4\u5766\u90a3\u57ce\u7a81\u7136\u53bb\u4e16\u65f6\uff0c\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u60b2\u75db\u6b32\u7edd\u3002\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u6d3e\u4eba\u524d\u5f80\u897f\u74e6\uff08\u6ce8\uff1a\u57c3\u53ca\u57ce\u5e02\uff09\u8be2\u95ee\u795e\u8c15\uff1a\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5c06\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u4f9b\u5165\u795e\u5e99\uff1f\u56e0\u6b64\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u4ee5\u82f1\u96c4\u7684\u8363\u8000\u8eab\u4efd\u5f97\u4ee5\u4f9b\u5949\u5728\u795e\u5e99\u4e2d\u3002\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u88ab\u706b\u4e86\uff0c\u9aa8\u7070\u9001\u56de\u6545\u4e61\u5df4\u6bd4\u4f26\u3002\u5728\u4ed6\u53bb\u4e16\u516b\u4e2a\u6708\u540e\uff0c\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u8ffd\u968f\u4ed6\u800c\u53bb\uff0c\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u6b7b\u524d\u8fd8\u5728\u8ba1\u5212\u7740\u4e3a\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u4fee\u5efa\u4e0d\u673d\u7684\u7eaa\u5ff5\u7891\u3002\n\nYouth and education\u9752\u5e74\u65f6\u671f\u53ca\u6559\u80b2\u7ecf\u5386\n\nHephaestion\u2019s exact age is not known. No concise\uff08\u7b80\u660e\u7684\uff09 biography has ever been written about him, likely stemming from the fact that he died before Alexander and none of those among Alexander's companions who survived him would have had a need to promote someone other than themselves. Many scholars cite Hephaestion\u2019s age as being similar to Alexander\u2019s so it is fair to assume that he was born about 356 BC. He is said to have become a page in 343 BC, a role common to adolescent boys of the aristocratic class in Macedon. As a member of the court, he may have met Alexander around this time.\n\n\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u7684\u786e\u5207\u5e74\u9f84\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u6089\u3002\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u660e\u786e\u7684\u4f20\u8bb0\u8bb0\u8f7d\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ed6\u6b7b\u5728\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u4e4b\u524d\u8fd9\u4e00\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u7684\u540c\u4f34\u4eec\u6ca1\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u8bb0\u8f7d\u4ed6\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e4b\u4e2d\u518d\u63d0\u62d4\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u3002\u8bb8\u591a\u5b66\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u548c\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u5e74\u9f84\u76f8\u4eff\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4ed6\u51fa\u751f\u4e8e\u516c\u5143\u524d356\u5e74\u3002\u636e\u8bf4\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u5728\u516c\u5143\u524d343\u5e74\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\u4e00\u540d\u7537\u4f8d\u8005\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u9a6c\u5176\u987f\u8d35\u65cf\u4e2d\u9752\u6625\u671f\u7537\u5b69\u6240\u5171\u6709\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bab\u5ef7\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u5458\uff0c\u4ed6\u5f88\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u8fd9\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\u9047\u5230\u4e86\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u3002\n\nThe only surviving anecdote from Hephaestion\u2019s youth comes courtesy of the Alexander Romance. According to this tale, \u201c... one day when Alexander was 15 years old [...] sailing with Hephaestion, his friend, he easily reached Pisa [...] and he went off to stroll with Hephaestion.\u201dThat Alexander\u2019s exact age is given provides another clue to Hephaestion\u2019s upbringing because at fifteen Alexander and his companions were at Mieza studying under Aristotle. Hephaestion has never been named among those who attended the lectures at Mieza, but his close friendship with Alexander at that age suggests strongly that he was numbered among them. More telling is Hephaestion\u2019s name being found in a catalogue of Aristotle\u2019s correspondences. The letters themselves no longer exist, but for them to have found their way into an official catalogue, their content must have been of some significance. It implies that Hephaestion received a good education and shows that Aristotle was impressed enough by his pupil to send letters throughout Alexander's expanding empire to converse with him.\n\n\u552f\u4e00\u7559\u5b58\u4e0b\u6765\u7684\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u5927\u5e1d\u7684\u8da3\u95fb\u8f76\u4e8b\u90fd\u662f\u5173\u4e8e\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u5e74\u8f7b\u65f6\u5411\u4ed6\u732e\u6bb7\u52e4\u7684\u6d6a\u6f2b\u6545\u4e8b\u3002\u5982\u4e0b\u6240\u8a00\uff1a\u201c\u2026\u2026\u4e00\u65e5\uff0c\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u592715\u5c81\u65f6\u2026\u2026\u548c\u4ed6\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u4e00\u8d77\u822a\u884c\uff0c\u4ed6\u5f88\u5feb\u5230\u8fbe\u4e86\u6bd4\u8428\uff08\u6ce8\uff1a\u610f\u5927\u5229\u57ce\u5e02\uff09\u2026\u2026\u4ed6\u548c\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u4e00\u8d77\u6f2b\u6b65\u8857\u5934\u3002\u201d\u8fd9\u91cc\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5e74\u9f84\u4e3a\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u572815\u5c81\u65f6\u548c\u4ed6\u7684\u540c\u4f34\u4eec\u90fd\u5728\u7c73\u8036\u8428\u57ce\u63a5\u53d7\u4e9a\u91cc\u58eb\u591a\u5fb7\u7684\u6559\u5bfc\u3002\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u63d0\u5230\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u540d\u5b57\u7684\u662f\u4e9a\u91cc\u58eb\u591a\u5fb7\u7684\u4e66\u4fe1\u76ee\u5f55\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e66\u4fe1\u5df2\u7ecf\u4e0d\u590d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u65e2\u7136\u88ab\u8bb0\u5f55\u5230\u4e86\u5b98\u65b9\u76ee\u5f55\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u5b83\u4e00\u5b9a\u5177\u6709\u67d0\u79cd\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u63a5\u53d7\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6559\u80b2\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b66\u751f\u7ed9\u4e9a\u91cc\u58eb\u591a\u5fb7\u7559\u4e0b\u4e86\u8db3\u591f\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u5370\u8c61\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u6269\u5c55\u5e1d\u56fd\u7248\u56fe\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e9a\u91cc\u58eb\u591a\u5fb7\u8fd8\u4e0d\u95f4\u65ad\u7684\u7ed9\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u5199\u4fe1\u4ea4\u6d41\u3002\n\nA few years after the lectures at Mieza, Hephaestion\u2019s presence was notably absent when several of Alexander\u2019s close friends were exiled as a result of the Pixodarus affair. Among those exiled by Philip II after Alexander\u2019s failed attempt to offer himself as groom to the Carian princess were Ptolemy, Nearchus, Harpalus, Erigyius and Laomedon. The reason for Hephaestion\u2019s absence from this list could be due to the fact that all of the exiled men were older friends of Alexander, Erigyius himself roughly 24 years older than the prince. Hephaestion was a contemporary of Alexander and it is likely that his influence might have been seen as less of a threat than these more mature companions. Whatever Hephaestion\u2019s opinion had been on the whole affair, like many of Alexander\u2019s other childhood companions he was not exiled in its aftermath.\n\n\u5728\u7c73\u8036\u8428\u63a5\u53d7\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u51e0\u5e74\u540e\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6f58\u8fbe\u6d1b\u65af\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u7684\u51e0\u4e2a\u5bc6\u53cb\u906d\u5230\u6d41\u653e\uff0c\u8fd9\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u51cf\u5c11\u3002\u5728\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u8bd5\u56fe\u5047\u626e\u7537\u4ec6\u5931\u8d25\u540e\uff0c\u83f2\u5229\u666e\u4e8c\u4e16\uff08\u6ce8\uff1a\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u7684\u7236\u4eb2\uff09\u5c06\u6258\u52d2\u5bc6\u3001\u5c3c\u963f\u5e93\u65af\u3001\u54c8\u5e15\u9c81\u65af\u3001\u827e\u5229\u5409\u4e9a\u65af\u548c\u62c9\u4fc4\u58a8\u51ac\u6d41\u653e\u3002\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u6ca1\u6709\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u540d\u5355\u4e0a\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\uff0c\u906d\u5230\u6d41\u653e\u7684\u90fd\u662f\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u5e74\u957f\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u4eec\uff0c\u827e\u5229\u5409\u4e9a\u65af\u5c31\u6bd4\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u738b\u5b50\u8981\u592724\u5c81\u3002\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u662f\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u540c\u9f84\u7684\u670b\u53cb\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4ed6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8981\u6bd4\u8fd9\u4e9b\u66f4\u4e3a\u6210\u719f\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u8981\u5c11\u5f97\u591a\uff0c\u6545\u800c\u5a01\u80c1\u4e5f\u5c0f\u5f97\u591a\u3002\u4e0d\u8bba\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u5728\u6574\u4ef6\u4e8b\u60c5\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u6b63\u5982\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u5176\u4ed6\u7ae5\u5e74\u73a9\u4f34\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u88ab\u6d41\u653e\u3002\n\nWhile it is true that very little detail of Hephaestion\u2019s childhood and education can be found, that which remains gives credence to what is known about his later life.

His first taste of military action was probably the campaign against the Thracians while Alexander was regent, followed by Philip II's Danube campaign (342 BC) and the battle of Chaeronea (338 BC) while he was still in his teens. His name is not mentioned in lists of high-ranking officers during the early battles of Alexander's Danube campaign (335 BC) or the invasion of Persia.

Right from the start he was also engaged in special missions, sometimes diplomatic, sometimes technical. The first mention of his career in the sources is a diplomatic mission of some importance. After the battle of Issus (333 BC) when Alexander was proceeding south down the Phoenician coast and had received the capitulation of Sidon, Hephaestion was \"... authorised to appoint to the throne the Sidonian he considered most deserving of that high office.\" Hephaestion took local advice and chose a man distantly related to the royal family, but whose honesty had reduced him to working as a gardener.

Hephaestion's task was not an easy one for this was not the Athenian fleet with which Alexander had started and had earlier disbanded, but a motley collection of semi-reluctant allies of many nationalities who would need holding together with patience and strength.

The subject matter suggests that this took place while they were in Egypt. What business Hephaestion was attending to we do not know, but Andrew Chugg has suggested that it was concerned either with his command of the fleet or Athenian diplomacy. He quotes sources which suggest that Hephaestion had been approached by Aristion of Athens to effect a reconciliation between Alexander and Demosthenes and, certainly, Athens' inaction during the revolt of the Spartan king Agis would seem to support this idea. As Chugg says, \"If he did persuade Alexander to reach an accommodation with Demosthenes at this critical juncture, as would seem likely from the circumstances, then he was significantly responsible for saving the situation for Macedon in Greece by preventing the revolt of Agis spreading to Athens and her allies.\"\n\n\u5728\u666e\u9c81\u5854\u514b\uff08\u6ce8\uff1a\u5e0c\u814a\u5386\u53f2\u5bb6\uff09\u5199\u7ed9\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u7684\u4fe1\u4ef6\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u4e00\u6b21\u63d0\u5230\u8fc7\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u7ed9\u4ed6\u7684\u56de\u4fe1\u4e2d\u8868\u660e\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u53e6\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u8fd9\u4ef6\u4e8b\u60c5\u4e3b\u8981\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u57c3\u53ca\u5883\u5185\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u4f46\u5b89\u5fb7\u9c81\u00b7\u67e5\u683c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u548c\u4ed6\u5bf9\u8230\u961f\u7684\u6307\u6325\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u96c5\u5178\u7684\u5916\u4ea4\u6709\u5173\u3002\u4ed6\u5f15\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u6d88\u606f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u66fe\u4e0e\u96c5\u5178\u8d35\u65cf\u63a5\u89e6\uff0c\u96c5\u5178\u8d35\u65cf\u8bd5\u56fe\u4fc3\u6210\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u548c\u5fb7\u6469\u65af\u68af\u5c3c\uff08\u53e4\u4ee3\u5e0c\u814a\u7684\u96c4\u8fa9\u5bb6\uff09\u7684\u548c\u89e3\uff0c\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u65af\u5df4\u8fbe\u56fd\u738b\u963f\u5409\u65af\u53db\u4e71\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f3c\u4e4e\u4e5f\u8868\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u89c2\u70b9\u3002\u6b63\u5982\u67e5\u683c\u6240\u8a00\u201c\u5982\u679c\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u80fd\u591f\u529d\u670d\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u65f6\u523b\u548c\u5fb7\u6469\u65af\u68af\u5c3c\u548c\u89e3\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u5728\u5f53\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u52bf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ed6\u5c31\u80a9\u8d1f\u4e86\u633d\u6551\u9a6c\u5176\u987f\u738b\u56fd\u5728\u5e0c\u814a\u7684\u5371\u9669\u5c40\u52bf\u2014\u2014\u963b\u6b62\u963f\u5409\u65af\u7684\u53db\u4e71\u8513\u5ef6\u5230\u96c5\u5178\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u76df\u53cb\u2014\u2014\u7684\u8d23\u4efb\u3002\u201d\n\nIt is likely, though not certain, that it was Hephaestion who led the advance army from Egypt to bridge the Euphrates river. Darius of Persia sent Mazaeus to hold the opposite bank while the bridging work was in progress. This Mazaeus was the commander who threw away what looked like certain victory on the Persian right at the battle of Gaugamela (331 BC) and later became Alexander's governor of Babylon. Robin Lane Fox has suggested that a conversation with Hephaestion may have won Mazaeus over: \"It is conceivable that the battle of Gaugamela was partly won on the banks of the Euphrates and that Mazaeus' reinstatement was less a sign of magnanimity than of a prearranged reward.\"\n\n\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u5f88\u5927\uff0c\u662f\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u63d0\u5b89\u4ece\u57c3\u53ca\u7387\u9886\u5148\u9063\u90e8\u961f\u8fdb\u5165\u5e7c\u53d1\u62c9\u5e95\u6cb3\u6d41\u57df\u3002\u6ce2\u65af\u738b\u5927\u6d41\u58eb\u6d3e\u9063\u739b\u624e\u4e4c\u65af\u524d\u5f80\u5bf9\u5cb8\u4fee\u5efa\u6865\u6881\u3002\u739b\u624e\u4e4c\u65af\u662f\u4e00\u4f4d\u6307\u6325\u5b98\uff0c\u5728\u516c\u5143\u524d331\u5e74\u7684\u5361\u5854\u7c73\u57c3\u62c9\u6218\u5f79\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ed6\u5c06\u6ce2\u65af\u5373\u5c06\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u80dc\u5229\u62f1\u624b\u76f8\u8ba9\uff0c\u540e\u6765\u4ed6\u6210\u4e3a\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u7684\u5df4\u6bd4\u4f26\u603b\u7763\u3002\u7f57\u5bbe\u00b7\u83b1\u6069\u00b7\u798f\u514b\u65af\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u5728\u8c08\u8bdd\u4e2d\u8d62\u5f97\u4e86\u739b\u624e\u4e4c\u65af\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff1a\u201c\u53ef\u4ee5\u60f3\u8c61\uff0c\u5361\u5854\u7c73\u57c3\u62c9\u6218\u5f79\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8d62\u5f97\u4e86\u5e7c\u53d1\u62c9\u5e95\u6cb3\u4e24\u5cb8\u80dc\u5229\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u739b\u624e\u4e4c\u65af\u7684\u5b98\u590d\u539f\u804c\u4e0e\u5176\u8bf4\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5bbd\u5b8f\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0d\u5982\u8bf4\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9884\u5148\u7ea6\u5b9a\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u3002\u201d\n\nIt is at Gaugamela that mention is first made of Hephaestion's rank.

One evening in Babylon Alexander noticed a high-born woman obliged to dance as part of the entertainment. Curtius explains: \"The following day, he (Alexander) instructed Hephaestion to have all the prisoners brought to the royal quarters and there he verified the lineage of each of them.\" Alexander had realized that people from noble families were being treated with little dignity and wanted to do something about it. That he chose Hephaestion to help him shows that he could rely on Hephaestion's tact and sympathy. Yet Alexander could also rely on Hephaestion for firmness and resolve. When his policies had led to a plot against his life, the possible involvement of a senior officer, Philotas, caused much concern. It was Hephaestion, along with Craterus and Coenus, who insisted on, and actually carried out, the customary torture.\n\n\u5728\u5361\u5854\u7c73\u57c3\u62c9\u6218\u5f79\u540e\uff0c\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u9996\u6b21\u51fa\u73b0\u548c\u6ce2\u65af\u4eba\u548c\u89e3\u7684\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u652f\u6301\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e0d\u8ba8\u597d\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u3002\u5728\u5df4\u6bd4\u4f26\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u591c\u665a\uff0c\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u51fa\u8eab\u9ad8\u8d35\u7684\u5973\u4eba\u5fc5\u987b\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u8df3\u821e\u53d6\u4e50\u3002\u5e93\u5c14\u4fee\u65af\u89e3\u91ca\u9053\uff1a\u201c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5929\uff0c\u4ed6\uff08\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\uff09\u8981\u6c42\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u4fd8\u864f\u5e26\u5230\u5bab\u5ef7\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e00\u4e00\u67e5\u9a8c\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u8840\u7edf\u3002\u201d\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d35\u65cf\u53d7\u5230\u4e86\u4e0d\u516c\u6b63\u7684\u5f85\u9047\u5e76\u4e14\u60f3\u6539\u53d8\u8fd9\u4ef6\u4e8b\u3002\u4ed6\u9009\u62e9\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u5e2e\u52a9\u4ed6\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4fe1\u4efb\u5e76\u4f9d\u8d56\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u7684\u673a\u667a\u548c\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u3002\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u7684\u575a\u5b9a\u4e0d\u79fb\u4e5f\u662f\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u6240\u501a\u4ed7\u7684\u3002\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u573a\u9488\u5bf9\u4ed6\u7684\u523a\u6740\uff0c\u4e00\u540d\u9ad8\u7ea7\u519b\u5b98\u83f2\u6d1b\u5854\u65af\u4e5f\u88ab\u5377\u5165\u6b64\u4e8b\u3002\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u3001\u514b\u62c9\u7279\u9c81\u65af\u548c\u79d1\u7eb3\u65af\u575a\u6301\u6309\u7167\u60ef\u4f8b\u5b9e\u65bd\u60e9\u7f5a\u3002\n\nAfter the execution of Philotas (330 BC), Hephaestion was appointed joint commander\u2014with Cleitus\u2014of the Companion cavalry, Philotas' former position. This dual appointment was a way of satisfying two divergent shades of opinion now hardening throughout the army: one, like Hephaestion, broadly supportive of Alexander's policy of integration, and the other, that of Philip's older veterans in particular, whose implacable resentment of Persian ways was well represented by Cleitus. The cavalry prospered under this command, showing itself equal to learning new tactics necessary against Scythian nomads and to counter-insurgency measures such as those deployed in the spring of 328 BC. The army set out from Balkh in five columns to spread through the valleys between the Oxus and Tanais[dubious \u2013 discuss] rivers to pacify Sogdiana. Hephaestion commanded one of the columns and, after arriving at Marakanda, he set out again to establish settlements in the region.\n\n\u516c\u5143\u524d330\u5e74\uff0c\u83f2\u6d1b\u5854\u65af\u88ab\u5904\u6b7b\u540e\uff0c\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u88ab\u4efb\u547d\u4e3a\u8054\u5408\u6307\u6325\u5b98\u2014\u2014\u548c\u514b\u96f7\u5854\u65af\u4e00\u8d77\u2014\u2014\u4ee3\u66ff\u4e86\u83f2\u6d1b\u5854\u65af\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u804c\u4f4d\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u53cc\u91cd\u4efb\u547d\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6ee1\u8db3\u519b\u4e2d\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u89c2\u70b9\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u50cf\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u575a\u5b9a\u4e0d\u79fb\u7684\u652f\u6301\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\uff08\u6ce8\uff1a\u6307\u6ce2\u65af\u4eba\u548c\u9a6c\u5176\u987f\u4eba\u7684\u878d\u5408\uff09\u653f\u7b56\uff1b\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u8ffd\u968f\u8fc7\u524d\u738b\u83f2\u5229\u666e\u7684\u65e7\u90e8\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u6028\u6068\u5e76\u65e0\u60c5\u7684\u5bf9\u5f85\u6ce2\u65af\u4eba\uff0c\u50cf\u514b\u96f7\u5854\u65af\u90a3\u6837\u7684\u3002\u9a91\u5175\u56e2\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u5e26\u9886\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u80dc\u5229\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e73\u7b49\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u6218\u672f\u6765\u5bf9\u6297\u585e\u897f\u4e9a\u7684\u6e38\u7267\u6c11\u65cf\u548c\u9547\u538b\u53db\u4e71\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u516c\u5143\u524d328\u5e74\u6625\u5929\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6218\u5f79\u3002\u519b\u961f\u4ece\u5927\u590f\uff08Balkh\uff09\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5728\u5965\u514b\u65af\u548c\u5854\u7eb3\u65af\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5c71\u8c37\u4e2d\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u4e94\u5217\u7eb5\u961f[\u6b64\u5904\u5b58\u7591]\uff0c\u6e21\u6cb3\u5e73\u5b9a\u7d22\u683c\u5e95\u4e9a\u90a3\u3002\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u7387\u9886\u4e00\u5217\u7eb5\u961f\u5230\u8fbe\u9a6c\u62c9\u574e\u8fbe\u540e\uff0c\u53c8\u9a6c\u4e0a\u7740\u624b\u5efa\u7acb\u5c45\u4f4f\u70b9\u3002\n\nIn spring 327 BC the army headed into India and Alexander divided his forces. He led his section north into the Swat Valley, while Hephaestion and Perdiccas took a sizeable contingent through the Khyber Pass. Hephaestion's orders were to \"... take over either by force or agreement all places on their march and upon reaching the Indus to make suitable preparations for crossing.\" They were in unknown territory, whose political and geographical landscapes were unfamiliar, and Hephaestion would have had to make decisions on the spot and act accordingly. He reached the Indus with the land behind him conquered, including the successful siege of Peuceolatis, which took thirty days, and proceeded to organize the construction of boats for the crossing.\n\n\u516c\u5143\u524d327\u5e74\u6625\uff0c\u519b\u961f\u8fdb\u5165\u5370\u5ea6\u540e\u5175\u5206\u4e24\u8def\u3002\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u7387\u5175\u5f80\u5317\u8fdb\u5165\u65af\u74e6\u7279\u5c71\u8c37\uff0c\u800c\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u548c\u4f69\u5c14\u72c4\u5361\u65af\u7387\u9886\u5927\u534a\u519b\u961f\u7a7f\u8fc7\u5f00\u4f2f\u5c14\u5c71\u53e3\u3002\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u7684\u547d\u4ee4\u662f\uff1a\u201c\u2026\u2026\u6cbf\u9014\u6240\u6709\u5730\u65b9\u901a\u8fc7\u6b66\u529b\u5360\u9886\u6216\u8005\u534f\u8bae\u540c\u76df\uff0c\u6cbf\u9014\u505a\u597d\u5230\u8fbe\u5370\u5ea6\u6cb3\u540e\u8de8\u8d8a\u8fb9\u5883\u7684\u51c6\u5907\u3002\u201d\u5728\u964c\u751f\u7684\u5730\u57df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u653f\u6cbb\u548c\u5730\u7406\u90fd\u662f\u4e0d\u719f\u6089\u7684\uff0c\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u5fc5\u987b\u53ca\u65f6\u5e94\u5bf9\u5404\u79cd\u4e0d\u826f\u906d\u9047\u3002\u5f53\u4ed6\u5230\u8fbe\u5370\u5ea6\u6cb3\u7554\u65f6\uff0c\u6240\u8fc7\u4e4b\u5883\u7686\u4e3a\u81e3\u5c5e\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u56f4\u653bPeuceolatis\uff08\u6ce8\uff1a\u53ea\u5728\u8be5\u8bcd\u6761\u6709\u8be5\u8bcd\uff0c\u5e94\u4e3a\u5730\u540d\uff09\uff0c\u519b\u961f\u82b1\u8d39\u4e86\u4e09\u5341\u5929\uff0c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5e76\u5efa\u9020\u8fc7\u6cb3\u7684\u6e21\u8239\u3002\n\nAlexander often had to divide his forces and command was given to a variety of senior officers on different occasions. For example, a few weeks before this mission of Hephaestion's, Craterus had been sent with a large force to subdue the last two remaining Bactrian rebels. It seems that Hephaestion was chosen when the objectives were far from clear-cut, and Alexander needed a commander on whom he could rely to do what he would have done himself without needing instructions.\n\n\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u7ecf\u5e38\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6218\u4e89\u4e2d\u5c06\u519b\u961f\u548c\u6307\u6325\u6743\u5206\u914d\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u519b\u5b98\u624b\u4e2d\u3002\u4e3e\u4e2a\u4f8b\u5b50\uff0c\u5728\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u524d\u51e0\u5468\uff0c\u514b\u62c9\u7279\u9c81\u65af\u53d7\u547d\u7387\u9886\u4e00\u652f\u5927\u519b\u9547\u538b\u6700\u540e\u4e24\u5904\u5927\u590f\u53db\u4e71\u3002\u5728\u4e00\u5207\u5f62\u52bf\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u9009\u62e9\u4e86\u4ed6\uff0c\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u9700\u8981\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u8fd9\u6837\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f9d\u9760\u53c8\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u5df1\u4e8b\u4e8b\u6307\u793a\u7684\u6307\u6325\u5b98\u3002\n\nHephaestion took part in a notable cavalry charge at the battle of the Hydaspes river (326 BC). Then when the army began its homeward journey he was again entrusted with half the army, including the elite troops and two hundred elephants, as they travelled south-west along the banks of the Hydaspes. Some of the army, including Alexander himself, travelled in boats which had been provided by the sponsorship of leading courtiers. Arrian lists Hephaestion first among these \"honorary trierarchs\", indicating his leading position at this time. On entering hostile territory Alexander split his forces into three. Hephaestion's section marched \"... five days in advance, with the object of intercepting and capturing any native troops which ... might be rapidly moving forward\". Again, Hephaestion was called upon when initiative was required. After Alexander had taken a detour to subdue a hostile tribe, in which he was seriously injured, Hephaestion took command of the greater part of the army as they travelled down the Indus to the sea. At the coast he organized the construction of a fortress and a harbour for the fleet at Pattala.\n\n\u5728\u516c\u5143\u524d326\u5e74\u7684\u5e0c\u8fbe\u65af\u76ae\u65af\u6cb3\u6218\u5f79\u4e2d\uff0c\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u5e26\u9886\u9a91\u5175\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u6b21\u8457\u540d\u7684\u51b2\u950b\u3002\u5728\u519b\u961f\u56de\u7a0b\u7684\u8def\u4e0a\uff0c\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u53c8\u7387\u547d\u5e26\u9886\u4e00\u534a\u519b\u961f\uff1a\u5305\u62ec\u7cbe\u9510\u90e8\u961f\u548c\u4e8c\u767e\u5934\u5927\u8c61\uff0c\u6cbf\u7740\u5e0c\u8fbe\u65af\u76ae\u65af\u6cb3\u5cb8\u897f\u5357\u800c\u884c\u3002\u5305\u62ec\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u672c\u4eba\u5728\u5185\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u519b\u961f\u4e58\u5750\u7684\u6e21\u8239\u662f\u7531\u4e3b\u8981\u671d\u81e3\u8d5e\u52a9\u7684\u3002\u963f\u91cc\u5b89\u5217\u4e3e\u4e86\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u201c\u8363\u8000\u53f8\u4ee4\u5b98\u201d\uff08\u6ce8\uff1a\u96c5\u5178\u4e09\u5c42\u6868\u5ea7\u6218\u8239\u7684\u4fee\u9020\u4eba\u6216\u53f8\u4ee4\u5b98\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u7387\u4f5c\u7528\u4ee5\u53ca\u9886\u5148\u5730\u4f4d\u3002\u5728\u8fdb\u5165\u654c\u5bf9\u5730\u57df\u65f6\uff0c\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u5c06\u519b\u961f\u5206\u4e3a\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u7387\u9886\u4e00\u961f\u524d\u884c\uff1a\u201c\u2026\u2026\u63d0\u524d\u4e94\u5929\u524d\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u90e8\u961f\u62e6\u622a\u6563\u5175\u548c\u62bc\u9001\u4fd8\u864f\u2026\u2026\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc5\u901f\u5730\u524d\u884c\u3002\u201d\u53c8\u4e00\u6b21\uff0c\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u88ab\u8d4b\u4e88\u4e86\u4e3b\u52a8\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u6743\u5229\u3002\u5f53\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u7ed5\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u654c\u5bf9\u90e8\u843d\u65f6\uff0c\u5374\u56e0\u6b64\u53d7\u4e86\u91cd\u4f24\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u5728\u4ece\u5370\u5ea6\u6cb3\u822a\u884c\u5230\u6d77\u57df\u7684\u884c\u519b\u4e2d\u627f\u62c5\u4e86\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u519b\u961f\u7684\u6307\u6325\u6743\u3002\u5728\u6d77\u8fb9\uff0c\u8d6b\u83f2\u65af\u8482\u5b89\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5efa\u9020\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8981\u585e\u548c\u7ec4\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u652f\u524d\u5f80\u5e15\u8482\u4e9a\u62c9\u6e2f\u53e3\u7684\u8230\u961f\u3002\n\nHephaestion was in command at Pattala while Alexander advanced. When he rejoined Alexander at Rhambacia he established a city there also. Hephaestion crossed the Gedrosian desert with Alexander, sharing the torments of that journey and, when the army was safely back in Susa, he was decorated for bravery. He was to take part in no further fighting; he had only months to live. But, having ended his military career as Alexander's de facto second-in-command, he was also his second in the political sphere. Alexander had made that official by naming him Chiliarch.

His father Amyntor must have been an important man, because his son was educated at the court of king Philip (360-336). The Greek name of Hephaestion's father suggests that he was one of the Greek mercenary leaders or intellectuals who came to Macedonia and received an honorable treatment. (The father of Alexander's admiral and friend Nearchus is another example.)\n\nMieza, nymphaeum\n\nWhen he was still young, Hephaestion met the crown prince Alexander. Although an explicit connection between Hephaestion and the famous Macedonian scientist and philosopher Aristotle of Stagira is not mentioned in our best sources, we may assume that Hephaestion, like Alexander, was educated by Aristotle, whose school in the Nymphaeum of Mieza (below modern Naousa) was situated in one of the most beautiful and green parts of Macedonia. If we are to believe Diogenes Laertius, the author of several entertaining Lives of Eminent Philosophers, Aristotle published a collection of letters to Hephaestion,note[Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers 5.1.27.] which suggests that the two wrote to each other during Alexander's Persian campaign. However, Diogenes is not always a reliable author.\n\nAnatolia\n\nHephaestion is first mentioned at the very beginning of the histories of Alexander's Persian campaign, when the invaders reached Troy (May 334). He is never introduced as 'a friend' or 'a companion' of the king; he is simply mentioned, which suggests that the historians assumed that everybody knew Hephaestion's position as Alexander's lover. (We don't have to introduce Juliet once Romeo is on the stage.)\n\nAt Troy, Alexander venerated the ancient heroes. It is said that he went to the tomb of his legendary ancestor Achilles and that Hephaestion sacrificed to Achilles' friend Patroclus. Again, this suggests that Hephaestion was Alexander's lover, because in the fourth century, it was widely believed that the two legendary heroes had been lovers. (Homer states that they used to spend the night separately - a remark that is only meaningful when it was already taken for granted that the two were lovers.)\n\nIf the parallel between Achilles and Patroclus on the one hand and Alexander and Hephaestion on the other hand was really perfect, Hephaestion was - like Patroclus - older than his lover. Since Alexander was born in the summer of 356, we may assume that his friend was born in, say, 357.\n\nAfter the visit to Troy, Hephaestion disappears for some time from our sources. This suggests that he was with Alexander and did not occupy commands worth mentioning. It is only after the battle of Issus (November 333) that we reencounter Hephaestion in our sources, in a famous anecdote. After the Macedonian victory, queen Statira was captured. She went to Alexander and kneeled down in front of Hephaestion, thinking that he was the king. Alexander saved her face by saying \"Don't worry, mother. Everywhere, he is Alexander too\".\n\nDetail of the Alexander sarcophagus, probably Hephaestion\n\nIt is possible that Hephaestion is depicted on the Alexander sarcophagus. If the identification is correct, Hephaestion fought on horseback during the battle of Issus.\n\nThe Levant\n\nAlexander was now twenty-three and Hephaestion may have been twenty-four or older. According to the Macedonian and Greek ideas about love and sexuality, the time for homosexual affairs was over. The young men had to marry. Hephaestion could no longer be Alexander's lover, and had to find a new role, especially since the king accepted a Persian mistress, Barsine. However, the friendship between the two men remained very close.\n\nHephaestion was sent on a diplomatic mission to Sidon, where he had to appoint a new king. He chose a man named Abdalonymus. This was not a very important task, but it should be noted that he had not had earlier assignments. During the next year, he commanded the navy of the Phoenician towns that had sided with the conquerors; this meant that he had to supply the main force. This was a more important job. (It should be noted that these assignments are not mentioned in our most important source, Arrian.)\n\nDuring Alexander's stay in Egypt (first half 331), Hephaestion was approached by a friend of the Athenian politician Demosthenes, an enemy of the Macedonians. The envoy said that he hoped that Hephaestion would put in a good word for Demosthenes with Alexander. It is unclear whether Hephaestion was persuaded, or, if he was, what was the result.\n\nOn October 31, 331, the Macedonians and Persians fought a large battle at Gaugamela in northern Mesopotamia. Hephaestion was now one of the members of Alexander's bodyguard, the somatophylakes. (In fact, these seven men were not real bodyguards but adjutants.) During this bloody battle, he was wounded in an arm.\n\nThe Philotas Affair\n\nAgain, Hephaestion disappears from our sources for some time, except for an undated assignment as guard and protector of Persian captives. He becomes \"visible\" again in October 330, when several soldiers conspired against Alexander. Almost immediately, it became clear that the commander of the Companion cavalry (the best soldiers in the Macedonian army), Philotas, had known of the plans and had not reported his discovery.\n\nAt first, Alexander forgave Philotas, but the next day, the accusations were renewed by the phalanx commanders Craterus and Coenus, Philotas' brother-in-law. It is not known whether they had a secret agenda, but we may be suspicious, as we see two infantry commanders accusing the leading cavalry commander. During the night, Philotas was arrested.\n\nAs the army exercised capital jurisdiction in Macedonia, Alexander organized a trial. He accused Philotas and the court found him guilty of conspiracy. However, the precise nature of the conspiracy was unclear. Hephaestion, Craterus and Coenus declared that torture should be employed to force the truth out of Philotas. He confessed that he and his father had wanted to kill Alexander to become kings themselves. After this confession, the commander of the Companions was executed.\n\nWhat to make of this story? No one doubts that the first conspiracy was a fact, but the existence of the conspiracy of Philotas and Parmenion is another matter. The confession of the tortured man can, of course, not be taken as proof. On the other hand, it is strange that Philotas did not report the first conspiracy. It is possible that he wanted to see what happened: if the soldiers' attempt failed, nothing was lost, if it were successful, the army would chose him as its commander and king. He had much to gain, but the fact that he had a motive does not mean that he really did what he was accused of. We will never known what really happened.\n\nThe consequences of the murder were clear. In the first place, the execution of Philotas made the murder of his father Armenian inevitable - and in fact, he was killed. In the second place, the Companion cavalry was placed under two men: a safety measure against too powerful officers. The new commanders were Clitus, a trusted senior officer, and Hephaestion, who was still inexperienced.\n\nSogdia\n\nThe years 329, 328 and 327 saw fighting in Bactria and Sogdia, satrapies in the northeast of the Achaemenid Empire. Since most of the fighting was done on horseback, we would expect the commander of the Companion cavalry to be prominent in our sources, but Hephaestion is conspicuously absent. The reason is that the unit of Hephaestion and Clitus was too large for the guerilla warfare in Sogdia. It was divided into smaller units, and Hephaestion commanded only one of them. (It should be noted that Alexander killed Clitus, which would have made Hephaestion the senior commander of the Companions, an assignment that was probably still above his powers.)\n\nSo, Alexander was skeptical about Hephaestion's capacities as commander, but this did not mean that his friend was out of favor. He is mentioned as the official who had to secure provisions during the winter, an important task. Moreover, Hephaestion acted as Alexander's best man when he married with the native princess Roxane (text). But Hephaestion rarely served as commander during a fight; when he commanded an army that was to see battle, he was always sharing the command with a more experienced officer (e.g., Clitus, Artabazus, Perdiccas)."}, {"url": "https://www.indieshuffle.com/news/sufjan-stevens-mystery-of-love-glossary/", "page_content": "Sufjan Stevens has created two new singles for the LGBT+ film Call Me by Your Name.

According to several historians, Alexander had a great affinity for men; however, others believe that this is a result of a misreading of the historical record. Alexander\u2019s close ties with men like Hephaestion and Bagoas have been interpreted by some as proof of his homosexuality, while others have argued that they were merely close companions. Another common argument against Alexander\u2019s claimed homosexuality is that he was married many times to different women and had at least one child from them, Alexander IV. That is why whether Alexander the Great was gay or not is still an open question today.\n\nAlexander the Great\u2019s Relationships with Men\n\nAlexander\u2019s relationship with Hephaestion\n\nThroughout his life, Alexander the Great is said to have had a number of close relationships with men. Hephaestion, Alexander\u2019s closest friend and confidant, stood out among these friendships. It was said that Hephaestion and Alexander had been close since they were kids, almost like brothers. Alexander was so devastated by Hephaestion\u2019s death that he advocated worshipping him as a god.\n\nQueen Sisygambis mistakes Hephaestion for Alexander, but Alexander answers, \u201cNever mind, Mother, for actually he too is Alexander.\u201d\n\nBefore Plutarch and Arrian, the Roman historian Curtius authored The History of Alexander in the first century AD where he discussed Alexander and Hephaestion in his writings.\n\nAccording to Curtius,\n\n\u201cHephaestion was by far the dearest of the king\u2019s [Alexander\u2019s] friends; he had been brought up with Alexander and shared all his secrets. No other person was privileged to advise the king as candidly as he did, and yet he exercised that privilege in such a way that it seemed granted by Alexander rather than claimed by Hephaestion.\u201d Quintus Curtius Rufus, History of Alexander, 3.12.16.\n\nHephaestion is later compared to a young man called Euxenippus by Curtius in Book 7. Some researchers think he was the Persian eunuch that Alexander personally liked, Bagoas:\n\nTherefore, he [Alexander] received the envoys of the Sacae courteously and gave them Euxenippus; to accompany them; he was still very young and a favorite of the king [Alexander] because of his youthful beauty, but although in handsome appearance he was equal to Hephaestion, he was not his match in a charm which was indeed not manly. Quintus Curtius, History of Alexander, Volume II: Books 6-10, The University Of Michigan Libraries.\n\nCurtius here appears to be making a reference to the possible sexual motivations for Alexander\u2019s preference for Hephaestion over Euxenippus. And perhaps this could be why Alexander found Hephaestion\u2019s death so devastating. Curtius was cautious in describing the nature of the connection between Alexander and Hephaestion. Perhaps it was because in the 4th century BC Greece, the concept of sexual intercourse between adult males was not commonly tolerated.\n\nDiodorus Siculus, a historian from Sicily, lived between 90 and 30 BC. Despite living two centuries after Alexander, he is still one of the closest ancient historians to the time period of Alexander\u2019s life. The Macedonian general Craterus was one of the most devoted and loyal friends of Alexander, but according to Diodorus, Craterus was merely \u201cking-loving\u201d (philbasileus), while Hephaestion was \u201cAlexander-loving\u201d (philalexandros).\n\nAlexander threw himself into preparations for the burial of Hephaestion. He showed such zeal about the funeral that\u2026 it left no possibility for anything greater in later ages\u2026 \u2026when one of the companions said that Craterus was loved no less than Hephaestion, Alexander had answered that Craterus was king-loving, but Hephaestion was Alexander-loving. Diodorus. 17.114.(1-2)\n\nAfter Hephaestion passed away at Ecbatana due to fever, it was a blow to Alexander, during which he refused to eat or drink and spent three days flat on the ground in sorrow.\n\nThe chroniclers of the past often sought to portray Alexander the Great in a positive light while overlooking any perceived \u201cshortcomings\u201d he may have had. This includes whether Alexander the Great was gay. It\u2019s still worth noting that this is not concrete evidence to suggest that Alexander and Hephaestion had a romantic or homosexual relationship.\n\nAlexander\u2019s relationship with Bagoas\n\nA eunuch and Persian, Bagoas the Younger was another individual Alexander had a close friendship with. Allegedly romantically involved, Bagoas worked as Alexander\u2019s personal attendant and was designated a courtier. Following the victory, Bagoas the Younger was presented to Alexander the Great by King Darius III\u2019s court of the Persian Achaemenid Empire. Typical of ancient Greek culture, Alexander had a liking for young boys, and Bagoas soon became his closest confidant.\n\nAccording to Plutarch, the Macedonians once cheered to bade Alexander kiss Bagoas in a public event:\n\nWe are told, too, that he was once viewing some contests in singing and dancing, being well heated with wine, and that his favourite, Bagoas, won the prize for song and dance, and then, all in his festal array, passed through the theatre and took his seat by Alexander\u2019s side; at sight of which the Macedonians clapped their hands and loudly bade the king kiss the victor, until at last he threw his arms about him and kissed him tenderly. Plutarch \u2013 Life of Alexander (Part 7 of 7)\n\nAlexander the Great\u2019s Marriages and Children\n\nAs counterevidence to the claim that Alexander was gay, many point to his many marriages to women and the children he had with them. Over the course of his brief life, Alexander married Roxana, Stateira, and Parysatis. And it\u2019s not 100% definite that all of them were committed partners of his. Alexander\u2019s sole known child, Alexander IV, was born to his Bactrian wife, Roxana, after his death in 323 BC. Historians have speculated that Stateira could have been pregnant when she died.\n\nAlexander\u2019s Sexual Orientation Explained by the Cultural Aspect of Greeks\n\nMales often had intimate, sexual connections with other men in ancient Greek society. Such pairings weren\u2019t automatically seen as signs of gay or bisexual orientation, but rather as a natural part of life. Because of this, it\u2019s crucial to think about how the ideas and customs of the period affected Alexander\u2019s personal connections. These close friendships often characterized ancient Greek society, and that\u2019s why there wasn\u2019t always sexual tension between them.\n\nWas Alexander the Great Gay or Straight?\n\nHistorical accounts indicate that Alexander had a voracious sexual appetite and a constant presence of women in his life. As he grew older, he reportedly indulged in the company of concubines every night. In conclusion, it is impossible to state with certainty whether or not Alexander the Great was gay or even bisexual, despite evidence suggesting he had intimate ties with men.

Alexander seems to more or less, maybe, possibly think so, as it features a \u201cromance\u201d of sorts between Colin Farrell as the curly-haired Macedonian conqueror and Jared Leto as his long-haired right-hand man, Hephaestion.\n\nThe Alexander-Hephaestion connection\n\nSo, was Alexander the Great gay or not?\n\nDespite what the Greek attorneys claim, historians themselves aren\u2019t sure whether he was sexually attracted to men, women, both, or whatever else.\n\nHis three wives notwithstanding, Alexander did enjoy an intimate relationship \u2013 how intimate remains a topic of dispute \u2013 with his right-hand man, Macedonian nobleman Hephaestion (ca. 356 BCE \u2013 324 BCE), played by Jared Leto in Stone\u2019s film.\n\nIn The History of Alexander, Roman \u201chistorian\u201d Quintus Curtius Rufus (possibly a nom de plume, ca. 1st-century CE) thus describes the Alexander-Hephaestion relationship:\n\n\u201cHephaestion was by far the dearest of all the king\u2019s friends; he had been brought up with Alexander and shared all his secrets. No other person was privileged to advise the king as candidly as he did, and yet he exercised that privilege in such a way that it seemed granted by Alexander rather than claimed by Hephaestion. While he was the king\u2019s age, in stature he was his superior, and so the [local Persian] queens took him to be the king and did obeisance before him after their manner. Whereupon some of the captive eunuchs pointed out the real Alexander, and Sisigambis [mother of Darius III of Persia] flung herself at his feet, apologizing for not recognizing him on the ground she had never before seen him. Raising her with his hand, Alexander said \u2018My lady, you made no mistake. This man is Alexander too.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Greek historian Arrian of Nicomedia (ca. 86 CE \u2013 ca. 160 CE) adds that at the time of Hephaestion\u2019s death at age 32 (possibly from typhoid fever), Alexander \u201cflung himself on the body of his friend and lay there nearly all day long in tears, and refused to be parted from him until he was dragged away by force.\u201d\n\nEight months later, the 32-year-old Alexander would himself be dead possibly after contracting either typhoid fever or malaria.\n\n\u2018Natural\u2019 homoeroticism\n\nSomething else: Unlike many (most?) modern Greeks (and others elsewhere) and long before the publication of Alfred Kinsey, Wardell B.

The king of France, one of Cordelia\u2019s suitors, chooses to marry her despite her father\u2019s casting her away. Lear tells his daughters Goneril and Regan that they and their husbands should divide his powers and revenues; he himself will keep a hundred knights and will live with Goneril and Regan by turns.\n\nEnter Kent, Gloucester, and Edmund.\n\nKENT\n\n0001\n\n0002\n\nGLOUCESTER\n\n0003\n\n0004\n\n0005\n\n5\n\n\u27e8\n\n\u27e9\n\n0006\n\n0007\n\nKENT\n\n0008\n\nGLOUCESTER\n\n0009\n\n0010\n\n10\n\n0011\n\nKENT\n\n0012\n\nGLOUCESTER\n\n0013\n\n0014\n\n0015\n\n15\n\n0016\n\nKENT\n\n0017\n\n0018\n\nGLOUCESTER\n\n0019\n\n0020\n\n20\n\n0021\n\n0022\n\n0023\n\np. 9\n\n0024\n\n0025\n\n25\n\nEDMUND\n\n0026\n\nGLOUCESTER\n\n0027\n\n0028\n\nEDMUND\n\n0029\n\nKENT\n\n0030\n\n30\n\nEDMUND\n\n0031\n\nGLOUCESTER\n\n0032\n\n0033\n\n(Sennet.)\n\nEnter King Lear, Cornwall, Albany, Goneril, Regan,\n\nCordelia, and Attendants.\n\nLEAR\n\n0034\n\n0035\n\n35\n\nGLOUCESTER\n\n0036\n\nHe exits.\n\nLEAR\n\n0037\n\n0038\n\n\u231c He is handed a map. \u231d\n\n0039\n\n0040\n\n40\n\n0041\n\n0042\n\n[\n\n0043\n\n0044\n\n0045\n\n45\n\n0046\n\n0047\n\n0048\n\n]\n\n0049\n\n\u27e8\n\n\u27e9\n\n0050\n\n50\n\n0051\n\n0052\n\n0053\n\n0054\n\n[\n\np. 11\n\n0055\n\n55\n\n]\n\n0056\n\n0057\n\n0058\n\n0059\n\nGONERIL\n\n0060\n\n60\n\n0061\n\n0062\n\n0063\n\n0064\n\n0065\n\n65\n\n0066\n\n0067\n\nCORDELIA\n\n, \u231c aside \u231d\n\n0068\n\nLEAR\n\n, \u231c pointing to the map \u231d\n\n0069\n\n0070\n\n70\n\n[\n\n0071\n\n]\n\n0072\n\n\u27e8\n\n\u27e9\n\n0073\n\n0074\n\n0075\n\n75\n\n\u27e8\n\n\u27e9\n\nREGAN\n\n0076\n\n0077\n\n0078\n\n0079\n\n0080\n\n80\n\n0081\n\n0082\n\n\u27e8\n\n\u27e9\n\n0083\n\n0084\n\nCORDELIA\n\n, \u231c aside \u231d\n\n0085\n\n85\n\n0086\n\n0087\n\np. 13\n\nLEAR\n\n0088\n\n0089\n\n0090\n\n90\n\n0091\n\n0092\n\n0093\n\n[\n\n0094\n\n]\n\n0095\n\n95\n\nCORDELIA\n\n0096\n\n[ LEAR\n\n0097\n\nCORDELIA\n\n0098\n\n]\n\nLEAR\n\n0099\n\nCORDELIA\n\n0100\n\n100\n\n0101\n\n0102\n\nLEAR\n\n0103\n\n0104\n\nCORDELIA\n\n0105\n\n105\n\n0106\n\n0107\n\n0108\n\n0109\n\n0110\n\n110\n\n0111\n\n0112\n\n0113\n\n0114\n\n0115\n\n115\n\n\u27e8\n\n\u27e9\n\nLEAR\n\n0116\n\nCORDELIA\n\n0117\n\nLEAR\n\n0118\n\nCORDELIA\n\n0119\n\np. 15\n\nLEAR\n\n0120\n\n120\n\n0121\n\n0122\n\n\u231c\n\n\u231d\n\n0123\n\n0124\n\n0125\n\n125\n\n0126\n\n0127\n\n0128\n\n0129\n\n0130\n\n130\n\n0131\n\n0132\n\n0133\n\nKENT\n\n0134\n\nLEAR\n\n0135\n\n135\n\n0136\n\n0137\n\n0138\n\n\u231c To Cordelia. \u231d\n\n0139\n\n0140\n\n140\n\n0141\n\n0142\n\n\u231c An Attendant exits. \u231d\n\n0143\n\n0144\n\n0145\n\n145\n\n0146\n\n0147\n\n0148\n\n0149\n\n0150\n\n150\n\n0151\n\n0152\n\n0153\n\np. 17\n\n0154\n\n0155\n\n155\n\nKENT\n\n0156\n\n0157\n\n0158\n\n0159\n\nLEAR\n\n0160\n\n160\n\nKENT\n\n0161\n\n0162\n\n0163\n\n0164\n\n0165\n\n165\n\n0166\n\n0167\n\n0168\n\n0169\n\n0170\n\n170\n\n0171\n\n0172\n\n0173\n\nLEAR\n\n0174\n\nKENT\n\n0175\n\n175\n\n\u27e8\n\n\u27e9\n\n0176\n\n\u27e8\n\n\u27e9\n\n0177\n\n0178\n\nLEAR\n\n0179\n\nKENT\n\n0180\n\n180\n\n0181\n\nLEAR\n\n0182\n\nKENT\n\n0183\n\n0184\n\nLEAR\n\n0185\n\n185\n\np. 19\n\n[ ALBANY/CORNWALL\n\n0186\n\n]\n\nKENT\n\n0187\n\n0188\n\n0189\n\n0190\n\n190\n\nLEAR\n\n0191\n\n0192\n\n0193\n\n0194\n\n0195\n\n195\n\n0196\n\n0197\n\n0198\n\n0199\n\n0200\n\n200\n\n0201\n\n0202\n\n0203\n\nKENT\n\n0204\n\n0205\n\n205\n\n0206\n\n\u231c To Cordelia. \u231d\n\n0207\n\n0208\n\n0209\n\n\u231c To Goneril and Regan. \u231d\n\n0210\n\n210\n\n0211\n\n0212\n\n0213\n\nHe exits.\n\nFlourish.

I have so often blushed to acknowledgehim that now I am brazed to \u2019t.I cannot conceive you.Sir, this young fellow\u2019s mother could,whereupon she grew round-wombed and had indeed,sir, a son for her cradle ere she had a husbandfor her bed. Do you smell a fault?I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of itbeing so proper.But I have a son, sir, by order of law,some year elder than this, who yet is no dearer inmy account. Though this knave came somethingsaucily to the world before he was sent for, yet washis mother fair, there was good sport at his making,and the whoreson must be acknowledged.\u2014Do youknow this noble gentleman, Edmund?No, my lord.My lord of Kent. Remember him hereafteras my honorable friend.My services to your Lordship.I must love you and sue to know you better.Sir, I shall study deserving.He hath been out nine years, and away heshall again. The King is coming.Attend the lords of France and Burgundy,Gloucester.I shall, my lord. Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.\u2014Give me the map there.Know that we have dividedIn three our kingdom, and \u2019tis our fast intentTo shake all cares and business from our age,Conferring them on younger strengths,while weUnburdened crawl toward death. Our son ofCornwallAnd you, our no less loving son of Albany,We have this hour a constant will to publishOur daughters\u2019 several dowers, that future strifeMay be prevented now.Thetwo greatprinces, France and Burgundy,Great rivals in our youngest daughter\u2019s love,Long in our court have made their amorous sojournAnd here are to be answered. Tell me, mydaughters\u2014Since now we will divest us both of rule,Interest of territory, cares of state\u2014Which of you shall we say doth love us most,That we our largest bounty may extendWhere nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,Our eldest born, speak first.Sir, I love you more than word can wield thematter,Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty,Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare,No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honor;As much as child e\u2019er loved, or father found;A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable.Beyond all manner of so much I love you.What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent.Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,With shadowy forestsand with champains riched,With plenteous riversand wide-skirted meads,We make thee lady. To thine and Albany\u2019sissueBe this perpetual.\u2014What says our seconddaughter,Our dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall?Speak.I am made of that self mettle as my sisterAnd prize me at her worth. In my true heartI find she names my very deed of love;Only she comes too short, that I professMyself an enemy to all other joysWhich the most precious square of sensepossesses,And find I am alone felicitateIn your dear Highness\u2019 love.Then poor Cordelia!And yet not so, since I am sure my love\u2019sMore ponderous than my tongue.To thee and thine hereditary everRemain this ample third of our fair kingdom,No less in space, validity, and pleasureThan that conferred on Goneril.\u2014Now, our joy,Although our last and least, to whose young loveThe vines of France and milk of BurgundyStrive to be interessed,what can you say to drawA third more opulent than your sisters\u2019? Speak.Nothing, my lord.Nothing?Nothing.Nothing will come of nothing. Speak again.Unhappy that I am, I cannot heaveMy heart into my mouth. I love your MajestyAccording to my bond, no more nor less.How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,Lest you may mar your fortunes.Good my lord,You have begot me, bred me, loved me.I return those duties back as are right fit:Obey you, love you, and most honor you.Why have my sisters husbands if they sayThey love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,That lord whose hand must take my plight shallcarryHalf my love with him, half my care and duty.Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,To love my father all.But goes thy heart with this?Ay, my good lord.So young and so untender?So young, my lord, and true.Let it be so. Thy truth, then, be thy dower,For by the sacred radiance of the sun,Themysteriesof Hecate and the night,By all the operation of the orbsFrom whom we do exist and cease to be,Here I disclaim all my paternal care,Propinquity, and property of blood,And as a stranger to my heart and meHold thee from this forever. The barbarousScythian,Or he that makes his generation messesTo gorge his appetite, shall to my bosomBe as well neighbored, pitied, and relievedAs thou my sometime daughter.Good my liege\u2014Peace, Kent.Come not between the dragon and his wrath.I loved her most and thought to set my restOn her kind nursery. Hence and avoidmy sight!\u2014So be my grave my peace as here I giveHer father\u2019s heart from her.\u2014Call France. Who stirs?Call Burgundy. Cornwall andAlbany,With my two daughters\u2019 dowers digest the third.Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.I do invest you jointly with my power,Preeminence, and all the large effectsThat troop with majesty. Ourself by monthly course,With reservation of an hundred knightsBy you to be sustained, shall our abodeMake with you by due turn. Only we shall retainThe name and all th\u2019 addition to a king.The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,Belov\u00e8d sons, be yours, which to confirm,This coronet part between you.Royal Lear,Whom I have ever honored as my king,Loved as my father, as my master followed,As my great patron thought on in my prayers\u2014The bow is bent and drawn. Make from the shaft.Let it fall rather, though the fork invadeThe region of my heart. Be Kent unmannerlyWhen Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?Think\u2019st thou that duty shall have dread to speakWhen power to flattery bows? To plainness honor\u2019sboundWhen majesty falls to folly. Reserve thy state,And in thy best consideration checkThis hideous rashness. Answer my life myjudgment,Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least,Nor are those empty-hearted whose low soundsReverb no hollowness.Kent, on thy life, no more.My life I never held but aspawnTo wage against thine enemies,norfear to loseit,Thy safety being motive.Out of my sight!See better, Lear, and let me still remainThe true blank of thine eye.Now, by Apollo\u2014Now, by Apollo, king,Thou swear\u2019st thy gods in vain.O vassal! Miscreant!Dear sir, forbear.Kill thy physician, and thy fee bestowUpon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,Or whilst I can vent clamor from my throat,I\u2019ll tell thee thou dost evil.Hear me, recreant; on thine allegiance, hear me!That thou hast sought to make us break our vows\u2014Which we durst never yet\u2014and with strained prideTo come betwixt our sentence and our power,Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,Our potency made good, take thy reward:Five days we do allot thee for provisionTo shield thee from disasters of the world,And on the sixth to turn thy hated backUpon our kingdom. If on the tenth day followingThy banished trunk be found in our dominions,The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,This shall not be revoked.Fare thee well, king. Sith thus thou wilt appear,Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.The gods to their dear shelter takethee, maid,That justly think\u2019st and hast most rightly said.And your large speechesmay your deeds approve,That good effects may spring from words of love.\u2014Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu.He\u2019ll shape his old course in a country new.Here\u2019s France and Burgundy, my noble lord.My lord of Burgundy,We first address toward you, who with this kingHath rivaled for our daughter. What in the leastWill you require in present dower with her,Or cease your quest of love?Most royal Majesty,I crave no more than hath your Highness offered,Nor will you tender less.Right noble Burgundy,When she was dear to us, we did hold her so,But now her price is fallen. Sir, there she stands.If aught within that little seeming substance,Or all of it, with our displeasure piecedAnd nothing more, may fitly like your Grace,She\u2019s there, and she is yours.I know no answer.Will you, with those infirmities she owes,Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,Dowered with our curse and strangered with ouroath,Take her or leave her?Pardon me, royal sir,Election makes not up in such conditions.Then leave her, sir, for by the power that made meI tell you all her wealth.\u2014For you, great king,I would not from your love make such a strayTo match you where I hate. Therefore beseech youT\u2019 avert your liking a more worthier wayThan on a wretch whom Nature is ashamedAlmost t\u2019 acknowledge hers.This is most strange,That she whom even but now was yourbestobject,The argument of your praise, balm of your age,The best, the dearest, should in this trice of timeCommit a thing so monstrous to dismantleSo many folds of favor. Sure her offenseMust be of such unnatural degreeThat monsters it, or your forevouched affectionFall into taint; which to believe of herMust be a faith that reason without miracleShould never plant in me.I yet beseech your Majesty\u2014If for I want that glib and oily artTo speak and purpose not, since what IwellintendI\u2019ll do \u2019t before I speak\u2014that you make knownIt is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,No unchaste action or dishonored stepThat hath deprived me of your grace and favor,But even for want of that for which I am richer:A still-soliciting eye and such a tongueThat I am glad I have not, though not to have itHath lost me in your liking.Better thouHadst not been born than not t\u2019 have pleased mebetter.Is it but this\u2014a tardiness in natureWhich often leaves the history unspokeThat it intends to do?\u2014My lord of Burgundy,What say you to the lady? Love\u2019s not loveWhen it is mingled with regards that standsAloof from th\u2019 entire point. Will you have her?She is herself a dowry.Royal king,Give but that portion which yourself proposed,And here I take Cordelia by the hand,Duchess of Burgundy.Nothing. I have sworn. I am firm.I am sorry, then, you have so lost a fatherThat you must lose a husband.Peace be withBurgundy.Since that respect and fortunes are his love,I shall not be his wife.Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich being poor;Most choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised,Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon,Be it lawful I take up what\u2019s cast away.Gods, gods! \u2019Tis strange that from their cold\u2019stneglectMy love should kindle to enflamed respect.\u2014Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to mychance,Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France.Not all the dukes of wat\u2019rish BurgundyCan buy this unprized precious maid of me.\u2014Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind.Thou losest here a better where to find.Thou hast her, France. Let her be thine, for weHave no such daughter, nor shall ever seeThat face of hers again. ThereforebegoneWithout our grace, our love, our benison.\u2014Come, noble Burgundy.Bid farewell to your sisters.The jewels of our father, with washed eyesCordelia leaves you. I know you what you are,And like a sister am most loath to callYour faults as they are named. Love well ourfather.To your profess\u00e8d bosoms I commit him;But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,I would prefer him to a better place.So farewell to you both.Prescribe not us our duty.Let your studyBe to content your lord, who hath received youAt Fortune\u2019s alms. You have obedience scantedAnd well are worth the want that you have wanted.Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides,Who covers faults at last with shame derides.Well may you prosper.Come, my fair Cordelia.Sister, it is not little I have to say of whatmost nearly appertains to us both. I think ourfather will hence tonight.That\u2019s most certain, and with you; next monthwith us.You see how full of changes his age is; theobservation we have made of it hathnotbeenlittle. He always loved our sister most, and withwhat poor judgment he hath now cast her offappears too grossly.\u2019Tis the infirmity of his age. Yet he hath everbut slenderly known himself.The best and soundest of his time hath beenbut rash.

After Zauditu\u2019s death, he was crowned emperor of Ethiopia on November 2, 1930, and took the name Haile Selassie I (\u201cMight of the Trinity\u201d).\n\nAs emperor of Ethiopia (1930\u201374), Haile Selassie I was known for modernizing his country, for helping to establish the Organization of African Unity (now the African Union ) in 1963, for his exile (1936\u201341), and for being overthrown in 1974. He was also regarded as the messiah of the African race by many Rastas .\n\nHaile Selassie I (born Tafari Makonnen) was the emperor of Ethiopia from 1930 to 1974, although he was in exile from 1936 to 1941 after Italy invaded the country. Prior to being emperor, he served as regent from 1916 to 1930.\n\nHaile Selassie I, original name Tafari Makonnen, (born July 23, 1892, near Harer, Ethiopia\u2014died August 27, 1975, Addis Ababa), emperor of Ethiopia from 1930 to 1974 who sought to modernize his country and who steered it into the mainstream of post-World War II African politics. He brought Ethiopia into the League of Nations and the United Nations and made Addis Ababa the major centre for the Organization of African Unity (now African Union).\n\nTafari was a great-grandson of Sahle Selassie of Shewa (Shoa) and a son of Ras (Prince) Makonnen, a chief adviser to Emperor Menilek II. Educated at home by French missionaries, Tafari at an early age favourably impressed the emperor with his intellectual abilities and was promoted accordingly. As governor of Sidamo and then of Harer province, he followed progressive policies, seeking to break the feudal power of the local nobility by increasing the authority of the central government\u2014for example, by developing a salaried civil service. He thereby came to represent politically progressive elements of the population. In 1911 he married Wayzaro Menen, a great-granddaughter of Menilek II.\n\nBritannica Quiz African Leaders: Part Two\n\nWhen Menilek II died in 1913, his grandson Lij Yasu succeeded to the throne, but the latter\u2019s unreliability and his close association with Islam made him unpopular with the majority Christian population of Ethiopia. Tafari became the rallying point of the Christian resistance, and he deposed Lij Yasu in 1916. Zauditu, Menilek II\u2019s daughter, thereupon became empress in 1917, and Ras Tafari was named regent and heir apparent to the throne.\n\nWhile Zauditu was conservative in outlook, Ras Tafari was progressive and became the focus of the aspirations of the modernist younger generation. In 1923 he had a conspicuous success in the admission of Ethiopia to the League of Nations. In the following year he visited Jerusalem, Rome, Paris, and London, becoming the first Ethiopian ruler ever to go abroad. In 1928 he assumed the title of negus (\u201cking\u201d), and, two years later, when Zauditu died, he was crowned emperor (November 2, 1930) and took the name of Haile Selassie (\u201cMight of the Trinity\u201d). In 1931 he promulgated a new constitution, which strictly limited the powers of Parliament. From the late 1920s on, Haile Selassie in effect was the Ethiopian government, and, by establishing provincial schools, strengthening the police forces, and progressively outlawing feudal taxation, he sought to both help his people and increase the authority of the central government.\n\nWhen Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935, Haile Selassie led the resistance, but in May 1936 he was forced into exile. He appealed for help from the League of Nations in a memorable speech that he delivered to that body in Geneva on June 30, 1936. With the advent of World War II, he secured British assistance in forming an army of Ethiopian exiles in the Sudan. British and Ethiopian forces invaded Ethiopia in January 1941 and recaptured Addis Ababa several months later. Although he was reinstated as emperor, Haile Selassie had to recreate the authority he had previously exercised. He again implemented social, economic, and educational reforms in an attempt to modernize Ethiopian government and society on a slow and gradual basis.\n\nThe Ethiopian government continued to be largely the expression of Haile Selassie\u2019s personal authority. In 1955 he granted a new constitution giving him as much power as the previous one. Overt opposition to his rule surfaced in December 1960, when a dissident wing of the army secured control of Addis Ababa and was dislodged only after a sharp engagement with loyalist elements.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

His rule in Ethiopia continued until 1974, at which time famine, worsening unemployment, and the political stagnation of his government prompted segments of the army to mutiny. They deposed Haile Selassie and established a provisional military government, the Derg, which espoused Marxist ideologies. Haile Selassie was kept under house arrest in his own palace, where he spent the remainder of his life. Official sources at the time attributed his death to natural causes, but evidence later emerged suggesting that he had been strangled on the orders of the military government.\n\nHaile Selassie was regarded as the messiah of all Black people by the Rastafarian movement."}]}
