His career has been a string of interesting stories, celebrity encounters and time spent with Paul W. Klipsch (PWK). Let\u2019s start from the beginning\u2026\n\nJoe was born November 2, 1927 in Shreveport, Louisiana. He attended Centenary College in Shreveport, as well as Louisiana Tech in Ruston, LA, and Texas Western in El Paso, TX (now UT El Paso).\n\nJoe began drumming all the way back in grade school. In those days, the Shreveport schools did not have a junior high. Elementary graduates went directly to high school. There was a push to prepare these elementary students for high school music programs. Joe\u2019s first music teacher was a type of \u201ccircuit teacher\u201d \u2013 one that makes the rounds. He had just graduated from college and he admitted to Joe \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about drums at all, about how to play, but I know how to teach it.\u201d He gave Joe a book and told him: \u201cDo what it says here and I\u2019ll be back next week and check on you.\u201d\n\nJoe practiced from the book\u2019s instructions the whole week, and when the teacher came back, Joe had learned a great deal. Joe continued the year in this manner very successfully. There were three levels of bands in high school. Joe was admitted to the A level.\n\nJoe\u2019s first brush with celebrity occurred when he was only 10 years old. His father was a builder and built their family home on Scoville Court. Across the street, on Dalzell, lived \u201cBubba\u201d Broyles, owner of a profitable music store. It was the gathering place for local and transient musicians. He had a fine home and also owned the house next door, which he would occasionally offer to hard-up musicians who needed a place to stay.\n\nPud Brown, a tenor sax man of some repute, was there at the time, and he was a close friend of Louis Armstrong. Louis was having trouble dealing with threats from the owner of a Chicago nightclub. It seems that Louis had received a better offer from another club and gave the owner his two-week\u2019s notice. He called his old buddy, Pud Brown, and was invited to Shreveport to use the \u201csleepin\u2019 porch\u201d until things cooled down. Bubba gave his OK and Louis felt safe there.\n\nJoe said, \u201cI awoke to the sound of Louis\u2019 trumpet and followed the sound to the sleepin\u2019 porch. There sat Satchmo\u2019 himself, smiling and playing his horn.\u201d Of course \u201cJim Crow\u201d was the order of the day in the Deep South, but Louis felt safe there because Bubba and Pud were his friends. Joe continued, \u201cI had recently seen him in a movie short featuring Louis and his band, and I was fascinated by the man. He played for me and soon there were half-a-dozen other kids lined up at the door, equally wide-eyed. Bubba came over to get Louis and take him down to his store in the entrance of the Inn Hotel. I spent the afternoon listening and talking to Louis. I kept calling him Lou-ee until he corrected me, saying, \u201cJoe, mah name, spelled L-O-U-I-S, not L-O-U-E-E! Say it: Lou-ISS.\u201d\n\nI have forever after called him LouISS. The last time I saw Louis, he and his band were featured in a performance at Shreveport\u2019s Municipal Auditorium. He had \u201cBig Sid\u201d Catlett, one of our finest, playing drums. Sid played a fabulous drum solo and dedicated it to me, a 14-year-old kid with tears in his eyes.\u201d\n\nWorld War II was only months away when Joe got a job in Shreveport playing in a \u201clow-down honky-tonk band.\u201d His parents never paid much attention to his musical activities and knew nothing of his job, which paid $100.00 a week. At the time, this was more than many executives in Shreveport made. Joe saved his money and opened a bank account, which soon grew into the thousands.\n\nRiding home on a city bus one afternoon, Joe noticed a new Packard in front of a house with a sign on the windshield: \u201cBuy this car for $300.00, I have been drafted into the army, Must Sell.\u201d Joe hopped off the bus, rang the doorbell, looked at the car, drove it around the block and paid $300 cash.\n\nHis parents were astonished when he drove the car home and they asked him where the money came from. They both drove \u201cmere Dodges.\u201d This also prompted his mother to find a good, tough military academy. Schools with a military mission were becoming popular because of the looming certainty of war.\n\nThey decided on a military school in Gulfport, MS. When the family car arrived, a sign greeted them: \u201cSend us the boy and we will return you the man.\u201d It proved to be the low point in Joe\u2019s life. He said it was like being in jail with a bunch of little boys from Mississippi, all being treated like prisoners. It even involved hazing from upper classmen that escalated. Joe credits the presence of his drums for \u201csaving his life\u201d and sanity. After a year or so, around 16 years of age, he \u201cescaped in broad daylight\u201d by taking a bus about 60 miles to New Orleans. He went straight to the musician\u2019s union, signed up and had a job offer in a matter of hours. They kept him busy with good jobs that paid well and put him in association with a variety of celebrities.\n\nThese celebrities included Rosemary Clooney, Earl \u201cFatha\u201d Hines and Candy Candido. The latter was a comic personality who had done many voice-overs, including work in the movie \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d After this months-long tour concluded, the union recommended Joe to an all-girl band that had lost its drummer.\n\nMickey Stevens was the leader of the ten-member group. In order to maintain its all-girl status, the press releases said \u201cAll girl band. Featuring Joe Holland on drums.\u201d \u201cWe worked well together,\u201d said Joe, \u201cWe had a great time playing fancy resort hotels in Mississippi, Alabama and Florida before Mickey found a fine female drummer.\u201d\n\nAfter their tearful goodbyes, Joe moved on to a luxury hotel in Kansas City for the drum spot in a Mickey Mouse Band. Translation: very corny music but even higher pay scales, plus room and board were on the house! Just for kicks, he dropped in on some of Kansas City\u2019s top jazz clubs.\n\nJoe got to sit in with the likes of Count Basie, Earl Hines and many other greats of the day. However, he would not be able to work with black musicians again until his army days. That would come in 1957, the night after the 101st Airborne\u2019s occupation of Central High School in Little Rock. It was the night he met the great Art Porter Sr. at a club in downtown Little Rock.\n\nJoe Holland v01Joe will never forget the feeling of working with such a great jazz personality. \u201cArt should have been an internationally known pianist, but he did not want to leave Little Rock and his children,\u201d said Joe. His son, Art Porter, Jr. became known internationally for his skill with the alto saxophone.\n\nOne of his early jobs in 1944 was in a \u201chillbilly band\u201d for Jimmie Davis\u2019 run for Louisiana governor. Joe says it was just by luck that Davis secured the \u201cworld\u2019s greatest guitarist,\u201d Snoozer Quinn. Joe and Snoozer became personal friends and worked together several times. Snoozer taught Joe one of his greatest lessons, how to integrate his skills with other band members. They continued playing Davis\u2019 rallies right up to a successful election.\n\nAs soon as he was ensconced in office, Governor Davis left his advisors in charge while he made a beeline to Hollywood, where he starred in some of the worst movies ever made. There were two other notable musicians in the Jimmie Davis Band: brothers Hoke and Paul Rice. They wrote one of the greatest country music songs of all time, \u201cYou Are My Sunshine.\u201d This beautiful, sentimental ballad was shopped around to top country singers of the day, but no one recorded it. The boys needed money so badly that they sold the song to Jimmie Davis for a mere twenty-five dollars!\n\nThe rest, as they say, is history.\n\nDavis recorded the tune and both he and the song became instant hits, selling in the hundreds of thousands. Davis listed himself as the composer of the song and wouldn\u2019t pay anything more to the Rice brothers.\n\n\u201cIn 1946, just before I left New Orleans I got to spend five days working with The Three Stooges when they were booked into the St. Charles Theatre. Curly had had a stroke, Moe was worn out and Larry Fine had been cheated out of most of the money he was due from the movie company they worked for.\n\nThey did very little hitting and spent most of their time on stage singing! They were very good at that. I was on stage with them, using the bass drum pedal to enliven their stomping around on stage and providing sound effects with Korean temple blocks to provide sound for what little hitting they did do. Just a few months later I saw Curly\u2019s obit in the paper,\u201d Joe said.\n\nIn 1960, Joe found himself working in another \u201ccolorful\u201d Louisiana governor\u2019s race. This time it was with Earl Long. Earl had carried on an embarrassing tryst with a stripper named Blaze Starr. The band didn\u2019t see much of Ol\u2019 Earl. The routine was to get to the dusty towns first, set up on the rail freight platform, play and draw a crowd. As soon as they saw the white Chevy sedan they\u2019d load up and move on to the next town. Joe said, \u201cThese things started mid-morning and continued until around 5 pm. The old boy was a trooper, as long as he had his glass of \u201camber colored liquid.\u201d\n\nIn 1967, Joe broke with his tradition of Louisiana governor\u2019s races and worked with the future governor of Arkansas, Winthrop Rockefeller. This was Rockefeller\u2019 third and most difficult run. Joe provided the musical background for all of his commercials and 33 rallies around the state. Johnny Cash and Cal Perkins appeared at many of those rallies. On several occasions when Johnny\u2019s drummer failed to show up, guess who sat in? Much later, in 1980, Joe worked with Frank White in his campaign that unseated Bill Clinton as governor of Arkansas. Initially, Frank was still wearing his tired plaid \u201ccountry boy\u201d suits and work shoes. Joe ended up being Frank\u2019s advisor on how to dress for success.\n\nThe music business has been a central part of Joe\u2019s life for over 70 years. However, Joe has held several \u201cday jobs,\u201d mostly in sales positions. According to Joe, \u201cMusic was always been something I was trying to escape from. The minute I\u2019d escape, I couldn\u2019t stand it. I had to go back and play. As a young musician, I received a lot of advice from older, experienced musicians. They always said to have a back-up plan.\u201d Joe explained that the dependency of the music business on the liquor business must be recognized. \u201cOnce a club starts to fail\u2026the first thing they do is lay off musicians.\u201d\n\nJoe\u2019s first day job was with Revlon, representing the Louisiana area and continuing over to Dallas, Texas. This put him in contact with Neiman-Marcus, a company Joe paid careful attention to, learning a lot of the fundamentals. At the time there were many popular quiz shows, one of which was sponsored by Revlon. There was some cheating involved in the show, and it really hurt Revlon.\n\nJoe\u2019s next job was with Playtex covering a bigger area for two to three years. The pressure for greater sales was intense so Joe moved to Yardley of London. This was a great job, including trips to Great Britain and Europe. Yardley\u2019s head executive in London had a daughter who married a businessman in Little Rock. Through this connection, Joe managed to meet him and escorted him on a visit to Little Rock. When Joe took him to the airport the man asked, \u201cIs there anything I can do for you?\u201d Joe asked him for a job in London.\n\nUnfortunately, the British did not look kindly on giving their jobs to foreigners. However after some consideration, it was worked out that Joe would come over as a consultant, for which Joe admits he was not qualified. The British stint included trips to Paris, Belgium, and a several-week-long trip in 1970 to Russia. He returned to the U.S., continuing to work for Yardley, until they closed their U.S. operations. Prior to this, Yardley had a practice of rewarding employees with a Cadillac. Joe got one.\n\nJoe was an early Hi-Fi buff and had naturally heard of Paul Wilbur Klipsch. Joe built his own speakers but is quick to say that they were nothing compared to what PWK was doing. In early 1955, he drove from Shreveport to Hope on the off chance that he might meet Paul. He was amazed that PWK invited him in, and later took him to lunch.\n\nPaul was \u201ceasy to meet, easy to talk to, and easy to get along with, just a great guy. I could sense that he was going to be a fun guy because I never knew what he was going to do or say.\u201d\n\nWhen Paul discovered that Joe had his drums in the car, he asked Joe to play them in a live versus recorded scenario during their first encounter. PWK said he wanted to play some records and asked Joe to bring his drums inside. He pointed a speaker right at Joe. He wanted Joe to play along with his Glen Miller music. Fortunately, Joe had just gotten out of the Army Band and knew all of the arrangements by heart!\n\nJoe played along with the recorded drummer exactly, which fascinated PWK. This exercise was conducted in the hallway of what is now Klipsch\u2019s Hope office building, with Joe not being able to see whether the source materials were records or tapes (dammit). The result was the beginning of a serious dialog on possible collaborations.\n\nShortly after, they were doing a live versus recorded demo for a large audience in an auditorium at Centenary College. Dealers and the public were invited. Curtains hid a speaker on one side and a drum set on the other. Joe would play and then a recording of Joe would be alternated. The audience was asked to identify the live performance. Several more of these demonstrations were staged.\n\nSoon Paul suggested a recording session. On the morning of June 19, 1955, Joe and the short-lived Joe Holland Quartet entered KWKH in Shreveport, Louisiana. At the same time, Elvis Presley was exiting the studio. He and his band recorded all night due to Elvis\u2019 proclivity to put five notes in a four-note bar. The band members were afraid to call him out, so they just kept telling him that they had made a mistake and needed another take. [Do not irritate Elvis!] Elvis\u2019 drummer, D.J. Fontana was a good friend of Joe\u2019s and related the events of the previous night.\n\nThe recording session lasted most of the day, but included no pictures or other documentation \u2013 just the music. All songs were recorded straight through without mixing. Playback at the studio was via a pair of Klipsch Rebels as they were small enough to fit in the back of Paul\u2019s airplane. If there were a serious mistake or flaw noted in the initial playback, the whole number would be repeated. Only a few required retakes. Extraneous noises were left in some of the recordings. One noise that was thought to be the drummer\u2019s chair squeaking was actually a pedal. Joe used a Ludwig Speed King, which has also been referred to as a \u201cSqueak King.\u201d Unfortunately, it is not known if any of the band members ever heard their finished product on Klipschorns. [Joe has not, but I plan to remedy that!] Joe had Rebels\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\nIn 1957, a second recording session was arranged with a reunited Joe Holland Quartet. Paul explained to Joe that during his demos at frequent dealer visits, many people would request a copy of the material. At the time, the KlipschTape division had just been created with the help of John Eargle. Joe recalls that John represented himself as an A&R man from RCA. As with the earlier recording session in 1955, PWK utilized a Berlant tape recorder and two widely spaced, omnidirectional Stephens microphones. The second session did not seem to impress the band like the first. A \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d mentality could have been at play.\n\nPWK and Joe remained in contact for many years. Joe knew some generals at Barksdale Air Force base. He arranged to take a General Westmoreland (the \u201clesser\u201d Westmoreland) up to Hope to visit with PWK. The General was a huge Klipsch fan, so it was somewhat amusing to see his \u201csubservient posture\u201d in Paul\u2019s presence. Joe gave at least another general the same \u201caudience with King Klipsch.\u201d Much later, PWK orchestrated, pun intended, an invitation from Arthur Fiedler for Joe to play with the Boston Pops. Unfortunately, this never materialized due at least in part to the pressure of Joe\u2019s day job.\n\nIn the 1980\u2019s PWK ran into Joe at Cajun\u2019s Wharf in Little Rock. It had been 20 years since they had seen each other but Paul instantly recognized Joe. At 88, Joe lives on the west side of Little Rock, and is still getting paid to play his drums.\n\nphoto: from website klipsch.com"}, {"url": "http://www.ivy50.com/blackHistory/story.aspx?sid=1/3/2009", "page_content": "Joe Holland\n\nHe followed the legend of his All-American father at Cornell University and, along the way, Joe Holland has become something of a legend himself. The interviewer was given the phone numbers for the ex-Cornell football star, the same guy who then graduated from Harvard Law School.\n\n\n\nCould the numbers be right? The home number was in the \"212\" area code - New York City. The work number was in the \"914\" area - in this case, White Plains in Westchester County.\n\n\n\nNow maybe the interviewer was being unfairly biased, but he thought to himself, \"Don't most New York metro lawyers do their days in the hustle and bustle, and then retreat to the burbs at night?\"\n\n\n\nNot Joe Holland.\n\n\n\nDriven by the values instilled in him by his parents, the dominant theme of Joe Holland's life has been giving something back to the community, or as he said with a Biblical reference, \"To whom much is given, much is required.\"\n\n\n\nThe story of Joe Holland begins with his father. Jerome Brud Holland was a football All-American at Cornell in the late 1930s. A March 1970 article about Brud Holland, the only one of 13 children from his family to go to college, stated it simply and sadly. \"Jerome Holland was not offered a job upon graduation; he was not even interviewed. This -- because he was black -- and American industry had no place for the educated black man in 1939.\"\n\n\n\nFaced with the unavoidable obstacle of skin color, Brud Holland chose to further his education with a masters degree from Cornell and a doctorate in sociology from the University of Pennsylvania. He began his working life as an educator, eventually holding the presidencies of two institutions of higher learning -- Delaware State College and Hampton Institute.\n\n\n\nIt was during this time that Brud Holland and his wife, Laura, began to raise a family. Joe was born in 1956, and at age seven he got his first taste of Ithaca, N.Y., attending his father's 25th Reunion. \"I remember going over to the football field and running around,\" Joe recalled. \"So I guess that was when the Big Red seed was first planted,\" he laughed. \"It was really that love of football that I remember from my childhood years. It was an early passion.\"\n\n\n\nHolland showed his talents at the Pop Warner level in Virginia. His mother still likes to tell the story of how Joe, who was the biggest and fastest player in the league, caused other parents to get together and have the rules changed. After his first year in Pop Warner, a 125-pound weight limit was enacted, and Holland no longer could play. The next athletic hurdle came Holland's way when his father became Richard Nixon's choice as U.S. Ambassador to Sweden. Joe was 13 at the time, and for three years he lived in a country where \"football\" was played with the feet. \"They put me out on the soccer field, and I kept wanting to grab the ball with my hands so the best position for me was in the goal,\" said Holland. Needless to say, he wasn't too keen on the European version of football.\n\n\n\nThe Hollands moved back to the States for Joe's junior year at Roosevelt High School in Yonkers, N.Y. Joe missed the coach-mandated preseason camp by one day, and that meant he could not start any games during his junior year. The rule may have not been too smart, but the coaching staff soon realized that getting Joe into games was. Holland played everywhere both sides of the ball -- as a junior and was dubbed the \"super sub.\"\n\n\n\nNo substitute role as a senior, however, and Joe wound up averaging more than 200 yards a game as a running back. He earned the attention of some of the top college football programs in the country -- Ohio State, Notre Dame, Penn State and Michigan. His choice came down to Michigan and Cornell, and he chose to take the athletic scholarship to Michigan.\n\n\n\n\"I have to say that I had visions of the Rose Bowl dancing in my head, but after a year there I was ready to come home,\" said Holland. \"I was the only ballplayer on the team from New York at the most competitive position -- running back. I found myself getting lost in the crowd because I was a good player, but I wasnt head-over-heels so talented that I stood out in a crowd.\"\n\n\n\n\"Coming home\" in this case meant transferring at Cornell. Because of NCAA rules, Holland had to sit out as a sophomore. A torn hamstring muscle hampered his junior season, and as a senior he was the blocking back in head coach Bob Blackman's I-formation offense. The Ivy League had a rule at the time that said a student could get an extra year of athletic eligibility while enrolled in graduate school. Holland took advantage, and the fall of 1978 became his year to shine.\n\n\n\nHe finished the year with 1,213 yards in the seven Ivy games, still the fourth-highest single-season rushing total in Ivy League history. Two games, in particular, stood out. Against Harvard, a game played in a driving rainstorm, Holland set what is still the Ivy League record for rushing attempts in a game with 55.\n\n\n\n\"I guess I wasn't aware just how much I had carried the ball. About the middle of the third quarter, my legs started cramping up,\" remembered Holland, \"and that had never happened before. I can remember after the game, [Cornell won, 25-20, on Holland's game-winning touchdown run, his fourth of the day to go with 244 yards rushing] on the bus ride back, my muscles stiffening up. And by the time we got back to Ithaca, I had to have some guys literally help me from the bus.\"\n\n\n\nThe Harvard game was the fourth of the year, and Holland's \"dream season\" came to a close with a 263-yard performance against Pennsylvania in the finale. \"My parents had been so supportive through all the low times,\" said Holland. \"They came to all the games when we were losing. The fact that we were able to turn it around and have a winning season ... it was really special.\"\n\n\n\nHolland earned third-team All-America honors from the Associated Press after he finished second in the country in rushing and scoring to Oklahoma's Billy Sims, the Heisman Trophy winner that year. He also was named Academic All-America for the second straight year.\n\n\n\nFootball was not quite finished for Holland after that big day against Penn. He played in the Japan Bowl senior all-star game and got some interest from professional teams. But the teams did not want to waste a draft pick because they knew that Holland had been accepted at Harvard Law School the previous year. Harvard allowed him to defer a year, but that wasn't going to happen again. Holland decided to forego the free agent offers and headed off to Harvard.\n\n\n\nFollowing Harvard, Holland had plenty of opportunities to \"go for the big money\" as he put it, but there was something else at work in his head. \"Growing up in the South during the 1960s -- Virginia was not right in the heart of the Civil Rights movement -- but I was exposed to the issues of the movement,\" Holland said.\" When I was making the decision about how I wanted to start my career, I wanted to make my life count for something important. As God has blessed me, I wanted to reach out and bless others.\"\n\n\n\nSo while many of his peers went off to large corporate firms, Holland moved to Harlem and opened up his own law practice. \"My motivation in going was to make a difference. There were some pressing needs that I wanted to try and meet. I decided the best way to meet those was to develop some initiatives that were responsive.\"\n\n\n\nHe established his law practice, but then he also founded a homeless shelter. Holland was quick to point out that his philosophy was not simply housing, but \"holistic housing\" housing not as an end, but as a means to restore the whole person. His HARKHOMES project continues to aid the homeless. Connected with that, he established the BETH-HARK Crisis Center for addicts and ex-offenders.\n\n\n\nHolland also created some small businesses to create employment opportunities for the community as well. Among those businesses is a Ben and Jerrys Ice Cream Store, which was featured in the Sept. 14, 1992, issue of People Magazine.\n\n\n\nThe Cornell Cooperative Extension-Harlem Literacy Project arose out of Holland's involvement as a trustee of the university. Cornell students come to Harlem in the summer to provide literacy training.\n\n\n\nAbout a year ago, Holland was approached by a not-for-profit agency to help in the production of a video series. It is a series of 10 lectures based on the practical life skills curriculum he developed at HARKHOMES to help individuals, as he says, \"move from a life of crisis to a life of self-sufficiency.\" He calls the curriculum, \"Holistic Hardware.\"\n\n\n\nIf all that werent enough, Holland was appointed by New York Governor George Pataki to serve as State Housing Commissioner in 1995 and 96. \"I came into it at a time when there was a budget deficit in New York,\" Holland said. \"The mandate that the Governor gave us was to downsize. We worked through those challenges and were able to come up with some new initiatives that ensured affordable housing was out there.\"\n\n\n\nHis political career, which meant a great deal of time away from home, was pleasantly short-circuited by his marriage in 1995 to Alisa Holland, and, later, the birth of the couples daughter, Shelby. They continue to live in Harlem, and Holland does not event mention the possibility of leaving.\n\n\n\nHolland also gets a lot of enjoyment out of his being a playwright. \"Homegrown,\" a play that he wrote based on his experiences with HARKHOMES, ran for 14 weeks in 1992 at the National Black Theater in Harlem.\n\n\n\nAnd, he is one of only three Ivy Leaguers -- Princeton's Bill Bradley and Cornell's Ellen Mayer Sabik are the others -- named to the GTE/CoSIDA Academic All-America Hall of Fame, and he remains an active member of their Speakers Bureau. This story will not end on a self-serving note, especially given the subject himself, but Holland had this to say about the Ivy League. \"I see it as the best of both worlds as far as athletics and academics.
