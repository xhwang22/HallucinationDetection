She was the family\u2019s most enthusiastic user of the backyard pool (she remembers summer days with her sister, Marya, dropping marbles into the deep end, seeing who could come up with the most).\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a Eureka moment. Tera liked swimming enough to make it a regular thing. She got pretty good at it pretty fast. The coaches on hand pressed the Van Beilens to intensify Tera\u2019s twice-a-week training schedule.\n\nBut through grade school it remained a hobby and a physical outlet, rather than an obsession.\n\nToday, Van Beilen, a distinctly unchubby 18-year-old, is headed to the London Olympics, a surprise medal contender in the 100m and 200m breaststroke.\n\nGenetics must have something to do with this. Her uncle, Wayne Van Dorp, played for the Blackhawks and the Penguins. Her cousin, Joel Reinders, is an offensive tackle with the New York Giants.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the one protecting Eli Manning. Or is it Peyton Manning? I\u2019m not sure. One of the Mannings,\u201d Van Beilen said.\n\nThe illusion of athletic effortlessness is also a family thing. Reinders played only eight games of football at any level before being signed by the Cleveland Browns.\n\nLike her gargantuan cousin, Van Beilen\u2019s progression is proof to parents everywhere that a child can master a sport without sacrificing every other thing it means to be a child.\n\n\u201cThey let me have swimming and still have school. I had both worlds,\u201d Van Beilen says.\n\nRight into high school, Van Beilen played other sports. It wasn\u2019t until age 15 that she made swimming her focus.\n\nA great many athletic stories \u2014 both amateur and pro \u2014 start precociously early and are filled with nothing from then on but practice and competition. In an extreme example, 10-year-old Alexander Ovechkin played in a hockey tournament the day after his brother died.\n\nVan Beilen went to a regular school \u2014 Oakville\u2019s Kings Christian Collegiate \u2014 rather than a sporting academy. On Friday nights, she watched Say Yes to the Dress with her mom. She went out with friends on Saturdays. She attended the birthright of all typical teens \u2014 the prom.\n\nEven after swimming became her job, she treated it like one \u2014 a Monday-to-Friday thing. However, it was an exhausting Monday to Friday thing.\n\nShe was cut a few breaks at school. Teachers would occasionally let her go out to her car and sleep through a class. Her mother, Sharon, an administrator at the school, set up a quiet room for Van Beilen to nap through her spares.\n\nShe graduated last year. She now attends Swimming Canada\u2019s branch office in Vancouver, the University of British Columbia. Five of Canada\u2019s pool Olympians were studying and training at UBC last year.\n\nA year ago, the Olympics were a dream for Van Beilen. Literally. She began having dreams about touching the wall, looking up at the clock and seeing herself qualified. She has a picture of the rings pasted over her bed at home and at school.\n\nBut that\u2019s all they were. At that point Van Beilen was ranked 18th in the world in the 100-metre event, and 23rd in the 200-metre. That put her 5th and 3rd, respectively, on Canada\u2019s depth chart in events where only two competitors qualify.\n\nIn February, hope began to turn to belief when she finished first in the 100-metre at the CIS Championships and a narrow second to UBC teammate and fellow Olympian Martha McCabe in the 200.\n\n\u201cThat was when I began to say to myself, \u2018I know I can do this\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn March, she went to the Olympic trials in Montreal. She first qualified in the 100-metre by placing second, a mild surprise. But it was her performance in the 200-metre that brought her to global attention.\n\nVan Beilen finished first in the 200-metre final, pushing third-place finisher and current world record holder Annamay Pierse off Canada\u2019s Olympic team. Her time of 2:24:03 was, at that point, the second fastest in the world this year.\n\nThe day after qualifying, she flew back to Vancouver to sit a physiology exam she had very purposely put out of her mind while she concentrated on the trials. She got a 57.\n\n\u201cMom, I got a 57!\u201d Van Beilen excitedly told her mother. Sharon was less excited.\n\nShe looks pretty excited now, snapping pictures of Star photographer Steve Russell while he takes pictures of Tera sitting on the diving board of that family pool. Sharon\u2019s wearing a Team Van Beilen t-shirt. Tera\u2019s childhood trophies are piled up in boxes in the hallway of their Oakville cottage. They\u2019ve just returned from display at Tera\u2019s grade school.\n\nFather Harry, an executive with Tim Hortons, drifts in on his lunch hour to take in the scene. The Van Beilens didn\u2019t push their daughter into sport, but they\u2019re enjoying watching her flower in that world.\n\n\u201cI think Tera likes it, too,\u201d Harry says, in that teasing way a father says things within earshot of his children.\n\n\u201cLikes what?\u201d Tera says.\n\n\u201cThe attention,\u201d Harry says.\n\n\u201cRight, dad,\u201d Tera drawls sarcastically, 18 going on 13 for just a moment. They catch each other\u2019s eye and smile. This has the feel of a family routine that\u2019s been perfected over many years.\n\nNobody made Tera Van Beilen do anything. Left to her own youthful devices, she has put herself on the cusp of something that will last long after youth has faded.\n\nRELATED\n\nProfile: Diver Jennifer Abel\n\nProfile: Swimmer Julia Wilkinson\n\nProfile: Mountain biker Catharine Pendrel\n\nProfile: Rowing\u2019s Lesley Thompson-Willie\n\nLondon Olympic quiz\n\nKEY COMPETITORS\n\nRebecca Soni, U.S.A.100 and 200 No woman in the world dominates a single stroke the way Soni dominates breaststroke. She has three Olympic medals, has held four world records and is the defending world champion at both the 100m and 200m distance. Soni is the clear favourite in both of Van Beilen\u2019s events.\n\nJessica Hardy, U.S.A.100 The world\u2019s dominant breaststroker until a doping suspension cost her an appearance in Beijing, where Soni eclipsed her. She\u2019s the defending U.S. champion at this distance and the current world record holder.\n\n\u201cOther than those two, it\u2019s pretty close afterward. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s game,\u201d says Van Beilen. \u201cWhoever can deal with the pressure at that moment can succeed. And that\u2019s one thing I think I\u2019m pretty good at.\u201d\n\nSHARE:"}, {"url": "https://olympic.ca/team-canada/tera-van-beilen/", "page_content": "Biography\n\nTera Van Beilen admits she used to have excessive dreams about making the Olympic team. Those dreams became reality in 2012 when she got as close as she could get to advancing to the 100m breaststroke final in London, losing a swim-off for the eighth spot in the final to Jamaica\u2019s Alia Atkinson. Van Beilen also competed in the 200m breaststroke after winning the event at the Canadian Trials, knocking world record holder Annamay Pierse off the Canadian Olympic team in the process. Van Beilen had competed at the inaugural Youth Olympic Games in 2010, winning three medals including gold in the 100m breaststroke. Her multi-sport competition experience includes the 2011 and 2013 Universiades, where she won a pair of silver medals in her first appearance. Van Beilen made her FINA World Championship debut in 2013. She has been part of four straight CIS championship teams with the UBC Thunderbirds.\n\nGETTING TO KNOW\u2026\n\nFamily: Parents Harry and Sharon Van Beilen\u2026 Older brother Nathan\u2026 Younger sister Marya\u2026 Uncle Wayne Van Dorp is a former NHL player\u2026 Cousin Joel Reinders is a CFL offensive lineman\u2026 Getting into the Sport: Learned to swim at age 5 in the backyard pool because she was a chubby child\u2026 Started swimming competitively at age 9\u2026 Was disqualified from her first meet for moving her toes\u2026 Outside Interests: Kinesiology major at the University of British Columbia\u2026 Enjoys baking and cooking\u2026 Played piano for 10 years\u2026 Odds and Ends: Nicknames: Teddy, TVB\u2026 Athlete ambassador for KidSport\u2026 Collects magnets during her travels\u2026 Favourite motto: Do my best, let God do the rest\u2026 Likes to eat yogurt-covered raisings before competing\u2026 Has a maple leaf tattoo on her toe, making it the last thing she sees before diving off the blocks\u2026\n\nINTERNATIONAL RESULTS\n\nFINA World Championships: 2013 \u2013 28th (100m breaststroke), 21st (200m breaststroke)\n\nYouth Olympic Games: 2010 \u2013 GOLD (100m breaststroke), SILVER (200m breaststroke), BRONZE (4x100m freestyle relay), 4th (4x100m medley relay)\n\nPan Pacific Championships: 2014 \u2013 12th (100m breaststroke), 12th (200m breaststroke)\n\nCommonwealth Games: 2014 \u2013 6th (100m breaststroke), 9th (200m breaststroke), BRONZE (4x100m medley relay)"}, {"url": "https://oakvillenews.org/oakville-community-news/international-baccalaurete-perfect-scores-three-white-oaks-secondary-school/", "page_content": "A trio of Grade 12 students from White Oaks Secondary School (WOSS) have achieved rare perfect scores in their International Baccalaureate (IB) programme. Olivia Lau, Heather Li and Harrison Thorpe all scored 45 out of 45 in all subject areas.\n\nAccording to a press release from Halton District School Board, \"the IB program is a world-recognized, two-year diploma, which provides a challenging curriculum for highly motivated students.\"\n\nHeather Li gave credit to her teachers: \u201cI\u2019m very thankful to the teachers at WOSS who I think are a large part in why we had so many perfect scores this year and in the past few years as well. I\u2019m grateful that the work we\u2019ve put in over the past two years has culminated in the scores we received, especially since almost a year and a half of our IB experience was during a pandemic.\u201d Li will be studying liberal arts at the University of Oxford in England this fall.\n\nHarrison Thorpe says, \u201cI\u2019m really excited to move to a new place and experience a different environment. Although my area of study is commerce, I hope to foster my passion for music by participating in the university\u2019s wind orchestra.\u201d Thorpe will be attending McGill University to study economics and finance.\n\nOlivia Lau, who was elected HDSB student trustees for the 2019-20 says lots of hard work went into her results. \u201cWhen I reflect upon the past two years in this rigorous program, I can\u2019t help but think of the countless late nights and all of the hard work that led up to this result.\u201d Lau will be attending McMaster University to study health sciences.\n\nRemarkably, this was not the first IB \"hat trick\" for White Oaks Secondary School. In 2018 Brian Guo, Hanson Liu and Dasha Metropolitansky also had the distinction of scoring perfect scores.\n\nErin Davidson, IB Programme Coordinator for WOSS says that \u201calong with the additional individual academic work, IB students are encouraged to get involved in their community and school, and to be physically active. Olivia, Heather and Harrison embody the spirit of the IB programme. (These) students give back to the community while attaining personal growth goals, such as taking risks and being a respectful global citizen.\u201d\n\nIn Oakville, the IB Program is offered at White Oaks by Halton Public School Board and St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Secondary School by Halton Catholic School Board.\n\nThe average test scores for IB students worldwide was 33.02 out of 45 this year."}, {"url": "https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/351607062", "page_content":

Now, in many ways, she\u2019s an icon of success for others.\n\nIt may have been back when she was five years old, benefitting from a pool in her home backyard, that a light started to trickle. One of a youngster\u2019s desire to be competitive, noticed, and having that desire to win.\n\nVan Beilen, now married and whose maiden name we will use in this feature, has many stories about her younger years in the world of arts and sports. There were those ballet lessons, playing piano and the introduction to soccer.\n\nBut it was always swimming that superseded everything else.\n\nShe eloquently described it as \u201cthat urge to stay in the pool, never get out and even, at times, want to eat dinner while in the water\u201d.\n\nThat may have been an early taste of what would lie ahead for this water baby.\n\nThere\u2019s a New York city pop band, called American Authors, known for the song \u201cThe Best Days of My Life\u201d. Listen to it. Tap your foot to the music, even sing along if you know the lyrics when you read more about Van Beilen.\n\n\u201cI had a dream so big and loud\n\nI jumped so high I touched the clouds\n\nWo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh\n\nI stretched my hands out to the sky.\u201d\n\nBest Days of My Life, American Authors\n\nIt might be a tune that she may consider attaching to her prosperous swim career.\n\nWhen mentioning the real inauguration to competitive swimming, this might surprise many. It wasn\u2019t any of the events she competed in - the Commonwealth Games, FINA World championships or even the Summer Olympics.\n\nIt all started in 2009, in Charlottetown, P.E.I., at the Canada Summer Games.\n\nCanada\u2019s national spotlight on amateur sport was where Van Beilen would begin to relish fame with a remarkable performance and go on to win six gold medals.\n\n\u201cI remember it very well and asking myself \u2013 how did I do this,\u201d she said in a recent telephone conversation. \u201cAlso, medalling at the Canadian Nationals and realizing that I was able to do more than just the breaststroke, but also compete in the relays and help my team. That was the year that started my competitive swim career.\u201d\n\nWith the beautiful Niagara Region of Ontario hosting the 2022 Canada Summer Games in August, an event that brings together some 5,000 promising athletes, a mere mention of those days brings back fond memories for Van Beilen, who has a Maple Leaf tattoo on one of her toes.\n\n\u201cThe Canada Summer Games were an incredible experience, a special time in my life and a glimpse at top level athletes in many sports,\u201d she said, while also confirming a rumour that she liked to eat yoghurt-covered raisins before competing.\n\n\u201cThings were different in my day, as you could be a National calibre athlete in those Games. But now, it\u2019s really focussed for younger kids with potential \u2013 more of a stepping stone for success, to experience and cherish the moment. It could very well be the start of something big for many.\u201d\n\nWhile she graduated from King\u2019s Christian Collegiate in Oakville, a school that now has the \u201cVan Beilen Endeavour Award\u201d given to a student who excels in arts, music, or sports outside of school, her swim keys to success started with the Oakville Aquatic Club.\n\nChoosing post-secondary education in Canada, over numerous athletic scholarship offers from schools throughout the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), Van Beilen picked the University of British Columbia.\n\nNot only did she continue her academic honors success, and left UBC with a Degree in Kinesiology, but she was on the Thunderbirds incredible swim team that won four consecutive Canadian Interuniversity Sports (now re-branded to USports) championships.\n\nThere was also the Swim Youth Olympics in Singapore, where she won three medals, that would come a year after the Canada Summer Games. One who excelled in the breaststroke, Van Beilen would add one major event after another. Then came the electrifying and emotional time in her life that she will never forget.\n\n\u201cThe Canadian Olympic Trials in Montreal, I knew when I had touched the wall that made the qualifying time needed to make Canada\u2019s team for the 2012 Games in London (England),\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine the feeling of representing your country at the Olympics.\u201d\n\nThat was the same Van Beilen, who didn\u2019t like wearing swim goggles or a bathing cap as a youngster, and preferred to sleep in on mornings devoted to swim practices. That is, until her parents asked her to make a choice between sticking with swimming and its challenges, or packing it in. Judgment time, and she picked swimming and has never looked back.\n\nBoth her parents had been athletes, an uncle played in the National Hockey League and a cousin in the Canadian and National Football Leagues, the genes were in the family.\n\nWith her competitive days eventually now having come to a close, she really hasn\u2019t bid adieu to the sport. She\u2019s now Marketing Manager for Speedo Canada, a company that inspires swimmers by offering up a brand of stylish merchandise.\n\n\u201cSwimming helped me in life and brought me so much joy,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were many times when I could laugh, cry through my goggles, release so much energy, and allow me to make friends for life.\u201d\n\n\n\nDavid Grossman is a veteran multi award-winning Journalist and Broadcaster with some of Canada\u2019s major media, including the Toronto Star and SPORTSNET 590 THE FAN, and a Public Relations professional for 45+ years in Canadian sports and Government relations."}, {"url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/a-surreal-moment-how-these-3-oakville-students-got-a-perfect-international-baccalaureate-score-1.4786764", "page_content": "Three GTA students have achieved rare perfect scores in their International Baccalaureate (IB) program, and in an equally rare twist, all are graduates of the same Oakville high school.\n\nBrian Guo, Hanson Liu and Dasha Metropolitansky all attended White Oaks Secondary School.\n\nThe two-year IB diploma program demands \"academic rigour in languages, mathematics, humanities and sciences and emphasizes personal development for students,\" according to a press release issued by the Halton District School Board.\n\n\"When I saw the number on the screen, I refreshed a couple of times just because I didn't believe it,\" said Metropolitansky.\n\n\"I definitely yelled out loud.

She opted out of competing this year due to the demands of the IB program.\n\nWatch Dasha Metropolitansky debate the appeal of Donald Trump to voters ahead of the 2016 U.S. election on CBC's The National:\n\n\"I think it's a bit crazy that only 13 students received a perfect score in North and South America in 2018, and pretty much a quarter of those came from one school, particularly a public school ... which I think is so impressive I don't think there is any private school around here that can say they have that same result,\" she said.\n\nMetropolitansky gives school staff credit for the achievement..\n\n\"The teachers do a really good job. Every single year they look at our results,how can we improve,\" she said.\n\n\"They go through the detailed feedback that they get from the International Baccalaureate program, and they try to incorporate that in their teaching, so I think it really is a testament to the IB staff at White Oaks and the group of students we had [this year].\n\n\"I know many teachers met with other IB teachers and staff from IB so that they can learn more updated information about how IB marking works, and how they can improve their teaching.\"\n\nMetropolitansky leaves for Harvard next week to begin her university studies.
