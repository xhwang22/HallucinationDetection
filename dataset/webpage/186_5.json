By the age of 14 yrs, Brian had made TV appearances and had won County, Provisional, and All Ireland Titles on Tin Whistle and Flute. It was around this time that Brian developed a keen interest in the art of Uilleann Piping, and he attended classes in the Pipers Club in Dublin for many years.\n\n\n\nOver the following years, Brian became a well-known name in the world of traditional Irish music, and in 1997 he recorded and released his debut solo album, Whistle Stop, on the Gael Linn label.\n\n\n\nBrian has also recorded on the Clo Iar Connachta label and to date has recorded 5 albums, including a beautiful Airs project with the multi-instrumentalist Garry O Briain, and also a major musical suite for Uilleann Pipes, Whistle and orchestra, which Brian composed to celebrate the 100 anniversary of Ernest Shackleton\u2019s famous Endurance voyage.\n\n\n\nBrian Hughes has recorded with the very best in traditional Irish music over the last 20 years. He has produced the greatest body of whistle music ever recorded, and he is widely regarded as being one of the finest whistle players of his generation.\n\n\n\nBrian has been teaching for many years, both privately and at the many Summer Schools across the country each Summer.\n\n\n\nIt is now 20 yrs since Brian recorded his debut album in 1997, and to celebrate this he will release a new album this October, which will contain some of the recording highlights over this time.

Featuring the evocative vocals of Caroline Lavelle and the masterful guitar work of Brian Hughes, Secret Sky weaves together a tapestry of Pop and World music with exotic textures of the Middle Eastern Oud, Puerto Rican Cuatro, and the hypnotic Greek Lyra played by a contemporary master of the Lyra, Sokratis Sinopoulos. Opium takes the listener on a remarkable musical journey accompanied by an All-Star cast of musicians. Caroline Lavelle and Brian Hughes have performed together for over 20 years when Caroline joined Brian as a member of Loreena McKennitt\u2019s recording and touring ensemble. The idea for Secret Sky was born on a shuttle ride from their hotel to the Sao Paulo airport at the end of a South American tour with Loreena in 2013. After sending numerous songs and recordings back and forth via the internet, Caroline from Cornwall, UK and Brian from Los Angeles the result was their 2016 self-titled debut album Secret Sky. Guitarist, Composer, and Producer Brian Hughes has been honored with the SOCAN / BMI Jazz & Instrumental Composer of the Year award seven times from 1997 to 2011 for his eight contemporary jazz recordings while his 36-year parallel career with Loreena McKennitt led to him receiving a Juno (Canadian Grammy) nomination as Producer of the Year for his work on her platinum-selling album, The Visit. Brian and Caroline\u2019s skills as musicians are in the foreground on Loreena\u2019s 2019 release \"Live at the Royal Albert Hall\" and on her 2012 Grammy-nominated trio recording \u201cTroubadours on the Rhine\u201d. McKennitt has sold over 15 million albums worldwide and Hughes along with Secret Sky bandmate Lavelle continue to appear together on numerous tours and recordings with Loreena. Caroline Lavelle\u2019s first foray as a vocalist was with Massive Attack, which brought her to the attention of William Orbit, who produced her first CD Spirit which garnered critical and popular acclaim. Among others, she has sung and / or played with Radiohead, Peter Gabriel, Vangelis, De Dannan, The Chieftains, Muse and The Indigo Girls. Her two other solo CDs (Brilliant Midnight and A Distant Bell) have produced songs since used on film & TV soundtracks including Six Feet Under, Joyride (John Dahl), The Eye of the Beholder (Ewan McGregor & Ashley Judd).

She has released three solo albums, collaborated with numerous international musicians, and is currently a member of the trio Secret Sky.\n\nHer career as a cello player started by chance: as a child, she\u2019d been desperate to play the violin. On the day instruments were distributed, she was at the back of the queue. As luck would have it, when it was her turn, only a bassoon and a cello were left. Choosing the latter, she went on to study at the prestigious Royal College of Music in London. After graduating, she opted out of the orchestral route, preferring to perform her own compositions. \u201cThe creativity involved in writing one\u2019s own music and having to marry lyrics and arrangements is much more challenging for me. My greatest love is writing.\u201d\n\nCaroline Lavelle in the 1980sIn the early 80\u2019s Caroline recorded with acts such as Siouxie And The Banshees and Fun Boy Three, and busked in London with a group called Humoresque, together with Anne Stephenson and Gini Ball. Frankie Gavin from De Dannan spotted her busking, leading to a stint with the band for several years until the early \u201990s. From this period onwards, Caroline worked with a wide variety of acts (Radiohead, The Cranberries, Peter Gabriel, Nigel Kennedy, Ryuichi Sakamoto, among others), and provided vocals for artists such as Vangelis and Hector Zazou. Her vocal contribution to Massive Attack\u2019s song Home Of The Whale in 1992 led to her work on the soundtrack to the film The Eye Of The Beholder.\n\nIt was Home Of The Whale that also brought her to the attention of William Orbit, who asked her to work on an album. The resulting album (Spirit, 1995) featured a mix of traditional songs and original material written by Caroline, featuring William Orbit\u2019s trademark production. It garnered critical and popular acclaim and The Times reported that it had inspired Madonna\u2019s Ray of Light album.\n\nIn 2001 she released Brilliant Midnight, an album focusing more on Caroline\u2019s skills as a songwriter and producer of her own material, organically blending her own classically inspired instrumentation with electronic arrangements. A year later, Caroline set up her own record label Ringing Tree Records, re-releasing Brilliant Midnight in a revised edition, reflecting the vision she initially had for that album.\n\nA Distant Bell followed in 2004, and was met with positive reviews. The pastoral A Distant Bell could be described as Chamber Folk, and featured original material, traditional songs, and Caroline\u2019s musical settings of Brian Patten\u2019s poetry.\n\nTogether with Justin Elswick and Israel Curtis she has released several tracks for a project entitled Spythriller. A full-length album is in the works. In 2015 Caroline formed the band Secret Sky with Brian Hughes and Hugh Marsh. Having met 20 years earlier in 1995, the three have been playing as a part of Loreena McKennitt\u2019s band ever since. Their self-titled debut album was released in 2016. The band is currently working on a follow up album.\n\nBrian Hughes\n\nLos Angeles resident Brian Hughes has carved out an impressive career in the contemporary jazz arena.

Their soon to be released debut CD \"Secret Sky\", produced by Brian Hughes is an exciting collaboration, bringing thrilling power and emotional depth to both traditional and self-penned songs. Brian Hughes and Hugh Marsh are electrifying live improvisers as anyone who has been at a Loreena McKennitt concert will testify, and this album has allowed them the freedom and space to achieve the passionate feel reminiscent of some of the expansive, filmic albums of the 70s. Caroline Lavelle\u2019s trademark sultry voice occupies a greater range than she has used to date, ranging from the intimately delicate to a powerful folk rock persona, with her emotional cello playing making up a formidable range of talents across the trio. The other player's on the CD are drummer Tal Bergman (Loreena McKennitt, Joe Bonamassa, Rod Stewart, Simple Minds, Billy Idol) and bassist Tim Landers (Loreena McKennitt, Stevie Nicks, Tori Amos, Jethro Tull, BB King).\n\n"}]}
