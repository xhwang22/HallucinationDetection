It\u2019s less common, though, that those childhood dreams manifest. And rarer still are kids like Dawn Landes, who grew up to have a career highlighted by five album and EP releases, multiple U.S. and international tours, a musical soundtrack and so much more.\n\n\u201cEver since I was young, I think from the time I could talk, I was singing,\u201d Dawn says of her Louisville, Kentucky, upbringing. \u201cI was always asking my parents to turn up the radio in the car and leafing through their record collections and memorizing all the liner notes. I was always just really interested in [music].\u201d\n\nShe recalls hearing her high school choir teacher talk about a friend who made music for film and TV as the first time she realized she could turn her passion into a profession. After graduation in 1999, Dawn moved straight to New York City to learn the skills that would enable her to bring her ideas to life.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in high school and making demos, I had to rely largely on men who had the equipment or access to a studio,\u201d she says. \u201cI just found that process a little stifling. It was frustrating to me that I didn\u2019t have the language or know-how to make changes in my own music. So, I just decided to study it and to learn how to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a traveling musician, when I go to a city, I like to find good coffee, a good vintage clothing store and a good bookstore,\u201d Dawn says. \u201cThose are the things that I always seek out.\u201d In Chatham, those favorites are Aromatic Roasters, Screaming for Vintage and McIntyre\u2019s Bookstore.\n\nAfter nearly two decades as a New York-based musician, Dawn and her composer husband, Creighton Irons, decided they wanted to raise a family closer to his native Chapel Hill. The couple moved into their home off of Manns Chapel Road on Valentine\u2019s Day in 2020, where they live with their daughter, Callan, 5, and son, Wright, 1.\n\nDawn is now focused on producing a revue, \u201cDawn Landes and Friends Reimagine The Liberated Woman\u2019s Songbook,\u201d which will debut on April 14 in Raleigh. She was inspired by the 20th-century songbook and current state of women\u2019s rights to put together a show that is both educational and uplifts other local female artists. The show will feature guest singers Rissi Palmer, Alice Gerrard, Emily Frantz of Watchhouse (formerly Mandolin Orange) and more. She also plans to personally record and release songs from \u201cThe Liberated Woman\u2019s Songbook\u201d as an album sometime next year.\n\n\u201cAs I get older, and especially [after] becoming a mother, I\u2019ve embraced my connection with my female friends and peers and colleagues much more,\u201d she says. \u201cI did so many tours where I was the only woman on the tour, and that was just the way it was. I didn\u2019t get a chance to be around a lot of women in the past, and now I do, and I feel grateful for it.\u201d\n\nDawn isn\u2019t slowing her roll anytime soon. She says she\u2019s motivated by restlessness, knowing there\u2019s always a new story to be told. This summer, she\u2019ll rerelease one of her most popular albums, \u201cBluebird,\u201d and embark on a brief tour to celebrate its 10th anniversary. You can also catch her performing at Durham\u2019s Enofest in July.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been a time when I\u2019m not thinking about something or dreaming up something,\u201d she says. \u201cPresenting songs is just another way of connecting with other people. When you hear a story, you want to retell it or reframe it because it mattered to you, and you want it to matter to other people.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://thevogue.com/artists/dawn-landes/", "page_content": "Dawn Landes (born December 5, 1980 in Louisville, Kentucky) is an American singer-songwriter and musician currently based in New York City. She is also a sometimes-member of the band Hem, where she has lent her voice to harmony vocals, and played glockenspiel. She has worked as an audio engineer at Stratosphere Sound in New York City and at Philip Glass\u2019 own personal recording studio. She has shared the stage with artists such as Josh Ritter (to whom she was married), Suzanne Vega, Jose Gonzalez, Feist, The Weakerthans, Andrew Bird, Midlake, Alexi Murdoch and many others.\n\nThe press has likened Landes to \u201cthe grand old dames of country\u201d and in the same breath The Black Keys and The White Stripes (Uncut). She\u2019s also garnered comparisons to Cat Power and Pavement, an interesting mix that made even NPR\u2019s David Dye wonder.\n\nRaised in the fertile musical fields of Branson, Missouri and Louisville, Kentucky, Landes came to New York City in 1999 and did a cannonball into the music scene. While holding down several jobs to pay the rent, she abandoned university (NYU) and began to intern at some of the best studios in the city. \u201cI had very little experience\u201d, she says. \u201cI was just really, really curious. Dangerously curious in the studio\u2026 I picked heros like Tchad Blake and Brian Wilson and took a flying leap.\u201d\n\nWhat started as a job getting coffee for engineers has blossomed into a truly enviable resume; among others she has worked with Phillip Glass, Ryan Adams, Hem, Joseph Arthur, The Earlies and Josh Ritter in the studio. Working late into the night, and often sleeping at the same studios she was interning in, Dawn began producing and recording her own songs after hours. \u201cI wanted to get the sounds in my head onto tape exactly as I heard them. And that\u2019s not an easy thing, there are a lot of sounds in there!\u201d\n\nAfter meeting the band Hem in the studio, Landes joined them on the road as an 8th band member (vocals and glockenspeil) and opening act. Her performing career started to gain speed. Her first full-length, \u00abdawn\u2019s music\u00bb was released in France in 2005, followed by extensive touring in Europe and two other European releases; \u00ab234\u00bb a 7-song EP released in the UK and finally \u00abFireproof\u00bb, released worldwide in 2007. Since then her music has become the stuff of whispers and internet buzz, and her touring schedule has put her on the road with artists such as Feist, Jose Gonzales, Midlake, Suzanne Vega, Martha Wainright, The Swell Season\u2026(the list goes on) At times solo, at times with a revolving cast of musical guests, her shows have the guileless and vibrant quality of a work of art in constant creation.\n\nLandes penned the end-credit song for the movie \u00abSavage Grace\u00bb starring Julianne Moore and plucked the WST Bluegrass band from a BBQ in Austin, TX to help her record her version of the Peter, Bjorn and John classic, \u00abYoung Folks.\u00bb Rumor has it, James Blunt liked it so much he covered dawns cover of the song! In 2007 Landes became the co-partner, designer and full-time dry-waller of Saltlands Studio in Brooklyn. \u00abWhat if we get bored?\u00bb Dawn sings in the Fireproof gem, \u00abKids in a Play.\u00bb\n\nAs a solo artist, Landes has put out a number of albums:\n\n* Dawn\u2019s Music (self-released-US/Ocean Music-Europe) 2002\n\n* two, three, four (Boy Scout recordings-UK) 2006\n\n* Fireproof (Cooking Vinyl-US/Fargo Music-Europe) 2008\n\n* Sweetheart Rodeo (Cooking Vinyl) 2010\n\nOfficial Website: www.dawnlandes.com Read more on Last.fm.

She tells TONY CLAYTON-LEAabout learning French, marrying Josh Ritter and being the girl next door\n\nWE\u2019LL forgive the excitement \u2013 Dawn Landes is about to head off into the great white yonder of the touring schedule. She is, therefore, in somewhat of a tizzy as she cancels the milk and makes sure she switches off the lights instead of switching on the immersion in her New York gaff. For some people, heading back out onto the road is akin to hitching a lift on the highway to Hell. not for Dawn.\n\n\u201cToday is frantic, but I love it, and I\u2019m so excited. I know some people think of it as a necessary evil, but the only evil part is the planning. But I love all of it, and to make it even better, this time I\u2019ve got all the guys with me. It\u2019s better that way, but it\u2019s more than that \u2013 it\u2019s being able to achieve the sound I want to get out on stage. I\u2019ve played a bunch of solo gigs, but it\u2019s more fulfilling for me musically if I can have a whole range of sounds. The music is more muscular, for a start, and I also love to see people swaying and moving around. It\u2019s fun to see that. The downside? Well, I don\u2019t do a lot of songwriting on the road, and that\u2019s maybe because I don\u2019t seem to get a lot of time alone. You\u2019re always with people, even if you\u2019re playing solo gigs, sharing hotels, cars...\u201d\n\nLandes is a Louisville, Kentucky-born singer, songwriter and audio engineer who has spent far too much of her time in the depths of recording studios to be in any way in awe of the process. This is possibly why her albums to date (2002's Dawn Music, 2006's Two, Three, Four,2008's Fireproof, and the recently released Sweet Heart Rodeo) comes with a flourishing signature, attention to detail and a heart-shaped centre. Sweet Heart Rodeo, in particular, arrives with the kind of instinctive touches that have marked Landes out as one of a kind. The back story to the album is cutely drawn (the romantic entanglements of Landes's grandmother), but with Landes involved there's got to be a twist.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nThe first is that she wrote most of the material in Paris. People-watching, city-watching. \u201cI was in Paris for the winter of 2007 \u2013 2008, for about four months. I\u2019d always romanticised the city, I suppose, and France in general. I\u2019d toured over a lot and maybe it was the challenge of not knowing what people were doing and saying. Also, I found the language so beautiful I wanted to learn it, so it was a trial by fire. I took lessons and now I can speak French \u2013 yay!\u201d\n\nDespite there being lots of accordion-based music in and around the boulevards, Landes says she was drawn more towards the musical styles of Serge Gainsbourg and Fran\u00e7ois Hardy than anyone else. She was, in fact, so taken with the city and its musical heritage that she plans to record a French-language album \u2013 just for artistic reasons.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think in commercial terms. That said, I\u2019ve had success with some TV commercials that my music has been used in. But those things more or less fall from the sky. I don\u2019t even see them coming. They\u2019re fun to do, especially if you\u2019re commissioned to do them, but I don\u2019t get anything artistically from them. I\u2019m not a very business-minded lady, which is, I suppose, good. I mean, I\u2019m not stupid about things, either \u2013 I can keep myself fed.\n\n\u201cLiving in NYC, though, it\u2019s such a struggle for most people. Everyone around me is almost in the same situation, so I don\u2019t really notice. But, then, with music, you\u2019re not supposed to think about stuff like money. It\u2019s all about freeing your mind, isn\u2019t it? I look to culture for that \u2013 movies, books, visual art.\u201d\n\nOne of the album tracks, Little Miss Holiday, is a perfect example of what Landes is talking about: it was written as a response to Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, and employs a faltering caf\u00e9 conversation between the film's child prostitute, Iris, and the teenage actor who played her \u2013 Jodi Foster.\n\n\"When I get moved by something I investigate it,\" says Landes. \"And Taxi Driverwas incredible \u2013 it kicked me out so much that I started researching the movie, and I discovered that the real Iris was actually in the film, but she wasn't credited \u2013 how about that? I also heard they met in real life, and the idea of these two people sitting at a table over a cup of coffee, not having much to say to each other, was compelling.\"\n\nIt is to Landes\u2019s credit that her narrative curves work \u2013 there is little or no sign of straining to impress, and no sign whatsoever of over-reaching her creative aims. Connection of some kind for the listener is crucial, she says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what they connect with as long as they grab onto something. Perhaps an image, or even a misheard lyric. I just love the fact that I can play music for people and get them moving, swaying around, in whatever way they want, internally or externally, all over the place.\u201d\n\nThank her family background for such a free and breezy attitude. \u201cMy brother is a jazz musician, my grandfather plays the violin, and my mom sings. This was never a profession for anyone, but I always had music around when I was growing up. Plus, I was a dancer when I was kid, and experienced lots of movement.\u201d\n\nWe hear noise in the background of her apartment in Brooklyn \u2013 it could be husband Josh Ritter mooching around (the pair married recently, and yes, they sure kept that fact hidden) or it might be the plumber coming in to disconnect the water.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s time for a last question. Landes has been described as \u201ca girl next door of the indie pop-type persuasion\u201d. Is this true or false? \u201cIt depends on what or whom I\u2019m next door to,\u201d she answers sweetly. \u201cI like a little bit of unpredictability. To me, the girl next door could be a wild girl, because we don\u2019t know much about her.\u201d\n\nSweet Heart Rodeois on release through Cooking Vinyl.

The twang in her voice comes naturally.\n\nLandes calls it a \u201clilt,\u201d but she says, \u201cpeople have always thought I had a twang in my voice, and my parents were always like, where did that come from?\u201d\n\nA native of Indiana, she grew up mostly in Kentucky; Loretta Lynn once actually came to sing at the coal mine where her father worked. After graduating from New York University, Landes stuck around in the city to become part of its folk music scene and to build a career as a producer and sound engineer.\n\n2. She\u2019s attracted to the vintage Nashville \u201ccountrypolitan\u201d sound.\n\nLandes\u2019 musical output \u2013 five albums over the past 13 years \u2013 is an eclectic assortment of indy rock, folk, and pop sounds (including an entire album sung in French). But she\u2019s always been attracted to the lush sounds and legendary artists who came out of country in the 1960s. About four years ago, with more than a little bit of Dolly\u2019s register in her voice, she came in second at an annual competition in Sevierville, Tennessee, that honors Parton\u2019s songwriting.\n\n\u201cI did it on a whim,\u201d she says. \u201cMy friend dared me to enter it.\u201d\n\nTennessee continued to beckon, and after traveling to Nashville for songwriting sessions, Landes decided a couple of years ago that she had to record her own countrypolitan album.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I was going for, but I didn\u2019t know how to get it myself,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought it would be great to work with someone who was sort of entrenched in the long-ago scene. I went straight to the source.\u201d\n\nShervin Lainez\n\n3. She talked a country legend out of semi-retirement to produce the album.\n\nDetermined to produce an authentic sound, Landes set her sights on Fred Foster, the Hall of Fame member who was pivotal in the careers of Parton, Roy Orbison and Kris Kristofferson. Now 86, Foster hadn\u2019t produced an album since 2007 \u2013 and that one featured country deities Merle Haggard and Ray Price.\n\nBoldly, Landes cold-called Foster to plead her case. So what made him say yes?\n\n\u201cPart of it was persistence on my end,\u201d she says, but she finally won him over with her songwriting skills.\n\nTogether, they spent hours polishing the songs before she ever entered the studio; Foster then assembled a who\u2019s who list of studio musicians, including Hall of Famer Charlie McCoy. Even Hall of Fame artist Bobby Bare dropped by to serve as a sly foil on a duet.\n\n4. Landes now has a bona fide Loretta Lynn connection.\n\nAfter moving to Nashville last year, Landes answered a Craigslist ad and ended up buying a blue pickup from Lynn\u2019s music director, Bart Hansen. They have since become friends, and Hansen can be seen playing guitar, over Landes\u2019 right shoulder, in the \u201cTraveling\u201d video. For that matter, the pickup is in the video, too, as well as a lyrical mention of \u201cLoretta on the radio.\u201d\n\nAt Hansen\u2019s behest, Landes recently home-recorded a video greeting to Lynn, whom Hansen visits weekly while she recuperates from a stroke and a broken hip.\n\n\u201cShe sent me one back,\u201d Landes marvels. \u201cCan you believe that? I have a video of Loretta saying hello to me and \u2018I hope you have a good day.\u2019 I love it so much.\u201d\n\nShervin Lainez\n\n5. She met her husband at music camp.\n\nOr, more formally, the prestigious Johnny Mercer Writers Colony, where both received grants in 2015 to work on full-length musicals.\n\nHusband Creighton Irons is an accomplished musical composer \u2014 and an incredibly supportive spouse who can be seen on the keyboard in the \u201cTraveling\u201d video. He also plans to join Landes on stage for at least a portion of the U.S. and European tour she\u2019ll be on through October to support the album.\n\nWhether their 1-year-old daughter, Callan, will be with them or with her grandparents has yet to be determined, but she\u2019s already well acquainted with Mom\u2019s new album. Not only has she attended recent shows, but Landes was pregnant during all of the recording sessions.\n\n\u201cShe was there the entire time, really,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope she likes it when she\u2019s older. I hope she\u2019s not like, \u2018All those songs!

Initially, she was concerned that it might feel like \u201can invasion of privacy, but I think he was delighted by it, and didn\u2019t say \u2018No\u2019 outright! I think his exact words were, \u2018send me some music and I\u2019ll see if there\u2019s something I can contribute, which was his way of saying \u2018maybe\u2019,\u201d Dawn recalls.\n\n\u201cIt took a lot of phone calls and snail mail and even driving. I was living in New York at the time [Landes has since re-located to Nashville] and had to drive the 14 hours to Nashville...and that must have impressed him.\u201d\n\nThey duly spent hours in Foster\u2019s Tennessee home; listening to Hank Williams and trading stories as Landes showed off heart-wrenching vocals and expressive songwriting. Foster's semi-retirement was at an end.\n\nLandes arrived for the recording sessions with a set of what she considered to be complete songs. Not so, according to Mr Foster. \u201cHe\u2019d say, \u2018That one has potential\u2019; \u2018this is a possibility\u2019,\u201d she recalls.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it, and the only other time that something like this happened was when I showed people my lyrics before recording them, and that was when I was at college and every Monday at the Fast Folk songwriters\u2019 exchange everyone would read the Iyrics while I sang the song.\n\n\u201cThat was a vulnerable feeling, but I did that when I was 20, at the Fast Folk gatherings at Jack Hardy\u2019s house in Greenwich Village, so that was a good experience to call on.\n\n\"I made sure not to talk politics,\" says Dawn Landes, recalling her recording sessions with legendary producer Fred Foster\n\n\u201cIt was in the era ten years after Dylan. Townes Van Zandt, Suzanne Vega, passed through Fast Folk, but by the time I did it, it had morphed into being at Jack\u2019s house.\u201d\n\nShe saw the opportunity to work with Foster as a learning experience. \u201cI learnt so much from him and his sense of judgement,\u201d says Dawn.\n\n\"He'd produced Dolly Parton's first album, but she was much younger than me, a teenager, when she made it, but I was also thinking about Joan Baez's album recorded with Fred in Nashville, working with some great Nashville musicians.\n\n\"He'd worked with her because she'd sung on Kris Kristofferson's recordings \u2013 though he didn't like her politics, so I made sure not to talk politics.\"\n\nBrought together largely by Kyle Lehning, Landes recorded Meet Me At River at the Sound Emporium studio with \"the heaviest hitters around\", as she called harmonica player Charlie McCoy, guitarist Steve Gibson, drummer Eddie Bayers, Elvis In Memphis guitarist Bobby Wood, steel guitr player Russ Pahl and bassist Larry Paxton.\n\n\"It was also Kyle's suggestion I should sing a duet [I Don't Dance] with Bobby Bare [the Ohio country singer, now aged 83], but you just had to mention Fred Foster and all these musicians were so excited to work with him again,\" says Dawn.\n\nAlong with her own songs on \"the big themes of life\", from heartbreak and wanderlust to reckoning with youth, she recorded two Jimmy Driftwood covers, The Church and What Is The Color Of The Soul Of Man, as recommended by Foster, who had produced Driftwood's records in the Sixties.\n\n\"Fred introduced me to a whole bunch of older music, mostly from the Monument label, including Jimmy's albums, and I just fell in love with his music,\" says Dawn. \"I think of him as a humanist, a very open soul to the human condition, very sympathetic.\"\n\nReflecting on the experience of recording with Foster, Dawn says: \"I just connected with him and he just seemed like a friend, like my first friend in Nashville, though we were never going to hang out!\"\n\nPlease Please You presents Dawn Landes at The Basement, City Screen, York, tomorrow night (October 16), supported by JF Robitaille & Lail Arad at 8pm.

Whether it's in her wordplay, her kaleidoscopic live shows, her soundtrack work for motion pictures, or the studio-wizardry she's picked-up as a recording engineer, it's clear that she's an artist with a unique vision.\n\n\n\nThe press has likened Dawn to \"the grand old dames of country\" and in the same breath \"The Black Keys and The White Stripes\" (Uncut). She's also garnered comparisons to Cat Power and Pavement, an interesting mix that made even NPR's David Dye wonder.\n\n\n\nRaised in the fertile musical fields of Branson, Missouri and Louisville, Kentucky, Dawn came to New York City in 1999 and did a cannonball into the music scene. While holding down several jobs to pay the rent, she abandoned university (NYU) and began to intern at some of the best studios in the city. \"I had very little experience\", she says. \"I was just really, really curious.
