{"K. S. Manilal (1925\\u20132006) was an Indian botanist and plant taxonomist who specialized in the study of the flora of the Western Ghats.": [{"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/k-s-manilal/", "page_content": "Professor Kattungal Subramaniam Manilal (Malayalam: \u0d15\u0d3e\u0d1f\u0d4d\u0d1f\u0d41\u0d19\u0d4d\u0d19\u0d7d \u0d38\u0d41\u0d2c\u0d4d\u0d30\u0d39\u0d4d\u0d2e\u0d23\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d02 \u0d2e\u0d23\u0d3f\u0d32\u0d3e\u0d7d) (born 17 September 1938) is an Emeritus of the University of Calicut, a botany scholar and taxonomist, who devoted over 35 years of his life to research, translation and annotation work of the Latin botanical treatise Hortus Malabaricus. This epic effort brought to light the main contents of the book, a wealth of botanical information on Malabar that had largely remained inaccessible to English-speaking scholars, because the entire text was in the Latin language..\n\nDespite the existence of Hendrik van Rheede's Hortus Malabaricus over the last three centuries, the correct taxonomic identity of many plants listed in Hortus Malabaricus, their medicinal properties, methods of use, etc., as described and codified by renowned traditional medical authorities of 17th century India remained inaccessible to English language based scholars, until Manilal commenced publication of research papers and books on Hortus Malabaricus.\n\nManilal efforts ultimately resulted in an English edition of Hortus Malabaricus, for the first time, 325 years after its original publication from Amsterdam. The English edition contains a word by word translation of all the twelve volumes of the book, retaining the original style of language. Medicinal properties of plants are translated and interpreted, with commentaries on their Malayalam names given by Van Rheede. In addition, the correct scientific identity of all plants, acceptable under ICBN are set out along with their important synonyms and basionyms.\n\nWhilst the scope of Manilal's contributions to botany extend far beyond the research and publications around Hortus Malabaricus, his research work on Hortus Malabaricus alone are of botanical and socio-historic significance, and can be broadly classified under two heads:\n\nBotanical and Medicinal aspects of Hortus Malabaricus; and\n\nHistorical, Political, Social and Linguistic aspects of Hortus Malabaricus.\n\nManilal has over 198 published research papers and 15 books to his credit as author and co-author. He and his associates have credits to discovering over 14 species of flowering plants, varieties and combinations new to science. Manilal is the Founder President of the Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy (IAAT).\n\nBirth, early life and interest in Hortus Malabaricus\n\nManilal was born in Cochin on 17 September 1938. He is one of three children born to his parents; father Advocate Kattungal A. Subramaniam (b:1914~d:1973) and mother K. K. Devaki (b:1919~d:1989). Manilal's father, K. A. Subramaniam, was besides being a practising advocate, also a writer, who authored the biography of Sahodaran Ayyapan. Manial's Kattungal family members are natives of North Paravur in Kerala, India.\n\nAs a young boy, Manilal's interest in Hortus Malabaricus was inspired by his father, whose avid reading habits and enthusiasm for sociology exposed Manilal to a collection of books, and more specifically newspaper cuttings on Hortus Malabaricus during the late 1940s and 1950s.\n\nManilal schooled initially at the Government Boys\u2019 High School, Kodungallur and later at the Government S.R.V. Boys\u2019 High School, Ernakulam. He enrolled for undergraduate studies in Botany at the Maharaja's College, Ernakulam, following which, he secured MSc Botany and PhD Degrees from University Teaching Department, Sagar, in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nDuring his post-graduate studies, while on a study tour to the Forest Research Institute in Dehra Dun, Manilal was able to see, for the first time, a set of volumes of the original Hortus Malabaricus. This was set of volumes acquired by the Institute's library during the days of the British Raj, when the Institute was called the Imperial Forest College. Manilal remarks \u201cit fired my imagination!\u201d on seeing a Latin book in which the names of plants were also written in native Malayalam language. Manilal maintained his interest in the book through his studies and professional life until 1969, when he commenced serious work on the transliteration of Hortus Malabaricus.\n\nMajor research and academic achievements\n\nBotanical and medicinal aspects of Hortus Malabaricus\n\nFrontispiece of the original Latin Hortus Malabaricus Frontispiece of the original Latin Hortus Malabaricus\n\nAs Hortus Malabaricus is a pre-Linnaean book, the scientific names of plants, equivalent to local Malayalam names, were not included. Since voucher specimens for the book are also not known to exist, the correct identity of many of the plants described was unclear and not verifiable to original specimens. Earlier attempts, over three centuries, by European and Indian botanists to correctly identify all specimens were futile. Under two research projects; one sponsored by the U.G.C. (1975\u20131978) and the other by the Smithsonian Institution (1984\u20131987), Manilal collected all plants, described in Hortus Malabaricus, from localities in Malabar from where they were originally collected in the 17th century. Specimens were subjected to detailed studies and their correct identities were established in consultation with research institutes in Europe and USA. Based on this work, initially a concise reference book: An Interpretation of Van Rheede's Hortus Malabaricus, was published (with his collaborators) from Berlin (1988), by the IAPT. This remains the only book by Indian authors published by them (IAPT) till date and is an essential resource in study on the taxonomy of Southeast Asian plants.\n\nHistorical, political, social and linguistic aspects of Hortus Malabaricus\n\nThe compilation and publication of Hortus Malabaricus is intimately connected with the history of India, politics of the 17th century Netherlands and the then social conditions of Malabar. It is also an important source of information, and the oldest printed, authentic document, on the evolution of Malayalam language and script. Manilal studied these aspects for over 35 years bringing to light many interesting facts, some of which were included in his book: Botany & History of Hortus Malabaricus, published from Rotterdam and Delhi (1980). Another book, in Malayalam: A study on the role of Itty Achudan in the compilation of Hortus Malabaricus, was published from Kozhikode in 1996.\n\nVan Rheede's motivation to compile a book on the natural plant wealth of Malabar was to prove his belief that Malabar is self-sufficient in all requirements of military and commerce and hence that Cochin was better suited to be the south east Asian Headquarters of the Dutch overseas forces, compared to Colombo in Ceylon.\n\nInformation is also available in the text of Hortus Malabaricus not only about the vegetation in 17th century Malabar, but also about the general social conditions prevalent in those days. Significant inferences could also be drawn on some of these matters, indirectly from the data available in the book. Several research papers have been published by Manilal on these topics. Some more, particularly on the different Numerals and Numerical Systems used in Hortus and their sociological implications and significances in the Indian society, are under preparation.\n\nTaxonomic and biodiversity studies in Kerala\n\nManilal pioneered taxonomic research and biodiversity studies in Kerala by training a genre of young taxonomists and identifying and cataloguing local plants in biodiversity-rich South India. A comprehensive study on the flora of the Greater Kozhikode area, consisting of the western sectors of the present day Kozhikode and Malappuram districts, covering an area of about 600 km2. was started in 1969. When completed in 1975, this work resulted in recording about one thousand species of flowering plants from the region, including several species recorded for the first time in India and importantly seven species new to science. Based on this work, a book: Flora of Calicut, was published (from Dehra Dun), and was taken as a model for subsequent research in India.\n\nResearch and revelations at Silent Valley\n\nIn the 1970s, when a proposal to build a hydro-electric project in Silent Valley triggered political controversy in Kerala due to an impending ecological disaster, the Government of Kerala appointed an experts\u2019 committee of scientists to study, inventorise and report on Silent Valley's flora and fauna. The experts\u2019 committee reported that the forests there could not be classified as tropical evergreen rainforests and that they contain only 240 species of flowering plants, which are also found elsewhere, and also that the Valley does not possess any new or rare species. Despite protests by environmentalists the State Government was about to go ahead with the project, only awaiting a clearance form the Central Government. At this juncture, the Department of Science and Technology (India) accepted Manilal's proposal to study the flora of Silent Valley and also required him to make a general study of the ecological status of the forests.\n\nOver a four-year period commencing 1981, Manilal and research assistants undertook a study that brought to light:\n\nA record of nearly 1,000 species of flowering plants;\n\nSeven species new to science;\n\nSeveral plants believed to be found only in Sri Lanka, Philippines, etc.;\n\nSome species which were believed to be extinct, such as the Malabar Daffodil , which was last seen in 1850 by a scientist named Thomas C. Jerdon in Nilgiris;\n\n, which was last seen in 1850 by a scientist named Thomas C. Jerdon in Nilgiris; Rare medicinal plants until then known to grow only in the islands of Philippines;\n\nMany endemics of the neighbouring countries, where their existence was threatened, were found to have migrated to these forests for safety.\n\nFurther Manilal's study found that the Silent Valley forests fulfilled required parameters of tropical evergreen rainforests and, therefore, could be rightly so classified. His work was soon considered as model of how taxonomists could assist in solving socio-environmental issues; and many scientists and journalists from Europe, Africa and South America visited Silent Valley to study the working of this project.\n\nOrchids of Kerala\n\nDetailed studies of the orchid wealth of Kerala were started by Manilal in the late 1970s, including their taxonomy, anatomy, biology and floral evolution, which are essential for any further studies on their hybridisation. During these studies, contrary to the highest expectations, over 215 species of orchids were collected, including species that were till then believed to be extinct, like the ladies' slipper orchid Paphiopedilum druryii.\n\nOrigin and evolution of the flower\n\nManilal has led studies on the directions of evolution of flowers and the structure and anatomy of various floral organs in cash crops such as coconut palms, grasses (rice), orchids, compositae (sun flower), rubiales (coffee), etc. Many enigmas in these subjects could be solved, and results were published in around 45 research papers. These studies have, besides seeing the flower as the most significant part of the plant, with biological, commercial, aesthetic, evolutionary and taxonomic importance, also promoted success in hybridisation and breeding experiments, to create new high-yielding varieties.\n\nRadioactive resistant marine phyto-planktonic algae\n\nAs the beaches in southern Kerala and Tamil Nadu (particularly in the Districts of Kollam and Nagarcoil) have natural deposits of radioactive minerals causing genetic damage to flora and fauna, Manilal undertook studies to familiarise with the techniques of research in the field of radiation ecology. These studies were undertaken at the Marine Biology Laboratory of North Wales University at Menai Bridge, Wales. The Royal Society of London granted Manilal a Visiting Scientist-ship for this work for two years in 1971\u20131972.\n\nTwo species of marine phyto-planktonic algae were discovered, which could withstand a very high degree of radioactivity. It was found that these species could absorb and adsorb as much as 40 times their body weight of the radioactive Thorium compounds from surrounding seawater, and continue to live normally. In the 1970s these findings were farfetched to be accepted for publication in a journal in U.K. However, on Manilal's return to India, a part of these findings was published in the journal Current Science (1975), by the Indian Institute of Science. About ten years later, some British scientists did a similar work and their results were published in the prestigious U.K. journal Nature, and wide publicity in the press as a biotechnological break-through. Manilal's experiments (and the subsequent work by the British scientists) show that such marine planktonic algae could be used to quickly and safely clean up ocean surfaces where radio-active materials have accumulated, by cultivating such algae in a specific area and later removing them from there.\n\nIndian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy (IAAT)\n\nManilal was instrumental in establishing the Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy (IAAT). Manilal, as founder President, established IAAT in the year 1990 with its Headquarters located at the Department of Botany, University of Calicut, Kozhikode, India. The IAAT works to promote the science of Angiosperm Taxonomy in India, to provide a common forum for Angiosperm taxonomists in India to organise meetings, hold discussions and exchange ideas on scientific and academic matters, and encourage collaborative work among taxonomists. The IAAT publishes a journal Rheedea (named after Hendrik van Rheede). The Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy works as an affiliate of the International Association for Plant Taxonomy.\n\nFrom 1969 Manilal commenced training research students in Taxonomy (leading to PhD degree in the subject), with a view to attain self-sufficiency in Taxonomy. During the years 1972\u20131998, he and his students discovered over 240 new species of flowering plants and several new records for India from Kerala, and published many research papers in Taxonomy in national and international journals.\n\nBiomass Research Centre\n\nA Biomass Research Centre was established by Manilal in the University of Calicut, with funding from the Ministry of Non-conventional Energy Sources. The Centre does research and field experiments to establish the (taxonomic) identification of fast-growing fuel-wood trees suitable for various agro-climatic zones of Kerala.\n\nSummary of Manilal's discoveries\n\nNew species and varieties discovered, and combinations established by Manilal and his research associates are summarised are follows:\n\nNew species discovered in Silent Valley\n\nLiparis indiraii Manilal & S.Kumar\n\nEria tiagii Manilal & S.Kumar\n\nHydnocarpus pendulus Manilal, Sabu & Sivar.\n\nRobiquetia josephiana Manilal & S.Kumar\n\nSauropus saksenianus Manilal, Sabu & Sivar.\n\nCucumella silentvaleyii Manilal, Sabu & Mathew\n\nOberonia bisaccata Manilal & S.Kumar\n\nNew species discovered under biodiversity studies\n\nHedyotis erecta Manilal & Sivar.\n\nCinnamomum nicolsonianum Manilal & Shylaja\n\nBulbophyllum rheedei Manilal & S.Kumar\n\nHeliotropium keralense Sivar. & Manilal\n\nBorreria malabarica Sivar. & Manilal\n\nPhyllanthus kozhikodianus Sivar. & Manilal\n\nHabenaria indica S.Kumar & Manilal\n\nNew varieties of flowering plants discovered\n\nBorreria stricta (L. f.)

Manilal's copyright, as author of the English and Malayalam versions, was bequeathed, free of royalties, to the publishers, the University of Kerala. This assignment of rights was a gesture by Manilal in good faith and in response to a specific appeal from the then Vice-Chancellor of the University of Kerala, that the University wanted to generate funds from this publication for utilisation of such royalty incomes toward re-publication of old Malayalam classical works, which are out of print, and not forecasted to generate a viable level of income due to limited sale of such classical works.\n\nBook-release functions conducted by the publishers\n\nIn a recorded interview with Manilal in August 2008, he expressed his regret and frustration at the manner in which the publishers subjected him to digression from the publication project soon after he legally assigned his rights as author. Apparently there was a move to exclude Manilal's name from the book (2003), but was reinstated on account of questions raised by the academic community. On 14 August 2008, the University of Kerala officials again conducted a function at Thiruvananthapuram to formally release the Malayalam edition of Hortus Malabaricus. The book was released by the Governor of Kerala (also Chancellor of the University), at the function; where due recognition was not given to Manilal as author of the book, nor were arrangements in place to felicitate the author at the function. [1]. The former Vice-Chancellor of University of Kerala who initiated the project, B. Ekbal, was also not invited to this function.\n\nBooks authored by K. S. Manilal\n\n2012. MANILAL, K.S.

Like flagposts, they could draw and guide you at different points of your life. Others, especially religious works, lay the tracks on which lives run. Then there are a few that make you fall hopelessly in love with them because they approximate human infatuation, drawing you in at one moment, mystifying you at others, frustrating and delighting you. But they grow on you, so entwining themselves with your life that at some point it becomes impossible to separate the strands.\n\nFor Kattungal Subramaniam Manilal, a retired professor of botany at the University of Calicut, the love started early. It was an oddly matched couple \u2013 a tall, reserved, bespectacled man and Hortus Malabaricus, an elaborately illustrated 17th-century Latin book on the trees and plants of the Malabar region of Kerala. It defined Manilal\u2019s life and career; he would update and translate this mammoth 2,400-page, 12-volume work into English, revealing it to be one of the finest collaborations between east and west.\n\nThe task was mind-boggling. Each of the 742 plants mentioned in Hortus had to be tracked down to the areas they were originally collected from over 300 years ago, and then identified anew because modern taxonomic classification has changed significantly in this period. It showed a book that went far beyond plants, to shed light on the society, culture, science and language of its time.\n\nNow 80 and having suffered a stroke, Manilal remembers little, but signs of Hortus Malabaricus are strewn liberally over more than 50 years of his life. There are half a dozen books he wrote, many more papers and the recollections of colleagues, students and his wife, Jyotsna, who says that for a man \u201cso reticent that often she did not know what he felt\u201d, the Hortus was a \u201cpassion\u201d.\n\nManilal first chanced upon this remarkable book in his father\u2019s clippings from Malayalam newspapers of the 1950s, when he was still in school. Much later, as a postgraduate student of botany, he visited the Forest Research Institute in Dehradun, which had a complete set of the original volume of the book. He says it \u201cfired (his) imagination\u201d to find a 300-year-old Latin book of botany with names in Malayalam. He spent four days poring over the volumes and made a list of all the Malayalam names.\n\nThough he couldn\u2019t understand the Latin text, one line from the description of a plant caught his attention. \u201cThe plant\u2019s part,\u201d it read translated, \u201cif applied on the left toe improves the clarity of vision in the right eye.\u201d The medicinal properties of the plant were known but how on Earth was the connection between the left toe and the right eye established?\n\nAt that moment, Manilal knew that he had to know what the rest of the book held.\n\nThe Hortus Malabaricus was the brainchild of Hendrik Adriaan Van Rheede Tot Drakenstein (Van Rheede), an aristocrat and soldier in the Dutch East India Company who rose rapidly through the ranks to become the Dutch Governor of Cochin in 1663.\n\nFor the Dutch and the Portuguese, Malabar was a land of abundance \u2013 of wood, spices and medicinal plants. For centuries the trade in these commodities had been controlled by Arab merchants who later introduced them to the West.\n\nVan Rheede\u2019s motivations for a work cataloging the plants of the region were varied. One was economic: Arab traders sourced the ingredients for the medicines his soldiers needed from the Malabar, sold them in the West, from where the Dutch would have to import them at great expense. Procuring the medicinal plants and manufacturing medicines locally could save a lot of money.\n\nVan Rheede was also a keen naturalist, mesmerised by the luxuriance of the land he governed. He writes in the preface to the third volume of Hortus Malabaricus:\n\nAfter I had been with the Indians for a considerable number of years and on account of my office fairly often had to make journeys through very well-cultivated regions, on the way I observed large, lofty and dense forests. I saw that they were pleasing through the marvelous variety of trees, which was so great that it would be difficult to find two trees of the same kind in the same forest if one were to search for this. I rather frequently saw many ivies of various kinds climbing to one tree and moreover shooting up in the very branches of trees\u2026so that it was often very pleasant to see on one tree displayed leaves, flowers, and fruits of ten or twelve different kinds.\n\nThe last reason was political. His superior, Admiral Rijcklof Volckertsz van Goens, was keen on making Colombo the second eastern capital of the Dutch, after Jakarta. Van Rheede was staunchly opposed to this. Documenting the medicine, food and timber riches of the Malabar would \u2013 he hoped \u2013 convince authorities in The Hague to make Cochin the second capital instead.\n\nWork on the Hortus began in 1663, and continued for the next 30 years. The first volume of the book was published in Amsterdam in 1678, a few years after Van Rheede left India, and the final in 1693, two years after his death on board a ship off the coast of Bombay.\n\nMaterial for the book was first written in Portuguese in Cochin, then translated to the Dutch and finally to Latin in Amsterdam. When he first started work on the Hortus Malabaricus in 1964, almost exactly three centuries after Van Rheede had, Manilal knew that Latin would be his first hurdle.\n\nManilal enlisted the help of a local priest who, starting with the line on the connection between the left toe and the right eye, translated small segments of the work. However, to proceed further, Manilal realised he would need to learn the language. Every month he would travel to Kochi for a few days to learn the language from another priest. But even after he became somewhat familiar, he realised that the Hortus was even more difficult and technical. Each volume, Manilal says, took him three to four years. \u201cNow I look back and wonder how I did it,\u201d he was quoted as saying a few years ago. But then the language also turned out to be the easiest part.\n\nThe botanical samples documented in the Hortus Malabaricus were collected by Van Rheede on his travels in the region. Plants around Cochin were easily collected but for those found elsewhere, Van Rheede writes they often had to \u201cwait a whole year, and sometimes even longer, until we could secure one of their flowers or fruits.\u201d When travelling by water to the interiors \u201cto rebuke \u2026 some Malabar prince or other\u201d, Van Rheede would often order a party of 200 men to leave the ship and wander through the forest collecting as many different plants as they could find. They would return \u201claden with plants collected from here, there and everywhere, to (the) warships\u201d.\n\nManilal had to follow in Van Rheede\u2019s footsteps quite literally, tracking down and collecting botanical samples from the locales mentioned in the Hortus. This was because the Hortus Malabaricus was written before Carl Linnaeus\u2019s famous work Species Plantarum, in which the Swedish botanist first laid down the rules that form the basis of modern taxonomy. Botanical classification before that was whimsical and ad hoc, varying between authors. As a result plants, had multiple names, often long and convoluted.\n\nIf Hortus Malabaricus was to be relevant, all the plants it featured would have to be classified according to the modern International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. Either Van Rheede\u2019s original collection, which he had shipped to Amsterdam, would have to be accessed, failing which the plants would have to be re-collected with the help of clues from the Hortus.\n\nThe original collection seemed to have vanished. Manilal made efforts to hunt it down, even going to Moscow at one point after a rumour that it might be there. He couldn\u2019t succeed.\n\nManilal decided to hunt down the plants, scouring Hortus for every possible clue to their location and appearance. It was going to be a time consuming and expensive process, so he applied for grants. The University Grants Commission (1975-1978) and the Smithsonian Institution (1984-1987) agreed to fund the project. To help with the collection Manilal roped in C.R. Suresh, a student of his who was studying plant morphology.\n\nOver the seven years covered by the grants, they travelled across the length of Kerala \u2013 \u201cfrom Kasargod\u201d at the northern tip \u201cto Trivandrum\u201d, almost 500 km to the south, says Suresh. They would travel together, but since Manilal had university work to attend to, Suresh would often be on his own. \u201cBut there were some plants Manilal sir insisted on tracking down himself,\u201d Suresh says, \u201cparticularly those specimens where he was also interested in seeing the surroundings \u2013 the geography and other plants that grew alongside.\u201d\n\nThey managed to track down 741 plants. That was all but one of the plants mentioned in Hortus.\n\nThe first obstacle to this was pinning down the original locations. Place names had changed over the centuries. Other names were garbled in the tortuous translation from Malayalam to Portuguese, Dutch and then to Latin. In many cases, plants couldn\u2019t be found in the original locations so the team had to scout farther afield.\n\nOften they would have to venture deep into forests, where elephants and snakes were a common hazard. Suresh was also troubled by allergenic plants, of which he says there were many. \u201cThen\u201d, he laughs, \u201cthere were local problems. With our bags full of plants of all shapes and sizes, we looked like madmen and had a difficult time explaining what we were doing to the villagers.\u201d\n\nAt times the work was laborious. Getting fruits and flowers from plants would often require repeat visits at different times of the year. Suresh recounts instances on such trips when they were unable to locate the same plant, which meant they would have to start anew with another specimen.\n\nThen came the equally arduous process of identification, which involved extensive consultations with botanists around the world, and trips to labs and collections abroad. Manilal would use occasional travel to conferences abroad to sneak visits to them.\n\nBy 1988, the work was complete. In that year, Manilal, Suresh and Dan Nicolson of the Smithsonian Institution published a book entitled \u2018An Interpretation of Van Rheede\u2019s Hortus Malabaricus\u2019, listing all the plants collected by Van Rheede in modern nomenclature.\n\nFor most people, this is where it would have ended. Manilal had a full-time job at the University of Calicut with teaching responsibilities, and continued to work in other areas.\n\nAt the time of a controversy about the proposed construction of a hydro-electric project in the Silent Valley, the Kerala government commissioned Manilal to undertake a four-year study of the area\u2019s flora. His team recorded 1,000 species of flowering plants of which seven were new and others that were endangered. He also worked extensively on the orchids of Kerala, collecting over 215 species, led studies on the anatomy of cash crops like coconut palm and coffee, and researched species of marine algae that were resistant to radioactivity. But in every spare moment and interstice, he would return to his first love, because for him things were just beginning to get interesting.\n\nOther books had been written on the flora of India \u2013 but what distinguished Hortus Malabaricus was its emphasis on, and acknowledgement of, local knowledge. While Van Rheede was responsible for collecting the botanical samples, Itty Achuden, chief of the Collatt family of traditional physicians, identified them and listed their medical and agricultural uses. Achuden\u2019s role in the Hortus Malabaricus is mentioned prominently, affirmed in two certificates at the very start.\n\nInterestingly, even though he belonged to the lower Ezhava (labour) caste, Achuden had been recommended for the task by Vir Kerala Varma, the king of Cochin. Three Konkani Brahmins, whose roles have also been acknowledged in the book, worked under him. Achuden was far more knowledgeable about the local plants than the Brahmins, whose knowledge was largely restricted to providing information from their traditional text, Mahanighandu, a pharmacological glossary that lists 400 medicinal plants from different parts of India in Sanskrit. Manilal was fascinated by this deference to knowledge over caste.\n\nVan Rheede had also been similarly fascinated. \u201cI often attended a most delightful entertainment,\u201d he says, \u201cfor instance when these gentile philosophers disagreed and disputed with each other by weight of arguments. Indeed they disputed and strongly defended their own opinions, but with incredible modesty, such as you might miss in the most distinguished philosophers of the world.\u201d\n\nNone of the traditional medical texts of Achuden\u2019s family are extant. Nor, Manilal realised, was there any mention of him elsewhere. The Hortus was the only remaining repository of this knowledge. And of the plants mentioned in it, the medical uses of 139 weren\u2019t to be found in any other text. Had it not been for Achuden\u2019s contribution, the significance would have been lost to the world. For Manilal, cataloguing these medical properties and uses was imperative to protecting India\u2019s intellectual property, which, according to Jyotsna Manilal, he felt strongly about.\n\nAs Manilal delved deeper into Achuden\u2019s life, he was also drawn into an exploration of this historical interaction between caste and knowledge, which seemed to stand in sharp contrast to the modern terms of their relationship. He explored this in \u2018A Study on the Role of Itty Achuden in the Compilation of Hortus Malabaricus\u2019, a Malayalam book published in 1996.\n\nEvery aspect of the Hortus Malabaricus led the besotted Manilal down a different path. The juxtaposition of two different dialects of Malayalam in Hortus \u2013 one of which is not used today \u2013 became an opportunity to investigate the evolution of Malayalam as well. He explored the considerable impact the book had on Linnaeus; Species Plantarum has more than 250 references to it. Manilal even investigated the identify of the artist who made the frontispiece of the original volume that depicted Flora, the Roman goddess of flowers, sitting and holding a rake in front of what seems like a very ornate greenhouse. To her right, holding various plants, stand the Malabari physician and the three Konkani Brahmins who were so central to this book.\n\nIn Manilal\u2019s reimagining, the botany of Hortus Malabaricus was inextricably entwined with the eventful historical period it belonged to. He made these connections come alive. After he retired from academia in 1999, Manilal devoted himself entirely to the Hortus, the English version of which was released in 2003. He had signed off his copyright to the University of Calicut, which, in an act of cruel and petty politicking, did not invite him to the book release. But he was undeterred and continued working. According to Jyotsna, \u201cHe never really said very much about it.\u201d The Malayalam edition followed a few years later.\n\nIn 2006, Manilal suffered a stroke, leading to the loss of mobility on his right side. But he was not done yet; his work on the Hortus Malabaricus was far from complete. He taught himself to type with only his left hand to complete his last book: \u2018Hortus Malabaricus and the Socio-Cultural Heritage of India\u2019. It was published in 2012, the same year Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands conferred a state honour on him for his work on the Hortus. Sadly, there has been little recognition in India of his work \u2013 not that Manilal cares. The Hortus Malabaricus was his first love, mission and crowning glory. And love is often its own reward.\n\nAkshai Jain is a Delhi-based journalist."}, {"url": "https://vsktelangana.org/prof-k-s-manilal-indias-hitherto-unrecognised-botanist-bestowed-with-padma-shri", "page_content": "Prof Manilal was honoured with Netherland\u2019s highest civilian order, the Order of Orange-Nassau, in 2012, for his outstanding contributions to Botany and Taxonomy\n\n\u201cSometimes I do feel recognition has come from outside but not our own people,\u201d renowned botanist and taxonomist Prof KS Manilal had told a reporter six years ago. Finally, his motherland has recognised his academic contributions. This year, on the eve of the Republic Day, India\u2019s hitherto unrecognised botanist has been bestowed with Padma Shri.\n\nProf Manilal is a well-known botanist and taxonomist outside India. He is best known for his research, translation and annotation of \u2018Hortus Malabaricus\u2019, the 17th century Latin botanical treatise on medicinal properties of over 700 indigenous plants in Kerala.\n\nProf Manilal translated the 12-volume book into Malayalam and English. Until his translations came to light, the content of this Latin treatise had remained inaccessible to the world. Manilal also authored 198 published research papers and 15 books on taxonomy and botany.\n\nProfessor Kattungal Subramaniam Manilal was born in Kochi, as one of three children born to Advocate Kattungal A Subramaniam and K. K. Devaki on September 17, 1938.\n\nAccording to a brief biographical note, Manilal\u2019s interest in Hortus Malabaricus developed in his childhood as he was inspired by his father, whose avid reading habits and enthusiasm for sociology exposed Manilal to a collection of books, and more specifically newspaper cuttings on Hortus Malabaricus during the late 1940s and 1950s.\n\nIn 2018, Prof Manilal told The Hindu that it was a bunch of Latin words from \u2018Hortus Malabaricus\u2019 that changed the course of his life\u2019s work: \u201cThe plant\u2019s part if applied on the left toe improves the clarity of vision in the right eye.\u201d Due to his curiosity to know more about the content of the Latin treatise, he embarked on the new project, devoting almost 40 years of his academic career. \u201cOf course, they knew the plant\u2019s medicinal properties. But what struck me was the link between the left toe and the right eye,\u201d he says.\n\nManilal was not just translating the magnum opus of Hendrik van Rheede but as a botanist, he explored the geography mentioned in the book, rediscovering and verifying the 740-odd species mentioned in it. \u201cThe location where some plants were found was mentioned. So that helped. In other instances, the plants had migrated. In the sense, they were not found at the location mentioned in the volume but in nearby areas. I could find all except one, a plant called \u2018chentani,\u2019\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nProf. Manilal, along with with his students, has discovered around 14 species of flowering plants, and recorded the existence of nearly 1,000 flowering plant species, which were thought to be extinct. Currently he is an Emeritus Professor of Botany at the Calicut University, Kerala.\n\nProf Manilal has been now awarded Padma Shri under Science and Engineering category. As the botanist who made significant contributions to his discipline, Prof Manilal was not recognised by his motherland until now. Remember, the land of Hendrik van Rheede recognised the academic contributions of Prof. Manilal eight years ago! Queen Beatrix conferred on him Netherland\u2019s highest civilian order, the Order of Orange-Nassau, in 2012!\n\nReference:\n\n1.

This epic effort brought to light the main contents of the book, a wealth of botanical information on Malabar that had largely remained inaccessible to English-speaking scholars, because the entire text was in the Latin language..\n\nDespite the existence of Hendrik van Rheede's Hortus Malabaricus over the last three centuries, the correct taxonomic identity of many plants listed in Hortus Malabaricus, their medicinal properties, methods of use, etc., as described and codified by renowned traditional medical authorities of 17th century India remained inaccessible to English language based scholars, until Manilal commenced publication of research papers and books on Hortus Malabaricus.\n\nManilal efforts ultimately resulted in an English edition of Hortus Malabaricus, for the first time, 325 years after its original publication from Amsterdam. The English edition contains a word by word translation of all the twelve volumes of the book, retaining the original style of language. Medicinal properties of plants are translated and interpreted, with commentaries on their Malayalam names given by Van Rheede. In addition, the correct scientific identity of all plants, acceptable under ICBN are set out along with their important synonyms and basionyms.\n\nWhilst the scope of Manilal's contributions to botany extend far beyond the research and publications around Hortus Malabaricus, his research work on Hortus Malabaricus alone are of botanical and socio-historic significance, and can be broadly classified under two heads:\n\nManilal has over 198 published research papers and 15 books to his credit as author and co-author. He and his associates have credits to discovering over 14 species of flowering plants, varieties and combinations new to science. Manilal is the Founder President of the Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy (IAAT).\n\nBirth, early life and interest in Hortus Malabaricus\n\nManilal was born in Cochin on 17 September 1938. He is one of three children born to his parents; father Advocate Kattungal A. Subramaniam (b:1914~d:1973) and mother K. K. Devaki (b:1919~d:1989). Manilal's father, K. A. Subramaniam, was besides being a practising advocate, also a writer, who authored the biography of Sahodaran Ayyapan. Manial's Kattungal family members are natives of North Paravur in Kerala, India.\n\nAs a young boy, Manilal's interest in Hortus Malabaricus was inspired by his father, whose avid reading habits and enthusiasm for sociology exposed Manilal to a collection of books, and more specifically newspaper cuttings on Hortus Malabaricus during the late 1940s and 1950s.\n\nManilal schooled initially at the Government Boys\u2019 High School, Kodungallur and later at the Government S.R.V. Boys\u2019 High School, Ernakulam. He enrolled for undergraduate studies in Botany at the Maharaja's College, Ernakulam, following which, he secured MSc Botany and PhD Degrees from University Teaching Department, Sagar, in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nDuring his post-graduate studies, while on a study tour to the Forest Research Institute in Dehra Dun, Manilal was able to see, for the first time, a set of volumes of the original Hortus Malabaricus. This was set of volumes acquired by the Institute's library during the days of the British Raj, when the Institute was called the Imperial Forest College. Manilal remarks \u201cit fired my imagination!\u201d on seeing a Latin book in which the names of plants were also written in native Malayalam language. Manilal maintained his interest in the book through his studies and professional life until 1969, when he commenced serious work on the transliteration of Hortus Malabaricus.\n\nBotanical and medicinal aspects of Hortus Malabaricus\n\nAs Hortus Malabaricus is a pre-Linnaean book, the scientific names of plants, equivalent to local Malayalam names, were not included. Since voucher specimens for the book are also not known to exist, the correct identity of many of the plants described was unclear and not verifiable to original specimens. Earlier attempts, over three centuries, by European and Indian botanists to correctly identify all specimens were futile. Under two research projects; one sponsored by the U.G.C. (1975\u20131978) and the other by the Smithsonian Institution (1984\u20131987), Manilal collected all plants, described in Hortus Malabaricus, from localities in Malabar from where they were originally collected in the 17th century. Specimens were subjected to detailed studies and their correct identities were established in consultation with research institutes in Europe and USA. Based on this work, initially a concise reference book: An Interpretation of Van Rheede's Hortus Malabaricus, was published (with his collaborators) from Berlin (1988), by the IAPT. This remains the only book by Indian authors published by them (IAPT) till date and is an essential resource in study on the taxonomy of Southeast Asian plants.\n\nHistorical, political, social and linguistic aspects of Hortus Malabaricus\n\nThe compilation and publication of Hortus Malabaricus is intimately connected with the history of India, politics of the 17th century Netherlands and the then social conditions of Malabar. It is also an important source of information, and the oldest printed, authentic document, on the evolution of Malayalam language and script. Manilal studied these aspects for over 35 years bringing to light many interesting facts, some of which were included in his book: Botany & History of Hortus Malabaricus, published from Rotterdam and Delhi (1980). Another book, in Malayalam: A study on the role of Itty Achudan in the compilation of Hortus Malabaricus, was published from Kozhikode in 1996.\n\nVan Rheede's motivation to compile a book on the natural plant wealth of Malabar was to prove his belief that Malabar is self-sufficient in all requirements of military and commerce and hence that Cochin was better suited to be the south east Asian Headquarters of the Dutch overseas forces, compared to Colombo in Ceylon.\n\nInformation is also available in the text of Hortus Malabaricus not only about the vegetation in 17th century Malabar, but also about the general social conditions prevalent in those days. Significant inferences could also be drawn on some of these matters, indirectly from the data available in the book. Several research papers have been published by Manilal on these topics. Some more, particularly on the different Numerals and Numerical Systems used in Hortus and their sociological implications and significances in the Indian society, are under preparation.\n\nTaxonomic and biodiversity studies in Kerala\n\nManilal pioneered taxonomic research and biodiversity studies in Kerala by training a genre of young taxonomists and identifying and cataloguing local plants in biodiversity-rich South India. A comprehensive study on the flora of the Greater Kozhikode area, consisting of the western sectors of the present day Kozhikode and Malappuram districts, covering an area of about 600 km2. was started in 1969. When completed in 1975, this work resulted in recording about one thousand species of flowering plants from the region, including several species recorded for the first time in India and importantly seven species new to science. Based on this work, a book: Flora of Calicut, was published (from Dehra Dun), and was taken as a model for subsequent research in India.\n\nResearch and revelations at Silent Valley\n\nIn the 1970s, when a proposal to build a hydro-electric project in Silent Valley triggered political controversy in Kerala due to an impending ecological disaster, the Government of Kerala appointed an experts\u2019 committee of scientists to study, inventorise and report on Silent Valley's flora and fauna. The experts\u2019 committee reported that the forests there could not be classified as tropical evergreen rainforests and that they contain only 240 species of flowering plants, which are also found elsewhere, and also that the Valley does not possess any new or rare species. Despite protests by environmentalists the State Government was about to go ahead with the project, only awaiting a clearance form the Central Government. At this juncture, the Department of Science and Technology (India) accepted Manilal's proposal to study the flora of Silent Valley and also required him to make a general study of the ecological status of the forests.\n\nOver a four-year period commencing 1981, Manilal and research assistants undertook a study that brought to light:\n\nA record of nearly 1,000 species of flowering plants;\n\nSeven species new to science;\n\nSeveral plants believed to be found only in Sri Lanka, Philippines, etc.;\n\nSome species which were believed to be extinct, such as the Malabar Daffodil, which was last seen in 1850 by a scientist named Thomas C. Jerdon in Nilgiris;\n\nRare medicinal plants until then known to grow only in the islands of Philippines;\n\nMany endemics of the neighbouring countries, where their existence was threatened, were found to have migrated to these forests for safety.\n\nFurther Manilal's study found that the Silent Valley forests fulfilled required parameters of tropical evergreen rainforests and, therefore, could be rightly so classified. His work was soon considered as model of how taxonomists could assist in solving socio-environmental issues; and many scientists and journalists from Europe, Africa and South America visited Silent Valley to study the working of this project.\n\nOrchids of Kerala\n\nDetailed studies of the orchid wealth of Kerala were started by Manilal in the late 1970s, including their taxonomy, anatomy, biology and floral evolution, which are essential for any further studies on their hybridisation. During these studies, contrary to the highest expectations, over 215 species of orchids were collected, including species that were till then believed to be extinct, like the ladies' slipper orchid Paphiopedilum druryii.\n\nOrigin and evolution of the flower\n\nManilal has led studies on the directions of evolution of flowers and the structure and anatomy of various floral organs in cash crops such as coconut palms, grasses (rice), orchids, compositae (sun flower), rubiales (coffee), etc. Many enigmas in these subjects could be solved, and results were published in around 45 research papers. These studies have, besides seeing the flower as the most significant part of the plant, with biological, commercial, aesthetic, evolutionary and taxonomic importance, also promoted success in hybridisation and breeding experiments, to create new high-yielding varieties.\n\nRadioactive resistant marine phyto-planktonic algae\n\nAs the beaches in southern Kerala and Tamil Nadu (particularly in the Districts of Kollam and Nagarcoil) have natural deposits of radioactive minerals causing genetic damage to flora and fauna, Manilal undertook studies to familiarise with the techniques of research in the field of radiation ecology. These studies were undertaken at the Marine Biology Laboratory of North Wales University at Menai Bridge, Wales. The Royal Society of London granted Manilal a Visiting Scientist-ship for this work for two years in 1971\u20131972.\n\nTwo species of marine phyto-planktonic algae were discovered, which could withstand a very high degree of radioactivity. It was found that these species could absorb and adsorb as much as 40 times their body weight of the radioactive Thorium compounds from surrounding seawater, and continue to live normally. In the 1970s these findings were farfetched to be accepted for publication in a journal in U.K. However, on Manilal's return to India, a part of these findings was published in the journal Current Science (1975), by the Indian Institute of Science. About ten years later, some British scientists did a similar work and their results were published in the prestigious U.K. journal Nature, and wide publicity in the press as a biotechnological break-through. Manilal's experiments (and the subsequent work by the British scientists) show that such marine planktonic algae could be used to quickly and safely clean up ocean surfaces where radio-active materials have accumulated, by cultivating such algae in a specific area and later removing them from there.\n\nIndian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy (IAAT)\n\nManilal was instrumental in establishing the Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy (IAAT). Manilal, as founder President, established IAAT in the year 1990 with its Headquarters located at the Department of Botany, University of Calicut, Kozhikode, India. The IAAT works to promote the science of Angiosperm Taxonomy in India, to provide a common forum for Angiosperm taxonomists in India to organise meetings, hold discussions and exchange ideas on scientific and academic matters, and encourage collaborative work among taxonomists. The IAAT publishes a journal Rheedea (named after Hendrik van Rheede). The Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy works as an affiliate of the International Association for Plant Taxonomy.\n\nFrom 1969 Manilal commenced training research students in Taxonomy (leading to PhD degree in the subject), with a view to attain self-sufficiency in Taxonomy. During the years 1972\u20131998, he and his students discovered over 240 new species of flowering plants and several new records for India from Kerala, and published many research papers in Taxonomy in national and international journals.\n\nBiomass Research Centre\n\nA Biomass Research Centre was established by Manilal in the University of Calicut, with funding from the Ministry of Non-conventional Energy Sources. The Centre does research and field experiments to establish the (taxonomic) identification of fast-growing fuel-wood trees suitable for various agro-climatic zones of Kerala.\n\nSummary of Manilal's discoveries\n\nNew species and varieties discovered, and combinations established by Manilal and his research associates are summarised are follows:\n\nNew species discovered in Silent Valley\n\nLiparis indiraii Manilal & C.S.Kumar\n\nEria tiagii Manilal & C.S.Kumar\n\nHydnocarpus pendulus Manilal, T.Sabu & Sivar.\n\nRobiquetia josephiana Manilal & C.S.Kumar\n\nSauropus saksenianus Manilal, Prasann. & Sivar.\n\nCucumella silentvaleyi Manilal, T.Sabu & P.J.Mathew\n\nOberonia bisaccata Manilal & C.S.Kumar\n\nNew species discovered under biodiversity studies\n\nHedyotis erecta Manilal & Sivar.\n\nCinnamomum nicolsonianum Manilal & Shylaja\n\nBulbophyllum rheedei Manilal & C.S.Kumar\n\nHeliotropium keralense Sivar. & Manilal\n\nBorreria malabarica Sivar. & Manilal\n\nPhyllanthus kozhikodianus Sivar. & Manilal\n\nHabenaria indica C.S.Kumar & Manilal\n\nNew varieties of flowering plants discovered\n\nBorreria stricta (L. f.)

Manilal's copyright, as author of the English and Malayalam versions, was bequeathed, free of royalties, to the publishers, the University of Kerala. This assignment of rights was a gesture by Manilal in good faith and in response to a specific appeal from the then Vice-Chancellor of the University of Kerala, that the University wanted to generate funds from this publication for utilisation of such royalty incomes toward re-publication of old Malayalam classical works, which are out of print, and not forecasted to generate a viable level of income due to limited sale of such classical works.\n\nBook-release functions conducted by the publishers\n\nIn a recorded interview with Manilal in August 2008, he expressed his regret and frustration at the manner in which the publishers subjected him to digression from the publication project soon after he legally assigned his rights as author. Apparently there was a move to exclude Manilal's name from the book (2003), but was reinstated on account of questions raised by the academic community. On 14 August 2008, the University of Kerala officials again conducted a function at Thiruvananthapuram to formally release the Malayalam edition of Hortus Malabaricus. The book was released by the Governor of Kerala (also Chancellor of the University), at the function; where due recognition was not given to Manilal as author of the book, nor were arrangements in place to felicitate the author at the function. [1]. The former Vice-Chancellor of University of Kerala who initiated the project, B. Ekbal, was also not invited to this function.\n\nBooks authored by K. S. Manilal\n\n2012. MANILAL, K.S.

The mind tussles with memory to wrestle out names \u2014 of things, titles and places. K.S. Manilal says it was a paragraph that changed the course of his life\u2019s work. But to remember what it said is an effort for the 75-year-old professor emeritus now. He tries, gives up. But after silence that stretches for a few moments, the words burst out eloquently. \u201cThe plant\u2019s part if applied on the left toe improves the clarity of vision in the right eye.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, when a bunch of incorrigible Latin words he picked out from Hortus Malabaricus, the 12-volume, 17th century work by Dutchman Hendrik Van Rheede became lucid, Manilal knew he had to know what the rest holds. \u201cOf course, they knew the plant\u2019s medicinal properties. But what struck me was the link between the left toe and the right eye.\u201d Translating the volumes of Hortus from Latin to English and Malayalam and interpreting it in modern scientific terms have taken away a large chunk of Manilal\u2019s career \u2014 well over 40 years. For his dogged perseverance with little support from elsewhere, the botanist was honoured by Van Rheede\u2019s country; Queen Beatrix bestowed on him Netherland\u2019s highest civilian order \u2014 Officer of the Order of Orange \u2014 Nassau in 2012. \u201cThe Consul General came to Kozhikode to give him the honour,\u201d pitches in wife Jyotsna, Manilal\u2019s constant aid. She takes baby steps with him as he slowly finds his way after a stroke partially paralysed him eight years ago. She pitches in too when he struggles with names of students and books or to recall incidents.\n\nThere were many things about Hortus that drew Manilal to it. Having grown up in Kochi, tomes on the plant wealth of the region was natural curiosity for any botanist. \u201cAlso nobody really knew anything about it. Their awareness began and ended with the title and to think this was a really important text to us. First-hand information about it was nil. I had to start from scratch.\u201d\n\nHis father, a \u201cvoracious reader\u201d and lawyer, had meticulously piled up whatever paper cuttings he came across of these volumes. Manilal\u2019s first interaction with the physical volumes were at the then Dehradun Imperial Forest Research Institute which he visited for a study tour as a post-graduate student at Sagar University. \u201cIn the first instance, I spent four days there and copied down all the Malayalam names in the 12 volumes.\u201d\n\nLater when he joined Calicut University as faculty in the 1960s, he went back to Hortus . What stood between any scholar and the volumes was intimidating Latin. \u201cIt was not easy; learning Latin then.\u201d Yet he began with the small paragraph which unlocked the co-ordination between the left toe and the right eye. \u201cI had approached Father Pathroni for help. Being busy, he had said if it was a small segment he would help. That is how I went with that paragraph to him,\u201d recalls Manilal.\n\nThe paragraph\u2019s message bolstered Manilal\u2019s conviction to translate Hortus. He banked on Father Anthony Mukkath in Kochi to teach him Latin. \u201cEvery month I would travel to Kochi for 2-3 days and spend time with him. A lot of work was done that way over months.\u201d But soon, Mukkath passed away. \u201cBy then I could manage with the basic language I had learnt. Translating each volume took me 3-4 years. Now I look back and wonder how I did it.\u201d\n\nThe task for Manilal was never of a mere translator, but of a botanist. He scouted the regions mentioned in the volumes searching and verifying the 740-odd species mentioned in it.\n\n\u201cThe location where some plants were found was mentioned. So that helped. In other instances, the plants had migrated. In the sense, they were not found at the location mentioned in the volume but in nearby areas. I could find all except one, a plant called \u2018chentani,\u2019\u201d he says.\n\nAfter decades decoding Hortus, when all was done, Manilal bowed to the Kerala University\u2019s request for copyright. He did so shunning offers from other publishers.\n\nThough Hortus took much of his time, other publications and papers complete his repertoire.\n\nAmong it is the Flora of Silent Valley, an extensive study he carried out with three research students, documenting over 950 plant species and thereby preventing the establishment of the controversial hydro-electric project in the ecologically sensitive region. \u201cAn earlier study had recorded only 240 species in the region. Our study, funded by the Department of Science and Technology, took us four years. The terrain was difficult, filled as it was with wild animals and reptiles,\u201d he recalls.\n\nHe also studied the plants of Kozhikode, the city now home.\n\nThe Flora of Kozhikode documents the plants in what he calls Greater Kozhikode region extending till Ponnani along the Chaliyar.\n\n\u201cI did it at a time when no local plants were studied and had documented over 1,000 species.\u201d\n\nAs the botanist who has discovered 18 new plant species struggles with the finer details of his past, Manilal says, \u201cSometimes I do feel recognition has come from outside but not our own people.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.ayurvedajournals.com/article/hortus-malabaricus-mamilal-love-affair", "page_content": "Manilal enlisted the help of a local priest who, starting with the line on the connection between the left toe and the right eye, translated small segments of the work. However, to proceed further, Manilal realised he would need to learn the language. Every month he would travel to Kochi for a few days to learn the language from another priest. But even after he became somewhat familiar, he realised that the Hortus was even more difficult and technical. Each volume, Manilal says, took him three to four years. \u201cNow I look back and wonder how I did it,\u201d he was quoted as saying a few years ago. But then the language also turned out to be the easiest part.\n\nThe botanical samples documented in the Hortus Malabaricus were collected by Van Rheede on his travels in the region. Plants around Cochin were easily collected but for those found elsewhere, Van Rheede writes they often had to \u201cwait a whole year, and sometimes even longer, until we could secure one of their flowers or fruits.\u201d When travelling by water to the interiors \u201cto rebuke \u2026 some Malabar prince or other\u201d, Van Rheede would often order a party of 200 men to leave the ship and wander through the forest collecting as many different plants as they could find. They would return \u201claden with plants collected from here, there and everywhere, to (the) warships\u201d.\n\nManilal had to follow in Van Rheede\u2019s footsteps quite literally, tracking down and collecting botanical samples from the locales mentioned in the Hortus. This was because the Hortus Malabaricus was written before Carl Linnaeus\u2019s famous work Species Plantarum, in which the Swedish botanist first laid down the rules that form the basis of modern taxonomy. Botanical classification before that was whimsical and ad hoc, varying between authors. As a result plants, had multiple names, often long and convoluted."}, {"url": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/city-honours-botanist-manilal/article30966873.ece", "page_content": "March 03, 2020 12:47 am | Updated 09:31 am IST - KOZHIKODE\n\nMayor Thottathil Raveendran was all praise for K.S. Manilal, eminent botanist, describing the efforts the latter had taken to translate Hendrik van Rheede\u2019s Hortus Malabaricus (Garden of Malabar), a 17th century classic in Latin on the flora in the Western Ghats.\n\n\u201cThe efforts taken by Mr. Manilal then are unimaginable now. Learning Latin, an alien language, and translate that book into English. Later, translating it into Malayalam. Ordinary people cannot do such things,\u201d Mr. Raveendran said. He was speaking at an event organised by the Kozhikode Corporation and other organisations to honour Mr. Manilal, who was recently awarded the Padma Shri.\n\n\u201cIt is too late a recognition for him. He should have got this award long ago and he deserves even bigger awards,\u201d the Mayor said. Mr. Raveendran spoke about the mental trauma that Mr. Manilal had to endure when a publisher promised to bring out the translation, but did not give him the credit after doing it.\n\nHistorian M.G.S. Narayanan, who was also present, appreciated Mr. Manilal for his work in botany. Mr. Narayanan also recalled Mr. Manilal\u2019s term as the Head of the Department in the subject at Calicut University."}, {"url": "https://www.bornglorious.com/person/?pi=11926373", "page_content": "\u00d7 Image Author, Source and License\n\nOwn work\n\nOriginal text: I created this work entirely by myself."}]}
