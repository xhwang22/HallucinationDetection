Zaher Zaher told the Sunday Times on Wednesday that M\u00e9nard was charged with \u201cgun smuggling,\u201d but the charge could not be confirmed by the Star.\n\nM\u00e9nard took the position with GardaWorld in 2011 after being relieved of his duties in 2010 as the most senior Canadian commander in Afghanistan \u2014 a fall from grace for one of the youngest commanders to lead the contingent in Kandahar.\n\nM\u00e9nard admitted to a having a relationship with Master Cpl.

A line of concrete barriers protects the facility from car bombs, and armed guards must raise a heavy metal boom at the vehicle entrance and haul aside a coil of razor wire that blocks the driveway.\n\nThe prison is a crumbling Soviet-era compound, crowded with loved ones carrying food for the inmates. Families bring bags of tangerines or bananas, stacks of fresh bread, or a stainless steel lunch pail, knowing the prison diet is one of dirty rice and not much else.\n\nVisitors surrender their cameras and cellphones at a checkpoint and are ushered into the main reception \u2014 a room the size of a high school gymnasium that is partitioned by two layers of metal cross-hatch fence.\n\nThe complex in downtown Kabul consists of two 400-man holding cells. Unlike Pul-e-Charkhi, Afghanistan\u2019s largest and most notorious prison on the eastern outskirts, it does not hold high-profile insurgent suspects and lacks the same bloody history of torture and execution.\n\n\u201cBut prison is still a prison,\u201d M\u00e9nard said Thursday, speaking from behind a metal fence.\n\nWearing only a thin windbreaker against the winter chill, the former soldier said he was suffering from loss of appetite, and that there were scarce opportunities for showers and other modern amenities.\n\nNews of M\u00e9nard\u2019s arrest was made public in a Jan. 12 press release from the Interior Ministry. However, the document incorrectly stated that a British citizen by the name of Daniel Fiard had been arrested for running an illegal private security company.\n\nM\u00e9nard\u2019s ill fortune may be symptomatic of President Hamid Karzai\u2019s efforts to rein in the foreign private security companies, which he believes are operating with impunity in Afghanistan.\n\nThe arrest also reflects a changing tide in local sentiments, the latest inflection point in the struggle between foreign contractors and Afghans who see them as an unwelcome aspect of a decade-long intervention that hasn\u2019t yielded much benefit.\n\nEarlier this month, the U.S.-funded advocacy group Democracy International had its Kabul office raided by police. The group had been funding public opinion surveys ahead of the April 5 presidential elections, a potentially contentious project in a country where elections are usually tainted by allegations of fraud.\n\nDemocracy International was close to signing a deal with GardaWorld for security of its Afghan operations, M\u00e9nard said, although he expressed skepticism about whether his arrest was connected to the raid.\n\nOn Thursday, Democracy International announced that future polls would be cancelled, after the group was accused of trying to influence the outcome of the election.\n\nRead more about:\n\nSHARE:"}, {"url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ex-general-daniel-m%C3%A9nard-s-move-to-uae-cost-national-defence-40k-1.2541044", "page_content": "National Defence paid nearly $40,000 to move a disgraced general to the United Arab Emirates after he was court-martialled for having sex with a subordinate and trying to cover it up, expense records for the military's top brass show.\n\nThe revelation about former brigadier-general Daniel M\u00e9nard is in the same set of records that show retired lieutenant-general Andrew Leslie was allowed to claim more than $72,000 for a move within Ottawa after he left the military.\n\nM\u00e9nard, who was relieved in 2010 as combat commander in Kandahar, had already resigned from the military when he pleaded guilty in 2011 to having improper relations with a corporal under his command, and trying to impede an investigation into their affair.\n\nHis name recently reappeared in the headlines after M\u00e9nard was detained in Afghanistan in his current role as an executive for a private security company.\n\nThe Department of National Defence allows a retiring member of the Canadian Forces up to two years to claim a final relocation expense, which is then approved and audited.

The subordinate involved has been sent home, according to a military spokesman.\n\nBrigadier-General Jonathan Vance, Gen. M\u00e9nard's predecessor, will be returning to Kandahar this week to assume command less than a year after he left, arriving as coalition troops are poised to launch a major operation in Kandahar in June that is cast as the defining moment of the war.\n\nWhile Canadian military commanders in Afghanistan sought to down play the controversy as a personal ordeal, military observers and former officers said Gen. M\u00e9nard's dismissal could be damaging to the morale of the troops on the ground, and possibly taint Canadians' image of the armed forces.\n\nIt will certainly \"take away some of the glitter\" that was associated with Canadian soldiers' performance in Afghanistan, said Michel Drapeau, a professor of military law and a former armed forces colonel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is particularly unfortunate that it comes so soon after Colonel Russell Williams, the former base commander at CFB Trenton, was charged with multiple murders and sexual assaults, he said. While the allegations against Gen. M\u00e9nard are in no way similar, they will add to the public's concern about the quality of leadership in the armed forces and raise worries within the Forces as well, he said. \"People in the military [will say]'Here we go again,'\"\n\nHowever, the greatest impact, Mr. Drapeau said, will be on the morale of troops in Afghanistan who served under Gen. M\u00e9nard. \"It's devastating,\" he said. \"They [put]all of their trust and respect in him, and they were prepared to follow him into battle ... Their sense of confidence in leadership will take a hit.\"\n\nMilitary historian Jack Granatstein said it is important to note that the allegations against Gen. M\u00e9nard are \"infinitely less serious\" than those against Col. Williams. If proven, they will primarily demonstrate \"stupidity on the part of a commanding officer who's job it is to set an example.\"\n\nGen. M\u00e9nard commanded 2,800 Canadian soldiers in southern Afghanistan, as well as a contingent of American troops serving under Canadian command.\n\nThe allegations against him caused military command to \"lose confidence\" in his \"capacity to command,\" the military said in a brief statement. Military rules strictly forbid any kind of intimacy on deployments, including relationships of an emotional, romantic or sexual nature.\n\nGen. M\u00e9nard, is 42 and married with two children. Major Daryl Morrell, senior public affairs officer with Joint Task Force Afghanistan, said it was \"too early to speculate on the charges\" Gen. M\u00e9nard could face, because they won't be known until the military completes its investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLieutenant-General Marc Lessard, commander of Canadian forces overseas, made a brief visit to Afghanistan several weeks ago, before Gen. M\u00e9nard went on a three-week leave, from which he has just returned. However, reporters at Kandahar Air Field were told the allegations were only revealed to Gen. Lessard on Saturday. Lt.-Gen. Lessard acted immediately to replace Gen. M\u00e9nard.\n\nColonel Simon Hetherington, previously Brig.-Gen. M\u00e9nard's second-in-command, is now acting commander until Gen. Vance arrives. He sought to down play any consequences the allegations could have on the military's reputation.\n\n\"The allegations against Brig-Gen. M\u00e9nard are that - they're allegations,\" Col. Hetherington said. \"It's a personal thing, so I don't see that as any sort of mark against the institution at all,\" he added.\n\nDefence Minister Peter MacKay declined to comment on the case while it was under investigation by the military.\n\nMichael Byers, a professor of political science at the University of British Columbia, said that while it is clearly discouraging for troops to see a senior officer accused of breaking the rules, it also tells the public that those rules are being applied at all levels.\n\n\"I'm encouraged by the fact that M\u00e9nard was removed from his post, since it suggests that the Forces are taking the rules, and the rights and interests of female soldiers, seriously,\" Prof. Byers said.\n\nRetired major-general Lewis Mackenzie said the fact that Gen. M\u00e9nard was the commander in Afghanistan raises the situation above a minor issue, because he would be the one to make final decisions in other cases of inappropriate behaviour. \"He's the last level of authority in the theatre in disciplinary matters.\"\n\nDouglas Bland, the chair of defence management studies at the Queen's University School of Policy Studies, said the military has moved quickly to deal with leadership issues since the Somalia inquiry, when problems in command were linked to the fatal beating of a teenager by two Canadian soldiers during a humanitarian mission in Somalia. \"That is a sign of their sensitivity and seriousness about maintaining good order and discipline across the forces,\" he said.\n\nBut Prof. Bland said the rules prohibiting personal relationships are essential, especially in combat zones, \"where the integrity of the unit is supreme,\" and must be followed, particularly, by the highest-ranking soldiers.\n\nThis is not the first time controversy has dogged Gen. M\u00e9nard.\n\nLast week he was fined $3,500 for accidentally firing his rifle at Kandahar Air Field in March. He had failed to switch is C8 carbine rifle to the \"safe\" position before departing in a helicopter with his boss, General Walter Natynczyk.\n\nNobody was injured, but the incident qualifies as an offence under the National Defence Act, with a maximum penalty of dismissal from the military. At a military hearing into the incident, Gen. M\u00e9nard's defence lawyer argued for leniency, noting the commander reported the mishap to investigators and discussed the incident openly with his soldiers.\n\nBrig.-Gen M\u00e9nard joined the Canadian forces in 1984 and was posted to the Royal 22nd Regiment where initially served as a platoon commander.\n\nHe rose quickly through the ranks, serving in Great Britain, Berlin, Germany and Bosnia. He assumed command of Task Force Kandahar in November.\n\nWith a report from Erin Anderssen in Ottawa"}, {"url": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/former-canadian-general-fined-demoted-for-affair/article587799/", "page_content": "Daniel Menard, retired brigadier-general, pleaded guilty to having an illicit sexual affair with a subordinate on Thursday.Blair Gable/Reuters Share\n\nA former Canadian general was fined $7,000 and demoted by a court martial on Thursday for an on-base tryst with a female soldier that destroyed his career and tested the Canadian Forces' resolve to ban intimate relations between soldiers.\n\nDaniel M\u00e9nard already retired from the army - he came to court on Thursday in a business suit - but part of his punishment is the symbolic loss of rank from brigadier-general to colonel.\n\nThe sentence, pronounced by a military judge in Montreal, marks an ignominious end for a once-rising military star whose career collapsed in a conflagration of sex, lies and an attempted cover-up.\n\nMr. M\u00e9nard pleaded guilty to having a sexual relationship with Master Corporal Bianka Langlois while the two were stationed at the Kandahar Air Field base, and then of trying to thwart an investigation into the affair.\n\nThe court heard that the two had begun a relationship while based together at CFB Valcartier in Quebec and continued it after both deployed to Afghanistan in 2009, despite signing the Forces' non-fraternization policy.\n\nMr. M\u00e9nard, who is married with two children, had sex with Master Cpl. Langlois several times in his room at the base, and kissed her \"at least twice\" in his office, the court was told.\n\nWhile the trial was about the then-general's behaviour while he commanded nearly 3,000 troops in Afghanistan, it also cast a spotlight on the strict military rule that prohibits romantic or sexual relationships in theatre, even between spouses. The measure is seen as a means of enforcing discipline.\n\nBut Mr. M\u00e9nard's lawyer, Jean Asselin, says it's time for a constitutional challenge to the law, which he believes violates Charter rights. He says Mr. M\u00e9nard's relationship was a mostly victimless crime between two consenting adults.\n\nAs for Mr. M\u00e9nard, who addressed the court with clear and forthright answers, he expressed regret for hurting his family, though he made no mention of the impact on the troops under his command.\n\n\"I profoundly regret my behaviour, which made my wife and children suffer,\" he said.\n\nThe task of recalling the fallout on the Forces fell to Lieutenant-Colonel Louis-Vincent d'Auteuil, the military judge presiding over the court martial. He said the former general had betrayed the trust of soldiers placed under his command, and did so \"in the worst place at the worst time\" - while in the operational theatre where he needed to lead by example.\n\n\"You have the highest level of responsibility in a theatre of operation,\" the judge said. \"It was up to you to set an example.\"\n\nBut the judge also noted that the disgraced former general had had an exemplary career and did \"a lot of good things as an officer in the Canadian Forces.\"\n\nWhile the court martial amounted to a rare prosecution for such a high-ranking officer, Commander Martin Pelletier, prosecutor in the case, said it delivered the important message that the rules apply to everyone in the military, regardless of rank.\n\nThe tryst put an end to the career of a soldier who, at age 43, became one of the youngest officers to rise to the rank of general. The affair with Master Cpl. Langlois, who has since herself been fined and reprimanded, was brought to light by a U.S. journalist and blogger, who reported that the relationship was an open secret.\n\nIt was then left to investigators in Kandahar to question the general. He twice denied the liaison, then tried to convince Master Cpl. Langlois to change her story and delete incriminating e-mails.\n\nMr. M\u00e9nard says he paid a heavy price for his infidelity. He was removed from his command in June, 2010, and ordered home in disgrace; he retired ahead of his court martial. He said he was left to feel ostracized and isolated, and is currently looking for work. Despite his loss of rank, however, he will maintain his military pension.\n\n\"[It was]by far the worst [thing]I had experienced in my life, including all of the [military]conflicts I've been involved in,\" he said of his fall from grace.\n\nThursday's decision marks Mr. M\u00e9nard's second court martial.

The subordinate involved has been sent home, according to a military spokesman.\n\nBrigadier-General Jonathan Vance, Gen. M\u00e9nard's predecessor, will be returning to Kandahar this week to assume command less than a year after he left, arriving as coalition troops are poised to launch a major operation in Kandahar in June that is cast as the defining moment of the war.\n\nWhile Canadian military commanders in Afghanistan sought to down play the controversy as a personal ordeal, military observers and former officers said Gen. M\u00e9nard's dismissal could be damaging to the morale of the troops on the ground, and possibly taint Canadians' image of the armed forces.\n\nIt will certainly \"take away some of the glitter\" that was associated with Canadian soldiers' performance in Afghanistan, said Michel Drapeau, a professor of military law and a former armed forces colonel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is particularly unfortunate that it comes so soon after Colonel Russell Williams, the former base commander at CFB Trenton, was charged with multiple murders and sexual assaults, he said. While the allegations against Gen. M\u00e9nard are in no way similar, they will add to the public's concern about the quality of leadership in the armed forces and raise worries within the Forces as well, he said. \"People in the military [will say]'Here we go again,'\"\n\nHowever, the greatest impact, Mr. Drapeau said, will be on the morale of troops in Afghanistan who served under Gen. M\u00e9nard. \"It's devastating,\" he said. \"They [put]all of their trust and respect in him, and they were prepared to follow him into battle ... Their sense of confidence in leadership will take a hit.\"\n\nMilitary historian Jack Granatstein said it is important to note that the allegations against Gen. M\u00e9nard are \"infinitely less serious\" than those against Col. Williams. If proven, they will primarily demonstrate \"stupidity on the part of a commanding officer who's job it is to set an example.\"\n\nGen. M\u00e9nard commanded 2,800 Canadian soldiers in southern Afghanistan, as well as a contingent of American troops serving under Canadian command.\n\nThe allegations against him caused military command to \"lose confidence\" in his \"capacity to command,\" the military said in a brief statement. Military rules strictly forbid any kind of intimacy on deployments, including relationships of an emotional, romantic or sexual nature.\n\nGen. M\u00e9nard, is 42 and married with two children. Major Daryl Morrell, senior public affairs officer with Joint Task Force Afghanistan, said it was \"too early to speculate on the charges\" Gen. M\u00e9nard could face, because they won't be known until the military completes its investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLieutenant-General Marc Lessard, commander of Canadian forces overseas, made a brief visit to Afghanistan several weeks ago, before Gen. M\u00e9nard went on a three-week leave, from which he has just returned. However, reporters at Kandahar Air Field were told the allegations were only revealed to Gen. Lessard on Saturday. Lt.-Gen. Lessard acted immediately to replace Gen. M\u00e9nard.\n\nColonel Simon Hetherington, previously Brig.-Gen. M\u00e9nard's second-in-command, is now acting commander until Gen. Vance arrives. He sought to down play any consequences the allegations could have on the military's reputation.\n\n\"The allegations against Brig-Gen. M\u00e9nard are that - they're allegations,\" Col. Hetherington said. \"It's a personal thing, so I don't see that as any sort of mark against the institution at all,\" he added.\n\nDefence Minister Peter MacKay declined to comment on the case while it was under investigation by the military.\n\nMichael Byers, a professor of political science at the University of British Columbia, said that while it is clearly discouraging for troops to see a senior officer accused of breaking the rules, it also tells the public that those rules are being applied at all levels.\n\n\"I'm encouraged by the fact that M\u00e9nard was removed from his post, since it suggests that the Forces are taking the rules, and the rights and interests of female soldiers, seriously,\" Prof. Byers said.\n\nRetired major-general Lewis Mackenzie said the fact that Gen. M\u00e9nard was the commander in Afghanistan raises the situation above a minor issue, because he would be the one to make final decisions in other cases of inappropriate behaviour. \"He's the last level of authority in the theatre in disciplinary matters.\"\n\nDouglas Bland, the chair of defence management studies at the Queen's University School of Policy Studies, said the military has moved quickly to deal with leadership issues since the Somalia inquiry, when problems in command were linked to the fatal beating of a teenager by two Canadian soldiers during a humanitarian mission in Somalia. \"That is a sign of their sensitivity and seriousness about maintaining good order and discipline across the forces,\" he said.\n\nBut Prof. Bland said the rules prohibiting personal relationships are essential, especially in combat zones, \"where the integrity of the unit is supreme,\" and must be followed, particularly, by the highest-ranking soldiers.\n\nThis is not the first time controversy has dogged Gen. M\u00e9nard.\n\nLast week he was fined $3,500 for accidentally firing his rifle at Kandahar Air Field in March. He had failed to switch is C8 carbine rifle to the \"safe\" position before departing in a helicopter with his boss, General Walter Natynczyk.\n\nNobody was injured, but the incident qualifies as an offence under the National Defence Act, with a maximum penalty of dismissal from the military. At a military hearing into the incident, Gen. M\u00e9nard's defence lawyer argued for leniency, noting the commander reported the mishap to investigators and discussed the incident openly with his soldiers.\n\nBrig.-Gen M\u00e9nard joined the Canadian forces in 1984 and was posted to the Royal 22nd Regiment where initially served as a platoon commander.\n\nHe rose quickly through the ranks, serving in Great Britain, Berlin, Germany and Bosnia. He assumed command of Task Force Kandahar in November.\n\nWith a report from Erin Anderssen in Ottawa"}, {"url": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/dnd-paid-40k-for-disgraced-former-general-daniel-menard-s-move-1.1691277", "page_content": "The Department of National Defence paid nearly $40,000 to move a disgraced former brigadier-general from the Montreal area to the United Arab Emirates, according to the same documents that brought to light another former general\u2019s controversial $72,000 move within Ottawa.\n\nAccording to the documents, the department paid the $40,000 to move former brigadier-general Daniel Menard, who was demoted and later pleaded guilty to having improper relations with a subordinate, so he could take up his new job with private security firm GardaWorld as head of its Afghanistan operations.\n\nMenard led Canadian Forces in Afghanistan before being stripped of his command and sent home in June 2010 after his affair with the subordinate came to light.

The Forces ban all forms of sexual relations in the field, even between couples, to prevent an erosion of discipline and cohesion among soldiers fighting a war.\n\nThe Canadian Forces also alleged this week that Brig.-Gen. M\u00e9nard tried to thwart an investigation by asking MCpl. Langlois twice to withdraw a statement she'd made admitting to the relations.

In fact, Bell says he once even reported to M\u00e9nard during a stint in Kandahar province.\n\nAfghanistan's rules for private security contractors were toughened significantly several years ago.\n\n\"This was for licensing purposes and for generating revenue for the Afghanistan government,\" Bell said. \"It was also a way of tying a weapon to an individual if that weapon was ever used illegally.\"\n\nIt's happened to a lot of companies. - Alan Bell, security consultant\n\nThat Afghan system's rules require security companies to keep accurate, detailed records of all military equipment uses in Afghanistan including rifles, radios, ballistic helmets and other gear. Bell says those records are sent to Afghanistan's Interior Ministry along with licence fees.\n\nAfghan officials frequently audit security companies to ensure they only have the weapons they have licences to support.\n\nBell says these audits can frequently cause trouble for security companies in Afghanistan, in part because the requirements are onerous, but also because the Afghan system frequently doesn't operate with the same business ethics that Western companies are used to.\n\n\"It's happened to a lot of companies. These people turn up out of the blue and try to audit their weapons and what they have what they don't have,\" Bell said. \"When there is an audit and they find you've got X amount of weapons that haven't been listed or licensed, they take that very seriously.\n\n\"If you get caught, then you have a problem. They will arrest usually the country manager because is the one that is on the ground all the time,\" Bell said.\n\n\"They've arrested a lot of [expatriates] over the years and they fine then, they fine the company.

The measure is seen as a means of enforcing discipline.\n\nBut Mr. M\u00e9nard's lawyer, Jean Asselin, says it's time for a constitutional challenge to the law, which he believes violates Charter rights. He says Mr. M\u00e9nard's relationship was a mostly victimless crime between two consenting adults.\n\nAs for Mr. M\u00e9nard, who addressed the court with clear and forthright answers, he expressed regret for hurting his family, though he made no mention of the impact on the troops under his command.\n\n\"I profoundly regret my behaviour, which made my wife and children suffer,\" he said.\n\nThe task of recalling the fallout on the Forces fell to Lieutenant-Colonel Louis-Vincent d'Auteuil, the military judge presiding over the court martial. He said the former general had betrayed the trust of soldiers placed under his command, and did so \"in the worst place at the worst time\" - while in the operational theatre where he needed to lead by example.\n\n\"You have the highest level of responsibility in a theatre of operation,\" the judge said. \"It was up to you to set an example.\"\n\nBut the judge also noted that the disgraced former general had had an exemplary career and did \"a lot of good things as an officer in the Canadian Forces.\"\n\nWhile the court martial amounted to a rare prosecution for such a high-ranking officer, Commander Martin Pelletier, prosecutor in the case, said it delivered the important message that the rules apply to everyone in the military, regardless of rank.\n\nThe tryst put an end to the career of a soldier who, at age 43, became one of the youngest officers to rise to the rank of general. The affair with Master Cpl. Langlois, who has since herself been fined and reprimanded, was brought to light by a U.S. journalist and blogger, who reported that the relationship was an open secret.\n\nIt was then left to investigators in Kandahar to question the general. He twice denied the liaison, then tried to convince Master Cpl. Langlois to change her story and delete incriminating e-mails.\n\nMr. M\u00e9nard says he paid a heavy price for his infidelity. He was removed from his command in June, 2010, and ordered home in disgrace; he retired ahead of his court martial. He said he was left to feel ostracized and isolated, and is currently looking for work. Despite his loss of rank, however, he will maintain his military pension.\n\n\"[It was]by far the worst [thing]I had experienced in my life, including all of the [military]conflicts I've been involved in,\" he said of his fall from grace.\n\nThursday's decision marks Mr. M\u00e9nard's second court martial. He was fined $3,500 last year for accidentally discharging his weapon while walking with his boss, General Walter Natynczyk, to a helicopter at the Kandahar Air Field. It was the stiffest fine ever imposed for mishandling a weapon."}], "Daniel M\u00e9nard was the commander of the Canadian Forces in Afghanistan.": [{"url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/daniel-m%C3%A9nard-ex-canadian-general-released-from-afghan-prison-1.2543215", "page_content": "Daniel M\u00e9nard, the former Canadian brigadier-general held in an Afghan jail on gun-running charges, has been released from prison.\n\nM\u00e9nard had been imprisoned since January in his current role as an executive for private security company GardaWorld.\n\nA newspaper carrying a report from Kabul on Jan. 30 alleged M\u00e9nard's run-in with the law centred on accusations of possessing military equipment without permission, including 129 rifles and 148 radios.\n\nGardaWorld later told CBC News the issue had been resolved and that M\u00e9nard's release \"should happen imminently,\" but word of his actual release did not come until this week.\n\nGardaWorld confirmed M\u00e9nard's release in a statement to CBC News on Wednesday.\n\n\"This situation was about the administration of a license, as we disclosed previously, and not about gun-running,\" spokesman Joe Gavaghan said in an email to CBC News.\n\nM\u00e9nard was formerly a military commander for Canada's mission in Afghanistan.

The subordinate involved has been sent home, according to a military spokesman.\n\nBrigadier-General Jonathan Vance, Gen. M\u00e9nard's predecessor, will be returning to Kandahar this week to assume command less than a year after he left, arriving as coalition troops are poised to launch a major operation in Kandahar in June that is cast as the defining moment of the war.\n\nWhile Canadian military commanders in Afghanistan sought to down play the controversy as a personal ordeal, military observers and former officers said Gen. M\u00e9nard's dismissal could be damaging to the morale of the troops on the ground, and possibly taint Canadians' image of the armed forces.\n\nIt will certainly \"take away some of the glitter\" that was associated with Canadian soldiers' performance in Afghanistan, said Michel Drapeau, a professor of military law and a former armed forces colonel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is particularly unfortunate that it comes so soon after Colonel Russell Williams, the former base commander at CFB Trenton, was charged with multiple murders and sexual assaults, he said. While the allegations against Gen. M\u00e9nard are in no way similar, they will add to the public's concern about the quality of leadership in the armed forces and raise worries within the Forces as well, he said. \"People in the military [will say]'Here we go again,'\"\n\nHowever, the greatest impact, Mr. Drapeau said, will be on the morale of troops in Afghanistan who served under Gen. M\u00e9nard. \"It's devastating,\" he said. \"They [put]all of their trust and respect in him, and they were prepared to follow him into battle ... Their sense of confidence in leadership will take a hit.\"\n\nMilitary historian Jack Granatstein said it is important to note that the allegations against Gen. M\u00e9nard are \"infinitely less serious\" than those against Col. Williams. If proven, they will primarily demonstrate \"stupidity on the part of a commanding officer who's job it is to set an example.\"\n\nGen. M\u00e9nard commanded 2,800 Canadian soldiers in southern Afghanistan, as well as a contingent of American troops serving under Canadian command.\n\nThe allegations against him caused military command to \"lose confidence\" in his \"capacity to command,\" the military said in a brief statement. Military rules strictly forbid any kind of intimacy on deployments, including relationships of an emotional, romantic or sexual nature.\n\nGen. M\u00e9nard, is 42 and married with two children. Major Daryl Morrell, senior public affairs officer with Joint Task Force Afghanistan, said it was \"too early to speculate on the charges\" Gen. M\u00e9nard could face, because they won't be known until the military completes its investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLieutenant-General Marc Lessard, commander of Canadian forces overseas, made a brief visit to Afghanistan several weeks ago, before Gen. M\u00e9nard went on a three-week leave, from which he has just returned. However, reporters at Kandahar Air Field were told the allegations were only revealed to Gen. Lessard on Saturday. Lt.-Gen. Lessard acted immediately to replace Gen. M\u00e9nard.\n\nColonel Simon Hetherington, previously Brig.-Gen. M\u00e9nard's second-in-command, is now acting commander until Gen. Vance arrives. He sought to down play any consequences the allegations could have on the military's reputation.\n\n\"The allegations against Brig-Gen. M\u00e9nard are that - they're allegations,\" Col. Hetherington said. \"It's a personal thing, so I don't see that as any sort of mark against the institution at all,\" he added.\n\nDefence Minister Peter MacKay declined to comment on the case while it was under investigation by the military.\n\nMichael Byers, a professor of political science at the University of British Columbia, said that while it is clearly discouraging for troops to see a senior officer accused of breaking the rules, it also tells the public that those rules are being applied at all levels.\n\n\"I'm encouraged by the fact that M\u00e9nard was removed from his post, since it suggests that the Forces are taking the rules, and the rights and interests of female soldiers, seriously,\" Prof. Byers said.\n\nRetired major-general Lewis Mackenzie said the fact that Gen. M\u00e9nard was the commander in Afghanistan raises the situation above a minor issue, because he would be the one to make final decisions in other cases of inappropriate behaviour. \"He's the last level of authority in the theatre in disciplinary matters.\"\n\nDouglas Bland, the chair of defence management studies at the Queen's University School of Policy Studies, said the military has moved quickly to deal with leadership issues since the Somalia inquiry, when problems in command were linked to the fatal beating of a teenager by two Canadian soldiers during a humanitarian mission in Somalia. \"That is a sign of their sensitivity and seriousness about maintaining good order and discipline across the forces,\" he said.\n\nBut Prof. Bland said the rules prohibiting personal relationships are essential, especially in combat zones, \"where the integrity of the unit is supreme,\" and must be followed, particularly, by the highest-ranking soldiers.\n\nThis is not the first time controversy has dogged Gen. M\u00e9nard.\n\nLast week he was fined $3,500 for accidentally firing his rifle at Kandahar Air Field in March. He had failed to switch is C8 carbine rifle to the \"safe\" position before departing in a helicopter with his boss, General Walter Natynczyk.\n\nNobody was injured, but the incident qualifies as an offence under the National Defence Act, with a maximum penalty of dismissal from the military. At a military hearing into the incident, Gen. M\u00e9nard's defence lawyer argued for leniency, noting the commander reported the mishap to investigators and discussed the incident openly with his soldiers.\n\nBrig.-Gen M\u00e9nard joined the Canadian forces in 1984 and was posted to the Royal 22nd Regiment where initially served as a platoon commander.\n\nHe rose quickly through the ranks, serving in Great Britain, Berlin, Germany and Bosnia.

In fact, Bell says he once even reported to M\u00e9nard during a stint in Kandahar province.\n\nAfghanistan's rules for private security contractors were toughened significantly several years ago.\n\n\"This was for licensing purposes and for generating revenue for the Afghanistan government,\" Bell said. \"It was also a way of tying a weapon to an individual if that weapon was ever used illegally.\"\n\nIt's happened to a lot of companies. - Alan Bell, security consultant\n\nThat Afghan system's rules require security companies to keep accurate, detailed records of all military equipment uses in Afghanistan including rifles, radios, ballistic helmets and other gear. Bell says those records are sent to Afghanistan's Interior Ministry along with licence fees.\n\nAfghan officials frequently audit security companies to ensure they only have the weapons they have licences to support.\n\nBell says these audits can frequently cause trouble for security companies in Afghanistan, in part because the requirements are onerous, but also because the Afghan system frequently doesn't operate with the same business ethics that Western companies are used to.\n\n\"It's happened to a lot of companies. These people turn up out of the blue and try to audit their weapons and what they have what they don't have,\" Bell said. \"When there is an audit and they find you've got X amount of weapons that haven't been listed or licensed, they take that very seriously.\n\n\"If you get caught, then you have a problem. They will arrest usually the country manager because is the one that is on the ground all the time,\" Bell said.\n\n\"They've arrested a lot of [expatriates] over the years and they fine then, they fine the company. They usually confiscate the equipment that wasn't registered with them, and then you carry on business as normal.\n\n\"Then [Interior Ministry officials] go on to another company and do the same things.\"\n\nIt appears it's a situation similar to this that has M\u00e9nard spending time in jail. GardaWorld does lots of work in Afghanistan, including, at times, for the Canadian government.\n\nIt's also had more than one rules run-in with Afghan authorities.\n\nGardaWorld faced similar problem in 2012\n\nIn 2012, two British employees of GardaWorld were arrested by Afghan authorities and faced similar accusations after being found with 30 allegedly unlicensed AK-47s. At the time, GardaWorld maintained its employees were planning to buy the weapons but wanted to test their functionality on a range first.\n\nGardaWorld also faced a forced shutdown of its operations as a result of those arrests.\n\nThat dispute occurred in the early days of an Afghan government plan to take over and \"Afghanize\" most of the work undertaken by private security contractors in the war-torn country.\n\nBell says these latest accusations levelled against GardaWorld and M\u00e9nard remind him of that 2012 dispute.\n\n\"This is down to hard cash at the end of the day and whether Garda did have equipment that wasn't registered or not,\" Bell said. \"[Garda] obviously had their reason for doing that, now they've been found out so consequently they will have to pay the fines and then it will be business as usual and next week it will be another company.\n\n\"This has happened so many times with so many companies. It isn't rare.\"\n\nCanada's Foreign Affairs Department said it is aware of the arrest, and that \"consular services are being provided to a Canadian citizen who has been detained in Afghanistan.\""}, {"url": "https://www.intelligenceonline.com/corporate-intelligence_consultants/2016/11/09/daniel-menard,108188972-BRE", "page_content": "Intelligence Online uses cookies to provide reliable and secure features, measure and analyse website traffic and provide support to the website users.\n\n\n\nApart from those essential for the proper operation of the website, you can choose which cookies you accept to have stored on your device.\n\n\n\nEither \u201cAccept and close\u201d to agree to all cookies or go to \u201cManage cookies\u201d to review your options.

Daniel M\u00e9nard has been relieved of command of Canadian troops in Afghanistan following allegations he was involved in an inappropriate personal relationship while in theatre.\n\nMilitary sources have told CBC News that M\u00e9nard, head of Joint Task Force Kandahar, is alleged to have had an affair with a female member of his staff.\n\nThe military has strict rules forbidding its personnel from engaging in personal relationships while in theatre. They include relationships of an emotional, romantic or sexual nature.\n\nThe Defence Department issued a statement saying only that the decision was made following \"allegations concerning M\u00e9nard's inappropriate conduct related to the Canadian Forces personal relationships and fraternization directives.\"\n\nM\u00e9nard's spouse also serves in the Forces.\n\nCol. Simon Hetherington said Lt.-Gen.

In the near future, Brig.-Gen. Jon Vance will assume command, pending the arrival of the next commander, Brig.-Gen. Dean Milner, DND said.\n\nEarlier this week, M\u00e9nard was fined $3,500 \u2014 the stiffest fine ever levied on a soldier for mishandling a weapon.\n\nHe received the fine after pleading guilty to an offence under the National Defence Act in a court in Gatineau, Que.\n\nThe March 25 incident occurred as M\u00e9nard and his boss, chief of defence staff Gen. Walt Natynczyk, were about to board a Blackhawk helicopter at Kandahar Airfield.\n\nM\u00e9nard said he was loading his C8 carbine, something he has done thousands of times, when it discharged. No one was injured and nothing was damaged, but the National Defence Act makes it an offence to accidentally discharge a weapon.\n\nM\u00e9nard formally took over from Vance as top officer for Task Force Kandahar last November."}, {"url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/former-canadian-commander-and-subordinate-charged-1.927008", "page_content": "Canada's former top soldier in Kandahar, Brig.-Gen.
