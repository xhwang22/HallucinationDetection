The party held its 44th National Convention last weekend with record attendance in Laugardalsh\u00f6ll in Reykjav\u00edk. Benediktsson received 1010 out of total 1712 votes cast whereas \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson received 687 votes. Blank and void bills were 9 and others received 3 votes.\n\nA surprise challenge\n\nIt was only a few days before the meeting that \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson announced his intention of challenging Benediktsson for the leadership role and it caused quite a stir in the party. It was widely thought that \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson had been planning this move for up to two months, although it was only revealed shortly before the National meeting.\n\nBjarni Benediktsson and his wife, \u00de\u00f3ra Margr\u00e9t Baldvinsd\u00f3ttir. mbl.is/Eggert J\u00f3hannesson\n\n\"I'm in on it\"\n\n\u201cWhen you say, \u2018Let\u2019s do better, let\u2019s go further and jump a step higher,\u2019 I say, \u2018I\u2019m in on it!\u2019 \u201d said Bjarni when addressing party members once his win was secured and announced shortly after lunchtime on Sunday.\n\nBjarni has chaired the Independence Party since 2009, having succeeded Geir H. Haarde in his time.\n\nHe has been re-elected as chairman five times since then, at the party's national conferences, and this is therefore the sixth time. He has now been re-elected five times, and has had better representation on all occasions.\n\nBjarni Benediktsson and Gu\u00f0laugur \u00de\u00f3r \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson. Composition image\n\n\n\n\n\nFocusing on the results\n\nGu\u00f0laugur \u00de\u00f3r announced his candidacy on October 30th, or less than a week before the National Convention. It had become clear who would have a seat at the meeting. The last few days, the heat was turning up in the competition with supporters of each of the two candidates exchanging accusations of bad practices from the other.\n\nFew of the country's political scientists dared to predict the outcome, and it was widely assumed that a group of people would only make up their minds at the convention, after the end of each candidate's respective speeches.\n\nTurn defence into offense\n\n\u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson emphasized that the Independence Party must turn defense into a new offense, accusing the current leadership of having lost faith in the fact that it was a possibility. Benediktsson again pointed to the fact that party members were looking at the society that had been successfully created during the Independence Party\u2019s leadership and its steady hand in government.\n\nDelivering results\n\n\u201cI have always focused on delivering results for people, but this challenge shines a light on areas we can improve on, like being more active in listening to all the voices in the party,\u201d said Benediktsson to mbl.is after the results were clear.\n\n\u00de\u00f3rd\u00eds Kolbr\u00fan R. Gylfad\u00f3ttir Minister of Foreign Affairs was elected vice chairman of the Independence Party. mbl.is/Eggert J\u00f3hannesson\n\n\u201cWe need to heed to the call to continue the conversation but it is my belief that it is our good results and ongoing plans to continue delivering results that secured this win.\u201d\n\nMembers of the party must be a team\n\n- \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson got a fairly good vote, do you see that you\u2019ll be doing a lot of work to re-unify the party after this election?\n\n\"On my part, I see us coming together and becoming one team, so I don't have any major concerns about it at this point.\"\n\n- So you have no concerns about the approximately 600 votes?\n\nVilhj\u00e1lmur \u00c1rnason was elected the Secretary of the Independence Party. mbl.is/Eggert J\u00f3hannesson\n\n\u201cNo, I mean \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson got three thousand votes in a runoff election just over a year ago. He is leading the party in Reykjavik, which is of course a key constituency at the national level, and that\u2019s why it was always expected that he had some group of supporters here at the meeting, but I think it was a decisive victory.\u201d\n\nAsked what he takes with him from this experience of the National Convention, Bjarni says he feels the great will of all party members to participate and be active in the party.\n\nWill this change \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson's position in the party?\n\n\"Everybody is willing to contribute. People come here because they are interested in political issues and the political process and they are concerned with their community. We need to mobilise that interest finding a platform for it and a way forward.\u201d\n\n- Will these results have any consequences for \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson within the party?\n\n\"No, I'm not thinking about any of that right now at this point. I'm just happy with the result.\"\n\n-How will you celebrate your victory?\n\n\"With all my best people, all the people who have been supporting me. My family has something planned.\u201d\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.althingi.is/altext/cv/en/?nfaerslunr=33", "page_content": "Parliamentary career\n\nMember of Althingi for the Reykjav\u00edk North Constituency 2003\u20132009, for the Reykjav\u00edk South Constituency 2009\u20132016 and for the Reykjav\u00edk North Constituency since 2016 (Independence Party).\n\nParty group\n\nChair of the Independence Party's parliamentary group 2016\u20132017.\n\nDeputy Chair of the Independence Party's parliamentary group 2013\u20132016 and 2005\u20132007.\n\nPrevious committees\n\nMember of the Budget Committee 2016\u20132017 and 2013\u20132016 (1st Deputy Chair 2013\u20132016).\n\nMember of the Foreign Affairs Committee 2013\u20132014.\n\nMember of the Economic Affairs and Trade Committee 2011\u20132013.\n\nMember of the Health Committee 2009\u20132011.\n\nMember of the Trade Committee 2009\u20132011.\n\nMember of the Environment Committee 2003\u20132007 (Chair 2004\u20132007).\n\nMember of the Fisheries Committee 2003\u20132007.\n\nMember of the Social Affairs Committee on 2003\u20132006 (Deputy Chair 2003\u20132006).\n\nMember of the EU-Iceland joint Parliamentary Committee 2013\u20132016 (Chair 2013\u20132016).\n\nMember of the Icelandic delegation to the EFTA and EEA Parliamentary Committees 2013\u20132016 (Chair 2013\u20132016).\n\nMember of the Icelandic delegation to the EFTA Parliamentary Committee 2003\u20132007 (Chair 2005\u20132007).\n\nMinisterial career\n\nMinister of the Environment, Energy and Climate since 2021.\n\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and International Development Cooperation 2019\u20132021.\n\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and External Trade 2017\u20132019.\n\nMinister of Health and Social Security 2007\u20132009.\n\nPolitical party career\n\nMember of Reykjav\u00edk City Council 1998\u20132006.

They have for a long time brought attention to human rights violations in the Philippines.\n\nThe resolution mandates a comprehensive written report into the human rights situation in the Philippines, the BBC reports, with a focus on reports of extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances.\n\n\u201cThis is proof that our voice and our work make a difference,\u201d Icelandic Foreign Minister Gu\u00f0laugur \u00de\u00f3r \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson tells mbl.is.\n\n\u201cWe are fortunate enough to enjoy human rights in Iceland, which we take for granted,\u201d he notes, but adds that in many places in the world, such is not the case. \u201cIt is our duty to contribute to the fight for improving the state of human rights affairs in the world,\u201d he states.\n\nIceland was elected to take a seat on the UN Human Rights Council in July of last year, replacing the United States, which had withdrawn its membership.

As French philosopher, and contributor of the Encyclopedie Denis Diderot, said \"Indeed, the purpose of an encyclopedia is to collect knowledge disseminated around the globe; to set forth its general system to the men with whom we live, and transmit it to those who will come after us, so that the work of preceding centuries will not become useless to the centuries to come; and so that our offspring, becoming better instructed, will at the same time become more virtuous and happy, and that we should not die without having rendered a service to the human race. \"\n\nAccessibility World Heritage Encyclopedia, (WorldHeritage.org) is a live collaboration differing from paper-based reference sources in important ways. Unlike printed encyclopedias, we are continually editing, updating, and appending, articles on historic events appearing within minutes, rather than months or years. WorldHeritage.org is fully accessible on a tablet, smartphone, laptop, desktop computer, or any Internet-connected device with a Web browser.\n\nIs Print Obsolete?\n\n\"Thinking beyond the format\", Encyclopedias join a long list of paper we once thought we couldn't live without, like the Sears catalog, Yellow Pages and maps. Even the world famous Encyclopedia Britannica will no longer be printed after 244 years, the final edition costing almost $1400. Today, the modern encyclopedia is often in electronic form and much more affordable then the traditional paper versions. Unlike many online encyclopedias, World Heritage Encyclopedia is an aggregation of professionally written, crowd sourced, peer reviewed, and edited articles, making our information the most reliable and complete encyclopedia. On-line encyclopedias offer the additional advantage of being dynamic; new information can be presented almost immediately as it is happening in the world.
