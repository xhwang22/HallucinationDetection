But while we know enough about him and his Father Mychal, there are also his brothers who have had their own successes but have hardly been discussed.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this article, we will briefly look into the careers and lives of Mychel and Trayce Thompson.\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is Mychel Thompson?\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image source: Mychel Thompson\u2019s Instagram page)\n\n\n\n\n\nMychel Thompson is a former professional basketball player who played in the NBA and overseas. He was born on June 1, 1988, in Los Angeles, California. Mychel is famously known as the older brother of NBA superstar Klay Thompson.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly Life\n\nThompson attended Santa Margarita Catholic High School in Rancho Santa Margarita, California where he played high school basketball. During his time at Santa Margarita Catholic High School, Thompson developed into a solid player and helped lead his team to a state championship during his senior year.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoining Pepperdine\n\nAfter finishing high school, Mychel went on to attend Pepperdine University where he played college basketball for four years. During his college career with the Pepperdine Waves men's basketball team from 2007-2011, Mychel averaged roughly 11 points, 4.3 rebounds, 1.6 assists, and 1.1 steals per game while shooting around forty percent from three-point range.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis Professional Career\n\nDespite having a successful college career, Mychel wasn't selected in the NBA draft after graduating from Pepperdine. However, he did manage to earn himself some tryouts with various teams which led him to eventually sign with the Cleveland Cavaliers' G-League affiliate team called the Erie Bayhawks for their inaugural season back in 2011-12.\n\n\n\n\n\nMychel spent two seasons playing for Erie before signing with another G-League team called the Santa Cruz Warriors prior to their debut season in 2012-13 which happens to be affiliated to the State Warriors; coincidentally it is also Klay's current NBA Team.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring his time playing professional basketball both domestically and overseas (he has also played internationally), Thompson showcased his all-around game that enabled him not only score points but also defend well and distribute effectively making him a valuable asset of any team willing enough to take a chance on him.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that many people associate Mychal mostly through being related or having ties with younger brother Klay who has grown into one of the league\u2019s best players, it's worth noting that he had a successful career in his own right.\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is Trayce Thompson?\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image source: dodgerblue.com)\n\n\n\n\n\nTrayce Thompson is a professional baseball player who has made a name for himself in Major League Baseball (MLB).\n\n\n\n\n\nHis Early Life\n\nTrayce was born on March 15th, 1991 in Ladera Heights, California.

It was expected that Klay Thompson could return to the Warriors around Christmas, when the team is scheduled to have a couple of home games.\n\nThe plan had been for Thompson to spend time in the G-League to get practice repititions as the next step in his rehabilitation.

Shortly after that, he tore his Achilles during a preseason workout. It's safe to say Thompson has had an incredible journey to find his way back to the NBA floor. He's had to remain patient and upbeat with the fact that his path back to the sport he loves so much would be one of the toughest opponents he's ever faced.\n\nIt now appears Thompson is facing his final hurdles as he prepares to rejoin his Golden State Warriors teammates again. The good news for Thompson is his team is firing on all cylinders. Golden State has the best record in the league, and the roster has suddenly started to come together.\n\nThere's no doubt fellow \"Splash Brother\" Stephen Curry will be overjoyed to get Thompson back on the floor as well.

And he said to me right before the elevator doors opened: 'Are you gonna make anything of yourself while you are here?' Before I could say anything, the doors opened and he was gone.\"\n\nHolland didn't take the comment personally. But it certainly motivated him.\n\n\n\n\"I wanted to be the best I could,\" said Holland.\n\nNo doubt, Holland maxed out his ability during a strong career at Purdue.\n\nHe arrived on campus with a fat scrapbook after an uber successful career at Indianapolis power Bishop Chatard High, where he rushed for 2,048 yards on 239 carries (8.6 average) and 35 touchdowns during his senior season. Holland set the Chatard record for career rushing yards (5,270).\n\nThe 6-1, 229-pound Holland transitioned from offense to defense and went on to a strong career in West Lafayette, totaling 324 career tackles and starting 48 games with the Boilermakers from 2008-2011 after redshirting in 2007. He was a co-captain his senior season, a four-year starter and a two-time Academic All-American.\n\n\n\nIndeed, Holland made a lot of himself at Purdue.\n\n\n\nHolland enjoyed a cup-of-coffee NFL career, toiling on several practice squads before enrolling in dental school.\n\nGoldandBlack.com caught up with the 31-year-old Holland this week.\n\nGoldandBlack.com: What was your inspiration to become a dentist?\n\nHolland: I went to Purdue with the plan to be some sort of doctor, just didn't know what field. The beauty of being on the football team was you were exposed to a roomful of doctors and athletic trainers. So, I had a board of people I could bounce ideas off of in terms of what made a lot of sense career-wise. So, I spoke with a couple of the doctors at Purdue and opted for dental school. Everyone said you can't really go wrong. And I did. I always did have a little bit of an interest in dentistry. And as I got a little bit further along in my college career, I kind of shifted my focus towards that. And thankfully I was accepted into dental school my senior year. And IU allowed me to defer enrollment as I gave the NFL a shot and got thrown onto practice squads. I then was able to go into dental school just one year after my last season in the NFL.\n\nGoldandBlack.com: How long have you been practicing?\n\nHolland: I just finished my second year of private practice (Holland Dental). I purchased the practice January 3rd this year. I had been an associate at a practice in Fishers for a while and that was all going great, and I really loved the doctor I was working with. But part of what drew me to dentistry in the first place was the ability to own your own practice. Since I had graduated from dental school, I began putting out feelers about who was looking to sell. And I was connected with the doctor that I've just purchased the practice from. He was the team dentist for the Colts. It just seemed to make too much sense. I\u2019m on the west side of Indianapolis. The practice I purchased is in the Eagle Creek area.\n\nGoldandBlack.com: Are you married? Any children?\n\nHolland: I\u2019m married. I have an anniversary coming up in June. No kids yet, but our dog keeps us busy.\n\nGoldandBlack.com: How did you end up at Purdue?\n\nHolland: I played tailback at Chatard, which I think even sometimes I forget. I\u2019d never played defense more than a handful of snaps until I got to Purdue. We always ran the ball at Chatard. I kind of thought I potentially would have the chance to play running back in college. And it became pretty clear that that was not really anybody's plan. I was originally recruited as a safety. The only school that even really mentioned the possibility of starting out at tailback was IU. And I really think that was just a way to try to maybe become a more attractive option. But at that point, I kind of accepted the transition to defense and actually looked forward to the transition.\n\nGoldandBlack.com: What other schools did you consider?\n\nHolland: I was actually offered by Northwestern by Randy Walker just a handful of weeks before he ended up passing away. And so I went up there and I met with Pat Fitzgerald and was very impressed by everything. But I went to a game and it really wasn't a big college football environment. The very next week, I went to Purdue and saw it beat Minnesota. The environment, the stadium, everything about that trip was good. That kind of cemented it. Purdue was always the place I wanted to go. It provided the college football experience, provided the academics, the resources and the support ... it had all I needed.\n\nGoldandBlack.com: How tough was it to transition to defense?\n\nHolland: I was wide open to the transition from running back to safety and was looking forward to that. I did not have as open of a mind to the transition from safety to linebacker. I think it was mostly because I got to Purdue at about 205 pounds, and it never came easy to me to gain weight. It was always a struggle to gain size.\n\nGoldandBlack.com: Did anyone talk to you about moving to linebacker from safety?\n\nHolland: (Defensive coordinator/linebackers coach) Brock Spack had mentioned to me in recruitment and during my redshirt year when I was still playing safety that he would love to see me move to linebacker. I think that was probably always the plan. I went through all of my redshirt freshman training camp at safety. And at that time was gonna get in the rotation on nickel and dime situations. I really wasn't gonna play a huge role defensively at that position anyway, and they moved me to outside linebacker right behind Jason Werner. A couple days after they moved me, Jason went down with a season-ending back injury. So, about five days in at linebacker, I was getting ready to start. I took my bumps and bruises that redshirt freshman year. With a little size and a little bit more experience, I got a little better every single year. It really wasn't until my senior year where I really felt like I was well-suited for linebacker and I was playing the position that I should be playing.\n\nGoldandBlack.com: How was your senior year?\n\nHolland: My senior year was a blast because I was fighting. I was bigger and stronger and faster than I've ever had been and things were coming a little more naturally to me than they had in the past. I can't believe how lucky I was to start as many games as I did. And I was in that position by happenstance.\n\nStory continues below photo\n\n"}, {"url": "https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nba--stephen-curry-s--klay-thompson-s-brothers-to-play-together-for-warriors--d-league-team-234239645.html", "page_content": "The brothers of the Golden State Warriors' starting backcourt now have a chance to start together in the NBA Development League.\n\nThe D-League Santa Cruz Warriors acquired forward Mychel Thompson, the brother of Warriors guard Klay Thompson, from Sioux Falls for a second-round pick.

He won a third championship with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016.\n\nSelected first overall in the 2003 National Basketball Association (NBA) draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers , LeBron James played for the Cavaliers through the end of the 2009\u201310 season. He then signed with the Miami Heat and won two championships before returning to the Cavaliers in 2014. James joined the Los Angeles Lakers in 2018.\n\nBorn and raised in Akron , Ohio, LeBron James was a locally known basketball prodigy. In high school James led St. Vincent\u2013St. Mary High School to three state championships in four years. He was named Ohio\u2019s Mr. Basketball, or high-school player of the year, three times during 2001\u201303.\n\nLeBron James is an American professional basketball player.

He has competed in several men\u2019s Olympic basketball tournaments. Today he is widely considered one of the greatest all-around basketball players of all time.\n\nLeBron James, in full LeBron Raymone James, byname King James, (born December 30, 1984, Akron, Ohio, U.S.), American professional basketball player who is widely considered one of the greatest all-around players of all time and who won National Basketball Association (NBA) championships with the Miami Heat (2012 and 2013), the Cleveland Cavaliers (2016), and the Los Angeles Lakers (2020). In 2023 he became the NBA\u2019s all-time leading scorer, breaking the record (38,387) previously held by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nA locally known basketball prodigy since elementary school, James was named Ohio\u2019s Mr. Basketball (high-school player of the year) three times while leading Akron\u2019s St. Vincent\u2013St. Mary High School to three Ohio state championships in his four years on the team. He became a national media sensation in his junior year after appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated, where he was billed by the magazine as \u201cThe Chosen One.\u201d James was the consensus national high-school player of the year in his senior season, and he was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall selection of the 2003 NBA draft. Additionally, he signed an unprecedented $90 million endorsement contract with the Nike shoe company before he ever played a professional game.\n\nBritannica Quiz Sports Quiz\n\nDespite the pressures brought on by these singular circumstances, James led the Cavaliers in scoring, steals, and minutes played over the course of the 2003\u201304 season, winning the league\u2019s Rookie of the Year award in the process. A 6-foot 8-inch (2.03-metre) \u201cpoint forward\u201d who was as adept at bringing the ball down the court as at playing near the basket, James presented a unique challenge for opposing teams; his unmatched athleticism and well-muscled body would not have been out of place in the National Football League.\n\nHis game progressed over the following years. He was voted one of the starting forwards on the Eastern Conference All-Star team during his second season, and in his third season he led the Cavaliers to their first playoff berth in nine years. These accomplishments were exceeded during the 2006\u201307 season, when James guided Cleveland to the franchise\u2019s first berth in the NBA finals. After the Cavaliers upset the favoured Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals, the Cavaliers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA finals, but James\u2019s impressive postseason play led many observers to place him among the very best players in the league. He led the NBA in scoring during the 2007\u201308 season and earned first team All-NBA honours, but the Cavaliers lost to the eventual champion Boston Celtics in a dramatic seven-game series in the Eastern Conference semifinals. James piloted the Cavaliers to a team-record 66 wins during the 2008\u201309 season, which helped to earn him the league\u2019s Most Valuable Player (MVP) award. The following season James averaged nearly 30 points per game as he was again named MVP.\n\nAt the end of the 2009\u201310 season, James became arguably the most sought-after free agent in NBA history when his contract with the Cavaliers expired, and he began a prolonged courtship process with a number of teams that had in some cases been planning for his free agency for over two years. In an unprecedented hour-long television special, criticized by many for its undue grandiosity, James announced that he was signing with the Heat. He helped Miami reach the NBA finals in his first year with the team, but the Heat lost the championship to the Dallas Mavericks. In the 2011\u201312 season James averaged 27.1 points per game and won his third MVP award while helping Miami advance to its second consecutive NBA finals appearance. Backed by his stellar play\u2014James was named the finals MVP\u2014the Heat defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder to win the championship.\n\nHe had arguably his greatest individual season in 2012\u201313, as he averaged 26.8 points, 7.3 assists, and a career-high 8.0 rebounds per game while posting a .565 field-goal percentage, a remarkable rate of made shots for someone who so frequently played away from the basket. James also helped Miami win 27 consecutive games that season (the second longest such streak in NBA history), and he was rewarded with his fourth league MVP award. In the following postseason, the Heat defeated the San Antonio Spurs in a seven-game series to win the NBA championship, and James was again named the finals MVP. He continued his stellar play in the following season, even increasing his shooting percentage by .002, and he again led the Heat to an appearance in the NBA finals. However, Miami lost that rematch with the Spurs in a five-game series.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nAfter that finals loss, James opted out of his contract with the Heat, leaving an aging Miami roster, and\u2014after a week of frenzied speculation among fans and media\u2014he decided to return to Cleveland. Although his 25.3 points per game was James\u2019s lowest scoring average since his rookie season, he nevertheless guided a young and inexperienced Cavaliers roster to the second best record in the Eastern Conference in 2014\u201315. In the following postseason he led an injury-laden Cleveland team to just two playoff losses en route to a berth in the NBA finals. There James had one of the greatest individual performances in finals history, averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game while leading the undermanned Cavaliers to the franchise\u2019s first two finals victories before ultimately losing a six-game series to the Golden State Warriors.\n\nJames had another strong regular season in 2015\u201316 but, once again, truly shined in the playoffs. He led the Cavaliers to a rematch against the Warriors, who had set a league record with 73 wins during the regular season, in the NBA finals. There the Cavaliers became the first team to come back from a 3\u20131 finals deficit to capture the first title in franchise history and end a 52-year title drought for Cleveland professional sports teams. James averaged 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.6 steals, and 2.3 blocks per game in the finals\u2014becoming the first person to lead all five statistical categories for players on both teams in the finals\u2014and was unanimously named finals MVP.\n\nIn 2016\u201317 James had arguably his best regular season by setting career highs with averages of 8.7 assists and 8.6 rebounds per game while still scoring 26.4 points per game. He sustained his excellence in the Eastern Conference playoffs, scoring 32.5 points per game (which included his 5,988th career postseason point, breaking Michael Jordan\u2019s all-time NBA playoff scoring record) while leading the Cavaliers to a third consecutive match-up against the Warriors in the NBA finals. There Cleveland could not overcome the team James referred to as a \u201cjuggernaut,\u201d losing to the Warriors in five games despite James becoming the first player in NBA history to average a triple-double over the course of the finals (with 33.6 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists per game).\n\nIn 2017\u201318 he played a full 82-game regular season for the first time in his career and led the NBA in minutes played per game (36.9) while averaging 27.5 points, 8.6 rebounds, and a new career-high 9.1 assists per game. James again excelled in the following playoffs, scoring more than 40 points seven times in the team\u2019s 18 Eastern Conference postseason games (which included two seven-game series) to lead the Cavaliers to their fourth straight NBA finals series against the Warriors. He continued his strong individual play in the finals, but it was not enough to overcome Golden State\u2019s overwhelming talent advantage, and the Warriors swept the series.\n\nIn the following off-season, James, a free agent, joined the Los Angeles Lakers. He continued to play at a high level, averaging 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game, but he missed significant playing time because of an injury (a strained groin) for the first time in his career. The Lakers struggled in his absence and ultimately finished the 2018\u201319 season with a 37\u201345 record, ending James\u2019s personal playoff streak at 13 seasons. The following season was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a four-month suspension. Play resumed in July 2020 with a shortened schedule, and the Lakers ultimately defeated the Miami Heat to claim the franchise\u2019s 17th NBA title. James\u2019s dominating performance\u2014he averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game\u2014earned him his fourth finals MVP award.\n\nIn addition to his achievements in the NBA, James was a member of the U.S. men\u2019s Olympic basketball teams that won the bronze medal at the 2004 Games, the gold medal at the 2008 Games, and the gold at the 2012 Games. He also published a memoir, Shooting Stars (2009; cowritten with Buzz Bissinger), that chronicles his years as a high-school standout."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/joe.holland/2246580", "page_content": "Joe Holland\n\nbasketball player\n\nSeptember 26, 1925 (age 84) Benton, Kentucky, Marshall County, United States of America\n\nHolland, a 6\"4 forward from Benton, Kentucky, played for Kentucky from 1945 to 1948.

(0:28)\n\nRon Holland, the No. 2-ranked senior in boys' high school basketball for the class of 2023, told ESPN he will play for the G League Ignite next season.\n\nHolland decommitted from Texas in late April, although he wasn't released from his letter of intent until recently. Arkansas was perceived as the early favorite if he went the college route, given the Razorbacks were one of his original finalists in early November.\n\nBut the G League Ignite path, which has produced the likes of Jalen Green and Scoot Henderson since its inception in 2020, quickly became a legitimate option for Holland, who is No. 6 in ESPN's early 2024 NBA draft rankings.\n\n\"This process was not easy,\" Holland told ESPN. \"At times it was scary because at times I had no idea where I would be.\n\n\"The G League will help me reach my potential as a basketball player and prepare me for the NBA. To have a long career, I need to prepare my body and improve my skills as I continue to try to win games. They have a program to help develop my body and my game. I know I have to work on being a more consistent shooter, along with my footwork and ball handling, so I can score in space on the perimeter against a set defender.\"\n\nHolland also developed a strong relationship with Ignite coach Jason Hart.\n\n\"When I spoke with head coach Jason Hart, we were on the same page,\" Holland said. \"He knew that winning was important to me, but he also understands that I am willing to work hard to earn everything.\"\n\nA 6-foot-8 forward from Duncanville (Texas) High School, Holland steadily rose up the rankings last spring and summer before finishing just behind top prospect Isaiah Collier in the final 2023 rankings.\n\nHe's one of the best defenders in the class and an elite two-way player who won two gold medals with USA Basketball. Holland started six games at the FIBA U16 Americas in 2021, averaging 19 points.0 and 10.2 rebounds, then started all seven games at the FIBA U17 world championship last summer, averaging 11.1 points and 6.6 rebounds.\n\nLast spring and summer with the Drive Nation grassroots program, Holland averaged 10.0 points and 5.8 rebounds on the Nike EYBL circuit.\n\nHolland solidified his status among the current crop of seniors with stellar showings at the McDonald's All American Game and Nike Hoop Summit this spring. He had 11 points and 6 rebounds at the McDonald's game and then went for 15 points, 9 rebounds and 5 assists at the Hoop Summit.\n\nHolland is an NBA-level athlete with great bounce and open-court speed. His defensive presence is currently his top skill. His ability to stop his opponent in one-on-one situations or rotate over and be a help defender is elite. He is also a great switch defender, something the NBA has increasingly coveted. His versatility to stay in front of the ball against smaller and quicker players off the dribble, contest shooters on the perimeter, or play post defense against bigger and stronger forwards is noteworthy.\n\nAs an offensive player, Holland knows how to find scoring opportunities by moving without the ball, attacking the offensive glass and running the floor for transition baskets. His determination and effort make him a consistent rebounder. At the McDonald's All American Game, NBA scouts walked away impressed by his in-game performance and jump shot mechanics.\n\nHolland is the second elite 2023 prospect to choose G League Ignite, following fellow top-five senior Matas Buzelis. Versatile wing Dink Pate, a top-30 prospect, also recently announced he was reclassifying into the 2023 class and playing for G League Ignite.\n\n\"They won't let me slip up and I won't let them down -- that's a great combination,\" Holland said. \"They have everything in place for me both on and off the court. On my visit, they showed me how they approach their business both on and off the court. They are in the gym with their guys. If you are not a gym rat, it might not be for you. The G League is all about preparation for the NBA with other professional development. It's what I am willing to work for.\""}]}
