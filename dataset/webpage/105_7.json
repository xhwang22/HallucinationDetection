He emphasizes York\u2019s successes, but by no means avoids its obstacles and problems. The result is a history that effectively delineates the university as observers and participants broadly saw it over time\u2026Horn\u2019s history is buoyant and optimistic\u2026\u201d\n\n-Paul Stortz, Literary Review of Canada, Vol. 17, No. 2, March 2009\n\nTORONTO, March 26, 2009 -- On Thursday, March 26, 2009, York University marks a momentous occasion\u2014the 50th anniversary of the York University Act. A year-long celebration will include numerous \u201cU50\u201d events showcasing the successes that have been built by the faculty, researchers, students, administrators, and partners from different disciplines over five decades.\n\nAs a memorial for this landmark occasion, York is publishing a history of the university. York University: The Way Must Be Tried is a co-publication with McGill-Queen\u2019s University Press. In 2002, President Lorna Marsden named Michiel Horn, Professor Emeritus of History, Glendon College of York University, as the author of the official history of York University.\n\nYork University: The Way Must Be Tried is a definitive history. Michiel Horn has drawn together the vision and the people who have contributed to the greatness of York. He documents the founding of a brand new university, with 76 students and 50 faculty members, and follows the making of this major institution right through to the position that York University has achieved to date \u2013 the third-largest university in Canada, with 52,000 students enrolled in 11 faculties on two campuses (2007 figures). Horn deftly weaves together the archival research with anecdotes he gleaned from personal interviews with over 250 faculty members, Senate members, Board members, administrative staff, and students to shape his compelling image of York University.\n\nSays Horn, \u201cYork has grown, sometimes according to plan, sometimes haphazardly, sometimes in response to external forces, but almost always in the spirit of (its motto)\u2014\u201cTentanda Via, the way must be tried.\u201d\n\nThe Odyssey Begins\n\nThe institutional odyssey started in 1957 when a group of Toronto business and professional people saw an opportunity to meet the demands for adult education in the fastest-growing city in Canada. With the availability of public funds through the federal government and the anticipated impact of the baby boomers in the 1960s, the organizing committee received the green light to establish a university in federation with the University of Toronto.\n\nOn March 26, 1959, the York University Act received royal assent.\n\nThe Original Vision: A Small Liberal Arts University\n\nFrom the beginning, the establishment of York University was seen as an opportunity to develop a unique intellectual environment. If you were to choose one word to describe York\u2019s ethos, it is \u201cinterdisciplinarity\u201d\u2014\u201cthe commitment of faculty members and students to make an effort to look and reach across disciplinary boundaries in their teaching, learning, and research,\u201d says Horn.\n\nThe first president, Murray G. Ross, conceived of the original vision for York as a small liberal arts university with a program that would focus on \u201cliberal and general education, as opposed to one of specialization.\u201d In early 1962, Ross believed that growth should be slow and guided. However, a report by the Committee of Presidents of the Universities of Ontario warned that enrolment would increase more rapidly than expected. York\u2019s Board of Governors made the decision to expand\u2014the target: 7,000 students by 1970.\n\nWith this decision, Ross ran into opposition from the faculty. This led to one of the first confrontations York would witness between a president and the faculty, with Ross being charged with not living up to earlier agreements. In the end, the board sided with Ross. The incident is now part of York University\u2019s folklore and mythology.\n\nOver the course of Ross\u2019 tenure, York grew enormously. By 1970, 9,000 full-time students and 6,300 part-time undergraduates were enrolled on two campuses. York\u2019s budget had increased to $29 million, with 700 faculty members and 1,700 administration staff. This rapid growth had been demanded by the government and was necessary to meet the demographic realities.\n\nKeele Campus\n\nOn many levels, the rapid growth of York University mirrors the incredible growth of the GTA. Early students on the Keele campus pictured themselves as \u201cpioneers.\u201d The major construction projects under way gave the campus a vital energy. It was brand new and the students themselves were often the first in their families to attend a university\u2014a pattern that continues to this day.\n\nYork University was often prescient in seeing trends ahead of the curve, then building to meet the needs posited by these trends. In 1961, when the Toronto Board of Education stressed the necessity of improved access to higher education for adults, Ross\u2019 long-range vision of an evening college with its own program of study, targeting working people, was justified, and York established the Joseph E. Atkinson College.\n\nIn 1968, Osgoode Hall Law School became a faculty at York. Osgoode developed the reputation for engaging the law with other disciplines in exciting and imaginative ways and this was a major attraction for both faculty and students. In 1971, Osgoode\u2019s operation of Parkdale Community Legal Services became a story of success for the community; by 2005 Ontario had 75 clinics modeled on Parkdale, which was \u201cthe jewel in the crown of the legal clinic system.\u201d\n\nEarly Milestones\n\nIn 1965, York reached two milestones\u2014a new York University Act was passed and the university severed ties to the University of Toronto. York, eager to celebrate its independence, launched its own fundraising campaign, the York University Founders Fund Campaign.\n\nIn 1963, the twenty-year master plan for York University was released: by 1980 the enrolment target would be 20,000 students, 1700 faculty and 3200 other staff members. Glendon would be home to the liberal arts university modelled on US institutions such as Amherst, Atkinson College would continue to develop as planned and the Keele campus would be home to a multi-faculty university with both undergraduate and graduate programs. The total cost for the completion of the complex of buildings necessary to support the master plan came to $150 million\u2014money that would come from the provincial government and the Founders Fund Campaign.\n\nIn 1965, Ross appointed Escott Reid to be the founding principal of Glendon College. Reid proposed that Glendon become bilingual and bicultural\u2014\u201cGlendon College should play a great role in helping to train a new generation of Canadians who would make a better job of relations between English- and French-speaking Canadians than their parents and grandparents.\u201d Students who applied to Glendon were attracted by its small size and by the opportunity to improve or maintain their French-language skills. And Glendon\u2019s public forums attracted political heavyweights such as Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, Ramsay Cook, and Eric Kierans.\n\nThe Meaning of the Historic Events of 1972\n\nThe years 1972/1973 witnessed the most dramatic episode in York\u2019s history. In 1972, York\u2019s deans were in full revolt against President David Slater, and this forced the Board of Governors to secure his resignation. It began in the fall of 1972, when provincial government grants to universities were lower and enrolment had fallen. York seemed to be bucking this trend and the academic planners prepared optimistic forecasts, with \u201creal monies being committed on a hypothetical income.\u201d As a result, a modest rise in enrolment resulted in a $4-million shortfall for York. Slater recommended that the Senate consider the dismissal of tenured and untenured faculty for budgetary reasons. However, his indecision in the face of opposition from the Senate and the faculty called his leadership into question.\n\nIn fact, says Horn, York\u2019s structures were unequal to the challenges caused by the shortfall. People were looking for someone to blame and Slater became the victim. Horn, who was monitoring the meetings with great concern for the welfare and security of the faculty, gives a riveting, first-person account of this struggle.\n\nIn 1974, H. Ian Macdonald, a former Deputy Minister of Economics, was named York\u2019s third president. His greatest challenge\u2014 dealing with the bad press that York had received.\n\nFuture Tense\n\nBy 2008, the Keele campus had changed dramatically. The architectural face of York University has grown. The New Archives of Ontario is currently under construction and the Seymour Schulich Building has been finished. The campus population, which is the equivalent to a city the size of Belleville on a weekday, reflects the multicultural nature of Toronto\u2014the two most prominent groups on campus being those of Chinese and South Asian heritage.\n\nHorn explains that \u201cthe heterogeneity of the student body has presented challenges. The issue of race has been contentious over the years.\u201d A number of high-profile confrontations between groups with conflicting views prompted York University to issue a statement on York Values in 2008 during the celebration of their fifth annual Multi-cultural Week, calling for a \u201creciprocity of respect.\u201d\n\nIn 1992, a report on the future of York University for the coming three decades, entitled 2020 Vision: The Future of York, recommended York become a \u201ccomprehensive university, developing its own distinctive idiom with a focus on growth...\u201d In this quest, York has become more research-intensive. Current President Mamdouh Shoukri is committed to raising York\u2019s research profile in health and the pure sciences and engineering. With the successful launch of the Faculty of Health, York has now positioned itself to make a case for a medical school.\n\nToday, universities focus on public-private partnerships that work toward practical applications. To this end, two faculties will be merged on July 1, 2009, to form the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies\u2014Atkinson College and the Faculty of Arts. Horn sees this as a unique opportunity to re-shape the university\u2019s future in the 50th anniversary year.\n\nInternationally, York University\u2019s strengths are perceived to be the social sciences, the fine arts, the Seymour Schulich School of Business and Osgoode Hall Law School. With the growth of transnational corporations, business schools have had to develop a global approach. By 2006, the Seymour Schulich School of Business had opened training centres in Beijing, Mumbai, Seoul, and a corporate governance centre in Moscow. A number of influential organizations rank universities. Business schools live and die by these rankings and Schulich has performed well\u2014it has been ranked first in Canada for the MBA programs for the sixth straight year by The Economist, and The Wall Street Journal ranks Schulich Number One in Canada and eleventh in the world.\n\nIn the past decade, York has increased its support of research in response to the recommendations of the 2020 Vision report. Already a leader in Knowledge Mobilization, York is home to high-powered research centres that make up the Centre for Research in Earth and Space Science (CRESS). Biochemist and molecular biologist Ronald Pearlman notes that \u201c\u2026the pursuit of funding is highly competitive, but York has done well\u2026 insiders and granting agencies know that York has a strong and well-deserved reputation in science.\u201d\n\nYork\u2019s achievements may also be measured by the success of its fundraising campaigns. The target for the current Power of 50 fundraising campaign is $200 million\u2014an enormous increase over the original York University Founders Fund Campaign, whose goal was $15 million. Over the years, York\u2019s remarkable stature has attracted a large amount of philanthropic support and by 2008, the Power of 50 campaign had already raised more than three quarters of its goal.\n\nMichiel Horn is Professor Emeritus of History, Glendon College of York University. A prolific author and editor, his most recent publications are the award-winning Academic Freedom in Canada: A History (1999), and the English-language translations of a novel by Dutch author Maarten \u2019t Hart, The Sundial (De zonnewijzer) (2004) and a work by sociologist Benjo Maso, Sweat of the Gods: Myths and Legends of Bicycle Racing (Het zweet der goden: legende van de wielersport) (2005).\n\nYork University is the leading interdisciplinary research and teaching university in Canada. York offers a modern, academic experience at the undergraduate and graduate level in Toronto, Canada\u2019s most international city. The third largest university in the country, York is host to a dynamic academic community of 50,000 students and 7,000 faculty and staff, as well as more than 200,000 alumni worldwide. York\u2019s 11 faculties and 26 research centres conduct ambitious, groundbreaking research that is interdisciplinary, cutting across traditional academic boundaries. This distinctive and collaborative approach is preparing students for the future and bringing fresh insights and solutions to real-world challenges. York University is an autonomous, not-for-profit corporation.\n\n-30-\n\nIf you would like further information about York University: The Way Must Be Tried or if you are interested in scheduling an interview with author Michiel Horn, please contact:\n\nDiane Hargrave\n\n416-467-9954, ext. 104\n\ndhprbks@interlog.com\n\n\u201cYORK UNIVERSITY: The Way Must Be Tried\u201d\n\nBy Michiel Horn\n\n315 pages; colour throughout\n\n$49.95 hardcover\n\nPublication date: March 26, 2009\n\nYork University in association with\n\nMcGill-Queen\u2019s University Press\n\nISBN: 978-0-7735-3416-2"}, {"url": "https://www.yorku.ca/yul/gazette/past/archive/072199/issue.htm", "page_content": "\n\n\n\nAstronomically Speaking By Paul Delany The exploration of our Solar System with automated space probes has been occurring for nearby 40 years. Some of the most successful probes have become well known to even the casual space enthusiast: Voyager, Lunar Prospector, Pathfinder, etc. Currently, the Galileo probe is orbiting Jupiter, giving close-up surveillance of that planet and its entourage of moons. The success of this mission led NASA to launch an equally ambitious mission to Saturn: the Cassini space probe and its Titan (large moon of Saturn) entry probe Huygens. The launch of the Cassini probe to Saturn occurred in October 1997. Conversation on the Internet continues at a brisk pace concerning the onboard power source (RTG), some 70 kilograms of plutonium. (Indeed, it is quite interesting to watch this discussion unfold as it is involving far more people than ever before, an indicator of the influence of the Net.) As power relies on the radioactive decay of plutonium to generate heat, which is in turn converted into electricity, this process will operate regardless of the distance the spacecraft finds itself from the Sun. It is thus the only reliable source of power for the Saturn bound space probe. Recall that Saturn orbits the Sun nearly 10 times further than does the Earth. At that distance, solar power will not be able to supply Cassini with sufficient energy to operate the science experiments, radio transmitters, etc. All deep space probes since the mid 1970s (long before the so-called Star Wars era of technology) have used RTGs. As an aside, NASA has used the Internet to great advantage over the last few years, bringing science into the classroom and living rooms around the world. Unlike many organizations, NASA has made a strong and successful effort to integrate the public in their missions. This of course, means that when NASA experiences a loss or mission failure, absolutely everyone knows about it and all the \"dirty laundry\" gets aired in public. On the other extreme, when NASA gets it right, as in the Mars Pathfinder/Sojourner mission, the public relations dividend is enormous. The controversy over Cassini has spawned both informed and uninformed debate. Many Web sites exist that are woefully inaccurate in their reporting of the \"facts\". While I do not for a moment suggest that anyone should confine their investigation of this issue to purely NASA sponsored sites (a good place to start though), check carefully the credentials of any site you choose to read. (This advice applies to all sources of information, including the Net, and not just on the topics of astronomy and NASA.) For example, while plutonium is a poisonous substance, when used to power spacecraft the safeguards put in place over the last 20 or more years have proven more than adequate to protect the public from harm. A great deal of research and engineering has gone into the RTGs to ensure that even in the event of a mishap (a very small possibility indeed), humanity will not be compromised at any level. For example, the plutonium aboard Cassini is encased in a very resilient form of glass ceramic that makes it almost impossible for the plutonium to be released into the atmosphere of Earth in the event that Cassini re-entered during its scheduled August flyby. Why is the space probe flying by Earth at all? The reason is because it lacks the necessary energy (speed) to reach Saturn and by flying by the Earth, the probe will be accelerated to the necessary speed for its trek to Saturn. Indeed, Cassini has already been gravitationally assisted by Venus so this flyby will mark the second such maneuver. Such maneuvers are common place these days with NASA. Since the days of the Apollo moon missions, gravity assists have been used to energize and redirect space vehicles. To indicate how good this technology has become, in 1989, NASA flew the Voyager 2 spacecraft within 5,000 kilometers of the atmosphere of Neptune, a planet that is nearly four billion kilometers from Earth. Further, Voyager took nearly 12 years to reach Neptune so to fly the probe so close to planet given the distance and time it had to travel was truly remarkable. NASA is very good at such maneuvers and there is no reason to believe that they will be any less accurate in the Cassini flyby this August. The current trajectory is spot-on target which means that the probe will fly past the Earth at an altitude of about 300 kilometers. As another aside, it is surprisingly difficult to actually hit our planet. It is much easier (more likely) for any space debris to be flung away from the Earth rather than impact upon our planet. Any exploration is entered into at some risk; the trick is to ensure that the risk is understood, minimal and appropriate to the expected return of information. Cassini fits the bill in my opinion so stand by to be amazed (well, in 2004 anyway). Many of you are aware of an astronomy magazine put out by local astronomy and education writer Terence Dickinson called SkyNews. This is a bi-monthly publication that deals with amateur and professional astronomy with a Canadian focus. Amongst the excellent articles within this magazine is one of the best colour star charts available. (Mel Blake's star chart on this page is a fine map but it is unfortunately in black and white and thus loses some information as a result.) The Observatory receives a bulk order of these magazines and we are able to offer a small number of them to the York community at a substantial discount from the cover price. If you are interested in a copy of this magazine, contact me (pdelaney@yorku.ca or ext. 77763) and we can arrange for you to get a magazine for $2.50. Back issues are also available for $1. Clear skies to you all and remember to drop by the observatory on campus any Wednesday evening this summer after 9:00 pm. Prof. Paul Delany is a senior lecturer in physics and astronomy at York University.\n\n\n\n\n\nYork Spring Convocation '99 By Nishat Karim Although the weather fluctuated all week, the mood of the people didn't. Spirits were high and smiles were in abundance as York celebrated its 1999 spring convocation. More than 5,500 students graduated at York's spring convocation ceremonies, adding to the University's 150,000 strong alumni. The ceremonies began on June 12 and continued through to June 18 on the West Quadrangle Lawn on the Glendon campus and the convocation tent located east of the Centre for Film and Theatre on the York campus. Each year at convocation, friends and family gather together to watch the graduates receive their diplomas. And every year the event begins with the head usher informing guests of the rules and regulations that maintain the orderly fashion of the event. This year, on York's 40th anniversary, Chancellor Avie J. Bennett insisted that things be done differently. Rather than remaining silent until all diplomas had been distributed, he requested that the guests who have helped graduates achieve their goals hoot, holler and applaud as much as they desired during the ceremonies. This request was taken fairly well. In fact, so well that one of the graduates receiving his degree went on stage and shouted \"I did it mom!\" Another graduate gave Chancellor Bennett and President Marsden each a big hug to share his happiness. But that's not all that was unique to this year's ceremonies. The York University Founders' Society is a new honour recognizing those who made major contributions to York during its founding years (1957-1965). Inductions into the Founders' Society will be made on numerous occasions during the 40th anniversary year. Further information is available on the 40th anniversary home page on the York Web site. The next deadline for nominations is Sept. 8, 1999. During the June convocation ceremonies, the following 17 honorees were awarded membership into the York University Founders' Society: Professor Emeritus Albert Tucker first came to York in 1966 as a professor of history and was appointed Chair of the Glendon history department during 1968. In 1970 he became the second principal of Glendon College and was made a University Professor in 1988. Between 1989 and 1991, Prof. Tucker was both a member of the Board of Governors and the Senate Executive Committee. Professor David Bell, one of York's earliest students (beginning his studies at Glendon Campus in 1962-63) graduated with a York First Class Honours Scholarship. Prof. Bell was also the dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies (1981-1987) as well as dean of Environmental Studies (1992-96). Currently he is the director of the York Centre for Applied Sustainability. When Dr. Jules Heller arrived at York in 1968, he served as the founding dean of the Faculty of Fine Arts and headed a small team of teachers, scholars and artists to develop the interdisciplinary curriculum in the Faculty of Fine Arts. He was also largely responsible for seeing through the development of what is now called the Centre for Fine Arts - one of the campus' most interesting buildings. Serving as an early registrar of the University from 1962 to 1966, Mr. Donald Rickerd then became the first master of Winters College during the summer of 1967. He also served as secretary of the Senate (1965- 68). Currently he is an associate of the Centre for Refugee Studies. Professor Michael Creal was appointed a professor of humanities in September of 1965. Later he became the Chair of the Division of Humanities, Atkinson College (1965-69), and master of Vanier College (1975-82). Through his membership on the Faculty of Arts and Senate committees for more than three decades, Prof. Creal has made a significant contribution to the development of the University and its programs. Professor Sydney Eisen played a critical role in the development of the Faculty of Arts, and York as a whole. In 1965, he was appointed a professor of history and humanities and served as the Chair of the history department from 1971-72. Later he was appointed the dean of the Faculty of Arts (1973-78). Prof. Eisen continues to serve York by maintaining an active role in York's Centre for Jewish Studies. In 1993 he was awarded a University Professorship. Renowned and distinguished Canadian historian Professor Emeritus Ramsay Cook joined York's Department of History in 1968. He has been a key member and builder of one of Canada's leading history departments for thirty years. Prof. Cook is both a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and an Officer of the Order of Canada. Professor Willard Piepenberg, appointed in 1964 as Acting Chair of the Department of History and assistant dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science, served as the associate dean of Arts until 1971. During this time, Prof. Piepenberg established the Faculty of Arts internal forms of governance and its relationship with Senate. In 1987, he was appointed a University Professor. It was during 1963 that Professor John T. Saywell was appointed a professor of history and social sciences. Later, for 10 years, during the period when the University saw unprecedented expansion in student enrollment and faculty hiring, Prof. Saywell was the dean of Arts and Science. When Professor John Yolton joined York University in 1964, he served as Chair of the Department of Philosophy and acting dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Later during 1973, Prof. Yolton served as acting president of York University. On July 1, 1968, Professor Gerald A.P. Carrothers was appointed founding dean of the Faculty of Environmental Studies. As the dean he designed and implemented plans for a new and unique FES. He also assembled the initial FES faculty team and guided the development of the new program. Prof. Carrothers was appointed a University Professor in 1992. Professor Alex Murray was cross-appointed in history and social science when he first arrived at York in 1962. In 1969, he was appointed as a founding member of the Faculty of Environmental Studies and served as the coordinator of the Urban Studies Program, Faculty of Arts from 1968-72. During 1965, Professor Emeritus Harold Schiff was appointed a professor of chemistry and Chair of the Department of Natural Science. He later became the associate dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science in 1966 and the founding dean of the new Faculty of Science in 1968. In 1980, Prof. Schiff was honoured as a University Professor. He is also a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. When Professor Denis Smith arrived at York, he was appointed the founding registrar in 1960 and later professor of political science. He also served as a student advisor in 1960-1961 and participated as a member of Senate. Prof. Smith was very committed to York's philosophy and was an early believer in the college system. Professor Del McCormack Smyth has held numerous positions during the early years of York. He was acting dean of Atkinson College during 1963 and at the same time was assistant to the president from 1962-1964. From 1964 to 1969 he was dean of Atkinson College and in 1967, Prof. Smyth became the founding director of the York University Centre for Continuing Education. The Faculty of Administrative Studies, now known as the Schulich School of Business, was founded by Professor James Gillies who was brought to York University in 1965 by York's Founding President Murray G. Ross. Serving as dean of the business school and vice-president of academic affairs until 1972, Prof. Gillies played a significant role in the building of York during its early years and to acknowledge this he was made a University Professor in 1995. As the second female faculty member Professor Emeritus Clara Thomas was appointed a professor of English in 1961 and has remained an active member of the York community. Currently she is the Canadian Studies Research Fellow in the Universities Libraries. Her devotion to her field, to her students and to York were recognized with an Honorary Degree in 1986. Prof. Thomas is also a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. On May 31, 1999, two additional members were inducted into the Founders' Society. Founding staff member, Ms. Vicky Draper, started working at York in 1960. In 1969 she was assistant registrar and was responsible for student programs in Arts for many years. When she retired in 1990, Draper was the executive officer in the Office of the Dean, Faculty of Arts. Professor Emeritus C. David Fowle was a professor of zoology and biology in 1957 and became acting Chair of the Department of Biology in 1962. This well known Canadian naturalist and conservationist was appointed the first master of Vanier College in 1966, and was also elected Chair of the York University Faculty Association. Honorary Doctorates were awarded during the spring convocation to exceptional individuals in fields such as education, broadcasting, literature and business (see Gazette issue June 9, 1999). Other awards presented included the Governor General's Gold and Silver Medals, Murray G. Ross Award and the Parents' Association University-Wide Teaching Awards. The Governor General's Gold Medal is awarded to a student graduating from a program in the Faculty of Graduate Studies who has shown the highest distinction in scholarship at York. The Governor General's Silver Medals are awarded to two graduating students in their final year of an honours program who have shown the highest distinction in scholarship at York. This year the Gold Medal was awarded to Jeremy T. Kerr, PhD in Biology and the two Silver Medals went to Sharyn T. Costin, B.A. Honours, Vanier College and Magdalena Dorywalska, BSc Honours, Faculty of Pure and Applied Science. The Murray G. Ross Award is presented to a graduating student at York for scholarship and outstanding participation in undergraduate student life. The scholarship was awarded to Irvin Abrahim Studin, BBA Honours, Schulich School of Business during this year's spring convocation. York also has four categories of annual university-wide teaching awards for excellence in teaching. The categories are senior full-time faculty, full-time faculty, contract/part-time faculty and teaching assistant. Presented during convocation, these awards are sponsored by the York Parents' Association and the recipients are selected by the Senate Committee on Teaching and Learning. During the spring convocation this year, Professor Malcolm Blincow and Professor Lesley Jane Higgins received the senior full-time faculty award. Professor Judith Rudakoff received the full-time faculty award, and the contract/part-time faculty award was presented to Professor Ibrahim Badr. Teaching assistant awards were given to Caitlin Fisher and Jean Noble.\n\n\n\n\n\nYork's top brass cement ties with Asian governments and universities By Andrew McRae President Marsden with President and Chair Professor of Economics at Lingnan University Dr. Edward K.Y. Chen in Hong Kong. York University has developed a number of initiatives to build and sustain ties with governments and universities in the Far East, in addition to maintaining links with its alumni throughout the region. The York-Meiji University (Japan) Summer Language Program - over 13 years old - has proven a successful venture between the two universities. Meiji also has a Canadian studies program supported in part by the Canadian government. Both Meiji and Keio universities in Japan have signed Exchange Agreements with York that encompass students, faculty and staff. Exchanges are also in place with Kobe and Dokkyo Universities and the International University of Japan. York is anticipating an increased interest in Far Eastern studies. To facilitate this, Founders College is undergoing extensive renovations to accommodate the expanding East Asian Studies Program. Mention the name \"York University\" in the Far East today and you're likely to receive a nod of familiarity and approval. With the global community becoming increasingly smaller as the millennium approaches, amicable and cooperative relations between universities on opposite sides of the globe can be sustained. Bridging the distance is most sincerely accomplished face to face. York President Lorna Marsden and Vice-President (University Advancement) Gary J. Smith visited Japan and Hong Kong this past winter. Professor Bernard Luk, coordinator of the East Asian Studies Program in the Faculty of Arts was also part of the York contingent in Hong Kong. At the kind invitation of the Governments of Japan and Hong Kong, the York delegation met with government officials, visited university and research institutions, and solidified contacts with York alumni there. Vice-President Smith also visited Singapore for three days of meetings with universities and the Singapore branch of York's Alumni Association.\n\nPresident Marsden and Vice-President Smith meet with the Hong Kong Women Professionals and Entrepreneurs Association. In her report of the trip to Japan President Marsden wrote: \"Clearly, there is much to the mutual advantage of our scholars and students by increasing the exchanges between Japan and Canada....In terms of research, there are many common interests in the areas of security studies, languages, politics, research on gender issues, law and business.\" In Tokyo, Canadian Ambassador to Japan, His Excellency Len Edwards, gave an official luncheon where the York delegation, among others, met with Ministry of Foreign Affairs Director General Sadaaki Numata; the delegation met with Minister of State for Economic Planning Taichi Sakaiya at a later dinner. One of the main purposes of the Japan visit was to strengthen the relationship between York and a number of organizations in Japan, particularly Meiji and Keio Universities with which York has exchange agreements. Most Japanese university communities regard Canada's west coast universities such as the University of British Columbia and, increasingly, the University of Victoria, as holding the closest ties with Japanese culture. It comes\n\nas a surprise to many in Japan\n\nto learn that the Japanese-Canadian population and language classes are larger in southern Ontario than in British Columbia. It is therefore fitting that York represent itself among prominent Asian universities. At Keio University, President Marsden discussed York's interest in peace and security studies. She met with Dr. T. Yamamoto at the Japan Centre for International Relations (JCIE), who shares York's concern for human security. York's Centre for International and Security Studies will benefit from relations with the JCIE. Keio is now building a new centre for research on peace and security, and there exists the potential for expanded exchange in this area. Japan is currently overhauling its education system, making education reforms a hot topic for discussion between the York delegation and the Japanese Ministry of Education. Reforms at the university level, as well as the problems faced by a country with a low birth rate and a tuition-based revenue system for higher education, were tabled. Bringing Japanese higher education closer to that of North America and Europe both in terms of recruitment and in openness to women's studies and women's participation are formidable reform challenges. The number of female faculty is very low in Japan. Since 1975, the government has been working to ensure gender equity and promote gender studies. However today, few Japanese universities offer gender studies, and women in senior administrative positions are seldom found. Nor is there a consciousness of the role of women in the economy in university communities. As a result of the trip to Japan, two alumni, Mr. Allan Dwyer and Dr. Toru Yoshikawa, took the leadership role in forming a branch of the York University Alumni Association. The branch is in its infancy as it looks to form an executive and plans its first official event. The current Japanese Diet (legislative assembly) is debating a basic law for reform that will expand opportunities for women. In spite of such measures, change is still uncertain. Eating habits changed from sushi to sweet and sour dumplings as the York delegation left Japan for the city of lights on the southern Chinese mainland. The objectives of the Hong Kong visit were to visit universities and colleges where York has a special relationship, and to meet with York alumni. Moreover, the delegation wanted to see first-hand the new Hong Kong leadership since the handover, and learn more about the new constitutional, economic and political arrangements. President Marsden signed an exchange agreement with Hong Kong University (HKU) through its Vice-Chancellor Professor Y.C. Cheng. The whirlwind tour proceeded to Lingnan College in the New Territories. This small, residential college plays host to two York graduates working as English tutors. A further agreement was signed with that college to expand the tutor program. At the Chinese University of Hong Kong, ideas for enhancing university exchanges were shared. Over 1,350 York graduates work in Hong Kong today, with the majority hailing from the Schulich School of Business. One member of York's Board of Governors, Mr. William Chan, resides in the special administrative region of Hong Kong. The exclusive Bankers Club was the venue for an alumni dinner hosted by York's Alumni Association in Hong Kong. The Canadian Consul-General to Hong Kong, Mr. Colin Russel, and Chan were two of the many who turned out for this special event; such events solidify the bond between members of the York family scattered across the globe. Singapore was an additional three-day port of call for Vice-President Smith. In addition to being a major world trade and financial centre, it serves as an important regional hub for exchanges between Asian universities. Meetings with the York Alumni Association in Singapore were a top priority, as its membership is particularly strong. Currently, over 300 York graduates are registered in the Singapore Branch of the Association, with an estimated 1,000 more unregistered and working in the area off the coast of the Malay Peninsula. Smith also assisted in the organization of the Canadian Education Centre recruiting fair on Jan. 31. The campaign to attract Singapore secondary school graduates to York is now well on its way as a result of this visit. The number of Singapore students studying at York has declined steadily since 1983. In that year, a record 145 students were enrolled at York; in 1991, 110 students; in 1998, only 17 students. The reason for this is two-fold. With the cancellation of York's Winter/Summer session, which ran from January to August, Singapore students opted to enrol at other universities as their secondary school year ends in December. Increased competition from other institutions - particularly in Australia - has also attracted potential Singapore enrollees. Decreasing numbers of Singapore students at York is discouraging. Laying the groundwork for relations with the Singapore Government is therefore crucial. \"In Singapore...the government helps finance a lot of the students who go abroad. It was important that they be made aware of York's existence and our strengths...particularly in the Schulich School of Business, fine arts...and environmental studies,\" Smith said. Building bridges in previously unchartered territory, and reviving old relationships, was York's successful mission to the Far East. These relationships are and will be beneficial to both York and its foreign counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTaylor given distinguished service medal for work in meteorology By Cathy Carlyle York's Peter Taylor, professor of atmospheric science and applied mathematics, was presented with the 1998 Patterson Distinguished Service Medal in June at the Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society Congress in Montreal. The medal, which has been awarded annually since 1954, is considered the pre-eminent service award recognizing someone who has made outstanding contributions to work in the field of meteorology in this country. Taylor is recognized as a careful and innovative modeller of the atmospheric boundary layer. His great contribution to meteorology is evident through his involvement in education; his co-editorship of the international scientific journal, Boundary-Layer Meteorology; and his first-class research work, said Gordon A. McBean, assistant deputy minister of the Atmosphere Environment Service, when he awarded the medal. In particular, he cited \"The Askervein Hill Project\", a study Taylor undertook with an international team of researchers in the mid 1980s on the island of South Uist in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. He and fellow researchers chose Askervein Hill to meet the criteria of strong winds, a hill covered with nothing higher than bushes, and a place that was somewhat accessible to those conducting the research. Fifty towers were raised and fitted with anemometers for wind measurement, 13 of which were instrumented for turbulence measurement in particular. \"The main objective of that study was to increase our detailed understanding of the boundary-layer flow over relatively low hills, especially as it related to wind energy conversion systems,\" said Taylor. \"At that time in Canada there was a lot of interest in wind-generated electricity. It was known to be an ecologically sound way to make electric power and, with increased oil prices, appeared economically viable. Interest in wind power in Canada generally waned after that but expanded considerably in Europe. \"At the present time, though, private suppliers of 'green' power want to know if it is feasible to make large amounts of electricity in Ontario that way, after the changes at Ontario Hydro. The Ontario Government's Bill 35 deregulated electricity generation and sales last October, so that private companies or individuals can purchase power directly from suppliers. Groups such as the Toronto Renewable Energy Group are considering the installation of wind turbines on the Lake Ontario shoreline to supply 'green' power to the grid. Similar plans have been implemented in Alberta and Quebec.\" Taylor said that the results of the project also helped scientists to understand better the stress that wind and turbulence put on hilltop structures such as microwave towers and wind turbines, and to improve their ability to estimate flow and turbulent dispersion of air pollutants in a complex terrain. A project he currently is working on is the study of the effects of blowing snow in the lowest few metres of the atmospheric boundary layer. This layer stretches from earth's surface to between 200 metres and 2 kms, depending on the time of day. \"Strong winds, 25 km per hour and more, can pick up snow and carry it. When it's in the air, the snow sublimates, and this can lead to a significant loss of the mass of snow,\" said Taylor. \"It can have an effect on the heat and water budgets of places such as the Antarctic, Arctic and the Canadian Prairies. Large, crop-producing regions like the prairies often cannot afford to lose significant amounts of ground moisture.\" Weather of all natures interests Taylor. He has carried out research on Atlantic winter storms, installing and operating weather stations near Halifax, Nova Scotia and on Sable Island. \"After the 1982 sinking of the oil rig Ocean Ranger in that general area,\" he said, \"we wanted to look at the way storms developed. We tracked the movements of surface cold and warm fronts and low pressure centres and observed their detailed structure.\" Since 1997 he and his graduate students have been involved in an AES-led project on the \"Effects of Lake Breezes on Weather\" (ELBOW), studying the role that winds from the lakes in the southwestern Ontario peninsula play in triggering convection and influencing air quality. \"In the daytime, lake breezes flow from the lakes inland for 40 kms or more,\" said Taylor. \"This is reversed at night. The peninsula between lakes Erie and Huron is particularly interesting in the way the lakes cause air circulations, making a strong impact on severe weather and air quality. When lake breezes from Erie and Huron converge, they can trigger storms to develop. Also, at lake breeze fronts the increase in the vertical mixing can cause air pollution to be brought down from above the boundary layer to the surface.\" Taylor continues to be active in research and in national and international groups promoting atmospheric science and, at present, he is vice-president of the Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society. He recently returned from delivering a series of lectures at the University of Coimbra in Portugal and from a research visit to the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. In his acceptance speech he noted that, \"Awards of this type come about because someone, in this case Keith Aldridge and Karen Cunningham, takes the trouble to put together a convincing nomination; and because the candidate has, over the years, been fortunate enough to work with many productive students and collaborators.\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Brief Adam receives honorary doctorate Dr. Dyane Adam, until recently principal of York's Glendon College and, as of August1999, Commissioner of Official Languages for Canada, received an honorary doctorate in June at the University of Moncton convocation. She was lauded for her political service to the Francophone minority and for her university career as a professor of psychology and an administrator. Bowman waltzes off with two more music awards It's hard to know what title to give Rob Bowman. Loosely, he's been called \"Rock-and-Roll Professor\", and that name seems to suit the casual yet knowledgeable man who has, again, won awards in the music field. At York University, Bowman is director of the Graduate Program in Music; professor of music; and pioneer of popular music studies. His recent awards were for the Liner Note and Historical Re-issue categories at the Association for Independent Music conference in Atlanta, Georgia in recognition of his work on a three-CD box set by Booker T. & the MG's, entitled \"Time is Tight\". The booklet he wrote for the set runs to 20,000 words. The list of his other awards is legion. Grayson gets research award for studies on York students Paul Grayson, director of the Institute for Social Research since 1991, has won the Canadian Society for the Study of Higher Education (CSSHE) Research Award for his unique chronicling of York University students. The award was presented at the Congress of the Social Sciences and Humanities in June at the University of Sherbrooke, Que. Grayson has done statistical analyses of students in such categories as their demographic composition, how they rate their academic programs and instructors, what relationship there is between their grades and later earnings, their success in finding jobs after graduation, how well arts graduates do in securing jobs, and so on. Some of his other inquiries have focused on the value added by the university experience to students' communication, analytical, personal and arithmetic skills. More recently, Grayson has produced a five-university study on how students finance their education, reputedly the first study of its kind conducted in Canada. Lennox appointed acting dean of graduate studies John Lennox, professor of English, has been appointed acting dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies for one year commencing July 1. Previously he was an associate dean in the faculty from 1996 to 1999. Lennox was the first director of the Robarts Centre for Canadian Studies (1985-88) and director of the Graduate Program in English (1987-1990). Outside the University, he has held a number of executive positions in national and international academic societies, most recently as president of the International Council for Canadian Studies (1995-97). A specialist in the field of Canadian literature, his latest publication is an edition (with Ruth Panofsky) of Selected Letters of Margaret Laurence and Adele Wiseman (University of Toronto Press, 1997). Lennox is also a York alumnus, having graduated with his honours degree in English in 1967. The challenges of graduate studies are ones that he shares with all members of the faculty: working for increased support for students, helping develop new initiatives, maintaining and enhancing the quality of programs through the recruitment of excellent and committed students, and listening to the concerns of students and faculty.\n\n\n\n\n\nMemorial garden dedicated to \"Dr. Janet\" By Nishat Karim Seated in the memorial garden: from right to left, Robert Ross, Dr. Murray Ross, Susan Shone, Beverley Ross and Madeline Ross (daughter of Robert and Beverley) On June 23, 1999 a befitting tribute was made to an honourable woman. At Glendon College, under the \"Breezeway\", which is appropriately named for the soft summer breeze that passes through it, the dedication of a memorial garden was made to a remarkable woman - Dr. Janet Ross. Her husband, Dr. Murray Ross, the founding president of York University, along with family and friends, celebrated the woman who helped sow York University's seeds during its early years. Dr. Janet, as she was known, was a passionate gardener. Following President Lorna Marsden's welcoming address, Dr. Janet's children Susan Shone and Robert Ross each took a few minutes to speak about their beloved mother. The two siblings reflected upon their mother's love for spending at least a few hours each day in her garden - from planting the first seeds to looking after her flowers in full bloom. As they each spoke, guests soon realized that they not only referred to their mother's ability in the garden outside their home and cottage, but also to how she wholeheartedly nurtured and tended to York University from its beginnings. Robert Ross recalled a time when his parents would host afternoon tea and dinner parties in their home for students and faculty so that they could get to know them better, on a personal level. Although their mother was not on the payroll, her children remember that she was as much a link to York as their father was. As witnesses of this throughout their lives they found the dedication of a memorial garden to their mother a most brilliant tribute to her life. \"I think it's an honour for York to recognize her contribution in this way,\" said Susan Shone. Dr. Murray Ross spoke proudly about his wife's other lifelong contributions to society. Dr. Janet was among the first women to graduate from medical school at a time when women were not encouraged to seek out a professional career. Dr. Ross spoke about how his wife also helped set the standards for generations to follow. This remarkable woman graduated in a class where only five of the graduates were women while 45 were men. Dr. Ross noted that Glendon College's residence was named after one of Dr. Janet's colleagues - Dr. Marion Hilliard, another extraordinary woman, and recognizing that it is because of women such as Dr. Janet and Dr. Hilliard that medicine has become a respectable profession for women. Following these commemorative words Dr. Janet's family and friends walked to the memorial garden which is located down a short path, just a few steps from the \"Breezeway\". Dr. Janet Ross, who passed away in March of 1994, will always be remembered by York for her devotion and nurturing of the University community as it continues to grow.\n\n\n\n\n\nYork's vibrant classical spirit greets The Golden Ass:\n\n\"Pinning the Tale\" Symposium brought scholarly lens to a new opera By John Court The most exciting new Canadian opera in several decades burst onto the Toronto scene for six world premiere performances in April. It was met with an unaccustomed cultural focus on mythical figures and ancient lore, and also more academic commentary than usual. Here at York a closely allied symposium of marquee classicists and the Canadian Opera Company's general director was conceived, organized and hosted by faculty members of York's Classical Studies Programs. The novelty surrounding The Golden Ass, composed by Randolph Peters of Winnipeg with libretto by the recently deceased novelist Robertson Davies, owes nothing to nihilism or existentialism and even less to postmodern popular culture on outer space or cyberspace. It is firmly rooted instead in the classical traditions, set in second-century Carthage and derived from a Latin novel of that era by Apuleius, originally entitled Metamorphoses. Born in 114 CE at Madaura (modern Madara in Tunisia), a Roman colony near Carthage, Apuleius spent time in Athens becoming a philosopher, rhetorician, poet and, as he also tells us in his famous Apologia, a disciple of all the nine Muses. The parallels between his enthusiasms and those of Robertson Davies are striking: ancient legends and morality tales of supernatural spirits affecting the lives of mortals, magic spells and conjuring tricks, spiritual mysticism, and the plain, old spinning of rollicking good yarns, preferably not at all devoid of love, lust and even bawdiness. If Apuleius was inclined to parody certain of his contemporaries, that device was also fine with Davies, whose tenure over two decades as master of Massey College and his fictional Cornish trilogy were each interwoven with some ambivalence toward professional academics. Thus he took the artistic liberty of introducing two scholarly characters into the opera who don't appear in Apuleius' original. Davies has given us the Carthaginian scholar in act one of The Golden Ass, drawn unsympathetically as a censorious, blue-nosed busybody, and one of the less jolly members of the robber band in the second act who is soon revealed as a disgraced outcast from the academy at Athens. Richard Bradshaw, general director of the Canadian Opera Company (COC) and musical director of The Golden Ass, mentioned during the York symposium, \"Pinning the Tale: Apuleius' Golden Ass in its Cultural Context,\" held at Founders College on April 24th, that Rob Davies' favourite opera was Mozart's The Magic Flute. It contained most of those same elements and, like The Golden Ass, interwove aspects of the cult of worship for the ancient Egyptian gods, Isis and Osiris. (Lest it threaten to take itself too seriously, however, the new opera owes a debt for comic relief in the second act to Gilbert and Sullivan.) Davies, the wealthy scion of a prominent Ontario newspaper family, believed that today's writers should survive (or not) wholly through economic forces, figuratively spreading their rug in the marketplace to tell stories that are rewarded according to their audience reception by coins dropped in the storyteller's bowl. This free market homily is exactly as portrayed in The Golden Ass through the narrator, Festus the Fabulist, who replaces the first person narrative of Lucius in Apuleius' original text. Bradshaw mentioned as well to the York symposium that this opera had been \"generously received by the critics, with some reservations about the music being rather too accessible,\" as though the opera form should make earnest demands on its audience. Peters was reportedly inspired by the libretto to compose accessibly. This production did benefit nevertheless from the COC's regular surtitles feature that buttresses textual communication, usually to provide a translation. Yet the music does bring layers of imaginative expertise to the production that are revealed subtly, and not at a single sitting. Bradshaw disclosed that Pamphilea's mystic incantation of palindromes, \"sator arepo tenet opera rotas\", was accompanied by an almost undetectable device in the score: a twelve-tone leitmotif from the orchestra that reverses in sync with the palindrome. The York symposium's chief organizer, James Rives, professor of classical studies and humanities, illuminated a number of layers in the original Latin text through his paper, \"Philosophy and Cult in the World of Apuleius\". Rives proposed that what makes The Golden Ass unusual is that in the original Metamorphoses, Apuleius fundamentally depicted the process of conversion to a cult (in this case that of Isis and Osiris) as if it were conversion to philosophy. Cults provided a means whereby mortals could communicate with, and win approval from, the gods. Philosophy, on the other hand, is the source of wisdom, reason, happiness and personal fulfillment, more inner spiritual than, as with cults, ritualistically overt with practices based on tradition. Hence both the book and the opera treat us to a sort of convergence between cult and philosophy. Rives went on to note that Apuleius was interested in Eastern traditions, especially Egyptian. In Book 11 the cult of Isis and Osiris provides the narrator, Lucius, with release from his sufferings as a much-mistreated donkey, and a place in the afterlife. Rives, who arrived from Columbia University this academic year as the newest member of the Classical Studies Program in the Faculty of Arts, was ably supported in organizing the symposium by his co-organizer Prof. Jeremy Trevett, a specialist in fourth century Athens, who joined the Department of History a few years ago from Oxford. They were assisted by a number of York colleagues including Prof. Jonathan Edmondson of the Department of History and Division of Humanities, a specialist in Roman Spain. Joining Rives as speakers were classicists of renown from Oxford, Scripps College, Princeton and UBC, while audience members also came from near and far. Among those speakers were some household names among York humanist scholars and administrators, notably former Royal Society president Sandy McKay (also a pillar at McMaster) and Prof. Michael Herren, a recent Killam and Guggenheim Fellow who inaugurated and has shepherded the Department of Classical Studies at Atkinson since the 1960s. Others of stature who would normally have been present were away on study trips, among whom were Prof. Virginia Hunter (History, Glendon) and the founding patron of classics in the York curriculum, Prof. Hugh Parry. Another colleague from Parry's founding era is the Roman social historian and papyrologist Deborah Hobson who became master of Vanier College and associate dean of the Faculty of Arts, then returned from Dalhousie in 1997 as York's Vice President of Enrolment and Student Services. A high school classics teacher who was present remarked that the new Ontario secondary curriculum will provide for a distinct resurgence of Latin in the schools, over the upper three years to the OAC level. Latin is already taught with great enthusiasm in many secondary schools, culminating each year in the Ontario Classics Conference, a province-wide gathering of some 600 students. As they reach university level, high school students will have solid classical studies programs as a reason to chose York. These programs now comprise 13 full- and 10 part-time faculty members to be found at Atkinson and Glendon colleges, the Faculty of Fine Arts, and the Division of Humanities and departments of History, Philosophy and Languages, Literatures & Linguistics in the Faculty of Arts. Hugh Parry insisted, from the outset, on this broadly-based representational structure of cross appointments rather than cloistering together within a single department. Doug Freake, Chair of the Division of Humanities, observed that the classics are by nature interdisciplinary, so they have always been a strong enrichment to the division's multidisciplinary approach. Students who graduate from this program frequently continue on elsewhere with creditable distinction. Elena Isayev (Classical Studies '93) was recently named a Fellow of the British School in Rome, a very prestigious post-doctoral honour that is usually reserved for the best British graduate students. Honours of that sort achieved by York classics faculty and students come as no surprise to Adrian Shubert, Chair of the Department of History. He noted that there is a symbiotic relationship between historians of all specialties, ancient, medieval and modern. \"Ancient historians have always been here, not because there is no separate department of classics but because they are an integral part of this department - one of its essential elements.\" For further information on any aspect of classical studies at York contact Director Viola Stephens in Room S576 Ross, (416) 736-2100, ext. 22575 or e-mail vsteph@yorku.ca John Court (Glendon '63), an independent historian and archivist, was inducted on March 26th as one of the inaugural members of The York University Founders' Society.\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you ready for the Summer Sports Camp? By Nishat Karim It's that time of the year again...time to meet old friends and make news ones. It's time to swim, play ball and have fun. It's time for Summer Sports Camp at York - and this year it's better than ever before. For the first time, all the camps that have been pre\n\nviously offered through individual departments have all been united under one umbrella. \"Combining the camps is definitely a step in the right direction. It has allowed me to reach a wider market that I was unable to reach before,\" says director of the tennis camp and York University's varsity tennis Head Coach Eric Bojesen. The camps which began on July 5 and continue through to Aug. 13 are divided into one and two week sessions for children between the ages of 6 and 18. Each camp either specializes in a sport such as basketball, soccer, tennis or track and field, or combines certain sports such as in the Summer Fun Days Camp and the Multi Sport Camp. According to Tom Gretes, the sports camp coordinator and assistant coach for the York Yeomen Football, the camps offer young people exciting learning opportunities in a variety of disciplines and teach them the fundamental skills of the various sports. \"Kids get first-hand experience at being in a university and hopefully it will make an impression on them,\" say Gretes. \"They have a chance to walk around campus, get some physical activity, meet new people and have fun. Overall it's a positive experience and a great way to advertise and expose what York has to offer,\" he explains. Instruction from University coaches is available for participants at beginner, intermediate and advanced levels. Children are grouped according to age and ability, with a low one-to-six instructor-to-participant ratio allowing them the opportunity to ask questions and interact with coaches. \"I think it's a great, well-rounded program,\" says Rosie Carusi, referring to the new sports camp. Carusi is the fitness and lifestyle program officer for York University and the Summer Fun Days camp coordinator. \"It's a great opportunity for kids to explore a creative natural setting with some great coaching behind them.\" Carusi speaks from both the coordinator's perspective and a parent's perspective, since her daughter participated in the fun days camp last year. Space has been allotted for 400-500 kids in total with 25 to 100 children per camp and according to Gretes, the spaces for the remaining weeks have been filling up very quickly.

Ross, York University\u2019s first president, sitting at a desk in 1962. The photo originally ran in the Toronto Telegram alongside an article entitled \u201cI\u2019m here\u2026 now where is my university?\u201d Such a predictably corporate image would be at home in any mid-century institutional building. But, in this instance, Ross and his desk are in the middle of a farmer\u2019s field. In the dead of winter.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear in which direction the photographer\u2019s camera is facing, but it is quite possible that what we are seeing in the far distance is the Niagara Escarpment peaking hazily just beyond Ross\u2019 perfectly centred head. Now knowing the kind of austere, monumental architecture that would soon materialize in these fields, it\u2019s almost as if Ross were evoking \u2013 willing even \u2013 a new concrete escarpment to rise out of the surrounding stubble and earth.\n\nIndeed, creating a new university campus from scratch may have been as herculean an effort as the glacial forces that created the Niagara Escarpment itself. Cast in stark concrete and brick, York\u2019s original brutalist architecture is probably as close as humans can come to creating a rough-hewn, rock-solid topography of their own.\n\nAn economically efficient style of city building, brutalism\u2019s obdurate presence at York is not surprising. Rising from the ashes of the Second World War, brutalism\u2019s global footprint owes much to Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier, whose b\u00e9ton brut (raw concrete) buildings, among them the modernist residential complex Unit\u00e9 d\u2019Habitation in Marseille, France, influenced architects around the world in such bombed-out cities as Belgrade, London and Tokyo, making them fashionable in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nNew York City also embraced the new urban renewal aesthetic \u2013 the United Nations building and its brutalist elements being noteworthy examples \u2013 as did Toronto, whose raw concrete City Hall and Nathan Phillips Square are at once a curvaceous and angular iteration of brutalism (though purists will here quibble over what is and isn\u2019t truly brutalism).\n\nRoss Building\n\nYork University signalled its commitment to all things new and innovative by carpeting the fledgling Keele Campus with mid-century modern buildings that furthered brutalism\u2019s hold on Toronto\u2019s urban landscape. Ross was clearly a devotee. The centrepiece of York\u2019s original brutalism is the Ross Building with its multilayered, labyrinthine layout, interior courtyards and even a sunken student lounge area evocative of the swinging \u201960s era.\n\nLike a constellation of concrete, the original campus buildings grew around it in the mid to late 1960s, 14 of which are listed in the City of Toronto\u2019s heritage inventory. They include McLaughlin College, the Curtis Lecture Halls, the Scott Library, Winters College and Vanier College.\n\nBut these brutalist buildings fell out of favour in the 1980s and 1990s when a renewed taste for old-world ornamentation made huge swaths of unadorned concrete appear cold, ugly and uninviting. Unloved, they were allowed to deteriorate until only recently when brutalism, long neglected and underappreciated, suddenly inched back in style. The architecture is now considered an important part of the University\u2019s modern heritage.\n\nArchitecture is beholden to the whims of fashion, and fashion is fickle. Yet it seems that as architecture reaches half a century it suddenly becomes respectable again, often just as it\u2019s at risk of being torn down and replaced.\n\nBrutalism is experiencing its own renaissance right now. There are Tumblr accounts that defiantly celebrate the style and coffee table books that explore the historic and heroic virtue of this kind of architecture. Design shops sell T-shirts, collectable plates and scale models of famous examples of brutalism. Toronto even has its very own \u201cConcrete Toronto Map,\u201d a slick guide to the city\u2019s brutal gems that includes the aforementioned six buildings at the Keele Campus. York is well positioned to be part of brutalism\u2019s celebratory second wave.\n\nLike all period architecture, there are ways to improve it and adapt it to contemporary needs, but the apparent loathing around brutalism is often an unexamined one. Often synonymous with bureaucracy, it\u2019s not a coincidence that the style common among so many public buildings like courthouses, university buildings, libraries and city halls were brutalist designs, as were many corporate headquarters. It projects power and permanence.\n\nBrutalism can be incredibly sculptural, too, as concrete does whatever architects and engineers want it to, including cheating gravity. A case in point is the Scott Library, a concrete modernist glory with an interior zigzag staircase masterminded by University Planners, Architects & Consulting Engineers, the firm formed and commissioned in 1962 to create a master plan for York University.\n\nThis iconic piece of architecture prefigures some of the great concrete zigzag staircases in Toronto by local architectural legends Moriyama and Teshima, who put them in the Scarborough Civic Centre (1973), the Toronto Reference Library (1977) and the North York Central Library (1987). York, however, was the trendsetter.\n\nYork\u2019s other brutal charms tend to be more subtle and tucked away. For instance, the inner courtyards of Vanier and Founders colleges, which provide escape from the hustle of campus with trees and grassy knolls, harken back to the rural landscape Ross first laid eyes on back in 1962.\n\nAs York continues to grow and fill in with new buildings that knit the campus together, remember those original brutal buildings: they rose out of empty fields and are the solid anchors to which the University is moored. \u25a0"}, {"url": "https://yfile.news.yorku.ca/2010/06/16/mature-student-receives-murray-g-ross-award-for-contribution-and-academics/", "page_content": "Edward Fenner remembers well what his mother told him as a boy growing up \u2013 always leave things better than you found them. Fenner took those words to heart. Not long after starting at York as a student in 2004 at the ripe age of 40, he decided to put that advice into practice.\n\nSeeing that there was a real lack of services catering to the older student, Fenner decided to start the York University Mature Students Organization (YUMSO), a club where students could find a quiet place to study, counselling, social activities and a place to connect. But that\u2019s not all. Fenner also revived Existere: Journal of Arts and Literature at York, now a thriving, student-run venture.\n\nRight: Edward Fenner with his wife Linda after receiving the Murray G. Ross Award Monday\n\nIt is for these two things in particular, as well as his academic achievements \u2013 he\u2019s on the Dean\u2019s Honour Roll \u2013 that Fenner was awarded the Murray G. Ross Award, named for York\u2019s founding president, during the Spring Convocation ceremony Monday. Fenner graduated with an Honours BA in professional writing with a minor in science & society studies. \u201cI was thunderstruck, really. I was beside myself. It is an amazing feeling,\u201d he says about receiving the medal.\n\nHis nominator for the award, Brian Poser, associate director of the Atkinson Centre for Mature & Part-time Students (ACMAPS), says when he brought together all of Fenner\u2019s accomplishments, their number surprised even him. In addition to earning several scholarships, Fenner is publisher and former executive editor of Existere, and is a three-time winner of the Kent Haworth Playwriting Contest and two-time winner of the Vanier College Master\u2019s Award for Outstanding Contribution to Student Life. He still found time to volunteer at Vanier College\u2019s annual book sale and have two plays produced with Vanier College Productions.\n\nFor his contributions, he was made a Fellow of Vanier College, an unusual honour for an undergraduate student. Last Thursday, he was also awarded a Vanier Master\u2019s Award for Academic Achievement & Outstanding Contribution to the college.\n\nLeft: The Murray G. Ross medal\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s shown himself to be a tireless worker and he\u2019s a nice emblem for lifelong learning,\u201d says Poser. \u201cHe has a vision and he goes after it.\u201d\n\nWhen Fenner first started at York, he expected to be like any other mature student. He had found that without a degree he was being passed over for promotions at work and wanted to remedy that. \u201cI came back to school with my eyes wide open to get a better position and pay,\u201d he says.\n\nThe first meeting he held for YUMSO in 2004 attracted 28 students. \u201cIt took off from there. When I left in 2008 there were about 600 members. There are about 700 or so now,\u201d says Fenner. \u201cIt really gives students a leg up with things.\u201d\n\nThe mandate of supporting mature students was taken up by ACMAPS when it started in 2007, but YUMSO continues to thrive, often working in concert with ACMAPS. Fenner served with ACMAPS as its first student adviser and prior to that was hired by Student Community & Leadership Development on contract to help organize the first University-wide orientation for mature and part-time students. He is currently a member of ACMAPS\u2019s Advisory Board.\n\nFenner hopes to broaden the reach of mature students through his latest project \u2013 the Canadian Assembly of Mature Student Organizations, which he got off the ground last year and is now developing a Web site for. It will be a place where mature student organizations from universities and colleges across the nation can come together and share their expertise, experiences and challenges. \u201cI\u2019m a self starter,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I saw a need to gather and share information.\u201d\n\nWhen it came to Existere, housed at Vanier College, Fenner realized the journal, which had gone by the wayside, had a lot of potential. It is an up-and-coming journal, publishing work from York students as well as from writers as far away as Asia, Africa and Europe. Montreal-based poet Rebecca Leah P\u00e3pucaru, whose work appeared in the spring/summer 2009 edition of the journal, has had her poem selected to be published in the upcoming 2010 anthology of The Best Canadian Poetry in English, edited by poet Lorna Crozier and published by Tightrope Books. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we broke into that kind of thing. We\u2019re really quite tickled by that,\u201d says Fenner.\n\nLeft: Founding York President Murray G. Ross\n\nExistere is more than a journal; it is an opportunity for students to gain some experiential learning, says Fenner, who is also the publicist for the annual Words Alive Literary Festival. \u201cIt gives them an opportunity that they wouldn\u2019t necessarily get through normal school activities. It\u2019s not a product of their studies, but it is a collaborative effort. It\u2019s important enough that it contributes to Canadian culture.\u201d\n\nHe hopes Existere will one day become one of the leading literary journals in this country, but for now he is pulling back and letting other students take over as he concentrates on his new studies. He will begin a master\u2019s degree in the new Graduate Program in Science & Technology Studies at York in the fall, while working at York International.\n\nSo what did Fenner get out of his involvement? (He stopped counting, he says, after 2,000 volunteer hours.) \u201cI got the satisfaction of creating something that was useful to people. The mature students\u2019 profile has been raised and is being given more attention, and with Existere \u2013 it is spreading York talent and skills beyond our borders.\u201d\n\nAs Poser says, \u201cEdward stands as an excellent model of what tremendous success can be accomplished when someone is fully engaged in curricular and extracurricular life.\u201d A perfect fit for the Murray G. Ross Award.\n\nBy Sandra McLean, YFile writer"}, {"url": "https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/archives/finding-aids/york-university-chronology/1965-2/", "page_content": "Introduction 1955-1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969 1970 1971 and beyond - Bibliography\n\nDate: 1965 January.\n\nEvent: The Board of Governors gives its approval, in principle, to the establishment of the Faculty of Administrative Studies and the Division of Business within the Faculty.

The President is appointed by the Board of Governors, after consultation with the Senate, and holds office during the pleasure of the Board. The President is Vice Chancellor and chief executive officer of the University with responsibility to supervise and direct the implementation of the educational policy and general administration of the University, including the teaching staff, officers, servants and students. The President has power to formulate and implement regulations governing the conduct of students, to recommend to the Board the appointment, promotion and removal of teaching staff, officers and employees of the University, along with power to recommend new faculties, departments, schools, institutes, programmes and projects. The President also has power to strike presidential committees and to recommend courses of action to the Board.\n\nThe establishment of York University in 1959 and the need to begin a teaching programme in 1960 meant that the Board of Governors and the President had to move quickly to establish a faculty, a programme of study and employ the necessary teachers and administrators to give life to the new institution. Murray G. Ross was named President in December of 1959 and was inaugurated in 1960. The University was affiliated with the University of Toronto at the time and Ross was able to assemble a teaching staff for September 1960 when the first seventy-five York students enrolled.\n\nThe records show that Ross was intimately involved in all facets of the University in the early years, from student activities (and discipline! ), through academic and physical plant planning, to graduation ceremonies. In addition, Ross and his successors spent a good deal of time undertaking public-speaking tours, fund-raising and establishing contacts with other universities in Canada and around the world, with associations and all levels of government.\n\nMurray G. Ross served as President of York for a decade (1960-1970), and was succeeded by David Slater. During his short tenure (1971-1973), Slater continued the course set by the Ross years.\n\nIn 1974 Ian H. Macdonald became President of the University, a post he filled for ten years. This period was as significant as the Ross tenure in the presidency. Enrollment increased by fifty per cent while faculty complements remained stable. The introduction of labour unions and collective bargaining was also a feature of the period. The Macdonald era also saw two major reforms of the administrative structure of York, undertaken in a period of fiscal restraint within the Province and the University.\n\nThe first reform took place in 1976 as part of a move to centralize planning at York, a major recommendation of the President' s Commission on Goals and Objectives (1976). Among the reforms was the introduction of the Executive Vice President. The second reform occurred in 1983, its most significant aspect being the introduction of a Provost for students at the University.\n\nYork was also the first Canadian university to appoint an Advisor on the Status of Women as a senior officer reporting to the President, and Macdonald also appointed a Sexual Harrassment Officer. In the field of research, the Centre for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, the LaMarsh Research Programme on Violence and Conflict Resolution, the Centre for Research in Experimental Space Science and several other centres were opened in the Macdonald period.\n\nMacdonald retired in 1984 and was succeeded by Harry Arthurs, a Professor at Osgoode Hall Law School. Although the period of financial restraint continued, the Arthurs presidency was also marked by progress in the University with an ambitious new building program that saw the erection of a Life Science and Environmental Studies Building, the establishment of a physical presence for Calumet College, the building of the new Student Centre, and the completion of the Fine Arts Complex. The student enrollment increase was kept at approximately twenty-five percent in Arthurs' years, while faculty complements remained stable. A new University Academic Plan, focusing on the teaching and research activity of the University, was inaugurated and the Hare Commission examined the role and utility of the non-faculty colleges within the University structure. The University continued its out-reach for students in the expanding adult education and multicultural communities of Toronto.\n\nIn 1992 Harry Arthurs retired. He was succeeded by Susan Mann."}, {"url": "https://www.yorku.ca/health/shpm/", "page_content": "Dear members of the Sipekne'katik First Nation,\n\nThe School of Health Policy & Management, Faculty of Health at York University endorses and echoes the statement released by the Indigenous Council at York University on 16 October 2020 that calls on Prime Minister Trudeau to intervene, recognize the modest traditional fishery affirmed by Canada\u2019s Supreme Court, and to stop the violence of commercial fishermen.\n\nAs a School, we affirm our support for the Mi'kmaq fishermen of Sipekne'katik First Nation who are facing significant levels of racist violence from Nova Scotia commercial fishermen in their attempts to make a living through lobster fishing, a legal right originating in the Peace and Friendship Treaties signed with the British Crown and affirmed in 1999 by the Supreme Court Marshall decision.\n\nTwenty-one years ago, the landmark Marshall decision affirmed that Mi\u2019kmaq People had a right to achieve a \u201cmoderate livelihood\u201d through fishing, to alleviate the impoverishment they have faced since being forced from the fishery by commercial interests for over a century. At that time, after that decision, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans criminalized the attempt of the people of Esgenoopetitj First Nation to sell lobster, forcing them into a narrow licensing system that ignored the rights affirmed in Marshall. For twenty-one years since then, Mi\u2019kmaq First Nations have sought to negotiate for the right to a traditional fishery, practiced on the scale that they can accommodate. Ultimately, they have begun to practice their own modest licensing system, and have provided seven fishers with 40 traps each. The commercial fishermen, who practice large-scale harvesting of lobster, involving hundreds of thousands of traps, have launched a campaign of violence against them, blocking their access to the water, and forcing those out on the water to retreat to shore through forming flotillas of large boats advancing on them and firing flares at them; some have narrowly escaped being set on fire this way. The RCMP have proven ineffective or unwilling to stop the violence, standing by while this horrific violence ensues.\n\nAt stake are the abilities of an Indigenous People to alleviate poverty by fishing in the modest and sustainable manner that they have been doing for thousands of years. Given the disproportionately negative health outcomes faced by Indigenous Peoples across Canada, it is vital that sovereignty over food resources, a right affirmed by Canadian colonial law, be upheld to the fullest extent. The reliance on and access to traditional food sources is supported by the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and is a fundamental criterion for overcoming health and social inequities stemming from historical and ongoing racist colonial policies and actions.\n\nWel\u2019alioq, Meegwetch, Niawan, Nya:weh ko;wa, Thank you\n\nSchool of Health Policy & Management\n\nFaculty of Health\n\nYork University\n\nLand Acknowledgement: We recognize that many Indigenous Nations have longstanding relationships with the territories upon which York University campuses are located that precede the establishment of York University. York University acknowledges its presence on the traditional territory of many Indigenous Nations. The area known as Tkaronto has been care taken by the Anishinabek Nation, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, and the Huron-Wendat. It is now home to many First Nation, Inuit and M\u00e9tis communities. We acknowledge the current treaty holders, the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation. This territory is subject of the Dish with One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant, an agreement to peaceably share and care for the Great Lakes region."}, {"url": "https://edwardfenner.wixsite.com/academic/biography", "page_content": "LONG BIOGRAPHY\n\nEdward Fenner has written, edited, and advised professionally full-time since 1985.

Why? What's the point?\n\nIn this article, I\u2019ll list the main characteristics of research universities, give you some information about what life is like at a few different schools, and help you decide whether a research university is the right choice for you.\n\nWhat Is a Research University?\n\nAs you may have guessed from the name, research universities are universities where the main focus is on the research of professors and graduate students. These universities may be less oriented towards undergraduate teaching, but they can still provide excellent experiences for students who are willing and able to seek out the resources they offer.\n\nHere are some of the main characteristics of research universities:\n\nMore Interaction with Graduate Students\n\nSince all research universities have graduate programs associated with them, you\u2019ll have more opportunities to interact with grad students as an undergraduate. This may give you insight into your future or lead to collaboration on research projects conducted by more advanced students.\n\nState-of-the-Art Research Facilities\n\nThe main mission of a research university is to produce new and exciting research, and to do that it needs to provide the best equipment to its students and professors. This is a big plus for students focused on the hard sciences because large research universities will usually have access to the latest technology.\n\nWide Variety of Majors\n\nResearch universities, due to their size and diversity,offer a wide range of majors to students. Although it\u2019s sometimes more difficult to change your major or create your own major at these universities due to a large bureaucracy, you\u2019ll have lot of choice in the first place.\n\nLarger Class Sizes with Less Individual Attention\n\nFor most research universities, large class sizes, particularly at the introductory level, are common. You may find yourself in lecture halls with more than 100 students, which means less attention and personalized feedback.\n\nHowever, most of these large classes are split off into discussion sections taught by graduate students, so you'll get a chance to interact with other students and TAs. Also, as you take more advanced classes, class sizes will shrink. Many of these universities also offer honors programs to qualified students where the environment is more like that of a small college.\n\nDistinguished Faculty\n\nResearch universities attract well-known faculty because of the resources and opportunities they offer. You'll have the chance to network with very important people in fields that interest you. You may even be able to work side by side with high profile researchers on lab projects and become a coauthor on published research.\n\nInternational Reputation\n\nResearch universities have better reputations on a global scale than smaller teaching colleges. Since big discoveries and scientific breakthroughs often take place at research universities, they get more recognition abroad than other colleges that might have excellent undergraduate programs but less robust research capabilities.\n\nAdvantages for Future Graduate Students\n\nSpending four years as an undergraduate at a research university can give you a leg up in the competition for graduate school admissions. You can get letters of recommendation from top researchers in your field that will encourage other universities to accept you based on reputation.\n\nDon't let anyone get in the way of your dream to wear the fanciest shapeless sack at the next gathering of silly hats.\n\nWhat Is the Student Experience Like?\n\nThe learning environment at a research university will be different from the learning environment at a small college in most cases. Here are a few examples of research universities along with some details on what the student experience is like. All student quotes are from the Fiske Guide to Colleges 2015:\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nLearning at MIT is based on research and hands-on experimentation. Students in electrical engineering and computer science have the option of pursuing a five-year degree, meaning they obtain a masters upon completion of their studies. One student says, \u201cThe average MIT student can be characterized as having a passion and singular drive for what they really want in life.\u201d\n\nThe Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program facilitates student/faculty research projects and allows students to earn course credit and stipends for research. There are nine Nobel laureates on the MIT faculty at present.\n\nMIT is home to many, many different research facilities. Currently under construction is a $350 million facility called MIT.nano, which will provide resources for students to do research in the exciting new field of nanotechnology.\n\nThe Pierce Engineering Laboratory at MIT\n\n\n\nUniversity of Colorado - Boulder\n\nAt UC Boulder, the 45,000 square foot Discovery Learning Center has 12 labs where engineering students can work on different technological challenges with high-tech capabilities and video conferencing. A student says that \u201cprofessors and graduate student instructors alike have taken a keen interest in students\u2019 progress, success, and learning, making themselves available to students as a valuable resource for extra assistance with class concepts and assignments.\u201d\n\nPrograms such as the Special Undergraduate Enrichment Program and Presidents Leadership Class give high-performing students the ability to stand out from the crowd. Students say that \u201cIt\u2019s such a large, broad campus that just about any sort of student can be found\u201d and \u201cevery student, teacher, and department always has something new and exciting going on. It would be very hard to get bored here.\u201d\n\nBeautiful scenery at UC Boulder!\n\n\n\nWashington University in St. Louis\n\nStudents say that Washington University in St. Louis is \u201ca place to grow and learn while having an unbelievably fun time.\u201d Undergraduates enroll in one of five schools: arts and sciences, architecture, art, business, or engineering, and the University also accommodates interdisciplinary majors and double majors.\n\nThe medical school runs a faculty exchange program with the undergraduate biology department, giving biology majors the opportunity to conduct advanced lab research. A program called the University Scholars Program allows students to apply for both undergraduate and graduate admission before entering college.\n\nUnlike some research universities, Washington University in St. Louis gives students the chance to have one on one mentoring relationships with impressive faculty members. According to one student, \u201cone of my classes was a 150-person lecture class, and another was a 12-person seminar...despite these disparate class sizes, I was on a first-name basis with both of the professors.\u201d\n\nA reading room at the Library at Washington University in St. Louis\n\nShould You Consider a Research University?\n\nYou may still be unsure about whether a research university is the right choice for you. If these characteristics apply to you, you should consider research universities as options in your college search:\n\nYou Plan to Go to Grad School\n\nAs mentioned above, many research universities have programs that will put you on track for a strong graduate school application or even provide extended five-year programs that allow you to graduate with a masters. These schools offer a more streamlined path to graduate school considering their reputable faculty and research opportunities.\n\nYou\u2019re Interested in the Sciences\n\nThe advanced facilities and resources at research universities will make the most difference to students who are interested in the sciences. The most cutting-edge scientific discoveries are occurring at these universities, so you'll have many opportunities to meet people who are leaders in their fields (and even collaborate with them on projects).\n\nLibraries at research universities are excellent, but at most colleges you'll be able to get the resources you\u2019re looking for in the humanities. If you\u2019re interested in science, however, other colleges might not give you access to the same high tech equipment available at research universities.\n\nYou Want to Do Research as an Undergraduate\n\nIt should come as no surprise to you that research universities are the best places to do research! This goes hand in hand with a desire to continue your education past an undergraduate degree. If you plan on going on to grad school (particularly in the sciences), you will almost certainly be expected to do research as an undergraduate for your thesis and other projects.\n\nIf you fit these characteristics, a research university may be the right choice for you, but it\u2019s not necessarily the only good choice. There are many small colleges that will afford you similar opportunities on a slightly smaller scale and may give you more one-on-one time with professors and a stronger advising system. Students sometimes have to be very independent at research universities since the focus is not explicitly on undergraduate teaching. However, these schools offer great opportunities to gather hands-on experience in the subject areas that interest you and connect with the brightest minds in any field.\n\nYour brain on research.\n\n\n\nWhat's Next?\n\nStill trying to decide what type of college you want to attend? One factor you might consider besides a school's research capabilities is its status as a public or private institution. Read this article to find out which is a better fit for you.\n\nIf you're thinking of attending a research university, you may be looking at schools that are far from your home town. Learn more about the pros and cons of going to school out of state.\n\nNot sure whether a large university is the right choice for you? Take a look at this article to see whether a big or small college will be a better fit for you."}, {"url": "https://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/professors-guide/2010/04/28/10-reasons-to-go-to-a-research-university", "page_content": "May 1 is a new holiday on the college calendar: National Candidate Reply Date, also referred to by many as Decision Day. That's the day by which more than 2 million students must decide where to go to college and tell the school of their choice. Some students will be choosing between a college that focuses on teaching and a university that emphasizes research. And many will think that a teaching college would always be the obvious best choice. After all, you're going there to learn, so why wouldn't you go to a college that emphasizes teaching? But there are some real advantages to the research university that might be worth your while to consider. Here are 10:\n\n1. Top researchers can also be top teachers. It's often thought that professors who are serious about their research programs couldn't care less about teaching and/or are lousy teachers. Instead, many researchers carry their passion for the field into the classroom and are inspirational teachers and role models. Also, professors who do research generally understand the field better than ones who don't, so they can explain the material better to students\u2014especially when it comes to more advanced courses and topics.\n\n2. Courses at research universities often incorporate the latest research. Faculty who are engaged in research are more in touch with breaking developments in their field. And they're more likely to include this material\u2014including discoveries too recent to make it into the textbook\u2014in their classes. This makes for more exciting and up-to-date courses that are a whole lot more interesting than courses that are a remix of what's already in the book.\n\n3. The faculty can be more energized. Faculty at research universities are often making genuine discoveries and receiving recognition for their work. Large salaries, prizes, publications in distinguished journals or at prestigious presses, participation in international conferences or workshops: all of these mean prestige to the professor and, simply, feeling good about him or herself. These good feelings can carry over to the classroom when the professor feels genuine excitement and meaning in sharing with the students what he or she has discovered.\n\n4. There is the possibility of internships and collaborative research with experts. Studies have shown that some of the best educational experiences for college students take place not in the classroom, but in their interactions with professors outside the classroom, especially in the context of shared research activities. Such collaborative projects provide chances for students to themselves become researchers, and even sometimes coauthors of published papers or copresenters at conferences, either of which is a major feather in anyone's cap.\n\n5. There tend to be more\u2014and more fine-grained\u2014majors. The large size of the research university may have its drawbacks, but one advantage is a larger faculty and a larger range of disciplines taught. This means that students get a lot more choices of majors. For example, at the University of California\u2014Berkeley, you can choose from more than 300 majors and programs. Moreover, within a single field of inquiry, you'll find many fine-tuned variations: in the biological sciences at Berkeley, you can choose Integrative Biology, Biochemistry, Genetics, Immunology, Cell Biology, and Neurobiology. And then there are more obscure majors, too: you'll find Demography, Epidemiology, Media Studies, Folklore, Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual and Transgender Studies, and Native American Studies. At a small college, on the other hand, you might find only 25 to 30 majors to choose from. Choice is good.\n\n6. There are state-of-the-art facilities for research publication. Research universities have to provide top facilities so that their faculty can properly accomplish the research required of them. That means that the university has to invest in larger libraries and other equipment needed for research in various fields. In addition, the research faculty are able to, and at most research universities are expected to, win various kinds of grants from government, business and other agencies to pay for research costs. All this benefits the undergraduates who can then have access to the fancy lasers, rapid prototyping machines, or whatever else the faculty is playing with.\n\n7. You can have contact with graduate students. The fact that research universities devote significant attention to training graduate students is often seen in a very negative light. Some people complain about grad students getting the bulk of faculty attention and, worse, about grad students doing lots of the teaching in undergraduate courses\u2014and being inexperienced, bad teachers to boot. We don't deny that these can be problems. But undergraduate students can benefit from hanging out with grad students. Often grad students are willing to mentor and advise undergraduates about careers, and, yes, graduate school. And their devotion and serious involvement with learning sets a great example for undergrads to follow.\n\n8. You get a chance to take graduate courses\u2014if you're up to it. For a student who is really interested and serious about a field, there is nothing more rewarding than taking a graduate course. These courses are more advanced and specialized than any undergraduate course, and they give you a taste of what it's like to play in the big leagues. And this can be an opportunity for students to make the critical leap from just mastering a field to actually advancing the field through their own discoveries.\n\n9. You could get an advantage for admission to graduate and professional schools. Graduate and professional schools tend to think that students from research universities will be better trained than students coming from smaller colleges, especially when the research universities have faculty members who are well known in the field. Graduate and professional schools put extra faith in letters of recommendation that come from professors whose names they know. It's the top researchers in the field who have the best name recognition.\n\n[Get tips from grad school admissions officials: Business Schools | Law Schools]\n\n10. You can network with distinguished and well-placed people in the field. Researchers generally have great connections and can help their students get networked with key players in the field. These days many researchers will take students with them to conferences and introduce them around. This is a great way to get established in a field and launch yourself in a job or career.\n\nOne final note: We do not mean to suggest here that no faculty teaching at colleges are engaged in research and that every faculty member at a research university is doing research. There are fantastic researchers who work at colleges, and faculty at research universities who view tenure as their license to loaf. Nevertheless, in general, research universities expect faculty to spend a large portion of their time on research, while colleges generally expect less research."}]}
