MacKinnon was of Scots stock: his father had been born in Scotland and his mother was a descendant of settlers who had come to Prince Edward Island in 1803 with the Earl of Selkirk [Douglas*]. Donald attended the Uigg grammar school and, on completing his education there, taught in rural districts, beginning at the age of 14 if not earlier. By 1880 he had enrolled at Prince of Wales College in Charlottetown. After his graduation he received a first-class teaching licence and worked in several locations until 1882 when he began articles with Charlottetown barrister Malcolm McLeod. Taking advantage of changes to legislation which allowed time spent at approved law schools to count as part of the articling period, he attended Dalhousie law school in Halifax from 1885 to 1887 and received an llb. He was called to the Island bar as an attorney in 1887 and as a barrister the following year.\n\nMacKinnon opened a legal practice in Georgetown in 1887 and remained there until 1897, when he moved back to Charlottetown and began a partnership with Alexander Bannerman Warburton. The firm, which had offices in Summerside and Montague Bridge (Montague) as well, was short-lived because Warburton was called to the bench in 1898. Later law partners were Edward Bayfield Williams and Robert Neil McNeill. Named a qc in 1899, MacKinnon became president of the Law Society of Prince Edward Island the following year. He was also law agent for the dominion minister of justice in the province.\n\nMacKinnon\u2019s political career had begun in 1893 when he was elected as a Liberal for 4th Kings in the newly constituted Legislative Assembly [see Neil McLeod*]. Re-elected in 1897, he was named attorney general in the government of Donald Farquharson* in 1899, but when he returned to the electorate that year as a consequence of taking office he was, unusually, opposed and defeated. In 1900 he entered dominion politics and ran in Queens East. Although he received the majority of the votes, the result was declared void for \u201ccorrupt practices\u201d and a new election ordered which took place in March 1901 and which MacKinnon won by a larger majority. He sat until the dissolution but was not a candidate in the 1904 election. In June of that year he had complained to Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier* that his finances were not sufficient for politics and had indicated his desire to be made lieutenant governor of Prince Edward Island. In October 1904 the appointment came to him at the comparatively young age of 41. He held the position until May 1910. MacKinnon was again elected to the dominion parliament in 1921, representing Queens, and he sat until 1925. He did not contest the 1925 election.\n\nIn addition to his legal practice MacKinnon was involved in a number of business ventures, among them the Three Rivers Steamship Company and the Prince Edward Island Electric Company, of which he was president. His interests included the Boy Scouts, an organization he served as provincial commissioner, and writing. He was a contributor to the Prince Edward Island Magazine and in 1906, in partnership with Warburton, he edited Past and present of Prince Edward Island, an encyclopedic volume containing historical essays and biographical sketches. MacKinnon\u2019s contributions included articles on the fisheries, Queens County, geology, and the constitution. The volume continues to be useful for research.

He said: \u201cI was there in 1968 when the students were revolting. The city ground to a halt. The students were on strike and we were running out of food. I just wanted to get home.\u201d\n\nAfter his ordination Father MacKinnon was teaching French and history in junior seminaries.\n\nFollowing this he served as an assistant in Oban for four years.\n\nFather MacKinnon then moved on to full pastoral work in Oban and later served parishes in Kingussie and Campbeltown before going back to Oban.\n\nIn 1997 he went to Arisaig before moving onto Fort William. He now enjoys his retirement in Lochyside. But he still helps out the local parish when needed and writes for Redemptorist Publications.\n\nHe was born in the Highland capital on January 28, 1947. He said: \u201cBabies were born in Inverness at the time. My mother had to go up in the worst winter in living memory to have me. I was the oldest of eight.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about his time in the priesthood he said: \u201cThe vocation grew as you did.\u201d\n\nHis favourite thing about being a priest was \u201cthe kindness in folk and the example of courage that so many people gave me in theirs times of suffering. Looking after the sick was very important to me and also is preaching\u201d.\n\nDuring his retirement Father MacKinnon has helped out at St Mary\u2019s in Arisaig recently. He said: \u201cThe parish has always been very special to me. My great-great-grandparents Catherine MacIsaac and Alexander Gillespie are buried there.\n\n\u201cMy grandmother Flora MacDougall was born in Arisaig and my other grandmother Grace MacKinnon was fostered in the village.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/182541404/donald-alexander-mackinnon", "page_content": "Your suggestions have been submitted and will be reviewed by the memorial manager.\n\nYour edit did not contain any changes from the original.\n\nThank you!

It was at Colonsay, seventy-five years ago, that Professor Donald Mackinnon was born. Sprung of the native stock, and inheriting its best qualities, his first outlook on the world of knowledge in which he was destined to leave his mark was through a rude and unpretentious parish schoolhouse typical of the times, and of which the Professor has given us a vivid account in Gaelic. A rough pile of unhewn stones that were separated from the heavens by a thick layer of thatch, which was not always water-tight, had in its portal for a door and protector from the rain-laden western gale a column of wood wound round with ropes of straw, which served its gallant purpose only as long as hungry cattle ceased to be passers-by. The dank and gloomy interior of a school, whose lattices were as primitive as its doorway, was relieved only by the glowing fire to which each pupil contributed his peat. In the heart of many a Highland lad burned with corresponding glow a zeal for knowledge. To this flame the schoolmaster brought a steady and unstinted supply of fuel from his store of knowledge. The parish schools of the time were, as a rule, in charge of men of culture and educational efficiency who were not unfrequently distinguished products of the Scottish Universities. At the age of eighteen he left his island school, and entered the Church of Scotland Training College. At the Normal College, which was then a popular avenue to the University, he had a distinguished record. His University career was equally brilliant. In 1868 he gained the Macpherson Bursary, and the Hamilton Fellowship in Mental\n\np. 64\n\nPhilosophy in the following year. His excellent mental equipment found early recognition and scope for administration. In the capacity of Clerk to the Church of Scotland's Educational Scheme (1869) and Endowed Schools and Hospitals (1872), he proved to be eminently capable. After the passing of the Education Act, and on the formation of the School Board of Edinburgh, he was appointed its first Clerk and Treasurer. This was an office not only of responsibility, but of considerable difficulty. For in the transition stage of Scottish Education from the control of the Churches to that of popularly elected bodies, there was at times an acrid atmosphere created by the prejudices of opposing ecclesiastical organisations. These were largely clarified by his equable and genial temper, his remarkable tact, and his unobtrusive firmness. During a three-years' teaching engagement in Lochinver, Sutherlandshire, he had made a close study of the dialects and literature of the North. This first-hand acquaintance with northern Highlanders served him well, not merely in the class-room afterwards, but in civil capacity as a member of Lord Napier's Commission, where, by his knowledge of Rob Donn, he proved by literary quotations, that the condition of the Highland crofters during the latter half of the nineteenth century was in many respects inferior to that of his forebears of the eighteenth century. His contribution to the Commission's Report was sufficiently impressive to accelerate the subsequent legislation for the amelioration of the lot of the crofters. While still a student, his qualifications as a Gaelic scholar and enthusiast won for him the pre-eminent distinction of being associated with such distinguished men as Sir Alexander Grant, Sheriff Alexander Nicolson, and later Professor James Macgregor of the New College, Edinburgh, and Professor Blackie, in their effort to found a Celtic Chair in the University of Edinburgh. The full fruition of their labours was the establishing of the Chair\u2014the only Chair of its kind in Scotland-with the substantial endowment\n\np. 65\n\nof \u00a314,000. To this Chair he was called to be its first occupant in 1882. Scotland could boast of a splendid array of Gaelic scholars who brought to the study of this ancient speech the resources of excellent intellectual equipment. Students and patriots have been heavily indebted to them. Among these were Drs. Alexander Stewart, Ewen MacLachlan, Mackintosh Mackay, Thos. MacLauchlan, Clarke of Kilmallie, to mention only a few. As these disappeared, prophets of a new school emerged in the persons of Dr. Alexander Cameron of Brodick, Professor Mackinnon of Edinburgh, and Dr. Alexander MacBain of Inverness. Greatly stimulated by the researches of Continental scholars, these three pioneers applied themselves to a scientific study of the language. As a student of meticulous care in the region of linguistic analysis, Cameron stood on a high platform. He had, however, the defect of a too severe dogmatism which plunged him into many sharp controversies. It is only fair to the memory of this great man to state that most of the positions for which he fought so fiercely have been proved unassailable by the latest Celtic researches. MacBain, who specialised in philology, was, like Cameron, a native of Badenoch. He had all the mental strength and weakness of his countryman. His Dictionary is a splendid tribute to his industry. Professor Mackinnon has a more profound and comprehensive knowledge of Gaelic language, literature, and antiquities than either of his contemporaries. He has better literary and linguistic balance, and accordingly a much saner judgment. He sees a vast difference between the hypothetical and the axiomatic. He moves with deliberate caution\u2014not the caution of ignorance, but of knowledge. He knows too well the ramifications, the intertwining of the roots of a speech that penetrates into the remotest antiquity, to hurry to the limelight with mere show of knowledge. Travelling through the manifold windings of a speech, during its long history of development and deterioration,\n\np. 66\n\nrequires a firmer guide than some of the foreign and home scholars who have impressed their knowledge with much insistence on the unwary and uncritical. From the outset of his career in the Chair, Professor Mackinnon endeavoured to arouse enthusiasm and admiration for Scottish Gaelic and Gaelic literature. His task was a formidable one, as he had many foreign scholars, and some British and Irish, ranged against him. These regarded Scottish Gaelic as the uninteresting debris of a great speech, and concentrated attention on Irish as more worthy of study. Scottish Gaelic, like all branches of the Scottish speech, suffered by the corroding influences of time, when the decay of spoken speech was not arrested by any consistent orthography. This decay was only arrested by the literature that appeared after the middle of the eighteenth century, and notably by the translation of the Scriptures. In the various dialects of Scottish Gaelic, Professor Mackinnon, however, found such unmistakable evidence of its grandeur as to establish it in a place of equal honour with that of the other branches. To this mass of literature he drew the attention of his students, insisting on the need of careful and thorough study in order to appreciate the character and the soul of a people which were faithfully delineated by their chroniclers and poets. On resigning his Chair, he had the satisfaction of knowing that his efforts had created a school whose influence is manifest in a complete reversal of former historical estimates of the Scottish, and particularly the Highland, people. In the classroom he was an ideal professor. To his eminence as a scholar and teacher must be added the invaluable qualities of accessibility, prudence, sympathy, authority, and soundness of judgment. He made frequent use of good humour and pawky common sense, but never of that scorching sarcasm that is so disastrous to study and discipline. The stumbling disciple he gently led, and on stupidity he never brought down an intellectual bludgeon. His energy and enthusiasm were well directed to elicit a\n\np. 67\n\nhearty response from those under his tuition. In a marked degree he was held in respect and affection by the many students who passed from his hands. The attachment between Professor and students, added to the efficiency of the instruction imparted, resulted in a complete revolution, in their relation to Gaelic, of the professions that labour over the Highland area. The ministry, who, above all others, use the vernacular as a means of instruction, have been rescued from the stigma of illiteracy in regard to Gaelic, until they are now to a very large extent, not merely accurate speakers, but in many cases students and advocates of its scientific cultivation. This highly meritorious result is an eloquent and a valuable memorial to his term of office. As a writer, too, he has distinctly left his mark. His versatility can best be gauged by an examination of the periodic and daily press. In the Scotsman files alone can be found such a mass of material of varied interest on linguistic, social, antiquarian, genealogical, and ecclesiastical problems as would, if published, form a large volume of accurate information for students and the general public. His earliest contributions to Gaelic literature appeared in the columns of the Gaidheal, and these can still be studied profitably by students. As a writer of correct and idiomatic Gaelic he has hardly any equals. For his own class in the University he published selections of Gaelic extracts from MSS. and modern Gaelic authors showing the orthography and development of the speech. The Celtic Review is peculiarly indebted to him, for it was he who first suggested the establishing of such a magazine, and when asked to stand sponsor for it he at once and cordially agreed. His connection with the Review makes it impossible to speak at greater length here of his work for it. Everything Professor Mackinnon writes is valuable, and to the Celtic Review he has contributed numerous articles of great value, as well as the Glenmasan MS. and the Thebaid of Statius both annotated, compared with versions elsewhere and translated. Among his numerous contributions to Gaelic Societies, his\n\np. 68\n\nvaluable paper on the Fernaig MS. in the Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Inverness, has placed all students of Gaelic under heavy obligations. He also acted as one of the revisers of the Gaelic Bible, contributing chiefly to the translation of the New Testament. First, however, in order of importance among the literary works, is his recent book The Descriptive Catalogue of Gaelic Manuscripts in the Advocates' Library and elsewhere in Scotland. This is a work of rare illuminating scholarship and accurate research, which is invaluable to Celtic scholars and Scottish historians. No one else could have written this book. It has evoked the envy and admiration of Irish scholars, for notwithstanding the MS. treasures in Ireland and the progress of the Irish School, they have produced nothing comparable with it. But what is in many respects the greatest of his works still lies in MS. It is an amended, enlarged, and exhaustively revised edition of the Highland Society's Dictionary. If this labour of years were to see the light it would probably render further dictionaries of this kind unnecessary. But the publishing undertaking would require the purse of a syndicate. No account of the Professor would be complete which ignored his delightful personal qualities, which did not speak of the charming Highland lady who is his wife. In the bosom of his own hospitable family, during the winter months of the past number of years, he has gathered Edinburgh Celtic enthusiasts at Gaelic Readings, and the outflow of his winsome, generous nature made these meetings a real oasis in the lives of their frequenters. His friend, the late Donald Mackechnie, has told in his own humorous fashion of this ceilidh. May the Professor be long spared to continue his work in and for Gaelic and to encourage others by his example and counsel. Gu mu fad' a thig ceo as a thigh!

The point my hon. friends raised was as to this statement being laid before parliament within the first twenty days of the-session. The hon. gentleman is wrong on that point. What the statute says with reference to the twenty days is :\n\nA statement shall be laid berore both Houses of parliament within the first twenty days of the next session, of the mode in which the said grant shall have been expended, together with all copies of all Orders in Council relating to such grant and expenditure.\n\nThat part of the section refers to what has been expended during the past year, and that is complied with by the presenta^ tion of the departmental report which was within the twenty days I presume.

The statute to which the hon. member for Queen's referred was passed, I believe, in 1886. The statute to which I referred was the firslt Statute. It was passed in 1882, and required that the principle upon which the bounties were to be paid for the ensuing year was to be brought forward by Order in Council, and placed on the table within twenty days after the meeting of parliament. It was not the intention that the detailed statement should be placed before parliament, because that could not come until the number of the fishermen employed and the number of fish caught were known. At the present time we are entitled to call on the Minister of Marine and Fisheries to place on the table a statement of the method by which he intends the bounties of 1904 to be distributed. This is the reason I am bringing up the plea at this time. I am glad that the Finance Minister supports me in the view that the lobster fishermen should receive a portion of the bounty, and, as the Order in Council has not yet been brought down,\n\nI trust that they will be included in the bounty for the present year."}, {"url": "http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/macdonald_donald_alexander_12E.html", "page_content": "MACDONALD (Sandfield), DONALD ALEXANDER, businessman, politician, and office holder; b. 17 Feb. 1817 in St Raphaels, Upper Canada, fourth son of Alexander Macdonald (Sandfield) and Nancy Macdonald; m. first 1843 Margaret Josephine MacDonell (d. 1844); m. secondly Catherine Fraser, daughter of Alexander Fraser*, and they had at least nine children; d. 10 June 1896 in Montreal.\n\nDonald Alexander Macdonald\u2019s father was a Roman Catholic Highland Scot who immigrated to the upper St Lawrence valley in 1786 with the party led by the Reverend Alexander MacDonell* of Scothouse.

To escape death he jumped \u201cinto a canoe and shot the Cedar Rapids, a feat full of peril.\u201d In Montreal he took on an aqueduct for the city\u2019s waterworks and by 1855 he had 500 employees working on it.\n\nIn 1844, at the age of 26, Macdonald had moved with his first wife to Alexandria, a village in the back country of Glengarry County. There he established an estate, Gary Fenn, and erected a grist-mill, sawmill, general store, carding-and fulling-mill, and potashery. Because of these various entrepreneurial ventures, by 1850 he was a gentleman of considerable wealth.\n\nMacdonald was also well connected with the Montreal business establishment and was linked to the political scene through his brother John Sandfield Macdonald*, Glengarry\u2019s prominent member in the Legislative Assembly. Both independent reformers, they shared a strong antagonism toward the copremier, Francis Hincks*. In the early 1850s the government of Hincks and Augustin-Norbert Morin* became involved in several education bills, to which Donald was opposed. A university bill, passed in April 1853, modified the secular University of Toronto [see Robert Baldwin*], created University College as the teaching body, left the university as the examining and degree-granting agency, and made provision for denominational colleges to affiliate as teaching units and to receive possible financial support. Under pressure from Irish and French Catholics, legislation was passed in 1853 to extend provisions for separate schools in Upper Canada. Although D. A. Macdonald was a Scottish Catholic he opposed the promotion of segregated religious school systems. In Glengarry he was not alone in this sentiment \u2013 many Scottish settlers were quite happy to live as they had, without separate schools. However, Bishop Patrick Phelan* of the diocese of Kingston, which included Glengarry, and the Irish-dominated executive of the diocese were aggressive in the fight to further separate schools. Their determination only stiffened the opposition of the Scottish Catholics of Glengarry. As reeve of Kenyon Township, Macdonald, never one to shy away from a contentious issue, took the lead in the battle against Phelan. Under his direction the counties council of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry unanimously passed a resolution in 1853 which condemned the University Act, and Macdonald publicly denounced Phelan and the Irish for attempting to promote sectarian education.\n\nTo undermine the influence of the Macdonald brothers, in 1854 Phelan sent to Alexandria as priest Father \u201cSpanish\u201d John McLachlan, who, although a Scot, had sided with the bishop over the separate school issue. Glengarry then had 61 common schools and no separate ones, and the teacher in Alexandria was a Protestant. On Easter Sunday 1854 McLachlan read from the pulpit an episcopal letter exhorting Catholics to establish their own schools and preached on the subject. An incensed Donald Macdonald left his pew at the end of the service and harangued his village folk from the church doorway on the folly of segregated education. The next Sunday McLachlan preached against the absent \u201cpetty miller\u201d and untalented \u201cdevil\u2019s agent\u201d who had \u201csprung from nothing . . . like mushrooms on a dung hill.\u201d Macdonald responded to this personal assault by charging the priest with defamation of character but he lost his suit.\n\nIn 1856 Macdonald became warden of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry. The following year, when John Sandfield decided to run for the assembly in Cornwall, Donald ran successfully as a Reformer in Glengarry. He secured re-election in 1861 and 1863. In 1859, at the Grit Reform convention in Toronto [see George Brown*], he gave a keynote address condemning a dissolution of the union of Upper and Lower Canada as unacceptable to the eastern, Montreal-centred counties. Five years later he joined his brother in opposing the Quebec resolutions for confederation, believing that dissolution would be ruinous to the interests of the St Lawrence region. After confederation he was elected to the House of Commons in 1867, 1872, and 1874. John Sandfield\u2019s political pact in 1867 with Sir John A. Macdonald, which enabled him to become the first premier of Ontario, had distanced the brothers from each other. Donald preferred to be a leading Grit in Ottawa. Some of his colleagues, however, were suspicious of him because of his brother\u2019s alliance with John A. The death of John Sandfield in 1872 removed this anomaly. In 1873 Donald became postmaster general in the cabinet of Alexander Mackenzie, who thought little of his potential as a minister but who could not ignore him as the senior Liberal in eastern Ontario. Macdonald left the cabinet in 1875 to become the lieutenant governor of Ontario, an appointment caused in part by the need to open a place in the cabinet for Edward Blake*. He remained in that vice-regal post until 1880.\n\nMacdonald\u2019s long concern with the three counties had also been demonstrated over railways. The Alexandria businessman had realized the advantages of building a railway through northern Glengarry and from the 1850s tried to have such a line constructed. He lobbied, unsuccessfully, to have the Grand Trunk serve the area. In 1854, however, Donald and his brothers Ranald Sandfield and John Sandfield received a contract from it to build the section from Farran Point in Stormont to Montreal.\n\nDonald nevertheless remained a bitter critic of Hincks and the Grand Trunk. His own critics suggested that the contract was awarded to him and his brothers to mollify the family\u2019s hostile attitude towards the company but it did not stop Donald from finding fault with the Grand Trunk. In particular he was infuriated that so much of the construction had been given to British contractors. Speaking in April 1855, he emphasized the company\u2019s mismanagement of funds and the poor quality of the railway except for the portion \u201clet to us poor Canadian sub-contractors.\u201d\n\nIn 1871 Alexandria still did not have a railway connection, and so Macdonald determined to build a line himself. He headed a group of 14 investors, 7 from the Glengarry area, who obtained parliamentary authorization to form the Montreal and City of Ottawa Junction Railway. The line would run from near Coteau-Landing on the Grand Trunk through Alexandria to Ottawa. Then, in 1872, Macdonald and a group of 6 investors formed the Coteau and Province Line Railway and Bridge Company to extend this line southward into New York State, providing access to the American markets for Ottawa valley lumber and other products.\n\nThe depression of 1873 temporarily stopped Macdonald\u2019s railway ambitions. In 1879 the two companies amalgamated to form the Canada Atlantic Railway Company. Financial support for this project was provided by the Ottawa lumber baron John Rudolphus Booth*. Macdonald became president, but his association with the new company was short-lived. He resigned from the presidency in 1881 and by 1882 was not even a director.\n\nIn 1882, retired from public office, Macdonald sought election to his old seat but he was defeated. He had had a long career in politics, which, it could be argued, had much to do with his being the brother of John Sandfield. During the general election of 1872 a local analyst, Donald McMillan, provided a more persuasive explanation in a letter to Conservative party manager Alexander Campbell. He argued that the Sandfield family had controlled the area politically for 32 years. A second reason was Donald\u2019s \u201cgreat wealth, having as he said 1600 notes out in [Glengarry County], a lever no doubt used freely this time.\u201d McMillan also considered the possibility of Macdonald\u2019s using jobs on railway construction as a form of patronage at election time. His electoral defeat in 1882 seems to be linked to the still uncompleted railway. The farmers and businessmen of the area had looked forward to its coming. To facilitate construction they had supported the plan of Kenyon and Lochiel townships to provide the railway with a $50,000 grant. Even though the project was not completed, the money was spent, leaving the citizens to pay for the grant through their taxes. There were accusations, before and after the 1879 merger, of dishonesty on the part of the railway companies. The outrage was so intense that in December 1881 Macdonald was shouted down by spectators at a meeting at the Kenyon town hall.\n\nA minor scandal which had occurred during his term as lieutenant governor may also have influenced the electoral returns in 1882. Macdonald had led an official tour from Toronto to Winnipeg and the cost (in excess of $5,500) was much criticized in the provincial legislature. The trip, labelled the \u201cCorkscrew Brigade\u201d because of an expenditure on corkscrews, resulted in a committee of inquiry and Macdonald\u2019s offer to return $350 to cover his personal expenses.\n\nMacdonald never returned to political life after 1882. He retired to his estate in Alexandria to look after his many business interests. He died in Montreal in 1896. Tragically, in a period of 15 months in 1863\u201365, he had lost his wife and four of their children to diphtheria. A surviving daughter, Margaret Josephine, married noted surgeon and mayor of Montreal William Hales Hingston*.\n\nBruce W. Hodgins and Paul W. White"}, {"url": "http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio.php?id_nbr=6001", "page_content": "BURGESS, ALEXANDER MACKINNON, journalist, publisher, and civil servant; b. 21 Oct. 1850 in the valley of the River Spey, Scotland, son of John Burgess and Ann Davidson; m. 7 July 1873 Margaret Beatrice Anderson, and they had four daughters and three sons; d. 25 Feb. 1898 in Ottawa.\n\nAlexander Mackinnon Burgess was educated at local schools in Advie and Aberdeen and at the University of Aberdeen. He worked for the Great North of Scotland Railway as a clerk in 1867\u201369 and then became a journalist. In 1871 he emigrated to Canada, and from 1872 to 1874 was the parliamentary reporter for the Toronto Globe. On 1 July 1874 he became editor of the Ottawa Times, where he supported the Liberal government of Alexander Mackenzie. The following year Burgess obtained the first contract for the official reporting of the House of Commons debates, a contract renewed in 1876 to include the Senate debates. In late December 1875 he purchased the Times, but in the deepening economic depression the paper was soon heavily in debt and by the next summer he was forced to sell.\n\nThe Liberal government appointed him private secretary to David Mills*, minister of the interior, on 1 Dec. 1876. In October 1878 he became a secretary of the first class, on 1 Jan. 1882 chief clerk and secretary of the department, and on 1 July 1883 deputy minister. According to a contemporary, George Maclean Rose, Burgess exhibited \u201cpainstaking zeal in office, and courtesy, fair dealing, and efficient administration as a public servant,\u201d qualities which no doubt contributed to his rapid promotion. His success also owed much to a careful campaign to cultivate and impress his superiors \u2013 particularly Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald, who was minister of the interior in 1878\u201383 \u2013 through both policy recommendations and a willingness to defend vigorously the record of the Conservative government, which had been elected in 1878. Burgess\u2019s rise to deputy minister in 1883 was made possible when in that year the government decided to reorganize the department and create, in effect, four deputy heads: for the Geological Survey (Alfred Richard Cecil Selwyn*), the North-West Mounted Police (Frederick White), the Dominion Lands Survey (Lindsay Alexander Russell), and the remaining functions (Burgess). Within a few months Macdonald resigned the interior portfolio in favour of David Lewis Macpherson, taking with him \u2013 to Indian affairs \u2013 control of the NWMP; the lands survey fell under Burgess\u2019s control when Russell was forced to retire because of ill health.\n\nBurgess had become deputy minister just as the economic boom and the spurt of settlement that accompanied the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway in Manitoba came to a close. Thereafter population growth on the prairies would be slow until the turn of the century. No doubt his administration was quietly efficient \u2013 unquestionably it was Burgess who largely controlled the department under a succession of weak ministers \u2013 but he appears never to have developed much sensitivity for the western Canadian point of view. The grievances of farmers, miners, and M\u00e9tis were all dismissed as the work of agitators and good-for-nothings. His report to his superiors on the causes of the North-West rebellion of 1885 [see Louis Riel*] concluded that \u201cthere is indeed no instance in history where the standard of revolt has been raised, and blood has been shed, so entirely without justification or provocation.\u201d As an administrator he maintained a close paternal supervision of the employees of his department, even on occasion interfering in their private lives. \u201cIt is of course no part of the business of a Deputy to make himself popular,\u201d he wrote in 1885. \u201cOn the contrary his business is to keep his eye on what he considers to be the pole-star of duty, and if he is occasionally misunderstood, and even grossly misrepresented, why that is his misfortune.\u201d It is scarcely surprising that in touring the west in 1890 his minister, Edgar Dewdney*, reported, \u201cMy Deputy Burgess I find most unpopular.\u201d Yet Burgess\u2019s friendship with Macdonald and his efficient control of the department made his position secure.\n\nIn 1892 the Conservative government decided to move the Immigration Branch from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of the Interior, thus uniting in one department the responsibility for attracting and establishing settlers and the administration of prairie lands. The combination seemed, to Burgess, a logical extension of the powers of a department already concerned with land and settlement policy. He also regarded it as an opportunity to economize by eliminating many immigration agents, reducing the collection of immigration statistics, and requiring land agents to double as immigration agents. Burgess believed that only the poor and the discontented were likely to emigrate from Europe to Canada, and he contended that it was desirable to discourage the settlement of ethnic groups in blocks. A brief attempt to expand operations in the United States in 1892\u201393, notably the promotion of emigration and the repatriation of settlers, was drastically curtailed because of government stringency the following year. Despite his influence on immigration policy, Burgess had little real effect on settlement because control of that area came late in his tenure, during a time when severe depression hampered immigration efforts.\n\nThe advent in 1896 of a Liberal government under Wilfrid Laurier*, including a new minister of the interior, Clifford Sifton*, brought Burgess\u2019s influence to an abrupt end. Sifton had not forgotten a slight from Burgess during the deputy minister\u2019s tour of the west in 1884; he also wanted a deputy whose ideas were in accord with his own. On 1 April 1897 Burgess was demoted to commissioner of dominion lands and was succeeded as deputy by James Allan Smart. Less than a year later Burgess died of a stroke while at home recuperating from an apparently unrelated accident.\n\nD. J.

We would like to have some of you make a visit to the island during the summer in order that you may enjoy a healthy dip into the breakers on the north shore. It is a country that will go ahead; the production was better last year than it had ever been, but what is missing is an adequate price for our products. Our position is something like that of the West, where there was a very large yield but not enough realized because the price was wrong and freight- rates were too high. We are in the same fix. It is not the fault of the present government, mind you. It was under the former government that the freight rates were made so high; it was under the former government that the Crowsnest pass agreement was changed and the rates put up. You remember how we were criticized in respect to the Crowsnest pass agreement the year before last; we four members from Prince Edward Island were denounced for voting for the legislation then introduced. But what has\n\nThe Budget-Mr. Mackinnon\n\nhappened? The return to the Canadian Pacific since the restoration of the old agreement has been better than if was during the period when the suspension was continued. It is well that we should have these facts in mind, because we have been accused of losing to the Maritime provinces $17,000,000 by our vote in favour of the restoration of the Crowsnest pass agreement. Men like Mr. Beatty and Mr. Hanna predicted that they would lose millions by the change, but it turned out the very opposite; their judgment did not happen to be right.\n\nI have referred to this matter of freight rates because it affects us a great deal. We pressed very hard to get the freight rates reduced, because our people were carrying their goods with horses owing to the fact that they could not afford to ship by rail. The railway returns in the Maritime provinces have not been good, simply because the people are .too independent to ship by rail when they have to pay such high freight rates. The new board made some reductions very soon after their appointment, and the situation improved accordingly. But we cannot hope to have the country prosper unless our workshops are kept going and unless we have easy and cheap means of conveyance from one place to the other both for goods and for people; I think that goes without saying. These are the greatest drawbacks that affect us down there. Special rates for tourists would be appreciated.\n\nI wish the Minister of Railways (Mr. Graham) were here. I had intended to bring a matter to his attention, but perhaps the Minister of Justice (Mr. Lapointe) will do it for me. We have a good many people leaving our province. It is proposed to spend a considerable sum for immigration. There were two little branch railroads proposed and agreed to both by Liberals and Conservatives in this House as far back as 1911, the New London and Rustico branches. Plans were prepared and sites allotted for buildings and so on, but the work was never gone on with. In New London we have people whose fathers or grandfathers came from Scotland a hundred years ago, and in Rustico we have the descendants of French Acadian settlers. It is two hundred years since the first settler went into the Rustico district. What I ask the Minister of Railways, through the Minister of Justice, is that while he is providing for the settlers in the new districts in the West by twenty-six branch line resolutions he should not forget the descendants of the old settlers in the districts I mention, who have been there for 100 and 200 hundred years. Let him give us these branch lines this coming summer so that\n\nwe may have a celebration and the return of our own people.\n\nYesterday a man well known in public life who came from Prince Edward Island passed away in the person of the late Chief Justice of Canada, Sir Louis Davies. He was highly honoured in the province and in Canada as a whole; his career was long and honourable and an inspiration to the young men of the province. Undoubtedly his field was larger than it would have been had he remained in the province and practised law, but his illustrious career is only one instance. Go to another room in this building and you will find Sir Robert Falconer and the Reverend Doctor Pringle who came from Prince Edward Island, fighting on one side of the church union question, and on the other side the Reverend Doctor Fraser and one or two others. Doctor Pidgeon is a descendant of the Pidgeons of New London, Prince Edward Island. I mention these simply as instances of men now in the struggle who came from the province by the sea. Had they remained down there they probably would have worked at farming or something of that kind, but their education was good and they have gone out to other parts of the continent. You find them from California to Massachusetts and all through our western country-workmen, clergymen, doctors, lawyers and judges. I could give you the names of many who have gone out and have attained eminence in different parts of the world. I will mention just two others, if you will permit me; one is J. Gould Schurman, who grew up on a farm in Prince Edward Island, was president of a university in the United States and to-day is ambassador for the United States in China. Another was Franklin K. Lane, who was a distinguished member of the cabinet of President Wilson during the war.\n\nI do not mention these things in a spirit of boasting; I am simply pointing out that although the place is small it is turning out .men who have proved their worth in other parts.\n\nWe have fewer people there by ten thousand than we had when we entered confederation, but we are not inclined to secession; we believe in standing by the union; we believe in Canada going ahead. But we cannot get population without industries. There is a splendid opening for industry in Prince Edward Island if the capitalists would, instead of concentrating their activities in large centres, establish branch houses in other parts of the Dominion. I admit that the practice of concentrating in the large centres\n\nThe Budget-Mr. McConica\n\nis good from the point of view of foreign trade, but it is ruinous for our local industries. Many of our sons have gone out to the world, so that part of the intellectual force of the island has been spent in other provinces and countries, and although we do not have the benefit of it, I think it is well spent and that we have no reason to regret it.\n\nMr. T. H. MeCONICA (Battleford): Mr. Speaker, I have no disposition to prolong this discussion, but there are a few observations that I should like to make. To my mind this budget and the amendment offered by the hon. member for Kent (Mr. Doucet) raise a very important issue in Canada today, the question whether the future fiscal policy of Canada is to be a tariff for protection or a tariff for revenue. That, it\n\nseems to me, is the issue. That is where we stand to-day as a parliament and as a country. Now, for my part, if that issue is fairly joined, I would take my position in favour of a tariff for revenue. We have had a good deal of talk about free traders, but there is no use discussing this question except as it stands. I do not think any one in this House to-day is in favour of putting this country under free trade at any time in the near future. We believe in a revenue tariff, with such incidental protection as that affords.\n\nNow what is a protective tariff? It is a tax levied for the purpose of protection. It is levied for the purpose of taxing the many to protect the few. It taxes the money out of the pocket of one private individual into the pocket of another private individual, and I do not think that is the proper function of government. I deny that a government has the moral right to say to one man: I will 'help you, and I will do so by hurting your neighbour. That is what protection is when you reduce it to its final essence. Now what excuse is there for this proceeding? What good end is obtained by this discrimination between our citizens, for that is what it is? It is taking from one and giving to another, for what purpose? Why, the hon. gentleman says, we will be able to build up the home market; that is the great desideratum. Well, in the first place, can we do it? In the second place, what does it amount to if we can do it? So long as the price is the same, I cannot see that it makes any difference to the man who sells whether he sells in the home market or abroad. There may be some sentimental reason why he would prefer to sell at home; perhaps he would like to bring in people to associate\n\nwith him and to whom he could sell, but so far as the money that goes into his pocket is concerned, I cannot see that there is any difference between the home market and the foreign market. So far as bringing relief, for instance, to t'he wheat grower of the West is concerned, there is no difference.\n\nTake our wheat. Our price is fixed in Liverpool, and the Canadian consumer pays the Liverpool price, less the cost of sending the wheat to Liverpool. The producer in western Canada realizes exactly the same price in both cases, and it makes no difference to him financially whether the wheat stops in Ontario or goes on across the water. So as far as relief is concerned, the home market is not of any particular consequence. Suppose we bring people in here. Well, the price of our wheat is fixed by the world price, and if we could transport enough people to Canada to eat our wheat, they would not eat any more wheat here than they would if we left them in Europe, would they? Not a bit; perhaps not quite as much, for there I understand the ration is a bowl of soup and a loaf of bread, while over here we have meat and potatoes, vegetables and fruit and everything else, so I think they would eat rather more wheat on the other side of the water. So far as a market is concerned, this home market is a myth.\n\nAnother thing: We are raising about 300,000,000 bushels more wheat than we consume. We raised last year 470,000,000 bushels, and we eat about 50,000,000 bushels or a little less than that. A man eats between five and six bushels of wheat a year, or about\n\n50,000,000 bushels for eight and a half million people. We also sow about 50,000,000 bushels a year, or a little less than that. We have at least 300,000,000 bushels of wheat to ship abroad. Now suppose we tried to consume that wheat at home; 300,000,000 bushels divided by six means 50,000,000 people to bring in here to consume that wheat, and not one of them would be raising wheat. What would they do? That is the question. If we build up this home market they talk about, what are we going to do with these 50,000,000 people? Are they going to manufacture? Where will they sell their stuff? The hon. gentleman says that we should be self-contained; we should live on what we produce. Now we can produce enough to keep ourselves and still have a large surplus. What are we going to do with it? Send it abroad? We are self-contained, we are raising what we need and we should send our stuff abroad; load a shipload of our products, send it to the markets of the world and\n\nThe Budget-Mr. McConica\n\nsell it, and bring back a shipload of money; then load another ship and bring back another shipload of money. But how long could we keep that up? We would not get three cargoes out of this country till they would say: We\n\nwill buy your stuff if you will b.uy ours; our money is all gone. Yes, Mr. Speaker, we must depend for our foreign trade on our ability to buy foreign goods. There is no other way of doing business, and we cannot build up a foreign market unless we buy abroad. Fifty millions of people brought into Canada and engaged in manufacturing or any other vocation you could put them at would not eat a bit more wheat than if they had stayed in Europe. We would not have a market for an additional bushel.\n\nThe hon. gentleman says we are producing too much wheat. Well, they are buying all we send to them; they take all we produce. He also says the price is too low. But the price is not going down; it is as good this year as it was last. That is not saying much for it, but that is the situation. He also offers very good suggestions as to how we can relieve our farmers. They should not produce so much wheat, he says, and they should sell at a better price. But how are you going to get a better price? Then he says we must go into other lines of farming. Now what other line, I would like to know? I am a farmer and I am ready to shift to some other line. I have shifted to other lines, and it does not pay. There is nothing else that can be suggested for a farmer in the West to engage in. Talk about the dairy business-we cannot compete writh eastern Canada in that. Why Our cows are practically all dry fed for ten months in the year. We have a little fresh grass for feeding purposes along about the beginning of June, and then it dries up and our cows are practically fed on hay for the balance of the year; they give scarcely any milk. We cannot manufacture dairy products and compete with the farmers of Ontario and Quebec, even if we were as close to the market as they are. We are told to go into some other line, go in for raising cattle. I have raised cattle; I am raising cattle now. It takes ten acres of our prairie grass to keep a steer. That ten acres will cost $200. At 8 per cent that is $16 a year. You can summer the steer on that ten acres but then you have got to winter him. Sixteen dollars a year for three years. That is $48 and you will do mighty well if you can sell him for $30. That is the cattle business. We are told to go into some other line. I want to say to you that the other lines are worse than wheat, and I have tried\n\na good many of them. We are told that the aggregate reduction in the price of agricultural implements is not going to help us much. The reduction will not help us a whole lot, but it will help some. The hon. gentleman to my right (Sir Henry Drayton) told us that we would only save about $750,000 by this tariff reduction on agricultural implements."}, {"url": "http://www.lgpei.ca/former-governors/donald-alexander-mackinnon", "page_content": "Donald Alexander MacKinnon was the twenty-first Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island since the creation of the Colony in 1763. Donald Alexander MacKinnon was the son of William MacKinnon and Katherine Nicholson, both of Scottish descent. Donald MacKinnon was born in Uigg, Belfast, Prince Edward Island on 21st February 1863. He was educated on the Island at Uigg Grammar School, Prince of Wales College and as well as at Dalhousie University Law School, Halifax (LL.B.). He married Adelaide Beatrice Louise Owen of Georgetown, Prince Edward Island, in 1892. MacKinnon was a member of the Presbyterian church.\n\nHe was Chairman of Georgetown School Trustees. He was admitted to the bar in 1887 and granted Kings Council in 1900. In 1893, he was elected to the Prince Edward Island Legislative Assembly for Murray Harbour District and was reelected in 1897. He was appointed Attorney General of Prince Edward Island in 1899.\n\nDonald MacKinnon was elected by a majority of 7 votes as a Liberal to represent East Queens District in the Parliament of Canada in the general election held on 7th November 1900. The election was declared void on 1st February 1901 and a new election was held on 20th March 1901 when MacKinnon was again returned by a majority of 394. MacKinnon was later elected to the Parliament of Canada as a Liberal to represent Queens District in the general election held on 6th December 1921 and was unsuccessful in the following general election held on 29th October 1925.\n\nDonald MacKinnon was appointed Lieutenant Governor for the Province of Prince Edward Island on 3rd October 1904 and remained in this position until 30th May 1910.\n\nEarlier in his career, he had been a public school teacher. During his terms as a parliamentarian, he took a prominent place in striving to obtain transportation, and other facilities for his native province, including the first railway and traffic bridge to be built across the Hillsborough River about the beginning of the 20th century, and the rail addition from Charlottetown to Murray Harbour, and trying to aid the agriculture and fishing industries.\n\nThe Montreal Star once wrote of him, \"an able lawyer and a wise and prudent administrator.\"\n\nPhotograph courtesy of PEI Public Archives and Records Office, Reference Number 2320/60-22"}, {"url": "https://www.lipad.ca/members/record/a7e51c0d-8966-4959-a4a4-78a3f3a64fa7/1/", "page_content": "Mr. MACKINNON:\n\nThey were made in Ottawa, I think. That is not the sort of thing that Canada wants. In addition to this importing and exporting business, the workmanship is a thing we should1 look after. Everything we make should be as perfect as it can be made. We should have the very best leather, and the boots and shoes we make and everything we send abroad should be of the very best workmanship, for you can send an article with a good name into the markets cf the world, I care not to what part of the\n\nThe Budget-Mr. Mackinnon\n\nworld you send it, and you will get a good price for it and carry on a good trade there.\n\nIf we look at the other nations we have been dealing with, we find that about $664,000,000 of our trade is with the empire, with the different dominions and Great Britain. This is over half our trade with the United States. We carry on trade amounting to about six hundred and sixty-four millions. I think it is a good thing to promote that trade as much as we can; it will develop among us a spirit of co-operation and if we develop each other's trade it mil be a splendid thing for the empire as a whole. France, Belgium and Germany do a trade with us of over\n\n320,000,000. We also find that a large trade 'S developing between Japan and this country. I think we should have sympathy for the Japanese who have experienced such tremendous losses by earthquakes; we should feel glad that they are reanimated and are continuing to do business with this country in such a satisfactory way and with such good results.\n\nI feel very much surprised at the action of the Mother Country in putting into force an embargo upon the export of potatoes from this country to Great Britain. I was going to say that I almost feel ashamed of the Mother Country in view of the reason for this embargo,-the presence of the Colorado beetle. Why, for fifty years the Colorado beetle has been after the potato plant and the remedy used against it is Paris green. I repeat that for fifty years the Colorado beetle has been extending its territory, and yet because of this pest, the Old Country is to-day placing this embargo against potatoes from the United States and Canada. The embargo comes at an inopportune time for us because our people have entered, in a systematic and scientific way, upon the development of the potato trade. During the past year millions of bushels of potatoes of the best quality were shipped from the Maritime provinces to outside markets, such splendid varieties as the Irish Cobbler and the Green Mountain. They were highly apreciated wherever sold and very appreciative notices appeared in the public press in London with respect to them. To show you the excellent quality of our potatoes, demands are made by Virginia upon our province for seed potatoes. The growers there buy about half a million bushels for planting. And here is an extraordinary thing that occurs: I go to Toronto and I find the people there buying the potatoes from Virginia produced from the seed we send down from Prince Edward Inland. It is an illustration of the curious route that trade sometimes follows.\n\nFor the Mother Country to adopt such a strange course with respect to Canada is verv surprising, personally I am at a loss to understand it. The Colorado beetle is not found on the potatoes that go to England. The pest lodges on the plants; it does not stay on the potato itself, and the plants are not shipped to England. If the bug remains on the potato top what happens to the potato? It does not develop at all, and we get no potatoes. Some of the growers in our province have eighteen to twenty acres given up to potatoes; some of them as many as eighty acres. As soon as the bug appears on the plant Paris green is liberally used and the pest is destroyed. Then the plant has a chance to grow and produces a healthy and well developed potato. During the past year I saw many acres of potatoes in Prince Edward Island covered with vigorous and healthy plants without any sign of disease. These potato fields are all carefully inspected by inspectors sent down by the Department of Agriculture. Last year when those inspections were made everything was found to be all right, and shipments made to the Mother Country were consequently free from the Colorado beetle. I have looked into this matter somewhat. I found in the Parliamentary Library a work by an expert in Paris dealing with potato diseases. This work was published in 1923 in French, but I took the liberty of translating it for myself. According to this authority there are 150 species of potato bugs in Europe to-day and not simply one species, the Colorado beetle. When I read that I was more than surprised and felt that the Mother Country was not treating us quite nicely. Great Britain is importing potatoes from other countries in Europe where the potato bug exists, and yet she has blocked our trade in potatoes on the ground of the prevalence of the Colorado beetle. I can see no reasonable excuse for this action on the part of the Mother Country. I do find some excuse for the United States because that country put an embargo on shipment of potatoes from Ireland as far back as 1909. The latter country was shipping potatoes to the United States and competing successfully with the American growers. However, we shall be inspired by this experience to turn to other markets and it may have the result of developing greater initiative amongst us. Never-the less it has been a costly experience during the past year. That is about all I have got to say with respect to the embargo. I speak upon this question with a great deal of feeling because I did not look for this treatment by our own kith and kin, toward those\n\nThe Budget-Mr. Mackinnon\n\nwho have been struggling to make a living after their European experiences.\n\nOne of the other questions which greatly affects our prosperity is that of transportation. I take it as an axiom that neither Canada nor any other country can prosper without cheap transportation. When I came up here in 1922 I did my best with the Minister of Railways to secure better treatment. He referred me to Mr. Hanna who at that time was at the head of the management of the National railways. He took up the matter with other officials but for some months no headway whatsoever was made with the matter. I do not say this for the purpose of censuring Mr. Hanna; he was a great financier and was devoting himself to making the railways pay. Later on, Mr. Dalrymple, who was in charge of freight matters for the Canadian National Railways under Sir Henry Thornton took action in the matter and we had reductions made. Some of you perhaps have heard of the appeal \"Have a heart, Maggie\" addressed to the old lady when she was spilling the beer in the coal scuttle. I think, perhaps, Sir Henry Thornton is of a sympathetic disposition. He has a heart and if he carries that feeling with him it greatly helps in the treatment of difficult questions. I think he has been managing the National railways in a very creditable manner, and that those railways are now going ahead due to the earnest desire of the officials, who are strongly interested in the progress of the country and in seeing the National railways prosper. I am not criticizing those officials in the past who found it impossible to do anything for us. They held office at the time of a great crisis and perhaps it was impossible for them to pursue any other course. At the present time it is very gratifying to note that there is a favourable balance in the operating of the National railways for the past year of over $17,000,000. I hope it will be possible to reduce the transportation rates at a very early date and still manage the railways with success.\n\nIt has been urged that immigrants should be brought into the country, and the argument is that they would help to pay the railway debt of the country and other indebtedness. I count that as nonsense. I think it is a very foolish proposition to advance, and it is a peculiar proposition for any public man to discuss. The point is, can an immigrant live well here, and is the country worth living in and worth fighting for? If a man can come here and earn a livelihood, it is a good country to live in. We think it is as good as any country in the world. A man can get\n\nalong here on his merits. We do not want him to come in and bear the burden. We can shoulder our own burdens if it does take a long time to discharge them. We do not want people to come in for any such purpose; we want them to come in if they feel like coming, if not, we can get along without them. I desire to point out that from what I have observed, there is no doubt that a great many people have been going away from Canada. If we adopt a tariff as high as you like to make it, we would not prevent people leaving the country. But I think this is what persuaded them to leave. After the war, in the United States, there was a great fever for building. Hundreds of millions of dollars were expended throughout the United States in putting up buildings. For this purpose they obtained men from other countries. Men from Ottawa and from different parts of the country went to the States to work on buildings, putting roofs on buildings and so on. Many contractors and carpenters went down there. What took a great number of people from our country for a few years back was the expenditure of a large quantity of money which the government of the United States and the people of the United States had and it was used largely in the work of construction and in work and industries. Hundreds of millions were spent. But we find a change has taken place, and now many of the people are coming back to live in their own country. It strikes me that that is the reason for the great unrest and change which we have experienced. Matters became acute down in the Maritime provinces for this reason; when t'he tariff was imposed on our people and this National Policy was adopted, the people said: \"Let this go through, we will try and get along if it is for the good of Canada.\" Some people say the same thing to-day. They say: \"If you want an increase on this article of five per cent, or thirty per cent, all right; if it is for the good of Canada, we will suffer down here.\" That continued until conditions became acute. That policy centralized the factories and the capital, and then what occurred? If transportation had been cheap between the Maritime provinces and the central places where the factories were located, the trade would have gone on as usual, but when transportation became expensive we had to pay for the transportation of goods from the factories to the provinces, and the transportation of produce to other parts where it might be sold, and the condition in the Maritime provinces was rather acute. But the country is progressing. We have over a million people. We have industries\n\nThe Budget-Mr. Chaplin\n\nin the three provinces that produce $135,000,000 and we are not very badly off. We can carry on more industry and if we were able to ship goods to places throughout the world, the Maritime provinces would be able to carry on as well as any other part of Canada. In agriculture the production of the Maritime provinces realizes about $88,000,000 and the fisheries about $14,000,000. They have a very good field there. I think the fishermen will appreciate the removal of the duty on gasoline engines. This change will help them, and they deserve it, because it will help to build up the fishing industry.\n\nDairying is carried on in those provinces on a splendid scale and I think the cattle produced there are of a very good class. The Minister of Agriculture (Mr. Motherwell) has been taking a great deal of interest in Prince Edward Island, and he has decided to assist the industry of dairying in that province and to establish accredited herds in a restricted area. I am glad he settled that matter. I hope the House will approve of his proposition when the matter comes up, because it is a small province and the number of cattle is not very large. When the cows are tested there it will improve conditions in that area, so that the island will become a most healthful spot. I think it is the greatest blessing the Minister of Agriculture could bestow on that island, because it will do a great deal towards improving the health of the people. Sheep raising also deserves special attention. There are 83 million fewer sheep in the world than before the war, so that this field for development is attractive. The other minister who is going to assist in the improvement of the island is the Minister of Justice.\n\nWe have more to do with the Minister of Public Works with regard to the construction of works down there. We have very few public works to be put through on the island, on account of the economy that is being practised. The Minister of Marine and Fisheries has a great deal to do in looking after the coast. I mention these matters specially on this account, in order to show that they are acting economically. If in any other branch of the public service the ministers were too lavish, the country of necessity would not prosper as it has been doing.\n\nIn closing I may say that I think that the material success of the country is not in such bad shape. We have a good deal of interest in it, and we would all like to see every man and woman in Canada in a prosperous state, no matter on which side of politics they might be. If every one would lead a comfortable life we would all be happy, and it is our duty\n\nto do all we can to that end. We would like to progress, not only in our material interests, but in other respects. Hon. members must observe that in Canada we produce men of intellect, and their powers are not confined to our country alone. They are exercising an influence throughout the whole world in this way: that with the changes which are brought about we are going to see more daylight in the future, and what we -have to do is just to clear the way.\n\nThere's a fount about to stream,\n\nThere's a light about to beam,\n\nThere's a warmth about to glow,\n\nThere's a flower about to blow;\n\nThere's a midnight blackness changing into gray;\n\nMen of thought and men of action, clear the way I"}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8102557/alexander-mackinnon", "page_content": "FRAMES FOR THE FUTURE Iron River centennial book 1981 pages 34-37 \"The First Family\"\n\nHe was sometimes called the \"Grand Old Man of Iron River.\" His name was Donald C.
