{"John Russell Reynolds wrote several books on legal topics, including The Law of Libel and Slander (1863), The Law of Copyright (1865), and The Law of Patents for Inventions (1868).": [{"url": "https://acnr.co.uk/articles/john-russell-reynolds/", "page_content": "Abstract\n\nWhen neurology began to develop as a specialty, Russell Reynolds was one of the first neurologists appointed to the Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic, Queen Square.\n\nOf many contributions his work on epilepsy was influential, espousing many new concepts. He followed and developed Hughlings Jackson\u2019s original ideas about positive and negative neurological symptoms. His approach to patients was holistic at a time when more objectively defined notions of illness dominated medicine. He wrote on vertigo, and about criminal lunacy, and his book The Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, Nerves and their appendages was a major text of the period.\n\nWell versed in poetry, philosophy, art, and music, he was widely admired. He became President of the Royal College of Physicians.\n\nLike the great Sir Jonathan Hutchinson and other Victorians of privileged stock, Sir John Russell Reynolds (1828\u20131896) (Figure 1) never attended school. His father, a nonconformist minister at Romsey in Hampshire, educated him personally. His grandfather Henry Revell Reynolds (1745-1811), FRS, was an illustrious physician at the Middlesex and St Thomas\u2019s Hospitals and Physician to George III.\n\nFigure 1: Sir J Russell Reynolds. [Published in British Medical Journal, 6 June 1896)\n\nAs a nonconformist he was excluded from Oxford and Cambridge* and read Medicine at University College London, graduating with a gold medal in physiology, comparative anatomy, and medicine in 1851 [1]. An impecunious young doctor, he sought a living, practicing in Leeds where his brother was a Minister of the East Parade Mission Chapel, and his brother-in-law a journalist on the Leeds Mercury.\n\nA year later his former teacher Marshall Hall, FRS. (1790-1857), a physician and brilliant experimental physiologist persuaded him to return to London [2], where at modest cost Hall let him live in his home at 38, Grosvenor Street and join his Consultant practice, mainly in nervous diseases.\n\nOnly four years after graduating Russell Reynolds\u2019 outstanding ability led to his appointment as assistant physician at the Hospital for Sick Children and to the Westminster and University College Hospitals. There he became Holme Professor of Clinical Medicine in 1862, and in 1867 succeeding Sir William Jenner as Professor of Medicine. Just five years after the opening of the National Hospital for the Relief and Cure of Paralysis and Epilepsy, Russell Reynolds showed his interest in neurology and was appointed to its staff. He was elected FRS on 3rd June 1869.\n\nAt this time neurology began to flourish; he worked with many distinguished early neurologists. They included Hughlings Jackson (1835-1911), Jabez Ramskill (1825-1897), Charles Bland Radcliffe (1822\u20131889) who succeeded Brown\u2013S\u00e9quard in 1863, and published Lectures on Epilepsy, Pain, Paralysis, and certain other disorders of the Nervous System, 1864, and articles in Reynolds\u2019s System of Medicine. His brother John Netten Radcliffe (c. 1830-1884), a pioneering epidemiologist, was also Medical Superintendent of the Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic.\n\nNo man works in a vacuum. Marshall Hall, (who in spite of his acknowledged distinction [3] surprisingly had failed to get an academic post in London) inspired and encouraged Reynolds. Amongst contemporary and subsequent notable physicians he influenced were: the erudite Charlton Bastian (1837-1915); Charles Edward Beevor, (1854-1908); Howard Tooth (1856-1925); James Taylor, (1859-1946) editor of Jackson\u2019s Selected Writings; and the punctilious Thomas Buzzard (1831-1919), his neighbour in Grosvenor Street, and friend of both Hughlings Jackson and David Ferrier (1843-1928).\n\nSuch was Reynolds\u2019s reputation that he was rewarded with both the Lumleian and the Harveian lectures at the Royal College of Physicians of London, becoming President from 1893\u20131895. Like his grandfather, he was physician to the royal household in 1879 and was made a baronet in 1895. He was president of the BMA until his death.\n\nA popular and fluent lecturer, he was shy and serious but had a quiet humour and a \u2018directness of speech that was no respecter of persons.\u2019 Described as courteous, shrewd, and kind, his approach was holistic \u2013 long before it became fashionable:\n\nNot to merely make a diagnosis, much less to write a prescription, but to advise the individual patient what he or she should best do to regain their health\u2026 and what changes in the environment, mental, emotional, or physical were most likely to achieve this end. [2]\n\nMedical works\n\nRussell Reynolds is often remembered for his descriptions of epilepsy, eclamptic convulsions, and febrile convulsions in children [4,5]. He also used electrotherapy in various nervous diseases [6].\n\nInterestingly, he is widely quoted for commending the \u201cgreat value of Cannabis indica\u201d in migraine, epileptic conditions, depression, and asthma. In 1890 he prescribed a cannabis tincture for the menstrual cramps suffered by Queen Victoria. He noted in The Lancet:\n\nWhen pure and administered carefully, [cannabis] is one of the most valuable medicines we possess. [7]\n\nOf greater import was his 1861 paper (Figure 2) that espoused the concept of positive and negative neurological symptoms [5,8]. Positive symptoms were abnormal behaviours that included not only clonic jerking and abnormal movements but also hallucinations and paranoid delusions.\n\nSome symptoms are negative, i.e. they consist in the negation of vital properties. Of this kind are paralysis, anaesthesia, and the like\u2026Other symptoms are positive, i.e. they consist in excess or alteration of vital properties. Of this kind are spasms, pain, convulsions and the like\u2026 (p.9-12, 28)\n\nUnfortunately, he failed to write further on this theme. Like Jackson, Russell Reynolds shrewdly noted that the lesion did not directly cause the symptoms observed.\n\nThe origins of positive and negative symptoms were inextricably intertwined with Herbert Spencer\u2019s ideas of dissolution and evolution of the nervous system [9]. Hughlings Jackson extended Spencer\u2019s idea to patients\u2019 symptoms, both positive and negative. Jackson believed that negative symptoms related to the dissolution of neural function while positive symptoms resulted from excitation or the release of lower levels from higher inhibitory control:\n\nSpeaking of the physical side, there are degrees of loss of function of the least organized nervous arrangements with conservation of function of the more organized. There is in each reduction to a more automatic condition; in each there is dissolution, using this term as Spencer does, as the opposite of evolution. [10]\n\nFigure 2. Reynolds: Epilepsy, its symptoms, treatment and relation to other chronic convulsive diseases. 1861\n\nRussell Reynolds wrote his first book on Vertigo. In 1856 he examined legal pleas for insanity in his Criminal Lunatics: are they Responsible? He believed that epilepsy could be a distinct or \u2018idiopathic\u2019 disease, a controversial view well expressed in The Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, Nerves and their appendages in 1855 (dedicated to Marshall Hall), This was later contradicted by Kinnier Wilson who stated that all epileptic events were symptoms, whether or not any underlying pathology could be demonstrated [11].\n\nAlways inclined to a broad approach he described the interictal symptoms of 62 patients with idiopathic epilepsy. He found about one-third had mild impairment of recent memory and a similar proportion had moderate to severe psychopathological findings. His interpretation of epileptic activity (well described by Eadie) [12] was in large measure approved by Hughlings Jackson.\n\nHe edited and wrote many chapters in A system of medicine (London: Macmillan, in five volumes from 1866 to 1879), a major text rivalled only by John Cooke\u2019s Treatise in Nervous Diseases, published in two volumes, in 1820 and 1823, the second volume of Bright\u2019s Reports of Medical Cases 1831, and Romberg\u2019s Manual of the Nervous Diseases of Man 1840 [13].\n\nRussell Reynolds practiced at a time when neurology was in its infancy. It relied on clinical description and elementary pathology. In this morass of evolving knowledge, Reynolds formulated a classification of neurological diseases that remains the kernel of modern systems. His work in neurology linked the highly original physiological and clinical works of his mentor, Marshall Hall, to Hughlings Jackson\u2019s intellectual explorations of the brain\u2019s complex functions and hierarchies, and to the more systematic descriptive neurology of William Gowers [12]. His students included Charlton Bastian (1837-1915) and Sir William Gowers (1845-1915), whose writings often reflect his influence.\n\nLegacy\n\nHe was well versed in poetry, philosophy, art, and music. He was married, first, to Margaret Ainslie, and, secondly, to Frances Crespigny, but left no children. He died aged 68 of \u2018pulmonary congestion\u2019 at his home in 1896.\n\nThe scholarship and clinical advances made by Reynolds can be seen as important influences on contemporary and also later notable neurologists at the National Hospital. He bridged the eras of Victorian Neurology with that of the dawning 20th century.\n\nHe was noted as:\n\nA man of scholarship and wisdom, in his presidential address in 1894, in a spirit of prophecy he warned the subject-ridden student of to day of the danger of becoming entangled in the net of an ill-considered and misunderstood technical phraseology, and of juggling with words when he ought to be dealing with concrete things. [2]\n\nAnd Eadie characterised him as:\n\nA most eminent, scholarly, and influential physician who was greatly respected and admired by his contemporaries\u2026the sort of man whose ideas would not readily be discarded because it might almost seem disrespectful to do so unless a better alternative could be clearly demonstrated to exist. [12]\n\n* So-called dissenters (Catholics, Jews, and Quakers) were denied admission because their religious beliefs prevented their taking an oath to adhere to the 39 articles of the Anglican Church. This was abolished by the Universities Tests Act in 1871.\n\nWomen had studied at Oxford since the 1870s. But until 1921, they were not entitled to claim the degrees they had earned. Cambridge followed in 1947.\n\nReferences\n\nBrown GH. Munk\u2019s Roll. Lives of the Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians of London (1826-1925).

Every page goes through several hundred of perfecting techniques; in live mode. Quite the same Wikipedia. Just better.\n\nBritish neurologist and physician\n\nSir John Russell Reynolds, 1st Baronet (22 May 1828 \u2013 29 May 1896) was a British neurologist and physician.\n\nReynolds was born in Romsey, Hampshire, as son of John Reynolds, an independent minister, and grandson of Dr. Henry Revell Reynolds. He received general education from his father, and was educated in his profession at University College, London, where he obtained three gold medals in the medical school. In 1851 he graduated M.B. in the university of London, and obtained a scholarship and gold medal in medicine. In 1852 he took the degree of M.D., and began practice in Leeds. He soon after moved to London, and took a house, 38 Grosvenor Street, in which Dr. Marshall Hall had lived. Hall announced to his patients in a printed circular that Reynolds had succeeded him in practice. Such procedure was contrary to a recognised understanding among physicians, and Hall incurred the censure of the College of Physicians. Reynolds, who was ignorant of Hall's intention, was in no way responsible for the circular, and was in no way involved in the censure. He was duly elected a fellow of the college in 1859. In the same year he was appointed assistant physician to University College Hospital, to which he continued attached throughout life. He had before been, in 1855, assistant physician to the Hospital for Sick Children, and in 1857 assistant physician to the Westminster Hospital. In 1865 he became professor of the principles and practice of medicine at University College, and in 1878 he was appointed physician-in-ordinary to the queen's household. He gained a considerable practice as a physician, and was often consulted in difficult cases of nervous disease. In 1869 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1883 vice-president of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. He delivered the Lumleian lecture at the College of Physicians in 1867, the Harveian oration in 1884, and was elected president in 1893, on the death of Sir Andrew Clark. He was re-elected in 1894 and 1895, and on 1 January in the latter year was created a baronet. In the winter of 1895\u20136 he became too ill to offer himself for re-election as president of the College of Physicians. He died at his house in Grosvenor Street, London, after several weeks of illness of a pulmonary congestion, on 29 May 1896. He was married, first, at St Pancras Old Church, London, on 28 August 1852 to Margaretta Susannah Ainslie (1831-1880) and, secondly, to Frances (Plunkett) Reynolds widow of C. J. C. Crespign, but left no children.\n\nThe Reynolds Baronetcy, of Grosvenor Street, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 28 February 1895 for John Russell Reynolds.[1] The title became extinct on his death.\n\nReynolds devoted himself from an early period to the study of nervous diseases, and in 1854 published an Essay on Vertigo; in 1855 Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, and Nerves, as well as Tables for the Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain; in 1861 a treatise on epilepsy; in 1871 Lectures on the Clinical Uses of Electricity; in 1872 The Scientific Value of the Legal Tests of Insanity; besides many papers in medical periodicals and the transactions of medical societies, and several addresses to medical associations. His writings on nervous diseases were useful contributions to a department of medicine in which much work remained undone, but in the flood of modern observations they have been submerged. He will chiefly be remembered among physicians as the editor of the System of Medicine, in five volumes, published from 1866 to 1879, a collection of essays on diseases, written by the most competent men who could be induced to write\u2014compositions of varying merit, but generally of high value. He himself wrote the parts on erysipelas, on inflammation of the lymphatics, and on several forms of nervous disease. He published in 1893 a Life of Dr. Walter Hayle Walshe. Reynolds was a tall man, with dark hair, with a dignified delivery and some oratorical power.\n\nReynolds died in London.\n\nReferences"}, {"url": "https://www.npr.org/2021/09/30/1041610286/during-banned-books-week-readers-explore-what-it-means-to-challenge-texts", "page_content": "During Banned Books Week, Readers Explore What It Means To Challenge Texts\n\nEnlarge this image Emily Bogle/NPR Emily Bogle/NPR\n\nThe Catcher in the Rye. A Brave New World. Lolita. Lady Chatterley's Lover.\n\nThese are some classics that pop into many minds when considering books that have been banned from home and school libraries over time.\n\nBut there's been a \"notable shift\" in the subject matter of books now being challenged in the U.S. When the American Library Association released its list of the Top Ten Most Challenged Books of 2020 in April, the books that received the most challenges to libraries and schools dealt with \"racism, Black American history and diversity in the United States,\" says Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the ALA's Office for Intellectual Freedom.\n\nAnd Caldwell-Stone says in 2018 and 2019, the Banned Books list was made up \"almost exclusively\" of books dealing with LGBTQ concerns.\n\n\"I think that we're seeing a response in many ways to some of the conversations, the challenges that we faced as a society since the murder of George Floyd last year,\" she says.\n\nThe theme of this year's Banned Books Week is \"Books Unite Us. Censorship Divides Us.\" Public events include a Dear Banned Author Letter-Writing Campaign and Stand For The Banned Read-out, an opportunity for people to submit videos of themselves reading books from the list.\n\nTop Ten Most Challenged Books of 2020\n\nGeorge by Alex Gino Reasons: Challenged, banned, and restricted for LGBTQIA+ content, conflicting with a religious viewpoint, and not reflecting \"the values of our community\"\n\nStamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You by Ibram X. Kendi and Jason Reynolds Reasons: Banned and challenged because of author's public statements, and because of claims that the book contains \"selective storytelling incidents\" and does not encompass racism against all people\n\nAll American Boys by Jason Reynolds and Brendan Kiely Reasons: Banned and challenged for profanity, drug use, and alcoholism, and because it was thought to promote anti-police views, contain divisive topics, and be \"too much of a sensitive matter right now\"\n\nSpeak by Laurie Halse Anderson Reasons: Banned, challenged, and restricted because it was thought to contain a political viewpoint and it was claimed to be biased against male students, and for the novel's inclusion of rape and profanity\n\nThe Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian by Sherman Alexie Reasons: Banned and challenged for profanity, sexual references, and allegations of sexual misconduct by the author\n\nSomething Happened in Our Town: A Child's Story About Racial Injustice by Marianne Celano, Marietta Collins, and Ann Hazzard, illustrated by Jennifer Zivoin Reasons: Challenged for \"divisive language\" and because it was thought to promote anti-police views\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee Reasons: Banned and challenged for racial slurs and their negative effect on students, featuring a \"white savior\" character, and its perception of the Black experience\n\nOf Mice and Men by John Steinbeck Reasons: Banned and challenged for racial slurs and racist stereotypes, and their negative effect on students\n\nThe Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison Reasons: Banned and challenged because it was considered sexually explicit and depicts child sexual abuse\n\nThe Hate U Give by Angie Thomas Reasons: Challenged for profanity, and it was thought to promote an anti-police message\n\nAuthor Angie Thomas' The Hate U Give has made the banned books list before. Since making the list often boosts sales, Thomas tweeted her gratitude: \"Happy #BannedBooksWeek! I remember the time a Texas school district banned The Hate U Give, and I sold tens of thousands of copies in a week in that same district. Keeping banning my books. I have a second home to buy.\"\n\nBestselling author Jason Reynolds, the \"Banned Books Week 2021 Honorary Chair,\" has two books on the most recent list: Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You, co-written with Ibram X. Kendi and All American Boys with Brendan Kiely.\n\nIn a Facebook Live conversation on Tuesday, Reynolds disagreed with the mantra that making the list is a \"badge of honor\" or like belonging to \"a special club\" for authors. \"I don't feel that way. I actually think it's a bigger slap in the face,\" said Reynolds, \"It's painful to me because what I know is that when these books are banned, there are going to be thousands and thousands of young people who will not get these books.\"\n\nStill, nothing says \"read me\" like the words \"banned\" or \"censored.\"\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the Central York School Board recently tried to halt the use of a \"Diversity Committee Resource List\" that included books by Nikole Hannah-Jones and Malala Yousafzai. A robust student protest ensued and the decision was reversed. There have been similar outcries in Texas where the Leander Independent School District pulled six books including The Handmaid's Tale: The Graphic Novel by Margaret Atwood and Renee Nault.\n\nIn Tennessee, a local chapter of Moms For Liberty (MFL) deemed a number of books as inappropriate for second graders, including Martin Luther King, Jr and the March on Washington and the picture book Ruby Bridges Goes to School, about the six year old who became the first African American to integrate an all-white school in New Orleans.\n\nIn a letter to the Tennessee Department of Education, the Williamson MFL chair Robin Steenman writes: \"The classroom books and teacher manuals reveal both explicit and implicit Anti-American, Anti-White, and Anti-Mexican teaching. Additionally, it implies to second grade children that people of color continue to be oppressed...and teaches that the racial injustice of the 1960s exists today.\"\n\nBut Steenman claims they are not seeking to ban books. She says MFL has heard complaints from parents in the community, including people of color, about the manner in which certain books are being taught to second graders. \"How it's presented to the children really does alienate some,\" she says, and \"divides children up\" based on their skin color. \"It's very focused on racial injustice,\" she says, \"instead of talking about the strides that our country has made.\"\n\nCaldwell-Stone says she finds the challenge to Ruby Bridges Goes to School \"just incredible.\" Written by Bridges herself, Caldwell-Stone says the book is \"age appropriate, developmentally appropriate\" and received \"excellent reviews\" for introducing the topic to children.\n\nDuring the Facebook Live conversation with Jason Reynolds, he was asked \"What do you think people are afraid of?\" when they ban books. Reynolds responded: \"There are many, many adults who are terrified of being challenged...because what happens is we will then be forced to grapple with our own biases, to grapple with our own ignorance.\" Later in the conversation he added, \"You've got to trust your kids a little more.\"\n\nMeghan Collins Sullivan edited this story."}]}
