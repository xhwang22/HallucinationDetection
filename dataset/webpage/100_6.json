It is not the first time.\n\nIn 2016, then Biju Janata Dal (BJD) MP Tathagata Satpathy moved a Private Member\u2019s Bill in the Lok Sabha to decriminalise defamation \u2014 the Protection of Speech and Reputation Bill (commonly known as the \u201cSpeech Bill\u201d). Satpathy, who is now the editor of Odia daily Dharitri, speaks to The Indian Express about what prompted him to introduce the Bill, its features, the response of other parties, and the effect criminal defamation has in today\u2019s political climate. Excerpts:\n\nAs an editor, I had about 87 defamation cases filed against me. In Odisha, you have a law that women don\u2019t have to deposit money if they want to file a defamation case. Normally, if you want to file a defamation case you have to deposit a certain percentage of what you claim in court. What happens if you level an allegation or publish a story against the police officials and bureaucrats in the newspapers is that they will get their wives or mothers or sisters to file a case against you. Even if you have enough evidence against them, they will file. Eventually, you will get cleared \u2014 in my case, I won all the cases if not in the lower court, then in the higher court. But it\u2019s harassment.\n\nSo, partly, my Bill was driven by my personal experiences. Because two proceedings, civil and criminal, for the same offence do not seem justified to me. If you look at the global picture, the criminal aspect of the defamation case is not there in any democratic country. The last one I know that had it was Australia but they also removed it a few years ago. In most countries, it\u2019s only the civil part. My simple counter was how can we prosecute twice for the same offence?\n\nI sought the help of lawyers and others, including journalists. Apar Gupta was one of the lawyers who played a key role in drafting that Bill. I may have read the Bill at least 100 times before I went ahead with it. Apar then suggested it would be good if we could put it up for public review, which we did. We had a website \u2014 speechbill.in \u2014 and sought people\u2019s views also. We received a lot of feedback.\n\nWhat were the features of the Bill?\n\nThe main feature of the Bill was that it decriminalised defamation and treated it as a civil offence. It had provisions to curb the chilling effects of criminal defamation and had provisions to prevent damage to reputations. It had quantification of damages for defamation, fixed the maximum amount of damages, and barred governments and institutions exercising government or statutory functions from filing defamation suits.\n\nHow relevant is it in the wake of recent political events?\n\nI did not foresee such an event. I always thought that it is very wrong. Today, everyone seems to have woken up. At the time, the Congress did not support my Bill, no one backed me. But, I wanted to put it on record for posterity at least. I would not say it was a watertight Bill. It needed improvement. But I would like MPs to take it up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing an editor, and an active politician not so long ago, what do you think of the position that the right to reputation is no less important a right than the right to freedom of speech?\n\nRight to reputation is a debatable point and that can never ever infringe on freedom of speech or freedom of expression. A statement or a post or a tweet can be said to be hurting someone\u2019s sense and sensibilities. We are seeing it across the country. Then, it is up to them, not to the defendant, to prove how their reputation has been hurt. It\u2019s in the legal process also that during the cross-examination the complainant has to prove how \u2026 but all they can do is to find one or two witnesses in their neighbourhood to say \u2018yes, we thought bad of her or him because of the remark\u2019.\n\nThere are instances of people in power using the defamation law. Do you think it is being used to silence people?\n\nYes, people in power become super touchy. Some people say vulgar things but defend those by claiming freedom of speech. When someone calls me leftist or presstitute or sickular, I get offended. I am very badly hurt because I do not consider myself as someone selling his pen, I consider myself to be neither secular nor Leftist. Yes, I consider myself a liberal, I agree. I was in the House (Lok Sabha) when a Minister of State uttered the word \u2018Presstitute\u2019 on the floor of the House. As an editor and a working journalist, I was hurt. We knew that nothing will come of it. Yes, the same people use defamation clauses against others.\n\nAnother thing is that our lower judiciary is not trained to handle so many issues that come up with something like defamation. They are not normal criminal cases but are hypothetical ones. Our lower judiciary is not equipped to handle them. We talk of judicial reforms and the law minister is constantly talking against the collegium. But they are talking about the Supreme Court that they are dealing with every day. But the common Indian does not get to reach the Supreme Court. They are penalised, prosecuted, sentenced, jailed, given life terms, and the appeals take years. Some die in prisons. I would say 99 per cent of our population even. The high courts seem very high. People can afford to go to only the lower courts. I do not think the lower courts can sit in judgment on such delicate issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHave you come across instances of defamation clauses being used against political rivals?\n\nI have never experienced (it), at least not in Odisha. But, of course, it comes up against the media. Of late, it has been happening. They are managing to corner opponents that way. The number of defamation cases was much lower 15-20 years back. Either people were gentler or they were not so touchy. If you start taking one line out of a speech, it can work any which way.\n\nYou are an editor. Does the new trend make you think twice before criticising someone powerful even if it\u2019s based on fact? Do you think there is increasing fear among citizens about criticising someone or exposing corruption?\n\nYes, people across India today are much more careful about what they say, especially about politics and politicians. Also about big business. All the powerful people.\n\nYou too?\n\nI am a don\u2019t-care-a-hoot kind of person but I refrain from being abusive. I speak what I like and also write what I think is correct. Also, must admit I have personally not felt fear or threatened, as yet."}, {"url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/tathagata-satpathy-mp-from-odisha-lends-support-for-net-neutrality/", "page_content": "Free-speech campaigners and internet activists received a major shot in the arm as Odisha MP Tathagata Satpathy lent his support for net neutrality by writing a letter to Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) chairman Rahul Khullar.\n\nSatpathy, who had captured the internet\u2019s charm about a month ago by participating in a free-wheeling chat on a Reddit AMA (ask-me-anything), is a member of the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) and was elected from the Dhenkanal constituency. Satpathy was then particularly praised for his Pink Floyd references and his open admission to smoking marijuana during his college days \u2014 such candid expressions that we have not come to expect from our elected parliamentarians.\n\n[related-post]\n\nSatpathy\u2019s letter to the TRAI chairman assumes significance as it comes in the backdrop of a raging debate, particularly on social media, over the alleged attempts of telecom companies to introduce differential pricing plans for over-the-top services like WhatsApp, Skype and Viber. Campaigners for a free internet have argued that these companies are trying to clamp down on the internet\u2019s transparency and freedom. While India does not have an existing legislation for net neutrality, TRAI has come up with a consultation paper that seeks views of the public on the matter. The debate, which has whipped up enormous intensity in the last few weeks, is supported by online petitions like this one on change.org which has already garnered more than 1,00,000 signatures.\n\nIn his letter, Satpathy argues that he uses the internet in different ways, by using messaging apps to keep contact with his staff, using cloud services to prepare documents and video calling to keep in touch with his constituents.\n\n\u201cInternet forms an integral part of how I do my work, therefore I see this move by TRAI as a threat to my functioning as a representative,\u201d the BJD MP writes in his letter.\n\nHe also argues in his letter that charging separately for over-the-top services will be seen as restricting the access to internet. Depicting TRAI\u2019s move as going against Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s dream of a digital India, Satpathy writes that the step will be against the \u201cdesires of those who wish to make India a modern nation.\u201d\n\nThe letter talks about how the net neutrality principle is not an \u2018elitist\u2019 problem as it also affects people with affordable smartphones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are a growing country and we should have proper laws in place, not to regulate, but to encourage the use of internet,\u201d he writes.\n\nRead Satpathy\u2019s full letter below."}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/tathagata-satapathy/", "page_content": "Tathagata Satpathy (born 1 April 1956) was a member of the 12th , 14th, 15th and 16th Lok Sabha of India. He represented the Dhenkanal constituency of Odisha, and was re-elected for the fourth time in 2014. He was a member of the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) political party, and the party's chief whip in the Lok Sabha. He took voluntary retirement from politics in March 2019. He is not an active politician ever since.\n\nLife and work\n\nTathagata Satpathy is the younger son of former Odisha Chief Minister Nandini Satpathy and Devendra Satpathy. He is the owner and editor of the daily Odia newspaper, Dharitri, and the English daily, Orissa Post.\n\nIn 2000, Satpathy joined the Orissa Gana Parishad ( a non political outfit), and served as its secretary general. After Naveen Patnaik got elected in 2000, Satpathy had used his newspaper Dharitri to criticise his policies which he does even now. In March 2004, just before the 2004 Indian general election, Satpathy reconciled with BJD. He said that he was forced to quit OGP due its changing into a political party as also forming an alliance with Janaki Ballabh Patnaik-led Indian National Congress (INC).\n\nHis nephew Suparno Satpathy had unsuccessfully contested him in 2014 for the office of MP Lok Sabha, Dhenkanal.\n\nIn March 2015, Tathagata Satpathy became the first Indian Member of Parliament to hold an official \"Ask Me Anything\" session on the content-sharing website Reddit. In April, Satpathy came forward in support of net neutrality, after the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) come out with a consultation paper on over-the-top (OTT) messaging services. In December 2015, Satpathy had supported a bill to decriminalise homosexuality. The bill was introduced by INC leader Shashi Tharoor. But, it was defeated with 71 against, 1 abstaining and 24 in favour.\n\nViews and opinions\n\nOn net neutrality\n\nIn March 2014, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) released a formal consultation paper on over-the-top (OTT) messaging services and whether telecom operators should be allowed to charge separately for some messaging apps. Soon afterwards, Tathagata Satpathy wrote an open letter to TRAI stating his support for net neutrality. In the letter, he said such a policy would hinder the Digital India project and kill new startups. He said that he used such apps to interact with his constituency and this policy will hinder his functioning as a representative.\n\nOn legalisation of cannabis\n\nTathagata Satpathy has criticised the ban on cannabis in India, while pointing out the long history of its usage as a ritual and recreational intoxicant. He has said that cannabis was banned in India while alcohol was not, because of \"an elitist bias\" as cannabis was a poor man's drug. He has said the addiction depends on person's character and not on the intoxicant. He has suggested an amendment to the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 to allow recreational and medicinal usage of marijuana. During his \"Ask Me Anything\" session on Reddit in March 2015, Satpathy admitted that he smoked cannabis when he was young. In August 2015, during the monsoon session of the Parliament, he proposed the decriminalisation of cannabis. In December 2015, he repeated his proposal during the winter session, saying that banning cannabis has forced villagers to turn to alcohol.\n\nOn homosexuality and moral policing\n\nTathagata Satpathy has condemned the Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalises homosexuality in India, calling it \"archaic\" and called for its repeal. He had supported a bill introduced by INC MP Shashi Tharoor to decriminalise homosexuality during the 2015 winter session of the Parliament. When the bill was defeated, Satpathy called it a very sad day. Satpathy has also condemned moral policing and called for a repeal of laws banning pornography in India.\n\nOn privacy and Aadhaar\n\nTathagata Satpathy has raised concerns that the Aadhaar project could be used for mass surveillance or ethnic cleansing in the future. He has questioned why a new identity card project was created despite having several identity cards systems. He has also criticised the decision to present the Aadhaar Bill, 2016 as a money bill. He pointed out that although the bill allows the sharing of biometric under circumstances of national security, there was no concrete definition of national security included in the bill.\n\nOn religious laws and missionaries\n\nSatpathy supports the implementation of a Uniform Civil Code in India. He has criticised those current laws which are based on various religions, saying that the world is moving beyond religious scriptures and such laws only divide the society. He has also said that a lot of faith-based foreign aid comes to Odisha through missionaries. They offer the poor Dalits free education and jobs, this results in mass conversions to Christianity. Satpathy has said that politicians should use the dictionary definition of secularism to avoid confusion.\n\nOther opinions\n\nSatpathy has supported the inclusion of Members of Parliament under the Jan Lokpal Bill to curb corruption. In December 2015, he criticised the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Bill, 2015 during a debate, saying that the government was favouring big corporations with such laws. He has also criticised the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana calling it flawed and that it looks good only on paper. He said it forces him to choose only 8 villages from his constituency for development out of 3000. Satpathy has opposed the proposal to make Hindi the national language.\n\nSatpathy has criticised the construction of new nuclear power plants in India, claiming that most of the world was now moving away from nuclear energy. He has also claimed that Areva nuclear firm of France sold outdated technology to Maharashtra. He has also said that the centre should release the data regarding the safety of nuclear power plants as they are in other countries."}, {"url": "https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/current-affairs-trends/tathagata-satpathy-mp-who-spoke-his-heart-on-cannabis-legalisation-decriminalising-section-377-quits-politics-3614371.html", "page_content": "Moneycontrol News\n\nBiju Janata Dal (BJD) Member of Parliament (MP) Tathagata Satpathy announced his retirement from active politics on March 5 to focus on journalism, setting political circles and social media abuzz.\n\nThat the 63-year-old MP from Odisha, who represents Dhenkenal constituency, is a man who speaks his mind in the Lok Sabha, has been displayed on numerous occasions.\n\nFor instance, Satpathy made headlines when, during an Ask Me Anything (AMA) session on Reddit, he vouched for the legalisation of cannabis, going on to even admit that he has smoked it while in college.\n\n\"I have smoked (and unlike Bill Clinton have inhaled) cannabis many a times,\" Satpathy is reported to have replied. The senior BJD leader, who is the party's chief whip in Lok Sabha, reinitiated his demand in the Lower House, wheeling away from the official position of his party.\n\n\"Cannabis is a drug that has been given a bad name, the alcohol lobby, peddling something far more dangerous, has managed to club cannabis with more dangerous narcotics,\" Satpathy had told The Hindu.\n\nBefore a Supreme Court of India (SC) verdict decriminalising homosexuality in September 2018, Satpathy was one of the few MPs who had batted for it.

He is also against the ban on pornography, reasoning that with changing times, laws should also change in order to change the societal outlook.\n\nThe son of former Odisha Chief Minister Nandini Satpathy, Tathagata entered politics during the 1980s, but tasted his first electoral success as a legislator in 1990.

Recreational use is probably true for not more than 5%; for the rest, it has medicinal purposes. The cannabis plant has tremendous amount of medicinal value and its potential for industrial usage can hardly be overstated. China is investing a few billion dollars in developing different strains of the marijuana plant towards several objectives. It has proper factories for processing marijuana. Many countries have developed fabrics. It has unlimited usage in diverse fields, including in the field of semiconductors.\n\nA potential cash crop\n\nThe cannabis plant is something natural to India, especially the northern hilly regions. It has the potential of becoming a cash crop for poor marginal farmers. If proper research is done and cultivation of marijuana encouraged at an official level, it can gradually become a source of income for poor people with small landholdings. That is one part. The other part is, even if you are growing paddy, you can grow marijuana on the margins.\n\nIndia should ideally focus on marijuana\u2019s medicinal use. It is known to help people with eye ailments, cancer, and joint pain. Incidentally, China is also doing a lot of research on marijuana for cancer cure. Marijuana does not cure cancer but it reportedly stops cancer from spreading.\n\nThe alcohol lobby, like the cigarette lobby, is very powerful and it would obviously not like natural intoxicants like weed to be made available legally and easily for the poor, as this would render weed cheaper than alcohol. Alcohol destroys the health and economy of families. Ideally one should not be using any intoxicant. No drugs at all. But I wish to allay fears that marijuana is a gateway drug. By itself, it is not an intoxication that is habit-forming. I am willing to admit that I have used it myself and I could quit it whenever I wanted. I was never addicted to it anyway. I am not addicted to anything except coffee.\n\nSo this banning of marijuana, I think, has been a sweeping action depriving people of the good things it has to offer. Back then, pressures from the U.S., which is now legalising marijuana, forced us to conform. Now, several states in the U.S. have legalised pot. In fact, a company called American Green has bought a small township (Nipton, California) and wants to make it a \u2018smart ganja\u2019 township. The townsfolk will get fabrics, medicines, as well as smokable marijuana.\n\nTime to make it legal\n\nIn Odisha, where weed is still legal, people can buy marijuana for recreational use. The elderly people in my constituency congregate every Monday evening and do a puja called the Trinath Mela. They sit under a big tree and pray to the three supreme beings and smoke ganja in the open. It is a custom that has been in existence for hundreds of years; I see no reason for making it illegal.\n\nLaws should be made to suit people so that they do not break the law to maintain their lifestyle. Laws should weave around an existing lifestyle, not obstruct it. Or else laws will be broken. If you encourage people in their normal day-to-day life to break certain laws, the sanctity of laws breaks down.\n\nTathagata Satpathy is a Biju Janata Dal MP representing Dhenkanal, Odisha\n\nAs told to Anuradha Raman\n\nRIGHT | Arshad Hussain\n\nCannabis is poisonous for both the soul and mind. It creates a false world of pleasure\n\nArshad Hussain\n\nNarender was a truck driver and a regular cannabis user. He looked forward to his trip to Srinagar to buy high-quality cannabis. His wish was granted. He rejoiced and told his friends that he could hear the colours \u2014 red, green, white and all \u2014 talk to him. He drove back to Punjab in a haze. The beauty of National Highway 1A mesmerised him. The mountain ranges swam in front of his eyes. He imagined himself to be flying till he emerged out of the Jawahar Tunnel. Instead of taking a right, he took a left turn and this time he actually flew in the air. His vehicle rolled down the 200-metre gorge and he died instantly.\n\nAmin is a chronic patient at a psychiatric hospital. He has been there for the last 15 years, largely staying as an in-patient and discharged occasionally. He was admitted in 2002 when he had turned into a vegetable \u2014 mute, dumb and oblivious to the world. His history revealed that he had started taking cannabis at 13. He would take it once a while and then the frequency increased till he started taking it daily. A time came when he lived to have cannabis. His personality started deteriorating. He would occasionally turn violent as well. He also stopped taking care of himself, locking himself in a room, even defecating and urinating there. That is when he was brought to the hospital where he was diagnosed with disorganised schizophrenia. It was too late to retrieve him \u2014 he did not respond to the treatment.\n\nBackdoor entry to crime\n\nThe fact remains that cannabis is a highly addictive substance, produces dependence, and is toxic for the brain. It is the gateway to harder substances. The countries which legalised cannabis are increasingly realising that in the garb of cannabis, they have legalised drug warlords and their business. They have increased the vulnerabilities of the youth. The lure of escape from the everyday world that cannabis offers is irresistible for many people.\n\nThe legalisation of cannabis in cities like Amsterdam led to an increase in crime, from mugging to prostitution. The legalisation of cannabis is achieving nothing other than glorifying drug lords as businessmen who earn revenue after playing havoc with the social and mental health of societies. In a society where people are just getting literate, the danger posed by cannabis and other drugs can be devastating for the country\u2019s health, especially the youth.\n\nSevere health effects\n\nThe debate on legalisation of cannabis is erroneous as we compare it with alcohol and nicotine, the two biggest killers. Cannabis is poisonous for both the soul and mind. It creates a false world of pleasure which is not in our control and for which we have to pay a heavy price in the form of amotivational syndrome, psychosis, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in vulnerable individuals.\n\nIt has also been seen that the places where cannabis is easily available are scenes of many a heinous crime. Besides, cannabis is the gateway to substance dependence history for many patients.\n\nFor a cannabis-free society\n\nWe have had similar debates when we legalised smoking nicotine. But its detrimental fallout is now playing out right before our eyes. Now all health budgets are spent minimising the damage. I hope and pray for a society where happiness is derived from humour and friendship, social interactions and bonding, altruism and philanthropy, sports and adventures and not make-believe pleasures with a massive toll on health. Let us make our world healthier for our posterity and let us pledge for a cannabis-free society.\n\nArshad Hussain is with the Department of Psychiatry, Government Medical College, Srinagar\n\nCENTRE | Tripti Tandon\n\nCriminalisation of a commodity as widespread as cannabis makes little economic, social or legal sense\n\nTripti Tandon\n\nIndia\u2019s affinity to psychoactive substances is centuries old. Documented references to cannabis date back to 2000-1400 BC, with texts describing it as \u201csacred grass\u201d. Medical use of cannabis is recorded in books like the Susruta Samhita. To date, bhang, ganja and charas \u2014 products of the cannabis plant \u2014 are enlisted in the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 for use in Ayurvedic, Siddha and Unani medicine.\n\nWhat the law says\n\nThe British colonial administration adopted a \u2018licence and tax\u2019 approach whereby bhang, ganja and charas were classified as \u201cintoxicating drugs\u201d and regulated under excise laws. Post-Independence, a provision calling for the \u201cprohibition of manufacture, sale or transportation or consumption of intoxicating liquors\u201d was proposed as part of the Directive Principles of State Policy. It was extended to \u2018drugs\u2019 after a Member of the Constituent Assembly remarked about the \u201cevil of opium prevailing in the country\u201d. There was no mention, let alone discussion, on cannabis. Interestingly, the demand to add tobacco alongside intoxicating drinks and drugs was ignored. Consequently, Article 47 of the Constitution reads: \u201cThe State shall endeavour to bring about prohibition of the consumption except for medicinal purposes of intoxicating drinks and of drugs which are injurious to health.\u201d\n\nImportantly, the policy of prohibition is encouraged in relation to substances that are \u201cinjurious to health\u201d. Many in the scientific community doubt if, and to what extent, cannabis meets this threshold. In 1997, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi published a report titled \u2018Cannabis, Health Damage? Legislative Options\u2019, which found cannabis use to be less harmful than certain licit substances like alcohol and tobacco.\n\nThe Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act of 1985 criminalised the cannabis plant, ganja and charas but not bhang. Although overtly punitive, the Act allows State governments to \u201cpermit and regulate\u201d cannabis for medical, scientific and, to some extent, industrial uses. Few States, however, have made use of their regulatory powers. As a result, people continue to be arrested and jailed for the possession and use of cannabis. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, 67% of the cases registered under the NDPS Act in 2015 were for ganja and charas.\n\nCannabis was made illegal because the international community required us to do so. Now, as more and more countries are questioning and moving away from the \u2018war on drugs\u2019, India retains the dubious distinction of having the death penalty for subsequent drug offences, including for hashish (charas). Worse still, a recent public interest litigation filed in the Supreme Court seeks even stricter measures against drug use and trafficking. It would do well for the parties concerned to look at data, including a fact-finding study by the British Home Office in 2014, which found \u201cno obvious relationship between the toughness of a country\u2019s enforcement against drug possession, and levels of drug use in that country\u201d.\n\nThere is a growing body of research into cannabinoids, principally tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, and their efficacy in treating symptoms of certain medical conditions. India\u2019s national NDPS policy, however, categorically states: \u201cCultivation of cannabis will not be permitted given its limited proven uses for medical purposes.\u201d\n\nGoing against global trends\n\nCriminalisation of a commodity as popular and widespread as cannabis makes little economic, social or legal sense. Many countries are rightly experimenting with legislative models of decriminalisation as well as legalisation of cannabis, in order to break the connection between organised crime and the growing number of law-abiding people who use cannabis.\n\nTripti Tandon is Deputy Director of Lawyers Collective, an NGO working on human rights issues"}, {"url": "https://www.livemint.com/Politics/cEdbfFmpXQ6GNImduzrRTI/Who-is-Tathagata-Satpathy.html", "page_content": "New Delhi: Amidst the cacophony of aggressive voices from both the government and the opposition during the debate on the Jawaharlal Nehru University row and the death of Hyderabad University student Rohith Vemula, the speech by senior Biju Janata Dal (BJD) leader Tathagata Satpathy came as a breath of fresh air.\n\n\u201cI am heartbroken to say that the youth of the country doesn\u2019t deserve us.

Our MPs never obstructed the functioning of Parliament. They have not only raised issues exclusive to the state but also participated in discussions that had national impact. Under the leadership of Chief Minister of Odisha Naveen Patnaik, who has a national outlook, we have tried to perform as a responsible party.\n\nWas the BJD an opposition party or an ally of the ruling BJP?\n\nWe supported the Union government on issues that were pro-India. We opposed wrong policies like the Land Acquisition Bill, violence by cow vigilante groups, the JNU issue and many more.\n\nIn the last few months, many regional party leaders including some CMs have been trying to stitch a coalition of opposition parties. But Patnaik has not stepped out of Odisha. What does it mean in the context of the upcoming election?\n\nI have not spoken to Patnaik regarding this matter. But if every CM took the responsibility for the well-being of their citizens, there will be effective governance. This is not to say that Patnaik has resolved every problem. He has focussed on providing clean and effective governance and has been successful to a great extent. That is why the people of the state have repeatedly elected him. Patnaik is not a run-of-the-mill politician. He has carved out a niche for himself. As far as the upcoming elections are concerned, Patnaik is focussing only on the state. The BJD will continue to work for the development of Odisha.\n\nIs the Lok Sabha election not your priority?\n\nPolitically, Patnaik moves with equal vigour for both (Assembly and general elections). His campaign style is unique \u2014 he spends a day at a parliamentary constituency and during that time he covers all the assembly areas in it. He travels by helicopter and the Lok Sabha candidate accompanies him. The candidate for the particular Assembly seat joins him at the venue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat will the BJD focus on in its election campaign?\n\nThe pro-poor and pro-farmer policies and their implementation. We will also show to the people that whenever the Congress and the BJP were in power at the Centre, Odisha was neglected even though it contributed substantially to the exchequer. We are not considered politically powerful because we have lesser number of seats in the Lok Sabha.\n\nWho is the BJD\u2019s primary opponent?\n\nThe BJP is facing a downward slide at the national level. I can see a perceptible change in the popularity of the party in Odisha also. The BJP is on a decline and the Congress is not gaining. So the fight will be against the BJP and Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf no party manages to get a majority in the Lok Sabha polls, what will be the BJD\u2019s stance?\n\nAs far as I know, Patnaik will always try to maintain an equidistance. But I would also underline that he will ensure a stable government at the Centre. He will not maintain equidistance at the cost of the Union of India. Whichever government comes to power, if it serves the people of this country and takes care of the interests of Odisha, the BJD will support.\n\nDo you think the KALIA (Krushak Assistance for Livelihood and Income Augmentation) scheme can resolve the agrarian crisis in the state?\n\nThe Kalia scheme is a meticulously planned programme. It covers farm labourers, sharecroppers and landowning farmers. In fact, farm labourer will get more money than land-owning farmers. But I am aware that the scheme alone cannot resolve the crisis. It\u2019s true that we have been in power for nearly two decades. The allegation that we have not created enough cold storage is not acceptable. These time-consuming and capital-intensive projects cannot be built by the states alone."}], "Tathagata Satpathy has been a vocal critic of the government's policies on tribal rights.": [{"url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/tathagata-satpathy-interview-cong-defamation-rahul-gandhi-8542406/", "page_content": "With Congress leader Rahul Gandhi convicted of criminal defamation last month, and subsequently disqualified as Lok Sabha MP, there have been calls for a review of the criminal defamation legislation in India. It is not the first time.\n\nIn 2016, then Biju Janata Dal (BJD) MP Tathagata Satpathy moved a Private Member\u2019s Bill in the Lok Sabha to decriminalise defamation \u2014 the Protection of Speech and Reputation Bill (commonly known as the \u201cSpeech Bill\u201d). Satpathy, who is now the editor of Odia daily Dharitri, speaks to The Indian Express about what prompted him to introduce the Bill, its features, the response of other parties, and the effect criminal defamation has in today\u2019s political climate. Excerpts:\n\nAs an editor, I had about 87 defamation cases filed against me. In Odisha, you have a law that women don\u2019t have to deposit money if they want to file a defamation case. Normally, if you want to file a defamation case you have to deposit a certain percentage of what you claim in court. What happens if you level an allegation or publish a story against the police officials and bureaucrats in the newspapers is that they will get their wives or mothers or sisters to file a case against you. Even if you have enough evidence against them, they will file. Eventually, you will get cleared \u2014 in my case, I won all the cases if not in the lower court, then in the higher court. But it\u2019s harassment.\n\nSo, partly, my Bill was driven by my personal experiences. Because two proceedings, civil and criminal, for the same offence do not seem justified to me. If you look at the global picture, the criminal aspect of the defamation case is not there in any democratic country. The last one I know that had it was Australia but they also removed it a few years ago. In most countries, it\u2019s only the civil part. My simple counter was how can we prosecute twice for the same offence?\n\nI sought the help of lawyers and others, including journalists. Apar Gupta was one of the lawyers who played a key role in drafting that Bill. I may have read the Bill at least 100 times before I went ahead with it. Apar then suggested it would be good if we could put it up for public review, which we did. We had a website \u2014 speechbill.in \u2014 and sought people\u2019s views also. We received a lot of feedback.\n\nWhat were the features of the Bill?\n\nThe main feature of the Bill was that it decriminalised defamation and treated it as a civil offence. It had provisions to curb the chilling effects of criminal defamation and had provisions to prevent damage to reputations. It had quantification of damages for defamation, fixed the maximum amount of damages, and barred governments and institutions exercising government or statutory functions from filing defamation suits.\n\nHow relevant is it in the wake of recent political events?\n\nI did not foresee such an event. I always thought that it is very wrong. Today, everyone seems to have woken up. At the time, the Congress did not support my Bill, no one backed me. But, I wanted to put it on record for posterity at least. I would not say it was a watertight Bill. It needed improvement. But I would like MPs to take it up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing an editor, and an active politician not so long ago, what do you think of the position that the right to reputation is no less important a right than the right to freedom of speech?\n\nRight to reputation is a debatable point and that can never ever infringe on freedom of speech or freedom of expression. A statement or a post or a tweet can be said to be hurting someone\u2019s sense and sensibilities. We are seeing it across the country. Then, it is up to them, not to the defendant, to prove how their reputation has been hurt. It\u2019s in the legal process also that during the cross-examination the complainant has to prove how \u2026 but all they can do is to find one or two witnesses in their neighbourhood to say \u2018yes, we thought bad of her or him because of the remark\u2019.\n\nThere are instances of people in power using the defamation law. Do you think it is being used to silence people?\n\nYes, people in power become super touchy. Some people say vulgar things but defend those by claiming freedom of speech. When someone calls me leftist or presstitute or sickular, I get offended. I am very badly hurt because I do not consider myself as someone selling his pen, I consider myself to be neither secular nor Leftist. Yes, I consider myself a liberal, I agree. I was in the House (Lok Sabha) when a Minister of State uttered the word \u2018Presstitute\u2019 on the floor of the House. As an editor and a working journalist, I was hurt. We knew that nothing will come of it. Yes, the same people use defamation clauses against others.\n\nAnother thing is that our lower judiciary is not trained to handle so many issues that come up with something like defamation. They are not normal criminal cases but are hypothetical ones. Our lower judiciary is not equipped to handle them. We talk of judicial reforms and the law minister is constantly talking against the collegium. But they are talking about the Supreme Court that they are dealing with every day. But the common Indian does not get to reach the Supreme Court. They are penalised, prosecuted, sentenced, jailed, given life terms, and the appeals take years. Some die in prisons. I would say 99 per cent of our population even. The high courts seem very high. People can afford to go to only the lower courts. I do not think the lower courts can sit in judgment on such delicate issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHave you come across instances of defamation clauses being used against political rivals?\n\nI have never experienced (it), at least not in Odisha. But, of course, it comes up against the media. Of late, it has been happening. They are managing to corner opponents that way. The number of defamation cases was much lower 15-20 years back. Either people were gentler or they were not so touchy. If you start taking one line out of a speech, it can work any which way.\n\nYou are an editor. Does the new trend make you think twice before criticising someone powerful even if it\u2019s based on fact? Do you think there is increasing fear among citizens about criticising someone or exposing corruption?\n\nYes, people across India today are much more careful about what they say, especially about politics and politicians. Also about big business. All the powerful people.\n\nYou too?\n\nI am a don\u2019t-care-a-hoot kind of person but I refrain from being abusive. I speak what I like and also write what I think is correct.

A senior Biju Janata Dal leader and chief whip of the party in the House, 61-year-old Satpathy has the knack of saying things in such a way that he is heard by his critics and admirers alike.\n\nIn the recently concluded monsoon session, Satpathy, who is also the editor of the widely circulated Oriya daily Dharitri and the English daily Orissa Post, took a dig at the \u2018cow worshipers\u2019 in the ruling side, telling them plainly that they should learn to recognise their mother as the Jersey variety found in abundance at present cannot be called the \u201choly Indian cow\u201d.\n\nIn an interview with The Wire, he laments that those who came to power in New Delhi by using the vehicle of democracy are now attempting to break it down. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to maintain the vehicle that has brought them from Ayodhya to Delhi.\u201d\n\nA fourth-term Lok Sabha MP, Satpathy says he does not buy that there is no alternative to Narendra Modi in 2019. He hopes for the arrival of the Indian spring in politics and is confident of the re-emergence of the regional parties. He claims that even their joining forces could not be ruled out though the picture at present is \u201chazy\u201d.\n\n\u201c2019 is an open field. What can be predicted is not worth predicting. What cannot be predicted is most likely what seems impossible now.\u201d\n\nExcerpts:\n\nHow do you see the scenario in 2019 Lok Sabha polls as BJP looks unstoppable since the opposition parties have failed to get their act together so far?\n\nA lot of people say BJP may go in for snap polls. I disagree somewhat with this assessment. The people leading BJP are well aware that polls before time create an atmosphere not conducive to those who summon the polls. We saw this in 2004 and many times in the past 70 years.\n\nSo 2019 is an open field. What can be predicted is not worth predicting. What cannot be predicted is most likely what seems impossible now.\n\nBut, there is no opposition unity now?\n\nIf you remember, in 1977 Indira Gandhi seemed the strongest, the most powerful, and obviously because of the Emergency not worth messing with. And since there were no opposition leaders worth their salt at that time, the outcome was considered predictable by many.\n\nHowever, one thing I remember was that an average Indian was praising Indira Gandhi and keeping quiet when asked about others. I sense a similar situation of bhakts praising their leader today, although the bhakts are also becoming somewhat feeble.\n\nBut BJP chief Amit Shah is being hailed as \u2018Chanakya\u2019 after the party\u2019s landslide in Uttar Pradesh, suggesting thereby that New Delhi will be retained via Lucknow again.\n\nI will not be the competent person to comment on any individual. But then in the same breath one must admit that Uttar Pradesh over the past few decades had a very muddled and tumultuous politics. People of UP probably wanted to check out an alternative and they did what they did. To take credit for people\u2019s decision is like a windsock that blows in the same direction that wind blows.\n\nAt the end of three years of Narendra Modi dispensation, how do you assess the NDA\u2019s achievements and failures? Would you see glass as half full?\n\nAfter three years, the BJP government looks to have fully emptied the glass. I would give only the example of Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana, which was touted as the pet project of the prime minister.\n\nToday, most of the BJP MPs have refrained from choosing one particular village in their respective constituencies. Similarly, one has to look at Swachh Bharat programme for which all of us are paying through our nose in form of hefty cess in every single transaction. Instead of making people aware about cleanliness, if you start taking money, then it becomes your sole responsibility to ensure cleanliness everywhere. If you want to see how effective the Swachh Bharat programme is, all one needs to do is go in and around New Delhi railway stations.\n\nBut the government claims that it has made a surgical strike on corruption through demonetisation and ushering in GST.\n\nI have yet to see how demonetisation has helped the economy. GST is not unique to India, but what is unique is multiple layers of taxes. That \u2018one nation, one tax\u2019 slogan is obviously a big sham. Today\u2019s reports that the industrial output has dipped to 2% as against 7.1% in same April-June quarter in 2016 should be an indicator of how helpful demonetisation and GST have been for our people.\n\nBJP is suggesting that when Narendra Modi has to only contend with Rahul Gandhi, then there is no challenge to it in 2019. Where is the option they ask. Your comments.\n\nPeople do not always look for a single individual when they want to escape from the yoke of one individual.\n\nIt seems you do not see much relevance of Congress in the next elections.\n\nI see re-emergence of regional parties which may be the only path out of a non-democratic attitude at the Centre. So it is not necessarily an alternative individual or the Congress that can be a threat. It could be a group of people willing to lead a pro-democracy movement. Let us think of an Indian spring.\n\nBut regional parties are getting decimated as we saw in Uttar Pradesh. Besides, there is politics of intimidation by Modi-Shah against them.\n\nJust that some regional parties had become complacent and they had to take a beating. I am sure all of them including SP (Samajwadi Party) and BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party) will tie their shoe laces and will be fighting fit in the very near future. Even joining of regional forces may not be ruled out at this moment even though the picture may seem a bit hazy today.\n\nBut you have seen that the Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has developed cold feet.\n\nNot every regional party is like Nitish Kumar and his JD(U). It is fair to change political partners but never when you are elected in one partnership and you change mid-course.\n\nIf Nitish Kumar would have called for elections and gone with BJP that would have been a sign of a true democrat. Today it becomes easy to label such actions with a negative colour.\n\nSunil Gatade is a senior journalist.\n\nNote: This article was erroneously credited to M.K. Venu earlier.

His campaign style is unique \u2014 he spends a day at a parliamentary constituency and during that time he covers all the assembly areas in it. He travels by helicopter and the Lok Sabha candidate accompanies him. The candidate for the particular Assembly seat joins him at the venue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat will the BJD focus on in its election campaign?\n\nThe pro-poor and pro-farmer policies and their implementation. We will also show to the people that whenever the Congress and the BJP were in power at the Centre, Odisha was neglected even though it contributed substantially to the exchequer. We are not considered politically powerful because we have lesser number of seats in the Lok Sabha.\n\nWho is the BJD\u2019s primary opponent?\n\nThe BJP is facing a downward slide at the national level. I can see a perceptible change in the popularity of the party in Odisha also. The BJP is on a decline and the Congress is not gaining. So the fight will be against the BJP and Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf no party manages to get a majority in the Lok Sabha polls, what will be the BJD\u2019s stance?\n\nAs far as I know, Patnaik will always try to maintain an equidistance. But I would also underline that he will ensure a stable government at the Centre. He will not maintain equidistance at the cost of the Union of India. Whichever government comes to power, if it serves the people of this country and takes care of the interests of Odisha, the BJD will support.\n\nDo you think the KALIA (Krushak Assistance for Livelihood and Income Augmentation) scheme can resolve the agrarian crisis in the state?\n\nThe Kalia scheme is a meticulously planned programme. It covers farm labourers, sharecroppers and landowning farmers. In fact, farm labourer will get more money than land-owning farmers. But I am aware that the scheme alone cannot resolve the crisis. It\u2019s true that we have been in power for nearly two decades. The allegation that we have not created enough cold storage is not acceptable. These time-consuming and capital-intensive projects cannot be built by the states alone."}, {"url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/bjd-mp-tathagata-satpathy-quits-active-politics-to-refocus-on-journalism-5612355/", "page_content": "Four-time MP and BJD\u2019s chief whip in the outgoing 16th Lok Sabha Tathagata Satpathy on Tuesday announced his retirement from active politics.\n\nThe MP from Dhenkanal said he would not contest the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.\n\nThe reason, he said, was his desire to go back to journalism. \u201cThere is a need for more fearless voices in journalism now,\u201d Satpathy, owner and editor of leading Odia-language newspaper Dharitri, told The Indian Express.\n\n\u201cDistancing myself from politics to refocus on journalism,\u201d Satpathy said. \u201cI realised that politics is not the only means to support people.

Recreational use is probably true for not more than 5%; for the rest, it has medicinal purposes. The cannabis plant has tremendous amount of medicinal value and its potential for industrial usage can hardly be overstated. China is investing a few billion dollars in developing different strains of the marijuana plant towards several objectives. It has proper factories for processing marijuana. Many countries have developed fabrics. It has unlimited usage in diverse fields, including in the field of semiconductors.\n\nA potential cash crop\n\nThe cannabis plant is something natural to India, especially the northern hilly regions. It has the potential of becoming a cash crop for poor marginal farmers. If proper research is done and cultivation of marijuana encouraged at an official level, it can gradually become a source of income for poor people with small landholdings. That is one part. The other part is, even if you are growing paddy, you can grow marijuana on the margins.\n\nIndia should ideally focus on marijuana\u2019s medicinal use. It is known to help people with eye ailments, cancer, and joint pain. Incidentally, China is also doing a lot of research on marijuana for cancer cure. Marijuana does not cure cancer but it reportedly stops cancer from spreading.\n\nThe alcohol lobby, like the cigarette lobby, is very powerful and it would obviously not like natural intoxicants like weed to be made available legally and easily for the poor, as this would render weed cheaper than alcohol. Alcohol destroys the health and economy of families. Ideally one should not be using any intoxicant. No drugs at all. But I wish to allay fears that marijuana is a gateway drug. By itself, it is not an intoxication that is habit-forming. I am willing to admit that I have used it myself and I could quit it whenever I wanted. I was never addicted to it anyway. I am not addicted to anything except coffee.\n\nSo this banning of marijuana, I think, has been a sweeping action depriving people of the good things it has to offer. Back then, pressures from the U.S., which is now legalising marijuana, forced us to conform. Now, several states in the U.S. have legalised pot. In fact, a company called American Green has bought a small township (Nipton, California) and wants to make it a \u2018smart ganja\u2019 township. The townsfolk will get fabrics, medicines, as well as smokable marijuana.\n\nTime to make it legal\n\nIn Odisha, where weed is still legal, people can buy marijuana for recreational use. The elderly people in my constituency congregate every Monday evening and do a puja called the Trinath Mela. They sit under a big tree and pray to the three supreme beings and smoke ganja in the open. It is a custom that has been in existence for hundreds of years; I see no reason for making it illegal.\n\nLaws should be made to suit people so that they do not break the law to maintain their lifestyle. Laws should weave around an existing lifestyle, not obstruct it. Or else laws will be broken. If you encourage people in their normal day-to-day life to break certain laws, the sanctity of laws breaks down.\n\nTathagata Satpathy is a Biju Janata Dal MP representing Dhenkanal, Odisha\n\nAs told to Anuradha Raman\n\nRIGHT | Arshad Hussain\n\nCannabis is poisonous for both the soul and mind. It creates a false world of pleasure\n\nArshad Hussain\n\nNarender was a truck driver and a regular cannabis user. He looked forward to his trip to Srinagar to buy high-quality cannabis. His wish was granted. He rejoiced and told his friends that he could hear the colours \u2014 red, green, white and all \u2014 talk to him. He drove back to Punjab in a haze. The beauty of National Highway 1A mesmerised him. The mountain ranges swam in front of his eyes. He imagined himself to be flying till he emerged out of the Jawahar Tunnel. Instead of taking a right, he took a left turn and this time he actually flew in the air. His vehicle rolled down the 200-metre gorge and he died instantly.\n\nAmin is a chronic patient at a psychiatric hospital. He has been there for the last 15 years, largely staying as an in-patient and discharged occasionally. He was admitted in 2002 when he had turned into a vegetable \u2014 mute, dumb and oblivious to the world. His history revealed that he had started taking cannabis at 13. He would take it once a while and then the frequency increased till he started taking it daily. A time came when he lived to have cannabis. His personality started deteriorating. He would occasionally turn violent as well. He also stopped taking care of himself, locking himself in a room, even defecating and urinating there. That is when he was brought to the hospital where he was diagnosed with disorganised schizophrenia. It was too late to retrieve him \u2014 he did not respond to the treatment.\n\nBackdoor entry to crime\n\nThe fact remains that cannabis is a highly addictive substance, produces dependence, and is toxic for the brain. It is the gateway to harder substances. The countries which legalised cannabis are increasingly realising that in the garb of cannabis, they have legalised drug warlords and their business. They have increased the vulnerabilities of the youth. The lure of escape from the everyday world that cannabis offers is irresistible for many people.\n\nThe legalisation of cannabis in cities like Amsterdam led to an increase in crime, from mugging to prostitution. The legalisation of cannabis is achieving nothing other than glorifying drug lords as businessmen who earn revenue after playing havoc with the social and mental health of societies. In a society where people are just getting literate, the danger posed by cannabis and other drugs can be devastating for the country\u2019s health, especially the youth.\n\nSevere health effects\n\nThe debate on legalisation of cannabis is erroneous as we compare it with alcohol and nicotine, the two biggest killers. Cannabis is poisonous for both the soul and mind. It creates a false world of pleasure which is not in our control and for which we have to pay a heavy price in the form of amotivational syndrome, psychosis, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in vulnerable individuals.\n\nIt has also been seen that the places where cannabis is easily available are scenes of many a heinous crime. Besides, cannabis is the gateway to substance dependence history for many patients.\n\nFor a cannabis-free society\n\nWe have had similar debates when we legalised smoking nicotine. But its detrimental fallout is now playing out right before our eyes. Now all health budgets are spent minimising the damage. I hope and pray for a society where happiness is derived from humour and friendship, social interactions and bonding, altruism and philanthropy, sports and adventures and not make-believe pleasures with a massive toll on health. Let us make our world healthier for our posterity and let us pledge for a cannabis-free society.\n\nArshad Hussain is with the Department of Psychiatry, Government Medical College, Srinagar\n\nCENTRE | Tripti Tandon\n\nCriminalisation of a commodity as widespread as cannabis makes little economic, social or legal sense\n\nTripti Tandon\n\nIndia\u2019s affinity to psychoactive substances is centuries old. Documented references to cannabis date back to 2000-1400 BC, with texts describing it as \u201csacred grass\u201d. Medical use of cannabis is recorded in books like the Susruta Samhita. To date, bhang, ganja and charas \u2014 products of the cannabis plant \u2014 are enlisted in the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 for use in Ayurvedic, Siddha and Unani medicine.\n\nWhat the law says\n\nThe British colonial administration adopted a \u2018licence and tax\u2019 approach whereby bhang, ganja and charas were classified as \u201cintoxicating drugs\u201d and regulated under excise laws. Post-Independence, a provision calling for the \u201cprohibition of manufacture, sale or transportation or consumption of intoxicating liquors\u201d was proposed as part of the Directive Principles of State Policy. It was extended to \u2018drugs\u2019 after a Member of the Constituent Assembly remarked about the \u201cevil of opium prevailing in the country\u201d. There was no mention, let alone discussion, on cannabis. Interestingly, the demand to add tobacco alongside intoxicating drinks and drugs was ignored. Consequently, Article 47 of the Constitution reads: \u201cThe State shall endeavour to bring about prohibition of the consumption except for medicinal purposes of intoxicating drinks and of drugs which are injurious to health.\u201d\n\nImportantly, the policy of prohibition is encouraged in relation to substances that are \u201cinjurious to health\u201d. Many in the scientific community doubt if, and to what extent, cannabis meets this threshold. In 1997, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi published a report titled \u2018Cannabis, Health Damage? Legislative Options\u2019, which found cannabis use to be less harmful than certain licit substances like alcohol and tobacco.\n\nThe Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act of 1985 criminalised the cannabis plant, ganja and charas but not bhang. Although overtly punitive, the Act allows State governments to \u201cpermit and regulate\u201d cannabis for medical, scientific and, to some extent, industrial uses. Few States, however, have made use of their regulatory powers. As a result, people continue to be arrested and jailed for the possession and use of cannabis. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, 67% of the cases registered under the NDPS Act in 2015 were for ganja and charas.\n\nCannabis was made illegal because the international community required us to do so. Now, as more and more countries are questioning and moving away from the \u2018war on drugs\u2019, India retains the dubious distinction of having the death penalty for subsequent drug offences, including for hashish (charas). Worse still, a recent public interest litigation filed in the Supreme Court seeks even stricter measures against drug use and trafficking. It would do well for the parties concerned to look at data, including a fact-finding study by the British Home Office in 2014, which found \u201cno obvious relationship between the toughness of a country\u2019s enforcement against drug possession, and levels of drug use in that country\u201d.\n\nThere is a growing body of research into cannabinoids, principally tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, and their efficacy in treating symptoms of certain medical conditions. India\u2019s national NDPS policy, however, categorically states: \u201cCultivation of cannabis will not be permitted given its limited proven uses for medical purposes.\u201d\n\nGoing against global trends\n\nCriminalisation of a commodity as popular and widespread as cannabis makes little economic, social or legal sense. Many countries are rightly experimenting with legislative models of decriminalisation as well as legalisation of cannabis, in order to break the connection between organised crime and the growing number of law-abiding people who use cannabis.\n\nTripti Tandon is Deputy Director of Lawyers Collective, an NGO working on human rights issues"}, {"url": "https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/people-shouldnt-be-jailed-speaking-their-mind-tathagata-satpathy-50841", "page_content": "People shouldn't be jailed for speaking their mind: Tathagata Satpathy\n\nThe senior leader said has been also provoked by \"two contradictory judgements\" on defamation laws.\n\nnews Defamation\n\nNirandra Dev\n\nAsserting that it made little sense in a democracy to jail people for \"speaking their minds\", senior Biju Janata Dal (BJD) member Tathagata Satpathy has said that the country's age-old defamation laws need an \"urgent re-look\" and maintained that he would soon move a private member's bill in the Lok Sabha to bring about much-needed change.\n\n\n\n\"Essentially, I am questioning a law that actually puts the right to freedom of speech -- as enshrined in the constitution itself -- in question,\" Satpathy told IANS in an interview here.\n\n\n\n\"The criminal defamation law, therefore, needs to go. The present law actually mandates a system wherein people can be jailed for speaking their minds. I have decided to move a private member's bill in the winter session (in November-December),\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe MP from Dhenkanal in Odisha maintained that lately he has been also provoked by \"two contradictory judgements\" on defamation laws.\n\n\n\n\"In one case, the Supreme Court, on the request of petitioners Subramanian Swamy, Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal, considered the validity of the existing law and said it is constitutional. But in another case, the apex court counselled Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa to understand that public figures must face criticism. I am looking for more clarity,\" Satpathy said.\n\n\n\nIn its ruling in May, the apex court had noted that \"the right to freedom of speech and expression is not an absolute right\" and that freedom of expression has to be \"balanced with the other person's right to reputation\", he said, but in August it said differently on Jayalalithaa's petition, pointing out that the criminal defamation law should not be misused.\n\n\n\nMaintaining that the existing laws have been \"generally abused\", he said that, in his bill, he is trying to focus on three basic features: \"Remove criminality, protect reputation and codify and strengthen civil proceedings as the lower courts, in the absence of effective guidelines, create problems for subordinate judges to process cases.\"\n\n\n\n\"There are so many inherent contradictory issues in the defamation law. One can file both criminal and civil suits. The defamation amount is left to anybody's wild imagination. One popular news magazine was sued for Rs 500 crore. Is that magazine worth that huge amount?\"\n\n\n\nSatpathy, who has a penchant for taking as a compliment words like \"maverick\" hurled at him, said: \"As editor and publisher of my newspaper 'Dharitri', after a five-year defamation case in court, I was fined Rs 50,000 and jailed for six months.\"\n\n\n\nAsked whether his decision to push the bill would seek to protect the media as, on a number of occasions, defamation cases are filed against journalists and media organisations, Satpathy said, albeit in a lighter vein: \"It is just the opposite. Actually, I want to protect the rich and my politician friends from you all bad journalists.\"\n\n\n\nSatpathy maintained that on the broader level, he looks at the issue of need for changes in the defamation law from a social perspective, saying: \"If my suggestions are accepted and changes are brought about, this will go a long way in strengthening the judicial process vis-a-vis freedom of expression.\"\n\n\n\n\"So far the reforms we talk about are confined to the economic paradigm only. But we must note, we live in a society and not in an economy per se. So, unless we bring social reforms, we cannot have a sound legal system which would ultimately make economic reforms sustainable,\" he contended.\n\n\n\nHe said the initial response on his move from members of parliament has been overwhelming. \"I have got good response and MPs have assured cooperation. I have also spoken to (Union Law Minister) Ravi Shankar Prasad and (BJP MP) Subaramanian Swamy, who happens to be at the receiving end of defamation laws,\" he said.\n\n\n\n(Nirendra Dev can be contacted at nirendra.n@ians.in)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bjd-mp-tathagata-satpathy-quits-politics-to-refocus-on-journalism-1471111-2019-03-05", "page_content": "By Press Trust of India: Tathagata Satpathy, four-time Biju Janata Dal's (BJD) MP from Odisha on Tuesday announced his retirement from politics to \"refocus\" on journalism.\n\nSatpathy's announcement came a day after his former party colleague in Lok Sabha Baijayant Panda joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n\nWhile Panda had resigned from the BJD as well as the Lok Sabha due to differences with party president and chief minister Naveen Patnaik, Satpathy's decision has surprised all.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSon of former Odisha chief minister Nandini Satpathy, Tathagata Satpathy is a Lok Sabha MP from Dhenkanal constituency of the state.\n\n\"There is a need for more fearless voices in journalism now.
