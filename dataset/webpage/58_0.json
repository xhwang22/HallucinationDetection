He also won the Pulitzer Prize in 1957 for his biography, Profiles in Courage. He married Jacqueline Bouvier (widely known as Jackie) in September 1953, and the pair shared two children, Caroline and John F.

Rosemary's story is a tragic one: the third child of Joseph and Rose Kennedy was deprived of oxygen at birth, resulting in developmental and behavioral issues. In 1941, Rosemary's father scheduled a lobotomy for his 23-year-old daughter, and the botched procedure resulted in Rosemary becoming permanently disabled. Following the procedure, Rosemary was sent to a psychiatric facility in upstate New York and then sent to Saint Coletta School for Exceptional Children in Wisconsin, where her siblings did not see her for two decades. She died at the age of 86 on Jan. 7, 2005, of natural causes.\n\n04 of 09 Kathleen Cavendish Horace Abrahams/Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Kathleen Agnes Kennedy, also known as \"Kick,\" was born on Feb. 20, 1920.

She married William Cavendish in May 1944, though he was killed in World War II just four months later. On May 13, 1948, Kathleen tragically died with her married lover in a plane crash over France.\n\n06 of 09 Patricia Kennedy Lawford The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Born on May 6, 1924, Patricia had aspirations of becoming a film producer and director. Her father, Joseph Kennedy Sr., not only had a knack for running his sons' political careers, but also Hollywood studios. She married English actor Peter Lawford in April 1954 and they had four children together: Christopher (pictured with his mother), Sydney, Victoria and Robin. The pair divorced in 1966. She died of pneumonia on Sept. 17, 2006. She was 82.\n\n07 of 09 Robert F. Kennedy PhotoQuest/Getty. Robert Francis Kennedy was born on Nov. 20, 1925. Following in the footsteps of his older brothers, Robert joined the Navy and also had political aspirations. He married Ethel Skakel in June 1950 and the couple had 11 children together. He was appointed the U.S. Attorney General by his brother, J.F.K., and served as New York State Senator from January 1965 until he was assassinated while campaigning for the presidency on June 6, 1968.\n\n08 of 09 Jean Kennedy Smith Jean Kennedy Smith in 2017. Sonia Moskowitz/WireImage Jean Kennedy Smith was born on Feb. 20, 1928. In 1993, at the age of 65, Jean was appointed the ambassador to Ireland under Bill Clinton and played a role in the peace talks in Northern Ireland. She wrote a memoir in 2016 titled The Nine of Us: Growing Up Kennedy, reflecting on her eight siblings and her family's political prowess. \"It is hard for me to fully comprehend that I was growing up with brothers who eventually occupy the highest offices of our nation, including president of the United States,\" Jean wrote, according to the Associated Press. \"At the time, they were simply my playmates. They were the source of my amusement and the objects of my admiration.\" She was the last surviving Kennedy sibling when she died on June 17, 2020. She was 92."}, {"url": "https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/about-jfk/the-kennedy-family/robert-f-kennedy", "page_content": "Robert Francis Kennedy was born on November 20, 1925, in Brookline, Massachusetts, the seventh child in the closely knit and competitive family of Rose and Joseph P. Kennedy. \"I was the seventh of nine children,\" he later recalled, \"and when you come from that far down you have to struggle to survive.\"\n\nHe attended Milton Academy and, after wartime service in the Navy, received his degree in government from Harvard University in 1948. He earned his law degree from the University of Virginia Law School three years later. Perhaps more important for his education was the Kennedy family dinner table, where his parents involved their children in discussions of history and current affairs. \"I can hardly remember a mealtime,\" Robert Kennedy said, \"when the conversation was not dominated by what Franklin D. Roosevelt was doing or what was happening in the world.\"\n\nIn 1950, Robert Kennedy married Ethel Skakel of Greenwich, Connecticut, daughter of Ann Brannack Skakel and George Skakel, founder of Great Lakes Carbon Corporation. Robert and Ethel Kennedy later had eleven children. In 1952, he made his political debut as manager of his older brother John's successful campaign for the US Senate from Massachusetts.\n\nThe following year, he served briefly on the staff of the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Senator Joseph McCarthy. Disturbed by McCarthy's controversial tactics, Kennedy resigned from the staff after six months. He later returned to the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations as chief counsel for the Democratic minority, in which capacity he wrote a report condemning McCarthy's investigation of alleged Communists in the Army. His later work as Chief Counsel for the Senate Rackets Committee investigating corruption in trade unions won him national recognition for exposing Teamsters' Union leaders Jimmy Hoffa and David Beck.\n\nIn 1960, he was the tireless and effective manager of John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign. After the election, he was appointed Attorney General in President Kennedy's cabinet. While Attorney General, he won respect for his diligent, effective and nonpartisan administration of the Department of Justice.\n\nAttorney General Kennedy launched a successful drive against organized crime, and convictions against organized crime figures rose by 800% during his tenure. He also became increasingly committed to helping African Americans win the right to vote, attend integrated schools and use public accommodations. He demonstrated his commitment to civil rights during a 1961 speech at the University of Georgia Law School: \"We will not stand by or be aloof. We will move. I happen to believe that the 1954 [Supreme Court school desegregation] decision was right. But my belief does not matter. It is the law. Some of you may believe the decision was wrong. That does not matter. It is the law.\"\n\nIn September 1962, Attorney General Kennedy sent US Marshals and troops to Oxford, Mississippi to enforce a federal court order admitting the first African American student - James Meredith - to the University of Mississippi. The riot that had followed Meredith's registration at \"Ole Miss\" had left two dead and hundreds injured. Robert Kennedy believed that voting was the key to achieving racial justice and collaborated with President Kennedy in proposing the most far-reaching civil rights statute since Reconstruction, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which passed eight months after President Kennedy's death.\n\nRobert Kennedy was not only President Kennedy's Attorney General, he was also his closest advisor and confidant. As a result of this unique relationship, the Attorney General played a key role in several critical foreign policy decisions. During the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, for instance, he helped develop the Kennedy administration's strategy to blockade Cuba instead of taking military action that could have led to nuclear war. He then negotiated with the Soviet Union on removal of the weapons.\n\nSoon after President Kennedy's death, Robert Kennedy resigned as Attorney General and, in 1964, ran successfully for the United States Senate from New York. His opponent, incumbent Republican Senator Kenneth Keating, labeled Kennedy a \"carpetbagger\" during the closely contested campaign. Kennedy responded to the attacks with humor. \"I have [had] really two choices over the period of the last ten months,\" he said at Columbia University. \"I could have stayed in - I could have retired. [Laughter.] And I - my father has done very well and I could have lived off him. [Laughter and applause.] ... I tell you frankly I don't need this title because I [could] be called General, I understand, for the rest of my life. [Laughter and applause.] And I don't need the money and I don't need the office space... [Laughter.] ... Frank as it is - and maybe it's difficult to believe in the state of New York - I'd like to just be a good United States Senator. I'd like to serve.\" Kennedy waged an effective statewide campaign and, aided by President Lyndon Johnson's landslide, won the November election by 719,000 votes.\n\nAs New York's Senator, he initiated a number of projects in the state, including assistance to underprivileged children and students with disabilities and the establishment of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation to improve living conditions and employment opportunities in depressed areas of Brooklyn. Since 1967, the program has been a model for communities all across the nation.\n\nThese programs were part of a larger effort to address the needs of the dispossessed and powerless in America - the poor, the young, racial minorities and Native Americans. He sought to bring the facts about poverty to the conscience of the American people, journeying into urban ghettos, Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta and migrant workers' camps. \"There are children in the Mississippi Delta,\" he said, \"whose bellies are swollen with hunger... Many of them cannot go to school because they have no clothes or shoes. These conditions are not confined to rural Mississippi. They exist in dark tenements in Washington, DC, within sight of the Capitol, in Harlem, in South Side Chicago, in Watts. There are children in each of these areas who have never been to school, never seen a doctor or a dentist. There are children who have never heard conversation in their homes, never read or even seen a book.\"\n\nHe sought to remedy the problems of poverty through legislation to encourage private industry to locate in poverty-stricken areas, thus creating jobs for the unemployed, and stressed the importance of work over welfare.\n\nRobert Kennedy was also committed to the advancement of human rights abroad. He traveled to Eastern Europe, Latin America and South Africa to share his belief that all people have a basic human right to participate in the political decisions that affect their lives and to criticize their government without fear of reprisal. He also believed that those who strike out against injustice show the highest form of courage. \"Each time a man stands up for an ideal,\" he said in a 1966 speech to South African students, \"or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.\"\n\nKennedy was also absorbed during his Senate years by a quest to end the war in Vietnam. As a new Senator, Kennedy had originally supported the Johnson administration's policies in Vietnam, but also called for a greater commitment to a negotiated settlement and a renewed emphasis on economic and political reform within South Vietnam. As the war continued to widen and America's involvement deepened, Senator Kennedy came to have serious misgivings about President Johnson's conduct of the war. Kennedy publicly broke with the Johnson administration for the first time in February 1966, proposing participation by all sides (including the Viet Cong's political arm, the National Liberation Front) in the political life of South Vietnam. The following year, he took responsibility for his role in the Kennedy administration's policy in Southeast Asia, and urged President Johnson to cease the bombing of North Vietnam and reduce, rather than enlarge, the war effort. In his final Senate speech on Vietnam, Kennedy said, \"Are we like the God of the Old Testament that we can decide, in Washington, DC, what cities, what towns, what hamlets in Vietnam are going to be destroyed?... Do we have to accept that?... I do not think we have to. I think we can do something about it.\"\n\nOn March 16, 1968, Robert Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination. It was, in the words of Arthur Schlesinger Jr., \"an uproarious campaign, filled with enthusiasm and fun... It was also a campaign moving in its sweep and passion.\" Indeed, he challenged the complacent in American society and sought to bridge the great divides in American life - between the races, between the poor and the affluent, between young and old, between order and dissent. His 1968 campaign brought hope to an American people troubled by discontent and violence at home and war in Vietnam. He won critical primaries in Indiana and Nebraska and spoke to enthusiastic crowds across the nation.\n\nRobert Francis Kennedy was fatally shot on June 5, 1968 at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California shortly after claiming victory in that state's crucial Democratic primary. He was 42 years old. Although his life was cut short, Robert Kennedy's vision and ideals live on today through the work of the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial in Washington, DC."}, {"url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/john-f-kennedy/", "page_content": "The biography for President Kennedy and past presidents is courtesy of the White House Historical Association.\n\nJohn F.

In 1955, while recuperating from a back operation, he wrote Profiles in Courage, which won the Pulitzer Prize in history.\n\nIn 1956 Kennedy almost gained the Democratic nomination for Vice President, and four years later was a first-ballot nominee for President. Millions watched his television debates with the Republican candidate, Richard M. Nixon. Winning by a narrow margin in the popular vote, Kennedy became the first Roman Catholic President.\n\nHis Inaugural Address offered the memorable injunction: \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you\u2013ask what you can do for your country.\u201d As President, he set out to redeem his campaign pledge to get America moving again. His economic programs launched the country on its longest sustained expansion since World War II; before his death, he laid plans for a massive assault on persisting pockets of privation and poverty.\n\nResponding to ever more urgent demands, he took vigorous action in the cause of equal rights, calling for new civil rights legislation. His vision of America extended to the quality of the national culture and the central role of the arts in a vital society.\n\nHe wished America to resume its old mission as the first nation dedicated to the revolution of human rights. With the Alliance for Progress and the Peace Corps, he brought American idealism to the aid of developing nations. But the hard reality of the Communist challenge remained.\n\nShortly after his inauguration, Kennedy permitted a band of Cuban exiles, already armed and trained, to invade their homeland. The attempt to overthrow the regime of Fidel Castro was a failure. Soon thereafter, the Soviet Union renewed its campaign against West Berlin. Kennedy replied by reinforcing the Berlin garrison and increasing the Nation\u2019s military strength, including new efforts in outer space. Confronted by this reaction, Moscow, after the erection of the Berlin Wall, relaxed its pressure in central Europe.\n\nInstead, the Russians now sought to install nuclear missiles in Cuba. When this was discovered by air reconnaissance in October 1962, Kennedy imposed a quarantine on all offensive weapons bound for Cuba. While the world trembled on the brink of nuclear war, the Russians backed down and agreed to take the missiles away. The American response to the Cuban crisis evidently persuaded Moscow of the futility of nuclear blackmail.\n\nKennedy now contended that both sides had a vital interest in stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and slowing the arms race\u2013a contention which led to the test ban treaty of 1963. The months after the Cuban crisis showed significant progress toward his goal of \u201ca world of law and free choice, banishing the world of war and coercion.\u201d His administration thus saw the beginning of new hope for both the equal rights of Americans and the peace of the world.\n\nFor more information about President Kennedy, please visit the John F.

His parents were Joseph Kennedy, a successful businessman, and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy. He was the second of nine children. While Jack grew up with every material advantage, he suffered from a series of medical ailments but learned to underplay the effects of his illnesses.\n\nPresident John F.

Kennedy Presidential Library & Museum Local Identifier: ST-C22-1-62\n\nWorld War II changed Kennedy in many ways. He joined the Navy and served in the Pacific, where his PT boat was sunk by a Japanese destroyer. He never forgot his own war experience and the bravery of his Navy crew.\n\nAfter the war, JFK decided to run for office. In 1946 he won election as congressman for Massachusetts and served for six years. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1952. In 1953 he married Jacqueline Bouvier, and their daughter, Caroline, was born in 1957, and their son, John Jr., was born in 1960.\n\nAt 43 years old, he became the youngest man elected President of the United States, defeating Richard Nixon in 1960.\n\nOne of his first actions after taking office was creating the Peace Corps, which today still sends volunteers on two-year missions to live and work with people around the globe.\n\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis in late 1962 threatened the world with possible nuclear war. The United States confronted the Soviet Union over the placement of nuclear weapons on Cuba, and in secret negotiations, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev agreed to remove the missiles.\n\nKennedy challenged the U.S. to be the first country to send a man to the moon by the end of the 1960s. The United States reached President Kennedy\u2019s goal on July 20, 1969, when the crew of Apollo 11 landed on the lunar surface.\n\nAt home, Kennedy urged an end to racial segregation and asked Congress for a civil rights bill. Before the bill could get through Congress, JFK was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963.\n\nPeople remember John F. Kennedy as a President who was young and energetic. But he is also remembered as a leader who made a difference. His words and actions made people want to help others and serve their country."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-F-Kennedy", "page_content": "Whether the U.S. should maintain its embargo enforced by John F. Kennedy against Cuba is hotly debated. Some say Cuba has not met the conditions required to lift it, and the U.S. will look weak for lifting the sanctions. Others say the 50-year policy has failed to achieve its goals, and Cuba does not pose a threat to the United States. For more on the Cuba embargo debate, visit ProCon.org .\n\nEarly life\n\nThe second of nine children, Kennedy was reared in a family that demanded intense physical and intellectual competition among the siblings\u2014the family\u2019s touch football games at their Hyannis Port retreat later became legendary\u2014and was schooled in the religious teachings of the Roman Catholic church and the political precepts of the Democratic Party. His father, Joseph Patrick Kennedy, had acquired a multimillion-dollar fortune in banking, bootlegging, shipbuilding, and the film industry, and as a skilled player of the stock market. His mother, Rose, was the daughter of John F. (\u201cHoney Fitz\u201d) Fitzgerald, onetime mayor of Boston. They established trust funds for their children that guaranteed lifelong financial independence. After serving as the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Joseph Kennedy became the U.S. ambassador to Great Britain, and for six months in 1938 John served as his secretary, drawing on that experience to write his senior thesis at Harvard University (B.S., 1940) on Great Britain\u2019s military unpreparedness. He then expanded that thesis into a best-selling book, Why England Slept (1940).\n\nIn the fall of 1941 Kennedy joined the U.S. Navy and two years later was sent to the South Pacific. By the time he was discharged in 1945, his older brother, Joe, who their father had expected would be the first Kennedy to run for office, had been killed in the war, and the family\u2019s political standard passed to John, who had planned to pursue an academic or journalistic career.\n\nBritannica Quiz Comprehension Quiz: Cold War\n\nJohn Kennedy himself had barely escaped death in battle. Commanding a patrol torpedo (PT) boat, he was gravely injured when a Japanese destroyer sank it in the Solomon Islands. Marooned far behind enemy lines, he led his men back to safety and was awarded the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps Medal for heroism. He also returned to active command at his own request. (These events were later depicted in a Hollywood film, PT 109 [1963], that contributed to the Kennedy mystique.) However, the further injury to his back, which had bothered him since his teens, never really healed. Despite operations in 1944, 1954, and 1955, he was in pain for much of the rest of his life. He also suffered from Addison disease, though this affliction was publicly concealed. \u201cAt least one-half of the days he spent on this earth,\u201d wrote his brother Robert, \u201cwere days of intense physical pain.\u201d (After he became president, Kennedy combated the pain with injections of amphetamines\u2014then thought to be harmless and used by more than a few celebrities for their energizing effect. According to some reports, both Kennedy and the first lady became heavily dependent on these injections through weekly use.) None of this prevented Kennedy from undertaking a strenuous life in politics. His family expected him to run for public office and to win."}, {"url": "https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/john-f-kennedy-is-born", "page_content": "One of America\u2019s best-loved presidents, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, is born into a politically and socially prominent family in Brookline, Massachusetts, on May 29, 1917. He was the first American president to be born and then serve in the 20th century.\n\nIn 1935, Kennedy enrolled at Harvard University and received a degree in international affairs with honors in 1940. While there, he suffered a debilitating back injury that would have life-long repercussions. After college, Kennedy served on a Navy PT boat in World War II. In 1952, he won a seat in the House of Representatives and then served in the Senate for seven years, beginning in 1953. Also in 1953, he married Jacqueline Bouvier. In subsequent years, Kennedy underwent several dangerous spinal operations; it was during his recuperation from one such operation that he wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning history Profiles in Courage. Unfortunately, the operations never succeeded in curing his persistent back pain and, for the rest of his life, Kennedy took a powerful combination of pain killers, muscle relaxants and sleeping pills, a fact he successfully hid from the public. The pain, however, did not prevent him from becoming a rising Democratic star in the Senate; he ran for the presidency in 1960.\n\nKennedy\u2019s support for liberal economic and social policies, such as civil rights and increased funding for education and public housing, in addition to his strong anti-communist stance, appealed to a broad cross-section of Americans during the presidential campaign. In addition to his political philosophy, Kennedy capitalized on his handsome features and charismatic personality to beat Republican candidate Richard Nixon to become the nation\u2019s 35th president. In a televised debate, the well-groomed and relaxed Kennedy had appeared more presidential than a haggard-looking, unshaven, visibly nervous Nixon. Many observers believed this debate was critical to his success.\n\nPresident Kennedy was the youngest man ever elected to the office. His youth, intelligence and worldliness\u2014along with his beautiful, stylish and much-admired wife\u2013charmed Americans and Europeans alike. His children, Caroline and John Jr., were often photographed cavorting around the White House grounds with their pets or playing under their father\u2019s desk in the Oval Office. Kennedy\u2019s brother, Bobby, also young and enthusiastic, served as his attorney general and closest advisor. The American public increasingly saw the Kennedy family as a kind of American royalty and the press portrayed Kennedy\u2019s administration as a sort of modern-day Camelot, with the president himself as King Arthur presiding over an ideal society.\n\nAs president, Kennedy combined a fervent stance against communism with a liberal domestic agenda. He was a strong proponent of civil rights as well as a Cold War hawk. He authorized covert operations to remove Fidel Castro from power and, in 1962, challenged the Soviet Union to remove nuclear missiles installed on Cuba. The resulting Cuban Missile Crisis was a frighteningly tense showdown between JFK and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev that brought the two nuclear superpowers to the brink of war. JFK also sought peaceful means of fighting communism\u2014he established the Peace Corps and funded scientific research programs to fight poverty and illness and provide aid to developing nations. By encouraging American youth to donate their time and energy to international aid, JFK hoped to provide positive democratic role models to developing nations. In a 1961 speech, Kennedy advocated for a vigorous U.S. space program and vowed to send an American to the moon by the close of the 1960s.\n\nIn 1963, Kennedy was assassinated while driving through Dallas, Texas, in a convertible. Lee Harvey Oswald shot Kennedy in the head from the sixth floor of a book depository. Texas Governor John Connally and Jackie Kennedy were also in the car. Connally was hit in the back, chest, wrist and thigh, but eventually made a full recovery. Jackie was uninjured.\n\nA bystander named Abraham Zapruder happened to capture the shooting on his 8mm home-movie camera. Zapruder\u2019s film provided graphic visuals of JFK\u2019s death and has been endlessly analyzed for evidence of a potential conspiracy. In 1964, the federally appointed Warren Commission investigated the assassination and concluded that Oswald acted alone. Some scholars, investigators and amateur sleuths, however, still insist Kennedy\u2019s death was a coup d\u2019etat committed by hard-line U.S. anti-communists who feared Kennedy would pull out the U.S. advisors he had sent to Vietnam in 1962 and act soft on the communist threat from the USSR. Another conspiracy theory involves a concerted effort by organized crime, the Pentagon, and the CIA to murder the president; this view was adapted by Oliver Stone into the 1991 film JFK.\n\nKennedy is buried in Arlington National Cemetery, where an eternal flame burns in his memory."}, {"url": "https://www.ancientfaces.com/person/harry-kennedy-birth-1904-death-1976/6361961", "page_content": "Refresh this page to see various historical events that occurred during Harry's lifetime.\n\nIn 1904, in the year that Harry Kennedy was born, the Russo-Japanese war began. The Russian Empire and the Japanese Empire began fighting over the territories of Manchuria and Korea. Russia wanted a warm water port on the Pacific Ocean while Japan feared growing encroachment from Russia into Asia. So the Japan fleet launched a surprise attack on the Russian Navy and a one year war began. President Roosevelt of the United States brokered peace between the two nations. It was the first time in the modern era that an Asian power showed its dominance over a European power.\n\nIn 1914, he was merely 10 years old when in only his second big-screen appearance, Charlie Chaplin played the Little Tramp, his most famous character. The silent film was made in January and released the following year. Of the character, Chaplin said: \"On the way to the wardrobe I thought I would dress in baggy pants, big shoes, a cane and a derby hat. I wanted everything a contradiction: the pants baggy, the coat tight, the hat small and the shoes large.\" The moustache was added to age his 24-year-old face without masking his expressions.\n\nIn 1932, by the time he was 28 years old, five years to the day after Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic, Amelia Earhart flew solo from Newfoundland to Ireland, the first woman to cross the Atlantic solo and the first to replicate Lindbergh's feat.

Within a week, 25 people had died and 130 people had been hospitalized. It was the first known instance of what came to be called \"Legionnaires Disease.\""}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/political-figures/john-f-kennedy", "page_content": "(1917-1963)\n\nWho Was John F. Kennedy?\n\nJohn F. Kennedy served in both the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate before becoming the 35th president in 1961. As president, Kennedy faced a number of foreign crises, especially in Cuba and Berlin, but managed to secure such achievements as the Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty and the Alliance for Progress. On November 22, 1963, Kennedy was assassinated while riding in a motorcade in Dallas, Texas.\n\nEarly Life\n\nKennedy was born on May 29, 1917, in Brookline, Massachusetts. Both the Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys were wealthy and prominent Irish Catholic Boston families. Kennedy's paternal grandfather, P.J. Kennedy, was a wealthy banker and liquor trader, and his maternal grandfather, John E. Fitzgerald, nicknamed \"Honey Fitz,\" was a skilled politician who served as a congressman and as the mayor of Boston. Kennedy's mother, Rose Elizabeth Fitzgerald, was a Boston debutante, and his father, Joseph Kennedy Sr., was a successful banker who made a fortune on the stock market after World War I. Joe Kennedy Sr. went on to a government career as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and as an ambassador to Great Britain.\n\nJohn, nicknamed \"Jack,\" was the second oldest of a group of nine extraordinary siblings. His brothers and sisters include Eunice, the founder of the Special Olympics; Robert, a U.S. Attorney General, and Ted, one of the most powerful senators in American history. The Kennedy children remained close-knit and supportive of each other throughout their entire lives.\n\nJoseph and Rose largely spurned the world of Boston socialites into which they had been born to focus instead on their children's education. Joe Sr. in particular obsessed over every detail of his kids' lives, a rarity for a father at that time. As a family friend noted, \"Most fathers in those days simply weren't that interested in what their children did. But Joe Kennedy knew what his kids were up to all the time.\" Joe Sr. had great expectations for his children, and he sought to instill in them a fierce competitive fire and the belief that winning was everything. He entered his children in swimming and sailing competitions and chided them for finishing in anything but first place. John's sister, Eunice, later recalled, \"I was twenty-four before I knew I didn't have to win something every day.\" John bought into his father's philosophy that winning was everything. \"He hates to lose at anything,\" Eunice said. \"That's the only thing Jack gets really emotional about \u2014 when he loses.\"\n\nEducation\n\nDespite his father's constant reprimands, young Kennedy was a poor student and a mischievous boy. He attended a Catholic boys' boarding school in Connecticut called Canterbury, where he excelled at English and history, the subjects he enjoyed, but nearly flunked Latin, in which he had no interest. Despite his poor grades, Kennedy continued on to Choate, an elite Connecticut preparatory school. Although he was obviously brilliant \u2014 evidenced by the extraordinary thoughtfulness and nuance of his work on the rare occasions when he applied himself \u2014 Kennedy remained at best a mediocre student, preferring sports, girls and practical jokes to coursework.\n\nHis father wrote to him by way of encouragement, \"If I didn't really feel you had the goods I would be most charitable in my attitude toward your failings ... I am not expecting too much, and I will not be disappointed if you don't turn out to be a real genius, but I think you can be a really worthwhile citizen with good judgment and understanding.\" Kennedy was in fact very bookish in high school, reading ceaselessly but not the books his teachers assigned. He was also chronically ill during his childhood and adolescence; he suffered from severe colds, the flu, scarlet fever and even more severe, undiagnosed diseases that forced him to miss months of school at a time and occasionally brought him to the brink of death.\n\nAfter graduating from Choate and spending one semester at Princeton, Kennedy transferred to Harvard University in 1936. There, he repeated his by then well-established academic pattern, excelling occasionally in the classes he enjoyed but proving only an average student due to the omnipresent diversions of sports and women. Handsome, charming and blessed with a radiant smile, Kennedy was incredibly popular with his Harvard classmates. His friend Lem Billings recalled, \"Jack was more fun than anyone I've ever known, and I think most people who knew him felt the same way about him.\" Kennedy was also an incorrigible womanizer. He wrote to Billings during his sophomore year, \"I can now get tail as often and as free as I want which is a step in the right direction.\"\n\nNevertheless, as an upperclassman, Kennedy finally grew serious about his studies and began to realize his potential. His father had been appointed Ambassador to Great Britain, and on an extended visit in 1939, Kennedy decided to research and write a senior thesis on why Britain was so unprepared to fight Germany in World War II. An incisive analysis of Britain's failures to meet the Nazi challenge, the paper was so well-received that upon Kennedy's graduation in 1940 it was published as a book, Why England Slept, selling more than 80,000 copies. Kennedy's father sent him a cablegram in the aftermath of the book's publication: \"Two things I always knew about you one that you are smart two that you are a swell guy love dad.\"\n\nU.S. Navy Service\n\nShortly after graduating from Harvard, Kennedy joined the U.S. Navy and was assigned to command a patrol torpedo boat in the South Pacific. On August 2, 1943, his boat, PT-109, was rammed by a Japanese warship and split in two. Two sailors died and Kennedy badly injured his back. Hauling another wounded sailor by the strap of his life vest, Kennedy led the survivors to a nearby island, where they were rescued six days later. The incident earned him the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for \"extremely heroic conduct\" and a Purple Heart for the injuries he suffered.\n\nHowever, Kennedy's older brother, Joe Jr., who had also joined the Navy, was not so fortunate. A pilot, he died when his plane blew up in August 1944. Handsome, athletic, intelligent and ambitious, Joseph Kennedy Jr. had been pegged by his father as the one among his children who would some day become president of the United States. In the aftermath of Joe Jr.'s death, Kennedy took his family's hopes and aspirations for his older brother upon himself.\n\nUpon his discharge from the Navy, Kennedy worked briefly as a reporter for Hearst Newspapers. Then in 1946, at the age of 29, he decided to run for the U.S. House of Representatives from a working-class district of Boston, a seat being vacated by Democrat James Michael Curly. Bolstered by his status as a war hero, his family connections and his father's money, Kennedy won the election handily. However, after the glory and excitement of publishing his first book and serving in World War II, Kennedy found his work in Congress incredibly dull. Despite serving three terms, from 1946 to 1952, Kennedy remained frustrated by what he saw as stifling rules and procedures that prevented a young, inexperienced representative from making an impact. \"We were just worms in the House,\" he later recalled. \"Nobody paid attention to us nationally.\"\n\nCongressman and Senator\n\nIn 1952, seeking greater influence and a larger platform, Kennedy challenged Republican incumbent Henry Cabot Lodge for his seat in the U.S. Senate. Once again backed by his father's vast financial resources, Kennedy hired his younger brother Robert as his campaign manager. Robert Kennedy put together what one journalist called \"the most methodical, the most scientific, the most thoroughly detailed, the most intricate, the most disciplined and smoothly working state-wide campaign in Massachusetts history \u2013 and possibly anywhere else.\" In an election year in which Republicans gained control of both Houses of Congress, Kennedy nevertheless won a narrow victory, giving him considerable clout within the Democratic Party. According to one of his aides, the decisive factor in Kennedy's victory was his personality: \"He was the new kind of political figure that people were looking for that year, dignified and gentlemanly and well-educated and intelligent, without the air of superior condescension.\"\n\nShortly after his election, Kennedy met a beautiful young woman named Jacqueline Bouvier at a dinner party and, in his own words, \"leaned across the asparagus and asked her for a date.\" They were married on September 12, 1953. John and Jackie had three children: Caroline, John Jr. and Patrick Kennedy.\n\nKennedy continued to suffer frequent illnesses during his career in the Senate. While recovering from one surgery, he wrote another book, profiling eight senators who had taken courageous but unpopular stances. Profiles in Courage won the 1957 Pulitzer Prize for biography, and Kennedy remains the only American president to win a Pulitzer Prize.\n\nPresidential Candidate and Presidency\n\nKennedy's eight-year Senate career was relatively undistinguished. Bored by the Massachusetts-specific issues on which he had to spend much of his time, Kennedy was more drawn to the international challenges posed by the Soviet Union's growing nuclear arsenal and the Cold War battle for the hearts and minds of Third World nations. In 1956, Kennedy was very nearly selected as Democratic presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson's running mate, but was ultimately passed over for Estes Kefauver from Tennessee. Four years later, Kennedy decided to run for president.\n\nIn the 1960 Democratic primaries, Kennedy outmaneuvered his main opponent, Hubert Humphrey, with superior organization and financial resources. Selecting Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson as his running mate, Kennedy faced Vice President Richard Nixon in the general election. The election turned largely on a series of televised national debates in which Kennedy bested Nixon, an experienced and skilled debater, by appearing relaxed, healthy and vigorous in contrast to his pallid and tense opponent. On November 8, 1960, Kennedy defeated Nixon by a razor-thin margin to become the 35th president of the United States of America.\n\nKennedy's election was historic in several respects. At the age of 43, he was the second youngest American president in history, second only to Theodore Roosevelt, who assumed the office at 42. He was also the first Catholic president and the first president born in the 20th century. Delivering his legendary inaugural address on January 20, 1961, Kennedy sought to inspire all Americans to more active citizenship. \"Ask not what your country can do for you,\" he said. \"Ask what you can do for your country.\"\n\nForeign Affairs\n\nKennedy's greatest accomplishments during his brief tenure as president came in the arena of foreign affairs. Capitalizing on the spirit of activism he had helped to ignite, Kennedy created the Peace Corps by executive order in 1961. By the end of the century, over 170,000 Peace Corps volunteers would serve in 135 countries. Also in 1961, Kennedy created the Alliance for Progress to foster greater economic ties with Latin America, in hopes of alleviating poverty and thwarting the spread of communism in the region.\n\nKennedy also presided over a series of international crises. On April 15, 1961, he authorized a covert mission to overthrow leftist Cuban leader Fidel Castro with a group of 1,500 CIA-trained Cuban refugees. Known as the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the mission proved an unmitigated failure, causing Kennedy great embarrassment.\n\nIn August 1961, to stem massive waves of emigration from Soviet-dominated East Germany to American ally West Germany via the divided city of Berlin, Nikita Khrushchev ordered the construction of the Berlin Wall, which became the foremost symbol of the Cold War.\n\nHowever, the greatest crisis of the Kennedy administration was the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962. Discovering that the Soviet Union had sent ballistic nuclear missiles to Cuba, Kennedy blockaded the island and vowed to defend the United States at any cost. After several of the tensest days in history, during which the world seemed on the brink of nuclear annihilation, the Soviet Union agreed to remove the missiles in return for Kennedy's promise not to invade Cuba and to remove American missiles from Turkey. Eight months later, in June 1963, Kennedy successfully negotiated the Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty with Great Britain and the Soviet Union, helping to ease Cold War tensions. It was one of his proudest accomplishments.\n\nDomestic Policy\n\nPresident Kennedy's record on domestic policy was rather mixed. Taking office in the midst of a recession, he proposed sweeping income tax cuts, raising the minimum wage and instituting new social programs to improve education, health care and mass transit. However, hampered by lukewarm relations with Congress, Kennedy only achieved part of his agenda: a modest increase in the minimum wage and watered down tax cuts.\n\nThe most contentious domestic issue of Kennedy's presidency was civil rights. Constrained by Southern Democrats in Congress who remained stridently opposed to civil rights for Black citizens, Kennedy offered only tepid support for civil rights reforms early in his term.\n\nNevertheless, in September 1962 Kennedy sent his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, to Mississippi to use the National Guard and federal marshals to escort and defend civil rights activist James Meredith as he became the first Black student to enroll at the University of Mississippi on October 1, 1962. Near the end of 1963, in the wake of the March on Washington and Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Had a Dream\" speech, Kennedy finally sent a civil rights bill to Congress. One of the last acts of his presidency and his life, Kennedy's bill eventually passed as the landmark Civil Rights Act in 1964.\n\nAssassination\n\nOn November 21, 1963, President Kennedy flew to Fort Worth, Texas for a campaign appearance. The next day, November 22, Kennedy, along with his wife and Texas governor John Connally, rode through cheering crowds in downtown Dallas in a Lincoln Continental convertible. From an upstairs window of the Texas School Book Depository building, a 24-year-old warehouse worker named Lee Harvey Oswald, a former Marine with Soviet sympathies, fired upon the car, hitting the president twice. Kennedy died at Parkland Memorial Hospital shortly thereafter, at age 46.\n\nA Dallas nightclub owner named Jack Ruby assassinated Oswald days later while he was being transferred between jails. The death of President Kennedy was an unspeakable national tragedy, and to this date many people remember with unsettling vividness the exact moment they learned of his death. While conspiracy theories have swirled ever since Kennedy's assassination, the official version of events remains the most plausible: Oswald acted alone.\n\nFor few former presidents is the dichotomy between public and scholarly opinion so vast. To the American public, as well as his first historians, Kennedy is a hero \u2014 a visionary politician who, if not for his untimely death, might have averted the political and social turmoil of the late 1960s. In public-opinion polls, Kennedy consistently ranks with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln as among the most beloved American presidents of all time. Critiquing this outpouring of adoration, many more recent Kennedy scholars have derided Kennedy's womanizing and lack of personal morals and argued that as a leader he was more style than substance.\n\nIn the end, no one can ever truly know what type of president Kennedy would have become, or the different course history might have taken had he lived into old age. As historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. wrote, it was \"as if Lincoln had been killed six months after Gettysburg or Franklin Roosevelt at the end of 1935 or Truman before the Marshall Plan.\" The most enduring image of Kennedy's presidency, and of his whole life, is that of Camelot, the idyllic castle of the legendary King Arthur. As his wife Jackie Kennedy said after his death, \"There'll be great presidents again, and the Johnsons are wonderful, they've been wonderful to me \u2014 but there'll never be another Camelot again.\"\n\nRelease of Assassination Documents\n\nOn October 26, 2017, President Donald Trump ordered the release of 2,800 records related to the Kennedy assassination. The move came at the expiration of a 25-year waiting period signed into law in 1992, which allowed the declassification of the documents provided that doing so would not hurt intelligence, military operations or foreign relations.\n\nTrump's release of the documents came on the final day he was legally allowed to do so. However, he did not release all of the documents, as officials from the FBI, CIA and other agencies had successfully lobbied for the chance to review particularly sensitive material for an additional 180 days.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: John F.

Eisenhower presided over a United States that prized conformity over change. Although change naturally occurred, as it does in every era, it was slow and greeted warily. By the 1960s, however, the pace of change had quickened and its scope broadened, as restive and energetic waves of World War II veterans and baby boomers of both sexes and all ethnicities began to make their influence felt politically, economically, and culturally. No one symbolized the hopes and energies of the new decade more than John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the nation\u2019s new, young, and seemingly healthful, president. Kennedy had emphasized the country\u2019s aspirations and challenges as a \u201cnew frontier\u201d when accepting his party\u2019s nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, California.\n\nTHE NEW FRONTIER The son of Joseph P. Kennedy, a wealthy Boston business owner and former ambassador to Great Britain, John F. Kennedy graduated from Harvard University and went on to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1946. Even though he was young and inexperienced, his reputation as a war hero who had saved the crew of his PT boat after it was destroyed by the Japanese helped him to win election over more seasoned candidates, as did his father\u2019s fortune. In 1952, he was elected to the U.S. Senate for the first of two terms. For many, including Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., a historian and member of Kennedy\u2019s administration, Kennedy represented a bright, shining future in which the United States would lead the way in solving the most daunting problems facing the world. Kennedy\u2019s popular reputation as a great politician undoubtedly owes much to the style and attitude he personified. He and his wife Jacqueline conveyed a sense of optimism and youthfulness. \u201cJackie\u201d was an elegant first lady who wore designer dresses, served French food in the White House, and invited classical musicians to entertain at state functions. \u201cJack\u201d Kennedy, or JFK, went sailing off the coast of his family\u2019s Cape Cod estate and socialized with celebrities (Figure 29.3). Few knew that behind Kennedy\u2019s healthful and sporty image was a gravely ill man whose wartime injuries caused him daily agony. Figure 29.3 John F. Kennedy and first lady Jacqueline, shown here in the White House in 1962 (a) and watching the America\u2019s Cup race that same year (b), brought youth, glamour, and optimism to Washington, DC, and the nation. Nowhere was Kennedy\u2019s style more evident than in the first televised presidential debate held on September 23, 1960, between him and his Republican opponent Vice President Richard M. Nixon. Seventy million viewers watched the debate on television; millions more heard it on the radio. Radio listeners judged Nixon the winner, whereas those who watched the debate on television believed the more telegenic Kennedy made the better showing. Click and Explore View television footage of the first Kennedy-Nixon debate at the JFK Presidential Library and Museum. Kennedy did not appeal to all voters, however. Many feared that because he was Roman Catholic, his decisions would be influenced by the Pope. Even traditional Democratic supporters, like the head of the United Auto Workers, Walter Reuther, feared that a Catholic candidate would lose the support of Protestants. Many southern Democrats also disliked Kennedy because of his liberal position on civil rights. To shore up support for Kennedy in the South, Lyndon B. Johnson, the Protestant Texan who was Senate majority leader, was added to the Democratic ticket as the vice presidential candidate. In the end, Kennedy won the election by the closest margin since 1888, defeating Nixon with only 0.01 percent more of the record sixty-seven million votes cast. His victory in the Electoral College was greater: 303 electoral votes to Nixon\u2019s 219. Kennedy\u2019s win made him both the youngest man elected to the presidency and the first U.S. president born in the twentieth century. Kennedy dedicated his inaugural address to the theme of a new future for the United States. \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country,\u201d he challenged his fellow Americans. His lofty goals ranged from fighting poverty to winning the space race against the Soviet Union with a moon landing. He assembled an administration of energetic people assured of their ability to shape the future. Dean Rusk was named secretary of state. Robert McNamara, the former president of Ford Motor Company, became secretary of defense. Kennedy appointed his younger brother Robert as attorney general, much to the chagrin of many who viewed the appointment as a blatant example of nepotism. Kennedy\u2019s domestic reform plans remained hampered, however, by his narrow victory and lack of support from members of his own party, especially southern Democrats. As a result, he remained hesitant to propose new civil rights legislation. His achievements came primarily in poverty relief and care for the disabled. Unemployment benefits were expanded, the food stamps program was piloted, and the school lunch program was extended to more students. In October 1963, the passage of the Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act increased support for public mental health services.\n\nKENNEDY THE COLD WARRIOR Kennedy focused most of his energies on foreign policy, an arena in which he had been interested since his college years and in which, like all presidents, he was less constrained by the dictates of Congress. Kennedy, who had promised in his inaugural address to protect the interests of the \u201cfree world,\u201d engaged in Cold War politics on a variety of fronts. For example, in response to the lead that the Soviets had taken in the space race when Yuri Gagarin became the first human to successfully orbit the earth, Kennedy urged Congress to not only put a man into space (Figure 29.4) but also land an American on the moon, a goal finally accomplished in 1969. This investment advanced a variety of military technologies, especially the nation\u2019s long-range missile capability, resulting in numerous profitable spin-offs for the aviation and communication industries. It also funded a growing middle class of government workers, engineers, and defense contractors in states ranging from California to Texas to Florida\u2014a region that would come to be known as the Sun Belt\u2014becoming a symbol of American technological superiority. At the same time, however, the use of massive federal resources for space technologies did not change the economic outlook for low-income communities and underprivileged regions. Figure 29.4 On May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard became the first American to travel into space, as millions across the country watched the television coverage of his Mercury-Redstone mission, including Vice President Johnson, President Kennedy, and Jacqueline Kennedy in the White House. (credit: National Archives and Records Administration) To counter Soviet influence in the developing world, Kennedy supported a variety of measures. One of these was the Alliance for Progress, which collaborated with the governments of Latin American countries to promote economic growth and social stability in nations whose populations might find themselves drawn to communism. Kennedy also established the Agency for International Development to oversee the distribution of foreign aid, and he founded the Peace Corps, which recruited idealistic young people to undertake humanitarian projects in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. He hoped that by augmenting the food supply and improving healthcare and education, the U.S. government could encourage developing nations to align themselves with the United States and reject Soviet or Chinese overtures. The first group of Peace Corps volunteers departed for the four corners of the globe in 1961, serving as an instrument of \u201csoft power\u201d in the Cold War. Kennedy\u2019s various aid projects, like the Peace Corps, fit closely with his administration\u2019s flexible response, which Robert McNamara advocated as a better alternative to the all-or-nothing defensive strategy of mutually assured destruction favored during Eisenhower\u2019s presidency. The plan was to develop different strategies, tactics, and even military capabilities to respond more appropriately to small or medium-sized insurgencies, and political or diplomatic crises. One component of flexible response was the Green Berets, a U.S. Army Special Forces unit trained in counterinsurgency\u2014the military suppression of rebel and nationalist groups in foreign nations. Much of the Kennedy administration\u2019s new approach to defense, however, remained focused on the ability and willingness of the United States to wage both conventional and nuclear warfare, and Kennedy continued to call for increases in the American nuclear arsenal. Cuba Kennedy\u2019s multifaceted approach to national defense is exemplified by his careful handling of the Communist government of Fidel Castro in Cuba. In January 1959, following the overthrow of the corrupt and dictatorial regime of Fulgencio Batista, Castro assumed leadership of the new Cuban government. The progressive reforms he began indicated that he favored Communism, and his pro-Soviet foreign policy frightened the Eisenhower administration, which asked the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to find a way to remove him from power. Rather than have the U.S. military invade the small island nation, less than one hundred miles from Florida, and risk the world\u2019s criticism, the CIA instead trained a small force of Cuban exiles for the job. After landing at the Bay of Pigs on the Cuban coast, these insurgents, the CIA believed, would inspire their countrymen to rise up and topple Castro\u2019s regime. The United States also promised air support for the invasion. Kennedy agreed to support the previous administration\u2019s plans, and on April 17, 1961, approximately fourteen hundred Cuban exiles stormed ashore at the designated spot. However, Kennedy feared domestic criticism and worried about Soviet retaliation elsewhere in the world, such as Berlin. He cancelled the anticipated air support, which enabled the Cuban army to easily defeat the insurgents. The hoped-for uprising of the Cuban people also failed to occur. The surviving members of the exile army were taken into custody. The Bay of Pigs invasion was a major foreign policy disaster for President Kennedy. The event highlighted how difficult it would be for the United States to act against the Castro administration. The following year, the Soviet Union sent troops and technicians to Cuba to strengthen its new ally against further U.S. military plots. Then, on October 14, U.S. spy planes took aerial photographs that confirmed the presence of long-range ballistic missile sites in Cuba. The United States was now within easy reach of Soviet nuclear warheads (Figure 29.5). Figure 29.5 This low-level U.S. Navy photograph of San Cristobal, Cuba, clearly shows one of the sites built to launch intermediate-range missiles at the United States (a). As the date indicates, it was taken on the last day of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Following the crisis, Kennedy met with the reconnaissance pilots who flew the Cuban missions (b). credit a: modification of work by National Archives and Records Administration; credit b: modification of work by Central Intelligence Agency) On October 22, Kennedy demanded that Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev remove the missiles. He also ordered a naval quarantine placed around Cuba to prevent Soviet ships from approaching. Despite his use of the word \u201cquarantine\u201d instead of \u201cblockade,\u201d for a blockade was considered an act of war, a potential war with the Soviet Union was nevertheless on the president\u2019s mind. As U.S. ships headed for Cuba, the army was told to prepare for war, and Kennedy appeared on national television to declare his intention to defend the Western Hemisphere from Soviet aggression. The world held its breath awaiting the Soviet reply. Realizing how serious the United States was, Khrushchev sought a peaceful solution to the crisis, overruling those in his government who urged a harder stance. Behind the scenes, Robert Kennedy and Soviet ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin worked toward a compromise that would allow both superpowers to back down without either side\u2019s seeming intimidated by the other. On October 26, Khrushchev agreed to remove the Russian missiles in exchange for Kennedy\u2019s promise not to invade Cuba. On October 27, Kennedy\u2019s agreement was made public, and the crisis ended. Not made public, but nevertheless part of the agreement, was Kennedy\u2019s promise to remove U.S. warheads from Turkey, as close to Soviet targets as the Cuban missiles had been to American ones. The showdown between the United States and the Soviet Union over Cuba\u2019s missiles had put the world on the brink of a nuclear war. Both sides already had long-range bombers with nuclear weapons airborne or ready for launch, and were only hours away from the first strike. In the long run, this nearly catastrophic example of nuclear brinksmanship ended up making the world safer. A telephone \u201chot line\u201d was installed, linking Washington and Moscow to avert future crises, and in 1963, Kennedy and Khrushchev signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty, prohibiting tests of nuclear weapons in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Vietnam Cuba was not the only arena in which the United States sought to contain the advance of Communism. In Indochina, nationalist independence movements, most notably Vietnam\u2019s Viet Minh under the leadership of Ho Chi Minh, had strong Communist sympathies. President Harry S. Truman had no love for France\u2019s colonial regime in Southeast Asia but did not want to risk the loyalty of its Western European ally against the Soviet Union. In 1950, the Truman administration sent a small military advisory group to Vietnam and provided financial aid to help France defeat the Viet Minh. In 1954, Vietnamese forces finally defeated the French, and the country was temporarily divided at the seventeenth parallel. Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh controlled the North. In the South, the last Vietnamese emperor and ally to France, Bao Dai, named the French-educated, anti-Communist Ngo Dinh Diem as his prime minister. But Diem refused to abide by the Geneva Accords, the treaty ending the conflict that called for countrywide national elections in 1956, with the victor to rule a reunified nation. After a fraudulent election in the South in 1955, he ousted Bao Dai and proclaimed himself president of the Republic of Vietnam. He cancelled the 1956 elections in the South and began to round up Communists and supporters of Ho Chi Minh. Realizing that Diem would never agree to the reunification of the country under Ho Chi Minh\u2019s leadership, the North Vietnamese began efforts to overthrow the government of the South by encouraging insurgents to attack South Vietnamese officials. By 1960, North Vietnam had also created the National Liberation Front (NLF) to resist Diem and carry out an insurgency in the South. The United States, fearing the spread of Communism under Ho Chi Minh, supported Diem, assuming he would create a democratic, pro-Western government in South Vietnam. However, Diem\u2019s oppressive and corrupt government made him a very unpopular ruler, particularly with farmers, students, and Buddhists, and many in the South actively assisted the NLF and North Vietnam in trying to overthrow his government. When Kennedy took office, Diem\u2019s government was faltering. Continuing the policies of the Eisenhower administration, Kennedy supplied Diem with money and military advisors to prop up his government (Figure 29.6). By November 1963, there were sixteen thousand U.S. troops in Vietnam, training members of that country\u2019s special forces and flying air missions that dumped defoliant chemicals on the countryside to expose North Vietnamese and NLF forces and supply routes. A few weeks before Kennedy\u2019s own death, Diem and his brother Nhu were assassinated by South Vietnamese military officers after U.S. officials had indicated their support for a new regime. Figure 29.6 Following the French retreat from Indochina, the United States stepped in to prevent what it believed was a building Communist threat in the region. Under President Kennedy\u2019s leadership, the United States sent thousands of military advisors to Vietnam. (credit: Abbie Rowe)\n\nTENTATIVE STEPS TOWARD CIVIL RIGHTS Cold War concerns, which guided U.S. policy in Cuba and Vietnam, also motivated the Kennedy administration\u2019s steps toward racial equality. Realizing that legal segregation and widespread discrimination hurt the country\u2019s chances of gaining allies in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, the federal government increased efforts to secure the civil rights of African Americans in the 1960s. During his presidential campaign, Kennedy had intimated his support for civil rights, and his efforts to secure the release of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., who was arrested following a demonstration, won him the African American vote. Lacking widespread backing in Congress, however, and anxious not to offend White southerners, Kennedy was cautious in assisting African Americans in their fight for full citizenship rights. His strongest focus was on securing the voting rights of African Americans. Kennedy feared the loss of support from southern White Democrats and the impact a struggle over civil rights could have on his foreign policy agenda as well as on his reelection in 1964. But he thought voter registration drives far preferable to the boycotts, sit-ins, and integration marches that had generated such intense global media coverage in previous years. Encouraged by Congress\u2019s passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1960, which permitted federal courts to appoint referees to guarantee that qualified persons would be registered to vote, Kennedy focused on the passage of a constitutional amendment outlawing poll taxes, a tactic that southern states used to disenfranchise African American voters. Originally proposed by President Truman\u2019s Committee on Civil Rights, the idea had been largely forgotten during Eisenhower\u2019s time in office. Kennedy, however, revived it and convinced Spessard Holland, a conservative Florida senator, to introduce the proposed amendment in Congress. It passed both houses of Congress and was sent to the states for ratification in September 1962. Kennedy also reacted to the demands of the civil rights movement for equality in education. For example, when African American student James Meredith, encouraged by Kennedy\u2019s speeches, attempted to enroll at the segregated University of Mississippi in 1962, riots broke out on campus (Figure 29.7). The president responded by sending the U.S. Army and National Guard to Oxford, Mississippi, to support the U.S. Marshals that his brother Robert, the attorney general, had dispatched. Figure 29.7 Escorted by a U.S. marshal and the assistant attorney general for civil rights, James Meredith (center) enters the University of Mississippi over the riotous protests of White southerners. Meredith later attempted a \u201cMarch against Fear\u201d in 1966 to protest the inability of southern African Americans to vote. His walk ended when a passing motorist shot and wounded him. (credit: Library of Congress) Following similar violence at the University of Alabama when two African American students, Vivian Malone and James Hood, attempted to enroll in 1963, Kennedy responded with a bill that would give the federal government greater power to enforce school desegregation, prohibit segregation in public accommodations, and outlaw discrimination in employment. Kennedy would not live to see his bill enacted; it would become law during Lyndon Johnson\u2019s administration as the 1964 Civil Rights Act."}, {"url": "https://pressbooks-dev.oer.hawaii.edu/ushistory/chapter/the-kennedy-promise/", "page_content": "The Kennedy Promise OpenStaxCollege\n\n[latexpage]\n\nLearning Objectives By the end of this section, you will be able to: Assess Kennedy\u2019s Cold War strategy\n\nDescribe Kennedy\u2019s contribution to the civil rights movement\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 1950s, President Dwight D.

As U.S. ships headed for Cuba, the army was told to prepare for war, and Kennedy appeared on national television to declare his intention to defend the Western Hemisphere from Soviet aggression. The world held its breath awaiting the Soviet reply. Realizing how serious the United States was, Khrushchev sought a peaceful solution to the crisis, overruling those in his government who urged a harder stance. Behind the scenes, Robert Kennedy and Soviet ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin worked toward a compromise that would allow both superpowers to back down without either side\u2019s seeming intimidated by the other. On October 26, Khrushchev agreed to remove the Russian missiles in exchange for Kennedy\u2019s promise not to invade Cuba. On October 27, Kennedy\u2019s agreement was made public, and the crisis ended. Not made public, but nevertheless part of the agreement, was Kennedy\u2019s promise to remove U.S. warheads from Turkey, as close to Soviet targets as the Cuban missiles had been to American ones. The showdown between the United States and the Soviet Union over Cuba\u2019s missiles had put the world on the brink of a nuclear war. Both sides already had long-range bombers with nuclear weapons airborne or ready for launch, and were only hours away from the first strike. In the long run, this nearly catastrophic example of nuclear brinksmanship ended up making the world safer. A telephone \u201chot line\u201d was installed, linking Washington and Moscow to avert future crises, and in 1963, Kennedy and Khrushchev signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty, prohibiting tests of nuclear weapons in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Vietnam Cuba was not the only arena in which the United States sought to contain the advance of Communism. In Indochina, nationalist independence movements, most notably Vietnam\u2019s Viet Minh under the leadership of Ho Chi Minh, had strong Communist sympathies. President Harry S. Truman had no love for France\u2019s colonial regime in Southeast Asia but did not want to risk the loyalty of its Western European ally against the Soviet Union. In 1950, the Truman administration sent a small military advisory group to Vietnam and provided financial aid to help France defeat the Viet Minh. In 1954, Vietnamese forces finally defeated the French, and the country was temporarily divided at the seventeenth parallel. Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh controlled the North. In the South, the last Vietnamese emperor and ally to France, Bao Dai, named the French-educated, anti-Communist Ngo Dinh Diem as his prime minister. But Diem refused to abide by the Geneva Accords, the treaty ending the conflict that called for countrywide national elections in 1956, with the victor to rule a reunified nation. After a fraudulent election in the South in 1955, he ousted Bao Dai and proclaimed himself president of the Republic of Vietnam. He cancelled the 1956 elections in the South and began to round up Communists and supporters of Ho Chi Minh. Realizing that Diem would never agree to the reunification of the country under Ho Chi Minh\u2019s leadership, the North Vietnamese began efforts to overthrow the government of the South by encouraging insurgents to attack South Vietnamese officials. By 1960, North Vietnam had also created the National Liberation Front (NLF) to resist Diem and carry out an insurgency in the South. The United States, fearing the spread of Communism under Ho Chi Minh, supported Diem, assuming he would create a democratic, pro-Western government in South Vietnam. However, Diem\u2019s oppressive and corrupt government made him a very unpopular ruler, particularly with farmers, students, and Buddhists, and many in the South actively assisted the NLF and North Vietnam in trying to overthrow his government. When Kennedy took office, Diem\u2019s government was faltering. Continuing the policies of the Eisenhower administration, Kennedy supplied Diem with money and military advisors to prop up his government ([link]). By November 1963, there were sixteen thousand U.S. troops in Vietnam, training members of that country\u2019s special forces and flying air missions that dumped defoliant chemicals on the countryside to expose North Vietnamese and NLF forces and supply routes. A few weeks before Kennedy\u2019s own death, Diem and his brother Nhu were assassinated by South Vietnamese military officers after U.S. officials had indicated their support for a new regime. Following the French retreat from Indochina, the United States stepped in to prevent what it believed was a building Communist threat in the region. Under President Kennedy\u2019s leadership, the United States sent thousands of military advisors to Vietnam. (credit: Abbie Rowe)\n\n\n\nTENTATIVE STEPS TOWARD CIVIL RIGHTS Cold War concerns, which guided U.S. policy in Cuba and Vietnam, also motivated the Kennedy administration\u2019s steps toward racial equality. Realizing that legal segregation and widespread discrimination hurt the country\u2019s chances of gaining allies in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, the federal government increased efforts to secure the civil rights of African Americans in the 1960s. During his presidential campaign, Kennedy had intimated his support for civil rights, and his efforts to secure the release of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., who was arrested following a demonstration, won him the African American vote. Lacking widespread backing in Congress, however, and anxious not to offend white southerners, Kennedy was cautious in assisting African Americans in their fight for full citizenship rights. His strongest focus was on securing the voting rights of African Americans. Kennedy feared the loss of support from southern white Democrats and the impact a struggle over civil rights could have on his foreign policy agenda as well as on his reelection in 1964. But he thought voter registration drives far preferable to the boycotts, sit-ins, and integration marches that had generated such intense global media coverage in previous years. Encouraged by Congress\u2019s passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1960, which permitted federal courts to appoint referees to guarantee that qualified persons would be registered to vote, Kennedy focused on the passage of a constitutional amendment outlawing poll taxes, a tactic that southern states used to disenfranchise African American voters. Originally proposed by President Truman\u2019s Committee on Civil Rights, the idea had been largely forgotten during Eisenhower\u2019s time in office. Kennedy, however, revived it and convinced Spessard Holland, a conservative Florida senator, to introduce the proposed amendment in Congress. It passed both houses of Congress and was sent to the states for ratification in September 1962. Kennedy also reacted to the demands of the civil rights movement for equality in education. For example, when African American student James Meredith, encouraged by Kennedy\u2019s speeches, attempted to enroll at the segregated University of Mississippi in 1962, riots broke out on campus ([link]). The president responded by sending the U.S. Army and National Guard to Oxford, Mississippi, to support the U.S. Marshals that his brother Robert, the attorney general, had dispatched. Escorted by a U.S. marshal and the assistant attorney general for civil rights, James Meredith (center) enters the University of Mississippi over the riotous protests of white southerners. Meredith later attempted a \u201cMarch against Fear\u201d in 1966 to protest the inability of southern African Americans to vote. His walk ended when a passing motorist shot and wounded him. (credit: Library of Congress)\n\nFollowing similar violence at the University of Alabama when two African American students, Vivian Malone and James Hood, attempted to enroll in 1963, Kennedy responded with a bill that would give the federal government greater power to enforce school desegregation, prohibit segregation in public accommodations, and outlaw discrimination in employment. Kennedy would not live to see his bill enacted; it would become law during Lyndon Johnson\u2019s administration as the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n\nTRAGEDY IN DALLAS Although his stance on civil rights had won him support in the African American community and his steely performance during the Cuban Missile Crisis had led his overall popularity to surge, Kennedy understood that he had to solidify his base in the South to secure his reelection. On November 21, 1963, he accompanied Lyndon Johnson to Texas to rally his supporters. The next day, shots rang out as Kennedy\u2019s motorcade made its way through the streets of Dallas. Seriously injured, Kennedy was rushed to Parkland Hospital and pronounced dead. The gunfire that killed Kennedy appeared to come from the upper stories of the Texas School Book Depository building; later that day, Lee Harvey Oswald, an employee at the depository and a trained sniper, was arrested ([link]). Two days later, while being transferred from Dallas police headquarters to the county jail, Oswald was shot and killed by Jack Ruby, a local nightclub owner who claimed he acted to avenge the president. Lee Harvey Oswald (center) was arrested at the Texas Theatre in Dallas a few hours after shooting President Kennedy.\n\nAlmost immediately, rumors began to circulate regarding the Kennedy assassination, and conspiracy theorists, pointing to the unlikely coincidence of Oswald\u2019s murder a few days after Kennedy\u2019s, began to propose alternate theories about the events. To quiet the rumors and allay fears that the government was hiding evidence, Lyndon Johnson, Kennedy\u2019s successor, appointed a fact-finding commission headed by Earl Warren, chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, to examine all the evidence and render a verdict. The Warren Commission concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald had acted alone and there had been no conspiracy. The commission\u2019s ruling failed to satisfy many, and multiple theories have sprung up over time. No credible evidence has ever been uncovered, however, to prove either that someone other than Oswald murdered Kennedy or that Oswald acted with co-conspirators.\n\nSection Summary The arrival of the Kennedys in the White House seemed to signal a new age of youth, optimism, and confidence. Kennedy spoke of a \u201cnew frontier\u201d and promoted the expansion of programs to aid the poor, protect African Americans\u2019 right to vote, and improve African Americans\u2019 employment and education opportunities. For the most part, however, Kennedy focused on foreign policy and countering the threat of Communism\u2014especially in Cuba, where he successfully defused the Cuban Missile Crisis, and in Vietnam, to which he sent advisors and troops to support the South Vietnamese government. The tragedy of Kennedy\u2019s assassination in Dallas brought an early end to the era, leaving Americans to wonder whether his vice president and successor, Lyndon Johnson, would bring Kennedy\u2019s vision for the nation to fruition.\n\nReview Questions The term Kennedy chose to describe his sealing off of Cuba to prevent Soviet shipments of weapons or supplies was ________. interdiction quarantine isolation blockade B Kennedy proposed a constitutional amendment that would ________. provide healthcare for all Americans outlaw poll taxes make English the official language of the United States require all American men to register for the draft B What steps did Kennedy take to combat Communism?

After the Bay of Pigs invasion failed to overthrow the government of Fidel Castro, Kennedy demanded that the Soviet Union remove intermediate-range missiles from Cuba. He also increased support for the anti-Communist government in South Vietnam and sent advisors and troops to train the South Vietnamese army."}, {"url": "https://www.thefamouspeople.com/american-political-leaders.php", "page_content": "Famous American Political Leaders\n\nRight IconThis ranking is based on an algorithm that combines various factors, including the votes of our users and search trends on the internet.\n\nIs a career in politics a far-fetched thought for you?

Kennedy, in full Joseph Patrick Kennedy, (born September 6, 1888, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.\u2014died November 18, 1969, Hyannis Port, Massachusetts), American businessman and financier who served in government commissions in Washington, D.C. (1934\u201337), and as ambassador to Great Britain (1937\u201340). He was the father of U.S. Pres. John F. Kennedy and Senators Robert F. Kennedy and Ted Kennedy.\n\nJoseph Kennedy was the son of a Bay State politician and grandson of an Irish immigrant. In 1912 he graduated from Harvard University. Two years later he married Rose Fitzgerald, the daughter of John F. (\u201cHoney Fitz\u201d) Fitzgerald, mayor of Boston. Rose bore her husband nine children and taught them love, compassion, and serenity. From their father they acquired a fierce competitive drive and a yearning for distinction.\n\nKennedy was a freckled, vigorous man whose horn-rimmed spectacles gave him a slightly owlish look. He was a bank president at age 25 and a millionaire at 30. He became a shipbuilder, a motion-picture tycoon, and a heavy contributor to the Democratic Party; many have accused him of having also traded in bootleg liquor during Prohibition. In five years (1919\u201324) as manager of the stock division of Hayden, Stone and Company, an investment-banking firm, he mastered the art of stock-exchange manipulation. Striking out on his own, he became a brilliant plunger in the bull market of the 1920s. He retired early in 1929, having acquired enough capital to establish a million-dollar trust fund for each of his children. Then, as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (1934\u201335) under Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt, Kennedy outlawed the very speculative practices that had made him rich.\n\nKennedy became chairman of the United States Maritime Commission and, in 1937, the first Irish American to serve as the U.S. ambassador to Great Britain. In November 1940 he resigned; he was convinced that Britain was doomed to Nazi conquest and believed America\u2019s only hope lay in isolationism.\n\nBy then, Kennedy\u2019s family was complete, with four sons\u2014Joseph P., Jr., John F., Robert F., Edward M. (Ted)\u2014and five daughters\u2014Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, and Jean. Prodded by their parents, the children were competitive and cohesive. They vied with one another in sailboat races, touch football games, tennis matches, and rough-and-tumble fights.\n\nBut Kennedy was not trying to breed professional athletes. He expected his sons to prepare for public life and his daughters to be ready for marriage to distinguished men who would become \u201cnaturalized\u201d Kennedys. The children were encouraged to read The New York Times at an early age, and small talk was not allowed at the dinner table. Instead, the family discussed national issues, sometimes with consequences not seen until years later. Joseph, Jr., for example, became an isolationist and John an ardent advocate of U.S. participation in world affairs; Robert, perhaps because of the age gap, became shy\u2014an affliction he battled throughout his life.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

In 1944 she married an Englishman, William Cavendish, marquess of Hartington; that same year Hartington was killed during the Allied invasion of Normandy. Four years later she herself died in a European plane crash. Joseph Kennedy had expected his eldest son to be the first Kennedy to run for public office, but young Joe was killed too, in 1944, during the war. Thus, the family\u2019s political standard passed to the next eldest son, John, who had planned to pursue an academic or journalistic career. John F. Kennedy served as U.S. president for 1,037 days before being assassinated in 1963; the role played by Joseph Kennedy in his son\u2019s narrow victory over Richard Nixon for the presidency in 1960 has long been a subject of controversy. Robert F. Kennedy, who served as U.S. attorney general and as senator from New York, announced his candidacy for the presidency in mid-March 1968, but he too was assassinated, less than three months later.\n\nJoseph Kennedy was invalided in Hyannis Port by a stroke for several years and died at age 81.

Kennedy, in full Robert Francis Kennedy, (born November 20, 1925, Brookline, Massachusetts, U.S.\u2014died June 6, 1968, Los Angeles, California), U.S. attorney general and adviser during the administration of his brother Pres. John F. Kennedy (1961\u201363) and later a U.S. senator (1965\u201368). He was son of Rose and Joseph P. Kennedy. He was assassinated while campaigning for the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nomination in 1968.\n\nRobert interrupted his studies at Harvard University to serve in the U.S. Navy during World War II but returned to the university and graduated in 1948. After receiving a law degree from the University of Virginia Law School in 1951, he began his political career in Massachusetts the next year with the management of his brother John\u2019s successful campaign for the U.S. Senate. Robert first came into national prominence in 1953, when he was an assistant counsel to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, headed by Joseph R. McCarthy (he resigned in mid-1953 but returned in 1954 as counsel to the Democratic minority). In 1957 he was chief counsel to the Senate select committee conducting investigations into labour racketeering, which led to his long-standing feud with James R. Hoffa of the Teamsters Union. Kennedy resigned from the committee staff in 1960 to conduct his brother\u2019s campaign for the U.S. presidency. After John won the election, he appointed (1961) Robert attorney general in his cabinet.\n\nMore From Britannica Sirhan Sirhan\n\nOn November 22, 1963, the president was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Kennedy continued to serve as attorney general until he resigned in September 1964. The months after his brother\u2019s death were a desperate time for him. He was stooped by grief and spent long periods staring out windows or walking in the Virginia woods. He had presided over the Department of Justice for 44 months. He had emerged as a statesman of the law, improving the lot of many. Learning on May 20, 1961, that a hostile mob threatened the civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., and about 1,200 of his supporters in Montgomery, Alabama, Kennedy sent 400 federal marshals to protect them. In subsequent racial crises he used long telephone sessions to work out the strategies of peace officers in the South. He also led a tough and imaginative drive against organized crime. One of his proudest achievements was assembling the evidence that convicted Hoffa. On Kennedy\u2019s departure from the Department of Justice, The New York Times, which had criticized his appointment three years earlier, said editorially,\n\nHe named excellent men to most key posts, put new vigor into protecting civil rights through administrative action, played a pivotal role in shaping the most comprehensive civil rights law in this century\u2026. Mr. Kennedy has done much to elevate the standard.\n\nHe was the author of The Enemy Within (1960), Just Friends and Brave Enemies (1962), and Pursuit of Justice (1964).\n\nIn November 1964 he was elected U.S. senator from New York. Within two years Kennedy had established himself as a major political figure in his own right. He became the chief spokesman for liberal Democrats and a critic of Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s Vietnam policy. On March 16, 1968, he announced his candidacy for the presidency. By June 4 he had won five out of six presidential primaries, including one that day in California. Shortly after midnight on June 5 he spoke to his followers in Los Angeles\u2019 Ambassador Hotel. As he left through a kitchen hallway, he was fatally wounded by a Palestinian immigrant, Sirhan Bishara Sirhan.

Kennedy narrowly defeated Republican Vice Pres. Richard M. Nixon . Kennedy thus became the first Roman Catholic and the youngest person ever elected president . Kennedy was also the first president born in the 20th century.\n\nKennedy and Humphrey were the only major Democratic contenders to enter presidential primaries in 1960. Their first significant primary was in Wisconsin in April. Both Humphrey and Kennedy campaigned energetically in that state, which borders Humphrey\u2019s home state of Minnesota. Kennedy won easily and was especially strong in Milwaukee and other areas where there were large numbers of Catholic voters. A month later Kennedy all but eliminated Humphrey from consideration by defeating him in West Virginia, a heavily Protestant state, proving that he could win in a state with few Catholics.\n\nThroughout the primaries and the fall campaign, Kennedy\u2019s religion was a dominant issue. He would become only the second Roman Catholic ever to be nominated for president by a major party (the first was Democratic Gov. Al Smith of New York, who lost to Herbert Hoover in 1928 ). Some Protestant ministers and prominent laymen expressed fears that a Catholic president would be under the domination of the pope and would not always be free to act in the best interests of the country, charges which Kennedy denied.\n\nOn the Republican side there was little doubt that their nominee would be Nixon. Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York , who had indicated late in 1959 that he might seek the Republican nomination , withdrew in late December in the face of almost total opposition by Republican Party leaders. Nixon entered some of the primaries, but only to demonstrate his vote-getting abilities. He never faced any serious opposition.\n\nThe Republican platform promised to continue and to improve upon the programs of the Eisenhower administration. Although there were some signs of dissatisfaction with the administration because of its failure to pursue aggressive action in such as areas as military programs, aid to depressed areas, and space exploration , it was generally agreed that Eisenhower\u2019s prestige was as high as it had ever been and that the president\u2019s support was a distinct advantage to Nixon.\n\nKennedy went to the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles , held July 11\u201315, 1960, as the front-runner for the nomination, with some 600 delegates of the 761 needed for nomination secured. Johnson, however, hoped to wrest the nomination from Kennedy. Nevertheless, Kennedy won the nomination on the first ballot, with 806 votes. Kennedy then surprised most of his supporters by picking Johnson as his vice presidential running mate. The selection was generally interpreted as a move to hold the South, where opposition to Kennedy\u2019s religion was strong and where the traditional Democratic leanings of the voters were changing. The party platform adopted at Los Angeles promised to expand the country\u2019s defense and foreign aid programs. It also committed the Democratic Party, controversially, to civil rights . In his acceptance speech, Kennedy said the American people needed to be prepared to sacrifice in the years ahead. There were, he said, stimulating \u201cnew frontiers\u201d to be crossed by the United States .\n\nThe general election campaign\n\nPresidential posturing began in earnest when the U.S. Congress reconvened in August, after the political conventions had been concluded. Both nominees were principal figures in the session, which was held in a politically charged atmosphere. As vice president, Nixon presided over the Senate. He also was a key figure in determining Republican strategy in a Congress that was controlled by the Democrats. As a senator from Massachusetts and as an author of the minimum-wage bill that was one of the principal measures to be acted upon during the session, Kennedy had an important stake in seeing to it that the achievements of the session were substantial.\n\nThe legislative achievements of Congress were mixed, but, by the time the traditional presidential campaign season kicked off on Labor Day in September, Nixon\u2019s and Kennedy\u2019s responsibilities in Congress were all but forgotten. At the time, the presidential campaign was the longest and the most intensive ever held in the United States. Crisscrossing the country on planes, trains, automobiles, and buses, Nixon and Kennedy were speaking, shaking hands, and conferring with politicians from coast to coast for most of September, for all of October, and for the seven days of November preceding the election.\n\nKennedy tackled the election issue of his Catholicism in a speech to a group of Protestant ministers in Houston. In that speech, on September 12, he declared:\n\nI believe in an America that is officially neither Catholic, Protestant nor Jewish\u2014where no public official either requests or accepts instructions on public policy from the Pope, the National Council of Churches or any other ecclesiastical source\u2014where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials\u2014and where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated as an act against all.\n\nAn unprecedented series of four television debates between the two nominees constituted the highlight of the campaign. A provision of the Federal Communications Act had been suspended by Congress earlier in the year to permit the networks to broadcast the debates without having to provide equal time for candidates of minor parties. Although the debates were sometimes compared to the historic debates between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas (see also Lincoln-Douglas debates), they were more in the nature of joint press conferences, with reporters asking questions. They did, however, provide voters with an opportunity to compare the two candidates. Although Nixon showed a mastery of the issues, it is generally agreed that Kennedy, with his relaxed and self-confident manner, as well as his good looks (in contrast to Nixon\u2019s \u201cfive o\u2019clock shadow\u201d), benefited the most from the exchanges. An estimated 85\u2013120 million Americans watched one or more of the debates.\n\nKennedy and Nixon both used set speeches in their public appearances. Kennedy said that the United States was falling behind the Soviet Union in the race for world supremacy and that the United States must \u201cdo better.\u201d He pointed to the regime of Fidel Castro in Cuba\u2014\u201cjust ten minutes by jet from the United States.\u201d Kennedy also stressed the need for programs to deal with unemployment in chronically depressed areas and for more rapid U.S. economic growth. Nixon, the first presidential nominee to campaign in every state, emphasized that he would carry on the basic policies of the Eisenhower administration, but he also indicated that he would improve upon them in such areas as welfare programs, foreign aid, and defense. Eisenhower, who went on a \u201cnonpolitical\u201d inspection tour of the country in mid-October, took an active part in the last week of the campaign, when Eisenhower and Nixon appeared together in New York City. Until then, however, the president had seemed to stay in the background.\n\nWhen voters went to cast their ballots on November 7, the contest was close. In the electoral college, Kennedy captured 303 votes (34 more than was required to win), while Nixon won 219. The 14 unpledged electors in Alabama and Mississippi and 1 pledged elector in Oklahoma cast their votes for Sen. Harry F. Byrd, a Democrat from Virginia. Kennedy eked out a narrow victory in the popular vote, defeating Nixon by just under 117,000 votes. Overall, Kennedy won 49.7 percent to Nixon\u2019s 49.5 percent. Kennedy thus became the third person elected president in the 20th century without winning a majority of the popular vote (joining Woodrow Wilson in 1912 and Harry S. Truman in 1948; in 1968 Nixon would become the fourth person in the 20th century to win the presidency without a majority). The popular vote was the closest since 1884, when Democrat Grover Cleveland defeated Republican James G. Blaine by only about 24,000 votes.\n\nCiting voting irregularities in Illinois and Texas, many observers questioned whether Kennedy had legally won those states, and some prominent Republicans\u2014including Eisenhower\u2014even urged Nixon to contest the results. He chose not to, however, declaring:\n\nI could think of no worse example for nations abroad, who for the first time were trying to put free electoral procedures into effect, than that of the United States wrangling over the results of our presidential election, and even suggesting that the presidency itself could be stolen by thievery at the ballot box.\n\nNixon\u2019s supporters and critics alike, both then and later, praised him for the dignity and unselfishness with which he handled defeat and the suspicion that vote fraud had cost him the presidency.\n\nFor the results of the previous election, see United States presidential election of 1956.

A Democrat, Kennedy represented Massachusetts in both houses of the U.S. Congress prior to his presidency.\n\nKennedy was born into a wealthy, political family in Brookline, Massachusetts. He graduated from Harvard University in 1940 before joining the U.S. Naval Reserve the following year. During World War II, he commanded a series of PT boats in the Pacific theater and earned the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his service and war heroism. After a brief stint in journalism, Kennedy represented a working-class Boston district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1947 to 1953. He was subsequently elected to the U.S. Senate and served as the junior senator for Massachusetts from 1953 to 1960. While in the Senate, Kennedy published his book, Profiles in Courage, which won a Pulitzer Prize.\n\nShow less Read more Wikipedia"}, {"url": "https://www.ranker.com/list/all-us-presidential-portraits/steve-wright", "page_content": "You may not realize it, but there are official portraits of every US president. This tradition started with George Washington and has continued into modern times, even with the advent of photography. These official paintings of US presidents have not always been the most attractive or dynamic images you will ever see, but all of the US president portraits were commissioned from the best artists of their day and provide a unique insight into each leader.\n\nWhen you look through this list of portraits of American presidents, some trends become immediately obvious. In the early paintings, with the ironic exception of Washington himself, the presidents are often painted from the bust up in the classic European portrait style. As the years have gone on, however, all the US president portraits have developed and turned more into works of art than straight depictions.\n\nThe best US presidential portraits capture the president as you remember them. Some are iconic, like John F. Kennedy's portrait, while others are seriously weird (is that really what Andrew Jackson looked like? Yikes.)

Kennedy resigned the seat to become President of the United States after winning the presidential election in 1960. Benjamin A. Smith II, a Kennedy family friend, was appointed to succeed Kennedy, serving as a placeholder for Edward M. \"Ted\" Kennedy, who at the time was too young to be constitutionally eligible for the seat.[1]\n\nTed Kennedy first faced a Democratic Party primary challenge from Edward J. \"Eddie\" McCormack, Jr., the state Attorney General. Kennedy's slogan was \"He can do more for Massachusetts\", the same one John had used in his first campaign for the seat ten years earlier.[2] McCormack had the support of many liberals and intellectuals, who thought Kennedy inexperienced (\"I back Jack but Teddy ain't ready\") and knew of his suspension from Harvard, a fact which subsequently became public during the race.[3] Kennedy also faced the notion that with one brother President and another U.S. Attorney General, \"Don't you think that Teddy is one Kennedy too many?\"[1] But Kennedy proved to be an effective street-level campaigner.[1] In a televised debate, McCormack said \"The office of United States senator should be merited, and not inherited,\" and said that if his opponent's name was Edward Moore rather than Edward Moore Kennedy, his candidacy \"would be a joke.\"[3] Voters thought McCormack's performance overbearing; combined with the family political machine's finally getting fully behind him, Kennedy won the September 1962 primary by a two-to-one margin.[1]\n\nIn the Republican primary, George C. Lodge, a former member of the Eisenhower administration and the son of Henry Cabot Lodge, defeated Representative Laurence Curtis (MA-10). Harvard historian H. Stuart Hughes also ran for the Senate seat as an independent peace candidate. [4]\n\nIn the November special election, Kennedy defeated Lodge, whose father had lost this seat to then-Representative John F. Kennedy in 1952. In winning, Kennedy gained 55 percent of the vote.[1][5]\n\nResults\n\nPrimaries\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nDemocratic primary for the United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 1962 Party Candidate Votes % \u00b1% Majority Turnout\n\nRepublican primary for the United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 1962 [4] Party Candidate Votes % \u00b1%\n\nGeneral election\n\nUnited States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 1962 Party Candidate Votes % \u00b1% Majority Turnout Democratic hold\n\nReferences"}, {"url": "https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/5/27/commencement-2020-kennedy/", "page_content": "At Harvard, it is not uncommon to hear speculation about who could someday be bound for the White House. When former President John F. Kennedy \u201940 arrived at the College in 1936, however, few would have made such a prediction.\n\nBut eighty years later, JFK\u2019s political dynasty is still alive at the school that helped spur it \u2014 thanks, in part, to a family-University relationship unlike any other.\n\nHarvard\u2019s relationship with the Kennedys is one that has lasted more than four generations, transcended traditional boundaries, endured turbulence, and ultimately proven mutually prosperous. It has helped create a political dynasty that has produced a United States president, numerous influential members of Congress, and one of the country\u2019s most prominent schools of government.\n\nToday, a new generation of Kennedys maintains the mantle of the family legacy, as well as its relationship with the school that helped to build it.\n\nAs U.S. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.) makes an audacious run for the U.S. Senate in Massachusetts, arousing memories of Camelot for many, the Kennedy family political legacy \u2014 one that has never lost when on the ballot in the Bay State \u2014 is at a crossroads. And with former U.S. ambassador Caroline B. Kennedy \u201980\u2019s headline-grabbing departure from the Harvard Institute of Politics Senior Advisory Committee, the family\u2019s involvement with the University, too, stands at an important juncture.\n\n\u2018THE RULING CLASS\u2019\n\nThe Kennedys are not the first bloodline to have produced many prominent Harvard graduates. But since Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. graduated from the College in 1912, the family and the school have held a unique, mutually beneficial relationship that has had lasting implications on the family\u2019s political pursuits and the University\u2019s growth.\n\nAfter gaining prominence in business and politics, Kennedy Sr. raised his nine children \u2014 in particular, the four boys \u2014 with exceedingly high expectations.\n\nHis sons \u2014 Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. \u201938, John F. Kennedy \u201940, Robert F. Kennedy \u201948, and Edward M. \u201cTed\u201d Kennedy \u201954-\u201956 \u2014 all went on to follow in his footsteps by attending the University.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Kennedys kind of became part of the ruling class at this time,\u201d said Thomas J. Whalen, a professor at Boston University who has studied the family. \u201cBut an institution like Harvard allowed them to stay in that\u2026 to kind of pass on these connections to their children. That\u2019s how an elite survives.\u201d\n\nBy Camille G. Caldera It was the eldest of the Kennedy clan who many expected to gain political prominence even from a young age. But following his death in a plane crash in World War II, the political legacy was left to his brothers to fulfill. John F. Kennedy, the next oldest of the brothers, entered Harvard with a high school transcript riddled with Cs and Ds. As a freshman living in Weld Hall, Kennedy worked harder to succeed on various Harvard athletic teams than he did at academics: He earned a spot on the swim team, though he left little impression on the coaches. In his sophomore year, after moving into Winthrop House, Kennedy joined the Spee Club, the Hasty Pudding, and The Crimson, where he served as a business editor. JFK\u2019s brothers, Bobby and Ted, both attended Harvard after him. They, too, were exceedingly focused on athletics during their undergraduate years, earning varsity football letters. \u201cBeing an athlete was like the other kinds of pressure in their life,\u201d said Larry Tye, a Robert Kennedy biographer. \u201cThere was an expectation that they would compete. There was an expectation that the only thing worthy, in terms of the way you competed, was if you won.\u201d \u201cThis was Joe Kennedy\u2019s metaphor for what life ought to be like generally,\u201d Tye said. \u201cYou had to win things, whether it was competing in a football game or competing in a political campaign.\u201d After graduating Harvard, serving in World War II, and working briefly as a newspaper reporter, JFK went on to run for Congress in 1946 with strong support from his father. He spent six years in the House before being elected to the Senate twice, and made the leap to run for president in 1960. Whalen said Harvard played a crucial role in JFK\u2019s entry into politics. \u201cJohn Kennedy certainly spent his entire life drawing on those connections,\u201d he said. Advertisement When Kennedy was elected to the White House, he brought Harvard with him. He tapped numerous academics to serve in his administration, including National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy, Ambassador to India John Kenneth Galbraith, Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara, and advisor Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. \u201938. \u201cThe joke at the time in 1961 was: How do you get to Washington? Well, you go to Harvard Square and turn left,\u201d said former U.S. Representative Barnett \u201cBarney\u201d Frank \u201961-\u201962 (D-Mass.). Harvard became a part of the fabric of Kennedy\u2019s White House.

Following his death, a group of JFK\u2019s closest allies, including his two brothers, began working on plans to memorialize him, albeit far sooner than they expected. The group settled on the creation of a presidential library that would house a museum and his presidential archives. They also debated proposals to create a memorial of Kennedy that would have an ongoing impact on students. The discussions ultimately led to Harvard\u2019s Graduate School of Public Administration becoming the John F. Kennedy School of Government, and to the founding of the Institute of Politics. The creation of the Kennedy Library \u2014 which was originally supposed to be part of a complex designed by architect I.M. Pei that would house the Kennedy School, the IOP, and several academic departments \u2014 was hampered by years of controversy and anger among some Cambridge residents. Community members raised concerns over the influx of tourism a museum would bring to the area. \u201cIt was a brawl,\u201d said Dan H.

Some residents advocated to keep the archives housed at Harvard but move the museum elsewhere \u2014 a proposal Fenn, a former Crimson president, opposed. Eventually, when building the museum and the archive together in Cambridge became unfeasible, the family gave up on housing the memorial in Harvard Square. In 1979, the library opened on Columbia Point in Dorchester, alongside the archives and museum. The IOP, which was also mired in controversy in its early days, became the Kennedy family\u2019s chief point of engagement with the University. Jacqueline L. \u201cJackie\u201d Kennedy Onassis, JFK\u2019s widow, sat on the Institute\u2019s inaugural Senior Advisory Committee. Advertisement Ted Kennedy, who served in the U.S. Senate from 1962 until his death in 2009, also joined the Senior Advisory Committee shortly after its inception and became its most influential member. Committee members said Ted Kennedy never missed a meeting during his time on the committee, which gathers several times per year. \u201cHe was the leading steward of the family,\u201d longtime IOP Advisory Committee member Heather P. Campion said. \u201cHe built the Senior Advisory Committee.\u201d Beyond his engagement with the committee, Ted Kennedy also leaned heavily on Harvard affiliates in his policy work as a senator, according to Scott Ferson, who worked for Kennedy in the \u201990s. \u201cFor his legislative work \u2014 and for the work he did on health care, education, justice reform, immigration \u2014 he very much relied on the experts at Harvard,\u201d Ferson said. \u201cThe staff lists from his entirety in the Senate is littered with Harvard degrees.\u201d The rapid growth of the Kennedy School under former Dean Graham T. Allison Jr. \u201962 in the 1970s and 1980s created conflict between the family and the University at times. Allison found that the Kennedy name hindered fundraising efforts, according to a 1989 New York Times Magazine story about HKS. In printed materials from 1981, for instance, the school abbreviated its name as \u201cHSG,\u201d for the Harvard School of Government, instead of \u201cKSG,\u201d the acronym normally used at the time to refer to the school. \u201cIn any productive relationship,\u201d Ted Kennedy told the Times in 1989, \u201cyou\u2019re going to have these blips. I still have some criticisms. I\u2019d like to see them pay less attention to techniques, more to the values of public life. But I\u2019m proud to have our name on the school and I think my brother would have been too.\u201d \u2018TRADITION\u2019 Though the Kennedy family has always maintained strong ties to the IOP, this year brought significant change to the Institute\u2019s Advisory Committee leadership. In February, the Advisory Committee saw a major shakeup as Caroline B. Kennedy \u201980, JFK\u2019s daughter, and Kenneth M. Duberstein stepped down as its honorary chairs. Joe Kennedy III is now the only member of the Kennedy family who is officially involved with the IOP. Advertisement Caroline Kennedy \u2014 who served as U.S. Ambassador to Japan under President Barack Obama \u2014 took on a bigger role on the Advisory Committee following the death of her brother, John F. Kennedy Jr. JFK Jr. had worked closely with Campion on improving the forum, which was dedicated to him in 2003, four years after he was killed in a plane crash. \u201cAs an undergrad and just after I graduated, I attended a lot of meetings with my mother and my uncle, and then with John as he became very engaged and really sort of gave the IOP \u2014 and the forum in particular \u2014 a real burst of energy through his involvement,\u201d Caroline Kennedy said in an interview with The Crimson. \u201cAfter he died, I started becoming more engaged with my uncle Teddy,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd then after he died I\u2019ve continued to stay engaged and work hard to make sure the IOP stays true to its spirit and mission.\u201d Caroline Kennedy declined to comment on the specific reasons for her departure. \u201cMy goal is to make sure the IOP stays true to its founding ideals and mission and is inspirational and innovative, nimble and dedicated to public service, and committed to undergraduates primarily,\u201d she said. Asked if she would consider rejoining the board in the future, however, she left the door open to the possibility. \u201cI need to make sure that I can do what I just said, or that everybody is committed to that same set of ideals,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then I would be thrilled to come back.\u201d The Washington Post reported in February that Caroline Kennedy clashed with Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf, and that she and other committee members felt he micromanaged the IOP. \u201cThere were issues between her and school officials over the role of the Senior Advisory Committee and over her role at the IOP and just the structure,\u201d Advisory Committee member Richard L. Berke said in an interview with The Crimson. \u201cIt is critically important that Caroline be a central figure in the leadership of the IOP,\u201d Berke said. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that the Harvard administration will go all out to try to get her back.\u201d Advertisement IOP Director Mark D. Gearan \u201978 said in an interview that he, too, hopes to get Caroline Kennedy back on the committee. \u201cShe has been so constructively engaged with our students and so helpful to the Institute of Politics,\u201d Gearan, a former Crimson editor, said. \u201cIt would be very helpful to continue her engagement and her passion for the Kennedy School, for Harvard, and for the Institute. That would be, certainly, my hope.\u201d \u2018SOMETHING A BIT NEW\u2019 Today, the Kennedy legacy is back on the ballot in Massachusetts. The only Kennedy currently holding public office in the state, Joe Kennedy III, is challenging U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a closely-watched primary. Tye, the Robert Kennedy biographer, said the young Kennedy\u2019s brand of politics is reminiscent of his grandfather\u2019s. \u201cI would say that Joe III, in lots of ways, is the closest thing the Kennedys have come to producing another Bobby Kennedy since Bobby Kennedy,\u201d Tye said. Robert Kennedy served in the Senate from New York and as his brother\u2019s attorney general before being killed while running for president in 1968. Following his high school days at the Buckingham Browne & Nichols School in Cambridge, Joe Kennedy III did not follow the family tradition of attending Harvard and instead matriculated at Stanford as an undergraduate. \u201cTo have family members of mine that were alumni [at Harvard] was a great source of pride for me,\u201d Kennedy said in an interview with The Crimson. Advertisement \u201cI, for a variety of reasons, having grown up basically in its backyard and having a family that had pretty deep roots in Massachusetts, just wanted to go some place a bit new, and try something a bit new,\u201d he added. United States Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.) is challenging Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a tight race for a Massachusetts Senate seat. By Allison G. Lee After his undergraduate years and a stint in the Peace Corps, Kennedy returned to Cambridge for law school at Harvard. Harvard Law School classmates described Kennedy as friendly but low-key, and as a talented quarterback in the flag football league. \u201cHe was friends with pretty much everyone in our section,\u201d said Patrick T. Childress, one of Kennedy\u2019s Law School section mates. \u201cHe was always just very relatable and friendly.\u201d Childress, who was friends with Kennedy, said Kennedy didn\u2019t express plans to run for office during his time at the Law School. But after several years working as a prosecutor, Kennedy won a U.S. House seat in Massachusetts\u2019s Fourth Congressional District. With his Harvard degree, famous surname, and progressive politics, Joe Kennedy III seems to have many of the same tools his grandfather and great-uncles did. His very appeal in the state still rests, in some part, upon his claim to familial fame. Nicholas Karnovsky \u201919, a 2016 IOP Director\u2019s Intern in Kennedy\u2019s district office, said that legacy \u201cwas definitely part of the appeal\u201d of his position. \u201cWhile when I interned with him back in 2016, he was still a fairly new congressman, it was pretty clear, to me at least, that he was going somewhere,\u201d Karnovsky said. \u201cHe\u2019s the type of person you want to attach your anchor to.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not at all surprised that he\u2019s running for the Senate now, given just his accomplishments and his credentials. I think the Senate is step two, who knows what step three might be,\u201d he added. \u201cThat was certainly why I was interested.\u201d Advertisement United States Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.) visited the Harvard Institute of Politics in October 2019 to discuss his U.S. Senate campaign. By Steve S. Li Like many of his family members, Kennedy has, too, reaped the rewards of Harvard connections. His introduction of U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), his former Law School professor, at the Democratic National Convention put him in the national spotlight in 2016. Kennedy, who has long been the beacon of establishment politics in the Bay State, has tried to distinguish himself \u2014 but hasn\u2019t shied away from his family\u2019s reputation in doing so. \u201cI think the lesson that I take from my family\u2019s participation in public life has been one that has not been afraid to challenge the structures and institutions of our society to, in fact, be bigger, dream bolder, and deliver more,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that\u2019s what politics is supposed to do.\u201d \u201cThe role of people in it is not to work your way into an establishment platform and then enjoy the comforts that are provided by it, but to recognize that if that establishment is in fact going to deliver on the promises that we make to our people, then that establishment needs to be constantly be pushed and to constantly be driven to be more and to focus even more deliberately in the ways in which we fall short,\u201d he added. Asked if, in his current race, his family legacy and Harvard background are an asset or a burden, Kennedy didn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cWithout question, I\u2019m proud of both,\u201d he said. \u2014Staff writer Jasper G.

The only Kennedy currently holding public office in the state, Joe Kennedy III, is challenging U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a closely-watched primary. Tye, the Robert Kennedy biographer, said the young Kennedy\u2019s brand of politics is reminiscent of his grandfather\u2019s. \u201cI would say that Joe III, in lots of ways, is the closest thing the Kennedys have come to producing another Bobby Kennedy since Bobby Kennedy,\u201d Tye said. Robert Kennedy served in the Senate from New York and as his brother\u2019s attorney general before being killed while running for president in 1968. Following his high school days at the Buckingham Browne & Nichols School in Cambridge, Joe Kennedy III did not follow the family tradition of attending Harvard and instead matriculated at Stanford as an undergraduate. \u201cTo have family members of mine that were alumni [at Harvard] was a great source of pride for me,\u201d Kennedy said in an interview with The Crimson.

United States Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.) is challenging Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a tight race for a Massachusetts Senate seat. By Allison G. Lee After his undergraduate years and a stint in the Peace Corps, Kennedy returned to Cambridge for law school at Harvard. Harvard Law School classmates described Kennedy as friendly but low-key, and as a talented quarterback in the flag football league. \u201cHe was friends with pretty much everyone in our section,\u201d said Patrick T. Childress, one of Kennedy\u2019s Law School section mates. \u201cHe was always just very relatable and friendly.\u201d Childress, who was friends with Kennedy, said Kennedy didn\u2019t express plans to run for office during his time at the Law School. But after several years working as a prosecutor, Kennedy won a U.S. House seat in Massachusetts\u2019s Fourth Congressional District. With his Harvard degree, famous surname, and progressive politics, Joe Kennedy III seems to have many of the same tools his grandfather and great-uncles did. His very appeal in the state still rests, in some part, upon his claim to familial fame. Nicholas Karnovsky \u201919, a 2016 IOP Director\u2019s Intern in Kennedy\u2019s district office, said that legacy \u201cwas definitely part of the appeal\u201d of his position. \u201cWhile when I interned with him back in 2016, he was still a fairly new congressman, it was pretty clear, to me at least, that he was going somewhere,\u201d Karnovsky said. \u201cHe\u2019s the type of person you want to attach your anchor to.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not at all surprised that he\u2019s running for the Senate now, given just his accomplishments and his credentials. I think the Senate is step two, who knows what step three might be,\u201d he added. \u201cThat was certainly why I was interested.\u201d Advertisement United States Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.) visited the Harvard Institute of Politics in October 2019 to discuss his U.S. Senate campaign. By Steve S.

His introduction of U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), his former Law School professor, at the Democratic National Convention put him in the national spotlight in 2016. Kennedy, who has long been the beacon of establishment politics in the Bay State, has tried to distinguish himself \u2014 but hasn\u2019t shied away from his family\u2019s reputation in doing so. \u201cI think the lesson that I take from my family\u2019s participation in public life has been one that has not been afraid to challenge the structures and institutions of our society to, in fact, be bigger, dream bolder, and deliver more,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that\u2019s what politics is supposed to do.\u201d \u201cThe role of people in it is not to work your way into an establishment platform and then enjoy the comforts that are provided by it, but to recognize that if that establishment is in fact going to deliver on the promises that we make to our people, then that establishment needs to be constantly be pushed and to constantly be driven to be more and to focus even more deliberately in the ways in which we fall short,\u201d he added. Asked if, in his current race, his family legacy and Harvard background are an asset or a burden, Kennedy didn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cWithout question, I\u2019m proud of both,\u201d he said. \u2014Staff writer Jasper G.

Ganz \u201964-\u201992, a Harvard Kennedy School professor who was a freshman at the College at the time. \u201cAnd then when so many faculty went off to D.C. \u2014 aside from being pissed off that you didn\u2019t get the course that you wanted to get, like with John Kenneth Galbraith \u2014 it was the same thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was kind of this proximity to this generation change and this new generation taking power,\u201d Ganz said. \u201cIt was very energizing.\u201d\n\nLEAVING A LEGACY\n\nOn John F. Kennedy\u2019s final trip to Boston in October 1963, prior to attending a Harvard-Columbia football game, he picked out a location on Harvard\u2019s campus near the bend of the Charles River for the Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy \u201840 motions with his arm towards the proposed site of his future Presidential Library, along the banks of the Charles River in Boston, with Eliot House and Dunster House visible in the horizon. By Courtesy of The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum Advertisement One month later, Lee Harvey Oswald killed JFK in Dallas, Texas, sending the country \u2014 and campus \u2014 into a frenzy. Following his death, a group of JFK\u2019s closest allies, including his two brothers, began working on plans to memorialize him, albeit far sooner than they expected. The group settled on the creation of a presidential library that would house a museum and his presidential archives. They also debated proposals to create a memorial of Kennedy that would have an ongoing impact on students. The discussions ultimately led to Harvard\u2019s Graduate School of Public Administration becoming the John F. Kennedy School of Government, and to the founding of the Institute of Politics. The creation of the Kennedy Library \u2014 which was originally supposed to be part of a complex designed by architect I.M. Pei that would house the Kennedy School, the IOP, and several academic departments \u2014 was hampered by years of controversy and anger among some Cambridge residents. Community members raised concerns over the influx of tourism a museum would bring to the area. \u201cIt was a brawl,\u201d said Dan H. Fenn Jr. \u201944, the JFK Library\u2019s founding director and a current Kennedy School lecturer. Some residents advocated to keep the archives housed at Harvard but move the museum elsewhere \u2014 a proposal Fenn, a former Crimson president, opposed. Eventually, when building the museum and the archive together in Cambridge became unfeasible, the family gave up on housing the memorial in Harvard Square. In 1979, the library opened on Columbia Point in Dorchester, alongside the archives and museum. The IOP, which was also mired in controversy in its early days, became the Kennedy family\u2019s chief point of engagement with the University.

Markey (D-Mass.) in a closely-watched primary.\n\nTye, the Robert Kennedy biographer, said the young Kennedy\u2019s brand of politics is reminiscent of his grandfather\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI would say that Joe III, in lots of ways, is the closest thing the Kennedys have come to producing another Bobby Kennedy since Bobby Kennedy,\u201d Tye said.\n\nRobert Kennedy served in the Senate from New York and as his brother\u2019s attorney general before being killed while running for president in 1968.\n\nFollowing his high school days at the Buckingham Browne & Nichols School in Cambridge, Joe Kennedy III did not follow the family tradition of attending Harvard and instead matriculated at Stanford as an undergraduate.\n\n\u201cTo have family members of mine that were alumni [at Harvard] was a great source of pride for me,\u201d Kennedy said in an interview with The Crimson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI, for a variety of reasons, having grown up basically in its backyard and having a family that had pretty deep roots in Massachusetts, just wanted to go some place a bit new, and try something a bit new,\u201d he added.\n\nUnited States Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.) is challenging Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a tight race for a Massachusetts Senate seat. By Allison G. Lee After his undergraduate years and a stint in the Peace Corps, Kennedy returned to Cambridge for law school at Harvard. Harvard Law School classmates described Kennedy as friendly but low-key, and as a talented quarterback in the flag football league. \u201cHe was friends with pretty much everyone in our section,\u201d said Patrick T. Childress, one of Kennedy\u2019s Law School section mates. \u201cHe was always just very relatable and friendly.\u201d Childress, who was friends with Kennedy, said Kennedy didn\u2019t express plans to run for office during his time at the Law School. But after several years working as a prosecutor, Kennedy won a U.S. House seat in Massachusetts\u2019s Fourth Congressional District. With his Harvard degree, famous surname, and progressive politics, Joe Kennedy III seems to have many of the same tools his grandfather and great-uncles did. His very appeal in the state still rests, in some part, upon his claim to familial fame. Nicholas Karnovsky \u201919, a 2016 IOP Director\u2019s Intern in Kennedy\u2019s district office, said that legacy \u201cwas definitely part of the appeal\u201d of his position. \u201cWhile when I interned with him back in 2016, he was still a fairly new congressman, it was pretty clear, to me at least, that he was going somewhere,\u201d Karnovsky said. \u201cHe\u2019s the type of person you want to attach your anchor to.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not at all surprised that he\u2019s running for the Senate now, given just his accomplishments and his credentials. I think the Senate is step two, who knows what step three might be,\u201d he added. \u201cThat was certainly why I was interested.\u201d Advertisement United States Representative Joseph P.

Kennedy entered the Senate after winning a 1962 special election to fill the seat vacated by his brother John when he became president. During his career on Capitol Hill, Ted Kennedy was a spokesman for liberal causes, including civil rights, health care and immigration. A leader of the Democratic Party, he was known for his ability to work with those on both sides of the political aisle. In 1980, Kennedy, whose reputation was tarnished by a 1969 car accident, made a failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Dubbed the \u201cliberal lion of the Senate,\u201d he died of cancer at age 77 and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nTed Kennedy\u2019s Childhood and Education\n\nEdward Moore Kennedy was born in Boston on February 22, 1932, the youngest of nine children of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. (1888-1969), a wealthy financier who served as the first chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and later as ambassador to Great Britain, and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy (1890-1995), the daughter of a Boston politician.\n\nDid you know? In 2011, Ted Kennedy\u2019s son Patrick, an eight-term U.S. congressman from Rhode Island, resigned from politics. His exit marked the first time since 1947\u2013when John Kennedy became a U.S. congressman from Massachusetts\u2013that no member of the Kennedy family held elective office in Washington, D.C.\n\nAs a child, Kennedy moved between his family\u2019s homes in Massachusetts, New York, Palm Beach and London, and attended 10 schools before graduating from Milton Academy in Massachusetts in 1950. He went on to attend Harvard University, the alma mater of his father and three older brothers. During his freshman year, he was expelled after a classmate took a Spanish exam in his place. Kennedy then enlisted in the U.S. Army, serving from 1951 to 1953, mostly in Europe. Afterward, he re-enrolled in Harvard, where he became a more serious student and played on the football team.\n\nAfter graduating in 1956, he attended the University of Virginia School of Law. While still a law student, he managed his brother John\u2019s successful 1958 reelection campaign to the U.S. Senate, where he represented Massachusetts. The following year, Kennedy earned his law degree and was admitted to the Massachusetts bar.\n\nTed Kennedy\u2019s Election to the U.S. Senate\n\nWhen John Kennedy made his 1960 run for the White House, Ted Kennedy campaigned for him in the Western states. A licensed pilot, he barnstormed around the region, meeting with delegates and trying bronco riding and ski jumping as a way to connect with people.\n\nIn November 1960, John Kennedy was elected America\u2019s 35th president. The following month, a Kennedy family friend, Benjamin Smith (1916-1991), was appointed to fill the president-elect\u2019s vacated Senate seat until a special election was held. On November 6, 1962, Ted Kennedy, who earlier that year had turned 30 (the minimum age requirement for a U.S. senator), won the special election in Massachusetts to serve out the remainder of his brother\u2019s Senate term, ending in January 1965. Massachusetts voters reelected Kennedy to the seat eight more times, in 1964, 1970, 1976, 1982, 1988, 1994, 2000 and 2006.\n\nWith John Kennedy in the White House, Ted Kennedy in the Senate and their brother Robert (1925-1968) serving as the U.S. attorney general from 1961 to 1964 and as a U.S. senator from New York from 1965 to 1968, the glamorous, wealthy, Irish-Catholic Kennedys were often referred to as an American political dynasty.\n\nTed Kennedy\u2019s Marriages and Family\n\nIn 1958 Ted Kennedy married Joan Bennett (1936-), who he met through his sister Jean (1928-); both women had attended Manhattanville College in New York. The couple had three children\u2014Kara (1960-), Edward Jr. (1961-) and Patrick (1967-)\u2014before divorcing in 1982. In 1992, Kennedy married Victoria Reggie (1954-), a Washington attorney with two children. Kennedy often spent time with his family sailing, which he described as his favorite pastime.\n\nTragedy Strikes the Kennedys\n\nOn November 22, 1963, tragedy struck the Kennedy family and the nation when 46-year-old President John Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. He was the third Kennedy sibling to perish. The oldest child, Joseph Kennedy Jr. (1915-1944), a Navy pilot, died in World War II, and the second-eldest daughter, Kathleen (1920-1948), was killed in a plane crash in France. In June 1964, Ted Kennedy escaped death when the small plane he was riding in crashed in Massachusetts in bad weather, killing two people and leaving Kennedy with a broken back and other injuries that required a six-month hospital recuperation.\n\nOn June 5, 1968, tragedy struck again when 42-year-old Senator Robert Kennedy, who had just won the Democratic presidential primary in California, was assassinated in Los Angeles.\n\nWith Robert\u2019s death, Ted Kennedy became the family patriarch\u2013his father Joseph had suffered an incapacitating stroke in 1961\u2013and a surrogate father to his two slain brothers\u2019 13 children.\n\nIncident at Chappaquiddick\n\nOn July 18, 1969, Ted Kennedy was involved in a controversial event that would mar the rest of his career. He accidentally drove his car off a bridge on Massachusetts\u2019 Chappaquiddick Island, killing his passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne (1940-1969), who drowned. Kennedy did not report the incident to the authorities for nearly 10 hours, claiming the delay was due to the fact that he had suffered a concussion and was exhausted from attempting to rescue Kopechne.\n\nThe 37-year-old senator pled guilty to leaving the scene of an accident and received a two-month suspended sentence. However, Kennedy was plagued by questions about his behavior. He later referred to his actions as \u201cinexcusable\u201d and said that Kopechne\u2019s death \u201chaunts me every day of my life.\u201d\n\nTed Kennedy\u2019s Bid for the White House\n\nIn November 1979, Ted Kennedy announced he would run against President Jimmy Carter (1924-) for the 1980 Democratic presidential nomination. Kennedy won primaries in New York, California and eight other states, but his campaign was disorganized and hurt by lingering questions about Chappaquiddick. At the August 1980 Democratic National Convention, he withdrew his bid for the presidency and went on to deliver a fiery speech in which he said, \u201cFor me, a few hours ago, this campaign came to an end. For all those whose cares have been our concern, the work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives, and the dream shall never die.\u201d\n\nKennedy never made another bid for the presidency.\n\nThe Liberal Lion of the Senate\n\nSome historians have called Ted Kennedy one of the most effective legislators in the history of the U.S. Senate. During nearly 47 years on Capitol Hill, his office wrote some 2,500 bills, over 300 of which became law. Additionally, over 550 bills that he co-sponsored became law. A skilled orator and gifted storyteller, Kennedy was known for his ability to collaborate with Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nHe successfully fought for legislation concerning education, immigration reform, increases to the federal minimum wage, voting rights, AIDS care, various consumer protections and equal rights for minorities, the disabled, women and gay Americans. In 1972 he was the driving force behind the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program, which provides food assistance and access to health services for low-income women and their children, and he was instrumental in the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which banned workplace discrimination against and required public accommodations for the disabled.\n\nKennedy referred to universal health insurance as \u201cthe cause of my life,\u201d and for decades worked to achieve national health reform. Kennedy\u2019s widow Victoria was present when President Barack Obama (1961-) signed historic health care legislation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, in March 2010.\n\nIn foreign policy matters, Kennedy was an opponent of the Vietnam War and in 2002 voted against authorizing the use of military force in Iraq. He worked for human rights in South America in the 1970s, championed U.S. government sanctions against apartheid-ruled South Africa in the 1980s, and helped broker a peace agreement in Northern Ireland in the late 1990s.\n\nTed Kennedy\u2019s Final Years\n\nIn May 2008, Ted Kennedy was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. That August, despite his poor health, he made a rousing speech in his distinct Massachusetts accent at the Democratic National Convention in Denver. In his speech, the senator, who earlier that year had endorsed Barack Obama for president, invoked the legacy of the Kennedy family when he stated, \u201cAnd this November the torch will be passed again to a new generation of Americans\u2026The work begins anew. The hope rises again. And the dream lives on.\u201d\n\nOn August 25, 2009, the 77-year-old Kennedy succumbed to brain cancer at his home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. At his funeral, which was attended by three former U.S. presidents, the late senator was eulogized by President Obama. Kennedy was buried at Virginia\u2019s Arlington National Cemetery, near the graves of his brothers John and Robert. Kennedy\u2019s memoir, \u201cTrue Compass,\u201d was published posthumously in September 2009."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ted-Kennedy-American-senator", "page_content": "Ted Kennedy was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom on August 15, 2009. The award was accepted on his behalf by his children just 10 days before his death at his home.\n\nTed Kennedy was a leading advocate in the Senate for several causes, including voting rights, fair housing, consumer protection, and national health insurance. He was recognized for his willingness to cooperate with Republicans to pass legislation, such as the No Child Left Behind Act (2001) and other initiatives of the President George W. Bush administration.\n\nOn the night of July 18, 1969, Ted Kennedy accidentally drove his car off an unmarked bridge on Chappaquiddick Island, near Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts, and his companion in the car, 28-year-old Mary Jo Kopechne, was drowned.

He was the youngest child of Rose and Joseph Kennedy and the last surviving brother of Pres. John F. Kennedy. His other brother, Robert Kennedy, was also a U.S. Senator, and his sister, Eunice, founded (1968) the Special Olympics.\n\nTed Kennedy graduated from Harvard University in 1956. He then studied at the International Law School (The Hague) and received a law degree from the University of Virginia (1959). He campaigned for his brother John in the 1960 presidential race and in 1962 was elected to the president\u2019s former U.S. Senate seat representing Massachusetts. The following year John was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Although unable to campaign actively for reelection (1964) for a full term because of an injury, Kennedy was swept back into office by a landslide vote. In 1968 he lent his support to his brother Robert\u2019s campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. However, Robert was assassinated in June of that year.\n\nEarly in 1969 Kennedy was elected majority whip in the U.S. Senate, and he became an early front-runner for the next Democratic presidential nomination. Then, on the night of July 18, 1969, he accidentally drove his car off an unmarked bridge on Chappaquiddick Island, near Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts, and his companion in the car, 28-year-old Mary Jo Kopechne, was drowned. Kennedy was found guilty of leaving the scene of an accident. He was reelected to the Senate in 1970 but announced that he would not seek the presidency in 1972.\n\nKennedy won reelection to a third full term as senator in 1976. He was a serious contender for the 1980 Democratic presidential nomination but withdrew from the race during the convention. He won a fourth term in 1982 and was again reelected to the Senate in 1988, 1994, 2000, and 2006.\n\nKennedy continued to be a prominent spokesman for the policies that had come to be associated with his family name\u2014i.e., support for social welfare legislation and active participation in world affairs. He became a leading advocate in the Senate for many liberal causes, including voting rights, fair housing, consumer protection, and national health insurance. At the same time, he was recognized for his willingness to cooperate with Republicans in the Senate to advance important legislation, such as the No Child Left Behind Act (2001) and other initiatives of the administration of Pres. George W. Bush. In 2008, after being hospitalized for a seizure, Kennedy was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour. In March 2009 he was made an honorary Knight of the British Empire, and on August 15 he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom (it was accepted on his behalf by his children); 10 days later he died at his home. In his eulogy for Kennedy, Pres. Barack Obama called him the \u201csoul of the Democratic Party\u201d and the \u201cgreatest legislator of our time.\u201d Kennedy\u2019s autobiography, True Compass, was published in September 2009."}, {"url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/media/senators-who-became-president/", "page_content": "The dome of the US Capitol is seen January 4, 2013 on a cold day in Washington. KAREN BLEIER/AFP/Getty Images Is the U.S. Senate a pathway to the presidency? Sixteen presidents were once senators and three moved directly from the U.S Senate to the White House. As the 2016 election unfolds, there is no shortage of current or former senators who are hoping to capture the presidency. In the Democratic field, former Senator Hillary Clinton and current Senator Bernie Sanders are leading the race. On the Republican side, a handful of the candidates in the running are serving or once served in the Senate, including Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Rick Santorum. Here's a look at the presidents who once served in the senate, along with two senators who nearly won the presidency - but not quite.\n\nJames Monroe (1758 \u2013 1831) James Monroe was the fifth President of the United States (1817-1825) and the last founding father to be president. He served as a Senator from Virginia from 1790 to 1794.\n\nJohn Quincy Adams (1767 - 1848) John Quincy Adams was the sixth President of the United States(1825 - 1829).

Unlike the first six Presidents who were from wealthy, educated backgrounds in the east, Jackson was born into a Scotch-Irish immigrant family. He was orphaned at the age of 14 and then raised by his uncles. Jackson was first nominated for president in 1824 and narrowly lost to John Quincy Adams. He was the first man elected from Tennessee to the House of Representatives and served briefly in the Senate from 1797 to 1798 and then from 1823 to 1825.\n\nMartin Van Buren (1782 \u2013 1862) After serving as the eighth vice president under President Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren was elected the eighth President of the United States in 1836. Van Buren was the first president to be born after the United States declared independence. Of Dutch descent, he was the only president who spoke English as a second language. Van Buren served as a United States Senator from New York from 1821 to 1828.\n\nWilliam Henry Harrison (1773 \u2013 1831) William Henry Harrison was the ninth President of the United States. He was 68 years old when inaugurated, the oldest president to be elected until Ronald Reagan took office in 1981. On the 32nd day of his presidency, in 1831, Harrison became the first president to die in office, serving the shortest tenure of any U.S. president. Earlier in his career, William Henry Harrison was a senator from Ohio from 1825 to 1828.\n\nJohn Tyler (1790 \u2013 1862) John Tyler became the tenth President of the United States when President William Henry Harrison died in April 1841. Tyler was the first vice president to take office due to the death of his predecessor. On his final full day in office, Tyler signed a bill making Florida the 27th state. Earlier in his career, Tyler served as a senator from Virginia from 1827 to 1836.\n\nFranklin Pierce (1804 \u2013 1869) Franklin Pierce became the 14th President of the United States in 1853. Prior to that, he served as a U.S. senator representing New Hampshire from 1837 to 1842.\n\nJames Buchanan (1791 \u2013 1868) James Buchanan was a senator from Pennsylvania from (1834 - 1845) and the 15th President of the United States (1857-1861). He took office immediately prior to the American Civil War. He was the only president who never married.\n\nAndrew Johnson (1808 \u2013 1875) Andrew Johnson was the 17th President of the United States. He was elected vice president on the Republican ticket with Abraham Lincoln and became President in 1865 after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Earlier in his career, he served as a U.S. senator representing Tennessee from 1857 to 1862 and then briefly in 1875 until his death.\n\nBenjamin Harrison (1833 \u2013 1901) Benjamin Harrison followed in the footsteps of his grandfather President William Henry Harrison all the way to the White House. He was a senator representing Indiana from 1881 to 1887, and hetook office in 1889 as the 23rd President of the United States.\n\nWarren G. Harding (1865 \u2013 1923) Warren G. Harding was one of the three Senators (the other two were John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama) who moved directly from the U.S. Senate to the White House. Harding was a Senator from Ohio (1915 - 1921) before he became the 29th President of the United States in 1921. Harding died unexpectedly of a heart attack while travelling in California.\n\nHarry S. Truman (1884 \u2013 1972) Harry S. Truman became the 33rd President of the United States after Franklin Delano Roosevelt's sudden death in 1945. He was Roosevelt's vice president for just 82 days. Earlier in his career, Truman was a senator from Missouri from 1935 to 1945.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy (1917 \u2013 1963) John F. Kennedy was the second U.S. President who moved directly from the U.S. Senate to the White House. Kennedy served as the 35th President of the United States from January 1961 until his assassination in November 1963. He was the youngest man elected to office (he was 43 at the time.) Before Kennedy became President, he was a senator representing Massachusetts from 1953 to 1960.\n\nLyndon B. Johnson (1908 \u2013 1973) Lyndon B. Johnson was elected Vice President as John F. Kennedy's running mate. On November 22, 1963, Johnson was sworn in as the 36th President of the United States just a few hours after Kennedy's assassination. Before Johnson became vice president in 1961, he was a senator from Texas.\n\nRichard M. Nixon (1913 \u2013 1994) Richard Nixon was elected the 37th U.S. president after serving as a U.S. Representative and Senator from California. In 1953, He moved from the U.S. Senate directly to his position as the 36th Vice President of the United States. He won the presidency in his own right in 1968 and was reelected in 1972. In 1974, he became the only President to ever resign the office after the Watergate scandal.\n\nBarack Obama (1961 - present) U.S. President Barack Obama signs the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 into law in the Oval Office the White House in Washington November 2, 2015.

A member of the Democratic Party and the Kennedy political family, he was the second most senior member of the Senate when he died and the third-longest-continuously-serving senator in United States history. Kennedy was a brother of President John F. Kennedy and U.S. Attorney General and U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy\u2014both victims of assassination\u2014and was the father of Congressman Patrick J. Kennedy.\n\nKennedy was 30 years old when he first entered the Senate following a November 1962 special election in Massachusetts to fill the vacant seat previously held by his brother John, who had taken office as the president. He was elected to a full six-year term in 1964 and was later re-elected seven more times. The Chappaquiddick incident in 1969 resulted in the death of his automobile passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne, a former campaign worker for his brother Robert's Presidential campaign. He pleaded guilty to a charge of leaving the scene of an accident and later received a two-month suspended sentence. The incident and its aftermath hindered his chances of ever becoming president. His only attempt, in the 1980 election, resulted in a Democratic primary campaign loss to the incumbent president, Jimmy Carter.\n\nKennedy was known for his oratorical skills. His 1968 eulogy for his brother Robert and his 1980 rallying cry for modern American liberalism were among his best-known speeches. He became recognized as \"The Lion of the Senate\" through his long tenure and influence. Kennedy and his staff wrote more than 300 bills that were enacted into law. Unabashedly liberal, Kennedy championed an interventionist government that emphasized economic and social justice, but he was also known for working with Republicans to find compromises. Kennedy played a major role in passing many laws, including the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the National Cancer Act of 1971, the COBRA health insurance provision, the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Ryan White AIDS Care Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Mental Health Parity Act, the S-CHIP children's health program, the No Child Left Behind Act, and the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act. During the 2000s, he led several unsuccessful immigration reform efforts. Over the course of his Senate career, Kennedy made efforts to enact universal health care, which he called the \"cause of my life.\" Despite his role as a major figure and spokesman for American progressivism, Kennedy was a champion of the Senate and Senate collegiality who worked across the aisle with conservative Senators like Orrin Hatch on issues of mutual interest.\n\nKennedy died on August 25, 2009 of a malignant brain tumor at his home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, and was buried near his brothers John and Robert at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nEarly life\n\nEdward Moore Kennedy was born on February 22, 1932, at St. Margaret's Hospital in the Dorchester section of Boston, Massachusetts. He was the last of the nine children of Joseph Patrick Kennedy and Rose Fitzgerald, members of prominent Irish American families in Boston,[1] who constituted one of the wealthiest families in the nation once they were joined.[2] His eight siblings were Joseph Jr., John, Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Robert, and Jean. John asked to be the newborn's godfather, a request his parents honored, though they did not agree to his request to name the baby George Washington Kennedy (Ted was born on President George Washington's 200th birthday) and instead named him after their father's assistant.[3]\n\nAs a child, Ted was frequently uprooted by his family's moves among Bronxville, New York; Hyannis Port, Massachusetts; Palm Beach, Florida; and the Court of St. James's, in London, England.[4] His formal education started at Gibbs School in Kensington, London.[5] He had attended ten schools by the age of eleven; this was a series of disruptions that interfered with his academic success.[6] He was an altar boy at the St. Joseph's Church and was seven when he received his First Communion from Pope Pius XII in the Vatican.[7] He spent sixth and seventh grades at the Fessenden School, where he was a mediocre student, and eighth grade at Cranwell Preparatory School; both schools located in Massachusetts.[4] He was the youngest child and his parents were affectionate towards him, but they also compared him unfavorably with his older brothers. Ted's affable maternal grandfather, John F. Fitzgerald, was the Mayor of Boston, a U.S. Congressman, and an early political and personal influence.[1]\n\nBetween the ages of eight and sixteen, Ted suffered the traumas of Rosemary's failed lobotomy and the deaths of Joseph Jr. in World War II and Kathleen in an airplane crash.[1] He spent his four high-school years at Milton Academy, a preparatory school in Milton, Massachusetts, where he received B and C grades and, in 1950, finished 36th in a graduating class of 56. He did well at football there, playing on the varsity in his last two years; the school's headmaster later described his play as \"absolutely fearless ... he would have tackled an express train to New York if you asked ... he loved contact sports.\"[8] Kennedy also played on the tennis team and was in the drama, debate, and glee clubs.\n\nCollege, military service, and law school\n\nLike his father and brothers before him, Ted graduated from Harvard College. An offense and defensive end on the football team, Kennedy was anxious about maintaining his eligibility for athletics for the next year,[1] so at the end of his second semester in May 1951 he had a classmate take his place at a Spanish exam. The deception was immediately discovered and both students were expelled for cheating. In a standard Harvard treatment for serious disciplinary cases, they were told they could apply for readmission within a year or two if they demonstrated good behavior during that time.[9][10]\n\nIn June 1951, Kennedy enlisted in the United States Army and signed up for an optional four-year term that was shortened to the minimum of two years after his father intervened. Following basic training at Fort Dix in New Jersey, he requested assignment to Fort Holabird in Maryland for Army Intelligence training, but was dropped without explanation after a few weeks. He went to Camp Gordon in Georgia for training in the Military Police Corps. In June 1952, Kennedy was assigned to the honor guard at SHAPE headquarters in Paris, France.[9] His father's political connections ensured that he was not deployed to the ongoing Korean War.[11] After 21 months, he was discharged in March 1953 as a private first class.[9]\n\nKennedy re-entered Harvard in the summer of 1953 and improved his study habits.[1] His brother John was a U.S. Senator and the family was attracting more public attention.[12] Academically, Kennedy received mediocre grades for his first three years, improved to a B average for his senior year, and finished barely in the top half of his class. Kennedy graduated from Harvard at age 24 in 1956 with an AB in history and government.[13]\n\nDue to his low grades, Kennedy was not accepted by Harvard Law School.[10] He instead followed his brother Bobby and enrolled in the University of Virginia School of Law in 1956.[1] That acceptance was controversial among faculty and alumni, who judged Kennedy's past cheating episodes at Harvard to be incompatible with the University of Virginia's honor code; it took a full faculty vote to admit him.[14] Kennedy also attended the Hague Academy of International Law during one summer.[15] At Virginia, Kennedy felt that he had to study \"four times as hard and four times as long\" as other students to keep up with them.[16] He received mostly C grades and was in the middle of the class ranking, but was the winner of the prestigious William Minor Lile Moot Court Competition.[1] He was elected head of the Student Legal Forum and brought many prominent speakers to the campus via his family connections.[17] While there, his careless driving caught up with him and he was charged with reckless driving and driving without a license.[1] While attending law school, he was officially named as manager of his brother John's 1958 Senate re-election campaign; Ted's ability to connect with ordinary voters on the street helped bring a record-setting victory margin that gave credibility to John's presidential aspirations.[18] Ted graduated from law school in 1959.[17]\n\nIn October 1957 (early in his second year of law school), Kennedy met Joan Bennett at Manhattanville College; they were introduced after a dedication speech for a gymnasium that his family had donated at the campus. Bennett was a senior at Manhattanville and had worked as a model and won beauty contests, but she was unfamiliar with the world of politics. After the couple became engaged, she grew nervous about marrying someone she did not know that well, but Joe Kennedy insisted that the wedding should proceed.[19] The couple was married by Cardinal Francis Spellman on November 29, 1958, at St. Joseph's Church in Bronxville, New York,[1] with a reception at nearby Siwanoy Country Club.[20] Ted and Joan had three children: Kara (1960\u20132011), Ted Jr. (b. 1961) and Patrick (b. 1967). By the 1970s, the marriage became troubled due to Ted's infidelity and Joan's growing alcoholism. They would separate in 1977 and eventually divorce in 1983.\n\nEarly career\n\nJohn, Bobby , and Ted Kennedy during John's presidential campaign, July 1960\n\nKennedy was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar in 1959. In 1960, his brother John announced his candidacy for President of the United States and Ted managed his campaign in the Western states.[1] The seven weeks he spent in Wisconsin helped his brother win the first contested primary of the season there and a similar time spent in Wyoming was rewarded when a unanimous vote from that state's delegates put his brother over the top at the 1960 Democratic National Convention.[21]\n\nFollowing his victory in the presidential election, John resigned from his seat as U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, but Ted was not eligible to fill the vacancy until his thirtieth birthday on February 22, 1962.[22] Ted's brothers were not in favor of his running immediately, but Ted ultimately coveted the Senate seat as an accomplishment to match his brothers, and their father overruled them. John asked Massachusetts Governor Foster Furcolo to name Kennedy family friend Ben Smith as interim senator for John's unexpired term, which he did in December 1960.[23] This kept the seat available for Ted.\n\nFirst Senate campaign, 1962\n\nIn the November special election, Kennedy defeated Republican George Cabot Lodge II, product of another noted Massachusetts political family, gaining 55 percent of the vote.\n\nBrothers' assassinations\n\nKennedy was sworn into the Senate on November 7, 1962. He maintained a deferential attitude towards the older Southern members when he first entered the Senate. He recognized the seniority system in the Senate, avoiding publicity and focusing on committee work and local issues.[24] Compared to his brothers in office, he lacked John's sophistication and Robert's intense, sometimes grating drive, but was more affable than either of them.\n\nOn November 22, 1963, Kennedy was presiding over the Senate\u2014a task given to junior members\u2014when an aide rushed in to tell him that his brother, President John F. Kennedy, had been shot. His brother Robert soon told him that the President was dead. Ted and his sister Eunice Kennedy Shriver immediately flew to the family home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, to give the news to their invalid father, who had been afflicted by a stroke suffered two years earlier.\n\nTed Kennedy, accompanied by his brother Robert and sister-in-law Jacqueline , walks from the White House for the funeral procession accompanying President Kennedy's casket to Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle.\n\nKennedy in 1967\n\nKennedy initially said he had \"no reservations\" about the expanding U.S. role in the Vietnam War and acknowledged that it would be a \"long and enduring struggle.\" He held hearings on the plight of refugees in the conflict, which revealed that the U.S. government had no coherent policy for refugees.[25] Kennedy also tried to reform \"unfair\" and \"inequitable\" aspects of the draft. By the time of a January 1968 trip to Vietnam, Kennedy was disillusioned by the lack of U.S. progress, and suggested publicly that the U.S. should tell South Vietnam, \"Shape up or we're going to ship out.\"[26] On March 31, 1968 President Lyndon Johnson made a surprise announcement that he would not seek the Presidency again in the 1968 election.\n\nTed initially advised his brother Robert against challenging for the Democratic nomination in the 1968 presidential election. Once Eugene McCarthy's strong showing in the New Hampshire primary led to Robert's presidential campaign starting in March 1968, Ted recruited political leaders for endorsements to his brother in the western states.[27] Ted was in San Francisco when his brother Robert won the crucial California primary on June 4, 1968, and then after midnight, Robert was shot in Los Angeles and died a day later. Ted Kennedy was devastated by his brother's death, as he was closest to Robert among those in the Kennedy family. Kennedy aide Frank Mankiewicz said of seeing Ted at the hospital where Robert lay mortally wounded: \"I have never, ever, nor do I expect ever, to see a face more in grief.\" At Robert's funeral, Kennedy eulogized his older brother:\n\nMy brother need not be idealized, or enlarged in death beyond what he was in life; to be remembered simply as a good and decent man, who saw wrong and tried to right it, saw suffering and tried to heal it, saw war and tried to stop it. Those of us who loved him and who take him to his rest today, pray that what he was to us and what he wished for others will some day come to pass for all the world. As he said many times, in many parts of this nation, to those he touched and who sought to touch him: \"Some men see things as they are and say why. I dream things that never were and say why not.\"[28]\n\nAfter the deaths of his brothers, Kennedy took on the role of a surrogate father for his 13 nephews and nieces.[29] By some reports, he also negotiated the October 1968 marital contract between Jacqueline Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis.[30]\n\nChappaquiddick incident\n\nFollowing Republican Richard Nixon's victory in November, Kennedy was widely assumed to be the front-runner for the 1972 Democratic nomination.[31] In January 1969, Kennedy defeated Louisiana Senator Russell B. Long by a 31\u201326 margin to become Senate Majority Whip, the youngest person to attain that position.[32] While this further boosted his presidential image, he also appeared conflicted by the inevitability of having to run for the position;[29] \"Few who knew him doubted that in one sense he very much wanted to take that path\", Time magazine reported, but \"he had a fatalistic, almost doomed feeling about the prospect\".\n\nOn the night of July 18, 1969, Kennedy was at Chappaquiddick Island on the eastern end of Martha's Vineyard. He was hosting a party for the Boiler Room Girls, a group of young women who had worked on his brother Robert's ill-fated 1968 presidential campaign.[31] Kennedy left the party with one of the women, 28-year-old Mary Jo Kopechne.\n\nDriving a 1967 Oldsmobile Delmont 88, he attempted to cross the Dike Bridge, which did not have a guardrail at that time. Kennedy later denied that he was drunk but he lost control of his vehicle and crashed in the Poucha Pond inlet, which was a tidal channel on Chappaquiddick Island. Kennedy escaped from the overturned vehicle, and, by his description, dove below the surface seven or eight times, vainly attempting to reach and rescue Kopechne. Ultimately, he swam to shore and left the scene, with Kopechne still trapped inside the vehicle. Kennedy did not report the accident to authorities until the next morning, by which time Kopechne's body had already been discovered.[31] Kennedy's cousin Joe Gargan later said that he and Kennedy's friend Paul Markham, both of whom were at the party and came to the scene, urged Kennedy to report it at the time.[33]\n\nA week after the incident, Kennedy pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident and was given a suspended sentence of two months in jail. That night, he gave a national broadcast in which he said, \"I regard as indefensible the fact that I did not report the accident to the police immediately,\" but he denied driving under the influence of alcohol and also denied any immoral conduct between him and Kopechne.[31] Kennedy asked the Massachusetts electorate whether he should stay in office or resign; after getting a favorable response in messages sent to him, Kennedy announced on July 30 that he would remain in the Senate and run for re-election the next year.[34]\n\nIn January 1970, an inquest into Kopechne's death was held in Edgartown, Massachusetts. At the request of Kennedy's lawyers, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ordered the inquest to be conducted in secret.[35] The presiding judge, James A. Boyle, concluded that some aspects of Kennedy's story about that night were not true, and that negligent driving \"appears to have contributed\" to the death of Kopechne. A grand jury on Martha's Vineyard conducted a two-day investigation in April 1970 but issued no indictment, after which Boyle made his inquest report public. Kennedy deemed its conclusions \"not justified.\"[31] Questions about the Chappaquiddick incident generated a large number of articles and books during the following years.\n\n1980 presidential campaign\n\nThe Chappaquiddick incident impacted any Presidential aspirations Kennedy might have had in 1972 and 1976. In 1980, he would have to face an incumbent President from his own party. As the Democratic nominee, Jimmy Carter developed little relationship with Kennedy during his primary campaign, the convention, or the general election campaign.[36] This continued during the Carter administration, which were difficult year for Kennedy. He had been the most important Democrat in Washington ever since his brother Robert's death, but now Carter was, and Kennedy at first did not have a full committee chairmanship with which to wield influence.[37] Carter in turn sometimes resented Kennedy's status as a political celebrity.[3] Despite generally similar ideologies, their priorities were different. Kennedy expressed to reporters that he was content with his congressional role and viewed presidential ambitions as almost far-fetched, but Kennedy finally decided to seek the Democratic nomination in the 1980 presidential election by launching an unusual, insurgent campaign against the incumbent Carter.[38]\n\nA midsummer 1978 poll showed that Democrats preferred Kennedy over Carter by a 5-to-3 margin. Labor unions urged Kennedy to run, as did some Democratic party officials who feared that Carter's unpopularity could result in heavy losses in the 1980 congressional elections.[39] Kennedy decided to run in August 1979, when polls showed him with a 2-to-1 advantage over Carter;[40] Carter's approval rating slipped to 19 percent.[41] Kennedy formally announced his campaign on November 7, 1979, at Boston's Faneuil Hall.[42] The Iranian hostage crisis, which began on November 4, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which began on December 27, prompted the electorate to rally around the president and allowed Carter to pursue a Rose Garden strategy of staying at the White House, which kept Kennedy's campaign out of the headlines.[42]\n\nKennedy's campaign staff was disorganized and Kennedy was initially an ineffective campaigner.[43] The Chappaquiddick incident emerged as a more significant issue than the staff had expected, with several newspaper columnists and editorials criticizing Kennedy's answers on the matter.[44] In the January 1980 Iowa caucuses that initiated the primaries season, Carter demolished Kennedy by a 59\u201331 percent margin. Kennedy lost three New England contests.[42] Kennedy did form a more coherent message about why he was running, saying at Georgetown University: \"I believe we must not permit the dream of social progress to be shattered by those whose promises have failed.\"[45] However, concerns over Chappaquiddick and issues related to personal character prevented Kennedy from gaining the support of many people who were disillusioned with Carter.[46] During a St. Patrick's Day Parade in Chicago, Kennedy had to wear a bullet-proof vest due to assassination threats, and hecklers yelled \"Where's Mary Jo?\" at him.[47] In the key March 18 primary in Illinois, Kennedy failed to gain the support of Catholic voters, and Carter crushed him, winning 155 of 169 delegates.[48]\n\nWith little mathematical hope of winning the nomination and polls showing another likely defeat in the New York primary, Kennedy prepared to withdraw from the race. However, partially due to Jewish voter unhappiness with a U.S. vote at the United Nations against Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Kennedy staged an upset and won the March 25 vote by a 59\u201341 percent margin. Carter responded with an advertising campaign that attacked Kennedy's character in general without explicitly mentioning Chappaquiddick, but Kennedy still managed a narrow win in the April 22 Pennsylvania primary.[42] Carter won 11 of 12 primaries held in May, while on the June 3 Super Tuesday primaries, Kennedy won California, New Jersey, and three smaller states out of eight contests.[49] Overall, Kennedy had won 10 presidential primaries against Carter, who won 24.\n\nAlthough Carter now had enough delegates to clinch the nomination, Kennedy carried his campaign on to the 1980 Democratic National Convention in August in New York, hoping to pass a rule there that would free delegates from being bound by primary results and open the convention. This move failed on the first night of the convention, and Kennedy withdrew.[42] On the second night, August 12, Kennedy delivered the most famous speech of his career. Drawing on allusions to and quotes of Martin Luther King Jr., Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and Alfred Lord Tennyson to say that American liberalism was not pass\u00e9,[50] he concluded with the words:\n\nFor me, a few hours ago, this campaign came to an end. For all those whose cares have been our concern, the work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives, and the dream shall never die.[51]\n\nThe Madison Square Garden audience reacted with wild applause and demonstrations for half an hour.[42] On the final night, Kennedy arrived late after Carter's acceptance speech and while he shook Carter's hand, he failed to raise Carter's arm in the traditional show of party unity.[48] Carter's difficulty in securing the assistance of Kennedy supporters during the election campaign has long been considered as a contributing factor to his November defeat by Ronald Reagan.\n\nSenate Career\n\nHealth Care\n\nKennedy giving a presentation on his healthcare proposal in June 1971\n\nAt the end of 1968, Kennedy had joined the new Committee for National Health Insurance at the invitation of its founder, United Auto Workers president Walter Reuther.[52] In May 1970, Reuther died and Senator Ralph Yarborough, chairman of the full Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee and its Health subcommittee, lost his primary election, propelling Kennedy into a leadership role on the issue of national health insurance.[53] Kennedy introduced a bipartisan bill in August 1970 for single-payer universal national health insurance with no cost sharing, paid for by payroll taxes and general federal revenue. Health care would remain one of the issues that Kennedy would champion throughout his career.\n\nIn February 1971, President Nixon proposed health insurance reform\u2014an employer mandate to offer private health insurance if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, federalization of Medicaid for the poor with dependent minor children, and support for health maintenance organizations. Hearings on national health insurance were held in 1971, but no bill had the support of House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committee chairmen Representative Wilbur Mills and Senator Russell Long.[54] Kennedy sponsored and helped pass the limited Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973.[55]\n\nIn February 1974, President Nixon proposed more comprehensive health insurance reform\u2014an employer mandate to offer private health insurance if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all with income-based premiums and cost sharing, and replacement of Medicare with a new federal program that eliminated the limit on hospital days, added income-based out-of-pocket limits, and added outpatient prescription drug coverage.[56] In April 1974, Kennedy and Mills introduced a bill for near-universal national health insurance with benefits identical to the expanded Nixon plan, but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through payroll taxes. Both plans were criticized by labor, consumer, and senior citizen organizations because of their substantial cost sharing.[57] In August 1974, after Nixon's resignation and President Ford's call for health insurance reform, Mills tried to advance a compromise based on Nixon's plan but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through premiums to private health insurance companies. He gave up when he was unable to get more than a 13\u201312 majority of his committee to support his compromise plan.\n\nAfter the 1976 election of President Carter, Kennedy renewed his efforts. As a candidate, Carter had proposed health care reform that included key features of Kennedy's national health insurance bill, but in December 1977, President Carter told Kennedy his bill must be changed to preserve a large role for private insurance companies, minimize federal spending (precluding payroll tax financing), and be phased-in so as to not interfere with Carter's paramount domestic policy objective\u2014balancing the federal budget.[58] Kennedy and labor compromised, making the requested changes, but broke with Carter in July 1978 when he would not commit to pursuing a single bill with a fixed schedule for phasing-in comprehensive coverage.[58] Frustrated by Carter's budgetary concerns and political caution,[2] Kennedy said in a December 1978 speech on national health insurance at the Democratic midterm convention that \"sometimes a party must sail against the wind\" and in particular should provide health care as \"a basic right for all, not just an expensive privilege for the few.\"[59]\n\nIn May 1979, Kennedy proposed a new bipartisan universal national health insurance bill. Provision included a choice of competing federally regulated private health insurance plans with no cost sharing-financed by income-based premiums via an employer mandate and individual mandate-replacement of Medicaid by government payment of premiums to private insurers, and enhancement of Medicare by adding prescription drug coverage and eliminating premiums and cost sharing.[60] In June 1979, Carter proposed more limited health insurance reform\u2014an employer mandate to provide catastrophic private health insurance plus coverage without cost sharing for pregnant women and infants, federalization of Medicaid with extension to all of the very poor, plus enhancement of Medicare by adding catastrophic coverage. Neither plan gained any traction in Congress and the failure to come to agreement represented the final political breach between the two. Carter wrote in 1982 that Kennedy's disagreements with Carter's proposed approach \"ironically\" thwarted Carter's efforts to provide a comprehensive health-care system for the country.[61] In turn, Kennedy wrote in his memoir that his relationship with Carter was \"unhealthy\" and that \"Clearly President Carter was a difficult man to convince \u2013 of anything.\"[62]\n\nMuch later, following the failure of the Clinton health care plan, Kennedy went against his previous strategy and sought incremental measures instead.[63] Kennedy worked with Republican Senator Nancy Kassebaum to create and pass the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in 1996, which set new marks for portability of insurance and confidentiality of records. The same year, Kennedy's Mental Health Parity Act forced insurance companies to treat mental health payments the same as others with respect to limits reached. In 1997, Kennedy was the prime mover behind the State Children's Health Insurance Program,[64] which used increased tobacco taxes to fund the largest expansion of taxpayer-funded health insurance coverage for children in the U.S. since Medicaid began in the 1960s.\n\nForeign Policy\n\nSenator Kennedy meeting with Justice Minister Horst Ehmke at Bonn, West Germany in April 1971\n\nIn April 1974, Kennedy traveled to the Soviet Union, where he met with leader Leonid Brezhnev and advocated a full nuclear test ban as well as relaxed emigration, gave a speech at Moscow State University, met with Soviet dissidents, and secured an exit visa for famed cellist Mstislav Rostropovich.[65] Kennedy's Subcommittee on Refugees and Escapees continued to focus on Vietnam, especially after the Fall of Saigon in 1975.\n\nKennedy visited China on a goodwill mission in late December 1977, meeting with leader Deng Xiaoping and eventually gained permission for a number of Mainland Chinese nationals to leave the country; in 1978, he also visited the Soviet Union, meeting with Brezhnev and also with dissidents there again.[66] During the 1970s, Kennedy also showed interest in nuclear disarmament, and as part of his efforts in this field even visited Hiroshima in January 1978 and gave a public speech to that effect at Hiroshima University.[67] He became chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1978.\n\nAfter the election of Ronald Reagan, Kennedy became very visible in opposing aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including U.S. intervention in the Salvadoran Civil War and U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua, and in opposing Reagan-supported weapons systems, including the B-1 bomber, the MX missile, and the Strategic Defense Initiative. Kennedy became the Senate's leading advocate for a nuclear freeze and was a critic of Reagan's confrontational policies toward the Soviet Union.[68][69]\n\nA 1983 KGB memo indicates that Kennedy engaged in back-channel communication with the Soviet Union. According to a May 14, 1983 memorandum from KGB chairman Viktor Chebrikov to general secretary Yuri Andropov, former U.S. Senator John Tunney\u2014a friend and former college roommate of Kennedy's\u2014visited Moscow that month and conveyed a message from Kennedy to Andropov.[70] The memo indicates that the stated purpose of the communication was to \"'root out the threat of nuclear war', 'improve Soviet-American relations' and 'define the safety of the world'\". Chebrikov wrote that Kennedy was \"'very troubled by the current state of Soviet-American relations'\" and believed that the \"'only real threats to Reagan [were] problems of war and peace and Soviet-American relations'\". Chebrikov added that those issues, \"'according to the senator, will without a doubt become the most important of the [1984] election campaign'\".[71] Kennedy reportedly offered to visit Moscow \"'to arm Soviet officials with explanations regarding problems of nuclear disarmament so they may be better prepared and more convincing during appearances in the USA'\" and to set up U.S. television appearances for Andropov.[70]\n\nChebrikov also noted \"a little-hidden secret that [Kennedy] intended to run for president in 1988 and that the Democratic Party 'may officially turn to him to lead the fight against the Republicans' in 1984 \u2014 turning the proposal from one purely about international cooperation to one tinged with personal political aspiration.\"[71] Andropov was unimpressed by Kennedy's overtures.[72] After the Chebrikov memo was unearthed, both Tunney and a Kennedy spokesperson denied that it was true.[71]\n\nKennedy staged a high-profile trip to South Africa in January 1985.[73] He defied both the apartheid government's wishes and militant leftist AZAPO demonstrators by spending a night in the Soweto home of Bishop Desmond Tutu and also visited Winnie Mandela, wife of imprisoned black leader Nelson Mandela.[42] Upon returning, Kennedy became a leader in the push for economic sanctions against South Africa; collaborating with Senator Lowell Weicker, he secured Senate passage, and the overriding of Reagan's veto, of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986.[73] Despite their many political differences, Kennedy and Reagan had a good personal relationship,[74] and with the administration's approval Kennedy traveled to the Soviet Union in 1986 to act as a go-between in arms control negotiations with reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.[42] The discussions were productive, and Kennedy also helped gain the release of a number of Soviet Jewish refuseniks, including Anatoly Shcharansky.[75]\n\nSupreme Court Confirmations\n\nRobert Bork\n\nOne of Kennedy's biggest battles in the Senate came with Reagan's July 1987 nomination of Judge Robert Bork to the U.S. Supreme Court. Kennedy saw a possible Bork appointment as leading to a dismantling of civil rights law that he had helped put into place, and feared Bork's originalist judicial philosophy.[42] Kennedy's staff had researched Bork's writings and record, and within an hour of the nomination \u2013 which was initially expected to succeed \u2013 Kennedy went on the Senate floor to announce his opposition:\n\nRobert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the Government, and the doors of the Federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens ...[76]\n\nThe incendiary rhetoric of what became known as the \"Robert Bork's America\" speech enraged Bork supporters, who considered it slanderous, and worried some Democrats as well.[76] Bork responded, \"There was not a line in that speech that was accurate.\"[77] In 1988, an analysis published in the Western Political Quarterly of amicus curiae briefs filed by U.S. Solicitors General during the Warren and Burger Courts found that during Bork's tenure in the position during the Nixon and Ford Administrations (1973\u20131977), Bork took liberal positions in the aggregate as often as Thurgood Marshall did during the Johnson Administration (1965\u20131967) and more often than Wade H. McCree did during the Carter Administration (1977\u20131981), in part because Bork filed briefs in favor of the litigates in civil rights cases 75 percent of the time (contradicting a previous review of his civil rights record published in 1983).[78]\n\nHowever, the Reagan administration was unprepared for the assault, and the speech froze some Democrats from supporting the nomination and gave Kennedy and other Bork opponents time to prepare the case against him.[79] When the September 1987 Judiciary Committee hearings began, Kennedy challenged Bork forcefully on civil rights, privacy, women's rights, and other issues. Bork's own demeanor hurt him,[76] and the nomination was defeated both in committee and the full Senate.[42] The tone of the Bork battle changed the way Washington worked \u2013 with controversial nominees or candidates now experiencing all-out war waged against them \u2013 and the ramifications of it were still being felt decades later.[79]\n\nClarence Thomas\n\nBork and Clarence Thomas were the two most contentious Supreme Court nominations in United States history.[80] When the Thomas hearings began in September 1991, Kennedy pressed Thomas on his unwillingness to express an opinion about Roe v. Wade, but the nomination appeared headed for success.[81] When Anita Hill brought the sexual harassment charges against Thomas the following month, the nomination battle dominated public discourse. Kennedy was hamstrung by his past reputation and the ongoing developments in the William Kennedy Smith rape case.[82] He said almost nothing until the third day of the Thomas\u2013Hill hearings, and when he did it was criticized by Hill supporters for being too little, too late.\n\nBiographer Adam Clymer rated Kennedy's silence during the Thomas hearings as the worst moment of his Senate career. Writer Anna Quindlen said \"[Kennedy] let us down because he had to; he was muzzled by the facts of his life.\"[82] On the day before the full Senate vote, Kennedy gave an impassioned speech against Thomas, declaring that the treatment of Hill had been \"shameful\" and that \"[t]o give the benefit of the doubt to Judge Thomas is to say that Judge Thomas is more important than the Supreme Court.\"[83] He then voted against the nomination. Thomas was confirmed by a 52\u201348 vote, one of the narrowest margins ever for a successful nomination.[82]\n\nLion of the Senate\n\nDid you know? Ted Kennedy, younger brother of President John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy , was known as the \"The Lion of the Senate\" due to his long tenure and influence\n\nKennedy's role as a liberal lion in the Senate came to the fore in 1995, when the Republican Revolution took control and legislation intending to fulfill the Contract with America was coming from Newt Gingrich's House of Representatives. Many Democrats in the Senate and the country overall felt depressed but Kennedy rallied forces to combat the Republicans.[84] By the beginning of 1996, most of the Contract had failed to pass the Senate and the Democrats could once again move forward with legislation, almost all of it coming out of Kennedy's staff.[85]\n\nKennedy's official Senate portrait in the 1990s\n\nIn 1996, Kennedy secured an increase in the minimum wage, which was one of his favorite issues;[86] there would not be another increase for ten years.\n\nAfter the long, disputed post-presidential election battle in Florida in 2000, many Democrats in Congress did not want to work with incoming President George W. Bush. Kennedy, however, saw Bush as genuinely interested in a major overhaul of elementary and secondary education, Bush saw Kennedy as a potential major ally in the Senate, and the two partnered together on the legislation.[87] Kennedy accepted provisions governing mandatory student testing and teacher accountability that other Democrats and the National Education Association did not like, in return for increased funding levels for education. The No Child Left Behind Act was passed by Congress in May and June 2001 and signed into law by Bush in January 2002. Kennedy soon became disenchanted with the implementation of the act, however, saying for 2003 that it was $9 billion short of the $29 billion authorized. Kennedy said, \"The tragedy is that these long overdue reforms are finally in place, but the funds are not,\"[87] and accused Bush of not living up to his personal word on the matter. Other Democrats concluded that Kennedy's penchant for cross-party deals had gotten the better of him. The White House defended its spending levels given the context of two wars going on. He would continue his cross-party deals in the coming years.\n\nDespite the strained relationship between Kennedy and Bush over No Child Left Behind spending, the two attempted to work together again on extending Medicare to cover prescription drug benefits. Kennedy's strategy was again doubted by other Democrats, but he saw the proposed $400 billion program as an opportunity that should not be missed. However, when the final formulation of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act contained provisions to steer seniors towards private plans, Kennedy switched to opposing it. It passed in late 2003, and led Kennedy to again say he had been betrayed by the Bush administration.\n\nAfter Bush won a second term in the 2004 general election, Kennedy continued to oppose him on Iraq and many other issues. However, Kennedy sought to partner with Republicans again on the matter of immigration reform in the context of the ongoing United States immigration debate. Kennedy was chair of the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security, and Refugees, and in 2005, Kennedy teamed with Republican Senator John McCain on the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act. The \"McCain-Kennedy bill\" did not reach a Senate vote, but provided a template for further attempts at dealing comprehensively with legalization, guest worker programs, and border enforcement components. Kennedy returned again with the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was sponsored by an ideologically diverse, bipartisan group of senators[88] and had strong support from the Bush administration. The bill aroused furious grassroots opposition among talk radio listeners and others as an \"amnesty\" program,[89] and despite Kennedy's last-minute attempts to salvage it, failed a cloture vote in the Senate.[90] Kennedy was philosophical about the defeat, saying that it often took several attempts across multiple Congresses for this type of legislation to build enough momentum for passage.\n\nPortrait of Kennedy in the mid-2000s\n\nSupport for Obama\n\nFollowing his endorsement of Barack Obama , Kennedy staged a campaign appearance with Obama in Hartford, Connecticut, on February 4, 2008, the day before the Super Tuesday primaries.\n\nKennedy remained neutral as the 2008 Democratic nomination battle between Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama intensified, because his friend Chris Dodd was also running for the nomination.[91] The initial caucuses and primaries were split between Clinton and Obama. When Dodd withdrew from the race, Kennedy became dissatisfied with the tone of the Clinton campaign and what he saw as racially tinged remarks by Bill Clinton [92] Kennedy gave an endorsement to Obama on January 28, 2008, despite appeals by both Clintons not to do so.[93] In a move that was seen as a symbolic passing of the torch, Kennedy said that it was \"time again for a new generation of leadership,\" and compared Obama's ability to inspire with that of his fallen brothers.[92] In return, Kennedy gained a commitment from Obama to make universal health care a top priority of his administration if he were elected.[91] Kennedy's endorsement was considered among the most influential that any Democrat could get, and raised the possibility of improving Obama's vote-getting among unions, Hispanics, and traditional base Democrats.[93] It dominated the political news, and gave national exposure to a candidate who was still not well known in much of the country, as the Super Tuesday primaries across the nation approached.[94]\n\nIllness and death\n\nOn May 17, 2008, Kennedy suffered a seizure, which was followed by a second seizure as he was being rushed from the Kennedy Compound to Cape Cod Hospital and then by helicopter to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Within days, doctors announced that Kennedy had a malignant glioma, a type of cancerous brain tumor. The grim diagnosis brought reactions of shock and prayer from many senators of both parties and from President Bush.[95]\n\nKennedy speaks during the first night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado , while delegates hold signs reading \"KENNEDY\"\n\nKennedy made his first post-illness public appearance on July 9, when he surprised the Senate by showing up to supply the added vote to break a Republican filibuster against a bill to preserve Medicare fees for doctors.[96] In addition, Kennedy was ill from an attack of kidney stones. Against the advice of some associates,[97] he insisted on appearing during the first night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention on August 25, 2008, where a video tribute to him was played. Introduced by his niece Caroline Kennedy, the senator said, \"It is so wonderful to be here. Nothing \u2013 nothing \u2013 is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight.\" He then delivered a speech to the delegates (which he had to memorize, as his impaired vision left him unable to read a teleprompter) in which, reminiscent of his speech at the 1980 Democratic National Convention, he said, \"this November, the torch will be passed again to a new generation of Americans. So, with Barack Obama and for you and for me, our country will be committed to his cause. The work begins anew. The hope rises again. And the dream lives on.\"[98] The dramatic appearance and speech electrified the convention audience,[97] as Kennedy vowed that he would be present to see Obama inaugurated.[98]\n\nOn January 20, 2009, Kennedy attended Barack Obama's presidential inauguration, but then suffered a seizure at the luncheon immediately afterwards. He was taken by wheelchair from the Capitol building and then by ambulance to Washington Hospital Center. Doctors attributed the episode to \"simple fatigue.\" He was released from the hospital the following morning, and he returned to his home in Washington, D.C.[99]\n\nKennedy with President Obama, the day the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act was signed, April 21, 2009, four months before Kennedy's death\n\nWhen the 111th Congress began, Kennedy dropped his spot on the Senate Judiciary Committee to focus all his attentions on national health care issues, which he regarded as \"the cause of my life.\"[100] He saw the characteristics of the Obama administration and the Democratic majorities in Congress as representing the third and best great chance for universal health care, following the lost 1971 Nixon and 1993 Clinton opportunities, and as his last big legislative battle. He would not live to see the passage of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBasilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Boston\n\nFifteen months after he was initially diagnosed with brain cancer, Kennedy succumbed to the disease on August 25, 2009, at age 77 at his home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. In a statement, Kennedy's family said:\n\nWe've lost the irreplaceable center of our family and joyous light in our lives, but the inspiration of his faith, optimism, and perseverance will live on in our hearts forever. He loved this country and devoted his life to serving it.[101]\n\nWhen Kennedy died in August 2009, he was the second-most senior member of the Senate (after President pro tempore Robert Byrd of West Virginia) and the third longest-serving senator of all time, behind Byrd and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina.\n\nWhen the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act passed, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was instrumental in doing so, credited Kennedy's life work in her closing remarks on the House floor before the final vote. Kennedy's widow Vicki attended the signing of the Act, at which both she and President Obama wore blue \"Tedstrong\" bracelets.[102] Congressman Patrick Kennedy brought a copy of a national health insurance bill his father had introduced in 1970 as a gift for the president.[102] Patrick Kennedy then laid a note on his father's grave that said, \"Dad, the unfinished business is done.\"[103]\n\nLegacy\n\nDuring his tenure, Kennedy became one of the most recognizable and influential members of his party and was sometimes called a \"Democratic icon\"[104] as well as \"The Lion of the Senate\".[105] Kennedy and his Senate staff authored around 2,500 bills, of which more than 300 were enacted into law. Kennedy co-sponsored another 550 bills that became law after 1973. Kennedy was known for his effectiveness in dealing with Republican senators and administrations, sometimes to the irritation of other Democrats. During the 101st Congress under President George H. W. Bush, at least half of the successful proposals put forward by the Senate Democratic policy makers came out of Kennedy's Labor and Human Resources Committee.[106] During the 2000s, almost every bipartisan bill signed during the George W. Bush administration had significant involvement from Kennedy. A late 2000s survey of Republican senators ranked Kennedy first among Democrats in bipartisanship.[105] Kennedy strongly believed in the principle \"never let the perfect be the enemy of the good,\" and would agree to pass legislation he viewed as incomplete or imperfect with the goal of improving it down the road. In May 2008, soon-to-be Republican presidential nominee John McCain said, \"[Kennedy] is a legendary lawmaker and I have the highest respect for him. When we have worked together, he has been a skillful, fair and generous partner.\" Republican Governor of California and Kennedy relative by marriage Arnold Schwarzenegger described \"Uncle Teddy\" as \"a liberal icon, a warrior for the less fortunate, a fierce advocate for health-care reform, a champion of social justice here and abroad\" and \"the rock of his family\".[105]\n\nAfter Robert Kennedy's assassination in 1968, Ted was the most prominent living member of the Kennedy family and the last surviving son of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy. John F. Kennedy had said in 1957, \"Just as I went into politics because Joe died, if anything happened to me tomorrow, my brother Bobby would run for my seat in the Senate. And if Bobby died, Teddy would take over for him.\"[107] However, Ted was never able to carry on the \"Camelot\" mystique in the same way that both of his fallen brothers had, with much of it disappearing during his failed 1980 presidential bid. His negligence in the death of Mary Jo Kopechne at Chappaquiddick and his well-documented later personal problems further tarnished his image in relation to the Kennedy name,[1] and significantly damaged his chances of ever becoming president.[2][48] The Associated Press wrote that, \"Unlike his brothers, Edward M. Kennedy has grown old in public, his victories, defeats and human contradictions played out across the decades in the public glare.\"[108] But Kennedy's legislative accomplishments remained, and as The Boston Globe wrote, \"By the early 21st century, the achievements of the younger brother would be enough to rival those of many presidents.\"[1]\n\nKennedy's New York Times obituary described him via a character sketch: \"He was a Rabelaisian figure in the Senate and in life, instantly recognizable by his shock of white hair, his florid, oversize face, his booming Boston brogue, his powerful but pained stride. He was a celebrity, sometimes a self-parody, a hearty friend, an implacable foe, a man of large faith and large flaws, a melancholy character who persevered, drank deeply and sang loudly. He was a Kennedy.\"[2]\n\nAwards and honors\n\nSenator Kennedy received many awards and honors over the years. These include an honorary knighthood bestowed by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, the Order of the Aztec Eagle from Mexico, the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Order of the Merit of Chile, and honorary degrees from a number of institutions including Harvard University.\n\nWritings\n\nKennedy, Edward M.

His first opportunity came in 1946, when he ran for Congress. Although still physically weak from his war injuries, he campaigned aggressively, bypassing the Democratic organization in the Massachusetts 11th congressional district and depending instead upon his family, college friends, and fellow navy officers. In the Democratic primary he received nearly double the vote of his nearest opponent; in the November election he overwhelmed the Republican candidate. He was only 29.\n\nKennedy served three terms in the House of Representatives (1947\u201353) as a bread-and-butter liberal. He advocated better working conditions, more public housing, higher wages, lower prices, cheaper rents, and more Social Security for the aged. In foreign policy he was an early supporter of Cold War policies. He backed the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan but was sharply critical of the Truman administration\u2019s record in Asia. He accused the State Department of trying to force Chiang Kai-shek into a coalition with Mao Zedong. \u201cWhat our young men had saved,\u201d he told the House on January 25, 1949, \u201cour diplomats and our President have frittered away.\u201d\n\nHis congressional district in Boston was a safe seat, but Kennedy was too ambitious to remain long in the House of Representatives. In 1952 he ran for the U.S. Senate against the popular incumbent, Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. His mother and sisters Eunice, Patricia, and Jean held \u201cKennedy teas\u201d across the state. Thousands of volunteers flocked to help, including his 27-year-old brother Robert, who managed the campaign. That fall the Republican presidential candidate, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, carried Massachusetts by 208,000 votes; but Kennedy defeated Lodge by 70,000 votes. Less than a year later, on September 12, 1953, Kennedy enhanced his electoral appeal by marrying Jacqueline Lee Bouvier (Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis). Twelve years younger than Kennedy and from a socially prominent family, the beautiful \u201cJackie\u201d was the perfect complement to the handsome politician; they made a glamorous couple.\n\nAs a senator, Kennedy quickly won a reputation for responsiveness to requests from constituents, except on certain occasions when the national interest was at stake. In 1954 he was the only New England senator to approve an extension of President Eisenhower\u2019s reciprocal-trade powers, and he vigorously backed the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway, despite the fact that over a period of 20 years no Massachusetts senator or congressman had ever voted for it.\n\nTo the disappointment of liberal Democrats, Kennedy soft-pedaled the demagogic excesses of Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin, who in the early 1950s conducted witch-hunting campaigns against government workers accused of being communists. Kennedy\u2019s father liked McCarthy, contributed to his campaign, and even entertained him in the family\u2019s compound at Hyannis Port on Cape Cod in Massachusetts. Kennedy himself disapproved of McCarthy, but, as he once observed, \u201cHalf my people in Massachusetts look on McCarthy as a hero.\u201d Yet, on the Senate vote over condemnation of McCarthy\u2019s conduct (1954), Kennedy expected to vote against him. He prepared a speech explaining why, but he was absent on the day of the vote. Later, at a National Press Club Gridiron dinner, costumed reporters sang, \u201cWhere were you, John, where were you, John, when the Senate censured Joe?\u201d Actually, John had been in a hospital, in critical condition after back surgery. For six months afterward he lay strapped to a board in his father\u2019s house in Palm Beach, Florida. It was during this period that he worked on Profiles in Courage (1956), an account of eight great American political leaders who had defied popular opinion in matters of conscience, which was awarded a Pulitzer Prize in 1957. Although Kennedy was credited as the book\u2019s author, it was later revealed that his assistant Theodore Sorensen had done much of the research and writing.\n\nBack in the Senate, Kennedy led a fight against a proposal to abolish the electoral college, crusaded for labour reform, and became increasingly committed to civil rights legislation.
