{"Matt Striebel was born on October 15, 1978.": [{"url": "https://www.usalaxmagazine.com/usa-insider/senior-men/hall-of-fame-call-a-final-victory-for-the-versatile-matt-striebel", "page_content": "Nine lacrosse legends \u2014 Ryan Boyle, Charlie Coker, Kara Ariza Cooke, Rachael Becker DeCecco, Sarah Forbes, Cathy Reese, Paul Schimoler, Richard Speckmann and Matt Striebel \u2014 will be inducted into the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame Oct. 19 at The Grand Lodge in Hunt Valley, Md. These are their stories.\n\nMatt Striebel was out to lunch with his wife and two kids, and then he saw his phone ring. He didn\u2019t recognize the number, so he let it go straight to voicemail, as one does.\n\nThe message, he quickly realized, was from US Lacrosse. It was right around the annual giving time for the men\u2019s national team, Striebel said, so he called back to let them know his check was ready to be sent out.\n\nBut on the other line was Rick Lake, men's game senior manager at US Lacrosse. His message was a tad different.\n\n\u201cHe goes, \u2018Matt, we're actually calling you to let you know made the Hall of Fame,\u2019\u201d the Gill, Mass., native recalled. \u201cIt was an amazing moment that was made doubly better that I found out I was going in with Ryan (Boyle). As soon as I hung up that phone call, I called Ryan and was like, \u2018This is crazy. Can you believe it?\u2019 It was the perfect, poetic bookend to a journey of our playing careers.\u201d\n\n\"We tried to coexist for two games, then I went into the coach's office and they basically looked at me and said \u2018Striebs, it's been a great run. How about you try midfield?\" \u2014 Matt Striebel describing a meeting Bill Tierney his senior year.\n\nStriebel is one of nine set for the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame\u2019s Class of 2019, entering with his close friend, Boyle \u2014 a fellow champion at Princeton, with the U.S. national team and in Major League Lacrosse. They now work together at Trilogy Lacrosse, the company Boyle co-founded, though their roots extend back to 2001 at Princeton.\n\nThe Tigers, then coached by fellow Hall of Fame member Bill Tierney, had Boyle entering as a blue-chip recruit down on attack. Striebel, a captain and returning All-American on attack, was excited by playing with a player of his quality. Plans went another direction, though.\n\n\u201cWe tried to coexist for two games, then I went into the coach's office and they basically looked at me and said \u2018Striebs, it's been a great run. How about you try midfield?,\u2019\u201d said Striebel, who gave himself 24 hours to sulk before embracing his new role.\n\n\u201cI decided it's my senior year, I really want to win and am here to win a national championship. From a lacrosse standpoint, it's the best thing that could have happened to me, because I am more of a midfielder talent-wise and it made us a better team and opened opportunities on the U.S. team and as a professional.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not hyperbole from Striebel, either. That 2001 season marked Striebel\u2019s second national championship while at Princeton, as well as a fourth straight Ivy League championship. On the national stage, he captured gold at the World Lacrosse championships in 2002 (Perth) and 2010 (Manchester), plus silver in 2006 (Ontario).\n\nStriebel also secured three MLL championships (2004, \u201806, \u201807) with the Philadelphia Barrage, earning earning MLL All-Star honors on nine occasions. Boyle was right there at nearly every step.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m far happier for him than I am for myself,\u201d Boyle said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI often say there are some guys out there who are A-plus in a couple categories. Oh, he's an A-plus shooter or an A-plus dodger,\u201d Striebel began. \u201cFor me, I think I just had the versatility to be B-plus, A-minus guy in a lot of different categories. That allowed me to change and adapt my game as I got older.\n\n\u201cThe first 10 years I was in the MLL, I think I took one two-point shot and it was on an open goal when we needed goal differential for the playoffs. Then as I got older, like a basketball player who's adding a different aspect, I became more of a shooter so I could develop other parts of my game and maintain relevance as a player.\u201d\n\nBut like most great players, Striebel\u2019s connection with the game didn\u2019t cease once he put away the pads and cleats. He\u2019s spent the last seven years coaching at Northampton High School in Massachusetts, plus working for Trilogy. He\u2019s especially close with coaches in the Colonial Athletic Association, so he\u2019ll often swing by nearby UMass-Amherst to catch games and chat with old friends.\n\nThose experiences also remind Striebel of his time at Hotchkiss, in Lakeville, Conn., during the mid-1990s. He said that was the \u201cdawn of the post-graduate lacrosse era\u201d at New England prep schools, where he played alongside several NHL draft picks.\n\n\u201cYou had kids who played multiple sports at a very high level,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cThere were great athletes and for better or for worse, lacrosse has become a 365-day endeavor where kids have an opportunity to play every day.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.gazettenet.com/Matt-Striebel-will-be-inducted-into-National-Lacrosse-Hall-of-Fame-29390368", "page_content": "Lacrosse began as a hobby for Matt Striebel.\n\nHis sister, Jessica, played first and brought her stick home. He was a baseball fan and dreamed of becoming a major leaguer.\n\n\u201cLike every kid in America,\u201d the Northampton resident said.\n\nIntrigued, the Gill native started playing as a teenager for the Franklin County Lacrosse Club for Jeff Coulson, who now owns Indoor Action Sports in Greenfield.\n\n\u201cGrowing up here in western Mass., and I grew up in Gill, which was obviously not a hotbed of lacrosse at the time or really now. It\u2019s such a dynamic combination of other sports you\u2019re familiar growing up with,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cYou get the best of all those worlds combined in one Frankenstein sport. For a lot of kids, and I see this all the time at camps, it just grabs you, and once it does you\u2019re hooked for life.\u201d\n\nLacrosse became Striebel\u2019s passion and profession. He won championships at every level and worked to spread the spark lacrosse ignited in him. On Saturday, Striebel, 40, will earn one of the sport\u2019s highest honors with his induction to the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame.\n\n\u201cAt a certain point, I\u2019d had a career that was solid enough and significant enough that I had a pretty good idea that I would one day make it to the Hall of Fame. The part that was surprising to me was how quickly I got that call,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cIt was a validating honor. It puts your career in a nice, cohesive narrative.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019ll be inducted as part of a nine-member class at the The Grand Lodge in Hunt Valley, Maryland, just outside Baltimore.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s increasingly starting to set in. There\u2019s some behind the scenes getting tickets for people and organizing all that stuff that makes it seem like it\u2019s more in the real world and less something that\u2019s really special and exists as the culmination of a career,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cIt\u2019s sitting in a space that\u2019s between about to be real and pretty fantastic.\u201d\n\nStriebel received the call while out to lunch with his family at Green Bean in Northampton. It came from a Philadelphia number he didn\u2019t recognize, so he let it go to voice mail. Rick Lake, the men\u2019s lacrosse director of USA Lacrosse, was on the other end of the call.\n\n\u201cMy immediate assumption was they were calling because the annual giving campaigns had started up,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cAs a veteran of three U.S. teams, they look to me to give donations every once in a while and I assumed that\u2019s what it was.\u201d\n\nInstead, he found out he was being inducted alongside one of his longtime teammates and best friends Ryan Boyle. Boyle was a freshman at Princeton during Striebel\u2019s senior year in 2001. They both played attack, but Boyle took all of the repetitions during fall practices since Striebel also played soccer for the Tigers.\n\nAs a returning All-American and team captain, Striebel tried to coexist with the freshman.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty apparent that Ryan was just better at it than I was, even as a freshman,\u201d said Striebel, who attended The Hotchkiss School before Princeton. \u201cThe coaches brought me into their office and said, \u2018Striebs you had a great run, we\u2019re going to move you to midfield.\u2019 For about 48 hours, I hated Ryan.\u201d\n\nBut he realized that if the team was going to compete for a title, that would give the Tigers the best chance. Princeton won the national championship for the second time in Striebel\u2019s career.\n\nStriebel began his professional career the next season during the inaugural season of Major League Lacrosse. He played for the Bridgeport Barrage, and three years later after the franchise relocated to Philadelphia, they asked Striebel if Boyle was worth a first-round draft pick.\n\n\u201cI said he was and it would make our team better instantly,\u201d Striebel said.\n\nThe Barrage won the MLL title, one of three in Striebel\u2019s 15-year career. He and Boyle also played together for the USA on three World Lacrosse Championship teams.\n\nBoyle started a company called Trinity Lacrosse in 2005 and brought Striebel on as the program\u2019s national director, which is his full-time job. They run camps and events all over the country.\n\n\u201cThe fact that I was able to go in with Ryan, that\u2019s such a poetic bookend to our career and our friendship in the sport,\u201d Striebel said.\n\nStriebel was first called up to the U.S. national team in 2002, less than a year after the September 11 terrorist attacks. The Americans took gold in Perth, Australia.\n\n\u201cTo be able to put on a jersey and represent your country playing a sport you love, there aren\u2019t many honors that are more fulfilling than that,\u201d Striebel said.\n\nHe enjoyed teaming up with other elite players in a competitive setting. Unlike All-star games, which Striebel played in eight times, the world championships provided a goal to achieve rather than an exhibition.\n\nWhen the U.S. lost the 2006 final \u2013 the first time they hadn\u2019t won gold since 1978 \u2013 Striebel and his team left their medals in the dormitories in Ontario.\n\n\u201cIt was a really difficult loss to stomach,\u201d he said.\n\nStriebel and the USA redeemed themselves in 2010 in England with the nation\u2019s ninth gold medal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate enough to win a lot of incredible championships in my career, and those USA championships are definitely up there,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a fortunate career.\u201d\n\nHe recognizes that fortune and works to give others the same opportunity. Striebel coached Northampton High School for seven years before stepping down following the 2018 season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate enough to go all over the country and around the world spreading the gospel of lacrosse and sharing the sport with people who care about it,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cIt has a strong fraternity of followers. It\u2019s been amazing to see that expand to include so many people and so many places.\u201d\n\nTrilogy partners with organizations like Harlem Lacrosse to bring the game to areas and environments that haven\u2019t historically played it.\n\n\u201cFor many years it\u2019s been a predominantly white, wealthy, preppy sport, and that\u2019s not sustainable and that\u2019s not the best version of lacrosse that\u2019s going to exist,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cWhen the sport is available to kids all across the country whether you\u2019re living in an inner city neighborhood or Fairfield County, Connecticut, that\u2019s when the sport is really going to have achieved its peak.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.usalacrosse.com/player-profile/matthew-striebel", "page_content": "Striebel was inducted as a truly great player.

He was also a part of four Ivy League championships, and earned All-Ivy honors three times (1999, 2000, 2001).\n\nStriebel played on three U.S. National Teams, helping to claim world championships in 2002 and 2010, and a runner-up finish in 2006.

In MLL offseasons, Striebel played three years of professional soccer from 2002-04 for the Western Massachusetts Pioneers of the USL Second Division.\n\n\u201cHis fitness level was just off the charts,\u201d said former Philadelphia Barrage head coach Tony Resch. \u201cHe could keep going and going. He had great speed. He could shoot it. Unselfish. All the things you look for in a midfielder, he had it.\u201d\n\nWhile Resch and most fans may remember Striebel as a lights-out shooter, that wasn\u2019t always the case. Prior to his senior year at Princeton, Striebel was an X attackman. When freshman Ryan Boyle stepped on campus, Striebel was moved above GLE \u2013 where, Boyle jokes, his shot couldn\u2019t break a paper bag.\n\n\u201cHe completely reinvented himself, starting with his senior year at Princeton moving from behind the cage out in front to midfield,\u201d said Boyle, who also played with Striebel on the Philadelphia Barrage. \u201cHis dedication to his craft is truly remarkable. Going from somebody who didn\u2019t really have much range to speak of at all to being somebody who you had to pick up at 16 yards\u2026 he was unguardable.\u201d\n\nThat work ethic led to a 171-game career. Striebel evolved to earn playing time on the \u201804 Barrage midfield unit featuring Blake Miller (46G, 11A), Roy Colsey (25G, 6T, 7A), Mike Mollot (11G, 8A), and Doug Shanahan (12G, 6A).\n\nStriebel stuck the eventual game-winning goal in the \u201804 MLL Championship for that Barrage squad.

He starred as a member of the Princeton Tigers men's lacrosse team from 1998 through 2001 and the Princeton Tigers men's soccer team from 1997 through 2000.\n\nDuring his time at Princeton, the team qualified for the NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship all four years, reached the championship game three times, won the championship game twice and won four Ivy League championships. He was a two-time honorable mention United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) All-American and three-time All-Ivy League selection (once first team, twice second team). He was also an All-Ivy league performer in soccer and earned Princeton co-athlete of the year (all-sport) honors as a senior.\n\nAs a professional, he has earned three MLL championships, a league record eight MLL All-Star recognitions and an MLL championship game MVP award. He is also a three-time Team USA representative and two-time World Lacrosse Championship gold medalist.\n\nBackground\n\nStriebel is a native of Gill, Massachusetts. He first got involved in lacrosse at about the age of 12 or 13 when his sister brought home the Brine Lightning stick that he began to play with. Striebel attended The Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut. Striebel first started playing lacrosse when he was a youth for Jeff Coulson, owner of Indoor Action Sports, in Greenfield, Massachusetts.\n\nHe also attended the Writers Workshop at The University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa, earning a Master of Fine Arts degree in 2007. He had earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English at Princeton.\n\nCollege career\n\nAt Princeton he was a two-time honorable mention USILA All-American Team selection in 2000 and 2001. He was a second team All-Ivy League selection in 1999 and 2000 and a first team selection in 2001. He was a 2001 USILA Scholar All-American. During his four-year career, Princeton went undefeated in Ivy League Conference play with consecutive 6\u20130 records. Princeton was invited to the 1999 tournament, was a finalist in the 2000 tournament and earned championships in both the 1998 and 2001 tournaments, bringing the schools consecutive tournament invitations streak to twelve. In Striebel's 2001 senior season, the arrival of freshman Ryan Boyle necessitated that he move from attack to midfield. The move came the first practice after Princeton's 14\u20138 loss to Syracuse. Striebel had previously been orchestrating the Princeton offense from behind the goal, but on March 25, 2001, head coach Bill Tierney made the switch. During the 1998 season when Princeton won the NCAA title, Striebel had been playing midfield. Princeton went undefeated for the rest of the 2001 season after the switch.\n\nDuring the 2000 NCAA tournament, Striebel scored two goals in the quarterfinals 10\u20137 victory against Maryland, and he added another in the 13\u20137 championship game loss to Syracuse. Striebel was one of the leading scorers on the team that season, and he was the team leader in assists entering the final four weekend. In the quarterfinals of the 2001 NCAA championship tournament, Striebel had an assist in the 8\u20137 victory over Loyola.

As a junior, Striebel was a member of the 1999 Ivy League Champion Princeton Soccer team that earned an invitation to the 1999 NCAA Men's Division I Soccer Championship. The team posted a 10\u20135\u20132 (5\u20131\u20131 Ivy League) record.\n\nAs of 2010, Striebel ranks eighth on the Princeton Lacrosse career assists list and eleventh on the Princeton soccer career assists list. As a senior, he was honored as one of the three athletes of the year on campus (along with Dennis Norman and Scott Denbo)\n\nProfessional career\n\nStriebel began his career in the league's inaugural 2001 MLL season with the Bridgeport Barrage and stayed with the team as it remained in Bridgeport, Connecticut until the 2003 season.

In 2009 MLL season, he joined the Chicago Machine and then became a member of the Rochester Rattlers for the 2011 MLL season. Striebel and Boyle were reunited for five seasons in Philadelphia. Striebel has helped the Barrage to win three Steinfeld Cup championships in 2004, 2006, and 2007.

In MLL offseasons, Striebel played three years of professional soccer from 2002-04 for the Western Massachusetts Pioneers of the USL Second Division.\n\n\u201cHis fitness level was just off the charts,\u201d said former Philadelphia Barrage head coach Tony Resch. \u201cHe could keep going and going. He had great speed. He could shoot it. Unselfish. All the things you look for in a midfielder, he had it.\u201d\n\nWhile Resch and most fans may remember Striebel as a lights-out shooter, that wasn\u2019t always the case. Prior to his senior year at Princeton, Striebel was an X attackman. When freshman Ryan Boyle stepped on campus, Striebel was moved above GLE \u2013 where, Boyle jokes, his shot couldn\u2019t break a paper bag.\n\n\u201cHe completely reinvented himself, starting with his senior year at Princeton moving from behind the cage out in front to midfield,\u201d said Boyle, who also played with Striebel on the Philadelphia Barrage. \u201cHis dedication to his craft is truly remarkable. Going from somebody who didn\u2019t really have much range to speak of at all to being somebody who you had to pick up at 16 yards\u2026 he was unguardable.\u201d\n\nThat work ethic led to a 171-game career. Striebel evolved to earn playing time on the \u201804 Barrage midfield unit featuring Blake Miller (46G, 11A), Roy Colsey (25G, 6T, 7A), Mike Mollot (11G, 8A), and Doug Shanahan (12G, 6A).\n\nStriebel stuck the eventual game-winning goal in the \u201804 MLL Championship for that Barrage squad.

These are their stories.\n\nMatt Striebel was out to lunch with his wife and two kids, and then he saw his phone ring. He didn\u2019t recognize the number, so he let it go straight to voicemail, as one does.\n\nThe message, he quickly realized, was from US Lacrosse. It was right around the annual giving time for the men\u2019s national team, Striebel said, so he called back to let them know his check was ready to be sent out.\n\nBut on the other line was Rick Lake, men's game senior manager at US Lacrosse. His message was a tad different.\n\n\u201cHe goes, \u2018Matt, we're actually calling you to let you know made the Hall of Fame,\u2019\u201d the Gill, Mass., native recalled. \u201cIt was an amazing moment that was made doubly better that I found out I was going in with Ryan (Boyle). As soon as I hung up that phone call, I called Ryan and was like, \u2018This is crazy. Can you believe it?\u2019 It was the perfect, poetic bookend to a journey of our playing careers.\u201d\n\n\"We tried to coexist for two games, then I went into the coach's office and they basically looked at me and said \u2018Striebs, it's been a great run. How about you try midfield?\" \u2014 Matt Striebel describing a meeting Bill Tierney his senior year.\n\nStriebel is one of nine set for the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame\u2019s Class of 2019, entering with his close friend, Boyle \u2014 a fellow champion at Princeton, with the U.S. national team and in Major League Lacrosse. They now work together at Trilogy Lacrosse, the company Boyle co-founded, though their roots extend back to 2001 at Princeton.\n\nThe Tigers, then coached by fellow Hall of Fame member Bill Tierney, had Boyle entering as a blue-chip recruit down on attack. Striebel, a captain and returning All-American on attack, was excited by playing with a player of his quality. Plans went another direction, though.\n\n\u201cWe tried to coexist for two games, then I went into the coach's office and they basically looked at me and said \u2018Striebs, it's been a great run. How about you try midfield?,\u2019\u201d said Striebel, who gave himself 24 hours to sulk before embracing his new role.\n\n\u201cI decided it's my senior year, I really want to win and am here to win a national championship. From a lacrosse standpoint, it's the best thing that could have happened to me, because I am more of a midfielder talent-wise and it made us a better team and opened opportunities on the U.S. team and as a professional.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not hyperbole from Striebel, either. That 2001 season marked Striebel\u2019s second national championship while at Princeton, as well as a fourth straight Ivy League championship. On the national stage, he captured gold at the World Lacrosse championships in 2002 (Perth) and 2010 (Manchester), plus silver in 2006 (Ontario).\n\nStriebel also secured three MLL championships (2004, \u201806, \u201807) with the Philadelphia Barrage, earning earning MLL All-Star honors on nine occasions. Boyle was right there at nearly every step.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m far happier for him than I am for myself,\u201d Boyle said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI often say there are some guys out there who are A-plus in a couple categories. Oh, he's an A-plus shooter or an A-plus dodger,\u201d Striebel began. \u201cFor me, I think I just had the versatility to be B-plus, A-minus guy in a lot of different categories. That allowed me to change and adapt my game as I got older.\n\n\u201cThe first 10 years I was in the MLL, I think I took one two-point shot and it was on an open goal when we needed goal differential for the playoffs. Then as I got older, like a basketball player who's adding a different aspect, I became more of a shooter so I could develop other parts of my game and maintain relevance as a player.\u201d\n\nBut like most great players, Striebel\u2019s connection with the game didn\u2019t cease once he put away the pads and cleats. He\u2019s spent the last seven years coaching at Northampton High School in Massachusetts, plus working for Trilogy. He\u2019s especially close with coaches in the Colonial Athletic Association, so he\u2019ll often swing by nearby UMass-Amherst to catch games and chat with old friends.\n\nThose experiences also remind Striebel of his time at Hotchkiss, in Lakeville, Conn., during the mid-1990s. He said that was the \u201cdawn of the post-graduate lacrosse era\u201d at New England prep schools, where he played alongside several NHL draft picks.\n\n\u201cYou had kids who played multiple sports at a very high level,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cThere were great athletes and for better or for worse, lacrosse has become a 365-day endeavor where kids have an opportunity to play every day.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.gazettenet.com/Matt-Striebel-will-be-inducted-into-National-Lacrosse-Hall-of-Fame-29390368", "page_content": "Lacrosse began as a hobby for Matt Striebel.\n\nHis sister, Jessica, played first and brought her stick home. He was a baseball fan and dreamed of becoming a major leaguer.\n\n\u201cLike every kid in America,\u201d the Northampton resident said.\n\nIntrigued, the Gill native started playing as a teenager for the Franklin County Lacrosse Club for Jeff Coulson, who now owns Indoor Action Sports in Greenfield.\n\n\u201cGrowing up here in western Mass., and I grew up in Gill, which was obviously not a hotbed of lacrosse at the time or really now. It\u2019s such a dynamic combination of other sports you\u2019re familiar growing up with,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cYou get the best of all those worlds combined in one Frankenstein sport. For a lot of kids, and I see this all the time at camps, it just grabs you, and once it does you\u2019re hooked for life.\u201d\n\nLacrosse became Striebel\u2019s passion and profession. He won championships at every level and worked to spread the spark lacrosse ignited in him. On Saturday, Striebel, 40, will earn one of the sport\u2019s highest honors with his induction to the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame.\n\n\u201cAt a certain point, I\u2019d had a career that was solid enough and significant enough that I had a pretty good idea that I would one day make it to the Hall of Fame. The part that was surprising to me was how quickly I got that call,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cIt was a validating honor. It puts your career in a nice, cohesive narrative.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019ll be inducted as part of a nine-member class at the The Grand Lodge in Hunt Valley, Maryland, just outside Baltimore.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s increasingly starting to set in. There\u2019s some behind the scenes getting tickets for people and organizing all that stuff that makes it seem like it\u2019s more in the real world and less something that\u2019s really special and exists as the culmination of a career,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cIt\u2019s sitting in a space that\u2019s between about to be real and pretty fantastic.\u201d\n\nStriebel received the call while out to lunch with his family at Green Bean in Northampton. It came from a Philadelphia number he didn\u2019t recognize, so he let it go to voice mail. Rick Lake, the men\u2019s lacrosse director of USA Lacrosse, was on the other end of the call.\n\n\u201cMy immediate assumption was they were calling because the annual giving campaigns had started up,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cAs a veteran of three U.S. teams, they look to me to give donations every once in a while and I assumed that\u2019s what it was.\u201d\n\nInstead, he found out he was being inducted alongside one of his longtime teammates and best friends Ryan Boyle. Boyle was a freshman at Princeton during Striebel\u2019s senior year in 2001. They both played attack, but Boyle took all of the repetitions during fall practices since Striebel also played soccer for the Tigers.\n\nAs a returning All-American and team captain, Striebel tried to coexist with the freshman.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty apparent that Ryan was just better at it than I was, even as a freshman,\u201d said Striebel, who attended The Hotchkiss School before Princeton. \u201cThe coaches brought me into their office and said, \u2018Striebs you had a great run, we\u2019re going to move you to midfield.\u2019 For about 48 hours, I hated Ryan.\u201d\n\nBut he realized that if the team was going to compete for a title, that would give the Tigers the best chance. Princeton won the national championship for the second time in Striebel\u2019s career.\n\nStriebel began his professional career the next season during the inaugural season of Major League Lacrosse. He played for the Bridgeport Barrage, and three years later after the franchise relocated to Philadelphia, they asked Striebel if Boyle was worth a first-round draft pick.\n\n\u201cI said he was and it would make our team better instantly,\u201d Striebel said.\n\nThe Barrage won the MLL title, one of three in Striebel\u2019s 15-year career. He and Boyle also played together for the USA on three World Lacrosse Championship teams.\n\nBoyle started a company called Trinity Lacrosse in 2005 and brought Striebel on as the program\u2019s national director, which is his full-time job. They run camps and events all over the country.\n\n\u201cThe fact that I was able to go in with Ryan, that\u2019s such a poetic bookend to our career and our friendship in the sport,\u201d Striebel said.\n\nStriebel was first called up to the U.S. national team in 2002, less than a year after the September 11 terrorist attacks. The Americans took gold in Perth, Australia.\n\n\u201cTo be able to put on a jersey and represent your country playing a sport you love, there aren\u2019t many honors that are more fulfilling than that,\u201d Striebel said.\n\nHe enjoyed teaming up with other elite players in a competitive setting. Unlike All-star games, which Striebel played in eight times, the world championships provided a goal to achieve rather than an exhibition.\n\nWhen the U.S. lost the 2006 final \u2013 the first time they hadn\u2019t won gold since 1978 \u2013 Striebel and his team left their medals in the dormitories in Ontario.\n\n\u201cIt was a really difficult loss to stomach,\u201d he said.\n\nStriebel and the USA redeemed themselves in 2010 in England with the nation\u2019s ninth gold medal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate enough to win a lot of incredible championships in my career, and those USA championships are definitely up there,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a fortunate career.\u201d\n\nHe recognizes that fortune and works to give others the same opportunity. Striebel coached Northampton High School for seven years before stepping down following the 2018 season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate enough to go all over the country and around the world spreading the gospel of lacrosse and sharing the sport with people who care about it,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cIt has a strong fraternity of followers. It\u2019s been amazing to see that expand to include so many people and so many places.\u201d\n\nTrilogy partners with organizations like Harlem Lacrosse to bring the game to areas and environments that haven\u2019t historically played it.\n\n\u201cFor many years it\u2019s been a predominantly white, wealthy, preppy sport, and that\u2019s not sustainable and that\u2019s not the best version of lacrosse that\u2019s going to exist,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cWhen the sport is available to kids all across the country whether you\u2019re living in an inner city neighborhood or Fairfield County, Connecticut, that\u2019s when the sport is really going to have achieved its peak.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/matt-striebel/", "page_content": "Matt Striebel (born January 12, 1979) is a high school lacrosse coach at Northampton High School and a professional lacrosse midfielder who plays professional field lacrosse in the Major League Lacrosse (MLL) for the New York Lizards and formerly played professional box lacrosse in the National Lacrosse League (NLL).

He is also a three-time Team USA representative and two-time World Lacrosse Championship gold medalist.\n\nBackground\n\nStriebel is a native of Gill, Massachusetts. He first got involved in lacrosse at about the age of 12 or 13 when his sister brought home the Brine Lightning stick that he began to play with. Striebel attended The Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut. Striebel first started playing lacrosse when he was a youth for Jeff Coulson, owner of Indoor Action Sports, in Greenfield, Massachusetts.\n\nHe also attended the Writers Workshop at The University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa, earning a Master of Fine Arts degree in 2007. He had earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English at Princeton.\n\nCollege career\n\nAt Princeton he was a two-time honorable mention USILA All-American Team selection in 2000 and 2001. He was a second team All-Ivy League selection in 1999 and 2000 and a first team selection in 2001. He was a 2001 USILA Scholar All-American. During his four-year career, Princeton went undefeated in Ivy League Conference play with consecutive 6\u20130 records. Princeton was invited to the 1999 tournament, was a finalist in the 2000 tournament and earned championships in both the 1998 and 2001 tournaments, bringing the schools consecutive tournament invitations streak to twelve. In Striebel's 2001 senior season, the arrival of freshman Ryan Boyle necessitated that he move from attack to midfield. The move came the first practice after Princeton's 14\u20138 loss to Syracuse. Striebel had previously been orchestrating the Princeton offense from behind the goal, but on March 25, 2001, head coach Bill Tierney made the switch. During the 1998 season when Princeton won the NCAA title, Striebel had been playing midfield. Princeton went undefeated for the rest of the 2001 season after the switch.\n\nDuring the 2000 NCAA tournament, Striebel scored two goals in the quarterfinals 10\u20137 victory against Maryland, and he added another in the 13\u20137 championship game loss to Syracuse. Striebel was one of the leading scorers on the team that season, and he was the team leader in assists entering the final four weekend. In the quarterfinals of the 2001 NCAA championship tournament, Striebel had an assist in the 8\u20137 victory over Loyola. In the 12\u201311 semifinal victory over Towson State, Striebel had a goal and an assist. Striebel scored twice in the 2001 championship game and also added two assists. He was selected to the All-tournament team.\n\nStriebel was also an honorable mention All-Ivy League soccer player in 2000 as well as a 2000 Academic All-Ivy selection in soccer. As a junior, Striebel was a member of the 1999 Ivy League Champion Princeton Soccer team that earned an invitation to the 1999 NCAA Men's Division I Soccer Championship. The team posted a 10\u20135\u20132 (5\u20131\u20131 Ivy League) record.\n\nAs of 2010, Striebel ranks eighth on the Princeton Lacrosse career assists list and eleventh on the Princeton soccer career assists list. As a senior, he was honored as one of the three athletes of the year on campus (along with Dennis Norman and Scott Denbo)\n\nProfessional career\n\nStriebel began his career in the league's inaugural 2001 MLL season with the Bridgeport Barrage and stayed with the team as it remained in Bridgeport, Connecticut until the 2003 season. Then he moved with the franchise and played with the Philadelphia Barrage from 2004 through 2008. In 2009 MLL season, he joined the Chicago Machine and then became a member of the Rochester Rattlers for the 2011 MLL season. Striebel and Boyle were reunited for five seasons in Philadelphia. Striebel has helped the Barrage to win three Steinfeld Cup championships in 2004, 2006, and 2007. In the 2004 championship game, he scored what the Baltimore Sun described as the clinching goal in the 13\u201311 victory over the Boston Cannons. In the 2006 game, he had nine points (four goals, including one two-pointer and four assists). He was presented with the 2007 Steinfeld Cup Game Most Valuable Player Award. Striebel appeared in the 2005 & 2007 Major League Lacrosse All-Star Games. In the 2006 All-Star game he represented Team USA by scoring a goal and two assists. Striebel was an MLL All-Pro selection in 2007 and 2008. Striebel was an MLL All-Star in 2011. In 2012, Striebel set the MLL record for most All-Star games with eight (consecutive).\n\nStriebel served as an assistant coach for Princeton Men's Lacrosse in 2005. Striebel also spent time assisting the men's lacrosse team at Iowa during his time there. As of 12 April 2012, Striebel currently coaches the Varsity Boys Lacrosse team at Northampton High School in Northampton, MA which is just south of his hometown. He also played professionally in 2012 and 2013.\n\nIn addition to his field lacrosse career, Striebel played one season in 2003 of box lacrosse with the Philadelphia Wings in the National Lacrosse League. Streibel was traded by the Wings to the New York Saints in February 2003. He never appeared in a game for the Saints.

Although the brothers had little idea of what was happening on the field, they fell in love with the game and have played ever since.\n\nBut the game that\u2019s become one of his life\u2019s passions is likely not a topic Wall brings up much in conversation.\n\n\u201cWhenever I meet someone new, I never tell them I\u2019m a lacrosse player first,\u201d Wall said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate it has to be that way, but it is.\u201d\n\nWall is more likely to tell an acquaintance he\u2019s a theatre technician or an artist. He wants to avoid being slapped with the \u201clax bro\u201d stereotype: the neon-pinnie wearing, cheap-beer drinking meathead image many still attach to the game.\n\nThe Blue Devils\u2019 junior goalie could not be further from that dumb jock character. It wasn\u2019t partying or the lax-bro culture that attracted him to the game. Rather, Wall said both in lacrosse and in art, which he wants to study in college, the \u201cprocess-oriented\u201d path to success appealed to him.\n\n\u201cOne thing that you always struggle with in life is being goal-oriented, worried about where you end up, if you end up with a lot of money, going to a good school, these various things that people will look at you and judge you based on whatever that is,\u201d Wall said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve struggled with as well, I\u2019ve had to work really hard to not do that.\u201d\n\n***\n\nWall\u2019s coach at Northampton, Matt Striebel, understands well that instinct to hide the fact that he\u2019s a lacrosse player from others. Striebel is a 14-year veteran of Major League Lacrosse, and his career has taken him to four different franchises from Philadephia to Chicago.\n\nWhen Striebel has travelled for games, he said strangers in airports with no knowledge of the rules or the strategy of the game know two things about lacrosse: They know about Duke, and they know about Yeardley Love.\n\nIn 2006, three members of the Duke lacrosse team were arrested and accused of raping Crystal Mangum, who was hired as a stripper at a team party. The players were ultimately found not guilty, but their behavior in the high profile case brought up questions about class, race relations and the school\u2019s athletic culture.\n\nSix years later, University of Virginia lacrosse player George Huguely was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 23 years in prison for killing his ex-girlfriend, Yeardley Love, in another case that drew international media attention.\n\nThe vast majority of lacrosse players don\u2019t exhibit the behavior that has brought the sport its negative reputation, but the actions of a few have perpetuated the stereotype of the game as a country club sport \u2013 a hobby to keep rich, white, entitled kids from getting bored.\n\n\u201cLacrosse players get negative reputations in a lot of places because of negative behavior,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cBecause there are enough kids in our sport that are entitled, it\u2019s hard to get away from that.\u201d\n\nBefore his Major League Lacrosse career, Striebel was a national title-winner in 2001 at Princeton University, where he played for legendary coach Bill Tierney. The culture Striebel described was defined by the work the players put in.\n\n\u201cIf you didn\u2019t win a national championship, you were letting down everyone who came before you. We were terrified about not upholding that tradition. There was no room for posturing. There was no room for not putting in the necessary time,\u201d Striebel said.\n\nTierney\u2019s Princeton teams won six national titles in 10 years between 1992 and 2001. Still, even in a program as dominant and serious as Princeton, Striebel said there was a stigma attached to lacrosse athletes off the field.\n\n\u201cI never wore my lacrosse jacket at Princeton, because I knew the minute I walked into a class wearing that jacket I was going to be pigeon-holed as a certain type of person,\u201d he said.\n\nAt a Memorial Day practice at Northampton High School, that type of person was nowhere to be found. Aside from some light banter about girls or prom, the players ran through their drills with a business-like seriousness, stopping only when Striebel wanted to point out a mistake in a defender\u2019s footwork or clean up a sloppy offensive possession.\n\n\u201cThey make it out to be something that it\u2019s really not,\u201d said senior Jack Shaughnessy about the sport\u2019s perception. \u201cLacrosse is a hard sport, and you come out here you realize it\u2019s a lot different that everybody takes it to be.\u201d\n\nThat public perception of lacrosse was not created out of thin air. The game\u2019s roots are as old as America\u2019s. Native Americans first played the game before European settlers arrived. However, the sport\u2019s popularity exploded in the country\u2019s pockets of privilege: suburban Long Island, the Mid-Atlantic states, and New England\u2019s elite prep schools, like the Hotchkiss School where Striebel played.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate to be involved with lacrosse for a long time at every conceivable level and I love the game,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cIt pains me that that is the view of the sport in the general public. What pains me is the fact that there isn\u2019t really a great comeback for us yet.\u201d\n\n***\n\nThere\u2019s no great comeback for the lacrosse community, because as a whole, rich and white athletes still make up the vast majority of the game\u2019s athletes. While players in states like Georgia, California and Texas are continuing to pick up lacrosse, its popularity is still concentrated in affluent areas like New England, Long Island and Maryland.\n\nUS Lacrosse, the sports governing body, has reported flagging growth numbers in its annual participation report for the last two years. The reasons behind that slowing growth can easily devolve into a circular argument: To keep growing, the perception that the game is a sport to keep future Wall Street bankers from getting bored needs to change, but for the game\u2019s elitist perception to change, more elite athletes from different areas of the country need to start playing.\n\nOne way to break that cycle, at least in Striebel\u2019s opinion, is for lacrosse players to stop displaying the behavior that, at least in part, gives the game its negative, elitist reputation.\n\nAt his induction into the Western Mass. Lacrosse Hall of Fame this January, Striebel told his players in attendance it was on them to carry the torch to mold a different perception of the game in the future.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that absolutely kills me about young men in particular is we give each other (a hard time) when we care about something or we try hard at something,\" he said. \u201cThere\u2019s this perception that it\u2019s uncool to (care), which is the most awful message we can give each other.\n\n\"You know where it comes from, you know it comes from a place of insecurity. Any kid who\u2019s making fun of somebody for working hard is somebody who knows they\u2019re doing something they\u2019re not supposed to do.\u201d\n\n***\n\nOn Memorial Day at Northampton High School, the Blue Devils got down to business. They were preparing for Cathedral the next day, a strong league opponent, the team went from drill to drill with a singular focus.\n\nAfter practice, following a quick team huddle to talk about putting together recruiting film, the players filtered out to their cars in the parking lot. A few stayed late to shoot on a net set up off to the side of the field.\n\nThere was no pretentiousness at that practice, no one playing lacrosse because they wanted to embody the culture it represents. In fact, most of the players said they had no idea the game had a negative perception around it when they first picked up a stick.\n\nRyan Wall, Bryce\u2019s brother and a junior defenseman, said the team doesn\u2019t talk that much about the way the game is perceived, or the way they should carry themselves to change that image. The understanding between the coach and his players is mostly unspoken, but in time, Wall hopes attitudes can change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress. The longer we\u2019re around the game and other people are around the game, the more we\u2019re working against that misconception and that idea, the less and less people will start conforming to that idea, and the less people will start applying that idea to lacrosse players in general,\u201d Wall said.\n\nIt\u2019s been nearly 15 years since Striebel played college lacrosse at Princeton. But he still remembers the satisfaction of revealing that he was a lacrosse player after his final grade came in, of undermining the dumb jock stereotype. He says he sees similarities on his team this year.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I love about the guys we have on this team. Someone like Bryce or Ryan they\u2019re lacrosse players and they work their ass off to be lacrosse players, but they\u2019re also artists, they\u2019re also interested in other things,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cThat\u2019s a way of undermining that dominant theme.\u201c"}, {"url": "https://www.masslive.com/highschoolsports/article/professional-lacrosse-player-matt-striebel-is-new-coach-of-northampton-high-school-boys-lacrosse-team/", "page_content": "NORTHAMPTON \u2013 Matt Striebel is a proven winner, something he\u2019d like to instill in his new position as coach of the Northampton High School boys lacrosse team.\n\nThe 33-year-old Gill native was a two-time NCAA Division I men\u2019s lacrosse national champion at Princeton University, a two-time World Lacrosse Championship gold medalist for Team USA and a three-time Major League Lacrosse champion with the Bridgeport/Philadelphia Barrage.\n\nHe also found time to play professional soccer for the Western Mass.

His collegiate career, as part of arguably the nation\u2019s best team in the late 1990s and early 2000s under coach Bill Tierney, ended with a victory over Syracuse in the 2001 title game.

His coaching style borrows from all the coaches he\u2019s had.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had the best coaches in lacrosse,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cThe sincerest form of flattery is stealing things, copying things.\u201d\n\nThe Blue Devils (6-12 last year) return one first-team All-Scholastic selection from last season, senior midfielder Colin Sawula. The team captain netted 23 goals and 16 assists a season ago.\n\nSawula and fellow senior captains Jay Messer, Andy Kuon and Justin Golec all see a major difference already in what their new coach has been able to get out of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompared to last year, it\u2019s completely different,\u201d said Sawula, who has had three coaches in four years. \u201cWe\u2019re out there working hard every day. I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019ve run more this year than we have last year. I have really high hopes for this season.\u201d\n\nOne of those previous coaches, Bill Metzger, is back as an assistant, giving Northampton some continuity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely an experience,\u201d Messer said. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely prepared.\u201d\n\nStriebel observed the Blue Devils several times last season and noticed a team that just needed a spark to get it to reach its full potential and to change the feeling of mediocrity that the players had.\n\n\u201cI saw a team that could benefit from some coaching, some discipline and some plans,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cThe biggest thing is getting over the sense of this (losing) is who we are.\u201d\n\nThe Blue Devils are ready to respond.\n\n\u201cHe wants us to work hard, and we come out here every day to work hard,\u201d Kuon said. \u201cWe\u2019re determined.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://lacrossepal.com/most-famous-lacrosse-players-of-all-time/", "page_content": "Lacrosse is a sport with a long running history.

In MLL offseasons, Striebel played three years of professional soccer from 2002-04 for the Western Massachusetts Pioneers of the USL Second Division.\n\n\u201cHis fitness level was just off the charts,\u201d said former Philadelphia Barrage head coach Tony Resch. \u201cHe could keep going and going. He had great speed. He could shoot it. Unselfish. All the things you look for in a midfielder, he had it.\u201d\n\nWhile Resch and most fans may remember Striebel as a lights-out shooter, that wasn\u2019t always the case. Prior to his senior year at Princeton, Striebel was an X attackman. When freshman Ryan Boyle stepped on campus, Striebel was moved above GLE \u2013 where, Boyle jokes, his shot couldn\u2019t break a paper bag.\n\n\u201cHe completely reinvented himself, starting with his senior year at Princeton moving from behind the cage out in front to midfield,\u201d said Boyle, who also played with Striebel on the Philadelphia Barrage. \u201cHis dedication to his craft is truly remarkable. Going from somebody who didn\u2019t really have much range to speak of at all to being somebody who you had to pick up at 16 yards\u2026 he was unguardable.\u201d\n\nThat work ethic led to a 171-game career. Striebel evolved to earn playing time on the \u201804 Barrage midfield unit featuring Blake Miller (46G, 11A), Roy Colsey (25G, 6T, 7A), Mike Mollot (11G, 8A), and Doug Shanahan (12G, 6A).\n\nStriebel stuck the eventual game-winning goal in the \u201804 MLL Championship for that Barrage squad.

These are their stories.\n\nMatt Striebel was out to lunch with his wife and two kids, and then he saw his phone ring. He didn\u2019t recognize the number, so he let it go straight to voicemail, as one does.\n\nThe message, he quickly realized, was from US Lacrosse. It was right around the annual giving time for the men\u2019s national team, Striebel said, so he called back to let them know his check was ready to be sent out.\n\nBut on the other line was Rick Lake, men's game senior manager at US Lacrosse. His message was a tad different.\n\n\u201cHe goes, \u2018Matt, we're actually calling you to let you know made the Hall of Fame,\u2019\u201d the Gill, Mass., native recalled. \u201cIt was an amazing moment that was made doubly better that I found out I was going in with Ryan (Boyle). As soon as I hung up that phone call, I called Ryan and was like, \u2018This is crazy. Can you believe it?\u2019 It was the perfect, poetic bookend to a journey of our playing careers.\u201d\n\n\"We tried to coexist for two games, then I went into the coach's office and they basically looked at me and said \u2018Striebs, it's been a great run. How about you try midfield?\" \u2014 Matt Striebel describing a meeting Bill Tierney his senior year.\n\nStriebel is one of nine set for the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame\u2019s Class of 2019, entering with his close friend, Boyle \u2014 a fellow champion at Princeton, with the U.S. national team and in Major League Lacrosse. They now work together at Trilogy Lacrosse, the company Boyle co-founded, though their roots extend back to 2001 at Princeton.\n\nThe Tigers, then coached by fellow Hall of Fame member Bill Tierney, had Boyle entering as a blue-chip recruit down on attack. Striebel, a captain and returning All-American on attack, was excited by playing with a player of his quality. Plans went another direction, though.\n\n\u201cWe tried to coexist for two games, then I went into the coach's office and they basically looked at me and said \u2018Striebs, it's been a great run. How about you try midfield?,\u2019\u201d said Striebel, who gave himself 24 hours to sulk before embracing his new role.\n\n\u201cI decided it's my senior year, I really want to win and am here to win a national championship. From a lacrosse standpoint, it's the best thing that could have happened to me, because I am more of a midfielder talent-wise and it made us a better team and opened opportunities on the U.S. team and as a professional.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not hyperbole from Striebel, either. That 2001 season marked Striebel\u2019s second national championship while at Princeton, as well as a fourth straight Ivy League championship. On the national stage, he captured gold at the World Lacrosse championships in 2002 (Perth) and 2010 (Manchester), plus silver in 2006 (Ontario).\n\nStriebel also secured three MLL championships (2004, \u201806, \u201807) with the Philadelphia Barrage, earning earning MLL All-Star honors on nine occasions. Boyle was right there at nearly every step.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m far happier for him than I am for myself,\u201d Boyle said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI often say there are some guys out there who are A-plus in a couple categories. Oh, he's an A-plus shooter or an A-plus dodger,\u201d Striebel began. \u201cFor me, I think I just had the versatility to be B-plus, A-minus guy in a lot of different categories. That allowed me to change and adapt my game as I got older.\n\n\u201cThe first 10 years I was in the MLL, I think I took one two-point shot and it was on an open goal when we needed goal differential for the playoffs. Then as I got older, like a basketball player who's adding a different aspect, I became more of a shooter so I could develop other parts of my game and maintain relevance as a player.\u201d\n\nBut like most great players, Striebel\u2019s connection with the game didn\u2019t cease once he put away the pads and cleats. He\u2019s spent the last seven years coaching at Northampton High School in Massachusetts, plus working for Trilogy. He\u2019s especially close with coaches in the Colonial Athletic Association, so he\u2019ll often swing by nearby UMass-Amherst to catch games and chat with old friends.\n\nThose experiences also remind Striebel of his time at Hotchkiss, in Lakeville, Conn., during the mid-1990s. He said that was the \u201cdawn of the post-graduate lacrosse era\u201d at New England prep schools, where he played alongside several NHL draft picks.\n\n\u201cYou had kids who played multiple sports at a very high level,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cThere were great athletes and for better or for worse, lacrosse has become a 365-day endeavor where kids have an opportunity to play every day.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://teamusa.uslacrosse.org/player-profile/matthew-striebel", "page_content": "Striebel was inducted as a truly great player.

He was a baseball fan and dreamed of becoming a major leaguer.\n\n\u201cLike every kid in America,\u201d the Northampton resident said.\n\nIntrigued, the Gill native started playing as a teenager for the Franklin County Lacrosse Club for Jeff Coulson, who now owns Indoor Action Sports in Greenfield.\n\n\u201cGrowing up here in western Mass., and I grew up in Gill, which was obviously not a hotbed of lacrosse at the time or really now. It\u2019s such a dynamic combination of other sports you\u2019re familiar growing up with,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cYou get the best of all those worlds combined in one Frankenstein sport. For a lot of kids, and I see this all the time at camps, it just grabs you, and once it does you\u2019re hooked for life.\u201d\n\nLacrosse became Striebel\u2019s passion and profession. He won championships at every level and worked to spread the spark lacrosse ignited in him. On Saturday, Striebel, 40, will earn one of the sport\u2019s highest honors with his induction to the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame.\n\n\u201cAt a certain point, I\u2019d had a career that was solid enough and significant enough that I had a pretty good idea that I would one day make it to the Hall of Fame. The part that was surprising to me was how quickly I got that call,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cIt was a validating honor. It puts your career in a nice, cohesive narrative.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019ll be inducted as part of a nine-member class at the The Grand Lodge in Hunt Valley, Maryland, just outside Baltimore.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s increasingly starting to set in. There\u2019s some behind the scenes getting tickets for people and organizing all that stuff that makes it seem like it\u2019s more in the real world and less something that\u2019s really special and exists as the culmination of a career,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cIt\u2019s sitting in a space that\u2019s between about to be real and pretty fantastic.\u201d\n\nStriebel received the call while out to lunch with his family at Green Bean in Northampton. It came from a Philadelphia number he didn\u2019t recognize, so he let it go to voice mail. Rick Lake, the men\u2019s lacrosse director of USA Lacrosse, was on the other end of the call.\n\n\u201cMy immediate assumption was they were calling because the annual giving campaigns had started up,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cAs a veteran of three U.S. teams, they look to me to give donations every once in a while and I assumed that\u2019s what it was.\u201d\n\nInstead, he found out he was being inducted alongside one of his longtime teammates and best friends Ryan Boyle. Boyle was a freshman at Princeton during Striebel\u2019s senior year in 2001. They both played attack, but Boyle took all of the repetitions during fall practices since Striebel also played soccer for the Tigers.\n\nAs a returning All-American and team captain, Striebel tried to coexist with the freshman.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty apparent that Ryan was just better at it than I was, even as a freshman,\u201d said Striebel, who attended The Hotchkiss School before Princeton. \u201cThe coaches brought me into their office and said, \u2018Striebs you had a great run, we\u2019re going to move you to midfield.\u2019 For about 48 hours, I hated Ryan.\u201d\n\nBut he realized that if the team was going to compete for a title, that would give the Tigers the best chance. Princeton won the national championship for the second time in Striebel\u2019s career.\n\nStriebel began his professional career the next season during the inaugural season of Major League Lacrosse. He played for the Bridgeport Barrage, and three years later after the franchise relocated to Philadelphia, they asked Striebel if Boyle was worth a first-round draft pick.\n\n\u201cI said he was and it would make our team better instantly,\u201d Striebel said.\n\nThe Barrage won the MLL title, one of three in Striebel\u2019s 15-year career. He and Boyle also played together for the USA on three World Lacrosse Championship teams.\n\nBoyle started a company called Trinity Lacrosse in 2005 and brought Striebel on as the program\u2019s national director, which is his full-time job. They run camps and events all over the country.\n\n\u201cThe fact that I was able to go in with Ryan, that\u2019s such a poetic bookend to our career and our friendship in the sport,\u201d Striebel said.\n\nStriebel was first called up to the U.S. national team in 2002, less than a year after the September 11 terrorist attacks. The Americans took gold in Perth, Australia.\n\n\u201cTo be able to put on a jersey and represent your country playing a sport you love, there aren\u2019t many honors that are more fulfilling than that,\u201d Striebel said.\n\nHe enjoyed teaming up with other elite players in a competitive setting. Unlike All-star games, which Striebel played in eight times, the world championships provided a goal to achieve rather than an exhibition.\n\nWhen the U.S. lost the 2006 final \u2013 the first time they hadn\u2019t won gold since 1978 \u2013 Striebel and his team left their medals in the dormitories in Ontario.\n\n\u201cIt was a really difficult loss to stomach,\u201d he said.\n\nStriebel and the USA redeemed themselves in 2010 in England with the nation\u2019s ninth gold medal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate enough to win a lot of incredible championships in my career, and those USA championships are definitely up there,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a fortunate career.\u201d\n\nHe recognizes that fortune and works to give others the same opportunity. Striebel coached Northampton High School for seven years before stepping down following the 2018 season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate enough to go all over the country and around the world spreading the gospel of lacrosse and sharing the sport with people who care about it,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cIt has a strong fraternity of followers. It\u2019s been amazing to see that expand to include so many people and so many places.\u201d\n\nTrilogy partners with organizations like Harlem Lacrosse to bring the game to areas and environments that haven\u2019t historically played it.\n\n\u201cFor many years it\u2019s been a predominantly white, wealthy, preppy sport, and that\u2019s not sustainable and that\u2019s not the best version of lacrosse that\u2019s going to exist,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cWhen the sport is available to kids all across the country whether you\u2019re living in an inner city neighborhood or Fairfield County, Connecticut, that\u2019s when the sport is really going to have achieved its peak.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.gazettenet.com/Lax-11604458", "page_content": "When Matt Striebel met Jarrod Neumann in the parking lot of Northampton High School in 2012, there was a simple conversation about lacrosse.\n\nStriebel was a decorated lacrosse player. He played in the Ivy League for Princeton before moving on to a 15-year professional career in Major League Lacrosse.\n\n\u201cI just saw an athletic monster,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cI recognized early on that he would succeed. He just ran with it.\u201d\n\nNeumann had never played lacrosse, but wanted to give the sport a try during his senior year for the Blue Devils.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have played lacrosse without Matt,\u201d Neumann said. \u201cHe is the reason I gave it a shot.

We\u2019ll try to make some cool plays and not to hurt ourselves.\u201d\n\nAt Princeton, Striebel scored 43 goals with 74 assists. During his MLL career, he scored 184 goals with 97 assists.\n\nStriebel stayed in contact with Neumann as his lacrosse path took him to Bridgton Academy before heading to Providence.\n\n\u201cWe talk just about every week,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cWhen he was going through the draft process I was encouraging GMs to take a chance on him.\u201d\n\nThe Florida Launch selected Neumann with the 25th pick of the MLL Draft.\n\nNeumann is in graduate school at Providence and plans to help coach the Friars. (On Launch game days, he flies to where the team is playing.)\n\n\u201cEveryone wants to stay in college,\u201d Neumann said. \u201cThis is a great way for me to keep my eye on them.\u201d\n\nAlong with coaching at Northampton, Striebel works for Trilogy Lacrosse, a national program.\n\nThere are no plans for Striebel to coach at a higher level.\n\n\u201cIn college, the percentage is much higher for recruiting than actual coaching,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cIn high school when you walk off the field, it doesn\u2019t always follow you like it does in college.\u201d\n\nIn Florida\u2019s regular season finale against the Cannons in Boston on Saturday, Neumann left a ticket for his old coach.\n\nWhen he found out that Striebel could not make the game, his response was to score his first goal as a professional.\n\n\u201cI did that to stick it to him a bit,\u201d Neumann said. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of relationship we have.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://trilogylacrosse.com/our-staff/matt-striebel/", "page_content": "\u201cI play lacrosse because I love it\u2014the speed, the intensity, the teamwork, the sense of fulfillment and satisfaction that comes when success is achieved over and through adversity.

How about you try midfield?,\u2019\u201d said Striebel, who gave himself 24 hours to sulk before embracing his new role.\n\n\u201cI decided it's my senior year, I really want to win and am here to win a national championship. From a lacrosse standpoint, it's the best thing that could have happened to me, because I am more of a midfielder talent-wise and it made us a better team and opened opportunities on the U.S. team and as a professional.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not hyperbole from Striebel, either. That 2001 season marked Striebel\u2019s second national championship while at Princeton, as well as a fourth straight Ivy League championship. On the national stage, he captured gold at the World Lacrosse championships in 2002 (Perth) and 2010 (Manchester), plus silver in 2006 (Ontario).\n\nStriebel also secured three MLL championships (2004, \u201806, \u201807) with the Philadelphia Barrage, earning earning MLL All-Star honors on nine occasions. Boyle was right there at nearly every step.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m far happier for him than I am for myself,\u201d Boyle said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI often say there are some guys out there who are A-plus in a couple categories. Oh, he's an A-plus shooter or an A-plus dodger,\u201d Striebel began. \u201cFor me, I think I just had the versatility to be B-plus, A-minus guy in a lot of different categories. That allowed me to change and adapt my game as I got older.\n\n\u201cThe first 10 years I was in the MLL, I think I took one two-point shot and it was on an open goal when we needed goal differential for the playoffs. Then as I got older, like a basketball player who's adding a different aspect, I became more of a shooter so I could develop other parts of my game and maintain relevance as a player.\u201d\n\nBut like most great players, Striebel\u2019s connection with the game didn\u2019t cease once he put away the pads and cleats. He\u2019s spent the last seven years coaching at Northampton High School in Massachusetts, plus working for Trilogy. He\u2019s especially close with coaches in the Colonial Athletic Association, so he\u2019ll often swing by nearby UMass-Amherst to catch games and chat with old friends.\n\nThose experiences also remind Striebel of his time at Hotchkiss, in Lakeville, Conn., during the mid-1990s. He said that was the \u201cdawn of the post-graduate lacrosse era\u201d at New England prep schools, where he played alongside several NHL draft picks.\n\n\u201cYou had kids who played multiple sports at a very high level,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cThere were great athletes and for better or for worse, lacrosse has become a 365-day endeavor where kids have an opportunity to play every day.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.usalacrosse.com/player-profile/matthew-striebel", "page_content": "Striebel was inducted as a truly great player.

He starred as a member of the Princeton Tigers men's lacrosse team from 1998 through 2001 and the Princeton Tigers men's soccer team from 1997 through 2000.\n\nDuring his time at Princeton, the team qualified for the NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship all four years, reached the championship game three times, won the championship game twice and won four Ivy League championships. He was a two-time honorable mention United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) All-American and three-time All-Ivy League selection (once first team, twice second team). He was also an All-Ivy league performer in soccer and earned Princeton co-athlete of the year (all-sport) honors as a senior.\n\nAs a professional, he has earned three MLL championships, a league record eight MLL All-Star recognitions and an MLL championship game MVP award. He is also a three-time Team USA representative and two-time World Lacrosse Championship gold medalist.\n\nBackground\n\nStriebel is a native of Gill, Massachusetts. He first got involved in lacrosse at about the age of 12 or 13 when his sister brought home the Brine Lightning stick that he began to play with. Striebel attended The Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut. Striebel first started playing lacrosse when he was a youth for Jeff Coulson, owner of Indoor Action Sports, in Greenfield, Massachusetts.\n\nHe also attended the Writers Workshop at The University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa, earning a Master of Fine Arts degree in 2007. He had earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English at Princeton.\n\nCollege career\n\nAt Princeton he was a two-time honorable mention USILA All-American Team selection in 2000 and 2001. He was a second team All-Ivy League selection in 1999 and 2000 and a first team selection in 2001. He was a 2001 USILA Scholar All-American. During his four-year career, Princeton went undefeated in Ivy League Conference play with consecutive 6\u20130 records. Princeton was invited to the 1999 tournament, was a finalist in the 2000 tournament and earned championships in both the 1998 and 2001 tournaments, bringing the schools consecutive tournament invitations streak to twelve. In Striebel's 2001 senior season, the arrival of freshman Ryan Boyle necessitated that he move from attack to midfield. The move came the first practice after Princeton's 14\u20138 loss to Syracuse. Striebel had previously been orchestrating the Princeton offense from behind the goal, but on March 25, 2001, head coach Bill Tierney made the switch. During the 1998 season when Princeton won the NCAA title, Striebel had been playing midfield. Princeton went undefeated for the rest of the 2001 season after the switch.\n\nDuring the 2000 NCAA tournament, Striebel scored two goals in the quarterfinals 10\u20137 victory against Maryland, and he added another in the 13\u20137 championship game loss to Syracuse. Striebel was one of the leading scorers on the team that season, and he was the team leader in assists entering the final four weekend. In the quarterfinals of the 2001 NCAA championship tournament, Striebel had an assist in the 8\u20137 victory over Loyola. In the 12\u201311 semifinal victory over Towson State, Striebel had a goal and an assist. Striebel scored twice in the 2001 championship game and also added two assists. He was selected to the All-tournament team.\n\nStriebel was also an honorable mention All-Ivy League soccer player in 2000 as well as a 2000 Academic All-Ivy selection in soccer. As a junior, Striebel was a member of the 1999 Ivy League Champion Princeton Soccer team that earned an invitation to the 1999 NCAA Men's Division I Soccer Championship. The team posted a 10\u20135\u20132 (5\u20131\u20131 Ivy League) record.\n\nAs of 2010, Striebel ranks eighth on the Princeton Lacrosse career assists list and eleventh on the Princeton soccer career assists list. As a senior, he was honored as one of the three athletes of the year on campus (along with Dennis Norman and Scott Denbo)\n\nProfessional career\n\nStriebel began his career in the league's inaugural 2001 MLL season with the Bridgeport Barrage and stayed with the team as it remained in Bridgeport, Connecticut until the 2003 season. Then he moved with the franchise and played with the Philadelphia Barrage from 2004 through 2008. In 2009 MLL season, he joined the Chicago Machine and then became a member of the Rochester Rattlers for the 2011 MLL season. Striebel and Boyle were reunited for five seasons in Philadelphia. Striebel has helped the Barrage to win three Steinfeld Cup championships in 2004, 2006, and 2007. In the 2004 championship game, he scored what the Baltimore Sun described as the clinching goal in the 13\u201311 victory over the Boston Cannons. In the 2006 game, he had nine points (four goals, including one two-pointer and four assists). He was presented with the 2007 Steinfeld Cup Game Most Valuable Player Award. Striebel appeared in the 2005 & 2007 Major League Lacrosse All-Star Games. In the 2006 All-Star game he represented Team USA by scoring a goal and two assists. Striebel was an MLL All-Pro selection in 2007 and 2008. Striebel was an MLL All-Star in 2011. In 2012, Striebel set the MLL record for most All-Star games with eight (consecutive).\n\nStriebel served as an assistant coach for Princeton Men's Lacrosse in 2005. Striebel also spent time assisting the men's lacrosse team at Iowa during his time there. As of 12 April 2012, Striebel currently coaches the Varsity Boys Lacrosse team at Northampton High School in Northampton, MA which is just south of his hometown. He also played professionally in 2012 and 2013.\n\nIn addition to his field lacrosse career, Striebel played one season in 2003 of box lacrosse with the Philadelphia Wings in the National Lacrosse League. Streibel was traded by the Wings to the New York Saints in February 2003. He never appeared in a game for the Saints. Striebel has also played professional soccer for the Western Massachusetts Pioneers.\n\nStriebel has represented Team USA in the World Lacrosse Championship in 2002, 2006, and 2010. In the 2002 World Lacrosse Championship semifinal match against the Iroquois Nation, Striebel scored a goal in the 18\u20138 victory. Striebel also serves as a representative of Trilogy Lacrosse.\n\nOn November 11, 2013, Striebel was traded to the New York Lizards.\n\nStatistics\n\nMLL\n\nRegular Season Playoffs Season Team GP G 2ptG A Pts LB PIM GP G 2ptG A Pts LB PIM 2001 Bridgeport 8 4 0 8 12 10 0 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 2002 Bridgeport 9 10 0 5 15 22 0 2 2 0 1 3 4 0 2003 Bridgeport 12 16 0 2 18 19 0 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 2004 Philadelphia 12 15 0 12 27 14 0.5 2 2 0 1 3 4 0 2005 Philadelphia 12 22 0 13 35 25 0.5 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 2006 Philadelphia 11 23 0 12 35 29 0 2 9 1 5 15 2 0 2007 Philadelphia 12 25 1 13 39 22 0 2 5 0 4 9 4 0 2008 Philadelphia 12 31 0 11 42 21 0 1 2 0 0 2 1 0 2009 Chicago 12 13 1 8 22 18 1.5 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 2010 Chicago 10 12 0 5 17 14 0 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 2011 Rochester 12 13 4 8 25 16 3.0 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 2012 Rochester 14 14 8 10 32 13 0.5 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- MLL Totals 122 184 6 97 287 210 2.5 7 18 1 10 29 11 0\n\nPrinceton University"}, {"url": "https://www.statscrew.com/lacrosse/stats/p-striemat001", "page_content": "Matt Striebel\n\nMatt Striebel\n\nBorn: January 12, 1979\n\nIowa City, IA\n\nPosition: M\n\nHeight: 6'1\"\n\nWeight: 190\n\nCareer: 2001-2015\n\n\n\nMatt Striebel scored 225 goals and recorded 117 assists in his 167-game career with the Bridgeport Barrage, Philadelphia Wings, Philadelphia Barrage, Barrage, Chicago Machine, Rochester Rattlers , Boston Cannons, New York Lizards and Chesapeake BayHawks.

He was a baseball fan and dreamed of becoming a major leaguer.\n\n\u201cLike every kid in America,\u201d the Northampton resident said.\n\nIntrigued, the Gill native started playing as a teenager for the Franklin County Lacrosse Club for Jeff Coulson, who now owns Indoor Action Sports in Greenfield.\n\n\u201cGrowing up here in western Mass., and I grew up in Gill, which was obviously not a hotbed of lacrosse at the time or really now. It\u2019s such a dynamic combination of other sports you\u2019re familiar growing up with,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cYou get the best of all those worlds combined in one Frankenstein sport. For a lot of kids, and I see this all the time at camps, it just grabs you, and once it does you\u2019re hooked for life.\u201d\n\nLacrosse became Striebel\u2019s passion and profession. He won championships at every level and worked to spread the spark lacrosse ignited in him. On Saturday, Striebel, 40, will earn one of the sport\u2019s highest honors with his induction to the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame.\n\n\u201cAt a certain point, I\u2019d had a career that was solid enough and significant enough that I had a pretty good idea that I would one day make it to the Hall of Fame. The part that was surprising to me was how quickly I got that call,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cIt was a validating honor. It puts your career in a nice, cohesive narrative.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019ll be inducted as part of a nine-member class at the The Grand Lodge in Hunt Valley, Maryland, just outside Baltimore.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s increasingly starting to set in. There\u2019s some behind the scenes getting tickets for people and organizing all that stuff that makes it seem like it\u2019s more in the real world and less something that\u2019s really special and exists as the culmination of a career,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cIt\u2019s sitting in a space that\u2019s between about to be real and pretty fantastic.\u201d\n\nStriebel received the call while out to lunch with his family at Green Bean in Northampton. It came from a Philadelphia number he didn\u2019t recognize, so he let it go to voice mail. Rick Lake, the men\u2019s lacrosse director of USA Lacrosse, was on the other end of the call.\n\n\u201cMy immediate assumption was they were calling because the annual giving campaigns had started up,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cAs a veteran of three U.S. teams, they look to me to give donations every once in a while and I assumed that\u2019s what it was.\u201d\n\nInstead, he found out he was being inducted alongside one of his longtime teammates and best friends Ryan Boyle. Boyle was a freshman at Princeton during Striebel\u2019s senior year in 2001. They both played attack, but Boyle took all of the repetitions during fall practices since Striebel also played soccer for the Tigers.\n\nAs a returning All-American and team captain, Striebel tried to coexist with the freshman.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty apparent that Ryan was just better at it than I was, even as a freshman,\u201d said Striebel, who attended The Hotchkiss School before Princeton. \u201cThe coaches brought me into their office and said, \u2018Striebs you had a great run, we\u2019re going to move you to midfield.\u2019 For about 48 hours, I hated Ryan.\u201d\n\nBut he realized that if the team was going to compete for a title, that would give the Tigers the best chance. Princeton won the national championship for the second time in Striebel\u2019s career.\n\nStriebel began his professional career the next season during the inaugural season of Major League Lacrosse. He played for the Bridgeport Barrage, and three years later after the franchise relocated to Philadelphia, they asked Striebel if Boyle was worth a first-round draft pick.\n\n\u201cI said he was and it would make our team better instantly,\u201d Striebel said.\n\nThe Barrage won the MLL title, one of three in Striebel\u2019s 15-year career. He and Boyle also played together for the USA on three World Lacrosse Championship teams.\n\nBoyle started a company called Trinity Lacrosse in 2005 and brought Striebel on as the program\u2019s national director, which is his full-time job. They run camps and events all over the country.\n\n\u201cThe fact that I was able to go in with Ryan, that\u2019s such a poetic bookend to our career and our friendship in the sport,\u201d Striebel said.\n\nStriebel was first called up to the U.S. national team in 2002, less than a year after the September 11 terrorist attacks. The Americans took gold in Perth, Australia.\n\n\u201cTo be able to put on a jersey and represent your country playing a sport you love, there aren\u2019t many honors that are more fulfilling than that,\u201d Striebel said.\n\nHe enjoyed teaming up with other elite players in a competitive setting. Unlike All-star games, which Striebel played in eight times, the world championships provided a goal to achieve rather than an exhibition.\n\nWhen the U.S. lost the 2006 final \u2013 the first time they hadn\u2019t won gold since 1978 \u2013 Striebel and his team left their medals in the dormitories in Ontario.\n\n\u201cIt was a really difficult loss to stomach,\u201d he said.\n\nStriebel and the USA redeemed themselves in 2010 in England with the nation\u2019s ninth gold medal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate enough to win a lot of incredible championships in my career, and those USA championships are definitely up there,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a fortunate career.\u201d\n\nHe recognizes that fortune and works to give others the same opportunity. Striebel coached Northampton High School for seven years before stepping down following the 2018 season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate enough to go all over the country and around the world spreading the gospel of lacrosse and sharing the sport with people who care about it,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cIt has a strong fraternity of followers. It\u2019s been amazing to see that expand to include so many people and so many places.\u201d\n\nTrilogy partners with organizations like Harlem Lacrosse to bring the game to areas and environments that haven\u2019t historically played it.\n\n\u201cFor many years it\u2019s been a predominantly white, wealthy, preppy sport, and that\u2019s not sustainable and that\u2019s not the best version of lacrosse that\u2019s going to exist,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cWhen the sport is available to kids all across the country whether you\u2019re living in an inner city neighborhood or Fairfield County, Connecticut, that\u2019s when the sport is really going to have achieved its peak.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/matt-striebel", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nMatt Striebel was born on 12 January, 1979 in Gill, Massachusetts, United States.
