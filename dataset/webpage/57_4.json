Those dreams became reality in 2012 when she got as close as she could get to advancing to the 100m breaststroke final in London, losing a swim-off for the eighth spot in the final to Jamaica\u2019s Alia Atkinson. Van Beilen also competed in the 200m breaststroke after winning the event at the Canadian Trials, knocking world record holder Annamay Pierse off the Canadian Olympic team in the process. Van Beilen had competed at the inaugural Youth Olympic Games in 2010, winning three medals including gold in the 100m breaststroke. Her multi-sport competition experience includes the 2011 and 2013 Universiades, where she won a pair of silver medals in her first appearance. Van Beilen made her FINA World Championship debut in 2013. She has been part of four straight CIS championship teams with the UBC Thunderbirds.\n\nGETTING TO KNOW\u2026\n\nFamily: Parents Harry and Sharon Van Beilen\u2026 Older brother Nathan\u2026 Younger sister Marya\u2026 Uncle Wayne Van Dorp is a former NHL player\u2026 Cousin Joel Reinders is a CFL offensive lineman\u2026 Getting into the Sport: Learned to swim at age 5 in the backyard pool because she was a chubby child\u2026 Started swimming competitively at age 9\u2026 Was disqualified from her first meet for moving her toes\u2026 Outside Interests: Kinesiology major at the University of British Columbia\u2026 Enjoys baking and cooking\u2026 Played piano for 10 years\u2026 Odds and Ends: Nicknames: Teddy, TVB\u2026 Athlete ambassador for KidSport\u2026 Collects magnets during her travels\u2026 Favourite motto: Do my best, let God do the rest\u2026 Likes to eat yogurt-covered raisings before competing\u2026 Has a maple leaf tattoo on her toe, making it the last thing she sees before diving off the blocks\u2026\n\nINTERNATIONAL RESULTS\n\nFINA World Championships: 2013 \u2013 28th (100m breaststroke), 21st (200m breaststroke)\n\nYouth Olympic Games: 2010 \u2013 GOLD (100m breaststroke), SILVER (200m breaststroke), BRONZE (4x100m freestyle relay), 4th (4x100m medley relay)\n\nPan Pacific Championships: 2014 \u2013 12th (100m breaststroke), 12th (200m breaststroke)\n\nCommonwealth Games: 2014 \u2013 6th (100m breaststroke), 9th (200m breaststroke), BRONZE (4x100m medley relay)"}, {"url": "https://www.ubyssey.ca/sports/tera-van-beilen-swim-queen/", "page_content": "A young girl walks across the deck of a pool in Oakville, Ontario. She\u2019s eight years old, in that chubby phase every kid goes through, swimming her first novice swim practice ever without any goggles. When she finishes, the first thing she says to her mum, after asking to get some goggles, is when the next swim practice is. All it took was one swim practice to get her hooked, and she hasn\u2019t looked back since.\n\nTera Van Beilen is an unbreakable force in the pool. In a solid 15-year career, she\u2019s made waves in the world of competitive swimming. She has been a part of four CIS championship teams with the UBC Thunderbirds, participated in the inaugural Youth Olympic Games in 2010 and won a pair of silvers at the 2011 and 2013 Universiades. Most notably, she qualified for her first Olympic Games in 2012 in the 100m and 200m breaststroke events.\n\nBut after 15 years of furious training and competing, Van Beilen has decided to hang up her suit and goggles, and retire from competitive swimming after missing the qualifying standard for the Rio 2016 Olympic games. This can be a heavy hit for most athletes, but Tera was smiling and positive when she spoke to us.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little shocked to be going through as much joy as I am now. I love the sport so much, and I will miss it \u2026 Swimming teaches you how to deal with these situations and making the best of what comes about and I think that's been really important in this transition phase,\u201d Van Beilen said.\n\nThis was not an easy decision either. After devoting years of her life to this sport, she reflects on her career and has no regrets.\n\n\u201cI didn't want to go into Olympic Trials thinking \u2018If I don't make the Olympics, life is over\u2019. I wanted to go in with confidence that I could potentially make it, and at the end of the day I actually swam the fastest that I ever had in four years and I have no regrets about the way I swam and the training and the last year. It's just the other girls were faster.\u201d\n\nVan Beilen isn\u2019t unfamiliar with this change in dynamics and \"passing the torch\". When she qualified for the Olympics back in 2012, she beat out reigning Canadian champion and record holder Annamay Pierse for the gold medal and the elusive spot on the Canadian team.\n\n\u201cMaking the Olympics was something that I actually didn't think I would realistically do in 2012, I thought it would be more of a 2016 goal and ended up doing it. In the moment after touching the wall, it was still something that was so surreal. Now, looking back on it, I will forever be an Olympian.\u201d\n\nYou could argue that she owes a bit of her success to the time that she\u2019s spent in Vancouver, especially at UBC. Despite receiving offers for full-ride scholarships from many American colleges, Van Beilen made the \u201chardest choice of her life.\u201d She decided to attend UBC to pursue her Olympic dreams.\n\n\u201cThe head coach of the Vancouver (High Performance) Centre flew to my house for dinner, and told me everything about UBC, and I was like it's a no-brainer. I need to come to this school. I would be training with Joseph Nagy, who's one of the best breaststroke coaches in the world, and putting myself in a tough environment where most of the members of the team had qualified for international competitions, all while earning a degree. Really, there\u2019s no other choice that seemed as perfect as UBC,\u201d said Van Beilen.\n\nAfter five years of gruelling high-performance training \u2014 including 10 two-hour swim practices a week alongside five hours of dryland training and balancing full-time schooling \u2014 Van Beilen feels blessed to have had this opportunity.\n\n\u201cI came [to UBC] because I wanted to make the Olympic team, that was my dream since I was a little kid. So I said whatever is going to get me there, I'm going to do. To get a degree at the same time too? It was tough, but I'm glad it did it,\u201d Van Beilen said.\n\nAs she heads into her final months at UBC, Van Beilen is finishing up her kinesiology degree and hopes to hit the pool again sometime soon. More importantly, she\u2019s looking towards the future with bright eyes, a positive attitude and some valuable life lessons under her wings.\n\n\u201cThere are flips and flops in swimming, and that's what is so exciting. You win and you lose. Here I am now, happy and excited,\u201d said Van Beilen.\n\nWho knows what\u2019s next for this Olympian, but we\u2019re sure it won\u2019t be the last we see of Tera Van Beilen."}, {"url": "https://swimswam.com/road-to-the-cis-championships-tera-van-beilen/", "page_content": "TERA VAN BEILEN\n\nUniversity of British Columbia\n\nFourth Year\n\nHometown: Oakville, Ont.\n\nFaculty: Kinesiology\n\nHeight: 5-11\n\nAge: 21\n\nTo stay on top of our coverage of the CIS this weekend, bookmark the page for our Canadian channel here.\n\nNICKNAME/ FUN FACT: \u201cMy nickname has always been TVB. I\u2019m good at baking, impersonating people and telling stories.\u201d\n\nUBC FUN FACT/ FAVOURITE CIS MEMORY: \u201cFor lunch one day we had chili, and let\u2019s just say we blame everything on the chili now.\u201d\n\nCanadian female swimming has typically had some top notch breaststrokers and fitting right into that category is UBC\u2019s Tera Van Beilen. Van Beilen, a 2012 Canadian Olympian, has had plenty of success in the breaststroke events and is a favourite to make the World Championships roster this summer.\n\nVan Beilen made the semi-finals in the 100m breaststroke at the 2012 Olympic Games where she tied for eighth with Jamaican Olympian Alia Atkinson. There, Van Beilen finished second in the swim-off taking a ninth place finish overall.\n\nLast summer, Van Beilen competed at the Commonwealth Games and Pan Pacific Championships picking up a bronze medal in Glasgow as part of the 4x100m medley relay team.\n\nVan Beilen is one of Canada\u2019s top competitors on the international scene, and one of the most dominant breaststrokes overall in the CIS. She\u2019ll be swimming all three breaststroke events as well as the 400m IM this year, and will have stiff competition in all of those races. Over the years, her biggest CIS rival in the breaststrokes has been Calgary\u2019s Fiona Doyle.\n\n\u201cFiona and I have had fun over the years battling it out in all the breaststroke races. It\u2019s great to have competition like that within the CIS and that battle will definitely continue over this coming weekend,\u201d said Van Beilen.\n\nThe long course finals shouldn\u2019t change the competitiveness of the races one bit, as both are international competitors and used to competing in the longer pool. Van Beilen prefers long course meets, however stated that she did enjoy the short course format of the CIS Championships leading up to trials.\n\nAs one of the favourites to make the Worlds team, Van Beilen is using this meet as preparation for Trials which will take place in Toronto starting April first.\n\nThe new long course format of the championships has given her a chance to train more long course as the meet approached. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing more back-to-back practices long course. Also this year, instead of doing our race set-up short short course we did it long course.\u201d As for special preparation, Van Beilen included UBC\u2019s Valentines Day plans, \u201cwe also baked cupcakes and wrote poems for the guys team on Valentines day, and they gave us roses and chocolates.\u201d\n\nThe team camaraderie at UBC is one of the reasons that they\u2019ve been so successful. The women are going into the meet looking for their fourth straight title, something that they have only done once before during the decade of dominance.\n\n\u201cOur team has grown so strong as a cohesive group over the last couple months, and I think we have the depth and talent to do amazing things this weekend,\u201d said Van Beilen. \u201cThe UBC women\u2019s swim team is like a second family to me, and the incredible experiences we\u2019ve shared throughout the years are some that I will remember for a lifetime.\u201d\n\nVan Beilen has played a major role as a leader on the UBC roster, and although her talent stretches far beyond the CIS, she\u2019s still constantly trying new things such as new events and having fun with university swimming. \u201cI haven\u2019t ever raced the 400m IM long course with some rest so that will be a fun race.\u201d\n\nAs soon as the CIS Championships are finished, Van Beilen will be heading to back to UBC to prepare for trials. She believes that this weekend will be a great opportunity to see where she\u2019s at in her preparation.\n\n\u201cFor the breaststroke events, it will be a good opportunity to get some solid short and long course racing in before trials. We use this meet every year as a preparation for trials.\u201d\n\nAs for trials Van Beilen said that there, \u201cshould be some more great racing in just over a months time.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://swimswam.com/2016-cis-championships-day-two-prelims/", "page_content": "2016 CIS CHAMPIONSHIPS\n\nQuebec City, QC\n\nSCM \u2013 Prelims\n\nLCM \u2013 Finals\n\nPrelims 10:00 am ET\n\nFinals 6:00 pm ET\n\nDefending men\u2019s champions: UBC\n\nDefending women\u2019s champions: UBC\n\nLive results\n\nLive Stream\n\nWOMEN\u2019S 100m BACKSTROKE\n\nKylie Masse took things easier this morning in the heats of the 100m backstroke while still taking the top seed with a time of 59.29. While she was the definite favourite in the 50m backstroke, Masse will have to face off against some very tough competitors in the 100.\n\nMarie-Pier Couillard of Laval finished second this morning not far behind Masse with a time of 59.61. She\u2019s got the CIS experience under her belt to be very competitive in tonight\u2019s final.\n\nPhoebe Lenderyou of Dalhousie and Genevieve Cantin of Laval will be right in the mix as well. Lenderyou was the only other swimmer under one-minute this morning with a 59.96. Cantin dropped a 1:00.02 to take the fourth seed.\n\nResults\n\nMEN\u2019S 100m BACKSTROKE\n\nAfter a Calgary win last night in the 50m backstroke Brad Crocker of Calgary took the top seed this morning in the 100m back. Crocker clocked in at 53.68 to take the top seed, being the only swimmer under 54-seconds.\n\nNoah Choboter of Regina was second overall in the heats with a 54.00 performance. Right behind him was Carson Olafson of UBC in 54.17 and last night\u2019s winner Josh Dow in 54.23.\n\nThe final should be a close one considering that the top eight were all within a second of each other.\n\nResults\n\nWOMEN\u2019S 50m BUTTERFLY\n\nWestern\u2019s Paulina Bond of Toronto made a statement this morning in the heats of the women\u2019s 50m butterfly with a swift 27.02 performance. That put her decently in the lead ahead of Kimberly Moors of Manitoba and Sherry Patel of Toronto.\n\nLast night\u2019s co-champions in the 100m butterfly, Jacomie Strydom and Marie-Lou Lapointe, will both be in the finals after taking the fourth and sixth seeds respectively.\n\nIf this final is anything like the 100m fly final, it should come down to the touch.\n\nResults\n\nMEN\u2019S 50m BUTTERFLY\n\nLaval\u2019s Pascal-Hugo Cantin was the only swimmer this morning under 24-seconds in the men\u2019s 50m butterfly. Cantin rocked a 23.96 to establish himself as the clear leader heading into finals.\n\nLast night\u2019s 100m breaststroke silver medallist Dillon Perron of Manitoba took the second seed behind Cantin with a time of 24.25. He was just one one-hundredth faster than Toronto\u2019s Matthew Dans who put up a 24.26 performance this morning.\n\nAdd in some more raw Toronto sprinters such as Mitchel Ferraro and Cameron Kidd and this final should be a quick one.\n\nResults\n\nWOMEN\u2019S 400m FREESTYLE\n\nIf tonight\u2019s final is anything like the heats this morning, it\u2019s going to come down to the last 50 to decide the winner. Both Maia Brundage of UBC and Victoria Radounski of Toronto posted very similar times.\n\nBrundage was a 4:14.53 while Radounski was a 4:14.84. Those two are ahead, but not by much as Katherine Webster clocked in a 4:15.32 to take the third seed overall.\n\nLisa Van Breugel of Toronto was a 4:16.43 followed by Victoria\u2019s Kaitlin Gervais in 4:17.70.\n\nResults\n\nMEN\u2019S 400m FREESTYLE\n\nLast night\u2019s 200m freestyle champion, Keegan Zanatta, rocked a swift 3:49.73 in the men\u2019s 400m freestyle this morning to be the only one to dip under the 3:50-mark.\n\nRight on his tail was Tristan Cote of Calgary who touched in at 3:50.36. Jonathan Brown of UBC was third in 3:50.77 followed by Oliver Straszynski in 3:51.04.\n\nThe long course final should shake things up a bit, however Zanatta does look like the likely candidate to take home the win for UBC.\n\nResults\n\nWOMEN\u2019S 200m BREASTSTROKE\n\nTera Van Beilen of UBC made a statement this morning with a 2:23.98 performance in the heats of the 200m breaststroke. Not only did that give her the top seed overall, but she was almost five seconds faster than all of her remaining competitors.\n\nTianna Rissling of Calgary was the closest to her with a 2:28.32 performance, and even she was over a second ahead of UBC\u2019s Erin Stamp who clocked in a 2:29.36.\n\nVan Beilen\u2019s breaststroke prowess is taking over here in Quebec, City where she\u2019s set herself up for the chance to sweep the three breaststroke disciplines.\n\nResults\n\nMEN\u2019S 200m BREASTSTROKE\n\nAfter a bronze medal performance last night in the 100m breaststroke, Sherbrooke\u2019s Jonathan Naisby is establishing himself as the man to beat in the 200 final tonight.\n\nNaisby went a 2:12.54 this morning in the heats to better Dillon Perron\u2019s 2:12.76 and Antoine Bujold\u2019s 2:13.17.\n\n100m breaststroke champion Eli Wall of Toronto will also be in the final after taking the fourth seed with a time of 2:14.00.\n\nResults\n\nWOMEN\u2019S 50m FREESTYLE\n\nIt took a 25.40 from UBC\u2019s Rebecca Terejko to top the charts this morning in the 50m freestyle. She wasn\u2019t alone as Paige Schultz from Toronto and Paulina Bond from Western were right behind in 25.43 and 25.47.\n\nRoxane Lemieux of Montreal was fourth four-tenths behind them in 25.87.\n\nResults\n\nMEN\u2019S 50m FREESTYLE\n\nUBC sprinter Alex Loginov came within half-a-second of Colin Russell\u2019s CIS record of 21.73 in the 50m freestyle this morning with a 22.17 performance.\n\nCameron Kidd, who will also be in the 50 fly, was second behind him in 22.26. Mitchel Ferraro, UofT\u2019s other top sprinter was third in 22.50.\n\nEvan Van Moerkerke of Guelph took the sixth seed, but has proven to have plenty of speed and should be a factor in tonight\u2019s final.\n\nResults\n\nWOMEN\u2019S 200m BUTTERFLY\n\nMontreal is looking to make a stand tonight in the points totals. Sophia Marois is the top seed in the 200m butterfly by over a full second with a time of 2:11.99.\n\nUBC\u2019s Jacomie Strydom was second behind her in 2:11.99. The two are well ahead of the rest of the field as Jennifer Mcnaughton from Western took the third seed behind the two leaders in 2:15.85.\n\nResults\n\nMEN\u2019S 200m BUTTERFLY\n\nAfter his 400m IM victory last night, UofT freshman Osvald Nitski is looking for another one after being the only man under 2:00 in the 200m fly this morning.\n\nNitski rocked a 1:59.35 to take the top seed over Thomas Jobin of Calgary. Joban was a 2:00.17.

Now, in many ways, she\u2019s an icon of success for others.\n\nIt may have been back when she was five years old, benefitting from a pool in her home backyard, that a light started to trickle. One of a youngster\u2019s desire to be competitive, noticed, and having that desire to win.\n\nVan Beilen, now married and whose maiden name we will use in this feature, has many stories about her younger years in the world of arts and sports. There were those ballet lessons, playing piano and the introduction to soccer.\n\nBut it was always swimming that superseded everything else.\n\nShe eloquently described it as \u201cthat urge to stay in the pool, never get out and even, at times, want to eat dinner while in the water\u201d.\n\nThat may have been an early taste of what would lie ahead for this water baby.\n\nThere\u2019s a New York city pop band, called American Authors, known for the song \u201cThe Best Days of My Life\u201d. Listen to it. Tap your foot to the music, even sing along if you know the lyrics when you read more about Van Beilen.\n\n\u201cI had a dream so big and loud\n\nI jumped so high I touched the clouds\n\nWo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh\n\nI stretched my hands out to the sky.\u201d\n\nBest Days of My Life, American Authors\n\nIt might be a tune that she may consider attaching to her prosperous swim career.\n\nWhen mentioning the real inauguration to competitive swimming, this might surprise many. It wasn\u2019t any of the events she competed in - the Commonwealth Games, FINA World championships or even the Summer Olympics.\n\nIt all started in 2009, in Charlottetown, P.E.I., at the Canada Summer Games.\n\nCanada\u2019s national spotlight on amateur sport was where Van Beilen would begin to relish fame with a remarkable performance and go on to win six gold medals.\n\n\u201cI remember it very well and asking myself \u2013 how did I do this,\u201d she said in a recent telephone conversation. \u201cAlso, medalling at the Canadian Nationals and realizing that I was able to do more than just the breaststroke, but also compete in the relays and help my team. That was the year that started my competitive swim career.\u201d\n\nWith the beautiful Niagara Region of Ontario hosting the 2022 Canada Summer Games in August, an event that brings together some 5,000 promising athletes, a mere mention of those days brings back fond memories for Van Beilen, who has a Maple Leaf tattoo on one of her toes.\n\n\u201cThe Canada Summer Games were an incredible experience, a special time in my life and a glimpse at top level athletes in many sports,\u201d she said, while also confirming a rumour that she liked to eat yoghurt-covered raisins before competing.\n\n\u201cThings were different in my day, as you could be a National calibre athlete in those Games. But now, it\u2019s really focussed for younger kids with potential \u2013 more of a stepping stone for success, to experience and cherish the moment. It could very well be the start of something big for many.\u201d\n\nWhile she graduated from King\u2019s Christian Collegiate in Oakville, a school that now has the \u201cVan Beilen Endeavour Award\u201d given to a student who excels in arts, music, or sports outside of school, her swim keys to success started with the Oakville Aquatic Club.\n\nChoosing post-secondary education in Canada, over numerous athletic scholarship offers from schools throughout the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), Van Beilen picked the University of British Columbia.\n\nNot only did she continue her academic honors success, and left UBC with a Degree in Kinesiology, but she was on the Thunderbirds incredible swim team that won four consecutive Canadian Interuniversity Sports (now re-branded to USports) championships.\n\nThere was also the Swim Youth Olympics in Singapore, where she won three medals, that would come a year after the Canada Summer Games.

That is, until her parents asked her to make a choice between sticking with swimming and its challenges, or packing it in. Judgment time, and she picked swimming and has never looked back.\n\nBoth her parents had been athletes, an uncle played in the National Hockey League and a cousin in the Canadian and National Football Leagues, the genes were in the family.\n\nWith her competitive days eventually now having come to a close, she really hasn\u2019t bid adieu to the sport.

The swim has won a total of five medals so far in the competition.\n\nLindsay Delmar of Calgary was fifth in the women\u2019s 50 butterfly Wednesday.\n\nThe Youth Olympics are for athletes 14-18 and have attracted more than 3,000 athletes in the same sports program that is set for the 2012 London Games.\n\nRussia has nine golds and 19 medals overall, while China has nine golds and 15 medals overall. Azerbaijan is third with five golds, while Italy has four. Canada has a total of eight medals so far, including three gold.\n\nIn the women\u2019s 100 breaststroke, Van Beilen nailed her second length to emerge with the gold in one minute 8.95 seconds. Emily Selig of Australia was second in 1:09.06 and Nicol, first at the turn, followed in third in 1:09.18.\n\n\u201cIt feels amazing to win gold,\u201d said the 17-year-old Van Beilen. \u201cI came into this meet wanting to win a medal, and after the prelims and semis I felt I had a shot at the gold. I didn\u2019t realize I was second at the turn, but I saw Rachel beside me and my strength in this race has always been my second half.\u201d\n\nNicol was at a personal best pace on the first length Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI had never gone out that fast before,\u201d Nicol said. \u201cOn the second length I got a bit tired and my stroke shortened a bit. Still I\u2019m not disappointed especially that Tera also got on the podium. It was a really close race and exciting for all of us.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Britain\u2019s David Bolarinwa and Jamaica\u2019s Odane Skeen won their qualifying heats in the 100 metres, setting up a much anticipated final between two sprinters touted as the next Usain Bolt.\n\nBolarinwa blew away the field in his heat, finishing in 10.62 seconds. Skeen got out slowly but surged to run 10.63 seconds to beat Thailand\u2019s Jirapong Meenapra.\n\nThe 17-year-old Bolarinwa has the fastest time this year among 16- and 17-year-olds \u2014 a 10.39 in London this month. Skeen, a 16-year-old whose lanky style has some likening him to his compatriot Bolt, ran a 10.46 in Jamaica.\n\n\u201cI thought let me go there, go hard and see if anyone can go faster,\u201d Bolarinwa said. \u201cIt was a good performance overall.\u201d\n\nSkeen was less thrilled with his performance, blaming his slower time on two false starts by other competitors. But he said come Saturday\u2019s final, he would win.\n\nBolarinwa and Skeen will face each other for the first time and are still sizing one another up. Skeen, for example, was surprised to hear that it was Bolarinwa and not himself who has run the fastest 100 this year. Marvin Bracy of the United States ran the second fastest but is not at the Games.\n\nOrganizers of the first Youth Olympics have emphasized participation rather than winning, but that was lost on Bolarinwa and Skeen, who both predicted they would win Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big showdown,\u201d Bolarinwa said. \u201cHe\u2019s not really a quick starter. We know that already,\u201d Bolarinwa said. \u201cHis pick up is fantastic and so is mine. If I get a good start, he\u2019ll have to take me.\u201d\n\nBolarinwa\u2019s coach John Powell chimed in later: \u201cBring it on.\u201d\n\nBoth boys seemed to relish the comparison to Bolt and their budding rivalry to that of Bolt and Tyson Gay. Told he has been compared to a miniature Bolt, Skeen just smiled and said he one day dreams of surpassing his idol.\n\n\u201cI want to be better than Bolt,\u201d said Skeen, whose goal it is to win gold at the 2012 Olympics in London. \u201cI want to be much more faster.\u201d\n\nBolarinwa enjoyed being likened to the two sprinting greats, but wants to surpass them.\n\n\u201cThese guys are fantastic. You look at what they have done. You want to be better than them,\u201d Bolarinwa said. \u201cBut it\u2019s good to have them in the back your mind to look up to.\u201d\n\nWatching Skeen\u2019s heat, Powell said he saw some of Bolt in Skeen. But he was quick to point out that a lot can change with an athlete by the time they reach adulthood. He noted that Bolt, for example, started out running 200- and 400-metre before exploding on the stage in the 100.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know how they will develop, this is the thing,\u201d Powell said of Skeen. \u201cHe\u2019s about 16 and that is two or three years of formative years as an athlete. He could broaden out. He obviously has a good stride. If I looked at him \u2014 not that you can stereotype athletes these days \u2014 I\u2019d say he is a typical 200-metre runner.\u201d\n\nIn other action Wednesday, Lithuania rower Rolandas Mascinskas upset Germany\u2019s two-time world junior champion German Felix Bach to win the junior men\u2019s single sculls gold.\n\nIn the women\u2019s single sculls, Judith Sievers of Germany beat Nataliia Kovalova of Ukraine.

McCabe was second in 2:24.81, which was also good enough to qualify for London.\n\nThose times are currently the second- and third-fastest in the world this year, according to Swimming Canada, behind the 2:22.73 of reigning Olympic champion Rebecca Soni of the U.S.\n\nWith one day of trials remaining Sunday, 30 athletes have earned the right to represent Canada in the pool in London.\n\nA maximum of two swimmers per event can qualify with the exception freestyle because four swimmers have to be chosen for the relay.\n\nJulia Wilkinson of Stratford, Ont., picked up her third victory by winning the 100-metre freestyle. Runner-up Victoria Poon of Hong Kong also qualified.\n\nToronto's Heather MacLean and Samantha Cheverton of Pointe-Claire, Que., round out the women's freestyle relay team.\n\nJoe Bartoch of London, Ont., will race the men's Olympic 100-metre butterfly for the second time in his career. Toronto's Tobias Oriwol qualified in the men's 200-metre backstroke.\n\nVancouver's Savannah King and Toronto's Alexa Komarnycky finished first and second respectively in the women's 800-metre freestyle to book their tickets to London. King also qualified in the 400-metres earlier this week.\n\nVan Beilen burst into tears when she finished second in the 100 breaststroke Tuesday and qualified for London for the first time.\n\nThe pressure to make the Olympic team off her shoulders, the first-year University of British Columbia student was more in control of her emotions Saturday.\n\n\"I said to myself this morning if I do end up making the team, the tears are going to stay inside of me this time,\" she said. \"A lot of people came up to me two days ago saying I got them to tears, so I didn't want to do that again.\n\n\"I wanted to race and have fun and be more happy when I came out.\"\n\nPierse, who still holds the long-course record of 2:20.12 set in 2009, was fifth in 2:27.14.\n\n\"It's actually really hard to see because I know how much Annamay has put into the sport and she's a really hard worker,\" McCabe said. \"We really wouldn't be where we are today in breaststroke if it wasn't for Annamay.\n\n\"She still has the world record, so she knows something we don't know still. You can't take away from her.\"\n\nPierce is the second swim star to fall short of the Olympic team at these trials. Mike Brown, fourth in the 100-metre breaststroke at the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing, also did not qualify.\n\nAfter setting the world record in 2009, Pierse had a difficult season. She suffered through a debilitating bout of dengue fever contracted at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi.\n\n\"It really has been the hardest two or three years of my life,\" Pierse said through her tears. \"This is sport. It's what I love about it. It's what I hate about it, the ups and the downs.\n\n\"Unfortunately, I've had more downs than ups in the last little while.\"\n\nWilkinson was also first in the 100-metre backstroke and the 200-metre individual medley at trials. She'll try for a fourth win in the 200-metre backstroke Sunday.\n\n\"My dad, when I was little, used to bribe me to do well at meets, so he said on the subway today 'you know, if you go four-for-four I'll buy you an iPad,'\" Wilkinson said. \"The 200-back is going to be hard, but iPad right?\"\n\nBartoch says Canada needs more depth in men's butterfly.\n\n\"A couple of years ago, I put it out (there) if somebody beats me, I'll retire,\" the 29-year-old said. \"No one's really come up to the challenge yet. When Mike Minentko retired, there was a big void there. I had to catch up where he was.\n\n\"I wish somebody was coming up. No one is coming to London and saying 'I want to train with Joe Bartoch and do what he's doing' so they're kind of paying for it It's always good to train with someone faster than you. I've been around for awhile so I have a lot of advice I could give.\"\n\nOriwol finished 15th in backstroke in the event in Beijing.\n\n\"My hopes are to be deep in the final,\" Oriwol said. \"As you can see already at the Olympic trials, if you're in the final anything can happen. Upsets happen and people don't swim like they're supposed to. Once I'm in the final, I just want to have a lane.\"\n\nMcCabe was cheered on a large contingent in green T-shirts that said \"Team Fleabag.\"\n\n\"My dad used to call me the flea growing up,\" she explained. \"I didn't know they were going to do that.\"\n\nMcCabe cautioned than even though she and Van Beilen posted eye-catching times, there are other countries who have yet to hold their Olympic trials and everyone will be quicker come London.\n\n\"Those times might get bumped down,\" McCabe said. \"Whether they do or not, by the time we get there, we're going to have to be faster.\"\n\nThe Paralympic trials are running in conjunction with trials. Montreal's Benoit Huot won his fourth race in as many nights with a victory in the 100-metre butterfly.\n\nValeria Grand-Maison, a triple gold medallist at the 2008 Paralympics, was fastest in the 100-metre butterfly.\n\nSummer Mortimer of Burlington, Ont., took the women's 100-metre freestyle.

Van Beilen also competed in the 200m breaststroke after winning the event at the Canadian Trials, knocking world record holder Annamay Pierse off the Canadian Olympic team in the process. Van Beilen had competed at the inaugural Youth Olympic Games in 2010, winning three medals including gold in the 100m breaststroke. Her multi-sport competition experience includes the 2011 and 2013 Universiades, where she won a pair of silver medals in her first appearance.

She\u2019s eight years old, in that chubby phase every kid goes through, swimming her first novice swim practice ever without any goggles. When she finishes, the first thing she says to her mum, after asking to get some goggles, is when the next swim practice is. All it took was one swim practice to get her hooked, and she hasn\u2019t looked back since.\n\nTera Van Beilen is an unbreakable force in the pool. In a solid 15-year career, she\u2019s made waves in the world of competitive swimming. She has been a part of four CIS championship teams with the UBC Thunderbirds, participated in the inaugural Youth Olympic Games in 2010 and won a pair of silvers at the 2011 and 2013 Universiades. Most notably, she qualified for her first Olympic Games in 2012 in the 100m and 200m breaststroke events.\n\nBut after 15 years of furious training and competing, Van Beilen has decided to hang up her suit and goggles, and retire from competitive swimming after missing the qualifying standard for the Rio 2016 Olympic games. This can be a heavy hit for most athletes, but Tera was smiling and positive when she spoke to us.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little shocked to be going through as much joy as I am now. I love the sport so much, and I will miss it \u2026 Swimming teaches you how to deal with these situations and making the best of what comes about and I think that's been really important in this transition phase,\u201d Van Beilen said.\n\nThis was not an easy decision either. After devoting years of her life to this sport, she reflects on her career and has no regrets.\n\n\u201cI didn't want to go into Olympic Trials thinking \u2018If I don't make the Olympics, life is over\u2019. I wanted to go in with confidence that I could potentially make it, and at the end of the day I actually swam the fastest that I ever had in four years and I have no regrets about the way I swam and the training and the last year. It's just the other girls were faster.\u201d\n\nVan Beilen isn\u2019t unfamiliar with this change in dynamics and \"passing the torch\". When she qualified for the Olympics back in 2012, she beat out reigning Canadian champion and record holder Annamay Pierse for the gold medal and the elusive spot on the Canadian team.\n\n\u201cMaking the Olympics was something that I actually didn't think I would realistically do in 2012, I thought it would be more of a 2016 goal and ended up doing it. In the moment after touching the wall, it was still something that was so surreal. Now, looking back on it, I will forever be an Olympian.\u201d\n\nYou could argue that she owes a bit of her success to the time that she\u2019s spent in Vancouver, especially at UBC. Despite receiving offers for full-ride scholarships from many American colleges, Van Beilen made the \u201chardest choice of her life.\u201d She decided to attend UBC to pursue her Olympic dreams.\n\n\u201cThe head coach of the Vancouver (High Performance) Centre flew to my house for dinner, and told me everything about UBC, and I was like it's a no-brainer. I need to come to this school. I would be training with Joseph Nagy, who's one of the best breaststroke coaches in the world, and putting myself in a tough environment where most of the members of the team had qualified for international competitions, all while earning a degree. Really, there\u2019s no other choice that seemed as perfect as UBC,\u201d said Van Beilen.\n\nAfter five years of gruelling high-performance training \u2014 including 10 two-hour swim practices a week alongside five hours of dryland training and balancing full-time schooling \u2014 Van Beilen feels blessed to have had this opportunity.\n\n\u201cI came [to UBC] because I wanted to make the Olympic team, that was my dream since I was a little kid. So I said whatever is going to get me there, I'm going to do. To get a degree at the same time too? It was tough, but I'm glad it did it,\u201d Van Beilen said.\n\nAs she heads into her final months at UBC, Van Beilen is finishing up her kinesiology degree and hopes to hit the pool again sometime soon. More importantly, she\u2019s looking towards the future with bright eyes, a positive attitude and some valuable life lessons under her wings.\n\n\u201cThere are flips and flops in swimming, and that's what is so exciting. You win and you lose. Here I am now, happy and excited,\u201d said Van Beilen.\n\nWho knows what\u2019s next for this Olympian, but we\u2019re sure it won\u2019t be the last we see of Tera Van Beilen."}, {"url": "https://www.swimontario.com/news/canada-games-legacy-series-tera-van-beilen/", "page_content": "April 12, 2022\n\nTera Van Beilen\n\nOver the next few weeks, Swim Ontario is presenting the Canada Games Legacy Series, where we take a look back at swimmers who represented Team Ontario at past Canada Summer Games.\n\nThere is something to be said about inspiring girls to become confident in sport, and believe that greatness is possible.\n\nTera (Van Beilen) Maloney knows that feeling because she has experienced it. Now, in many ways, she\u2019s an icon of success for others.\n\nIt may have been back when she was five years old, benefitting from a pool in her home backyard, that a light started to trickle. One of a youngster\u2019s desire to be competitive, noticed, and having that desire to win.\n\nVan Beilen, now married and whose maiden name we will use in this feature, has many stories about her younger years in the world of arts and sports. There were those ballet lessons, playing piano and the introduction to soccer.\n\nBut it was always swimming that superseded everything else.\n\nShe eloquently described it as \u201cthat urge to stay in the pool, never get out and even, at times, want to eat dinner while in the water\u201d.\n\nThat may have been an early taste of what would lie ahead for this water baby.\n\nThere\u2019s a New York city pop band, called American Authors, known for the song \u201cThe Best Days of My Life\u201d.

It wasn\u2019t any of the events she competed in - the Commonwealth Games, FINA World championships or even the Summer Olympics.\n\nIt all started in 2009, in Charlottetown, P.E.I., at the Canada Summer Games.\n\nCanada\u2019s national spotlight on amateur sport was where Van Beilen would begin to relish fame with a remarkable performance and go on to win six gold medals.\n\n\u201cI remember it very well and asking myself \u2013 how did I do this,\u201d she said in a recent telephone conversation. \u201cAlso, medalling at the Canadian Nationals and realizing that I was able to do more than just the breaststroke, but also compete in the relays and help my team. That was the year that started my competitive swim career.\u201d\n\nWith the beautiful Niagara Region of Ontario hosting the 2022 Canada Summer Games in August, an event that brings together some 5,000 promising athletes, a mere mention of those days brings back fond memories for Van Beilen, who has a Maple Leaf tattoo on one of her toes.\n\n\u201cThe Canada Summer Games were an incredible experience, a special time in my life and a glimpse at top level athletes in many sports,\u201d she said, while also confirming a rumour that she liked to eat yoghurt-covered raisins before competing.\n\n\u201cThings were different in my day, as you could be a National calibre athlete in those Games. But now, it\u2019s really focussed for younger kids with potential \u2013 more of a stepping stone for success, to experience and cherish the moment. It could very well be the start of something big for many.\u201d\n\nWhile she graduated from King\u2019s Christian Collegiate in Oakville, a school that now has the \u201cVan Beilen Endeavour Award\u201d given to a student who excels in arts, music, or sports outside of school, her swim keys to success started with the Oakville Aquatic Club.\n\nChoosing post-secondary education in Canada, over numerous athletic scholarship offers from schools throughout the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), Van Beilen picked the University of British Columbia.\n\nNot only did she continue her academic honors success, and left UBC with a Degree in Kinesiology, but she was on the Thunderbirds incredible swim team that won four consecutive Canadian Interuniversity Sports (now re-branded to USports) championships.\n\nThere was also the Swim Youth Olympics in Singapore, where she won three medals, that would come a year after the Canada Summer Games. One who excelled in the breaststroke, Van Beilen would add one major event after another. Then came the electrifying and emotional time in her life that she will never forget.\n\n\u201cThe Canadian Olympic Trials in Montreal, I knew when I had touched the wall that made the qualifying time needed to make Canada\u2019s team for the 2012 Games in London (England),\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine the feeling of representing your country at the Olympics.\u201d\n\nThat was the same Van Beilen, who didn\u2019t like wearing swim goggles or a bathing cap as a youngster, and preferred to sleep in on mornings devoted to swim practices.

The coaches on hand pressed the Van Beilens to intensify Tera\u2019s twice-a-week training schedule.\n\nBut through grade school it remained a hobby and a physical outlet, rather than an obsession.\n\nToday, Van Beilen, a distinctly unchubby 18-year-old, is headed to the London Olympics, a surprise medal contender in the 100m and 200m breaststroke.\n\nGenetics must have something to do with this.

Reinders played only eight games of football at any level before being signed by the Cleveland Browns.\n\nLike her gargantuan cousin, Van Beilen\u2019s progression is proof to parents everywhere that a child can master a sport without sacrificing every other thing it means to be a child.\n\n\u201cThey let me have swimming and still have school. I had both worlds,\u201d Van Beilen says.\n\nRight into high school, Van Beilen played other sports. It wasn\u2019t until age 15 that she made swimming her focus.\n\nA great many athletic stories \u2014 both amateur and pro \u2014 start precociously early and are filled with nothing from then on but practice and competition. In an extreme example, 10-year-old Alexander Ovechkin played in a hockey tournament the day after his brother died.\n\nVan Beilen went to a regular school \u2014 Oakville\u2019s Kings Christian Collegiate \u2014 rather than a sporting academy. On Friday nights, she watched Say Yes to the Dress with her mom. She went out with friends on Saturdays. She attended the birthright of all typical teens \u2014 the prom.\n\nEven after swimming became her job, she treated it like one \u2014 a Monday-to-Friday thing. However, it was an exhausting Monday to Friday thing.\n\nShe was cut a few breaks at school. Teachers would occasionally let her go out to her car and sleep through a class. Her mother, Sharon, an administrator at the school, set up a quiet room for Van Beilen to nap through her spares.\n\nShe graduated last year. She now attends Swimming Canada\u2019s branch office in Vancouver, the University of British Columbia. Five of Canada\u2019s pool Olympians were studying and training at UBC last year.\n\nA year ago, the Olympics were a dream for Van Beilen. Literally. She began having dreams about touching the wall, looking up at the clock and seeing herself qualified. She has a picture of the rings pasted over her bed at home and at school.\n\nBut that\u2019s all they were. At that point Van Beilen was ranked 18th in the world in the 100-metre event, and 23rd in the 200-metre. That put her 5th and 3rd, respectively, on Canada\u2019s depth chart in events where only two competitors qualify.\n\nIn February, hope began to turn to belief when she finished first in the 100-metre at the CIS Championships and a narrow second to UBC teammate and fellow Olympian Martha McCabe in the 200.\n\n\u201cThat was when I began to say to myself, \u2018I know I can do this\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn March, she went to the Olympic trials in Montreal. She first qualified in the 100-metre by placing second, a mild surprise. But it was her performance in the 200-metre that brought her to global attention.\n\nVan Beilen finished first in the 200-metre final, pushing third-place finisher and current world record holder Annamay Pierse off Canada\u2019s Olympic team. Her time of 2:24:03 was, at that point, the second fastest in the world this year.\n\nThe day after qualifying, she flew back to Vancouver to sit a physiology exam she had very purposely put out of her mind while she concentrated on the trials. She got a 57.\n\n\u201cMom, I got a 57!\u201d Van Beilen excitedly told her mother. Sharon was less excited.\n\nShe looks pretty excited now, snapping pictures of Star photographer Steve Russell while he takes pictures of Tera sitting on the diving board of that family pool. Sharon\u2019s wearing a Team Van Beilen t-shirt. Tera\u2019s childhood trophies are piled up in boxes in the hallway of their Oakville cottage. They\u2019ve just returned from display at Tera\u2019s grade school.\n\nFather Harry, an executive with Tim Hortons, drifts in on his lunch hour to take in the scene. The Van Beilens didn\u2019t push their daughter into sport, but they\u2019re enjoying watching her flower in that world.\n\n\u201cI think Tera likes it, too,\u201d Harry says, in that teasing way a father says things within earshot of his children.\n\n\u201cLikes what?\u201d Tera says.\n\n\u201cThe attention,\u201d Harry says.\n\n\u201cRight, dad,\u201d Tera drawls sarcastically, 18 going on 13 for just a moment. They catch each other\u2019s eye and smile. This has the feel of a family routine that\u2019s been perfected over many years.\n\nNobody made Tera Van Beilen do anything. Left to her own youthful devices, she has put herself on the cusp of something that will last long after youth has faded.\n\nRELATED\n\nProfile: Diver Jennifer Abel\n\nProfile: Swimmer Julia Wilkinson\n\nProfile: Mountain biker Catharine Pendrel\n\nProfile: Rowing\u2019s Lesley Thompson-Willie\n\nLondon Olympic quiz\n\nKEY COMPETITORS\n\nRebecca Soni, U.S.A.100 and 200 No woman in the world dominates a single stroke the way Soni dominates breaststroke. She has three Olympic medals, has held four world records and is the defending world champion at both the 100m and 200m distance. Soni is the clear favourite in both of Van Beilen\u2019s events.\n\nJessica Hardy, U.S.A.100 The world\u2019s dominant breaststroker until a doping suspension cost her an appearance in Beijing, where Soni eclipsed her.

The swim has won a total of five medals so far in the competition.\n\nLindsay Delmar of Calgary was fifth in the women\u2019s 50 butterfly Wednesday.\n\nThe Youth Olympics are for athletes 14-18 and have attracted more than 3,000 athletes in the same sports program that is set for the 2012 London Games.\n\nRussia has nine golds and 19 medals overall, while China has nine golds and 15 medals overall. Azerbaijan is third with five golds, while Italy has four. Canada has a total of eight medals so far, including three gold.\n\nIn the women\u2019s 100 breaststroke, Van Beilen nailed her second length to emerge with the gold in one minute 8.95 seconds. Emily Selig of Australia was second in 1:09.06 and Nicol, first at the turn, followed in third in 1:09.18.\n\n\u201cIt feels amazing to win gold,\u201d said the 17-year-old Van Beilen. \u201cI came into this meet wanting to win a medal, and after the prelims and semis I felt I had a shot at the gold. I didn\u2019t realize I was second at the turn, but I saw Rachel beside me and my strength in this race has always been my second half.\u201d\n\nNicol was at a personal best pace on the first length Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI had never gone out that fast before,\u201d Nicol said. \u201cOn the second length I got a bit tired and my stroke shortened a bit. Still I\u2019m not disappointed especially that Tera also got on the podium. It was a really close race and exciting for all of us.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Britain\u2019s David Bolarinwa and Jamaica\u2019s Odane Skeen won their qualifying heats in the 100 metres, setting up a much anticipated final between two sprinters touted as the next Usain Bolt.\n\nBolarinwa blew away the field in his heat, finishing in 10.62 seconds. Skeen got out slowly but surged to run 10.63 seconds to beat Thailand\u2019s Jirapong Meenapra.\n\nThe 17-year-old Bolarinwa has the fastest time this year among 16- and 17-year-olds \u2014 a 10.39 in London this month. Skeen, a 16-year-old whose lanky style has some likening him to his compatriot Bolt, ran a 10.46 in Jamaica.\n\n\u201cI thought let me go there, go hard and see if anyone can go faster,\u201d Bolarinwa said. \u201cIt was a good performance overall.\u201d\n\nSkeen was less thrilled with his performance, blaming his slower time on two false starts by other competitors. But he said come Saturday\u2019s final, he would win.\n\nBolarinwa and Skeen will face each other for the first time and are still sizing one another up. Skeen, for example, was surprised to hear that it was Bolarinwa and not himself who has run the fastest 100 this year. Marvin Bracy of the United States ran the second fastest but is not at the Games.\n\nOrganizers of the first Youth Olympics have emphasized participation rather than winning, but that was lost on Bolarinwa and Skeen, who both predicted they would win Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big showdown,\u201d Bolarinwa said. \u201cHe\u2019s not really a quick starter. We know that already,\u201d Bolarinwa said. \u201cHis pick up is fantastic and so is mine. If I get a good start, he\u2019ll have to take me.\u201d\n\nBolarinwa\u2019s coach John Powell chimed in later: \u201cBring it on.\u201d\n\nBoth boys seemed to relish the comparison to Bolt and their budding rivalry to that of Bolt and Tyson Gay. Told he has been compared to a miniature Bolt, Skeen just smiled and said he one day dreams of surpassing his idol.\n\n\u201cI want to be better than Bolt,\u201d said Skeen, whose goal it is to win gold at the 2012 Olympics in London. \u201cI want to be much more faster.\u201d\n\nBolarinwa enjoyed being likened to the two sprinting greats, but wants to surpass them.\n\n\u201cThese guys are fantastic. You look at what they have done. You want to be better than them,\u201d Bolarinwa said. \u201cBut it\u2019s good to have them in the back your mind to look up to.\u201d\n\nWatching Skeen\u2019s heat, Powell said he saw some of Bolt in Skeen. But he was quick to point out that a lot can change with an athlete by the time they reach adulthood. He noted that Bolt, for example, started out running 200- and 400-metre before exploding on the stage in the 100.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know how they will develop, this is the thing,\u201d Powell said of Skeen. \u201cHe\u2019s about 16 and that is two or three years of formative years as an athlete. He could broaden out. He obviously has a good stride. If I looked at him \u2014 not that you can stereotype athletes these days \u2014 I\u2019d say he is a typical 200-metre runner.\u201d\n\nIn other action Wednesday, Lithuania rower Rolandas Mascinskas upset Germany\u2019s two-time world junior champion German Felix Bach to win the junior men\u2019s single sculls gold.\n\nIn the women\u2019s single sculls, Judith Sievers of Germany beat Nataliia Kovalova of Ukraine. Britain beat out Australia for the women\u2019s pair final to claim its second gold in two days and Slovenia edged Greece in the men\u2019s final.\n\nIn men\u2019s 77-kilogram weightlifting, Russia\u2019s Artem Okulov took gold ahead of Thailand\u2019s Chatuphum Chinnawong and Russian lifters won another gold and a silver Wednesday.\n\nWith files from The Associated Press\n\nSHARE:"}, {"url": "https://www.zimbio.com/Tera+Van+Beilen", "page_content": "Overview\n\nA zine about Tera Van Beilen, with news, pictures, and articles.

She was the family\u2019s most enthusiastic user of the backyard pool (she remembers summer days with her sister, Marya, dropping marbles into the deep end, seeing who could come up with the most).\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a Eureka moment. Tera liked swimming enough to make it a regular thing. She got pretty good at it pretty fast. The coaches on hand pressed the Van Beilens to intensify Tera\u2019s twice-a-week training schedule.\n\nBut through grade school it remained a hobby and a physical outlet, rather than an obsession.\n\nToday, Van Beilen, a distinctly unchubby 18-year-old, is headed to the London Olympics, a surprise medal contender in the 100m and 200m breaststroke.\n\nGenetics must have something to do with this. Her uncle, Wayne Van Dorp, played for the Blackhawks and the Penguins. Her cousin, Joel Reinders, is an offensive tackle with the New York Giants.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the one protecting Eli Manning. Or is it Peyton Manning? I\u2019m not sure. One of the Mannings,\u201d Van Beilen said.\n\nThe illusion of athletic effortlessness is also a family thing. Reinders played only eight games of football at any level before being signed by the Cleveland Browns.\n\nLike her gargantuan cousin, Van Beilen\u2019s progression is proof to parents everywhere that a child can master a sport without sacrificing every other thing it means to be a child.\n\n\u201cThey let me have swimming and still have school.

Like we\u2019ve seen from many countries outside of the European continent, the federation is sending very much of a slimmed-down squad to the meet.\n\nThe women\u2019s side will carry a lot more fireworks than the men\u2019s side will on this roster, including the country\u2019s top two breaststrokers Martha McCabe and Tera van Beilen. The MacLean sisters, Brittany and Heather are also joining this squad off of Canada\u2019s Olympic team; as is butterflier Katerine Savard.\n\nOn the men\u2019s side, the only Olympian is Tommy Gossland, who was a member of the Canadian 400 free relay team that finished 10th overall.\n\nIt\u2019s also interesting to note the split between swimmers who compete/competed in the NCAA (America\u2019s college system) and the CIS (Canada\u2019s college system). This has become a hot-button issue as Canada pushes to develop their domestic system.\n\nTwo on this roster, Brittany MacLean and Chantal van Landeghem, swim in the United States at Georgia. This meet will fit well into their schedule, as Georgia is already sending a big contingent to the meet, including Allison Schmitt, Shannon Vreeland, Megan Romano, and former Bulldog Mark Dylla.\n\nOther NCAA swimmers on this roster include Jake Tapp, a former Arizona Wildcat, and Warren Barnes, a former Pitt Pantherl, but it is largely a home-grown lineup for Istanbul. The curveball is Andrew Poznikoff, who will be the first member of the Simon Fraser Canadian/NCAA crossover squad to make an international roster after they\u2019ve begun official NCAA competition.\n\nThe City of Vancouver continues to be Canada\u2019s hotbed for swimming talent, as 5 of the 14 members of the team represent the Vancouver Dolphins, and over half (8 out of 14) coming from the National Swim Centre there. That includes Luke Peddie, an exciting young freestyler who just missed the Olympic Team."}, {"url": "https://www.cbc.ca/sports/canadian-swimmer-earns-silver-at-youth-olympics-1.955624", "page_content": "Canada capped off the Youth Olympics swim meet with a silver medal Friday.\n\nTera Van Beilen of Oakville, Ont., finished second in the women's 200-metre breaststroke.\n\nThe eight-member Canadian swim team ends the meet with seven medals: two gold, a silver and four bronze.\n\nEmily Selig of Australia won the 200 breaststroke gold in two minutes 27.78 seconds.

I knew Emily would be strong in this race so I started smoothly but I knew I really had to pick it up if I wanted to be on the podium.\"\n\nLindsay Delmar of Calgary was fifth in the women's 100 butterfly and Kyle McIntee was sixth in the men's 200 fly.\n\nCanada was fifth in the mixed 4x100 medley.\n\nChinese athletes collected three swimming golds to help extend their lead to 18 golds and 28 medals overall. Russia is second with 12 golds and 26 overall while South Korea has six golds.

I thought I had a good routine -- way better than in qualifying.\"\n\nCurtis Gerein of Kelowna, B.C., was seventh on the men's side after doing what he called \"the best routine I've had all year.\"\n\nDominique Shone of Langley, B.C., was a member of the North and Central American team that finished sixth in the team show jumping.\n\nMeanwhile, British diver Tom Daley gave his team a boost when he announced he will participate despite injuring a triceps at the European Championships.\n\nDaley, who became the youngest diver at 15 to win a world title in men's platform this year, withdrew from the Europeans last weekend and said he might not participate in the inaugural Youth Games. But Daley said on Friday he would compete in the three-meter springboard on Sunday.\n\n\"It's gotten a lot better. I've got quite a good range of movement so I'd say I'm like 75 per cent,\" the 16-year-old Daley said. \"I have to compromise some of my diving technique to make sure my arm doesn't go into overstretch.\"\n\nDaley, however, did withdraw from the 10-metre platform as a precaution. He is probably the best known athlete at the Games.\n\n\"When I first injured it, I was at about 20 per cent fitness,\" Daley said. \"I couldn't even get in the water and dive or straighten my arm.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Haiti made it to the boys' soccer semifinals, coming from a goal down to beat Vanuatu 2-1.\n\nHaiti, which was severely damaged by an earthquake in January that left an estimated 300,000 people dead, looked like it might make an early exit from the tournament after losing its opening game 9-0 to Bolivia. Its semifinal opponent will be Singapore, which beat Macedonia 3-2.\n\n\"It's more than a victory,\" said Fritz Gerald Wong, head of Haiti's delegation. \"Any single thing that a Haitian accomplishes is amazing.
