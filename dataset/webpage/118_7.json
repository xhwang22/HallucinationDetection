SDN relies on the controller to enable a centralized platform for management, configuration and programmability.\n\nA compelling benefit of SDN controllers is automation. Instead of manually configuring individual devices, network engineers can configure and distribute policies via the SDN controller. The controllers also support flexible path routing, reliability and visibility.\n\nBut some challenges with controllers include performance evaluation and controller selection, according to the book SDN-Supported Edge-Cloud Interplay for Next Generation Internet of Things from Taylor & Francis Group. In the book, Kshira Sagar Sahoo, Arun Solanki, Sambit Kumar Mishra, Bibhudatta Sahoo and Anand Nayyar compiled discussions on the convergence of edge computing, SDN and IoT.\n\nCommon SDN controllers include Floodlight, Nox, OpenDaylight, Open Network Operating System, Pox, Ryu and Trema. So, how do network teams choose from the various options? Some network engineers might prefer to select an SDN controller based on performance factors, such as throughput, latency and CPU usage, according to the editors. Others might look at the major features of a controller.\n\nHere are 10 common features of SDN controllers:\n\nOpenFlow -- a southbound API that directs flow requests forwarded by switches to a controller and vice versa. GUI -- receives and shows data about forwarding devices, configuration and application deployment. Northbound REST API -- enables communication between applications and the controller. Clustering -- improves scalability and controller performance. Quantum API -- calls from controller to cloud services. Synchronization -- responsible for how controllers store and respond to network data. Productivity -- affects the ease with which developers can create applications and use the controller's programming language. Partnership support -- the level of third-party support. Platform support -- the compatibility of SDN controllers with various OSes. Modularity -- the ability to create instructions and subroutines.\n\nBut the selection process might not be as clear as comparing performance versus features. Instead, network teams might need to use a hybrid approach that considers controller criteria, alternatives and priorities.\n\nBelow is a chapter excerpt from SDN-Supported Edge-Cloud Interplay for Next Generation Internet of Things: \"Performance Evaluation Methods for SDN Controllers.\" This chapter explores different components of SDN controllers and methods network teams can use to select a controller.\n\nAbout the editors\n\nKshira Sagar Sahoo received his Master of Technology (MTech) degree in information and communication technology from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur in Kharagpur, India, in 2014 and a Ph.D. in computer science and engineering from the National Institute of Technology (NIT) Rourkela in Rourkela, India, in 2019.

Previous research have investigated author productivity patterns within publications in one or a few CER venues at a time, showing that authorship patterns in many, but not all, venues, conform to Lotka\u2019s Law [29,30,31,32,33]. What does this mean? It has been argued that development of a scientific discipline progresses through the stages of incubation, growth, and maturity, and the activities of authors within these stages vary [23]. Lotka\u2019s Law may not be able to fully explain the distribution of authors in earlier stages than maturity [23]. The fact that some venues of CER satisfy Lotka\u2019s Law while others do not, could, perhaps, be one indication that some venues of CER are still in the earlier stages of incubation and growth, while others are more mature with regard to author productivity. In all, when evaluating the development of CER as a research discipline, Lotka\u2019s Law has, and can be, used as one indication of progress, together with e.g. Fensham\u2019s two sets of criteria for evaluating a scientific field (see Chap. 4 [17]), and the framework of scholarship by Glassick (see Chap. 2 [10]). Our analysis confirmed and extended the previous analyses by including a broader range of venues of CER, and the results indicate that CER publications do follow authorship patterns that resemble those found in other disciplines of science, too.\n\nAnalysis of publication data reveals a cohort of highly productive authors. Since the CER field was significantly different prior and after 2000, and to shed light to the previous times, we analysed the most contributing authors prior and post to 2000. The identified highly productive authors and their contributions shed light on works with high impact from recent and previous times, and may act as inspiration for researchers looking for innovative ideas, topics to work on, or partners for collaboration.\n\n8.2 Newcomers and Recurring Authors\n\nWith regard to author entrance patterns, previous research has shown that, as compared to general CS publication venues, in many, but not all [18], publication venues of CER, there is a significantly high proportion of papers written by all-newcomer author teams or oldtimers [21, 32]. Thus, previous analysis suggests that CER researchers have a tendency to stick more with nearby colleagues as compared to CS researchers, and also newcomers have harder time integrating as compared to CS researchers [21]. While a comparison between CER and CS was done, no thresholds were determined for introverted or extroverted profiles [21]. Previous findings suggest an introverted profile of CER, where papers are often authored either by a group of newcomers or a group of old-timers, who are already connected with each other, suggesting that newcomers might not integrate that well, at least if compared to general CS [18, 21, 32]. Our investigation sheds new light into these previous findings. With regard to times before 2000, papers written by newcomers clearly dominated the CER, with some 47.7% of papers written by newcomers. However, after 2000s, especially after around 2005, papers authored by a mixture of newcomers and old-timers became the largest category. After 2000, the shares of papers in these three categories were: all newcomers (30%), all recurring (33.7%), and mixed (36.2%). Future research could do a comparison of the authorship patterns in CER with other scientific disciplines. Our findings reveal that papers with all-newcomer author teams receive significantly less citations than papers in the other categories. When interpreting the findings it is good to note that, especially with regard to certain venues of CER, citation rates have been shown to be low [4].\n\n8.3 Collaboration and Building Bridges\n\nAnalysis of the co-author network reveals clusters of authorships between many highly influential authors, many of which are based in North America, but also including clusters that are based in the Nordic Region, Europe, Australasia, Israel, and many other parts of the globe. An analysis of top five keywords visible in all the published works in our dataset by the authors in each constellation shows similarities but also differences in the top keywords. Teaching programming, introductory courses, and K-12 seem to dominate. Other top five keywords of the constellations include gender and diversity, learning analytics and data mining, visualisations, data structures, block-based programming, game-based learning and others, giving hints about the focus areas in each of the constellations. However, such analysis is shallow without a proper inspection about the actual underlying research groups and communities and topics of research that are pursued in those. Co-authorship analyses or analyses of top keywords per author constellations do not reveal the deeper essence of the underlying author communities. Therefore, deeper analyses and research are needed to gain a more comprehensive picture about the influential research groups and underlying community structures. Many such analyses are provided in other chapters of this book.\n\nOur analyses of bridging communities highlighted, based on co-authorship patterns in the data, a specific group of authors, who have acted as bridges between separate communities of authors. It is important to build bridges between communities, which may have their own and unique specific and preferred goals, methods, ways of working, research cultures and values. Future research needs to investigate this issue with more depth.\n\n8.4 International Collaboration\n\nOur analysis shows that while a significant share of articles have been authored by international teams of authors, the major share of articles are still written by authors from a single country. These findings add to analyses of single publication venues of CER, such as that of ITiCSE, ICER and SIGCSE, which showed collaborations mostly happening within countries rather than between countries [37], with similar findings found with regard to Koli Calling [31], ACE [33], and other venues [5, 7, 26, 37]. The tendency of collaborating mostly with authors from one\u2019s own country raises the question about the impact of co-publishing in many venues of CER to co-authorship patterns. In a brief analysis about how the venues of dissemination are linked in co-publishing, a clear pattern emerges from authors who tend to publish their research in several of the known venues. Those venues of co-publishing may often be geographically located far away from each other, and attending requires international travels. A deeper analysis of the communities formed around these venues and the impact of conference attendance to publication habits is suggested as a future research.\n\n8.5 Limitations and Future Research\n\nAnalysing publication data can reveal many previously hidden aspects of authors and scientific communities. Analyses may bring visible systemic challenges, such as a tendency of newcomers to not integrate well in CER communities [21], patterns of collaboration, authorships, and citation habits. While there is a lot of research and concrete action around topics of diversity, inclusion, equity and broader participation in computing [24, 34], many aspects of participation are still hard to reach by analysing publication metrics. The deeper essence about the cultures of CER communities still remains beyond scientometric analyses, including communities\u2019 social structures, norms, values, management styles, attitudes, and hidden agendas, which together contribute to whether the members of the community and the community as a whole is healthy and thriving. To what extent do communities of CER provide a culture of challenge, inspiration and freedom that pushes its members to go beyond what is already known, tackle challenges, and grow as independent and innovative researchers? Additional data collection and measures are needed for deeper analyses of CER communities."}, {"url": "https://dl.acm.org/profile/81100070976/publications", "page_content": "Summary Description\n\nACM Author-Izer is a unique service that enables ACM authors to generate and post links on both their homepage and institutional repository for visitors to download the definitive version of their articles from the ACM Digital Library at no charge.\n\nDownloads from these sites are captured in official ACM statistics, improving the accuracy of usage and impact measurements.

Swanson believed laboratories weren't the only source of new scientific discoveries. Swanson, a specialist in the relationship between natural and computer languages, thought electronic databases also held the key to medical knowledge.\n\nA trailblazing information scientist, Swanson died Nov. 18 at age 88.\n\nConcerned that excessive specialization could inhibit scientific creativity, Swanson pioneered the field of literature-based discovery, which uses existing research to create new knowledge. The three-term dean of the University\u2019s Graduate Library School and professor emeritus in the Humanities Division believed that unearthing unseen links between two distinct areas of study could yield new discoveries\u2014what he called \u201cundiscovered public knowledge.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, Swanson received the ASIST Award of Merit, the highest honor from the American Society for Information Science & Technology, for his work.\n\nArrowsmith: \u2018An intellectual adventure\u2019\n\nSwanson famously tested his theory of undiscovered public knowledge with a 1986 paper in which he made a provocative connection between dietary fish oil and Raynaud\u2019s disease, a circulatory disorder.\n\nIn a search of the Medline database, which houses millions of scientific journal abstracts, Swanson found a common thread in research on Raynaud's disease and dietary fish oil. His hunting turned up numerous articles that described high blood viscosity in patients with Raynaud\u2019s disease; in a separate search, he found a body of research that showed dietary fish oil could reduce blood viscosity.\n\nThe implication of bringing these two literatures together was powerful: could fish oil, Swanson wondered, be used to treat Raynaud\u2019s disease?\n\nA clinical trial three years later validated the use of fish oil for patients with Raynaud\u2019s disease. Swanson later hypothesized a connection between migraine headaches and magnesium deficiency that was also subsequently supported by clinical research.\n\nSpurred on by these findings, Swanson and Neil Smalheiser of the University of Illinois at Chicago developed Arrowsmith, a piece of software that assists investigators in identifying connections between two sets of Medline articles.\n\nArrowsmith (named after the 1925 Sinclair Lewis novel) was aimed at building a \u201csystematic, computational\u201d method to find possible links among articles, Smalheiser said. \u201cThe computer was not supposed to generate discoveries, but it was supposed to identify and put together these potential assertions.\u201d\n\nThe Arrowsmith model proved influential, and the approach Swanson and Smalheiser developed has been adapted to study the correlations of genes with diseases and find possible new uses for medications.\n\nDespite the impact of Swanson and Smalheiser's work on Arrowsmith, \u201cWe never saw it as anything other than an intellectual adventure,\u201d Smalheiser said.\n\n\u2018Experiments with information\u2019 not salamanders\n\n\u201cDon was doing science, without dissecting a salamander,\u201d said Mark Olsen, assistant director of the American and French Research on the Treasury of the French Language (ARTFL) project, a major digital humanities project that was influenced by Swanson\u2019s work. \u201cHe was doing experiments with information.\u201d\n\nSwanson began his career studying physics as an undergraduate at the California Institute of Technology. He received his MA in physics from Rice University in 1947 and his PhD, also in physics, from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1952.\n\nEven in their early days, computers were a source of fascination for Swanson. \u201cI think he was always dazzled by the idea of the computer,\u201d said his wife, Patricia Swanson.\n\nSwanson worked as a computer systems analyst at Hughes Research & Development and research scientist at Ramo-Wooldridge Corp. & TRW, Inc., before he joined the UChicago faculty in 1963 as dean of the Graduate Library School (which closed in 1990). Swanson's background as a physical scientist set him apart from the seven previous deans of the school, who represented a variety of other disciplines.\n\nAt the GLS, Swanson initially focused on computer-aided information retrieval, an entirely new area of study at the time.\n\n\u201cAt the time Don began working on it, people simply couldn\u2019t imagine that you could retrieve information with a computer,\u201d said his colleague Abe Bookstein, professor emeritus in the Humanities. \u201cIn a field that was very qualitative, Don was instrumental in introducing quantitative formal techniques.\u201d\n\nHe was also a rigorous and encouraging teacher, according to his former GLS student Charles Blair, who remembered Swanson for his \u201cvery clean, organized and methodical approach to his subject.\u201d\n\nSwanson happily lent his expertise to colleagues around the University. In the early days of the ARTFL project, Prof. Robert Morrissey came to Swanson for advice on how to handle organization of the massive new database. \u201cHe told me, \u2018What this project needs is a little sunshine and water,\u201d remembered Morrissey, the Benjamin Franklin Professor of French Literature and director of ARTFL. \u201cHe was very generous with his time.\u201d\n\nThat generosity was not unusual for Swanson, according to Smalheiser\u2014Swanson went \u201cout of his way to be nice and encouraging,\u201d Smalheiser said.\n\nSwanson\u2019s quiet manner belied a mischievous sense of humor that led him to write satiric articles, for example, \u201cNew Horizons in Psychoanalysis: Treatment of Necrosistic Personality Disorders,\u201d in Perspectives in Biology and Medicine (1986).\n\nNot only intellectually witty but also physically fit, Swanson was an avid runner who completed a half-marathon at the age of 80.\n\nBut his work was by far his greatest passion, according to Patricia Swanson. \u201cHe was always trying to do something better,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition to his wife, Swanson is survived by his son, Richard B. Swanson; and his daughter, Judith A. Swanson, PhD\u201987. Another son, Douglas A. Swanson, died in 2004.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations in Swanson\u2019s honor may be made to the University of Chicago Library, the Nature Conservancy or the Heritage Foundation."}, {"url": "https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/brodersen.html", "page_content": "Robert W.

His researches on quantum adiabatic approximation and induced gauge fields, begun 20 years ago, have redrawn attentions in the field quantum optics with cold atoms, which has motivated new advances including scheme of separating chiral molecules by utilizing the Stern-Garlach effect of induced gauge fields by himself and his collaborators in 2007. His research on the dynamical sensitivity of quantum phase transitions has drawn much attention since 2006, because of its connections to various research fields in physics, such as quantum measurement, quantum chaos and condensed matter physics. Some experiments based on NMR et al have well fit this theoretical prediction. Currently, his research interests include probing mathematical structures behind the dynamics of physical systems, such as quantum groups related to the Yang-Baxter equation, Berry geometric phase related to general gauge symmetry and ?nite-size thermodynamic systems far off equilibrium. He explored the fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics, e.g., open quantum system approaches to quantum measurement and decoherence, and quantum statistical thermodynamics. His researches are partially oriented to future quantum technologies, such as quantum information processing, quantum coherent devices and also the new generation of energy based on the artificial photosynthesis with quantum effects. He yearn for a \"down-to-earth\" understanding of fundamental problems in quantum mechanics in association with the most recent experiments about circuit QED using super-conducting systems, optomechanics with micro/nano-mechanical resonators, the photon transport in low-dimensional confined structure, and ultra-cold atoms in Bose-Einstein condensate.\n\nBack to Top\n\nJoseph J.
