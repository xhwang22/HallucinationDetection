{"Robert Emmett Keane was married to Mary Pickford.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mary-Pickford", "page_content": "Mary Pickford, original name Gladys Louise Smith, also known as Gladys Marie Smith, (born April 9, 1892, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\u2014died May 29, 1979, Santa Monica, California, U.S.), Canadian-born American motion-picture actress who was \u201cAmerica\u2019s sweetheart\u201d of the silent screen and one of the first film stars. At the height of her career, she was one of the richest and most famous women in the United States.\n\n(Read Lillian Gish\u2019s 1929 Britannica essay on silent film.)\n\nBritannica Quiz Pop Culture Quiz\n\nGladys Louise Smith grew up in precarious financial circumstances. Shortly after the death of her father, she began taking child\u2019s roles in productions, and soon the rest of the family also began acting. She made her first stage appearance in a Toronto stock company at the age of seven. At eight she went on tour, and within 10 years she was playing on Broadway. She made her New York debut in David Belasco\u2019s The Warrens of Virginia in December 1907. Belasco suggested that she change her name to Mary Pickford. At age 14 she had already learned more about stagecraft than many older actors, and her winsome face, framed by a mass of golden curls, made her appeal virtually irresistible.\n\nPickford began working as a motion-picture extra at D.W. Griffith\u2019s Biograph Company, starring in his 1909 film The Violin Maker of Cremona. Though actors\u2019 names were not listed in film credits, Pickford\u2019s face quickly became well known. After appearing on Broadway in Belasco\u2019s production A Good Little Devil in 1913, she turned permanently to the screen, rising to first rank with Adolph Zukor\u2019s Famous Players Company. Her meteoric rise from an anonymous player to a star with her own production company (Mary Pickford Studios, created in 1916 by Famous Players) was attributable not only to the phenomenal popularity of her films but also to her dedication to her craft and her meticulous care in creating quality entertainments. The ringleted ingenue with an expression of sweet sincerity and invincible innocence that she played in such silent films as Hearts Adrift (1914), The Poor Little Rich Girl (1917), Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1917), Stella Maris (1918), and Johanna Enlists (1918) enthralled audiences everywhere. She was known at first as the \u201cBiograph Girl with the Curls\u201d and then as \u201cOur Mary\u201d when that much of her name was revealed. With the release of Tess of the Storm Country in 1914, she was firmly established as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweetheart.\u201d In 1917 First National Films paid her $350,000 for each of three films, including the very successful Daddy-Long-Legs (1919).\n\nIn 1919 Pickford took the lead in organizing the United Artists Corporation with Griffith, Charlie Chaplin, and Douglas Fairbanks. In 1920, after the dissolution of her first marriage (1911\u201319) to actor Owen Moore, she married Fairbanks (divorced 1936). Pickford\u2019s popularity continued unabated in Pollyanna (1920), Little Lord Fauntleroy (1921), Little Annie Rooney (1925), My Best Girl (1927), Coquette (1929; her first talking picture), The Taming of the Shrew (1929; her only film with Fairbanks), and Kiki (1931). Although she won an Academy Award for best actress for her performance in Coquette, Pickford\u2019s popularity began to wane with the advent of sound.\n\nAfter making Secrets (1933), her 194th film, Pickford retired from the screen. Thereafter she devoted herself to United Artists, of which she was first vice president from 1935 and for which she produced several films. She also wrote Why Not Try God? (1934), The Demi-Widow (1935), and My Rendezvous with Life (1935), and in the 1930s she appeared on radio. In 1937 she married actor Charles (\u201cBuddy\u201d) Rogers. Her later years were spent on business and civic and charitable activities, and she eventually became a recluse at Pickfair, the lavish estate she had built with Fairbanks. Sunshine and Shadow, her autobiography, was published in 1955. She received an honorary Oscar in 1976 for her contributions to film; she accepted the award from Pickfair."}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/actors/mary-pickford", "page_content": "(1892-1979)\n\nWho Was Mary Pickford?\n\nIn 1909, Mary Pickford appeared in 40 movies for D.W. Griffith's American Biography company. She also worked as a producer and co-founded United Artists, with Charlie Chaplin, and Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., who would become her second husband. Pickford retired from the screen in 1933 but continued to produce. She died in 1979.\n\nEarly Life\n\nActress, producer and screenwriter Gladys Mary Smith was born on April 8, 1892, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Known as \"America\u2019s Sweetheart,\" Mary Pickford was a legendary film actress during the age of silent pictures. She often appeared on screen in young girl roles, even when she was an adult. Pickford began performing at the age of five on the stage and was known for a time as \"Baby Gladys.\" After touring in different shows and productions for more than nine years, she went to New York to conquer Broadway. Taking the stage name, Mary Pickford, she made her Broadway debut in The Warrens of Virginia.\n\nSoon after the show\u2019s run, Pickford got into film, working for D. W. Griffith, a director and head of American Biography Company. At the time, most films were short and she appeared in more than 40 movies in 1909. When Griffith moved his operation to California the following year, Pickford went with him. Over the years, her fame grew as well as her salary. She became an international star, beloved for her beauty and charm.\n\nCreation of United Artists\n\nSome of Pickford\u2019s greatest films were a collaborative effort with friend and writer-director Frances Marion. Together they worked on such hits as Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1917) and Poor Little Rich Girl (1917). Pickford also worked behind the scenes as a producer and founded the United Artists (UA), a film company, in 1919, with Griffith, Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., who would become her second husband. She had been married to actor Owen Moore and divorced him to be with Fairbanks.\n\nPickford and Fairbanks married in 1920, becoming one of Hollywood\u2019s earliest super couples. Fans adored the pairing, and the couple were known to host fabulous events at their home, called Pickfair, which were attended by many of the leading figures in film.\n\nIn the 1920s, Pickford continued to score more box-office hits with Polyanna (1920) and Little Lord Fauntleroy (1922). She went on to help establish the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1927. Around this time, the film industry was changing and talking pictures were on the rise. In 1929, Pickford starred in her first talkie Coquette, which explored the dark side of a wealthy family. She won an Academy Award for her work on the film. Still she was never quite able to recreate the phenomenal success she had in silent pictures with the sound films. Her last film was 1933\u2019s Secrets.\n\nLater Years\n\nAfter retiring from the screen, Pickford continued to be involved in filmmaking. She worked as a producer on such films as One Rainy Afternoon (1936), Susie Steps Out (1946) and Sleep, My Love (1948). She also was on the board of directors for UA for many years. She married her third husband, Charles \u201cBuddy\u201d Rogers, in 1937. They adopted two children and stayed together until her death.\n\nDeath\n\nIn her final years, Pickford became reclusive. She largely stayed home at Pickfair and choosing to only see a select few friends. She died on May 29, 1979, in Santa Monica, California.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Mary Pickford\n\nBirth Year: 1892\n\nBirth date: April 8, 1892\n\nBirth City: Toronto\n\nBirth Country: Canada\n\nGender: Female\n\nBest Known For: Mary Pickford was a legendary silent film actress and was known as \"America\u2019s Sweetheart.\" She was a founder of United Artists and helped establish the Academy.\n\nIndustries\n\nFilm\n\nAstrological Sign: Aries\n\nDeath Year: 1979\n\nDeath date: May 29, 1979\n\nDeath State: California\n\nDeath City: Santa Monica\n\nDeath Country: United States\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION"}, {"url": "https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/pickford-1892-1979/", "page_content": "Mary Pickford was the most popular woman of her day. She was \"America's Sweetheart,\" and millions of fans around the world called her \"our Mary.\" Her rise to unprecedented global fame coincided with the rise of popular cinema, and during those early years of film, Mary Pickford was its most adored and dynamic star.\n\nCourtesy: Edward Wagenknecht\n\nHard Times\n\nMary Pickford, \"the Girl with the Golden Curls,\" was born Gladys Louise Smith in 1892, in Toronto, Canada. She was the eldest of three children born to John Charles and Charlotte Smith. Her father had a hard time holding a job and the family's financial circumstances were, at best, uncertain. Though it was not something the family admitted, it appears that John suffered from alcoholism. When Gladys was just three and her siblings still infants, their father moved out. Three years later, in 1898, he died of a cerebral hemorrhage. Pickford would later write, \"I can close my eyes and still hear that scream of Mother's at the moment Father passed on.\" His widow and three children were left with nothing.\n\nStage Debut\n\nThat same year, anxious to help support the family, Gladys made her theatrical debut. She played the role of a fatherless child in a typical melodrama of the day, The Silver King. Right from the start she possessed something indefinable that attracted the audience: star quality. She and her mother, Charlotte, built on this success to win more jobs and began a life on the road in touring shows. At age 15, Gladys went to New York to break into Broadway.\n\nThe Great White Way\n\nGladys had set her mind on working for a famous producer, David Belasco, one of the great theater impresarios of the day. She spent weeks waiting outside his office for an interview. One day, facing yet another refusal, Gladys became strident. Hearing the outburst, an associate of Belasco opened his door. Gladys marched in the office and declared, \"My life depends on seeing Mr. Belasco!\" Her tenacity -- and, no doubt, her beauty -- won her an audition.\n\nBecoming Mary Pickford\n\nBelasco offered Gladys a part in a production called The Warrens of Virginia. He recommended she adopt a new, more star-like name, and Mary Pickford was born out of a surname from her mother's family and a lie about her middle name: hating the name Louise, she told Belasco her middle name was Marie, then adapted it to Mary.\n\nAt a Crossroads\n\nIn 1909, after Mary had performed for a year in A Good Little Devil, the show folded. Pickford was nearly 17, an awkward age in her profession: she was too old to play a little girl, but too young to take on the role of leading lady. She wished to continue working for Belasco, but there were no prospects for future roles. Pickford grew anxious and turned, on her mother's advice, to the very last resort for actors of the day: the movies. She hoped the shift would be temporary, and that she would soon be back on Broadway.\n\nTough Negotiator\n\nReluctantly looking for work in film, Pickford again went to the top -- to the well-known director D.W. Griffith and his New York film company, Biograph. She had a disconcerting screen test, and an awkward encounter with Griffith, but he was attracted by her beauty, by her tumbling blonde curls, and by the \"intelligence which shone in her eyes.\" He offered her five dollars a day, three days a week. She challenged his proposal, demanding ten dollars a day (nearly $200 in 2003 dollars) and more for extra work. He accepted.\n\nThe Biograph Girl\n\nThe actress was as innovative as her director, and together the two experimented with new methods of filmmaking. Pickford quickly understood that a new style of acting was required for the movies. She toned down her performances to make them more intimate; she expressed emotion through her eyes, not with grandiose gestures. Audiences responded to Pickford's performances and began to identify her as the \"Biograph girl.\"\n\nWell Paid\n\nWith her mother's encouragement, Pickford moved from one company to another, always negotiating higher salaries. Finally, in 1913, she made a deal with Adolph Zukor, joining his Famous Players Film Company for the grand salary of $500 a week (over $9000 in 2003 dollars).\n\nFame\n\nIn her fifth film for Famous Players, Tess of the Storm Country (1914), Pickford played a poor but heroic young woman, Tess, who makes the noble decision to care for a baby born to an unwed mother. Her performance vaulted her to extraordinary heights of stardom. To the astonishment of Mary and Charlotte, her popularity kept growing as Cinderella (1914), Rags (1915), and Madame Butterfly (1915) followed. The journalist Adela Rogers St. John would later describe Pickford as \"the woman who was known to more people and loved by more people than any other woman that has been in all history.\" Her career at the top would also last longer than almost anyone in Hollywood history -- for more than a decade, until 1927, her box office numbers would hit all-time highs.\n\nBad Marriage\n\nWhile Pickford was soaring to the top, her personal life was in tatters. When she first started working at Biograph she had fallen in love with a handsome actor, Owen Moore. They were married in 1911. Pickford knew that Charlotte did not approve of Moore from the beginning, so initially she concealed her marriage from her mother, and her public. Soon Moore's temper and alcoholism surfaced, and as Pickford's career took off, her marriage fell apart.\n\nTwo Stars Meet\n\nIt was during this tumultuous period that Pickford met and fell in love with the dazzling, handsome film actor Douglas Fairbanks. Fairbanks was the polar opposite of Owen Moore: he was full of energy and optimism, had a charismatic personality, was a brilliant and ambitious actor, and did not drink. But they were both married and feared catastrophic consequences for their careers if they divorced. They appeared before huge crowds together on tours promoting war bonds for World War I, but they always managed to hide their relationship from the public.\n\nThe King and Queen\n\nFinally, Pickford and Fairbanks decided to risk everything: they divorced their spouses and were married privately in 1920. The public received them with open arms. It seemed like the perfect match: the union of America's most popular stars. For millions of adoring fans, they seemed to be royalty, living out a fairytale romance in a lavish Hollywood estate dubbed \"Pickfair.\"\n\nUnited Artists\n\nThe couple made headlines again when they joined with Charlie Chaplin and D.W. Griffith to establish United Artists in 1919. Never before had filmmakers taken so much control over the business side of their productions. The company was created to distribute the founders' films, eliminating the distributors' stranglehold on profits. \"The satisfaction was, in one word, freedom. It's a heady wine, and having tasted it, you find it impossible to go back to working for someone else,\" Pickford would admit.\n\nSuccess\n\nCapturing a bigger piece of the pie might have been sweet, but in the years to follow, the financial demands of United Artists would pressure Pickford to limit herself artistically, playing roles she knew her fans would love. In 1920, Pickford played Pollyanna. The movie grossed an impressive $1.1 million (more than $10 million today) and further solidified the little girl persona Pickford's fans loved. Over the next decade her characters would grow older, and her roles more demanding. The films she did for United Artists in the Twenties were enormously successful, as the nation emerged from World War I, women won the right to vote, and Americans shed Victorian morals in the modern, urbanizing Jazz Age.\n\nFlapper Haircut\n\nIn 1928, Pickford's mother died of breast cancer. In her grief, Pickford cut off her famous curls -- and was lambasted by her fans. \"You would have thought I had murdered someone, and perhaps I had, but only to give her successor a chance to live,\" Pickford would reflect. But she knew she could not continue to play teenagers; her age was beginning to make those roles less credible.\n\nEnd of an Era\n\nIn addition, the silent era was coming to a close. Pickford was the first major star to attempt a \"talkie\" -- a movie with synchronous sound -- but the results were disappointing. The technology was still cumbersome and she faced challenges at the box office from glamorous new stars like Marlene Dietrich and Mae West.\n\nBetrayal\n\nAt the same time, her husband was straying. Fairbanks's own movie career was slowly sinking as well, and he had become interested in a British socialite, Lady Sylvia Ashley. Pickford was wounded and betrayed. When the film that would be her last, Secrets(1933), lost money at the box office, she sensed her career was over. \"I've worked all my life,\" she said. \"Work has become my life. I can think of nothing to fill the void.\"\n\nTwilight\n\nIn 1936, Pickford divorced Fairbanks, and a year later she married her co-star from My Best Girl (1927), a younger man named Charles \"Buddy\" Rogers. Pickford's feelings for Fairbanks were still strong, but Rogers had proved to be a loyal and devoted companion. The couple adopted two children when Pickford was 51. Professionally, Pickford tried her hand at radio, wrote for magazines, and engaged in philanthropic pursuits, none of which were particularly successful. Her fall from fame left her unfocused and adrift. Pickford turned to drinking.\n\nAn American Legend\n\nPickford's last years were spent at Pickfair, in seclusion. In 1976, over four decades after Pickford's last performance, the Academy presented her with a lifetime achievement award. She was too frail to attend the ceremony, so a crew came out to Pickfair and taped the presentation. Audiences were stunned, even offended, to see how much she had aged. She died three years later, at the age of 87.\n\nLegacy of a Superstar\n\nPickford was the world's first international superstar. Her performances could be seen and admired anywhere, thanks to a new, portable, mechanically reproduceable art form. Pickford was the first to experience the glamour and excitement of enormous and extravagant fame \u2014 and the first to pay the price for its loss. In 1915, statisticians calculated that she was seen globally by 12 million people every day. At the height of her success, she was the richest woman in America \u2014 and she enjoyed a long career in front of the camera. By the late 1930s, her star had waned. Still, Pickford's contributions to the development of film \u2014 the major artistic invention of the twentieth century \u2014 make her one of the most important cultural figures in American history."}, {"url": "https://marypickford.org/caris-articles/mary-and-doug-marry/", "page_content": "Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks were married on Sunday evening, March 28, 1920 and when the world learned of it three days later, the news was greeted with joy. On the front page, above the fold, the Los Angeles Times declared that the \u201cfamous film romance is crowned by nuptials,\u201d almost as if the union had been expected for some time and had finally come to fruition.\n\nWhile movie fans were celebrating Hollywood\u2019s new royal couple, Mary herself was breathing a huge sigh of relief. For almost two years, she had been agonizing as she lived a bifurcated life \u2013 making her films as she publicly pretended to be happily married to one man while privately in love with another.\n\nMary and Doug first met at a party in Tarrytown, New York, in November of 1915, both accompanied by their spouses. As their hostess, vaudeville star Elsie Janis put it after she and Doug and Mary took a long walk around her property, \u201cMr. Fairbanks and Miss Pickford had become Douglas and Mary by the time we dragged our weary bodies home.\u201d\n\nBy early 1917, Doug and Mary had privately declared their love for each other and within months, they had worked out a variety of ruses to see each other, often enlisting trusted friends as beards. Charlie Chaplin was pulled in to be present when photos were taken at the studio, but more intricate plans were laid for their assignations. For instance, Doug and his screenwriter, Anita Loos, would head out on a horseback ride while Mary and her friend and screenwriter Frances Marion made a public point of going to a different stable and then \u2013 as prearranged \u2013 secretly met up with Doug and Anita. Doug and Mary went off, usually to his brother\u2019s house in the Hollywood hills, and Frances and Anita rode together for an hour or two until they reunited with the couple.\n\nAt first, Frances was pleased to see Mary so content and had to admit there were benefits to the affair; Mary was more cheerful than ever and while she had always thought of Mary as pretty, when \u201cshe was with Doug, she actually looked sexy.\u201d\n\nMary\u2019s mother knew about the affair and tacitly approved. As Frances said later in life, \u201d \u2018Mama\u2019 loved Mary to be happy and Mary was never lovelier than when she was with Doug. That was enough for Mama \u2013 if only they both weren\u2019t married to somebody else.\u201d\n\nAs enamored as they were of each other, neither Doug nor Mary were anxious to make any drastic moves. Their stardom was too important to them and it was assumed that fans wanted to put their favorite actors on a pedestal and live vicariously through them. At least that\u2019s what studio chiefs wanted their players to believe to keep them in line. The fact was that when it came to stars divorcing and remarrying, there was no path to follow.\n\nDoug and Mary might have been able to keep their relationship secret but a series of events \u2013 both international and domestic \u2013 intervened. First, the government reached out to them, along with Charlie Chaplin and Marie Dressler, to go on a nationwide tour to sell war bonds. Both Mary\u2019s mother and Frances urged Mary not to go, but when she insisted, Charlotte went along and was rarely out of camera range. Enough fans and reporters noticed the way Mary and Doug looked at each other that questions were raised, but they kept repeating that they were just friends. The tour affirmed their popularity more than they could have imagined and that gave Doug the confidence he needed to divorce his wife Beth. She had been Doug\u2019s manager and financial advisor, but now he turned to his brother Robert and Mary\u2019s attorney Cap O\u2019Brien for guidance. For $500,000 cash and full custody of their young son, Doug Jr., Beth filed for divorce in the fall of 1918 without naming a co-respondent.\n\nTwo months after the war was over, Mary and Doug joined Griffith and Chaplin in announcing the formation of United Artists. More meaningful looks, more questions raised about their relationship. When Beth married an old flame, Jim Evans, and Doug\u2019s box office saw no negative effect, he began, according to one of his biographers, \u201cwheedling, begging and threatening\u201d Mary to divorce Owen. .\n\nAs Doug\u2019s son later explained, \u201cDad wanted all of Mary \u2013 herself and her talent and her fame and her exclusive devotion. And he longed to be able to display their union to the world like a double trophy.\u201d\n\nMary was petrified of making a mistake of such a magnitude that it could wipe out everything she had worked for. She turned to Frances and together they decided they were too close to the situation. If anyone from the outside could be trusted to give an honest assessment, it was Frances\u2019s good friend, the writer Adela Rogers St. Johns. As difficult as it was for Mary to let anyone into her private circle, she agreed to invite Adela for tea. Like everyone else who went to the movies, Adela felt she already knew Mary, but the first thing that struck her as Mary introduced herself was that she had never before heard her voice. Adela was enchanted and, for once in her life, more than a bit in awe. As the three of them sat in Mary\u2019s living room, Frances explained they needed her thoughts as a reporter, a fan of moving pictures and someone with a sense of public opinion. And someone they could trust to keep a secret.\n\nAdela knew that Mary and Owen\u2019s marriage had been in name only for years, yet still she was surprised with Mary\u2019s bluntness. \u201cIf I get a divorce and marry Douglas, will anyone ever go see my pictures again?\u201d Mary asked, \u201cDo you think they will forgive me?\u201d Then Mary added something that would always echo in Adela\u2019s mind as exemplifying how seriously she took her position: \u201cAbove all, there are my people to consider.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy people\u201d meant more than just those who depended upon her. Along with the business acumen that served her so well, Mary had almost an innate understanding of this new phenomenon called stardom; the public\u2019s sense of ownership of the personalities they took into their hearts.\n\nAdela hedged her advice. \u201cI think your chances are better than even if it\u2019s handled carefully\u2026 All the world loves a lover.\u201d Overall, she was encouraging, and Mary thanked her for coming, and excused herself. As soon as they were alone, Frances explained how complicated things had become for Mary. In addition to everything else, her adored brother Jack didn\u2019t approve of Doug; he thought he was a charlatan trying to buy his own importance through his association with Mary. Frances and Adela both found Jack charming, yet also knew that was exactly how many saw his relationship with his sister. If Mary lost her stardom, she would be fine \u2013 she had enough money to live and support her family comfortably. But there was another nagging question \u2014 would Doug still love her if she was no longer a star?\n\nFrances left for New York as soon as Pollyanna, Mary\u2019s first UA film, finished shooting. Frances\u2019s fianc\u00e9 Fred Thomson, the Army chaplain Mary had introduced her to on the set of Johanna Enlists, was finally coming home from the European War. And on November 1, 1919, the day before their Manhattan wedding, Mary arrived to be matron of honor. As usual, Charlotte was there as well. When they were alone, Mary told Frances she had finally made up her mind \u2013 she was willing to risk losing the title of \u201cAmerica\u2019s sweetheart\u201d because \u201cI only want to be one man\u2019s sweetheart.\u201d\n\nOnce the decision was made, Charlotte and their attorney Cap O\u2019Brien started making the necessary arrangements. First, a deal was made with Owen to buy his cooperation for $100,000. He even helped speed up the process by conveniently arriving in Minden, Nevada with his attorney after Mary and Charlotte had been in the state for only a few days. Publicly claiming he was scouting film locations, Owen\u2019s presence allowed him to be served with papers so Mary could go to court the next day.\n\nShe arrived dressed in black with a veil, almost as if she was in mourning for the marriage. The newspapers reported her as being prostrate between sobs, explaining how she had been deserted by a drunkard who berated her at every turn. She was portrayed as a woman who had suffered beyond any normal standards of endurance. She had been felled by the flu at several points over the past year and now she said she was the brink of a physical breakdown. That was, after all, why she was in Nevada \u2013 to seek refuge and regain her health. Nevada\u2019s divorce laws were already liberal, but they required a several month residency so Mary\u2019s words were carefully gauged.\n\n\u201cDo I understand you came into the state in good faith, seeking health and nothing else?\u201d asked the judge.\n\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you have given up Los Angeles as your residence and your permanent residence is Genoa, Douglas County, Nevada?\u201d\n\n\u201cUntil I have regained my health, this will be my home.\u201d\n\nWell, there was obviously a miraculous recovery, because as soon as the decree was granted, Mary and Charlotte, making no public statements, boarded a train to Los Angeles that very evening. When she and her mother arrived home on the morning of March 5, they were surrounded by reporters. Realizing that the rumors would just keep churning until Mary made a statement, they invited a reporter from the Los Angeles Times to their home that evening. The main message was that Mary had no plans for the future except to \u201cdevote her life to producing films to gladden the hearts of her admirers.\u201d But she was quoted as saying other things as well \u2013 the divorce been \u201cunpremeditated,\u201d the rumors she would marry Doug or anyone else were \u201cabsurd,\u201d there had been no financial settlement with Owen and she was planning on returning often to Nevada.\n\nMary had told Frances she wanted to wait a year until she married Doug, but that resolve crumbled as he gave Mary an ultimatum; marry him now or he was leaving her. They had been in love for two years and he was not waiting any longer. And she was tired of resisting.\n\nDoug had recently completed renovation of his isolated \u201chunting lodge\u201d in Beverly Hills and he was already getting in the habit of inviting a variety of people to dinner. However, two of the guests on Friday, March 26 were unusual: the Baptist minister J. Whitcomb Brougher and a certain Mr. Sparks, a local marriage license clerk. Sparks had never been invited to dine with Fairbanks before and knew enough to bring all the proper paperwork with him, but Mary refused to be married on a Friday night. Besides, she was dressed in black and she wanted to wed on a Sunday. And so, 48 hours later, they arrived at Brougher\u2019s home on 4th Street in Los Angeles, along with Charlotte, the actress Marjorie Daw, Doug\u2019s brother Robert and his wife Lorie. Mary wore a lovely white toile gown trimmed in green, and her present to Doug was a portrait of her in her wedding dress. Doug\u2019s present to Mary was the Beverly Hills home he was so proud of, soon to be dubbed Pickfair.\n\nAdela had been right about the world loving lovers; The news was heralded on the front page of newspapers across the country as the closest thing to a formal coronation of the reigning king and queen of movies.1\n\nIn retrospect, all of the angst and lost sleep Mary had suffered over her decision seemed unnecessary and the pictures of both of them after the wedding reveal how truly happy they were. In the end, it was the fans who clamored to see Doug and Mary on their honeymoon in New York and Europe who put an end to any doubts they had about their careers. The Attorney General of Nevada would soon go to court with questions about the propriety of Mary\u2019s divorce, but that\u2019s a story for another day.\n\nSources\n\n1.

After her father was killed in an accident, Gladys became the family\u2019s main breadwinner by performing in the theatre. She was seven years old. In fact, the stage became a family venture, as her younger siblings Lottie and Jack and even her mother took up the trade. But the drive and determination to be a star belonged solely to Gladys. In 1907, her ambition would take her to Broadway and famed producer-director David Belasco, who changed her name to Mary Pickford and gave her a part in \u201cThe Warrens of Virginia.\u201d In 1909, when Pickford was between stage engagements, she approached director D. W. Griffith at the Biograph Company in New York and asked for work in moving pictures. She had no intention of working permanently in the new medium, but hoped the income would tide her over before she went back to Belasco and the stage. Pickford was intrigued with film acting, and before long she began to enjoy \u201cposing\u201d for motion pictures. She stayed with the Biograph Company, working as both an actress and writer from 1909 to 1911, leaving for a brief stint with the Independent Motion Picture Company (IMP), and later with Majestic Pictures Corporation. She returned to Griffith at Biograph in early 1912, finishing out the year with him. In 1913, after a run on Broadway in \u201cA Good Little Devil,\u201d Pickford made a definitive break from the stage by signing a motion picture contract with Adolph Zukor and the Famous Players Film Company. The year 1913 marked the dawn of the feature motion picture, and Pickford was about to become its biggest star. In fact, she came to feature films with a well-established legacy. In 1911, \u201cMoving Picture Mary\u201d was the first movie star to adorn the cover of the New York Dramatic Mirror, an honor previously bestowed only on theatrical stars. And because moviegoers had already singled Pickford out as a favorite, her success in features was guaranteed. In 1914, Pickford\u2019s Tess of the Storm Country, the story of a fiery young woman fighting for the underclass, caused a sensation. The extraordinary reaction made Pickford an international star and created fan worship that had never before been witnessed. In turn, this success gave Mary Pickford incredible bargaining power. In 1916, Pickford had negotiated a contract that gave her a $10,000 a week salary, 50% of her film profits, and her own production company. Pickford would sign off on every aspect of her productions, from the script to the director. She was even known to have had a hand in editing. During these years she worked with directors Maurice Tourneur and Marshall Neilan, the writer Frances Marion, and made some of the best features of her career, including Poor Little Rich Girl (1917), Stella Maris (1918), and The Hoodlum (1919). Pickford is often remembered for her portrayals of children in films including Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1917) and Daddy-Long-Legs (1919). The stories were adapted from popular novels and had been performed on stage with an adult actress (Edith Taliaferro and Ruth Chatterton) playing the role of a young girl. Pickford\u2019s petite size and youthful beauty made her ideal for these parts, but it was her acting talent that seared these roles into the public consciousness. Her portrait of childhood captured both the simplicity and complexity of a young person\u2019s inner world, and also its physicality, through body language and mannerism. In 1919, when she was only twenty-seven years old, Pickford cofounded United Artists, the first independent film distribution company, along with Charlie Chaplin, D. W. Griffith, and her future husband Douglas Fairbanks. Then in 1920 she and Fairbanks were wed in a private ceremony, but they shared their married life with the world. At first, the couple had feared a negative reaction (both were already married when they met), but their union only fed into the romantic fantasies many fans had about Hollywood. The couple was mobbed at every port on their whirlwind European honeymoon. Back in California, they relished their place as the King and Queen of Hollywood, holding court at their home, known as Pickfair. Pickford decided to make only one film a year after 1921, focusing on the quality of her productions. Many believe that she was at her creative peak during the teens, but her films of the 1920s were the most successful. Favorite titles from this decade include a remake of Tess of the Storm Country (1922), Rosita (1923), and Sparrows (1926). Her last silent film, My Best Girl (1927), would be one of the greatest of the era. The decade\u2019s last year brought about major changes in the industry and for Mary Pickford. By 1929, the Talkies had all but obliterated silent film. Pickford knew she could not resist the change. She cut her old-fashioned curls and made two Talkies before the decade ended. Coquette (1929) won her an Oscar for best actress, and Taming of the Shrew (1929) featured the much-anticipated pairing of Pickford and Fairbanks. But even with good reviews and promotion, these films were not as successful as her silent pictures. She attempted two more sound features, then retired in 1933 after twenty-three years of making movies. And though she kept on producing films after retiring, the experience was not as rich as running her own career had been. Pickford, whose professional decline had begun in the same year as the death of her beloved mother, Gladys, in 1928, saw her brother and sister die in the 1930s. In 1936, her fairytale marriage to Fairbanks ended in divorce. Fairbanks died of heart failure only three years later. In 1937, Pickford married actor Charles \u201cBuddy\u201d Rogers, her costar in My Best Girl. The marriage lasted until Mary Pickford\u2019s death in 1979.

Its 83-year-old recipient was too ill to accept the award in person and had chosen instead to address the gathering via closed circuit television from her home. The surprise, even shock, was almost audible when the image of an emaciated, pale old woman wearing an ill-fitting wig flickered on the screen, speaking in a voice barely above a whisper. It was difficult to believe that she had at one time been \"America's Sweetheart\" and the film industry's first female studio executive.\n\nMary Pickford's career mirrored the explosive growth of \"the flickers\" during the first 30 years of the century. There was no film industry at all when she was born on April 8, 1893, in Toronto, Canada; and the screen name by which she would be known to millions lay some years in the future. John and Charlotte Smith named their first child Gladys Louise, born shortly after they moved into a working-class neighborhood of Toronto where John had found a job as a printer. Charlotte took in sewing to help support the family. By 1897, Pickford's sister Charlotte and brother Jack, Jr., had arrived. John had managed to save enough from his printing job by then to buy and run his own concession stand on a Lake Ontario ferryboat. One winter's day, late for supper and impatiently waiting for the boat to dock, John tried to jump the last few feet ashore, striking his head on a dangling pulley. He died only hours later of a fractured skull. Pickford was six, Lottie just three, and little Jack barely one year old.\n\nFor the next year, Charlotte and her three children struggled to survive, often depending on food given to them by neighbors. Pickford looked after the younger ones and kept house, while Charlotte tried to earn as much as she could from her sewing. Even when she began letting out rooms in the house to boarders, it was impossible to make ends meet. One of these boarders, a stage manager at a Toronto theater, suggested that she put the young ones to work on the stage, where there was always a demand for children as extras. By September 1898, Pickford had made her stage debut at Toronto's Princess Theater, playing both a girl and a boy in a long-forgotten melodrama, The Silver King. Later, when the same play was presented by another stock company, Charlotte astutely brought Pickford to an audition for the same two parts. She was promptly hired.\n\nPickford loved the theater from the first\u2014the smells, the excitement, the audience's laughter and applause. For her, she said many years later, it was \"an electric impulse, a definite vibration, a palpable bond.\" It was fortunate she took to the theater so naturally, for it rescued her family from destitution. Charlotte protected her children from the less desirable elements of the business and made life as normal for them as possible. \"It was through my mother that I first learned what the term love really means,\" a very grownup Mary Pickford once recalled. \"She diffused love in all directions, as a flower diffused perfume.\"\n\nFor nine years after her first appearance on a stage, Pickford trouped through Eastern Canada, the American Midwest, and the East in a long series of touring productions, many of them written and produced by entrepreneur Harold Reid. Reid took the entire Smith clan under his wing, often casting Charlotte in maid's roles and the two younger children as extras. But it was Pickford as \"Baby Gladys\" that audiences began to remember, especially in sentimental Reid productions like The Little Red Schoolhouse and Ellen Price Wood 's East Lynne. By 1901, the program for a production of East Lynne announced that \"the souvenirs tonight will be of Gladys Smith, the little tot whose work has been so much admired.\"\n\nAlthough the family sometimes had to break up to follow different tour routes, they would usually be reunited for the off-season summers in New York, where many of the circuits ended. At the end of the 1907 season, after 10 years on the road, 15-year-old Pickford wanted a permanent home and all that went with one. \"When I saw the things that other girls had,\" she remembered, \"I determined to have them. I'd have a fur coat one day, and it would be warmer because I had known what it was like to have insufficient wraps.\" While Charlotte took the younger children back to Toronto, Pickford stayed with friends in New York, intent on becoming a famous actress. That meant Broadway; and to many starry-eyed actresses in 1907, Broadway meant David Belasco.\n\nBelasco was one of the last Gilded Age theatrical managers and producers, known for lavish melodramatic productions like The Return of Peter Grimm and Tiger Rose, both of which would eventually be adapted by the upstart film industry. Belasco's style was perfectly suited to Pickford's experience from her road tours, but it took several months of letter-writing and fruitless visits to Belasco's office before the great man agreed to see her. He later admitted to being impressed at the determination shown by the blonde, curly-haired 15-year-old who, when he opened their interview with the rhetorical \"So you want to become an actress?,\" promptly and proudly answered \"I am an actress! I want to become a good one.\" It was Belasco who came up with a more memorable stage name by asking Gladys Smith to recite the names of her family members, stopping her when she mentioned her maternal grandmother, Elizabeth Denny Pickford . When Pickford also mentioned she'd always liked the name Marie, Mary Pickford was born. Mary hastily wired to Charlotte in Toronto: \"Gladys Smith now Mary Pickford. Engaged by David Belasco to appear on Broadway this fall.\"\n\nI have never been a happy woman. It is not my nature. \u2014Mary Pickford\n\nThe play was William De Mille's The Warrens of Virginia. Belasco was apparently satisfied with her work, especially noting that Pickford was the first to arrive and the last to leave rehearsals, even on days when her scenes were not on the schedule. \"She would read and re-read her lines to find out which was the best way to speak them,\" he later remembered. \"She was a very creative and highly intelligent little body.\" His only advice to her was to \"always keep it natural.\" Since she was required at 15 to play a girl of 8, Pickford chose as her model Maude Adams , who as a grown woman was famous for her portrayal of the youthful Peter Pan. Mary learned from Adams that \"the facial muscles of the grownup are controlled, while those of a child only reflect passing moods,\" and that children hardly ever wrinkle their brows, even when surprised or afraid. It was observations like these that would serve her well under the more demanding eye of the camera. The Warrens of Virginia ran for two seasons\u2014the first on Broadway during the winter of 1907\u201308, and the second on tour starting the following May. Pickford was paid $25 a week on Broadway, and given a $5-a-week raise for the road tour.\n\nAfter the show closed, however, her career as \"a Belasco girl\" seemed to stall, there being no parts for her in any of Belasco's upcoming productions. Charlotte dreaded the thought of going back on the road, with its possibility of splitting up the family yet again, and suggested to Mary that a temporary source of income might be found down on 14th Street, where the American Mutascope and Biograph Company had just turned an old brownstone into a studio for producing moving picture shows. On a winter's day late in 1908, Pickford took the trolley downtown and met the man who would do more for her career than David Belasco ever could.\n\nDavid Wark Griffith was a former actor who would transform what had been a novelty at peep shows and vaudeville halls into a powerful new method of storytelling. Although Biograph was just one of a handful of new companies hastily organized to take advantage of what was thought to be merely a fad, D.W. Griffith was among the first to see its real potential. By the time Mary arrived in the third-floor ballroom that was his makeshift studio, Griffith had been churning out one-reelers for more than a year. Even at this embryonic stage of her film career, Pickford showed a remarkable business sense by demanding, as \"a Belasco actress,\" double the usual $5-a-day salary and a $25-a-week minimum. Griffith agreed. On April 20, 1909, Mary Pickford stepped before the camera for the first time in a one-reel comedy called Her First Biscuits.\n\nThe work was not much to her liking, particularly the lack of rehearsal time and the demands placed on her to produce an emotion in less than ten feet of hand-cranked film. But it was steady work, from nine in the morning to eight at night, six days a week; and she could add to her income by following the example of many others in Griffith's troupe and writing scenarios\u2014$25 for a one-reel story and $50 for a two-reeler. During her first six months with Biograph, she was able to save $1,200\u2014more money than she had ever had at one time in all her years of trouping on the stage. Over time, she grew to appreciate Griffith's genius for intuitive directing. \"We just listened to his voice to get his feeling,\" she remembered. \"[He] devised ways and means of bringing actors out of themselves.\" Even the informal atmosphere of the studio began to appeal to her, especially the attentions of a fellow actor, Owen Moore, much to Charlotte's disapproval. Within three months, the New York Dramatic\n\nMirror specifically mentioned \"an ingenue whose work in Biograph pictures is attracting attention\" in its review of They Would Elope. The anonymity was standard at the time, the film companies fearing that name recognition would inspire their actors to ask for more money. Even fan mail was torn up before it could reach them. Mary was known to the public only as \"Little Mary\" or \"The Girl with the Golden Hair.\" During the summer of 1909, Florence Lawrence (\"The Biograph Girl,\" as the public knew her) was wooed away by another company. Griffith promptly made Mary the new Biograph Girl and the company's leading lady.\n\nIn less than a year, Pickford had appeared in 45 Biograph shorts and could count herself among the first group of motion picture idols, along with Mabel Normand , Harry Carey, and Blanche Sweet . One trade newspaper was sure that the success of Biograph's A Romance of the Western Hills \"is in great measure due to this actress, and this is a particularly fine example of her art.\" But Pickford was shrewd enough to realize that her success lay in playing young girls and innocent sweethearts and that she would never be a great dramatic actress. Typically, she accepted her position and made the most of it. \"I decided \u2026 to be a semiprecious stone,\" she said, \"rather than a paste imitation of something more glittering and gorgeous.\"\n\nIn January 1910, Pickford made her first trip with Griffith's troupe to California for two months of work in what was then still a semi-rural backwater not yet called Hollywood. The \"studio lot\" was just that\u2014a vacant lot at the corner of Grand Avenue and Washington Boulevard in what is now the Culver City section of Los Angeles. The entire cast and crew lived in a boarding house nearby. Owen Moore came west with the troupe after being warned by Griffith, who had caught them necking behind some scenery, to treat Mary gently. A year later, back in New York, she and Moore were married secretly to avoid Charlotte's anger, the two of them continuing to live apart until Pickford finally broke down and confessed. Charlotte and Biograph hid the marriage from the public, fearing it would stain Mary's screen persona as the innocent young virgin. There were also rumors that Pickford had suffered a botched abortion which had left her unable to bear children.\n\nWhen Owen resigned from Biograph to join Carl Laemmle's Independent Motion Picture Company (IMP), Mary went with him. (\"Little Mary's an IMP now!\" crowed Laemmle in his advertising.) Pickford's reasons for leaving Griffith were more than romantic, however. Laemmle offered her $175 a week, which Moore jealously noted was more than his own salary. Several months later, Mary broke her contract with IMP, on grounds that she had been a minor when she signed it, and transferred her talents to Majestic Films, this time at an impressive $225 a week. But after only five films, shot in a drafty studio during a particularly cold Chicago winter, Pickford made amends and returned to Biograph in 1911, by which time her asking price had increased several fold. During her absence from Biograph, however, Griffith had discovered Lillian Gish . In 1912, while she was shooting her last film for Biograph, The New York Hat, Pickford cabled David Belasco that she wanted to return to the stage. \"I've been hiding in the pictures,\" she told him.\n\nBelasco immediately cast her as the poor blind girl in his 1913 production of Rostand's The Good Little Devil, which was seen by a former fur seller from Chicago who had the idea of creating a film company that would bring famous plays starring famous stage actors to movie audiences. Adolph Zukor called his company Famous Players. His first production was The Good Little Devil, with Pickford reprising her stage role to such effect that Zukor signed her to a contract for three pictures over fourteen weeks at a salary of $500 per week. For Zukor, Pickford appeared in The Bishop's Carriage, Caprice, and Uncle Tom's Cabin. By 1914, Zukor had signed her to a full year's contract, at $1,000 a week, and Pickford had announced her formal retirement from the stage. \"I'm in the movies for money,\" she bluntly told Photoplay. \"In \u2026 three years and eight months [in motion picture work], I was laid off only four weeks.\" That same year, she starred in what everyone agreed was her finest picture to date, Tess of the Storm Country, although privately Mary disliked the movie. In one-sheets promoting Tess, Famous Players billed her by name as \"American's foremost film actress.\"\n\nOver the next six years, Pickford starred in some of the most famous silents of the early cinema, such as Poor Little Rich Girl, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, Suds, and The Little American. Along the way, Zukor merged his company with Jesse Lasky's Feature Play Company to form Famous Players Lasky, while Pickford's salary went from Zukor's initial $500 per week in 1914 to an astounding $10,000 per week in 1916. The two-year contract she signed that year was a model of shrewd negotiating based on her new-found star power, for it included clauses giving her 50% of the net receipts of each of her films, with a guaranteed minimum of $1 million, and complete creative control over her productions, from writers to directors to casting. The studio was legally obligated to provide her with a secretary and a press agent, along with \"parlour class accommodation\" on her frequent cross-country train trips between New York and Los Angeles. Like the film industry itself, Mary Pickford was growing up.\n\nOther actors were building star careers, too. Among them was Douglas Fairbanks, the dashing hero of such action films as The Three Musketeers and The Thief of Baghdad. Pickford and Fairbanks, who was also married, met frequently at social functions and premieres starting in 1914. By 1916, the two had become lovers, often meeting in secret at a house owned by Fairbanks' brother in the Hollywood Hills. But word was bound to leak out. Charlotte, who had tried to prevent Mary's marriage to Owen Moore, was now equally horrified at the possibility of a very public divorce; Moore himself, his career long eclipsed by that of his wife, began drinking to excess. In 1918, with the affair filling the newspapers, Fairbanks' wife Beth named Mary in public as her husband's paramour and demanded she step forward and admit it. Pickford called a conference with two friends, scriptwriter Frances Marion and journalist Adela Rogers St. Johns , to decide if her career could survive the scandal. Both of them assured her it would, for Mary's public was as much in love with her, they pointed out, as she was with Fairbanks. \"More than anything else I had wanted desperately to be approved of,\" Pickford wrote many years later, \"and that approval Douglas gave me. I had never believed anybody would speak of me, and to me, as he did.\" In 1919, Pickford began divorce proceedings in Nevada against Owen Moore, giving him $100,000 to hasten the proceedings; while Fair-banks gently persuaded his wife Beth to take similar action against him, citing \"an unknown woman\" as the cause of the separation. On March 28, 1920, little more than two weeks after her divorce from Moore became final, Pickford married Fairbanks at a private ceremony in Fairbanks' Hollywood home. As a wedding present, Fairbanks bought a rambling, rustic hunters' lodge in Benedict Canyon and remodeled it into a 22-room Tudor mansion he and Mary dubbed \"Pickfair,\" which became a social center for much of Hollywood's artistic elite for the next two decades.\n\nTo add to the turmoil of this period, Pick-ford's long-standing argument with Zukor over \"block-booking\" of her films reached a critical point. It was Zukor's practice to lure theaters into booking a package of less successful films by using a Mary Pickford picture as bait; without taking the whole package, theaters couldn't have Pickford's film\u2014a practice Mary, and others in similar situations at other studios, felt cheapened the value of their work. In 1918, she refused to renew her contract with Zukor and signed instead with First National Pictures, at a salary of $750,000. In return for the lower salary, First National agreed to book her films separately from any others and, more important, gave Pickford the right to set up her own film company\u2014The Mary Pickford Company\u2014with Mary as its creative head and Charlotte as its business manager. (With her financial acumen, Charlotte had invested most of Mary's earnings safely and wisely, a practice that would see Pickford comfortably through the Depression when other Hollywood stars lost their fortunes.) A year after her signing with First National, however, rumors began spreading that First National and Famous Players would merge to form a virtual monopoly controlling the production and distribution of filmed entertainment. The result of the merger was Paramount Pictures; the answer to it from Pickford and three other key creative Hollywood personalities was United Artists.\n\nThe formidable combination of Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Charlie Chaplin, and Pickford's old friend D.W. Griffith was in the form of an independent distribution company, the stock of which was not released to each partner until the required number of films, produced at each partner's expense, had been delivered. It was a direct challenge to the near total control the studios held over the choice, production, and distribution of an artist's work. \"The satisfaction was in one word: freedom,\" wrote Pickford. \"It's a heady wine, and having tasted it you find it impossible to go back working for someone else.\" She delivered the first of her required three films a year, via her own company, in the form of her 1920 adaptation of Eleanor Porter 's Pollyanna, which grossed well over $1 million worldwide. But there were problems with United Artists from the start. Charlie Chaplin, always meticulous about his films, didn't deliver a movie until 1923's A Woman of Paris, which fared badly at the box office and earned him Pickford's deepening displeasure as the years passed. Griffith, who brought the company some $8 million with his pictures in its first three years, was repeatedly rebuffed in his requests for production advances to complete his films, and left the company in 1924 to sign with Paramount. Efforts to increase United Artists' product by contracting films out to independent producers resulted in a string of financially unsuccessful pictures; and all the partners, including Pickford, repeatedly \"roadshowed\" their own films by renting a theater and opening a picture at their own expense, keeping all the revenue generated for themselves and dulling the market for the picture when it was handed over to UA.\n\nBut Pickford's films released during this period are among her best remembered\u2014especially the adaptation of Frances Hodgson Burnett 's Little Lord Fauntleroy, in which Mary played both the title role and that of the child's mother, and a remake of her earlier Tess of the Storm Country. She stuck to her money-making formula of playing the working-class sweetheart beset by adversity who triumphs in the end, although by 1927's My Best Girl critics were hinting that it might be time for a 35-year-old woman to stop playing 18-year-old girls. As if to emphasize the need for a change, the industry's first talking film, The Jazz Singer, took the country by storm. My Best Girl would prove to be Pickford's last silent picture, as well as her last appearance as a sweet young thing. On June 21, 1928, Pickford walked into a fashionable beauty salon on New York's East 57th Street and walked out two hours later with the short, bobbed, heavily lacquered hair of a Jazz Age flapper. Two months later, she began work on her first \"talkie,\" in her first adult role.\n\nCoquette was little more than a stiffly photographed version of a popular Broadway play of the time, the camera tethered to its new, immobile sound apparatus and separated from the actors by a windowed, soundproof wall. Pickford was convinced the public would never accept the sound of her voice (\"That's not me!\" she protested on hearing herself for the first time. \"It's impossible!\"), and she had gone through two directors and two sound technicians before the picture was released to great acclaim in April 1929. It grossed nearly $1.5 million during its run and earned Pickford the Academy's Best Actress award at its second annual ceremony. But Coquette would prove to be her last successful picture. Her only screen appearance with her husband, in a 1929 film adaptation of The Taming of the Shrew, made only a modest profit, while Pickford herself shut down production on her next effort, Forever Yours, commenting later that it was \"the most stupid thing I ever saw, including me.\" She completed and released the film later under a new title, Secrets, but it still lost $100,000 at the box office.\n\nFairbanks' films were faring no better. Friends noted that he seemed to have lost interest in his screen career and was spending long periods of time away from Pickford, traveling around Europe on the pretense of making a travelogue while carrying on an affair with a former \"chorus girl\" from England. Pickford, too, had indulged in a series of amours, the longest running of which was with actor Buddy Rogers, who had played opposite her in My Best Girl. Rumors that her marriage was in trouble became so widespread that Mary was forced to answer Photoplay's inquiry in 1931 by saying, \"I cannot deny there may be a separation. I can only say there is none now.\" In June 1933, however, Pickford and Fairbanks were, indeed, legally separated. That same year, Mary officially announced her retirement from the screen and, for nearly a year, rarely left the isolation of Pickfair.\n\nShe briefly emerged in 1934 in a stage production of Alice in Wonderland (for which journalist Edmund Wilson claimed she had had a facelift) and in a weekly series of radio dramas which were indifferently received, as was a chat show replacement, \"Party at Pickfair.\" Two spiritually inclined books, Why Not Try God and My Rendezvous with Life, along with the novel Demi-Widow\u2014all ghostwritten from Pickford's notes\u2014appeared in 1934 and 1935. But it was the film business that kept beckoning. \"Let no one tell you they don't miss their career,\" she once wrote. \"I miss it terribly. It's a constant ache with me.\" One solution was to form a new film company in partnership with Jesse Lasky, the Pickford Lasky Production Company, which released two unsuccessful pictures through UA in 1935 before being disbanded.\n\nIn June 1937, Pickford announced her third marriage, to Buddy Rogers, who had abandoned his sporadic acting career to form a band. Mary accompanied Buddy and his group on their road tours, and it was during a stop in Chicago that she received the news that Douglas Fairbanks had died. \"My darling is gone,\" she was heard to whisper, for she and Fairbanks had remained close even after their separation. Gone with him was Pickford's most enduring link to the old, heady days of a Hollywood just discovering itself.\n\nFrom now on, the public saw or heard Mary Pickford only in bond drives during the war years or in occasional guest spots on national radio. But Hollywood's business community heard from her often, for she continued to take a direct hand in the increasingly troubled affairs of United Artists. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, with Pickford and Chaplin the only remaining partners, UA slid precariously closer to bankruptcy. Their continuing rift over business practices which had always been mediated by Fairbanks now grew wider. Pickford accused Chaplin of using United Artists as a private banking account for his infrequent films, while Chaplin complained that she was dictatorial and trying to force him out. A series of disastrous deals with outside producers resulted in ruinously expensive lawsuits and no new product. The ill feeling reached its nadir when Pickford allowed herself to be interviewed by the FBI during the McCarthy era, Chaplin being suspected at the time of Communist sympathies and eventually forced to flee the country. He never forgave her.\n\nHalfway through 1949, UA had already hemorrhaged $400 million and was on the brink of bankruptcy. It was saved by a group of investors to whom Pickford signed over control of the company in 1951 and to whom she sold her remaining shares for around $3 million. She took some satisfaction from the fact that Chaplin had done the same, a year earlier, for little more than $1 million. (United Artists survived and even prospered under its new leadership and became part of MGM/UA Enterprises in 1981.) With the last vestige of her most productive period now gone, Pickford lived quietly and in increasing obscurity at Pickfair. Director Billy Wilder considered her for the part of Norma Desmond in his Sunset Boulevard, but after he realized that he could not bear to show \"America's Sweetheart\" as a faded, delusional movie star, the part went to Gloria Swanson .\n\nA lawyer who visited Pickford in the late 1950s described her as \"a lovely person, but sad in some respects. Hollywood had sort of passed her by. She knew it, and didn't like it.\" Her name was kept alive through her generous donations to the Motion Picture Country Home and Hospital for indigent and retired entertainers, and by the announcement that she had given those of her films which survived, some 50 titles from her Biograph and Famous Players days, to the American Film Institute. Most of her remaining films shot on fragile nitrate stock had deteriorated beyond repair.\n\nIn a rare interview given in 1970, Pickford admitted that the film world had changed to such an extent that she knew she could never go back. \"Making movies was fun,\" she said of her early days, \"[but] there is not much fun today when one mistake can be fatal. In the old days, a star was loved through good, bad, and indifferent pictures. Today, three bad pictures and a star is finished.\" She hinted, too, that her memories were too fragile to withstand the brutal business of modern-day film making. \"I think illusions are so important,\" she said. \"That's why I haven't gone back to pictures.\"\n\nMary did not disclose that she had been diagnosed with advanced heart disease and that her strength was leaving her. Even so, on the night her frail image appeared before the Academy Award audience, she rallied sufficiently to request the camera crew to shoot only her left side so that the slight bump on her nose which had vexed lighting directors in the old days would not be apparent.\n\nAmong the last to see her was her stepson, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., who was a frequent visitor to Pickfair after his father's death. \"She would be talking,\" he once reported, \"and I would suddenly realize that she thought I was my father. It was at those times that I realized that she always remained in love with him.\" On May 29, 1979, Mary Pickford died peacefully at a Santa Monica hospital, after lapsing into a coma at home.\n\nAt the Academy tribute held five months after her death, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., reminded the audience that Pickford's great contribution to the industry had been her guardianship of creative rights. \"It was her idea,\" he said, \"that artists who created their own works from the beginning \u2026 should have the rewards due to them.\" But for Pickford, there was something even more precious. She recounted in her autobiography a visit to her native Toronto in 1944 during which she appeared before a group of adoring Air Force cadets about to go off to war. \"It is good to have lived to know that after so many years off the screen,\" she wrote, \"there were young men who could still pay me the sweetest and most gallant compliment of all\u2014to ask me to be called their collective sweetheart.\"\n\nsources:\n\nEyman, Scott.

He proposed to her and they married in 1937. Rogers was a handsome actor and musician. While some critics speculated that he was after Pickford's fame and fortune, his affection for her was widely acknowledged.\n\nCourtesy: Edward Magenknecht\n\nMidwestern Boy\n\nBorn in 1904, Charles \"Buddy\" Rogers was raised by an active, wholesome family in Olathe, Kansas. He was boyishly good-looking and musically talented. At the University of Kansas, he played several instruments and conducted a jazz band. When his father submitted his son's photo to a film company talent search in 1925, Rogers was selected as a finalist. Soon he went to New York for training.\n\nMy Best Girl\n\nRogers starred in a couple of films before landing a major role in Wings (1927). The film, an epic for its time, featured sequences of dogfights and collisions shot from the air. The role positioned Rogers to get the part of Joe Grant in a light romantic comedy, My Best Girl (1927) -- where he met Mary Pickford. In the love scenes, it was plain to everyone that the two had chemistry.\n\nA True Showman\n\nHis good looks and charm earned Rogers the nickname, \"America's Boyfriend.\" People loved him in romantic comedies, but his acting career faltered when he was cast in second-rate films. Rogers turned back to music, and with Pickford's help he organized an orchestra, the California Cavaliers. The Cavaliers played jazz versions of the day's popular hits. Rogers was a true showman, and though not the most talented musician, he entertained with a broad smile and engaging personality.\n\nParenthood\n\nPickford had always pictured herself becoming a mother. She had wanted to adopt a child with Fairbanks, in fact, but the marriage ended with no children. Six years after she and Buddy were married, Pickford, at age 51, realized that she was running out of time. The couple visited an orphanage, where a six-year-old boy dressed impeccably in a suit enchanted them. After a day spent entertaining the boy, Pickford was enamored with him. She and Rogers officially adopted Ronald \"Ronnie\" Charles Rogers in 1943.\n\nMary Pickford Library\n\nA Little Girl\n\nLess than a year after Ronnie joined the family, Pickford was back at the orphanage, marveling over babies. She was taken with a dark-haired girl with a bright countenance. \"More than I ever wanted anything in my life, I wanted that baby,\" Pickford would say. The impatient mother could hardly wait the few weeks it took to process the adoption papers. When the adoption was approved, she raced to pick up the child, Roxanne, and drove home in a frenzy. She had not even told Buddy, who was serving as a lieutenant in the Air Force, about the infant's arrival. In her excitement she had also failed to acquire all of the necessities for a baby's comfort, revealing her shortcomings as a parent.\n\nGrowing up at Pickfair\n\nThe children's life in a Hollywood mansion was not normal. \"It was so big,\" Ronnie would remember, \"you needed a road map to find the bathroom. I was in awe, but they told me I was going to be living there.\" Pickford and Rogers treated the children like theatrical props, sending them to boarding schools and posing them in family photographs when they were home on visits. Pickford became critical of their physical imperfections, including Ronnie's small stature and Roxanne's crooked teeth. Both children would later remark that their mother was too self-interested to provide genuine maternal love.\n\nOut of Sight\n\nAs Ronnie entered adolescence, he became cold and surly towards his mother. His sister grew rebellious. Both children married in their late teens, and Ronnie became so troubled that he once attempted suicide. Pickford went to see him in the hospital, complaining that he had interrupted a well-needed rest she was taking. It was at this point that the children faded from the public eye. Pickford and Rogers stopped talking about them and their friends stopped asking.\n\nDeprived\n\nJournalists reported that Roxanne and Ron worked odd jobs in the 1970s, and both lacked money. Devoted Pickford followers wondered why the children of a wealthy Hollywood icon should be financially deprived. After Pickford's death, their financial straits did not improve. Pickford's original will had granted each child $15,000, which she upped to $50,000 before she died. But the actual amounts they received from the estate were significantly smaller, according to Ronnie. Still, he had kind words for Mary Pickford. \"I miss my mother,\" he would say in 2003. \"Things didn't work out that much. You know. But I'll never forget her. I think that she was a good woman.\""}, {"url": "https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/pickford-and-fairbanks-mobbed-by-crowds", "page_content": "Swarms of admirers mob the Hollywood film actors Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, who arrive in London on their honeymoon on June 21, 1920.

She died in 1979 at the age of 87."}, {"url": "https://wfpp.columbia.edu/pioneer/ccp-mary-pickford/", "page_content": "by Christel Schmidt Mary Pickford was born Gladys Smith in 1892 in Toronto, Canada. After her father was killed in an accident, Gladys became the family\u2019s main breadwinner by performing in the theatre. She was seven years old. In fact, the stage became a family venture, as her younger siblings Lottie and Jack and even her mother took up the trade. But the drive and determination to be a star belonged solely to Gladys. In 1907, her ambition would take her to Broadway and famed producer-director David Belasco, who changed her name to Mary Pickford and gave her a part in \u201cThe Warrens of Virginia.\u201d In 1909, when Pickford was between stage engagements, she approached director D. W. Griffith at the Biograph Company in New York and asked for work in moving pictures. She had no intention of working permanently in the new medium, but hoped the income would tide her over before she went back to Belasco and the stage. Pickford was intrigued with film acting, and before long she began to enjoy \u201cposing\u201d for motion pictures. She stayed with the Biograph Company, working as both an actress and writer from 1909 to 1911, leaving for a brief stint with the Independent Motion Picture Company (IMP), and later with Majestic Pictures Corporation. She returned to Griffith at Biograph in early 1912, finishing out the year with him. In 1913, after a run on Broadway in \u201cA Good Little Devil,\u201d Pickford made a definitive break from the stage by signing a motion picture contract with Adolph Zukor and the Famous Players Film Company. The year 1913 marked the dawn of the feature motion picture, and Pickford was about to become its biggest star. In fact, she came to feature films with a well-established legacy. In 1911, \u201cMoving Picture Mary\u201d was the first movie star to adorn the cover of the New York Dramatic Mirror, an honor previously bestowed only on theatrical stars. And because moviegoers had already singled Pickford out as a favorite, her success in features was guaranteed. In 1914, Pickford\u2019s Tess of the Storm Country, the story of a fiery young woman fighting for the underclass, caused a sensation. The extraordinary reaction made Pickford an international star and created fan worship that had never before been witnessed. In turn, this success gave Mary Pickford incredible bargaining power. In 1916, Pickford had negotiated a contract that gave her a $10,000 a week salary, 50% of her film profits, and her own production company. Pickford would sign off on every aspect of her productions, from the script to the director. She was even known to have had a hand in editing. During these years she worked with directors Maurice Tourneur and Marshall Neilan, the writer Frances Marion, and made some of the best features of her career, including Poor Little Rich Girl (1917), Stella Maris (1918), and The Hoodlum (1919). Pickford is often remembered for her portrayals of children in films including Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1917) and Daddy-Long-Legs (1919). The stories were adapted from popular novels and had been performed on stage with an adult actress (Edith Taliaferro and Ruth Chatterton) playing the role of a young girl. Pickford\u2019s petite size and youthful beauty made her ideal for these parts, but it was her acting talent that seared these roles into the public consciousness. Her portrait of childhood captured both the simplicity and complexity of a young person\u2019s inner world, and also its physicality, through body language and mannerism. In 1919, when she was only twenty-seven years old, Pickford cofounded United Artists, the first independent film distribution company, along with Charlie Chaplin, D. W. Griffith, and her future husband Douglas Fairbanks. Then in 1920 she and Fairbanks were wed in a private ceremony, but they shared their married life with the world. At first, the couple had feared a negative reaction (both were already married when they met), but their union only fed into the romantic fantasies many fans had about Hollywood. The couple was mobbed at every port on their whirlwind European honeymoon. Back in California, they relished their place as the King and Queen of Hollywood, holding court at their home, known as Pickfair. Pickford decided to make only one film a year after 1921, focusing on the quality of her productions. Many believe that she was at her creative peak during the teens, but her films of the 1920s were the most successful. Favorite titles from this decade include a remake of Tess of the Storm Country (1922), Rosita (1923), and Sparrows (1926). Her last silent film, My Best Girl (1927), would be one of the greatest of the era. The decade\u2019s last year brought about major changes in the industry and for Mary Pickford. By 1929, the Talkies had all but obliterated silent film. Pickford knew she could not resist the change. She cut her old-fashioned curls and made two Talkies before the decade ended. Coquette (1929) won her an Oscar for best actress, and Taming of the Shrew (1929) featured the much-anticipated pairing of Pickford and Fairbanks. But even with good reviews and promotion, these films were not as successful as her silent pictures. She attempted two more sound features, then retired in 1933 after twenty-three years of making movies. And though she kept on producing films after retiring, the experience was not as rich as running her own career had been. Pickford, whose professional decline had begun in the same year as the death of her beloved mother, Gladys, in 1928, saw her brother and sister die in the 1930s. In 1936, her fairytale marriage to Fairbanks ended in divorce. Fairbanks died of heart failure only three years later. In 1937, Pickford married actor Charles \u201cBuddy\u201d Rogers, her costar in My Best Girl. The marriage lasted until Mary Pickford\u2019s death in 1979.

The sound track on these prints is different than the original 1929 version. Several films exist as incomplete prints: A Timely Repentance, At a Quarter of Two, A Good Little Devil, Less than the Dust, Daddy-Long-Legs, The Hoodlum, Tess of the Storm Country. The author states that there are silent versions of Coquette and The Taming of the Shrew. It is believed that Mary Pickford wrote Their First Misunderstanding (1911), while IMDb credits George Loane Tucker.\n\nCitation\n\nSchmidt, Christel. \"Mary Pickford.\" In Jane Gaines, Radha Vatsal, and Monica Dall\u2019Asta, eds.

Many remember her career and her films, but few know of the years that followed. Pickford's life is a cautionary tale for aspiring stars, highlighting the triumphs and the troubles of fame.\n\nMary Pickford Library\n\nThe Talkies\n\nThe era of synchronized sound began in 1926, when Warner Brothers released Don Juan with sound effects and a musical accompaniment. Many in Hollywood were skeptical of introducing sound to film. Top filmmaker D.W. Griffith dismissed the idea, saying \"speaking movies are impossible. When a century has passed, all thought of our so-called 'talking pictures' will be abandoned.\" Pickford considered sound a frivolous ornamentation to the medium, \"like putting lip rouge on the Venus de Milo.\" But audiences responded with rapturous excitement, just as they had when the earliest, simplest films had debuted.\n\nThe Future\n\nSoon, the powerful stars of the silent cinema were no longer in control. Talkies had arrived, and by 1930 silent film would be a dead medium. Pickford attempted a talkie -- she was the first major silent film star to try it -- and though she disliked pictures with sound, she saw that they were the future. She tried to adapt, using techniques from her stage acting days, and achieved reasonable success with Coquette in 1929. But the film quality was poor, with distracting background noise, and Pickford's flirtatious character troubled audiences who had typecast her as an innocent, years before.\n\nProblems\n\nWith sound, Pickford faced new challenges. How would she incorporate her voice into her screen acting, rather than relying on expressions and gestures? Could she make the transition to quiet sets, which eliminated dialogue with the director? How would she deal with the particular limitations of the existing sound technology? Actors' movements were restricted, because they had to stay in range of a microphone. The problem led to stilted performances.\n\nOut of Fashion\n\nHowever, Pickford's greatest challenges were not related to sound. They were the new expectations from fans, who wanted jazzier stories and sexier stars. Pickford's relative age and her association with old-fashioned roles hindered her as much as sound technology did. Pickford made five talking films, attempting to keep pace with the new technology. Yet she recognized the approaching end to her career and her stardom.\n\nMarriage Troubles\n\nIf this was not enough, her marriage to Douglas Fairbanks was also in crisis. As early as 1925, Pickford realized that her husband was drifting from her. He too, was struggling with the advent of sound and the limits his age was placing on his brand of physical comedy. Accustomed to the limelight and public adoration, Fairbanks grew fearful and unsettled by the shift in his career. As their marriage fell apart, Pickford succumbed to her family's affliction: alcoholism.\n\nA New Companion\n\nPickford's former co-star and companion Buddy Rogers started proposing in 1936, after Pickford and Fairbanks divorced. It was common knowledge that Rogers loved Pickford from the moment he met her. Tongues wagged over the age difference; Pickford was 12 years his senior. To some, Pickford's acceptance of Rogers looked like an act of revenge on Fairbanks, who divorced Pickford and married his longtime mistress that same year.\n\nLoyal Partner\n\nPickford and Rogers were married in 1937, and after living briefly at Rogers' home, moved back to Pickfair, the estate Fairbanks and Pickford had shared. Rogers was devoted to his new wife, though she sometimes called him \"Douglas\" when she'd had too much to drink.\n\nRecluse\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, Pickford tried producing movies and working in radio. But what she was best at was selling Mary Pickford, not developing the talent of others. Without her mother and without Fairbanks, she seemed to have lost her touch. When she wasn't working, she filled her time with charity events and increasingly troubled relations with her two adopted children. More and more, she secluded herself at Pickfair and anesthetized herself with alcohol.\n\nA Second Oscar\n\nIn 1976 Pickford was awarded her second Oscar (her first was for Coquette in 1930), for lifetime achievement in the motion picture industry. She was too weak to attend the ceremony, so the awards show producers filmed her at Pickfair. Pickford cut an eerie figure, dressed in a satin robe with a fur collar and draped in jewels. Her wig of blonde curls, false eyelashes, and garish lipstick made her a ghost of the vivacious beauty she had been. The public was appalled by her appearance and her garbled speech. Mike Royko of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"Mary Pickford, the one-time screen darling of America, has managed to offend people. She did it by growing old.\""}, {"url": "https://oneroomwithaview.com/2014/04/07/mary-pickford-the-rise-and-fall-of-americas-sweetheart/", "page_content": "She was the first star of the silver screen, the undisputed Queen of Hollywood and one half of its ultimate power couple, a pioneer of screen acting and a savvy businesswoman. Known as \u2018America\u2019s Sweetheart\u2019, a nod to her talent for playing little-girl roles, which she did until well into her thirties, Mary Pickford was, nonetheless, a woman who knew her own mind and took charge of her own career. She may have looked young and innocent with her flowing hair and a diminutive stature, but Pickford, \u2018The Girl with the Golden Curls\u2019 and \u2018Little Mary\u2019, was tough.\n\nHaving endured hardship during the early years of her childhood in Canada, Pickford started earning money at seven years old when she made her stage debut at Toronto\u2019s Princess Theatre in 1899, under her real name of Gladys Smith. The family then began a spate of six years touring around America with third-rate theatre companies. After failed attempts to land a Broadway role, she finally succeeded in 1906, and in 1907 her determination saw powerful theatre producer David Belasco agree to meet with her. Gladys Smith emerged from this meeting as Mary Pickford.\n\nLife as an actress, however, was still not steady enough so Pickford found herself making the demeaning decision (for a theatre actress) to appear in moving pictures. In 1909 she began working at D.W. Griffith\u2019s Biograph Company, neatly negotiating herself a salary of double the going rate ($10 a day). She featured in 51 films that year, playing all sizes and sorts of parts.\n\nWorking alongside innovator Griffith, Pickford quickly learned to consider and appreciate the technical aspects of filming, and more specifically the relationship of the actor with the camera. Pickford realised that when on screen, far less of the stylized, grandiose theatre acting was required and naturalistic movements and expressions came across far better. Her talent for self-appraisal also saw Pickford recognise her aptitude for light, comical roles. 1910\u2019s Wilful Peggy gave her her first opportunity to play a character as she wanted to, making Peggy vibrant and resilient in contrast to the more usual insipid, Victorian female characters of the day. This characterization would become Pickford\u2019s trademark.\n\nSoon, Mary Pickford was the most popular actress at Biograph and the next few years saw her making films in California and swapping to Carl Laemmle\u2019s Independent Moving Pictures Company for 1911 as the industry hit its stride. In 1913 she joined Adolph Zuckor\u2019s illustrious company Famous Players in Famous Plays, later known as Paramount Pictures. Pickford\u2019s career blossomed as she received her first above-title marquee billing in 1914\u2019s Hearts Adrift (the success and critical acclaim of which she used as the basis for her first of many salary increases). Some of her most famous and enduring pictures were made during these years, such as The Poor Little Rich Girl and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (both 1917).\n\n1919 heralded the most important move of Pickford\u2019s career: she formed the independent film production company United Artists, alongside Charlie Chaplin, D.W. Griffith and Douglas Fairbanks (this event is popularly believed to be the origin of the phrase \u201cthe lunatics are taking over the asylum!\u201d). She could now have complete control over how she distributed her films, as well as continuing to produce and perform in them. More triumphs followed, such as Pollyanna (1920) and Little Lord Fauntleroy (1921).\n\nFairbanks and Pickford by this time were involved in an affair and would go on to divorce their respective spouses and marry in 1920. This union would put \u2018Brangelina\u2019 to shame. Pickford was regarded as the most famous woman in the world and Fairbanks was a massive star in his own right, famous for his daring stunt work and swashbuckling roles. They were the first stars to officially put their hands in cement outside Grauman\u2019s Chinese Theater. Anyone who was anyone was clamouring for an invitation to a gathering at their Hollywood mansion, dubbed \u2018Pickfair\u2019. Guests included George Bernard Shaw, H.G. Wells, Albert Einstein, Amelia Earhart, F. Scott Fitzgerald and, of course, Fairbanks\u2019 close friend Chaplin.\n\nThe advent of talkies in 1927 was to signal the beginning of the end for Pickford. Despite earning the first Academy Award for an actress in a sound picture for 1929\u2019s Coquette, the audiences could not warm to a Pickford that spoke. Speaking showed Mary Pickford to be a woman in her mid-thirties, as did her new bob hairstyle (Pickford having cut off her celebrated curls after the death of her mother), and no longer \u2018America\u2019s Sweetheart\u2019. Following the commercial failure of Pickford and Fairbanks teaming up for The Taming of the Shrew later that year, Pickford\u2019s career was all but over. She made only three more pictures and retired from acting in 1933. She and Fairbanks were divorced in 1936.\n\nMary Pickford\u2019s star faded into obscurity as the actress failed to find new work and slumped into alcoholism, the same addiction that had infected her entire family. Decades of nothingness followed and Pickford became a virtual recluse. 1976, however, brought an Honorary Academy Award for the actress in recognition of her vast contribution to the motion picture industry. She was, after all, a founding member of the Academy."}, {"url": "https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/inside-mary-pickford-and-douglas-fairbanks-love-story-divorce/", "page_content": "A little after 10:30 p.m. on March 28, 1920, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweetheart\u201d Mary Pickford married the love of her life, dashing actor Douglas Fairbanks, in a secret ceremony witnessed by only a handful of trusted people.\n\nMary had agonized that fans might frown on their marriage \u2014 both were wed to others when they started their affair \u2014 but her worries were baseless. Throngs of well-wishers greeted the couple at every stop on their European honeymoon.\n\nGlasshouse Images/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cThey were more beloved and better known than anybody in the world,\u201d explains Tracey Goessel, author of The First King of Hollywood: The Life of Douglas Fairbanks. \u201cThe fact that these two adored people were in love with each other made everybody feel good.\u201d\n\nIn the nascent years of the motion picture industry, no stars shined brighter than \u201cMary and Doug.\u201d The first to ever have her name in marquee lights, Mary, with her trademark curls, built her career playing sweet, innocent heroines, while Douglas brought daredevil heroes like Zorro and Robin Hood to the big screen.\n\n\u201cThey embodied the youth, optimism and energy of their era,\u201d says Goessel. \u201cAnd the public interest in their marriage only added fuel to the fire of their fame.\u201d\n\nDouglas brought his bride home to a hunting lodge in then-unglamorous Beverly Hills. They christened it \u201cPickfair\u201d and turned it into a 25-room mansion complete with a home theater and LA\u2019s first in-ground swimming pool. \u201cFor the first seven years of their marriage, they were never apart for a single night,\u201d notes Goessel.\n\nThe couple threw lavish dinners with guests including Charlie Chaplin, Amelia Earhart, Albert Einstein and F. Scott Fitzgerald. \u201cThey would get prints of films from other studios and everyone would get together and watch,\u201d says Goessel.\n\nEND OF A DREAM\n\nThe late 1920s began to tarnish the luster of this golden couple. In 1928, Mary\u2019s mother died of cancer and the grief-stricken star began drinking. She and Douglas also had trouble adapting to the new technology of \u201ctalking\u201d pictures. Finally, seeds of distrust began to cause cracks in their marriage.\n\nHistoria/Shutterstock\n\nAfter Mary heard whispers of Douglas\u2019 flirtation with a teenage actress, she allowed her husband to catch her getting cozy with a costar. \u201cFairbanks was pathologically jealous, so he assumed she had strayed,\u201d says Goessel. She hadn\u2019t, but the damage was done. \u201cEach thought the other had sinned first, so Douglas became a discreet rake. And Mary did begin an affair with her co-star.\u201d\n\nTheir marriage proved unsalvageable and they divorced in 1936. \u201cAfter trying to get Mary to take him back, Douglas rebounded and married his lover,\u201d says Goessel. \u201cHe regretted it every day for the rest of his life.\u201d The actor filmed his last feature in 1934 and died of a heart attack in 1939.\n\nMary\u2019s Academy Award for Best Actress in 1930 would become her swan song. She retired from films in 1933. Although she would remarry and adopt two children, she became an alcoholic and spent her last decade as a recluse at Pickfair, the mansion she and Douglas had built together. She passed away in 1979 at age 87.\n\n\u2014 Louise A Barile, with reporting by Katie Bruno"}, {"url": "https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/mary-pickford", "page_content": "Canadian-born film actress Mary Pickford.\n\nMary Pickford, n\u00e9e Gladys Louise Smith, actor, producer and writer (born 8 April 1892 in Toronto, ON; died 29 May 1979 in Santa Monica, California). Pickford was a pioneering figure of early cinema who became one of the most renowned stars of the silent film era. She was a trailblazer for women in the motion picture industry.\n\nEarly Life\n\nMary Pickford was the eldest child of Charlotte (n\u00e9e Hennessey) and John Charles Smith. She had a sister, Charlotte (Lottie) (1893\u20131936); and a brother, John (Jack) (1896\u20131933). At about the age of four, she fell ill with diphtheria, and was baptized by a Roman Catholic priest and her middle name was changed to Marie. John Smith died in 1898, apparently from a head injury suffered in a fall, leaving his family almost destitute. In need of money, Charlotte rented a room to a stage manager of the Cummings Stock Company of Toronto. He suggested that Charlotte cast her young daughters in a play. Pickford made her stage debut with the Valentine Stock Company in 1898 in Bootle\u2019s Baby. In 1900, she performed at Toronto\u2019s Princess Theatre. She played two parts, a boy and a girl, in The Silver King by Henry Arthur Jones and Henry Herman . That led to further roles in Toronto theatres. The following year, the whole family joined a touring theatrical troupe. In 1907, they joined the David Belasco Theatre Company in New York. At Belasco\u2019s suggestion, Gladys changed her name to Mary Pickford, a combination of her own middle name and that of her maternal grandfather, John Pickford Hennessey. Charlotte, Lottie and Jack also adopted the name Pickford. That year, Pickford began her long run in William de Mille\u2019s hit play The Warrens of Virginia at the Belasco Theatre on Broadway.\n\nFirst Movie Roles\n\nIn 1909, Pickford sought work in the new medium of motion pictures. She made her first cinematic appearance in the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company\u2019s short film Her First Biscuits, directed by D.W. Griffith. She signed with the Biograph Company at $10 a day, and was given her first starring movie role in The Violin Maker of Cremona. It was quickly followed by They Would Elope.\n\nIn January 1910, Pickford went with Biograph to California, where she continued to make films directed by Griffith. By this time, Pickford was attracting the attention of audiences and critics. Although Pickford was only slightly more than five feet tall, her feisty characters dominated the screen. She had an instinctive understanding of how to play for the camera as opposed to a live theatre audience. Unlike the many stage actors who failed to make the transition to cinema, Pickford moved to the vanguard of performers who fused psychological realism with silent film\u2019s balletic gesture. The result was an unprecedented intimacy between the actor on the screen and the movie theatre audience. This new relationship, sparked by Pickford\u2019s acting genius and her onscreen image as a comic spitfire, triggered a Mary Pickford craze that grew more intense with the advent of feature films that were more than an hour long.\n\nWhen popular star Florence Lawrence left Biograph in 1910 to join Carl Laemmle\u2019s Independent Moving Picture Company (IMP), Pickford replaced her as \u201cThe Biograph Girl.\u201d But within the year she broke with Biograph and signed with IMP. In 1911, Pickford married actor Owen Moore. He was her leading man that year in Their First Misunderstanding.\n\nBetween 1912 and 1919, Pickford made films for several studios, working with such directors as Griffith, Owen Moore, Mack Sennett, Wilfred Lucas and Cecil B. DeMille. Among the dozens of films in which Pickford starred during this period were The Informer (1912), The Unwelcome Guest (1913), Cinderella (1914), Madame Butterfly (1915), The Foundling (1916), Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1917), Poor Little Rich Girl (1917), Stella Maris (1918) and The Hoodlum (1919). She also formed her own production company, and on some projects contributed as a scriptwriter. In the winter of 1912\u201313, Pickford took a temporary leave from filmmaking to star in Belasco\u2019s Broadway production of Rosamund Gerard and Maurice Rostand\u2019s play A Good Little Devil.\n\nBy 1919, Pickford was one of the most popular stars in the evolving motion picture community of Hollywood, as well as one of the most highly paid. She was affectionately called \u201cThe Girl With the Golden Hair,\u201d \u201cLittle Mary,\u201d \u201cGoldilocks\u201d and \u201cThe Girl With the Curls.\u201d But in spite of her Canadian background, she was most famously known as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweetheart.\u201d\n\nUnited Artists\n\nIn February 1919, Pickford, Griffith and film stars Douglas Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin officially formed United Artists Corporation in order to maintain greater financial and artistic control over their productions. Pickford established the Mary Pickford Company, which produced films exclusively for distribution by United Artists. Her first movie made under the new arrangement, Pollyanna (1920), grossed over a million dollars.\n\nPickford and Fairbanks\n\nIn March 1920, Pickford divorced Moore on the grounds of desertion. Later that month, she married Fairbanks and became an American citizen. They moved into a Beverley Hills mansion they called \u201cPickfair.\u201d Hollywood\u2019s most glamorous couple had a European honeymoon and was mobbed by fans in London and Paris.\n\nPickford was now at the height of her acting career and made some of her most memorable films: Little Lord Fauntleroy (1921), Tess of the Storm Country (1922), Rosita (1923), Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall (1924), Little Annie Rooney (1925) and Sparrows (1926). In 1921, Pickford was a co-founder and first vice-president of the Motion Picture Relief Fund, which provided financial assistance for film industry employees in need. Jack and Lottie Pickford also had success as movie actors, but they never reached the same level of fame as Mary.\n\nIn May 1926, Sid Grauman\u2019s Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood made movie history by featuring a double premiere: Pickford\u2019s Sparrows and Fairbanks\u2019 The Black Pirate, in which Pickford made an uncredited cameo appearance. In 1927, Pickford and Fairbanks were the first stars to make imprints of their hands and feet in cement in the forefront of Grauman\u2019s Chinese Theatre. That year, they were among the 36 founders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (known for the Academy Awards, or \u201cThe Oscars\u201d). Fairbanks was elected its first president.\n\nChanging Times\n\nIn 1927, Pickford co-starred with Charles \u201cBuddy\u201d Rogers in My Best Girl. It was her last silent movie. The enormous success of the first \u201ctalking picture,\u201d The Jazz Singer, starring Al Jolson, marked the end of the silent film era.\n\nPickford lost her mother to cancer in 1928. Overcoming grief and an initial ambivalence toward the new medium of sound, she starred in Coquette (1929), for which she received the Academy Award for Best Actress. That year, Pickford was also in The Taming of the Shrew, the only film in which she and Fairbanks co-starred. It failed at the box office.\n\nPickford\u2019s final major screen appearance was in Secrets (1933). It opened the same week President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered a temporary closure of the banks as a measure to fight the Great Depression. Like all other films released that week, Secrets did poorly at the box office. Now past the age at which she could play the perky young heroines that had endeared her to audiences, Pickford retired from acting. However, she was still active as a producer.\n\nPickford separated from Fairbanks in 1933 on grounds of infidelity and eventually divorced him. In 1934, Pickford published a novel, The Demi-Widow, written with the assistance of Belle Burns Gromer. She also wrote Why Not Try God?, a booklet promoting Christian Science. A similar booklet, My Rendezvous With Life, would follow a year later.\n\nIn May 1934, Pickford made a triumphant return to her hometown of Toronto. She was given an official civic reception, and crowds of fans jammed the downtown streets. Pickford was presented with a gold Centennial medal, and in a speech in which she paid homage to her parents, she said, \u201cI am proud to be a Canadian.\u201d\n\nPickford married Buddy Rogers in 1937. They adopted two children: Ronald Charles Pickford Rogers and Roxanne Pickford Rogers.\n\nLater Years\n\nPickford engaged in business enterprises such as Mary Pickford Cosmetics, was co-founder of the Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers, and established the Mary Pickford Charitable Trust, later renamed the Mary Pickford Foundation. But in her declining years she became reclusive and was plagued by alcoholism and depression. Her participation in 1953 in the first television broadcast of the Academy Awards was one of very few public appearances. In 1976, Pickford did not attend the Academy Awards ceremony to receive an honorary lifetime achievement Oscar. She accepted the award from Pickfair.\n\nStating that she \u201cwished to die as a Canadian,\u201d Pickford successfully applied to reclaim her Canadian citizenship. At the time of her death from a stroke, she held dual Canadian-American citizenship. Mary Pickford is recognized internationally as a dynamic and iconic figure in the history of cinema. In Toronto she is honoured with a bust and a plaque at the Hospital for Sick Children, which now occupies the site of her birth, and with a star on Canada\u2019s Walk of Fame."}, {"url": "https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/mary-pickford-was-first-movie-superstar/", "page_content": "Mary Pickford was a dirt-poor theater actress of 17 when she made her silent-film debut in 1909.\n\nThrough a combination of pioneering acting skills, savvy business sense and fierce determination, she became the most famous woman in the world within a decade on her way to building a filmmaking empire.\n\nPickford co-founded the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, whose 85th annual Academy Awards ceremony was to be held Sunday. The Academy's late historian Robert Cushman called her \"the most popular, powerful, prominent and influential woman in the history of cinema.\"\n\nPickford (1892-1979) was born in Toronto as Gladys Marie Smith (her stage name would come from her mother's side of the family).\n\nHer father, an alcoholic, left the family when she was 3 and died three years later. Her mother could barely pay the bills with sewing and taking in boarders.\n\nAt 7, Pickford won a part in a local theater production and soon became the family's breadwinner. Two younger siblings joined the stock company and, accompanied by their mother, toured Canada and America.\n\n\"She shouldered the family cause with focus and ruthless efficiency,\" Eileen Whitfield, author of \"Pickford: The Woman Who Made Hollywood,\" told IBD. \"She was tenacious, single-minded, determined, uncomplaining, uncompromising \u2014 a fanatic.\"\n\nBig Apple, Big Plan\n\nAfter six years of struggle, Pickford vowed to be in a production on Broadway within a year or she would quit theater entirely. She set her sights on New York's top impresario, David Belasco.\n\n\"Pickford spent most of the summer of 1907 sitting in his outer office on casting days, but went unnoticed,\" wrote Christel Schmidt, editor of a new assessment of her career, \"Mary Pickford: Queen of the Movies.\" \"She decided to seek an introduction and approached the maid of one of his stars, receiving permission to use the star's name. She then caused such a fuss with the office boy that Belasco's manager came out to meet her.\"\n\nWhen Belasco himself met with Pickford a few weeks later, he asked why she had chosen him. Her response: \"My mother always told me to aim high or not at all.\"\n\nCharmed by her chutzpah, he cast her in a supporting role and chose her stage name.\n\nPickford's early lesson is that persistence beyond reason will pay off.\n\nIn 1909, director D.W. Griffith gave Pickford a screen test and was impressed by her grasp of a more intimate type of acting for the camera. He offered her the standard $5 per day, but in a show of brazen self-confidence, she insisted on double that and a guarantee of $40 a week \u2014 worth $1,000 today. The following year she traveled to Hollywood with Griffith's crew.\n\n\"She was a naturalistic actor by instinct, feeling her way into character, at a time when broad gestures and melodramatic expressions were common,\" wrote Molly Haskell in the Schmidt volume. \"Director George Cukor said that Pickford invented screen acting and was the first method actress. In appearance alone, she ranges from the winsomely beautiful to the almost unrecognizably, even grotesquely plain. Then there are her amazingly varied incarnations: child, adolescent, and mother; she is a tomboy and coquette; the queen of Herzegovina and a cockney laundress; she is sweet, fierce and ingenious; she plays Spanish, French, Scottish, and even Asian.\"\n\nMost of her movies \u2014 such as \"Tess of the Storm Country,\" \"The Poor Little Rich Girl,\" \"Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm\" and \"Stella Maris\" \u2014 were hits. Initially, they didn't mention the names of the cast; even so, Pickford soon became a household name.\n\nIn 1916 she signed an unprecedented contract with the Famous Players studio, giving her half the profits of the movies she starred in, with a guarantee of $500,000 a year (at a time when the average job in the U.S. paid $750), as well as a signing bonus of $300,000 \u2014 and $40,000 to compensate her and her mother for the month they spent negotiating the deal.\n\nShe also received creative control of her films. \"Pickford had a reputation as a savvy negotiator who was able to survey the landscape of the industry, assess the value she brought to the endeavor and make sure she was compensated for her contributions,\" said Laura Isabel Serna, a professor at the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts. \"Over the course of her career during the silent period she pursued profitable partnerships with producers and other performers. She managed her own career and was constantly analyzing trends in the types of films audiences preferred and positioning herself to not only make money, but also shape the power of the star system in organizing an entire industry.\"\n\nPickford's lesson is to develop the self-confidence to demand what you deserve.\n\nBonding With America\n\nIn 1918, having become a passionate American citizen, Pickford did an exhausting tour of the U.S. to promote Liberty Bond sales for the World War I effort. She spoke to 50,000 people at one rally on Wall Street, and at a speech in Chicago she raised $5 million, worth $75 million today.\n\nThe next year, Pickford, her boyfriend, actor Douglas Fairbanks; their best friend, actor Charlie Chaplin; and director Griffith formed United Artists. This was an independent production company devoted to letting filmmakers and actors work on projects the way they wanted and distribute movies in the optimum way. Prior to this, studios distributed pictures only to theaters they owned.\n\nThe UA actors whom they regularly worked with shared their vision of artistic integrity and stayed loyal through the firm's financial ups and downs. Some of Pickford's top UA pictures were \"My Best Girl,\" \"Little Lord Fauntleroy,\" \"Sparrows\" and \"Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall.\"\n\nIn 1920, Pickford and Fairbanks married and went to Europe for their honeymoon, meeting a mob everywhere from Paris to Moscow.\n\n\"They became the first celebrity supercouple; their movies spread American culture and values around the world and made them the nation's unofficial ambassadors,\" wrote Schmidt.\n\nIn 1927, Pickford was one of three women and 33 men who founded the Academy to promote quality filmmaking. Today, one of its offices in Hollywood is the Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study.\n\nHands-On\n\nPickford became devoted to preservation of early films and spearheaded what is now the Motion Picture & Television Fund to help those in the industry in need.\n\nIn late 1927, the first movie with sound, \"The Jazz Singer,\" debuted. Most stars and directors of the silent-movie era, including Pickford, were convinced it was a passing fad. Yet two years later she became one of the first stars to appear in a talkie. \"Coquette\" was a smash hit and earned her the Academy Award for best actress.\n\nAlthough she had an adequate voice for the new medium, her other sound picture efforts didn't do well at the box office.\n\nMany silent-film producers went under once they turned to sound. Stars from the old era also had trouble. \"Silent-film actors were expected to have the voices that the audience had imagined for them,\" said Whitfield. \"Much of the dialogue in the early talkies was inane or incoherent. Performers spoke with exaggerated diction and were victims of bad recordings. The artists of the silent era were masters of a different, now discarded, art form.\"\n\nIn 1933, Pickford divorced Fairbanks and retired from acting, having appeared in 236 films. She continued to produce for UA. One of her best returns came from the Marx brothers' \"Love Happy\" of 1949.\n\nShe sold her remaining UA shares in 1959 for $3 million, worth $23 million today. Pickford pursued other ventures, including nationally syndicated radio programs, advice columns, writing books and a cosmetics company, as well as philanthropy. In 1976 the Academy honored her with its Lifetime Achievement award.\n\nIn 2009, a documentary, \"Mary Pickford: The Muse of the Movies\" was released to acclaim.\n\nWhen Pickford died at 87, her estate was valued at $10 million, but may have been worth as much as $50 million, says Whitfield. Her charitable work is carried on by the Mary Pickford Foundation. The Mary Pickford Institute for Film Education won an award in 2012 for its use of digital technology."}, {"url": "https://news.amomama.com/230799-inside-mary-pickford-douglas-fairbanks-i.html", "page_content": "Getty Images\n\nIn the history of Hollywood couples, there were none quite as significant as that of the legendary pair, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks.

Griffith's American Biography company. She also worked as a producer and co-founded United Artists, with Charlie Chaplin, and Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., who would become her second husband. Pickford retired from the screen in 1933 but continued to produce. She died in 1979.\n\nEarly Life\n\nActress, producer and screenwriter Gladys Mary Smith was born on April 8, 1892, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Known as \"America\u2019s Sweetheart,\" Mary Pickford was a legendary film actress during the age of silent pictures. She often appeared on screen in young girl roles, even when she was an adult. Pickford began performing at the age of five on the stage and was known for a time as \"Baby Gladys.\" After touring in different shows and productions for more than nine years, she went to New York to conquer Broadway. Taking the stage name, Mary Pickford, she made her Broadway debut in The Warrens of Virginia.\n\nSoon after the show\u2019s run, Pickford got into film, working for D. W. Griffith, a director and head of American Biography Company. At the time, most films were short and she appeared in more than 40 movies in 1909. When Griffith moved his operation to California the following year, Pickford went with him. Over the years, her fame grew as well as her salary. She became an international star, beloved for her beauty and charm.\n\nCreation of United Artists\n\nSome of Pickford\u2019s greatest films were a collaborative effort with friend and writer-director Frances Marion. Together they worked on such hits as Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1917) and Poor Little Rich Girl (1917). Pickford also worked behind the scenes as a producer and founded the United Artists (UA), a film company, in 1919, with Griffith, Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., who would become her second husband. She had been married to actor Owen Moore and divorced him to be with Fairbanks.\n\nPickford and Fairbanks married in 1920, becoming one of Hollywood\u2019s earliest super couples. Fans adored the pairing, and the couple were known to host fabulous events at their home, called Pickfair, which were attended by many of the leading figures in film.\n\nIn the 1920s, Pickford continued to score more box-office hits with Polyanna (1920) and Little Lord Fauntleroy (1922). She went on to help establish the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1927. Around this time, the film industry was changing and talking pictures were on the rise. In 1929, Pickford starred in her first talkie Coquette, which explored the dark side of a wealthy family. She won an Academy Award for her work on the film. Still she was never quite able to recreate the phenomenal success she had in silent pictures with the sound films. Her last film was 1933\u2019s Secrets.\n\nLater Years\n\nAfter retiring from the screen, Pickford continued to be involved in filmmaking. She worked as a producer on such films as One Rainy Afternoon (1936), Susie Steps Out (1946) and Sleep, My Love (1948). She also was on the board of directors for UA for many years.

At the height of her career, she was one of the richest and most famous women in the United States.\n\n(Read Lillian Gish\u2019s 1929 Britannica essay on silent film.)\n\nBritannica Quiz Oscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nGladys Louise Smith grew up in precarious financial circumstances. Shortly after the death of her father, she began taking child\u2019s roles in productions, and soon the rest of the family also began acting. She made her first stage appearance in a Toronto stock company at the age of seven. At eight she went on tour, and within 10 years she was playing on Broadway. She made her New York debut in David Belasco\u2019s The Warrens of Virginia in December 1907. Belasco suggested that she change her name to Mary Pickford. At age 14 she had already learned more about stagecraft than many older actors, and her winsome face, framed by a mass of golden curls, made her appeal virtually irresistible.\n\nPickford began working as a motion-picture extra at D.W. Griffith\u2019s Biograph Company, starring in his 1909 film The Violin Maker of Cremona. Though actors\u2019 names were not listed in film credits, Pickford\u2019s face quickly became well known. After appearing on Broadway in Belasco\u2019s production A Good Little Devil in 1913, she turned permanently to the screen, rising to first rank with Adolph Zukor\u2019s Famous Players Company. Her meteoric rise from an anonymous player to a star with her own production company (Mary Pickford Studios, created in 1916 by Famous Players) was attributable not only to the phenomenal popularity of her films but also to her dedication to her craft and her meticulous care in creating quality entertainments. The ringleted ingenue with an expression of sweet sincerity and invincible innocence that she played in such silent films as Hearts Adrift (1914), The Poor Little Rich Girl (1917), Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1917), Stella Maris (1918), and Johanna Enlists (1918) enthralled audiences everywhere. She was known at first as the \u201cBiograph Girl with the Curls\u201d and then as \u201cOur Mary\u201d when that much of her name was revealed. With the release of Tess of the Storm Country in 1914, she was firmly established as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweetheart.\u201d In 1917 First National Films paid her $350,000 for each of three films, including the very successful Daddy-Long-Legs (1919).\n\nIn 1919 Pickford took the lead in organizing the United Artists Corporation with Griffith, Charlie Chaplin, and Douglas Fairbanks. In 1920, after the dissolution of her first marriage (1911\u201319) to actor Owen Moore, she married Fairbanks (divorced 1936). Pickford\u2019s popularity continued unabated in Pollyanna (1920), Little Lord Fauntleroy (1921), Little Annie Rooney (1925), My Best Girl (1927), Coquette (1929; her first talking picture), The Taming of the Shrew (1929; her only film with Fairbanks), and Kiki (1931). Although she won an Academy Award for best actress for her performance in Coquette, Pickford\u2019s popularity began to wane with the advent of sound.\n\nAfter making Secrets (1933), her 194th film, Pickford retired from the screen. Thereafter she devoted herself to United Artists, of which she was first vice president from 1935 and for which she produced several films. She also wrote Why Not Try God? (1934), The Demi-Widow (1935), and My Rendezvous with Life (1935), and in the 1930s she appeared on radio. In 1937 she married actor Charles (\u201cBuddy\u201d) Rogers. Her later years were spent on business and civic and charitable activities, and she eventually became a recluse at Pickfair, the lavish estate she had built with Fairbanks. Sunshine and Shadow, her autobiography, was published in 1955. She received an honorary Oscar in 1976 for her contributions to film; she accepted the award from Pickfair."}]}
