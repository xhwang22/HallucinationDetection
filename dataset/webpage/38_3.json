Now she is bringing her music back home and has released her brand new single \u2018Yolo Yolo\u2018 with aims of reaching an international audience. Although this is not her first taste of success in her home country back in 2014 her single \u2018MURDA\u2018 charted in the top-ten on BBC1 XTRA.\n\nHere we speak the multi-talented singer/songwriter about her latest release, success in Africa, future plans and much more.\n\nYou are UK born but, your major music success is in Africa how did that happen?\n\nAfter the break up of my former girl band FROM ABOVE, I decided to move to Nigeria under the advise of friends that connected me with some well connected people in Lagos. Within a year of me moving there I had recorded 2 songs and released 1 video\u2026 I started doing shows for free and supporting international acts in Lagos. From there I started networking and earning enough funds to shoot more videos and build a management team around me. The rest is history.\n\nWhat is the best thing about the music industry in Africa?\n\nThe freedom to make the music the way you want. There are no restrictions or bars or limits because everyone is pretty much their own record label. I also really appreciate the genuine love from the fans, it\u2019s really organic.\n\nGrowing up who inspired you to get into music?\n\nMy big brothers a DJ and a bathroom singer. lol\u2026 and my school choir.\n\nWhat made you finally want to bring your music to a global audience?\n\nA single released in 2014 called \u2018MURDA\u2019 did really well considering there was no marketing budget or strategy. It crossed over to the UK and the Caribbean on its own via social media. It then charted in the top 10 in the UK on BBC1 XTRA and not long after I was in discussions with island records with whom I am now signed to.\n\nWhat has the UK\u2019s fans\u2019 reaction been like to your new single \u2018Yolo Yolo\u2019?\n\nI\u2019m not quite sure because I am based in Nigeria but as far as I know all the top stations are playing it and it\u2019s getting mad love.\n\nWhat is the inspiration behind your new release?\n\nI just needed a new wave. so I rode it\u2026 I always look for what\u2019s missing and try to pioneer it. I also wanted to share a bit of my story.\n\nIf you could collaborate with any artist who would you choose?\n\nSade, Adele, SEAL, Lauren Hill, and Labrinth.\n\nWhat has been the biggest highlight of your career so far?\n\nThere have been a few, supporting Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s I AM tour across UK\u2026 Performing a duet with Neo and Wale in front of the whole of Africa and 10,000 people and on live TV. Winning BEST RnB artist at last years NEA awards, making friends with Bono and actually having his direct number. lol. Being featured on rolling stone, Elle, Perez Hilton, CNN, BBC and more for a campaign I was part of with the UN, last year\u2026. so much more.\n\nWhat would be your dream venue to perform at?\n\nMadison Square Garden, New York. I\u2019ve already done Wembley and the O2 but I would like to headline there next time.\n\nWhat do you hope to achieve in the next ten years?\n\nAn international tour. 2 more albums, and to establish my own label.\n\nMake sure you follow Seyi Shay on Twitter @iamseyishay to keep up to date with all her latest music and tour news!\n\nDid you enjoy our exclusive interview with Seyi Shay?
