One oft-proferred explanation centered on a contract that Serin signed on May 17 with his wife, Galina. It specifies that the iamfacingforeclosure.com site must be shuttered \"permanently never to be reopened again\" if Serin did not generate $1,000 in income a week or if he discussed his marital problems publicly--an arrangement that one site said was violated.\n\nIn an earlier conversation with CNET News.com, Galina Serin said she was becoming frustrated with her husband's credit-based spending and had met with her pastor recently for relationship counseling. Of eight homes that her husband hoped to resell at a profit, he lost all of them, most to foreclosure.\n\nEarlier, Serin had talked favorably about being homeless and living in a car and said his wife was holding him back. After signing the contract, he generally refrained from discussing family members, though his brother Steve did berate him publicly for his antics and not supporting his wife.\n\nAnti-Serin sites expressed dismay at the apparent end of iamfacingforeclosure.com, comparing Serin-watching to a form of drug addiction.

His story was featured in numerous media outlets\u2014among them, USA Today, National Public Radio, New York magazine, the San Francisco Chronicle, The Economist, The Suze Orman Show, and ABC's Nightline. When Serin first started the blog, commenters were generally supportive, hoping that Serin would make a good faith effort to avoid foreclosure and pay back any remaining debts by looking for work. The initial media exposure largely lauded Serin as an example of forthright blogging, without delving very deeply into the origin of his debts. Also, in 2006 Casey Serin appeared on \"Rich Dad's Online Business School\" where Casey Serin told his story to Robert Kiyosaki and the members of his audience.\n\nDuring the ensuing 9 months that the blog was updated, Serin generally let his problems stagnate\u2014urgent mail went unopened, the houses went into foreclosure one by one, and Serin did not actively look for work. The overall tone of the blog's comments gradually went from encouraging Serin to openly deriding him for his inaction, his apparent nonchalant attitude towards his financial issues, and his role in the then-emerging subprime mortgage crisis. In May 2007, CNET.com writer Declan McCullagh published an article about Serin's story and the largely negative reactions Serin's blog was garnering from commenters, referring to Serin as \"the world's most hated blogger\" and describing his blog as \"irritainment.\" McCullagh wrote that \"Casey's blog has an enthusiastic \u2013 if unrelentingly critical \u2013 audience known as 'haterz'.\" Serin acknowledged that he began to purposely anger readers in an effort to drive further traffic to the blog. In time, the blog developed a cult status, as Serin began writing about the toll his actions were taking on his personal life. The spectre of legal ramifications also factored heavily into the blog. Many commenters stated that they were attracted to the increasingly \"soap opera\"-like nature of Serin's story, and the blog was featured on a number of sites devoted to so-called \"trainwreck watching.\""}, {"url": "https://www.prweb.com/releases/2006/10/prweb467291.htm", "page_content": "Casey Serin has become the media poster child for the American housing bubble as it deflates. The one-time investor has five properties facing foreclosure in four different states and decided to blog about it at http://www.iamfacingforeclosure.com. Meanwhile, he has created a large following of critics and supporters and his tale of woe has been publicized nationally by USA Today and NPR. Nigel Swaby, a licensed mortgage broker and industry writer, has picked up the story on his blog http://www.slcrealestate.blogspot.com and has released a serialized version of his interview with Mr. Serin.\n\n\"I saw Casey's story out there in the first weeks of September and made a couple of advisory posts,\" Swaby commented. With house prices declining, the media turned its focus to bubble talk and Casey soon became the poster child of what not to do. \"As I kept reading his story, I realized he's very intelligent and pretty shrewd about reaching his goal of avoiding foreclosure,\" Swaby added. When mainstream media stories hit in October, their slant on Casey's situation was primarily negative. Swaby continued, \"I wanted to give Casey a fair shake and write objectively about his investments, his marketing abilities with the blog and his future plans.\"\n\nNigel Swaby's Salt Lake Real Estate blog is new on the web, but has steadily gained a readership of several thousand visitors per month. The focus of the blog is mainly real estate and mortgage news with plenty of tips for investors and first time homebuyers.

Along the way, he's lost all of them, run up some $170,000 in credit card and credit line debt, and launched iamfacingforeclosure.com to share his woes with the world. (Editor's note: Serin's site was intermittently reachable Monday.)\n\nFinancial exhibitionism, coupled with a lack of penitence for stiffing his creditors, has transformed the 24-year-old resident of this sleepy Sacramento suburb into a celebrity among fellow bloggers. But unlike other online celebrities, Serin's stardom comes from a unique source: \"haters\" who patronize his blog solely to learn what financial missteps he's made today.\n\n\"A community formed overnight,\" Serin said in an interview. \"It wasn't a very positive community.\"\n\nSince launching his Web site last September, Serin has discovered that it can be profitable to outrage and annoy the thousands of people who visit his blog every day. He estimates he was making up to $1,000 a month through Google ads and believes he's on track to make even more through Yahoo's ad network. His notoriety has led to appearances on Suze Orman's and Robert Kiyosaki's advice shows, and he says he's working on a book and advice packet that he'll sell online.\n\nThrough planning or dumb luck, Serin has managed to capture an audience by severely irritating many disparate groups: those who blame him and fellow speculators for the housing bubble; devout Christians, who urge him to follow the Bible more closely; and others who are hoping for news that his creditors are suing him and that his petite, attractive wife Galina is divorcing him.\n\nSerin makes it all public, including financial spreadsheets and bank statements, frank admissions that he lied on mortgage applications, and, more recently, his marital strife with Galina. Because her husband has refused to get a job since January 2006, the couple has been forced to move in with relatives and Galina cleans houses to pay for their food and rent.\n\nAs a result, the tell-all blog entries have drawn the same kind of highly attentive crowd that might assemble to watch a train wreck in progress. \"I guess I'm an open, kind of exhibitionist personality,\" Serin said.\n\nHis legions of critics use less flattering terms. The HousingPanic blog calls Serin \"the physical representation of fraud, greed, debt, fear, bubbles and human folly.\" Another says Serin is \"slothful, arrogant, unable to plan, unable to make decisions, easily overwhelmed.\"\n\nHating Serin has become something of a sport among bloggers, who compete with each other to post the most biting critiques of his financial missteps. No fewer than four Serin-hating sites have cropped up, and many others poke fun at how he paid tens of thousands of dollars for real-estate investing courses, ran up $2.2 million in debt by buying houses on credit, and then lost most of them to foreclosure (others were sold at a loss, and Serin estimates he owes an additional $100,000 to $250,000 to the banks to cover those losses).\n\nThere's even the sine qua non of a Net-celeb: a Casey Serin Dance Remix mocking his favorite sayings. Doctored photo galleries include images depicting Serin as, alternatively, Gilligan from Gilligan's Island , and McDonald's Hamburglar character. He's already been called a \"national obsession.\"\n\n\"Everyone has an opinion and anyone can speculate,\" said Rob Dawg, who runs a popular anti-Serin Web site called Exurbannation. \"Is he mentally ill? Mentally feeble? Do his bizarre personal habits affect his judgement or vice versa?\" Dawg wrote in e-mail on Friday. \"On and on. For many of us, however, Casey has become the eye of the storm, not the storm itself.\"\n\nSerin has not filed for bankruptcy, though he has publicly mulled the option. For now, he believes himself to be effectively judgment-proof, with his only significant asset being a run-down Volkswagen Jetta that recently was broken into.\n\nReaders who love to hate\n\nThe tension between Serin and his so-called haters has led to an unlikely situation: the very people who loathe him the most also rely on him for a daily source of entertainment.\n\nThe concept is sometimes called \"irritainment,\" defined as: \"Entertainment and media spectacles that are both annoying and compulsively watchable.\" (The O.J. Simpson trial in 1995 is the most famous example. Perez Hilton's blog may be another.)\n\nAgainst their better judgment, some haters have become financial supporters. In March, when Serin was facing a collection agency called CashCall, known for hardball tactics, Serin held a \"beg-a-thon\" trying to raise $220.48 by the next day.\n\nIt worked. Readers paid money to get him to answer personal questions, such as explaining why his wife dropped out of college. Someone even paid Serin $250 for the opportunity to rant to him for an hour about financial responsibility.\n\n\"I was amazed that the so-called haters were willing to spend money on me,\" Serin said. \"It shows that they're not really haters. They're in it for the entertainment.\"\n\nSome are. But others are honestly upset and view Serin as an exemplar of the worst of the housing bubble. Speculators who lied on loans, critics say, raised the cost of housing for honest buyers who needed a place to live, and foreclosures tend to reduce property values of nearby homes.\n\nOne common charge is that by lying on mortgage applications, Serin violated state and federal fraud laws. Serin uses the term \"my mortgage fraud.\" He also admits: \"I overstated my income, misrepresented owner occupancy intent and concealed the cash-back from the lenders.\"\n\nThat frank admission has led to calls to \"Send Casey Serin To Prison\"--a petition to the FBI has appeared--as well as a similar call targeting his wife.\n\n\"Casey and Galina Serin's story isn't one of 'Young couple tries to make it in the cold, cruel world,'\" one critic wrote. \"These two are f****g Bonnie and Clyde. What they're doing is bank robbery, without the gun.\"\n\nStephen Kodak, an FBI spokesman in Washington, said he could not comment on any individual case. \"Yes, it is a crime,\" he said. \"It's a crime to misrepresent your salary. It's a crime to misrepresent whether or not you're going to live in the house.\"\n\nIn March, the FBI announced a crackdown on mortgage scammers and said it has more than 1,000 current investigations. But Kodak said the FBI tends to focus on financial insiders and not people who lie on loans: \"We go after, normally, the fraud for profit, because even though it doesn't make up the majority of the numbers out there, it certainly makes up the largest financial losses.\"\n\nMarital drama, debt addiction\n\nOne wildcard in the Casey Serin saga is his wife, Galina, who met him through church social groups and married him when she was 20 years old. Both are Baptists and Slavic immigrants (Galina immigrated to the U.S. in 1990, and her husband in 1994) and are part of Sacramento's growing Russian-speaking population.\n\nIn a conversation at her sister's townhouse Thursday, where the young couple rents two rooms for about $600 a month, Galina said she was becoming frustrated with her husband's spending and had met with her pastor that afternoon for counseling. But according to her own religious views, Galina said, \"there are only two reasons for a divorce: adultery and physical abuse.\"\n\nRunning up $170,000 in unsecured debt, in other words, does not qualify--nor does lying about his plans regarding a recent vacation in Lake Tahoe, Calif., nor buying a $600 video camera on credit to document life experiences for his blog.\n\nFor his part, Serin confirms that his wife hates his blog. \"Many times she's like: I want you to shut it down and go quietly into the night,\" he said.\n\nThe so-called haters have similar sore points, including that Serin refuses to get a job and instead pays for living expenses by simply borrowing more money. He defends himself by insisting that he's making far more valuable connections through his blog.\n\nOne example he gave is that he learned, through his blog, of a $1.5 billion Las Vegas casino for sale. If he can find a buyer, Serin says, he'd get a 1 percent commission ($15 million) for his trouble. \"Doesn't that make more sense than a W-2 job?\" he said.\n\nSerin also recently paid $16,000 to Arizona's Nouveau Riche University, a kind of real-estate seminar company that includes classes with names like Fix & Flip and Creative Financing. Its marketing literature says that Nouveau Riche \"hand delivers properties on a silver platter.\"\n\nNouveau Riche, which is not accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (the regional group recognized by the U.S. Department of Education), claims not to be a multilevel marketing scheme. It has some elements of one, however. Serin said he has found two people to pay $18,000 to Nouveau Riche, and if he finds any more, he'll get a $9,000 commission for each one, as well as additional commissions if the people he recruited then sign up additional customers.\n\nIn an e-mail message over the weekend, Serin added: \"The 16K gives me two years of quality (real estate investment) education--gives you college credits--access to cash-flow properties around the nation, local community of investors, etc.\"\n\nNot all these details have appeared on his blog yet, but Serin seems to enjoy spacing them out in a way that will vex his readers the most. \"What happens is I feed off of it,\" he said. \"I know the buttons to press to get those guys going. After awhile, you learn what topics you can mention if you want to get extra comments on your post.\"\n\nSerin already does that by stressing his penchant for afternoon naps that take place precisely when his readers are reading his blog in their cubicles and silently fuming. He claims to have bought more than $4,000 in penny stocks last month, which have since slid in value. And he delights in posting about his excursions to a nearby Jamba Juice, which became notorious when he bought a $4.90 drink there with an ATM card but was charged an extra $33 overdraft fee because his bank account was empty.\n\nDuring a visit to the same Jamba Juice on Thursday, Serin asked the cashier whether any jobs were available. But, thinking of how much time he spends every day working on his blog, he added: \"Can I keep my laptop back there while I'm at work?\"\n\nHe left without taking an application.\n\nCNET News.com's Anne Broache contributed to this report"}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Casey-Serin", "page_content": "Casey Konstantin Serin (born September 10, 1982, legally renamed Casey Constantine in April 2016) is an Uzbekistan-born American blogger and a former real estate investor. In a newspaper article, USA Today called him the \"poster child for everything that went wrong in the real estate boom\". Born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, Serin immigrated to the United States in 1994. After graduating from high school, Serin bounced from job to job, generally working in website design. However, in his early twenties, Serin decided to quit working full-time in order to pursue a career in house flipping as a means of earning an income and building wealth. In an eight-month period beginning in October 2005, Serin purchased eight houses in four southwest U.S. states, and then began blogging about the foreclosure process on the properties he was unable to resell. In time, five of the eight properties foreclosed. The dubious nature of Serin's real estate transactions, coupled with his subsequent blogging about the affair, have led to Serin's name becoming strongly associated with the subprime mortgage crisis.\n\nBackground\n\nBetween October 2005 and May 2006, Serin purchased eight single-family homes using stated income loans. These loans required no documentation of income, nor any down payments. Before quitting his web design position in January 2006, Serin claimed an over-inflated income (roughly five times his actual pay) on his loan applications, reasoning that many other borrowers were using similar strategies to obtain mortgages for which they would not otherwise qualify. He continued to claim the same income on loan applications completed after he had quit his job. Serin stated that several of the properties were purchased with owner-occupied loans; these generally provide more favorable terms than loans for investment properties. A Voice of San Diego article suggests that Serin's initial loans may not have appeared in credit reports pulled for subsequent loans because he purchased properties in several states over a relatively brief period, so that \"the banks couldn't trace the pending loan documents to check up on his story.\"\n\nSerin received cash back at closing on six of the properties, sometimes exceeding California's legal maximum of three percent of the selling price. A contributor to the Scotsman Guide, a trade publication for the mortgage industry, stated in an article discussing fraudulent practices within the mortgage industry, that the largest amount of cash Serin received for a transaction was $50,000, and that the money was paid either to the seller or a third-party company (which the contributor alleges was bogus), and then returned to Serin after closing. The author, CEO and senior legal counsel of Investors Mortgage Asset Recovery Co. LLC, concludes that responsibility for fraud in cases such as Serin's lies with \"everyone who knew about the undisclosed cash and knowingly assisted in the scheme, including the sellers and any real estate agents, appraisers or closing agents.\" Serin disclosed on a Sacramento news program that he likely would not have been able to qualify for loans under more traditional terms.\n\nDespite already being deeply in debt, in late 2006, Serin borrowed $16,000 to purchase a week-long real estate seminar course purporting to teach \"creative financing\" at Nouveau Riche University (NRU) in Phoenix. Jim Piccolo, the founder of NRU, was later fined a record $6 million in 2011 by the Arizona Corporation Commission for running a fraudulent real estate investment scheme.\n\nMonths later, as the United States housing bubble began to rapidly deflate, Serin became unable to pay the mortgages or sell the properties; at one point, he estimated that he was approximately $2.2 million in debt, with a net worth around negative $600,000. Serin's house buying spree ultimately ended when a lender rejected a loan application for what would have been his ninth property, after discovering his blog. Because of the sheer magnitude of Serin's debt and the improbability of his story, some observers had initially questioned its veracity, alleging that the blog was either performance art or a viral marketing campaign. An article at The Motley Fool expressed doubt over \"whether or not this [isn't] just a somewhat elaborate hoax.\". However, public records confirm that Serin did purchase the properties in question and did subsequently default on most of the mortgages.\n\nForeclosure blog and media attention\n\nIn September 2006, Serin started the blog IamFacingForeclosure describing his situation, with the idea of both soliciting advice and warning others how to avoid the mistakes he had made. Interest in the blog first developed among readers of other blogs devoted to the United States housing bubble. His story was featured in numerous media outlets\u2014among them, USA Today, National Public Radio, New York magazine, the San Francisco Chronicle, The Economist, The Suze Orman Show, and ABC's Nightline. When Serin first started the blog, commenters were generally supportive, hoping that Serin would make a good faith effort to avoid foreclosure and pay back any remaining debts by looking for work. The initial media exposure largely lauded Serin as an example of forthright blogging, without delving very deeply into the origin of his debts. Also, in 2006 Casey Serin appeared on \"Rich Dad's Online Business School\" where Casey Serin told his story to Robert Kiyosaki and the members of his audience.\n\nDuring the ensuing 9 months that the blog was updated, Serin generally let his problems stagnate\u2014urgent mail went unopened, the houses went into foreclosure one by one, and Serin did not actively look for work. The overall tone of the blog's comments gradually went from encouraging Serin to openly deriding him for his inaction, his apparent nonchalant attitude towards his financial issues, and his role in the then-emerging subprime mortgage crisis. In May 2007, CNET.com writer Declan McCullagh published an article about Serin's story and the largely negative reactions Serin's blog was garnering from commenters, referring to Serin as \"the world's most hated blogger\" and describing his blog as \"irritainment.\" McCullagh wrote that \"Casey's blog has an enthusiastic \u2013 if unrelentingly critical \u2013 audience known as 'haterz'.\" Serin acknowledged that he began to purposely anger readers in an effort to drive further traffic to the blog. Over time, the blog developed a cult status, as Serin began writing about the toll his actions were taking on his personal life. The spectre of legal ramifications also factored heavily into the blog. Many commenters stated that they were attracted to the increasingly \"soap opera\"-like nature of Serin's story, and the blog was featured on a number of sites devoted to so-called \"trainwreck watching.\"\n\nFate of the blog\n\nIn April 2007, Serin appeared on The Suze Orman Show to discuss his financial predicament. Orman recommended that Serin file for bankruptcy and attempt to increase his take-home pay. However, Serin continued to make no effort to secure full-time employment, nor did he file bankruptcy; a bankruptcy attorney had told Serin that he would open himself to potential charges of mortgage fraud if he filed for bankruptcy, since the debts were acquired under fraudulent pretenses.\n\nThe final months of his blog saw further erratic behavior by Serin, including a June 2007 spur-of-the-moment flight to Australia without informing his wife or family members. Regarding his multiple mortgages, Serin acknowledged to the Sydney Morning Herald that \"the stuff I did is technically mortgage fraud, but it's not officially called that until someone prosecutes me and proves that that is indeed mortgage fraud,\" asserting a presumption of innocence. While in Australia, Casey Serin appeared on Top Shelf Radio with Robbie Buck. On the Jon Ronson show, Serin again confirmed his use of so-called \"liar loans\".\n\nOn July 11, 2007, Serin disclosed that he was under investigation by the FBI. In an interview conducted by ABC News, his attorney reported that Casey Serin was under investigation by the FBI, but that \"no charges have been brought against Mr. Serin. However, based upon conversations with the U.S. Attorney's office in California, federal charges related to Mr. Serin's real estate transactions are expected to be brought against him\". Shortly thereafter, Serin said in a mass e-mailing that he would be closing the blog and getting a \"regular W-2 job,\" citing the stress his family has experienced.\n\nSerin's final blog entry on July 28, 2007 was dedicated to his wife. Aaron Krowne, an Emory University library researcher and owner of ml-implode.com, purchased the blog. Serin says he used proceeds from the sale to pay off $35,000 of consumer credit debt in his wife's name.\n\nAlthough Serin retained an attorney in July 2007 and stated that he was under investigation by the FBI, Serin has never been officially charged with any crime.\n\nLegal change of name\n\nIn 2016, Serin legally changed his name to Casey Constantine. In Facebook comments, he stated that the name change is a sort of rebranding for the next chapter of his career/business in real estate, and that it will allow him much more control over his search results online, somewhat of a clean slate."}, {"url": "https://slopeofhope.com/2008/12/the-strange-tale-of-casey-serin.html", "page_content": "I've been wanting to do this post for many, many months, but I've always held back, because I didn't want to give the subject helpful publicity. But now that he's off the Internet (again), I feel OK proceeding.\n\nThis is about a young man named Casey Serin who lives in the Sacramento, California area. I first learned about him a little over two years ago when I was on a (rare) business trip and picked up the copy of USA Today sitting in front of my hotel room door. On the front page of the business section was a large photo of Casey with an article about his real estate activities.\n\nBy \"activities,\" I mean the purchase of over $2 million in various houses the then-24 year old individual with no meaningful income had purchased. In retrospect, the article about Casey was the most fantastic canary-in-a-coalmine story ever, because it showed how this completely unremarkable person was able to easily get loans (which he himself called \"liar's loans\") to buy properties, all with the hope of \"flipping\" them for a profit.\n\nNow, at this point, those of you familiar with Casey are probably interested that I'm even mentioning him (the rest of you are probably wondering where the charts are). The reason this is such an interesting topic to me is, one, how indicative Casey's experience was in the context of the \"Emperor has no clothes\" mentality of real estate investing during 2002-2006, and two, because of the astonishing subculture that grew up around Casey.\n\nOh, before I go any further, let me introduce you to the subject at hand (the lovely woman to the left is his wife, who divorced him following all the real estate insanity):\n\nThe USA Article described how his properties were in various states of foreclosure (or getting there). While he had obviously intended to make a lot of money (as he frequently referred to it, \"passive income\") off real estate, it wound up wiping out whatever money he did have, destroying his credit, and, in the end, destroying his marriage.\n\nWhen the article came out, Casey had started a web site called I Am Facing Foreclosure, which is where the entire subculture really began. His posts were mildly interesting, but the real action (sort of like Slope) was in the comments section. It didn't take long for an army of \"haterz\" to develop, and over the course of the next couple of years (and a few different blogs under different monikers), a bizarre and contentious relationship developed between Casey and his audience.\n\nThere are many, many blogs on the web about Casey's own blog (which has been shuttered\u2026\u2026\u2026again) but for me the crowning achievement in all of this is Caseypedia, which is a brilliant collection of over 700 (!) articles about everything imaginable regarding Casey Serin \u2013 from his car to his hair to the blue ball he used as a chair (which recently appeared for sale on eBay, in an attempt to squeeze a few dollars out of whatever notoriety might remain).\n\nFor me, Casey represents everything that was wrong about real estate \"investing\" in the recent era \u2013 \u2013 its laziness, overconfidence, and cluelessness. If nothing else, click on the Random Article link on Caseypedia a few times to get a sense of the place. It's brilliant, and my hat is off to its creators.\n\nOh, and good luck trading today.\n\nhttps://slopeofhope.com/2008/12/the-strange-tale-of-casey-serin.html\n\nThe Strange Tale of Casey Serin\n\nIn order to comment on this blog, you must have JavaScript installed and enabled."}, {"url": "https://lukeford.net/blog/?p=5388", "page_content": "From wikipedia:\n\nCasey Konstantin Serin (born September 10, 1982 in Tashkent, Uzbekistan) is a former real estate speculator and blogger.

If Robert Kiyosaki was the pin-up patriarch for the real estate boom, Casey must be the poster child for its fall.\n\n\"I've always been entrepreneurial,\" he said. \"I've had a business ever since we moved to the U.S.\" Serin, whose family emigrated from Uzbekistan to Sacramento when he was 12, exhibits the untarnished faith in American capitalism characteristic of some immigrants. When still a teenager he marketed his abilities as a Web designer, but over the years he chose real estate as his path to higher income. After spending a year and upward of $15,000 (borrowed on credit cards) going to real estate seminars and buying home education courses from everyone from Russ Whitney to Bruce Norris and, of course, the aforementioned Robert \"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\" Kiyosaki, Serin embarked on his brilliant career as a real estate flopper, er, flipper.\n\n\"I wanted to move toward financial independence,\" he told me by phone from his home in Sacramento, referring to \"passive income,\" a key tenet of the \"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\" scriptures (\"Don't work for money, allow money to work for you\").\n\nTaking a page from the no-money-down gurus he had already ruined his credit scores learning from, he didn't let the fact that he was under-employed with no financial assets slow him down. He bought one house at a discount and sold it for a profit of $30,000, which he used to wipe out his credit card debt and bring up his credit scores. The next house purchase wasn't quite so lucrative -- it had a negative cash flow, but this didn't dissuade him. In fact, the negative cash flow only convinced Serin to think he needed more investments \"to keep me busy with profit in the pipeline.\" In January 2005, he took a three-week leave from his job to get \"enough deals in contract\" so that he could give his employer two weeks' notice.\n\nAll proceeded according to plan. He quit his job and in the next four months he acquired six more properties. All in all, his portfolio included eight single-family homes, including two houses in Sacramento and one in Modesto, a seven-bedroom fixer-upper in Highland, Utah, a model home in Rio Rancho, N.M. and five-bedroom, four-bathroom ranch house in Dallas, Texas.\n\nBut (surprise, surprise) the profit didn't appear in the pipeline as planned. \"I didn't manage my cash flow and the market changed on me,\" he told me. \"I guess I didn't have enough exit strategies. \"\n\nHe managed to fix up two of the properties and sell them before the market slammed to a halt, but he found himself holding six houses with over $2.2 million in debt in a fast-declining market. Young, computer savvy, with the sense of full-disclosure masochism typical of our age, Serin didn't cut his losses, file for bankruptcy and get a job.\n\nHe started a blog.\n\nWhat does Serin tell us about his situation? Basically everything. The ins and outs of his deals, how much he paid, what went wrong and how he is now going begging to the banks for approval to do a short sale (to avoid foreclosure by selling the houses at less than the amount of the debt). He expresses worry about whether he will go to jail for mortgage fraud and posts the distress letters he's written to his lenders. He even explains his strategies for avoiding creditors' nagging phone calls.\n\nWhat Serin reveals about himself is that he's a sucker for every real estate myth that the industry has been feeding us for the past 10 years: that the market will always go up, that if you buy at a discount you're safe from financial risk, that gurus are doling out useful advice for the beginning real estate investor -- and that if you make enough deals, you're sure to come out ahead.\n\nBut he also exemplifies the way in which real estate has become a spin factory of hedging and hype. Serin bought eight houses in eight months in four states with no money down. How, pray tell, did he do this? By his own admission, he applied for and got no-money-down, stated-income loans by inflating his income, sometimes getting primary residence loan rates by claiming he would live in the houses himself. The offers, he said, often had \"cash back\" clauses, in which he would get money back from the seller after closing, which the bank didn't know about. (This means that a bank, thinking that the sale price was higher, was actually financing not 100 percent of the loan but, say, 110 percent.)\n\nIs it illegal, wrong and dunderheaded? You bet. Is it anomalous? Far from it.\n\nHis experience as a 23-year-old novice with no assets going out and getting not one but eight home loans in four different states shows just how eager the insiders have become to look the other way when things look fishy. Mortgage brokers are happily packaging applications filled with bogus information. Bank officers are allowing lending guidelines to become as flaccid as wet noodles. Too many real estate agents are willing to do anything to close a deal, and too many appraisers will pony up the numbers expected of them.\n\nMost pressingly, the use of liar loans -- once a tool for seasoned investors with high credit scores and low loan-to-value ratios -- has become epidemic. In 2005, Dominion Bond Rating Service reported that mortgages underwritten with minimal documentation sometimes account for as much as 50 percent of subprime (high-risk) mortgages. According to a new report by the Mortgage Asset Research Institute, almost 60 percent of the stated-income amounts are exaggerated by more than 50 percent. A 2004 MARI study maintained that a majority of FBI fraud-related cases on mortgage applications involved buyers lying on their loan applications about their income, their assets or their residency status. That's a whole lot of lying going on.\n\nOf course, the pundits of the blogosphere seized upon Serin like hyenas on fresh meat. Many of them are infuriated by the fact that he was unabashedly attempting to make big money in real estate by flipping properties. Others find it irritating that he keeps blogging instead of getting a job. But by offering himself up as a penitent whipping boy of real estate, Serin has unwittingly offered us a glimpse into the fast-approaching future in which those high-flying real estate trade secrets come home to roost.\n\nStill, he doesn't seem to see those birds crashing to the ground. Serin estimates that even if he can sell all of his properties with short sales, he'll still be $200,000 to $400,000 in debt. \"It's pretty scary,\" he concedes, sounding not at all scared. How will he escape? \"I could go back and get a job and just work for a living, but even if I get a Web designer position that pays $50,000 to $70,000 a year, my payments on my debt are still going to be $3,000 to $3,700 bucks a month. I could file for bankruptcy,\" he pauses. \"Or I could see if I can do a few more real estate deals.\"\n\nSuddenly his voice has the buoyancy of a true believer. \"To succeed in real estate you have to have the right knowledge and the ability to take action. I fell down this year. But I'm not going to go out without a fight.\"\n\nCarol Lloyd is currently at work on a book about Bay Area real estate.

Just better.\n\nCasey Konstantin Serin (born September 10, 1982, legally renamed Casey Constantine in April 2016) is an Uzbekistan-born American blogger, mortgage broker, and real estate investor. In a newspaper article, USA Today called him the \"poster child for everything that went wrong in the real estate boom\".[1] Born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, Serin immigrated to the United States in 1994. After graduating from high school, Serin bounced from job to job, generally working in website design. However, in his early twenties, Serin decided to quit working full-time in order to pursue a career in house flipping as a means of earning an income and building wealth. In an eight-month period beginning in October 2005, Serin purchased eight houses in four southwest U.S. states, and then began blogging about the foreclosure[2] process on the properties he was unable to resell. In time, five of the eight properties foreclosed.[3] The dubious nature of Serin's real estate transactions, coupled with his subsequent blogging about the affair, have led to Serin's name becoming strongly associated with the subprime mortgage crisis.\n\nYouTube Encyclopedic\n\n1 / 3 Views: 20 521 4 126 18 766\n\nLessons from Real Estate Millionaire Mogul\n\nReal Estate: Is It Really Your Best Investment?\n\nRich Dad poor dad (Momentis Opportunity) Transcription\n\nBackground\n\nBetween October 2005 and May 2006, Serin purchased eight single-family homes using stated income loans.[1][4] These loans required no documentation of income, nor any down payments. Before quitting his web design position in January 2006, Serin claimed an over-inflated income (roughly five times his actual pay) on his loan applications,[5] reasoning that many other borrowers were using similar strategies to obtain mortgages for which they would not otherwise qualify.[6][7] He continued to claim the same income on loan applications completed after he had quit his job. Serin stated that several of the properties were purchased with owner-occupied loans; these generally provide more favorable terms than loans for investment properties.[1] A Voice of San Diego article suggests that Serin's initial loans may not have appeared in credit reports pulled for subsequent loans because he purchased properties in several states over a relatively brief period, so that \"the banks couldn't trace the pending loan documents to check up on his story.\"[8]\n\nSerin received cash back at closing on six of the properties, sometimes exceeding California's legal maximum of three percent of the selling price. A contributor to the Scotsman Guide, a trade publication for the mortgage industry, stated in an article discussing fraudulent practices within the mortgage industry, that the largest amount of cash Serin received for a transaction was $50,000, and that the money was paid either to the seller or a third-party company (which the contributor alleges was bogus), and then returned to Serin after closing. The author, CEO and senior legal counsel of Investors Mortgage Asset Recovery Co. LLC, concludes that responsibility for fraud in cases such as Serin's lies with \"everyone who knew about the undisclosed cash and knowingly assisted in the scheme, including the sellers and any real estate agents, appraisers or closing agents.\"[9] Serin disclosed on a Sacramento news program that he likely would not have been able to qualify for loans under more traditional terms.[10]\n\nDespite already being deeply in debt, in late 2006, Serin borrowed $16,000 to purchase a week-long real estate seminar course purporting to teach \"creative financing\"[11] at Nouveau Riche University (NRU) in Phoenix.[12] Jim Piccolo, the founder of NRU, was later fined a record $6 million in 2011 by the Arizona Corporation Commission for running a fraudulent real estate investment scheme.[13]\n\nMonths later, as the United States housing bubble began to rapidly deflate, Serin became unable to pay the mortgages or sell the properties; at one point, he estimated that he was approximately $2.2 million in debt, with a net worth around negative $600,000.[4] Serin's house buying spree ultimately ended when a lender rejected a loan application for what would have been his ninth property, after discovering his blog.[14] Because of the sheer magnitude of Serin's debt and the improbability of his story, some observers had initially questioned its veracity, alleging that the blog was either performance art or a viral marketing campaign. An article at The Motley Fool expressed doubt over \"whether or not this [isn't] just a somewhat elaborate hoax.\".[15] However, public records confirm that Serin did purchase the properties in question and did subsequently default on most of the mortgages.\n\nForeclosure blog and media attention\n\nIn September 2006, Serin started the blog IamFacingForeclosure describing his situation, with the idea of both soliciting advise and warning others how to avoid the mistakes he had made. Interest in the blog first developed among readers of other blogs devoted to the United States housing bubble.[16] His story was featured in numerous media outlets\u2014among them, USA Today,[1] National Public Radio,[17] New York magazine,[18] the San Francisco Chronicle,[19] The Economist,[6] The Suze Orman Show,[20][21] and ABC's Nightline.[4] When Serin first started the blog, commenters were generally supportive, hoping that Serin would make a good faith effort to avoid foreclosure and pay back any remaining debts by looking for work. The initial media exposure largely lauded Serin as an example of forthright blogging, without delving very deeply into the origin of his debts. Also, in 2006 Casey Serin appeared on \"Rich Dad's Online Business School\" where Casey Serin told his story to Robert Kiyosaki and the members of his audience.\n\nDuring the ensuing 9 months that the blog was updated, Serin generally let his problems stagnate\u2014urgent mail went unopened, the houses went into foreclosure one by one, and Serin did not actively look for work. The overall tone of the blog's comments gradually went from encouraging Serin to openly deriding him for his inaction, his apparent nonchalant attitude towards his financial issues, and his role in the then-emerging subprime mortgage crisis. In May 2007, CNET.com writer Declan McCullagh published an article about Serin's story and the largely negative reactions Serin's blog was garnering from commenters, referring to Serin as \"the world's most hated blogger\" and describing his blog as \"irritainment.\"[22] McCullagh wrote that \"Casey's blog has an enthusiastic \u2013 if unrelentingly critical \u2013 audience known as 'haterz'.\" Serin acknowledged that he began to purposely anger readers in an effort to drive further traffic to the blog.[23]\n\nFate of the blog\n\nIn April 2007, Serin appeared on The Suze Orman Show to discuss his financial predicament. Orman recommended that Serin file for bankruptcy and attempt to increase his take-home pay.[20]\n\nThe final months of his blog saw further erratic behavior by Serin, including a June 2007 spur-of-the-moment flight to Australia without informing his wife or family members.[24][25] Regarding his multiple mortgages, Serin acknowledged to the Sydney Morning Herald that \"the stuff I did is technically mortgage fraud, but it's not officially called that until someone prosecutes me and proves that that is indeed mortgage fraud,\"[26] asserting a presumption of innocence. While in Australia, Casey Serin appeared on Top Shelf Radio with Robbie Buck.[27] On the Jon Ronson show, Serin again confirmed his use of so-called \"liar loans\".[28]\n\nOn July 11, 2007, Serin disclosed that he was under investigation by the FBI. In an interview conducted by ABC News, his attorney reported that Casey Serin was under investigation by the FBI, but that \"no charges have been brought against Mr. Serin. However, based upon conversations with the U.S. Attorney's office in California, federal charges related to Mr. Serin's real estate transactions are expected to be brought against him\".[29] Shortly thereafter, Serin said in a mass e-mailing that he would be closing the blog and getting a \"regular W-2 job,\" citing the stress his family has experienced.[30]\n\nReturn to real estate\n\nIn 2016, Serin legally changed his name to Casey Constantine. In Facebook comments, he stated that the name change is a sort of rebranding for the next chapter of his career/business in real estate, and that it will allow him much more control over his search results online, somewhat of a clean slate.[31] After the name change, Casey became a licensed Real Estate Broker and Mortgage Loan Originator. He has resumed investing.[32][33][34]\n\nReferences"}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/casey-serin", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nCasey Serin was born on 10 September, 1982 in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, is a Former real estate investor.
