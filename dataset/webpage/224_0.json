{"NoFX is an American punk rock band from Los Angeles, California.": [{"url": "https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2022-09-02/nofx-breakup-in-2023-after-40-years", "page_content": "NOFX, the Los Angeles punk band known for \u201cLinoleum\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Call Me White,\u201d will be no more in 2023.\n\nOn Wednesday, frontman Fat Mike casually dropped the news in the comments section of a post on his Instagram page. A frustrated fan asked the singer-bassist why NOFX \u201cbarely\u201d performs in Canada. The fan received a response, but it probably wasn\u2019t the one expected.\n\n\u201cActually, We love Canada, it\u2019s just that next year will be our last year,\u201d Fat Mike, whose real name is Michael John Burkett, replied. \u201cWe will be announcing our final shows soon. It\u2019s been an amazing run.\u201d\n\nThat run began nearly 40 years ago in 1983 with Fat Mike, guitarist Eric Melvin and drummer Erik Sandin as the founding members. In 1991, Aaron \u201cEl Hefe\u201d Abeyta joined the group as lead guitarist and trumpet player.\n\nMusic Punk, Politics and Platitudes From NOFX Musically, there isn\u2019t much that distinguishes L.A.\u2019s NOFX from countless other neo-punk outfits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResponding to a separate comment on his Instagram post, Fat Mike said, \u201cLos Angeles will be the last place we play. It\u2019s where we started, it\u2019s where we\u2019ll end.\u201d\n\nNOFX has yet to release an official statement on the impending breakup, but Rolling Stone confirmed the news.\n\nThe band released its first recording, \u201cThalidomide Child,\u201d in 1984 and dropped its first self-titled EP a year later.\n\nNOFX\u2019s debut album, \u201cLiberal Animation,\u201d arrived in 1988 and featured songs such as \u201cBeer Bong\u201d and \u201cShut Up Already.\u201d A sophomore album, \u201cS&M Airlines,\u201d was released in 1989.\n\nMusic Nose-Thumbers NOFX as Obnoxiously Fun as Ever Although MTV exposure virtually guarantees bands a certain amount of success, there is a small but exceptional network of (mostly punk) rock groups that shun the commercial machine and still manage to sell tons of records.\n\nIn the \u201990s, NOFX rose to popularity as part of a wave of California punk bands that included Green Day, the Offspring and Rancid. That decade proved to be a busy as NOFX released six albums including \u201cRibbed\u201d (1991), \u201cPunk in Drublic\u201d (1994) and \u201cHeavy Petting Zoo\u201d (1996).\n\n\u201cIts musicianship has improved since it formed in the mid-\u201980s, and despite singer-bassist Fat Mike\u2019s unremarkable voice, NOFX easily holds its own alongside such contemporaries as Green Day, the Offspring and Rancid,\u201d The Times wrote in February 1998.\n\nThe band\u2019s latest album was 2021\u2019s \u201cSingle Album,\u201d which came nearly five years after \u201cFirst Ditch Effort.\u201d\n\nSince May, NOFX has been making its way around Europe and North America as part of its Punk in Drublic festival. The band will next perform on Saturday at the Edmonton Expo Centre in Alberta, Canada."}, {"url": "https://www.songkick.com/artists/214756-nofx", "page_content": "In 1983 Mike Burkett (Fat Mike) and Eric Melvin met and started the band, and were later joined by Erik Sandin. The group released their first album in 1985 with Mystic Records. The band then underwent a lineup change, but through the changes, the original three members remained intact. In 1986 the band released an album attacking the PMRC (Parents Music Resource Center) for their campaign against music censorship with \u201cThe P.M.R.C Can Suck On This.\u201d Following this album was \u201cLiberal Animation\u201d in 1988, which was recorded with Bad Religion\u2019s Brett Gurewitz.\n\nThe collaboration with Gurewitz led to the band signing with Epitaph Records, and releasing their third studio album \u201cRibbed.\u201d Shortly after the release, Aaron Abeyta, aka El Hefe, replaced Steve Kidwiller on guitar, followed by \u201cWhite Trash, Two Heebs and A Bean\u201d being released in 1992. In 1994 they released their best selling album, \u201cPunk in Drublic\u201d and received support from the mainstream media, as well as reaching certified gold.\n\nFollowing a series of record releases that all fared well, the band made the move to sign with Fat Wreck Chords in 2005.

Vincent (45 or 46 Songs That Weren\u2019t Good Enough to Go on Our Other Records, 2002)\n\n\u201cI know they say this is their worst stuff, but to me it\u2019s some of their best. It shows a lot of the more human side of nofx that they show in their older stuff (before war on errorism) and the half-made \u201ccrap\u201d songs sometimes show the full potential of nofx for doing whatever the hell they want and making it look good anyway.\u201d\n\n11. All His Suits Are Torn (So Long and Thanks for All the Shoes, 1997)\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, this is one of NOFX\u2019s most eclectic albums because of the blend of blazing skate punk, the gentler punk rock songs edging on pop punk, and then the straight-up ska punk.\u201d\n\n10. 72 Hookers (Self / Entitled, 2012)\n\n\u201cLooking at the lyrics, this is a song about what motivates terrorists to do what they do. Looking deeper, it becomes a protest about why we should pity terrorists rather than just hate them. Fantastic guitar work; a fun, catchy tune and though provoking lyrics without being overly serious or maudlin.\u201d\n\n9. Happy Guy (Punk in Drublic, 1994)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I don\u2019t enjoy about the album but it\u2019s also not a record I admire or deeply love, it\u2019s what it is, one of the best skate punk albums, with lyrics that are just as dumb as the one on Smash, and vocals that I like even though they barely hit a right note.\u201d\n\nSee more: NOFX Albums Ranked\n\n8. The Brews (Punk in Drublic, 1994)\n\n\u201cPunk at its best. NOFX is true to the punk genre and The Brews is one of the best songs on this album.\u201d\n\n7. Seeing Double at the Triple Rock (Wolves in Wolves\u2019 Clothing, 2006)\n\n\u201cThe best fast song is Seeing Double At The Triple Rock which is just them doing what they\u2019ve always done well.\u201d\n\n6. Bath of Least Resistance (45 or 46 Songs That Weren\u2019t Good Enough to Go on Our Other Records, 2002)\n\n\u201cThis is one of those cd\u2019s that you can listen to over and over again and not get sick of it. it\u2019s catchy without being pop-ish. every song has intelligent lyrics and the instruments are\u2026 incredible. great cd overall. I can\u2019t tell you enough.\u201d\n\n5. Bob (White Trash, Two Heebs and a Bean, 1992)\n\n\u201cBob\u2019s a good song if you don\u2019t mind those stupid ska horns. That skinny dreadlocked dude rips on lead guitar and their drummer is pretty good too!\n\nSee more: Darius Rucker Albums Ranked\n\n4. Dinosaurs Will Die (Pump Up the Valuum, 2000)\n\n\u201cDinosaurs Will Die\u201d is arguably the third most offensive, insulting the five main US record companies and how they have followed the same \u2018tradition\u2019 of a seven-record deal, all seven records only having \u201cone good song.\u201d\n\n3. Franco Un-American (The War on Errorism, 2003)\n\n\u201cFranco Un-American\u201d is about being aware of the problems in the world. What makes this track stand out is the use of keyboards, and it sounds great.\u201d\n\n2. Linoleum (Punk in Drublic, 1994)\n\n\u201cAs soon as your needle drops, your immediately punched in the face by the roaring opening guitar riffs from linoleum, that sets the tone of the album as a exhilarating ride!!!\u201d\n\n1.

Click to experience the band at their finest!\n\n8. Wolves In Wolves\u2019 Clothing (2006)\n\n\u201cThere are some melodies on Wolves that I can hum along to. And after enough listens, I\u2019ll have the words in my head. And then one day I\u2019ll find myself humming a song or two, and I\u2019ll go back and listen to it. And that\u2019s good. Because in the end, it\u2019s just more NoFX, and that\u2019s really not all that bad of a thing.\u201d\n\n7. Ribbed (1991)\n\n\u201cThe opening three tracks (\u201cGreen Corn,\u201d \u201cThe Moron Brothers,\u201d and \u201cShowerdays\u201d) kick this record off ferociously and fearlessly\u2026 and if you don\u2019t love that blistering trio, you\u2019re very likely a weak excuse for a NOFX fan. Either that, or you\u2019re just too young to know any better. Beware, the opening riff of \u201cShowerdays\u201d will violate you like a tornado and is not for the common poppy-punky power-chord strumming Green Day fan. There is some really rippin\u2019 riffage all over this album.\u201d\n\n6. White Trash, Two Heebs And A Bean (1992)\n\n\u201d Every track is fantastic, and some of them are quite different. Hang on, I\u2019ve just realised, not EVERY song is fantastic \u2013 Buggly Eyes is a bit, well, stupid. The subject of the song is slightly funny the first time you hear it, but gets more ridiculous with every listen. Perhaps it would be bearable without the \u201cjazz voice\u201d? I really hate the jazz voice, which also pops up on Straight Edge.\u201d\n\nSee more: Boys Like Girls Albums Ranked\n\n5. Heavy Petting Zoo (1996)\n\n\u201cThis is melodic-punk that is so fashionable nowadays at its very best. All of the guys are talented musically (catch Fat Mike playing trumpet). These set of songs are among the longest the band ever put out. Most of them are clever and funny without resorting to dick jokes and other pieces of misogyny of commercial bands that NOFX paved the way for.\u201d\n\n4. Pump Up The Valuum (2000)\n\n\u201cSongs throughout are very listenable. If there\u2019s a weak point, it\u2019s that NOFX have passed their songwriting prime. The really fast punk songs tend to blend together lately, and some of the ones here sound like excerpts from \u201cThe Decline.\u201d But nothing is bad; there\u2019s less filler than on any of their previous albums except \u201cPunk in Drublic.\u201d\n\nSee more: Hinder Albums Ranked\n\n3. The War On Errorism (2003)\n\n\u201cNOFX has never failed to deliver a listenable album, and The War On Errorism is no exception. This is a pretty solid punk record with a few tracks that delve into the more experimental side of the genre. A lot of leftist politics, a good deal of the usual NOFX humor, and a collection of catchy songs.\u201d\n\n2. So Long And Thanks For All The Shoes (1997)\n\n\u201cThis is undoubtedly one of NOFX\u2019s best albums ever. It is very underrated and definitely deserves a spot on their top three best album put out to date. If you are a true and die hard NOFX fan, this album is a must have no questions asked. You won\u2019t regret getting it. It has some of the best songs ever made and pretty much every single song is very enjoyable and catchy.\u201d\n\n1.

Cause when morality's been blurred Procreation seems absurd And human rights and freedom are just words That have lost all their meaning In a world that is bleeding Like an animal in slaughter I hope that my daughters never know What it feels like to give up To know the whole world is corrupt To realize they are really on their own And there's no one left who cares About the future Infected cuts don't need a suture There's a feeling that the human race Has seen the checkered flag And the laps that are given Are the last ones ever driven And everyone who's still living knows that It's a shame that the earth Will live on but can't give birth To a baby planet where we could start over again We've been divided, we've been bled Like a chicken without a head Running frantically amuck Taking but not giving a f*ck History is just an alibi It's believing every lie Man has ever dared to write It's so much easier to see That complex reality A lifetime full of misery and blight So we tell our daughters and our sons That they're not the final ones To see this planet as a decent place to live We use our telescope To give them faith, to give them hope Anything to help them cope With their future cause there's no alternative Kings and queens rule the land There's more and more lines drawn in the sand Pawns are crooks, Castles are rooks It's too bad the good books Written for the sub-classes to introduce morality Had nothing to do with reality But then again, who would have ever read them? We read the par-Quran for lunch Eat old testaments for a snack And a little Lulla-bible before bed There's no more points of view when your only thought is food (It's sad I'm gonna see) The bible has been replaced with a survival guide (The end of history) That uses perishables instead of parables Because there's no stories left to preach (We don't wanna be) There's no life lessons is left to teach anyone, why bother? (The Generation Z) Who are we? Are we the intellects or the insects? We're not the ones who will ever know the answer (We don't wanna see) It's impossible for us to imagine what is right in front of us (A species you and me) I guess that's what makes us think we're human But being human only lets us see a little farther than animals (The end of history) Feel depression from spending most of your life working?
