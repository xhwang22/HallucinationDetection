{"John Joseph Hughes was appointed the first president of St. John's College in Fordham, New York in 1826.": [{"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/philosophy-and-religion/roman-catholic-and-orthodox-churches-general-biographies/john-joseph-hughes", "page_content": "HUGHES, JOHN JOSEPH\n\nFirst archbishop of New York; b. County Tyrone, Ireland, June 24, 1797; d. New York, N.Y., Jan. 3, 1864. John was the third of seven children of Patrick and Margaret (McKenna) Hughes, small farmers who avoided involvement in Ireland's political disturbances. John attended the local schools, and soon showed an interest in the priesthood. In 1816 the father and an older son immigrated to the U. S., sending for John the following year, and for the rest of the family in 1818. They settled in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, where John worked in the quarries, at mending roads, and as a gardener. He made several applications for admission to Mt. St. Mary's Seminary, Emmitsburg, Md., only to learn that there was no room. When, however, Rev. John dubois offered to take him as a gardener until a vacancy occurred, Hughes went to Mt. St. Mary's on Nov. 10, 1819, and a year later was received in the seminary. He was accepted by Bp. Henry conwell for the Diocese of phila delphia, Pa., and ordained in St. Joseph's Church, Philadelphia, on Oct. 15, 1826; arrangements were made for him to continue his studies under Michael Hurley, OSA, who was assigned to St. Augustine's parish in that city.\n\nCareer in Philadelphia. When Hughes arrived, the trustees of St. Mary's Cathedral were in open conflict with Conwell as a result of the Hogan schism, which dated from 1821. After about a year at St. Augustine's, where he had a chance to watch developments at St. Mary's, Hughes spent a few weeks as pastor of Bedford, Pa.; he was then recalled to Philadelphia to become, successively, pastor at St. Joseph's (January 1827) and at St. Mary's (April 1827). When the trustees of St. Mary's refused to pay his salary, he returned in July to St. Joseph's, where he remained until St. John's Church was built and dedicated in April 1832. The new church had no lay incorporators and Hughes administered his parish with a firm hand.\n\nAlthough highly successful in his pastoral activities, he attracted more attention by his controversial writings and speeches. His first published sermon, which enhanced his reputation as a preacher, was on Catholic emancipation, then recently granted in Ireland, and was dedicated to Daniel O'Connell, whom he greatly admired. Anti-Catholicism, then strong in Philadelphia, was expressed freely in sermons, lectures, and the bitterly polemical Protestant weeklies. There was no Catholic paper, since many Catholics, including Bp. Francis Kenrick, who had been appointed coadjutor with full jurisdiction in 1830, thought the best policy was to suffer in silence. Hughes, on the contrary, believed in a vigorous defense. He founded the Catholic Herald, a newspaper that he later turned over to the diocese. Earlier he had established a Catholic Tract Society to distribute free pamphlets. In 1830, using the pseudonym \"Cranmer,\" he wrote letters to the Protestant, a New York weekly specializing in anti-Catholic propaganda. When, however, his wildly improbable accounts of Catholic plots and progress failed to strain the credulity of the editors and readers, he exposed the hoax. His best known controversy in Philadelphia was with Dr. John Breckinridge, a Presbyterian clergyman, with whom he debated in writing (1833) and orally (1835) on the Rule of Faith, and Catholicism as an obstacle to civil and religious liberty.\n\nHughes did not overestimate the value of controversy, but used it to make the enemies of the Church more cautious and to raise the morale of the sorely tried Catholic masses. His talents and his achievements attracted attention, and his promotion to the episcopate was generally expected. He had been recommended as coadjutor of Philadelphia by Conwell in 1829, and for Cincinnati in 1833. In 1836 the Holy See designated Hughes as coadjutor of Philadelphia and Kenrick as bishop of a new see to be erected at Pittsburgh, but Gregory XVI delayed formal approval. In 1837 when the Third Provincial Council of Baltimore asked that the division of Philadelphia be postponed, Hughes was preconized titular bishop of Basileopolis and coadjutor, with the right of succession, of New York. He was consecrated there on Jan. 7, 1838, in old St. Patrick's Cathedral.\n\nNew York. The diocese then consisted of all of New York State and about one-half of New Jersey, an area of about 55,000 square miles. Hughes found 22 churches, 10 of which had been erected in 1837, and 40 priests, to serve the needs of 200,000 Catholics, in a total population of about 2,700,000. The Emmitsburg Sisters of Charity were the only religious community in the diocese. Seven parochial schools, all in New York City, and four orphan asylums, two of which were in the city, made up the total of Catholic charitable and educational institutions. The population of the U.S. was increasing rapidly; in New York City the increase was five times the national rate. Moreover, the churches of the city were burdened with a heavy debt, $300,000. When, in January 1838, Dubois suffered a stroke, responsibilty for the diocese devolved upon Hughes, who was named apostolic administrator in August 1839 and succeeded to the see on Dec. 20, 1842. He became archbishop of New York on July 19, 1850, when it was made an archdiocese.\n\nHughes's authority was challenged in February 1839, when the cathedral trustees had a catechist appointed by Dubois ejected from the Sunday school by the police. A pastoral, written by Hughes and signed by Dubois, threatened the parishoners with an interdict unless they repudiated the trustees. This was done promptly, at a meeting summoned, addressed, and presided over, by Hughes. Except for the parish of St. Louis in Buffalo, where the trustees held out for years, New York had no further difficulty with trusteeism.\n\nAfter a preliminary visitation of the diocese, Hughes went to Europe in October 1839, seeking aid in Paris, Rome, Munich, Vienna, and Dublin. On his return in 1840, he engaged in his greatest contest over the question of religion and the public schools. The Public School Society, a private organization, practically monopolized public funds for education in New York City from 1825 to 1840. Professedly nonsectarian, it provided religious training that was offensive to Catholics, who wanted state aid for denominational schools and a proportionate share of public funds. Governor William Seward agreed with the Catholics, but the city aldermen and the state legislature were hostile. The resultant controversy, which destroyed the Public School Society, led to two quite unexpected developments\u2014the total secularization of U.S. public education on all levels, and the creation of the parochial school system in the U. S.\n\nThe growth of political nativism had led, in 1844, to the burning of Catholic churches and widespread riots in Philadelphia. Hughes's success in arousing his people to defend the churches against mob violence, while exhorting them to give no provocation, prevented similar disorders in New York. His firm stand on this and on the school question made him known throughout the country. Although attacked and misrepresented in the press, he was, nevertheless, highly respected in both Catholic and non-Catholic circles.\n\nHis achievements in the diocese included the erection of four new sees; the beginning of the new St. Patrick's Cathedral; the founding of a seminary, and of a college at Fordham, New York City, which he later transferred to the Jesuits; the introduction of many religions communities; and the development of charitable and educational works. He was instrumental in separating a group of Sisters of Charity from Emmitsburg, Md., thus founding the independent Mt. St. Vincent community in New York City.\n\nNational and International Affairs. Hughes was a vigorous defender of the temporal power of the pope, and sponsored more than one special collection to help Pius IX. He took a leading part in the founding of the North American College at Rome in 1859. Thoroughly unsym-pathetic to the abolitionist movement in the U. S., he believed that sudden emancipation would injure the slaves. He opposed plans to settle Irish immigrants on farm lands in the West, fearing they would be lost to the Church because of the shortage of priests. Although he endorsed Irish nationalism, he disapproved of risings that he thought could not succeed, and condemned Irish antislavery sentiment as an intrusion into U. S. politics. Because he was convinced of the basic harmony between American political institutions and Catholicism, he urged Catholic support of the U. S. Constitution and was friendly with officials of the national government. When President James Polk tried to send him to Mexico in 1847, he refused the mission because of its unofficial character. A visit to Europe in support of the Union, 1861\u201362, was undertaken at the request of President Lincoln and Secretary Seward. He was recommended to Rome for the red hat by Lincoln's government; when no action was taken, some believed the time was not ripe for an American cardinal, while others thought Hughes was not the best choice. His last public appearance was made in July 1863, at the request of New York Gov. Horatio Seymour, who was attempting to stop the draft riots that were then occurring in the City of New York.\n\nCharacter and Personality. Archbishop Hughes was a born leader and fighter. Prompt and vigorous in action, and unyielding in conflict, he believed he had the duty and the ability to lead and defend his people, and to prove that American Catholics were not second-class citizens. If he was autocratic and at times fought harder than was necessary, he merely displayed the defects of his virtues.\n\nAlthough Hughes became increasingly intolerant of disagreement, he nevertheless rendered valuable service to both Church and country. As his successor, Abp. John McCloskey, said: \"\u2026 if ever there was a man who in the whole history and character of his life impressed upon us the sense and conviction that he had been raised up by God, was chosen as His instrument to do an appointed work \u2026 that man was Archbishop Hughes.\" Hughes died of Bright's disease, after a long illness, and was buried in the old cathedral. His remains were translated to the new St. Patrick's Cathedral in 1883.\n\nBibliography: Complete Works, comp. and ed. l. kehoe, 2v.

Our University Church is on the far left in the background, and Cunniffe House on the right.\n\nThe origins of Fordham University can be traced to 1839 when John Hughes, the Bishop of New York, bought 100 acres at Rose Hill in the Fordham section of what was then Westchester County for $29,750. However, he said, \"I had not, when I purchased the site of this new college...so much as a penny to commence the payment for it.\" After a nine-month campaign the most money he could raise locally was $10,000, and so he went to Europe on a begging trip to get the funds that he could not raise at home.\n\nThe financial difficulties that John Hughes faced in starting St. John's College are indicative of the poverty of the New York Catholic community in 1841. It took a brave man to start a college under such circumstances, but Hughes, an Irish immigrant himself, saw education as the indispensable means for his immigrant flock to break out of the cycle of poverty and better themselves economically and socially in their adopted homeland. \"The subject that of all others that he had nearest his heart was education,\" said John Hassard, an early graduate of St. John's College and Hughes's first biographer.\n\nSt. John's College opened its doors in 1841 as a diocesan institution with a grand total of six students. If money was a problem, an even bigger problem was finding capable teachers and administrators among the diocesan clergy. During its first five years as a diocesan institution, Fordham had no fewer than four presidents. Two went on to fame and glory. The first president was John McCloskey, who succeeded Hughes as the second archbishop of New York in 1864 and became the first American cardinal in1875; James Roosevelt Bayley, the last diocesan priest to head the institution, was a convert from a distinguished New York Episcopalian family who became the first bishop of Newark and later the archbishop of Baltimore. However, diocesan clergy of such caliber were the exception rather than the rule in New York.\n\nThe Coming of the Jesuits\n\nFor both financial and personnel reasons, in 1846 Bishop Hughes was happy to sell St. John's College to a religious order with an international reputation as professional educators. The presence of the Society of Jesus in the United States dates from the establishment of the Maryland colony in 1634. However, the Jesuits who arrived at Rose Hill in 1846 were not Maryland Jesuits, but exiled French Jesuits who were conducting a faltering college in the wilderness of Kentucky. They were delighted to move from frontier America (where it was necessary to place spittoons even in the college chapel) to a site only seven miles from the largest city in the United States, and Hughes was pleased to obtain their services. It seemed to be mutually advantageous for both sides, although there were to be a number of difficult moments for the Jesuits as long as John Hughes was alive.\n\nArchbishop Hughes welcomed Jesuits to campus in 1846.\n\nThroughout the later nineteenth century St. John's College remained a small liberal arts college, which was overshadowed by its upstart rival, the Jesuit College of St. Francis Xavier on West 16th Street, which developed into the third largest Jesuit college in the United States and Canada. At St. John\u2019s there was little change in either the size of the enrollment or the curriculum or the daily routine of the students over the course of the first seventy years. As late as 1907 Archbishop John Hughes would have recognized it immediately as the diocesan college that he had founded in 1841. In fact, there was at least one alumnus still alive who had graduated before John Hughes sold the school to the Jesuits in 1846.\n\nIn 1907, the year that Francis J. Spellman, the future Cardinal Archbishop of New York, arrived at Rose hill as a first year, St. John's College was still a small school with only 109 students. They were roused from sleep at 6 a.m., attended daily Mass at 7 a.m., were back in their rooms by 7 p.m., and were expected to be in bed by 9 p.m. In Spellman's graduation class of 1911, there were twenty-eight students, equally divided into fourteen boarders and fourteen commuters. The entire teaching staff consisted of twelve Jesuits, ten priests and two scholastics. They had no problem teaching elective courses because they did not offer any elective courses. The standard curriculum was a classical course with heavy emphasis on Latin and Greek leading to an AB degree. The tuition, including room and board, was $200 per semester.\n\nFrom College to University\n\nIn 1904, three years before Spellman\u2019s arrival at Rose Hill, the president, Father John J. Collins, SJ, announced that St. John's College would become a university, but the transition from St. John's College to Fordham University was a gradual process, spread over several decades, with a number of setbacks and false starts. The process began in 1905 with the opening of the first two graduate schools. The first graduate school, the Medical School, lasted only sixteen years and was discontinued in 1921 due largely but not solely to financial reasons. However, the second graduate school, the Law School, flourished from the beginning despite a nomadic existence that necessitated four changes of location in the first ten years.\n\nSeven Blocks of Granite in 1936\n\nIn the fifteen years between 1905 and 1920 Fordham gradually assumed the dimensions of a genuine university with the establishment of a College of Pharmacy (which closed in 1971) and at least the foundations of seven graduate schools, not only in medicine and law, but also the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of Social Service, the Graduate School of Education, and the Graduate School of Business Administration (now the Gabelli School of Business). The final component, the Graduate School of Religion and Religious Education, was added in 1975.\n\nHowever, it was one thing to change the name of St. John's College to that of Fordham University. It was quite another thing to transform a small men's college into a full-fledged university. The process of change was often difficult, hampered by the lack of endowment, the lack of library and laboratory facilities, the lack of a wealthy and generous alumni, and the heavy teaching load of the faculty, which made it difficult for them to engage in the creative scholarship that a modern university demands of its professors.\n\nIt is difficult to avoid the impression that Fordham grew too quickly, even recklessly, in its quest to become a university. In the late 1920s Fordham became something of a graduate diploma mill, conferring more master\u2019s and doctoral degrees than any other Catholic university in the country despite the fact that eighty percent of the 600 graduate students were part-time students and the library facilities were scandalously inadequate. In 1935 disaster struck when the Association of American Universities dropped Fordham from its list of approved institutions. \"It was,\" said Father Robert I. Gannon, SJ, \"one of the darkest single days\u201d in Fordham's history.\n\nIn 1938, Victor Hess, the Nobel Prize in Physics winner for his discovery of cosmic rays, escaped Nazi persecution and found a professional home at Rose Hill.\n\nIn 1936 Father Gannon was brought in from St. Peter's College in Jersey City to repair the damage and rebuild Fordham. He has a good claim to be regarded as the first modern president of Fordham University. His twenty-six predecessors had served an average of four years. Gannon remained as president for thirteen years, from 1936 to 1949, guiding the university through the lean years of the Depression and World War II, and overseeing the rapid expansion in the post-war years. He rebuilt the university's shattered academic reputation, curtailed the football program to the delight of some and the outrage of others, and gave Fordham its own radio station. He also separated the office of the rector of the Jesuit community from that of the university president, became an indefatigable fundraiser, and gave Fordham high visibility in New York City through his frequent appearances and speeches at public events. He was the first president of Fordham University to become a well-known figure in New York City.\n\nThe Lincoln Center Campus\n\nA major milestone in the development of Fordham University took place with the establishment of the Lincoln Center Campus in the 1960s. Fordham\u2019s new Manhattan campus actually had an inauspicious beginning in December 1954 when Father Laurence J. McGinley, SJ, the President of Fordham, asked Robert Moses, New York City\u2019s master planner and quintessential power broker, if Fordham could rent five floors in the new Coliseum office building to be constructed at Columbus Circle. Moses turned down the request because he explained that the Coliseum was designed for offices, not classrooms However, Moses proposed an alternative solution to Fordham's need for more space. \"Why don't you let me bring you in on the urban renewal project a block west of [the Coliseum]\" he said to McGinley. The innocent Father McGinley said to Robert Moses, of all people: \"What is an urban renewal project?\"\n\nThen Robert Moses said to McGinley, \"Let's see. How much room would you need? Ten acres?\" At that point, Father McGinley admitted, \"I almost fell off my chair.... When he mentioned acres, I couldn't believe it. I never heard anyone talk about New York City real estate in terms of acres. I gulped.\" Robert Moses was not kidding. He whipped out a Manhattan street map and said: \"Look, maybe a couple of these blocks; that would be about ten acres or something like that.\"\n\nThis conversation between Robert Moses and Father McGinley, said Father Gannon, \"started the most important dream in Fordham's history.\" When Father McGinley told Cardinal Spellman about his rapidly escalating dream for Lincoln Center, the cardinal replied: \"This is the greatest thing that has happened to Fordham since my predecessor Archbishop Hughes built [St. John's College] up at Rose Hill. The Lincoln Center campus of Fordham University gradually took shape between 1961, when the new Law School building was dedicated, and 1969, when the Lowenstein Building became the home of a new liberal-arts college and the graduate schools of Education, Social Service and Business Administration (now the Gabelli School of Business).\n\nFordham made major strides in achieving its goal of becoming a national rather than a local or regional institution during the nineteen-year presidency of Father Joseph O\u2019Hare, SJ In 1972, 72 percent of Fordham undergraduates were commuters; twenty years later, 70 percent of Fordham undergraduates lived on campus. The transition was made possible by the construction of over 3,500 new student residential units. The opening of the Walsh Family Library in 1997 was an essential ingredient in Fordham\u2019s bid to become a serious research institution. In 1997 U.S. News and World Report ranked Fordham Law School 28th out of 179 law schools nationwide, and it ranked the Graduate School of Social Service 11th out of 127 such programs across the country.\n\nWhile Fordham made a determined bid for national recognition, it did not neglect its ties to the local community. An extensive and successful Higher Educational Opportunity Program (HEOP) enabled many minority students to complete college. Fordham also gave a tuition rebate of $4,000 to Bronx students who lived at home. The Graduate School of Education cooperated closely with the New York City public schools, and the first African American and the first Hispanic public school principals in the New York City were educated at Fordham. In the early 1980s the Graduate School of Social Service had a higher number of Hispanic students than any other American university except the University of Puerto Rico. Under Dean John Feerick, a native of the South Bronx, Fordham Law School sponsored a number of initiatives and research centers to benefit the local community.\n\nThe Fordham Law School building and McKeon Hall opened on the Lincoln Center campus in 2014.\n\nExcelsior\n\nIn 1841 Bishop Hughes was able to raise locally only one-third of the $30,000 that he needed to pay for the acquisition of the property at Rose Hill. A century later Father Gannon was only able to raise little more than half of the one million dollars that he set as the goal of Fordham\u2019s centennial fund-raising drive. By contrast, when Father Joseph M. McShane launched the Excelsior | Ever Upward | Campaign for Fordham in 2009, he boldly set a goal of a half-billion dollars. It was a huge success and raised $540,000,000 from 60,000 contributors.\n\nThe single largest contribution (and the largest contribution in Fordham\u2019s history) came from Mario J. Gabelli, CBA \u201965, whose generous donation of $25 million made possible the establishment of the Gabelli School of Business in the completely renovated Hughes Hall at Rose Hill. The success of Excelsior also helped to defray the expense of the new law school building and additional residential housing at both Lincoln Center and Rose Hill.\n\nToday, John Hughes\u2019s original investment of $30,000 continues to pay handsome dividends not only for the Catholics of New York, but also for the much larger community that Fordham continues to serve.\n\nMsgr. Thomas J. Shelley\n\nProfessor Emeritus, Theology, Fordham University\n\nAuthor, Fordham, A History of the Jesuit University of New York: 1841-2003"}, {"url": "https://news.fordham.edu/university-news/celebrating-the-180th-anniversary-of-fordhams-founding/", "page_content": "The elm-lined paths of the Rose Hill campus lead to a bronze statue of Fordham\u2019s founder, Archbishop John Hughes, dedicated on June 24, 1891.\n\nOn June 24, 1841, Bishop John Hughes opened St. John\u2019s College in the village of Fordham with just six students. It was the first Catholic institution of higher education in the Northeast. Five years later, the Jesuits took over the fledgling college, fulfilling the ardent hopes of Bishop Hughes, who\u2019d always wanted the school to be in Jesuit hands. In 1907, having achieved university status, St. John\u2019s College officially changed its name to Fordham University.\n\nToday, as we celebrate Fordham\u2019s auspicious founding, we reflect on the story of an Irish immigrant who sought to elevate his people\u2014and all immigrants\u2014with the promise of higher education. Below is a 2016 homily delivered by Monsignor Thomas J. Shelley, Ph.D., GSAS \u201966, professor emeritus of theology at Fordham.\n\nFounding Father: Archbishop John Hughes\n\nLady Chapel, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, June 24, 2016\n\n219 years ago today, on June 24, 1797, St. John\u2019s Day, Fordham\u2019s founding father, John Joseph Hughes, was born in the little village of Annalogan in County Tyrone, Ireland. \u201cThey told me when I was a boy,\u201d he said, \u201cthat for the first five days I was on a social and civil equality with the most favored subject of the British Empire. These five days would be the interval between my birth and my baptism.\u201d Once John Hughes was baptized a Catholic, however, like every Catholic in eighteenth-century Ireland, he immediately became a second-class citizen in the land of his birth.\n\nJohn Hughes also preserved another vivid childhood memory. When his younger sister died, after the funeral Mass, the parish priest led the funeral procession to the local cemetery, which was the property of the Protestant Church of Ireland. Catholic priests were forbidden by law from entering these cemeteries. And so, outside the gate of the cemetery, the parish priest bent down, scooped up a clump of earth in his hands, blessed it, and handed it to Hughes\u2019s father to sprinkle it over his daughter\u2019s coffin as it was lowered into the grave. Childhood memories of this kind are not easily erased, and John Hughes never forgot this example of the prejudice suffered by Catholics in his native land.\n\nJohn Hughes spent the first twenty years of his life in Ireland as the son of a poor Ulster farmer where he experienced not only prejudice but also the grinding poverty that prevented him from obtaining more than a rudimentary education. When he emigrated to America in 1817, he worked in the only occupations for which he was qualified, as a laborer in the construction trades and in quarries. When he applied for admission to a seminary to study for the priesthood, he had to spend his first year in remedial studies in order to qualify for the entrance requirements.\n\nExposure to prejudice and poverty was not limited to John Hughes. It was the common experience of Irish Catholics both in their homeland and in America. However, the difference was that America was the land of opportunity for immigrants, if they had the education to take advantage of these opportunities. This was one of the primary motives that led Bishop Hughes to establish St. John\u2019s College at Fordham in 1841. He considered education the indispensable means for the members of his immigrant flock to break loose from the cycle of poverty that ensnared them and that prevented them from participating in what today we would call the American dream. John Hughes\u2019s first biographer, John Hassard, a graduate of St. John\u2019s College, Fordham, in 1855, and Hughes\u2019s former secretary who knew him well, said, \u201cThe subject that of all others that [Hughes] had nearest his heart was education.\u201d\n\nA public official who saw what Hughes was doing and came to admire him greatly was William Seward, the politically astute governor of New York State. Later, as secretary of state during the Civil War, Seward became the indispensable man in Lincoln\u2019s cabinet. Governor Seward told Hughes, \u201cYou have begun a great work in the elevation of the rejected immigrant, a work auspicious to the destiny of that class and still more beneficial to our common country.\u201d Incidentally Hughes never made a distinction between Catholic and non-Catholic immigrants. He framed the issue this way, that foreign-born American citizens should enjoy the same legal rights as native-born American citizens.\n\nBishop Hughes became the effective leader of New York Catholics in June 1839. Only two months later he made his first major decision when he purchased 106 acres at Rose Hill for a college, which confirms the statement of John Hassard that \u201cthe subject of all others that [Hughes] had nearest his heart was education.\u201d The price of the real estate was $30,000 ($29,750) and Hughes needed an additional $10,000 to renovate the two buildings on the property. \u201cI had not, when I purchased the site of this new college, St. John\u2019s, Fordham,\u201d Bishop Hughes said, \u201cso much as a penny wherewith to commence the payment for it.\u201d He immediately launched a fund-raising campaign among New York\u2019s impoverished Catholics. After nine months the campaign netted a paltry $10,000. Hughes then went to Europe on a ten-month begging trip, and generous Catholics in France and Austria contributed the money that he needed to start St. John\u2019s College at Fordham.\n\nJohn Hughes\u2019s new college opened its doors 175 years ago today, on St. John\u2019s Day, June 24, 1841, with a grand total of six students. The faculty was larger than the student body. For the next five years Hughes struggled to maintain his college as a diocesan institution with a faculty of New York diocesan priests, but it was a losing battle. There were four presidents in five years. One president became a cardinal, another became an archbishop, but neither of them was a professional educator.\n\nThen there was a third diocesan priest as president, the ineffable and eminently forgettable Ambrose Manahan, a scatterbrain cleric whom Hughes dismissed for incompetence. When Hughes gave him his walking papers, he sent him this priceless letter, \u201cI advise you to resign . . . in the almost extinguished hope that, on a new scene where your future character will be determined by your future conduct, you may disappoint the melancholy anticipations that the past is too well calculated to inspire.\u201d Fordham\u2019s founding father may not have had much formal education, but he certainly possessed the innate Irish gift of eloquence.\n\nFordham\u2019s fourth and most capable diocesan president was a young cleric named Father John Harley, but he died at the age of twenty-nine, a not uncommon occurrence at that time because of the rigors of seminary education. Hughes had no one among his own diocesan clergy to replace Harley, and so in 1845 he turned to the Society of Jesus, an international order of scholars with a reputation as professional educators, to take charge of his fledgling college. The Jesuits in turn were happy to establish a foothold in the largest city in the United States.\n\nAlthough St. John\u2019s College remained a diocesan college for only five years, we rightly honor Archbishop John Hughes today as our founding father. It was he who purchased the property at Rose Hill, raised the funds to pay for it, recruited the original faculty and administration, obtained the state charter and left to the Jesuits a flourishing little college whose ownership they were happy to obtain. It was no mean accomplishment even for a man of the stature of John Joseph Hughes.\n\nI do not think that the influence of John Hughes on Fordham University is limited to the past. In many respects he remains an inspiration for us today. For example, you are all familiar with the statue of Archbishop Hughes outside Cunniffe House on the Rose Hill campus. That statue was the gift of the alumni on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of St. John\u2019s College, Fordham, in 1891. Many of the alumni would have known Hughes when they were students. Hughes had only been dead for 27 years.\n\nThe alumni wanted these words of John Hughes to be engraved on the pedestal of the statue: \u201cI have always preached that every denomination, Jews, Christians, Catholics, Protestants\u2014of every shade and sex\u2014were all entitled to entire freedom of conscience, without let or hindrance from any sect or number of sects, no matter how small their number or how unpopular the doctrine that they profess.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately those words of John Hughes were not engraved on the pedestal of his statue perhaps, perhaps\u2014and here I am only guessing\u2014because the theologically conservative Jesuit Fathers at Fordham considered John Hughes\u2019s words to be too bold and radical. They certainly would have set off alarm bells in the Vatican. However, in 1965, the Second Vatican Council effectively if posthumously endorsed those words of Archbishop Hughes in its Declaration on Religious Liberty and in Nostra Aetate, the council\u2019s document on the relationship between the Catholic Church and the Jewish people. Isn\u2019t it inspiring to know that, at least in this all-important area of freedom of conscience, our founding father anticipated the work of the Second Vatican Council by a whole century?\n\nJohn Hughes was no Mother Theresa. He will never be canonized because, among his many other qualities, he was a tough and feisty street fighter who gave no quarter and asked no quarter in an often hostile environment. In 1844 a Nativist mob unleashed several days of rioting and violence on the Catholic community in Philadelphia. They then threatened to do the same thing in New York City. Bishop Hughes told the Nativist mayor of New York City, James Harper, that, if any harm came to his churches, he would turn the city into \u201ca second Moscow,\u201d a reference to the destruction of Moscow by the Russians in 1812 when Napoleon attacked the city.\n\nThat does not sound like Mother Theresa. To be honest, it is also far removed from the spirit of the Sermon on the Mount. But it worked and may be justified on the grounds that it preserved peace and law and order. The Nativist leaders backed down and disbanded their mob and spared New York City from the violence that only days earlier had engulfed the city of Philadelphia.\n\nMany historians have criticized Archbishop Hughes for his bellicose style of leadership, but at least one distinguished historian of American Catholicism, Monsignor John Tracy Ellis, offered a more nuanced appraisal of John Hughes\u2019s leadership. Ellis said that \u201cthere were times when [Hughes\u2019s\u2019] very aggressiveness was about the only approach that would serve the end that he was seeking, viz., justice for his people.\u201d An integral element in his quest to obtain justice for his people and to give them economic and social equality in American society was to give them access to higher education. That is why he went to such great pains to establish the university whose 175th anniversary we celebrate today.\n\nIt is difficult to envision anyone else in the Catholic community in nineteenth-century New York City who could have accomplished what Archbishop John Hughes did for \u201cthe elevation of the rejected immigrant\u201d (to quote again Governor William Seward). A key element in Archbishop Hughes\u2019s plan to elevate the rejected immigrant was to give them the opportunity for a college education. We all owe him a great debt of gratitude for establishing St. John\u2019s College at Rose Hill, the future Fordham University. It is a debt that we gladly acknowledge today and will continue to acknowledge and repeat in many different ways over the course of the next twelve months.\n\nThomas J.

He entered the seminary at Mount St. Mary\u2019s College in Emmitsburg, Maryland, two years later. Ordained to the priesthood in 1826, he was named coadjutor (assistant) bishop of the Diocese of New York in 1837. He succeeded John Dubois as bishop five years later and became an archbishop in 1850, when Pope Pius IX elevated the status of the diocese in recognition of New York\u2019s growing immigrant population and increasing influence on the national stage.\n\nOne of his earliest and highest priorities in New York was to establish a college and seminary for the future of his flock. In 1839, he purchased land in the farming village of Fordham and, less than two years later, opened the doors of St. John\u2019s College to its first six students. At the same time, he also established an independent Catholic school system throughout the diocese.\n\nIn Archbishop Hughes, Catholics of New York found both a spiritual shepherd and political pit bull, whose influence extended well beyond the metropolis. Nicknamed \u201cDagger John\u201d in part because he signed his name with a cross, he was a fierce defender of the Catholic faith against anti-immigration movements. By 1859\u2014a year after he laid the cornerstone for the current St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral on Fifth Avenue\u2014he had dedicated 97 churches and established no fewer than 61 new parishes and parochial schools. In 1861, he traveled to Europe, at President Lincoln\u2019s request, to garner and reinforce support for the Union during the Civil War.\n\nArchbishop Hughes\u2019 spiritual and political legacy is felt throughout present-day New York. At Fordham, we celebrate his vision and his lifelong commitment to education, which transformed a small college in a farming village in Westchester County into the Jesuit University of New York, the Jesuit University of the capital of the world. Archbishop Hughes\u2019 \u201cdaring and dangerous undertaking\u201d continues to unleash a corps of ethical graduates who transform lives within their engaged, discerning wisdom.

John was the third of seven children of Patrick Hughes and Margaret McKenna Hughes, who earned their living by working the land. Michael, Patrick, Mary, Peter, Ellen and Margaret were John's brothers and sisters, two of whom, Peter and Ellen died in childhood.\n\nThe early 19th century was a difficult time for Irish Catholics living under Protestant rule. For the Hughes family, the low point came when the family priest was barred by law from entering the cemetery where John\u2019s sister was being interred. Within months, John\u2019s parents decided to abandon Ireland and move their family to America.\n\n\n\nBy 1817, a 20-year-old John Hughes was working as a gardener and stonemason at Mount St. Mary\u2019s College in Emmitsburg, Maryland. John had been given an opportunity to study horticulture there while he worked at Mount St. Mary\u2019s, but he had his eye on another goal: being in America now seemed like the portal to his lifelong dream of becoming a priest. He was stung, however, by his failure to gain admission to the local seminary where the rector could not overlook his lack of education. Luckily for Hughes, he often met a visitor to Mount St. Mary\u2019s \u2014 Mother Elizabeth Bayley Seton, a widow and convert to Catholicism who had started her own religious order, the Sisters of Charity.\n\nMother Seton, who would later become the first native-born American to be canonized (and, interestingly enough, a Prep grandparent: her grandson, William Seton was a member of the Class of 1848), would be John\u2019s advocate for admission to the seminary. With the help of her considerable influence, John Joseph Hughes was ordained in Philadelphia in 1826.\n\nFrom his first days as a priest, he gained notoriety as a figure who stood against bigotry in its many forms. He wrote and preached on the shamefulness of slavery (though it is true that later in his career, he would be careful to sidestep the political implications of a full-out endorsement of the Abolitionists). And he became a crusader against the persecution of newly arrived Irish immigrants, who sometimes found their new lives in America nearly as bad as they had been in Ireland, if in a different way. Nativism was a crushing burden to Catholics of the time, and Hughes feared that as they had been in their homeland, Catholics in America would forever be considered second-class citizens.\n\n\n\nHis response to the hydra-headed Nativist movement \u2014 which included Protestant ministers, intellectuals and religious fundamentalists \u2014 was fierce and very public. As described by historians, when a Protestant newspaper ran an editorial focused on \u201ctraitorous Popery,\u201d Hughes responded with a letter to the editorial board in which he called the authors the \u201cclerical scum of the country.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn 1834, Nativists put the blame for a cholera outbreak in Philadelphia squarely on the Irish. Hughes, risking his own life, worked to the breaking point to nurse and console the sick and dying. In contrast, a large percentage of the most notables among the Protestant clergy had fled the city. Afterwards, Hughes wrote a letter to the Gazette, which included this stinging remark about the absentee ministers: \u201c[They are] remarkable for their pastoral solicitude so long as the flock is healthy, the pastures pleasant, and the fleece lubricant, abandoning their post when disease begins to spread dissolution in the fold.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe year 1835 was a watershed for Hughes, still serving in Pennsylvania at the time. A socially eminent Princeton graduate and Presbyterian minister from New York named John Breckenridge challenged him to a public debate. Hughes, knowing that he might not be able to hold his own against the better-educated Breckenridge in a live, oral debate, instead suggested that it be conducted in the respective church newspapers. There was no Catholic newspaper in Philadelphia at the time, so Hughes had to start one. Week after week for nine months, the two clergymen battled it out in print, and the newspapers grew thicker and thicker. This publicly aggressive side of Hughes, along with the dagger-like cross with which he preceded signature, gave rise to his nickname, \"Dagger John.\"\n\nIt is unlikely that either man won many converts among their readership, but the drama turned Hughes into a hero for the immigrant Irish population.\n\nIn 1838, when he was just 40 years old, John Hughes was appointed coadjutor-bishop of New York to administrate the diocese for an aging Bishop John Dubois \u2014 coincidentally the very priest who had rebuffed his initial attempts to enter the seminary in Maryland. Almost immediately, Bishop Hughes was caught in a battle with New York City over its schools, which were essentially sectarian Protestant institutions where students read books describing Irish immigrants as \u201cdrunken\u201d and \u201cdepraved\u201d and were given Protestant religious instruction. Among his allies in this push to end sectarianism in the public schools were the city\u2019s Jews and Unitarians. His efforts would eventually lead to the passage in of the Maclay Bill, which forbade religious instruction in public schools. The city\u2019s Catholic churches were threatened the night the bill passed, and old Bishop Dubois, who was still living in the same residence with Hughes, was rescued by the police when mobs tried to burn down the building.\n\nDubois passed away later that year, and Hughes succeeded him as the fourth bishop of the Diocese of New York.\n\n\n\nBesides his battle against the New York City Public School Society, Hughes had also begun to establish a parallel Catholic school system, saying \u201cWe shall have to build the schoolhouse first and the church afterward.\u201d Eventually, John Hughes would oversee the opening of scores of privately funded Catholic schools throughout the New York area.\n\n\n\nSchoolchildren were not Hughes\u2019 only educational priority, for he turned his sights on higher education as well, an enterprise which he acknowledged to be a \u201cdaring and dangerous undertaking.\u201d In an age when anti-Catholic sentiment was rife, Dagger John\u2019s daring in the face of danger was the very stuff of which Fordham Prep and Fordham University were together born.\n\nMaking the journey to Westchester, of which the Bronx was still then a part, Bishop Hughes purchased Rose Hill Manor in the farming village of Fordham in 1839. In 1840, he established the first institution on the site: St. Joseph\u2019s Seminary. A year later in 1841, on the Feast of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist, Midsummer\u2019s Day, June 24th \u2014 Hughes\u2019 44th birthday \u2014 St. Joseph\u2019s Seminary would share the land with Hughes' second Rose Hill endeavor: St. John\u2019s College. The College would soon be organized into levels, or divisions. First Division would become Fordham University and Second Division would become what is today Fordham Prep.\n\nHughes would have a hand in Fordham\u2019s Jesuit tradition as well. A few years later, his persistence would convince a band of Jesuits from a struggling college in Kentucky to take over operation of his new school.\n\nJohn Hughes lived a remarkable life. After founding St. John\u2019s he also played a part in founding Manhattan College, Manhattanville College and the College of Mount St. Vincent. In July of 1850, when the Diocese of New York was elevated to an archdiocese, John Hughes became the first archbishop of New York. He would lay the cornerstone for St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in 1858, one of the architects of which was none other than William Rodrigue, the architect of the University Church, the Prep\u2019s first art teacher, and Hughes\u2019 brother-in-law, the husband of his sister Margaret.\n\nIn 1861, at the personal request of President Lincoln, Hughes traveled to France to help win support for the Union cause in Europe.\n\n\n\nSome scholars credit Hughes with saving the Irish in America, his herculean efforts on their behalf pulling the community up from extreme poverty and the violence, illiteracy and despair that it bred. Many credit him as being one of the great builders of the Church in America. All agree that he was a man of forceful personality and indomitable spirit. For Fordham, he was all of these \u2014 and more \u2014 but he is first and foremost our Founder.\n\n\n\nAfter months of illness, His Excellency, the Most Reverend Archbishop John J. Hughes died on January 3, 1864. At the time of his death, he was being cared for by his two sisters, Margaret Hughes Rodrigue and Mother Mary Angelica Hughes, SC, mother general of the Sisters of Charity of New York. An estimated 100,000 people gatherered around the cathedral during his funeral. Initially interred at Old St. Patrick\u2019s, his body was eventually moved to rest under the main altar at St. Patrick\u2019s on Fifth Avenue.\n\n\n\nIn the words of his biographer, John Rose Greene Hassard, Class of 1855:"}, {"url": "https://www.fordham.edu/about/living-the-mission/jesuit-and-catholic/archbishop-john-hughes-founder-of-fordham/", "page_content": "John Joseph Hughes was born on June 24, 1797 in County Tyrone, Ireland. He was raised there until immigrating to the United States in 1817. Once settled with his family in Chambersburg, Penn., Hughes made several unsuccessful applications to be admitted to Mount St. Mary's College in Emmitsburg, Md. He was eventually hired by its rector, the Abb\u00e9 John Dubois, S.S., as a gardener. During this time, he befriended Mother Elizabeth Ann Seton. Seton was favorably impressed by Hughes and persuaded Dubois to reconsider his admission. Hughes was subsequently admitted as a regular student of Mount St. Mary's in September 1820.\n\nIn his time as a seminarian, Hughes devotedly served his home diocese of Philadelphia. On October 15, 1826, he was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Henry Conwell at St. Joseph's Church in Philadelphia. During his early years as a priest, Hughes faithfully carried out his ministerial duties but also succeeded in bringing new life and an air of vibrancy to the Church he so deeply cared for in Philadelphia. Hughes founded St. John's Orphan Asylum in 1829 and was responsible for the structuring of a new church, St. John the Evangelist, in 1832. St. John the Evangelist became regarded as one of the finest and most impressive churches in the country at that time.\n\nHughes' passion for the welfare of the Church and his innate sense of initiative was soon recognized by the Catholic Church far beyond the confines of the Diocese of Philadelphia. On August 7, 1837, Pope Gregory XVI called upon Hughes to serve as the coadjutor bishop for the then Diocese of New York.\n\nConsistent with his desire to educate people on the Word of God, Hughes began searching in 1838 for a suitable location to establish a new seminary and college. It was not long before Hughes resolved that the 100 acres of Rose Hill Manor bordering the Bronx River was the perfect spot. After three short but productive years, St. John's College (now Fordham University), the first Catholic institution of higher learning in the northeast, was established. In 1846, St. John's College was sold to the Jesuit Order and Archbishop Hughes recruited five Jesuit priests from St. Mary's College in Kentucky to staff the College. On April 10th of the same year, the governor of the State of New York granted the College a university charter. Then, in 1907, after the recent addition of a law school and medical school, the name was changed to Fordham University, and St. John's College became Fordham College. After remaining a men's college for 133 years, Fordham College merged with Thomas More College for women in 1974, becoming coeducational.\n\nAfter his thoughtful work founding what we now call Fordham University, Hughes went on to succeed his predecessor and former rector, Bishop John Dubois, in late December of 1842. In becoming the bishop of the Diocese of New York, Hughes assumed responsibility for a diocese that stretched across the entire state of New York and northern New Jersey. Always a man eager to spread God's holy Word, he embraced this new position with both courage and conviction. He worked zealously to uphold the dignity of each human being and the integrity of the Catholic faith, standing in unique solidarity with the Irish immigrants of his time and giving careful consideration to the ways by which young children were being educated on the foundations of the Catholic faith. And when the Diocese of New York was elevated to the status of an Archdiocese by Pope Pius IX, so, too, was Hughes' own status elevated to that of an Archbishop.\n\nThe vision of \"Dagger John,\" as Archbishop Hughes became known due to his aggressive and determined personality, remains actively alive at Fordham today. We know this because the men and women of Fordham emerge from their Jesuit experiences and are guided by conscience, empowered by competence, and fortified by a sincere sense of compassion. These are the characteristics of men and women who live with and for others."}, {"url": "https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07516a.htm", "page_content": "John Hughes\n\nPlease help support the mission of New Advent and get the full contents of this website as an instant download.

Tyrone, Ireland, 24 June, 1797 of Patrick Hughes and Margaret McKenna: died in New York, 3 January, 1864. His father, a farmer of limited means, emigrated to the United States in 1816, and settled in Chambersberg, Pa. Johns's early education was received at Aligher, and later at Auchnacloy, near his native village. Though he felt called to the priesthood, circumstances did not permit him to continue his studies: being disinclined to farm life, he was placed with a friend of his father to study horticulture. He followed his father to America in 1817, landed at Baltimore, and soon after went to Chambersburg where he aided his family for a year or more. His ardent desire to become a priest brought him in 1819 to Mount St. Mary's College, Emmitsburg. Md., which he entered as an employee, being received a year later as a student. Ordained to the priesthood 15 October, 1826, by Bishop Conwell, in St. Joseph's Church, Philadelphia, he laboured first at St. Augustine's, Philadelphia, later at Bedford, Pa., finally returning to Philadelphia to become pastor of St. Joseph's, and afterwards of St. Mary's whose trustees were in open revolt against the bishop, and were subdued by Father Hughes only when he built St. John the Evangelist church, 1832, then considered one of the finest in the country. Previous to this, in 1829, he founded St. John's Orphan Asylum. About this period he was engaged in a religious controversy with Rev. John A. Brekenridge, a distinguished Presbyterian clergyman, with the result that Father Hughes's remarkable ability attracted widespread attention and admiration. His name was mentioned for the vacant see of Cincinnati and for the Coadjutorship of Philadelphia. On 7 Jan, 1838, however, Father Hughes was consecrated Bishop of Basileopolis and Coadjutor of New York, by Bishop Dubois, in St. Patrick's Cathedral, Mott Street, New York. In 1839 he became administrator-Apostolic of New York, and on the death of Bishop Dubois succeeded to the vacant see, 20 Dec. 1842. He was raised to the dignity of first Archbishop of New York, 19 July, 1850, receiving the pallium personally from Pius IX at Rome, 3 April 1851.\n\nThe abolition of trusteeism in New York marked the beginning of his episcopate. He confronted a critical diocesan condition arising from differences between Bishop Dubois and the lay trustees whose control of the church revenues was working injury to religion, and had encumbered the 10 churches then in the city with a debt of $300,000, a crushing burden in those days. Bishop Hughes's in Philadelphia with trusteeism served him well in taking up the defense of Bishop Dubois. He appealed directly to the people, before whom he forcefully defended the Divine authority to govern granted by Christ to the hierarchy, and clearly exposed the viciousness of lay domination in administration of church matters. The people readily passed a resolution condemning the cathedral trustees who gave way to a new board well disposed to obey ecclesiastical authority. The bishop convoked in 1841 the first Diocesan Synod of New York, which enacted timely legislation affecting spiritual matters, and advised for tenure and administration of church property wise regulations which placed the rector of the church in control of temporals as well as spirituals. His triumph over the trustee System would have been complete and final at the very outset had the trustees of St. Louis's church, Buffalo, been as prompt to submit as all others. Their attitude brought the archbishop, as late as 1855, into a controversy with Erasmus Brooks, editor and state senator, who assailed in the Legislature the archbishop's plan of holding church property. Unfavorable legislation followed, but was soon repealed, and prepared the way for the present satisfactory religious corporation law of the State of New York\n\nReturning from Europe, whither he had gone in 1839 to seek aid for his diocese, Bishop Hughes found his flock involved in a movement to modify the existing common school system, which, professing to be non-sectarian, was undermining, in fact, the religious beliefs of Catholic children. The bishop immediately placed himself at the head of the movement, and deemed it incumbent on him to oppose the Public School Society, a private corporation controlling the management of schools and the distribution of the school fund provided by the municipality. He based his objection to this society on the ground that it violated a fundamental American principle, namely freedom of conscience. Catholics could not accept any system of education which ignored, undermined, or opposed the religious faith their conscience dictated to be true. After two years' unceasing contest, he finally brought about the overthrow of the Public School Society. He had hoped, and Governor Seward was kindly disposed, that the Legislature might be so truly American as to sanction and support Catholic schools. Religious animosity proved too bitter. The bishop's hopes were not realized. The establishment of the present public school system followed, which likewise, failing to satisfy Catholic conscience, led the bishop to lay the foundation, on a firm basis, of the existing Catholic school system in New York. An anti-Catholic outbreak of the \"Native American\" political party occurred in 1844, in Philadelphia, where churches and convents were destroyed. A meeting of this party was announced to take place in New York City. Apprehensive that the result would be riot and bloodshed, the bishop called personally on the mayor of the city to prevent the meeting. Warning him of the consequences if any anti-Catholic outrage were attempted. He at the same time solemnly cautioned his flock against violence, but took measures to resist any attack against church property. His fearless determined attitude prevented the holding of the meeting and averted disturbance of the peace. Ten years later the \"Know-nothing\" faction became active. He again advised his people to keep aloof from the centres of trouble. He was deeply convinced that all such movements, being as anti-American as they were anti-Catholic, could not possible thrive in the United States.\n\nFew public men of his day possessed a more statesmanlike grasp of the genius of the American Republic. He had unbounded confidence in its institutions, when their very existence was precarious. He looked upon America as a land of promise opened by a beneficent Providence to the oppressed of the nations. No one would question his own abiding love of his native soil; but he would not permit this love to make him lament as an exile of Erin when he might rejoice as an American citizen. Thus he taught his people. So far-seeing was he in this respect that he looked with disfavor upon national churches, lest they might perpetrate racial differences and foreign customs. All must be formed into a common people; and no influence could do this better for the American people, he contended, than the Catholic Church sent by Christ to teach all nations. Archbishop Hughes will ever rank among America's foremost citizens. His towering character, genius for government, and intense patriotism won for him the respect and often the admiration of his opponents, the esteem and even the lifelong friendship of distinguished statesmen. President Polk, through Secretary Buchanan, in 1846, proffered him a diplomatic mission to Mexico, which he was unable to accept. On invitation of John Quincy Adams, Stephen A. Douglas, and John C. Calhoun, he lectured before Congress in the Capitol, Washington, his topic being \"Christianity, the Only Source of Moral Social and Political Regeneration\". At the outbreak of the Civil War, although not an abolitionist, he boldly sustained the Union cause, and was in frequent communication with William H. Seward, Secretary of State, to whom he offered useful suggestions on the conduct of the war. President Lincoln, in an autograph letter, expressed his appreciation of the counsel given. Secretary Seward, desiring to hold France in a friendly attitude towards the Federal Government, entrusted the archbishop with an important mission to the court of Napoleon III, who received him most graciously, and was dissuaded by him from recognizing the Confederacy. On this visit to Europe, wherever he went, he left nothing undone to create sympathy for the Union side. During the Draft Riots of 1863 in New York City, Governor Seymour invoked the aid of the archbishop to suppress disorder, to which invitation, though he was fatally broken in health, he willingly responded, addressing a large assemblage from the balcony of his residence.\n\nHis loyalty to his adopted country was well balanced and finely adjusted to the duties and responsibilities of his sacred office. He exercised the strictest vigilance lest American liberty might engender liberal influence tending to minimize the doctrine and discipline of the Catholic Church. He unsparingly condemned those who, through fear of anti-Catholic feeling, were disposed to conciliate their opponents by seemingly harmless concessions. He was intolerant of the slightest modification or innovation in religion unless sanctioned by the Supreme Head of the Church. He believed that the adherence to Catholic faith should be bold, fearless, outspoken and uncompromising in the extreme, and especially so in the face of opposition. Pius IX, exiled in 1848, and again threatened in 1860, found the archbishop one of his staunchest defenders of the Holy See. Strong agencies of power and influence were conspiring against the temporal sovereignty of the pope, and this condition intimidated not a few Catholics into a policy of silent and ineffective sympathy; others somewhat less timid favored action, but of a conservative character. The archbishop approved of no such methods, and boldly proclaimed himself an uncompromising supporter of the Vicar of Christ and his lawful patrimony. By appeal, sermon, lecture, and pastoral letter he aroused his flock at home to unbounded enthusiasm, and stirred Christendom abroad in a masterly vindication of the temporal independence of the sovereign pontiff. He raised in 1860 the princely sum of $53,000, as an offering from his diocese to the Holy Father; and his pastoral letter, circulated throughout Europe and translated in Italian, afforded solace to the afflicted soul of Pius IX.\n\nConjointly with all this prominence and activity demanded by public and vital interests of Church and nation, the archbishop followed faithfully and zealously the exacting life of a hardworking missionary bishop in the upbuilding of a rapidly growing diocese. In 1842 there were some forty priests, fifty churches and 200,000 Catholics scattered over his jurisdiction, which embraced the State of New York and eastern part of New Jersey. Bishop McClosky, later the first bishop of Albany, was Coadjutor of New York from 1844 to 1847. Albany and Buffalo were erected into episcopal sees in 1847; Brooklyn and Newark in 1853. Besides these four separate dioceses made up within the original territory of the diocese of New York, the archbishop before his death in 1864 ruled 150 priests, 85 churches, 3 colleges, 50 schools and academies and over 400,000 people. He stated in 1858 that he had dedicated his 99th church. As metropolitan, created in 1850, he presided over New York, New Jersey and all New England, with suffragan sees at Albany, Buffalo, Brooklyn, Newark, Boston, Burlington, Hartford and Portland. The First Provincial Council of New York was convened in September, 1854, after which the archbishop journeyed to Rome and he was present at the proclamation of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception.\n\nDuring his administration institutions of charity and higher learning grew apace with churches and schools. The seminary was moved in 1840 from Largerville to Fordham, where a college was opened a year later. The Jesuits assumed charge of it in 1846, but in 1855 the archbishop withdrew the seminary from Fordham, and in 1862 secured property at Troy, New York, for the establishment of St. Joseph's Provincial Seminary. He also proved to be one of the warmest supporters of the North American College, Rome, projected by Pius IX in 1855, and successfully opened in 1859. To meet diocesan needs he introduced into New York the Christian Brothers, the Religious of the Sacred Heart, the Sisters of Mercy, the Ursulines, the Sisters of Notre Dame, and the Sisters of the Good Shepherd. Finding the Sisters of Charity of Emmitsburg, Maryland, who were labouring in New York, restricted by their rule to a limited field and refrained from undertaking certain good works which the archbishop desired, he organized an independent diocesan community of Sisters of Charity, who today, are managing a variety of educational, charitable, protective and industrial institutions, and form one of the most flourishing and successful sisterhoods in the United States. Foreseeing the future greatness of his diocese and cathedral city, he planned the erection of a cathedral which would be commensurate with the importance of the city and See of New York, and would express in enduring stone the faith of his flock. He laid the cornerstone of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Fifth Avenue, 15 August 1858; this lofty and inspiring pile stands as a monument to his genius and prevision.\n\nHe lived and passed away amid stirring times; it was providential for church and country that he lived when he did. His natural gifts of mind and heart, independent of his education, were of a high order and made him pre-eminent in leadership; not only was he a great ruler of an important diocese in a hierarchy remarkable for distinguished bishops, but also a master-builder of the Church in the United States and one of the most helpful and sagacious of the makers of America. Church and nation are indebted forever to the prelate and citizen whose strong personality, and indomitable courage and invaluable service constituted him the man needed in his day to meet critical conditions. He was resolute, fearless, far-sighted and full of practical wisdom based on the sanest and soundest principles. To bring out the innate powers within him required but the opportunity presented by the Church struggling for a footing in a rather hostile community, and by the nation endeavoring to cope with harassing questions at home and impending trouble abroad. His failures were few; his achievements many and lasting. He was feared and loved; misunderstood and idolized; misrepresented even to his ecclesiastical superiors in Rome, whose confidence in him, however, remained unshaken. Severe of manner, kindly of heart, he was not aggressive until assailed.\n\nHe was a forceful, impressive and convincing speaker; an able, resourceful and talented controversialist, a clear, logical and direct writer. His writing were usually hastily done, as occasion required, but commanded general attention from friend and opponent His works are published in two volumes, which contain lectures, sermons, and pamphlets on historical and doctrinal subjects; open letters to men like Horace Greeley, General Cass, Mayor Harper, Senator Brooks and \"Kirwin Unmasked\", a series of six letters to a Presbyterian minister, writing under the assumed name of Kirwin; these letters are considered models of good English and are among the best written by the archbishop. His mortal remains were interred in the old St. Patrick's but were transferred 30 January, 1883 to their final resting place under the sanctuary of the cathedral in Fifth Avenue. His death elicited a general expression of sympathy and respect, and his memory was honored by tributes from President Lincoln and Secretary Seward, Governor Seymour and the Common Council of New York.\n\nSources HASSARD, Life of Most Rev.

Buried beneath a wagon full of timber, McCloskey was briefly blinded and remained unconscious for several days. Slowly his sight returned. With it came the conviction that he should enter the priesthood and dedicate his life to working for New York City\u2019s less fortunate.\n\nOrdained in 1834, he studied briefly in Rome before returning to New York City in 1836 to serve as pastor of St. Joseph\u2019s Church in Greenwich Village. He was named the first president of St. John\u2019s College in 1841 (a post he held for little more than a year) and served as coadjutor bishop of New York from 1843 to 1847, when he was appointed Bishop of Albany. After Fordham\u2019s founder, Archbishop John Hughes, died in 1864, McCloskey was appointed archbishop of New York.\n\nUnder his leadership, the archdiocese added several religious communities and charitable institutions to care for the city\u2019s abandoned and neglected children. At the same time, he oversaw the construction of 87 new churches, including the first parish for black Catholics as well as new churches for the growing Polish and Italian communities. He also doubled the number and capacity of Catholic schools. In 1875, he became the first American cardinal when he was elevated to the College of Cardinals by Pope Pius IX.\n\nToday, his spirit of selflessness and compassion is evident in the University\u2019s social work program and in its Graduate School of Social Service, which has trained legions of Fordham social workers committed to doing the world a world of good."}, {"url": "https://www.fordham.edu/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/about/", "page_content": "Fordham College at Rose Hill, the oldest and largest of the 10 colleges at Fordham University, has a long history as a Jesuit institution of higher learning with the purpose of providing its students with a sound liberal arts education. The College\u2019s Jesuit roots began in 1540 when St. Ignatius and his fellow companions took their religious vows and established the Society of Jesus. Since its inception, many Jesuits have devoted their lives to working in academic and social justice education, and this tradition continues today at Fordham College at Rose Hill.\n\nThe History of Fordham College at Rose Hill\n\nFordham College, founded originally as St. John\u2019s College, is located at the Rose Hill campus in the Bronx. In 1838, Archbishop John Hughes, began searching for a suitable site to establish a seminary and college. Finding the perfect spot at Rose Hill Manor, Hughes purchased the 100-acre farm bordering the Bronx River, and began construction on two buildings. Two years later, St. Joseph\u2019s Seminary was completed. A year after, on June 21, 1841, St. John\u2019s College opened. It was the first Catholic institution of higher learning in the northeast. At the time, six students were in attendance at St. John\u2019s College. John McCloskey, later the first bishop of Albany and then the first Cardinal of the United States, was named the College\u2019s president.\n\nIn 1846, St. John\u2019s College was sold to the Jesuit Order and Archbishop Hughes recruited five Jesuit priests from St. Mary\u2019s College in Kentucky to staff the institution. On April 10 of the same year, the governor of the State of New York granted the College a university charter. In 1907, after the recent addition of a law school and medical school, the name was changed to Fordham University; St. John\u2019s College became Fordham College. After remaining a men\u2019s college for 133 years, Fordham College merged with Thomas More College for women in 1974, becoming coeducational.\n\nCura Personalis and The Liberal Arts Core\n\nThroughout its history, Fordham College has embraced the Jesuit idea of educating the entire student, promoting the idea of cura personalis, or care of the whole person. This is especially evident through the strong core curriculum embraced by the College. Since 1846 and the implementation of its first curriculum, Fordham College has continuously upheld the importance of a solid core curriculum to provide all students with a strong liberal arts education. The liberal arts education at Fordham College provides students with the knowledge, resources and background to enter the world with the ability to successfully contribute to the various fields of education, law, social service, religion, business and the arts."}]}
