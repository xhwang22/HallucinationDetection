It is one of our sport\u2019s greatest challenges and ultimate honors to hoist the Calder Cup in victory.\n\nThe trophy is named for Frank Calder, who served as the National Hockey League\u2019s first President from 1917 to 1943. During the 1920\u2019s, Mr. Calder was instrumental in guiding hockey into the mainstream of America\u2019s major cities including Boston, New York, Detroit and Chicago, while helping in the formation of the American League.\n\nThe Calder Cup trophy itself was actually first awarded in 1938 to the Providence Reds for winning the second International-American Hockey League championship. (In 1996, George Parsons of the Syracuse Stars was presented the Calder Cup in a ceremony at the Onondaga County War Memorial, as it is believed the Stars never received a trophy for their 1937 championship.)\n\nIn 2001, the trophy\u2019s base was changed to include two tiers of plaques, which feature the rosters of each of the last 20 Calder Cup champions; the plaques from all previous champions are on display in the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto. The entire Calder Cup trophy now stands 24 inches tall and weighs 25 pounds. The bowl, made of sterling silver, is 12 inches high and eight inches in diameter. The hardwood base is made of Brazilian mahogany.\n\nA total of 33 different cities have had their AHL member club win the Calder Cup, led by Hershey with 11 and Cleveland with 10. Springfield (seven), Rochester (six), Providence (five), Chicago (three) and Grand Rapids (two) are the other active cities with more than one title.\n\nTwenty-nine members of the Hockey Hall of Fame have won the Calder Cup in their careers, including Johnny Bower, Terry Sawchuk, Emile Francis, Gerry Cheevers, Al Arbour, Andy Bathgate, Larry Robinson, Doug Harvey, Patrick Roy and Fred Shero.\n\nNot only have great players won the Calder Cup, but outstanding coaches have also hoisted the AHL\u2019s championship trophy. Hall of Famer Fred \u201cBun\u201d Cook holds the distinction of winning seven Calder Cups in his career; no other AHL head coach has ever won more than three. Current NHL head coaches with Calder Cup titles on their resumes include Barry Trotz (Portland, 1994), John Tortorella (Rochester, 1996), Peter Laviolette (Providence, 1999), Todd McLellan (Houston, 2003), Bruce Boudreau (Hershey, 2006), Jon Cooper (Norfolk, 2012), Jared Bednar (Lake Erie, 2016) and Sheldon Keefe (Toronto, 2018).\n\nMore than 100 players and coaches have won both the Calder Cup and Stanley Cup in their careers, including Ace Bailey, Brian Engblom, Dick Gamble, Butch Goring, Adam Graves, Peter Mahovlich, Kirk Maltby, Ab McDonald, Patrick Sharp, Fred Shero, Brian Skrudland, Jeff Carter, Braden Holtby, John Carlson, and 2021 Stanley Cup winners Tyler Johnson, Alex Killorn and Ondrej Palat.\n\nTwo-time Calder Cup champion Darren Haydar is the AHL\u2019s all-time leader in playoff goals (63) and points (143), and three-time winner Bryan Helmer has played in more Calder Cup Playoff games (159) than anyone else. Marcel Paille\u2019s 49 playoff victories are the most ever by a goaltender, and Bill McDougall set single-season records that may never be broken when he tallied 26 goals, 26 assists and 52 points during the 1993 postseason with the Cape Breton Oilers.\n\nFour men share the honor of having won the most Calder Cups during their playing careers: Bob Solinger, Les Duff, Fred Glover and Mike Busniuk each skated to five titles.\n\nCalder Cup-winning teams have impacted significantly on the success of their NHL parent clubs. On three occasions an AHL club and its NHL affiliate won their league championships in the same year: In 1976 and 1977, the Montreal Canadiens won the Stanley Cup while their AHL affiliate, the Nova Scotia Voyageurs, won the Calder Cup, and in 1995, the Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils saw their AHL affiliate, the Albany River Rats, win a title as well. In 2008, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins and their parent club in Pittsburgh both reached their respective league Finals, and in 2019, the Charlotte Checkers won the Calder Cup while the Carolina Hurricanes reached the NHL\u2019s Eastern Conference Final.\n\nOnly one team in 86 years has been able to win the Calder Cup in three consecutive seasons: the Springfield Indians, under the leadership of AHL and Hockey Hall of Famers Eddie Shore and Jack Butterfield, skated to Calder Cup championships in 1960, 1961 and 1962."}, {"url": "https://www.amerks.com/news/detail/a-look-back-at-the-1996-calder-cup-25-years-later", "page_content": "A LOOK BACK AT THE 1996 CALDER CUP 26 YEARS LATER\n\nThe Rochester Americans are just a few weeks removed from what proved to be a historic 66th season in the American Hockey League, a year that culminated with one of the team's most impressive playoff runs in nearly two decades. So, it\u2019s only fitting that today marks the 26th anniversary of perhaps the most historic moment in team history.\n\nThe date was June 13, 1996 and the city of Rochester was in jovial celebration of the Amerks\u2019 sixth Calder Cup championship following their thrilling 2-1 win over the Portland Pirates in dramatic Game 7 fashion in front of a standing room only crowd at the downtown War Memorial.\n\nIt was a postseason to remember for the Amerks, who were 11-1 through the first three rounds of the playoffs, including back-to-back sweeps over the Adirondack Red Wings and Cornwall Aces before knocking off the Syracuse Crunch in five games. After overcoming a rather slow start through the first half of the 1995-96 regular season, Rochester, sparked by the dramatically improved goaltending of Steve Shields, came to form midseason and finished the campaign in third place in the American Hockey League\u2019s Central Division. All in all, it was certainly a historic season for the Amerks and one that former captain Dane Jackson will never forget either.\n\n\u201cGame 7\u2026,\u201d recalls Jackson, the Amerks captain that year who summed up the best moment of his professional career in two simple words. \u201cWinning such a tight game and the celebration with guys you go to war with and guys that sacrifice a lot that are truly team guys.\u201d\n\nWATCH: FIRST PERIOD OF GAME 7\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if a lot of people really remember, but we were not a very good team at Christmastime, \u201cadded Jackson, who took his rightful place in the Amerks Hall of Fame during the 2012-13 season. \u201cWe had a lot of good players, but we were one of the lowest teams in the league actually at that point. We had some tough meetings as a group and we all got together. To be a part of that team and see when guys put in that much effort and all the blood, sweat and tears and to come out with a championship is something I\u2019ll never forget. It was a great part of my life and really built a lot of who I am today.\u201d\n\nAfter the Amerks assembled a 2-0 series lead over the Pirates with a pair of home wins, the series shifted back to Portland, where the Pirates responded with a pair of home victories of their own to knot the best-of-seven-game series at two apiece. Rochester regained the series lead after Scott Nichol\u2019s Game 5 overtime winner 4:13 into the extra session proved to be the breaking point, but a 5-1 Portland triumph in Game 6 would again even the series and set the stage for a Game 7, winner-takes-all showdown in Rochester.\n\nWATCH: NICHOL'S OVERTIME GAME-WINNER IN GAME 5\n\n\n\n\u201cMy favorite memory was winning the Calder Cup in \u201996,\u201d said Nichol, who now serves as assistant general manager of the Nashville Predators. \u201cPlaying in the middle of June, wearing shorts to the rink and looking up in the stands and seeing everyone dressed the same way was special. I think we were the last team to be playing in any league and we ended up winning in Game 7. For my career, you learn a lot from those Game 7\u2019s, and you learn how to win in big games, and it carried on throughout my career.\u201d\n\nExactly 26 years ago today, with the contest tied at 1-1 early in the third period, Amerks forward Brian Holzinger broke the deadlock as he converted on his own rebound from the left face-off dot to put the Amerks on top 2-1 in what proved to be the game-winning goal.\n\nPortland goaltender Ron Tugnutt immediately left his crease to dispute the goal with referee Blaine Angus ruling that he was interfered with on the play, but Tugnutt was quickly overruled, and as they say, the rest is history.\n\nRochester then played shutdown mode for the remaining 17:26 before a massive celebration took place on the War Memorial ice, where fans and players alike shared in the moment that is still viewed by many as one of the best in franchise history.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in my life I\u2019ve ever been a champion and it\u2019s just an unbelievable feeling,\u201d said Dixon Ward, who scored Rochester\u2019s first goal in the second period en route to being named the MVP in the playoffs. \u201cIt was a great game and they played so hard, but our guys were so ready to play. This is something I will remember the rest of my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cGetting to Game 7 was actually a blessing since our hiccup was Game 6 when we got blown out,\u201d added Nichol. \u201cIt made us refocus, dig in and play like we have been throughout the playoffs. Game 7 was closer on the scoreboard than on the ice. We were totally in control, especially in the third period.\u201d\n\nWATCH: SECOND PERIOD OF GAME 7\n\n\n\nWhat is even more impressive about the win was Rochester\u2019s defense, anchored by veteran blueliners Doug Houda, Terry Hollinger and Dean Melanson, held the Pirates to just a single shot in the third period on its way to outshooting Portland 37-14 in the contest. That alone proved to be the difference maker for the Amerks, who finished the Calder Cup Finals with a 3-1 record at home and outscored the Pirates 24-22 throughout the seven-game series as Rochester captured its first Calder Cup on home ice in 31 years since the Joe Crozier-led Amerks of 1965. That Amerks lineup also boasted six future Hall of Famers in the likes of Jackson (Class of 2013), Houda (Class of 2011), Scott Metcalfe (Class of 2006), the late Craig Charron (Class of 2008) and veteran forward Dan Frawley (Class of 2003), who returned from retirement and went onto play two more years in Rochester before hanging up his skates for good following the 1997-98 season. Nichol would join the prestigious club in 2017.\n\n\u201cI was really emotional after we won it,\u201d said Metcalfe, the former Amerks enforcer and fan favorite after Game 7. \u201cI\u2019ve never won a championship before and to do it with this great bunch of guys makes it even more special. We had to battle for everything, and we had our chances, but we were able to get the job done and that just shows the character of our team. We held them to 14 shots and one in the third period. That says a lot about our team,\u201d said Metcalfe, who ranks first in franchise history with 1,424 career penalty minutes.\n\nDespite going on to play two more seasons with the Amerks, the 1996 championship would be the last for Frawley, who was among the 11 players to appear in all 19 playoff contests that spring. But when he officially reentered retirement for good following the 1997-98 season, not even the 273 NHL games he spent with Chicago and Pittsburgh would be what he remember most about his career.\n\n\u201cTo finally win the Calder Cup on my third trip to the Finals was special along with my mother and sister being there to watch the game. Our team was certainly not expected to be there that day with the way most of our season went, but by the time spring started we were playing great hockey and it just seemed to steamroll from there. There were so many strong teams in the history of the Rochester Americans and to be a part of one that won the Calder Cup remains a highlight of my career.\u201d\n\nWATCH: THIRD PERIOD OF GAME 7\n\n\n\nDuring the regular season, Charron, in just his first season with the Amerks, would go on to produce his most offensive season in his career, collecting a team and career-high 43 goals and 95 points in 72 games en route to earning team MVP and Scoring Champion honors. He also contributed 17 points on seven goals and 10 assists in 19 playoff appearances, finishing only second in postseason scoring to Ward, who would be later named the recipient of the Jack A. Butterfield Trophy as playoff MVP after leading the Amerks with 35 points (11+24).\n\nHeadlining the team\u2019s rookie class was newcomer Rumun Ndur, who despite putting up just 14 points (2+12) during the regular season, quickly established himself as a dominant, stay-at-home defenseman. By season\u2019s end, the then 20-year-old led the team with 306 penalty minutes, the most by an Amerks rookie since Rob Ray\u2019s record-setting 446 penalty minutes during the 1988-89 campaign.\n\nNdur went onto to spend two more seasons in Rochester before beginning an NHL career that featured stints for the Buffalo Sabres, the New York Rangers at Atlanta Thrashers. The journeyman also had stops in the IHL, UHL and EIHL, but he admitted that nothing in his career would ever amount to winning the Calder Cup with the Amerks in 1996, especially in his first pro year.\n\n\u201cI remember a lot about that day,\u201d recalled Ndur, who has been coaching a AAA team outside of London, Ontario ever since his retirement as a player following the 2009-10 season. \u201cBarrie Moore and I were sitting around our hotel room because our rental leases had expired and we had nowhere else to stay for the Cup run. We were talking about how we were going to be the last hockey game in North America that day since we just watched the (Colorado) Avalanche win the Stanley Cup a couple nights before. I remember having a great pre-game nap and going through the whole pre-game like it was just another game. Obviously we got the right result that night and as a first-year pro it was incredible that we were in that position. I couldn't believe how close we were as a team! One of the greatest feelings of my life was lifting Calder for a lap after the win and hearing the crowd go nuts! Pretty much everything after that was a blur.\u201d\n\nAs one career was just beginning, another, sadly, was ending. Jody Gage, who in 11 seasons became the face of the franchise while capturing the hearts of all Rochesterians, was limited to just 16 games that season due to a knee injury that would soon be the main reason from his transition as player into the front office. Gage was forced into retirement midseason and quickly took the reigns as the team\u2019s assistant general manager, a role that would suit him well in the years that followed.\n\n\u201cIt was a bittersweet, but an unbelievable year all the same for me,\u201d said Gage, who also won Calder Cups with the Amerks in 1987 as well as one with the Adirondack Red Wings in 1981. \u201cIt was my final year as a player, but it allowed me to transition to the front office and have success there. The beginning of the year was tough, but winning it at the end was a great conclusion of my playing career.\u201d\n\nDubbed \u201cMr. Amerk\u201d during his 11-year career in Rochester, Gage finished as the Amerks\u2019 all-time leader in goals, assists, points and games played. He holds the Amerks\u2019 record for game-winning goals in one season (9, 1987-88) and goals/points by a right wing in one season (60/104, 1987-88). Gage is one of just three players to record 500 career AHL goals and 1,000 career AHL points, and his 17 AHL seasons tie him for third in league history. Some of his other AHL accolades include the 1987-88 AHL MVP award and a berth on the First Team All-Star squad. He also earned AHL First Team All-Star honors following the 1985-86 and 1990-91 seasons, a place on the AHL's All-Time Team in 1992 -- as chosen by the media -- and selection as the U.S. Team Captain for the AHL All-Star Game in 1995. Gage also holds AHL records for the two fastest short-handed goals in one game (8 seconds, 3/25/89), the most 40+ goal seasons (7), and the most playoff goals (51) in AHL history.\n\nIn 1999, he was inducted into the Amerks Hall of Fame. On March 19, 1999, Gage and Dick Gamble had their No. 9 retired, joining Norm \u201cRed\u201d Armstrong as the only players in team history to receive that honor.\n\nGage received one of the highest honors of his career in 2006, as he was inducted into the inaugural class of the AHL Hall of Fame. He joined legends Johnny Bower, Jack Butterfield, Fred Glover, Willie Marshall, Frank Mathers and Eddie Shore.\n\nThe celebration continued through the summer months, but nothing compared to the merriment in the days ahead as crowds gathered and lined the streets for the victory parade through downtown Rochester. The masses packed in at City Hall, where over hundreds of loyal fans witnessed then Mayor Bill Johnson present the Amerks with the key to the city and proclaim June 13 to forever be a day of remembrance and celebration in Rochester sports history.\n\n\u201cA lot of years I put in with the Amerks,\u201d recalled Metcalfe. \u201cThat was my third Finals and to finally win it was something that nobody could take away from a young man. Winning was everything. To finally win one was very, very big.\u201d\n\nWATCH: RECAPPING THE 1996 CALDER CUP VICTORY\n\n\n\n\u201cAnytime you win a championship and go through the long, grinding season it forges a bond with your teammates,\u201d said Nichol, who took the Amerks to one more Finals appearance in 2000 before embarking on a 662-game NHL career that featured stops in Buffalo, Calgary, Chicago, Nashville, San Jose and St. Louis. \u201cIt was a tough and a bit of a roller coaster season. We didn't have a great regular season record, but we had a great mix of rookies, veterans, skill guys to role players and Torts (head coach John Tortorella) made all those players accountable. That season game me some lifelong memories and friends. I can't believe it's been 20 years!\u201d\n\nBoxscore\n\nRochester Americans 2, Portland Pirates 1\n\nGame 7, 1996 Calder Cup Finals\n\nJune 13, 1996\n\nRochester War Memorial\n\nScoring:\n\nPortland: 1-0-0\u20141\n\nRochester: 0-1-1\u20142\n\n1st Period:\n\nPOR Goal \u2013 Norm Batherson 4:08 (Richard Zednik)\n\nPenalties \u2013 POR Andrew Brunette 7:30 (hooking), ROC Dan Frawley 7:30 (roughing), ROC Doug Houda 7:36 (hooking), POR 16:42 Stewart Malgunas (interference)\n\n\n\n2nd Period:\n\nROC Goal (PP) \u2013 Dixon Ward 11:07 (Brian Holzinger)\n\nPenalties \u2013 POR Richard Zednik 4:49 (hooking), POR Brad Layzell 10:17 (holding), POR Brad Layzell 12:23 (tripping)\n\n3rd Period:\n\nROC Goal \u2013 Brian Holzinger 2:34 (Dixon Ward, Dean Melanson)\n\n\n\nShots:\n\nPortland: 7-6-1\u201414\n\nRochester: 9-13-15\u201437\n\n\n\nGoaltending:\n\nPortland: Ron Tugnutt (L - 37 shots, 35 saves)\n\nRochester: Steve Shields (W - 14 shots, 13 saves)\n\n\n\nPower Play:\n\nPortland: 0-for-1\n\nRochester: 1-for-4\n\n\n\nAttendance: 7,502\n\nThree Stars:\n\n1.

From an initial meeting with Larry and Darcy last fall and our follow-up with Chief Operating Officer Dan DiPofi, we knew this would be a great fit for our fans and our business, one that we expect will bring exciting, championship caliber performances on the ice for years to come, along with a deeply rooted commitment to our community off the ice as well. Today\u2019s announcement represents another important building block in our growth and commitment to professional hockey in Maine,\u201d said Petrovek and Bullard in a joint statement.\n\n\n\nBefore teaming up with the Pirates, the Sabres were affiliated with the Rochester Americans for 29 seasons, the longest such partnership in professional hockey between an NHL team and its AHL affiliate. During that span, Rochester had a record of 1,137-932-238-13 in 2,320 regular season games (.593 winning percentage) and made the playoffs 24 out of the 29 seasons. The team won its Division title eight times, advanced to the Calder Cup Finals six times, winning the Calder Cup three of those years in 1983, 1987 and 1996. A number of current Sabres players, including Thomas Vanek, Derek Roy,\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are excited to begin our AHL affiliation with the Portland Pirates and the city of Portland,\u201d said Buffalo Sabres Managing Partner Larry Quinn. \u201cI am looking forward to working with Lyman Bullard, Brian Petrovek and Brian Williams, and the entire Pirates organization. I have been impressed with their professionalism from day one and am excited to build our new relationship both personally and professionally.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is a rich history of professional hockey in Portland and we hope to add to that winning tradition,\u201d said Sabres General Manager Darcy Regier. \u201cDuring our tenure with our previous AHL affiliation, our franchise model was to draft and to develop young prospects and build our success from a core group within. With our current roster of players like Jason Pominville,\n\n\n\nThe NHL officially came to Buffalo on Dec. 2, 1969, as part of a two-team expansion, when the league awarded Seymour and Northrup Knox the franchise that would soon be named \u201cSabres.\u201d They chose center Gilbert Perreault as their first draft pick in 1970, after being awarded the number one selection. He, along with wingers Rene Robert and Rick Martin, became known as \u201cThe French Connection\u201d and led the Sabres to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1975, only five seasons after the team\u2019s inception. The team had continued success and made the playoffs for the next ten seasons, five of which where under Hall of Fame coach Scotty Bowman (\u201879-\u201880, \u201881-\u201885). The team experienced great success again in the mid-90s, going through a number of changes in the 1996-97 season. Founder Seymour H. Knox passed away in the spring of 1996 just as the Sabres donned new uniform colors and moved from the storied Memorial Auditorium into the new HSBC Arena where they went on to capture the Northeast Division title. Lindy Ruff, a former Sabres defenseman and left wing, was named head coach at the beginning of the next season and led the team to the Eastern Conference Finals. The team\u2019s success carried over to the 1998-1999 season when the Sabres made the Stanley Cup Finals where they lost to the Dallas Stars in six games.\n\n\n\nTom Golisano brought stability and a renewed excitement to the team when he purchased it in March, 2003. Following the NHL lockout, the Sabres returned to exceed all expectations by recording 52 wins and reaching the Eastern Conference Finals, earning Ruff a Jack Adams Trophy for Coach of the Year. The next season proved to be even better, as the Sabres won a franchise-record 53 games and earned the President\u2019s Trophy in front of 41 sell-out crowds in the regular season. They also sold out the nine home playoff games on their way to the Conference Finals, making it the first time since 1979-80 that every game was played in front of a sold-out crowd. This success on and off the ice earned the organization a nomination for \u201cProfessional Sports Team of the Year\u201d from the Sports Business Journal and Sports Business Daily.\n\n\n\nBuffalo becomes the third NHL affiliate in Pirates history. During its five-year affiliation with the Washington Capitals (2000-2005), the Pirates compiled a .535 regular-season winning percentage and made the playoffs three out of the five seasons. During their three-year affiliation with the Anaheim Ducks (2005-2008), the Pirates compiled a .563 regular-season winning percentage and made two Calder Cup playoff appearances, losing in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals in both the 2005-06 and 2007-08 seasons. During that time, the Pirates averaged close to 5,000 fans per game and attendance grew by over 15 percent. With their NHL affiliate closer geographically, Portland hopes that its fans will invest in the success of the Sabres and the rivalry between the Boston/Providence Bruins will intensify. Pirates fans will be able to watch the Sabres play divisional opponent Boston six times during the NHL\u2019s regular season, giving fans a closer look at their new NHL affiliate.\n\n\n\nThe new long-term agreement between the Pirates and the Buffalo Sabres guarantees professional hockey in the city of Portland through 2011. Since the Maine Mariners inaugural season in 1977, over 1,000 games have been played in front of over 3 million fans at the American Hockey League level. The AHL is the top development league for the National Hockey League and will be celebrating its 73rd season of play next season. Dating back to the days of the Maine Mariners, the American Hockey League has now played hockey in Portland for over 30 years. Only five other teams (Hershey, Rochester, Providence, Springfield and Cleveland) have had an American Hockey League franchise in their city longer than Portland. The Cumberland County Civic Center, the Pirates\u2019 home, has hosted four Calder Cup Champions in 1978, 1979, 1984 and 1994 and the 2003 Dodge AHL All-Star Classic, one of the most successful in league history. \u201cThis is an exciting day for fans of hockey throughout our state to partner with an eastern US city with one of the richest histories in professional hockey dating back to the turn of the century. From an initial meeting with Larry and Darcy last fall and our follow-up with Chief Operating Officer Dan DiPofi, we knew this would be a great fit for our fans and our business, one that we expect will bring exciting, championship caliber performances on the ice for years to come, along with a deeply rooted commitment to our community off the ice as well. Today\u2019s announcement represents another important building block in our growth and commitment to professional hockey in Maine,\u201d said Petrovek and Bullard in a joint statement.Before teaming up with the Pirates, the Sabres were affiliated with the Rochester Americans for 29 seasons, the longest such partnership in professional hockey between an NHL team and its AHL affiliate. During that span, Rochester had a record of 1,137-932-238-13 in 2,320 regular season games (.593 winning percentage) and made the playoffs 24 out of the 29 seasons. The team won its Division title eight times, advanced to the Calder Cup Finals six times, winning the Calder Cup three of those years in 1983, 1987 and 1996. A number of current Sabres players, including Ryan Miller Jason Pominville , and Paul Gaustad, helped Rochester to its best season record in team history when they earned 112 points during the 2004-2005 season.\u201cWe are excited to begin our AHL affiliation with the Portland Pirates and the city of Portland,\u201d said Buffalo Sabres Managing Partner Larry Quinn. \u201cI am looking forward to working with Lyman Bullard, Brian Petrovek and Brian Williams, and the entire Pirates organization. I have been impressed with their professionalism from day one and am excited to build our new relationship both personally and professionally.\u201d\u201cThere is a rich history of professional hockey in Portland and we hope to add to that winning tradition,\u201d said Sabres General Manager Darcy Regier. \u201cDuring our tenure with our previous AHL affiliation, our franchise model was to draft and to develop young prospects and build our success from a core group within. With our current roster of players like Ryan Miller Derek Roy and Thomas Vanek , we have been able to develop our system with positive results. It\u2019s critical for the survival and success of the Buffalo Sabres franchise to continue to add quality, young players that can develop within our system and grow as professionals.\u201dThe NHL officially came to Buffalo on Dec. 2, 1969, as part of a two-team expansion, when the league awarded Seymour and Northrup Knox the franchise that would soon be named \u201cSabres.\u201d They chose center Gilbert Perreault as their first draft pick in 1970, after being awarded the number one selection. He, along with wingers Rene Robert and Rick Martin, became known as \u201cThe French Connection\u201d and led the Sabres to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1975, only five seasons after the team\u2019s inception. The team had continued success and made the playoffs for the next ten seasons, five of which where under Hall of Fame coach Scotty Bowman (\u201879-\u201880, \u201881-\u201885). The team experienced great success again in the mid-90s, going through a number of changes in the 1996-97 season. Founder Seymour H. Knox passed away in the spring of 1996 just as the Sabres donned new uniform colors and moved from the storied Memorial Auditorium into the new HSBC Arena where they went on to capture the Northeast Division title. Lindy Ruff, a former Sabres defenseman and left wing, was named head coach at the beginning of the next season and led the team to the Eastern Conference Finals. The team\u2019s success carried over to the 1998-1999 season when the Sabres made the Stanley Cup Finals where they lost to the Dallas Stars in six games.Tom Golisano brought stability and a renewed excitement to the team when he purchased it in March, 2003. Following the NHL lockout, the Sabres returned to exceed all expectations by recording 52 wins and reaching the Eastern Conference Finals, earning Ruff a Jack Adams Trophy for Coach of the Year.

Knox passed away in the spring of 1996 just as the Sabres donned new uniform colors and moved from the storied Memorial Auditorium into the new HSBC Arena where they went on to capture the Northeast Division title. Lindy Ruff, a former Sabres defenseman and left wing, was named head coach at the beginning of the next season and led the team to the Eastern Conference Finals. The team\u2019s success carried over to the 1998-1999 season when the Sabres made the Stanley Cup Finals where they lost to the Dallas Stars in six games.Tom Golisano brought stability and a renewed excitement to the team when he purchased it in March, 2003. Following the NHL lockout, the Sabres returned to exceed all expectations by recording 52 wins and reaching the Eastern Conference Finals, earning Ruff a Jack Adams Trophy for Coach of the Year. The next season proved to be even better, as the Sabres won a franchise-record 53 games and earned the President\u2019s Trophy in front of 41 sell-out crowds in the regular season. They also sold out the nine home playoff games on their way to the Conference Finals, making it the first time since 1979-80 that every game was played in front of a sold-out crowd. This success on and off the ice earned the organization a nomination for \u201cProfessional Sports Team of the Year\u201d from the Sports Business Journal and Sports Business Daily.Buffalo becomes the third NHL affiliate in Pirates history. During its five-year affiliation with the Washington Capitals (2000-2005), the Pirates compiled a .535 regular-season winning percentage and made the playoffs three out of the five seasons. During their three-year affiliation with the Anaheim Ducks (2005-2008), the Pirates compiled a .563 regular-season winning percentage and made two Calder Cup playoff appearances, losing in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals in both the 2005-06 and 2007-08 seasons. During that time, the Pirates averaged close to 5,000 fans per game and attendance grew by over 15 percent. With their NHL affiliate closer geographically, Portland hopes that its fans will invest in the success of the Sabres and the rivalry between the Boston/Providence Bruins will intensify. Pirates fans will be able to watch the Sabres play divisional opponent Boston six times during the NHL\u2019s regular season, giving fans a closer look at their new NHL affiliate.The new long-term agreement between the Pirates and the Buffalo Sabres guarantees professional hockey in the city of Portland through 2011. Since the Maine Mariners inaugural season in 1977, over 1,000 games have been played in front of over 3 million fans at the American Hockey League level. The AHL is the top development league for the National Hockey League and will be celebrating its 73rd season of play next season. Dating back to the days of the Maine Mariners, the American Hockey League has now played hockey in Portland for over 30 years. Only five other teams (Hershey, Rochester, Providence, Springfield and Cleveland) have had an American Hockey League franchise in their city longer than Portland. The Cumberland County Civic Center, the Pirates\u2019 home, has hosted four Calder Cup Champions in 1978, 1979, 1984 and 1994 and the 2003 Dodge AHL All-Star Classic, one of the most successful in league history.

Bullard remained the majority owner until this winter, when Ron Cain increased his stake in the team and, shortly thereafter, took over CEO duties from Petrovek, who remained president of business development.\n\nChurch said he believes Petrovek retains his ownership stake. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not an owner,\u201d Church said, \u201cso I don\u2019t know for sure.\u201d\n\nCalls to Petrovek, Cain and Bullard were not returned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in a prepared statement, Petrovek said, \u201cMy decision allows Ron to steer the ship on his own course and begin a new journey for the brand and our fans and sponsors as the team prepares for the 2014-15 season.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Cain thanked Petrovek for his service.\n\n\u201cBrian is at the top of his game,\u201d Cain said. \u201cOur loss will be another\u2019s gain.\u201d\n\nCain lauded Petrovek\u2019s success in attracting the AHL all-star game to Portland in 2003 and 2010 and his involvement in civic and charitable organizations. Petrovek has served on the boards of Maine Medical Center, the United Way of Greater Portland and Portland\u2019s Downtown District.\n\nPetrovek was also the face and voice of the team\u2019s difficult and extended lease negotiations with trustees of the Cumberland County Civic Center in 2003, 2010 and 2013. \u201cWe\u2019ll give it three more years,\u201d he said after grudgingly signing a 2003 agreement. \u201cWe will not play in the building three years from now unless it has been renovated or the economic terms are different.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Petrovek flirted with moving the franchise to Albany, N.Y., before agreeing to a two-year extension. After voters approved a $33 million bond in 2011 to renovate the civic center, its trustees reached an agreement with the Pirates on a one-year lease with an eye toward a longer-term deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch a deal, which seemed to be imminent in April 2013, fell apart in August. In September, the team filed a lawsuit and then announced that its entire 38-game home schedule would be played at the Androscoggin Bank Colisee in Lewiston.\n\n\u201cWith any sports team, there\u2019s a certain amount of friction around the guy who\u2019s the face of the organization,\u201d said Chris Hall, CEO of the Portland Regional Chamber of Commerce. \u201cCertainly, the last year and a half has been difficult, but people should reflect on all the good years and the contributions. The city of Portland is well known as a great minor-league sports town. Well, one of the reasons is because of people like Brian Petrovek.\u201d\n\nThe first few months in Lewiston included three sellouts and an average attendance of more than 2,600 fans. The Pirates won a franchise-low 10 \u201chome\u201d games. They ended the season with a 10-game losing streak and an average attendance of 2,185 \u2013 the only one of 30 AHL franchises below 3,000.\n\nA new five-year lease with the civic center was announced in February, after Cain became majority owner and the Pirates dropped their lawsuit against the county-owned facility.\n\n\u201cRon, Lyman and I started talking more definitively about the opportunity and need for change as the ink dried on a new long-term lease with the civic center and the completion of the renovation project,\u201d Petrovek said in his statement.\n\nNeal Pratt, chairman of the civic center\u2019s board of trustees, said he and Petrovek often disagreed, but their relations were never disagreeable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBrian was always a zealous advocate for the team and a tireless promoter of the Pirates brand,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cHe tried to do what was best for his team and his business and I respect that and wish him well.\u201d\n\nPratt said the list of Petrovek\u2019s charitable efforts is impressive.\n\n\u201cHe has done a lot of volunteer work for the community,\u201d Pratt said, \u201cand I think he should be recognized for that.\u201d\n\nIn March 2013, Petrovek pleaded guilty to operating under the influence as part of a deal to avoid jail time after he crashed his Jeep Wrangler into the concrete barrier on Spring Street in Portland. His blood-alcohol content was measured at three times the legal limit for driving.\n\n\u201cWhat his legacy will be, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Church. \u201cMy hope is that people look at the big picture and recognize all the good that has come with his leadership of the organization.\u201d\n\nIn another, unrelated change, the Pirates lost their general manager Monday when Brad Treliving, former assistant GM of their parent NHL club, the Phoenix Coyotes, was hired as GM of the NHL\u2019s Calgary Flames.\n\nGlenn Jordan can be contacted at 791-6425 or at:\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: GlennJordanPPH"}, {"url": "https://thehockeywriters.com/1999-providence-bruins-one-the-ahls-best-teams-ever/", "page_content": "Many long time Providence Bruins fans have a feeling they have not had in years. The 2012-13 American Hockey League (AHL) Playoffs start tonight, April 26th, with the team coming off of a regular season in which they were awarded the Macgregor Kilpatrick Trophy for garnering the most points in the league (50-21-5, 105 points). Consequently, they are viewed as one of the front runners for the Calder Cup this spring; all of this following the 2011-2012 season, in which they did not even make the playoffs.\n\nIf this sounds somewhat familiar, it should. The 1998-99 P-Bruins won the regular season title and ultimately the Calder Cup, following a year in which they had the worst record in the entire AHL. Although Providence has had numerous deep post season runs since 1999 and were regular season champions in 2008, no team has yet to live up to the standard and expectations left by the 1999 squad. With Calder Cup fever starting to crank up in Rhode Island and southeast Massachusetts, now is a better time than ever to reflect on that Calder Cup run.\n\nRebuilding Providence\n\nComing off of the 1997-98 season where the Providence Bruins unexpectedly stumbled to a 19-49-7 (50 pts) record, landing them in last place in the entire league, the team needed to make changes. The Bruins organization was in the middle of one of it\u2019s worst periods in team history since the early 1960\u2019s. Fans were restless and while Boston would continue to disappoint, some pivotal moves were made to revamp Providence for their upcoming season.\n\nOn July 9th, 1998 head coach Tom McVie, an individual with years of coaching experience in the National Hockey League (NHL), World Hockey Association, AHL, and Central Hockey League was fired. Assistant coach, Rod Langway, a long time veteran NHL defenseman, was relieved from coaching duties as well. Only six days later, former Providence Bruins defenseman, captain, and player-assistant coach, Peter Laviolette was hired as the new head coach.\n\nLaviolette, who only had year of head coaching experience at this point, albeit quite a successful one with the ECHL Wheeling Nailers, also had a reputation of being a strong leader as a player. This was exemplified by the fact that he was named team captain of the International Hockey League\u2019s (IHL) 1988-89 Colorado Rangers, the AHL\u2019s 1991-92 Binghamton Rangers, and the 1994 US Olympic team.\n\nThen Boston Bruins general manager Harry Sinden likely made the move to replace McVie with Laviolette, because of the energy he could bring as a young coach trying to make a name for himself on a larger stage than the ECHL. McVie moved to a scouting role in the organization, which he continues to hold to this day.\n\nRoster Overhaul\n\nSignificant changes were made to the forward lines and defensive pairings through a myriad of transactions with other teams and promotions to Boston. The only portion of the team that remained the same was the goaltending duo of starter John Grahame and back up Jim Carey, who was later traded to the St. Louis Blues organization near the end of the season.\n\nThe few skaters returning from the previous season were centermen Randy Robitaille and Joel Prpic, wingers Antti Laaksonen, Aaron Downey, and Jay Henderson. Both Robitaille and Laaksonen would play much larger roles for Providence in the upcoming season for the team. Defensemen Elias Abrahamsson and Mattias Timander were the only returning defensemen from the previous season. Timander permanently left for Boston halfway through the season and Abrahamsson played in only 4 games the playoffs.\n\nLandon Wilson and Cameron Mann, two players who are very familiar to late 90s Bruins fans, were promoted to Boston for a majority of the 1998-99 season. They returned to Providence after Boston was eliminated from the NHL playoffs, to enhance the team\u2019s offense during the Calder Cup run.\n\nNew to the team were centers Andre Savage, fresh out of college from Michigan Tech, and Marquis Mathieu who played under tutelage of Peter Laviolette for the Wheeling Nailers in 1997-98. Winger Jeremy Brown played for the Nailers the previous season as well until being traded to Providence at the very end of the year, making him essentially a new player as well. Eric Nikalus, new from the IHL\u2019s Orlando Solar Bears, joined the new core of forwards.\n\nWinger Peter Ferraro was traded to the Bruins organization from the Hartford Wolfpack, but he played a majority of the 98-99 season in Boston, until joining Providence for the playoff run.\n\nThe most significant alteration to Providence was their defense core, in which the top six were completely replaced with minor league and NHL veterans. Puck moving defensemen Brandon Smith of the Adirondack Red Wings, 10 year minor league veterans Terry Virtue and Steve Bancroft, and veteran New York Islanders defenseman Dennis Vaske joined the team. Jonathan Aitken, a young defenseman fresh out of Major Junior hockey joined the team as well.\n\nThe Providence Bruins Journey to the 1999 Calder Cup\n\nGame by game regular season results:\n\nA majority of their 16 regulation losses came within the first couple months of the season, which makes sense, considering the huge turnover in coaching and player personnel. Even so, as this team was developing it\u2019s chemistry, they still achieved a 16-10-1-2 record by December 18th, 1998.\n\nIt was on December 23rd, 1998 that the team found another level of excellence where they started an impressive 32-3-2-1 run. The P-Bruins outscored opponents 156 to 93 in that span.\n\nBelow is a highlight of the Providence Bruins incredible ability to win games during that stretch, despite being down 3 goals in the third period.\n\nGame Highlights versus Hartford Wolfpack 2/28/1999:\n\nRandy Robitaille and Andre Savage led the team\u2019s offense with (28 goals, 74 assists) and (27 goals, 42 assists) respectively. Brandon Smith (+36) and Terry Virtue (+34) led the defense with a combination of shut down play in the defensive zone and with their knack of injecting offense in to the game with fast puck transition.\n\nNear the end of the season, the Providence Bruins acquired defenseman Jason McBain from the IHL\u2019s Las Vegas Thunder, center John Spoltore from the ECHL\u2019s Louisiana IceGators, and signed winger Steven King. These transactions would turn out to be important acquisitions as both Spoltore and King eventually scored key goals during the playoffs.\n\nBy the end of the regular season, the Providence Bruins set an AHL record for their record of 56 wins, 16 losses, 4 ties, and 4 overtime losses. The scored 110 more goals and allowed 78 fewer goals against from the previous season.\n\n1999 Calder Cup Playoffs\n\nProvidence\u2019s first round opponent in a best of five series was the Worcester IceCats. The Bruins won the series with relative ease winning game one 4-1 and game two 3-1 at home. Worcester fought off the sweep with a 5-3 win in game three, but Providence ultimately took the series with a 6-3 win in game four.\n\nIn the second round, the P-Bruins faced the Hartford Wolfpack. Although this series was a sweep, it did not feel like one. Game one ended 5-4 in double overtime from a Spoltore goal. He went on to score the game winner in the next two games that ended 5-3 and 5-4 in overtime. Game four was a tight checking affair that ended as a 2-1 victory.\n\nThe Providence Bruins then faced the Fredericton Canadiens in the eastern conference finals. The Bruins appeared to be well on their way to sweeping after winning the first two games 6-3, and the third game 5-3 as the away team. Fredericton proceeded to win the next two games 4-1 and 4-0 with great goaltending from Jose Theodore. Just as the series appeared to be swinging back in the Canadiens direction, Providence returned home and won 6-1.\n\nThe Calder Cup final presented the Bruins with the challenge of defeating the Rochester Americans. Providence won the first two games at home, 4-2 and 6-0. Game three went on to become a very memorable point in the series and the entire playoff run. The game went in to overtime tied 2-2 and eventually ended up reaching the third overtime:\n\nOne might say that Steven King frightened the crowd with his goal in triple overtime.\n\nRochester managed to avoid the sweep, by winning game four 4-2.\n\nGame 5 brought the series back to a sold out Providence Civic Center:\n\n(Although the video is rather unclear, it captures the energy from that night, which rivals that of an NHL rink.)\n\nThe Providence Bruins won the Calder Cup with a convincing 5-1 rout of Rochester. Randy Robitaille won the Les Cunningham Award as the most valuable player (MPV) for the overall season, Peter Ferraro won the Jack A. Butterfield Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs, and Peter Laviolette won the Louis A.R. Pieri Memorial Award, for coach of the year.\n\nThe Calder Cup Championship Banner Ceremony:\n\nDuring this memorable playoff run, many die hard Boston Bruins fans embraced this team as their #1. Some hoped it was a sign of the Bruins organization\u2019s growing depth and as a sign of good things to come in Boston. Although this was not the case, this team was certainly a launching point for Peter Laviolette\u2019s NHL coaching career and for numerous players who went on to take depth roles for numerous NHL teams.\n\nThis team is still fondly remembered and held in high esteem by long time Providence Bruins season ticket holders and hardcore fans. The comparisons run rampant between the sudden regular season success of the 2013 team and 1999 team.

Playoff championships attract a huge amount of attention, and in the AHL, teams compete to win the coveted Calder Cup. The Wilkes-Barre Scranton Penguins have made it to the Calder Cup three times, with the first being in the 2000-01 season, the team\u2019s second season.\n\nMaybe you\u2019ve had the chance to watch us play in the Calder Cup, but some may not be that familiar with the championship game. Here\u2019s everything you should know about the Calder Cup.\n\nHow Long Has the Calder Cup Been Around?\n\nThe Calder Cup, like the AHL, precedes the WBS Penguins by a few decades. The first winners of the Calder Cup were the Syracuse Stars in 1937 during the AHL\u2019s first season. However, the actual Calder Cup was not presented to the winning team until the following year when the Providence Reds beat the Syracuse Stars. According to the AHL, the current Calder Cup, made of a sterling silver base and mahogany base, is 24 inches tall and weighs 25 pounds. Plaques on the base of the Calder Cup list the former 20 winners, and as new plaques are added, old ones are put on display at the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Calder Cup has been presented every year since its first in 1937, with the exception of the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of this, the Charlotte Checkers are the most recent Calder Cup champions after the 2019 win of 4-1 over the Chicago Wolves.\n\nFrank Calder\n\nThe Calder Cup was named in honor of Frank Calder, the first president of the NHL and the last president of its predecessor, the National Hockey Association (NHA). Calder maintained his position as president until he passed away in 1943. This is also not the only award to be named in Calder\u2019s honor \u2013 the Calder Memorial Trophy has been awarded to the NHL Rookie of the Year since the 1936-37 season. He has been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame and Canada\u2019s Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nCalder Cup Record Holders\n\nThere are a few teams that hold different records related to the Calder Cup. The team that has won the most Calder Cup championships are the Hershey Bears, with a total of 11 wins. The Hershey Bears have also made it to the finals more than any other team, attending 23 times. Other noteworthy teams include those who have won the Calder Cup the same year their NHL team won the Stanley Cup. This includes the Nova Scotia Voyageurs, who have won the playoffs with the NHL affiliate twice, and the Albany River Rats. In 2008, the WBS Penguins made it to the finals for the Calder Cup, while Pittsburgh Penguins fell to the Detroit Red Wings in the Stanley Cup finals.\n\nThe Jack A. Butterfield Trophy\n\nIn addition to the Calder Cup, another award related to the playoffs is also awarded. The Jack A. Butterfield Trophy is awarded to the most valuable player in the playoffs and is named after the late AHL president Jack Butterfield, who served the longest tenure of any AHL executive. In most cases, the recipient of the Jack A. Butterfield Trophy plays for the winning team, but this isn\u2019t a requirement. So far, the only player to receive the Jack A. Butterfield Trophy is Tim Tookey, who played for the Hershey Bears during the 1985-86 season, when they lost to the Adirondack Red Wings.\n\nFollow Along with the Penguins for the Rest of the Season\n\nWhile looking forward to the playoffs can be exciting, there\u2019s still plenty of time left in the regular season to come out and support your favorite team.

The project was completed in 2014, but following the 2012-13 season, the team\u2019s lease expired and both sides got into a long protracted dispute. The result was the Pirates suing the trustees for breach of contract, forcing the team to play the entire 2013-14 season at the Androscoggin Bank Colisee in Lewiston.\n\nCain became majority owner in Dec. 2013 and worked out a new five-year lease agreement with the trustees less than a month later. Former managing owner/CEO Brian Petrovek, now President of the ECHL Adirondack Thunder, was replaced by Church, who was named Chief Operating Officer.\n\nThe Pirates recently completed the second year of the five-year lease agreement as Cain approached the trustees a few weeks ago about making changes to the lease agreement as an attempt to reduce operating cost. There were discussions about the Panthers purchasing the Pirates in order to keep them in Portland, but no deal could be reached.\n\nThe departure of the Pirates, including the $100,000 exit fee, left many questions about future of the CIA including Portland\u2019s mayor Ethan Strimling.\n\nThe Pirates move to Springfield was paved by the Springfield Falcons, who were sold last month to the NHL\u2019s Arizona Coyotes with the intent on relocating the team to Tucson, AZ for next season.\n\nThe AHL Board of Governors met on Tuesday to give conditional approval to the sale and relocation. The board also reviewed the sale of the Pirates and a vote on the sale and relocation is expected in the next two weeks.\n\nThe Pirates won its only Calder Cup championship during the team\u2019s first season in Portland. The excitement of that season culminated with an estimated 15,000 people gathering in Portland for a ticker tape parade.\n\nChurch spent six seasons as a player for the Pirates (1996-2002) and was inducted into the Pirates\u2019 Hall of Fame in 2012.\n\nThe new team would retain the Pirates name, and incorporate aspects of the original and current logo include mascot\u2019s Salty Pete and Crackers.\n\nThe ECHL, formerly known as the East Coast Hockey League until it absorbed several teams from West Coast Hockey League in 2003, has 28 teams spanning from New Hampshire to Alaska and Florida to Idaho.\n\nThe league, which is one level below the AHL, plays a 72-game regular season schedule beginning in late October and ending in April. The playoffs last through the month of May.\n\nTeams in the ECHL do not have a direct affiliation with NHL teams compared to the AHL where the Pirates were affiliated with the Florida Panthers. An ECHL franchise typically will receive five or six players from an NHL club, allowing for more control over its roster by signing unrestricted free agents.\n\nIt\u2019s cheaper to operate an ECHL franchise compared to the AHL. Unlike the AHL, there is no affiliation fee in the ECHL, and they have limits on roster size and operate under a strict salary cap.\n\nTravel is also compared to this past season after losing Manchester, Worcester, and Glens Falls as part of the new AHL Pacific Division. Last season, five AHL teams relocated from the northeast to California as western-based NHL clubs moved their affiliates closer to home.\n\nManchester recently completed its first season in the ECHL, while Worcester is slated begin in the fall of 2017.\n\nLower operating cost should help drive attendance as they plan to reduce ticket prices and include pricing options for children and seniors.\n\nBefore the puck can even drop in Oct. 2017. The new ownership group still need to apply for an expansion franchise or purchase an existing franchise that will be relocated to Portland. The group also need to reach a lease agreement with the trustees."}]}
