He then managed the Dallas Office Building development operations of Trammell Crow Company from 1978 to 1986. In 1988, he assumed responsibility for Crow Holdings, a real estate investment firm that manages the assets of the Trammell Crow family and other investors. Under his leadership, Crow Holdings has grown to become one of the largest real estate investment firms in the United States.\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nCrow is also known for his philanthropic work. He has donated millions of dollars to charitable organizations and causes, including education, healthcare, and the arts. One of his most notable donations was a $20 million gift to the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, which was used to establish the Crow Center for Asian Art at the Dallas Museum of Art.\n\nPolitics\n\nCrow is a longtime Republican and has been a major donor to conservative political causes and candidates. He helped found the influential anti-tax conservative group, Club for Growth, and currently serves on the board of directors of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.

He has also been criticized for his close relationship with Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, whom he has funded trips for and hosted at his home.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nHarlan Crow was born in 1949 in Dallas, Texas, to Trammell and Margaret Crow.

One of the most notable controversies involves his relationship with Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Thomas has been accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of luxury trips from Crow without disclosing them on his financial disclosure forms. Thomas claims he was told by his wife that the trips did not need to be reported. However, legal ethicists have raised concerns about the potential conflict of interest and the appearance of impropriety. Crow has also faced criticism for his political contributions. He has donated millions of dollars to Republican candidates and causes, including the campaigns of George W. Bush and Mitt Romney. Some have accused him of using his wealth to influence politics and policy. In addition to his political contributions, Crow has been criticized for his real estate development projects. His company, Crow Holdings, has been accused of gentrification and displacing low-income residents in some of its projects. Critics argue that Crow\u2019s development projects prioritize profit over the needs of the community. Despite these controversies and criticisms, Crow remains a prominent figure in the world of real estate and politics. His influence and wealth continue to shape the landscape of both industries.\n\nLegacy\n\nHarlan Crow\u2019s family has a deep legacy in Dallas, Texas.

Fabrice Coffrini | AFP | Getty Images\n\nA nonprofit financed by billionaire George Soros quietly donated $140 million to advocacy organizations and ballot initiatives in 2021, plus another $60 million to like-minded charities. Soros, who personally donated $170 million during the 2022 midterms to Democratic candidates and campaigns on top of that, spread the additional largess through the Open Society Policy Center \u2014 a 501(c)(4) nonprofit that falls under the Soros-funded Open Society Foundations network, according to a copy of its 2021 tax filing, which was obtained by CNBC and is the most recent data available. The Open Society Policy Center also doled out $138 million to advocacy groups and causes in 2020. Two of Soros' children sit on its board, the tax filings and its website show. The donations bring Soros' contributions to political campaigns and causes since January 2020 to roughly half a billion dollars \u2014 at the least \u2014 most of it steered through dark money nonprofit groups and going largely toward political causes aligned with the Democratic Party. Soros' nonprofit donations don't always go directly to political causes. The funds sometimes flow from one of his nonprofits, then to another, before being spent on the advertising, organizing and social media campaigns that directly reach voters. Many of the Open Society Policy Center's 2021 donations weren't necessarily earmarked to help sway the midterm elections, according to the foundation's website. At the same time, Tom Watson, an editorial director at the Open Society Foundations, conceded in an email to CNBC that \"there are definitely some OSPC grants that went to organizations working to combat voter suppression, support voter registration and expand civic participation.\" Those are all core Democratic principles.\n\nComplex network of nonprofits\n\nThe foundation network includes several affiliated 501(c)(4) groups, a type of nonprofit under the U.S. tax code that's allowed to engage in political activities, as well as more traditional 501(c)(3) charitable organizations, its website and tax filing show. All of the nonprofits fall under Soros' Open Society Foundations network, which spans the globe. It describes itself as \"the world's largest private funder of independent groups working for justice, democratic governance, and human rights,\" and it has dozens of offices in the U.S., Europe, Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. It additionally runs the Open Society University Network, which includes more than two dozen colleges across the world, sponsoring research projects through its Democracy Institute, among other initiatives. While not illegal, the complex network of related nonprofits, research funding and charities financed by Soros obfuscates the original origin of the donations. Through the network, Soros has donated more than $32 billion over the years, according to its website. It says it gives \"thousands of grants every year toward building inclusive and vibrant democracies,\" with active projects in more than 120 countries.\n\nWealthy special interests\n\n\"Wealthy special interests and individuals try to hide their influence in elections, including by funding politically active nonprofits, because they know that the messenger matters,\" Aaron McKean, an attorney at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, said. \"Voters have a right to know who is trying to influence elections so that they can make informed choices when filling out their ballot.\" The Open Society Policy Center's budget in 2021 was funded by a single $196 million donation from the Open Society Foundation network, according to foundation officials. An affiliated 501(c)(3) charitable group called the Open Society Institute received a $1.78 billion donation in \"QECL shares\" from the Foundation to Promote Open Society, which was founded and is funded by the billionaire businessman. In the U.S., the Open Society Policy Center donated to a variety of politically active groups and causes since the start of the 2020 election cycle, including $4.5 million in September to Reproductive Freedom for All, according to data from the nonpartisan watchdog OpenSecrets. The campaign backed Michigan's successful ballot initiative called Proposition 3 that enshrined abortion rights into the state's constitution. The group also gave $1 million in 2020 toward a campaign that supported an Oklahoma prison sentencing ballot measure titled Yes on 805. The ballot initiative would have ended repeat sentence penalties for nonviolent offenses in the state; it failed to pass during the 2020 election.\n\nHelping Democrats\n\nThe vast majority of Soros' personal donations during the 2022 cycle went to two super PACs: Democracy PAC and Democracy PAC II, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Both of those groups are run by the billionaire's son Alexander Soros who also sits on the boards of the Open Society Institute and Open Society Policy Center. Politico reported that these PACs were meant to help Democratic candidates and groups in 2022, and in future election cycles. Records show that the Democracy PACs, which by law can raise and spend an unlimited amount of money, donated millions of dollars in the midterms to organizations that actively helped Democrats running for office, including support for the Senate Majority PAC and the House Majority PAC.

Sixteen Thirty Fund: $23.9 million\n\nThe group acts as a \"dark\" money fund for \"progressive changemakers\" and groups that often align with the Democratic Party. It provides operational support, like HR and legal resources, to progressive organizations. It recently raised more than $189 million and made $107 million in grants. Emerson Morrow, a spokesman for America Votes, told CNBC that funding from the Open Society Policy Center \"has provided critical support for America Votes' mission.\" The group says it took on \"voter suppression and engaged new and hard-to-reach voters\" in 2021, focusing on expanding voting access in the key states of Nevada, Michigan and Wisconsin. The Open Society Policy Center's website lists a single donation of $23.9 million to the group in 2021 to \"support nonpartisan voter engagement in multiple states,\" according to its website. America Votes, a 501(c)(4), raised more than $245 million and doled out over $170 million in grants from July 2020 through June 2021, according to its most recent tax disclosure. Its top contributions included a $14 million donation to Family Friendly Action PAC, a super PAC that spent $7.2 million backing Democratic candidates running for Congress during the 2022 election cycle, according to OpenSecrets. It also donated $9.7 million toward Black PAC, a super PAC that spent $9.5 million during the recent midterms supporting Democrats.\n\nEmpowering advocates"}, {"url": "https://www.cantechletter.com/2023/04/the-ten-richest-people-in-alberta-listed/", "page_content": "Alberta\u2019s economy has historically been heavily reliant on the energy sector, particularly oil and gas.

He was also known as a powerful and influential supporter of liberal social causes.\n\nSoros, who was born into a prosperous Jewish family, had his upbringing disrupted by the Nazis \u2019 arrival in Hungary in 1944. The family split up and used false papers to avoid being sent to concentration camps . In 1947 they moved to London. Soros studied philosophy under Karl Popper at the London School of Economics , but he abandoned his plans to become a philosopher. He joined the London merchant bank Singer & Friedlander. In 1956 he moved to New York City , where he worked initially as an analyst of European securities and rapidly made his mark.\n\nFinancial career\n\nIn 1973 Soros established the Soros Fund (later Quantum Endowment Fund), a hedge fund that subsequently spawned a range of associated companies. His daring investment decisions caused the funds to grow rapidly, but not all his gambles succeeded. He correctly foresaw the worldwide stock market crash of October 1987\u2014but wrongly predicted that Japanese stocks would fall hardest of all.\n\nSoros\u2019s status as an almost mythical financier was established in September 1992 when the British government devalued the pound sterling. Through his Quantum group of companies, Soros had sold billions of pounds during the days preceding devaluation, much of it purchased with borrowed money. Afterward Soros bought back pounds, repaid the money he had borrowed, and made a profit of about $1 billion. Others also profited from the pound\u2019s fall, but the scale of Soros\u2019s operations dwarfed those of everyone else, and the gambit earned him the nickname \u201cthe man who broke the Bank of England.\u201d In 1994, however, his instincts appeared to fail him\u2014at least temporarily\u2014as he speculated that the dollar would rise in value against the Japanese yen. Instead, the dollar fell all year, and the Quantum Fund reportedly lost hundreds of millions on a single day in February.\n\nAlthough he denied involvement in speculative attacks on the Thai baht in 1997, Soros\u2019s name was soon linked with the financial crisis that swept Asia the following year. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad singled out Soros, stating that he was responsible for the decline of the ringgit. In reality, Soros\u2019s funds had lost billions as a result of the crisis. Soros recovered with early gains on Internet stocks in 1999, but his investment style became more conservative in the wake of the implosion of the technology bubble in 2000. In December 2002 a French court convicted Soros of insider trading for a 1988 stock deal involving financial services company Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, and he was fined \u20ac2.2 million ($2.9 million). Soros appealed the ruling, but it was upheld by the Cour de Cassation (France\u2019s highest court) in 2006. Facing new federal regulations concerning hedge funds, Soros announced in July 2011 that the Quantum Endowment Fund would no longer manage the money of outside investors. Instead, it would only handle the assets of Soros and his family."}, {"url": "https://www.tonyrobbins.com/giving-back/famous-philanthropists/", "page_content": "10 Famous Philanthropists\n\nThe secret to living is giving. As Tony says, When you serve something greater than yourself, whether it be your family, your local community or at a global level, you discover a deeper purpose and and create more meaning in your life. In the U.S. there is a strong culture of philanthropy \u2013 high net worth individuals who have chosen to donate financial resources to communities and causes that need support. Tony is one of many people making a positive impact in the world by supporting causes that matter to him personally. For years, Tony has given to others, from leading the 1 Billion Meals Challenge with Feeding America (which has helped provide more than 850 million meals so far to those in need), to working with Operation Underground Railroad to prevent child trafficking, Tony\u2019s learned that the key to fulfillment lies in giving. Famous philanthropists make their impact in the world by giving back a portion of their monetary wealth. Even if you don\u2019t have large pools of capital to deploy into nonprofits or other recipients, you can still give \u2013 your time, your energy, or whatever resources you have that you\u2019d like to share. In this way, everyone can become a philanthropist.\n\nYou can make a positive difference in the lives of others right now Start giving back today\n\nWhat is a philanthropist? To find the keys to becoming a philanthropist, no matter your financial means, let\u2019s take a deeper look at the question, \u201cWhat is a philanthropist?\u201d Let\u2019s start with the philanthropist meaning straight from the dictionary: phi\u00b7lan\u00b7thro\u00b7pist /f\u0259\u02c8lanTHr\u0259p\u0259st/ noun: philanthropist; plural noun: philanthrophists 1. a person who seeks to promote the welfare of others, especially by the generous donation of money to good causes. In short, a philanthropist is someone who donates their money, experience, time, talent or skills to help others and create a better world. Though we often think of them as people who have millions of dollars to donate, you don\u2019t have to be a famous philanthropist with a huge net worth to qualify. This is just one of a few misconceptions about how to be a philanthropist.\n\nWhat are the benefits of being a philanthropist? Most philanthropists aren\u2019t in it for fame or recognition. The biggest benefit of being a philanthropist is that it fulfills some of our deepest human needs. We all have these needs: certainty, significance, variety, love/connection, growth and contribution. Which of these needs is most important to us and the ways we go about fulfilling them are what make us who we are. Philanthropy fulfills our need for contribution. Have you ever reached a major milestone in your life \u2013 your dream job, starting a business, financial freedom \u2013 and wondered why you still feel like something is missing? It\u2019s likely because you\u2019re not fulfilling your need for contribution. As Tony says, \u201cIt is not what we get, but who we become and what we contribute that gives meaning to our lives.\u201d Being a philanthropist can actually improve your own life, too. The law of attraction states that we get back the energy we put into the world. By focusing on giving back, making a difference and creating positive change, you\u2019ll create a cycle that brings abundance back to you tenfold.\n\nIs there a difference between charity and philanthropy? Charity is the actual action that is taken to improve someone\u2019s life: stocking shelves at a food bank like Tony\u2019s Feeding America project, building shelters for refugees or providing medical care after a disaster. As an organization, a charity is the entity that coordinates and supplies these on-the-ground services. Philanthropy is what supplies charities with the funds, personnel and equipment they need. So what is a philanthropist versus a volunteer? They share many similarities, but philanthropy is a strategic process in which donations of time, skills and/or money are made in order to address a systemic or social issue.\n\nIs philanthropy considered a career? Yes, you can absolutely build a career in philanthropy. There are many different paths you can take, from grant writingand program directing to corporate social responsibility and cause marketing. You\u2019ll find consultants and CEOs in philanthropy, just as in the typical business world. For a career in philanthropy, you\u2019ll need a few essential skills: adaptability and perseverance, passion, people skills and a growth mindset. The world of philanthropy can be competitive, but is also one of the most fulfilling careers. Looking for tips on how to become a philanthropist? It never hurts to look up to famous philanthropists who are changing the world.

Serve at a soup kitchen or stock donations at a food pantry. Make boxes for a meal delivery service. Volunteer with an after-school program, become a mentor to at-risk youth or work at a community center. Find a local cause that speaks to you and donate your time. Raise awareness What is a philanthropist if not someone who uses their position to help better the lives of others? You may not have as much money as famous philanthropists, but you still have plenty to be grateful for. Advocating for a group less fortunate than yourself is the ultimate way to become a philanthropist without spending a cent. Use your skills or experience Everyone has gifts, and many of those gifts are useful when it comes to how to become a philanthropist. Use writing skills to create marketing materials or write grants for a nonprofit. Teach math or reading to disadvantaged kids. If you have knowledge about a specific topic, like the law, accounting or regulations in a certain industry, use it for good. Set aside a small portion of your paycheck Even five dollars a week adds up to more than $250 per year. Save a small amount each week, then make an annual donation at a certain time of year. Donate school supplies in the fall, holiday gifts in the winter or books for summer reading at the beginning of the break.\n\nFAQs about philanthropists What were the biggest charitable donations in 2020?

While that would still leave them richer than 99 percent of the rest of humanity, it was a jaw-dropping gift. It also wasn't the only jaw-dropping thing Zuckerberg has ever done. Nah, that'd be violating people's privacy like he's auditioning for the Stasi.\n\nIn 2010, Business Insider dropped the bombshell story that Zuckerberg had apparently used Facebook to get inside people's private lives while at Harvard. Back in 2004, journalists at the Harvard Crimson were preparing to run a negative story on Zuckerberg. Desperate to get ahead of the criticism, Zuckerberg reportedly checked for failed Facebook logins by the two journalists \u2014 hoping to find if they had ever accidentally input a password they usually used elsewhere. He then harvested these incorrect passwords and used them to secretly access the journalists' emails.\n\nThat's shady stuff, and while it was a long time ago, it fits in with a pattern of behavior. Between 2010 and 2015, Zuckerberg championed something on Facebook called Open Graph. It gave advertisers nearly unlimited access to your most private data, even if you didn't consent to it. Open Graph was so invasive that Wired has since called it \"the smoking gun\" at the heart of Facebook's privacy scandals."}, {"url": "https://stevemorganfoundation.org.uk/3392-2/", "page_content": "Steve Morgan fought back tears as he recalled how a young cancer patient called George inspired him to become a philanthropist.\n\nThe founder of the Steve Morgan Foundation spoke about his motivation during an interview for Barclays Bank\u2019s \u2018Philanthropy Podcasts\u2019 series with Emma Turner, Director of Barclays Private Bank Philanthropy Service\n\nhttps://privatebank.barclays.com/news-and-insights/podcasts/steve-morgan-podcast/\n\nThe founder of Redrow has given away millions of pounds as part of the Foundation\u2019s Covid-19 Emergency Fund but said the origins of his philanthropy go back a lot further than that.\n\nHe explained: \u201cI always felt that once I was successful, if you like, and had surplus funds, that I should try and do my bit to help people like the ones I grew up with in the areas I grew up in.\u201d\n\nHowever, as he stepped down from Redrow for the first time in 2000, it was chance meeting with a boy called George that changed his life.\n\nHe told Philanthropy Podcasts: \u201cI\u2019d sacrificed my last three years\u2019 salary at Redrow so I didn\u2019t take a penny in salary. I gave every everything to Alder Hey Hospital where they were building a children\u2019s oncology unit.\n\n\u201cI raised a considerable amount towards that oncology unit. I went on a 365 mile walk across the Pyrenees, trying to set a Guinness World Record. We actually raised \u00a3365,000, which back in 1998 was a lot of money.\n\n\u201cThe one trigger was a young boy called George. I have a photograph in the Foundation offices of myself with young George, who was four years old. He had lost all his hair with chemotherapy.\n\n\u201cOn the day we were setting off a number of the children came to a Liverpool Airport to wave as off. The sister on the ward, who I\u2019d got to know very well, pulled me to one side and said, \u2018I\u2019m not sure that George is going to be here when you get back\u2019. Even to this day, I fill up thinking about it.\n\n\u201cOn the second day of the walk it was driving a blizzard. It was freezing cold. We were probably 1,500m up in the Pyrenees. We started our daily walks at 6am and walked through to about 6pm or 7pm at night. It was relentless.\n\n\u201cThe team were saying, \u2018you know, why don\u2019t we just ease off today?\u2019 And I just remembered George and it was George who took us through that day. It was a horrible day. When I came back, I think from that moment onwards, I always thought I\u2019d do something special for charity.\n\n\u201cWhen I stepped out of Redrow in November 2000, within six months I set up the Foundation that set us off on our way.\u201d\n\nGeorge tragically died but the entrepreneur founded the Steve Morgan Foundation in 2001, to support charities that help children and families, people with physical or learning disabilities, the elderly, or those that are socially disadvantaged in Merseyside, Cheshire and North Wales.\n\nHe has donated assets totalling \u00a3300m in that time.\n\nMorgan said his tough upbringing in Liverpool shaped his philosophy around helping those less fortunate than himself.\n\n\u201cI saw poverty with the kids I went to school with,\u201d he said. \u201cI had good parents and so I was always turned out reasonably well, as well as they could afford, but around me, I used to see a lot of kids who lived in abject poverty.\u201d\n\nThe father-of-six said American financier George Peabody, who is widely regarded as the father of modern philanthropy, shaped his principles.\n\n\u201cOne of the people whom I respected the most in the philanthropy world is George Peabody from the Peabody Trust. He did so much to house the poor people of London and his legacy lives on to this day. My background, of course, is in housing.\u201d\n\nMorgan said he stepped in to launch the Steve Morgan Foundation Covid-19 Emergency Fund in March 2020 after being inundated with calls from struggling charities for help.\n\n\u201cIt became pretty obvious within a matter of days that we were looking at a crisis here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were looking at the precipice. We said \u2018look, we can\u2019t let this happen, we can\u2019t let our charities just fold after all these years\u2019.\n\n\u201c Within days of the lockdown we announced a Covid-19 Emergency Fund, pledging up to \u00a31m a week.\u201d\n\nAsked what he gets out of philanthropy he said: \u201cI think a sense of pride that I\u2019m in a lucky position of being able to give something back.\n\n\u201cOne of the highlights of the year is the Christmas party for disadvantaged and disabled children. There are around 325 children and their carers in the function room and I love being amongst the kids the whole afternoon.\n\n\u201cMost have never been to a Christmas party like it, we have a Santa, a grotto and all sorts of kids\u2019 entertainment. Every child has a slap-up meal and leaves with a present. Dozens and dozens of young kids come to me and say this is the best day of their lives. It chokes me up, to be honest. I\u2019m just a big softie, really.\n\nMorgan said he also loves visiting some of the charities which the Steve Morgan Foundation supports.\n\n\u201cI get so inspired by some of the people who give their lives over to working for others,\u2019 he said. \u201cAnd I come away and think \u2018well, I do nothing compared to some people who literally seven days a week are helping others\u2019. What I do get is a great deal of satisfaction that we help them to help others.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.startuptalky.com/biggest-philanthropists-list/", "page_content": "The wealthiest human is the one who believes in giving and sharing.

However, it\u2019s mostly associated with individuals who show their love for their fellow man in a specific way, namely through sharing their wealth. More specifically, the term is usually reserved for extremely wealthy individuals who use their good fortune to help others. History is full of such people.\n\nSome choose to share their fortune due to their religious convictions. At other times, a billionaire who started out poor and then benefitted from a good education might want to ensure others get the same opportunities they enjoyed.

And in many cases, their legacies are still felt today. So, here we have some of the most wealthy and selfless generous men \u2013 and women \u2013 of all time:\n\n1. George Peabody has been named the father of modern philanthropy as well as the ultimate rags-to-riches success story\n\nMassachusetts\u2019 own George Peabody is widely-cited as the father of modern philanthropy. That is, he has been credited with inspiring countless wealthy individuals to give some \u2013 or indeed, all \u2013 of their fortunes away to worthy causes. Peabody is also regularly cited as the ultimate American success story. Indeed, his is the ultimate rags-to-riches story, and he was able to die a happy, honorable man.\n\nPeabody was born into poverty in the small town of South Parish in 1795. He left school at 11 and then went to work as an apprentice in the local general store. Here, he learned skills and habits that would stay with him for the rest of his life: hard work, diligence, and the importance of being responsible, honest and honorable. Staying in retail, he went on to manage a store in Georgetown and then, at the age of 20, he had risen to become a partner in a wholesale dry goods business.\n\nFor around 20 years, Peabody worked in Baltimore, establishing himself as a leading international merchant and financier. His work regularly took him to Europe and then, in 1837, he made the decision to make a life in London. It was in the British capital that he went into banking, setting up the house of George Peabody and Company. In later years, he would take on a certain J.P. Morgan as a partner.\n\nIt was only as he neared retirement that Peabody realized he didn\u2019t want to die rich. So, he started giving away millions of dollars. Through gifts and legacies, he helped fund a number of educational projects, both in Britain and the United States. Then, when his nephew went to Yale, he decided to establish the Peabody Museum of Natural History at the prestigious university. This was soon followed by the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard.\n\nWhen Peabody died in November of 1869, he was granted the honor of being interred in Westminster Abbey for a short while (a right usually reserved for kings and queens). His body was finally brought back to his hometown \u2013 which had been renamed Peabody in honor of its most famous, and most generous son."}, {"url": "https://www.humanrightscareers.com/issues/what-is-a-philanthropist/", "page_content": "What does it mean to be someone committed to the public good?

A philanthropist is someone who uses their wealth to support charitable causes such as anti-poverty initiatives, humanitarian aid, and other development projects. In this article, we\u2019ll discuss the history of philanthropy, its pros and cons, and how anyone \u2013 regardless of their class status \u2013 can embrace the spirit of philanthropy.\n\nPhilanthropists are typically rich individuals who use their wealth to establish or support charitable causes and institutions like foundations, hospitals, museums, libraries, and more. While the spirit of philanthropy is meant to be selfless, modern philanthropy does face its fair share of criticism.\n\nA short history of philanthropy\n\nThe word philanthropy comes from the Ancient Greek philanthr\u014dp\u00eda, which translates to \u201clove of humanity.\u201d According to the National Philanthropic Trust, many cultures embraced the ideals of philanthropy, including ancient Greece, China, and India. Many religious traditions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and Native American spirituality) also taught about the importance of kindness and selflessness. For many centuries, churches and communities were primarily responsible for charity. In the 18th century, however, a new form of giving began to emerge. In 1739, businessman Thomas Coram noticed a high number of abandoned children on London\u2019s streets. He spent the next 17 years calling for a children\u2019s home until King George II finally signed a royal charter that established the Foundling Hospital. Many believe this to be the first incorporated charity. Its work continues today through The Coram Foundation.\n\nPhilanthropy also has a long history in the United States where it historically included financial giving, as well as volunteering and organizing. Groups would donate money, organize events, and call for social and political progress. Wealthy individuals also became extremely influential in establishing universities, fine arts institutions, hospitals, and more. George Peabody, who was born in 1795, is often called \u201cthe father of modern philanthropy.\u201d He was a merchant banker who dedicated his life to giving away as much money as possible. His philanthropic endeavors included libraries, museums, and the Peabody Education Fund, which supported education for Southern children following the Civil War. The Peabody Awards are named after him. Peabody\u2019s life served as the model for famous philanthropic billionaires like Andrew Carnegie, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, and others.\n\nPraise and criticism of philanthropy\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to deny the inherent good of philanthropy when it\u2019s defined as the love of humanity. However, are philanthropists doing good work all the time? Or is there a darker side to their charitable giving? Like all things, philanthropy has its pros and cons. Here are some of the most commonly praised and criticized aspects of philanthropy:\n\nPraise: Philanthropists can support causes that aren\u2019t getting funding elsewhere\n\nThe vast majority of charities don\u2019t receive enough funding. NGOs typically operate with very tight margins and depend on private donations, which can ebb and flow. Wealthy philanthropists can play a crucial role in supporting causes that are struggling to gain donations. Their large financial gifts can lift organizations out of the red and attract media attention, which in turn can attract more donations. This is especially important for causes that are historically underfunded, such as the rights and well-being of girls and women. According to reporting from Fast Company, nonprofits focused on girls and women received only 1.6% of all charitable giving between 2012-2015. Philanthropists are in a position to fill in funding gaps and raise awareness of underfunded organizations.\n\nPraise: Philanthropists can inspire more giving\n\nWhen philanthropists announce their large donations, it can set off a domino effect of giving from other wealthy philanthropists. Research supports this theory of \u201ccontagious\u201d giving. In one 2013 study, the amount people gave in an online fundraiser appeared to affect how much others gave after them. In 2010, Bill Gates, Melinda Gates, and Warren Buffet announced the Giving Pledge campaign and began recruiting other wealthy individuals. As of December 2021, 231 people from 28 countries have signed on. If these billionaires and millionaires can fulfill their pledge of giving away most of their wealth and inspire others to do the same, that\u2019s a lot of money that goes to charity.\n\nCriticism: Philanthropists can use their wealth to exert control\n\nOne of the most serious criticisms of philanthropy is that it allows society\u2019s wealthiest people to call all the shots at the expense of everyone else\u2019s voices. As scholar Rob Reich explained in 2018, big philanthropy is \u201can exercise in power\u201d and whenever that power extends to the public, \u201cthe response it deserves is not gratitude but scrutiny.\u201d A post on The Conversation provides a specific example of how philanthropic giving weakens democracy without necessarily solving anything. In the 1990s, foundations began focusing on education reform in the United States. Billions of dollars have been poured into the philanthropists\u2019 ideas about school choice, performance-based evaluation, and more. As the article points out, however, most people weren\u2019t asking for philanthropists to swoop in and save them. For all the money devoted to reform, not much has improved, either. This is a tale of well-intentioned, but ill-informed philanthropists without experience in education taking the reins away from the public. When it comes to issues that affect all of society \u2013 like education \u2013 why should the voices of the wealthy matter the most?\n\nCriticism: Philanthropists don\u2019t fix systemic issues\n\nWhen philanthropy consists of mostly just large donations, it\u2019s like filling in holes in a sinking boat. The boat is still sinking; plugging the holes has perhaps only delayed the inevitable. The real solution \u2013 getting the boat back to shore where it can be properly repaired- can only be done through systemic changes to institutions and policies. Many philanthropists ignore the complex political, social, and cultural roots of the causes they focus on, or, as we described above, they prioritize their own ideas about progress. In some cases, wealthy philanthropists are actually contributing to the systemic flaws or causing harm in other ways. They\u2019re poking new holes in the ship while simultaneously trying to fill in others.\n\nHow anyone can be a philanthropist\n\nToday, most people think of philanthropists as the wealthiest people in society giving away lots of money. With this narrow definition, philanthropy quickly becomes muddled with reasonable criticisms about motivation, power, and impact. What if we took philanthropy back to its roots and thought of it through its basic meaning: the love of humanity? With this definition, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you can give $10 to charity or $100 million. Your time becomes just as available as your money, as well. A philanthropist is someone who cares about others and uses the resources they have. Here\u2019s how to embrace philanthropy in your own life:\n\nBe strategic\n\nYou can do philanthropic things without a strategy (i.e. giving money to organizations a few times a year), but if you want to make philanthropy more of a habit and identity, it\u2019s a good idea to approach it strategically. That can mean setting up recurring donations to a nonprofit, arranging your schedule so you can volunteer regularly, and encouraging people you know to donate or volunteer with you. A good strategy ensures you don\u2019t get distracted or burned out.\n\nResearch the causes and organizations you care about\n\nWhen it comes to giving money and time, you don\u2019t want to feel like you\u2019re wasting either. To feel confident in the causes or organizations you\u2019re considering giving to, research is important. If an organization is a registered nonprofit (in the United States, that makes it a 501(c)(3) organization), it has to make financial reports available to the public. These forms give you a clearer idea of how much money is used for overhead versus programs and campaigns. Research also helps you choose organizations with high levels of trust.\n\nConsider joining an organization\n\nThere are millions of charitable organizations working around the world. If you want to invest your time and skills into supporting causes, joining an organization in a paid or unpaid role is a great option. Even if you\u2019re only able to commit to a few hours a week, you\u2019re living in the spirit of philanthropy.\n\nConsider forming your own group\n\nIf you see a problem that isn\u2019t getting a lot of attention or funding, consider forming your own group. The group can focus on supporting larger organizations committed to the cause or perform more hands-on work in your community. You may want to keep the group fairly informal and small, or maybe you have ambitions for official legal status. Whatever your hopes are, running a group can be very challenging, so plan carefully and ask advice from other activists and philanthropists if you don\u2019t have a lot of experience.\n\nStay open-minded\n\nMost people are more than happy to jump at the chance to do good in the world, but philanthropy can be complicated. As we\u2019ve described, there are potential problems that arise from philanthropic giving and trying to fix the problems in society. If you want to be a philanthropist, keep in mind that your initial ideas may not be the best ones. Stay open-minded and willing to collaborate with people, especially people who belong to the communities you want to help. At the end of the day, their voices are the ones that matter the most. The best philanthropists are the ones ready to listen to those most impacted by their decisions.

Directed by Jesse Dylan, who for several years did video production work for Soros\u2019s philanthropic organization Open Society Foundations (and also directed an \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d sequel), the film boasts interviews with Soros, his adult children and various humanitarians who have worked with him. It\u2019s light on biographical detail. While we hear about Soros\u2019s upbringing and influences (like his father or the philosopher Karl Popper), the most insight we get into his business career is in an anecdote about how he reacted to news of financial troubles at Rolls-Royce.\n\nBut even as hagiography, \u201cSoros\u201d is unfocused; it races from topic to topic, with clips that seem arbitrary at best. (To describe the atmosphere at the fall of the Soviet Union, why not cut to James Hetfield of Metallica?) \u201cGeorge always feels an individual can make a difference, and doesn\u2019t hesitate to try,\u201d says Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general, in an interview, offering a typical platitude. Soros is forthright in acknowledging that his wealth has made such difference-making easier. It hasn\u2019t, however, made him a dynamic movie subject.\n\nSoros\n\nNot rated.
