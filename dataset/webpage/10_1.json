But she died young, one spring in the mating season. This sometimes happened. A woman left the village and never returned.\n\nThe old crones said, \"A crazy man got her. Hu! The lot of women is difficult!\"\n\nIn any case, Nia and her brother were alone. Suhai, who was one of her mother's sisters, took them in. She was a large gruff woman with a pelt so dark that it looked more black than brown.\n\nBesides taking them, she took their mother's belongings: the tent, the cart, the six bowhorn geldings, and all the tools of iron, bronze, and stone.\n\n\"A just payment,\" Suhai told them. \"You will cost me a lot in the winters to come. I have children of my own to care for, too.\"\n\nHer brother Anasu, who was eight then, said, \"You have always been a grasping person.\"\n\nSuhai glowered. \"Go outside. I don't want to look at you.\"\n\nAnasu made the gesture of assent, then stood. The flap of the tent was up. She could see her brother clearly. He was slender and graceful. His pelt was reddish brown. It shone like copper in the sunlight. He wore that day \u2014 she thought she remembered later \u2014 a kilt of dark blue cloth, high boots, and a belt with a silver buckle.\n\nAnasu left. Nia looked at Suhai, sitting hunched by the fire, which was out.\n\n\"Thank the Mother of Mothers I have no sons. Well, I intend to do that which is right. I'll raise him, though I don't expect to enjoy a moment. You, Nia, will be less trouble, I am sure. The women of our family have always been even-tempered.\"\n\nNia made no reply.\n\nThings turned out as Suhai had expected. She got no pleasure from raising Anasu, though he was clever and dexterous. No lad his age did better embroidery. He was good with a bow. He was good-humored, too, except around Suhai. The two of them always quarreled.\n\nNia stayed out of the quarrels. She was, she discovered, a timid person. Good for little, she told herself. She could not help Anasu, though she felt closer to him than to anyone; and she could not stand up to Suhai. Always and always she did what her aunt wanted.\n\nLike all the people in the world, her people followed the herds. In the spring they went north to the Summer Land: a wide, flat plain. There were many small lakes and shallow rivers. On days when Suhai let her go free, she and Anasu built fish traps out of the branches of a bush that grew at the edges of the rivers. The branches were thin and flexible.\n\nThey could be woven around one another, then tied with pieces of stringbark.\n\nThey put the traps into a river. Then they sat on the bank and talked till a thrashing in the water told them a fish was caught.\n\nWhen he was in a dreamy mood, Anasu talked of flying. The large clouds of summer looked habitable to him.\n\n\"Not the thunderclouds, of course, but the others. I don't think they'd be good for herding. They have too many hills. But I could take my bow up there. We know there is water. Maybe there are fish.\"\n\nShe listened, not saying much. Anasu was two years older than she was. He always had more to say.\n\nIn fall the village went south: the herd first, guided by the adult men. Then came the carts, the women and children, and the very old men. Hisu, the bow master, was one of these.\n\nThe Winter Land was a rolling plain dotted with trees. In the south were stony hills. Beyond the hills was an enormous body of water.\n\n\"Our salt comes from there,\" Anasu told her. \"Some of the men, the really adventurous ones, stay here alone in the summer. Hisu told me this. He did it when he was young. He waited till the herd was gone, then crossed the hills. On the other side are smaller hills, made of sand, and then the water. It stretches to the horizon, Hisu said, like the plain in the Summer Land; and it tastes salty. Anyway, he made pans out of wood. There is no wood nearby, he said. He had to bring it from the hills of stone. Hu! What a lot of work! Anyway, he filled the pans with water. When the water dried, there was salt in the pans.\" He looked at her, excited by this bit of information and wanting her to be excited, too.\n\nNia made the gesture that meant she heard and understood.\n\nAnasu made the gesture that meant \"if that's the way you feel about it.\" Then he said, \"I think I'll gather salt when I'm a man.\"\n\nThere was something hard in her throat. She never liked to think of growing up.\n\nThe years went by. When she was ten, Suhai began to teach her how to work iron. This made her happy, she told Anasu.\n\n\"You ought to have started a year ago or maybe two years back. Suhai is always grudging and slow.\"\n\n\"Nonetheless, I am happy,\" Nia said. \"Suhai is good at what she does.\"\n\n\"In the smithy, maybe. Elsewhere, no.\"\n\nAnasu grew tall. His body began to thicken. Suhai really hated him now.\n\n\"I have never liked men. Even when I was full of the spring lust, I still thought they were awful. I'm tired of coming home and finding you in my tent.\"\n\nAnasu, who was fourteen by this time, made the gesture of assent. He gathered his belongings \u2014 the kilts, the boots, the one long cloak for winter \u2014 and left. His bow was in its case over one shoulder, and his knife hung from his belt.\n\nNia stood up, shaking. \"Enough is enough, old woman. I won't tolerate you any longer. I'm going, too.\"\n\n\"Very well.\" Suhai sat down by the fire. Dinner was cooking in a big pot. She pulled out a hunk of meat and ate it.\n\nNia began to pack.\n\nShe walked out of the tent, feeling proud. For the first time she could remember, she had done something important on her own. What next? She didn't know. She stopped and looked around. It was late summer. The day was hot and still. Smoke rose straight up from the village's cooking fires. In the distance the yellow plain shimmered. She had no idea at all of what to do.\n\n\"Nia?\"\n\nIt was Ti-antai, her cousin: a plump woman with dark brown fur.\n\n\"Anasu told me he has left my mother.\"\n\nNia made the gesture of affirmation. \"So have I.\"\n\n\"That terrible woman! She will end by driving everyone away. My grandmother told me once, Suhai ought to have been a man. She is too quarrelsome to be a woman. Come stay with me, for the time being anyway.\"\n\nNia made the gesture of agreement.\n\nShe stayed with Ti-antai on the trip south. Then, when they reached the Winter Land, she moved in with Hua, an ancient woman whose children had all died. Her tent was empty, and she needed help at her forge.\n\n\"A good exchange. You help. You keep me company. I will teach you the secrets of gold and silver. I know them, you know. There was a time when I was the best smith in the village. I'm not so bad these days, either. My hands have gotten a little stiff, of course, and my eyes aren't what they used to be. But what is, after all? In any case, I will teach you how to inlay silver into iron. And gold, too. Move in whenever you like.\"\n\nAnasu traded his best piece of embroidery for two pieces of leather. From these he made a tent, a small one. He lived by himself at the edge of the village. That winter Nia saw him little.\n\nIn the spring, on the trip north, he rode near Hua's cart and helped with the bowhorns. One of them was a young male, strong but reluctant to pull.\n\nBy this time Anasu was full grown. He was quieter than he used to be, though still good-tempered.\n\nOne morning, midway through the trip, Nia woke a little earlier than usual. She got up and went outside. They were camped next to a river. Mist drifted on the water. The sun was just beginning to show above a range of hills in the east. She went to the cart. The back panel was fastened with hinges and chains. It could be let down, so that loading and unloading could be done more easily, and it could be fastened halfway down, making a flat place. Anasu slept on it. He had thrown off his cloak sometime in the night. He lay on his back, one arm over his face, shielding his eyes. All at once Nia saw her brother clearly. He was large and solid. He looked shaggy, rough, a little unfamiliar. The change was coming. She felt a terrible grief.\n\nHe woke and stretched. \"Hu! Am I stiff!\"\n\nShe thought of hugging him, but decided no. She would have to explain why she did it. Instead, she went to start the fire and make breakfast.\n\nThat summer Nia tried to spend more time with Anasu. But he was restless, silent. He liked to hunt and fish alone. When he was in the village, he worked at making arrows or on finishing a large piece of embroidery. It showed a man with large curving horns: the Master of the Herds. On either side of him were bowhorn does. Above him was the sun and a pair of birds.\n\n\"Don't bother him,\" Ti-antai said. \"He is getting ready for the change. If you want to do something for him, work on his parting gifts.\"\n\nNia made the gesture of assent.\n\nThe summer was rainy and unusually short. The sun was still pretty far to the north when the birds began to leave.\n\n\"A bad winter,\" Hua said. \"I'll ask the tanner what she wants in exchange for a good fur cloak. Now, we'd better start packing.\"\n\nJust before they left the Summer Land, the sky cleared. For two days it was bright and warm. Anasu came to her then. \"Let's go catch fish.\"\n\nThey made traps and set them in the river. Then they sat on the bank. Already the leaves on the bushes were starting to turn yellow. The sun was hot. A river lizard sat on a nearby rock. Head up, it watched them carefully. Under its chin was a bag of skin, orange in color. Once or twice, it inflated this and croaked.\n\nAnasu picked up a twig and broke it into pieces. \"I'm getting more and more irritable. There are days, Nia, when I can barely stand people. I think \u2014 the next one that comes near me I will hit.\"\n\nThe change, Nia thought.\n\n\"I decided to tell you this. I want you to know, if I leave suddenly or get violent, it is because I cannot keep control any longer.\"\n\n\"We all know this.\"\n\nHe made the gesture of disagreement suddenly, violently. \"You cannot know. My bones are on fire. It's like a fire in a peat bog that never goes out. I have never felt worse than this, even when our mother died.\" He stood up. \"I'm not going to stay here, Nia. Good-bye.\"\n\nHe walked away. Nia sat awhile looking at the river. A fish thrashed in the water where they had set one of their traps. She waded out to get it.\n\nOn the trip south she barely saw him. Once or twice, through the dust, she got a glimpse of a young man riding. It might have been him. One evening he came to their tent. His fur was rough and dull. His clothes were dirty. He sat down across from them and helped himself to dinner. Old Hua, who was usually talkative, said nothing.\n\nAt last Nia said, \"How are you?\"\n\nHe looked at her blankly. His eyes were not pure yellow, she noticed. There was orange around the pupils. She hadn't remembered that.\n\nHe made the gesture that meant neither good nor bad. Then he went back to eating. After he was done, he left.\n\n\"Finish up your gifts,\" old Hua said.\n\nShe did. The last one was a buckle made of iron, covered with silver. It showed a bowhorn fighting a killer of the mountains.\n\n\"Not bad,\" said Hua. \"You will do me proud someday.\"\n\nNia made the gesture that meant a polite or modest refusal to agree.\n\n\"You have too little self-respect,\" Hua said.\n\nThe trip ended. The people set up their tents next to the Brown River. North of them there was a stone ridge. Its lower slopes were forested. To the south, across the river, was the plain: rolling, tree-dotted, late summer yellow. The herd was pastured there.\n\nThere was no sign of Anasu. Nia felt uneasy.\n\n\"He will come,\" Ti-antai said. \"No man leaves without his parting gifts \u2014 unless, of course, the change drives him crazy. But that rarely happens.\"\n\n\"You are not always a comfort, cousin.\"\n\nAt first the weather was dry. Then it began to rain. Every day there were a few drops at least. Most days it rained or drizzled for hours. The air was cold. Hua said her bones ached. Nonetheless, she kept busy.\n\nOne afternoon they were both at the forge. Nia worked the bellows for Hua, who was making a long knife: a parting gift for Gersu, the tanner's son, who was a little younger than Anasu.\n\nWhen the hammering was done and the blade was in cold water, Nia set down the bellows. She rubbed her neck.\n\n\"Nia.\" It was Anasu. His voice sounded hesitant.\n\nNia looked around. He stood nearby, holding his bowhorn's reins. He looked worse than ever: shaggy, muddy, confused.\n\n\"Anasu?\"\n\n\"I \u2014\" He stopped for a moment. \"I have come for the gifts. I am going across the river.\"\n\nShe made the gesture of acknowledgment, then the gesture of regret.\n\n\"You stay here,\" Hua said. \"No one will bother you. We'll pack everything.\"\n\nThey went inside. Hua put wood on the fire, then set a pan of milk to heat.\n\nNia got out the new saddlebags the tanner had made, then the cloth she had gotten from Blind Angai, the weaver, in return for a new pot. She or Hua or Ti-antai had made most of the rest of the things. She laid them out one by one: the new knife, the kettle, the brass needles, the awl, and the long-handled comb, the kind that men used to comb the hair on their backs.\n\nWhat else? She was having trouble thinking.\n\n\"The new belt, ninny!\" Hua was packing food: dried meat, dried berries, bread.\n\nAt last they were done. Hua poured the milk into a cup. They took the saddlebags to Anasu. It had begun to rain a little. He was standing where they'd left him, looking nervous. His bowhorn, sensing the nervousness, kept moving, turning its head, flicking its ears, tugging at the reins.\n\nJust as they reached Anasu, he yanked the reins and shouted, \"Keep still, you!\"\n\nThe bowhorn bellowed and reared. Anasu pulled it down. He grabbed the saddlebags from Nia. A moment later he was astride the bowhorn. He bent and slapped the beast on one shoulder. The bowhorn began to run.\n\n\"Anasu!\" Nia cried.\n\nHe was gone.\n\n\"Men!\" said Hua. \"They always make a spectacle. And here I am with this cup of milk. I meant to give it to him. Well, it will do me as much good.\" She took a swallow.\n\nNia made a groaning sound, then doubled her hand and began to beat one thigh.\n\n\"That is right. Get the grief out of you.\"\n\nNia kept hitting her thigh.\n\nAs Hua had predicted, it was a bad winter. It was cold, and there was a lot of snow. Nia wondered how Anasu was doing. She prayed to the Master of the Herds, asking him to protect her brother.\n\nAt the time of the solstice Gersu went crazy and had to be driven out of the village. Afterward, his mother took his gifts across the river. She hung them from the branches of a big tree. Maybe he would find them and take them. Most likely, not.\n\n\"He always had a bad look in his eyes,\" said Hua.\n\nNia made the gesture of agreement.\n\nSpring came early. The plain turned pale blue. The bushes along the river put out yellow blossoms. Nia felt almost happy.\n\n\"You see,\" said Hua. \"We get over everything.\"\n\n\"No. I don't believe that.\"\n\n\"You will see.\"\n\nThe mating season came. Ti-antai, who had just finished weaning her last child, felt the spring lust and left. Nia moved into her tent and took care of the children.\n\nTen days later Ti-antai returned. She looked rumpled and relaxed. \"Well, that's over.\" She stretched and yawned.\n\n\"Did you see Anasu?\"\n\n\"Of course not. Nia, what's wrong with you? He must be far to the south with the other young men. I didn't get down there.\" Ti-antai rolled a blanket into a pillow, then lay down. She yawned again. \"I got a big fellow, half a day's ride from here. He does good carving. He gave me a salt horn full of salt. Hu! Do I need to sleep!\"\n\nNone of the women had met Anasu, but none of them had gotten very far south. They had all mated with older men, who had their territories close to the village.\n\n\"Don't worry,\" said Hua. \"In a year or two or three someone will meet him and tell you.\"\n\nNia made the gesture that meant she understood. As she made the gesture, she thought \u2014 there was something wrong. Something out of balance. Why were people so often lonely?\n\nThey went north to the Summer Land. Once settled there Nia looked around for new friends. She had spent too much time with Anasu. She had relied on him too much.\n\nShe picked the younger Angai to be her friend. Angai was the daughter of the shamaness. She was a thin, clever girl, often sarcastic. But she knew many interesting things: the uses of plants, the meaning of flights of birds. Like Nia, she was lonely.\n\n\"I have many skills,\" she told Nia. \"But not the skill of friendship. How terrible!\"\n\nNia looked at her. Was she being sarcastic? Yes. Her mouth was twisted down at one corner, a sign that she didn't really mean what she had said.\n\nAt midsummer, at the festival, they got drunk together and fell asleep in one another's arms.\n\nIn the late summer Nia made a necklace for Angai. Every link was a bird made of silver.\n\n\"Wonderful!\" Angai said. She hugged Nia, then put the necklace on. \"Everyone in the village will envy me!\"\n\n\"You think too much of other people's opinions.\"\n\nAngai looked irritated, then said, \"That may be.\"\n\nFor a day or two after that Angai was standoffish. Then she came to Hua's forge and brought a gift. It was a salve that made any burn stop hurting.\n\n\"It's my mother's own recipe. I made it this time. My mother says it's good.\"\n\nNia took the jar. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Can we stop fighting now?\"\n\nNia laughed. \"Yes.\"\n\n(Continues\u2026)"}, {"url": "https://blackgate.com/2020/01/17/vintage-treasures-a-woman-of-the-iron-people-by-eleanor-arnason/", "page_content": "Covers by Gary Ruddell\n\nEleanor Arnason is the author of five novels, including The Sword Smith (1978), To the Resurrection Station (1986), Daughter of the Bear King (1987), and Ring of Swords (1993), plus dozens of short stories, chiefly in her Hwarhath series, SF tales of mankind\u2019s interactions with the sole other species we find able to travel among the stars. But her most famous book is the first contact novel A Woman of the Iron People, which won both the inaugural James Tiptree Jr. Award in 1991, and the 1992 Mythopoeic Award. Publishers Weekly called it \u201cexcellent, anthropologically oriented SF\u2026 an intelligent, provocative book,\u201d and at Tor.com Jo Walton wrote:\n\nIt\u2019s definitely Arnason\u2019s masterpiece and I love it. A Woman of the Iron People is anthropological science fiction, in the tradition of The Left Hand of Darkness and Mary Gentle\u2019s Golden Witchbreed and Janet Kagan\u2019s Hellspark. Lixia has come on a spaceship through cold sleep to a new planet, one that has aliens\u2026. A Woman of the Iron People also won the Tiptree Award, and this is easier to understand without any parables, because it really is a book with a focus on gender. The aliens live separately \u2014 the women live in usually nomadic villages, raising children. The men leave at puberty and live alone, fighting each other. They mate with the women in the spring. These are their accepted customs and their biological imperatives, but we see several edge cases\u2026 Lixia travels with Nia, and later with the Voice of the Waterfall, a male oracle, and Derek, another human anthropologist. They travel through culture and landscape, learning them both. It\u2019s great that these future humans are also strange and also bring problems of their own to the story\u2026 Unlike almost all the other anthropological SF out there, the end of the journey and connecting up with the main expedition raises more questions than it solves, and there\u2019s a twist at the end of the book that I thought was wonderful.\n\nRead Jo\u2019s complete review here.

It also won the inaugural Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature and came in third in the 1992 John W. Campbell Memorial Award. Even in the Before Times, when computers were coal-fired and USENET still ruled the interwebs, A Woman of the Iron People got very good word of mouth \u2026 so it has been a considerable source of irritation to me that despite decades of bookstore browsing, I had never seen a copy of the hardcover or the split paperback versions (of which more later).\n\nHuzzah for Open Road Media, which offers a very affordably priced edition! Huzzah for my various electronic devices, which allow me to read said edition!\n\nDespite some very impressive efforts, humanity has failed to transform Earth into an anoxic, lifeless desolation (which says a lot for Earth, given the rampant resource plunder and widespread pollution in the backstory). Moreover, a surprisingly sensible humanity has spent centuries trying to undo the damage it did in the 20th century. About a century before the book begins, humans even managed to build and then send a sub-light starship to Sigma Draconis. This sun-like star is not too far from good old Sol on a galactic scale; but it is unimaginably far on a human scale \u2026 which is why it took a starship travelling at a good fraction of the speed of light more than a century to reach its destination.\n\nLike the sun, Sigma Draconis has an Earth-like companion world, and like Earth, that world has intelligent inhabitants. Humanity\u2019s first interstellar voyage is also going to be its first contact with aliens.\n\nHawaiian-born Lixia is one of the field researchers landed on the surface of the world (robotic exploration was considered, but rejected as contrary to the spirit of the expedition). It doesn\u2019t take her too long to make contact with one of the natives, Nia of the Iron People. While it will take a while for Lixia to understand enough about the aliens to understand that she has been lucky, she will eventually realize that she was fortunate to make contact with a female alien and not one of the males.\n\n\n\nNia and her people have mastered herding, metal working, and agriculture. Their technologies are fairly advanced compared to those known to the humans of the Paleolithic period (which lasted for 2.5 million years). However, to the human explorers, products of a very atypical period in human history, Nia\u2019s people and their kinfolk appear backward. The explorers, having learned something about the alien life cycle, speculate that the backwardness is due to aspects of alien biology and that this is as far as the aliens can advance.\n\nNia\u2019s people are remarkably human appearing, given that their lineage and ours have absolutely no genetic connection and differ markedly at the biochemical level. Behaviorally, they\u2019re more akin to elephants than they are to humans1. Males of reproductive age are argumentative and solitary in their habits. When they encounter other males, they fight over territory. They approach women only in the mating season. All of the arts requiring community, therefore, are the province of women, who live in tribes and villages.\n\nAs Lixia discovers, this is only as accurate as any simplistic description of an entire species behavior, which is to say that there is tremendous regional variation and even within societies there are lots of exceptions. In the eyes of her colleagues up in orbit, where the low resolution model seems compelling, the aliens\u2019 gender divide and life cycle mean that they can never advance past the point of villages and herds. A town can only become so large before the mating system becomes unworkable.\n\nOr perhaps the aliens could advance past that point with some sort of help from the visiting humans. Argument ensues: should the humans teach the aliens anything? Is that benevolence or foolish interference? If one were to teach, what to teach? The humans cannot reach consensus and the arguments cast a stark light on incipient divisions within the starship\u2019s crew.\n\n~oOo~\n\nYou can really tell that this was written before the final absolute and irreversible triumph of capitalism over all competing ways of thought, blessed be the name of Adam Smith. The ship\u2019s crew includes many flavours of Marxist, a lot more than one would expect in a book of more recent vintage. These days you might see the odd Trot lurking in the bushes (as those wily Trots are prone to do) \u2026 but more than likely, you would not.\n\n\n\nYou can also tell that the novel was written before we began discovering exoplanets in great numbers.\n\n\n\nA word about covers: writers generally get no say about what cover gets stuck on their book. Presumably, assuming the art director isn\u2019t just grabbing cover art out of a box at random, the art selected is art the director feels will enhance the odds that someone, somewhere, will purchase the book in question. I cannot believe that the art director at William Morrow (or the SFBC, who reused the art, or Avonova, who used the same art for the first paperback, A Woman of the Iron People: In the Light of Sigma Draconis) selected the best cover to hint at the novel\u2019s anthropological allure.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe art for the second paperback, A Woman of the Iron People: Changing Women is a bit more effective at conveying the essence of the book.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, the Italian edition reminds us that cover art can always be worse. Or, to quote Malvina Reynolds, \u200b\u201cthere\u2019s always a bottom below.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nI suspect that readers will find the parts about Nia\u2019s people more interesting than the discussion by the humans how to deal with Nia\u2019s people. I also suspect that the arguments re interference that assume no further contact is an option are pointless. There\u2019s no realistic way that the humans can avoid continuing interaction with Nia\u2019s people; even returning to Earth requires resources from Nia\u2019s world. About the only way to avoid further contact (with all its consequences, good and bad) would be to fly the ship and its crew into the star. Nobody is proposing that.\n\nThe crew is tempted to assume that the alien culture is monolithic: there are no cultural or individual differences. That\u2019s not true for humans (who are extremely culturally and individually various); as it turns out, it\u2019s not true for Nia\u2019s people either. In fact, Nia herself turns out to be something of an outlier. She is hardly the only one. The aliens are more capable of innovation and adaptation than the humans suspect. Not to mention the fact that there is archaeological evidence (ancient carvings) that the alien past was not as static as the humans assume2. There\u2019s no reason to think that aliens will be less behaviorally complex than humans3. In this novel, they aren\u2019t.\n\nI waited a quarter of a century to read this book.

It\u2019s deeply anthropological, weaving more than an entertaining story of aliens and first contact\u2014but also providing commentary on nature vs. nurture, gender roles, foreign cultures, and the consequences of outsider intervention.\n\nWhen a starship detects life on the planet Sigma Draconis II, anthropologist Li Lixia is called to investigate. Upon her arrival, she\u2019s confronted by an alien society unlike the one she left behind on post-apocalyptic Earth: Here, males and females live separately, reuniting only for the spring mating season and ritual gift-giving. But while the men live in forced isolation, the women exist within organized tribes\u2014each one named after their particular skill set\u2014and lead self-sufficient, nomadic lives. Despite their relative power, not every woman likes these arrangements, and we're eventually introduced to one female alien rebel, Nia.\n\nAs Lixia gets to know her subjects\u2019 language, myths, and other customs, she begins to question the purpose of her space mission.

A purchase through our links may earn us a commission.\n\nEleanor Arnason's 1991 novel A Woman of the Iron People won a Mythopoeic Award for Adult Fantasy, and tied for the inaugural Tiptree Memorial (recently renamed the Othewise Award). It was also a finalist for the John W. Campbell Memorial, and a Locus for Science Fiction novel. The Mythopoeic is generally awarded to fantasy in the style of the Inklings (a literary group whose most prominent members were Tolkien and C. S. Lewis). This is science fiction, but there are also elements that are fantasy, at least from a human scientific perspective. The image to the right is the current e-book, available in multiple formats. If you want a print copy you'll have to search for it used. In years prior it was common that novels were serialized in periodicals like Astounding/Analog, Fantasy & Science Fiction, Galaxy, etc, then later were issued in print. In this case the full novel appeared in hardcover first, then a year later the two individual parts came out in separate paperbacks. I don't think any of it was ever in a magazine. I'll provide cover images for the paperbacks below which may aid in your search in case you prefer print. Set on an unnamed planet orbiting Sigma Draconis, approximately 18 light years from Earth in the Constellation of Draco, it details a first contact story as several humans interact with the planet's indigenous humanoid species. The Earth they come from is definitely post-apocalyptic, both post-war and post-climate disasters, with the US and other countries having been balkanized into various smaller territories. But things were improving, technology-wise, as well as growing cooperation among the scattered groups. This is the first extra-solar expedition, a 40 year journey in cold sleep. Due to the space-time continuum, if they began a return journey right away at least 200 years would have passed on Earth. By the end of this book we don't know if anyone did return.\n\nThe hardcover featured artwork almost identical to that pictured to the left, which is the paperback of Part One, \"In the Light of Sigma Draconis.\" The woman is Li Lixia, sociologist, anthropologist, and linguist. She takes many chances, and defies several recommendations from the council still on board their space ship, in order to remain embedded with the natives she has encountered, particularly a female named Nia who had been exiled from her tribe. The natives are humanoid but furry, sort of a cross between humans and apes, signifying a similar evolution, although later Lixia thought of a large male as more like a bear. It is hard for Lixia to determine their gender, since the female's breasts are not prominent except when nursing, and male genitalia are not noticeable either, and most wear kilts or robes anyway. They mate just once a year, in the spring, when females are in estrus. Females remain in the villages, along with both male and female children, but the males leave when they enter the Change, puberty. They set up camps around the perimeter of the village, the females coming to them in order to mate. There is no taboo against siblings mating, but there is between mother and son. When the males are no longer virile they return to the village, otherwise they take care of the herds of bowhorns, used for riding animals, as pack animals, and as a food source.\n\nThe story elements that attracted attention for the Tiptree/Otherwise (devoted to examinations of gender) include some villages where the females have sex together, even if they also mated with the males, as well as Nia's particular experience. The mating season was strictly for that, otherwise males and females remained apart. Enshi was a male from Nia's village, who some might say was effeminate, clinging to his mother and reluctant to leave at the time of the Change. He didn't care for hunting, or herding. He did leave the village though, was forced out actually, and later encountered Nia one spring. They lived together for a while, Nia bearing two children, until Enshi was killed by another male, whom Nia killed in revenge. Because of her relationship with Enshi, Nia was branded a pervert and banished from her village. Nia is of the Iron People, trained as a smith. When Lixia first meets her, Nia is living with a tribe of the Copper People. She has a smithy, a forge with bellows, hammer and anvil, but her smith and dwelling hut is some distance from the main village. Lixia and seven other humans were set down on the planet to observe, then cautiously interact with the natives if it was deemed safe. Even though there are different tribes, with slightly different customs and language, there is a trading language used between them. Each village has a shamaness, and in several cases they have rivals who wish to become the shamaness. One such conflict leads to Lixia being escorted from the village to Nia's hut. By that time Lixia had picked up enough of the language to communicate with Nia, who decides it is time for her to return to the pastures in the west.\n\nOnly the first chapter of Part One, and the last in Part Two, are written in third-person. All the others are in first-person, Lixia being the narrator. Each chapter title is a name, the first being Anasu, Nia's brother, but Nia is featured more than he is. It's more of an explanation of the mating rituals than anything else. The same applies to the third chapter, Enshi, with Nia relating their story to Lixia. The fourth chapter is about Derek, another of the Earth researchers. Since the native culture is so female-centric, all the other human males had been driven away from the villages, and they had returned to the ship. Derek had been able to avoid such conflicts for the most part, and he joins Lixia and Nia in the trek west. They encounter other villagers, one of whom is aware of Nia's \"crime,\" and brands the humans as demons. They are able to extricate themselves from that predicament, then later have to contend with the brothers of that villager, whom they are able to convince they were the innocents in the encounter. The fact that those brothers, triplets, cooperated with each other and kept in close contact made them almost as much perverts as Nia.\n\nPart Two is \"Changing Women.\" In the first chapter they meet Tanajin, a woman who provides ferry service across a wide river, which is also spotted with several islands. Tanajin is like Nia, one of the changing women in this society, since she has also maintained a relationhip with a male, Ulzai. Lixia and Derek have recorders that capture all they see, hear, and speak in their reports, a device to transmit the information to the ship, and a radio to maintain contact with the ship. The ship's council thinks it is time to recall them, and Lixia and Derek are directed to meet the recall shuttle near a large lake to the south. Ulzai takes them in his boat, but there is an accident due to a large aquatic reptile. The boat capsizes, and all are separated. Lixia finally makes it to the recall location, where Derek had already ended up before her. Instead of going back to the ship right away, many other human scientists had come down to the planet, and it was decided to make a more formal approach to the natives, to ask if the humans would be allowed to stay. That wouldn't have worked at all if Nia had not been able to reunite with Lixia. Nia considers the humans strange, and not just because they don't have fur. Multiple clashes of culture and expectations later, as much as she cannot understand Lixia, she still considers her a friend, and wishes to continue the friendship. It's possible most people relate to the humans in a science fiction story rather than the aliens, but in this case my favorite is Nia."}, {"url": "https://nebulas.sfwa.org/award/best-novel/", "page_content": "Nebula Awards Nominees and Winners: Best Novel\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\n2016\n\n2015\n\n2014\n\n2013\n\n2012\n\n2011\n\n2010\n\nNote: results for years may continue to next page."}, {"url": "https://tertulia.com/article/the-2023-nebula-awards-finalists", "page_content": "Other than maybe Burning Man, we can't think of many places that could bring together an orc warrior, a witch and an ultra-intelligent octopus species in one place.

I'll separate them accordingly.\n\n\n\nOn the whole:\n\n\n\nThe part of it that's a story about how humans must take into account their natures and how they interact with the world when exploring something new to them is wonderful. This book portrays the discussions we should be having. I'm even happy that they didn't come to any conclusions, just arguments and debates that couldn't be resolved. I pretty much never understood Lixia's position on the debates, because she was so much less a person and much more an anthropologist. You could compare her narration to the narration of Ursula LeGuin's Always Coming Home and see parallels, I'm sure. So while this book had a lot of great discussion of what do we as humans do when we are faced with a new species, it didn't have a lot of character development that would appeal more to me.\n\n\n\nBits and pieces:\n\n\n\n1. I would be perfectly happy to never read the word \"crazy\" again. Not only was it a serious overuse of a word, it's a bad word to use without specifying why you mean \"crazy\". Being labelled with that is ableist, frustrating, and who even knows what that means? It could mean something different from person to person. It's author laziness in explaining so many pieces of this culture with this word. It's aggravating.\n\n\n\n2. Author laziness in generalizing human people to their cultures - their very 1980s specific stereotypes.\n\n\n\n3. Cultural references that I assume by the time we figure out space travel are not going to be the dominant cultural references. Part of world-building is making the culture the explorers come FROM seem real, too, and all I could tell about the cultures these humans inherited was that... the United States was no longer united? Something something \"aboriginals\" in California (which is another terrible term and specific to a place that is NOT California), and people from Hawaii have somehow negotiated huge family units, not with multiple generations but with many parents and many offspring together. But there was plenty of references to Marxism, socialism, capitalism, 1960s-70s cultural references, theorists, philosophical writers of the 19th century... Did just nothing happen between 1980 and let's say 2020 when this ship was able to built? If you aren't going to develop the histories further than a specific point in time, don't name historical cultural things all the time. Leave it all general.\n\n\n\nI think that's all I can keep thinking about this book. It was fine, exploring the new place through human eyes was fascinating, but those bits and pieces really, really bothered me, so I'm unlikely to come back to it."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/art/Nebula-Award", "page_content": "1965 novel Dune Frank Herbert\n\nnovella (tie) \"The Saliva Tree\" Brian W.

There, he trains for years in Latin, Ancient Greek, and Chinese, all in preparation for the day he'll enroll in Oxford University's prestigious Royal Institute of Translation \u2014 also known as Babel.\n\n\n\nBabel is the world's center for translation and, more importantly, magic. Silver working \u2014 the art of manifesting the meaning lost in translation using enchanted silver bars \u2014 has made the British unparalleled in power, as its knowledge serves the Empire's quest for colonization.\n\n\n\nFor Robin, Oxford is a utopia dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge. But knowledge obeys power, and as a Chinese boy raised in Britain, Robin realizes serving Babel means betraying his motherland. As his studies progress, Robin finds himself caught between Babel and the shadowy Hermes Society, an organization dedicated to stopping imperial expansion.

Le Guin,\" said Locus. It won both the Mythopoeic Award and one of the first annual James Tiptree Jr. Awards, and received widespread review attention.\n\nRing of Swords takes place on a larger canvas, the entire civilized galaxy in the 22nd century. For nearly fifty years, humanity has been in conflict with a spacefaring race of warlike humanoid aliens, the only advanced and intelligent race thus far encountered in the exploration of space. Humans hope to avoid interstellar war with this enigmatic race, and have set up the first diplomatic talks with them on an isolated and strategically unimportant planet.\n\nBiological researcher Anna Perez has a grant to study the huge, jellyfishlike aliens who live in the seas on this far planet. As the talks begin, she learns that the alien diplomats have a translator, Nicholas Sanders, who to the astonishment of all is the first human turncoat. Anna becomes involved in a plot to kidnap him.\n\nSo begins a story of deepening conflict, complicated by racial and sexual roles, attitudes toward aggression, and misunderstood customs haunted by the spectre of an unimaginable war, a complex tale of the future that confirms Eleanor Arnason's place among the leading SF writers of the decade.\n\nEleanor Arnason was born in New York City in 1942. Her mother, Elizabeth Hickcox Yard, was a social worker who grew up in a missionary community in western China. Her father, Hjorvar\u00addur Harvard Arnason, was the son of Icelandic immigrants and an art historian. She grew up in New York, Chicago, London, Paris, Washington DC, Honolulu, St. Paul, and Minneapolis. She received a BA in art history from Swarthmore College and did graduate work at the University of Minnesota, before quitting to learn about life outside art museums and institutions of higher learning. She made her first professional sale in 1972 while living in the Detroit inner city. Since then she has published six novels and over fifty works of short fiction. Her fourth novel, A Woman of the Iron People (2001), won the James Tiptree, Jr. award for gender-bending science fiction and the Mythopoeic Society Award for adult fantasy. Her fifth novel, Ring of Swords (1995), which is now an Heirloom Books reprint, won a Minnesota Book Award. Since 1994 she has devoted herself to short fiction. Her story \u201cDapple\u201d won the Spectrum Award for GLBT science fiction and was a finalist for the Sturgeon Award. Other stories have been finalists for the World Fantasy, Hugo, and Nebula Awards, and for the Sturgeon and Sidewise Awards. Her collection Big Mama Stories, from Aqueduct Press in 2013, was on the Tiptree award honor list. Her 2017 collection, Hwarhath Stories: Transgressive Tales by Aliens (also from Aqueduct), was on the Tiptree award honor list and nominated for the Philip K. Dick Award. She lives in Minnesota and is currently a full time writer. Her interests include politics, economics, bird-watching, and hanging out in local coffee shops.\n\n\"About this title\" may belong to another edition of this title."}, {"url": "https://oceanofpdf.com/authors/eleanor-arnason/pdf-epub-ring-of-swords-hwarhath-1-download/", "page_content": "[PDF] [EPUB] Ring of Swords (Hwarhath, #1) Download by Eleanor Arnason.

At a Chicago convention decades ago, Gene Wolfe said that every time he encounters people who say the most important things happen within their heads, he wants to put them in a small boat on the ocean in the middle of the storm. This connects to my prejudices about mainstream literary fiction.\n\n\u2018\u2018I\u2019ve always read science fiction and fantasy and murder mysteries. I was an English major most of the way through college, and I read The Great Gatsby and Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and some of Proust in French, so I got a reasonable background in mainstream literature. But it didn\u2019t interest me the way that science fiction did. My problem with realism is that a realistic novel about the psychological problems of middle-class people is a story which is very similar to the life I\u2019m leading, and thus is not too interesting. Whereas the minute you throw in a dragon or global warming, it becomes very interesting. Internal thoughts become much less important, and you basically want to deal with the dragon.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2018\u2018My father\u2019s parents came from Iceland to North America, and I grew up in a house full of books on Norse mythology, the Icelandic sagas, and the novels of the great 20th-century Icelandic writer Halld\u00f3r Laxness. (I have a copy of his novel Independent People inscribed to my father. Laxness misspelled my father\u2019s name.) I have a thing about Iceland, especially the medieval lit\u00aderature, and I have come to love Icelandic folklore. Hidden Folk, which came out early in 2015, is a collection of stories based on Icelandic folklore and literature.\n\n\u2018\u2018Icelanders don\u2019t have princes and princesses \u2013 Iceland was too poor for royalty, even in folktales. Instead, there are trolls, elves, ghosts, outlaws, and ministers who study the black arts. Hidden Folk is very much my own version of Icelandic tales. My elves are unpleasant upper-class types. My trolls are poor farmers and workers, barely surviving. My humans are a mixed lot: farmers and farmwives, students of the magical arts, slaves, a writer, a cop. Over the years, I wrote five Icelandic fantasies \u2013 six since the collection was published, and I\u2019m work\u00ading on a seventh.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2018\u2018Science fiction and fantasy have the appeal of strangeness, and of course science and technology are enormously important in science fiction. SF has been dealing with global warming consistently, while the presidential candidates have barely men\u00adtioned it. There\u2019s no question that it\u2019s happening, and it\u2019s going to be devastating. James Lovelock, who came up with the Gaia theory, has said we\u2019re going to be down to a billion people by the end of the century.\n\n\u2018\u2018I read a lot projections of the future, and people never factor in enough. They project a population of nine billion, but they don\u2019t factor in the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse \u2013 famine, war, dis\u00adease, and death due to climate change. All they\u2019re doing is a projection of where we\u2019ve been. Science fiction, when it\u2019s good, will pick up a whole bunch of these ideas at once. There was a panel at the 2016 Minicon about writing SF in which many things are changing, rather than just one. One of the things that makes me crazy about much hard SF is, you\u2019re in the future with unbelievable physics that nobody now can understand\u2026 but everybody has names like Brad and Charles and they\u2019re living the way we live now. That is nuts. Charles Stross\u2019s early novels had more things happening than I could keep track of. They were stunning.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2018\u2018Writing Ring of Swords was a lot of fun \u2013 it\u2019s the fastest I\u2019ve ever written a novel, and the first separate hwarhath story, \u2018The Hound of Merin\u2019, was also written at about the same time as the novel. Ring of Swords was going to be the first of a trilogy, and I wrote the second volume, but it was turned down by the publisher. It\u2019s really hard to sell the middle book of a trilogy by itself, so I put it to the side. There were problems with the sequel, and I\u2019m not happy with the way it turned out. (I now have a contract with Aqueduct Press for a revised version of the sequel, so it will finally come out.) I was frustrated with the trilogy, and I had a lot more information about the hwarhath, so I started writing short stories. These turned out to be stories written by hwarhath authors after they en\u00adcountered humanity, not only about the hwarhath, but about them thinking about their own culture, and in some cases thinking about humanity. The hwarhath are extremely rigid in many ways, and meeting a species very much like themselves but with different rules for male and female behavior leads the brighter among them to question what is the nature of men and women, and that underlies a lot of the stories.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2018\u2018I have an alien species I\u2019ve written a few stories about, the Goxhat, which are another attempt to look at social stereotypes or maybe ideas of self. In the early part of their culture there were teams, which would be a bunch of Goxhat hatched out of the same clutch of eggs. Each team thought of itself as \u2018I,\u2019 and no individual thought of itself as an individual. They come in four sexes, and a team could be all four sexes or one sex, and it\u2019s all \u2018I.\u2019 My story \u2018Knapsack Poems\u2019 is about the Goxhat early in their history. As their culture evolved, their sense of \u2018I\u2019 got bigger, until the whole species became \u2018I.\u2019 They know that they are different bod\u00adies, but they don\u2019t have a clear sense of themselves as individuals. They\u2019re spacefaring, and they meet other species that don\u2019t have their sense of oneness, so the problem becomes how the Goxhat can think about other species. They meet something that isn\u2019t part of the \u2018I\u2019 \u2013 and what do they do about a species that is millions of \u2018I\u2019s?\u201d\n\nRead the complete interview in the September 2016 issue of Locus Magazine.

It may be useful for the tasks of reading smith's signatures, in-depth research on various schools of sword making, smith's lineage, general interest in the history of Nihont\u014d.\n\nOrigin & Sources\n\nThis index (as many other swordsmith databases in English) is based on 4 most well-known and popular directories of sword smiths:\n\nHawley's Japanese Swordsmiths by W.M.Hawley (English) [1]\n\nT\u014dk\u014d Taikan by Kazuo Tokun\u014d (Japanese) [2]\n\nNihon Toko Jiten by Matsuo Fujishiro (Japanese, English) [3][4]\n\nNihonto Meikan by Junji Honma (Japanese) [5]\n\nW.M.Hawley's book is undoubtedly the most influential so far, due to its importance across English-speaking sword appreciation community, accessibility (written in English) and systematic approach which gives each smith record a unique ID. These IDs became a widely spread point of reference to particular smiths in modern Western sword literature. Due to its popularity Swordsmith Index of Nihonto Club inherits Hawley's IDs where possible.\n\nThis project would never have happened without admirable amount of work put in by the authors and contributors of the first electronic smith databases: To-Show database, JSS/US Nihonto Knowledge Base, Robert Cole's Sho-Shin website and works of many other authors (a complete list can be found in Bibliography section).\n\nHow accurate and complete is the Index?\n\n100% of the Index have been manually verified against at least one of the smith directories listed above. It's possible that some mistakes were made during the data entry. I'm fixing them as soon as they are reported. If you notice any, please leave a comment.\n\nOne of the most important features of the Swordsmith Index is availability of complete references to literature and online resources for almost every piece of information. Japanese swords knowledge and attributions may be highly subjective. It often relies on spurious historical records which were re-invented many centuries ago in order to overstate the prominence of particular blades and smiths. Legends and folklore shouldn't be discounted either.\n\nReliance on the classical sources listed above provides reasonable guarantee of data quality. As a rule of thumb, the more references and individual extant swords are mentioned in the smith record, the more accurate the record is.\n\nIn regards to the coverage, this is an approximate comparison, sorted by size:\n\nHawley's - 30000 records (brief, duplicates and spurious records exist)\n\nNihonto Meikan - 23000 records (brief, w/references, doesn't include modern smiths)\n\nSwordsmith Index - 12300(*) (brief, full text descriptions to grow over time)\n\nT\u014dk\u014d Taikan - 3700 records (short textual information, oshigata)\n\nNihon Toko Jiten - 1500 records (detailed textual information, oshigata, only the most prominent smiths of Koto and Shinto eras)\n\n(*) Note: this number may grow\n\nVerified records usually provide at least as much detail as Hawley's and Meikan. The Index doesn't currently provide good coverage for the smiths which worked after 1930s.\n\nHow to use\n\nSwordsmith Index can be accessed in two ways: Smith List (if you are looking for smith by name, ID, province or Japanese calendar era), Mei Search (if you are looking by signature or parts of signature) and Schools (view by school of sword making).\n\nMei Search in 'contains' mode can search the signature database by any part of the signature, including single characters, both in Kanji and Romaji. It looks for continuous matches, so if you look for 'Musashi Daijo Tadahiro', it will find 'Hizen Kuni ju Musashi Daijo Tadahiro', but not 'Musashi Daijo Fujiwara Tadahiro'. You may use 'Musashi Daijo%Tadahiro' in order to fetch more results. If not found, you may need to reduce the search string further. Search strings are NOT case sensitive.\n\nPlease note that many smiths who used signed with 2 characters will not show up in the mei search due to the lack of information about their work. If you can't find the smith by signature, use the Smith List. If no data was found in the List but you are sure the smith existed, please contact me and I'll do my best to add it into the Index.\n\nPlease take time to get used to the spellings of Japanese names, titles and locations in Nihonto Club. If unsure, make few trial searches to look for examples. E.g. 'daijo', 'mutsu no suke' will fetch results, but 'daijou' and 'mutsu-no-suke' will not. Spelling conventions are intended to be totally uniform across the website, but there may be exceptions. Particle 'no' may sometimes be omitted.\n\nTerms of use\n\nIt is intended to be a non-commercial resource to support Nihonto studies and raise awareness of history and appreciation of genuine Japanese swords.\n\nSwordsmith Index is licensed under Creative Commons License which allows to copy, distribute, transmit and adapt the work freely as long as appropriate attribution is made, the use is non-commercial and any derivative works are licensed under similar terms (for more details see here).

Many of the famous early smiths and school founders were frequently dated in pre-Edo period sword documents to eras like Ei\u00b4en (\u6c38\u5ef6, 987-989). But going back that far is problematic because the transition from the 10th to the 11th century AD marks just the forming of the fully developed nihont\u00f4 as we know it today. And by \u201cfully developed\u201d we speak of a single-edged blade in shinogi-zukuri with a deliberately added sori (i.e. not a sori which is caused by hardening). So late Heian would probably be better to date extant blades of the early smiths concerned. Experts assume that these early datings are mostly simply based on hearsay or on any early neng\u00f4 which sounded appropriate for the author. These early datings would not be such a big deal if not later authors dealt with them in different ways. For example, a Muromachi-period author who was going to compile a meikan record had extant and dated blades and more recent records of sons, grandsons or students of famous smiths which did not comply at all with the early datings of earlier publications. So he had basicall three different options: Correcting the supposed neng\u00f4 arbitrarily to a neng\u00f4 more suitable with extant works and more recent records, keeping the old era and causing a gap of 200 or more years between an ancestor and his sons or students, or filling the gap with invented descendants and students. Well, from a historical point of view, all three approaches are problematic and maybe the best solution would have been the second approach with additional comments like \u201chanded-down date is no longer tenable because \u2026\u201d The worst is of course the third approach and the first approach can cause significant problems too when namely later chroniclers were facing the old and initial records and the already corrected data of some predecessors. This resulted namely often in double-listings.\n\nAnother common practice of chroniclers was to justify very early neng\u00f4 by claiming that the smith in question made swords for a certain high-ranking person or emperor of his time or that a person from then high-society wore a blade by this smith. And this brings us to Kanehira because my aforementioned research was about finding out who owned the \u00d4-Kanehira before the Momoyama-era Ikeda family (\u6c60\u7530). For further details on the Ikeda and their relation to the meibutsu, please see Sat\u00f4, The Japanese Sword p. 94ff. Well, Sat\u00f4 already points out that the previous history of the \u00d4-Kanehira is uncertain and so this article (with reference to Mamiya K\u00f4ji\u00b4s article published in T\u00f4ken-Bijutsu 483, April 1997) should serve mere as demonstration of how difficult and confusing cross-checking historic sword refereces can be. We know today that most pre-Edo period sword publications are more or less transcriptions of earlier documents whereat each copy was usually enlarged with comments. So it takes a chronological approach and we have to start with the earliest extant sword publication which is the Kanchi\u00b4in-bon mei-zukushi (\u89b3\u667a\u9662\u672c\u9298\u5c3d) from \u00d4ei 30 (\u5fdc\u6c38, 1423). Therein we read:\n\nPicture 1: The entry of the Kanchi\u00b4in-bon mei-zukushi.\n\n\u6cf0\u517c\u5e73 \u6cb3\u5185\u570b\u4f4f\u4eba\u3001\u307b\u3046\u3057\u3084\u3046\u306e\u3075\u3068\u3053\u308d\u592a\u5200\u3092\u4f5c\u3001 \u5f8c\u306b\u306f\u5f8c\u9ce5\u7fbd\u9662\u306e\u5fa1\u3064\u308b\u304e\u304b\u307e\u306e\u306f \u304d\u308a\u3068\u304c\u3046\u305b\u3089\u308c\u3001\u53c8\u3046\u305f\u3044\u3057\u3084\u3046\u3051\u306e \u5fa1\u6642\u3064\u306d\u306b\u304b\u308a\u306f\u3091\u5fa1\u51fa\u4e4b\u6642\u3001\u5fa1\u7bb1\u306b \u5165\u308b\u308b\u9593\u3001\u7bb1\u4e38\u3068\u304c\u3046\u3059\u3001\u5176\u5f8c\u3001\u3055\u3044\u307f\u3084\u3046\u3058 \u3069\u306e\u306e\u5fa1\u6642\u3046\u3064\u3057\u304a\u304b\u308c\u3001\u3075\u3068\u3053\u308d\u306e\u3064\u308b\u304e\u3069 \u304c\u3046\u3059\u3001\u3053\u308d\u308c\u306f\u3068\u3046\u3072\u3087\u3046\u3048\u306e\u305c\u3076\u570b\u5409 \u304c\u3055\u304f\u4e5f\u3001\u3075\u3068\u3053\u308d\u592a\u5200\u3001\u3075\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3064\u308b\u304e \u304b\u304f\u3078\u3061\u306a\u308a\u3002\n\nImmediately noticeable is that the Kanchi\u00b4in-bon mei-zukushi quotes Kanehira (\u5305\u5e73) with the characters (\u517c\u5e73) and that it uses the character (\u6cf0) for \u201cHata\u201d (\u79e6) (more on this Hata later). Then it reads that he was a resident of Kawachi province and that he made the futokoro-tachi (\u3075\u3068\u3053\u308d\u592a\u5200) of H\u00f4sh\u00f4 (\u307b\u3046\u3057\u3084\u3046). Futokoro-tachi means in this context \u201cbeloved sword\u201d and must not be confused with the small and hidden futokorogatana (\u61d0\u5200). And \u201cH\u00f4sh\u00f4\u201d is the Sino-Japanese reading of the characters for \u201cYasumasa\u201d (\u4fdd\u660c) and refers to the mid Heian noble and poet Fujiwara no Yasumasa (\u85e4\u539f\u4fdd\u660c, 958-1036). Then we read that this beloved sword of H\u00f4sh\u00f4 or Yasumasa respectively came eventually in the possession of the abdicated emperor Gotoba (\u5f8c\u9ce5\u7fbd\u9662, 1183-1198), although it is possible that actually the abdicated emperor Toba (\u9ce5\u7fbd\u9662, 1103-1156) was meant, who nicknamed it \u201cKama no ha-kiri\u201d (\u91dc\u6b6f\u5207). Kama no ha is a pot with an extra wide rim so it seems that the sword cut through such a thing. Then we learn that the sword was owned by the Udaish\u00f4 family (\u3046\u305f\u3044\u3057\u3084\u3046\u3051). \u201cUdaish\u00f4\u201d or \u201cUdaish\u00f4gun\u201d (\u53f3\u5927\u5c06\u8ecd) was another name of Minamoto no Yoritomo (\u6e90\u983c\u671d, 1147-1199). Each time Yoritomo was spending time on his hunting grounds, he put the sword in a special box (hako, \u7bb1) and stored it away and so it got the nickname \u201cHakomaru\u201d (\u7bb1\u4e38). Later the sword was owned by lord Saimy\u00f4ji (\u3055\u3044\u307f\u3084\u3046\u3058), i.e. H\u00f4j\u00f4 Tokiyori (\u5317\u6761\u6642\u983c, 1227-1263) who ordered the smith T\u00f4hy\u00f4e no J\u00f4 Kuniyoshi (\u3068\u3046\u3072\u3087\u3046\u3048\u306e\u305c\u3076\u570b\u5409) to make copy of the sword. \u201cSaimy\u00f4ji\u201d (\u6700\u660e\u5bfa) is the posthumous Buddhist name of Tokiyori and with the smith, Awataguchi Kuniyoshi is meant. So the original was still called futokoro-tachi and the copy futokoro-tsurugi (\u3075\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3064\u308b\u304e).\n\nNow lets tackle the next reference, the \u00d4seki-sh\u00f4 (\u5f80\u6614\u6284) from Eish\u00f4 16 (\u6c38\u6b63, 1519). The entry therein is insofar precious because it comes with a drawing of a nakago which is signed \u201cBuzen no Kuni Kanehira\u201d (\u5099\u524d\u56fd\u5305\u5e73). Please note that the character for \u201cKuni\u201d is not just abbreviated in this drawing because Kanehira actually signed that way, seen in the picture to the right which is the mei of the \u00d4-Kanehira. So the \u00d4seki-sh\u00f4 writes next to the tang:\n\nPicture 2, left: The entry of the \u00d4seki-sh\u00f4; right: mei of the meibutsu \u00d4-Kanehira\n\n\u5cef\u89d2\u30cb\u5c0f\u8089\u30a2\u30ea\u3001\u9229\u6a2a\u3001\u5e2f\u9762\u5263\u4e8c\u30c4\u9577\u30af\u30e4\u30ea\u3001\u516b\u5e61\u5927\u83e9\u85a9\u30c8\u5263\u30ce\u4e0a\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u68b5\u5b57\u4e8c\u30c4\u6709 \u53f3\u5fa1\u592a\u5200\u4eca\u51fa\u5ddd\u6bbf\u69d8\u5fa1\u4e0a\u6d1b\u4e4b\u6642\u3001\u6301\u662f\u9662\u516c\u6027\u30cb\u4e0b\u30b5\u30ec\u30b7\u5fa1\u5263\u4e5f\u3001\u5305\u5e73\u30cf\u6cb3\u5185\u4f4f\u30cb\u30c6\u5019 \u7136\u30eb\u30cb\u6b64\u592a\u5200\u30cf\u5099\u524d\u3068\u5728\u4e4b\u4e0d\u9650\u5305\u5e73\u30cb\u4ed6\u56fd\u30d8\u884c\u30c6\u6253\u30c4\u4e8b\u985e\u591a\u5728\u4e4b\u7269\u3001\u6839\u5143\u30cf \u5099\u524d\u30ab\u30c1\u4e5f\u3001\u5f8c\u6cb3\u5185\u30cb\u4f4f\u30b9\u30c8\u4e91\u3005\n\nThe blade has a kaku-mune with ko-niku, kiri-yasurime, shows two long (su)ken on the haki-omote and bonji over the characters of Hachiman-Daibosatsu and another (su)ken on the ura side. When lord Jizei\u00b4in (\u6301\u662f\u9662), i.e. Sait\u00f4 My\u00f4jun (\u658e\u85e4\u5999\u7d14, ?-1497), proceeded to Ky\u00f4to, he was presented with this sword by the noble Imadegawa family (\u4eca\u51fa\u5ddd). Then it is stated that Kanehira lived in Kawachi province but that this tachi was made when he was in Bizen and that the smith worked also in other regions. And finally it is written that Kanehira was originally a Bizen smith and that he moved later in his career to Kawachi.\n\nPicture 3: The entry of the Genki-gannen t\u00f4ken-mekiki-sho.\n\nOur next source is the Genki-gannen t\u00f4ken-mekiki-sho (\u5143\u4e80\u5143\u5e74\u5200\u5294\u76ee\u5229\u66f8) from the first year of Genki (\u5143\u4e80, 1570). This source tells us the following:\n\n\u79e6\u5305\u5e73\u3001\u540c\u5fa1\u5b87\u3001\u6c38\u5ef6\u4ee5\u6765 \u6cb3\u5185\u56fd\u4f4f\u4eba\u6216\u5099\u524d\u4f4f\u79e6\u30ce\u5b57\u30f2\u30cf\u4e0d\u6253\u30c8\u4e91\u67c4 \u8eab\u30b5\u30ad\u7d30\u4e5f\u5207\u30e4\u30b9\u30ea\u5cef\u30e2\u30cf\u65b9\u30e2\u30e1\u30f3\u30f2\u30c8\u30eb\u67c4\u8eab\u5148 \u5c11\u4e38\u30b7\u9298\u592a\u5200\u30cf\u76ee\u8cab\u7a74\u30e8\u30ea\u4e0a\u30cb\u6253\u5200\u30cf\u4e0b\u30cb\u6253 \u4fdd\u660c\u61d0\u592a\u5200\u9020\u4e4b\u5f8c\u30cb\u9ce5\u7fbd\u9662\u4e4b\u5fa1\u5263\u91dc\u6b6f \u30c8\u53f7\u3001\u5176\u53f3\u5c06\u76f8\u4f1d\u4e4b\u5e38\u30cb\u72e9\u5834\u30d8\u51fa\u5fa1\u4e4b\u6642 \u88ab\u5165\u5fa1\u7c3e\u4e4b\u9593\u4e4b\u53f7\u30cb\u7c3e\u4e38\u53c8\u6700\u660e\u5bfa\u6bbf\u88ab\u5199 \u7f6e\u4f5c\u8005\u85e4\u5175\u885b\u570b\u5409\u4e5f\u3001\u662f\u592a\u5200\u30f2\u30cf\u61d0\u5263\u30c8\u53f7 \u30bb\u30e9\u30eb\u3001\u5305\u5e73\u4f5c\u61d0\u592a\u5200\u4e5f\u3001\u570b\u5409\u4f5c\u30f2\u30cf\u61d0\u5263\u3068\u53f7\u30b9\n\nHata Kanehira, active during the reign of emperor Ichij\u00f4 (\u4e00\u6761\u5929\u7687, 980-1011, r. 986-1011) and from Ei\u00b4en onwards. Note that the entry states d\u00f4-gyo\u00b4u (\u540c\u5fa1\u5b87), lit. \u201csame reign\u201d, which refers to the previous entry. Then we read that he was a resident of Kawachi and of Bizen but that he did not sign with \u201cHata\u201d when in Bizen province. His tangs taper from both the mune and ha side, show kiri-yasurime, and a somewhat roundish nakago-jiri. Tachi are signed above the mekugi-ana and katana below of the mekugi-ana, whereat katana refers here probably to koshigatana or similar smaller sized blades. One blade was the beloved sword of Fujiwara no Yasumasa with came then in the possession of the abdicated emperor Toba who nicknamed it \u201cKama no ha\u201d. Then the same legend with Minamoto no Yoritomo follows but with the difference that the sword was stored away behind a bamboo screen (misu) and was thus caled \u201cMisu-maru\u201d (\u7c3e\u4e38). And later on, H\u00f4j\u00f4 Tokiyori had Awataguchi Kuniyoshi make a copy of the sword which was called futokoro-ken and the original of Kanehira futokoro-tachi. So without a few exceptions, the Genki-gannen t\u00f4ken-mekiki-sho follows faithfully the Kanchi\u00b4in-bon mei-zukushi.\n\nAnd last I want to introduce the data of the Kokon-mei-zukushi (\u53e4\u4eca\u9298\u5c3d) published in Manji four (\u4e07\u6cbb, 1661). This work first separates Ko-Bizen Kanehira and Kawachi Kanehira strictly in its genealogy section but only to address later on both smiths again in one the the same entry. So in the first volume which deals basically with genealogies we find Kanehira in the Ko-Bizen genealogy in an individual entry next to Nobufusa (\u4fe1\u623f). In this entry he is listed with the neng\u00f4 J\u00f4h\u00f4 (\u627f\u4fdd, 1074-1077), J\u00f4ryaku (\u627f\u66a6, 1077-1081), Eih\u00f4 (\u6c38\u4fdd, 1081-1084), \u00d4toku (\u5fdc\u5fb3, 1084-1087), Kanji (\u5bdb\u6cbb, 1087-1094), and Kah\u00f4 (\u5609\u4fdd, 1094-1096). And the other Kanehira is introduced several pages earlier along the Kawachi section but just with the comment yoko-yasuri (i.e. kiri-yasurime) and his successors being Arikuni (\u6709\u570b), who was originally from Yamato province, Arinari (\u6709\u6210), and Aritsuna (\u6709\u7db1) (see picture 4).\n\nPicture 4: The genealogic entries from the first volume of the Kokon-mei-zukushi. Left the Ko-Bizen entry, right the Kawachi entry.\n\nIn volume 2 both Kanehira appear side by side in the section about smiths of the same name working in different provinces and not being the same persons. Then later in volume 2 we find some details on the Kanehira from Kawachi province. The entry in question reads:\n\n\u79e6\u5305\u5e73 \u4e00\u6761\u9662\u306e\u5fa1\u5b87\u6cb3\u5185\u570b\u5f8c\u306b\u5099\u524d\u306b\u4f4f\u3059\u6c38\u5ef6\u306e\u6bd4\u3088\u308a\u6176\u9577 \u516b\u5e74\u8fc4\u516d\u767e\u5341\u4e94\u5e74\n\nHata Kanehira, active during the reign of emperor Ichij\u00f4, lived in Kawachi province but moved later to Bizen, from around Ei\u00b4en onwards which is about 615 years in Keich\u00f4 eight (\u6176\u9577, 1603) [i.e. when the data for the Kokon-mei-zukushi was copiled before it was pubished about sixty years later.]\n\nSo according to this entry, we are talking about the same smith who started in Kawachi but moved later in his career to Bizen province. An entry in volume 4 deals with the workmanship of Kanehira and in this entry, both smiths are again separated, but read it for yourself:\n\nPicture 5: The entry of the fourth volume of the Kokon-mei-zukushi.\n\n\u4e00\u3001\u5305\u5e73 \u6c38\u5ef6\u6bd4 \u592a\u5200\u306e\u59ff\u307b\u305d\u304f\u5207\u5148\u3064\u309e\u307e\u3084\u304b\u306b\u5eb5\u4e18\u935b \u67fe\u76ee\u3044\u304b\u306b\u3082\u3053\u307e\u304b\u4e5f\u3002\u5730\u8272\u9ed2\u304f\u3002\u7d2b\u8272\u3042\u308a\u3002\u5c0f\u4e71\u5204\u3092\u713c \u3044\u304b\u306b\u307e\u5c0f\u8db3\u306a\u308a\u3002\u5730\u3056\u304b\u3072\u6c88\u3066\u898b\u3086\u308b\u4e5f\u3002\u5204\u3092\u3072\u308d\u304f\u3001\u6cb8 \u3092\u713c\u305f\u308b\u3082\u3042\u308a\u3002\u5099\u524d\u570b\u5305\u5e73\u3068\u6253\u305f\u308b\u3092\u6cb3\u5185\u935b\u51b6\u3068 \u3044\u3075\u4e8b\u5982\u4f55\u3002\u53e4\u5099\u524d\u306a\u308b\u3079\u3057\u3002\u4e8c\u5b57\u9298\u306e\u5305\u5e73\u306f\u6cb3\u5185\u570b \u79e6\u5305\u5e73\u306a\u308b\u3079\u3057\u3002\u51fa\u6765\u3084\u3046\u5ee3\u76f4\u5204\u306b\u6cb8\u591a\u3057\u3002\u8170\u672c\u3092 \u4e71\u5204\u306b\u3046\u3064\u304f\u3057\u304f\u713c\u3066\u5c0b\u5e38\u4e5f\u3002\u6765\u570b\u884c\u306a\u3069\u306b\u4f3c\u305f\u308a\u3002 \u5730\u8272\u3082\u8d64\u304f\u7d2b\u8272\u3042\u308a\u3002\u5204\u8272\u767d\u3057\u3001\u5099\u524d\u5305\u5e73\u306f\u5204\u8272\u3082 \u305d\u3068\u9752\u307f\u6709\u3066\u4e0a\u767d\u3057\u3002\u6cb8\u306e\u5fc3\u3082\u3053\u307e\u304b\u4e5f\u3002\u80fd\u3005\u5fc3\u3092\u4ed8\u3066 \u898b\u3079\u3057\n\n\u201cKanehira: Around Ei\u00b4en. His tachi-sugata is slender, tapers, and shiows an iori-mune. The kitae is a fine masame and the steel is blackish bit also purple. He tempered a ko-midareba with ko-ashi and the nioiguchi is rather subdued. The ha is white and shows nie. He signed with \u201cBizen no Kuni Kanehira\u201d but it is also said that he was a Kawachi smith, but works signed that way are from the Ko-Bizen smith. All niji-mei must be attributed to Hata Kanehira from Kawachi province. He tempered a hiro-suguha with plentiful of nie and usually a midareba at the base. This interpretation is similar to Rai Kuniyuki. The steel is reddish and purple and the ha is white but the ha of Bizen Kanehira is more blueish white. The nie are also finer and he [Bizen Kanehira] has to be regarded as superior.\u201d\n\nWhat is my conclusion? Well, this is a case where not just one odd document forwards a different theory and all others are in unison about the origins of a certain smith. Here we have too many ambiguous entries on the basis of which we just can\u00b4t rule out one approach or the other. That means everything is possible, i.e. that Kanehira moved from Bizen to Hata in Kawachi province, that he originated in Kawachi and moved to Bizen and gave up there signing with \u201cHata,\u201d or that we are facing two completely different smiths. Also I can\u00b4t say for sure of the \u00d4-Kanehira was the futokoro-tachi owned by Fujiwara no Yasumasa as it is suggested by some experts. But the T\u00f4ky\u00f4 National Museum which owns the blade today dates it to the late Heian period and says 12th century. So not middle Heian and close to Yasumasa. I hope though that I was able to illustrate how hard it can be to rely on old references and that sometimes like here you have to stop at a certain point because you can\u00b4t squeeze out more information from them.

There's no real plot, just a couple characters and a journey as Limper flees his old job.

It's peaceful and relaxing to read.\n\n\n\nIt even takes its time with its descriptions of simple things, like the landscape they are walking through or the food they are eating. Normally, this sort of thing would irritate me, but it works in this case.\n\n\n\nThat said, the ending is an abomination. It's not a conclusion like in a regular book, just another incident, but in this last story the main character behaves entirely out of character, particularly with respect to the way he thinks about and treats his friends and strangers. He allows his dragon friend to be treated like an animal by someone he just met and likes only because they are pretty, is completely okay with the fact that this person owns slaves (this is the first time they have appeared in the book), and makes a trite, ugly justification of slavery by saying that poor people have to work and so aren't really free either. It was jarring and maddening, and I honestly wish the author had just cut the book at the end of the previous adventure and left it at that. It felt almost like something that could have been the beginning of a book, with the character starting out shitty and then having a character development arc, but instead the book has you get attached to this character and then goes, surprise! Here's a few ways in which this person is actually terrible! The End."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/24/mark-e-smith-obituary", "page_content": "Of all the fascinating musical offshoots that sprang from mid-70s punk rock, the Fall proved the strangest and most durable. The group was a vehicle for the singer and lyricist Mark E Smith, who has died aged 60 after an extended period of ill health, including respiratory problems.\n\n\n\nHe formed the Fall after seeing the Sex Pistols perform their famous concert at the Lesser Free Trade Hall, Manchester, in June 1976. This became dubbed \u201cthe gig that changed the world\u201d, because, as well as Smith, it was witnessed by future members of Joy Division, the Smiths and Buzzcocks, who all left with a burning urge to create their own band.\n\nSmith assembled the Fall in his home town of Prestwich later that year. Aside from the inspirational spark of the Sex Pistols, the band cited the German group Can and the Velvet Underground as chief influences, both of whom fully exploited the hypnotic power of repetition as a stylistic device. One of the Fall\u2019s early songs was even called Repetition \u2013 \u201cthe three Rs are repetition, repetition, repetition,\u201d lectured Smith. A fondness for rockabilly was also discernible in their early work, earning them the label Country & Northern from fans.\n\nHowever, while Smith would remain the band\u2019s constant central factor for more than 40 years, his musicians fell by the wayside, often not voluntarily. During the group\u2019s career, Smith performed with a total of 66 band members. One of them was Marc Riley, now a DJ on BBC Radio 6, who was sacked by Smith on his wedding day in the early 80s.\n\n\n\nThis video has been removed. This could be because it launched early, our rights have expired, there was a legal issue, or for another reason. \u2018Riot in righteousness\u2019: Mark E Smith dies aged 60 \u2013 video obituary\n\nThough Smith was notoriously difficult to work with, his acidic tone, deadpan black humour and unswervingly confrontational attitude (fuelled by his copious intake of alcohol) lay at the heart of his perverse appeal. In 1998, his violent mood-swings briefly landed him in jail in New York after he was charged with assaulting the keyboard player Julia Nagle. He was sent back to the UK for rehab.\n\nSmith never viewed commercial success as his prime objective, but the Fall\u2019s tally of 31 studio albums and 32 live albums represented a kind of triumph in itself. They topped the UK independent album chart with Grotesque (After the Gramme) in 1980 and again with Perverted By Language (1983), Reformation Post TLC (2007) and Your Future Our Clutter (2010), and occasionally flirted with wider chart success. The Frenz Experiment (1988) reached 19 on the mainstream album chart, Shift-Work (1991) went to 17, and in 1993 The Infotainment Scan climbed to No 9.\n\nThough Smith\u2019s tuneless, declamatory delivery and the group\u2019s clattering, grinding rhythms generally made them the antidote to singles bands, the Fall nonetheless scored high on the indie chart with such singles as Totally Wired, How I Wrote \u201cElastic Man\u201d and Kicker Conspiracy, and even had a genuine Top 30 hit in 1987 with a cover of R Dean Taylor\u2019s 60s classic, There\u2019s a Ghost in My House.\n\nSmith\u2019s work defied categorisation, combining as it did elements of satire, social commentary, grumbling misanthropy and an abiding enthusiasm for cunning wordplay. The range of his references seemed to know no bounds, and took in literature, philosophy, the occult and football. How I Wrote \u201cElastic Man\u201d (1980) put listeners inside the mind of a struggling writer burdened by the albatross of his past success. In It\u2019s a Curse (1993), Smith took an oblique but caustic swipe at music critics. Gross Chapel \u2013 British Grenadiers (1986) was an extraordinarily menacing piece partly constructed from the old British Grenadiers marching song. In Rowche Rumble (1979), he delivered a furious rant about tranquillisers made by the Swiss drug company Roche. Theme From Sparta FC (2003) was a punchy battle hymn for the obscure Greek football team of the title \u2013 Smith\u2019s third wife, Elena Poulou, is Greek \u2013 complete with fake-bouzouki sounds. The slow, bluesy Hip Priest (1982) might have been autobiographical, while also sounding like a parody of Jim Morrison and the Doors.\n\nBorn in Broughton, Salford, to Irene (nee Brownhill) and Jack Smith, Mark moved to Prestwich with his family while he was young. His father was a plumber who had served in the Black Watch infantry regiment at the end of the second world war, and had an ancestor who fought at the battle of Rorke\u2019s Drift during the Anglo-Zulu war.\n\nHe passed his 11-plus and went to Stand grammar school, but quit at 16 and took a job as a shipping clerk on Salford docks. At night, he took an A-level class in literature and numbered Kurt Vonnegut, Aldous Huxley, George Orwell and HP Lovecraft among his favourite authors (the Fall was named after the Albert Camus novel La Chute). He took an interest in politics and, after a spell as a Labour supporter, veered further left and joined the Socialist Workers party. This never stopped him from expressing illiberal or conservative views.\n\nThe Fall\u2019s first live show, with the original fellow band members Una Baines (Smith\u2019s then partner), Tony Friel and Martin Bramah, and Steve Ormrod as the very short-lived first drummer, was in the basement of the North West Arts office on King Street, Manchester, on 23 May 1977, and their first recordings appeared on a Virgin Records compilation called Short Circuit: Live at the Electric Circus. Their first single, It\u2019s the New Thing, was released by Step Forward Records in November 1978, and their debut album Live at the Witch Trials followed in April 1979.\n\nTheir career would be for ever associated with the DJ John Peel, a staunch supporter for whom the Fall recorded 24 radio sessions between 1978 and 2004, though Peel and Smith never became close. \u201cMe and John had an agreement,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe never were friends or anything like that.\u201d\n\nIn 1983, Smith married the American guitarist Brix Smith (born Laura Salenger, now Brix Smith Start), whose tenure with the Fall helped move them in a more polished and commercial direction. Before she left both her husband and the band in 1989, they had enjoyed both critical and commercial success with albums such as The Wonderful and Frightening World of the Fall, This Nation\u2019s Saving Grace, Bend Sinister, and especially, The Frenz Experiment, all on the Beggars Banquet label.\n\nIn 1986 Smith also found the time to write a play, Hey, Luciani, on Pope John Paul I, which ran for two weeks at the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, starring Smith and the performance artist Leigh Bowery. He then went on to write the music for the Michael Clark ballet I Am Curious, Orange, recorded as the Fall album I Am Kurious Oranj (1988).\n\nDuring the 90s, as the Fall enjoyed more success with albums including Shift-Work, Code: Selfish and Middle Class Revolt, Smith undertook a variety of guest roles. He featured on the D.O.S.E. single Plug Myself In (1996) and collaborated on projects with Elastica, the Clint Boon Experience, Edwyn Collins and Long Fin Killie. He made his first appearance on Top of the Pops when he performed with Inspiral Carpets on their 1994 hit I Want You.\n\nHis first solo album, The Post Nearly Man, was released in 1998, and his second, Pander! Panda! Panzer!, in 2002. He formed Von Sudenfed with the electronic duo Mouse on Mars, and they released the album Tromatic Reflexxions (2007). With Mark Blaney, he made the albums Smith and Blaney (2008) and The Train Part Three (2009), and he appeared on Gorillaz\u2019 album Plastic Beach (2010).\n\nIn 2005, BBC4 aired the documentary The Fall: The Wonderful and Frightening World of Mark E Smith. Three years later, Smith published an autobiography, Renegade: The Lives and Tales of Mark E Smith, written in collaboration with Austin Collins.\n\nSmith\u2019s second marriage, to Saffron Prior, ended in 1995. He married Elena in 2001. She became the Fall\u2019s keyboard player the following year, but left in 2016. The Fall had continued to make albums at a remarkable rate, The Unutterable (2000) being the first of 11 over the next 17 years, concluding with New Facts Emerge (2017)."}, {"url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk/Power-Sword-Wilbur-Smith/dp/0330297643", "page_content": "A long read but boy did I savour and cherish every last page. As always Smith has this captivating writing style that resonates his characters thoughts and feelings through you and explains even the most intricate of descriptions simplistically. He is a natural storyteller.\n\n\n\nPower of the Sword takes place around 15 years after the events of the Burning Shore- Centaine's son Sasha is now near a grown man and Manfred, her discredited son, is a year younger. The novel takes you through their journey from adolescence to adulthood both experienced through two very diverse roads and shaped by the political views of their background and the burgeoning second world war. It is a story about endurance through a time of depression.\n\n\n\nHowever what marks this book as being it's own from the others is that we now see the Courtney family from a new perspective. Whilst we have always been made to side with this family of wealth and power we can now make our own judgments upon them. Centaine, for instance, was a heroine in the last book, and whilst she still may be, she makes decisions in this book which are remorseless to ensure her and Sasha's survival and prestige. As a result we find ourselves sympathising with Lothar and Manfred De La Rey whose struggles are hot. These latter characters become respected through their humble endeavours. Then, through twists of fate and intricate character development, we observe the reverse. Manfred, although being justified in doing so, is beguiled by the Nazis as Sasha wizens and earns his respect as a British hero championing their cause in South Africa. Nonetheless, it goes without saying that Centaine reaps what she sown from her previous passion as she experiences a new flame.\n\n\n\nI couldn't put the book down and the ending was a real page turner. It almost becomes a thriller! In conclusion, credit to Mr Smith for creating these complex and believable characters that will stay with me forever."}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10583-022-09509-5", "page_content": "The Serrailliers, in their work at New Windmill, revealed their understanding of the liminality of the territory between adult and child. Indeed, a central theme within The Silver Sword is the shifting boundaries between adult and childhood-states: at some points in the narrative, Ruth\u2019s maturity and resilience makes her appear as essentially the adult of the party, yet, when we view her through the eyes of others, she reverts to being a child. Another example of these blurred boundaries is in the relationship between the children and the adults they encounter, as the chaos of war subverts received notions and constructions of childhood in the hierarchy of age. Although the wartime setting of The Silver Sword certainly magnifies these confusions, the Serrailliers believed more generally that children on the cusp of adulthood required a particular sort of book. As Karen Sands-O\u2019Connor observes, the New Windmill Series was \u201cone of the earliest imprints to publish and promote books specifically for the teen audience\u201d (2017, p.20). The trajectory of the list was such that, having started by predominantly publishing books written for children, albeit at the older end of the spectrum, by the middle of the 1960s, a significant proportion of the list was made up of books originally published as adult novels.\n\nIn a file within the New Windmill Archive, dated between 1949 and 1955, is a cutting from The School Librarian journal. Entitled \u201cThe Future of School Libraries\u201d, it highlights the fact that there were now some 3000 Secondary Modern schools in the UK. The Education Act of 1944 stipulated the need to equip these schools with school libraries, which meant the largest ever provision of its kind. This obviously provided huge scope for publishing companies such as Heinemann to meet the demand for titles that would, alongside educating pupils, support children\u2019s hobbies and interests. As a handwritten report from Ian Serraillier (written in 1949) reveals, the provision of reading material for schools was less than inspiring. A number of publishers, including Ginn, Methuen, John Murray, Harraps, Longman, and Blackwell, sold educational series but the quality of production was poor and the selection of titles unimaginative. Serraillier\u2019s assessment of this material included damning comments such as \u201cabout the level of the \u201ctwopenny blood\u201d, \u201ccrudely drawn and reproduced\u201d, \u201cpoor binding and abominable blocking\u201d, \u201cGod knows what intelligent questions one could set on such texts!\u201d, \u201cClassic juvenile novels, collections of fables, etc. Poorly printed, ordinary binding\u201d.\n\nThe idea behind New Windmill was to provide fresh and engaging literature for secondary school age children (11\u201316 age range). These editions were, importantly, designed to look like novels, rather than school reading books \u2013 there were no notes or comprehension questions at the end. Alan Hill and Tony Beal, directors of Heinemann, worked with the Serrailliers to establish New Windmill as one of the key players in educational publishing. Hill recalled Serraillier\u2019s approach: \u201cFrom the start, in fact, Ian deliberately extended the series beyond the middle class world of Arthur Ransome, whose Swallows and Amazons was outsold five times over by Sylvia Sherry\u2019s A Pair of Jesus Boots - a story of the back streets of Liverpool today\u201d(1988, p.84). This impetus reflects the Serrailliers\u2019 recognition of the need to provide teenage audiences with books with timely, contemporary themes which would be of immediate appeal. The fact that, for example, A Pair of Jesus Boots was so successful at the time of its publication but is now out of print does not undermine its significance but rather speaks to the way in which many of these titles tapped into the contemporary concerns and interests of readers within a specific period. As Lucy Pearson observes, in her study of Aidan Chambers\u2019 Topliner imprint for adolescent readers, \u201cbooks which dealt directly with the experience of being a teenager in the 1970s were quick to date\u201d (2013, p.165).\n\nBoth Ian and Anne read extensively, and were continually on the lookout for potential New Windmill titles. There was a two-way stream of books which travelled between the Serrailliers\u2019 cottage in Singleton, West Sussex, and the Heinemann offices in London. The Serrailliers would often write to request copies of books they had heard good things about; Beal and Hill would, similarly, send books to them for their opinion. It was a time-consuming process, particularly when one recalls that Ian was still teaching, and Anne had four children to look after. Blurbs were written, and other opinions sought from colleagues and pupils \u2013 the Serrailliers capitalising on their position as teachers and parents to secure reviews from young readers. In some cases, correspondence with authors was required, as well as negotiations over royalties, illustrations and cover design. The Serrailliers were involved in all aspects of the publication process and were keenly aware of the financial pressures that needed to be met in order to make the list profitable.\n\nTo add to the workload, there was, in many cases, considerable labour involved in editing manuscripts to make them suitable for the series. Editorial files for each title contain lists of proposed cuts and changes that were required, for reasons of length and/or content. Some of these adjustments were relatively clear cut, and combined the need to reduce the length of books as well as ensuring their contents would be suitable for the intended audience. For example, Serraillier wrote of Tschiffely\u2019s Ride (A. F. Tschiffely): \u201cI propose to omit whole chunks which would not be of interest to children, reducing the book to about half its present length.[\u2026] Schoolchildren will not be interested in the lengthier descriptions and much of the lore, and the references to prostitution and suchlike would have to go\u201d (1949).\n\nWith so many facets to the role, it would have been understandable had the Serrailliers bowed to pressure and been less exacting about some of their choices for the list. However, their crystal-clear vision of what was and wasn\u2019t a New Windmill book was matched only by their absolute focus on the audience for whom they were catering. It was not straightforward. Not only did the Serrailliers have to keep in mind the differences between a reader at the bottom end of their age range (11 years old) and at the top (16 years old) and the progress between the two, but also the adult gatekeepers of this material: the teachers. With school budgets tight (it was ever thus), teachers had to be sure that the books they chose were right for their students. The element of trust was vital to the success of an educational list: one wrong choice would potentially dissuade teachers from putting their faith \u2013 and their precious funds \u2013 in a list, no matter how appealing their catalogue might be.\n\nThe Serrailliers had not only to consider whether their young readers would enjoy a book, but also whether their teachers would be happy to have it in their class libraries. This assessment of a book under consideration in 1972 \u2013 The Thundering Good Today (J.M. Cooper) - encapsulates much of what Ian Serraillier believed in terms of the audience New Windmill was aiming for:\n\nThe appeal of this salty and lively novel is to \u201cyoung adults\u201d, thoughtful, questioning, intelligent, of the calibre to study for \u201cA\u201d levels [\u2026] 15+, with some political awareness, disillusioned with society as at present organised and anxious to explore new ways of doing things, and new solutions, conscious too of the gap that yawns between themselves and the older generation, having to follow along the accepted grooves of examination-passing, and wanting to make a hit with their girl-friends when they feel they ought perhaps to be at their books, studying.\u201d (1972)\n\nDespite his appreciation of the book\u2019s qualities, however, Serraillier expressed doubts that the all-important second audience \u2013 the teachers \u2013 would react in a similarly positive way to the book. He asked, \u201cHow many teachers are going to write in objecting to the number of times the word \u201ccrap\u201d is used (v.frequent) or \u201cbugger\u201d, (less frequent), quite unimpressed by the fact that is the way that many 15 plus-ers speak\u2026\u201d The title was, with regret, rejected. On other occasions, however, the Serrailliers judged that the benefits of publishing a more challenging, \u201csalty\u201d book outweighed the risks of alienating teachers, and their instincts were generally strong. There were, inevitably, occasional complaints. Despite being aware of the need to reassure teachers whilst engaging teenage readers, sometimes they had to defend their choices. In 1969, Ian Serraillier responded to a letter of complaint received from a Scottish teacher regarding a book called A River Ran out of Eden, and its appropriateness for her pupils. He acknowledged that: \u201cThere is a wide range of views among teachers as to where the line should be drawn between \u201csuitable and unsuitable\u201d books for these near-adult readers.\u201d It is interesting to note here the use of \u201cnear-adult\u201d as another definition of this age group: it is adjacent to the now well-defined Young Adult market. Serraillier goes on to defend the selection of this book: \u201c\u2026we feel that it is a highly moral tale, emphasising as it does the author\u2019s reverence for life in general, and for family life in particular. It also places a high value on truth and integrity in personal relationships. It does, certainly, treat the reader as a mature person\u2026\u201d(1969). Serraillier\u2019s concern that The Silver Sword was not to be seen as glorifying violence is echoed here: adult themes are present for a reason, rather than simply providing cheap thrills.\n\nAlthough, as this letter demonstrates, the Serrailliers did make decisions with adults in mind, they also took pains to ensure that the books they chose would appeal to contemporary child readers, rather than relying on their own memories of what they enjoyed as children. For example, Anne Serraillier gave her assessment of Anne of Green Gables to Tony Beal, having consulted with her own young daughters: \u201cI am convinced that it is too cosy and corny by half for modern readers, and Helen and Jane confirm that it is \u201csoppy\u201d. Anne is too often \u201cdeliciously athrill with excitement\u201d. I fear I must have been a soppy child to have lapped this up so uncritically\u201d (1961). When selecting titles, the Serrailliers applied judgements about the age, gender, and interests of their potential readers. For example, recommending My Mother\u2019s House by Colette in 1967, Ian Serraillier comments: \u201cThis is real literature, marvellous stuff, and can be recommended for mature readers of both sexes, but especially girls of a literary bent who enjoy true stories of happy family life\u201d (1967).\n\nOf course, the New Windmill series was not unique in having to split its allegiance between two audiences. Any publisher producing children\u2019s books needs to acknowledge this duality: adults as well as children are their customers, regardless of who ultimately reads the book. For school lists such as New Windmill, it is even more complex, however. Particularly in the earlier years of the list\u2019s existence, books that were deemed acceptable for private reading were more questionable when considered for use in the classroom. The editorial file for Enid Bagnold\u2019s National Velvet is a clear example of this process. When the title was proposed for inclusion in New Windmill, Ian Serraillier suggested that various cuts would be needed, and approval was sought from the author. Bagnold reacted vociferously to this, however, refusing to alter any aspect of the text. She objected to the suggestion that words such as \u201cdamn\u201d and \u201cblast\u201d should be removed, as well as references to characters being naked to the waist. Her argument was that as parents professed to love the book, there was no reason that teachers should be allowed to censor it.\n\nIan Serraillier\u2019s response was philosophical and acknowledged the issue from a teacher\u2019s perspective:\n\nOf course, boys and girls read the Penguin of this book and take it in their stride. I should have no hesitation in giving it to any boy or girl to read as it stands. But to a teacher reading it aloud in a mixed class or using it as a reader, these are obvious objections. What is the standard which you, as publisher, wish to adopt? Teachers\u2019 opinions will differ. Are you prepared to take the risk of letters objecting to damn\u2019s, blast\u2019s, hells and so on? or does it get a bad name for the series and put teachers off and affect sales? (1953)\n\nNational Velvet was published as a New Windmill, but this assessment reflects the continuous balancing act that the list needed to achieve: it had to compete for young readers\u2019 attention with popular paperbacks, but its titles also had to earn their place on a class library shelf \u2013 and they had to sell in sufficient numbers to cover the costs of production, and make a profit. Fortunately, although the scope of the list did not change over the years \u2013 if anything, its ambitions grew - the parameters of what was deemed acceptable did. Evidence from correspondence shows that attitudes to censorship were subject to change, according to mores of the day. By 1964, Ian Serraillier, giving his approval to To Kill A Mockingbird, commented: \u201cAt the upper end of our age group we think Windmills should reflect the earlier maturity of their readers today, and while keeping a sense of responsibility we should not be too quick on the draw with the blue pencil.\u201d The book\u2019s \u201chumanitarian attitude and very sound values throughout can have only a beneficial effect upon young readers, and it would be a great pity to reject the book for fear the fifteen references to rape might offend the prudish\u201d (1964). Four years later, Tony Beal reinforced this view: \u201cas the years go by the amount of expurgation necessary becomes less and less \u2013 until now we are astonished at some of the things we thought we had to cut out a few years ago\u201d (1968).\n\nIn the same letter, Beal sets out the broad aims of the New Windmill series: \u201cto provide good contemporary reading for the 11\u201316 age group\u201d. He discusses the challenges they faced in sourcing appropriate titles written particularly for children, although he adds that another difficulty is that \u201cchildren stop being children at about 11 and expect to read adult books.\u201d This contention raises interesting questions about the potential disconnect between how children view their passage to adulthood and how this transition is perceived by adults. The audience for the New Windmill Series becomes more complicated when considered through this dual lens, and it echoes Serraillier\u2019s portrayal of his young protagonists in The Silver Sword: \u201cThey were to endure hardships and conditions which made them think and plan and act more like adults than children.\u201d (1956 p.1). As Serraillier portrays in The Silver Sword, children, particularly in wartime (although not exclusively), were forced into situations where they had to confront danger and uncomfortable realities that might otherwise be associated with adulthood: hunger, the need to physically defend oneself, to make difficult decisions and to decide who to trust and who to fear. Here the lines between child and adult are certainly not clear cut."}, {"url": "https://tresanimo.com/2023/03/01/demon-slayer-to-the-swordsmith-village-english-dub-has-been-released/", "page_content": "With the release of the English dub trailer for Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba -To the Swordsmith Village-, fans have been given a fresh preview of what to anticipate as Demon Slayer:\n\nKimetsu no Yaiba makes its way to theatres in the United States as part of a special worldwide tour for the Swordsmith Village Arc premiere.

The characters involved in the retelling have varied, but one figure that\u2019s a constant fixture is his trusted advisor: the wizard Merlin. But as historians speculate about the accomplishments of King Arthur\u2014or whether he even existed at all\u2014they have also debated the identity of the mystic in his court. Is the legend of Merlin based on a real person, and if so, who? As it turns out, Merlin, who has also been called Myrddin Wyllt, Merlinus, and Merlin Caledonis, was not always connected to Arthurian legend. He first appears in various sixth-century Welsh poems as a \"wild man\" and prophet who lives in the forest. Alternatively, he was also said to have originated from the Lowlands of Scotland, although his exact place of origin in Scotland is contested; some stories depict him living in the Caledonian Forest; others, in the forests of Tweeddale. It\u2019s also believed that Merlin was partially based on Ambrosius or Emrys, two prophetic figures that appear in historical texts from the ninth century.

Sir Thomas Mallory would be the first to place Merlin in proximity to King Arthur and his court with his work Le Morte d\u2019Arthur, which was completed around 1470. It seems that the Merlin we're familiar with today is an amalgamation of several different stories.

These blended real history with myth to present an imaginative version of the story of Scotland. They usually depicted Arthur in his familiar guise as a mighty king, with Merlin cast as a prophet and sorcerer at the royal court. Both characters were often treated unfavourably, chiefly because of the political implications of Merlin\u2019s prophecies. In Geoffrey of Monmouth\u2019s Historia Regum Britanniae, Merlin prophesied that Arthur would one day return to regain his authority over the whole of Britain. To many Scots in the Middle Ages, this was a profoundly unsettling prospect. They did not welcome the idea of being conquered \u2013 or reconquered \u2013 by an ambitious southern king, whether legendary or otherwise. Moreover, HRB had not only shown Arthur as conquering Scotland but had also depicted his treacherous nephew Modred as a Scottish king. This, too, made Arthur seem like an enemy of the Scots. His negative image north of the Border was strengthened by the attitudes of contemporary English writers, many of whom saw Arthur as a model for their own kings. Arthur\u2019s supposed domination of Britain provided a template for English territorial ambitions in the 1300s and 1400s, with Merlin duly portrayed as the prophet of England\u2019s future greatness. Moreover, Merlin\u2019s prophecy about Arthur\u2019s triumphal return to resume the overkingship of Britain appeared to legitimise English claims of sovereignty over the Scots. Scottish writers responded by promoting Modred, not Arthur, as the legitimate overlord of ancient Britain. Modred\u2019s Scottishness was well established in HRB so he was an obvious choice. Merlin could then be dismissed as a charlatan, a false prophet, or used as a mouthpiece for Scottish political prophecy. In the fourteenth century, John of Fordun\u2019s Chronicles of the Scottish People included the following lines of verse, which had supposedly been uttered by the British cleric Gildas in the sixth century: Scotia shall mourn her famous kings of old \u2013 Her kings so just, rich, bountiful, and bold. For an unkingly king \u2013 so Merlin sings \u2013 Shall wield the sceptre of victorious kings. Fordun does not say who this \u2018unkingly\u2019 monarch is but presumably had a candidate in mind. It hardly needs stating that the prophecy has no real connection with Gildas and is nothing more than medieval invention. It is nevertheless interesting for its reference to Merlin\u2019s prophetic \u2018song\u2019 about Scottish kings. Another curious item comes from the fifteenth century when Walter Bower reported a tradition that the eagles of Loch Lomond were able to foresee the future. The tradition itself is obscure and otherwise unknown but Bower credited Merlin as the source. Other Scottish writers were reluctant to say anything positive about Merlin, regarding him as tainted by association with Arthur whose legendary subjugation of Scotland was strongly resented. Hector Boece, writing in the sixteenth century, rejected the romanticised account of Arthur\u2019s conception in HRB, seeing Uther\u2019s trickery of Igerna as an evil deed facilitated by the \u2018necromancy of Merlyne\u2019. Boece asserted that Arthur (\u2018gottin in adultery\u2019) had not conquered Scotland \u2013 as the English claimed \u2013 but had been slain by the Scottish king Lothus. This type of ill-feeling towards Arthur and Merlin was a characteristic of Scottish historical writing in the late medieval period and continued through the arguments over political union during the sixteenth century. At its heart was a broader opposition to the perceived \u2018Englishness\u2019 of Arthur and to the idea of a single, pan-British kingdom ruled by a southern monarch. Its clearest expression came as the medieval era was drawing to a close, in The Complaynt of Scotland, a document examined below.\n\nDust off exclusive book deals and tales from the past when you join The Archive's newsletter. Subscribe\n\nMerlin and the Union of the Crowns In the sixteenth century, the English king Henry VIII sought a dynastic marriage between his son Edward and Mary, Queen of Scots. Mary was only a baby at the time, having succeeded to the Scottish throne on the death of her father James V in December 1542. The effective ruler of Scotland during her infancy was the Earl of Arran who held the role of regent. Scottish resentment at the prospect of this marriage led to the plan being rejected by the country\u2019s parliament, whose members saw it as another lever for English political ambitions. Henry responded by declaring war on the Scots. Known in later times as \u2018The Rough Wooing\u2019, the conflict lasted from 1543 to 1551. Hostilities on the battlefield were accompanied by propaganda campaigns, with both sides producing printed works for mass distribution. One pamphlet vigorously opposed the view that the two countries should be united under a single monarch. Written anonymously, but perhaps by the Dundee minister Robert Wedderburn, it appeared in 1549 under the title The Complaynt of Scotland. It denounced a number of English propagandist texts and saw Merlin\u2019s prophecies as giving the English an excuse for making war: the prophesies of Merlyne, to the quhilk the Inglishmen giffs more confidens nor thai gif to the evangel, by cause that there ald prophane prophesis sais, that Ingland and Scotland sal be baitht undir ane prince, on this misteous prophesis, thai have intendit weyris contrar Scotland. (\u2018The prophecies of Merlin, to which the Englishmen give more confidence than they give to the Gospel, because an old profane prophecy says that England and Scotland shall be both under one prince. On this obscure prophecy, they have intended wars against Scotland.\u2019) Related: 10 Illuminating Medieval History Books This was a response to the way in which contemporary English writers \u2013 and some Scottish ones \u2013 employed Merlin as an advocate for the union of the crowns. It illustrates the extent to which attitudes towards Merlin had hardened among those Scots who strongly opposed the union. The Complaynt was specifically aimed at those Scottish writers who had used Merlin as a conduit for prounionist prophecies. It not only dismissed these prophecies as nonsense but countered them with a bold prediction that England would one day be conquered by the Scots. An even more disparaging assessement of Merlin appeared in George Buchanan\u2019s Rerum Scoticarum Historia, published in 1582. Buchanan pulled no punches, describing Merlin as \u2018audacious and wicked\u2019 and as \u2018an egregious imposter, and cunning pretender, rather than a prophet\u2019. The pro-unionist side were eventually able to claim victory when, in 1603, James VI of Scotland succeeded the childless Elizabeth I on the English throne. Merlin, whose prophecies had supposedly foretold the event, could thus be seen as vindicated. The path was now clear for his rehabilitation north of the Border. He was even promoted by Scottish writers such as Thomas Craig and Thomas Dempster as a true native of Scotland. It is a strange irony that the wheel had thus come full circle, bringing the wizard of Arthurian romance back to the land where his legend had started a thousand years earlier.\n\n\n\nMerlin and King Arthur retrieving the sword Excalibur. Photo Credit: Wikipedia\n\nModern Scottish Merlins In the post-medieval era, Scottish writers continued to highlight Merlin\u2019s connection with their country. Antiquarians of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, with a keen interest in relics of the ancient past, reported snippets of folklore from places associated with Merlin. George Chalmers, in the first volume of his Caledonia (1807), was familiar with the Welsh poems attributed to Myrddin Wyllt, deducing from these that Merlin\u2019s homeland was \u2018Caledonia, the land of the Picts\u2019. Later in the same volume he followed a description of prehistoric burial mounds in Peeblesshire with the words \u2018But, what are the barrows of the warriors to the grave of Merlin!\u2019 For, although he believed that a historical figure of the sixth century lay behind the Merlin legend, he seems to have been less trusting of the folklore surrounding the alleged grave-site at Drumelzier. He dismissed any notion that the prophecy attributed to Thomas the Rhymer was genuine, still less that it had been fulfilled by the union of the crowns in 1603. He observed that Drumelzier did not lie close to the heartland of the kingdom of Strathclyde, which is where he placed the Merlin legend\u2019s origins: It is, indeed, curious to remark, that the Merddin of the Cambro-British, the Merlin of the Scoto-Saxons, who was undoubtedly a Strathclyde Briton of the sixth century, should have been buried, according to the popular tradition, in the remotest part of the Strathclyde kingdom, at the junction of the Tweed and Powsail. Related: 11 Beautiful Medieval Castles History Lovers Can Visit Today\n\nChalmers was not only sceptical of the Drumelzier tradition but also of the notion that the battle of Arfderydd had been fought near the Solway Firth. As we noted in Chapter 4, he suggested Airdrie in Clydesdale as a better location. The matter was eventually settled later in the nineteenth century, in Skene\u2019s perceptive exploration of the history behind the Merlin legend. His famous paper on Arfderydd finally pinpointed the place where both Lailoken and Myrddin were said to have gone mad. In the same paper, Skene suggested that the battle was a contest between pagan and Christian forces, the former being led by Merlin and his patron Gwenddolau. To support this idea, Skene drew on his extensive knowledge of ancient Welsh literature, in particular the poems, genealogies and triads relating to the Old North. Crucially, in reference to a triad relating to Arfderydd, his translation of the term mygedorth as \u2018sacred fire\u2019 rather than as \u2018battle fog\u2019 formed a key plank of his belief that the real Merlin was a pagan sorcerer or druid. In Chapter 5 we saw how this became an influential theory that has coloured subsequent discussion of Merlin\u2019s origins. Skene was familiar with the Myrddin poetry but apparently saw its Christian allusions as forming no great obstacle to his theory. He seems to have regarded the poems as originally having a pagan aspect that was hidden beneath a later Christian overlay during a long process of composition and transmission in Wales. Skene\u2019s reputation as a major scholar of ancient Celtic literature undoubtedly helped his theory to become widely known and accepted. Its repetition by later writers kept it alive into the twentieth century, ensuring that its popularity remained undimmed long after he himself had passed away. Today, at the beginning of the third millennium, the idea that the Merlin legend originated among sixth-century North British paganism continues to hold a special allure. However, as we have already seen, it relies on little more than a single inference deduced from an erroneous translation of one line of Welsh poetry."}, {"url": "https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/w-s-merwin", "page_content": "William Stanley (W.S.) Merwin was born in New York City in 1927 and raised in New Jersey and Scranton, Pennsylvania, the son of a Presbyterian minister. His numerous collections of poetry, his translations, and his books of prose have won praise over seven decades. Though his early poetry received great attention and admiration, Merwin would continue to alter and innovate his craft with each new book, and at each stage he served as a powerful influence for poets of his generation and younger poets. For the entirety of his writing career, he explored a sense of wonder and celebrated the power of language, while serving as a staunch anti-war activist and advocate for the environment. He won nearly every award available to an American poet, and he was named U.S. poet laureate twice. A practicing Buddhist as well as a proponent of deep ecology, Merwin lived since the late 1970s on an old pineapple plantation in Hawaii which he has painstakingly restored to its original rainforest state. Poet Edward Hirsch wrote that Merwin \u201cis one of the greatest poets of our age. He is a rare spiritual presence in American life and letters (the Thoreau of our era).\u201d\n\n\n\nHis first collection of poetry, A Mask for Janus (1952), was chosen by W.H. Auden for the Yale Younger Poets Prize. While that first book reflected the formalism of the period, Merwin eventually became known for an impersonal, indirect, and open style that eschewed punctuation. Writing in the Guardian, Jay Parini described Merwin\u2019s mature style as \u201chis own kind of free verse, [where] he layered image upon bright image, allowing the lines to hang in space, largely without punctuation, without rhymes ... with a kind of graceful urgency.\u201d Although Merwin\u2019s writing has undergone stylistic changes through the course of his career, a recurring theme is man\u2019s separation from nature. The poet saw the consequences of that alienation as disastrous, both for the human race and for the rest of the world.\n\nRegarding his own development as a writer, Merwin once said, \u201cI started writing hymns for my father almost as soon as I could write at all, illustrating them... But the first real writers that held me were not poets: Conrad first, and then Tolstoy, and it was not until I had received a scholarship and gone away to the university that I began to read poetry steadily and try incessantly, and with abiding desperation, to write it.\u201d Merwin attended Princeton University and studied with R.P. Blackmur and John Berryman. After graduating in 1948, he continued as a post-graduate student of Romance languages and eventually traveled through much of Europe, translating poetry and working as a tutor, including for the son of poet Robert Graves. Merwin\u2019s early collections\u2014especially A Mask for Janus\u2014reflect the influence of Graves and the medieval poetry Merwin was translating at the time.\n\nIndeed, the poetic forms of many eras and societies are the foundation for a great deal of Merwin\u2019s poetry. His first books contain many pieces inspired by diverse, classical models. According to Vernon Young in the American Poetry Review, the poems are traceable to \u201cBiblical tales, Classical myth, love songs from the Age of Chivalry, Renaissance retellings; they comprise carols, roundels, odes, ballads, sestinas, and they contrive golden equivalents of emblematic models: the masque, the Zodiac, the Dance of Death.\u201d In 1956, Merwin was offered a fellowship from the Poets\u2019 Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts and returned to the U.S. His books from this period, Green with Beasts (1956) and The Drunk in the Furnace (1960), show the beginning of a shift in style and tone as Merwin began to experiment with irregular forms. The Drunk in the Furnace, which was written during Merwin\u2019s tenure in Boston when he was meeting poets such as Robert Lowell, particularly shows his new engagement with American themes. His obsession with the meaning of America and its values can make Merwin sometimes seem like the great nineteenth-century poet Walt Whitman, critic Ed Folsom noted in Shenandoah: \u201cHis poetry ... often implicitly and sometimes explicitly responds to Whitman; his twentieth-century sparsity and soberness\u2014his doubts about the value of America\u2014answer, temper, Whitman\u2019s nineteenth-century expansiveness and exuberance\u2014his enthusiasm over the American creation.\u201d\n\nMerwin\u2019s next books were some of his most critically acclaimed and continue to be influential volumes. The Lice (1967), often read as a response to the Vietnam War, also condemns modern man in apocalyptic and visionary terms. \u201cThese are poems not written to an agenda but that create an agenda,\u201d wrote poet and critic Reginald Shepherd, \u201cpreserving and recreating the world in passionate words. Merwin has always been concerned with the relationship between morality and aesthetics, weighing both terms equally. His poems speak back to the fallen world not as tracts but as artistic events.\u201d Dozens of poets pointed to The Lice as a major influence on their own writing, and the book remains one of Merwin\u2019s most-read volumes of poetry. His next book, The Carrier of Ladders (1970) won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1971. He famously donated the prize money to the draft resistance movement, writing an essay for the New York Review of Books that outlined his objections to the Vietnam War. His article spiked the ire of W.H. Auden, who wrote a response arguing that the award was apolitical. The Carrier of Ladders shows Merwin continuing to engage with American themes and nature, and includes a long sequence on American westward expansion. That same year, Merwin published The Miner\u2019s Pale Children: A Book of Prose. Reviewing both volumes for the New York Times, Helen Vendler noted that \u201cthese books invoke by their subtitles the false distinction between prose and poetry: the real distinction is between prose and verse, since both are books of poems, with distinct resemblances and a few differences.\u201d\n\nMerwin moved to Hawaii to study Zen Buddhism in 1976. He eventually settled in Maui and began to restore the forest surrounding his former plantation. Both the rigor of practicing Buddhism and the tropical landscape greatly influenced Merwin\u2019s later style. His next books increasingly show his preoccupation with the natural world. The Compass Flower (1977), Opening the Hand (1983), and The Rain in the Trees (1988) \u201care concerned not only with what to renounce in the metropolis but also what to preserve in the country,\u201d noted Ed Hirsch in the New York Times. Many of the poems in the last volume \u201cimmerse themselves in nature with a fresh sense of numinousness,\u201d said Hirsch, while also mourning the loss of that nature to human greed and destruction. Merwin has continued to produce striking poems using nature as a backdrop. The Vixen (1996), for instance, is an exploration of the rural forest in southwestern France that Merwin called home for many years. Poet-critic J. D. McClatchy remarked in the New Yorker that \u201cthe book is suffused with details of country life\u2014solitary walks and garden work, woodsmoke, birdsong, lightfall.\u201d But Merwin\u2019s later poetry doesn\u2019t merely describe the natural world; it also records and condemns the destruction of nature, from the felling of sacred forests to the extinction of whole species. Migration: New and Selected Poems (2005) exposes Merwin\u2019s evolution as a stylist over half a century but also shows, as Ben Lerner noted in his review of the volume for Jacket, that \u201cMerwin ... is an unwaveringly political poet ... [he] not only tracks the literal impoverishment of our planet, but he makes it symbolize the impoverishment of our culture\u2019s capacity for symbolization.\u201d Migration was awarded the National Book Award for poetry.\n\nSome literary critics have identified Merwin with the group known as the oracular poets, but Merwin himself once commented: \u201cI have not evolved an abstract aesthetic theory and am not aware of belonging to any particular group of writers.\u201d Reviewing Migration for the New York Times, Dan Chiasson described Merwin poems as \u201csecular prophecy grounded on perceptual fineness.\u201d But while Merwin\u2019s work from the 1960s and early \u201870s perhaps best embody this mode, Chiasson believed that \u201cits signature open form has been preserved whatever the occasion. What began as stylistic necessity has become a mannerism.\u201d Merwin has continued to win high praise for his poetry, however, including the 2009 Pulitzer Prize for his collection The Shadow of Sirius (2008). The book\u2019s three sections deal with childhood and memory, death and wisdom, and are some of the most autobiographical of his career. The Pulitzer Prize committee cited the book for its \u201cluminous, often-tender poems that focus on the profound power of memory.\u201d Merwin continues to add to his impressive body of work with recent collections such as Garden Time (2016) and The Moon Before Morning (2014). Reviewing The Essential W.S. Merwin (2017) in the New Yorker, Dan Chiasson remarked, \u201cMerwin\u2019s insistence on a poetry of imaginative utility, against the encroachments of decades of literary fads, has succeeded in giving his imagined worlds some of the tangible pleasures and horrors we associate with real ones. Like Stevens, whose old-age poems are perhaps the greatest ever written, Merwin can say he \u2018recomposed\u2019 the constituents of his vision. But he also planted and tended a palm forest that is now permanently protected and open to the public. His poems, like that forest, are a kind of time preserve.\u201d\n\nIn addition to writing poetry, prose and drama, Merwin is an accomplished and prolific translator of poetry. Merwin has also translated poets as diverse as Osip Mandelstam and Pablo Neruda. His translation of Dante\u2019s Purgatorio (2000) and the Middle English epic Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (2004) both won high praise for their graceful, accessible language, and his Selected Translations (2013) won the Harold Morton Landon Translation Award. With Takako Lento he translated the Collected Haiku of Yosa Buson (2013).\n\nMerwin won most awards available to American poets, including the Bollingen Prize, two Pulitzer Prizes, the Aiken Taylor Award for Modern American Poetry, a Ford Foundation grant, the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize, the PEN Translation Prize, the Shelley Memorial Award, the Wallace Stevens Award, the Zbigniew Herbert International Literary Award, a Lila Wallace-Reader\u2019s Digest Writers\u2019 Award, and the Harold Morton Landon Translation Award. He has also been awarded fellowships from The Academy of American Poets, the Guggenheim Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Rockefeller Foundation. Merwin is a former chancellor of the Academy of American Poets and two-time U.S. poet laureate (1999-2000, 2010-2011).\n\nMerwin was once asked what social role a poet plays\u2014if any\u2014in America. He commented: \u201cI think there\u2019s a kind of desperate hope built into poetry now that one really wants, hopelessly, to save the world. One is trying to say everything that can be said for the things that one loves while there\u2019s still time. I think that\u2019s a social role, don\u2019t you? ... We keep expressing our anger and our love, and we hope, hopelessly perhaps, that it will have some effect. But I certainly have moved beyond the despair, or the searing, dumb vision that I felt after writing The Lice; one can\u2019t live only in despair and anger without eventually destroying the thing one is angry in defense of. The world is still here, and there are aspects of human life that are not purely destructive, and there is a need to pay attention to the things around us while they are still around us. And you know, in a way, if you don\u2019t pay that attention, the anger is just bitterness.\u201d\n\n\n\nMerwin died in March 2019 at the age of 91."}, {"url": "https://dunsgathan.net/sgathan/essays/celtic-hound/", "page_content": "The Celtic Hound\n\nby Saigh Kym Lambert (copyright 1998-2012 \u00a9 Saigh Kym Lambert, all rights reserved do not republish anywhere)\n\nIf you find this article helpful, please considering helping us feed and vet The Beasts\n\nThe Greyhound has long been believed to have originated in the Middle East and to have been the dog of Egypt, then ranging through Europe including among the Celts. Earlier versions of this essay reflected, that belief, while pointing out that such hounds were well known among the Celts early on and the Roman\u2019s knew the rose-eared sighthound known as the Vertragus, the predecessor to the modern Greyhound as well as the Galgo, the Scottish Deerhound, the Irish Wolfhound and the Borzoi (and, it seems, several herding breeds), as \u201cCeltic Hounds.\u201d Arrian (Flavius Arrianus) wrote extensively about the Celtic Greyhound, noting that the Elder Xenophon\u2019s work did not include such dogs as they were unknown to him, a further hint that they were of a more western/northern European origin. (Arrian) We now know from genetic studies that these hounds have a separate lineage from the Middle Eastern Saluki (once thought to be the predecessor of all Sighthounds) and do, in fact, originate with the Celtic culture. (Everything You Know is Wrong, Genetic Structure) (Popular claims that the Greyhound was so popular in the Middle East that it is the only dog mentioned in the Bible do not hold as only the King James version, and perhaps some following suit, translated this as \u201cGreyhound\u201d due to the King\u2019s love of racing Are Greyhounds Really Mentioned in the Bible?)\n\nArrian speaks of the love the Gauls had for coursing and hunting their hounds and we certainly see this in the stories and iconography of the British Isles and Ireland as well. We also see that these hounds might have been seen to have more to offer than just hunting or warfare, there are links to healing, travel and possibly Otherworldly connections. We see a connection between hunting, and perhaps warfare, and healing exemplified within the dog, as Davidson considered that the dual nature of dogs, to be both faithful, loving companion and fierce, destructive guardian mirrors the dual nature of many of the Goddesses (pg. 50, Davidson). Green similarly speculated that while dogs were linked to death through hunting, they had three beneficial characteristics \u201c\u2026fidelity, the guarding instinct and the perceived ability of the dog to heal itself with it\u2019s saliva.\u201d ( pg. 198 Green 1992) The Goddess Nehalenia, who is either German (Davidson) or Gaulish (Green), linked to travel, is often shown with varying sizes of dogs, from small lap dogs to large hunting hounds, as well. (pg 47-50 Davidson, pg. 200-201 Green 1992, pg. 176-180 Green 1995, pg. 10-16 Green 1997) The obvious link that dogs might have to travel is nodded to by Davidson (pg. 47) as possibly offering safe travel, yet dogs ability to find their way should perhaps be taken more seriously as something humans have long been aware of, although their usefulness in the sea travel that Nehalenia is linked to might be more puzzling. Mother Goddesses are often depicted with smaller dogs, according to Green these lapdogs are often interchangeable with fertility symbols of grain or babies and may themselves represent fertility, while Davidson notes that they may have represented protection of the home. (pg. 201 Green 1992, pg. 29 Green 1997, pg 47 Davidson) Green also notes a link between dogs and the underworld, as death guides which does make sense again in their associations with \u201cfinding ones way\u201d and therefore links the Mother Goddess connection with rebirth. (pg. 29 Green 1997) Those of us aware that most \u201clapdogs\u201d started out as vermin catchers, even before being flea catchers, might tend to speculate that protection from the rodents which might eat the grain or nip the babies might have been a consideration as well.\n\nGods also are depicted with or as dogs, especially healers. The British God Noden, who Himself may relate as a \u201cCeltic Mars\u201d as well as possibly cognate to the Irish God Nuada, was never depicted anthropomorphically but dogs of all sizes were commonly found at His healing shrines. (pg. 199 Green 1992, pg. 40, 115, 144 Green 1997) Green also notes that Gaulish healing Gods were also depicted with dog such as a \u201cCeltic Mars\u201d in Mavilly and Apollo Belenus at Saint Sabine. (pg. 198 Green 1992) Hammer-Gods are also shown with dogs, both hounds and smaller terriers in Burgundy. This could link to healing as well, but also abundance and may indicate a hunting connection, according to Green.(pg. 199, 200 Green 1992)\n\nThe image of the hound continued to be an important motif well into Christian times, in Scotland we find Greyhounds depicted in hunt scenes on Class III Pictish stones of Scotland such as the Hilton of Cadboll and Aberlemno stones. The Book of Kells contains many images of dogs, apparently both of hound and alaunt type. Many of the Kells images are popular to day including in some of the clip art I\u2019m using here.\n\nIt is in the tales of Irish heroes where we perhaps come across the strongest evidence of the importance of hounds to any Celtic culture. The most popular ones, Fionn MacCumhal and C\u00fa Chulainn, in fact in both cases there are signs that warrior and hound were totally intertwined. This is most obvious with C\u00fa Chulainn, who himself became \u201cThe Hound of the Smith\u201d when the boy Setanta killed Culainn\u2019s (the Smith\u2019s) hound as a child. He followed Conchobar\u2019s party but his patron, having forgotten the boy was coming, told the smith the dog could be released to guard, when young Setanta arrived the animal attacked him and he ended up killing it. (pg 140-142 English, pg. 17-19 Irish TBC ) It, of course, brings to question what sort of hound might be described in this story, which is referred to as \u00e1rch\u00fa which is translated in the eDIL as \u201cwar-hound\u201d or \u201cslaughter-hound\u201d and is translated in this translation of the tale as \u2018\u201da blood hound, [i.e. a hound brought from overseas, i.e. the whelp of a mastiff.]\u2019 (pg 141 English, pg. 18 Irish TBC ). Given the tendencies of the Greyhounds, of all sizes, to be hunters but not attack dogs, one might question if this hound, which is said to come from Spain (which does seem to generally just mean \u201csomewhere else\u201d in the tales) was indeed perhaps a mastiff-type, as we\u2019ll discuss shortly. This tale does show the importance of such an animal to it\u2019s owner, as it would take time for a pup to be raised to take over the dead hound\u2019s duties which meant the boy had to do so in the meantime. C\u00fa Chulainn held a lifelong connection with hounds, his death coming, in part, due to the breaking of a geas that he never eat dog meat; as he was also prohibited from refusing hospitality offered by a woman, it was an unavoidable breaking of one or the other. (pg 254-255 Stokes)\n\nFionn\u2019s association is more obviously connected to hunting hounds as the Fianna were hunters as well as warriors, so these,were most likely of the Greyhound variety. And his own and the rest of the Fianna\u2019s connection with canines, both hounds and wolves, is something which seems to have been of great importance. Best known, of course, are his nephews or cousins, Bran and Sceolan. Fionn\u2019s aunt, or sometimes sister, Tuiren, was transformed in the Otherworld to a hound bitch and gave birth as such, her sons remaining for life in the form and loyal companions to their uncle/cousin. In some later tales only Bran seems to travel with Fionn, and he now has a poisoned claw which is kept covered by a special shoe. (pg. 197-205 Nagy) There were, however, many other hounds associated with Fionn, including Adhnuall, who died of grief after many of the Fianna died in battle. (pg. 224-226, 238, 271-273 Gregory pg. 94 O\u2019Grady 1898) It is likely that the Fianna would have hunted with sizable packs.\n\nFionn and the rest of the Fianna\u2019s associations with canines, both domestic hound and wild wolf, is actually quite vast. The members of the Fianna, d\u00edberga, went f\u00e1elad or \u201cwolfing.\u201d (pg. 44, 244 n20 Nagy, McCone, West) Fionn\u2019s foster-father F\u00edcail mac Conchinn\u2019s patronymic marks him as \u201cson of Dog-head\u201d and Fionn\u2019s own father\u2019s name \u201cCumall\u201d is noted by Nagy as possibly relating to \u201cc\u00fa\u201d and is the same as part of the name of Conaire\u2019s dog in Togail Bruidne Da Derga. Nagy admits that the name may originally have been \u201cUmall\u201d but finds that the transformation may be significant. Fionn\u2019s grandfather also shares a name with a dog of Medb\u2019s and Nagy finds it notable that Fionn refuses the offer for his nephews to be changed to human considering it better they remain hounds. (pg. 243-244, n19 Nagy)\n\nThe f\u00e9nnid Con\u00e1n mac Morna\u2019s name means \u201clittle dog.\u201d(pg. 44, 154-155 Nagy) and the f\u00e9nnid C\u00e1el is so entwined with both his hounds and horses that when he is killed they died with him. (pg. 245, n22 Nagy) Throughout all the tales \u201cdog\u201d names flourish among warriors, the name c\u00fa glas was a legal term for exiles, who often served as mercenaries, form other lands. (pg. 244, n21 Nagy) Some warriors had their beginnings aided by canines, including Cormac mac Art, who was the king at the time of Fionn. As an infant his mother fell asleep and he was stolen by a she-wolf who raised him until he was found by a hunter. (O\u2019Daly, O\u2019Grady 1892, pg. 64-65 \u00d3 h\u00d3g\u00e1in) Cormac\u2019s father\u2019s enemy, who Cormac would later dispose as king, was named Lugaid Mac Con. It is said he gained the name \u201cson of a hound\u201d because he was suckled by a Greyhound bitch. (pg. 67 \u00d3h\u00d3g\u00e1in)\n\nThe Story of Mac Da Tho\u2019s Pig, tells of a rivalry started for a spectacular hound, Ailbe, belonging to Mac Da Tho. Both Medb and Ailill of Connacht and Conchobar of Ulster want this hound and Mac Da Tho, at the prompting of his wife, promises it to both. As both parties arrive at the same time, a champion\u2019s boasting match develops between those of both sides in regards to the Champion\u2019s Portion of the giant pig, hence the title. The Hound is allowed to choose, and choosing Ulster begins killing the warriors of Connacht. The battle that ensues does not fair well for the reason for it, the hound, is killed and it is said that Mag nAilbe (Ailbe\u2019s Plain) is named for this hound.\n\nPerhaps the best known later legend is that of Llewellyn \u2018s Greyhound Gellert. The hound, his favorite, stays behind one day when Llewellyn goes hunting, and upon his return Llewellyn finds his son\u2019s crib overturned and the dog bloody. Horrified that the beloved animal killed his son, Llewellyn kills the hound then and there&..the dying cries of the faithful Greyhound are echoed by the cries of the baby, hidden beneath the upturned crib. A bit away the body of a wolf is found. Gellert had saved the child from a wolf attack, only to be repaid by death. It is said that \u201cBeth G\u00ealert\u201d means \u201cGellert\u2019s Grave\u201d and is named for him. The literal truth of this tale can be brought into question by the number of similar tales, including an Aesop\u2019s\u2019 Fable and an Indian tale of a heroic mongoose, as well as almost identical Greyhound tales. It remains, of course, a n important lesson in the loyalty of the dog and the suspicious nature of the human. The latest telling of such a story is found in Le Moine et la Sorci\u00e8re ( The Sorceress), where the Greyhound which saves his master\u2019s son from a snake becomes the local Saint of a small French village that so scandalizes the visiting Monk of the title.\n\nWhat breed many of the hounds above were is difficult to determine as such the concept of breeds as we have today is quite modern\u2026.what a dog did was how it was often grouped. Today many think only of the Irish Wolfhound and the Scottish Deerhound as \u201cCeltic Sighthounds\u201d and seem to consider them a different breed from the Greyhound. Ultimately, as shown in Genetic Structure of the Purebred Domestic Dog these all originated as the same hound, as did the Galgo and the Borzoi. With the Galgo Espa\u00f1ol we still see that both hair types, smooth and wiry, can be found within the same breed and this smaller, less extreme in all the ways the others might be, hound may indeed represent the closest to the old-type Vertragus. (Galgo Espa\u00f1ol) At some point the smooth coated Greyhound and the wiry coated Deerhounds and Wolfhounds seemed to have parted ways; it may be that the softer long fur of the Borzoi was also found intermixed but later diverted with specific breeding. The smooth coat of the Greyhounds is believed by many to come at least partially from Lord Orford\u2019s alleged crossing of Greyhounds with Bulldogs (which would be more like American Bulldogs than the modern English Bulldog), however this likely never took place and the resulting loss of speed that would have resulted makes it incredible. (CZARINA \u2013 Bulldog Legend or Mythology?) It\u2019s far more likely just to be part of the selective breeding, possibly only a side effect of breeding the smaller hounds primarily to run hare and while larger ones to run deer, boars and wolves.\n\nThe Irish Wolfhound is problematic, of course, in that it is a fairly recent reconstruction, the original having been essentially wiped out and was recreated by Captain George Augustus Graham of Scotland from supposedly a few remaining originals, Scottish Deerhounds and Great Danes. (Captain Graham) Certainly there were sizable hounds that hunted wolves, boars and deer (but not Irish Elk as some IW enthusiasts have claimed ** ) in Ireland although actual size of these dogs could have been large especially compared to other Greyhounds of the day (which were more likely the size of Galgos). And we can trust that there were dogs that were fierce war-dogs and guards, the Irish \u00e1rch\u00fa. Considering the general nature of Greyhounds, it seems unlikely that these were these same hunting dogs. More likely theses were Alaunts, the predecessors of the mastiff breeds, including the Greate Dane. It is likely, given that \u201cbreeds\u201d weren\u2019t even a consideration, that Alaunts and Greyhounds were often bred together, as Captain Graham later did for the modern Wolfhound. We do know, after all, that both Sighthounds and Alaunts were commonly worked together to hunt larger prey in many other areas it\u2019s likely this also took place in Ireland and Scotland too. ( pg.12-14, Cummins)\n\nIt is, of course, precarious to try to figure out the actual breeds mentioned during this time for \u201cbreed\u201d is a very modern concept and dogs were known for what they did, not their breed. A \u201csighthound,\u201d \u201cgazehound\u201d or \u201cGreyhound\u201d simply hunted by sight and were fast, the Alaunt was big and brought things down with strength, however, as the Alaunts also ran prey down before dropping it, they too were often referred to as \u201cgazehounds.\u201d (pg.15, Cummins) Therefore while \u201cc\u00fa\u201d in Irish is often seen as being a \u201csighthound\u201d it may well have covered any dog of any breeding which ran down prey, while \u201c\u00e1rch\u00fa\u201d might relate to any dog which showed a talent for guarding. Likewise, when one speaks of \u201cdeer\u201d hounds or \u201cwolf\u201d hounds it would originally have been what the hound hunted, not necessarily a breed. The \u201cwolfhound\u201d would become a \u201cdeerhound\u201d after the wolves were hunted to extinction.\n\nThe images of Celtic warriors surrounded by hounds is evocative to many Celtic Polytheists today, I know many who have noted their desire to someday have an Irish Wolfhound or a Scottish Deerhound which they envision as the ultimate Gaelic dog. These are also dogs which are expensive and seldom found in rescue (and rather short lived and with small, problematic gene pools) . I admit to having always had a bit of an agenda with this article, to remind those who might be in a position to actually give their lives to a dog, or a few dogs, not to forget that the \u201clowly\u201d ex-racing Greyhound has just as much of a Celtic heritage as they their hairier kin. While it\u2019s not a reason to get a dog, a huge and serious responsibility, if one is in the place to give a good forever home there is no reason to wait for \u201cthe day\u201d when so many Greyhounds are waiting to be adopted. If someone is already considering a commitment to a Sighthound, which may require considerations that some other breeds do not due to prey-drive and lack of call-back, then the Greyhound is certainly the one I would consider first even if one still holds out to someday have something larger and hairier as well. There is still a need, although it seems less interest lately, for adoption. The Galgo too is still endangered in it\u2019s own country where it\u2019s been considered a \u201cgarbage dog\u201d and is also a \u201cproper Celtic hound.\u201d\n\nThere are many ex-racing Greyhound kennels out there, we have adopted all our hounds through one in NH NH Greyhound Placement Service , except for one from Maine GPS. As I do consider adoption, regardless of the breed you do choose, the best way to find possible candidates for Deerhounds (although the low numbers of the breed today mean there are few available in rescue situations and many have health issues) or Wolfhounds is through the breed clubs which are the same places to learn about responsible breeders if you do choose to buy, in the US they are Scottish Deerhound Club of America and Irish Wolfhound Club of America. Galgos are being aided by groups such as GRIN \u2013 Galgo Rescue International Network and have become more of a \u201cthing\u201d in the US the past few years as many who are rescue minded stopped working with rehoming NGA Greyhounds as they are not rescues. I might note that previous positive experience with owning another Sighthound like Greyhounds does improve your candidacy as an adopter of these other Sighthounds. But don\u2019t forget that the racing Greyhound is as much the Celtic hound as the \u201cCeltic breeds\u201d are, yourlocal US adoption group can be found at this link. As more and more states ban racing, there is some more immediate need for adopters of NGA Greyhounds, although in a matter of years these running dogs will become rarer, a healthy Greyhound may be as difficult to find as a healthy Deerhound in the coming decades. Regardless of what dog you bring into your life, always remember that this is a commitment made for the life of that dog. Sadly, sometimes the \u201cromance\u201d of living with an ancient breed doesn\u2019t always last, I know of reenactors who have adopted Greyhounds only to dump them after a few months when they discover this \u201cprop\u201d eats, shits and needs vet care. Don\u2019t be that person.\n\nIf you found this of interest or use, please do consider the work put into it and help out\n\nI have additional related articles that have been published in Air n-Aithesc related to canine warriors and may eventually be selling PDF copies again. \u201cGoing into Wolf-shape\u201d discussing the canine nature of the Irish warrior with some look at Proto-Indo-European roots was in Vol. 1 Issue 1, Imbolc 2014 . \u201cThe War Goddess\u2019s Bitch\u201c about female canine-humans and some personal stuff was in Vol. 3 Issue 1, Imbolc/Bealtaine 2016 and \u201cThe Hounds Betwixt and Between: C\u00fa Chulainn and Finn as Liminal Heroes\u201d which includes some on their canine nature was in Vol. 4 Issue 2, Lughnasadh/Samhain 2017.

Many Irish Wolfhound enthusiasts still insist, sadly, that the Irish Elk lived into historical times. I believe that this stems from the confusion of what an Elk really is especially among Americans. American Elks are not Elks, but a type of deer closely related to the Red Deer that are found in the British Isles. The true American elk is the Moose, for which we use a corruption of a Native name for\u2026.. and the Irish Elk would to us appear to be a giant moose and was a relative as are other European Elk which are \u201cmoose.\u201d The Red Deer of the British Isles is a close relative of the American Elk or Waputi. There were rather unlikely to have been Irish Wolfhounds being used to hunt these animals\u2026.the period in which they thrived in Ireland before becoming extinct is one with no sign of human settlement in Ireland\u2026Early Stone Age.

The character was created by Geoffrey of Monmouth in his History of the Kings of Britain (1136 CE) where he first appears as a wise and precocious youth with prophetic powers. The French poet Robert Wace (c. 1110-1174 CE) then translated Geoffrey's work and added to it in his Roman de Brut (c. 1160 CE). Merlin was later featured as the central character of the Merlin by Robert de Boron (12th century CE) who cast him as a Christian prophet, and this depiction, with some variation, would continue in the Vulgate Cycle (1215-1235 CE) and the Post-Vulgate Cycle (c. 1240-1250 CE) to influence Malory's final characterization of the seer.\n\nIn Malory, Merlin is Arthur's mentor, instrumental in every aspect of his life from his conception to his education, his rise to power, and his vision of a kingdom ruled through justice and goodwill. Merlin is central to the lives of all the main characters of the legend, able to see both past and future, eager to advise and be of service, but unable to alter what he knows must be.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nFrom his earliest appearance in medieval literature, Merlin has remained among the most popular characters in the legends. He may have originally been a fertility god or spirit, feared or revered for his great wisdom and magical abilities, and this concept of Merlin was revived in 19th-century CE romantic literature. Since then, he has appeared in or influenced numerous works of fiction, film, and other media, almost always depicted or referenced in this same way, as a powerful mage.\n\nName & Origin\n\nMerlin's character originated in Welsh folklore featuring the wildman-in-the-woods motif, a half-savage on the fringe of civilization possessing great power & wisdom.\n\nMerlin first appears in literature in the History of the Kings of Britain by the Welsh cleric Geoffrey of Monmouth (c. 1100 - c. 1155 CE). The Merlin character's name is not a proper name (designating an individual in this case) but a toponym (a place name), specifically the Welsh Caermyrddin (\u201cMerlin's Town\u201d), referring to the city of Carmarthen, Merlin's birthplace. Geoffrey Latinized Myrddin as Merlinus because the strict Latinization of Merdinus would have associated the name with the Latin merdus (feces, dung). The character originated in Welsh folklore featuring the wildman-in-the-woods motif, a half-savage who lived on the fringe of civilization possessing great power and wisdom.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nThe most famous Welsh wildman was Myrddin Wyllt (\u201cMyrddin the Wild\u201d), a 6th-century CE bard who was said to have gone insane after a particularly bloody battle and retreated to the woods. Geoffrey wrote a short work, The Prophecies of Merlin (c. 1130 CE), prior to his famous history but this Merlin has nothing to do with the wizard of the Arthurian Legends. After the success of his History, Geoffrey wrote another work, The Life of Merlin (c. 1150 CE), in which the main character exhibits magical and prophetic skills but this work is unconnected to the Arthurian Legends.\n\nGeoffrey's Merlin\n\nIn Geoffrey's History, Merlin features as a prominent character in Books VI-VIII. King Vortigern, the usurper, is having trouble building a tower because the foundation will not stand firm. His wizards advise him to find a youth in the kingdom who had no father and sacrifice him, sprinkling his blood with the mortar, and then the foundation would be sound. Vortigern sends out his ministers to find such a youth, and they come upon Merlin whose mother tells them he has no earthly father but that she was visited by a spirit who took the form of a man and impregnated her.\n\nLove History? Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter!\n\nMerlin is brought before the king who explains his problem and how he must sacrifice the boy, but Merlin, unimpressed, commands the wizards be brought to him so he can show they are lying. He asks them what is beneath the foundation that prevents it standing firm, and they cannot answer. He then tells Vortigern that he will find a pool beneath it and tells him to call his workmen and rip the foundation up. They find the pool as Merlin said, and he then asks the wizards what is in the pool. Again they cannot answer, and Merlin tells them they will find two hollow stones and two sleeping dragons inside, one white and one red, all of which they find when they drain the pool.\n\nVortigern meets Merlin Schekinov Alexey Victorovich (Public Domain)\n\nIn Book VII, Merlin interprets the meaning of the dragons and foretells the future. The red dragon symbolizes the Britons and the white one the Saxons whom Vortigern has invited into his kingdom. The white dragon will oppress the red dragon until the Boar of Cornwall rises to drive the Saxons out; a prophecy concerning King Arthur and his future victory over the Saxons. Vortigern's illegitimate rule is challenged in Book VIII by the noble Ambrosius Aurelius and his brother Uther Pendragon and, when Vortigern is killed, he is succeeded by Ambrosius.\n\nThe kingdom is still in conflict, however, and Ambrosius must battle the Saxons. After a great victory, he commands a memorial to be built and Merlin moves the giant mystical stones from Mount Killare in Ireland to Amesbury outside London for this purpose, thus creating Stonehenge. Ambrosius is killed by the Saxons, and Uther then becomes king and allies with Gorlois of Cornwall but falls in love with Gorlois' wife Igerna.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nMerlin casts a spell which makes Uther look like Gorlois, and he sleeps with her, thus conceiving Arthur. Gorlois dies in battle and Uther marries Igerna and then sometime later dies from drinking from a spring poisoned by his Saxon enemies. Arthur becomes king, avenges his father and uncle, and drives the Saxons from Britain. Merlin disappears from the narrative after arranging Uther's night with Igerna with no explanation given. Books IX-XII of the History focus on Arthur's conquests, his betrayal by Mordred who abducts Guinevere, and the Battle of Camlann in which Arthur is mortally wounded and his knights mostly killed.\n\nWace, Chretien, & Robert de Boron\n\nRobert Wace translated Geoffrey's History but added to the story from his imagination. Like many French poets of his time, he was patronized by Eleanor of Aquitaine (c. 1122-1204 CE) to whom he dedicated the work. Wace is responsible for some of the most famous aspects of the Arthurian Legends such as the Round Table and the name of Arthur's sword, Excalibur. He also developed the main characters more fully, especially Merlin in the Stonehenge episode which, although it follows Geoffrey's closely, makes more of Merlin's magical abilities.\n\nThe great Arthurian poet Chretien de Troyes (c. 1130-1190 CE), mentions Merlin only once in his Erec and Enide (lines 6617-6618) and only in reference to a tradition dating back to Merlin's time. Robert de Boron is the next to develop the character from Wace's work in his Merlin (c. 1200 CE). This poem opens with a group of demons plotting the destruction of the world by creating a supernatural being whose evil will rival the good of Christ. This creature will be half-human and half-devil and, to that end, they possess a pious man of means and sleep with his daughter. The daughter tells her confessor what happened (seemingly knowing her father was possessed) and he blesses her with the sign of the cross as protection; now the child will be born with supernatural abilities but without the evil spirit the demons were counting on.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nMerlin and His Mother Before King Vortigern British Library (Public Domain)\n\nWhen Merlin is born, he is baptized, and this ritual along with his mother's natural piety and goodness and the protective blessing she received shortly after conceiving Merlin, all contribute to his nature as inherently good while the supernatural circumstances of his conception endow him with skills in magical arts. He can speak almost as soon as he is born, and before he is three years old is able to tell the story of Joseph of Arimathea and how he brought the Holy Grail to Britain (the subject of Robert de Boron's earlier poem Joseph of Arimathea). Merlin grows up with his mother in peace until the usurper king Vertigier sends out his ministers to find a fatherless child to sacrifice because the foundation of his tower will not stand firm.\n\nRobert's narrative then follows Geoffrey's and Wace's almost exactly, right down to Merlin disguising Uther as the husband of the beautiful queen (named Ygerne here) and Arthur's conception. When Arthur is born, Uther gives him to Merlin who places him with a foster family who know nothing of his royal birth. Arthur's identity is revealed when he draws the sword of the king from an anvil, thus establishing himself as the son and heir of Uther.\n\nRobert's Merlin is a sequel to his earlier Joseph of Arimathea and was possibly the second work of a trilogy which concluded with a work on Perceval and the grail. Robert's most significant contribution to the Arthurian tales was their Christianization which would influence later writers. The grail, previously a platter, now became the Holy Grail, the cup of Christ. Merlin, though still a fringe figure, became a Christian seer and Arthur and his knights became champions and defenders of the Christian cause. Arthur as a Christian king is evident from Geoffrey onwards, but in Geoffrey's History and Wace's Brut, Arthur is fighting for his country and people first and calling on Christ to support that effort; after Robert de Boron, Arthur is in service to Christ first and all his great accomplishments follow from his devotion to God.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nVulgate Cycle & Prose Merlin\n\nThe Vulgate Cycle continued and developed this tradition and also marks the first time the Arthurian Legends appear in prose. In the Middle Ages, prose was used for works on history, theology, or philosophy which were considered \u201cserious\u201d subjects; poetry was used for works of the imagination. The anonymous authors of the Vulgate Cycle chose their form purposefully because they wished to present the subject as actual history, not fanciful romance.\n\nThe Vulgate Cycle begins with a history of the Holy Grail, moves to Merlin's birth and involvement with Arthur, highlights Lancelot's affair with Guinevere, establishes the importance of the knights' quest for the Holy Grail, and ends with Arthur's death after the Battle of Camlann. The Vulgate Cycle (edited and revised as the Post-Vulgate Cycle) inspired another work, the Prose Merlin. This piece, dated to the mid-15th century CE (shortly before Malory wrote Le Morte D'Arthur), was written in Middle English and focuses entirely on Merlin as hero and central character against the backdrop of the Arthurian world.\n\nThe Prose Merlin relies heavily on Robert de Boron's Merlin but adds significant details such as the specific reason for the demon's plot to impregnate a female human with a demonic child. As referenced in the Bible, following Christ's death on the cross he descended into hell to free the patriarchs imprisoned there (an act known as the Harrowing of Hell). This event upset the balance of hell and so the demons enact their plan to create a human agent on earth who will counter Christ's rescue of the souls and send more down to Satan's realm. The author also explains that Merlin was named for his pious Christian grandfather, thereby cutting any association of the seer with Myrddin of the Welsh pagan tradition.\n\nDevils Plotting the Birth of Merlin, Vulgate Cycle British Library (Public Domain)\n\nThe Prose Merlin follows Robert de Boron for its first five sections which are then followed by two sequels known by scholars as the historical continuation (Prose Merlin Sequel) and the romantic continuation (Suite du Merlin, also known as the Huth Merlin because it is contained in the Huth Manuscript of the British Library). The historical continuation picks up where Robert's Merlin ends, with Arthur drawing the sword from the anvil, (only now it is a sword in a stone), and then tells the story of Arthur's struggle against his rebellious barons, formation of the court, and exploits.\n\nThe romantic continuation develops all of the more mythical aspects of the Arthurian Legends such as Arthur receiving Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake, Arthur's enchantment which leads to him fathering Mordred, the formation of the Round Table, the Lancelot-Guinevere affair, and how Nimue (also given as Vivienne and Niniane in other works, Merlin's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and lover) traps Merlin, sealing him forever in a world he cannot escape which only she has access to, thus condemning him to an eternal death-in-life and removing the character from the narrative. All of the more resonant elements of the Arthurian universe are developed in this work but Malory would bring the story further to its finished form.\n\nMalory's Merlin\n\nSir Thomas Malory was a political prisoner at Newgate, London 1468-1470 CE when he wrote Le Morte D'Arthur. Although his primary source was the Post-Vulgate Cycle, scholars agree that he probably had access to a good library and was well-read in Arthurian lore. Malory's Merlin is the final culmination of all the other versions of the seer pre-1469 CE: a powerful wizard of prophetic insight who can control the elements, shape-shift, alter other people's perception of reality, and read people's hearts and true desires. Malory almost certainly drew on the Prose Merlin for the core of his character but developed him to a much deeper degree.\n\nMalory's Merlin is a powerful wizard who can control the elements, shape-shift, alter others' perception of reality, and read people's hearts.\n\nAs in the earlier works, Merlin is born of a noble woman and a demon, assists Uther in conceiving Arthur, and places the boy with the foster family of Sir Ector after his birth. Arthur grows up as squire to his older foster-brother Kay and serves him at tournaments. At one such event, he finds he has forgotten to bring Kay's sword from the tent and, on his way back, sees a sword in a stone. He draws it and brings it to Kay who recognizes it as the king's sword and tries to pretend he drew it but he is found to be lying. Arthur then returns the sword to the stone and again draws it easily, proving he is the heir to the throne.\n\nMerlin returns to Arthur's life after this event, counsels him in kingship and just rule, and remains an ever-present figure orchestrating events behind the scenes or trying to convince others to listen to their better natures. He tells Arthur that Guinevere will be unfaithful to him with Lancelot the moment Arthur announces his intention to marry her but Arthur will not listen. Merlin grooms Nimue as his successor and falls completely in love with her, losing his perspective. He has no idea how ambitious Nimue is until after he has taught her the breadth of his magical knowledge and she then imprisons him. With Merlin gone, Arthur loses his trusted counselor, and once the affair of Lancelot and Guinevere comes to light, the unity and vision of the Round Table is lost, Mordred usurps the throne, and the kingdom falls after the climactic Battle of Camlann.\n\nConclusion\n\nThroughout all of these works, Merlin is central to the narrative and the character remains among the most popular of the Arthurian Legends. Welsh writers following Geoffrey wrote their own works about the seer. Italian and Spanish poets drew on the French and Welsh traditions to feature Merlin in their own works and his popularity is attested by the number of complete works or fragments of manuscripts from the Middle Ages which mention or feature him. Scholar Peter H. Goodrich comments:\n\nMerlin, the prophet and magus, is historically the second-best known character from medieval literature, barely outstripped by his liege lord King Arthur. Beyond literature, he has entered our public consciousness to an even grater extent than Arthur, through the association of his name with all kinds of technological devices and commodities, many of them not in the least Arthurian. (1)\n\nThe character has influenced the concept of the wizard, mage, sorcerer, and wise man since his first appearance in Geoffrey's History and writers such as J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, and J. K. Rowling, among many others, have acknowledged as much regarding their works. Scholar William W. Kibler notes how this is due to the compelling nature of the character:\n\nMerlin is constantly at the center of the action, predicting events and using his magical powers to control history. He is puckish and benevolent and constantly makes use of his shape-shifting powers to aid and befuddle. (Lacy, 384)\n\nThe Arthurian Legends fell out of favor during the Renaissance but Merlin remained as popular as ever. Pilgrimages were regularly made to Merlin's Spring (also known as the Fountain of Barenton) in Broceliande, Brittany for its healing powers until the practice was prohibited by the Vatican in 1853 CE. Interest in the Arthurian Legends generally was revived soon after by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, through is popular Idylls of the King in 1859 CE.\n\nSince then, the legends have been reimagined countless times to reflect the various zeitgeist of the eras in which they are written, and Merlin continues as one of the most compelling characters. Merlin is featured in countless films, games, television shows, novels, and short fiction. Even when he is not mentioned by name, his persona still infuses or influences that of every wizard, in any form, who has come after him."}, {"url": "https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/fragments-found-book-story-merlin-0011418", "page_content": "A lucky discovery in a rare book has the potential to transform our knowledge of perhaps the most famous story from the entire Middle Ages. Some damaged manuscript pages found inside the volume are from the 13th century and they narrate the adventures of Merlin the magician, a key figure in the legendary tales of King Arthur and Camelot. The find is an astounding one and it is already changing our understanding of the Arthurian myths and legends.\n\nSeven Fragments Found in Old Volume\n\nThe Birmingham Mail reports that Michael Richardson, from the University of Bristol's special collections library was examining some volumes published in the 1500s that were written by Jean Gerson (1363- 1429), a noted theologian and Church reformer. Richardson, as he opened one of the volumes, saw something curious. He found seven fragments of a handwritten manuscript that had been bound into the book. Intrigued he studied them and according to the BBC he \u201crecognized a number of Arthurian names\u201d. He suspected that the pieces of manuscript were on the Arthurian legends, a series of stories that are probably based on a Romano-British king who fought the Anglo-Saxon invaders after the fall of the Roman Empire.\n\nA New Story of Merlin\n\nThe librarian promptly contacted Dr. Leah Tether, who is a leading figure in the International Arthurian Society, a group dedicated to the research of the legends, history, and literature on King Arthur. Dr. Tether immediately compiled a team of specialists to investigate the fragments and they were amazed at what they discovered. The Irish Examiner reports that the \u201cseven pieces are thought to come from the Old French sequence of texts known as the Vulgate Cycle or Lancelot-Grail Cycle, dating back to the 13th century\u201d.\n\nLeft to right: Leah Tether, Laura Chuhan Campbell, Michael Richardson, and Benjamin Pohl with the books in Bristol Central Library\u2019s Rare Books Room.

( University of Bristol )\n\nThese are among the most important texts in the Arthurian tradition and they were used by Thomas Mallory in his influential work Morte d\u2019Arthur (1485), which more than any single work popularized the story of King Arthur, Merlin, and the Round Table. The pieces of pages appear to relate the story of Merlin but according to the BBC there are \u201csubtle but significant differences from the traditional story\u201d.\n\n\"How Arthur by the means of Merlin got Excalibur, his sword of the Lady of the Lake\", illustration for Le Morte Darthur. (Lagad Zoltec / Public Domain )\n\nThe scribe who wrote the manuscript provides more details than in the existing texts such as the work by Geoffrey of Monmouth (12th century AD) on Merlin and his adventures. Significantly, the deaths of some characters are different from the traditional accounts and there are more detailed descriptions of key events such as battles.\n\nMore Details about the Arthurian Legends\n\nResearches are intrigued as to how the fragments came to be bound into a book that was printed in Strasbourg, then part of the Holy Roman Empire and how they ended up in Bristol. It seems that the loose pages were probably bound into the book in England. Experts have noted that there is a strong connection between the Bristol area and the Arthurian Legends. This may mean that the fragments are part of an earlier period.\n\nAt present specialists from the Universities of Durham and Bristol are working on the texts and hope that they may provide even more details on Merlin and King Arthur. The writing has proven very difficult to read and furthermore, the fragments are damaged as a result of being bound into the volume. According to the Daily Mail \u201ccutting-edge analysis and infrared techniques will be used to try to read the ancient prose\u201d. These could help experts understand more about the origins of the myths, something which has perplexed academics and writers for centuries.\n\nDuring the 12th century, Arthur's character began to be marginalized by the accretion of \"Arthurian\" side-stories such as that of Tristan and Iseult, by John William Waterhouse.

In his many iterations, Merlin is most often associated with the legendary King Arthur thanks to Geoffrey of Monmouth\u2019s History of the Kings of Britain , published in 1135, which was the spark that caused the explosion in popularity for both of these characters. However, in a lesser known text by the same author, the Vita Merlini , Geoffrey reveals the many other faces of the powerful magician.\n\nOver the centuries, Merlin has come to be known as a sorcerer who pulled the strings of fate and masterminded the course of history. He is those things and more in Geoffrey\u2019s History, but his Vita Merlini tells the story of \u201cthe madness of the prophetic bard\u201d Merlin. In the Vita, we see another side of the prophet and advisor to kings, who acted as the architect of history - a side that is both mystical and powerful, but all at once more human.\n\nThe Vita Merlini tells the sotry of the madness of the prophetic bard Merlin. ( liuzishan / Adobe Stock)\n\nMerlin the Prophet: Geoffrey of Monmouth and his Merlinic Prophecies\n\nThe Merlin we have come to know through popular literature was first introduced in Book 6 of Geoffrey of Monmouth\u2019s History. Although he is more famous for his role as advisor to King Arthur , his first advisory role was to King Vortigern. In a retelling of the story of Ambrosius, borrowed from an earlier text known as the Historia Brittonum , Geoffrey introduces Merlin as the fatherless son of a princess of Demetia.\n\nIn this tale, Merlin is brought before Vortigern to act as a human sacrifice to fortify the foundations of the king\u2019s castle. Instead, Merlin advises the king that his tower would not stand because underneath it lay a pool in which two dragons fought, a red and a white. After his prophetic vision is proven to be true, Vortigern spares Merlin\u2019s life and elevates him to the position of royal advisor.\n\nIn this version, Merlin is no mere human but is actually a supernatural being. Far from being a fatherless bastard, Merlin is said to be fathered by one of the \u201cspirits whom we call incubi... part human, part angel, and take on human form at will and sleep with women.\u201d Some more modern interpretations of the story of Merlin\u2019s birth paint him as the son of the Devil, and portray his supernatural abilities as the work of evil, but in the Middle Ages his role as a prophet would have made Merlin a holy figure.\n\nMedieval writers considered prophecy to be direct communication from God. In fact, these prophecies were highly valued by historians as one of the most certain sources of historical information, providing an assured framework for the course of history. The art of prophecy actually has biblical roots, such as the prophecies of King Saul, but in later centuries it came to be seen as something repellent to the Christian faith.\n\nProphecies were an enormously popular form of literature in the Middle Ages, partly due to their malleability which allowed them to be molded to fit historical events in any era - a vague prophecy was impossible to prove wrong. Prophecy was a useful tool, particularly as political propaganda to glorify a ruler or justify their actions and ideas.\n\nGeoffrey of Monmouth\u2019s Merlinic prophecies were actually more popular than the Historia Regum Brittaniae to which they belonged. They were published separately as an individual volume which was translated into several different languages, including Icelandic and French.\n\nAlthough Geoffrey popularized Merlinic prophecies, he did not invent it but rather borrowed from a much earlier Celtic tradition of prophetiae often attributed to a bard known as Myrddin. It was Geoffrey who merged the Welsh bard Myrddin with the supernatural diviner Ambrosius from the Historia Brittonum in order to create the character of Merlin, messenger of history.\n\nMerlin taking away the infant Arthur. ( Public domain )\n\nMerlin the Architect and Puppeteer in the Story of King Arthur\n\nMore than just a messenger of history, the Merlin of Geoffrey\u2019s Historia was also a powerful sorcerer who manipulated the course of history to set in motion the chain of events he himself foretold - the most famous example of course being the birth of Arthur. It is a familiar story: overcome with desire for Igerna, the wife of the Duke of Cornwall, King Uther Pendragon calls on his advisor, Merlin, to seek out a way to reach the object of his desire, stowed away in Tintagel castle by her husband. Merlin advises the king that:\n\n\u201cTo accomplish your desire, you must make use of such arts as have not been heard of in your time. I know how, by the force of my medicines, to give you the exact likeness of Gorlois, so that in all respects you shall seem to be no other than himself. If you will therefore obey my prescriptions, I will metamorphose you into the true semblance of Gorlois,\u2026 and in this disguise you may go safely to the town where Igerna is, and have admittance to her.\u201d\n\nThus was \u201cthe most renowned Arthur\u201d conceived, and the fulfilment of Merlin\u2019s prophecies began. Merlin remains an important figure in Arthur\u2019s story throughout Geoffrey of Monmouth\u2019s works, but not as a hero who takes part in the action. Instead Merlin stays in the background until he is called upon in his role as royal advisor and sage. Like the puppeteer pulling invisible strings, Merlin is the architect whose guiding hand helps to shape history in the same way Geoffrey himself does as a writer of history.\n\nMerlin\u2019s character takes on even more significance when we see him as the embodiment of the historian himself, within his own story. Merlin as a metafictional construct, placed in the narrative to bring authority and validity to the story, helps the reader interpret events and shapes their perceptions.\n\nIn short, Merlin becomes larger than life: more than a man, more than a prophet, even more than a sorcerer. It is this fantastical, superhuman version of Merlin that came to be the dominant version portrayed in later literature, but in the Vita Merlini we see a different portrayal of Merlin. The Merlin of the Vita is less of a metafictional enigma, and instead is a much more physical, emotionally complex, human character.\n\nIllustration depicting Merlin from the Nuremberg Chronicle. ( Public domain )\n\nMerlin - the Wild Man of Vita Merlini\n\nGeoffrey of Monmouth is believed to have written the Vita Merlini around the year 1150, approximately 15 years after his master work, the Historia Regum Brittaniae , was first published. The poem survives to this day in only one complete manuscript from the 13th century, as well as a scattering of partial copies. In some of these copies, Merlin is referred to as Merlini Calidonii , which at once implies that he is a different man from the Merlin of the Historia. However, there is little doubt Geoffrey of Monmouth intended that they be perceived as the same man from the description he gives of his character:\n\n\u201cMerlin the Briton was held famous in the world. He was a king and prophet; to the proud people of the South Welsh he gave laws, and to the chieftains he prophesied the future.\u201d\n\nMerlin inherited rule of the Southern Welsh kingdom of Demetia, which we know from the Historia that he is entitled to through his mother\u2019s line. Although no mention of Arthur is made until later in the poem, it is made clear that Merlin is indeed the same man who served the legendary king and Vortigern before him, as Merlin recalls the famous prophecies he made as a young man:\n\n\u201cAll these things I formerly predicted more at length to Vortigern in explaining to him the mystic war of the two dragons when we sat on the banks of the drained pool.\u201d\n\nThis version of Merlin is still a powerful diviner and sage, but he is no longer a sorcerer. In fact, the Merlin of the Vita is a war veteran suffering from psychological trauma after the horrors he witnessed on the battlefield and so, seeking sanctuary in the wilderness, chooses to live as a hermit in the woods:\n\n\u201cAt this sight, Merlin, you grieved and poured out sad complaints throughout the army, and cried out in these words, \u2018Could injurious fate be so harmful as to take from me so many and such great companions, whom recently so many kings and so many remote kingdoms feared? O dubious lot of mankind!\u2019 \u2026 He became a silvan man just as though devoted to the woods. For a whole summer after this, hidden like a wild animal, he remained buried in the woods, found by no one and forgetful of himself and of his kindred.\u201d\n\nIn this version of the story, Merlin is cast as the traditional Celtic \u201c wild man \u201d, taking the character back towards the roots of his origin as the wandering Welsh bard, Myrddin. There are several examples from other cultures in the region of \u201cwild men\u201d bearing similarities to the Vita Merlini , including the Scottish tales of Lailoken and the Irish sage of Suibhne. Stories of traumatized soldiers or simple hermits taking sanctuary in the woods to live as wild men can be found dating back thousands of years, but the idea was so entrenched in the cultures of Celtic peoples that it became part of their languages and literature.\n\nSome of Merlin\u2019s prophecies are directly borrowed from Celtic stories, such as the triple-death prophecy which also appears in the story of Lailoken. Merlin correctly predicts the \u201cthree-fold death\u201d of a young man by falling from a rock, in a tree, and in a river:\n\n\u201cMeanwhile it happened, while his impetuosity was leading him on, that his horse slipped from a high rock and the man fell over a precipice into the river, but so that one of his feet caught in a tree, and the rest of his body was submerged in the stream. Thus he fell, and was drowned, and hung from a tree, and by his threefold death made the prophet a true one.\u201d\n\nThe difference in this case however, is that unlike the other Celtic wild men stories, Merlin is not a fugitive or social outcast. He is not a madman fleeing his persecutors, nor is he a sinner seeking absolution for the wrongs he has done, he is merely a soldier suffering sadness from being witness to slaughter and he displays his humanity in his suffering and trauma.\n\nThe character of Merlin depicted by Geoffrey in Vita is somewhat closer to a holy man or even a saint. ( hikolaj2 / Adobe Stock)\n\nMerlin the Holy Man\n\nFar from being a madman or a sinner, the Merlin character Geoffrey wrote in the Vita is somewhat closer to a holy man or even a saint. Again following in Celtic tradition, Geoffrey\u2019s Merlin follows the same biographical patterns as the hagiographies of several saints - for example, the miraculous nature of his birth as the offspring of a human and an incubus.\n\nWhile some would choose to interpret Merlin\u2019s parentage as evil and paint him as a sinner, Geoffrey chooses to paint a more saint-like image, giving Merlin other qualities usually attributed to saints including his close relationship with nature and animals, as well as the choice to live a hermit\u2019s lifestyle.\n\nThe Merlin of the Vita is a harmonic counterpoint to the heroic traditions that underlie Geoffrey\u2019s Historia, offering a reflection on the human toll of military heroism and suggesting religious spiritualism as a solution to the destruction wrought by the warrior lifestyle. Merlin finds healing and peace through spiritualism, and experiences a religious rebirth the likes of which can be found in most hagiographies of saints.\n\nWhen Merlin hears of a fountain of water that has burst out of the ground at the foot of the mountain, he rushes to witness this Divine miracle:\n\n\u201cSoon afterward, becoming thirsty, he leaned down to the stream and drank freely and bathed his temples in its waves, so that the water passed through the passages of bowels and stomach, settling the vapors within him, and at once he regained his reason and knew himself, and all his madness departed and the sense which had long remained torpid in him revived, and he remained what he had once been - sane and intact with his reason restored. Therefore, praising God, he turned his face toward the stars and uttered devout words of praise.\u201d\n\nOnce again, Merlin is somewhat larger than life, following in the footsteps of legendary saints and holy men that came before, but in this version of the story he remains very much human. The Merlin Geoffrey wrote in the Historia is less a man and more a supernatural being with almost omniscient power, and this is the version of his character that has captivated imaginations for almost a millennium. The version of Merlin seen in the Vita, while far overshadowed by his alternate personality, is much more sympathetic and relatable while also retaining his power and mystery.\n\nWhile not as popular as the image of Merlin the sorcerer, offspring of Infernal forces, it is the image of Merlin the hermit and holy man that will likely endure the test of time. Rooted in far older traditions and more deeply entrenched in ancient Celtic cultures, the legend of the \u201cmad prophetic bard\u201d Merlin will likely persist quietly in the background for centuries to come.\n\nTop image: The many faces of the famed medieval sorcerer, Merlin.

The public demand for more Holmes stories, however, and the fact that there was patently much more money to be made out of him eventually proved irresistible.\n\nThe tale of the great detective\u2019s Dartmoor adventure, which its author described as \u2018the inevitable relapse after repentance\u2019 and which became perhaps the best-known in the whole Holmes canon, first appeared in monthly instalments in the Strand Magazine between August 1901 and April 1902. In book form, The Hound of the Baskervilles: Another Adventure of Sherlock Holmes, with illustrations by Sidney Paget, was published in London in March 1902 by George Newnes, who printed 25,000 copies at six shillings each, with a further 15,000 copies for India and the British Colonies on April 2nd. The American edition of 70,000 copies at $1.25 came out on April 15th.\n\nMuch ink and accusations of plagiarism have been spilled over the story\u2019s origins. Conan Doyle\u2019s initial inspiration came from a young journalist friend named Bertram Fletcher Robinson, nicknamed \u2018Bobbles\u2019, with whom he spent four days on a seaside golfing holiday at Cromer in Norfolk in the spring of 1901. While they were there, Robinson told Doyle the legend of a ghostly hound on Dartmoor and the two men decided to write what the latter called \u2018a real creeper\u2019 together. Robinson lived at Ipplepen, near Newton Abbot in South Devon, and the two friends went there to investigate Dartmoor. Robinson wrote later that Doyle \u2018listened eagerly to my stories of the ghost hounds, of the headless riders and of the devils that lurk in the hollows \u2013 legends upon which I had been reared, for my home lay on the borders of the moor.\u2019 They stayed at Robinson\u2019s home and at Rowe\u2019s Duchy Hotel at Princetown near the prison, whose governor, deputy governor, chaplain and doctor solemnly came, as Robinson noted, \u2018to pay a call on Mr Sherlock Holmes\u2019, to Doyle\u2019s irritation. He and Robinson explored the moor together and appropriated the surname of Robinson\u2019s coachman, Harry Baskerville.\n\nDoyle decided early on to make the tale a Sherlock Holmes mystery, presumed to be an episode in Holmes\u2019 earlier career, before his fatal grapple with Professor Moriarty at the Reichenbach Falls. Writing to the editor of the Strand Magazine, Herbert Greenhough Smith, to tell him about the new story, he stipulated that Fletcher Robinson\u2019s name must appear as joint author. \u2018I can answer for the yarn being all my own in my own style without dilution, since your readers like that. But he gave me the central idea and the local colour, and so I feel his name must appear.\u2019 This was finally watered down to a note added to the first part, recording Doyle\u2019s indebtedness to Fletcher Robinson, to whom \u2018this story owes its inception\u2019 and \u2018who has helped me both in the general plot and in the local details.\u2019 The British and American editions in book form also acknowledged Robinson\u2019s help.\n\nDoyle had told Greenhough Smith that \u2018as far as I can judge the revival of Holmes would attract a great deal of attention\u2019. This proved to be an understatement. The publication in the Strand Magazine was a sensational success. All over the country, queues formed to buy copies and the magazine had to go to a seventh printing for the only time in its history.\n\nWhether Robinson contributed anything much more to The Hound of the Baskervilles than the dog is not clear. He evidently had a share of the initial royalties, but comments he made at different times suggest that he himself was not really sure how much of the credit he deserved. The story\u2019s imaginative force and the skill in the telling surely came from Conan Doyle. However, Robinson, who died young in 1907, did help to bring Sherlock Holmes back to life. The huge success of The Hound on both sides of the Atlantic led directly to the resurrection of Holmes when Collier\u2019s Weekly in America offered such an enormous sum of money for new stories of the great man that Conan Doyle brought him ingeniously back from his watery grave in The Adventure of the Empty House."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Hound-of-the-Baskervilles", "page_content": "The Hound of the Baskervilles, one of the best known of the Sherlock Holmes novels, written by Arthur Conan Doyle in 1901.

The popularity of The Hound of the Baskervilles helped pave the way for Holmes\u2019s appearance in later works.\n\nBased on a local legend of a spectral hound that haunted Dartmoor in Devonshire, England, the story is set in the moors at Baskerville Hall and the nearby Grimpen Mire, and the action takes place mostly at night, when the terrifying hound howls for blood. After Sir Charles Baskerville is found dead with his face twisted in stark terror, Holmes is called upon to protect his heir, Sir Henry Baskerville. Narrating the story is Holmes\u2019s assistant, Dr. Watson, who is sent to Dartmoor while the busy Holmes remains in London. Upon his arrival, Watson learns that an escaped convict is on the loose. More unsettling events occur, including the appearance of an unknown figure on the moor. Watson later discovers that the mysterious person is Holmes, who has been conducting his own investigation. Holmes deduces that the killer is Jack Stapleton, a neighbour who is actually Rodger Baskerville. Hoping to inherit the family estate, he has plotted to kill his relatives using a vicious hound that he has painted with phosphorous to appear sinister. The superstitious Charles suffered a heart attack after being frightened by the animal. Stapleton also hopes to kill Henry Baskerville but is thwarted by Holmes. Afterward Stapleton flees and is believed to have died, swallowed by Grimpen Mire.\n\nBritannica Quiz Famous Novels, First Lines Quiz\n\nIn The Hound of the Baskervilles Conan Doyle uncharacteristically emphasized the eerie setting and mysterious atmosphere rather than the hero\u2019s deductive ingenuity. One of the all-time classic mysteries, the novel was hugely popular as readers rejoiced at the return of Sherlock Holmes. (His death in \u201cThe Final Problem\u201d had enraged fans, causing thousands to cancel their subscriptions to The Strand.) Although Conan Doyle had previously claimed to have grown \u201cweary\u201d of Sherlock\u2019s name, he subsequently revived the character after negotiating a large payment from publishers. A series of short stories were published in 1903\u201304 and later collected in The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1905). The Hound of the Baskervilles was adapted for film numerous times, beginning with a silent German production in 1914."}, {"url": "https://www.ancient-origins.net/myths-legends-europe/legendary-origins-merlin-magician-002627", "page_content": "Most people today have heard of Merlin the Magician, as his name has been popularized over the centuries and his story has been dramatized in numerous novels, films, and television programs. The powerful wizard is depicted with many magical powers, including the power of shapeshifting, and is well-known in mythology as a tutor and mentor to the legendary King Arthur, ultimately guiding him towards becoming the king of Camelot. While these general tales are well-known, Merlin\u2019s initial appearances were only somewhat linked to Arthur. It took many decades of adaptations before Merlin became the wizard of Arthurian legend he is known as today.\n\nMerlin the wizard. (Andy/ CC BY ND 2.0 )\n\nMerlin and Ambrosius\n\nIt is common belief that Merlin was created as a figure for Arthurian legend . While Merlin the Wizard was a very prominent character in the stories of Camelot, that is not where he originated. Writer Geoffrey of Monmouth is credited with creating Merlin in his 1136 AD work, Historia Regum Britanniae \u2013 The History of Kings of Britain. While a large portion of Historia Regum Britanniae is a historical account of the former kings of Britain, Merlin was included as a fictional character (although it is likely that Geoffrey intended for readers to believe he was a figure extracted from long-lost ancient texts). Merlin was paradoxical, as he was both the son of the devil and the servant of God.\n\nMerlin was created as a combination of several historical and legendary figures. Geoffrey combined stories of North Brythonic prophet and madman, Myrddin Wyllt, and Romano-British war leader, Ambrosius Aurelianus , to create Merlin Ambrosius. Ambrosius was a figure in Nennius' Historia Brittonum .\n\nIn Historia Brittonum , British king Vortigern wished to erect a tower, but each time he tried, it would collapse before completion. He was told that to prevent this, he would have to first sprinkle the ground beneath the tower with the blood of a child who was born without a father. Ambrosius was thought to have been born without a father, so he was brought before Vortigern.\n\nAmbrosius explained to Vortigern that the tower could not be supported upon the foundation because two battling dragons lived beneath, representing the Saxons and the Britons. Ambrosius convinced Vortigern that the tower would only stand with Ambrosius as a leader, and Vortigern gave Ambrosius the tower, which was also the kingdom. Geoffrey retold this story with Merlin as the child born without a father, although he retained the character of Ambrosius.\n\nIllumination of a 15th century manuscript of Historia Regum Britanniae showing king of the Britons Vortigern and Ambros waching the fight between two dragons. ( Public Domain )\n\nIn Geoffrey\u2019s version of the story, he included a long section containing Merlin\u2019s prophecies, along with two other stories, which led to the inclusion of Merlin into Arthurian legend . These include the tale of Merlin creating Stonehenge as the burial location for Ambrosius, and the story of Uther Pendragon sneaking into Tintagel where he fathered Arthur with Igraine, his enemy\u2019s wife.\n\nThis was the extent of Geoffrey\u2019s tales of Merlin. Geoffrey does not include any stories of Merlin acting as a tutor to Arthur, which is how Merlin is most well-known today. Geoffery\u2019s character of Merlin quickly became popular, particularly in Wales, and from there the tales were adapted, eventually leading to Merlin\u2019s role as Arthur\u2019s tutor.\n\nA giant helps Merlin build Stonehenge.

( Public Domain )\n\nMerlin \u2013 The Poem\n\nMany years after Geoffrey\u2019s Historia Regum Britanniae , Robert de Boron composed a poem called Merlin. Boron\u2019s Merlin has the same origins as Geoffrey\u2019s creation, but Boron placed special emphasis on Merlin\u2019s shapeshifting powers, connection to the Holy Grail , and his jokester personality. Boron also introduced Blaise, Merlin\u2019s master.\n\nBoron\u2019s poem was eventually re-written in prose as Estoire de Merlin , which also places much focus upon Merlin\u2019s shapeshifting. Over the years, Merlin was interspersed through the tales of Arthurian legend. Some writings placed much focus upon Merlin as Arthur\u2019s mentor, while others did not mention Merlin at all. In some tales Merlin was viewed as an evil figure who did no good in his life, while in others he was viewed favorably as Arthur\u2019s teacher and mentor.\n\nMerlin reciting his poem in a 13th-century illustration for \u2018Merlin\u2019 by Robert de Boron ( Public Domain )\n\nMerlin\u2019s Love and Death\n\nEventually, from the various tales emerged Merlin\u2019s downfall, at the hands of Niviane (Vivien), the king of Northumberland\u2019s daughter. Arthur convinces Niviane to stay in his castle, under Merlin\u2019s encouragement. Merlin falls in love with Niviane. However, Niviane fears Merlin will use his magical powers to take advantage of her. She swears that she will never fall in love with him, unless he teaches her all of the magic he knows. Merlin agrees.\n\nMerlin and Niviane depart to return to Northumberland, when they are called back to assist King Arthur. As they are returning, they stop to stay in a stone chamber, where two lovers once died and were buried together. When Merlin falls asleep, Niviane places him under a spell, and traps him within the stone tomb, where he dies. Merlin had never realized that his desire for Niviane, and his willingness to teach her his magical ways eventually led to his untimely death.\n\nMerlin and Vivien . ( Archivist /Adobe Stock)\n\nMerlin the Wizard\u2019s Legacy\n\nIn 2019, fragments of a rare manuscript published in the 1500s were found in the University of Bristol's special collections library detailing \u201csubtle but significant differences from the traditional story\u201d of Merlin the magician. For example, the deaths of some characters in the stories are different from more traditional accounts and there are more detailed descriptions of key events such as battles.\n\nThese variations in the stories of Merlin are not too surprising because from Merlin\u2019s inception through the writings of Geoffrey, the wizard appeared in different forms through many subsequent tales, stories, and poems. Today, Merlin is most well-known for being the wizard who tutored and taught the young Arthur , before he grew to become the King of Camelot. It was under Merlin\u2019s counsel that Arthur became the king that he was.\n\nWhile this legend continues on today, it is interesting to see the many variations of Merlin, from an evil wizard , to a shapeshifter, to one who met his downfall from teaching his powers to the woman he loved. This formidable and versatile character caught the attention of many people centuries ago, and continues to play a prominent role in today\u2019s storytelling.\n\nTop Image: Representation of Merlin the magician.
