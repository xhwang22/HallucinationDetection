Swanson believed laboratories weren't the only source of new scientific discoveries. Swanson, a specialist in the relationship between natural and computer languages, thought electronic databases also held the key to medical knowledge.\n\nA trailblazing information scientist, Swanson died Nov. 18 at age 88.\n\nConcerned that excessive specialization could inhibit scientific creativity, Swanson pioneered the field of literature-based discovery, which uses existing research to create new knowledge. The three-term dean of the University\u2019s Graduate Library School and professor emeritus in the Humanities Division believed that unearthing unseen links between two distinct areas of study could yield new discoveries\u2014what he called \u201cundiscovered public knowledge.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, Swanson received the ASIST Award of Merit, the highest honor from the American Society for Information Science & Technology, for his work.\n\nArrowsmith: \u2018An intellectual adventure\u2019\n\nSwanson famously tested his theory of undiscovered public knowledge with a 1986 paper in which he made a provocative connection between dietary fish oil and Raynaud\u2019s disease, a circulatory disorder.\n\nIn a search of the Medline database, which houses millions of scientific journal abstracts, Swanson found a common thread in research on Raynaud's disease and dietary fish oil. His hunting turned up numerous articles that described high blood viscosity in patients with Raynaud\u2019s disease; in a separate search, he found a body of research that showed dietary fish oil could reduce blood viscosity.\n\nThe implication of bringing these two literatures together was powerful: could fish oil, Swanson wondered, be used to treat Raynaud\u2019s disease?\n\nA clinical trial three years later validated the use of fish oil for patients with Raynaud\u2019s disease. Swanson later hypothesized a connection between migraine headaches and magnesium deficiency that was also subsequently supported by clinical research.\n\nSpurred on by these findings, Swanson and Neil Smalheiser of the University of Illinois at Chicago developed Arrowsmith, a piece of software that assists investigators in identifying connections between two sets of Medline articles.\n\nArrowsmith (named after the 1925 Sinclair Lewis novel) was aimed at building a \u201csystematic, computational\u201d method to find possible links among articles, Smalheiser said. \u201cThe computer was not supposed to generate discoveries, but it was supposed to identify and put together these potential assertions.\u201d\n\nThe Arrowsmith model proved influential, and the approach Swanson and Smalheiser developed has been adapted to study the correlations of genes with diseases and find possible new uses for medications.\n\nDespite the impact of Swanson and Smalheiser's work on Arrowsmith, \u201cWe never saw it as anything other than an intellectual adventure,\u201d Smalheiser said.\n\n\u2018Experiments with information\u2019 not salamanders\n\n\u201cDon was doing science, without dissecting a salamander,\u201d said Mark Olsen, assistant director of the American and French Research on the Treasury of the French Language (ARTFL) project, a major digital humanities project that was influenced by Swanson\u2019s work. \u201cHe was doing experiments with information.\u201d\n\nSwanson began his career studying physics as an undergraduate at the California Institute of Technology. He received his MA in physics from Rice University in 1947 and his PhD, also in physics, from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1952.\n\nEven in their early days, computers were a source of fascination for Swanson. \u201cI think he was always dazzled by the idea of the computer,\u201d said his wife, Patricia Swanson.\n\nSwanson worked as a computer systems analyst at Hughes Research & Development and research scientist at Ramo-Wooldridge Corp. & TRW, Inc., before he joined the UChicago faculty in 1963 as dean of the Graduate Library School (which closed in 1990). Swanson's background as a physical scientist set him apart from the seven previous deans of the school, who represented a variety of other disciplines.\n\nAt the GLS, Swanson initially focused on computer-aided information retrieval, an entirely new area of study at the time.\n\n\u201cAt the time Don began working on it, people simply couldn\u2019t imagine that you could retrieve information with a computer,\u201d said his colleague Abe Bookstein, professor emeritus in the Humanities. \u201cIn a field that was very qualitative, Don was instrumental in introducing quantitative formal techniques.\u201d\n\nHe was also a rigorous and encouraging teacher, according to his former GLS student Charles Blair, who remembered Swanson for his \u201cvery clean, organized and methodical approach to his subject.\u201d\n\nSwanson happily lent his expertise to colleagues around the University. In the early days of the ARTFL project, Prof. Robert Morrissey came to Swanson for advice on how to handle organization of the massive new database. \u201cHe told me, \u2018What this project needs is a little sunshine and water,\u201d remembered Morrissey, the Benjamin Franklin Professor of French Literature and director of ARTFL. \u201cHe was very generous with his time.\u201d\n\nThat generosity was not unusual for Swanson, according to Smalheiser\u2014Swanson went \u201cout of his way to be nice and encouraging,\u201d Smalheiser said.\n\nSwanson\u2019s quiet manner belied a mischievous sense of humor that led him to write satiric articles, for example, \u201cNew Horizons in Psychoanalysis: Treatment of Necrosistic Personality Disorders,\u201d in Perspectives in Biology and Medicine (1986).\n\nNot only intellectually witty but also physically fit, Swanson was an avid runner who completed a half-marathon at the age of 80.\n\nBut his work was by far his greatest passion, according to Patricia Swanson. \u201cHe was always trying to do something better,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition to his wife, Swanson is survived by his son, Richard B. Swanson; and his daughter, Judith A. Swanson, PhD\u201987. Another son, Douglas A. Swanson, died in 2004.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations in Swanson\u2019s honor may be made to the University of Chicago Library, the Nature Conservancy or the Heritage Foundation."}, {"url": "https://blog.sciencenet.cn/blog-1557-8018.html", "page_content": "Abstract\n\nWith the rapid development of science and technology, specialties are split into subspecialties further and there are poor communications across specialties. Information developed in one area of research may be of value in another without anyone becoming aware of the fact, so there should be many implicit undiscovered connections of interest which can not be retrieved by conventional computer-aided literature search. Don R. Swanson, professor of information science at the University of Chicago, solved this problem.\n\nHe developed an information method called non-interactive literature-based discovery and designed Arrowsmith, which is an interactive software and search strategies.

I do this not to deny that there are people who eat badly according to normative criteria such as nutrition, aesthetics, or non-human animal welfare, but to show that common judgments about bad eaters are premised on stereotypes, questionable views of human agency, or misunderstandings of the moral relevance of eating. I will offer defenses of four types of bad eater: mindless eaters, unhealthy eaters, food allergy \u201cfakers,\u201d and, drawing from collaborative research with Laura Guidry-Grimes of the Cleveland Clinic, \u201csnack smugglers\u201d\u2014family members who bring prohibited food items to their hospitalized loved ones.

Given the questionable nature of many of these labels and their potential harms, I argue that we should be highly cautious in our judgments about bad eaters, even when judging ourselves.\n\n*Dr. Megan Dean is an assistant professor at Michigan State University and the North American Co-Ordinator for Culinary Mind\n\nSponsors:\n\nDepartment of Philosophy at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign The Graduate Philosophy Organization at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n\n"}, {"url": "http://abel.lis.illinois.edu/tutorial/scientist_1998.html", "page_content": "The Scientist 12[10]:12, May. 11, 1998\n\nProfession\n\nProgram Uncovers Hidden Connections In The Literature\n\nBy Robert Finn\n\nDate: May 11, 1998\n\nAuthor: Robert Finn\n\nIt seems like such an obvious idea once it's stated: With the explosive growth of scientific literature and the concomitant fragmentation of the scientific community into narrow specialties, there must be undisclosed connections lurking. Suppose one field of science has linked medical condition A with symptom B, and a completely different field has linked dietary deficiency C with that same symptom B. The literature then would contain an implicit logical link between A and C, but unless a researcher from one field stumbled upon the other field's literature, that link would never become explicit.\n\n\n\nPROGRAM DEVELOPER: Don R. Swanson, professor emeritus of information science at the University of Chicago, has developed a computer program that will allow systematic searching for links in scientific literature.\n\nSwanson prefers to call his approach text-based informatics. Other enthusiasts, such as Michael D. Gordon, professor of computer and information systems at the University of Michigan Business School in Ann Arbor, refer to it as literature-based discovery. \"I think that [Swanson] has made concrete and operational this idea that there are discoveries that can be made within the public literature,\" notes Gordon. \"He has performed very, very well-conceived and well-executed experiments. . . . And there has been follow-on work in the medical community that has been based on his reporting these connections.\"\n\n\"He's opening up a new way of doing information science, a new avenue for approaching information,\" adds Henry Small, director of contract research at the Philadelphia-based Institute for Scientific Information Inc. \"Whether or not this pans out, I think people are thinking in a new way about information. They're thinking of knowledge discovery rather than just information retrieval.\"\n\nOne of Swanson's first successes with text-based informatics came in 1986: \"Raynaud's disease is a circulatory disorder for which neither the cure nor the cause is known,\" he explains. \"I found literature that indicated that at least a subgroup of Raynaud's patients have certain abnormalities in their blood. Separately [I learned that] dietary fish oil tended to correct those abnormalities, such as high viscosity. And so putting those together suggested that dietary fish oil should be of benefit to Raynaud's patients. About two years later somebody did a clinical trial that did show a beneficial effect.\" (Swanson's original paper is: D.R. Swanson, Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, 30[1]:7-18, 1986; and the papers reporting the clinical trial that validated his suggestion are: B.B. Chang et al., Surgical Forum, 39:324-326, 1988; and R.A. DiGiacomo et al., American Journal of Medicine, 86[2]:158-164, 1989.)\n\nThen in 1988 Swanson used his method to establish a relationship between migraine headaches and magnesium deficiency (D. R. Swanson, Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, 31:526-557, 1988). Despite the fact that at the time there were virtually no records in the MEDLINE database mentioning both migraine and magnesium, Swanson found that there were 11 intermediate effects linking the neurological disorder with the dietary deficiency. To give just two examples, writes Swanson, \"magnesium can inhibit spreading depression in the cortex, and spreading depression may be implicated in migraine attacks; magnesium-deficient rats have been used as a model of epilepsy, and epilepsy has been associated with migraine.\" The relationship Swanson found between migraine and magnesium has been validated repeatedly in the clinic.\n\nMore recently Swanson has collaborated with Neil R. Smalheiser, now an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who says that he has encouraged Swanson to take a slightly different approach to text-based informatics. Previously Swanson had focused on cases in which no link between a particular A and a particular C had been suspected. Now the collaborators are focusing on cases in which researchers have already established at least a tenuous connection between A and C. \"They either know that A and C are linked experimentally, but may not know how they're linked,\" explains Smalheiser, \"or they want to see what is already known about possible relationships between A and C.\"\n\n\n\nCOLLABORATOR: Neil R. Smalheiser, assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Illinois at Chicago, has worked with Swanson in developing ARROWSMITH.\n\nOn the one hand ARROWSMITH uncovered, in Smalheiser's words, \"a whole cottage literature in schizophrenia arguing that patients shared markers of various kinds suggestive of chronic oxidative stress.\" On the other hand, the program turned up information about an animal model of chronic oxidative stress that's produced by depriving rats of Vitamin E and selenium for a period of six weeks. These rats show selective increases in calcium-independent phospholipase A2.\n\n\"We saw this A-to-B-to-C link and proposed not only that this could explain what they saw in people, but that this chronic oxidative stress model could be [useful] for studying this phenomenon,\" notes Smalheiser.\n\nSwanson describes ARROWSMITH (which is available for use at no cost at http://kiwi.uchicago.edu) as, \"interactive software that extends the capability of a MEDLINE search. It operates on the output of a conventional search in a way that lets the user see new relationships and form novel hypotheses. . . . The user puts in a broader field as a conjecture--'I'd like to look at all dietary substances and see any connections to migraine.' And that's organized into a ranked list on which magnesium appears at or near the top. Therefore the hypothesis is suggested to the user, rather than asking the user to come up with the hypothesis.\"\n\nDespite the promise of Swanson's approach, information scientists and researchers have detailed a number of shortcomings and criticisms both with the ARROWSMITH program and, more broadly, with literature-based discovery itself. ISI's Small, for example, expresses a general sense of doubtfulness: \"I have to say I'm skeptical, but it's not so farfetched that it's not worth some serious attention. I think everyone has some skepticism that you can find something new from what's already out there.\"\n\nOf Swanson, Small remarks, \"He's not doing anything in the laboratory. He's not collecting any new experimental results. And that seems to be the primary way discoveries occur, through the experimental method, testing hypotheses and so forth. So to think, say in the case of a disease, that the answer to a particular disease . . . is actually sitting out there somewhere hidden, is a little bit of a stretch. . . . What if the migraine headache was caused by something we haven't even looked at yet? In that case, no matter how hard the machine flails away at this, it's not going to find an answer.\"\n\nOn the other hand, allows Small, \"In the cases where the explanation and the problem are already out there and just have to be put together, his method is a very, very reasonable one to try.\"\n\nA more specific shortcoming of ARROWSMITH is that the current version of the software operates only on an article's title, not on the full text, the abstract, or even its medical subject headings (although Swanson has a version in development that does examine subject headings). Swanson defends this approach by noting that most titles in the biomedical literature are highly descriptive, and by pointing out that having the program examine additional fields would greatly increase processing time.\n\n\n\nNOT JUST SCIENCE: Kenneth A. Cory used a Swanson approach to find a link between the poetry of Robert Frost and ancient Greek philosopher Carneades.\n\nAnother problem with ARROWSMITH is that it requires a significant investment in time and effort from its users, who must first conduct two detailed MEDLINE searches and download the results in a specific text format. \"I think the most basic [limitation] is that this is really meant for the person who already knows how to do database searching,\" Swanson acknowledges. \"It doesn't replace conventional searching, and the more the user knows about database searching, the better the user can exploit ARROWSMITH.\"\n\nThen users must upload the results to the ARROWSMITH site for processing. \"When the Internet slows down, the responsiveness of the system slows down,\" notes Swanson.\n\nSmalheiser agrees that this can be a problem. \"The trouble with the web site is that when you're downloading very large files of the sort that a literature would consist of--schizophrenia has thousands and thousands of titles--it takes a long time to do that over the Internet.\" And then, once ARROWSMITH produces its output--a process that takes from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on the size of the input files--a researcher who is highly knowledgeable in the subjects under investigation must take the time to interpret the results.\n\n\"Even though the computer is doing a lot, the user has to invest the time to study the output and use the output as a guide to the literature,\" Swanson notes. \"It's not a magical solution in which the computer comes up with new ideas and new hypotheses. The role of the computer is to display information that stimulates the user to see new connections. So it depends on the sophistication and the abilities of the user.\"\n\nDespite the technique's promise, literature-based discovery seems to have generated more interest within the information science community than among life scientists. Swanson points out that very few individuals have made use of ARROWSMITH despite its free availability to anyone in the world with an Internet connection. Smalheiser observes that the papers he's co-authored with Swanson reporting the associations they discovered--including associations between indomethacin and Alzheimer's disease and estrogen and Alzheimer's disease--have been cited only for the results they produced. The innovative method itself has apparently not caught many eyes.\n\n\"I find it almost unbelievable that this isn't something that has captured everyone's attention,\" complains Gordon, who co-authored a paper (M.D. Gordon, R.K. Lindsay, Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 47:116-128, 1996) replicating and extending Swanson's original results on migraine. \"It's both extremely exciting intellectually and extremely important in terms of the kind of results it potentially can produce. I don't understand why it hasn't been seized upon.\"\n\nSmalheiser suggests one reason: \"There is a certain amount of work that is involved, because when you're linking two literatures there's a significant number of terms--a B list--that you have to wade through. So you have to know what you're looking for and why to make sense of this, to quickly go through separating the wheat from the chaff.\"\n\nThis is much more difficult, he notes, than using one of the publicly available sequence databases to perform a simple DNA homology search. \"When you do a DNA homology search, they will give you a list of the 100 most homologous genes. . . . Whereas if we generate a B list, the raw B list might be 600 terms. And then we manually edit it down to 150 terms. Then we scan through the titles quickly, knowing what kind of things we're looking for, but it still could be a stack of 20 pages.\"\n\n\"It takes an expert to evaluate the different hypotheses,\" ISI's Small observes. \"And how many medical experts are going to have the patience to do this kind of thing? I think this might be the crux of the issue, because a clinical practitioner is not going to go to MEDLINE and try to churn away at something like this.\"\n\nAnd then there may be a psychological barrier preventing researchers from allowing a computer to generate hypotheses. But researchers need have no fear that they'll be supplanted by machines, says Gordon. After all, accountants weren't rendered obsolete by computerized spreadsheet programs.\n\nThe most detailed expression of Swanson's ideas on text-based informatics can be found in the paper: D.R. Swanson, N.R. Smalheiser. \"An interactive system for finding complementary literatures: a stimulus to scientific discovery.\" Artificial Intelligence , 91:183-203, 1997. The full text of this article, as well as the gateway to the ARROWSMITH program, are on Swanson's web site: http://kiwi.uchicago.edu/\n\nThe bottom line, concludes Gordon, is that Swanson's work has provided a valuable set of tools. \"Put them in the hands of someone who really understands medicine. They ought to be able to comb through a good body of literature in a much more systematic way than they could have otherwise. They can have brought to their attention concepts and articles that otherwise, because of their specialization, they very likely never would have considered. They could be much more efficient with this tool working for them, and ultimately they could probably be more effective, more creative.\"\n\nRobert Finn, a freelance science writer based in Long Beach, Calif., can be reached online at finn@nasw.org."}, {"url": "https://illinois.edu/about/index.html", "page_content": "Since its founding in 1867, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has earned a reputation as a world-class leader in research, teaching, and public engagement.\n\nFaculty A talented and highly respected faculty is the university\u2019s most significant resource. Many are recognized for exceptional scholarship with memberships in such organizations as the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences, and the National Academy of Engineering. Our faculty have been awarded Nobel Prizes, Pulitzer Prizes, and the Fields Medal in Mathematics. The success of our faculty is matched by that of our alumni: 11 are Nobel Laureates and another 18 have won Pulitzer Prizes.\n\nAcademic Resources Academic resources on campus are among the finest in the world. The University Library is one of the largest public university collections in the world with 14 million volumes in its 20+ unit libraries. Annually, 53,000,000 people visit its online catalog. Students have access to thousands of computer terminals in classrooms, residence halls, and campus libraries for use in classroom instruction, study, and research.\n\nResearch At Illinois, our focus on research shapes our identity, permeates our classrooms and fuels our outreach. Fostering discovery and innovation is our fundamental mission. As a public, land-grant university, we have the responsibility to create new knowledge and new ideas and translate these into better ways of working, living and learning for our state, nation and world. Entrepreneurship flows from the classrooms to Research Park, a space that houses everything from Fortune 500 companies to student-founded startups. We are consistently ranked among the top five universities for NSF-funded research and our total annual research funding exceeds $600 million.\n\nThe Arts A major center for the arts, the campus attracts dozens of nationally and internationally renowned artists each year to its widely acclaimed Krannert Center for the Performing Arts. The University also supports two major museums: the Krannert Art Museum and Kinkead Pavilion; and the Spurlock Museum, a museum of world history and culture. Other major facilities include the multipurpose State Farm Center (16,500 seats); Memorial Stadium (70,000 seats), site of Big Ten Conference football games; and the Activities and Recreation Center (ARC), one of the largest recreational facilities of its kind on a university campus."}, {"url": "https://history.aip.org/phn/21607005.html", "page_content": "Tip: Search within this page by using Ctrl + F or \u2318 + F\n\nOver 1000 biographies of physicists and histories of institutions with information pertaining to their lives, careers, and research.\n\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

The university, then called the Illinois Industrial University, opened for classes on March 2, 1868, as a result of the 1862 Morrill Act. The name was officially changed to the University of Illinois in 1885, to reflect the broader scope of class offerings. The name of the Urbana location within the larger University of Illinois system was changed again in 1982, to The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The university department of physics is ranked among the top ten programs in the nation, and is the site of the Department of Energy's Center for the Simulation of Advanced Rockets, programs in materials science and condensed matter physics research, the Frederick Seitz Materials Research Laboratory, the Micro and Nanotechnology Laboratory, and a national historic landmark astronomical observatory.\n\n1929-57, Wheeler Loomis.\n\n1957-64, Frederick Seitz.\n\n1964-70, Gerald Almy.\n\n1970-86, Ralph Simmons.\n\n1986-92, Ansel Anderson.\n\n1992-2000, David Campbell.\n\n2000-06, Jeremiah Sullivan.\n\n2006-2018, Dale Van Harlingen.\n\n2018-present, Matthias Grosse Perdekamp.\n\n1870Stillman Robinson introduces the first course in physics, Champaign (Ill.).\n\n1875Laboratory practice is included in the physics curriculum.\n\n1889The Department of Physics is created as part of the College of Engineering.\n\n1901The Department of Physics establishes a graduate degree program.\n\n1909The Physics Laboratory is completed and the Department moves into their new home.\n\n1910First two Physics PhDs are awarded.\n\n1922E.
