L'Assomption is located about 50 km northeast of Montr\u00e9al, in a loop of the meandering L'Assomption River, just below the confluence with the Achigan River.\n\nL'Assomption takes its name from the Seigneurie de l\u2019Assomption granted to Pierre Legardeur de Repentigny in 1647 and from the river itself, which has carried that name since the early 17th century. Originally, the site of L'Assomption was known as \"Le Portage\" because it straddled a portage path used as a shortcut across the quasi-peninsula made by the winding course of the river.\n\nBefore Joliette came into its own in 1863, L'Assomption was the main town on the road linking Trois-Rivi\u00e8res to Montr\u00e9al. Its fame was closely linked to Coll\u00e8ge de l'Assomption, founded in 1832. The driving force behind this educational project was Jean-Baptiste Meilleur, the first superintendent of education for Lower Canada (1842\u201355). Canada's seventh prime minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, was one of the college's most famous students.\n\nOasis du Vieux Palais de Justice, the oldest circuit courthouse in the province of Qu\u00e9bec, is its foremost historic building."}, {"url": "https://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/isidore-mathieu-24-1f13khy", "page_content": "This database contains family trees submitted to Ancestry by users who have indicated that their tree can be viewed by all Ancestry subscribers.These trees can change over time as users edit, remove, or otherwise modify the data in their trees.

Well, what someday would be known as Canada. This man spoke and understood at least five different languages!\n\nHe was also the first recorded Black person, or person of African heritage, to visit and live on this land.\n\nLet's find out a little more about the life of Mathieu Da Costa.\n\nWhere was he from?\n\nDrawing of Benin City, the capital of Benin Empire, made by an English officer in 1897. (Wikimedia/Public domain)\n\nDetails about Mathieu's early life are hard to find.\n\nSome historians believe his family was from the African kingdom of Benin. That's the southern part of Nigeria. But Mathieu may have been born in the Azore Islands, which are near Portugal and Morocco.\n\nWhat did he do?\n\nMathieu's language skills were valuable and in demand. He worked with well-known French explorers like Samuel de Champlain and Pierre Dugua de Mons. Which meant he was part of many trade and exploration expeditions (or journeys).\n\nAs an interpreter, he would translate languages for explorers and First Nations people in New France (Quebec).\n\n(Vincent masson - Qu\u00e9bec, Wikimedia/Public Domain)\n\nWhat languages did he speak?\n\nSome accounts say that Mathieu was a well-educated man. He was able to speak French, Dutch, Portuguese and Mi' kmaq, a First Nations language.\n\nHe also spoke a language used by fishermen on the Atlantic coast. It was a mix of a French-Spanish dialect.\n\nWho would he become?\n\n\u00a9 Canada Post 2017. Reprinted with permission\n\nThere have been several efforts made to secure Mathieu Da Costa's place in history. We want to remember him as an accomplished and skilled interpreter. And as the first man of African heritage to step foot and live in Canada.\n\nIf you travel to Port-Royal National Historical Site in Nova Scotia, you will find a plaque that honours his life and time spent there. Apparently he actually lived in Port-Royal, which was one of the first European settlements.\n\nStreets in Montreal, Quebec City and Halifax have been named after him. And a francophone primary school in Toronto. But best of all, Canada Post created a stamp with his picture.\n\nMathieu Da Costa, the African interpreter who first arrived in Canada in the early 1600s is now regarded as a national hero."}]}
