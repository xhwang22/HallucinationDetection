Abdul Kalam won many awards, both from the Indian government and from the international community. His most notable awards were the Padma Vibhushan, won in 1990, and the Bharat Ratna, won in 1997, for his contributions to science and engineering and service to the government.\n\nA.P.J. Abdul Kalam created the Technology Vision 2020 project in 1998. The project sought to develop India\u2019s economy through technology, particularly as applied to agriculture, and increase the availability of health care and education. In recognition of Kalam\u2019s services to the country and broad popularity, the National Democratic Alliance nominated him for president in 2002.\n\nA.P.J. Abdul Kalam attended the Madras Institute of Technology, where he received a degree in aeronautical engineering in 1960. After graduation he joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)\u2014an Indian military research institute\u2014and later the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Kalam\u2019s associations were not limited to research organizations: he was also associated with political groups, such as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).\n\nA.P.J. Abdul Kalam served as president of the Republic of India from 2002 to 2007. As president, Kalam promoted the advancement of the national nuclear weapons program. Kalam also devised a 20-year action plan to achieve economic growth through technological development in India.\n\nA.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India\u2014died July 27, 2015, Shillong), Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in the development of India\u2019s missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was president of India from 2002 to 2007.\n\nKalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname \u201cMissile Man.\u201d Among those successes was Agni, India\u2019s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.\n\nBritannica Quiz Explore India Quiz\n\nFrom 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal scientific adviser (1999\u20132001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. His prominent role in the country\u2019s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community. In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and education.\n\nIn 2002 India\u2019s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put forward Kalam to succeed outgoing President Kocheril Raman Narayanan. Kalam was nominated by the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) NDA even though he was Muslim, and his stature and popular appeal were such that even the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, also proposed his candidacy. Kalam easily won the election and was sworn in as India\u2019s 11th president, a largely ceremonial post, in July 2002. He left office at the end of his term in 2007 and was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the country\u2019s first woman president.\n\nUpon returning to civilian life, Kalam remained committed to using science and technology to transform India into a developed country and served as a lecturer at several universities. On July 27, 2015, he collapsed while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong and was pronounced dead from cardiac arrest soon afterward.\n\nKalam wrote several books, including an autobiography, Wings of Fire (1999). Among his numerous awards were two of the country\u2019s highest honours, the Padma Vibhushan (1990) and the Bharat Ratna (1997)."}, {"url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/a-p-j-abdul-kalam/m0gy3f", "page_content": "Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007.

Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born on 15th Oct 1931 and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and this day is also observed as \u201cWorld Students Day\u201d. He studied physics and aerospace engineering and spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India\u2019s civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.

From 1992 to 1997, Kalam was the defence minister\u2019s scientific adviser, and from 1999 to 2001, he was the government\u2019s principal scientific adviser with the title of cabinet minister. Although the tests raised worldwide alarm, Kalam\u2019s important role in the country\u2019s 1998 nuclear weapons testing cemented India\u2019s status as a nuclear power and elevated him as a national hero. In 1998, Kalam proposed Technology Vision 2020, a statewide strategy that he described as a road map for converting India from a developing to a developed society in 20 years. Increasing agricultural productivity, prioritising technology as an engine for economic growth, and expanding access to health care and education were among the goals outlined in the plan. Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the \u201cPeople\u2019s President\u201d, he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India\u2019s highest civilian honour. After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India\u2019s first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.[1] In 1969, Kalam received the government\u2019s approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers. In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA\u2019s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility. Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful. Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country\u2019s first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme. Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace projects. His research and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship. Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another. R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating funds for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the Chief Executive. Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile. Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period in which he played an intensive political and technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project Coordinator, along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing phase. Media coverage of Kalam during this period made him the country\u2019s best known nuclear scientist. Kalam preferred to became a scientist because he wanted to develop the level of aeronautical science and its development in India. His projects & inventions include:-\n\nNandhi Hovercraft: It was his first invention for his college project. His first invention took to the power and drove great power to the administration. This was his foremost creation or innovation, a dual engine driven hovercraft dubbed Nandhi for his university assignment. It was constructed after plenty of effort, so it flew beyond 1 foot from the surface having two people inside.\n\nPokhran nuclear test: This one was the unforgettable moment for India when the country finally emerged as a nuclear power. Dr. Kalam was then serving as a chief Scientific adviser to the then prime Minister, and he was the brain behind the multiple nuclear testing in Pokhran which left the whole world shocked. As the CEO of the DRDO from July 1992 to July 1999, he directed the Pokhran II explosions. India is now on the list of nuclear-armed states as a result of his efforts and dedication. It consists of five detonations, the first was fusion bomb and the rest were fission bombs. The speciality of Pokhran 2 was that it was tested in ultimate secrecy. The test was a success as the spy satellites and CIA satellites could be avoided.\n\nKalam Raju Stent: In 1998, APJ Abdul collaborated alongside Dr Soma Raju to create a reduced cardiovascular stents known as the \u201cKalam-Raju Stent,\u201d that resulted in a half drop in the price of international implantable devices in India.\n\nKalam Raju Tablet: Following the development of the Kalam Raju Stent, he together with cardiology Soma Raju created Kalam Raju Tablet that intended to equip general practice wellness and well-being professionals to react to urgent care emergencies. Thus, this became one of the leading invention that Kalam undertook in healthcare sector.\n\nIndia\u2019s first indigenous Satellite launch vehicle: At the time, India barely talked about launching satellite and developing in the field of Space and technology, a man came and changed the future of space organization. APJ Abdul Kalam was appointed as the project director in ISRO and his leadership made it feasible for the country to construct own SLV from ground zero. In July 1980, the SLV III injected the Rohini satellite into near-Earth orbit, making The country an exclusive Space Club member.\n\nDevelopment of Ballistic missiles: Another milestone was created when Dr. Kalam headed the directorial position of Devila and Valiant. It aimed to produce ballistic missiles based on the successful SLV program\u2019s technology. It was only then when missiles like AGNI-(intermediate range ballistic missile) and PRITHVI (surface to surface missile) along with many powerful missiles were created and that\u2019s why Dr. Kalam earned the title of the missile man of India.\n\nLight combat Aircraft project: Dr. Kalam became the first Indian in a leadership position to fly a fighter plane. After specializing in Aeronautical engineering from Madras institute of technology, he engrossed himself deeply with India\u2019s light combat Aircraft project.\n\nInterest in the development of low-weight calipers: Although India has indeed been proclaimed polio free by the World Health Organization, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam and his colleagues put a lot of effort in 1995 and 1996 to create orthosis callipers which carried about one-tenth of the mass of others on the marketplace. Such flooring response callipers improved motion and standing easier for individuals suffering from neurological difficulties, allowing children to stroll relatively easily and flexibly with hardly any assistance.\n\nProject Devil and Project Valiant: In the 1970s, APJ Abdul Kalam also oversaw two proposals, that aimed to construct ballistic missiles depends on the positive SLV system\u2019s capabilities. Notwithstanding the Union government\u2019s objections, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi used the discretionary authority following Kalam\u2019s direction to allocate covert cash for such aeronautical programs. Kalam was instrumental in persuading the Union Cabinet to keep the real character of such sensitive aviation initiatives hidden.\n\nAPJ Abdul Kalam inventions proved useful to us, the mankind in varied ways which cannot even be expressed in words. Awarding him with the greatest honour of the country like Padma Bhushan, Padma Vibhushan, Bharat Ratna and many more, he made not only a difference to what India looked like but too to the outlook of India in the eyes of other significant countries. His words have made the student community grow and bloom with an ideology to do something worth for the nation and hence, have made everything turn for the good. A jewel in the crown, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam contributed significantly for India\u2019s growth and development. From scientific contributions to presidential contributions, he had achieved much for India. Under his leadership, India\u2019s initial national space launch mechanism was developed. On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on \u201cCreating a Livable Planet Earth\u201d at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest. At around 6:35 p.m, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life. Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: \u201cFunny guy! Are you doing well? Described by US president Barack Obama as a \u201cscientist and a statesman\u201d in his eulogy, Kalam was a physicist and an aeronautical engineer before he turned to politics, first acting as a science administrator and adviser for nearly four decades before his office run. In addition to National Awards, he received various international recognitions too Viz: The Royal Society, UK has awarded Dr Kalam with the King Charles-II Medal for Science and Technology in October 2007. He received the Woodrow Wilson Award in 2008. The Royal Academy of Engineering, London conferred on him the International Medal 2008 in June 2009 at London. The Hoover Board of Awards presented him the Hoover Medal 2008 at New York in April 2009. The Aerospace Historical Society in Collaboration with the Graduate Aerospace Laboratories (GALCIT) at the California Institute of Technology awarded him the 2009 International Von Karman Wings Award in September 2009. \u201cFailure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t take rest after your first victory because if you fail in second, more lips are waiting to say that your first victory was just luck.\u201d \u201cIf you fail, never give up because FAIL means \u201cFirst Attempt In Learning\u201d. -APJ Abdul Kalam\n\n(The authors is regularly contributing for the opinion pages of \u201cKashmir Horizon\u201d.

He was closely associated with the military missile development efforts and civilian space programme of India. For his work on launch vehicle technology and development of ballistic missile, he was given the pseudonym of \u2018The Missile Man of India.\u2019 In 1998, he played a prominent role in Pokhran-II Nuclear Tests.\n\nIn 2002, he was elected the 11th President of the country and became widely known as the \u2018People\u2019s President.\u2019 After serving his presidential term he pursued what he loved most \u2013 teaching, writing and reading. For his achievements and contributions as a scientist, he was honoured with the \u2018Bharat Ratan Award,\u2019 India\u2019s highest civilian honour.\n\nHe left for the heavenly abode on July 27, 2015, while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Shillong. He was laid to rest with full state-honours and his funeral was attended by thousands of people including national-level dignitaries.\n\nEarly Life\n\nAPJ Abdul Kalam was born into a poor Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage town of Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, on October 15, 1931. His mother, Ashiamma, was a housewife and his father, Jainulabdeen, was an imam of a local mosque and a boat owner. He was the youngest in the family with four elder brothers and a sister.\n\nThough, the family was not financially affluent yet all the children were raised in an atmosphere that was full of love and compassion. In order to add to the family\u2019s income, Kalam had to sell newspapers during his early years.\n\nHe was an average student during his school, but possessed a strong desire to learn and was very hard working. He loved mathematics and spent hours studying the subject. He pursued his education from \u2018Schwartz Higher Secondary School,\u2019 and then graduated from \u2018Saint Joseph\u2019s College, Tiruchirappalli,\u2019 in 1954. He wanted to become a fighter pilot but his dream could not be fulfilled as here were only eight positions available in the IAF and he secured the ninth place.\n\nCareer\n\nAs A Scientist\n\nIn 1960, he graduated from the \u2018Madras Institute of Technology,\u2019 and joined as a scientist at the \u2018Aeronautical Development Establishment,\u2019 after becoming a member of the \u2018Defence Research and Development Service.\u2019 Kalam also worked under the eminent space scientist Vikram Sarabhai while he was a part of \u2018INCOSPAR\u2019 committee. Kalam was transferred to the \u2018Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)\u2019 in 1969. He became the project head of the country\u2019s foremost Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III). In July 1980, SLV-III deployed the \u2018Rohini\u2019 satellite successfully near-earth orbit under Kalam\u2019s leadership.\n\nKalam was a part of a number of projects, including \u2018Project Devil,\u2019 in 1970. Though the project was not successful, yet it laid the foundation for the development of the \u2018Prithvi Missile,\u2019 in 1980. He was also associated with \u2018Project Valiant.\u2019\n\nIn 1983, Kalam returned to DRDO as its chief as he was asked to lead the \u2018Integrated Guided Missile Development Program\u2019 (IGMDP).\n\nIn May 1998, he played a key role in carrying out \u2018Porkhran-II\u2019 nuclear tests by India. The success of these nuclear tests made Kalam a national hero and his popularity went skyrocketing.\n\nAs a technical visionary, he made several recommendations in the fields of technological innovations, agriculture, and nuclear energy to make India a developed nation by 2020.\n\nAs President\n\nIn 2002, Kalam was chosen the Presidential nominee by the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and he was elected the President. He became the 11th President of India on July 25, 2002 and served the position till July 25, 2007.\n\nHe also became the third President of India to have received \u2018Bharat Ratna\u2019 before assuming the office of the President.\n\nDue to his style of working and interaction with common people, especially the youth, he was affectionately called \u2018The People\u2019s President.\u2019 According to Dr. Kalam, the most arduous decision he had taken during his tenure was that of signing the \u2018Office of Profit Bill.\u2019\n\nDuring his tenure as President, he faced criticism for his inaction in deciding the fate of mercy petitions that were submitted to him.

In 2003 and 2006, he was nominated for the \u2018MTV Youth Icon of the Year.\u2019\n\nDeath\n\nKalam went to IIM Shillong to deliver a lecture on \u2018Creating a Livable Planet Earth,\u2019 on July 27, 2015. While climbing a flight of stairs, he expressed some discomfort, but made his way to the auditorium. Only five minutes into the lecture, around 6:35pm IST, he collapsed in the lecture hall. He was taken to \u2018Bethany Hospital\u2019 in a critical condition. He was kept in the intensive care unit but lacked signs of life. At 7:45pm IST, he was declared dead due to cardiac arrest.\n\nKalam\u2019s body was airlifted in an Indian Air Force helicopter and was flown to New Delhi on July 28. Numerous dignitaries and masses paid homage to him at his residence at 10 Rajaji Marg. Kalam\u2019s body, wrapped in the national flag, was then flown to the town of Mandapam, from where an army truck took it to his home town of Rameswaram. His body was displayed at Rameswaram in front of a bus station to allow people to pay their last respect to the departed soul. On July 30, 2015, the former President was laid to rest with full state honours at Rameswaram\u2019s Pei Karumbu Ground. Kalam\u2019s last rites were attended by more than 350,000 people.\n\nDr. APJ Abdul Kalam and the Youth\n\nDestiny was seen being benevolent when death beseeched Kalam while he was doing what he wanted to do throughout his life \u2013 sharing knowledge. Kalam took the final gasp doing what he loved most, and amongst those whom he loved the most \u2013 the youth. His life became a paradigm for the youth of the country. He became a role model and inspiration for the younger generation due to his humble nature, simple and easy going personality, and his ability to connect with young minds.\n\nHis Writings\n\nDr Kalam authored and co-authored a number of instructional and inspirational books, including \u2018India 2020: A Vision for the New Millennium,\u2019 \u2018Wings of Fire,\u2019 \u2018The Luminous Sparks: A Biography in Verse and Colours,\u2019 \u2018Mission of India: A Vision of Indian Youth,\u2019 \u2018You Are Born To Blossom,\u2019 \u2018Ignited Minds: Unleashing the Power within India,\u2019 \u2018Guiding Souls,\u2019 \u2018Inspiring Thoughts,\u2019 \u2018Turning Points: A Journey Through Challenges,\u2019 \u2018Transcendence My Spiritual Experiences,\u2019 \u2018Beyond 2020: A Vision for Tomorrow\u2019s India,\u2019 and various others.\n\nInteresting Facts About Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam"}, {"url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/not-just-missile-man-here-are-five-scientific-contributions-of-apj-con-his-89th-birth-anniversary/articleshow/78672865.cms", "page_content": "1.

Developed the rugged 'Kalam-Raju tablet'\n\nNEW DELHI: From being the people's President to spearheading the development of the most significant Indian missiles, late President Dr APJ Abdul Kalam has contributed to the development of the country in different spheres.As an aerospace scientist, Kalam worked with India's two major space research organisations - Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).While, his work in the development and operationalisation of Indigenous guided missiles - AGNI and PRITHVI - earned him the title of the 'Missile Man of India,' there are many more ways in which Kalam has helped India in the division of science and technology.On the 89th birth anniversary of Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, here are 5 of his scientific contributions to the country: -Back in 1980s, when India had hardly dreamt of having its indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV), Dr Kalam's over 10-year-long hard work as the project director for the development of the indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle at ISRO led to the ground-breaking scientific development.It was in July 1980, that India's SLV-III successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in the near-Earth orbit leading to the country becoming a member of the exclusive Space Club.Kalam also headed the projects Devil and Valiant which had the aim of developing ballistic missiles using the technology behind the successful SLV program. Under mission Kalam with other projects, members developed many missiles including AGNI which is an intermediate-range ballistic missile and PRITHVI which is a surface-to-surface missile.Serving as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the then Prime Minister, Kalam played a major role in heading the Pokhran-II nuclear testing leading to him being known as the best nuclear scientist of the country at that time. The nuclear testing under the supervision of Kalam during the period of July 1992 to December 1999 made India a nuclear-armed state.Working jointly with cardiologist Soma Raju, the late President developed a cost-effective coronary stent 'Kalam-Raju Stent' which helped in making healthcare accessible to all.The duo of Kalam and Soma Raju later in 2012 designed a rugged tablet computer for better health care administration in the rural pockets of the country. They termed it the 'Kalam-Raju tablet.'For his work in the stream of science and politics, the 11th President was also awarded India's highest civilian honour or the Bharat Ratna.Kalam breathed his last on July 27, 2015, while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong when he collapsed and died from a cardiac arrest.Five years after his demise, his contributions are still remembered as some of the best scientific and technological developments in the country."}, {"url": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ajp-abdul-kalam-from-missile-man-to-people-s-president/story-buvNtBT8do4ZHlLzFso4IP.html", "page_content": "APJ Abdul Kalam was considered the father of the country\u2019s missile programme and served as the president for five years from 2002. Former President AJP Abdul Kalam was closely involved in India\u2019s civilian space programme and military missile development efforts(PTI Photo)\n\nKalam was closely involved in India\u2019s civilian space programme and military missile development efforts, earning him the sobriquet \u2018Missile Man\u2019.\n\nHe worked as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) before he became the president.\n\nHere\u2019s more about the life and times of APJ Abdul Kalam:\n\nAvul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on October 15, 1931, in a poor Tamil Muslim family in Rameswaram.\n\nAfter graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, he joined DRDO as a scientist. He started his career by designing a small helicopter for the Indian Army.\n\nIn 1969, Kalam was transferred to ISRO, where he was project director of India\u2019s first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in orbit.\n\nKalam also directed projects which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme in the 1970s.\n\nHe later became chief executive of the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme which developed missiles like Agni and Prithvi.\n\nKalam served as the chief scientific adviser to the Prime Minister and the secretary of the DRDO from July 1992 to December 1999.\n\nHe played a pivotal technical and political role in India\u2019s Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, shortly after the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government came to power.\n\nAPJ Abdul Kalam also explored how defence or aerospace technology could be applied to save lives.\n\nThe Kalam-Raju stent (named after the former president and cardiologist Dr B Soma Raju), which came out in 1994, was made from surgical-grade stainless steel provided by MIDHANI (Mishra Dhatu Nigam, a public sector undertaking) in Hyderabad. It paved the way for the production of new-generation stents in India.\n\nIntroduced in 1998, light-weight callipers for the polio-affected was a brainchild of Kalam, when he was the director of Defence Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL) in Hyderabad, and BN Prasad, then head of orthopaedics at the Nizam\u2019s Institute of Medical Sciences.\n\nThe callipers were made of glass-filled polypropylene, used in missiles \u2014 reducing their weight from four kilograms to 400 grams, providing relief to users.\n\nKalam succeeded KR Narayanan and served a full five-year term from 2002 until 2007 after he won the presidential elections. He secured the backing of all political parties.\n\nHe returned to a life of education, writing, and public service after his term. He received several prestigious awards, including India\u2019s highest civilian honour the Bharat Ratna in 1997, Padma Bhushan in 1981 and the Padma Vibhushan in 1990.\n\nAPJ Abdul Kalam, a vegetarian bachelor, was quoted as saying that like most of the technology he spearheaded, he himself was \u201cMade in India\u201d, having never been trained abroad.\n\nHe learnt to play the veena and also wrote poetry in Tamil besides writing several books, including Wings of Fire: An Autobiography and Ignited Minds: Unleashing the Power within India.\n\nAJP Abdul Kalam\u2019s birthday is marked as the World Students\u2019 Day.\n\nA role model for students and young people Kalam was always happy to be among them and educational institutions.

Contribution of APJ Abdul Kalam to the field of technology is being reaped by thousands of scientists and engineers, and millions of Indians even to this day.\n\nFondly known as the \u2018Missile Man\u2019 for the initiatives he took while he was associated with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) technologies developed by him are being used by the organizations even in present times.\n\n\u201cExcellence is a continuous process and not an accident,\u201d believed the former President of India, and that is exactly what he did in DRDO and ISRO in order to make India a superpower in space science and technology.\n\nContribution of APJ Abdul Kalam to DRDO\n\nDr Kalam started his career at DRDO after graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology.He joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment (ADE) of the Defence Research and Development Organisation as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research and Development Service (DRDS).\n\nKalam apparently started his career by designing a small hovercraft at DRDO. In 1965, Kalam independently started work on an expandable rocket project at the institution, and in 1969 he received the government\u2019s approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.\n\nDuring his tenure at DRDO, Kalam directed two projects namely Project Devil and Project Valiant, which aimed at developing ballistic missiles from the technology of SLV programme.

INCOSPAR, the team of rocket engineers of which Kalam was a part, set up the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) that is used by ISRO to launch sounding rockets even today.\n\nKalam was also the project director of India\u2019s first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit. Kalam has also played a contributory role in the development of Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV).\n\nKalam has also won the prestigious Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan for his contributions to ISRO and DRDO, as well as for his role as a scientific advisor to the Government of India.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"}, {"url": "https://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/from-the-archives-a-p-j-abdul-kalam-into-space-and-down-to-earth-1890936-2021-12-22", "page_content": "Fifteen years after India\u2019s independence, the country quietly crawled into space research, taking baby steps at the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) near Thiruvananthapuram. The mother who conceived the baby and gave it an ambitious vision and plan was Vikram Sarabhai, whose remarkable international contacts (networks in modern day terminology) helped a great deal to incubate the baby into robust health. Domestic political support gave it the ecosystem to grow further. The birth, growth and performance of the Indian Space Programme (ISP) is a remarkable achievement of independent India. ISP had made India proud and continues to increase India\u2019s stature in the comity of nations (developed, emerging and developing). ISP started with a small cluster of remarkable persons\u2014scientists, engineers, technicians, and administrators, who made several breakthroughs in building up a technological infrastructure even amidst an international geopolitical strategy to deny India certain critical technologies for the ISP. That challenge, though a hurdle in the short term, helped create many heroes (male and female), who have made India self-reliant in many aspects and ensured global respect for its space technology strengths.\n\nOne of the tallest amongst them was Avul Pakir Jainulabudin Abdul Kalam (known to many as Kalam, and he himself would pick up the phone and say \u201cKalam here\u201d). He was amongst the earliest recruits to the ISP. He started his career in TERLS during 1963\u2014later in 1969, all these ISP outfits came to be known as Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). He was a rocket engineer trained briefly at USA\u2019s NASA Wallop Rocket Launching station. That training was limited to the launch of rockets (Nike Apache\u2014missiles turned scientific sounding rockets). He could have been happy launching rockets bought to TERLS through Vikram Sarabhai\u2019s (VS) good offices.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThere was an impulse inside him (I know it personally through my conversations with him when he used to visit Ahmedabad from 1965 onwards to coordinate with space scientists of PRL or the Physical Research Laboratory\u2014the cradle of ISP), Kalam wanted to make the sounding rockets in India and design further to make huge rockets that could launch Indian satellites (such rockets are called Satellite Launch Vehicles [SLVs] to distinguish them from the missiles which hit the targets on the ground or air).\n\nIt was not just talk; he started indigenising what he could do within TERLS/ ISRO\u2019s capabilities\u2014nose cones, split nose-cones, nose cones made of fibre glass. In the process his rocket team got more confidence; some amongst them were Sudhakar and Madhavan Nair.\n\nThose were heady days for ISRO. VS brought about a project to bring USA\u2019s (yet to be built satellite) Application Technology satellite\u2014ATS-F over India for Satellite Television Experiment\u2014SITE, a major innovation in those days to use satellite broadcast from space to reach villages in India.\n\nSimultaneously. VS launched a major study project for defining and designing India\u2019s first SLV and a satellite to go on it\u2014Rohini Satellite,1 (RS-1). Entire teams at Space Science and Technology Centre (SSTC), now part of Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) at Thiruvananthapuram, started their studies and many reports were generated. The study teams were convened by Y.J. Rao, an aeronautical scientist/ engineer who came from USA at the call of VS. Kalam was also an active participant. I still vividly remember his enthusiasm and many dozens of young engineers who had joined SSTC and ISRO outfits at Thumba and Sriharikota. They were all sure that they were going to be a part of a revolution. It was later described by Satish Dhawan as \u201csuspension of disbelief\u201d. Kalam was a natural attraction for many of them because of his excessive enthusiasm and energy. Another reason (which was looked at, as a handicap in those days), was that he was a \u2018little junior\u2019 to the stalwarts of SSTC; almost all of them came after a doctoral study and work abroad, joined SSTC because of VS\u2019s persuasion and started at higher salary scales. For the younger group, he was more accessible and also tapped on their enthusiasm and knowledge. He was a fully indigenous product as most of those young persons. Kalam had the inner desire to lead the project of SLV-3 (the third variant of various design options was the successful pick for implementation). But there were no clear management structures for the project though the specialist divisions had clear status. That did not deter him from involving himself deeply with the then \u2018emerging evolution\u2019 of the SLV-3 project. In addition, he had taken up a few smaller projects desired by VS. So he was seen as a man of action. Such a passion to do and perseverance paid off immediately after the internal reorganisation of ISRO and the formation of Space Commission (SC)/ Department of Space (DoS), severing the links with the mother Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), soon after the demise of VS. VSSC was headed by Brahm Prakash and over all ISRO/ DoS headed by Satish Dhawan. Kalam was named as Project Manager for SLV-3. He could lead his dream project of SLV-3, the first satellite launch vehicle project of India. There were many ups and downs; several conflicts within the complex matrix management structure for the project\u2014inevitable due to the multi-disciplinary nature of the project. Most of the technologies were to be developed in India by highly competent and passionate groups of young people, many of them entering ISRO after an engineering degree or master degree in science. Brahm Prakash, Director, VSSC, was the solid rock on which such a complex and passionate drama revolved. Satish Dhawan orchestrated the teams. T.N. Seshan gave, through the government, an administrative structure \u201cwithout needlessly inelastic rules\u201d. The first launch attempt took place in 1979 and was a partial success but failed to launch a satellite. Already the first Indian satellite Aryabhata had been launched during 1975 with a Soviet launch vehicle as India could not wait to develop its own SLV (Chinese satellite launch in 1970 put the pressure on India). So the first launch failure was a great set back to ISRO and to Kalam\u2019s passion. The then Prime Minister, Charan Singh, sent an encouraging TELEX message. Satish Dhawan was the wall which protected the teams and ISRO from media criticism and public ridicule. That failure and the tremendous support from the leadership gave renewed strength to Kalam, culminating in a successful launch of SLV-3 during 1980. He was 49 then. The SLV-3 project made Kalam. It launched him upwards. The nation honoured him with the Padma Bhushan. The first ever poem on Kalam in Tamil was written by me and presented to him. It appeared later in my poem book, Nenjaga Malargal (Blossoms of the Heart). ISRO marched on with several other satellites and applications projects. It even started procuring a foreign operational communication satellite INSAT with also a meteorological payload to watch weather over India and Indian Ocean. Kalam had to move on. Post the SLV-3 period, the next couple of years were tough for him. ISRO had grown too big and complex. A challenging role had to be found for him, as he had crossed 50. That came about in the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP), to be taken up by the defence ministry. Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) was oriented to new directions during his short tenure by Raja Ramanna. He handed over the reins to the young V.S. Arunchalam. They planned to induct Kalamto lead IGMDP. That was a heaven-sent opportunity for Kalam who took up the new and much bigger challenge of developing a range of missiles to ensure the security of India.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe SLV-3 project and ISRO had honed him. Also, the wide network developed earlier for support to SLV-3 by industries from Koraput to Nasik to Ahmedabad to all over India, was of great help. VS Arunachalam was of great support to Kalam from the \u201cneedlessly inelastic rules\u201d and different working culture of DRDO then. Kalam, past 51, grew in stature and became much younger too with his tremendous enthusiasm to resolve a national problem. He created many more teams within DRDO and industry partners as well. Many of them were in their late 40s and 50s. But Kalam\u2019s enthusiasm was infectious. With the successful launch of Agni (biggest of the set of five missiles), in 1989, Kalam was hailed as the Missile Man of India. The baby steps he took at TERLS became a giant leap with that launch and the country\u2019s confidence in itself grew too.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHe knew that the full mission was not over. The missiles had to be productionised in large numbers and the ultimate consummation of Agni with nuclear arsenals was also needed. In an answer to a query during a public meeting about the payload for Agni, he quipped, \u201cWe have not made it to send roses!\u201d He had to wait for that final task several more years, especially to rally required political will.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, as the missile programme was settled well with several project directors taking care of them, Kalam could give some attention to a theme which was hidden in his heart from SLV-3 days: that is the use of various technologies for benefit of different sectors. That fortunately could be done through Technology Information Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC), which started in New Delhi, with large support by the then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and then secretary Department of Science and Technology, Vasant Gowariker, who was the father of Indian Solid Propellant programme. I had left ISRO in 1988 after the successful first operational flight of Indian Remote Sensing satellite IRS-1A in 1988. I was the first founder CEO (Executive Director of TIFAC, with V. Krishnamurthy, the great public sector industry doyen, as Chairman of the Council). Kalam actively worked with TIFAC to shape Composite Materials Mission. Our friendship came in handy.\n\nKalam meanwhile got an extension beyond 60 and replaced V.S. Arunachalam as chief of DRDO beginning from 1992. He became Chairman, TIFAC, in 1993 as well. The following period beyond was a double track for him\u2014large scale social and economic applications through TIFAC with teams all over India. Technology Vision 2020 was dedicated to nation in 1996 and the popular book India 2020 that electrified many minds came out in mid-1998. But just before that in May 1998, Kalam had achieved his most important goal of having India becoming a nuclear power. He worked with stalwarts of atomic energy like R. Chidambaram to get political approval and execute the project in total secrecy. With these two events (bomb and book) Kalam occupied the minds of all Indians and the Bharat Ratna was a natural culmination.\n\nEven amidst all this Kalam was concerned with specific gaps in DRDO\u2019s programmes. Having the supersonic missile, Indian-Russian project BrahMos as a joint venture under the leadership of his associate since SLV-3 days, A. Sivathanu Pillai as its chief, was a major organisational innovation. BrahMos was a great success and continues to be a world class product (that was made in India).\n\nKalam kept reinventing himself after new horizons kept coming even after he turned 69\u2014as principal scientific adviser to Government of India in 2000 and then the President of India 2002 (People\u2019s President). Naturally, he emphasised the applications of science and technology (S&T) and enthused youth to dream big. He also went beyond S&T and economic growth and tried to promote harmony amidst religious groups in India.\n\nLooking at the beginning, credit goes to ISRO and to the leaders and teams in ISRO in shaping people like Kalam.\n\nIn all these cases, the indomitable spirit to keep on with productive actions, irrespective of problems or age considerations, was the hallmark of Kalam and several others who made ISRO. Of course, this applies to many great achievers in the post independent India in several other fields. India can do more, if more Indians follow these basic principles:\n\n\u201cMaa the sangostu akarmani\u201d\n\n(Don\u2019t make friends with inaction)\n\n\u2014Bhagvad Gita\n\nY.S.

After graduation he joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)\u2014an Indian military research institute\u2014and later the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Kalam\u2019s associations were not limited to research organizations: he was also associated with political groups, such as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).\n\nA.P.J. Abdul Kalam served as president of the Republic of India from 2002 to 2007. As president, Kalam promoted the advancement of the national nuclear weapons program. Kalam also devised a 20-year action plan to achieve economic growth through technological development in India.\n\nA.P.J.

He was president of India from 2002 to 2007.\n\nKalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname \u201cMissile Man.\u201d Among those successes was Agni, India\u2019s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.\n\nBritannica Quiz Explore India Quiz\n\nFrom 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal scientific adviser (1999\u20132001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. His prominent role in the country\u2019s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community. In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and education.\n\nIn 2002 India\u2019s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put forward Kalam to succeed outgoing President Kocheril Raman Narayanan.

Kalam easily won the election and was sworn in as India\u2019s 11th president, a largely ceremonial post, in July 2002. He left office at the end of his term in 2007 and was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the country\u2019s first woman president.\n\nUpon returning to civilian life, Kalam remained committed to using science and technology to transform India into a developed country and served as a lecturer at several universities. On July 27, 2015, he collapsed while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong and was pronounced dead from cardiac arrest soon afterward.\n\nKalam wrote several books, including an autobiography, Wings of Fire (1999).

Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nAvul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.\n\nHis father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family. His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Even though his ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders, the family had lost most of its fortunes by the 1920s and was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born.\n\nMarakayar are a Muslim ethnic found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descendance from Arab traders and local women. Their business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers in order to add to the family's meager income. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost over time, apart from the ancestral home.\n\nCareer as a scientist\n\nThis was my first stage, in which I learnt leadership from three great teachers\u2014Dr Vikram Sarabhai, Prof Satish Dhawan and Dr Brahm Prakash. This was the time of learning and acquisition of knowledge for me.\n\nAfter graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.\n\nIn 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility. Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.\n\nOn 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on \"Creating a Livable Planet Earth\" at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest. At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life.[85] Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. IST.

He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.\n\nEarly life and education Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife. His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.[His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income.\n\nCareer as a scientist After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS). In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.\n\nPresidency Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007. On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, expressed that they would nominate Kalam for the post of President, and both the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy.After the Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam, Narayanan chose not to seek a second term in office, leaving the field clear Kalam said of the announcement of his candidature."}, {"url": "https://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/from-the-archives-a-p-j-abdul-kalam-into-space-and-down-to-earth-1890936-2021-12-22", "page_content": "Fifteen years after India\u2019s independence, the country quietly crawled into space research, taking baby steps at the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) near Thiruvananthapuram. The mother who conceived the baby and gave it an ambitious vision and plan was Vikram Sarabhai, whose remarkable international contacts (networks in modern day terminology) helped a great deal to incubate the baby into robust health. Domestic political support gave it the ecosystem to grow further. The birth, growth and performance of the Indian Space Programme (ISP) is a remarkable achievement of independent India. ISP had made India proud and continues to increase India\u2019s stature in the comity of nations (developed, emerging and developing). ISP started with a small cluster of remarkable persons\u2014scientists, engineers, technicians, and administrators, who made several breakthroughs in building up a technological infrastructure even amidst an international geopolitical strategy to deny India certain critical technologies for the ISP. That challenge, though a hurdle in the short term, helped create many heroes (male and female), who have made India self-reliant in many aspects and ensured global respect for its space technology strengths.\n\nOne of the tallest amongst them was Avul Pakir Jainulabudin Abdul Kalam (known to many as Kalam, and he himself would pick up the phone and say \u201cKalam here\u201d). He was amongst the earliest recruits to the ISP. He started his career in TERLS during 1963\u2014later in 1969, all these ISP outfits came to be known as Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). He was a rocket engineer trained briefly at USA\u2019s NASA Wallop Rocket Launching station. That training was limited to the launch of rockets (Nike Apache\u2014missiles turned scientific sounding rockets). He could have been happy launching rockets bought to TERLS through Vikram Sarabhai\u2019s (VS) good offices.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThere was an impulse inside him (I know it personally through my conversations with him when he used to visit Ahmedabad from 1965 onwards to coordinate with space scientists of PRL or the Physical Research Laboratory\u2014the cradle of ISP), Kalam wanted to make the sounding rockets in India and design further to make huge rockets that could launch Indian satellites (such rockets are called Satellite Launch Vehicles [SLVs] to distinguish them from the missiles which hit the targets on the ground or air).\n\nIt was not just talk; he started indigenising what he could do within TERLS/ ISRO\u2019s capabilities\u2014nose cones, split nose-cones, nose cones made of fibre glass. In the process his rocket team got more confidence; some amongst them were Sudhakar and Madhavan Nair.\n\nThose were heady days for ISRO. VS brought about a project to bring USA\u2019s (yet to be built satellite) Application Technology satellite\u2014ATS-F over India for Satellite Television Experiment\u2014SITE, a major innovation in those days to use satellite broadcast from space to reach villages in India.\n\nSimultaneously. VS launched a major study project for defining and designing India\u2019s first SLV and a satellite to go on it\u2014Rohini Satellite,1 (RS-1). Entire teams at Space Science and Technology Centre (SSTC), now part of Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) at Thiruvananthapuram, started their studies and many reports were generated. The study teams were convened by Y.J. Rao, an aeronautical scientist/ engineer who came from USA at the call of VS. Kalam was also an active participant. I still vividly remember his enthusiasm and many dozens of young engineers who had joined SSTC and ISRO outfits at Thumba and Sriharikota. They were all sure that they were going to be a part of a revolution. It was later described by Satish Dhawan as \u201csuspension of disbelief\u201d. Kalam was a natural attraction for many of them because of his excessive enthusiasm and energy. Another reason (which was looked at, as a handicap in those days), was that he was a \u2018little junior\u2019 to the stalwarts of SSTC; almost all of them came after a doctoral study and work abroad, joined SSTC because of VS\u2019s persuasion and started at higher salary scales. For the younger group, he was more accessible and also tapped on their enthusiasm and knowledge. He was a fully indigenous product as most of those young persons. Kalam had the inner desire to lead the project of SLV-3 (the third variant of various design options was the successful pick for implementation). But there were no clear management structures for the project though the specialist divisions had clear status. That did not deter him from involving himself deeply with the then \u2018emerging evolution\u2019 of the SLV-3 project. In addition, he had taken up a few smaller projects desired by VS. So he was seen as a man of action. Such a passion to do and perseverance paid off immediately after the internal reorganisation of ISRO and the formation of Space Commission (SC)/ Department of Space (DoS), severing the links with the mother Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), soon after the demise of VS. VSSC was headed by Brahm Prakash and over all ISRO/ DoS headed by Satish Dhawan. Kalam was named as Project Manager for SLV-3. He could lead his dream project of SLV-3, the first satellite launch vehicle project of India. There were many ups and downs; several conflicts within the complex matrix management structure for the project\u2014inevitable due to the multi-disciplinary nature of the project. Most of the technologies were to be developed in India by highly competent and passionate groups of young people, many of them entering ISRO after an engineering degree or master degree in science. Brahm Prakash, Director, VSSC, was the solid rock on which such a complex and passionate drama revolved. Satish Dhawan orchestrated the teams. T.N. Seshan gave, through the government, an administrative structure \u201cwithout needlessly inelastic rules\u201d. The first launch attempt took place in 1979 and was a partial success but failed to launch a satellite. Already the first Indian satellite Aryabhata had been launched during 1975 with a Soviet launch vehicle as India could not wait to develop its own SLV (Chinese satellite launch in 1970 put the pressure on India). So the first launch failure was a great set back to ISRO and to Kalam\u2019s passion. The then Prime Minister, Charan Singh, sent an encouraging TELEX message. Satish Dhawan was the wall which protected the teams and ISRO from media criticism and public ridicule. That failure and the tremendous support from the leadership gave renewed strength to Kalam, culminating in a successful launch of SLV-3 during 1980. He was 49 then. The SLV-3 project made Kalam. It launched him upwards. The nation honoured him with the Padma Bhushan. The first ever poem on Kalam in Tamil was written by me and presented to him. It appeared later in my poem book, Nenjaga Malargal (Blossoms of the Heart). ISRO marched on with several other satellites and applications projects. It even started procuring a foreign operational communication satellite INSAT with also a meteorological payload to watch weather over India and Indian Ocean. Kalam had to move on. Post the SLV-3 period, the next couple of years were tough for him. ISRO had grown too big and complex. A challenging role had to be found for him, as he had crossed 50. That came about in the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP), to be taken up by the defence ministry. Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) was oriented to new directions during his short tenure by Raja Ramanna. He handed over the reins to the young V.S. Arunchalam. They planned to induct Kalamto lead IGMDP. That was a heaven-sent opportunity for Kalam who took up the new and much bigger challenge of developing a range of missiles to ensure the security of India.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe SLV-3 project and ISRO had honed him. Also, the wide network developed earlier for support to SLV-3 by industries from Koraput to Nasik to Ahmedabad to all over India, was of great help. VS Arunachalam was of great support to Kalam from the \u201cneedlessly inelastic rules\u201d and different working culture of DRDO then. Kalam, past 51, grew in stature and became much younger too with his tremendous enthusiasm to resolve a national problem. He created many more teams within DRDO and industry partners as well. Many of them were in their late 40s and 50s. But Kalam\u2019s enthusiasm was infectious. With the successful launch of Agni (biggest of the set of five missiles), in 1989, Kalam was hailed as the Missile Man of India. The baby steps he took at TERLS became a giant leap with that launch and the country\u2019s confidence in itself grew too.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHe knew that the full mission was not over. The missiles had to be productionised in large numbers and the ultimate consummation of Agni with nuclear arsenals was also needed. In an answer to a query during a public meeting about the payload for Agni, he quipped, \u201cWe have not made it to send roses!\u201d He had to wait for that final task several more years, especially to rally required political will.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, as the missile programme was settled well with several project directors taking care of them, Kalam could give some attention to a theme which was hidden in his heart from SLV-3 days: that is the use of various technologies for benefit of different sectors. That fortunately could be done through Technology Information Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC), which started in New Delhi, with large support by the then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and then secretary Department of Science and Technology, Vasant Gowariker, who was the father of Indian Solid Propellant programme. I had left ISRO in 1988 after the successful first operational flight of Indian Remote Sensing satellite IRS-1A in 1988. I was the first founder CEO (Executive Director of TIFAC, with V. Krishnamurthy, the great public sector industry doyen, as Chairman of the Council). Kalam actively worked with TIFAC to shape Composite Materials Mission. Our friendship came in handy.\n\nKalam meanwhile got an extension beyond 60 and replaced V.S. Arunachalam as chief of DRDO beginning from 1992. He became Chairman, TIFAC, in 1993 as well. The following period beyond was a double track for him\u2014large scale social and economic applications through TIFAC with teams all over India. Technology Vision 2020 was dedicated to nation in 1996 and the popular book India 2020 that electrified many minds came out in mid-1998. But just before that in May 1998, Kalam had achieved his most important goal of having India becoming a nuclear power. He worked with stalwarts of atomic energy like R. Chidambaram to get political approval and execute the project in total secrecy. With these two events (bomb and book) Kalam occupied the minds of all Indians and the Bharat Ratna was a natural culmination.\n\nEven amidst all this Kalam was concerned with specific gaps in DRDO\u2019s programmes. Having the supersonic missile, Indian-Russian project BrahMos as a joint venture under the leadership of his associate since SLV-3 days, A. Sivathanu Pillai as its chief, was a major organisational innovation. BrahMos was a great success and continues to be a world class product (that was made in India).\n\nKalam kept reinventing himself after new horizons kept coming even after he turned 69\u2014as principal scientific adviser to Government of India in 2000 and then the President of India 2002 (People\u2019s President). Naturally, he emphasised the applications of science and technology (S&T) and enthused youth to dream big. He also went beyond S&T and economic growth and tried to promote harmony amidst religious groups in India.\n\nLooking at the beginning, credit goes to ISRO and to the leaders and teams in ISRO in shaping people like Kalam.\n\nIn all these cases, the indomitable spirit to keep on with productive actions, irrespective of problems or age considerations, was the hallmark of Kalam and several others who made ISRO. Of course, this applies to many great achievers in the post independent India in several other fields. India can do more, if more Indians follow these basic principles:\n\n\u201cMaa the sangostu akarmani\u201d\n\n(Don\u2019t make friends with inaction)\n\n\u2014Bhagvad Gita\n\nY.S.
