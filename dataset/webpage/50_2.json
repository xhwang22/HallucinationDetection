Born in Melbourne, Gielnik grew up in Queensland playing a different kind of round ball sport: basketball. Injuries saw her eventually pick up football at age 12.\n\nShe played her junior football at Redlands United. Current Junior Matildas coach and Football Australia Women\u2019s Technical Advisor Rae Dower was the Technical Director at the club when Gielnik was there.\n\nDespite making the Queensland squad for the National Championships, Gielnik didn\u2019t make it into the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) team.\n\nShe would end up in the QAS team eventually, thanks to a school trip to Canberra where she took part in a Matildas training session at the AIS under then-coach Tom Sermanni.\n\n\n\nSermanni suggested Gielnik to the QAS coach at the time, Jeff Hopkins, who would go on to work with Gielnik in the W-League at Brisbane Roar and Melbourne Victory.\n\nGielnik\u2019s domestic career mirrored that of her national team one. A strong season in orange saw her earn the \u2018super sub\u2019 tag where she helped the Roar make a grand final. Later in 2012, she made her senior national team debut against Japan at the age of 20.\n\nBut after breaking into the national team, she spent some time away from the W-League and the Matildas.\n\nShe explored passions outside football and opened a gym, working on her own fitness and helping others. Fitness is still something that interests her as she is currently undertaking a Bachelor of Exercise Science alongside club and country teammate Clare Polkinghorne.\n\nGielnik worked hard to get back onto the national team radar. While she didn\u2019t make the squad for the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in Canada, she was a part of the team which qualified for the Rio Olympics the following year.\n\n\n\nThe forward scored her first national team goal in that tournament in a 9-0 win over Vietnam.\n\nHowever, with plenty of talent and a small squad, Gielnik didn\u2019t make the final cut. Instead, she travelled as an alternate player.\n\nAt the time, Gielnik said her omission left her genuinely heartbroken and described it as the biggest emotional toll football had ever taken on her.\n\nFollowing on from being so close to selection, Gielnik moved to Norway before linking back up with Jeff Hopkins, this time at Melbourne Victory in the W-League.\n\nA \u2018feel good, play well\u2019 kind of player, Gielnik returned to the national team fold and began to cement herself in the team, adding more goals to her tally.\n\nShe was selected to go to Jordan in 2018 for the AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup and to France in 2019 where she played in three of Australia\u2019s four matches.\n\nA move to German giants Bayern Munich saw her learn plenty about herself but she returned to Scandinavia and the W-League once again.\n\n\n\nA scintillating 2020-21 season with Brisbane Roar saw Gielnik take home the golden boot before she signed for Vittsj\u00f6 in Sweden. With 10 goals in 42 games for her country, the determined and dedicated Gielnik is inching ever close to half a century of caps.\n\nA strong presence with the ability to play on the wing and more centrally, Gielnik is an invaluable asset to the Matildas in Tokyo."}, {"url": "https://fbref.com/en/players/140cee9f/Emily-Gielnik", "page_content": "About FBref.com\n\nFBref.com launched (June 13, 2018) with domestic league coverage for England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and United States.

One of being knocked down and finding your steel.\n\nMaking choices\n\nIt was not a forgone conclusion that Gielnik would end up in football. Like many Matildas, Gielnik was a naturally gifted athlete from a young age with a penchant towards competing with the best.\n\nA basketballer to begin with, it was a serendipitous intervention from her mother that led to her finding a ball at her feet.\n\n\u201cI was one of those kids who could play any sport, I was very competitive and would play basketball and rugby against the boys,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cMum would stress about me getting injured, so as a compromise, I convinced her to let me play football instead and that\u2019s where my journey started.\u201d\n\nGielnik realised early on that she had a knack for scoring goals \u2013 it would be a theme of her career.\n\n\u201cIn the early days, I was never about the discipline or the skill of football, I just played for fun and would score from anywhere and everywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cI actually scored 62 goals the first school season I played and most of them were toe punts because I\u2019d never had a coach to teach me that technique back then.\u201d\n\nOnce she received the proper coaching her transition to the beautiful game was seamless. Soon the Queenslander would be impressing those around her, resulting in her selection for U12s State Team.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started playing in a proper team, I had a world of confidence,\u201d she remembered.\n\n\u201cI was in my prime. I wasn\u2019t the most skilled player, but I had the speed, agility and competitiveness that helped me pick things up really quickly.\u201d\n\nThis natural athletic ability would continue to guide her to success.\n\nTaking the long road\n\nCheryl Salisbury, Diane Alagich, Joey Peters, Heather Garriock \u2013 they are some of the luminaries of Australian women\u2019s football.\n\nAnd in 2007 in Coffs Harbour, they were preparing for what would be a history making FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup campaign in China.\n\nWatching on was a young Emily Gielnik and what she saw on that day changed the trajectory of her life.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I saw the Matildas play in Coffs Harbour when I was 14, I knew I wanted to make the team one day,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\nAlthough the decision was made in her young mind, Gielnik\u2019s pathway to elite football was not going to be easy, nor conventional.\n\nShe learnt early on, that she was going to have to make the journey her own.\n\n\u201cThat year [2007] was really tough for me as I\u2019d had some bad injuries and missed out on selection. So I took a year off, which was really make or break for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of my friends received invitations from the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) but having that year off combined with some injuries meant I didn\u2019t make it.\n\n\u201cAll I wanted was to play in the Young Matildas and the W-League. I saw everyone get ahead of me, which was tough, but it didn\u2019t deter me, it motivated me to find another way.\u201d\n\nWhile it felt like doors were closing around the young footballer, in another fortuitous moment, a door opened up for Gielnik. And again, it involved the Matildas.\n\n\u201cAfter I missed out on QAS, I went on a school tour to the Australian Institute of Sport and the Matildas just happened to be training there with Tom Sermanni. My school coach asked if I could join in and I had an absolute blinder,\u201d Gielnik recalled.\n\n\u201cI was 15, totally intimidated and playing against the best female footballers in the country, but Tom called my coach afterwards wanting to get me into the QAS program and that was where I found my way in.\u201d\n\nMastering the art of resilience\n\nBeing a part of the QAS program opened new avenues for Gielnik.\n\nThat same year she also achieved another one of her goals by making the Brisbane Roar squad for the inaugural W-League season in 2008.\n\nCoached by Jeff Hopkins, it was a Brisbane Roar team littered with some of the greats of Australian women\u2019s football in Kate McShea and future stars including Clare Polkinghorne, Tameka Butt and Elise Kellond-Knight-Knight.\n\nAgain, the progress was tempered by a setback, The 16 year old was sidelined for the entire season after sustaining a stress fracture to her ankle.\n\nNot for the first time in her young career, Gielnik would have to call on her resilience. Gielnik didn\u2019t have time to grieve, as her eyes were firmly set on recovering and proving herself to her teammates and to herself.\n\n\u201cWhen I first made the Brisbane Roar squad, I was so nervous and more than anything I just wanted to gain the respect of the older players,\u201d she shared.\n\n\u201cIt took me a long time to believe I deserved to be there. I was disciplined and just spent the first few seasons earning my spot and spending a lot of time in the grandstands and on the bench.\u201d\n\nGielnik believes it was a change in mindset that led to her performance improving and earning her moniker, the \u2018super sub.\u2019\n\n\u201cAfter years of injury, missing out on squads and spending finals in the grandstands, I finally got my chance in the 2011/12 season.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was subbed on in extra time and in that season scored 12 goals, all while only being on for five or 10 minutes.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I started to believe in myself and prove my worth, that everything came together.\u201d\n\nHer form continued and Gielnik ticked another goal off her list, making the Young Matildas squad.\n\nDuring her junior national team debut at the AFC U19 Women\u2019s Championships, the then 19-year-old took the Young Matildas from a 3-1 deficit to a 4-3 win, when she scored an incredible hattrick in the second half.\n\n\u201cDuring that game, I really felt like I hadn\u2019t played a good first half of football,\u201d she said of her first match as a Young Matilda.\n\n\u201cWe were down 1-0 and I was panicking. I thought to myself, \u2018I\u2019m going to be subbed off on my debut,\u2019 but then I scored that first goal which gave me so much confidence and I just kept scoring.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat game was a real turning point in my career and one of my key memories in the green and gold.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the first time I felt like I belonged and deserved to be in that team. It showed me that even though you may have some bad minutes or a bad half there is always a way to turn it around.\u201d\n\nAnd turn it around she did, making her debut for the senior Matildas the following year in Japan.\n\n\u201cIt was so overwhelming because there were so many girls in that team I had idolised and never truly believed I would be up there with,\u201d Gielnik recounted of her Matildas debut.\n\n\u201cInstead of looking up to them as a fan, I was now competing for their position which was pretty surreal.\n\n\u201cIt came to a point where I had to see myself as an equal and understand that I had a job to do in representing my country.\n\n\u201cInstead of thinking about how lucky I was, I had to embrace that this was now my reality.\u201d\n\nThe 14 year old who had watched her heroes years before was now playing alongside them in the jersey she dreamed to pull on.\n\nPART II: The making of Emily Gielnik will be published on 17 March\n\nRelated Images:"}, {"url": "https://www.matildas.com.au/news/westfield-matildas-home-emily-gielniks-halfway-there", "page_content": "As the Westfield W-League inches ever closer to the finals series, fans were treated to another round filled with incredible goals and saves.\n\n\n\nThe story of the round belonged to Westfield Matildas cap 192, Larissa Crummer. Her goal was arguably the least impressive visually of Brisbane Roar\u2019s four goal; a tap in inside the six yard box following a cross from Kaitlyn Torpey.\n\nBut what it lacked in stunning visuals it more than made up for in incredible narrative. Two years after Crummer broke her leg in a match for the Newcastle Jets against Adelaide United, she returned to a Westfield W-League pitch for the first time in 758 days.

After stopping basketball due to injuries she took up soccer and was eventually signed by Brisbane Roar for the second season of the W\u2013League.[1] At Brisbane she became recognised as a \"super sub\" for her knack of coming off the substitutes' bench to score late goals.[2] Gielnik played eight seasons at Brisbane, appearing in 83 games and scoring 30 goals. She won the W-League Championship in 2010\u201311 and the Premiership in 2012\u201313 and 2017\u201318.[3]\n\nLiverpool LFC and Ottawa Fury, 2012\u20132013\n\nIn May 2012, Gielnik signed for English club Liverpool L.F.C., during the 2012 FA WSL season.[4] In October 2012, she was one of ten players to be released by Liverpool's new manager Mark Beard.[5] In 2013, Gielnik joined Ottawa Fury for their W-League season.[6]\n\nUrawa Red Diamonds, 2016\n\nAfter the 2016 Olympics, Gielnik joined Japanese club Urawa Red Diamonds.[7]\n\nAvaldsnes IL, 2017\n\nGielnik joined Norwegen team Avaldsnes IL for the 2017 season. She had a breakout season with the team, scoring eight goals in league play. Avaldsnes finished second in the Toppserien and won the Norwegian Cup.[8]\n\nMelbourne Victory, 2018\u20132019\n\nGielnik signed with Melbourne Victory for the 2018\u201319 W-League season.\n\nBayern Munich, 2019\u20132020\n\nOn 23 August 2019, Gielnik joined German Frauen-Bundesliga club Bayern Munich.[9] In July 2020, she left the club after making only 6 appearances, partially due to injury.[10]\n\nVittsj\u00f6, 2020\n\nA week after leaving Bayern Munich, Gielnik signed with another European club, joining Swedish club Vittsj\u00f6.[11]\n\nBrisbane Roar, 2020\u2013\n\nIn November 2020, Gielnik returned Australia, signing with her hometown club, Brisbane Roar.[12]\n\nInternational career\n\nGielnik scored a hat-trick on her international debut for Australia U-19s in October 2011.[1] She made her first appearance for the senior Matildas team in a 3\u20130 friendly defeat to World champions Japan in Tokyo on 11 July 2012.[13]\n\nGielnik was named to the Australian squad for 2016 Olympic Qualifying, she scored a goal against Vietnam.[14] Australia won the tournament and qualified for the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\nGielnik was part of the Matildas squad that won the 2017 Tournament of Nations and defeated the United States for the first time ever.[15]\n\nAt the 2018 AFC Women's Asian Cup Gielnik appeared in three matches for Australia.

But football was definitely the right choice.\n\n\u201cMy Mum didn\u2019t want me playing football initially, she thought basketball was a safer option, I loved it, but then it became too much once I played football as well at the age of 12, I had to decide, and football took over.\u201d\n\nA good choice. Gielnik's gilded, and nomadic, career has taken her to the top flights in Canada, Japan, Norway, Sweden and Germany - where she played for Bayern Munich - as well as Australia. Now she intends to make Villa a more permanent home.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s been a personal preference of mine, I\u2019ve always only signed a one-year contract,\u201d Gielnik added. \u201cThis is the first year where I\u2019ve signed a 1+1. That\u2019s a big shift for me, which means I\u2019ve had a good feeling about this club.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to really experience all the different styles of football and the different cultures, and where I can develop in different countries, so I\u2019m pretty fortunate that I\u2019ve been around the world. That was my decision, and I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve done it that way, I\u2019ve definitely grown from having been in all those situations, and now I\u2019ve landed here.\u201d\n\nYet, Gielnik is not a Women\u2019s Super League debutant. Her goal for Villa at Brighton was her first in the WSL for more than nine years, since she netted for Liverpool in a 3-3 draw away at Notts County in 2012. She spent one season on Merseyside, but knows she returns now transformed as a player, and to a completely changed league.\n\n\u201cIt was always on my radar, to end up back in the WSL, but I don\u2019t really want to count it as being in the WSL 10 years ago, because that was not the league it is now. The WSL has come on leaps and bounds. Back then with Liverpool, I was only training twice a week, so I\u2019m kind of treating this as my first time here.\"\n\nLife at Villa - who host league leaders Arsenal on Saturday - is going well so far, as they have seven points from their opening three goals, boosted by her strike at Brighton, a calm finish into the corner after being played through one-on-one.\n\n\u201cGetting the winner and getting my first goal, I felt I kind of needed to get that one out of the way,\" she said. \"Those first few games, you want to start strong and get some points on the board early.\u201d\n\nThe English league looks set to suit Gielnik's strong, quick and clinical style. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m the most technical striker but I\u2019m a very counter-attacking, ball-in-behind, fast-paced, off-the-shoulder kind of player,\" she added. \"I\u2019m not much of a dribbler, but I love on the end of crosses and I also love delivering crosses, breaking the lines and getting in behind.\u201d\n\nHer move to Villa was one that almost didn\u2019t happen, after multiple approaches from the West Midlands club, before she was ultimately persuaded to move on September\u2019s deadline day after a short spell with Swedish top-tier side Vittsjo GIK.\n\nGielnik explained: \u201cI\u2019d had several conversations with my agent, just telling him to politely decline any others that had come through during the Olympics, so there were a few knock-backs already to Carla [Ward], but she was pretty persistent and that actually worked on me in the end because I actually needed a change. Carla had belief in me and wants me to progress. I told her how adamant I am to improve and get better and she is willing to provide that.\n\n\u201cThe question I asked Carla was just about the team: Is it good people and is it a good environment? Those were the two big things for me. After a few phone calls, it turned out to be the right thing for me to do. Now I\u2019ve landed here so hopefully I can gain some consistency here at this club and lead myself into the 2023 World Cup.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://pickstar.pro/au/our-stars/3979/emily-gielnik", "page_content": "Emily is a Football player who plays for Bayern Munich in the Frauen-Bundesliga\n\nand the Australian national team.

I feel confident around those types of players.\n\n\"I'm pretty excited to get going.\"\n\nA revised fixture due to Sydney's COVID scare means the Roar will kick off their campaign as part of a double header with the club's A-League team at Dolphin Stadium in Redcliffe on Tuesday.\n\nCity have taken over the mantle as the competition benchmark from the Roar in recent times and were near unstoppable on their way to a fourth championship in the past five seasons in the last campaign.\n\n\"Personally it couldn't have been any better news. Number one, it's a home game and number two, you're playing the reigning champs,\" Gielnik said.\n\n\"Melbourne City is the name that everyone dreads playing but I couldn't be more excited.\n\n\"I'd much rather play them now, see where we're at. To be honest if I could pick any team in the league to play first, it would be them.\""}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/58421345", "page_content": "Last updated on .From the section Women's Football\n\nEmily Gielnik has scored 10 times in 43 international appearances for Australia\n\nAston Villa have signed Australia international striker Emily Gielnik for the 2021-22 Women's Super League season from Swedish club Vittsj\u00f6 GIK.\n\nGielnik, 29, will be making her second appearance in English club football after spending a season with Liverpool in 2012-13.\n\nThe move, subject to international travel clearance, is Villa boss Carla Ward's ninth summer signing.\n\n\"Emily is someone we've monitored for a few months,\" said Ward.\n\n\"She's a player with a wealth of domestic and international experience.
