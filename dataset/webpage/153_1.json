This was at the National Aquatic Centre, Beijing, China, yesterday.\n\nA silver medallist in the 100-metre individual medley on Thursday night, the 29-year-old Bovell, a four-time Olympian, went one better in the 50m freestyle splash when he raced home in 20.98 seconds from lane four, his fourth straight sub-21 clocking to take gold and the US$1,500 winners prize to up his World Cup earnings to US$14,500.\n\nHis main rival, USA\u2019s 2000 Olympic champion, Anthony Ervin and winner of the three other 50m freestyle finals, got silver from lane three in 21.19 while Australian Cameron Mc Evoy took bronze in 21.46 from lane five.\n\nSpeaking after his win, the T&T swimmer said, \u201cI fought back tonight (yesterday) with another sub-21 effort to win the 50m free. The American Anthony Ervin wasn\u2019t able to match my speed as I answered his challenge from Berlin.\n\nThe score of the rivalry now stands at 3-3 with two stops to go. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t quite as fast as I had been in Stockholm as there were a few minor errors but anytime I can swim below 21, I will take it and be thankful. It\u2019s not easy, but my consistency is paying off here\u201d, said Bovell III.\n\nThe 2004 Athens Greece bronze medallist now has 12 medals (five gold, seven silver). He also won gold in the 50m freestyle in Sweden (20.82), a new national record and Moscow (20.90) in back-to-back meets while his other sub-21 clocking came in Berlin last month, 20.97, in a silver swim.\n\nHis time of 20.82 also puts him as the second fastest swimmer in the 50m freestyle behind 2008 Olympic champion, Brazilian Cesar Cielo. The other finishers in the gold medal splash were Finland\u2019s Ari-Pekka Liukkonen (21.63), Aussie duo Kyle Richardson (21.73) and Tomasso D\u2019Orgogna (21.80), and Chinese swimmers, Zhiwu Lu (22.00) and Yang Shi (22.16).\n\nEarlier on in the morning heats, the USA-based top T&T swimmer and seventh placed finisher in the men\u2019s 50m freestyle final at the London Olympic Games, won the fifth and final heat 21.55 ahead of Mc Evoy (21.57), D\u2019Orgogna (21.71), Chinese Taipei\u2019s Kuo-Chi Chang (22.43), China\u2019s Tengfei Shi (22.55), Russian, Viacheslav Prudnikov (22.92) and home town duo, Zhaochen Liu (23.09) and Enjian Zhang (23.33).\n\nBovell III\u2019s time was also the top qualifier for the finals ahead of Mc Evoy while D\u2019Orgogna has the fourth fastest time. Ervin won heat three in 21.68 for the third best time while Richardson was second in the heat in 21.80 and fifth best overall, and Shi, third in 22.22 for the eight and final top qualifying time. Liukkonen (21.83) and Lu (22.10) were the top two swimmers from heat three.\n\nPrior to the meet in China, Bovell had 92 points to trail To (110) while Japan\u2019s Daiya Seto was next with 81 and with his gold and silver swim, the T&T swimmer was expected to close the gap at the top even more with two more legs to come in Tokyo, Japan, on Tuesday and Wednesday followed by Singapore on Saturday and Sunday, after which the top ranked swimmer will get US$100,000, second US$50,000 and third, US$30,000.\n\nBy Nigel Simon\n\nSource: www.guardian.co.tt"}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/george-bovell/", "page_content": "George Richard Lytcott Bovell (born 18 July 1983) is an Olympic bronze medalist swimmer and former world record holder from Trinidad and Tobago. Bovell is also a two-time World Championship bronze medalist, a record five-time Olympian and is the Caribbean region's most successful swimmer.\n\nBovell is also respected for his voluntary philanthropic initiatives such as \"The World Swim Against Malaria and Drowning\" in Uganda, 2013, with his friend, Ugandan swimmer, Max Kanyarezi. He is known for organizing and conducting the annual \"George Bovell Dive In Free Swim Clinics\", that are free for the youth of Trinidad and Tobago who enjoy the privilege of being coached and mentored by renowned Olympic Medalist Swimmers from around the world. Bovell has been the writer of the popular inspirational newspaper column in the Trinidad Guardian entitled \"Reflections Off The Water\".

At the 2004 Olympics, he won a bronze medal in the men's 200 IM: the 9th medalist in the country's history and 12th medal overall. It was also the first-ever Olympic swimming medal for the country, and T&T's only medal from the 2004 Olympics. Bovell also made it to the Finals of the 50m Freestyle in London where he placed 7th in the fastest field ever assembled after returning from a forced hiatus due to a brain injury earlier in the season. Bovell carried the T&T flag at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics in 2008, the 20th Central American and Caribbean Games in Cartagena, Colombia and in the closing ceremonies of the 2000, 2004 and 2012 Olympic Games.\n\nWorld Championships\n\nIn 2013 Bovell won the Bronze Medal in the 50m freestyle at the FINA World Long Course Championships in Barcelona against the fastest field ever assembled in the sport, one in which every competitor in the final was an Olympic Medalist.

They comprise five intertwined rings in the colors blue, yellow, black, green, and red, set upon a white background. These intertwined rings represent the unity of the five continents. The rings were introduced at the Antwerp Games in 1920.\n\nThe rings are also featured on the Olympic flag which is hoisted at the start of each celebration of the Olympics. The flag is three meters long and two meters wide.\n\nTHE OLYMPIC CREED\n\nThe Olympic Creed states: \"The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part, just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.\"\n\nTHE OLYMPIC FLAME\n\nThe Olympic Flame or Olympic Fire is a symbol of the Olympic Games. It commemorates the theft of fire from the Greek god Zeus by Prometheus. In Ancient Greece a fire was kept burning throughout the celebration of the ancient Olympics. The fire was reintroduced at the Olympics in 1928. As with the Ancient Olympics, once the flame has been lit, it is kept burning throughout the celebration of the Olympics, and is extinguished at end of the closing ceremony of the Games.\n\nTHE OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY\n\nThe Olympic Torch Relay, which culminates in the lighting of the Olympic cauldron at the Opening Ceremony of each Games, was introduced in 1936 at the Berlin Games. It was created to symbolize the link between the ancient and modern Olympic Games.\n\nThe Torch is lighted in Olympia several months before the opening celebration of the Olympic Games at the site of the ancient Olympics in Olympia, Greece, and brought to the host city by runners carrying the torch in relay. The Olympic Torch Relay ends on the day of the opening ceremony in the central stadium of the Games. The final torch bearer runs to the cauldron and, using the torch, starts the flame in the stadium.\n\nOPENING CEREMONY\n\nThe traditional part of the ceremony starts with a parade of nations, during which most participating athletes march into the stadium country by country. One athlete from each country carries the flag of his or her nation, leading the entourage of other athletes from that country. After all nations have entered, the organizing country's head of state formally opens the Olympics.\n\nThe Olympic Anthem is then played, and the Olympic flag is hoisted in the stadium. The runner before the last in the Olympic Flame Relay brings the torch into the stadium, passing the flame to the last carrier. The last torch bearer then lights the fire in the stadium's cauldron. This is followed by the release of doves, symbolising peace. Finally, the flag bearers of all countries circle a rostrum, where one athlete and one referee will give the Olympic Oath, stating that they will compete and judge according to the rules.\n\nTHE CLOSING CEREMONY\n\nThe athletes march around the stadium randomly, instead of nation by nation. The Olympic fire is then extinguished, and the Olympic flag is lowered, folded, and presented to the mayor of the host city of the next Olympic Games. The IOC president ends the ceremonies by declaring the Games closed.\n\nTHE MEDALS\n\nOlympic medals are awarded to those individuals or teams placing first, second, and third in each event. The first place winner receives a gold-plated medal of silver, which is commonly referred to as the \"gold medal.\" Second and third places receive medals of silver and bronze respectively. The silver used in the first and second place medals must be at least 92.5% pure. The \"gold\" medals must be gilded with at least six grams of pure gold. Medals also carry the name of the sport contested.\n\nThe medals given at the Olympic Winter Games differ from the traditional medals given at the Summer Games. Each Organizing Committee designs its own medals that must be approved by the IOC.\n\nCompetitors who finish in the 1st through 8th places in an Olympic event receive an award diploma. The IOC awards commemorative pins to each athlete who participates in the Olympic Games."}, {"url": "https://www.guardian.co.tt/sports/bovell-iii-honoured-to-be-in-hall-of-fame-6.2.1110968.fb06ed4383", "page_content": "T&T Olympic Games bronze medal swim\u00admer (2004 Athens), and for\u00admer world record hold\u00ader, George Bovell III says he is ho\u00adn\u00adoured to have been in\u00adduct\u00aded to the First Cit\u00adi\u00adzens Sports Foun\u00adda\u00adtion Hall of Fame.\n\nThe 36-year-old Bovell, who now re\u00adsides in Cana\u00adda fol\u00adlow\u00ading his re\u00adtire\u00adment from the sport al\u00admost four years ago was in\u00adduct\u00aded on Sun\u00adday, April 11, along with for\u00admer out\u00adstand\u00ading T&T ath\u00adletes Claude Noel (box\u00ading), and Cheryl Ann Sankar (taek\u00adwon\u00addo), Dex\u00adter St Louis (ta\u00adble ten\u00adnis/posthu\u00admous) as well as coach\u00ades Bertille St Clair (foot\u00adball), Lester Os\u00adouna (ath\u00adlet\u00adics), crick\u00adet um\u00adpire Ralph Go\u00adsein (posthu\u00admous) and ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtors Rev Dr Iva Gloudon, David Far\u00adrell, and sports jour\u00adnal\u00adist Dave Lamy (posthu\u00admous).\n\nOver his out\u00adstand\u00ading swim\u00adming ca\u00adreer which spanned al\u00admost more than 20 years, Bovell rep\u00adre\u00adsent\u00aded T&T at 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016 Olympics.\n\nAt the 2004 Olympics, he won a bronze medal in the men's 200 IM, the ninth medal\u00adist in the coun\u00adtry's his\u00adto\u00adry and 12th medal over\u00adall.\n\nIt was al\u00adso the first-ever Olympic swim\u00adming medal for the coun\u00adtry and T&T's on\u00adly medal from the 2004 Olympics.\n\nBovell al\u00adso made it to the fi\u00adnals of the 50m Freestyle in Lon\u00addon where he placed sev\u00adenth in the fastest field ever as\u00adsem\u00adbled af\u00adter re\u00adturn\u00ading from a forced hia\u00adtus due to a brain in\u00adjury ear\u00adli\u00ader in the sea\u00adson.\n\nHe was T&T's flag bear\u00ader at the open\u00ading cer\u00ade\u00admo\u00adny of the Bei\u00adjing Olympics in 2008, the 20th Cen\u00adtral Amer\u00adi\u00adcan and Caribbean (CAC) Games in Carta\u00adge\u00adna, Colom\u00adbia and in the clos\u00ading cer\u00ade\u00admonies of 2000, 2004 and 2012 Olympic Games.\n\nAt FI\u00adNA World Cham\u00adpi\u00adonships events, Bovell won the bronze in 2013 in the 50m Long Course freestyle fi\u00adnal in (21.51 sec\u00adonds) at Barcelona against the fastest field ever as\u00adsem\u00adbled in the sport, one in which every com\u00adpeti\u00adtor in the fi\u00adnal was an Olympic medal\u00adist.\n\nA year ear\u00adli\u00ader he al\u00adso se\u00adcured bronze in the 100m in\u00addi\u00advid\u00adual med\u00adley at the World Short Course Cham\u00adpi\u00adonships in Is\u00adtan\u00adbul, a tes\u00adta\u00adment to his ver\u00adsa\u00adtil\u00adi\u00adty.\n\nOver\u00adall, he has been in ten World Cham\u00adpi\u00adonship fi\u00adnals since his first in 2001 and has won six Pan Amer\u00adi\u00adcan Games medals (two gold, two sil\u00adver and two bronze) along with eight CAC Games medals (three gold, two sil\u00adver and three bronze), both over three edi\u00adtions of the events.\n\nBovell who was sec\u00adond over\u00adall on the 2012 FI\u00adNA World Cup medals list with 16 (sev\u00aden gold and nine sil\u00adver) and a five-time NCAA in\u00addi\u00advid\u00adual cham\u00adpi\u00adon said it\u2019s a great ho\u00adn\u00adour to be in\u00adduct\u00aded in\u00adto our na\u00adtion\u00adal sport\u00ading Hall of Fame said, \"I was in Coim\u00adbat\u00adore, South In\u00addia, study\u00ading Ayurve\u00adda, when they told me about it, and had planned to re\u00adturn to the jun\u00adgle in Pe\u00adru for a few weeks to learn more about tra\u00addi\u00adtion\u00adal Ama\u00adzon\u00adian med\u00adi\u00adcine.

So (he\u2019ll) swim through and, in the last 20-25 metres, shut it down and make sure that you qualify for the final.\n\nCome second (and) let Laszlo Cseh from Hungary pass you. I had to insist that there was no medal in the semi-final. It was more important that he saved every bit of energy for the final. He listened and he did everything to perfection. George Bovell III (GB): I was preparing myself for the struggle of my life coming up, the 200 (metre) IM. I want to give you a quote, to describe how the 200m IM is. It\u2019s about holding up a heavy weight that gets heavier and heavier with every passing second, and it crushes you.\n\nYou\u2019re maintaining that impossible rhythm of exertion while executing mastery of technique, not one but all four strokes, and the transitions between the strokes. Total exhaustion must come long before the end of the race. You must have a really strong mind to force the body to hold on that rhythm and survive, to keep going, without drowning. That\u2019s what the 200m IM is all about.\n\nIn the heats, I really played it cool. In the semi-final, I\u2019m stacked up against a man I expect to beat to get a medal. Swimming is not only about physical condition, there is a lot of mind games that happen. I could have pushed and beat him. In the home leg, I slowed down and gave him a false sense of power over me, for him to feel like he broke (my spirit). I had to pull out all of the tricks in my book because my body was like 60 percent, because of my shoulder. That was a tactic that paid off well in the final.\n\nBovell III finished third in the second semi-final, in a time of two minutes 0.31 seconds, trailing Cseh (1:59.65) and Brazil\u2019s Thiago Pereira (2:00.07).\n\nAR: George qualified for the final, to be in lane two. We were going against Michael Phelps, (Ryan) Lochte and Cseh. In swimming, you have 25 minutes before the final where they\u2019ll go into a \u2018ready\u2019 room. Just before I was to send him down into the room, I was seeing nervousness. I tried different things but I had to be careful because, in a high-pressure situation, you don\u2019t want to add too much pressure because it will bring negative results. I just wasn\u2019t getting it.\n\n(Roberts called Bahamian swimmer Jeremy Knowles, his teammate at Auburn University). I said, \u2018I want you to talk to George, I need you to get him ready, he\u2019s looking a little nervous\u2019. Jeremy took aside and I went out of earshot. I saw Jeremy take out a marker that he had in his pocket and he drew something on the inside of his right bicep.\n\nWhatever he did, I saw this look of confidence, of self-esteem, of relaxation. George looked at me and I said, \u2018let\u2019s go\u2019. He went and had the swim of a lifetime.\n\nGB: This is everything that you wanted. You have a little voice that comes up in the back of your mind that tells you \u2018don\u2019t mess this up\u2019. Before the final, everyone must go into a room, a very small room where you wait about 20 minutes. It\u2019s very intense in this room. I was preparing myself since I had the injury, to lay my life on the line. A friend of mine came up to me and drew this hammer on my bicep.\n\nI had a reputation (and was) called the \u2018hammer of justice\u2019. If you\u2019re racing against somebody and you are very tired, and you know the other person is very tired too, and you speed up, even though you cannot sustain that acceleration, eventually what starts to happen is that the person you\u2019re racing against, who\u2019s looking over at you, they say \u2018whey boy, George he\u2019s fresh\u2019 and they eventually give up, and you break their spirit.\n\nWhen they have given up and drop back, then you can relax the pace. When you break somebody\u2019s spirit like that, in practice, that\u2019s called \u2018dropping the hammer of justice\u2019. I used to do this to people.\n\nAR: His normal freestyle split could have 28.16, it was 29.0, but it was still good enough to give him that bronze medal. Guess who he beat for the bronze medal? The very said Laszlo Cseh who, the day before, he had allowed him to pass. George made history, it was a proud effort. It was the hammer of justice which was drawn on his bicep by Knowles which brought him into the mental state of readiness, to perform. The hammer of justice represented how George used to train with his teammates when they were under pressure. George\u2019s father was the manager and I was the coach, we fell down in the pool deck, hugging up. All the countries were so happy because they love when small countries get on the podium because, in swimming, it\u2019s very rare. It was a great time and it still goes down in history as the greatest swimming moment for TT. I was so proud of George.\n\nGB: Even though my body was physically weak, I had competed in six races already. I had doubts about my physical strength. When (Knowles) drew that marker on me, it reminded me (that) my soul is strong, I am a warrior. I was ready to lay it all out. I had to pace it, I was physically weak, I was seventh after the first (part). In the backstroke I started to dig, started to put some energy and make up some ground.\n\nI felt so weak at the end of that backstroke and I couldn\u2019t believe this was happening in the final. I had a moment of weakness. In that moment of weakness comes the perfect excuse \u2013 the exhaustion, the injury. I was so tempted to take that excuse and just slow down. I didn\u2019t feel like how I hoped to feel in the Olympics final. I pushed through the pain and I kept accelerating.\n\n(Bovell III admitted that, during the turn and push-off for the breaststroke, he gained a lot of ground on his rivals).\n\nI started to push the breaststroke like a fire burning in my heart. I kept accelerating as if the end of the breaststroke was the end of the race.\n\nI moved up into second at the end of the breaststroke. Laszlo Cseh, the man next to me, I think he expected me to break. I kept my rhythm and it caused him to panic a little bit and lose his composure. I think it\u2019s because of the tactic I played in the semi-final gave me a psychological advantage over him.\n\nMy freestyle was not a strong as usual, so I kept pushing and pushing. An interesting thing happened, when I touched the wall, it showed me in second place and then the clock had me in third place, it switched places with Lochte and myself.\n\nSome people say America owns it because NBC has the tv rights, and a one-two America finish is good for the ratings. I came out of the ball with a headache, but a great sense of relief."}, {"url": "https://www.3wiresports.com/articles/tag/George+Bovell", "page_content": "BARCELONA -- If the men's 100 freestyle is the equivalent of a heavyweight fight, the 50 free is completely damn simple to understand. One lap. Raw power and speed. First one to the other side is the man. Thirteen years ago, two Americans, Anthony Ervin and Gary Hall Jr., tied for the gold medal at the Sydney Olympics in the 50 free, in a time of 21.8 seconds.\n\nIn what may have been the most loaded 50 free field ever, Brazil's Cesar's Cielo rocked it Saturday night at the Palau Sant Jordi in 21.32 seconds. Afterward, he cried -- and cried -- on the medals stand, the tears redemption after knee surgery and validation of his standing as one of the all-time sprint greats. The crowd roared.\n\nThe time, the field, the race, all of it underscored how swimming keeps getting better and better. Indeed, this 50 free produced a new star, Russia's Vlad Morozov, who won silver, in 21.47, even as it re-charged the career of one of the sport's leading lights, George Bovell of Trinidad & Tobago, who won bronze in 21.51, the island nation's first-ever world-championships medal.\n\nThe 50 free highlighted a day and night of extraordinary racing.\n\nAmerican Katie Ledecky, for instance, set another world-record, her second here, in winning the women's 800, in 8:13.86. She is so good that runner-up Lotte Friis of Denmark applauded as Ledecky got out of the pool.\n\nLedecky's 800 marked her fourth gold here in Barcelona. She also won the 400, 1500 and took part in the 4x200 relay. She took six seconds off the world-record in the 1500. Her 400 time was an American record.\n\nWhen she gets home, she hopes to get her driver's license.\n\n\"I am thrilled,\" she said. \"I exceeded my expectations for this year.\"\n\nHer roommate at these worlds, Simone Manuel, who turned 17 on Friday, grabbed the final spot in the women's 50 free final Sunday by swimming 24.91; she is the first 18-and-under swimmer in U.S. history to break 25 seconds.\n\nMissy Franklin won her fifth gold medal Saturday, in the 200 backstroke, her signature event, in 2:04.76. She is the first woman since Australia's Libby Trickett to win five gold medals at a world championships, and swims Sunday in the medley relay for a sixth.\n\nNo female swimmer has ever won six gold medals at a world championships. Franklin could join Michael Phelps, Mark Spitz and Kristin Otto of East Germany as the only swimmers to win as many as six golds at the worlds or the Olympics. Otto won six golds at the 1988 Seoul Games.\n\nAsked about six, Franklin said it would \"mean so much to me\" but cautioned about the medley, \"Like every single race here, we are going to have very tough competition.\"\n\nIn the morning heats, Russia's Yulia Efimova set a world record in the women's 50 breaststroke, 29.78. The record lasted until the evening -- when Lithuania's Ruta Meilutyte went 29.48 in the semifinals.\n\nThe world records in the women's 50, 100 and 200 have all fallen at these 2013 championships -- stunning, because the plastic suits from 2008-09 were said to have helped the breaststroke most of all. The women's 50 breaststroke final is set for Sunday evening.\n\nRyan Lochte, the day after winning two medals and setting a personal best in the 100 fly semifinals, finished sixth in the men's 100 fly. South Africa's Chad le Clos, closing in the second lap just the way Phelps used to, won in 51.06.\n\n\"I don't know if it had an effect, the triple last night, but I just didn't have it,\" Lochte said.\n\nCielo for sure had it.\n\nHe won his third straight world championships title in the 50 free -- this despite surgery on both knees after the Olympics, and not even racing the 100 free.\n\nThe eight lanes of this 50 free final held three Olympic champions: Ervin, from 2000; Cielo, 2008; France's Florent Manaudou, 2012.\n\nAll eight guys had an Olympic medal. In all, there were 14 medals among the group -- seven gold, four silver, four bronze. Five of the eight had an individual medal.\n\nTo illustrate how the race has developed -- owing to advances in strength-training, straight-arm freestyle technique, a change in the racing blocks themselves and other factors -- Ervin finished Saturday in 21.65.\n\nHe took sixth.\n\n\"It happens,\" he said, adding, \"I just felt incredible yesterday. Things were a little bit apart from that when I was going through my routine today. So, you know, I don't attribute it to much other than things didn't line up perfectly. I didn't get the strike. I got the spare. Whatever.\"\n\nNathan Adrian, the London 100 gold medalist, finished fourth, in 21.6.\n\nHe said, \"21.6 would medal at most international competitions but the 50 was really fast this year,\" adding, \"I have been saying this all week: training has become so specific for every single event. Vlad and I were the only ones who swam the 100 and the 50. Look at the results from 2000, and that's not going to be the same. It has become so specific. The more you specialize, the better you can become at any particular event.\"\n\nIn the semis, Manaudou had gone 21.37. He looked like the man to beat.\n\nInstead, the race was all about Lanes 6, 7 and 8 -- Cielo, Morozov and Bovell.\n\nCielo had gone 21.76 in the prelims, then 21.6 in the semis.\n\nBut, as Cielo said late Saturday, there's a big difference between swimming the 50 and sprinting the 50. He reminded himself to swim \"fast and long, fast and long,\" and that's what he did, keeping his head down. his stroke long: \"When I saw the scoreboard, I was ecstatic. I had no idea where I was.\"\n\nMorozov, 21, moved to Southern California from Siberia when he was 14. He ripped up the NCAA championships this year swimming for USC, taking down no less than Cielo's record in the 100-yard sprint, then turned pro. He turned in a 47.62 in the 100 at the Summer University Games a few weeks back.\n\nHere, in the 100, he went out in the first 50 in 21.94 -- the first sub-22 split, ever, in any major international final. He finished fifth, in 48.01. \"I wish I didn't go out as fast,\" he said ruefully.\n\nIn the 50 prelims, he went 21.95. The semis, 21.63.\n\nIn this race, there was no back half to worry about. Just 50 meters.\n\nMorozov's 21.47 is a new national record -- beating the mark he set in the semis. He set it in front of Alex Popov, the former Russian sprint star -- who gave out the medals Saturday night.\n\n\"I'm really stoked with these medals,\" Morozov said, proving that seven years in SoCal is plenty long enough to learn to talk like a native. He also won a bronze medal as part of the 4x100 relay.\n\nMorozov, noting that this was his first long-course championships at which he was swimming individual events, added a moment later, \"To come here and get a silver medal already with guys who were in my heat -- they were already Olympic champions, world champions \u2026 I am really stoked with that. In 2016 I will do my best so that no one will be close to me.\"\n\nSprinters, it must be noted, do not as a general rule lack for confidence.\n\n\"He's going to give us a lot of trouble in the next years,\" Cielo said of Morozov, smiling.\n\nBovell, meanwhile, won a bronze medal in the 200 IM -- behind Phelps and Lochte -- in Athens in 2004. After that, he hurt his knee and could no longer swim the breaststroke.\n\nHe re-made himself into a sprinter. He turned 30 two weeks ago and, as he said, \"To be honest, when you get to be my age, there is some pressure to grow up, so to speak.\" A trip to these worlds without a medal, he said, would have put pressure on him to stop swimming competitively.\n\nNow, he said, he intends to keep on through Rio. \"I love swimming,\" he said. \"I did not want to give it up.\""}, {"url": "https://teamtto.org/index.php/tto-athletes/rio-2016-team-tto/202-rio-2016-olympic-games-team-tto-delegation/swimming-men/2666-george-bovell-swimming", "page_content": "Historic 5th Olympic Games, Olympic Bronze Medalist, Greece, 2004; Former World Record Holder; Two-time World Championship Bronze Medalist; Six-time Pan Am Games Medalist (2 Gold, 2 Silver, 2 Bronze); Ten-time World Championship Finalist; 2nd Place Overall, 2012 FINA World Cup (7 gold, 9 silver); Five-time Individual NCAA Champion;\n\nSport: Swimming\n\nEvent: 50m Freestyle\n\nAge: 32\n\nD.O.B: 18/7/83\n\nHeight: 196m\n\nWeight: 93kg\n\nSocial Media: Twitter: @GeorgeBovell; FB: George Bovell"}, {"url": "https://www.guardian.co.tt/article-6.2.445209.7ac7a4f9a1", "page_content": "The name George Bovell III is one that is syn\u00adony\u00admous with ded\u00adi\u00adca\u00adtion, pa\u00adtri\u00ado\u00adtism and suc\u00adcess.

When asked about his ex\u00adpec\u00adta\u00adtions for the 2012 Olympic Games, the uni\u00adver\u00adsi\u00adty grad\u00adu\u00adate dis\u00adclosed that he hopes to come out vic\u00adto\u00adri\u00adous in the 50m freestyle event.

He told gieMAGAZINE that he start\u00aded swim\u00adming in his grand\u00admoth\u00ader's pool be\u00adfore he could even walk. As a young man he played foot\u00adball, crick\u00adet and ten\u00adnis and par\u00adtic\u00adi\u00adpat\u00aded in sail\u00ading and gym\u00adnas\u00adtics, still his heart was with the wa\u00adter and as a re\u00adsult he grav\u00adi\u00adtat\u00aded to\u00adwards swim\u00adming.

Er\u00adic Shanteau, Bovell in\u00addi\u00adcat\u00aded, is in\u00addeed his favourite. Shanteau pos\u00adsess\u00ades one of the most in\u00adspi\u00adra\u00adtional sto\u00adries and Bovell stressed that he ad\u00admires Shanteau great\u00adly for this. A good friend, for\u00admer room\u00admate and team\u00admate of Bovell, Shanteau is a Unit\u00aded States Olympian who bat\u00adtled with can\u00adcer and swam Olympic tri\u00adals. Bovell said that he \"be\u00adlieves that he (Shanteau) is one of the tough\u00adest hu\u00adman be\u00adings on the plan\u00adet.\" In\u00addeed this is an ad\u00admirable feat.\n\nNow that Bovell is train\u00ading for the 2012 Olympics he has quite a hec\u00adtic sched\u00adule. The de\u00adter\u00admined swim\u00admer swims twice on Mon\u00addays, Wednes\u00addays and Fri\u00addays and lifts weights on those days. On Tues\u00addays, Thurs\u00addays and Sat\u00adur\u00addays he swims once but ex\u00adtreme\u00adly hard.\n\nIn his lit\u00adtle spare time, he reads, does free div\u00ading, hangs out with friends and just tries to break out of the rou\u00adtine. His di\u00adet in\u00adcludes nat\u00adur\u00adal whole foods that are un\u00adprocessed and lots of fish; it is an over\u00adall healthy di\u00adet.

Bovell is also a two-time World Championship bronze medalist, a record five-time Olympian and is the Caribbean region's most successful swimmer.\n\nBovell is also respected for his voluntary philanthropic initiatives such as \"The World Swim Against Malaria and Drowning\" in Uganda, 2013, with his friend, Ugandan swimmer, Max Kanyarezi. He is known for organizing and conducting the annual \"George Bovell Dive In Free Swim Clinics\", that are free for the youth of Trinidad and Tobago who enjoy the privilege of being coached and mentored by renowned Olympic Medalist Swimmers from around the world. Bovell has been the writer of the popular inspirational newspaper column in the Trinidad Guardian entitled \"Reflections Off The Water\". He is also one of the World Economic Forum's Global Shapers from the Port of Spain hub. In addition to being a swimmer, Bovell is also a renowned freediving specialist, and enjoys under water wildlife videography and spearfishing.\n\nOlympic career\n\nGeorge Bovell represented Trinidad and Tobago at the 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016 Olympics. At the 2004 Olympics, he won a bronze medal in the men's 200 IM: the 9th medalist in the country's history and 12th medal overall. It was also the first-ever Olympic swimming medal for the country, and T&T's only medal from the 2004 Olympics.

Two-time Olympic bronze medalist for Russia, Arkady Vyatchanin (now most likely representing Serbia), Olympic gold medalist for South Africa Roland Schoeman, and World Champion New Zealander Moss Burmester joined the 2004-Olympic bronze medalist in the Caribbean for a series of free clinics using swimming as a platform to both benefit and excite young athletes.\n\nThe \u201cGeorge Bovell Dive In Free Swim Clinics 2015\u201d were held at facilities in St. James, Macoya and San Fernando over January 15-17th, with the prestigious athletes teaching training methods, skills and drills with the purpose of not only encouraging the young attendees within the sport of swimming, but by also offering up hope and inspiration as they interacted and collaborated with the participants.\n\nBovell tells SwimSwam that, \u201cthe clinics were a huge success; you all can\u2019t imagine what it meant to those kids. It\u2019s an initiative that I try to put on every year to give back to and hopefully grow the sport here. It also serves to get the youth \u2018thinking big\u2019 and to help them understand that, through hard work, anything is possible.\u201d\n\nTo that end, while in the midst of ramping up his own training en route to this year\u2019s Pan American Games and World Championships, Bovell is monitoring the construction of the George Bovell Aquatic Center* taking shape in Couva, Trinidad (*name is not yet official). With the building\u2019s completion targeted for June 2015, Bovell hopes the country can offer the facility to Olympic teams to use for their Rio 2016 staging camps, especially with Trinidad\u2019s temperatures and time zone not far off Rio\u2019s mark.\n\nThis vision falls directly in line with what Bovell describes as his short- and long-term mission for the sport of swimming in Trinidad and Tobago. \u201cIn the next five years, I would love to see Trinidad and Tobago hosting regional and international swimming events and have all schools offer learn-to-swim classes as part of their curriculum so that the number of unnecessary drowning deaths annually will be significantly reduced.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in the 90\u2019s and pushing through the age group ranks with what Bovell has previously described as limited knowledge, resources and opportunities, he now feels compelled to contribute to the overall improvement of swimming on all levels.

Juli 1983 in Port of Spain, Trinidad) ist ein Schwimmer aus Trinidad und Tobago. Er gewann f\u00fcr sein Land im Jahr 2004 eine olympische Bronzemedaille und ist damit bis heute der erfolgreichste karibische Schwimmsportler. Sein Schwimmtalent wurde ihm offenbar in die Wiege gelegt, sein Vater George war College-Schwimmer und seine Mutter eine Langstrecken-L\u00e4uferin, die bei den Olympischen Spielen 1972 und 1976 f\u00fcr Barbados und Kanada startete. Sein Bruder nahm als Schwimmer bei den Olympischen Spielen 2008 teil. Seinen ersten gro\u00dfen internationalen Erfolg konnte George Bovell bei den Schwimmweltmeisterschaften 2001 in Fukuoka feiern, wo er \u00fcber seine Spezialstrecke 200 m Lagen in 2:01,50 Minuten den vierten Platz erreichte. Zwei Jahre sp\u00e4ter bei den Schwimmweltmeisterschaften 2003 in Barcelona konnte er zwar seine Zeit \u00fcber diese Strecke auf 2:00,06 Minuten verbessern, dennoch reichte es dort nur f\u00fcr einen f\u00fcnften Platz. Bei den Panamerikanischen Spielen 2003 in Santo Domingo konnte er dann zweimal Gold \u00fcber 200 m Freistil und 200 m Lagen sowie zweimal Silber \u00fcber 100 m Freistil und 100 m R\u00fccken erringen. Damit erlangte er allein vier der sieben Medaillen f\u00fcr Trinidad und Tobago bei den Spielen und dabei die einzigen beiden Goldmedaillen. Bei den Olympischen Spielen 2004 in Athen holte er dann v\u00f6llig \u00fcberraschend mit einer Zeit von 1:58,80 Minuten die Bronzemedaille \u00fcber 200 m Lagen hinter den beiden US-Amerikanern Michael Phelps und Ryan Lochte. Von der Silbermedaille trennten ihn dabei gerade mal zwei Hundertstel Sekunden. Seine Medaille war f\u00fcr die Karibik die erste Medaille im Schwimmen bei Olympischen Spielen \u00fcberhaupt und die einzige f\u00fcr sein Land in Athen. Insgesamt war er der neunte Athlet, der f\u00fcr Trinidad und Tobago eine Medaille bei Olympischen Spielen holen konnte, die weiteren Medaillengewinner waren in der Leichtathletik und im Gewichtheben erfolgreich. Mit einer Zeit von 1:53,93 Minuten konnte er am 25. M\u00e4rz 2004 bei den NCAA-Meisterschaften 2004 in einen neuen Kurzbahn-Weltrekord \u00fcber 200 m Lagen aufstellen. Damit war Bovell der erste Schwimmer aus Trinidad und Tobago, der einen Weltrekord verbessern konnte. Der Rekord hielt etwa 20 Monate, bis er von dem Ungarn L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Cseh bei den Kurzbahneuropameisterschaften 2005 in Triest um 47 Hundertstel Sekunden unterboten wurde.

Bovell fell short of a berth in the finals after finishing sixth in his semifinal tonight, which was eventually won by Cesar Cielo Filho (21.34) of Brazil.\n\nEarlier this week, Bovell competed in the 100m freestyle semi-final, breaking the T&T national record, but did not qualify for the finals.\n\nDue to injury, Bovell was unable to compete in the event which won him a historic bronze medal in 2004: the 200m individual medley (IM). His 22-year-old younger brother, Nicholas, did compete in the 200m IM heats, clocking 2:03.90 and placing 36th overall.

It is crazy to think that I would have won any olympic in history with that time. Unfortunately times change and I am left with the opinion that this olympics is the greatest show in history and not the greatest sporting event.\n\nMeanwhile, Trinidad & Tobago\u2019s medal hopes continue tonight and tomorrow as Olympic Track and Field events commence."}, {"url": "https://www.3wiresports.com/articles/tag/George+Bovell", "page_content": "BARCELONA -- If the men's 100 freestyle is the equivalent of a heavyweight fight, the 50 free is completely damn simple to understand. One lap. Raw power and speed. First one to the other side is the man. Thirteen years ago, two Americans, Anthony Ervin and Gary Hall Jr., tied for the gold medal at the Sydney Olympics in the 50 free, in a time of 21.8 seconds.\n\nIn what may have been the most loaded 50 free field ever, Brazil's Cesar's Cielo rocked it Saturday night at the Palau Sant Jordi in 21.32 seconds. Afterward, he cried -- and cried -- on the medals stand, the tears redemption after knee surgery and validation of his standing as one of the all-time sprint greats. The crowd roared.\n\nThe time, the field, the race, all of it underscored how swimming keeps getting better and better. Indeed, this 50 free produced a new star, Russia's Vlad Morozov, who won silver, in 21.47, even as it re-charged the career of one of the sport's leading lights, George Bovell of Trinidad & Tobago, who won bronze in 21.51, the island nation's first-ever world-championships medal.\n\nThe 50 free highlighted a day and night of extraordinary racing.\n\nAmerican Katie Ledecky, for instance, set another world-record, her second here, in winning the women's 800, in 8:13.86. She is so good that runner-up Lotte Friis of Denmark applauded as Ledecky got out of the pool.\n\nLedecky's 800 marked her fourth gold here in Barcelona. She also won the 400, 1500 and took part in the 4x200 relay. She took six seconds off the world-record in the 1500. Her 400 time was an American record.\n\nWhen she gets home, she hopes to get her driver's license.\n\n\"I am thrilled,\" she said. \"I exceeded my expectations for this year.\"\n\nHer roommate at these worlds, Simone Manuel, who turned 17 on Friday, grabbed the final spot in the women's 50 free final Sunday by swimming 24.91; she is the first 18-and-under swimmer in U.S. history to break 25 seconds.\n\nMissy Franklin won her fifth gold medal Saturday, in the 200 backstroke, her signature event, in 2:04.76. She is the first woman since Australia's Libby Trickett to win five gold medals at a world championships, and swims Sunday in the medley relay for a sixth.\n\nNo female swimmer has ever won six gold medals at a world championships. Franklin could join Michael Phelps, Mark Spitz and Kristin Otto of East Germany as the only swimmers to win as many as six golds at the worlds or the Olympics. Otto won six golds at the 1988 Seoul Games.\n\nAsked about six, Franklin said it would \"mean so much to me\" but cautioned about the medley, \"Like every single race here, we are going to have very tough competition.\"\n\nIn the morning heats, Russia's Yulia Efimova set a world record in the women's 50 breaststroke, 29.78. The record lasted until the evening -- when Lithuania's Ruta Meilutyte went 29.48 in the semifinals.\n\nThe world records in the women's 50, 100 and 200 have all fallen at these 2013 championships -- stunning, because the plastic suits from 2008-09 were said to have helped the breaststroke most of all. The women's 50 breaststroke final is set for Sunday evening.\n\nRyan Lochte, the day after winning two medals and setting a personal best in the 100 fly semifinals, finished sixth in the men's 100 fly. South Africa's Chad le Clos, closing in the second lap just the way Phelps used to, won in 51.06.\n\n\"I don't know if it had an effect, the triple last night, but I just didn't have it,\" Lochte said.\n\nCielo for sure had it.\n\nHe won his third straight world championships title in the 50 free -- this despite surgery on both knees after the Olympics, and not even racing the 100 free.\n\nThe eight lanes of this 50 free final held three Olympic champions: Ervin, from 2000; Cielo, 2008; France's Florent Manaudou, 2012.\n\nAll eight guys had an Olympic medal. In all, there were 14 medals among the group -- seven gold, four silver, four bronze. Five of the eight had an individual medal.\n\nTo illustrate how the race has developed -- owing to advances in strength-training, straight-arm freestyle technique, a change in the racing blocks themselves and other factors -- Ervin finished Saturday in 21.65.\n\nHe took sixth.\n\n\"It happens,\" he said, adding, \"I just felt incredible yesterday. Things were a little bit apart from that when I was going through my routine today. So, you know, I don't attribute it to much other than things didn't line up perfectly. I didn't get the strike. I got the spare. Whatever.\"\n\nNathan Adrian, the London 100 gold medalist, finished fourth, in 21.6.\n\nHe said, \"21.6 would medal at most international competitions but the 50 was really fast this year,\" adding, \"I have been saying this all week: training has become so specific for every single event. Vlad and I were the only ones who swam the 100 and the 50. Look at the results from 2000, and that's not going to be the same. It has become so specific. The more you specialize, the better you can become at any particular event.\"\n\nIn the semis, Manaudou had gone 21.37. He looked like the man to beat.\n\nInstead, the race was all about Lanes 6, 7 and 8 -- Cielo, Morozov and Bovell.\n\nCielo had gone 21.76 in the prelims, then 21.6 in the semis.\n\nBut, as Cielo said late Saturday, there's a big difference between swimming the 50 and sprinting the 50. He reminded himself to swim \"fast and long, fast and long,\" and that's what he did, keeping his head down. his stroke long: \"When I saw the scoreboard, I was ecstatic. I had no idea where I was.\"\n\nMorozov, 21, moved to Southern California from Siberia when he was 14. He ripped up the NCAA championships this year swimming for USC, taking down no less than Cielo's record in the 100-yard sprint, then turned pro. He turned in a 47.62 in the 100 at the Summer University Games a few weeks back.\n\nHere, in the 100, he went out in the first 50 in 21.94 -- the first sub-22 split, ever, in any major international final. He finished fifth, in 48.01. \"I wish I didn't go out as fast,\" he said ruefully.\n\nIn the 50 prelims, he went 21.95. The semis, 21.63.\n\nIn this race, there was no back half to worry about. Just 50 meters.\n\nMorozov's 21.47 is a new national record -- beating the mark he set in the semis. He set it in front of Alex Popov, the former Russian sprint star -- who gave out the medals Saturday night.\n\n\"I'm really stoked with these medals,\" Morozov said, proving that seven years in SoCal is plenty long enough to learn to talk like a native. He also won a bronze medal as part of the 4x100 relay.\n\nMorozov, noting that this was his first long-course championships at which he was swimming individual events, added a moment later, \"To come here and get a silver medal already with guys who were in my heat -- they were already Olympic champions, world champions \u2026 I am really stoked with that. In 2016 I will do my best so that no one will be close to me.\"\n\nSprinters, it must be noted, do not as a general rule lack for confidence.\n\n\"He's going to give us a lot of trouble in the next years,\" Cielo said of Morozov, smiling.\n\nBovell, meanwhile, won a bronze medal in the 200 IM -- behind Phelps and Lochte -- in Athens in 2004. After that, he hurt his knee and could no longer swim the breaststroke.\n\nHe re-made himself into a sprinter. He turned 30 two weeks ago and, as he said, \"To be honest, when you get to be my age, there is some pressure to grow up, so to speak.\" A trip to these worlds without a medal, he said, would have put pressure on him to stop swimming competitively.\n\nNow, he said, he intends to keep on through Rio. \"I love swimming,\" he said. \"I did not want to give it up.\""}, {"url": "https://swimswam.com/george-bovell-lowers-50-breast-national-record-at-belgian-open-championships/", "page_content": "The 2015 Belgian Open Championships are underway in Antwerp, Belgium, and Trinidad & Tobago\u2019s George Bovell is making head lines.\n\nThe 31 year old is currently training in Italy and it is paying off.

The 29-year-old four-time Olympian is solely focused on the 50 at these games after winning his country\u2019s first swimming medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics in the 200 individual medley. The former Auburn swimmer once owned the 200 IM world record.\n\nCielo finished the furious one-lap sprint in 21.80, with teammate Bruno Fratus third at 21.82. Cielo had a quick turnaround after finishing sixth in the 100 free a night earlier.\n\nPOST\u2019S OLYMPIC COVERAGE\n\n\u201cIt was hard to sleep last night after the race because the final was so late,\u201d Cielo said. \u201cThis morning I was more concerned about making enough of an effort to get back. It\u2019s a matter of resting now to make sure I get a spot in the final.\u201d\n\nAnthony Ervin of the U.S. was fourth at 21.83 in his return to the Olympics after a 12-year absence.

I was like, \u2018Ahhhh.\u2019 Twelve years ago was a long time ago.

He wasn't performing up to his or our (the Auburn coaches) standards up to this point,\" Auburn coach David Marsh said. \"But he stepped up tonight and got the job done. He was fighting tooth and nail with Cseh and was able to out-touch him at the wall.\"\n\n\"I hope this success will improve swimming in Trinidad and Tobago and I hope it will encourage the government to improve the swimming facilities,\" Bovell said.\n\nThe medal is Trinidad and Tobago's first in international swimming competition.\n\n\"George is really relieved right now,\" Marsh said. \"The weight that he and his nation put on his shoulders is now gone.\"\n\nJust prior to his swim, the contingent of Auburn swimmers and divers in Athens surrounded Bovell and reminded him to think like it was a SEC or NCAA meet and that he was in Athens as a part of the Auburn team.\n\nPhelps won the event with an Olympic record time of 1:57.14 while Lochte took the silver with a 1:58.78.\n\nAlso on Thursday, Kirsty Coventry and Margaret Hoelzer advanced into the finals of the women's 200-meter backstroke.
