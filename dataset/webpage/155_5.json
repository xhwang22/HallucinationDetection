Name variations: Madame de Gaulle. Born Yvonne Charlotte Anne-Marie Vendroux (pronunciation: Vahn-DROO) on May 22, 1900, in the family home in Calais, on the Channel coast of France; died on November 8, 1979, in the military hospital Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce, Paris; daughter of Jacques Vendroux (the head of a biscuit manufacturing company) and Marguerite (Forest) Vendroux; received primary and secondary education largely with private tutors at home; spent several years at a primary school, Notre-Dame in Calais; married Charles de Gaulle, on April 7, 1921 (a civil ceremony took place the previous day but it was the religious ceremony held April 7 that was regarded as their wedding by the de Gaulles); children: Philippe (b. December 28, 1921); Elisabeth de Boissieu (b. May 15, 1924); Anne de Gaulle (January 1, 1928\u2013February 6, 1948).\n\nChildhood years spent in family home in Calais; at age five, began primary education with private tutors (1905); as German forces advanced toward Calais at outset of WWI, Vendroux family took refuge in England (July\u2013August 1914); family returned to Calais (December 1914); cared for war wounded in Calais (1915\u201316); left Calais, under threat of German bombs, for safety in Paris (1916); as renewed German offensive threatened Paris (March 1918), sent out of harm's way to Mortagne, Brittany, then Perigueux (summer and autumn, 1918); worked with mother among the wounded war veterans in Calais (1919\u201320); met Charles de Gaulle (October 1920); after marriage, lived together in Paris (1921); moved with Charles, who was promoted to major and placed in charge of 19th Battalion of Light Infantry in Trier, Germany (1927); moved with family to Beirut (then in Syria, a French mandate of the League of Nations, now Lebanon), where Charles was posted (1929); returned to Paris (1931); purchased La Boisserie, an estate in the village of Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises, in the Haute-Marne department in eastern France (June 9, 1934); based in Metz where Charles commanded the 507th Tank Regiment (1937); outbreak of WWII (September 1, 1939); Germans entered Paris (June 14, 1940); de Gaulle family left France for London (June 17) where Charles' first BBC radio broadcast back to France called for resistance against Germany (June 18); moved to join Charles in liberated Algiers (July 1943); Allied invasion of Normandy (June 6, 1944); rejoined Charles, now head of the Provisional Government, in Neuilly, near Paris (September 1944); Charles resigned as head of the Provisional Government (January, 1946); moved back into La Boisserie(May 1946); death of daughter Anne, caused by pneumonia (February 6, 1948); returned to Paris with re-call of Charles to power during Algerian crisis (June 1, 1958); became \"first lady\" of France upon the inauguration of Charles as first president of the Fifth Republic (January 8, 1959); narrowly survived an assassination attempt in the company of her husband (August 22, 1962); retired to La Boisserie after referendum defeat of de Gaulle (April 1969); death of Charles de Gaulle (November 9, 1970).\n\nOn August 22, 1962, in the Paris suburb of Petit-Clamart, en route from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace to the town of Villacoublay, the French presidential car was ambushed by a commando who fired some 150 shots from automatic weapons. Fourteen bullets struck the car in which Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle, their son-in-law Alain de Boissieu, and the driver Francis Marroux were riding, on their way for a weekend at the presidential retreat in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. No one was hit. The Petit-Clamart attack was but the closest call in a series of assassination attempts by groups opposed to Charles de Gaulle's ceding of independence to the rebellious colony of Algeria. The general, at least according to some accounts, had been too proud even to drop to the floor during the fusillade, and, even though a bullet passed between their heads, Yvonne de Gaulle had also remained seated erect during the attack. Upon their arrival at Villacoublay, the general turned to his wife and said: \"Yvonne, you are brave.\"\n\nYvonne de Gaulle's behavior during and after the Petit-Clamart assassination attempt typified the stoicism, courage, and fidelity that characterized her entire adult life and for which she is remembered in France. Years after her death, President Richard Nixon remembered her having said in 1969, \"the presidency is temporary, the family permanent.\" The product of a middle-class Catholic family from Calais, in Normandy, Yvonne de Gaulle exemplified the \"dutiful wife and mother,\" silent in public but influential behind the scenes. Deeply religious and private, she kept to herself whatever complaints she might have had living with the self-assured and frequently cantankerous Charles de Gaulle. She lived so privately that, even as first lady in France during the 1960s, she was able to shop in Parisian stores without being recognized. Although her role came increasingly into question in the France of the 1960s, she nonetheless came to be respected in France as \"Tante Yvonne\" (Aunt Yvonne), during the presidency of her husband.\n\nThe daughter of Jacques and Marguerite Vendroux , Yvonne Vendroux was born on May 22, 1900, in the family home in Calais, on the Channel coast of France. Her father, who had gone into the biscuit-producing business, came from a long line of shipowners and local mayors and was himself vice president of the Chamber of Commerce, a municipal councilor, and the honorary consul of several foreign countries. He was, in French terms, a \"notable,\" or local dignitary. His family, the Van Droog, tobacco producers, had moved in the late 17th century from Delft in Holland to Dunkirk, where the name was changed to Vandroux; later the family moved to Calais, where the name was changed to Vendroux. Yvonne's mother, Marguerite Forest Vendroux, was the granddaughter of a well-known notary of the town of Charleville.\n\nMadame de Gaulle's importance was considerable not for what she said or did but for what she neither did nor said, by her silent presence. \u2014Andr\u00e9 Malraux\n\nYvonne Vendroux had a happy and stable childhood. Raised amid comfortable circumstances, the second of four children, she spent her early years with her family, in Calais in the winter and in a country estate in the Ardennes during the summer, where she went mountain climbing and developed a lifelong love of nature, especially flowers. Most of her schooling took place in the form of home tutoring. Dubious about the quality of the local schools after the 1905 separation of church and state in France, Yvonne's parents hired a tutor, Mademoiselle Delannoy , for her primary education. After 1907, she was sent for awhile as a day student to the local Notre-Dame boarding school, but her parents retained the tutor to supplement their daughter's education. Her secondary school education took place entirely at home.\n\nYvonne's first communion, in 1911, was followed by three relatively carefree years, broken with the onset of World War I in August 1914. As German forces advanced toward Calais and bombs fell on the town early in the war, the Vendroux family took refuge in Kent, in southern England. By the end of 1914, when it had become clear that the French forces would hold and Calais would be safe from German invasion, the Vendroux family returned. There, Yvonne's activities continued to revolve around the home as her mother cared for wounded war veterans. In 1916, seeking greater security, the family again left Calais for Paris, where Yvonne remained until March 1918, when a renewed German offensive led the family to send her and her sister Suzanne to Brittany. Now 18, Yvonne next went to Perigueux, where she spent the final days of World War I. With the end of the war, the Vendroux family turned to the restoration of their various properties in the Calais and Ardennes areas. Yvonne assumed an increasing role in household management, allowing her mother to continue to work in veterans' hospitals. Her older brother Jacques accompanied her as chaperon to the parties and balls in Paris and Calais. Yvonne soon joined her mother working among the war wounded, widows, and orphans.\n\nIn October 1920, at a tea arranged by family friends, Yvonne met Captain Charles de Gaulle, then on a brief leave from service with the French military mission in Poland. Shortly thereafter, he invited her to a ball at Saint-Cyr, the French military academy. Taken with Charles, Yvonne accepted and went in the company of Jacques. A few days later, asked directly about her feelings toward Charles, Yvonne replied, \"It will be he or no one.\" The families met, and the couple was officially affianced on November 11, 1920. Charles had to return for two additional months' service in Poland, then returned to France in February. He was named professor of history at Saint-Cyr, a post that would keep him in Paris.\n\nYvonne Vendroux and Charles de Gaulle were married in a civil ceremony in Calais on April 6, 1921, and in a religious ceremony the next day at the Notre-Dame Church in that city. Following their marriage, the young couple settled in a modest Paris apartment and lived a relatively quiet life. Their son Philippe was born at the end of 1921. In 1924, their second child, Elizabeth, was born. Charles finished his studies at the War College, published his first book, La Discorde chez l'Ennemi (Discord in the Enemy), and was posted as an officer working with Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain, the hero of World War I, with whose career his own would be dramatically crossed. In 1927, Yvonne de Gaulle joined her husband in a posting in Trier, Germany, where in 1928, their daughter Anne was born. Within months of Anne's birth, it had become clear that she was suffering from Down's syndrome. Anne was never to speak well or eat or dress unaided. Her illness was the great personal tragedy of the de Gaulles who cared for her tenderly.\n\nIn 1929, the de Gaulles were sent to Beirut, Lebanon, then part of French-controlled Syria, where they remained until 1931. In 1932, Yvonne's father died; her mother died the following year. At the end of 1933, Charles de Gaulle was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In June 1934, the de Gaulles bought \"La Boisserie,\" the estate of Yvonne's late parents, located in the village of Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises, in the gently rolling hills of the Haute-Marne department about midway between Paris and France's eastern frontier. The year 1934 also saw the publication of Charles' second book, Vers l'arm\u00e9e de m\u00e9tier (The Army of the Future), which argued, to little avail, that the French should adopt new mechanized forms of warfare. In 1937, Charles was given the command of the 507th Tank Regiment based in Metz. Life for the de Gaulle family revolved quietly around Paris, Metz, and La Boisserie.\n\nYvonne's domain was the family home at La Boisserie, her place of refuge from the turbulent political affairs surrounding her husband. She quietly endured the tragedy of Anne's disabilities while living with a man who was very much a lone rebel in political and military circles during the 1930s, and who clearly ruled as master of the household. Known for his arrogance, Charles was said to be a tyrant at home, with Yvonne silently bearing the brunt of his disappointment and frustration. Charles dominated conversations; Yvonne was told plainly, and sometimes publicly, that her opinion did not count. On more than one occasion Charles was observed telling his wife to be silent, that she could not possibly know anything about politics. Years later, an acquaintance said that compared to the cheerful if somewhat reticent young woman who had married Charles in 1921, the Yvonne of the late 1930s was profoundly sad.\n\nThe outbreak of war with Nazi Germany in September 1939 found Charles in command of his tank regiment. Poland was quickly crushed by the Germans, but the war with France involved little actual fighting in what became known as the dr\u00f4le de guerre, or phony war. This changed with the German thrust westward of May 10, 1940. The force of the German onslaught was such that, within days, Charles was writing from the front to Yvonne at La Boisserie, warning her to be ready for quick flight in the event that the military situation turned disastrous. On June 1, Charles was promoted to brigadier-general. Five days later, he was appointed undersecretary of state for National Defense and War by Premier Paul Reynaud. The Germans entered Paris on June 14. On June 16, the Reynaud government was replaced by one headed by Marshal P\u00e9tain, who was committed to seeking peace with the Germans. A day later, Yvonne with her three children and their governess left for England to join her husband, a political exile.\n\nFor the second time in her life, Yvonne de Gaulle experienced wartime exile in England. On June 18, Charles broadcast back to France, calling on the entire nation to resist the Germans and any French authority that supported collaboration with them. In London, their son Philippe, then 18 years old, joined the newly created Free French Navy in July. In addition to the occupation of her homeland, Yvonne had to accept the fact that her husband was now a rebel, standing almost alone against his country's legal government, which was headed by World War I hero and his own former sponsor, Marshal P\u00e9tain. Moreover, P\u00e9tain sentenced Charles to death in absentia for wartime desertion and treason. Yvonne set up a household in London as he organized what became the Free French resistance to Nazi Germany and the government of Vichy France. Whatever his other activities in wartime London, Charles was invariably present to tell Anne stories at her bedtime and to shield her from the press.\n\nTogether with other Londoners, Yvonne endured the German Blitz or air raids in the summer and fall of 1940, but ultimately her faith in her husband's vision was rewarded; the fortunes of war turned with the entry of the Soviet Union and the United States into combat against the Nazis. Following the liberation of French North Africa, the de Gaulle family returned to Algiers in June 1943. The liberation of metropolitan France, which began with the D-Day landings in Normandy, June 6, 1944, left the country under the Free French, reorganized as a Provisional Government and headed by Charles de Gaulle. In late August, Paris was liberated and by the end of September, almost all of metropolitan France had been cleared of Germans. Yvonne, now the wife of the leader of the Provisional Government, returned home to supervise the reconstruction of La Boisserie, which had been pillaged and partially burned during the Occupation. Charles, however, became increasingly dispirited as the politicians who had dominated prewar politics and, in his view, had brought on the catastrophe of 1940, regained strength, promising to recreate what he called the \"regime of parties.\" On January 3, 1946, a few weeks after the marriage of daughter Elisabeth to Commander Alain de Boissieu, Charles abruptly resigned his position. The family lived until May in an uncomfortable house rented from the government while La Boisserie was being restored and Charles waited restlessly to be recalled to power.\n\nIn 1946, with the help of Georges Pompidou, who later served as one of Charles' prime ministers and was to become his successor as president, the de Gaulles established the Anne de Gaulle Foundation to help handicapped girls. The Foundation was to care for Anne in the event that her parents predeceased her. Supported financially by the income from Charles' books, the Foundation built a house on a wooded hill in the Chevreuse valley. Staffed by six nuns and a mother superior, the house eventually provided for some 40 handicapped girls. Yvonne helped select them.\n\nIn April 1947, Charles created the Rassemblement du Peuple Fran\u00e7ais (Rally of the French People), a political party that was to serve as a vehicle for his return to power. Then, on February 6, 1948, Anne died of bronchial pneumonia at age 20. With the death of Anne, the Anne de Gaulle Foundation occupied much of Yvonne's attention. She also accompanied Charles throughout France as he campaigned for his new RPF, but by 1952, the party was fading and he ended it the next year. These years were spent, often with their grandchildren, at La Boisserie where Charles worked on his memoirs, with occasional trips abroad where he was received as the hero of the wartime French Resistance. To visitors at La Boisserie, Yvonne occasionally expressed the desire to protect her husband \"for history,\" and keep him out of politics. The tranquil life was interrupted, however, when the government's inability to suppress the Algerian rebellion led to rioting by European Algerians in the streets of Algiers on May 13, 1958. La Boisserie was quickly turned into a command post as Charles and his advisors planned his return to office. On June 1, Charles de Gaulle was voted in as premier by the National Assembly with full powers to write a new constitution for France. The result was France's Fifth Republic, with a much stronger presidency, filled in 1959 by Charles de Gaulle.\n\nOnce again, Yvonne de Gaulle was a reluctant first lady of France. During the early 1960s, Charles survived several assassination attempts by opponents of independence for Algeria. The closest call was the Petit-Clamart fusillade in 1962. Profiting by the wave of sympathy engendered by the assassination attempt, Charles proposed a constitutional change to elect the president by universal suffrage, which was approved by popular referendum in October. In 1965, against Yvonne's will, he stood as a candidate for the presidency. Forced into a runoff with Socialist candidate Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, Charles was elected in the second round to a seven-year term.\n\nTo many in 1960s France, \"Aunt Yvonne\" came to represent the wife of a previous era. She accompanied Charles to innumerable Paris Opera galas, where she sat through close to 30 performances of \"Carmen,\" and hosted the Kennedys, Khrushchevs, and many other world leaders. The comparison of the prim and somewhat dowdy Yvonne, who scrupulously supervised the household affairs of France's presidential \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, with the youthful and fashionable Jacqueline Kennedy , who accompanied her husband, then president of the United States, on a visit to Paris in 1961, was played out in the international press. Wearing sedate black, gray, or mauve dresses designed by Paris couturier Jacques Heim, Yvonne avoided d\u00e9colletage and shunned the more up-to-date fashions of Coco Chanel . Yvonne's successor as France's first lady, Claude Pompidou , recalled later that Yvonne's only advice to her had been to wear hats. Yvonne arranged the floral decorations of the palace, and she loved to travel and accompany her husband on all his official trips abroad, but whenever possible, she returned\n\nto La Boisserie and the gardens that were her favorite pastime.\n\nA strict Catholic, Yvonne set an austere tone at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, making sure the private lives of those in her husband's entourage passed moral muster. Exerting a considerable, if private, influence, she saw to it that divorcees were weeded out of influential positions and excluded from presidential social functions. She was equally severe in her judgments of much of the literature and film of the 1960s and carefully scrutinized the selection of films to be shown in the palace. For her religious devotions, she had a special chapel built inside the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.\n\nYvonne was with Charles when, during the height of the student and worker unrest of May 1968, he traveled to Baden-Baden to consult with French generals about the possibility of his resigning. She shared his disappointment, when, in April 1969, in a referendum he had called on behalf of decentralizing political reforms, he was defeated. Having staked his political prestige on the referendum, Charles immediately resigned. The couple returned to La Boisserie, where on November 9, 1970, Charles died. Yvonne continued to live there, where she cooked, knitted, and tended her garden, visited often by her children and four grandchildren until the fall of 1978, when she withdrew to the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception convent in Paris. In July 1979, she was operated on in Paris for an intestinal obstruction. Readmitted to a Paris military hospital, she died November 8, 1979. She was buried beside Charles and Anne at the church cemetery in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. Surviving Yvonne, in addition to her son Philippe and daughter Elisabeth, were her grandchildren and one great-grandson. Mourned as the symbol of moral rectitude and marital fidelity of a long gone era, \"Tante Yvonne\" was called the \"minister of common sense\" in the government of General Charles de Gaulle. Following her death, La Boisserie, which remained in the possession of Philippe, was converted into a museum, open to the public, in honor of the de Gaulles.\n\nsources:\n\nB\u00e9liard, Jean. \"Entretien avec Richard Nixon,\" in Institut Charles de Gaulle.

She spent much of her life in poor health.\n\nKnow about Queen Anne, monarch of Great Britain and Ireland See all videos for this article\n\nAnne, (born February 6, 1665, London, England\u2014died August 1, 1714, London), queen of Great Britain and Ireland from 1702 to 1714 who was the last Stuart monarch. She wished to rule independently, but her intellectual limitations and chronic ill health caused her to rely heavily on her ministers, who directed England\u2019s efforts against France and Spain in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701\u201314). The bitter rivalries between Whigs and Tories that characterized her reign were intensified by uncertainty over the succession to her throne.\n\nAnne was the second daughter of James, duke of York (King James II, 1685\u201388), and Anne Hyde. Although her father was a Roman Catholic, she was reared a Protestant at the insistence of her uncle, King Charles II. In 1683 Anne was married to the handsome, if uninspiring, Prince George of Denmark (1653\u20131708), who became her devoted companion. Of greater political consequence was Anne\u2019s intimate relationship with her childhood friend Sarah Jennings Churchill, wife of John Churchill (later 1st duke of Marlborough). The beautiful, intelligent Sarah became Anne\u2019s lady of the bedchamber and soon had the princess in her power.\n\nBritannica Quiz Fit for a King (or Queen): the British Royalty Quiz\n\nIt was Sarah who persuaded Anne to side with the Protestant ruler William III of Orange, stadtholder of the Netherlands, when William overthrew James II in 1688. By the Bill of Rights (1689), William and his wife, Mary, Anne\u2019s elder sister, were made king and queen of England, and Anne was placed in line for the succession to the throne. Anne and Mary had a bitter falling-out, and after Mary\u2019s death in 1694 William cultivated Anne\u2019s goodwill, but he refused to appoint her regent during his absences from England.\n\nAlthough Anne was pregnant 18 times between 1683 and 1700, only five children were born alive, and, of these, only one, a son, survived infancy. His death in 1700 ended Anne\u2019s hopes of providing herself and the three kingdoms (England, Scotland, and Ireland) with a successor. Hence, she acquiesced to the Act of Settlement of 1701, which designated as her successors the Hanoverian descendants of King James I of England, through his daughter Elizabeth.\n\nAnne became queen upon William\u2019s death in March 1702. From the first she was motivated largely by an intense devotion to the Anglican church. She detested Roman Catholics and Dissenters and sympathized with High Church Tories. At the same time, she sought to be free from the domination of the political parties. Her first ministry, though predominantly Tory, was headed by two neutrals, Sidney Godolphin and the duke of Marlborough. The influence of Sarah Churchill (now duchess of Marlborough) over Anne was slight after 1703, though the duke remained commander of the British forces.\n\nAnne soon discovered that she disagreed with the Tories on strategy for the war. The queen, Marlborough, and the Whigs wanted to commit English troops to Continental campaigns, while the Tories believed England should engage the enemy principally at sea. Consequently, as Marlborough accumulated impressive victories on the Continent, pressure was exerted on Anne to admit Whigs to the ministry. She resisted obstinately and even grew cold toward the duchess, who adopted the cause of the Whig politicians. By 1707 the duchess had been supplanted in the queen\u2019s affections by Abigail Masham, the tool of the leading Tory, Robert Harley (later 1st earl of Oxford). Nevertheless, the schemes of Harley and Masham caused Anne so much embarrassment that in 1708 she was forced to dismiss Harley and admit the most prominent Whigs into her administration. As the war dragged on, the nation turned against the Whigs. In 1710 Anne was able to expel them and appoint a Tory ministry. She dismissed both Marlboroughs from her service in 1711.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Under the Asiento de negros, Britain was entitled to supply those colonies with 4,800 African slaves per year for 30 years. The contract for this supply was assigned to the South Sea Company, of which Anne held some 22.5 percent of the stock.\n\nThe queen\u2019s advancing age and her infirmities made the succession a crucial issue. Leading Tories were in constant communication with Anne\u2019s exiled Roman Catholic half brother, James, the Old Pretender, who had been excluded by law from the succession. Nevertheless, the suddenness of Anne\u2019s final illness and death frustrated any plans the Tories might have had for capturing the throne for the Pretender. Her last act was to secure the Protestant succession by placing the lord treasurer\u2019s staff in the hands of a capable moderate, Charles Talbot, duke of Shrewsbury, who presided over the peaceful accession of the Hanoverian prince George Louis (King George I, 1714\u201327)."}, {"url": "https://www.catholicworldreport.com/2017/04/26/a-fathers-love-the-story-of-charles-and-anne/", "page_content": "In World War II, Charles de Gaulle saved France\u2019s honor from the shame of defeat.

This follows a 2016 ruling by France\u2019s Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat endorsing a broadcasting tribunal\u2019s 2014 decision to prohibit a commercial portraying Down Syndrome children as joyful individuals loved by their parents because it might distress those who chose to terminate an unborn disabled child.\n\nReflecting upon these developments, I couldn\u2019t help thinking how much France owes to one particular Down Syndrome child: a young girl who struggled to speak, needed assistance to walk, and who died of pneumonia at the age of 20 cradled in her father\u2019s arms. Anne de Gaulle\u2019s father, however, was no ordinary man.\n\nCharles de Gaulle was surely the twentieth century\u2019s greatest Frenchman. Yet for all his achievements, the ultimate drama of de Gaulle\u2019s life was his helpless daughter. What Anne gave to him, however, was immeasurable. As de Gaulle confided to a priest at the beginning of his lonely crusade in 1940 to save France\u2019s honor, \u201cfor me, this child is a grace, she is my joy, she helps me to look beyond all the failures and honors, and always to look higher.\u201d\n\nUn enfant pas comme les autres\n\nCharles de Gaulle was an austere individual, one who consciously cultivated distance from others. 47 years after his death, however, we know much more about the private man. Thanks to the publication of memoirs, especially those of his son Admiral Philippe de Gaulle, the General emerges as a man who, like many French army officers of his background, found solace in his Catholic faith and a closely-knit family. We\u2019re also discovered that de Gaulle had a rich intellectual life which went far beyond politics. This went hand-in-hand with a wicked sense of humor which, in private, de Gaulle wasn\u2019t averse to using against himself.\n\nBy the time he reached his mid-30s, de Gaulle had settled into a milieu in which his faith, family and profession provided many of the certainties required for an ambitious man intent upon shaking up a political and military establishment committed to obsolete ideas. All this was shattered on 1 January 1928 when Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle\u2019s third child was born. Within a few months, it became apparent that Anne was severely disabled.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that this was an era in which disabled children were neither seen nor heard in polite company. Down Syndrome children were referred to as \u201cmongols.\u201d Some even speculated that the condition resulted from alcoholism or some form of impropriety on the parents\u2019 part. It wasn\u2019t until 30 years after Anne de Gaulle\u2019s birth that another devout French Catholic, Professor Jerome Lejeune, and his research team discovered that Down Syndrome was caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21.\n\nIn the 1930s, it was common for French families to place disabled children permanently in hospitals that were woefully ill-equipped to care them. Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle, however, refused to send Anne to live with, as he would say, \u201cstrangers.\u201d In de Gaulle\u2019s words, \u201cGod has given her to us. We must take responsibility for her, wherever she is and whatever she will be.\u201d In a way, de Gaulle\u2019s reaction to Anne\u2019s entry into his life foreshadowed the spirit of resistance expressed in his famous appeal of 18 June 1940 to Frenchmen to continue the war against Germany.\n\nThe de Gaulles worked hard to build a place for, to use de Gaulle\u2019s expression, \u201ca child who is not like the others\u201d in their family. From all accounts, Yvonne de Gaulle adopted a matter-of-fact approach. She focused on the practicalities of caring for a disabled child. Charles de Gaulle\u2019s contribution was to envelop Anne in a web of affection. According to his son, de Gaulle wanted to give Anne the assurance that he loved her just as much as her older brother and sister\u2014that her disability meant nothing to him.\n\nThe tall army officer infamous for his air of haughty disdain as leader of Free France during World War II and later as French President didn\u2019t hesitate to unbend to play on the floor with Anne. De Gaulle sang to Anne, told her stories, and even allowed her to play with one of his most treasured possessions: his officer\u2019s kepi hat. De Gaulle also said prayers with Anne in the evening. Painstakingly, she would repeat each word after her father. \u201cYou see,\u201d de Gaulle proudly informed his relatives, \u201cshe knows her prayers!\u201d\n\nWhen away on army business, de Gaulle constantly inquired about Anne\u2019s well-being. On one occasion, Anne had an operation while he was absent on maneuvers. De Gaulle telephoned incessantly to ask if she was in pain, whether the procedure had succeeded, what the doctors were saying, etc. Anne seems to have been aware of just how much she meant to her father. Her first governess recalled that Anne adored him and would be visibly upset when his responsibilities took de Gaulle away from his family.\n\nThough the de Gaulles valued their privacy, they didn\u2019t view Anne as an embarrassment. There are pictures of her standing awkwardly with members of the de Gaulles\u2019 extended family. Most striking, however, is a photo of Anne taken at a beach in Brittany in 1933. She is sitting on her father\u2019s lap. He, dressed in a homburg hat and three-piece suit, gently holds her hands as the five year-old girl looks intensely into her father\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s an image of unconditional love.\n\nWhile Anne lived, the de Gaulles took her everywhere with them. That included less-than-hospitable locations such as the French mandate in Syria and Lebanon. De Gaulle was posted there in 1929, partly because some of his superiors wanted to sideline an officer who asked awkward questions about France\u2019s readiness for the next war. There was, however, no question of leaving Anne behind. Instead she went with them, with the de Gaulles hiring a full-time governess to help them care for Anne in a Middle-Eastern country.\n\nFragility\u2014and Resistance\u2014in the face of Evil\n\nThere was, of course, a cost to all this. Though Charles de Gaulle came from a minor aristocratic family and his wife from an upper-middle class background, the de Gaulles were not wealthy. His modest army pay was their main source of income. Hiring full-time help was subsequently an enormous financial liability, but one they didn\u2019t hesitate to assume.\n\nThen there was the psychological burden. As Yvonne de Gaulle\u2019s biographer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Neau-Dufour observes, Yvonne was an exuberant, even care-free young woman before Anne was born. After Anne\u2019s birth, that woman gradually disappeared. Yvonne became a much quieter, even somewhat withdrawn person who dreaded public appearances. This, however, didn\u2019t stop her from undertaking the extremely difficult task of successfully fleeing France with the profoundly disabled Anne in tow as the German Army swept across the country in May and June 1940.\n\nThis brings into focus another factor of which Charles de Gaulle was undoubtedly aware: how the National Socialist regime treated the disabled. Eugenics was part and parcel of the Nazi view of the world (and most Western liberal opinion for decades). And, as the Nazis made clear right from the beginning, the disabled had no place in a National Socialist world. They were lebensunwertes leben (life unworthy of life).\n\nStarting in September 1939, the Nazi government began removing Down Syndrome children and infants suffering from other disabilities from their parents. These children were taken to \u201chealth facilities\u201d and killed by lethal injection or gas poisoning. In the name of \u201cracial health\u201d and other eugenics nonsense, the regime murdered thousands of disabled children. Among them was a 15 year-old Down Syndrome cousin of the future pope, Joseph Ratzinger.\n\nThis would have been Anne de Gaulle\u2019s fate if she had ever fallen into Nazi hands. Although de Gaulle never referenced it specifically, it\u2019s likely that the brutal treatment of the disabled was one of the things he had in mind when referring to the evil of the Nazi regime. When de Gaulle refused to surrender in 1940 and was branded a traitor by France\u2019s political and military elites, it was certainly the act of an intensely patriotic man unwilling to accept his country\u2019s abasement by the Nazis. But de Gaulle\u2019s act of resistance also concerned safeguarding his defenseless daughter from those who viewed her as sub-human.\n\nLife after Death\n\nLike many Down Syndrome children, Anne de Gaulle died at an early age. Her brother Philippe recollects arriving at his parents\u2019 house in 1948 to find the entire residence immersed in silence. Noone, he writes, dared to say anything to his grief-stricken father. Anne was subsequently buried in the cemetery at the de Gaulles\u2019 parish church in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. After attending their regular Sunday Mass and always on the anniversary of her death, Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle would visit Anne\u2019s grave. 22 years after she died, her father was laid to rest beside Anne. Her mother joined them in 1979.\n\nThat, however, wasn\u2019t the end of the story. Back in October 1945, the de Gaulles raised enough money from private donors to buy the chateau de Vert-C\u0153ur in the department of Yvelines, not far from Paris. They then began creating a home for intellectually disabled girls. A few months after Anne\u2019s death, the Fondation Anne-de-Gaulle opened its doors at the chateau. Staffed by nuns, funded by the considerable royalties generated by de Gaulle\u2019s memoirs, and presided over by Yvonne de Gaulle until her death, the Foundation continues to serve the disabled today.\n\nOne of Charles de Gaulle\u2019s biographers, the late Jean Lacouture, records him as once saying, \u201cWithout Anne, I could never perhaps have done what I did. She gave me the heart and the inspiration.\u201d In that sense, the man of June 18 and his beloved pauvre petiteAnne teach us something which we are tempted to forget\u2014that all of us can find strength in weakness and that nothing is more powerful than self-giving love."}, {"url": "https://catholicstand.com/anne-de-gaulle/", "page_content": "Charles de Gaulle could be a very frustrating man. Churchill, in reference to de Gaulle, said that the heaviest cross he had to bear during the war was the Cross of Lorraine, the symbol of the Free French forces.\n\nArrogant, autocratic, often completely unreasonable, de Gaulle was all of these. However, there is no denying that he was also a great man. Rallying the Free French forces after the Nazi conquest of France, he boldly proclaimed, \u201cFrance has lost a battle, France has not lost the war.\u201d For more than a few Frenchmen and women, de Gaulle became the embodiment of France. It is also hard to dispute that De Gaulle is the greatest Frenchman since Clemenceau, \u201cThe Tiger\u201d, who led France to victory in World War I. However, de Gaulle was something more than a great man, he was also at bottom a good man, as demonstrated by his youngest daughter Anne de Gaulle.\n\nAnne de Gaulle Had Down Syndrome\n\nCharles and Yvonne de Gaulle were both devout Catholics, so when their youngest daughter Anne was born on New Years Day in 1928, they had a strong faith to fall back on when they learned that Anne had Down Syndrome. She also had birth injuries that meant that she would never walk unaided. There was never any question about Anne being institutionalized. She was a member of their family, and she stayed with the family in all their travels. There was one sacred rule in the de Gaulle household: Anne was never to be made to feel different or less than anyone else.\n\nCharles de Gaulle was noted for his reserve and even with family members he was usually not very demonstrative. Not so with his daughter Anne, who received a warmth that he had seemed to be storing for his entire life just for her. \u201cPapa\u201d was the one word that Anne could say clearly. He would sing to her, read her stories and play with her. She was, he said simply, \u201cMy joy\u201d. As de Gaulle said, \u201cShe helped me overcome the failures in all men, and to look beyond them.\u201d\n\nThe De Gaulles Were Heartbroken\n\nYvonne de Gaulle, a formidable woman in her own right, as she demonstrated after the collapse of France in 1940 when by herself she traveled across the war-torn country and made sure her family, including Anne, was on the last transport from Brest to England, in October 1945 bought the Ch\u00e2teau de Vert-C\u0153ur and established a hospital for handicapped girls, the Fondation Anne de Gaulle. The de Gaulles were heartbroken when their beloved daughter died on February 6, 1948, in her father\u2019s arms. After they had buried her, Charles gently told his weeping wife, \u201cMaintenant, elle est comme les autres.\u201d (Now, she\u2019s like all the others.)\n\nOf course , the de Gaulles did not forget their daughter. Charles de Gaulle\u2019s\u2019 life was saved by his love for Anne on August 22, 1962, when an assassin\u2019s bullet was deflected in the car he was riding by the frame of the picture of his daughter which he carried with him at all times. When he died in 1970 he was buried beside his daughter at Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises as he requested. Love gives us no guarantees against the tragedies of life, but it does give us the strength to surmount them."}, {"url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/history-of-education-quarterly/article/duchess-given-to-contemplation-the-education-of-margaret-cavendish/3988B4FEC611A086FFA00B27D4A74C29", "page_content": "A learned Woman is thought to be a Comet, that bodes Mischief, whenever it appears. \u2014Bathsua Makin, An Essay to Revive the Antient Education of Gentlewomen\n\nThe English author and natural philosopher Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle (1623\u20131673), reflected on the meaning and purpose of life: \u201cThere's a saying, That men are born to live, and live to dye; but I think some are onely born to dye, and not to live; for they make small use of life, and life makes small use of them.\u201dFootnote 1 For Cavendish, the most meaningful use of life was to contemplate and write, which she did from her earliest years.Footnote 2 As she explained in her autobiography, \u201cI was from my childhood given to contemplation, being more taken or delighted with thoughts than in conversation with a society.\u201dFootnote 3 Cavendish later cited her childhood manuscripts as evidence of her innate intelligence: \u201cBut it pleased God to command his Servant Nature to indue me with a Poetical and Philosophical Genius, even from my birth; for I did write some Books in that kind, before I was twelve years of age.\u201dFootnote 4\n\nCavendish repeatedly portrayed herself as innately intelligent and largely self-taught\u2014a necessity, given that women in seventeenth-century England were barred from attending the grammar schools and universities of their male peers.Footnote 5 This presentation of natural genius lent credibility and singularity to her corpus, while challenging the contemporary notion that women lacked reason.Footnote 6 In her lexicon, the term genius generally referred to \u201ca person's characteristic disposition\u201d or \u201ca person's natural aptitude for, or inclination toward, a specified thing or action.\u201dFootnote 7 Cavendish used the term in this way to describe both herself and the age in which she wrote.Footnote 8 In doing so, she emphasized her own agency and originality. The fact that her \u201cgenius\u201d was disposed toward contemplation and the study of poetry and natural philosophy enabled Cavendish to overcome her lack of education and write many books. However, she also depicted herself as writing at the speed of thought, reminiscent of the poetic frenzy inspired by supernatural genius: \u201cFor my phancy is quicker than the pen with which I write, insomuch as it is many times lost through the slowness of my hand, and yet I write so fast, as I stay not so long as to make perfect letters.\u201dFootnote 9\n\nAs an adult, Cavendish published \u201csome thirteen books in scores of editions,\u201d using nearly every conceivable literary genre then available.Footnote 10 Arguably the most prolific female author of her era, Cavendish's publications not only ensured her fame but also contradicted the belief that women were intellectually inferior to men. Cavendish used these publications to develop many pedagogical theories of her own and to advocate for women's education\u2014a focus of the current study\u2014which remains the key defining characteristic of her early feminism.Footnote 11 In terms of gender, Cavendish began with the premise that women do possess rational souls and are capable of learning and benefiting from education. She provided herself as an example, insisting that her books would have been even more intelligent, more well reasoned, and more orderly if she had been allowed to attend school like her brothers.\n\nAs a pivotal figure in the history of women's writing and education, several questions arise related to Cavendish. Why are some of her educational theories different from the types of education she received? How did her own education influence her thoughts on women's education? And how unusual were her ideas at the time she was writing? This article addresses these questions by examining Cavendish's own education through three discrete life stages.\n\nCavendish died the Duchess of Newcastle, but was born Margaret Lucas, the daughter of a wealthy landowner. When her idyllic childhood home was sacked at the beginning of the English Civil Wars, Margaret fled to Oxford, where she joined the court of Queen Henrietta Maria in the summer of 1643.Footnote 12 Margaret served the queen first at Oxford and then in Paris. While in Paris, Margaret met the much older and higher-ranking William Cavendish, Marquis of Newcastle (1592\u20131676). William, who had served King Charles I as Royalist commander of his northern armies, entered exile upon suffering a shattering defeat at the Battle of Marston Moor in July 1644. After a brief courtship, Margaret and William were married in 1645. They spent another fifteen years in exile together, in Paris and then Antwerp, before returning to England at the Restoration in 1660.Footnote 13\n\nBecause of these distinct stages in Cavendish's life\u2014childhood in England, early married life in Europe, and mature adulthood back in England\u2014her education can be described in rather concrete terms. In the first stage of her life (1623\u20131645), Margaret was educated at home by her mother, her older siblings, and private tutors. In the second stage of her life (1645\u20131660), after gaining experience in the court of Queen Henrietta Maria, Cavendish went on to read, write, and study under the informal tutelage of her husband, William, and brother-in-law, Sir Charles Cavendish.Footnote 14 During her time in Paris, Cavendish also had access to what historian Lisa Sarasohn describes as \u201ca kind of intellectual salon at Newcastle's residence\u201d that included Thomas Hobbes, Ren\u00e9 Descartes, and the atomist Pierre Gassendi.Footnote 15 In the third stage of her life (1660\u20131673), Cavendish returned to England and engaged in a rigorous course of study that enabled her to engage with the philosophical work of her contemporaries, while further developing her own educational theories. Following this tripartite structure, I link Cavendish's own educational experiences with her developing pedagogical theories. Cavendish argued for an individualized education that emphasized variety, pleasure, and creative freedom. She also suggested that women should be educated to the same extent as men, and that when they were, they would make better wives and partners. In this way, Cavendish used her privilege as an aristocratic self-publisher to forward an early feminist agenda.Footnote 16 I show that although Cavendish did not publish a single extended treatise on her educational theories, she did address women's problems\u2014especially their lack of educational opportunities\u2014repeatedly throughout her corpus.Footnote 17\n\nBathsua Makin offered an early commentary on Cavendish, describing her as autodidactic, or self-educated. Like Makin\u2014the educated daughter of a schoolmaster named Henry Reginald\u2014Cavendish also had a great deal to say about the problem of women's education.Footnote 18 Cavendish's numerous publications and sustained criticism of gender inequality likely inspired Makin to include Cavendish in An essay to revive the antient education of gentlewomen (1673), which includes this description of her: \u201cThe present Dutchess of New-Castle, by her own Genius, rather than any timely Instruction, over-tops many grave Gown-Men.\u201dFootnote 19 Makin emphasizes Cavendish's \u201cown Genius\u201d and downplays education in order to counter the argument that women \u201chad not rational souls as well as men.\u201dFootnote 20 Her effort to educate women drew on the work of the Dutch scholar Anna Maria van Schurman, who advocated for providing women a full humanist education.Footnote 21 As Douglas Grant notes, \u201cMrs. Makin suggested as proper subjects for women, grammar, rhetoric, logic, physic, languages, especially Greek and Latin . . . mathematics, geography, history and music.\u201dFootnote 22 However, most gentlewomen were only taught the rudiments of reading, writing, and arithmetic, so they could better function as helpmates to their husbands.Footnote 23 For Makin, Cavendish's lack of formal schooling served as a provocative example that women were born as capable as men.Footnote 24 Philosopher Mary Astell would later pick up and develop this theme of intellectual equity between the sexes in A Serious Proposal to the Ladies (1694). In it, she suggests forming an intellectual retreat for women reminiscent of Cavendish's fictional all-female communities in The Female Academy (1662) and The Convent of Pleasure (1668).Footnote 25\n\nCavendish's many publications\u2014in which she repeatedly addressed women's education, as well as her own learning\u2014set her apart during a time when evidence of early modern women's reading (and learning) remained \u201cscant and anecdotal.\u201dFootnote 26 As the influence of Francis Bacon and the new science promised educational reform for men in the seventeenth century, there were relatively few attempts at systematically educating women.Footnote 27 However, day schools, elementary schools for the poor, and boarding schools for gentlemen's daughters existed during this period.Footnote 28 Elementary schools were frequently held in people's homes, taught by women, and aimed to teach young boys and girls\u2014often together\u2014the basics of reading and writing.Footnote 29 The boarding schools some women attended also offered more advanced studies in classical languages, needlepoint, music, and dancing. During the second half of the seventeenth century, efforts to offer women formal education related to midwifery were squashed by men increasingly claiming all medical and scientific fields as their own.Footnote 30 And while a humanist education for men that emphasized classical literature and languages persisted throughout the seventeenth century, \u201cHistorians have estimated that [only] 30 percent of adult males could read.\u201dFootnote 31 The number of literate women was even lower, perhaps rising to 10 percent by 1640.Footnote 32 Importantly, Lara Dodds shows that \u201cCavendish preserves, or perhaps reinvents, the decorum of the female reader.\u201dFootnote 33 The most explicit statements related to Cavendish's reading can be found in Sociable Letters and Philosophical Letters (1664). Indeed, Cavendish not only read, but responded critically to, Plutarch, Aristotle, John Donne, Ben Jonson, and William Shakespeare, as well as John Milton, Bacon, Hobbes, Descartes, and several others.Footnote 34\n\nA lack of education for women was common during this period because, as Grant writes, \u201cThe accepted opinion was that it would be a waste to give girls more knowledge than they could use.\u201dFootnote 35 Unlike her unusually well-educated contemporary Lucy Hutchinson, Cavendish had to overcome her lack of formal education in order to become, according to Sarasohn, \u201cthe first woman to publish her own natural philosophy.\u201dFootnote 36 Margaret Cavendish was a pioneer who published boldly under her own name, and only as humbly as decorum demanded.Footnote 37 For this reason, Hero Chalmers credits Cavendish for \u201cthe birth of the modern woman author.\u201dFootnote 38\n\nStage One: Educated at Home (1623\u20131645) Margaret Lucas was the youngest daughter of the wealthy landowner Thomas Lucas (d. 1625). She admitted in her autobiography, A True Relation of My Birth, Breeding, and Life, that her father was not an aristocrat, although he and his family lived as if they were. Margaret's autobiography emphasized her genteel upbringing and indicated her desire to be taken seriously, despite a lack of formal education: \u201cI have been bred to elevated thoughts.\u201dFootnote 39 While she downplayed her knowledge of literature, Margaret also admitted to having a bookish nature.Footnote 40 To further underscore the studiousness with which she wished to be perceived, at the end of her autobiography, Cavendish insisted: Though I desire to appear to the best advantage, whilest I live in the view of the publick World, yet I could most willingly exclude my self, so as Never to see the face of any Creature, but my Lord, as long as I live, inclosing my self like an Anchoret.Footnote 41 Despite writing almost exclusively on secular subjects, her use of the religious term Anchoret here carried with it a potentially provocative Catholic connotation, especially when read in Protestant England. However, it also foregrounded the retired, contemplative life the author went on to lead. Cavendish returned to the ideas of contemplation and imagination throughout A True Relation. First, she described how she and her sisters passed their time when in the country. They would read, walk, and then discourse together on what they had learned.Footnote 42 Even though their conversations served \u201cas a major ingredient in the totally informal self-education that would be Margaret's main preparation for her adult writing career,\u201d they took a backstage to her own thoughts.Footnote 43 She described herself as \u201cbeing addicted from my childhood, to contemplation rather than conversation, to solitariness rather than society, to melancholy rather than mirth, to write with the pen than to work with a needle.\u201dFootnote 44 In this way, Margaret Cavendish portrayed herself as compelled to contemplate, to imagine, and to write. She also repeatedly described herself as melancholy, thoughtful, and solitary. She did this in order to underscore the presence of natural reason and downplay any artificial training she had received. She excused her drive to write rather than develop traditionally feminine skills. Cavendish's addiction to contemplation lasted throughout her life and served as a defining characteristic of her autodidacticism.Footnote 45 The fact that she considered the imagination a helpmate to reason also set her apart from Michel Montaigne and Descartes.Footnote 46 For example, Montaigne writes of the imagination, \u201cAll men are shockt therewith, and some overthrowne by it. One impression of it pierceth me, and for want of strength to resist her, I endevour to avoid it.\u201dFootnote 47 In this instance, Montaigne represents the imagination as something overwhelming and detrimental to reason. As the youngest in a family of eight children, Margaret received no formal training, but was instead informally educated by her widowed mother, older siblings, and \u201can Antient Decayed Gentlewoman.\u201dFootnote 48 Cavendish described her education as being standard for someone of her birth, breeding, and sex: \u201cAs for tutors, although we had for all sorts of Vertues, as singing, dancing, playing on Musick, reading, writing, working, and the like, yet we were not kept strictly thereto, they were rather for formalitie than benefit.\u201dFootnote 49 Typical of her class and gender, Margaret and her sisters were trained at home, with an emphasis on moral virtue over accomplishment. The theme of not being \u201ckept strictly thereto\u201d her studies endured throughout the course of her life.Footnote 50 Indeed, she often excused the imaginative spelling and punctuation in her published work with a lack of self-discipline.Footnote 51 She repeated this self-description multiple times throughout her career, especially when comparing her learning to those who were formally educated. She noted that \u201cthose that are bred at Schools, have a smack of the School, at least in their behaviour, that is a constraintness.\u201dFootnote 52 Embracing her own creative freedom, Cavendish believed this constraint negatively affected both social interactions and literary endeavors. While Margaret acknowledged the presence of tutors, much of her instruction during this time came from books and her siblings: When I read what I understood not, I would ask my brother the Lord Lucas, he being learned, the sense or meaning thereof, but my serious study could not be much, by reason I took great delight in attiring, fine dressing and fashions, especially such fashions as I did invent myself.Footnote 53 Here Cavendish described her earliest method of self-education. She would read or contemplate an issue, muse on various aspects and from multiple perspectives, then ask a trusted male figure (first her brother, then later her husband or brother-in-law) for more information.Footnote 54 Her ability to ask questions of her brothers, who supported her intellectual inquiry, set Margaret apart from most women who spent little time with their male siblings or peers.Footnote 55 In this way, she received individualized tutorials from men who were classically trained at university, thereby gaining tangential access to a secular education denied most women.Footnote 56 The fact that she included a disclaimer regarding the seriousness of her studies due to the \u201cgreat delight\u201d she took in dressing and fashions may have been a rhetorical strategy intended to deflect criticism from her contemporaries.Footnote 57 As an adult, Margaret Cavendish's eccentricity prompted private jokes questioning her sanity. By the nineteenth century, the now overly cited critiques of Cavendish by Samuel Pepys and Dorothy Osborne had developed into the popular myth that people cried out, \u201cMad Madge!\u201d as her coach traveled the streets of London.Footnote 58 However, multiple scholars have since argued that this eccentricity was an intentional construction used to protect her writing from censure.Footnote 59 Angeline Goreau, for example, suggests that if Cavendish was crazy, \u201cmaybe she was crazy like a fox.\u201dFootnote 60 Prior to the English Civil Wars and her decision to join the exiled court of Queen Henrietta Maria, Margaret's early life was remarkably sheltered. She described the unusually insular nature of the Lucas family as persisting\u2014by natural inclination\u2014even after the adult children were married.Footnote 61 Historian Sara Mendelson suggests that \u201cthe family's disinclination for sociability affected the development of Margaret's character.\u201dFootnote 62 Indeed, when Margaret first announced her decision to continue her education and training by serving at court, her siblings were deeply concerned.Footnote 63 Cavendish later discussed in various prefaces as well as in her largely autobiographical play, The Presence (1668), that she was so bashful and uncomfortable at court that many believed her simple.Footnote 64 The author also suggested that it was this very bashfulness that attracted William, writing, \u201cFor my Lord the Marquis of Newcastle did approve of those bashfull fears which many condemn'd, and would choose such a Wife as he might bring to his own humours, and not such an one as was wedded to self conceit.\u201dFootnote 65 Although theirs has been described as an \u201cintellectual and literary courtship,\u201d on the surface their early letters contain very little to impress.Footnote 66 Held at the British Library, their handmade paper now creased and discolored from age and blotted ink, these letters are bound in a folio guard book with various other manuscripts. Margaret's handwriting is nearly illegible. The spelling is poor. And many of the topics she addressed when writing to William are seemingly mundane. The extant letters from Margaret Lucas to William Cavendish\u2014the earliest known writing we have for her\u2014were penned during their courtship in Paris in 1645. These letters serve as a bellwether indicating the level of education and training Cavendish had received by the time she first married.Footnote 67 Despite their ordinary appearance, many of these letters show the philosophical and poetic \u201cGenius\u201d of the young Margaret. In letter seven, for example, Margaret described being melancholy because of the civil wars and her exile from England. Her sheltered childhood had done little to prepare her for serving at the exiled court in Paris. The insecurity and doubt she expressed in her letter foreshadowed the sense of human fallibility and skepticism that permeated her later philosophical work:Footnote 68 But supos me now in a very mallancolly humer and that most off my contempaltions [sic] are fext on nothing but dessolutions for i look apon this world as on a deths head for mortefication for i see all things subject to allteration and chaing and our hopes as if they had takin opum [opium] ther fore i will despis all things of this world i will not say all things in it and love nothing but you.Footnote 69 Margaret described herself as \u201cin a very mallancolly humer,\u201d perhaps signaling her unwillingness to conform to feminine conventions. Mendelson argues that Margaret \u201cchallenged the gender conventions of the time\u201d by drawing on the Hippocratic theory of the four humors\u2014black bile, yellow bile, blood, and phlegm\u2014to try and describe her emotional state in masculine terms.Footnote 70 Later in life, Cavendish would do the same thing by actively writing against the patriarchal \u201cexclusion of women from the canon of melancholia,\u201d instead casting her \u201cmelancholy as creative impetus.\u201dFootnote 71 In her letter, Margaret renounced the world, vowing to love nothing but William. Full of despair at the ongoing civil wars, social instability, and her subsequent exile from friends and family, Margaret presented herself as serious, thoughtful, and loyal. William replied to her letter, as he often did, with verses on her beauty. However, some of his verses also hinted at something more\u2014an essence or potential he could not quite describe: \u201cWhat I think of thee / Is still too bigg to bee Exprest by mee.\u201dFootnote 72 He went on in another poem to describe Margaret as \u201cincomprehensible\u201d and \u201cunexpressible,\u201d before ultimately concluding, \u201cThou art what thou arte.\u201dFootnote 73 Margaret may have seen lines like these as an acceptance of her unconventional nature and a willingness to support her continued desire to learn and to write. Margaret was deeply inspired by William and often praised him in the highest terms. She responded to his courtship poetry with lines like, \u201cAs grace drawes the sole to life so natuer the pencell of god has drawen your wit to the birth as may be seene by your verses though the subget is to mene for your mues.\u201dFootnote 74 Using one of her favorite literary techniques, the simile, Margaret compared grace and the creation of life to William's wit in writing verses.Footnote 75 She then reinforced her exaggerated praise with a self-deprecatory remark that she\u2014\u201cthe subget\u201d [subject]\u2014was \u201cto mene\u201d [too mean] for him to write on. She grew bolder and more confident in her praise as the courtship progressed. In another letter to William, she used phrases and images suggestive of her later creativity and ambition: My lord i have not had much expereanse of the world yet i have found it such as i could willinly part with it but sence i knew you i fear i shall love it to well becaus you are in it and yet me thinkes you are not in it becaus you are not off it so i am both in it and out off it a strong in chantment.Footnote 76 With these lines, Margaret underscored her lack of worldly experience, even as she praised William for being somehow outside the world (\u2018not off [of] it\u2019). She was so enchanted by his support and attraction for her that she went on to write in a later letter, \u201cI dessir nothing so much as the continnuanc of your affection for i think my self recher in haveing that then if i wer a monarch of all the world.\u201dFootnote 77 William's reputation as a patron of the arts, his aristocratic status as Marquis of Newcastle, his education and wit, as well as his willingness to engage creatively with Margaret all suggested his support of her intellectual development. In addition to demonstrating her early timidity and innocence, these letters and poems set the tone for the next stage of Margaret's life, in which William served as her primary instructor."}, {"url": "https://gettotext.com/charles-de-gaulle-what-has-become-of-philippe-elisabeth-and-anne-his-3-children-current-woman-le-mag/", "page_content": "We thought we knew everything about him, we were wrong all the way. History secrets and its issue of Monday June 15 unveil new mysteries about the complex personality of Charles de Gaulle. All the facets of the great French leader are explored and told by St\u00e9phane Bern, from his love for France to his mastery of communication tools, including his devotion to his family. From her marriage to Yvonne Vendroux (April 7, 1921), in fact came from three children: Philippe, Elisabeth and Anne, born respectively in 1921, 1924 and 1928.\n\nThe first, a recognized naval officer, was recently honored by the National Assembly. Modest man, now 98 years old, he had participated in the liberation of the Palais Bourbon in August 1944. There followed a beautiful and long career in the navy (42 years) then a political parenthesis as a senator ( 1986-2004) before spending happy days around history books, walking and television, as he confided in an interview for Paris-Match in 2019. During this interview, this fan of great sporting events had poured out on the fate of the youngest of the brothers, Anne, carrier of a trisomy 21.\n\nAnne, the General's darling daughter\n\nThis child united the De Gaulle couple because, together, they tried to awaken it, to make it progress by adapting to its rhythm, until his death on February 6, 1948 at the age of 20 years. They even installed a nursing home for disabled young girls on a property in the Yvelines, called the Anne De Gaulle foundation, and chaired by their first daughter, Elisabeth. The latter had married on January 3, 1946 Alain de Boissieu, whom she had met in London where this young officer had gone in 1942 after a spectacular escape. She joined her father and her youngest child in the Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises cemetery, where she was buried in April 2013.\n\nRead also : When Emmanuel Macron imitates Charles de Gaulle, \"for fun\""}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-de-Gaulle-president-of-France", "page_content": "Top Questions What were Charles de Gaulle\u2019s accomplishments? Charles de Gaulle led the Free French forces in resisting capitulation to Germany during World War II and became provisional president of France in the immediate aftermath of the war. Later he was an architect of the Fifth Republic and was president from 1959 to 1969. When did Charles de Gaulle become famous? Charles de Gaulle was undersecretary of state for defense and war when Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain took over the government of France with the intention of signing an armistice with Adolf Hitler. De Gaulle left for London, where, on June 18, 1940, he broadcast an appeal to his countrymen to continue to fight under his leadership. What were Charles de Gaulle\u2019s policies as president of France? Charles de Gaulle was determined that France should be treated as one of the great powers and not fall under the sway of any other country, particularly the United States. To that end, he made France a nuclear power, withdrew France from the military command of NATO, and followed his own views on foreign policy. When did Charles de Gaulle lose power? Charles de Gaulle lost power twice. He resigned as provisional president in 1946 because he opposed political parties forming the Fourth Republic, and, when his own movement failed to gain a majority, he retired from politics in 1953. The second time, voters rejected his proposed reforms, and he resigned as president in 1969.\n\nCharles de Gaulle, in full Charles Andr\u00e9 Joseph Marie de Gaulle, (born November 22, 1890, Lille, France\u2014died November 9, 1970, Colombey-les-deux-\u00c9glises), French soldier, writer, statesman, and architect of France\u2019s Fifth Republic.\n\nEducation and early career De Gaulle was the second son of a Roman Catholic, patriotic, and nationalist upper-middle-class family. The family had produced historians and writers, and his father taught philosophy and literature; but, as a boy, de Gaulle already showed a passionate interest in military matters. He attended the Military Academy of Saint-Cyr, and in 1913, as a young second lieutenant, he joined an infantry regiment commanded by Colonel Philippe P\u00e9tain. De Gaulle was an intelligent, hardworking, and zealous young soldier and, in his military career, a man of original mind, great self-assurance, and outstanding courage. In World War I he fought at Verdun, was three times wounded and three times mentioned in dispatches, and spent two years and eight months as a prisoner of war (during which time he made five unsuccessful attempts to escape). After a brief visit to Poland as a member of a military mission, a year\u2019s teaching at Saint-Cyr, and a two-year course of special training in strategy and tactics at the \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure de Guerre (War College), he was promoted by Marshal P\u00e9tain in 1925 to the staff of the Supreme War Council. From 1927 to 1929 de Gaulle served as a major in the army occupying the Rhineland and could see for himself both the potential danger of German aggression and the inadequacy of the French defense. He also spent two years in the Middle East and then, having been promoted to lieutenant colonel, spent four years as a member of the secretariat of the National Defense Council. De Gaulle\u2019s writing career began with a study of the relations between the civil and military powers in Germany (La Discorde chez l\u2019ennemi, 1924; \u201cDiscord Among the Enemy\u201d), followed by lectures on his conception of leadership, Le Fil de l\u2019\u00e9p\u00e9e (1932; The Edge of the Sword). A study on military theory, Vers l\u2019arm\u00e9e de m\u00e9tier (1934; The Army of the Future), defended the idea of a small professional army, highly mechanized and mobile, in preference to the static theories exemplified by the Maginot Line, which was intended to protect France against German attack. He also wrote a memorandum in which he tried, even as late as January 1940, to convert politicians to his way of thinking. His views made him unpopular with his military superiors, and the question of his right to publish under his name a historical study, La France et son arm\u00e9e (1938; France and Her Army), led to a dispute with Marshal P\u00e9tain. Britannica Quiz Pop Quiz: 17 Things to Know About World War II\n\nWorld War II At the outbreak of World War II, de Gaulle commanded a tank brigade attached to the French Fifth Army. In May 1940, after assuming command as temporary brigadier general in the 4th Armoured Division\u2014the rank that he retained for the rest of his life\u2014he twice had the opportunity to apply his theories on tank warfare. He was mentioned as \u201can admirable, energetic, and courageous leader.\u201d On June 6 he entered the government of Paul Reynaud as undersecretary of state for defense and war, and he undertook several missions to England to explore the possibilities of continuing the war. When the Reynaud government was replaced 10 days later by that of Marshal P\u00e9tain, who intended to seek an armistice with the Germans, de Gaulle left for England. On June 18 he broadcast from London his first appeal to his compatriots to continue the war under his leadership. On August 2, 1940, a French military court tried and sentenced him in absentia to death, deprivation of military rank, and confiscation of property. De Gaulle entered his wartime career as a political leader with tremendous liabilities. He had only a handful of haphazardly recruited political supporters and volunteers for what were to become the Free French Forces. He had no political status and was virtually unknown in both Britain and France. But he had an absolute belief in his mission and a conviction that he possessed the qualities of leadership. He was totally devoted to France and had the strength of character (or obstinacy, as it often appeared to the British) to fight for French interests as he saw them with all the resources at his disposal.

Broadcasts from London, the action of the Free French Forces, and the contacts of resistance groups in France either with de Gaulle\u2019s own organization or with those of the British secret services brought national recognition of his leadership; but full recognition by his allies came only after the liberation of Paris in August 1944. Henri Giraud, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Charles de Gaulle, and Winston Churchill; Casablanca Conference In London de Gaulle\u2019s relations with the British government were never easy, and de Gaulle often added to the strain, at times through his own misjudgment or touchiness. In 1943 he moved his headquarters to Algiers, where he became president of the French Committee of National Liberation, at first jointly with General Henri Giraud. De Gaulle\u2019s successful campaign to edge out Giraud gave the world proof of his skill in political maneuvering."}, {"url": "https://quadrant.org.au/opinion/qed/2020/11/charles-de-gaulle-half-a-century-on/", "page_content": "On the evening of November 9, 1970, 50 years ago last week, at his home and refuge of nearly four decades, La Boisserie in the commune of Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises in the Haute-Marne, after a day at work on the second volume of his memoirs, and tea with his wife, Charles de Gaulle sat down to play patience. Just before 7pm he cried out in pain and slumped on the table. Yvonne de Gaulle called the doctor and cur\u00e9, who administered the Last Rites. It was an aneurysm. At 7.25pm the saviour of modern France was dead. The General\u2019s confidant and successor, Georges Pompidou, declared the next day, \u201cFrance is a widow.\u201d\n\nIn 1952 the last great Frenchman had laid out the plans for his obsequies with precision and an almost perverse humility and restraint. His requiem Mass would be held at his local church with only his family, a few members of the local community and some Companions of the Liberation present. There would be no homily. He would be buried beside his adored younger daughter, Anne, with room left for his widow. His tombstone would say nothing but Charles de Gaulle (1890 \u2013 1970).\n\nHis most recent, and perhaps his best biographer, Julian Jackson, Professor of History at Queen Mary, University of London, observes in A Certain Idea of France (2018), de Gaulle was riddled with \u201cextraordinary contradictions\u201d. The Times Literary Supplement\u2019s Sudhir Hazareesingh summed him up, \u201cHe veered between buoyant optimism and crippling melancholy, calculating rationalism and ethereal mysticism, selfless abnegation and narcissistic egotism, shameless opportunism and obdurate inflexibility. Fittingly, his surname was derived from the Flemish word for \u2018wall'\u201d.\n\nHe has been compared to Charlemagne, Joan of Arc, Richelieu, Henri IV, Louis XIV, Napoleon, Chateaubriand and Cl\u00e9menceau. His minister for culture, Andr\u00e9 Malraux, once asked to whom he would compare himself. His reply? \u201cMy only rival is Tintin! We are the small who refuse to allow ourselves to be cheated by the big. Only, no one notices the similarity because of my size.\u201d (He was 6ft 4inches, when the average height in France was 5ft 3inches.)\n\nCharles Andr\u00e9 Joseph Marie de Gaulle was born on November 22, 1890, at his maternal grandparents\u2019 house in Lille. He was, however Petit Lillois de Paris \u2013 a Parisian from a distinguished family who had been born in Lille; not a provincial boy from Lille who found himself transported to Paris. He was the third of five children of Henri de Gaulle, who taught at a Jesuit school, and Jeanne Maillot, a member of the pious industrial bourgeoisie of Calais. The de Gaulles were austere traditional Catholics and minor aristocrats \u2014 an ancestor had fought at Agincourt. Charles\u2019s great-grandfather had been arrested during the Revolution and was spared the guillotine only by the fall of Robespierre. The family were monarchists under the skin, considering it a tragedy that the Comte de Chambord should have refused to accept the throne in 1873 if it meant also accepting the tricolor.\n\nThere was no question that he would be educated as a Catholic and after his school was closed he was sent to the Jesuits in Belgium. At school he was called Asparagus \u2013 his height and short-sightedness deflected by a chilly reserve. He brother, Xavier, suggested he had been dropped into an icebox at birth yet his vision and ambition knew no bounds.\n\nGraduating from St Cyr Military Academy in 1912, de Gaulle had chosen to serve in the 33rd Infantry stationed at Arras, under, then-colonel Philippe P\u00e9tain\u2019s command. Come the First World War, he was in Verdun where the first bombardment wiped out the whole of Captain de Gaulle\u2019s company (he was the youngest French Captain in the Great War). He was thought to have been killed too. P\u00e9tain issued a citation: \u201cCaptain de Gaulle had \u2018led his men in a furious assault and fierce hand-to-hand fighting, the only solution he considered compatible with his sentiment of military honour. Fell in the fray. A peerless officer in all respects.\u201d\n\nIn fact, he spent the rest of the war in German camps, escaping five times, only to be recaptured after every break because of his height. He greeted the Armistice \u201cwith the indescribable regret at not having played a greater role.\u201d\n\nAfter the war he joined the French Military Mission to Poland; returned to lecture in military history at St Cyr; he attended the Ecole de Guerre; was a ghostwriter for Petain (until he realised he was not the only one); and then postings to Treves and Beirut. A position on the Secretariat of the Supreme War Council followed; and then, in 1937, having been promoted to colonel, command of a tank regiment. By 1938 he had published four books \u2014 on war, leadership and the army. The last of them, La France et son arm\u00e9e, contained a eulogy of the revolutionary Hoche, which, Professor Jackson noted, prompted a sad rebuke from his father.\n\nWhen war broke out, he was already critical of what he saw as the passivity of the French High Command. After the Germans attacked in May 1940, he was given command of a new armoured division, which, among so much defeat, distinguished itself. On June 5, five days after being promoted to Brigadier-General, he was appointed Under-Secretary of State for National Defence, his first political office, in the government of Paul Reynaud.\n\nThe troops of General von K\u00fcchler\u2019s XVIIth army entered Paris on June 14, 1940, at 5.30 am. Two divisions advanced on the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower. By midday, the German high command had taken up residence in the H\u00f4tel de Crillon on the Place de la Concorde. As Ferdinand Mount put it,\n\nThere had been no battle, or even the slightest sign of resistance. It was not as if the French had collapsed at the first puff of smoke. In six weeks, they had already had nearly a hundred thousand men killed and lost half their tanks, a worse kill rate than at Verdun. Nobody had fought with greater \u00e9lan than de Gaulle and his tanks in their three sorties, which failed only because of the odds against them.\n\nWhen Churchill recalled that in 1918 Clemenceau had said, \u2018I will fight in front of Paris, in Paris and behind Paris,\u2019 P\u00e9tain replied that in 1918 he had had sixty divisions to spare. Now there were none. \u2018To make Paris into a city of ruins will not affect the issue.\u2019\u2026.. Had it not been for P\u00e9tain and Weygand, de Gaulle might have had to pick his way through the rubble when he walked down the Champs Elys\u00e9es on Liberation Day. Like Churchill, he would have preferred it that way.\n\nOn June 17, the day after P\u00e9tain replaced Reynaud, de Gaulle left for London \u201calone \u2026.. and stripped of everything, like a man on the beach proposing to swim across the ocean.\u201d In fact, he was accompanied by his aide-de-camp, Geoffroy Chodron de Courcel, and Churchill\u2019s representative, General Edward Spears. He landed at Heston soon after midday, as P\u00e9tain was announcing the formation of the collaborationist government. He carried with him a pair of trousers, four shirts and a photograph of his family.\n\nOn June 18, Charles-sans-terre, with nothing but his uniform and his voice, broadcast from London. \u201cL\u2019Appel du 18 Juin\u201d (\u2018France has lost a battle, she has not lost the war\u2019) was also the anniversary of the Waterloo.\n\nReminding his people,\n\nFor France is not alone! She is not alone! She is not alone! She has a vast Empire behind her. She can align with the British Empire that holds the sea and continues the fight. She can, like England, use without limit the immense industry of the United States\u2026\u2026.\n\nHe ended with,\n\nI, General de Gaulle, currently in London, invite the officers and the French soldiers who are located in British territory or who might end up here, with their weapons or without their weapons, I invite the engineers and the specialised workers of the armament industries who are located in British territory or who might end up here, to put themselves in contact with me.\n\nWhatever happens, the flame of the French resistance must not be extinguished and will not be extinguished\u2026\n\nOf the 50,000 members of the French military In Britain that day, 1000 would join him \u2013 the vast majority opted to be repatriated. Of the 1600 men in the White City camp, for example, only 152 signed up with de Gaulle. After the armistice in Syria, only 5500 of the Vichy troops rallied to the Free French; the other 30,000 chose to return to France.\n\nIn London he persisted with a combination of tactical skill, ruthlessness, obstinacy and sheer, grinding willpower. One of the many obstacles, he had to overcome was his lack of familiarity with English. He cited Charles V: \u201cOne speaks French to men, Italian to women, German to horses, Spanish to God but whoever heard of one speaking English?\u201d He had none of the expansive charm of a Franklin Roosevelt nor the sweeping oratorical power of a Winston Churchill. He also had to deal with divisions among his own supporters in London, and slights from the Americans. Roosevelt dismissed him as \u201cthe head of some French Committee\u201d.\n\nHis English hosts, too, were at best ambivalent. The waspish diplomat, Sir Alexander Cadogan, describes his guest as having \u201ca head like a pineapple and hips like a woman\u201d. Churchill wrote that the Cross of Lorraine was the heaviest cross he had had to bear. \u201cHe\u2019s selfish, he\u2019s arrogant, he thinks he\u2019s the centre of the Universe . . . he\u2019s a great man!\u201d As the New Yorker\u2019s Adam Gopnik put it, \u201cHis behavior was maddeningly adolescent, but he chose it for the same reason that an adolescent chooses his\u2014as the one way, in a position of actual dependency, to declare one\u2019s autonomy. Slamming the door of your bedroom is sometimes the only power you have when you are living in someone else\u2019s house.\u201d\n\nOne of de Gaulle\u2019s most precious assets was his family. In 1921, he had married Yvonne Vendroux, a good-looking, strong-willed, deeply private and deeply Catholic daughter of a prosperous Calais biscuit-maker, from a family not unlike his mother\u2019s. Her unpretentious nature and horror of adultery and divorce unfairly attracted the tag \u201cTante Yvonne\u201d from some of Paris\u2019s mondaine quartiers. She famously said, \u201cThe presidency is temporary, the family is forever\u201d. She detested living in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e and drew comfort and solace from the garden at La Boisserie, their home from 1934.\n\nThey had three children \u2014 Philippe (who became an Admiral and will be 99 in December); \u00c9lisabeth (1924-2013; who married Alain de Boissieu, later a general); and the beloved Anne (at left with her father in early Thirties) who was born in 1928, with Down\u2019s Syndrome. Papa was one of the few words she could pronounce and he was the only one who could make her laugh. He and Yvonne were devoted to her and fiercely protective. In 1945, Yvonne established an Anne de Gaulle Foundation for children with disabilities in a ch\u00e2teau bought for the purpose. De Gaulle\u2019s early biographer, Jean Lacouture, reported that one of the General\u2019s doctors said he heard his patient say: \u201cWithout Anne, perhaps I should not have done all that I have done. She gave me so much heart and spirit.\u201d\n\nAnne died in 1948, aged 20, of pneumonia, in her father\u2019s arms. After her body had been lowered into the earth, de Gaulle remained by the grave with Yvonne. Then he put his hand on his wife\u2019s arm and, as they turned to leave, murmured to her: \u201cShe\u2019s like others now.\u201d\n\nCome D-Day, de Gaulle was magnificent:\n\nThe supreme battle has begun \u2026 It is of course the Battle of France, and the battle for France \u2026 For the sons of France, wherever they may be, whoever they may be, the simple and sacred duty is to fight the enemy by all the means available \u2026 Behind the heavy clouds of our blood and our tears, the sunshine of our grandeur is re-emerging.\n\nChurchill wrote to Roosevelt the next day, the speech was \u201cremarkable, as he has not a single soldier in the great battle now developing.\u201d\n\nOn June 3, 1944, de Gaulle became Chairman of the provisional government of the French Republic. And finally, on August 25, 1944, he arrived in Paris. The next day the general strode \u2014 alone (his fellow resistors were asked to keep a few feet behind) \u2014 down the Champs Elysees in triumph, from the Arc de Triomphe to the Place de la Concorde, and then went to hear Mass in Notre Dame. All France then sang a Magnificat. De Gaulle even managed to arrange the French to witness the German surrender the following May (\u201cThe French are here, too?\u201d one of the German generals reportedly quipped.)\n\nIn January, 1946, finding factionalism and parliamentary manoeuvring distasteful, he retired. This would be the first of several retreats and returns. Throughout the early and mid-Fifties he would return to the hustings. He also completed the first volume of his memoirs with its famous opening sentence: \u201cAll my life I have had a certain idea of France.\u201d\n\nAs a nationalist uprising in Algeria in 1954 escalated into a full-scale war, he sat at Colombey playing patience and listening to the clack of Yvonne\u2019s knitting needles. By June 1958, a group of right-wing French military men, alarmed at events in Alg\u00e9rie francaise, organised a series of coups. De Gaulle was asked by the French President to lead a government of \u201cnational union\u201d for six months. It was said that the pieds noirs, the huge community of French nationals in Algeria, had been sold-out. According to Professor Jackson, De Gaulle\u2019s triumph was to make the French \u201cbelieve that he had controlled the process; and to create a compelling narrative that explained France\u2019s disengagement from Algeria and turned it into a victory rather than a defeat.\u201d\n\nElected president in December 1958, he declared the Fifth Republic a month later. Over the next decade (he described his term to his son as \u201ca kind of popular monarchy\u201d) De Gaulle rebuilt France and made it modern, pushing through an extraordinary number of reforms \u2014 monetary, administrative and institutional \u2014 justifiably compared with those of the Consulate of Napoleon. He also established a Franco-German axis as a foundation for (continental) European unity, he recognized communist China, criticised America\u2019s war in Vietnam, and twice vetoed British membership of Europe. He also condemned Israel\u2019s seizure of Arab territories during the Six Day War in 1967. And there was his explosive call to the people of Montreal in July 1967, Vive le Qu\u00e9bec,\u201d he concluded, and \u2013 after a long pause \u2013 \u201clibre.\u201d\n\nThat mix of austerity and hauteur never deserted him. While in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e, he insisted on paying the family telephone and electricity bills. When the government offered to award him a medal for his patriotic services, he retorted \u201cone does not decorate France\u201d.\n\nThe year 1968 was one of tumult all over the world. No less than en France. By May, the student rebellion that began in the streets of Paris had spread to the factories outside it. What was described as \u201can anti-materialist revolt with a largely incoherent practical politics\u201d \u2013 it sounds rather like the gilets jaunes \u2013 proved so deep an impatience with Gaullism that it transformed France within a week. May 29, 1968, was one of the most extraordinary day of his public life. De Gaulle left for Baden-Baden, where he met General Jacques Hassu (Did Hassu say, \u201cGive me two divisions and tomorrow, you can take your breakfast on the boulevard Saint Germain\u201d?) Was this his flight to Varennes? He then retreated, once again, to Colombey, and seemed on the brink of resignation. Instead, he returned to Paris and led an immense counter-demonstration. It was thought as many as a million supporters poured into the Champs Elys\u00e9e.\n\nIn the elections held in June 1969, the Gaullist party gained an outright parliamentary majority. Still, having lost an insignificant referendum on regional reform, an exhausted de Gaulle resigned a year later.\n\nHis tragedy was, according to Anthony Hartley, author of Gaullism: the Rise and Fall of a Political Movement (1972), that the president as arbiter led inexorably into becoming the president as party-boss, and in the process saw his own popularity decline as that of the party increased. He was endlessly disappointed in his countrymen, dismissing them as sheep (veaux).\n\nBack at la Boisserie in Colombey, he looked to his legacy as he embarked on the second volume of his memoirs, Endeavour. It was said that he planned to end his memoirs with an imagined dialogue between himself and Napoleon. As Patrice Gueniffey observes in Napoleon and de Gaulle: Heroes and History (2020), the important difference between the two men lay in their relationship to France, \u201cIf Napoleon was the least French of Frenchmen, de Gaulle was \u2026. the most French of Frenchmen.\u201d\n\nHe had once told a press conference, in his Sphinx-like way, \u201cReassure yourselves. I shall not fail to die.\u201d And so, thirteen days before his eightieth birthday, he did.\n\nOn November 12, as his simple ceremony took place at Notre Dame-de-Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises, 3,000 mourners (including eighty heads of state) gathered in and around Notre Dame de Paris. There, at 11am, the choir broke into the chorale from Bach\u2019s Matthew Passion. In accordance with the General\u2019s wishes, Cardinal Marty, Archbishop of Paris, delivered no sermon. Instead, after reading the lesson from St. John\u2019s second epistle to Timothy, he asked the congregation to meditate in silence on the search for \u201cjustice and peace in the world.\u201d Bells began to toll from the Notre Dame de Paris to Notre Dame-de-Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises and churches throughout the Republic. The climax came with the singing of the De Profundis and the Magnificat, recalling that day in 1944 when toute la France joined in reciting it to celebrate their liberation, paying homage to both their God \u2014 and their saviour.\n\nMark McGinness, an Australian living in the United Arab Emirates, is a frequent contributor"}, {"url": "https://journeytofrance.com/facts-about-charles-de-gaulle/", "page_content": "Do you want to know some interesting facts about Charles de Gaulle?\n\nBorn Charles Andr\u00e9 Joseph Marie de Gaulle in Lille, in northern France, on November 22, 1980, Charles de Gaulle is the last President of the Fourth Republic of France.\n\nIf there was one leader that is best associated with France, it would be Charles de Gaulle.

P\u00e9tain who fought in the First World War would later be imprisoned for treason.\n\nAs a soldier, de Gaulle was brilliant, hardworking, and passionate.

Charles de Gaulle married on April 6, 1921\n\nCharles de Gaulle was a military captain who was recently home from a mission in Poland when he met young Yvonne Vendroux.\n\nA year later, on 6 April 1921, the two were married in the Notre-Dame de Calais Church in Calais on the Opal Coast, where the Vendroux family was from.\n\n6.

She was born with Down syndome, a genetic disorder that is usually associated with distinct facial features, intellectual disability which can be mild to moderate, and delays in physical growth.\n\nSuffice it to say, Anne was his father\u2019s favorite. He would often sing and dance with her, or do pantomimes to entertain her.\n\nIn 1945, the de Gaulles established the Fondation Anne de Gaulle at the Ch\u00e2teau de Vert-C\u0153ur at Milon-la-Chapelle, in north-central France. It was a private hospital for handicapped girls like Anne, who succumbed to bronchial pneumonia in 1948.\n\n7. Charles de Gaulles was a devout Catholic\n\nCharles de Gaulle was raised in a strictly Catholic family. Henri de Gaulle, Charles\u2019 father, taught history and literature at a Jesuit high school in Paris.\n\nIt was Charles de Gaulle\u2019s religious parents who were responsible for his spiritual and intellectual formation in the Catholic faith. Prior to the military academy, he attended Catholic schools.\n\nWhen he was 16, Charles de Gaulle volunteered to be a stretcher-bearer at Lourdes. There he witnessed a miracle: a paralyzed Italian girl cured during the holy procession.\n\nDe Gaulle frequently attended the Mass and as a student he was one of the few who joined Congregation of the Holy Virgin, a religious organization devoted to prayer and spiritual meditation.\n\n8.

Charles de Gaulle survived 30 attempts on his life\n\nIf cats had nine lives, Charles de Gaulle had 30!\n\nThe most prominent of all these attempts was led by Jean Bastien-Thiry, a lieutenant-colonel in the French Air Force and also a military air-weaponry engineer.\n\nBastien-Thiry belonged to the Organisation Arm\u00e9e Secr\u00e8te, a right-wing organization that opposed President de Gaulle\u2019s decision to sign the independence of Algeria.\n\nHe was the last man in France to be executed by firing squad for his foiled assassination attempt on the president on August 22, 1962.\n\n11. His daughter Anne\u2019s picture saved General de Gaulle\u2019s life\n\nThe 22 August 1962 failed assassination attempt on Charles de Gaulle took place as he was riding his limousine with his wife at Petit-Clamart, a suburb of Paris.\n\nA potentially fatal bullet from the machine gun that ambushed the couple hit the frame of Anne de Gaulle\u2019s picture that her father always carried with him.\n\nThat day, the picture frame was placed on the rear shelf of the de Gaulle\u2019s limo, saving President de Gaulle\u2019s life by stopping the bullet that would have otherwise hit him.\n\n12. Charles de Gaulle died a natural death two weeks shy of his 80th birthday\n\nAfter so many foiled attempts on Charles de Gaulle\u2019s life, he enjoyed a very healthy life until November 9, 1970 \u2013 just a couple of weeks shy of his 80th birthday.\n\nHe died of aneurysm in his home in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises, watching TV and playing cards.\n\nThen French President Georges Pompidou announced General de Gaulle\u2019s death the following morning with a simple statement: \u201cLe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Gaulle est mort; la France est veuve.\u201d Translated to English, it means: \u201cGeneral de Gaulle is dead.

He later founded the French Fifth Republic in 1958 and served as its first president from 1959 to 1969.\n\nde Gaulle (born November 22, 1890; died November 9, 1970) was born in the industrial region of Lille in the Nord region of France, the third of five children. He was raised in a family of devout Roman Catholics who were patriotic and traditionalist, but also quite progressive.\n\nAt age 11, de Gaulle's family moved to Paris where he was later educated at the College Stanislas and also briefly in Belgium where he pursued his interest in reading and studying history. As he grew older, de Gaulle settled on a military career, intent on avenging the French defeat to the Germans of 1870.\n\nde Gaulle spent six months as an ordinary soldier before being promoted to corporal and then again to sergeant. He then spent four years studying and training at the elite military academy, Saint-Cyr, where he acquired the nicknames of \"the great asparagus\" and \"Cyrano\". At the academy de Gaulle received praise for his conduct, manners, intelligence, character, military spirit and resistance to fatigue.\n\nGraduating in 1912 in 13th place out of 210 cadets, his report noted that he was a highly gifted cadet who should go on to make an excellent officer. Preferring to serve in France rather than far away in North Africa or Indochina, de Gaulle joined the 33rd infantry regiment of the French Army commanded by Colonel Philippe P\u00e9tain, whose career de Gaulle would follow for the following 20 years.\n\nPromoted to platoon commander during World War I, de Gaulle took part in fierce fighting to check the German advance at Dinat, however he was wounded early on in battle. After returning from the hospital, de Gaulle was promoted again to company commander after so many men from his unit were killed. De Gaulle's unit gained recognition for repeatedly crawling out into no-mans-land to listen to the conversations of the enemy in their trenches - the information he brought back was so valuable that in January 1915 he received a citation for his bravery. After a more serious wound which incapacitated him for four months, he was promoted to captain in September 1915.\n\nAt the Battle of Verdun in March 1916, while leading a charge to try to break out of a position which had become surrounded by the enemy, de Gaulle received a bayonet wound to the leg and, passing out from the effects of poison gas, was captured at Douaumont. Initially giving him up for dead, P\u00e9tain, who was later to achieve great acclaim for his role in the battle, wrote in the regimental journal that de Gaulle had been \"an outstanding officer in all respects\". On December 1, 1918, three weeks after the armistice, he returned to his father's house in France to be reunited with his three brothers, who had all survived the war.\n\nWhile a prisoner of war, de Gaulle wrote his first book, co-written by Matthieu Butler, L'Ennemi et le vrai ennemi (The Enemy and the True Enemy), analysing the issues and divisions within the German Empire and its forces; the book was published in 1924. Another important book was Vers l'arm\u00e9e de m\u00e9tier (1932), in which he made suggestions for creating a better army, was largely ignored by French military officials, but not by the Germans. According to some reports, the German military followed some of de Gaulle's recommendations in World War II. He and his mentor, Petain, had a falling out over another book, a military history piece entitled La France et son arm\u00e9e (1938).\n\nAt the time fighting broke out between Germany and France, de Gaulle was leading a tank brigade. He was temporarily appointed the brigadier general of the 4th Armored Division in May of 1940. Continuing to rise up professionally, de Gaulle became the undersecretary for defense and war for French leader Paul Reynaud that June. A short while later, Reynaud was replaced by P\u00e9tain. P\u00e9tain's new government, sometimes called the Vichy government, worked out a deal with Germany to avoid further bloodshed. The Vichy regime became infamous for collaborating with the Nazis.\n\nA dedicated nationalist, de Gaulle did not accept France's surrender to Germany in 1940. He instead fled to England, where he became a leader of the Free French movement, with the support of British prime minister Winston Churchill.\n\nFrom London, de Gaulle broadcast a message across the English Channel to his countrymen, calling for them to resist the German occupation. He also organized soldiers from French colonies to fight alongside the allied troops.\n\nDe Gaulle sometimes irritated other allied leaders with his demands and perceived arrogance. American President Franklin D. Roosevelt reportedly could not stand him. In fact, at the war's end de Gaulle was purposely left out of the Yalta Conference, as Germany negotiated its surrender. He did, however, secure his nation an occupation zone in Germany and a seat on the United Nations Security Council. De Gaulle enjoyed wide support at home and, in 1945, became president of France's provisional government. In a dispute over greater power for the country's executive branch, de Gaulle resigned this post.\n\nFor several years, de Gaulle led his own political movement, \"Rally for the French People,\" which did not gain much momentum. He retired from politics in 1953.\n\nThe French government, known as the Fourth Republic, began to crumble in the late 1950s, and de Gaulle once again returned to public service to help his country. He helped form the country's next government, becoming its president in January 1959. Establishing France's Fifth Republic, de Gaulle dedicated himself to improving the country's economic situation and maintaining its independence. He sought to keep France separate from the two superpowers \u2014 the United States and the Soviet Union. To show France's military relevance, de Gaulle successfully campaigned for the country to press on with its nuclear weapons program.\n\nDe Gaulle was not afraid to make controversial decisions. After coping with uprisings in Algeria for years, he helped the French colony achieve independence in 1962. This move was not widely popular at the time. De Gaulle supported the idea of a united Europe, but he wanted Europe to be free from the superpowers' influences. He fought to keep Britain out of the European Economic Community because of its close ties to the United States. In 1966, de Gaulle also pulled his country's forces out of the North American Treaty Organization, acting again on his concerns with the United States. To some, de Gaulle came off as anti-American. Though he may have been, to some extent, his actions seemed to truly reflected his deep nationalistic views.\n\nSometimes inflexible and intractable, de Gaulle nearly saw his government toppled by student and worker protests in 1968. He managed to restore order to the country, but left power soon after, following a battle over political and economic reforms. In April 1969, de Gaulle resigned from the presidency.\n\nAfter his resignation, de Gaulle retired to his home in Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises. He had little time to enjoy the quiet life of this village, as he died of a heart attack on November 9, 1970. French President George Pompidou, who had worked closely with de Gaulle before succeeding him, delivered the terrible news to the public, saying \"General de Gaulle is dead.\n\nFrance is a widow.\" France mourned the loss of its famous statesman and military leader; the country had lost one of its greatest heroes\u2014a hero who had seen his people through war, and proved to be instrumental in his country's recovery.\n\nOther world leaders offered up words of praise for de Gaulle.Queen Elizabeth II said that his \"courage and tenacity in the allied cause during the dark years of the Second World War will never be forgotten.\" Two American presidents, Lyndon B. Johnson and Harry S. Truman, sent their condolences to the people of France, as well as to Soviet Premier Aleksei Kosygin. President Richard Nixon was among the foreign dignitaries who attended a special service for de Gaulle, held shortly after his death, at the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris."}]}
