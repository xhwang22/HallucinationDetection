{"John Russell Reynolds was called to the bar in 1845, and became a Queen's Counsel in 1859.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Famine-Irish-history/Great-Famine-relief-efforts", "page_content": "Great Famine relief efforts\n\nThe British government\u2019s efforts to relieve the famine were inadequate. Although Conservative Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel continued to allow the export of grain from Ireland to Great Britain, he did what he could to provide relief in 1845 and early 1846. He authorized the import of corn (maize) from the United States, which helped avert some starvation. The Liberal (Whig) cabinet of Lord John Russell, which assumed power in June 1846, maintained Peel\u2019s policy regarding grain exports from Ireland but otherwise took a laissez-faire approach to the plight of the Irish and shifted the emphasis of relief efforts to a reliance on Irish resources.\n\nMuch of the financial burden of providing for the starving Irish peasantry was thrown upon the Irish landowners themselves (through local poor relief) and British absentee landowners. Because the peasantry was unable to pay its rents, however, the landlords soon ran out of funds with which to support them, and the result was that hundreds of thousands of Irish tenant farmers and labourers were evicted during the years of the crisis. Under the terms of the harsh 1834 British Poor Law, enacted in 1838 in Ireland, the \u201cable-bodied\u201d indigent were sent to workhouses rather than being given famine relief per se. British assistance was limited to loans, helping to fund soup kitchens, and providing employment on road building and other public works. The Irish disliked the imported cornmeal, and reliance on it led to nutritional deficiencies. Despite those shortcomings, by August 1847 as many as three million people were receiving rations at soup kitchens. All in all, the British government spent about \u00a38 million on relief, and some private relief funds were raised as well. The impoverished Irish peasantry, lacking the money to purchase the foods their farms produced, continued throughout the famine to export grain, meat, and other high-quality foods to Britain. The government\u2019s grudging and ineffective measures to relieve the famine\u2019s distress intensified the resentment of British rule among the Irish people. Similarly damaging was the attitude among many British intellectuals that the crisis was a predictable and not-unwelcome corrective to high birth rates in the preceding decades and perceived flaws, in their opinion, in the Irish national character.\n\nThe famine coincided with a period of renewed expressions of nationalism in Ireland in the mid-19th century. The nationalist Young Ireland movement coalesced around a newspaper, The Nation, which began publication in 1842 and provided the growing movement for the repeal of the Act of Union with a vital cultural and political outlet. The Young Ireland movement was both energized and divided by the famine of the 1840s. Two writers in particular immersed themselves in the period\u2019s debate about Ireland\u2019s future and Britain\u2019s policies during the famine: John Mitchel and James Fintan Lalor. The most accomplished poet to publish in The Nation was James Clarence Mangan, who engaged with the famine in a melodramatic, intense, and often morbid style."}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00381-014-2485-5", "page_content": "He described several methods to examine muscular strength, coordination, sensory perception, tone, tremor, reflexes, and actions of individual muscles in his textbook. Gowers included some methods to evaluate the functions of cranial nerves. In 1879, Gowers first described the pattern of standing in 21 boys with pseudohypertrophic muscular paralysis in a clinical lecture to the students of University College [9].\n\nThe sign was originally described by Gowers in the context of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Gowers was not the first to describe the sign; Sir Charles Bell had reported it almost 50 years before Gowers\u2019 account [7]. There are three Gowers\u2019 signs: pain along the compressed sciatic nerve on passive dorsiflexion of the foot; the irregular contraction of the pupil in early tabes (cf. Argyll Robertson); and the climbing up the legs signs in Duchenne dystrophy [10].\n\nAlthough Gowers inveighed about of the use of eponyms, best known eponyms that bears his name are Gowers\u2019 phenomenon, Gowers\u2019 distal myopathy, Gowers\u2019 solution in the treatment of migraine, Gowers\u2019 anterior spinocerebellar tract, and Gowers\u2019 sign [10]. He also made contributions to other branches of neurology including neuromuscular diseases, neuro-ophthalmology, and spinal cord diseases [5]. He is probably best remembered for his most monumental contribution to the neurology. His \u201cManual of Diseases of the Nervous System\u201d initially appeared in 1886\u20131888, followed by a second edition in 1892\u20131893, and a partial third edition in 1899 [3]."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Russell-1st-Earl-Russell", "page_content": "John Russell, 1st Earl Russell, also called (until 1861) Lord John Russell, (born Aug. 18, 1792, London, Eng.\u2014died May 28, 1878, Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park, Surrey), prime minister of Great Britain (1846\u201352, 1865\u201366), an aristocratic liberal and leader of the fight for passage of the Reform Bill of 1832.\n\nRussell was the third son of John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford. (As the younger son of a peer, he was known for most of his life as Lord John Russell; he himself was created earl in 1861.) He thus came of a family that had long demonstrated its public spirit. The depth of his liberalism probably owed much to an untypical education. Poor health forbade the rigours of an English public school, and later, his father, who was critical of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, sent him to the University of Edinburgh, where he drank deeply of Scottish philosophy.\n\nIn 1813 he became a member of Parliament and four years later made his first important speech\u2014characteristically, an attack on the government\u2019s suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. In December 1819 Russell took up the cause of parliamentary reform, making it in the early 1820s not only his own cause but also that of the Whig Party. When the Whigs came to power in 1830, he joined the small ministerial committee that was to draft a reform bill, and on March 31, 1831, he presented it to the House of Commons. Overnight, he had won a national reputation.\n\nIn the 1830s and \u201940s, Russell remained the chief promoter of liberal reform in the Whig Party\u2014although never again, perhaps, was this role so glorious as in the protracted but successful conflict over the passing of the first Reform Bill. As paymaster general under Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, during roughly the first half of the 1830s, Russell championed the cause of religious freedom for both English Dissenters and Irish Roman Catholics. Indeed, he pursued these aims so zealously that, in seeking to divert some of the wealth of the established Church of Ireland (which was Protestant) to the Roman Catholics (who formed the bulk of the population), he frightened such leading Whigs as Lord Stanley (later Earl of Derby) out of the party. In the second half of the 1830s, as home secretary under Lord Melbourne, Russell, among other things, democratized the government of large towns (with the exception of London). He also reduced the number of criminal offenses liable to capital punishment and began the system of state inspection and support of public education.\n\nEven out of office from 1841 to 1846, when he stood in opposition to Sir Robert Peel, Russell left his mark. In 1845, in advance of his party, he came out in favour of total free trade, a crucial step in forcing Peel to follow him. As a result Peel split his party, the Whigs came to power, and Russell became prime minister.\n\nThis administration (1846\u201352) demonstrated that, although Russell\u2019s penchant for advanced ideas was as strong as ever, his ability to implement them was now seriously reduced. He was able to establish the 10-hour day in factory labour (1847) and to found a national board of public health (1848). But, largely because of party disunity and weak leadership, he was unable to end the civil disabilities of the Jews, extend the franchise to the workers in the cities, or guarantee security of tenure to the Irish farmers.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nIn the remaining years of his public career, Russell\u2019s difficulties increased. Party disunity continued and brought down his second administration (1865\u201366) when he made his last attempt to extend the franchise. But more significant, in the 1850s the national temper had changed. An age of reform had given way to a mood of self-complacency, even of belligerence. This was already evident in the Ecclesiastical Titles Act of 1851, which Russell\u2019s government had passed and which in effect was England\u2019s defiance of the papacy.\n\nThis mood deepened, transformed, on the one hand, into an appetite for foreign conquest and, on the other, into boredom with social and political reform. In such an atmosphere Russell was inevitably overshadowed by the forceful and popular Lord Palmerston, who seized the forefront of the national stage in the Crimean War (1854\u201356). Indeed, for four years, from 1855 to 1859, Russell retired from public life and devoted more and more of his time to literature. Private life had always beckoned to him, as had the life of a litterateur. Among the English prime ministers, few wrote so copiously\u2014biography, history, poetry\u2014as Russell. He accepted an earldom in 1861, and he died at Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park, in 1878."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-Jessel", "page_content": "Sir George Jessel, (born Feb. 13, 1824, London, Eng.\u2014died March 21, 1883, London), jurist considered one of the greatest English trial judges in equity. It is said that Jessel, as solicitor general (1871\u201373), was the first professing Jew to hold important governmental office in England. (Benjamin Disraeli, who had become prime minister in 1868, was born into Judaism but was baptized a Christian at the age of 12.)\n\nThe son of a London merchant, Jessel attended University College, London, and studied law at Lincoln\u2019s Inn. Called to the bar in 1847, Jessel was appointed a queen\u2019s counsel in 1865 and was elected to the House of Commons as a Liberal in 1868. From 1873 he was master of the rolls, originally sitting both as a judge of first instance in the Rolls Court and as a member of the Court of Appeal. Later, however, after statutes of 1875 and 1876 had made the master of the rolls the president of the Court of Appeal, he was exclusively an appellate judge.\n\nJessel\u2019s rapid and efficient work as a trial judge in equity contrasted sharply with the traditionally dilatory nature of English chancery proceedings (bitterly satirized by Charles Dickens in his novel Bleak House, 1852\u201353). The clarity of his judgments made them exceptionally useful as precedents; they were seldom appealed and very rarely reversed. He helped to effect the fusion of law and equity under the Supreme Court of Judicature acts (1873 et seq.)."}, {"url": "https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51143/51143-h/51143-h.htm", "page_content": "The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Waterloo Roll Call, by Charles Dalton This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.

Je les tiens donc, ces Anglais! \u2014 Napoleon.\n\nNever since the days of Oliver Cromwell had any name caused so much fear in England as did that of Napoleon Bonaparte. From 1802 until his first downfall, in 1814, a spirit of alarm and uneasiness pervaded all classes in Great Britain, from the King and his Ministers down to the most illiterate peasant. Those who were witnesses of, and participators in, this panic have now passed away, but the national pride which our victory over Napoleon at Waterloo excited in every Briton\u2019s breast is as strong as ever, and will last till the crack of doom.\n\nIn July, 1803, a little pamphlet, entitled Important Considerations for the People of this Kingdom , was published in London, and \u201csent to the officiating minister of every parish in England.\u201d This pamphlet, which bears the Royal Arms of England, was an appeal from the Government to the Nation, and a diatribe against Napoleon. Mark the closing lines of this appeal: \u201cShall we, who are abundantly supplied with iron and steel, powder and lead\u2014shall we, who have a fleet superior to the maritime force of all the world, and who are able to bring two millions of fighting men into the field\u2014shall we yield up this dear and happy land, together with all the liberties and honours, to preserve which our fathers so often dyed the land and the sea with their blood?... No, we are not so miserably fallen; we cannot, in so short a space of time, have become so detestably degenerate; we have the strength and the will to repel the hostility, to chastise the insolence of the foe. Mighty, indeed, xmust be our efforts, but mighty also is the need.\u201d The idea of a French invasion was slow in forcing its way into the minds of the uneducated classes in England. When they first heard of such a possibility they thought it of no more consequence than the invasion of Scotland by Charles Edward Stuart with a mere handful of Frenchmen at his back. They also thought less of the projected descent from having heard so much in 1797, and during the Rebellion in Ireland in 1798, of a French army coming to the relief of the National party in that kingdom:\u2014\n\n\u201cFor the French are on the sea, Says the Shan Van Vaugh, And Ireland will soon be free, Says the Shan Van Vaugh.\u201d\n\nAnd yet nothing had come of all this talk! But when the nation at large had fully grasped the possibility of a Napoleonic invasion, Pitt had no difficulty in raising the sinews of war. No fewer than 300,000 men enrolled themselves in volunteer corps and defence associations. The army and navy were increased, and everything was done that was possible to counteract the power of that wonderful man, who, in the short space of a few years, had, speaking metaphorically, built a Great Wall of China round the British Isles, shutting the English out of the commerce of Europe. Our preparations were none too soon. In 1805 the battle of Austerlitz established the supremacy of Napoleon over Austria and Russia. Fortunately for England, Nelson\u2019s crowning victory at Trafalgar indefinitely postponed Napoleon\u2019s invasion scheme; but we were still engaged in a gigantic war, single-handed, with half of Europe our declared, and the other half our enforced, enemies. Nelson was dead; Pitt was dying from the weight of anxieties which pressed upon him in this tremendous crisis; Hanover had been taken from us. The outlook was very gloomy, and affairs became more complicated in 1807, when the military expeditions, arranged by Lord Grenville\u2019s ministry, against Constantinople and Egypt, had turned out failures, and resulted in the Turks declaring war against us and confiscating all British property. And yet in 1807 Napoleon had not yet reached the zenith of his power. For the next xifive years he held the destinies of nearly the whole of Europe in his own hands. Monarchies of long standing were disestablished and new kingdoms\u2014Napoleonic kingdoms\u2014were raised up in their place. Immense French armies traversed Europe from Portugal to the heart of Russia, and every capital within that limit was, in its turn, subjugated to the French yoke. But in 1808 two British Generals stemmed the tide of French conquest in the Peninsula, viz., Sir John Moore and Sir Arthur Wellesley. The first met a soldier\u2019s death at Corunna, and the latter was superseded by an incapable commander. But the British Government soon found that they had made a grievous mistake, and Wellesley was again entrusted with the supreme command in Portugal. Then commenced that series of brilliant campaigns which liberated Portugal and Spain from the Napoleonic grasp, and only ceased after the battle of Toulouse by Napoleon\u2019s abdication at Fontainebleau. In the spring of 1814 England had a large army, composed for the most part of seasoned veterans, who were fit for anything and worth millions. When war broke out again, in the spring of 1815, at least half of the Peninsular army had been disbanded\u2014dispersed\u2014and not to be had at any price. Some of the best of the old Peninsular regiments had been sent to America in 1814, and several of them\u2014the gallant 43rd Light Infantry being one\u2014did not reach Waterloo in time to take part in the battle. Raw levies took their place, and foreign auxiliaries helped to bring up Wellington\u2019s army in Flanders to the required strength. Of Wellington\u2019s 106,000 barely one-third were British. The remainder consisted of \u201cKing\u2019s German Legion,\u201d \u201cHanoverian Levies,\u201d \u201cBrunswick Contingent,\u201d \u201cNassau Contingent,\u201d \u201cDutch and Belgian Troops,\u201d and \u201cNassauers in Dutch service.\u201d Of this polyglot force the German Legion, both cavalry and infantry, were deserving of the highest praise for their conduct on Waterloo Day. They formed part of the British army for nearly a dozen years, and many British officers held commissions in the \u201cLegion.\u201d I have been obliged to leave out the German Legion officers in the following Roll Call (excepting those who served on the Staff), and it would be invidious, when all did so well, to pick out the British officers who served in the xii\u201cLegion\u201d at Waterloo and record their services when those of their German brother-officers are omitted. I cannot even make an exception of Colonel (afterwards Baron) Hugh Halkett, who, like a knight in the olden days of chivalry, singled out a French general (Cambronne) in single combat, and took him prisoner.\n\nThe Hanoverian levies did well also, excepting one regiment, which refused to charge the French when commanded so to do. And this was doubtless owing to the l\u00e2chet\u00e9 of their colonel, who, when ordered to lead his regiment to the charge, declined to do so, saying he had no confidence in his men. It is related that Captain Horace Seymour, who had brought this officer Lord Uxbridge\u2019s orders, addressed \u201ca few words of plain Saxon\u201d to him, \u201cwhich no gentleman ought to have listened to unmoved,\u201d but the only effect they had on the Hanoverian was to hasten his departure to the rear. The Brunswick Contingent fought at a disadvantage at Waterloo, having lost their brave leader (the Duke of Brunswick) at Quatre Bras. Of the Nassau, Dutch, and Belgian troops it is only fair to say that they were, mostly, utterly useless at Waterloo. The glamour of Napoleon was upon them. They had lately been in his service, and had a settled conviction that Wellington would be defeated and his army cut to pieces. \u201cCome over to us, brave Belgians!\u201d shouted a French regiment at Waterloo to their Belgian opponents in the battle. But the \u201cbrave Belgians\u201d preferred making \u201ca retrograde movement for strategical reasons,\u201d and retired from the field, carrying news of Wellington\u2019s defeat to Brussels.\n\nNow for Napoleon\u2019s army: This consisted on the 15th of June of about 128,000 men[A]\u2014mostly veterans who had served in many campaigns, and to whom defeat was rare. Add to this, that they all belonged to one nation, and were all equally devoted to their beloved emperor. \u201cNo army,\u201d says Colonel Chesney, in his Waterloo Lecture , \u201cwas probably ever so well furnished with leaders as his, as none had ever the like experience wherewith to train them.\u201d It is no slight to Wellington to say that Napoleon was, for rapid and offensive warfare, by far the first general of his xiiiday. In defensive warfare Wellington was much in advance of his great rival. Taking the words out of Philip the Second\u2019s mouth, Wellington might have with truth said, \u201cTime and I against any other two.\u201d Once more: Wellington himself told Earl Stanhope that he considered the presence of Napoleon with the French army at Waterloo fully equivalent to an additional force of 30,000 men! Now this was the total of the force sent under Marshal Grouchy, on the 17th June, to follow the Prussian army, which had been defeated at Ligny by Napoleon on the previous day, and which was supposed to be in full retreat on Namur and Li\u00e9ge, so that, in round numbers, Napoleon was himself considered equal to a whole army corps! If the British had a Picton, the French had a Ney, who was considered almost Napoleon\u2019s equal in handling troops in the field, and who had pressed us so sorely at Quatre Bras, on the 16th of June, when only half our army had arrived at that position. Then as a leader of cavalry Lord Uxbridge was well matched by Kellermann, whose fame as a cavalry general dated from Marengo. And General Mouton (Count Lobau) was an infantry leader of whom any army might have been proud. It was he who, at the head of the Imperial Foot Guards, had wrested the victory from the Prussians on the bloody field of L\u00fctzen, in 1813, and saved the French army from a reverse. Enough has now been said to show what a splendid army the British had opposed to them on the 18th of June, 1815. \u201cI have them at last, these English!\u201d exclaimed Napoleon, in a transport of joy, early in the morning of that day, when he saw our army drawn up in position, with their backs to the forest of Soignies. But he underrated Wellington\u2019s generalship, nor could he foresee how the British generals, officers, and men of all ranks would fight that memorable day, when the eyes of all Europe were upon them, because upon the issue of that contest depended the fate of empires and kingdoms, as well as the future peace of the world. And knowing, as we all do, what glory the victory at Waterloo brought to our countrymen and our country, we must be generous enough to give the brave Prussians the full share due to them for their co-operation on that day. Had it not been for them, Waterloo would have been as barren a victory as Borodino, and Napoleon would have retreated in as good xivorder, probably, as Blucher was able to do after his defeat at Ligny. As it was, our troops bore the whole brunt of the battle without losing an inch of ground, and the arrival of the Prussians, at the close of the day, sealed the fate of Napoleon.[B]\n\nIn offering this, the first annotated Waterloo Army List, to the British public, I must ask their indulgence for any omissions and errors it may contain. Although I have spared no trouble in the matter, there must be, I well know, a few names of British Waterloo officers who have escaped my notice. But when the following list is compared with the very defective lists given by Siborne and George Jones (the foundation of all other lists), I think the following Roll Call will be found infinitely more trustworthy. I have also added the regimental and army commissions of the Waterloo officers up to the date of the battle, and the honours and promotions bestowed after Waterloo. The war services of many of these same officers now appear in print for the first time, and are not to be found in the Military Calendar of field officers which was published in 1820, nor in Hart\u2019s Army Lists , which date from 1840, and are such valuable works of reference. Of course, a large proportion of the names I have annotated, genealogically, are names of well-known families of the present time, but there are also many names in the following Roll Call which belong to families that are now extinct or lost sight of. I have endeavoured to rescue as many names from oblivion as time would allow, but there are a certain number of whom I can give no information beyond their obituary notices:\n\n\u201cHere lies Pat Steele. That\u2019s very true. Who was he? What was he? What\u2019s that to you?\u201d\n\nAs regards the orthography of the names in the regimental lists, I am not responsible, as they are copied from the \u201cofficial\u201d xv Army List . The same rule applies to the precedence of the different regiments.\n\nI am indebted to Colonel F.A. Whinyates, late R.H.A., for some interesting information regarding artillery officers, and to George Tancred, Esq., late captain Scots Greys, for the Waterloo muster-roll and some memoranda relating to the Scots Greys.\n\nCharles Dalton.\n\n32 West Cromwell Road, London, S.W.\n\nJune 1, 1890.\n\nxvi ABBREVIATIONS.\n\nPar. = Peninsular.

In Sir D. Baird\u2019s despatch, announcing the victory of the British troops, occurs this passage: \u201cYour lordship will perceive the name of Lt.-Col. Grant among the wounded; but the heroic spirit of this officer was not subdued by his misfortune, and he continued to lead his men to glory as long as an enemy was opposed to the 72nd Regt.\u201d The following is an authentic anecdote:\u2014\n\nSir Colquhoun Grant, being in command of a regt. at Clonmel, he gave offence in some way to an honest shopkeeper, named Mulcahy, who struck him on the parade, in presence of his whole corps. The officers rushed forward to seize the delinquent, but Sir Colquhoun interposed, declaring that he had been the aggressor, and as the gentleman thought proper to resent his conduct in so gross a manner, it remained for him to seek the usual reparation. \u201cOh!\u201d exclaimed Mulcahy, \u201cif it\u2019s for fighting you are, I\u2019ll fight you; but it shall neither be with swords nor pistols, nor anything else but my two fists\u201d (and fine big mutton fists they were, sure enough). \u201cWell, then,\u201d replied the gallant officer, \u201cwith all my heart. By insulting you, I have put myself on a level with you, and of course cannot refuse to meet you on your own terms. Come along, sir.\u201d The men were dismissed; and Col. Grant, accompanied by his adversary and some mutual friends, repaired to the mess-room, where he very speedily closed up Mr. Mulcahy\u2019s peepers, and sent him home perfectly satisfied. That was the proudest day of Mulcahy\u2019s life, and many a time has he boasted of the black eye he got from a K.C.B., as if it were an honourable ordinary emblazoned upon his escutcheon. \u201cEver since that morning,\u201d would he say, \u201clet me meet Sir Colquhoun Grant, where I might, in town or country, among lords or ladies, dressed in plain clothes or dizened out in gold and scarlet, he would give me his hand and say,\u2018How are you, Billy?\u2019\u201d\n\nIn Aug., 1808, Grant was appointed lt.-col. of the 15th Lt.

Maitland, of Shrubs Hall, in the New Forest. Joined the 1st Regt. of Foot Guards in 1792. Commanded the 1st Brigade of Guards at the battle of Nive. The example he set, both at Quatre Bras and Waterloo, had much to do with the victory then obtained over the French. When Napoleon\u2019s \u201cOld Guard\u201d made that gigantic and final effort, on the evening of June 18th, to retrieve the fortunes of the day, it was Maitland\u2019s brigade which checked their advance and drove them headlong down the bloody slope. \u201cNow, Maitland, now\u2019s your time!\u201d said Wellington, as the leading column of the French Guards approached the crest of the slope where the British Guards were stationed\u2014the front rank kneeling. How Maitland responded is told in the words of Col. J. H. Stanhope in his letter to the Duke of York:\u2014\u201cWere it possible for me to add anything to the reputation of Maitland by stating the gallantry he has shown, cheering on with his hat off, I could dwell long on the subject.\u201d Made K.C.B., 22nd June, 1815.

Was acting as adjutant to Lord Saltoun. His horse, a fine thoroughbred, refused a fence, and tried to wheel round. As Lord Saltoun was passing down a path close by, a body fell across his horse\u2019s neck and rolled off. It was poor Hay, who had been picked off by a French cavalry skirmisher, who was, in his turn, shot dead by a Grenadier.

Howe De Lancey, K.C.B., K.\n\nThe De Lanceys were descended from a wealthy Huguenot family, who went from Caen, in Normandy, to America, after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. In the short space of sixty years this family produced three celebrated soldiers, viz., Gen. Oliver De Lancey, a leading American loyalist, who fought on the British side during the War of Independence, and, settling in England, d. at Beverley, 1785. In another generation, an Oliver De Lancey distinguished himself as a Christine leader in the Spanish war, and was killed at the siege of San Sebastian in 1837. The third distinguished soldier of this family was the above Wm. Howe De Lancey, who was only son of S. De Lancey, Gov. of Tobago, by Cornelia his wife, who d. in 1817. His early career was one of renown, and in 1799 we find him maj. of the 45th Regt., at the age of 21. On 4th April, 1815, he was married, in Scotland, to the beautiful Magdalen Hall, dau. of Sir James Hall, Bart., of Dunglass, by Lady Helen Douglas, dau. of 4th Earl of Selkirk. The return of Napoleon from Elba once more called De Lancey to the seat of war. Leaving his fair young wife, he proceeded, in May, to Brussels, whither he was followed, the first week in June, by his bride. At Waterloo, when riding by Wellington\u2019s side, the wind of a cannon ball knocked him off his horse. This, it was afterwards found, had separated the ribs from the back-bone, and caused a fatal injury. Wellington caused De Lancey to be removed to a hut in a blanket. For some days hopes were entertained of his recovery, and he was devotedly nursed by his sorrow-stricken wife, whose perilous drive to the battle-field, and her experiences, were lately given in the Illustrated Naval and Military Magazine , from an old MS. narrative written by herself. After lingering ten days, the hero died.\n\n\u201cFair lady\u2019s love, and splendid fame, De Lancey did enthral.

After Waterloo was appointed A.D.C. to Wellington, which post he held during the British occupation in France. The following anecdote is from Reminiscences of Wellington and Anecdotes of his Staff , by Lord Wm. Lennox:\u2014\u201cFelton Hervey, of the 14th, who had lost an arm when in pursuit of the enemy flying from Oporto, always mounted himself and his orderly upon English hunters, so as to make his escape should he at any time be unexpectedly surrounded. Upon one occasion, when reconnoitring, Hervey rode up, by mistake, to a small detachment of French cavalry. Fortunately for him, the men were dismounted, and busily employed in cooking their rations; but no sooner was the colonel discovered, and his rank recognized, than the order to mount was given. Hervey and his orderly, finding the odds greatly against them, immediately started off at a tremendous pace to reach our lines. The French dragoons were quickly in their saddles, for the prize was worth gaining, and amidst wild shouts and loud halloes, gave chase to their flying foes. The noise attracted the attention of some of the enemy\u2019s lancers, who, being posted nearer the English forces, were enabled to cut off the retreat of the fugitives. The clattering of the horses\u2019 hoofs, who had thus joined in the pursuit, sounded like a death-knell to the two gallant soldiers. \u2018Your only chance, colonel,\u2019 said the faithful orderly, \u2018is to make for that ravine.\u2019 Hervey followed the suggestion; the ravine was narrow, with only room for one horse to enter. No sooner had he gained it than, on looking round, a terrible sight presented itself. The devoted soldier, knowing that the life of his commanding officer could alone be saved by the sacrifice of his own, had placed himself across the narrow opening, and was literally pierced and cut to pieces. The delay thus occasioned enabled Hervey to pursue his flight. Gaining the open, he charged a stiff fence, and was soon out of sight of his pursuers.\u201d He m., 1817, Louisa Catherine, 3rd dau. of Richard Caton, of Maryland, U.S.A.; was created a baronet, with remainder to his brother Frederick, 3rd Oct., 1818, and d. s. p. 24th Sept., 1819.\n\nLt.-Col.

He entered Parliament as Liberal member for Dover in 1868 and was appointed solicitor general in 1871, being the first Jew to hold ministerial office in England.\n\nIn 1873, he became master of the rolls.

He was also one of the greatest logicians of the 20th century. An outspoken social reformer, he campaigned effectively against unjust and irrational impediments to human freedom and happiness.\n\nDuring his childhood Bertrand Russell was educated at home. In 1890 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge , where he studied mathematics and philosophy , graduating with first-class honours in both (1893 and 1894, respectively) and winning a fellowship in the latter in 1895. That year he briefly attended lectures in economics at the University of Berlin .\n\nBertrand Russell\u2019s childhood was grief-stricken and lonely. His mother and sister died when he was two years old, and his father died some 18 months later. He and his brother, Frank, were cared for by their paternal grandparents, but their grandfather died soon after Bertrand\u2019s sixth birthday. Educated at home, he was isolated from other children.\n\nBertrand Russell, in full Bertrand Arthur William Russell, 3rd Earl Russell of Kingston Russell, Viscount Amberley of Amberley and of Ardsalla, (born May 18, 1872, Trelleck, Monmouthshire, Wales\u2014died February 2, 1970, Penrhyndeudraeth, Merioneth), British philosopher, logician, and social reformer, founding figure in the analytic movement in Anglo-American philosophy, and recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950. Russell\u2019s contributions to logic, epistemology, and the philosophy of mathematics established him as one of the foremost philosophers of the 20th century. To the general public, however, he was best known as a campaigner for peace and as a popular writer on social, political, and moral subjects. During a long, productive, and often turbulent life, he published more than 70 books and about 2,000 articles, married four times, became involved in innumerable public controversies, and was honoured and reviled in almost equal measure throughout the world. Russell\u2019s article on the philosophical consequences of relativity appeared in the 13th edition of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.\n\nRussell was born in Ravenscroft, the country home of his parents, Lord and Lady Amberley. His grandfather, Lord John Russell, was the youngest son of the 6th Duke of Bedford. In 1861, after a long and distinguished political career in which he served twice as prime minister, Lord Russell was ennobled by Queen Victoria, becoming the 1st Earl Russell. Bertrand Russell became the 3rd Earl Russell in 1931, after his elder brother, Frank, died childless.\n\nBritannica Quiz Philosophy 101\n\nRussell\u2019s early life was marred by tragedy and bereavement. By the time he was age six, his sister, Rachel, his parents, and his grandfather had all died, and he and Frank were left in the care of their grandmother, Countess Russell. Though Frank was sent to Winchester School, Bertrand was educated privately at home, and his childhood, to his later great regret, was spent largely in isolation from other children. Intellectually precocious, he became absorbed in mathematics from an early age and found the experience of learning Euclidean geometry at the age of 11 \u201cas dazzling as first love,\u201d because it introduced him to the intoxicating possibility of certain, demonstrable knowledge. This led him to imagine that all knowledge might be provided with such secure foundations, a hope that lay at the very heart of his motivations as a philosopher. His earliest philosophical work was written during his adolescence and records the skeptical doubts that led him to abandon the Christian faith in which he had been brought up by his grandmother.\n\nIn 1890 Russell\u2019s isolation came to an end when he entered Trinity College, University of Cambridge, to study mathematics. There he made lifelong friends through his membership in the famously secretive student society the Apostles, whose members included some of the most influential philosophers of the day. Inspired by his discussions with this group, Russell abandoned mathematics for philosophy and won a fellowship at Trinity on the strength of a thesis entitled An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry, a revised version of which was published as his first philosophical book in 1897. Following Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason (1781, 1787), this work presented a sophisticated idealist theory that viewed geometry as a description of the structure of spatial intuition.\n\nIn 1896 Russell published his first political work, German Social Democracy. Though sympathetic to the reformist aims of the German socialist movement, it included some trenchant and farsighted criticisms of Marxist dogmas. The book was written partly as the outcome of a visit to Berlin in 1895 with his first wife, Alys Pearsall Smith, whom he had married the previous year. In Berlin, Russell formulated an ambitious scheme of writing two series of books, one on the philosophy of the sciences, the other on social and political questions. \u201cAt last,\u201d as he later put it, \u201cI would achieve a Hegelian synthesis in an encyclopaedic work dealing equally with theory and practice.\u201d He did, in fact, come to write on all the subjects he intended, but not in the form that he envisaged. Shortly after finishing his book on geometry, he abandoned the metaphysical idealism that was to have provided the framework for this grand synthesis.\n\nRussell\u2019s abandonment of idealism is customarily attributed to the influence of his friend and fellow Apostle G.E. Moore. A much greater influence on his thought at this time, however, was a group of German mathematicians that included Karl Weierstrass, Georg Cantor, and Richard Dedekind, whose work was aimed at providing mathematics with a set of logically rigorous foundations. For Russell, their success in this endeavour was of enormous philosophical as well as mathematical significance; indeed, he described it as \u201cthe greatest triumph of which our age has to boast.\u201d After becoming acquainted with this body of work, Russell abandoned all vestiges of his earlier idealism and adopted the view, which he was to hold for the rest of his life, that analysis rather than synthesis was the surest method of philosophy and that therefore all the grand system building of previous philosophers was misconceived. In arguing for this view with passion and acuity, Russell exerted a profound influence on the entire tradition of English-speaking analytic philosophy, bequeathing to it its characteristic style, method, and tone.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The philosophical case for this point of view\u2014subsequently known as logicism\u2014was stated at length in The Principles of Mathematics (1903). There Russell argued that the whole of mathematics could be derived from a few simple axioms that made no use of specifically mathematical notions, such as number and square root, but were rather confined to purely logical notions, such as proposition and class. In this way not only could the truths of mathematics be shown to be immune from doubt, they could also be freed from any taint of subjectivity, such as the subjectivity involved in Russell\u2019s earlier Kantian view that geometry describes the structure of spatial intuition. Near the end of his work on The Principles of Mathematics, Russell discovered that he had been anticipated in his logicist philosophy of mathematics by the German mathematician Gottlob Frege, whose book The Foundations of Arithmetic (1884) contained, as Russell put it, \u201cmany things\u2026which I believed I had invented.\u201d Russell quickly added an appendix to his book that discussed Frege\u2019s work, acknowledged Frege\u2019s earlier discoveries, and explained the differences in their respective understandings of the nature of logic.\n\nThe tragedy of Russell\u2019s intellectual life is that the deeper he thought about logic, the more his exalted conception of its significance came under threat. He himself described his philosophical development after The Principles of Mathematics as a \u201cretreat from Pythagoras.\u201d The first step in this retreat was his discovery of a contradiction\u2014now known as Russell\u2019s Paradox\u2014at the very heart of the system of logic upon which he had hoped to build the whole of mathematics. The contradiction arises from the following considerations: Some classes are members of themselves (e.g., the class of all classes), and some are not (e.g., the class of all men), so we ought to be able to construct the class of all classes that are not members of themselves. But now, if we ask of this class \u201cIs it a member of itself?\u201d we become enmeshed in a contradiction. If it is, then it is not, and if it is not, then it is. This is rather like defining the village barber as \u201cthe man who shaves all those who do not shave themselves\u201d and then asking whether the barber shaves himself or not.\n\nAt first this paradox seemed trivial, but the more Russell reflected upon it, the deeper the problem seemed, and eventually he was persuaded that there was something fundamentally wrong with the notion of class as he had understood it in The Principles of Mathematics. Frege saw the depth of the problem immediately. When Russell wrote to him to tell him of the paradox, Frege replied, \u201carithmetic totters.\u201d The foundation upon which Frege and Russell had hoped to build mathematics had, it seemed, collapsed. Whereas Frege sank into a deep depression, Russell set about repairing the damage by attempting to construct a theory of logic immune to the paradox. Like a malignant cancerous growth, however, the contradiction reappeared in different guises whenever Russell thought that he had eliminated it.\n\nEventually, Russell\u2019s attempts to overcome the paradox resulted in a complete transformation of his scheme of logic, as he added one refinement after another to the basic theory. In the process, important elements of his \u201cPythagorean\u201d view of logic were abandoned. In particular, Russell came to the conclusion that there were no such things as classes and propositions and that therefore, whatever logic was, it was not the study of them. In their place he substituted a bewilderingly complex theory known as the ramified theory of types, which, though it successfully avoided contradictions such as Russell\u2019s Paradox, was (and remains) extraordinarily difficult to understand. By the time he and his collaborator, Alfred North Whitehead, had finished the three volumes of Principia Mathematica (1910\u201313), the theory of types and other innovations to the basic logical system had made it unmanageably complicated. Very few people, whether philosophers or mathematicians, have made the gargantuan effort required to master the details of this monumental work. It is nevertheless rightly regarded as one of the great intellectual achievements of the 20th century.\n\nPrincipia Mathematica is a herculean attempt to demonstrate mathematically what The Principles of Mathematics had argued for philosophically, namely that mathematics is a branch of logic. The validity of the individual formal proofs that make up the bulk of its three volumes has gone largely unchallenged, but the philosophical significance of the work as a whole is still a matter of debate. Does it demonstrate that mathematics is logic? Only if one regards the theory of types as a logical truth, and about that there is much more room for doubt than there was about the trivial truisms upon which Russell had originally intended to build mathematics. Moreover, Kurt G\u00f6del\u2019s first incompleteness theorem (1931) proves that there cannot be a single logical theory from which the whole of mathematics is derivable: all consistent theories of arithmetic are necessarily incomplete. Principia Mathematica cannot, however, be dismissed as nothing more than a heroic failure. Its influence on the development of mathematical logic and the philosophy of mathematics has been immense.\n\nDespite their differences, Russell and Frege were alike in taking an essentially Platonic view of logic. Indeed, the passion with which Russell pursued the project of deriving mathematics from logic owed a great deal to what he would later somewhat scornfully describe as a \u201ckind of mathematical mysticism.\u201d As he put it in his more disillusioned old age, \u201cI disliked the real world and sought refuge in a timeless world, without change or decay or the will-o\u2019-the-wisp of progress.\u201d Russell, like Pythagoras and Plato before him, believed that there existed a realm of truth that, unlike the messy contingencies of the everyday world of sense-experience, was immutable and eternal. This realm was accessible only to reason, and knowledge of it, once attained, was not tentative or corrigible but certain and irrefutable. Logic, for Russell, was the means by which one gained access to this realm, and thus the pursuit of logic was, for him, the highest and noblest enterprise life had to offer.\n\nIn philosophy the greatest impact of Principia Mathematica has been through its so-called theory of descriptions. This method of analysis, first introduced by Russell in his article \u201cOn Denoting\u201d (1905), translates propositions containing definite descriptions (e.g., \u201cthe present king of France\u201d) into expressions that do not\u2014the purpose being to remove the logical awkwardness of appearing to refer to things (such as the present king of France) that do not exist. Originally developed by Russell as part of his efforts to overcome the contradictions in his theory of logic, this method of analysis has since become widely influential even among philosophers with no specific interest in mathematics. The general idea at the root of Russell\u2019s theory of descriptions\u2014that the grammatical structures of ordinary language are distinct from, and often conceal, the true \u201clogical forms\u201d of expressions\u2014has become his most enduring contribution to philosophy.\n\nRussell later said that his mind never fully recovered from the strain of writing Principia Mathematica, and he never again worked on logic with quite the same intensity. In 1918 he wrote Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy, which was intended as a popularization of Principia, but, apart from this, his philosophical work tended to be on epistemology rather than logic. In 1914, in Our Knowledge of the External World, Russell argued that the world is \u201cconstructed\u201d out of sense-data, an idea that he refined in The Philosophy of Logical Atomism (1918\u201319). In The Analysis of Mind (1921) and The Analysis of Matter (1927), he abandoned this notion in favour of what he called neutral monism, the view that the \u201cultimate stuff\u201d of the world is neither mental nor physical but something \u201cneutral\u201d between the two. Although treated with respect, these works had markedly less impact upon subsequent philosophers than his early works in logic and the philosophy of mathematics, and they are generally regarded as inferior by comparison.\n\nConnected with the change in his intellectual direction after the completion of Principia was a profound change in his personal life. Throughout the years that he worked single-mindedly on logic, Russell\u2019s private life was bleak and joyless. He had fallen out of love with his first wife, Alys, though he continued to live with her. In 1911, however, he fell passionately in love with Lady Ottoline Morrell. Doomed from the start (because Morrell had no intention of leaving her husband), this love nevertheless transformed Russell\u2019s entire life. He left Alys and began to hope that he might, after all, find fulfillment in romance. Partly under Morrell\u2019s influence, he also largely lost interest in technical philosophy and began to write in a different, more accessible style. Through writing a best-selling introductory survey called The Problems of Philosophy (1911), Russell discovered that he had a gift for writing on difficult subjects for lay readers, and he began increasingly to address his work to them rather than to the tiny handful of people capable of understanding Principia Mathematica.\n\nIn the same year that he began his affair with Morrell, Russell met Ludwig Wittgenstein, a brilliant young Austrian who arrived at Cambridge to study logic with Russell. Fired with intense enthusiasm for the subject, Wittgenstein made great progress, and within a year Russell began to look to him to provide the next big step in philosophy and to defer to him on questions of logic. However, Wittgenstein\u2019s own work, eventually published in 1921 as Logisch-philosophische Abhandlung (Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, 1922), undermined the entire approach to logic that had inspired Russell\u2019s great contributions to the philosophy of mathematics. It persuaded Russell that there were no \u201ctruths\u201d of logic at all, that logic consisted entirely of tautologies, the truth of which was not guaranteed by eternal facts in the Platonic realm of ideas but lay, rather, simply in the nature of language. This was to be the final step in the retreat from Pythagoras and a further incentive for Russell to abandon technical philosophy in favour of other pursuits.\n\nDuring World War I Russell was for a while a full-time political agitator, campaigning for peace and against conscription. His activities attracted the attention of the British authorities, who regarded him as subversive. He was twice taken to court, the second time to receive a sentence of six months in prison, which he served at the end of the war. In 1916, as a result of his antiwar campaigning, Russell was dismissed from his lectureship at Trinity College. Although Trinity offered to rehire him after the war, he ultimately turned down the offer, preferring instead to pursue a career as a journalist and freelance writer. The war had had a profound effect on Russell\u2019s political views, causing him to abandon his inherited liberalism and to adopt a thorough-going socialism, which he espoused in a series of books including Principles of Social Reconstruction (1916), Roads to Freedom (1918), and The Prospects of Industrial Civilization (1923). He was initially sympathetic to the Russian Revolution of 1917, but a visit to the Soviet Union in 1920 left him with a deep and abiding loathing for Soviet communism, which he expressed in The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism (1920).\n\nIn 1921 Russell married his second wife, Dora Black, a young graduate of Girton College, Cambridge, with whom he had two children, John and Kate. In the interwar years Russell and Dora acquired a reputation as leaders of a progressive socialist movement that was stridently anticlerical, openly defiant of conventional sexual morality, and dedicated to educational reform. Russell\u2019s published work during this period consists mainly of journalism and popular books written in support of these causes. Many of these books\u2014such as On Education (1926), Marriage and Morals (1929), and The Conquest of Happiness (1930)\u2014enjoyed large sales and helped establish Russell in the eyes of the general public as a philosopher with important things to say about the moral, political, and social issues of the day. His public lecture \u201cWhy I Am Not a Christian,\u201d delivered in 1927 and printed many times, became a popular locus classicus of atheistic rationalism. In 1927 Russell and Dora set up their own school, Beacon Hill, as a pioneering experiment in primary education. To pay for it, Russell undertook a few lucrative but exhausting lecture tours of the United States.\n\nDuring these years Russell\u2019s second marriage came under increasing strain, partly because of overwork but chiefly because Dora chose to have two children with another man and insisted on raising them alongside John and Kate. In 1932 Russell left Dora for Patricia (\u201cPeter\u201d) Spence, a young University of Oxford undergraduate, and for the next three years his life was dominated by an extraordinarily acrimonious and complicated divorce from Dora, which was finally granted in 1935. In the following year he married Spence, and in 1937 they had a son, Conrad. Worn out by years of frenetic public activity and desiring, at this comparatively late stage in his life (he was then age 66), to return to academic philosophy, Russell gained a teaching post at the University of Chicago. From 1938 to 1944 Russell lived in the United States, where he taught at Chicago and the University of California at Los Angeles, but he was prevented from taking a post at the City College of New York because of objections to his views on sex and marriage. On the brink of financial ruin, he secured a job teaching the history of philosophy at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia. Although he soon fell out with its founder, Albert C. Barnes, and lost his job, Russell was able to turn the lectures he delivered at the foundation into a book, A History of Western Philosophy (1945), which proved to be a best-seller and was for many years his main source of income.\n\nIn 1944 Russell returned to Trinity College, where he lectured on the ideas that formed his last major contribution to philosophy, Human Knowledge: Its Scope and Limits (1948). During this period Russell, for once in his life, found favour with the authorities, and he received many official tributes, including the Order of Merit in 1949 and the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950. His private life, however, remained as turbulent as ever, and he left his third wife in 1949. For a while he shared a house in Richmond upon Thames, London, with the family of his son John and, forsaking both philosophy and politics, dedicated himself to writing short stories. Despite his famously immaculate prose style, Russell did not have a talent for writing great fiction, and his short stories were generally greeted with an embarrassed and puzzled silence, even by his admirers.\n\nIn 1952 Russell married his fourth wife, Edith Finch, and finally, at the age of 80, found lasting marital harmony. Russell devoted his last years to campaigning against nuclear weapons and the Vietnam War, assuming once again the role of gadfly of the establishment. The sight of Russell in extreme old age taking his place in mass demonstrations and inciting young people to civil disobedience through his passionate rhetoric inspired a new generation of admirers. Their admiration only increased when in 1961 the British judiciary system took the extraordinary step of sentencing the 89-year-old Russell to a second period of imprisonment.\n\nWhen he died in 1970 Russell was far better known as an antiwar campaigner than as a philosopher of mathematics. In retrospect, however, it is possible to see that it is for his great contributions to philosophy that he will be remembered and honoured by future generations."}, {"url": "https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018AG0105-002378", "page_content": "The following Queen\u2019s counsel appointees are listed chronologically by the date they were called to the bar:\n\nCorrinne Lee Ongman has practised law since graduating from the University of British Columbia (UBC) faculty of law in 1977.

With a few other lawyers, he fought successfully to end capital punishment in Canada, one of his proudest accomplishment. His clients included many poor people who paid him in fish or moose or not at all (Shufelt), and he was a strong supporter of a provincial legal aid system. By all accounts, Petrone was \u201clarger than life,\u201d and a remarkable lawyer.\n\nNominated by Christopher Watkins. Source: \u201cAlfred Petrone Obituary,\u201d sargentandson.com Web. Dec. 2009.

An innovative courtroom lawyer who took some of the first Charter cases to the Supreme Court, he brought his advocate's skills and sensibilities to politics. He introduced many reforms including pay equity, no-fault insurance, freedom-of- information legislation. His reforms of the justice system included restructuring of the courts, abolishing Queen\u2019s Counsel appointments and introducing an independent advisory committee to make judicial appointments more merit-based; the latter measure resulted in a bench that became more representative of Ontario\u2019s diversity.
