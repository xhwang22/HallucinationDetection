Just eight weeks later, Valvano died of adenocarcinoma at the age of 47.\n\nThat same year, Scott joined ESPN and launched what would become a two-decade career as a sports journalist, commentator and anchor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2007, Scott was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. Since then, he's not only fought the disease, but he's chosen to live a full life as a partner, a dad, an athlete and a sports commentator.\n\nDoug Ulman, president and CEO of the Livestrong Foundation, praised Scott in a video feature that aired during the awards program.\n\n\"There are a lot of people that see [Scott] as a beacon of light, and something that they can relate to,\" Ulman said. \"\u2026I hear from people every day. He's on TV and he's doing what he loves. They take strength from the fact that he has not been paralyzed by his illness and that he has decided to live life on his own terms.\"\n\nAfter the video ended, Scott took the stage and received his award from actor Kiefer Sutherland.\n\nDuring Scott's acceptance speech, he thanked loved ones and colleagues for supporting his efforts, then showed his modest side, noting that he never thought he belonged in the same category as people who had received past Jimmy V awards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"At my gut level, I really didn't think that I belonged with those great people,\" Scott said. \"But I listened to what Jim Valvano said 21 years ago, the most poignant seven words ever uttered in any speech anywhere: 'Don't give up. Don't ever give up.' Those great people didn't. Coach Valvano didn't. So to be honored with this, I now have a responsibility to also not ever give up. I'm not special. I just listened to what the man said.\"\n\nScott also talked about how difficult it is to suffer with a disease like cancer. In fact, prior to the show, he underwent four surgeries in the span of seven days. Scott wasn't even sure if he was going to survive. But with the help of his medical staff, his family, his friends and his fans, he made it to the awards ceremony. And that's when he realized the whole battle is \"not a solo venture.\"\n\n\"When you die, that does not mean that you lose to cancer. You beat cancer by how you lived, why you lived and in the manner in which you lived,\" Scott said. \"So live. Live. Fight like hell. And when you get too tired to fight, then lay down and rest and let somebody else fight for you.\""}, {"url": "https://people.com/celebrity/espy-awards-stuart-scott-speech-references-cancer-battle/", "page_content": "SportsCenter anchor Stuart Scott was honored with the Jimmy V Perseverance Award at the ESPY Awards on Wednesday night, and while the pre-speech short clip that ESPN put together documenting Scott\u2019s battle with cancer (see below) was moving, it\u2019s his speech that\u2019s making the rounds today, with good reason.\n\nScott first invoked the man the award is named for: Jim Valvano, a former North Carolina State University basketball coach who died of bone cancer in 1993. In a speech at the first-ever ESPY Awards, he announced the creation of The V Foundation for Cancer Research, and its motto: \u201cDon\u2019t give up don\u2019t ever give up.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be honored with this \u2026 I know I have a responsibility to never give up,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI\u2019m not special; I just listened to what the man said.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you die, it does not mean that you lose to cancer.

Scott will be honored with the Jimmy V Perseverance Award for the passion and determination he has displayed in the face of ongoing personal challenges.\n\nScott\u2019s broadcasting career started early as on-air talent at the student-run radio station at the University of North Carolina. After graduating, he went right into reporting for various local TV stations in both South Carolina and North Carolina. Scott joined ESPN in 1993 for the launch of ESPN2 and his role at the company has consistently grown over the years as he developed into one of the iconic voices of SportsCenter. Scott has also served as a lead host for various NFL, MLB and NBA programs including Monday Night Countdown, NFL Primetime, Sunday NFL Countdown and the NBA Finals. Scott has secured many exclusive, one-on-one interviews with notable figures including Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, President Clinton and President Barack Obama.\n\nScott\u2019s successful career was forced to take a back seat when he was first diagnosed with appendiceal cancer in November of 2007. He underwent two surgeries and months of chemotherapy before he was given a clean bill of health. Only two years later, the cancer returned. Scott\u2019s most recent surgery was in September 2013 and he is presently continuing with medical treatments. To treat both his body and his mind, Scott has taken to fighting his cancer in the gym, with intense mixed martial arts and cross-training workouts. Despite what is now a public battle with the disease, Scott continues his high-profile role at ESPN and focuses on being a dedicated father to his two daughters.\n\n\u201cStuart\u2019s story is truly one of perseverance as he consistently displays strength, resilience and even humor while combating this terrible disease,\u201d said ESPN president, John Skipper. \u201cGiven how much Stuart has actively supported The V Foundation through the years from within ESPN, it is an honor to now present him with the Jimmy V Perseverance Award to celebrate the inspiration he provides to so many around him.\u201d\n\nScott commented: \u201cI make a living with words and can\u2019t remember the last time I was at a loss for them\u2026until learning about this amazing honor. I was literally speechless. I\u2019ve had the honor of presenting this very award before and I\u2019ve always been in awe of the recipients. To now be a part of what they stand for is beyond description. Thank you V Foundation and thank you Jim Valvano for STILL guiding us all these years\u2026we won\u2019t give up\u2026we won\u2019t EVER give up.\u201d\n\nThe Jimmy V Perseverance Award was named after, and inspired by, the late Jimmy Valvano who became the award\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre at the 1993 ESPYS. While battling cancer, Valvano gave an emotional acceptance speech that included his famous words \u201cDon\u2019t Give Up . . . Don\u2019t Ever Give Up!\u201d\u00ae. Valvano passed away less than two months later, but his words were never forgotten. The Jimmy V Award is given to a deserving member of the sporting world who has overcome great obstacles through perseverance and determination. In 2007, Women\u2019s College basketball coach Kay Yow became the very first recipient of the Jimmy V Award. Past recipients include Eric LeGrand, Anthony Robles, George Karl and Dick and Rick Hoyt.\n\nAbout The V Foundation\n\nThe V Foundation for Cancer Research was founded in 1993 by ESPN and the late Jim Valvano, legendary North Carolina State basketball coach and ESPN commentator. Since inception, The V Foundation has funded more than $115 million in cancer research grants nationwide. It awards 100 percent of all direct cash donations to cancer research and related programs.

In fact, he made a living using his eloquence to cover sports. However, ESPYs producer Maura Mandt noted that when she informed Stuart that he would be receiving the Jimmy V award at the ESPYS, he was speechless.\n\nScott alluded to that at the opening of his speech:\n\n\u201cWhen I first heard that I was going to be honored with this reward, the very first thing that I did was, I was speechless, briefly. I\u2019ve presented this award before. I mean, I\u2019ve watched in awe as Kay Yow and Eric LeGrand and all these other great people graced this stage and although intellectually, I get it.

Obviously, the network hoped to not have to use it but wanted to be prepared to honor their colleague should tragedy strike. ESPN producer Mike Leber believes Scott never knew about the tribute:\n\nWe definitely discussed whether to include him and the discussion was along the lines of maybe he would want to contribute in some way, or maybe he would feel hurt if someone said the wrong thing and he found about it through other means. But the other side of it was he was in a position where he needed so much positive energy and positive reinforcement and the idea that his friends and colleagues were preparing for the end is such a negative. Being a professional, he may have known something was up and chose not to ask about it. But to my knowledge, he was not aware of the piece.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Are you playing daily fantasy yet?

In March, a scan declared he was cancer free.\n\nThe ordeal, and the honor, is all the more poignant and symbolic considering that at the very first ESPYS in 1993, Vitale presented his great friend Jim Valvano with the Arthur Ashe Award for Courage, after which Jimmy V delivered the unforgettable acceptance speech that in many ways still epitomizes the spirit of the ESPYS, and led to the creation of the V Foundation for Cancer Research. In the years since, Dickie V has been one of the leading voices of the V Foundation. He has long hosted a gala that\u2019s raised nearly $55 million for pediatric cancer research and the Foundation.\n\nSaid Vitale: \u201cWhen I received the call from Jimmy Pitaro about receiving this award, I was absolutely blown away. I remember that day almost 30 years ago, when I stood on stage at the first ESPYS, introduced Jimmy V and witnessed him give that incredible speech we all remember. I reflected on his speech many times during my seven month battle \u2013 \u2018don\u2019t give up, don\u2019t ever give up Dickie V\u2019 \u2013 and I remembered my mother and father, who taught me never to believe in \u2018can\u2019t\u2019. Jimmy V was special and his legacy lives on. I am so grateful to receive this tremendous award in his honor.\u201d\n\nVitale\u2019s history at ESPN goes back to the very beginning. He called the first-ever college basketball game the network aired, Wisconsin at DePaul on December 5, 1979. Since then, he\u2019s called more than a thousand games, his thorough knowledge of the sport brought forth in an enthusiastic, passionate, and never boring style. His \u201cVitale-isms\u201d have taken on a life of their own, with \u201cAwesome, baby!,\u201d \u201cGet a T.O., baby!\u201d, \u201cPTP\u2019er\u201d (primetime player), M&M\u2019er (a mismatch), \u201cDiaper Dandy\u201d (freshman star), and many more all becoming part of the vernacular.\n\n\u201cDick is one of a kind,\u201d said Pitaro, Chairman, ESPN and Sports Content. \u201cHe has embodied the spirit of the Jimmy V Award for Perseverance his entire career, and his fight against cancer has been no different. He has taken his struggle as an opportunity to help others, to help people to understand the challenges and to remove the stigmas and false assumptions. It\u2019s fitting that we will present this award to him almost 30 years after he stood by Jimmy V\u2019s side on the ESPYS stage, and it is an honor to add Dick to the distinguished list of winners of this award.\u201d\n\nIn 2007, Women\u2019s College basketball coach Kay Yow became the very first recipient of the Jimmy V Award for Perseverance. Past recipients include Eric LeGrand, Anthony Robles, George Karl, Dick and Rick Hoyt, Stuart Scott, Devon and Leah Still, Craig Sager, Jarrius Robertson, Jim Kelly, Rob Mendez, Taquarius Wair, and Chris Nikic.\n\nThe ESPYS help to raise awareness and funds for the V Foundation for Cancer Research, the charity founded by ESPN and the late basketball coach Jim Valvano at the first ESPYS back in 1993. ESPN has helped raise over $165 million for the V Foundation over the past 29 years."}]}
