Since it first aired on March 23, 1987, \"The Bold and the Beautiful,\" with its addictive storylines, has remained one of the most-watched soap operas in the country, alongside \"The Young and the Restless.\" Both shows were created by the late William J. Bell and his wife, Lee Phillip (via IMDb).\n\nThroughout the soap opera's multiple decades on the air, it's won numerous awards, including a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Drama three years in a row from 2009 to 2011 (according to IMDb). Since its inception, Bradley P. Bell, who has served as the executive producer and head writer, talked about the soap's longevity, telling TV Insider, \"I would have never imagined what was in store ... It's been a fantastic journey and incredible experience for all of us. We would not be here if not for the invaluable support of CBS and our millions of fans around the globe for their loyalty and support.\"\n\nThe long-time running soap opera has made household names out of its casts, and while you may know about their on-screen romances, how much can you say you know about their real-life relationships? Here are the real-life partners of some of your favorite cast members of \"The Bold and the Beautiful.\""}, {"url": "https://www.nickiswift.com/1065329/what-the-bold-and-the-beautiful-original-cast-looks-like-today/", "page_content": "We may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\n\nAfter the breakout success of \"The Young and the Restless,\" CBS was itching for husband and wife show creators William J. Bell and Lee Philip Bell to develop another soap in the same vein, per SoapHub. Thus \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" was born. Set in the glamorous world of the Los Angeles fashion industry and centering around the Forrester and Logan families, the nonstop drama of the soap continues to hook fans, securing \"B&B\" as a daytime staple for over three decades. What started as the quintessential '80s daytime serial has evolved into a modern story-telling machine.\n\nIn March 2022, the series celebrated 35 years on the air. The show remains in the hands of the Bell family, with the son of the original creators, Bradley P. Bell, the head writer today. \"Thirty-five years ago, I would have never imagined what was in store ... Since our premiere in 1987, it's been a fantastic journey and incredible experience for all of us. We would not be here if not for the invaluable support of CBS and our millions of fans around the globe for their loyalty and support,\" Bradley told TV Line.\n\nAs of this writing, two original cast members remain since the show premiered in 1987. John McCook and Katherine Kelly Lang have been portraying the characters, Eric Forrester and Brooke Logan, since 1987. Let's take a closer look at how they and the other original cast members have transformed over the years and what they're up to today."}, {"url": "https://www.thelist.com/728765/the-best-crossovers-between-the-bold-and-the-beautiful-and-the-young-and-the-restless/", "page_content": "If you're a fan of either of the CBS daytime dramas \"The Young and the Restless\" or \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" (or both), then you know that the shows love to have characters crossover. Most recently, Kyle Abbott (Michael Mealor) and Summer Newman (Hunter King) went from \"The Young and the Restless\" to \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" in order to track down some dirt on fashion designer Sally Spectra (Courtney Hope) (via Soap Hub).\n\nTV Insider reported that the duo's 2021 appearance in Los Angeles was the first between the two soap operas since 2017. The two had hoped to take down Spectra, but considering they were in Italy while Spectra was working at Newman Media in Genoa City, it seemed that she may have gotten the short-term last laugh in that crossover. In fact, Spectra is one crossover that could end up being incredibly successful depending on how her story plays out on \"The Young and the Restless.\"\n\nWhile Abbott and Newman learned plenty about Sally's sordid past on their trip to Los Angles, it also led to a unique type of crossover when actor Don Diamont brought his \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" character \"Dollar\" Bill Spencer to \"The Young and the Restless,\" where he'd previously portrayed Brad Carlton. The sister soaps have had several other popular crossovers throughout the years. Read on to find out which characters were the best at switching from Genoa City to Los Angeles and back."}, {"url": "https://soaps.sheknows.com/the-bold-and-the-beautiful/news/647102/bold-beautiful-cast-says-goodbye-maggianos-restaurant-hangout/", "page_content": "Credit: Jill Johnson, Howard Wise/JPI\n\nWe \u201cwill miss them very much,\u201d Kimberlin Brown declared.\n\nBold & Beautiful\u2019s Deacon Sharpe stayed on the straight and narrow after taking a job at Il Giardino\u2019s, where he has worked his way up and out of the broom closet and into a modest apartment above the establishment. Hanging around his place of employment on a regular basis is his lover and roommate, the believed-to-be-dead Sheila Carter, who disguises herself in a red wig, glasses, and a prosthetic mask with pouty lips.\n\nSheila most recently came face-to-face with Young & Restless\u2019 Nikki Newman, who noticed her but didn\u2019t recognize her as the notorious madwoman who terrorized Lauren Fenmore, among others, in Genoa City. We\u2019re expecting Ms. Carter to become even more emboldened as a result and start hanging out with Deacon at work more often and taking even more risks.\n\nAs Il Giardino becomes Sheila\u2019s preferred lurking ground, her portrayer, Kimberlin Brown, was among the Bold & Beautiful cast members who gathered to say goodbye to their favorite restaurant.\n\nBrown, Katherine Kelly Lang (Brooke), and Matt Atkinson (Thomas) were among those who partied one last time at the establishment the cast had loved to patronize for years after work \u2014 Maggianos at The Grove, which is located right by CBS studios.\n\nMore: Krista Allen teases B&B guest star\n\nIn a video clip posted to Brown\u2019s social media, Katherine Kelly Lang explained that Italian eatery Maggianos is \u201cclosing their doors\u201d and lamented, \u201cWe\u2019re sorry you\u2019re leaving.\u201d She went on to say that they\u2019ll \u201chave to find a new place to hang out after work.\u201d\n\nAtkinson video bombs Brown and Lang, popping up behind them, and asking what they\u2019re drinking.

Watch the clip to see the cast at the restaurant.\n\nKatherine Kelly Lang and Matthew Atkinson both shared Brown\u2019s clip in their Instagram stories, and we had to wonder if Atkinson was still feeling a touch of the effects of the tequila when he shared the hilarious post below, which was billed as \u201canother \u2018how to'\u201d for Bold & Beautiful co-star Scott Clifton (Liam).\n\nClifton\u2019s reply was, \u201cfuriously scribbles notes\u201d and Clifton\u2019s wife, Nikki, laughed, \u201cOmg that strut.\u201d\n\nMore: B&B character\u2019s world about to be rocked\n\nWe love to see the Bold & Beautiful cast having fun!\n\nChicago Fire fan?

Steffy \u2013 unsuccessful in trying to talk her cousin down \u2013 is nearly killed by Aly with a tire iron, which Steffy kills Aly with in self-defense when she tries to bludgeon Steffy with a rock. Adding to the trauma, a resentful Ivy (a witness to Aly's death, who ends up making veiled accusations that Steffy murdered Aly note Steffy, who initially blocked out the self-defense killing in shock, told a police officer on-scene that Aly died after tripping and falling on a rock , not knowing the real story) decides to use a cell phone video she taped of Aly's killing (which makes Steffy appear as the aggressor) to blackmail Thomas into making her a lead model of the \"California Freedom\" fashion line (under the guise of trying to honor Aly's legacy by trying to keep the line from becoming \"overt\" \u2013 sexualized \u2013 than if Steffy was in it), in exchange for her silence. Insisting that Steffy lied about the self-defense claim, Ivy even chastises Wyatt (whom she catches trying to delete the video upon Steffy's urging) for \"siding\" with Steffy's account, forcing him to back down when she expresses her own loneliness. The fact Ivy even used blackmail to keep the tape under wraps from the police was even Lampshaded by Ivy as being out-of-character for her. Then after the video is deleted, during a confrontation with Ivy over her kissing Thomas while still dating Wyatt (resulting in Wyatt breaking up with Ivy), Steffy accidentally electrocutes Ivy on a broken electrical panel, resulting in Steffy being slapped with a restraining order; she then accidentally injures Ivy again on the staircase during an argument over her feelings for Liam as Ivy prepares to return to Australia. So to summarize, she nearly gets killed by one cousin, kills said cousin in self-defense, and is blackmailed by another cousin, whom she nearly kills by accident twice.\n\nProbably the most notable example is losing Finn, and then being led to think he died, something she never had happen with her previous lovers. Steffy began to show signs of being broken by this after her parents received a phone call that she had checked into a mental health facility in Monte Carlo. Justified due to thinking Finn was killed, and even after learning he was alive and reuniting with him, she's still irrevocably damaged as a person from the entire incident.\n\nBreak-Up Bonfire: Bridget does this after finding out that her husband Deacon has been sleeping with her mother and gotten her pregnant. She takes particular glee in throwing his ashtrays into the mix\u2014\"Kissing you was like licking one of these! I HATED it!\"\n\nThe Bus Came Back: After being gone from the show for almost more than a month, Finn comes back into the show around the end of May in 2022, revealed to somehow have been alive the entire time thanks to Li .\n\nButt-Monkey: Thorne. Not only has Ridge overshadowed him for most of his life, but he's had to deal with Stephanie's obvious favoritism towards Ridge. The fact that he exposed Eric's plot to elope with Brooke wasn't enough to turn Stephanie away. He's also repeatedly accused (primarily by Ridge) of being an idiot and a loser with no original ideas. He's often had to gain strength from the women in his lives \u2013 Macy, Darla, and Taylor \u2013 in order to stand up to Ridge or fight for his place at Forrester Creations. He even initiates a physical fight with Ridge one time Ridge unnecessarily insults Darla.\n\nCain and Abel: Ridge and Rick, just who is the Cain and who is Abel varies depending on the applicable storyline. There are moments of civility between the two, but Rick's feelings of being The Unfavorite in Eric's eyes when compared to Ridge contributed to their rivalry.\n\nCalling the Old Man Out: At one point Brooke had gotten pregnant by Eric (eventually giving birth to son Rick), and Eric wanted to get a speedy divorce from Stephanie without the latter finding out so he could marry Brooke. Ridge decided to go along with the plan to protect Brooke and her baby, but Thorne found the whole thing disgusting and ratted them out to Stephanie. Eric treated Thorne like he'd committed treason, and it was then that Thorne really let Eric have it about what he was doing. Not that it made any difference, because Eric followed through with his plan regardless . In recent years, this has pretty much qualified for all of Eric's children with Stephanie when he's caught in an affair with another woman.\n\nCeleb Crush: Brooke fell in love with Ridge when she saw him in a magazine, and she helped her mother cater a high-end LA party because she knew Ridge would be there and she wanted to meet him.\n\nCharacter Outlives Actor: The late Darlene Conley's Sally Spectra. Played straight when Michael Fox, who played Sally's friend and employee Saul Feinberg, died in 1996.\n\nCitizenship Marriage: While the main goal was to help her stay in the country, Thomas and Gabriella might be the only example of this trope where the couple in question was genuinely in love with each other (rather than one half of the couple being in love with someone else or neither being attracted to the other) and had to convince the INS that their Fourth-Date Marriage was for real.\n\nConvenient Miscarriage: After manipulating things to get pregnant with Ridge's baby (she was desperate to replace the child Stephanie forced her to abort years ago), Morgan has a Tragic Stillbirth following an argument with Ridge's wife Taylor and falling over a balcony, thus eliminating the couple having to deal with a permanent reminder of his infidelity.\n\nCool and Unusual Punishment: Steffy and Hope's response when they find out their mothers have gotten into, of all things, a Food Fight, ruining Hope's wedding cake? Make them both walk out into the reception and tell everyone what they'd done. Without giving them a chance to clean up first.\n\nCrossover: Most prominently with The Young and the Restless. Characters from Genoa City like Sheila and Ashley Abbott show up in L.A. to be new love interests. In the June 17, 2009 episode, Pam and Donna wind up in the audience of The Price Is Right; Donna winds up being picked to play on the show and wins big on the next day's episode.\n\nDead Guy Junior: Several babies on this shown have been named after deceased relatives and/or friends (and even more have been named after living ones). Mary Warwick was named after her dead grandmother, the new Caroline Spencer was named after her aunt who died of leukemia, and Alexandria Forrester, who was conceived in an adulterous affair between her father and his then wife's best friend, was named after the betrayed wife...\n\nSubverted with Steffy Forrester, who was named after her grandmother Stephanie, who had just suffered a potentially fatal stroke at the time of Steffy's birth. However, the elder Stephanie miraculously survived.\n\nAnd the fashion house Spectra has been revived, with younger namesake versions of the previous employees\u2014Sally, Saul, Darlita (for Darla).\n\nDomestic Abuse: The 2019-2020 Thomas storyline is not subtle about depicting the many forms of abuse, showcasing everything about how abusers manipulate their victims into staying with them through false promises of love and moments of affection, convincing their victims to stay with them no matter just how many horrific things they're willing to do. The show is very careful to make it clear that Hope is not to blame for feeling the ways she does at all.\n\nDouble Standard: Rape, Male on Male: Averted. In the early '90s, the show launched a groundbreaking storyline when Jake, Felicia's boyfriend, came to grips with the fact that he'd been sexually abused by his uncle as a child.\n\nEasily Forgiven: A lot of men and women in the show are forgiven in a short period of time for affairs, most particularly Brooke. Bridget swore she would never forgive Brooke for sleeping with her then-husband Deacon, but they were back on speaking terms within a short period of time. Also, Stephanie is quick to forgive Eric for his affairs when they end and he begs her back.\n\nTaylor really nails this trope with Thorne though after she accidentally killed his wife Darla . Thorne forgave her enough to the point that he entered into a relationship with Taylor and almost married her, but his daughter Aly's outrage over the relationship stopped him from going through with it.\n\nEven Evil Has Standards: Justin is willing to let Bill and Liam rot in prison for a crime he knows they didn't commit, even kidnapping and imprisoning Thomas to do it, but when Ridge confronts him as a scared father looking for his son, his conscience gets the better of him. Unfortunately, it's just a moment too late, since Thomas already escaped on his own .\n\nEveryone Has Standards: As much as Thomas hates Liam, he's still not willing to let him stay in prison for a crime he knows he didn't commit .\n\nEveryone Is a Suspect: When Stephanie was shot, everyone literally was a suspect because they all had reason to be angry at her. Storm did it.\n\nSimilarly, when Bill was shot. Tends to happen when you screw over everyone you come into contact with. Taylor did it.\n\nExpy: \"Dollar\" Bill Spencer, Jr. could easily be seen as this of Donald Trump; the two both are extremely wealthy self-made businessmen who have high opinions of themselves (even acknowledging they think they're good-looking with shameless confidence), have little if any filter when it comes to their actions (an example in Bill's case being his decision to out Maya as transgender in his magazine ) and can be very obnoxious.\n\nFlip Personality: In recent years, The Bold and the Beautiful's writers have had characters change personalities as the storyline dictates. In some cases where a Face\u2013Heel Turn or Heel\u2013Face Revolving Door is used, the character usually reverts back to their old personality later on: Maya Avant came to the canvas out of prison and ready to turn her life around. Then came Caroline Spencer, who conspired to keep them apart and eventually snagged Rick. In addition to becoming a rival to Caroline, she flips between a woman who wants to redeem herself and a Manipulative Bitch. She then is shifted towards more of a heroine role when she is revealed to be transgender .\n\n. Quinn Fuller's personality change is explainable through a plot point in separate storylines in 2014 and 2015. When her son Wyatt (who is revealed to have tried to deal with his mother's erratic behavior for years) begins dating Hope, whom his half-brother had been in an on-again/off-again relationship with, Quinn tries by any means to keep Liam from interfering, leading her to threaten to murder him and actually try to chop him with a machete! When Quinn returns after allegedly admitting herself in a mental health institution, she threatens Brooke to stay away from Deacon (whom Quinn had started seeing at the time), but doesn't go farther than dreaming of stabbing her in the stomach. After that storyline, Quinn has been depicted as still mischievous but quirky, rather than mentally deranged.\n\nWhen Aly Forrester was SORASed in 2014, she started as The Wallflower type. However, she seemingly had a Split Personality as she went from being a nice girl to mentally troubled and back, twice (the latter was due to her hatred of Taylor for running over Darla when Aly was a kid). Upon her second flip, she grew into The Resenter towards Steffy, channeling her hatred of Taylor towards her daughter, and descended into a violent behavior by attempting to murder Steffy with a tire iron and a rock, the former of which led to her death by Steffy. Again, this is explainable by way of her mental issues serving as a plot point.\n\nIvy Forrester started out as the Nice Girl when introduced in 2014; however, tied into she flipped to a Manipulative Bitch Resenter and persecutorial blackmailer as part of a Break the Cutie incident caused by Steffy \"stealing\" then-boyfriend Liam from her (although Liam later states that he chose to leave Ivy \u2013 whom he broke up with at Aly's funeral! \u2013 for Steffy on his own terms) and then killing their cousin/her best friend Aly in self-defense (though Ivy, who held a cell phone video she took of the killing over Steffy's head and used Aly's death as a means to get ahead in the company, saw it as murder). Ironically, of those who noticed something wrong with her, Quinn's Out-of-Character Alert toward her is the most telling, as she was surprised that Ivy started acting like a jerk (and not in a good way).\n\nIn the running for the show's most egregious example of the trope, Thomas Forrester. As an adult (as played by Adam Gregory and Pierson Fod\u00e9), Thomas was a standard Bad Boy Lothario, but the version played by Matthew Atkinson saw the character devolve into a full-blown sociopath for a time, fueled by an obsessive infatuation with Hope that developed amid his grief over the off-screen sudden death of Caroline from a blood clot hemorrhage in the Spring of 2019, causing him to rack up a large amount of amoral actions rivaling those any other soap baddie has committed in such a relatively short timespan. Over the last eight months of 2019 alone, he found out and hid the true identity of Liam and Steffy's adopted daughter Phoebe, who was really Hope and Liam's thought-to-have-been-stillborn daughter Beth, and manipulated multiple people involved in Dr. Reese's cover-up of the faked miscarriage (including Flo and Zoe) in order to prevent Hope from getting back together with Liam; manipulated and basically mentally abused his young son, Douglas, to get closer to Hope and to keep him from revealing the Beth secret; used Brooke accidentally pushing him off a cliff (an incident he survived) after she catches him manhandling Hope, during a failed effort to convince Hope to forgive him for keeping Beth's identity a secret, to drive a marriage-ending wedge between Brooke and Ridge, whom he manipulated into believing he's changed; faked death into a vat of acidic chemicals during an incident with Hope, leading her to briefly believe that she accidentally killed him; tries to coerce Hope into having sex with him in exchange for receiving custody of Douglas; drugged Liam and planned to drug Hope; and... oh yeah... caused a vehicular homicide by running Emma off the Pacific Coast Highway to keep her from revealing the truth about Beth. Along with the mental health issues related to Caroline\u2019s death, it is later revealed that his behavior and hallucinations were also caused by bleeding in his brain that necessitated surgery.\n\nFrame-Up: In an effort to drive Thomas and Hope together, Vinny ends up framing Liam for his own suicide by jumping in front of his car .\n\nGood Adultery, Bad Adultery: Brooke tends to justify her flings as being part of her 'destiny', though Ridge seems to be the one she considers her soulmate. Also, all of the women Eric has affairs with (and ends up leaving Stephanie for) throw this excuse in Stephanie's face, citing her neurotic control smothers Eric and that she needs to let him go. Yet, once these relationships end, Eric will go crawling back to Stephanie and beg her forgiveness. Lather, rinse, repeat.\n\nGood Girls Avoid Abortion: Three of Brooke's pregnancies were under circumstances where an abortion would have been the most logical choice (conceived during an extramarital affair and her pregnancy would have destroyed the couple's chances at reconciliation. The third one was also complicated by her advanced age). But in all three cases, she chose to have the baby, and in all cases (even with her miscarrying the third time), the inevitable damage was done.\n\nGood Is Dumb: Enforced under Bradley's direction, given that it's pretty much the only thing that allows Sheila to stay on the show and move any plot involving her along.\n\nGeneration Xerox: The Brooke, Ridge, and Taylor Love Triangle has pretty much been transposed to Hope, Liam, and Steffy, with Brooke being the best analog for Stephanie. Irony! Not only that, Hope is the \"Good Girl\", the opposite of her mother Brooke, while Steffy is the \"Bad Girl\", the opposite of her mother Taylor.\n\nHappily Adopted: Finn was adopted at birth, and while he would like to know who his biological parents are, he loves his adoptive parents very dearly and makes it clear he had a great childhood thanks to them. Things get messy when he finds out his biological parents are the ever-crazy Shelia Carter and his \"adoptive\" father, who had an affair with Sheila and hid it from his wife . However, even when he tries in earnest to get to know his biological mom and have a relationship with her, Finn still adores his adoptive mother Li. When he finally realizes just how unhinged and evil Sheila is, he cuts her out of his life and definitively chooses Li over her, asserting that Li is his true mother.\n\nHelicopter Parents: This trope is Stephanie. She frequently butts in on the personal lives of her children, and if Brooke is in a relationship with any of them she'll do everything in her power to convince whichever son it is to give up on her. This has also extended to other Logan women, like Donna. In recent years, both Brooke and Ridge have become like this with their own children. And when Taylor thought Thomas and Brooke had slept together she entered Stephanie-territory with her rage at Brooke, screaming at her to stay away from Thomas.\n\nHeteronormative Crusader: Aly Forrester grew into this, the result of her inability to cope with losing her mother Darla in a drunk driving accident when she was a little girl and her being mentally unhinged as a result (she actually sees and hears a floating image of her mother's head, for crying out loud!). It results in some serious Slut-Shaming against Steffy (Aly's grudge is really against Steffy's mother Taylor) and some not-as-overt judgemental behavior towards Maya, who, like Rick, treated her more like a servant after Rick took over at Forrester (though the fact that Maya's transgender also has something to do with it).\n\nHoist by His Own Petard: This relates to Stephanie's plan with Andy Johnson. At the time, Ridge was engaged to Ashley Abbott, but Brooke was trying to win him back. Stephanie liked Ashley and wanted Brooke to back off, so she hired Andy to seduce Brooke and show Ridge once again what a slut she was. Well, the plan completely backfired on Stephanie. Andy raped Brooke when seducing her didn't work, and Ridge was there to pick up the pieces and help her through it. Tending to her and helping her deal with her rape reawakened Ridge's feelings for Brooke and he dumped Ashley to be with her. Most of all, everyone turned on Stephanie when it was made known she had hired Andy.\n\nHypocrite: When Katie had an affair with Nick, her niece Bridget's husband, Brooke went into full Mama Bear mode and completely railroaded Katie for hurting Bridget. However, Brooke had also betrayed Bridget this same way. Twice. One of these times with Nick!\n\nTaylor is a pro at this as well. She constantly bashes Brooke for her many romantic entanglements, especially for dating more than one man from the same family and for getting romantically involved with her daughter's love interests. Taylor herself has been engaged to Storm Logan, has had a relationship with Stephen Logan, and has been romantically involved with Eric Forrester, Ridge Forrester, Thorne Forrester, and Rick Forrester (the last of whom was her daughter Phoebe's great love and Phoebe's distress over this led to the car accident which Phoebe died). It coming to incredible degrees in which she fully blamed Bill for the affair that imploded Liam and Steffy's marriage, even after Steffy accepted and took the blame for her part with grace and maturity, even fostering a familial relationship between her and Hope, that Taylor attempted to gun down Bill in cold blood, almost even letting Ridge be persecuted of the crime. Once again she evaded jail after Steffy begged Bill to not implicate Taylor for the crime, once again she got back on her high horse condemning and calling Brooke, Hope, and Bill horrible people, even as she made thinly veiled threats against the three.\n\nOnce again she evaded jail after Steffy begged Bill to not implicate Taylor for the crime, once again she got back on her high horse condemning and calling Brooke, Hope, and Bill horrible people, even as she made thinly veiled threats against the three. Ridge also, who spent decades flip-flopping between Taylor and Brooke, yet went ballistic if either of them even looked at another man\u2014he kicked Brooke to the curb over her kissing Grant and publicly humiliated her by publicly proposing to Taylor, and kicked Taylor to the curb over a one-night stand that happened over a decade ago and under duress.\n\nThe entire family is this when they refuse to attend Quinn and Eric's wedding, citing the many terrible things that Quinn has done\u2014and conveniently forgetting the terrible things that all of them have done. Eric gives them an epic \"The Reason You Suck\" Speech regarding this.\n\nBrooke always hated it when Stephanie meddled in her relationship with Ridge, and she has hated Taylor for years for stealing Ridge (more than once). The fact that Stephanie blatantly favored Taylor did not help matters. But Brooke meddling in Steffy's relationship with Liam, trying to push him towards her own daughter Hope, and at some points just straight-up refusing to give Steffy the benefit of the doubt in any given situation? Totally different.\n\nBrooke is also quick to condemn Steffy for sleeping with Bill, her husband's father, seeing it as a reason why her own daughter Hope should be with Liam instead. This is a bit rich when you remember that the only reason Hope exists is that Brooke had an affair with her daughter's husband.\n\nBrooke again, when she shames Quinn for cheating on Eric. Once again, Brooke has cheated on multiple partners, including Eric. With his own son, no less! She really has no place to judge anyone for infidelity.\n\nIt's All My Fault: Thomas ends up blaming himself for Finn's death , as the events that led to it were kicked off by him keeping a secret regarding Brooke's New Year's Eve kiss with Deacon in an attempt to get his parents back together. Notably, Ridge and Taylor, while furious with him, attempt to dissuade him of this notion to no avail.\n\nKinky Role-Playing: When they were together, Katie and Wyatt discovered they both had a taste for this, and frequently used costumes and characters for their romantic shenanigans. Which eventually led to a very awkward moment when Thorne showed up at Katie's house unannounced, and, assuming he was Wyatt, she answered the door in-character wearing a skimpy nightgown.\n\nKinslaying Is a Special Kind of Evil: Sheila shooting her son Finn in an attempt to kill Steffy is portrayed as especially heinous even by the standards of the show, with everyone, even the likes of Deacon, shocked and appalled by the act. If not for Li, Finn would have been Killed Off for Real .\n\nLarge Ham: Sally Spectra. Big, bold, and larger than life, Sally was never afraid to chew some scenery. Her niece and namesake are proving to be this too.\n\nLast of Its Kind: The Bold and the Beautiful became the last remaining half-hour daytime soap on American television in 2003, when ABC cancelled the General Hospital spin-off Port Charles.\n\nLaser-Guided Karma: Mike Gutherie receives this in the form of Sheila essentially leaving him to be her fall guy for the cops when he knocks Li out and frees Sheila from the bindings she was put in.\n\nLast Words: Caroline's final words to Ridge have been a driving force of the relationships on the show. Initially, she told him to marry Brooke because that was who she felt he belonged with, but her words keep getting retconned for storyline convenience. They can be either the former, or that she tells him to be with the woman who will make him happy.\n\nLighter and Softer: While not without drama or some genuinely sad or even scary moments, this show is, on the whole, noticeably more lighthearted than its sister show, with less serious storylines, more comedic moments, and its characters falling more on the lighter end of the morality spectrum. It's generally campier and more melodramatic, sometimes giving the impression that the writers and actors aren't taking this at all seriously, or have just decided to have as much fun as humanly possible with what they've been given.\n\nThe Loins Sleep Tonight: Played for drama in a 2021 storyline, in which Eric\u2019s issues with erectile dysfunction spur an affair between Quinn and Carter. After initially filing for divorce, Eric changes his mind and asks Quinn to come home, later confessing that he can\u2019t perform his husbandly duties. Although Quinn chose to stand by him and get him the medical help he needed, Eric insists that Quinn have her sexual needs met by Carter, while keeping Quinn around because of his fear of loneliness. Eric later asks Quinn to end the sex surrogacy arrangement with Carter, and discovers that Quinn may be the source of his issues (which she admits may be the case due to discord between them for her past misdeeds), when his issues don\u2019t occur while around Donna but not Quinn; several months later, it\u2019s revealed that Eric and Donna have been carrying on an affair behind Quinn\u2019s back.\n\nMalaproper: In reflection of their rivalry, Caroline Spencer intentionally mispronounced Maya's name on various occasions.\n\nThe Masochism Tango: Stephanie and Eric, in spades. Stephanie does something to make Eric angry or otherwise make his life hell. He leaves her, finding comfort in the arms of a pretty young woman. Age difference aside, he seems genuinely happy with said woman as opposed to the constant bickering with Stephanie. Despite this, sooner or later, he is inevitably drawn back to Stephanie and they eventually reconcile, only for the whole thing to start all over again in just a matter of time.\n\nMay\u2013December Romance: Quite a few. Eric and Brooke, Eric and Donna, Eric and any woman who isn't Stephanie or Jackie, Ridge and Bridget, Nick and Bridget, Jackie and Owen, Rick and Taylor, and more recently Ridge and Caroline (Spencer).\n\nMinor Flaw, Major Breakup: In 1994, Taylor had a one-night stand with a man named James both while she was separated from Ridge and while they were trapped together after an earthquake, believing that they would die any moment. This remains a secret until 2006, a year after Taylor comes back from the dead. Brooke finds out about the fling and after repeatedly throwing it in Taylor's face and almost blackmailing her with it, the truth is made known to Ridge. Ridge reacts to a fling Taylor had twelve years prior while they weren't even together and occurring under extreme duress as though she were committing adultery in the present and immediately dumps her with the intention of hooking back up with Brooke. His treatment of her becomes even more despicable when you recall that he cheated on her with Morgan \u2013 in addition to years of ignoring Taylor's complaints about Brooke's constant interference. Double Standard, much?\n\nMonochrome Casting: One of the most shameful examples ever, as the show is set in Los Angeles, yet in the first 25 years of its run, the amount of minority characters could be counted on one hand. The show got better about this in 2015, with the expansions of existing African-American character Maya Avant's family (with younger sister Nicole as a regular, and parents Julius and Vivienne as recurrings) plus the return of Zende Forrester Dominguez, an orphan adopted from Africa by Kristen Forrester and her husband Tony Dominguez 13 years earlier, all of whom are joined by fellow existing black character Carter Walton.\n\nMurder in the Family: In a 2022 storyline, Sheila fatally shot Finn, her biological son and Steffy\u2019s husband, while intending to kill Steffy for trying to keep Sheila from forging a mother-son relationship with Finn due to her history of duplicity toward Steffy\u2019s family. (This, after Steffy overhears Thomas talking to Sheila about her plan to break up Brooke and Ridge and drive the latter towards Taylor by sending a bottle of champagne \u2014 purposely mislabelled as non-alcoholic \u2014 to recovering alcoholic Brooke, a revelation that spurs their confrontation in the alley of Il Giardino, where Finn arrives after finding out about Sheila\u2019s deed and Steffy going to confront his mother about it.) Sheila subsequently shoots Steffy and leaves her for dead to keep her from calling 911 about the shooting, though Steffy survives and is left with short-term memory loss, while Sheila is nearly Driven to Suicide out of both guilt for accidentally killing her son and fear of being caught. Steffy later pieces together the events of that night, and convinces Ridge and Taylor to set up a sting operation with police to get Sheila to confess her role in the shooting (which also leads to Steffy remembering Sheila\u2019s role in the champagne incident that led to Brooke kissing Deacon while inebriated on New Year\u2019s Eve), leading to her arrest.\n\nNever My Fault: Sheila Carter's modus operandi is her absolute refusal to ever accept blame for any of the heinous acts she's committed. The prime example is when she shoots Finn while trying to kill Steffy, as she insists to the end that it's truly Steffy's fault he's dead even though Sheila pulled the trigger .\n\nThe Nicknamer: Sally Spectra. She would usually give other characters at least one nickname, sometimes more. Clarke became Bucky, Darla became Einstein (and her daughter Alexandria later inherited that nickname), Massimo Marone became Mojo and Stephanie Forrester was usually called some variation of a royal title like The Queen Bee, Queen Stephanie, Highness, Queenie, and so on.\n\nNever My Fault: Plenty of characters, but Sheila in particular. No matter what horrible things she did, she always blamed someone else\u2014namely Stephanie\u2014either for her actions or for whatever punishment she received.\n\nNot Blood Siblings: The show entered squicky territory when it decided to pair Ridge and Bridget up together, shortly after it was discovered that they weren't half-brother and-sister, never mind that for years they had believed themselves to be, and that before that he had thought he was her father. Thankfully the storyline fizzled out before they went too far.\n\nSimilar reactions came from trying to pair half-siblings (kinda) Hope and Thomas up. Though Hope isn't related to Ridge by ancestry, she still calls him father and the whole thing raised the eye-brows of fans.\n\nAlso, the brief attempt to pair CJ, Macy's brother (they shared a mother), with Kimberley, Macy's sister (they shared a father). Even CJ had to keep reminding Kimberley that despite sharing a sister, they were not related.\n\nOedipus Complex: Inverted, in what some psychologists have termed \"The Jocasta Complex\". Stephanie was so obsessed with Ridge that several people outright suggested that she's in love with her own son. Even favorite daughter-in-law Taylor got fed up with it when she finally realized that the real reason Stephanie had always supported her over Brooke in the battle over Ridge is that Taylor reminded Stephanie so much of herself that she figured that since she herself couldn't sleep with Ridge, she'd settle for him being with someone just like her.\n\nOnly Mostly Dead: In a 2022 storyline sometime between Spring and Summer, it is revealed that Li somehow saved Finn from Sheila's assassination attempt on Steffy, and that Sheila had attempted to stop Li from revealing the truth and kept him hostage in her home while keeping the entire world in the dark about the fact that he was alive .\n\nOnly Sane Man: Wyatt and Justin both qualify, though both are mostly loyal to Bill. Wyatt tries to stay out of the feuds that pop up around him and is hilariously annoyed by everyone's constant drama, but he will jump in and take a stand if something really matters to him. Justin, meanwhile, is similarly annoyed by his boss's shenanigans but tends to take a \"Whatever, as long as I get paid\" approach.\n\nOut of Focus: Given that it's a half-hour soap, and therefore is less able to fit as many storylines in one episode as the hour-longs, this happens from time to time. Particularly notable is the show's two remaining original characters Eric (John McCook) and Brooke (Katherine Kelly Lang), whose appearances began to decline in 2015, in favor of the younger characters.\n\nPlatonic Co-Parenting: One storyline has Hope proposing this to Thomas, so she can help raise his son Douglas. Thomas, having gone full yandere at this point and being fully willing to exploit Douglas to get what he wants, doesn't go for it.\n\nPlot Tumor: The Hope/Liam/Steffy triangle. Liam started out as a minor character and has grown to the point where his love life has become the sole focus of every other character on the show for an entire year and counting (September 2012).\n\nPolyamory: Discussed by Liam and Wyatt in a 2018 episode, when discussing Liam's eternal Love Triangle with Hope and Steffy. Wyatt asks Liam, if it were a feasible option, would he choose both of them? Liam denies wanting a \"harem,\" but Wyatt makes a pretty good case for it, pointing out that he loves them both, so something more non-conventional maybe wouldn't be such a bad idea.\n\nPrison Rape: While in a mental hospital for her various crimes, Sheila gets beaten up by two other prisoners. Their unpleasant appearance and demeanor, plus the way Sheila acts afterward\u2014taking a Shower of Angst\u2014are clearly meant to imply that they sexually assaulted her as well. Even if not, the whole sequence still gives off a Does This Remind You of Anything? vibe.\n\nPunch-Clock Villain: Played With with Bill's right-hand man, Justin. Justin does pretty awful things, but only because Bill pays him, and he even serves as a voice of reason from time to time. (Not that Bill listens to him, ever, but still.) That said, Justin does clearly care about Bill, and seems to genuinely regard him as a friend. When he eventually does betray Bill to try to take the throne, it ends up devastating both of them .\n\nRape as Backstory: Recent years have revealed this about Stephanie , which serves to more or less explain her neurotic behavior. complete with a very emotional scene where Eric and Stephanie confront her mother about the abuse she suffered.\n\nRape as Drama: Brooke is an unfortunate victim of this trope frequently. In the pilot episode, she's assaulted by a group of men and rushes home with her clothes in tatters. She's raped by Andy Johnson after the latter was hired by Stephanie to seduce her. Ridge also unintentionally raped her when he had sex with her while she was drugged. To his credit, he had no idea she was drugged and was horrified when he realized what he did. Whether or not he knew she was drugged, it doesn't change the fact that she made it clear that she wanted him to leave her house \u2013 and he didn't. There are fans who also believe Nick raped Brooke when everyone believed Ridge was dead and had sex with her while she was in a vulnerable state.\n\nCousin Jessica is assaulted by a masked man. It is revealed later that her assailant was her ex-boyfriend Sly, enraged that she turned down his marriage proposal and deprived him of the chance to get his hands on her money.\n\nTaylor is also attacked several times by a man who appears to have this intent towards her. She's able to fend him off in one instance and Ridge rescues her the second time.\n\nRidge's first wife Caroline was also raped.\n\nReal Life Writes the Plot: The 1994 Los Angeles earthquake was written into the show's storyline.\n\nThe 2020 COVID-19 outbreak caused a several-month filming break while the cast quarantined, leading to a brief Hand Wave when the show came back to air: Katie claims that they had to close up shop to build and organize a new warehouse.\n\nRedemption Equals Death: Storm pretty much dug his own grave when he shot Stephanie and didn't show any remorse for it. When he accidentally shot Katie \u2013 his little sister who had a heart condition \u2013 he was so overcome with grief that he committed suicide in order to donate his heart to her and save her life. His sacrifice paid off because the heart took in Katie.\n\nRight-Hand Hottie: Darla to Sally. Darla was fiercely loyal to both Sally and Macy to the extend that though she was generally a quiet woman she would stand up for them no matter what.\n\nSadistic Choice: Steffy is blackmailed into letting Sheila go free by Bill, with the threat of throwing Taylor in jail for shooting him if she keeps Sheila locked up.\n\nSecond Love: It's a tossup as to whether Brooke or Taylor is this to Ridge following the death of first love Caroline.\n\nSecret-Keeper: Brooke is the only one who knows that Taylor shot and almost killed Bill Spencer - she willingly keeps the secret because she got to watch Taylor getting on her knees and begging her to keep the secret, and seeing her Arch-Enemy willingly debasing herself like that was enough for her .\n\nSeries Continuity Error: This frequently happens when characters are SORAS'd, but a glaring example of this is the Logan sisters' childhood angst. In recent years they've claimed Parental Abandonment and that oldest brother Storm practically raised them. But earlier episodes clearly show the Logan family to be a happy and stable family unit. This also included Steffy and Phoebe. For many years these two were known as identical twin sisters and were even played by identical twins during different SORAS periods. When MacKenzie Mauzy was cast as Phoebe though, the show didn't bring Steffy on until much later, with Jacqueline MacInnes Wood playing her. Neither actress looks alike.\n\nSoap Opera Disease: Caroline developed leukemia, and in a rare Soap instance her character stays dead. Recently, Stephanie was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer, and made a complete recovery (at least for a little while; the cancer returns to kill her in 2012).\n\nSoap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome: All of the children at one point or another. In fact, the show has had very few high school-aged characters over the course of its run (unusual for a modern-day soap), as even many of those that have been aged rapidly have been pushed to at least 18 to advance the Forrester Creations-centered storylines.\n\nThe Starscream: Of all things, deconstructed - Justin makes moves to leave Bill and Liam in prison for a crime he knows they didn't commit, but his conscience gets the better of him just a minute too late. When Bill finds out, their friendship permanently breaks, and it clearly hurts both of them dearly .\n\nSurprisingly Realistic Outcome: The first time Eric pursued Taylor, she listed a lot of reasons it was a bad idea. . .and stuck with it, rather than a typical soap storyline of her throwing caution to the wind and embarking on a relationship with him anyway.\n\nThe 2019-2020 storylines have repeated many of the adultery/Love Triangle storylines the show has used before (a fact that many soap operas are guilty of, not just this one). Until this point, each repeat storyline was like the previous ones had never happened. Recently, characters are starting to call each other out for having this predictable behavior, specifically calling out the fact that they constantly show regret over their actions and then willingly repeat it over and over again, which is what would happen if people willingly put each other through a Masochism Tango for 15-odd years straight.\n\nThis Is Unforgivable!: Stephanie is on the receiving end of this, including: when she sabotaged Donna's debut at Forrester Creations, when she exposed Jackie's prostitute past in front of the media, and most prominently when she inadvertently caused Brooke's rape at Andy's hands. Taylor is also on the receiving end of this. Ridge gave her this treatment over her fling with James, and even Nick treated her this way when she spoke honestly at Brooke's custody trial, after she begged the other woman to not be called as a character witness on her behalf. Then again, anything Taylor remotely does that's similar to what a Logan woman does is treated with long-term contempt, while the Logan women usually get off scot-free.\n\nTickle Torture: During a Black and White Dream Sequence in one episode, Quinn imagined that she has Hope tied down to a chair in her loft, surrounded by large pictures of herself. The leather-clad Quinn tells Hope that she loved her and her baby and wants to hear her say it in return. To get her to say it, Quinn tickled Hope\u2019s arms and neck with a feather wand as Hope twitched and protested. \"I love you, Mama Quinn, and I want you to be a part of my family\", Quinn instructed Hope to repeat. Hope, agonizing beneath the tickling wand until she could take no more, repeated the phrase back to Quinn.\n\nToken Good Teammate: The second generation of Spectras aren't evil, but Coco is the only one who's 100% committed to keeping things on the level. Though Sally is now trying to change that and is trying her hand at being good, too.\n\nTook a Level in Kindness: Steffy notably became much kinder and more morally conscience when she had her first son with Finn. Since almost losing him, she's essentially become one of the more upstanding characters on the show.\n\nTyrant Takes the Helm: Rick Forrester during his relatively short tenure as CEO of Forrester Creations. He treated many of his employees \u2013 particularly Ridge, Ivy and Aly note who's mistreatment and placation by Rick, who waited on him hand and foot on a false promise that he'd greenlight her shoe line, plays a limited role in the mental downfall that led to her trying to murder Steffy, as Rick later blames himself for exacerbating \u2013 like worthless peons; Ridge actually quit briefly, unable to take the mistreatment, and makes a failed attempt to get Eric to oust Rick and appoint him CEO as his stepfather was willing to overlook Rick's jackassery on account of him helping increase Forrester's revenue with his ideas. It leads to a successful takeover by Ridge, Liam and Steffy (the latter of whom originally wouldn't go forth with the plan unless getting back together with Liam, who was dating Ivy at that time and wanted to take over the company to save her from Rick's tyranny, was part of the deal) to get rid of Rick.\n\nTrauma Conga Line: This is a soap, after all.

At one point, someone shoots and almost kills Bill Spencer - while he does survive, he never saw the attacker, meaning no one knew who did it. It also didn't help that by the time he was shot, Liam, Wyatt, Justin, Steffy, Ridge, and all of Sally Spectra's team had motive to attempt to kill him. The evidence originally suggested Ridge, but it turns out to have been Taylor, who had previously been out of town and thus had been unsuspected .\n\nWho's Your Daddy?: Brooke was so sure that Bridget was Ridge's child that she named the baby Bridget \u2013 which is a combination of Brooke and Ridge's names. However in actuality she wasn't sure who Bridget's father was but wanted Ridge to be her father. It turned out that Eric, Ridge's father, and Brooke's former husband, was Bridget's father.\n\nYandere: Bill Spencer evolved into one for Steffy. He just couldn't listen to her when she told him that their relationship was over, and did a lot of awful things to try and gain her love. And, in true Yandere fashion, it didn't occur to him that if he wants to win Steffy's heart, repeatedly showing up at her house even after she told him to get lost, trying to break up Steffy and Liam, and blackmailing her maybe wasn't the way to go about it.\n\nYou're Not My Mother: Finn adopts this stance against Sheila after she shoots him, confines him to a bed and holds him hostage, and leaves everyone to think he's dead ."}, {"url": "https://www.cbs.com/shows/the_bold_and_the_beautiful/cast/216166/", "page_content": "Biography\n\nMatthew Atkinson portrays the prodigal son, Thomas Forrester, on The Bold and the Beautiful.\n\n\n\nAtkinson made his television debut on the WB/CW drama One Tree Hill.

When he came clean about his theft to Jill, she agreed to make a forgery to give to the criminals instead.\n\nBut Colin was still shady, and when he found out that Devon Hamilton and Hilary were having an affair, he blackmailed Devon for millions of dollars to keep his mouth shut.

Over the years, Benard has been very open with his struggles with mental illness while becoming an advocate and shedding light on mental health through his You Tube series, State of Mind, his autobiography Nothing General About It: How Love (and Lithium) Saved Me On and Off General Hospital, and his numerous talk show and personal appearances.\n\nIn the early part of 2022, GH\u2019s Sonny was on a downward spiral, off his meds, and in the throes of having his relationship with Carly (Laura Wright) hit the skids, while turning to Nina (Cynthia Watros) for comfort, help, and much more. Those moments and others, gave Benard powerful scenes to play, and it landed him a Daytime Emmy nomination this year in the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series category. This marks the 10th time Maurice has been nominated. He has already racked up three Lead Actor Emmys previously: in 2003, 2019, and 2021.\n\nMichael Fairman TV chatted with the popular star to get his take on: what this Daytime Emmy nomination means to him, how he sees the category in which he is included with four other talented actors, and how he hopes his road, and Sonny\u2019s road to a better emotional place has helped others. We also reminisce on Maurice\u2019s seismic first Emmy victory at Radio City Music Hall in 2003, and the lessons he\u2019s learned for himself along the way, and come Emmy time.\n\nMake sure to watch the 50th annual Daytime Emmy Awards on Friday night June 16th live on CBS (9 pm EST) and streaming on Paramount+. Now, here\u2019s what Maurice had to say.\n\nCongratulations on this Lead Actor Emmy nomination. I understand that you submitted scenes dealing with Sonny\u2019s battle with bipolar disorder. Can you tell me what was on your reel?\n\nMAURICE: First, I have scenes with Michael (Chad Duell) where Sonny wants to reconcile with him, and we talk about how many people have died. You can tell something\u2019s off with Sonny. Then, he has scenes with Carly, where Sonny wants to get back with her and she didn\u2019t want to, and then he\u2019s very emotional, and he leaves, goes to the nightclub and he\u2019s manic. I love those scenes. He goes home with Nina and she has to deal with someone who\u2019s manic. Those scenes happened earlier in the year, and I think it was kind of forgotten about, but I felt really good about them, plus it was dealing with bipolar disorder. So, I\u2019m very proud of the work and the writing was phenomenal.\n\nThere is this scene where Sonny is sitting with Nina on a bench and he leans his head on her shoulder admitting he needs help. Is that on the reel?\n\nMAURICE: Yes, that\u2019s at the end of my reel.\n\nI remember when I saw it. It was an episode that aired at the end of January of 2022. I wrote it up and I gave props to you and Cynthia, because that was such an amazing scene. Sonny was really lost and off his meds, and Nina had never seen him like this and didn\u2019t really know what to do.\n\nMAURICE: Yeah, he had grabbed her really hard before that on the wrist, and it scared her and scared him that he did that. Then, Sonny admitted right after that, he needed help. They sat on the bench and he was crying.\n\nSo, was that a difficult scene to play for you \u2026 or are those easy when you have to go into playing the manic-version of Sonny?\n\nMAURICE: Yes, but it\u2019s only hard in terms of what it does to me. I honestly think, if I didn\u2019t have a mental illness, I wouldn\u2019t have as much fear, because I don\u2019t want to have another anxiety attack. So, that\u2019s the reason when I do those scenes afterwards sometimes, I\u2019m feeling like, \u201cOh, God. Why did I do this?\u201d\n\nWasn\u2019t there a time years ago that you couldn\u2019t play those types of scenes at all?\n\nMAURICE: There was a time when I did a bipolar story where the show had it last too long. My wife called them and said, \u201cStop this already.\u201d I was hearing my mom and dad in the scenes, and I knew I was in trouble.\n\nBased on the subject matter of your reel, and where we are in the world today with mental illness, plus how you use your platform on \u2018State of Mind\u2019, this kind of would close the loop on your entire journey if you were to receive the Emmy this year.\n\nMAURICE: Yes, It would. I don\u2019t really anticipate trying to win Emmys and this and that. I\u2019m just so proud of the story, that after this I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll get this kind of story again.\n\nWinning the Emmy for these performances, would afford you the opportunity in an acceptance speech, to address mental illness.\n\nMAURICE: Yes! Look, the only thing that made me happy was getting things, and that\u2019s a false happiness. You have to find the happiness within yourself, then everything makes you happy. I couldn\u2019t do that for 58 years. Now, this is the first time I got nominated where my initial feeling was like a normal person. Of course, it\u2019s great to be nominated, but I don\u2019t get overly happy, because what happens is when you get overly happy or whatever, you\u2019re gonna fall if things don\u2019t go your way. So, this time I\u2019m feeling so good either way, but I would love to speak on mental illness. That\u2019s why I would really love to win.\n\nIt\u2019s all so prevalent and topical in society today what you are speaking about. In recent weeks, the news cycles have been talking about studies on loneliness that is gripping America right now. People are suffering from loneliness and depression. It has been difficult since Covid, and coming out of that, for so many people.\n\nMAURICE: Yeah, and I think now is the time that it\u2019s really getting tough because sometimes it takes a while for it to hit and kick in. They say after two years is when it kind of starts kicking in.\n\nAnd this nomination, like you just spoke to, is different. The last two times you were nominated and won was for the Alzheimer\u2019s storyline. Those were difficult for you to play too, because your dad was going through the same thing at the time. Correct?\n\nMAURICE: Yes. Anything I do that has mental illness or anything like that is very close to my heart. I was very proud of those two Emmys because of the Alzheimer\u2019s story and because my dad died of it.\n\nSo, what do you think about the actors nominated with you for Lead Actor? You\u2019ve got Peter Bergman (Jack, Y&R), Jason Thompson (Billy, Y&R) Billy Flynn (Chad, DAYS), and Thorsten Kaye (Ridge, B&B).\n\nMAURICE: I respect all those actors. I really do. I\u2019m not just saying that. I think they\u2019re all damn good actors. I watch their work, each of \u2019em. I remember, I watched Thorsten Kaye with Jacqueline MacInnes Wood (Steffy, B&B), and it was about drug addiction, if I recall, and they were just nailing those scenes. I watched Billy because he was on my show, State of Mind. Peter\u2019s always, you know, Peter, and Jason is Jason, you know \u2026fantastic! So, I\u2019m into it, man.\n\nWhen we had my annual Daytime Emmy Nominations Special last month, Jason shared he was stoked to be in the category with you. Did you mentor him at all while he was at GH?\n\nMAURICE: No, no, we just had great talks. I didn\u2019t do what I do with the younger actors. He was a little older, and he\u2019s a hard worker. Jason has talent and it\u2019s amazing. You know, I told him on the State of Mind that it\u2019s not easy to go from being popular in one role and then go to another show and be very popular also. That\u2019s not done very often. So, my hat\u2019s off to him.\n\nI also was talking with Finola Hughes (Anna, GH) and the two of you were all over mainstream press representing General Hospital for their 60th anniversary. How was it for you to go to New York and then do the all of the guest appearances in support of the show? I know it\u2019s hard for you to fly and you flew alone.\n\nMAURICE: Yeah, and I almost got off that plane, but thank God I didn\u2019t. It\u2019s amazing. I never thought I\u2019d get to a place where people talk to me as much about mental health as they do about General Hospital. I love it.\n\nSo, you have experienced walking down the street, for instance, and people stopping you to discuss mental illness over asking what\u2019s going down on GH?\n\nMAURICE: Yes. The driver that drove me to the airport, you know, it\u2019s just about mental health. Then, in New York on the streets. I love it, obviously, although it can be a little draining. I was just about to get on the plane and this guy was telling me his brother is bipolar, and he\u2019s worried he\u2019s going to commit suicide. I\u2019m thinking, \u201cOh, man.\u201d But, it\u2019s all good. I\u2019m proud of Sonny \u2026 I\u2019m proud of everything I do with mental health \u2026 State of Mind \u2026 and everything.\n\nI remember your first Emmy win in 2003 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. The fans were going crazy for you \u2013 it was so loud in there. The only other time I ever recall anything that loud was when Susan Lucci finally won her Emmy after 19 tries. The entire Felt Forum erupted. Do you remember going on stage to accept the Emmy, and where you were at that point in your life and taking that all in? Everyone was so excited and happy for you.\n\nMAURICE: That one felt like catching the ball in the end zone and we\u2019re all just celebrating. That was a different feeling. I will never feel that again, obviously, it\u2019s your first one. You\u2019ve been waiting 10 years and then \u2018boom\u2019 it hits, and it\u2019s at Radio City Musical Hall. I remember my dad was there. Then, the other two wins were a little more subdued, but the second win was difficult because I didn\u2019t have any speech prepared. I thought I was gonna lose for sure, because nobody picked me to win. So, I was like, \u201cI\u2019m good\u201d And then \u2018bam,\u2019 it happens. I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, man. I don\u2019t have a speech!\u201d\n\nAnd to your point, I asked all the nominees if they think it\u2019s better to have a speech prepared and or just wing it? How would you respond to that knowing what you went through?\n\nMAURICE: It\u2019s never good to wing it. Somebody said to me, \u201cWell, you didn\u2019t have a speech, but it was great.\u201d I said, \u201cBut you could still be great with a speech and it\u2019s not so hard on you.\u201d When you have a speech, at least you have stuff that you can say, and it\u2019s ready to go.\n\nAre you going to attend this year\u2019s Daytime Emmy ceremony?\n\nMAURICE: Oh yeah, I\u2019m all good. I\u2019m good, win or lose, I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m in a different place. I can have fun now and not feel nervous, or whatever, inside.\n\nThat\u2019s amazing. That has to be a relief where you don\u2019t feel that kind of weight coming down on you. I can only imagine that it makes you feel lighter, emotionally.\n\nMAURICE: There\u2019s no better feeling than where I\u2019m at inside my myself right now. I used to get nervous going to the supermarket, and I couldn\u2019t talk to people. I put my head down. It\u2019s such a different vibe for me now.\n\nHow did you find out you were Emmy-nominated this year?\n\nMAURICE: I found out, I think, on Twitter. It\u2019s not like it used to be for me, because I was more intense with it. You have to understand something. I was so crazy that the night before the nominations, I couldn\u2019t sleep. I didn\u2019t sleep at all. That\u2019s where I was, and then if I get nominated or not, I\u2019d have to go through that.\n\nI know we all want some form of validation. I mean, let\u2019s be honest. Of course, we all want to be validated for the work we do, especially in a creative industry. I think everybody would love to win an Emmy, but as you were figuring out in your journey, it did not define you.\n\nMAURICE: It\u2019s like my friend. He\u2019s a billionaire, right? I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s it like being a billionaire?\u201d He goes, \u201cListen, I\u2019ve been rich and I\u2019ve been poor. Rich is better.\u201d That\u2019s the way it is, right? Of course, you want to get nominated, then not nominated, but it\u2019s just a different feeling that I have now about it from what I used to have.\n\nI was so touched to see Sonya Eddy\u2019s (ex-Epiphany) name in the list of nominees for Outstanding Supporting Actress posthumously. I know you worked with Sonya over the years. What did you think about her receiving this nomination and what can you say about the loss of your colleague?\n\nMAURICE: Sonya was just a ball of happiness. I mean, she was always laughing, always smiling. We had a relationship where I\u2019d make her smile and then I\u2019d kid with her. She was just a beautiful, beautiful person.\n\nSonny and Epiphany would have some run-ins, but she fought with her feelings. She liked her friendship with Sonny, and even those he was a mobster, she found the good in him.\n\nMAURICE: Exactly. It was just sweet. It was just nice. And you know, that\u2019s the thing, in life sometimes only the good die young.\n\nLastly, the late Nneka Garland, former producer at GH, was so pivotal to these Emmy nominations and the reels, and working on them for the cast and the show. I know you worked with her for many years and her passing has been hard on everyone.\n\nMAURICE: That\u2019s a tough one. Nneka was very close to my wife, Paula. They talked all the time. It\u2019s sad, another one gone, and it\u2019s these people who are just good people. It\u2019s interesting what life brings, but it\u2019s part of life. Nneka cared for all of us at General Hospital.\n\nPlease note: Jackie Zeman (Bobbie, GH) passed away a few days after our interview with Maurice was conducted, which is why it was not addressed directly in this interview. However, Maurice did take to Instagram to share his grief on the loss of his beloved co-star, expressing: \u201cThis hit me really hard, a gut punch. I think because Jackie was such a sweet, delicate soul. And I got to know her really well in the later years, I just loved her spirit I keep telling people life is not fair, we just have to except what is. I will miss you, Jackie we all will\u271d\ufe0f\u201d\n\nWhat do you think about the scenes Maurice chose for his Emmy-nominated reel? Showing Sonny being manic and being off his meds? How Maurice hopes this potential Emmy win might afford him the opportunity to speak to others who live with mental illness?
