He is one of the early superstars of the 76ers franchise.

He is the Sixers' franchise leader in the number of games played, number of minutes played, field goals and points.\n\n#3 Wilt Chamberlain\n\nWilt Chamberlain\n\nWilt Chamberlain is a 13-time All-Star who is the only player to ever score 100 points in an NBA game. He was a 4-time regular season MVP and three of those came up consecutively during his time with the 76ers. Wilt Chamberlain won the Rookie of the year in 1960 and is one of the best centers of all time.\n\nStanding at 7 feet 1 inch, he dominated at the center position every time he touched a basketball. He was a 7-time scoring champion, 11-time rebounding champion and was also the assists leader in 1968. He also won the Finals MVP award in 1972.\n\nWilt has won two NBA championships.

The NBA has transcended because of Al. He has represented Philadelphia for 12 seasons in the NBA after being selected by the 76ers in the 1996 NBA draft with a 1st overall pick.\n\nAn 11-time All-Star, \"The Answer\" is known for carrying a mediocre 76ers to the NBA Finals in 2011. Though he could not win the title that year, he did not get swept by the Lakers. That Lakers team is one of the best teams in the NBA history and AI, with a very average team managed to win a game.\n\nAllen Iverson won the MVP award in 2011 after leading the league in points per game with 31.1. He is one of the best pure-scorers to ever play the sport of basketball. He was the scoring champion in four seasons and averaged more than 25 points per game for 9 consecutive seasons.\n\nAllen Iverson is the franchise leader in steals per game and 3-point field goals. Philadelphia 76ers retired his jersey No. 3 on 1st March 2014.\n\n#1 Julius Erving\n\nJulius Erving\n\nNo surprises here. It is Julius Erving who is #1 on this list. Erving, popularly known as \"Dr. J\" is the only player who has won the MVP award both in ABA and NBA. He was part of the NBA for 11 seasons and played in all those eleven years for the 76ers.\n\nHe played a huge part when the 76ers won the title in 1983 and started along with legends like Moses Malone and Maurice Cheeks.

(Craig F. Walker/The Denver Post) (Photo By Craig F. Walker/The Denver Post via Getty Images)\n\nPresently, the NBA is far different from what it used to be. Rule changes and play style all differ from the old era of basketball.\n\nHowever, one of the major differences between the two eras is playing through the season. While players take to load management today, the players of the past tried their best to play all 82 games. A prime example of this is Michael Jordan.\n\nJordan is one of the most proficient players to ever hold a basketball. The Hall of Famer is widely regarded as the greatest by many fans of the sport. While his on court abilities were always on point, his willingness to turn up at every game and compete added immensely to his greatness.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nHe did not lose that quality till the last season of his legendary career.\n\nvia Getty DATE: 10/20/01 PHOTO BY : JOEL RICHARDSON DIG MICHAEL JORDAN AND THE WIZARDS HOST NEW JERSEY NETS (Photo by The The Washington Post via Getty Images) | Courtesy: Getty Images\n\nFormer coach Stan Van Gundy pointed out this difference between Jordan and the current attitude of the teams.\n\nWATCH THIS STORY: NBA Stars That Shaquille O\u2019Neal Has Taken Jabs at: Donovan Mitchell, James Harden & Others\n\nMichael Jordan always showed up\n\nJordan was a true competitor during his time. One of his biggest positives was that he wanted to play and win all the games. Hence, seeing the superstar in every game back then was not a new thing.\n\nCurrently, teams look to rest players before playoffs or after a stretch of back to back games. Looking at this, Van Gundy pointed out how even in his last season, Jordan showed up for all games.\n\nHe said: \u201cChris Finch is absolutely right. Michael Jordan in his final year in Washington at 39 years old played all 82 games and averaged 37 minutes per game. If you bought a ticket to see Jordan you were going to see Jordan. It was a different world then.\u201d\n\nThis depicts the difference in mentality between the current and past players. Jordan played 9 complete seasons through his career. Another player who had a similar mindset to Jordan was Kobe Bryant. He would play through the pain and the struggle just for the fans who are there to watch him.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nWith most players taking rest today, there have been many instances where fans have been left upset as their favorite players sit out. This change in mentality could be hurting the NBA as the players take a voluntary rest despite being fit to play.\n\nIt depicts a big change as it is rare to see any player play all games in the season.

It was Jan. 7, 1972, when the Lakers beat the Hawks 134-90 to run the streak to 33 games before falling in Milwaukee two nights later.\n\nIn the 75-year history of the NBA, there have only been five 20-game winning streaks within one season, an indication of just how rare such a run is. To frame what it takes to put together something even close, consider the last two.\n\nThe 2015-16 Warriors started 24-0, and all they had was the best regular-season team ever, finishing 73-9. The 2012-13 Miami Heat won 27 in a row, and all they had was LeBron James at the peak of his physical powers as well as three other Hall of Famers (Ray Allen, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade) playing in perfect harmony.\n\nYet the 1971-72 Lakers, led by Hall of Famers Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West and Gail Goodrich (Elgin Baylor had retired nine games into the season, literally just before the streak began), posted a record that has remained relatively safe.\n\nHere is a look at some of the individual records that have stood and likely will stand the test of time as unbreakable, even 25 years from now when the NBA celebrates its 100th season.\n\nSeason\n\n\u2022 Wilt Chamberlain's entire 1961-62 season is essentially written in statistical concrete, never to be duplicated. He averaged 50.4 points per game, the highest ever -- and no one is close. Michael Jordan is the only player besides Chamberlain to average more than 37. Chamberlain averaged 39.5 shots per game, the highest ever -- and no one is close. No one else has averaged more than 30. Elgin Baylor once averaged 29.7, Jordan and Allen Iverson each averaged 27 once.\n\nAnother mark sure to stand forever is his 48.5 minutes per game average. He was never substituted out that season; he only missed eight minutes of one game after he was ejected in the fourth quarter. He reached an average of more than 48 minutes because he played seven overtime games. He was miraculously almost never in foul trouble, averaging a career-low 1.5 a game.\n\n\u2022 Rasheed Wallace's 41 technical fouls. Game 7 of the 2000 Western Conference finals lives in infamy in Portland because of controversial whistles. Wallace's relationship with officials went from bad to worse, and it played out the following season as he racked up a record 41 technicals on the way to 18 ejections. In 2006, the NBA put in new rules that called for suspensions once a player reaches 16 for a season, and it has probably iced Wallace's record for good. He's third all time in technical fouls with 317 over his 16 seasons, behind only Karl Malone, who had 332, and Charles Barkley, who had 329.\n\n\u2022 Walt Bellamy's 88 games. In 1968-69, Bellamy started with the New York Knicks and played 35 games. Then he was traded to the Detroit Pistons and, because of an unbalanced scheduling quirk, played 53 games there to reach 88 for the season. Players have played more than 82 games 41 times, most recently when Josh Smith played 83 in 2014-15 for the Detroit Pistons and Houston Rockets. Second to Bellamy is Tom Henderson, who played 87 games between the Bullets and Hawks in 1976-77.\n\nCareer\n\n\u2022 Moses Malone's 6,731 offensive rebounds. When you include his ABA numbers, it's 7,382. That's 2,500 more than second-place Artis Gilmore and 2,100 more than Robert Parish when looking at only the NBA numbers. He has the two highest offensive rebounding games in history with 21 and 19. The current active leader in offensive rebounds is Dwight Howard, who is still 2,600 behind Malone.\n\n\u2022 John Stockton's 15,806 career assists. Stockton led the league in assists nine consecutive seasons from 1987 to 1996. He is nearly 4,000 ahead of No. 2 all time, Jason Kidd, and 5,000 ahead of No. 3, Chris Paul. At 36 years old, Paul is averaging a league-leading 9.9 APG this season. He'd have to keep that up until he was 42 years old to pass Stockton. The former Utah Jazz legend owns the four highest assist seasons in history and seven of the top 10. He had 31 games of 20 assists or more. Stockton is also the all-time leader with 3,265 career steals, which is almost 600 more than Kidd at No. 2.\n\n\u2022 A.C. Green's 1,192 consecutive games. The run lasted 16 consecutive seasons with four different teams from 1986 to 2001. Green passed Randy Smith, who played 906 consecutive games from 1972 to 1982. The longest recent streak was that of Utah Jazz forward Joe Ingles, who played in 384 consecutive games from 2015 to 2021. Tristan Thompson played 447 consecutive games with the Cleveland Cavaliers from 2011 to 2017.\n\n\u2022 LeBron James' 1,067 consecutive regular-season games (and counting) of double-digit scoring. James started the streak in 2007 and has had a few close calls, including last season when he hit a 3-pointer to reach 10 points only after badly spraining his ankle in a game and then leaving for the locker room. Earlier this season, he left a game with an abdominal injury after scoring 10 points. James passed Jordan, who had the previous record of 866 consecutive games, in 2018. The only ongoing streak that was close belonged to James Harden, but that ended last season at 450 games after he had to leave a game with a hamstring injury. James has scored fewer than 10 points in two playoff games during the span, the last in 2014 when he scored seven points against the Indiana Pacers.\n\n\u2022 Hakeem Olajuwon's 3,830 blocks. Mark Eaton's record of 5.56 blocks per game in a season is far-fetched, too, but Olajuwon's number is enormous. He's more than 500 ahead of second-place Dikembe Mutombo, who is closer to ninth place than first on the list. To match Olajuwon, a player would need to play every game for 15 seasons and average 3.1 blocks a game. There are only three active players who have averaged 3 blocks in a season even once (Myles Turner, Serge Ibaka and Hassan Whiteside).\n\nGame\n\n\u2022 Scott Skiles' 30 assists. This record has already stood the test of time, as it's been on the books for more than 30 years dating to Dec. 30, 1990. He was stuck on 29 assists, the record held by Kevin Porter from 1978, for six minutes in the fourth quarter before getting the record dime with a minute to play. Skiles, who averaged 8.4 assists per game that season and later had a 20-assist game, scored 22 points that night (and the Orlando Magic scored a team-record 155 points in a win over Denver). The closest anyone has come recently was in 2017, when Rajon Rondo had a 25-assist game with New Orleans. Over the past 10 seasons, Rondo and Russell Westbrook are the only players to have more than 22 assists in a game.\n\nNBA Trade Machine Want to forecast where your favorite NBA stars could wind up?

The 60-year anniversary of this feat, accomplished March 2, 1962, is coming up, and there's an excellent chance the 100th anniversary will come without it being touched. Chamberlain had a 78-point game earlier that season (in a triple-overtime loss to the Lakers when Elgin Baylor put in 63 points) and two 70-point games the following year. The key was at the line, where he was 28 of 32. He was a career 51% free throw shooter, and it was easily the best-percentage free throw night for him in that magical season. Second-most ever, of course, were the 81 points Kobe Bryant scored in 2006 taking 17 fewer shots (46 to Wilt's 63). Since Bryant, Devin Booker is the only player to reach 70 in a game, still 30 points shy of Chamberlain's record.\n\n\u2022 Wilt Chamberlain's 55 rebounds. This happened Nov. 24, 1960, in a game Chamberlain later said was one of the most exhausting of his career. The opponent was Bill Russell and the Boston Celtics, who won by three points. It broke Russell's record of 51 rebounds set the previous season. Chamberlain and Russell have the 12 highest-rebound games in history. Only two other players have had 40 (Nate Thurmond and Jerry Lucas) in history. There have only been a few 30-rebound games in the past two decades, the most recent being one from Enes Freedom, who had 30 in a game last season. To put in perspective how unlikely this record is to be broken, there have been fewer than 50 instances of a team having at least 56 rebounds in a regulation game this season. The Jazz had 68 in a December win over the Hornets (Rudy Gobert pulled down 21 of them), matching the season high the Grizzlies set in a November win over the Kings (no Memphis player had more than 12)."}, {"url": "https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_per_g_career.html", "page_content": "Other Points Per Game Leaderboards\n\nOther Points Per Game Leaderboards\n\nNBA & ABA Career Leaders and Records for Points Per Game\n\nActive players are listed in bold\n\n* Indicates member of the Hall of Fame.\n\nRate statistic requirements"}, {"url": "https://aussiehoopla.com/shane-heal/", "page_content": "NICKNAME/S: Hammer\n\nBIO: Shane Heal was born in Melbourne (VIC), He attended Upper Yarra Secondary College and began playing basketball as a junior with the Nunawading basketball association. Heal recieved a scholarship to attend the Australian Institute of Sport (Canberra) in 2018. He spent two years year there and played for the program\u2019s state league team (1987).\n\nNBL EXPERIENCE\n\nShane Heal made his NBL debut with the Brisbane Bullets at 17 years of age. He scored 14 points in his first game.\n\nHeal averaged 15 points, 1.4 rebounds, and 2.2 assists in 27 minutes per game as a rookie, backing up starting point guard Darren Perry. Heal would earn the league\u2019s Rookie of the Year award at seasons end.\n\nShane\u2019s scoring punch off the bench propelled Brisbane to third on the ladder before they fell short to the Perth Wildcats in an elimination finals game.\n\nGEELONG SUPERCATS\n\n1989\n\nAt the end of the 1988 a group of local business men fought together to save the club, injected the team with some much needed financial assistance. The team was rebranded from Cats to Supercats Barry Barnes, who had been replaced by Brian Goorjian at Eastside Melbourne, was named head coach. Barnes had been a mentor to up and coming guard Shane Heal, who after winning Rookie of the Year with Brisbane, joined Barnes in Geelong for the 1989 season. The team was led by US born stars Daren Rowe (14.2 points, 2.5 rebounds and 5.5 assists), Aubrey Sherrod (14.2 points, 2.5 rebounds and 5.5 assists) and Jim Bateman (14.2 points, 2.5 rebounds and 5.5 assists). Heal (14.2 points, 2.5 rebounds and 5.5 assists) was impressive in his second year as a pro and Heal averaged 14.2 points, 2.5 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game. Geelong improved from going winless the season prior to a 5-19 record in 1989. Despite all of the off-court distractions.\n\n1990\n\nFor the second year in a row, coach Barry Barnes will start with a new-look squad, headed by Uni of California forward/centre Brian Vaughans. Other notable newcomers include John Dorge and Westside swingman Vince Hinchen.\n\nThe season didn\u2019t start well for the Supercats. Although Vaughns put up good numbers, 17.0 points, 12.0 rebounds, 2.5 assists, 2.0 steals and 1.3 blocks across four games, Geelong started the year 0-4. Vaughns was released prior to the next game, making way for explosive point guard Bobby Locke, who dropped 50 points, 3 rebounds, 2 assists and 5 steals in his NBL debut. While the addition of Locke brought a new level of excitement for Supercats fans, the team wasn\u2019t able to turn things around, losing the next three games before finally notching up a win against the Adelaide 36ers.\n\nWith Locke (31.6 points, 3.0 rebounds, 4.6 assists and 2.4 steals) leading the team in scoring, 19-year-old Shane Heal (22.4 points, 3.2 rebounds, 8.3 assists) delivering career highs in points, rebounds and assists and Daren Rowe (18.3 points, 10.0 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 2.4 steals and 3.2 blocks) leading the league in blocks, Geelong won more games this season (11 wins) than they had in the previous two seasons combined (5 wins).\n\nHeal would also be recognised as the league\u2019s Most Improved Player at season\u2019s end.\n\n1991\n\nIn 1991, Heal would average 23.4 points, 3 rebounds, and 7.8 assists as the Supercats finished in third place with a record of 17-9, their best result as a club since 1984. Playing alongside stars Bobby Locke, Daren Rowe, Vince Hinchen, John Dorge and a young Shane Heal, Griffin averaged 2.8 points and 1.9 rebounds. The team of \u2018overachievers\u2019 would fall short in the NBL elimination finals, losing to a North Melbourne squad featuring Scott Fisher and Paul Maley in three games.\n\nBRISBANE BULLETS\n\n1992\n\nIn 1992, Heal averaged 20.9 points, 2.8 rebounds, and 7.1 assists as the Bullets finished with a record of 12-12 and in venth place during the regular season.\n\n1993\n\nIn 1993, Brisbane replaced long time coach Brian Kerle with former Coach of the Year (1988) and 1989 championship winning coach Bruce Palmer. Under Palmers tutelage the Bullets finished the season winning 50% of their games (same as the previous year under Kerle) and made it to the semi-finals before being eliminated in two straight games by Dwayne McClain and the Sydney Kings.\n\nHeal averaged 17.8 points, 2.3 rebounds, and 6.5 assists for the season.\n\n1994\n\nIn 1994, Heal averaged 25.2 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 6.4 assists as the Bullets finished with a record of 18-8 and in Fourth place during the regular season.\n\n1995\n\nHaving lost to Adelaide in the quarterfinals the previous season, the Bullets re-tooled their roster prior to 1995. The early exit saw Brisbane revamp their frontcourt, releasing veteran forward Shane Froling and imports Dave Colbert and Andre Moore. Although Leroy Loggins, Rodger Smith, Robert Sibley and Wayne Larkins were retained from last season, coach Bruce Palmer set out to recruit a younger roster he could develop over the next 2-3 seasons. He signed Andrew Goodwin and Mike Mitchell (both from rival team Gold Coast), and added import Chris Munk as their replacements.\n\nJohn Rillie, who had just graduated from Gonzaga University, was a late addition to the team signed to back-up Heal.\n\nHeal (22.9 points, 2.5 rebounds, and 7.4 assists), Loggins (21.7 points and 7.5 rebounds), and Mitchell (20.9 points and 6.8 rebounds) would carry the team offensively, notching up 60+ points a game between them with Heal also adding 22.9 points, 2.5 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game. Additionally, promising young talent John Rillie finished the season with 13.0 points, 3.4 rebounds, and 3.9 assists per game and was awarded the NBL Rookie of the Year award but the \u2018new look\u2019 Bullets didn\u2019t fare much better than the old ones. Brisbane finished in fifth place with a record of 16-10 and would suffer elimination during the Quarterfinalsstage yet again, this time losing to North Melbourne (0\u20132).\n\nSYDNEY KINGS\n\n1996\n\nSydney went through a period of major change prior to the 1996 season. From 1989 to 1995, the Kings had been coached by Bob Turner and had established themselves as a powerhouse franchise, particularly off the court. Corporate sponsorship through global juggernauts like Coca-Cola and Reebok had assisted in the enormous growth of the brand resulting in numerous sell-outs at the Sydney Entertainment Centre.\n\nBut in 1995, the Kings struggled on the floor, failing to make the playoffs with a 10-16 record. And for a club that every year expected to not only make the playoffs but contend for a championship, that wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nBob Turner was replaced as coach by Alan Black, who had taken the Illawarra Hawks to the playoffs in 1993, 1994 and 1995 and was named NBL Coach of the Year in 1993 and 1995. Two foundation members of the Sydney Kings \u2013 Mark Dalton and Damian Keogh \u2013 were released from the club, as were a number of other players from the unsuccessful 1995 squad.\n\nBlack brought with him Illawarra power forward Melvin Thomas and also signed Tony Bennett, who had played 160 games for the NBA\u2019s Charlotte Hornets as the team\u2019 imports. 25-year-old Stephen Whitehead was looking for more playing opportunities after serving an \u2018apprenticeship\u2019 behind stars Andrew Gaze and Lanard Copeland at the Melbourne Tigers. But the key addition this year was owner Mike Wrublewski convincing Australia\u2019s Boomers guard Shane Heal to move Sydney and become the captain, leader and face of the franchise. Wrublewski even had the Kings swap their traditional purple and gold uniforms in favour of a black pin striped design as a way to signify a new direction for Sydney in the hopes of re-energising a fan base.\n\nSome addition by subtraction saw the Kings release Bennett during the pre-season and replace him with the high-flying excitement machine, Isaac \u2018Ice\u2019 Burton, out of Arizona State University. Burton (24.4 points, 6.6 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 3.1 steals) and Heal (23.3 points, 3.1 rebounds and 5.5 assists) formed a deadly combination in the backcourt. Up front, Melvin Thomas (20.9 points, 9.3 rebounds, 4.4 assists, 1.1 steals and 1.9 blocks) and Bruce Bolden (16.8 points, 10.4 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 1.8 steals and 1.1 blocks) were an unstoppable tandem, with both men adding toughness, rebounding and a deadly ability to knock down the midrange jumper.\n\nRight from the start, they got the old Kingdome rocking, with Heal dropping 20 points in the fourth quarter of an unforgettable comeback win in the season opener at home against the North Melbourne Giants.\n\nThat set the scene for an incredible first two months, with Sydney jumping to an 11-3 record, winning their first eight games at home and leading the NBL standings. In one amazing stretch, the Kings won nine straight games, averaging a remarkable 120.4 points per game over that span.\n\nThose wins included a 131-112 smackdown of the Gold Coast Rollers at the Kingdome with Shane Heal going for 35 points and seven assists and Melvin Thomas ringing up 26 points, 11 rebounds and four blocked shots; a 122-121 thriller over the Perth Wildcats in Sydney where three players scored at least 20 points and Thomas finished just two assists shy of a triple-double; and a 128-106 blowout of arch-rivals Illawarra as Isaac Burton dominated the hapless Hawks, going for 32 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists.\n\nUnfortunately, a mid-season injury to Heal slowed the team down, but when Shane returned, he led the Kings to wins in four of their last five games, taking them to a fifth-place 16-10 record and a playoff appearance.\n\nAnd while the Kings were unable to progress past the first round of the playoffs, going down 2-1 to the Canberra Cannons, it was still a season to remember. Sydney averaged 108.8 points per game in the regular season \u2013 the most points scored per game in a regular season in franchise history \u2013 and also set team records that have never been broken for regular season field goal percentage (51.6%) and three-point percentage (41.2%).\n\nBurton led the entire league in three-point percentage, was third in the NBL in steals and would go on to become the first Sydney King to win NBL Defensive Player of the Year. Heal would finish among the league\u2019s best when he earned selection in the All-NBL Second Team.\n\nAfter their 1996 elimination, the Kings would not make the NBL playoffs again until 2001, when they made it to the first round before being eliminated by the Townsville Crocodiles.\n\n1998\n\nAfter a single season in the NBA, Heal returned to the Kings in 1998. Heal had left Minnesota with two years still on his contract, but due to not enjoying the cold, lack of playing time behind Stephon Marbury and suffering a calf injury the week prior to opening round, he returned home.\n\nSince Heal\u2019s departure in 1996, the team had undergone a number of changes. Coach Alan Black was replaced by Bill Tomlinson. Hardworking Melvin Thomas and fan favourite Isaac Burton had been replaced by Matt Nover, a former NCAA Final Four centre better known as \u2018Ricky Roe\u2019 from the movie Blue Chips and a 19-year-old forward named Stephen Jackson who became the youngest import signing in league history.\n\nJackson had been the leading scorer in the 1996 McDonald\u2019s All-American Game, on a team that included future NBA All-Stars Kobe Bryant, Jermaine O\u2019Neal and Richard Hamilton. He\u2019d been headed to the University of Arizona but was ruled academically ineligible, throwing him into the \u201997 NBA Draft (while the Wildcats won the NCAA title without him), where Phoenix selected him in the second round. He failed to make the Suns roster and, instead, chose to play his first year as a pro in Australia.\n\nThe Kings had built themselves around a young core of Aussie talent which included Aaron Trahair, Matthew Nielsen, Stephen Whitehead and Scott McGregor.\n\nNover and Jackson got off to rocky starts. Between them, the imports had combined for just 36 points across the season\u2019s first three games. Jackson, who would later average 20+ points per game across numerous seasons in the NBA, had become the first import in NBL history to go scoreless in his debut game. Nonetheless, the Kings were rolling, with wins over Canberra, Newcastle and Melbourne firing them to an undefeated start.\n\nIn Round 3 the team travelled to Adelaide looking to keep their steak alive when late in the third quarter\u2026 disaster struck for Jackson. Attempting to block 36ers\u2019 star Kevin Brooks, Jackson landed awkwardly and broke his foot and would miss the remainder of the season.\n\nDuring round 6, after a 99-108 loss to the Wollongong Hawks (where Aaron Trahair dropped 40 points on 13 of 16 shooting), the Kings released Nover (7.7 points and 5.6 rebounds) and signed import Dave Simmons, who had been released by Newcastle and former Sacramento Kings big man Evers Burns.\n\nAfter six games, Simmons (6.5 points and 6.3 rebounds) was released as the Kings made room to sign former North Carolina State point guard Kelsey Weems and allow Shane Heal and Aaron Trahair to play more minutes at shooting guard minutes.\n\nThrough the multiple import changes and roster juggling, the Kings dropped ten of their next twelve games, missed the playoffs and finished in the tenth spot with a 12-18 record. Heal (20.9 points, 3.7 rebounds and 6.7 assists) would lead the team in scoring while rising star Nielsen continued to improve, boosting his numbers from 9.9 points and 4.9 rebounds in 27 minutes per game to 16.4 points and 8.3 rebounds in 34 minutes per game. During their short NBL stints, Weems (20.0 points, 4.9 rebounds, 5.1 assists and 1.5 steals) filled the stat sheet during his 12 games, while Burns (16.5 points and 9.4 rebounds) wasn\u2019t quite the player we saw in the NBA during his 22 games and Jackson ( 6 points, 0.5 rebounds, and 1 assists) went on to play 858 NBA games and win a championship with the San Antonio Spurs in 2003.\n\n2000/01\n\nHeal averaged 24.6 points and 4 rebounds, and 6 assists during a lacklustre season where the Kings limped home to a a fifth place finish with a 17-11 record.\n\n2001/02\n\nIn 2001/02, Heal averaged 24.2 points, 3.3 rebounds, and 7.5 assists as the Kings finished with a record of 14-16 and in ighth place during the regular season.\n\n2002/03\n\nIn 2002/03, Heal averaged 20 points, 2.9 rebounds, and 7.5 assists, playing a key role in the Kings rotation, helping the team finish reach a first place finish in the regular season with a 22-8 record.\n\nSOUTH DRAGONS\n\n2008/09\n\nIn 2006/07 Heal averaged 19.8 points and 2.7 rebounds, and 4.6 assists, and helped guide the Dragons to a seventh place finish in the regular season with a 15-18 record.\n\n2007/08\n\nIn 2007/08 Heal averaged 15.8 points and 2.3 rebounds, and 3.9 assists, as the Dragons finished in a third place with a 5-25 record.\n\nGOLD COAST BLAZE\n\n2008/09\n\nHeal averaged 15.9 points and 3 rebounds, and 5.7 assists during a lacklustre season where the Blaze limped home to a a tenth place finish with a 8-22 record.\n\nShane Heal played sixteen seasons across five NBL teams. This included the Brisbane Bullets, Geelong Supercats, South Dragons, Sydney Kings and Gold Coast Blaze. He averaged 20.6 points, 2.9 rebounds, and 6.1 assists in 440 NBL games.\n\nCAREER RANKINGS:\n\n\u2013 33rd in total games played.\n\n\u2013 10th in total points\n\n\u2013 5th in total assists\n\n\u2013 37th in total steals\n\n\u2013 25th in assists per game."}, {"url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/basketball/nba-history-5-players-with-the-most-30-points-per-game-seasons", "page_content": "For the majority of NBA players, reaching 30 points in a single game is a significant achievement. However, a handful of elite individuals possess the skillset to regularly produce huge offensive performances and have been able to average 30-points per game for an entire season.\n\nSteph Curry and Kevin Durant have both achieved the feat in recent seasons, while James Harden has averaged 30 in each of his past two seasons. However, it is incredibly difficult to average 30-points per game over an 82-game regular season, and only 10 players have managed to do it at least three times over the course of their careers.\n\nSo, here we will take a look at the 5 Players with the most 30+ points per game seasons in NBA history.\n\n70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now\n\n#5 Allen Iverson - 4 Seasons with 30+ points\n\nAllen Iverson is among the best pound-for-pound players in history (Picture credit: NBA.com)\n\nFollowing two wildly successful years at Georgetown University, Allen Iverson was selected by the Philadelphia 76ers with the first overall pick of the 1996 NBA draft. Iverson was named Rookie of the Year in his first year and quickly established himself as one of the most prolific scorers in NBA history.\n\nIverson averaged at least 20 points in each season between 1996 and 2007, and the 11-time All-Star managed 30+ points for the first time during his only MVP winning campaign in 2001. He also accomplished the feat the following year and went on to do it a further two times in 2005 and 2006.\n\nIverson's highest points average came during the 2005-06 season, although his 33 points were not enough to win the scoring title for the fourth time as Kobe Bryant averaged a remarkable 35.4 points per game.\n\n#4 Adrian Dantley - 4 Seasons with 30+ points\n\nAlvin Dantley is among the NBA's forgotten superstars\n\nDuring 15 seasons in the NBA, Adrian Dantley scored 23,177 points, posted an absurd .540 field-goal percentage, and recorded 30-plus points per game for four straight seasons. However, the former Utah Jazz star is somewhat of a forgotten superstar, who never earned the recognition he deserved.\n\nAfter spending his first three seasons with as many different teams, Dantley quickly established himself as one of the NBA's best players with the Jazz and averaged 30.7 points during the 1980-81 season. The small forward would top 30 for the next three seasons, and he almost did it for a fifth time after averaging 29.8 points in the 1985/86 campaign.\n\nDantley's scoring impact soon slowed as he hit entered his 30s, although the Utah great finally got some of the recognition he deserved when he was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame back in 2008.\n\n#3 Oscar Robertson - 6 Seasons with 30+ points\n\nOscar Robertson was the original triple-double king (Picture credit: NBA.com)\n\nIn 1962, Oscar Robertson became the first player in NBA history to average a triple-double for a season - and The Big O's legacy has been revisited due to Russell Westbrook's triple-double heroics. However, unlike Westbrook, Robertson was one of the deadliest scorers of his era and the point guard recorded six 30 points per game seasons.\n\nUncommonly, Robertson averaged 30.5 points in his rookie campaign with the Cincinnati Royals, and only failed to top the 30-point threshold in one (1962-63) of his first seven seasons in the league. Roberston came close again during the 1967-68 season, averaging 29.2 points, although his scoring efficiency declined after a late-career move to Milwaukee in 1970. Nevertheless, Robertson finished his career averaging 25.7 points per game, and only two other men recorded more 30 point seasons.\n\n#2 Wilt Chamberlain - 7 Seasons with 30+ points\n\nWilt Chamberlain is among the most recognizable figures in NBA history\n\nDuring spells with the Philadelphia/San Francisco Warriors, Philadelphia 76ers, and Los Angeles Lakers, Wilt Chamberlian established himself as the best player of his generation. The 13-time All-Star is most well-known for his 100 point NBA game, although Chamberlain's biggest achievement was his incredible ability to put up the biggest numbers in the history of the sport.\n\nDuring his first seven seasons in the league, Chamberlain never dipped under 30 points, and the four-time MVP recorded an NBA record of 50.4 points during the 1961-62 season. Chamberlain also took home the scoring title in each of his 30 point seasons and is one of only two players in history to average 30 points over the course of his entire career.\n\nChamberlain couldn't replicate his early scoring heroics during five years with the Lakers, although the Hall of Famer had already cemented his legacy as perhaps the best scorer in history.\n\n#1 Michael Jordan - 8 Seasons with 30+ points\n\nMichael Jordan is widely considered as the best basketball player of all-time (Picture credit: NBA.com)\n\nMicahel Jordan is no stranger to holding NBA records, and the Chicago Bulls legend unsurprisingly holds the record of most 30 points per game seasons. Jordan first reached the tally during the 1986-87 season, as he averaged a career-high 37.1 points - and the Chicago legend went on to average at least 30 in the following six seasons.\n\nJordan's streak came to an end after his surprise retirement in 1993, although the superstar soon returned to win three more championships - and Jordan sealed the record by averaging 30 points for one final time during the 1995-96 season.\n\nJordan also retired as just the second player in history to average 30 points per game over the course of his career. Ultimately, Jordan's record appears unbeatable, and few players will even get halfway to his eight seasons of averaging at least 30.\n\nPoll : 0 votes"}, {"url": "https://www.newsday.com/sports/basketball/long-island-in-the-pros-nba-edition-f14506", "page_content": "A look at those pro basketball players who first shined on the Long Island hardwood.
