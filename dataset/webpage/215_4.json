In 2000, she married actor and filmmaker Andre Gregory. Kleine's 2013 do*entary Andre Gregory: Before and After Dinner is about him. It was funded through Kickstarter.\n\nKleine studied film at The Museum School and the MIT Film/Video Section, studying with Richard Lea*. She received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Tufts University and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in 1983 and a Master's of Fine Arts from Bard College in 1996.\n\nKleine's films have been shown at many film festivals, including Telluride, Seattle, San Francisco, Vancouver, the Boston Independent Film Festival, at the It\u2019s All True International Do*entary Festival in Brazil, the DOK Leipzig International Festival, and the Santa Fe International Film Festival. Her film Doug and Mike, Mike and Doug (1989), about artists Doug and Mike Starn- Starn Twins, was broadcast on PBS's POV Film Series.\n\nKleine's film Phyllis and Harold (2008) is about her parents' 59-year marriage. The film won Best Feature Length Do*entary at the 2009 World Jewish Film Festival, in Ashkelon, Israel, and the Orson Welles Award for Innovative Filmmaking at the 2008 Iowa Independent Film Festival. Kleine's other films include Inside Out (2004), Til Death Do Us Part (1998), Secrets of Cindy (1983), P*age (1991) and Holy Matter (1996).\n\nKleine has worked at Boston College (1985\u201398), Harvard University (1990\u201391), School of the Museum of Fine Arts (1996\u201397) and The New School (1996-98).\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links"}, {"url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/all-about-her-mother-cind_b_469162", "page_content": "To say that director Cindy Kleine spins her search for truth into an art form only begins to describe the new film, Phyllis and Harold, documenting the bewildering marriage of her parents. While father Harold remains a dark and shadowy figure, mother Phyllis is eventually painstakingly and fully fleshed out. The deeper focus and graphic details, which reveal the subtle and sometimes secret aspects of her mother's life, could not be revealed until Harold passed away in 2003. And, I won't spoil the accruing dramatic suspense by being too specific here. Suffice it to say, its impact is powerful and poignant.\n\nThe feelings the film evokes remind one of a first reading of Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique in which essential aspects of one's own mother or grandmother were given credence and revealed as never before. Phyllis and Harold is the perfect companion piece to Friedan's seminal work on the quiet plight of suburban women in the 1940s and 50s, proving once again that life was anything but pure and simple way back when.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike Friedan's book, Cindy Kleine's film has captured something quietly but essentially tragic about many American women who were born in the 1920s and 30s. While this film is a very individual and unique unfolding of Klein's mother Phyllis' deeply complicated, lifelong dilemma, it also strikes notes of universality many will recognize as they recall the lives of the women from the WWII generation in their own families. In choosing duty and loyalty over satisfaction and a greater sense of freedom, these women stayed home, remained trapped, and suffered in silence.\n\nBut a mother's deep unhappiness and yearning for something missing (or in Phyllis' case someone who is missing) -- even when veiled by middle-class props such as a killer wardrobe, a tastefully decorated home, a pool in the back yard, and trips abroad -- seldom go unnoticed by her own children. It's striking to hear Harold recall the story of their 59-year marriage and compare it with Phyllis' recollections and those of her two sensitive and observant daughters.\n\nPhyllis' story is a heartbreaker, but so too is the effect it had on Cindy Kleine and her sister who are also interviewed. They worshipped their mother even though most of the time she was only half there. Kleine's extraordinary empathy and insight into her mother as well as her early exposure to photography which developed her visual sensibilities thanks to her father are the some of the elements that make this film so effective and ring so true. Ironically, the film -- unlike Phyllis' real life -- allows her ultimately to be revealed a whole human being.\n\nPhyllis and Harold. directed, produced, and written by Cindy Kleine. Opens in NYC on February 19, 2010. Limited release.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nActress Jean Simmons: Leading Lady in Her Final Film\n\nBorn nine years after Phyllis, the actress Jean Simmons shares some things in common with her. Simmons' career flourished through almost three decades before it began to wane in the late 1960s. Her second husband, film director Richard Brooks, sensed this frustration as well as problems with alcohol use and the effects of the increasing invisibility of middle age and an unhappy marriage. He created the film The Happy Ending especially for her. Released in an important and transitional year in Hollywood--1969--it was far from a perfect movie, but Jean Simmons made the most of a role that paralleled her life so closely and was nominated--a second time--for an Academy Award. It's another film that tries to make sense of Friedan's feminine mystique--that awful, nagging sense that something in life is missing.\n\n\n\nJean Simmons (1929-2010).\n\nSimmons always made wildly interesting if not important movies -- whether theatrically released or for television -- in almost every decade following her film debut in 1944 at the age of 15. 1940s: Great Expectations, Hamlet; 1950s: Young Bess, The Actress, Until They Sail; 1960s: Elmer Gantry, Spartacus ;1970s: Mr. Sycamore, Dominique, The Eastern Promise; 1980s: December Flowers, The Thornbirds, (television remake) Great Expectations; 1990s: How to Make an American Quilt.\n\nShe was luminous in black and white as well as Technicolor and shined brightly in quirky, contemporary dramas (Mister Buddwing, 1966) as well as in lavish, period pieces (The Robe, 1953). She even bridged the gap to musicals starring with Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra in Guys and Dolls (1955) and unlike her contemporaries Audrey Hepburn, Deborah Kerr, and Natalie Wood her singing voice was not dubbed by Marnie Nixon.\n\nHer final decade included a wide variety of work: serving as narrator of PBS's American Masters series' documentary on legendary Hollywood director George Cukor (On Cukor); playing Countess Lucinda Rhives in Winter Solstice alongside Geraldine Chaplin and Peter Ustinov; and in the English version of the critically acclaimed animated feature Howl's Moving Castle, she teamed up with Lauren Bacall, Christian Bale, Blythe Danner, and Emily Mortimer lending their voices to Hayao Miyakazi's rich characters in which Simmons played Grandma Sophie to great effect.\n\nAdvertisement"}, {"url": "https://www.wbur.org/news/2013/08/01/andre-gregory-kleine", "page_content": "Fifteen years ago filmmaker Cindy Kleine fell in love with Andr\u00e9 Gregory, a legendary theater director known more for co-writing and playing a version of himself in 1981\u2019s conversational film drama \u201cMy Dinner With Andr\u00e9.\u201d (Other moviegoers might associate him more for getting his eye gouged out in the 1993 blockbuster, \u201cDemolition Man.\u201d)\n\nWhen Kleine and Gregory married she was 39 and he was 63. Over time the age gap became more palpable and stirred her documentarian\u2019s impulse to freeze time. Part love letter (that occasionally borders on too intimate) and part artist portrait, Kleine\u2019s documentary, \u201cAndr\u00e9 Gregory: Before and After Dinner,\u201d opens today at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and runs through Aug. 9. Kleine and Gregory will be present at tonight\u2019s 7:30 screening to answer questions.\n\nFrom \"Andr\u00e9 Gregory: Before And After Dinner.\" (Courtesy, Cinema Guild)\n\nKleine, who narrates, sets a convivial pace and tone, best illustrated during a scene when she catalogs the 18 boyfriends who preceded Gregory. Photographs of each man flips by as Kleine lists, \u201cJonathan, Rob, Fernando, Rob ...\u201d How did she manage such thorough record-keeping pre-Instagram? And so few clothes!\n\nKleine studied filmmaking at The Museum School and at MIT under Richard Leacock, who knew a thing or two about personal documentaries. Her last documentary, \u201cPhyllis and Harold,\u201d held a microscope to her parents\u2019 59-year marriage. (It premiered in Boston as part of the Boston Jewish Film Festival and this run is also co-presented by BJFF.)\n\nHere, the marriage is unquestionably strong. Kleine pokes fun at Gregory\u2019s close friendship and life-long collaboration with actor/writer Wallace Shawn, who appears frequently in \u201cBefore and After Dinner\u201d and was his foil in \u201cMy Dinner With Andr\u00e9.\u201d And Gregory calls this friendship his \u201csecond marriage,\u201d but it\u2019s lighthearted. Kleine is yang to Gregory\u2019s yin. In his youth he was never hugged, he says. In her family, \u201cfighting was the primary means of communication and everyone talked at once.\u201d\n\nKleine steps into the background and devotes the second part of the film to Gregory, with fascinating footage from his formative days in experimental theater (the Richard Avedon stills from \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland\u201d are a knock-out) and a peppering of Gregory\u2019s theatrical wisdom and anecdotes told to wide-eyed, nodding listeners.\n\nIn one scene Gregory spins a delicate yarn about his first kiss, which just happened to take place in a moonlit, Marblehead, Mass. cemetery. His knees buckled and he fainted. In another, he recalls a moment of hysterical blindness.\n\nThough both are Jewish, Gregory\u2019s parents maintained a severely tight lip in this regard and the nature of his father\u2019s relationship to the highest ranks of Nazi leadership continues to plague him and occupies a major thread of this film. Yet, as compelling as it to delve into the underpinnings of Gregory\u2019s artistic drive, which he attributes to his terrifying father, the most gripping moments come while he\u2019s directing Ibsen\u2019s \u201cThe Master Builder\u201d in his living room.\n\nWhat sets him apart as director, we learn, is his willingness to take the time that a production needs \u2014 he rehearsed \u201cThe Master Builder\u201d for 14 years, for example. His obsession with \"Uncle Vanya\" was documented in \"Vanya on 42nd Street\" by Louis Malle, who also filmed \"My Dinner with Andr\u00e9.\" Gregory also has an incorrigible trust in the actors he chooses. \u201cI never audition an actor I only interview them,\u201d he says.\n\nThere\u2019s a discomfort at first with how long shots linger on Gregory\u2019s intense, piercing gaze while actors deliver their lines off camera. An hour or so into this film, convinced of his portrait as a bottomless well of artistic chutzpah and encouragement, we are desperate to watch only his reactions. The act of directing, or life itself, is manifest in every line of his face.\n\nErin Trahan edits the online film magazine The Independent and moderates the current season of The DocYard. you can reach her at erin@erintrahan.net."}, {"url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/phyllis-and-harold-film-review-29331/", "page_content": "Maybe it\u2019s something in the water in Long Island\u2019s Queens and Nassau counties, but such documentaries as \u201c51 Birch Street,\u201d \u201cCapturing the Friedmans\u201d and \u201cCrazy Love\u201d have introduced us to seemingly familiar New York-area families, only to reveal corners that were dark (in the case of \u201cBirch\u201d), disturbing and pathological (\u201cFriedmans\u201d) and flat-out crazed and nutty (\u201cCrazy Love\u201d).\n\nIn \u201cPhyllis and Harold,\u201d a look at her parents Phyllis and Harold Kleine, now deceased, filmmaker Cindy Kleine hits a mushy, murky, mediocre middle ground. Like many of their peers, the Kleines came from Manhattan\u2019s impoverished Lower East Side and made it to the suburbs, where they achieved a life of material comfort that included a beautifully landscaped house, nanny, and much international travel. Credit Harold\u2019s success as a dentist and the new money his career generated.\n\nThe Bottom Line Empty\n\nVia interviews with her mother and father, who tend not to be in the same shot, we learn that their love letters were effusive but that the 59-year marriage that ensued was a grave disappointment, especially to Phyllis. She groans, grimaces and complains as she reveals the great love of her life with whom she cheated during the very early and very late years of her marriage.\n\nHarold, on the other hand, is the poster child for denial. Seemingly numbed and clueless, he views the marriage positively.\n\nIf Phyllis did not enjoy the long marital ride, the problem for viewers might be that even an hour-plus with these two could be too much. In fact, none of the family members is great company, as eloquence, self-knowledge and empathy are in short supply. Boxoffice prospects are pretty limited.\n\nThe only spark here is Phyllis\u2019 adulterous affair, but with no clues to the identity, personality or character of the mysterious \u2014 and married \u2014 lover, he never comes to life in any way. Yes, Phyllis convincingly pines for him, and daughters Cindy and Ricky share their collusion in keeping the affair a secret from their father. Apparently, their cooperation, which included helping Phyllis secretly doll up for trysts at Ricky\u2019s apartment, was critical since Harold micromanaged all of the family finances, including the monitoring of credit cards and phone calls.\n\nAfter Harold dies, Phyllis moves easily into the next phase of her life in nice assisted-living quarters in downtown Manhattan. She fails in her effort to reconnect with her lover and expresses not an iota of remorse at her husband\u2019s passing. Love here, wedded to her affair and not to her marriage, has nothing to do with family. \u201cHe showed me the world\u201d is her only clue to why she went the 59-year distance with Harold.\n\nMade over many years, \u201cPhyllis and Harold\u201d offers the requisite home movies and photographs evoking lives lived decades ago. But the archival material provides no more than lighter family moments, including Phyllis and Harold\u2019s far-flung travels. Many presumed friends and other family members seen go unidentified.\n\nFortunately, Lisa Crafts\u2019 colorful animation intermittently brings welcome charm and life to this otherwise dreary tale.\n\nSo what is it about? The lessons that emerge are that families aren\u2019t what they seem, aging alters us, and true and lasting love is rare.

Gregory\u2019s tale-spinning fluency dazzles just as much as it did in Louis Malle\u2019s \u201cMy Dinner With Andre,\u201d but this time with a wry familiarity all Kleine\u2019s own. Shot at home or in various improvised rehearsal spaces \u2014 with much photographic evidence of Gregory\u2019s sterile, unhappy childhood, as well as occasional clips from \u201cMy Dinner With Andre\u201d and the other filmed Gregory/Wallace Shawn collaboration, \u201cVanya on 42nd Street\u201d \u2014 the film juxtaposes work and biography with wondrous open-endedness, and should enchant fans as well as those new to the table.\n\nInterspersed with various reminiscences of past productions by Gregory and his regular actors, Kleine affords tantalizing glimpses of the helmer\u2019s greatest hits, chief among them his celebrated \u201cAlice in Wonderland,\u201d which ran for seven years in the 1970s. The only remaining traces of \u201cAlice\u201d stagecraft appear in Richard Avedon\u2019s famous book of photographs and in short film snippets, including scenes with the three-man caterpillar and a satisfyingly chaotic tea-party excerpt. \u201cAlice\u201d also allows Gregory to establish a link between his private and professional lives, never very separate in any case: \u201c \u2018Alice\u2019 was the portrait of my childhood \u2026 plummeted into this horrifying, terrifying, insane world where everyone\u2019s a mindfucker.\u201d\n\nKleine neither elides nor naturalizes her own presence in Gregory\u2019s life; her grounding in their shared experience instead lends a welcome, matter-of-fact transparency to the proceedings. Husband and wife had radically different Jewish childhoods, although Kleine contents herself with mere snapshots of her loud, argumentative Long Island clan, having seemingly laid those ghosts to rest in her fascinating documentary \u201cPhyllis and Harold\u201d (the poster for which is seen prominently on a wall in the background).\n\nBy contrast, Gregory\u2019s upper-class Russian-Jewish family, which he likens to the despotic rulers of a small Balkan state, still exerts a certain awful fascination. Pursuing a respected historian\u2019s claim that Gregory\u2019s father collaborated with Hitler to destabilize the franc prior to WWII, Gregory hires researchers in Paris and Berlin to investigate the charges.\n\nThe film also continues \u201cMy Dinner With Andre\u2019s\u201d dialogue, Shawn functioning here as part of a dialectic between life and art. During ongoing rehearsals for \u201cThe Master Builder\u201d (a work in progress for 14 years), Gregory sits languidly conducting a scene, in relaxed harmony with surrounding friends and family; meanwhile, in a corner of the frame, Shawn positively vibrates with knife-edge tension as Ibsen\u2019s title character.

The letter did not detail the findings. Mr. Frumkes, who did not respond to requests for comment, is appealing. The school\u2019s letter said that until his right to appeal has lapsed or been exhausted his employment would be suspended.\n\nAnother instructor in the department, Robert Haufrecht, was suspended in March and his contract was not renewed. The school said the suspension was in response to concerns raised by students but did not detail them. One student, Ashley Priessnitz, said she had complained last semester that Mr. Haufrecht, her acting teacher, had showed her unwanted attention, and had told her in class to rehearse suggestive scenarios, like washing herself.\n\n\u201cI started wearing baggy clothes to class because any time I wore normal clothing he would comment on my appearance,\u201d Ms. Priessnitz said. \u201cIf I saw him in a hallway at school I would duck around a corner.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://sva.edu/about/press-room-publications/school-of-visual-arts-presents-sva-milton-as-tribute-to-design-giant-and-longtime-faculty-milton-glaser", "page_content": "New York, NY\u2014School of Visual Arts (SVA) is pleased to present \u201cSVA\u2764\ufe0fMilton: The Legacy of Milton Glaser,\u201d a new exhibition exploring design giant Milton Glaser\u2019s early life and career, on view December 7, 2021 through January 15, 2022 at the SVA Gramercy Gallery at 209 East 23rd Street.

People think, erroneously, that Rochester (both the city and the university) are boring places to be, and I would agree only insofar as to say that those who want things to come to them, might be bored. The city has so many amazing restaurants, venues, and sites, but you have to take that first step of getting on the bus to go see them. At an academically rigorous school like UR, it can be hard freshman year to remember that life exists outside of academics, and especially outside of STEM. UR has a vibrant arts community, though, not even including Eastman (which has student and professional concerts alike). Everyone finds their niche pretty easily once they look for it, because there is genuinely something for every type of person. And, everyone honestly supports each other all the time!...

While SVA doesn't have a set campus, rather several buildings in manhattan, transportation between buildings isn't that big a deal.\n\nThe professors I had were all industry professionals which gave helpful insight as well as thorough critique on works. And they were overall nice people! With any college, I find the curriculum can be drastically different between professors. However, I was surprised a school like SVA can have these very different curriculums within the same program. Not getting the professor you wanted because the class filled up can be a real pain for a semester, but most professors do make themselves accessible if you just make the effort to email or talk to them.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/school-of-visual-arts-7468", "page_content": "School of Visual Arts is a proprietary institution that was founded in 1947.
