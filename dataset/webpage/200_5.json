Unlike the previous decade where the Gunners were used to winning trophies and participating regularly in the Champions League, this last decade saw them slip out of Europe\u2019s elite club competition. Due to the mediocre nature of their performances, Arsenal were unable to attract and/or keep old off footballing superstars. Hence, the competition for places was not always as fierce as it should have been in some positions for a club of Arsenal\u2019s magnitude. It has not been all doom and gloom for the Gunners though as they have picked up three FA Cups. Some of Europe\u2019s best players have donned the famous red shirt in this decade as well. Let us take a trip down memory lane and pick Arsenal\u2019s team of the decade.\n\nArsenal Team of the Decade\n\nManager \u2013 Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\n\nArs\u00e8ne Wenger is the obvious choice as the manager of the Arsenal team of the decade. Unai Emery was the manager for a brief period but one cannot possibly think of his reign as anything other than an utter disaster. Under Wenger, Arsenal won the FA Cup three times in four seasons. Despite fans turning on him in the last season or so, Wenger\u2019s time at the helm is always looked back with fondness. At least, the football was mostly entertaining. The Gunners had some memorable victories in the last decade under him as well. The 2-1 victory over Barcelona in 2011 comes to mind first. Then, there was the massive 3-2 FA Cup final win over Hull City after coming back from 2-0 down. Definitely, Wenger was the best manager Arsenal have ever had.\n\nFormation \u2013 4-2-3-1\n\nIn the last decade, most teams have played with one up front. Arsenal have done the same on most occasions as well. Hence, a 4-2-3-1 formation has been used to create the Arsenal team of the decade.\n\nGoalkeeper \u2013 Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny\n\nWojciech Szcz\u0119sny beats off competition from \u0141ukasz Fabia\u0144ski and Petr \u010cech to win the goalkeeper\u2019s shirt of the Arsenal team of the decade. Szcz\u0119sny started the FA Cup final victory over Aston Villa in 2015. The Polish shot-stopper first arrived in 2006 and came through the youth academy of Arsenal. He is loved by everyone still and many did not support the decision to let him go to Juventus in 2017.\n\nSzcz\u0119sny is a Gooner through and through as well, which cannot be said about Petr \u010cech. Szcz\u0119sny was only 24 when he won the Premier League Golden Glove award jointly with Petr \u010cech. His time at Arsenal is looked back with fondness, mostly. Let\u2019s just forget about that League Cup final against Birmingham City.\n\nBacary Sagna was a reliable option for Arsenal at right-back. He was solid at the back and quite dangerous going forward as well. The Frenchman had a happy habit of scoring against Tottenham Hotspur also.\n\nSagna was part of the starting 11 that ended Arsenal\u2019s trophy drought in the 2014 FA Cup final. He made the PFA Team of the Year on two occasions too.\n\nHe deserves the right-back spot over H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn.\n\nIn the last decade, Arsenal had some shaky centre-backs playing for them. Laurent Koscielny was definitely one of them. However, the Frenchman still proved to be a world-class performer for the Gunners. He became club captain eventually and played through the pain barrier a number of times. The way he left the club was not at all pleasant. However, he deserves this spot for sure.\n\nPer Mertesacker joined Arsenal on deadline day in 2011 straight after the 8-2 defeat to Manchester United. It was a tumultuous time at Arsenal.\n\nThe BFG provided experience and calmness at the back that was much needed at the time to turn things around. Mertesacker was a key member of all three of Arsenal\u2019s FA cup wins in the last decade. The 2017 FA Cup final against \u200bChelsea was a special match for him as he was simply outstanding.\n\nThe German had not started a match for Arsenal for months before that but came back to deliver a fantastic performance against the league winners.\n\nNacho Monreal is a player loved by all the Arsenal fans. He always gave his all for the club.\n\nThe Spaniard was often deployed at centre-back and he did well in that position too.\n\nMonreal is the undisputed choice at left-back.\n\nCentre Midfielder \u2013 Aaron Ramsey\n\nAaron Ramsey was perhaps the best player of the decade for Arsenal. He scored the winning goals of the FA Cup finals in 2014 and 2017. Despite having multiple injuries during this decade, Ramsey became a club-legend at Arsenal.\n\nThe Welshman is the highest-scoring midfielder in Arsenal\u2019s history with 64 goals in 369 appearances. Sadly, he was somehow allowed to leave for free, a common denominator of many members of the Arsenal team of the decade.\n\nCentre Midfielder \u2013 Santi Cazorla\n\nSanti Cazorla is probably the most loved player on this side. The Spaniard was a magician with the ball at his feet.\n\nHe produced a masterclass against Manchester City in 2015 which will live long in the memory of Arsenal fans.\n\nCazorla was instrumental in that memorable comeback against Hull City. His free-kick brought Arsenal back into the game. He won the Arsenal Player of the Season award in his first season as well.\n\nUnfortunately, Cazorla\u2019s time at Arsenal ended tragically through a horrific injury.\n\nCentre Attacking Midfielder \u2013 Mesut \u00d6zil\n\nMesut \u00d6zil became Arsenal\u2019s record signing in 2013 when he signed from Real Madrid for \u00a342.5 million. That transfer sparked massive celebrations amongst Gooners all over the world.\n\nSince then, the German has been one of the most frustrating players at the club. On his day, \u00d6zil was simply phenomenal.\n\nHe picked up the Arsenal Player of the Season award in 2016. He has registered more assists than any other Arsenal player this decade. His place in this side is deserved without a doubt.\n\nRight Winger \u2013 Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\n\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang only joined Arsenal in 2018. However, his place in the team of the decade is well-deserved.\n\nThe Gabonese won the Golden Boot in his first full Premier League season. He scores goals for fun and those goals have often dragged an average Arsenal side through tough times.\n\nThe final signing of the Wenger era has become a talisman at the club and Arsenal fans hope he will stay on at the club for a few more seasons.\n\nLeft Winger \u2013 Alexis Sanchez\n\nAlexis Sanchez was superb during his time in North London. He wowed the crowd with dazzling performances regularly. The Chilean won Arsenal\u2019s Player of the Year award twice in four years. He was quite sensational at times during his stay.\n\nHowever, by the time Sanchez left Arsenal, his relationship with the fans became quite feisty. Regardless, he deserves his spot in this side.\n\nStriker \u2013 Robin van Persie\n\nRobin van Persie scored 132 goals in 278 games for Arsenal. He was the club captain and scored 30 goals in the 2011/12 season to pick up the golden boot. The Dutch striker was at Arsenal for eight seasons.\n\nUnfortunately, like many other players in this side, van Persie also left making Arsenal fans angry. He was a magnificent player and losing him to Manchester United hurt Gooners really badly.\n\nSubstitutes\n\n\u0141ukasz Fabianski\n\nMikel Arteta\n\nOlivier Giroud\n\nTheo Walcott\n\nH\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn\n\nFrancis Coquelin\n\nJack Wilshere\n\nMain Photo\n\nEmbed from Getty Images"}, {"url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/laurent-koscielny", "page_content": "Laurent Koscielny: A Brief Biography\n\nLaurent Koscielny is a professional footballer from France. He was born on the 10th of September, 1985 in Tulle. Koscielny is a center back who is currently the vice-captain of the English Premier League team Arsenal.\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchman began his career with Guingamp in 2004 which has produced players like Didier Drogba and Florent Malouda. Koscielny played as a fullback for Guingamp in most of the matches.However, he felt that center back was his forte and this made him join Tours FC to take a chance at center back.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his debut season with Tours FC in 2007, Koscielny showed remarkable progress and played a major role in his team\u2019s promotion to Ligue 1. He was also named in the best XI of the season.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe center back continued his good form with Lorient FC in 2009 where he was regarded as one of the best players in his position. He was developing reputation as a clever and an agile defender. His achievements and footballing potential attracted Arsenal, ultimately moving to the Premier League side for a fee of \u00a38.45 million the following season.\n\n\n\n\n\nDebut\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurent Koscielny had the opportunity to represent Poland but decided to ply his trade with France. He made his first appearance for France on the 9th of February, 2011 in a friendly match against United States. Koscielny played the entire game and his side sealed a 1-0 victory. On the 4th of June, 2016, Koscielny scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland.\n\n\n\n\n\nRise to Glory\n\n\n\n\n\nKoscielny had a great debut season with Arsenal. He was constantly making great tackles and preventing the opposition from penetrating their back line. In 2011, Koscielny had one of his best performances till date that saw Arsenal beat Barcelona 2-1 in the round of 16 Champions League tie.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchman was a great asset to the team as apart from acting as a defender, he had a great goal scoring ability. Till date, Koscielny has scored 24 goals for Arsenal. He is the highest scoring defender for Arsenal in the history of EPL. He is regarded as one of the most important players for Arsenal in the past seven years.\n\n\n\n\n\nKoscielny has won the FA Cup with Arsenal in 2014, 2015 and 2017. He has also won the FA Community Shield in 2014, 2015 and 2017. The center back has made a major contribution in his team\u2019s success in the FA Cup over the years.\n\n\n\n\n\nLow Points\n\n\n\n\n\nKoscielny has got more than thirty yellow cards and as many as five red cards. This has forced him out of a few crucial encounters and has affected the team\u2019s performance. He has missed more games due to suspension and not because of injury.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe center back must work on preventing harsh tackles so as to represent Arsenal in more and more games and increase their chances of winning more trophies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchman is yet to win the Premier League with Arsenal.

He is vice-captain of Arsenal.\n\nBorn in Tulle, Koscielny began his football career playing for a host of youth clubs before moving to Guingamp in 2003, where he quickly progressed through the youth ranks, making his professional debut the following season. After becoming frustrated at being played out of position as a right back, he joined Tours for an undisclosed fee, quickly establishing himself as the team\u2019s star player in his desired position, ultimately aiding in the club\u2019s promotion into Ligue 1, while also being named in the Ligue 2 Team of the Season.[3] Koscielny continued his impressive performances following a \u20ac1.7 million transfer to fellow French outfit Lorient in 2009, receiving multiple plaudits for his performances, largely cultivating a reputation as a clever, agile, ball-playing defender.[3] His achievements and footballing potential attracted Arsenal, ultimately moving to the Premier League side for a fee of \u00a38.45 million the following season.\n\nFollowing his arrival to England, Koscielny has widely been regarded to be one of the best players in his position, as well as one of the best in the world.[4][5] He has since established himself as a core component in the Arsenal first team, as well as contributing with a host of individual performances, including aiding in ending the club\u2019s nine-year trophy drought, scoring a crucial equalizer en route to winning the FA Cup in 2014. He was also crucial in further club successes that followed, winning another two FA Cups and the FA Community Shield on three occasions.\n\nDespite having the ability to represent Poland, Koscielny instead decided to represent France, and first appeared up for the national team against Brazil in February 2011.[6] Koscielny has since become a regular starter for the nation in every major tournament that they have appeared in, including UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup, while also leading France to the final of UEFA Euro 2016. He scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland in 2016,[7] and has since amassed forty-nine appearances for the national side.\n\nPrior to the beginning of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Koscielny announced that he would be retiring from international football after the competition, and thus no longer be playing for France.\n\nKoscielny was born in Tulle, Corr\u00e8ze. His career began in 2004 with Guingamp, a team that had produced such talents as Didier Drogba and Florent Malouda. Three years later, Koscielny was forced to take stock and drop down to the French third tier. He made 47 appearances for Guingamp, between 2004 and 2007, mostly as a right fullback.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2007, Koscielny joined Tours FC, deciding that he wanted a chance at centre back. He showed remarkable improvement in aerial ability and positional awareness that limited him to just three yellow cards. During the 2008\u201309 season, Koscielny made 34 Ligue 2 appearances, scoring 5 goals from defence, and was named in the division\u2019s best XI at the end of the season.\n\nArsenal confirmed the signing on 7 July 2010 and Koscielny was handed the club\u2019s number 6 shirt, previously worn by Philippe Senderos, who had moved to Fulham earlier in the summer. Wenger explained he bought Koscielny due to the fact he added height to the team and Arsenal were low on centre backs.[10] Koscielny made his debut against Barnet in a pre-season friendly in July 2010. One month later in his competitive debut against Liverpool at Anfield, he was sent off in the 94th minute for a second bookable offence. Both of his yellow cards were shown beyond 90 minutes. The game ended in a 1\u20131 draw with both teams having debut players sent off.[11] He scored his first goal for Arsenal on 11 September 2010, in a 4\u20131 win against Bolton Wanderers.[12]\n\nKoscielny made his debut in European competition on 15 September 2010, when he partnered S\u00e9bastien Squillaci in a 6\u20130 win over Braga at the Emirates Stadium. Koscielny was praised for performances against Sunderland and made a brilliant tackle against Tottenham Hotspur to stop Aaron Lennon from scoring during their Football League Cup tie. On 27 October, he blocked a shot off the line and provided an assist to Theo Walcott against Newcastle United in the fourth round of the League Cup, where Arsenal went on to win the match 4\u20130 at St James\u2019 Park. Koscielny was given a straight red card in Arsenal\u2019s 0\u20131 loss at home against Newcastle United on 7 November 2010. This was his second sending off of the season.\n\nKoscielny playing for Arsenal on 10 September 2011 against Swansea City.\n\nOn 25 January 2011, Koscielny scored the second goal in the 3\u20130 win over Ipswich Town in the League Cup semi-final second leg win at the Emirates Stadium. Throughout January 2011, Koscielny and Johan Djourou were a part of a defence that did not concede a goal in the Premier League. On 1 February, he scored his third goal of the season, which proved to be the winner in a 2\u20131 turn around victory over Everton. Koscielny had arguably his best performance to date for Arsenal in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16 match against Barcelona. The match ended in a 2\u20131 home win for Arsenal. Koscielny\u2019s performances were applauded and praised in many media reports of the game. Former Arsenal defender, Martin Keown, said his performance was \u201cimpressive\u201d and \u201cmagnificent throughout\u201d.[13] On 27 February, in the last minute of the 2011 Football League Cup Final, Koscielny was involved in a mix-up with his goalkeeper Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny, which resulted in Birmingham City striker Obafemi Martins scoring the winning goal.[14]\n\n2011\u201312 season\n\nKoscielny and Fernando Torres in a Premier League match on 21 April 2012.\n\nKoscielny started the 2011\u201312 season alongside Thomas Vermaelen in central defence. Koscielny was injured and taken off the pitch 10 minutes into a 2\u20130 home loss to Liverpool on 20 August 2011. However, he returned to the starting line-up Arsenal\u2019s biggest ever Premier League defeat, losing 8\u20132 to Manchester United at Old Trafford. On 17 September, Koscielny scored an own goal as Arsenal lost 4\u20133 to Blackburn Rovers in the Premier League. He went on to be named man of the match away at Olympique Marseille in the Champions League, where Arsenal won 1\u20130 at the Stade V\u00e9lodrome, keeping their first clean sheet in a Champions League away game since 18 August 2009 against Celtic, where the Gunners had won 2\u20130.\n\nOn 29 October, Koscielny received praise for his solid performance in Arsenal\u2019s 5\u20133 away win against Chelsea. He scored his first goal of the season on 2 January 2012 in a 2\u20131 away defeat against Fulham. He scored his first Champions League goal against A.C. Milan in a 3\u20130 victory in the round of 16 second leg. On 13 May 2012, he scored the winning goal in a 3\u20132 victory against West Bromwich Albion to ensure that Arsenal finished third in the Premier League. He was voted as the team\u2019s fourth most important player by the fans in Arsenal\u2019s Player of the Season poll for his performances throughout the 2011\u201312 season.[15]\n\n2012\u201313 season\n\nOn 24 July 2012, Koscielny signed a new long term contract with Arsenal.[16][17][18] His first goal of the season was a late equaliser against champions Manchester City on 23 September 2012 in a match which ended 1\u20131.[19] On 30 October, he scored a header from a corner in the 88th minute against Reading in the Football League Cup, helping Arsenal come back from 4\u20130 down to eventually win the game 7\u20135.[20]\n\nOn 13 March 2013, Koscielny scored against Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena in the UEFA Champions League Last 16. His goal put Arsenal 2\u20130 ahead on the night and level at 3\u20133 on aggregate, but they still exited the competition on the away goals rule.[21]\n\nOn 19 May, Koscielny scored the winning goal as Arsenal beat Newcastle United 1\u20130 at St James\u2019 Park in their final Premier League fixture of the season to secure a fourth-placed finish and qualification to the 2013\u201314 UEFA Champions League play-off round.[22]\n\nKoscielny was voted as Arsenal\u2019s second best player of the season.[23]\n\n2013\u201314 season\n\nKoscielny started the 2013\u201314 season by conceding a penalty and getting sent off in Arsenal\u2019s 3\u20131 Premier League opening day defeat at home to Aston Villa.[24] However, his partnership with Per Mertesacker saw the Gunners achieve the joint-best defensive record in the Premier League at the halfway point of the season, as the team topped the table.[25]\n\nOn 22 February 2014, Koscielny scored his first goal of the season in a 4\u20131 defeat of Sunderland.[26] In the team\u2019s penultimate home match, Koscielny scored his second goal of the season in a 3\u20130 win against Newcastle United.[26]\n\nOn 9 May 2014, Koscielny signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal.[27]\n\nOn 17 May, Koscielny scored Arsenal\u2019s equalising goal as the team came from 2\u20130 down to defeat Hull City 3\u20132 in the 2014 FA Cup Final, winning his first piece of silverware with the club.[28]\n\n2014\u201315 season\n\nKoscielny and Kieran Gibbs playing for Arsenal in a match against Chelsea on 5 October 2014\n\nOn 16 August 2014, Koscielny opened his goal-scoring account for the season, scoring Arsenal\u2019s first goal in the 2014\u201315 Premier League. The goal was header from a free-kick in first half stoppage time against Crystal Palace at the Emirates Stadium.[29] After sustaining an achilles tendon injury during the October international break, Koscielny was absent from the Arsenal team for seven weeks.[30] On 29 November, he returned to Arsenal\u2019s starting line-up alongside Per Mertesacker in central defence, as the Gunners kept a clean sheet in a 1\u20130 victory against West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns.[31] In the team\u2019s following fixture at home to Southampton, Koscielny helped Arsenal to record a second consecutive clean sheet and 1\u20130 win.[32]\n\nOn 11 January 2015, Koscielny scored the first goal in a 3\u20130 win over Stoke City.[33] On 18 January, he started in central defence as Arsenal shut out defending champions Manchester City to win 2\u20130 at the City of Manchester Stadium.[34] On 10 February, he scored the opening goal as Arsenal defeated Leicester City 2\u20131.[35] On 30 May 2015, Koscielny was selected to start in the 2015 FA Cup Final, playing the full 90 minutes in a 4\u20130 defeat of Aston Villa at Wembley Stadium.[36]\n\n2015\u201316 season\n\nKoscielny started every game in the first month of the season, excluding a 0\u20130 draw with rivals Liverpool at Emirates Stadium,[37] due to an injury. Koscielny played a vital part as Arsenal won 5 games out of six in October to go second in the Premier League, with Koscielny scoring in successive Premier League wins against Everton and Swansea.[38][39] With manager Arsene Wenger opting to play Gabriel Paulista ahead of vice-captain Per Mertesacker, Koscielny began appearing as captain in February, due to injuries to other captains Santi Cazorla & Mikel Arteta. This ended after a 3\u20132 defeat to Manchester United, when Koscielny missed four games through injury, including a North London derby at White Hart Lane.[40] He returned in a 3\u20131 away defeat to Barcelona in the Champions League, as Arsenal exited the competition at the round of 16 for the sixth season running.[41] Koscielny scored his fourth of the season in a 3\u20133 draw with West Ham.[42]\n\n2016\u201317 season\n\nKoscielny started his first game of the season in a goalless draw against Leicester City. On 10 September, he was given the role of captain and scored a fine overhead kick to equalize for the Gunners in a game which they then won 2\u20131 against Southampton making him Arsenal\u2019s highest goal scoring defender in EPL history, with the landmark achieved on his 31st birthday.[43] Koscielny was involved in a controversial incident at the end of Arsenal\u2019s 1\u20130 win over Burnley, in which Koscielny and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain were involved in a goal which appeared to be scored from an offside position after hitting Koscielny\u2019s arm. Neither the perceived deliberate handball or offside offenses were deemed to be infringements and the goal was later correctly credited to Koscielny.[44][45][46] On 12 January 2017, Koscielny, alongside teammates Francis Coquelin and Olivier Giroud signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal.[47] Two days later, he made his 200th appearance for Arsenal in the Premier League on a 4\u20130 away victory against Swansea City.[48][49]\n\nOn the last day of the 2016\u201317 season he received red card for a tackle on Enner Valencia of Everton. Arsenal lost an appeal and Koscielny was banned for three games, meaning he would miss FA Cup final.[50]\n\nAlthough he was absent from the FA Cup final and the Community Shield, Koscielny lifted both trophies alongside Per Mertesacker.\n\nKoscielny was called up to the French national team on 3 February 2011. Before his call up for France, Koscielny was also eligible to play for Poland and initially considered applying for Polish citizenship.[6] In August 2010, it was reported that he had not submitted an application and cancelled a meeting with Poland national team coach Franciszek Smuda in Warsaw on 7 August.

Koscielny is the vice-captain of Arsenal. He has been described as a clever, agile and ball-playing defender.\n\nKoscielny was born in the city of Tulle and began his football career playing for a host of amateur and youth clubs such as Brive, Tulle Corr\u00e8ze and Limoges. In 2003, he moved to Guingamp, where he made his professional debut the following year. Koscielny joined Tours for an undisclosed fee to play in the third tier of the French league in 2007 and enjoyed promotion with his new side before being named in the Ligue 2 Team of the Season the following campaign. In 2009, newly promoted Ligue 1 side Lorient signed Koscielny for around \u20ac1.7 million, and his performances caught the eye of Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who signed him in 2010. Since then, he is regarded as one of the best players in his position in the Premier League.\n\nKoscielny was first called up to the French national team on 4 February 2011 and has since represented the country at UEFA Euro 2012, UEFA Euro 2016, and at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Prior to his call-up for France, he was also eligible to play for Poland, as a result of his family roots.\n\nClub career\n\nEarly career\n\nKoscielny was born in Tulle, Corr\u00e8ze. His career began in 2004 with Guingamp, a team that had produced such talents as Didier Drogba and Florent Malouda. Three years later, Koscielny was forced to take stock and drop down to the French third tier. He made 47 appearances for Guingamp, between 2004 and 2007, mostly as a right fullback.\n\nIn 2007, Koscielny joined Tours FC, deciding that he wanted a chance at centre back. He showed remarkable improvement in aerial ability and positional awareness that limited him to just three yellow cards. During the 2008\u201309 season, Koscielny made 34 Ligue 2 appearances, scoring 5 goals from defence, and was named in the division's best XI at the end of the season.\n\nLorient\n\nOn 16 June 2009, newly promoted Ligue 1 side FC Lorient signed Koscielny on a four-year contract for around \u20ac1.7 million. He established himself as a starter and played in his preferred centre-back position. Over one season at the club, he scored 3 goals in 35 appearances. On 7 March 2010 Koscielny tapped in his first Ligue 1 goal against Olympique Marseille at Stade V\u00e9lodrome in the 65th minute in a 1\u20131 draw. Koscielny became a fan favourite when he scored his second goal with a header deep in injury time against Montpellier in a 2\u20132 draw after a cross from Olivier Monterrubio.\n\nHe scored another against Bordeaux after 11 minutes. However, he received a red card 15 minutes later for a foul in the penalty area against his future Arsenal teammate Marouane Chamakh. Koscielny helped Lorient to finish the campaign in 7th place; its best finish in Ligue 1. An impressive season culminated in reports from French daily Ouest-France that the defender was training with the Arsenal reserves ahead of an official announcement. On 6 July 2010, Koscielny agreed personal terms with Arsenal. Arsenal's initial offer for Koscielny was believed to be in the region of \u00a34 million, while they were then prepared to do a deal that would also involve youngster Francis Coquelin moving on loan in the opposite direction, which Lorient rejected. During the summer transfer window of 2010 reports began to emerge in late June that a deal had been reached to bring Koscielny to Arsenal for a reported sum of \u00a38.45 million.\n\nArsenal\n\n2010\u201311 season\n\n\"I don't believe any French player would have refused to come and play for Arsenal. It took me four years to go from the bench of Ligue 2 to Arsenal so it is a great achievement. I have been on the crest of a wave for the last few years. But it is just the beginning; I haven't proved anything yet. Arsenal is a reference for football.\" Laurent Koscielny\n\nArsenal confirmed the signing on 7 July 2010 and Koscielny was handed the club's number 6 shirt, previously worn by Philippe Senderos, who had moved to Fulham earlier in the summer. Wenger explained he bought Koscielny due to the fact he added height to the team and Arsenal were low on centre backs. Koscielny made his debut against Barnet in a pre-season friendly in July 2010. One month later in his competitive debut against Liverpool at Anfield, he was sent off in the 94th minute for a second bookable offence. Both of his yellow cards were shown beyond 90 minutes. The game ended in a 1\u20131 draw with both teams having debut players sent off. He scored his first goal for Arsenal on 11 September 2010, in a 4\u20131 win against Bolton Wanderers.\n\nKoscielny made his debut in European competition on 15 September 2010, when he partnered S\u00e9bastien Squillaci in a 6\u20130 win over Braga at the Emirates Stadium. Koscielny was praised for performances against Sunderland and made a brilliant tackle against Tottenham Hotspur to stop Aaron Lennon from scoring during their Football League Cup tie. On 27 October, he blocked a shot off the line and provided an assist to Theo Walcott against Newcastle United in the fourth round of the League Cup, where Arsenal went on to win the match 4\u20130 at St James' Park. Koscielny was given a straight red card in Arsenal's 0\u20131 loss at home against Newcastle United on 7 November 2010. This was his second sending off of the season.\n\nKoscielny playing for Arsenal on 10 September 2011 against Swansea City.\n\nOn 25 January 2011, Koscielny scored the second goal in the 3\u20130 win over Ipswich Town in the League Cup semi-final second leg win at the Emirates Stadium. Throughout January 2011, Koscielny and Johan Djourou were a part of a defence that did not concede a goal in the Premier League. On 1 February, he scored his third goal of the season, which proved to be the winner in a 2\u20131 turn around victory over Everton. Koscielny had arguably his best performance to date for Arsenal in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16 match against Barcelona. The match ended in a 2\u20131 home win for Arsenal. Koscielny's performances were applauded and praised in many media reports of the game. Former Arsenal defender, Martin Keown, said his performance was \"impressive\" and \"magnificent throughout\". On 27 February, in the last minute of the 2011 Football League Cup Final, Koscielny was involved in a mix-up with his goalkeeper Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny, which resulted in Birmingham City striker Obafemi Martins scoring the winning goal.\n\n2011\u201312 season\n\nKoscielny and Fernando Torres in a Premier League match on 21 April 2012.\n\nKoscielny started the 2011\u201312 season alongside Thomas Vermaelen in central defence. Koscielny was injured and taken off the pitch 10 minutes into a 2\u20130 home loss to Liverpool on 20 August 2011. However, he returned to the starting line-up Arsenal's biggest ever Premier League defeat, losing 8\u20132 to Manchester United at Old Trafford. On 17 September, Koscielny scored an own goal as Arsenal lost 4\u20133 to Blackburn Rovers in the Premier League. He went on to be named man of the match away at Olympique Marseille in the Champions League, where Arsenal won 1\u20130 at the Stade V\u00e9lodrome, keeping their first clean sheet in a Champions League away game since 18 August 2009 against Celtic, where the Gunners had won 2\u20130.\n\nOn 29 October, Koscielny received praise for his solid performance in Arsenal's 5\u20133 away win against Chelsea. He scored his first goal of the season on 2 January 2012 in a 2\u20131 away defeat against Fulham. He scored his first Champions League goal against A.C. Milan in a 3\u20130 victory in the round of 16 second leg. On 13 May 2012, he scored the winning goal in a 3\u20132 victory against West Bromwich Albion to ensure that Arsenal finished third in the Premier League. He was voted as the team's fourth most important player by the fans in Arsenal's Player of the Season poll for his performances throughout the 2011\u201312 season.\n\n2012\u201313 season\n\nOn 24 July 2012, Koscielny signed a new long term contract with Arsenal. His first goal of the season was a late equaliser against champions Manchester City on 23 September 2012 in a match which ended 1\u20131. On 30 October, he scored a header from a corner in the 88th minute against Reading in the Football League Cup, helping Arsenal come back from 4\u20130 down to eventually win the game 7\u20135.\n\nOn 13 March 2013, Koscielny scored against Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena in the UEFA Champions League Last 16. His goal put Arsenal 2\u20130 ahead on the night and level at 3\u20133 on aggregate, but they still exited the competition on the away goals rule.\n\nOn 19 May, Koscielny scored the winning goal as Arsenal beat Newcastle United 1\u20130 at St James' Park in their final Premier League fixture of the season to secure a fourth-placed finish and qualification to the 2013\u201314 UEFA Champions League play-off round.\n\nKoscielny was voted as Arsenal's second best player of the season.\n\n2013\u201314 season\n\nKoscielny started the 2013\u201314 season by conceding a penalty and getting sent off in Arsenal's 3\u20131 Premier League opening day defeat at home to Aston Villa. However, his partnership with Per Mertesacker saw the Gunners achieve the joint-best defensive record in the Premier League at the halfway point of the season, as the team topped the table.\n\nOn 22 February 2014, Koscielny scored his first goal of the season in a 4\u20131 defeat of Sunderland. In the team's penultimate home match, Koscielny scored his second goal of the season in a 3\u20130 win against Newcastle United.\n\nOn 9 May 2014, Koscielny signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal.\n\nOn 17 May, Koscielny scored Arsenal's equalising goal as the team came from 2\u20130 down to defeat Hull City 3\u20132 in the 2014 FA Cup Final, winning his first piece of silverware with the club.\n\n2014\u201315 season\n\nKoscielny and Kieran Gibbs playing for Arsenal in a match against Chelsea on 5 October 2014\n\nOn 16 August 2014, Koscielny opened his goal-scoring account for the season, scoring Arsenal's first goal in the 2014\u201315 Premier League. The goal was header from a free-kick in first half stoppage time against Crystal Palace at the Emirates Stadium. After sustaining an achilles tendon injury during the October international break, Koscielny was absent from the Arsenal team for seven weeks. On 29 November, he returned to Arsenal's starting line-up alongside Per Mertesacker in central defence, as the Gunners kept a clean sheet in a 1\u20130 victory against West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns. In the team's following fixture at home to Southampton, Koscielny helped Arsenal to record a second consecutive clean sheet and 1\u20130 win.\n\nOn 11 January 2015, Koscielny scored the first goal in a 3\u20130 win over Stoke City. On 18 January, he started in central defence as Arsenal shut out defending champions Manchester City to win 2\u20130 at the City of Manchester Stadium. On 10 February, he scored the opening goal as Arsenal defeated Leicester City 2\u20131. On 30 May 2015, Koscielny was selected to start in the 2015 FA Cup Final, playing the full 90 minutes in a 4\u20130 defeat of Aston Villa at Wembley Stadium.\n\n2015\u201316 season\n\nKoscielny started every game in the first month of the season, excluding a 0\u20130 draw with rivals Liverpool at Emirates Stadium, due to an injury. Koscielny played a vital part as Arsenal won 5 games out of six in October to go second in the Premier League, with Koscielny scoring in successive Premier League wins against Everton and Swansea. With manager Arsene Wenger opting to play Gabriel Paulista ahead of vice-captain Per Mertesacker, Koscielny began appearing as captain in February, due to injuries to other captains Santi Cazorla & Mikel Arteta. This ended after a 3\u20132 defeat to Manchester United, when Koscielny missed four games through injury, including a North London derby at White Hart Lane. He returned in a 3\u20131 away defeat to Barcelona in the Champions League, as Arsenal exited the competition at the round of 16 for the sixth season running. Koscielny scored his fourth of the season in a 3\u20133 draw with West Ham.\n\n2016\u201317 season\n\nKoscielny started his first game of the season in a goalless draw against Leicester City. On 10 September, he was given the role of captain and scored a fine overhead kick to equalize for the Gunners in a game which they then won 2\u20131 against Southampton making him Arsenal's highest goal scoring defender in EPL history, with the landmark achieved on his 31st birthday. Koscielny was involved in a controversial incident at the end of Arsenal's 1\u20130 win over Burnley, in which Koscielny and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain were involved in a goal which appeared to be scored from an offside position after hitting Koscielny's arm. Neither the perceived deliberate handball or offside offenses were deemed to be infringements and the goal was later correctly credited to Koscielny. On 12 January 2017, Koscielny, alongside teammates Francis Coquelin and Olivier Giroud signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal. Two days later, he made his 200th appear for Arsenal in the Premier League on a 4\u20130 away victory against Swansea City.\n\nOn the last day of the 2016\u201317 season he received red card for a tackle on Enner Valencia of Everton. Arsenal lost an appeal and Koscielny was banned for three games, meaning he would miss FA Cup final.\n\nAlthough he was absent from the FA Cup final and the Community Shield, Koscielny lifted both trophies alongside Per Mertesacker."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/57356719", "page_content": "Last updated on .From the section Premier League\n\nManchester United's Luke Shaw and Tottenham's Son Heung-min are in a 2020-21 PFA Premier League Team of the Year dominated by Manchester City .\n\nSix of City's Premier League-winning squad - Ederson, Joao Cancelo, John Stones, Ruben Dias, Kevin de Bruyne and Ilkay Gundogan - make the team, which is voted for by fellow players.\n\nUnited's Bruno Fernandes also makes it.\n\nTottenham's Harry Kane and Liverpool's Mohamed Salah, who scored 23 and 22 league goals respectively, are in.\n\nDespite winning the Champions League - as well as reaching the FA Cup final and finishing fourth in the Premier League - no Chelsea players are included.\n\nManchester City won the 2020-21 Premier League with a 12-point cushion\n\nThere is no room for City midfielder Phil Foden, 21, who made 50 appearances in all competitions in 2020-21, helping the club win the Premier League and Carabao Cup, and reach the Champions League final.\n\nKeeper Kasper Schmeichel, who inspired Leicester City to a first FA Cup triumph, also misses out\n\nThe PFA Team of the Year was voted for by members of the Professional Footballers' Association, the players' union.\n\nBelgium midfielder De Bruyne is the only player to retain his place from the team of 2019-20.\n\nGOALKEEPER - Ederson (Man City)\n\nEderson kept 19 clean sheets in the Premier League in 2020-21\n\nDid you know?

He was born on the 10th of September, 1985 in Tulle. Koscielny is a center back who is currently the vice-captain of the English Premier League team Arsenal.\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchman began his career with Guingamp in 2004 which has produced players like Didier Drogba and Florent Malouda. Koscielny played as a fullback for Guingamp in most of the matches.However, he felt that center back was his forte and this made him join Tours FC to take a chance at center back.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his debut season with Tours FC in 2007, Koscielny showed remarkable progress and played a major role in his team\u2019s promotion to Ligue 1. He was also named in the best XI of the season.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe center back continued his good form with Lorient FC in 2009 where he was regarded as one of the best players in his position. He was developing reputation as a clever and an agile defender. His achievements and footballing potential attracted Arsenal, ultimately moving to the Premier League side for a fee of \u00a38.45 million the following season.\n\n\n\n\n\nDebut\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurent Koscielny had the opportunity to represent Poland but decided to ply his trade with France. He made his first appearance for France on the 9th of February, 2011 in a friendly match against United States. Koscielny played the entire game and his side sealed a 1-0 victory. On the 4th of June, 2016, Koscielny scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland.\n\n\n\n\n\nRise to Glory\n\n\n\n\n\nKoscielny had a great debut season with Arsenal. He was constantly making great tackles and preventing the opposition from penetrating their back line. In 2011, Koscielny had one of his best performances till date that saw Arsenal beat Barcelona 2-1 in the round of 16 Champions League tie.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchman was a great asset to the team as apart from acting as a defender, he had a great goal scoring ability. Till date, Koscielny has scored 24 goals for Arsenal. He is the highest scoring defender for Arsenal in the history of EPL. He is regarded as one of the most important players for Arsenal in the past seven years.\n\n\n\n\n\nKoscielny has won the FA Cup with Arsenal in 2014, 2015 and 2017. He has also won the FA Community Shield in 2014, 2015 and 2017. The center back has made a major contribution in his team\u2019s success in the FA Cup over the years.\n\n\n\n\n\nLow Points\n\n\n\n\n\nKoscielny has got more than thirty yellow cards and as many as five red cards. This has forced him out of a few crucial encounters and has affected the team\u2019s performance. He has missed more games due to suspension and not because of injury.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe center back must work on preventing harsh tackles so as to represent Arsenal in more and more games and increase their chances of winning more trophies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchman is yet to win the Premier League with Arsenal.

He is vice-captain of Arsenal.\n\nBorn in Tulle, Koscielny began his football career playing for a host of youth clubs before moving to Guingamp in 2003, where he quickly progressed through the youth ranks, making his professional debut the following season. After becoming frustrated at being played out of position as a right back, he joined Tours for an undisclosed fee, quickly establishing himself as the team\u2019s star player in his desired position, ultimately aiding in the club\u2019s promotion into Ligue 1, while also being named in the Ligue 2 Team of the Season.[3] Koscielny continued his impressive performances following a \u20ac1.7 million transfer to fellow French outfit Lorient in 2009, receiving multiple plaudits for his performances, largely cultivating a reputation as a clever, agile, ball-playing defender.[3] His achievements and footballing potential attracted Arsenal, ultimately moving to the Premier League side for a fee of \u00a38.45 million the following season.\n\nFollowing his arrival to England, Koscielny has widely been regarded to be one of the best players in his position, as well as one of the best in the world.[4][5] He has since established himself as a core component in the Arsenal first team, as well as contributing with a host of individual performances, including aiding in ending the club\u2019s nine-year trophy drought, scoring a crucial equalizer en route to winning the FA Cup in 2014. He was also crucial in further club successes that followed, winning another two FA Cups and the FA Community Shield on three occasions.\n\nDespite having the ability to represent Poland, Koscielny instead decided to represent France, and first appeared up for the national team against Brazil in February 2011.[6] Koscielny has since become a regular starter for the nation in every major tournament that they have appeared in, including UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup, while also leading France to the final of UEFA Euro 2016. He scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland in 2016,[7] and has since amassed forty-nine appearances for the national side.\n\nPrior to the beginning of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Koscielny announced that he would be retiring from international football after the competition, and thus no longer be playing for France.\n\nKoscielny was born in Tulle, Corr\u00e8ze. His career began in 2004 with Guingamp, a team that had produced such talents as Didier Drogba and Florent Malouda. Three years later, Koscielny was forced to take stock and drop down to the French third tier. He made 47 appearances for Guingamp, between 2004 and 2007, mostly as a right fullback.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2007, Koscielny joined Tours FC, deciding that he wanted a chance at centre back. He showed remarkable improvement in aerial ability and positional awareness that limited him to just three yellow cards. During the 2008\u201309 season, Koscielny made 34 Ligue 2 appearances, scoring 5 goals from defence, and was named in the division\u2019s best XI at the end of the season.\n\nArsenal confirmed the signing on 7 July 2010 and Koscielny was handed the club\u2019s number 6 shirt, previously worn by Philippe Senderos, who had moved to Fulham earlier in the summer. Wenger explained he bought Koscielny due to the fact he added height to the team and Arsenal were low on centre backs.[10] Koscielny made his debut against Barnet in a pre-season friendly in July 2010. One month later in his competitive debut against Liverpool at Anfield, he was sent off in the 94th minute for a second bookable offence. Both of his yellow cards were shown beyond 90 minutes. The game ended in a 1\u20131 draw with both teams having debut players sent off.[11] He scored his first goal for Arsenal on 11 September 2010, in a 4\u20131 win against Bolton Wanderers.[12]\n\nKoscielny made his debut in European competition on 15 September 2010, when he partnered S\u00e9bastien Squillaci in a 6\u20130 win over Braga at the Emirates Stadium. Koscielny was praised for performances against Sunderland and made a brilliant tackle against Tottenham Hotspur to stop Aaron Lennon from scoring during their Football League Cup tie. On 27 October, he blocked a shot off the line and provided an assist to Theo Walcott against Newcastle United in the fourth round of the League Cup, where Arsenal went on to win the match 4\u20130 at St James\u2019 Park. Koscielny was given a straight red card in Arsenal\u2019s 0\u20131 loss at home against Newcastle United on 7 November 2010. This was his second sending off of the season.\n\nKoscielny playing for Arsenal on 10 September 2011 against Swansea City.\n\nOn 25 January 2011, Koscielny scored the second goal in the 3\u20130 win over Ipswich Town in the League Cup semi-final second leg win at the Emirates Stadium. Throughout January 2011, Koscielny and Johan Djourou were a part of a defence that did not concede a goal in the Premier League. On 1 February, he scored his third goal of the season, which proved to be the winner in a 2\u20131 turn around victory over Everton. Koscielny had arguably his best performance to date for Arsenal in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16 match against Barcelona. The match ended in a 2\u20131 home win for Arsenal. Koscielny\u2019s performances were applauded and praised in many media reports of the game. Former Arsenal defender, Martin Keown, said his performance was \u201cimpressive\u201d and \u201cmagnificent throughout\u201d.[13] On 27 February, in the last minute of the 2011 Football League Cup Final, Koscielny was involved in a mix-up with his goalkeeper Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny, which resulted in Birmingham City striker Obafemi Martins scoring the winning goal.[14]\n\n2011\u201312 season\n\nKoscielny and Fernando Torres in a Premier League match on 21 April 2012.\n\nKoscielny started the 2011\u201312 season alongside Thomas Vermaelen in central defence. Koscielny was injured and taken off the pitch 10 minutes into a 2\u20130 home loss to Liverpool on 20 August 2011. However, he returned to the starting line-up Arsenal\u2019s biggest ever Premier League defeat, losing 8\u20132 to Manchester United at Old Trafford. On 17 September, Koscielny scored an own goal as Arsenal lost 4\u20133 to Blackburn Rovers in the Premier League. He went on to be named man of the match away at Olympique Marseille in the Champions League, where Arsenal won 1\u20130 at the Stade V\u00e9lodrome, keeping their first clean sheet in a Champions League away game since 18 August 2009 against Celtic, where the Gunners had won 2\u20130.\n\nOn 29 October, Koscielny received praise for his solid performance in Arsenal\u2019s 5\u20133 away win against Chelsea. He scored his first goal of the season on 2 January 2012 in a 2\u20131 away defeat against Fulham. He scored his first Champions League goal against A.C. Milan in a 3\u20130 victory in the round of 16 second leg. On 13 May 2012, he scored the winning goal in a 3\u20132 victory against West Bromwich Albion to ensure that Arsenal finished third in the Premier League. He was voted as the team\u2019s fourth most important player by the fans in Arsenal\u2019s Player of the Season poll for his performances throughout the 2011\u201312 season.[15]\n\n2012\u201313 season\n\nOn 24 July 2012, Koscielny signed a new long term contract with Arsenal.[16][17][18] His first goal of the season was a late equaliser against champions Manchester City on 23 September 2012 in a match which ended 1\u20131.[19] On 30 October, he scored a header from a corner in the 88th minute against Reading in the Football League Cup, helping Arsenal come back from 4\u20130 down to eventually win the game 7\u20135.[20]\n\nOn 13 March 2013, Koscielny scored against Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena in the UEFA Champions League Last 16. His goal put Arsenal 2\u20130 ahead on the night and level at 3\u20133 on aggregate, but they still exited the competition on the away goals rule.[21]\n\nOn 19 May, Koscielny scored the winning goal as Arsenal beat Newcastle United 1\u20130 at St James\u2019 Park in their final Premier League fixture of the season to secure a fourth-placed finish and qualification to the 2013\u201314 UEFA Champions League play-off round.[22]\n\nKoscielny was voted as Arsenal\u2019s second best player of the season.[23]\n\n2013\u201314 season\n\nKoscielny started the 2013\u201314 season by conceding a penalty and getting sent off in Arsenal\u2019s 3\u20131 Premier League opening day defeat at home to Aston Villa.[24] However, his partnership with Per Mertesacker saw the Gunners achieve the joint-best defensive record in the Premier League at the halfway point of the season, as the team topped the table.[25]\n\nOn 22 February 2014, Koscielny scored his first goal of the season in a 4\u20131 defeat of Sunderland.[26] In the team\u2019s penultimate home match, Koscielny scored his second goal of the season in a 3\u20130 win against Newcastle United.[26]\n\nOn 9 May 2014, Koscielny signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal.[27]\n\nOn 17 May, Koscielny scored Arsenal\u2019s equalising goal as the team came from 2\u20130 down to defeat Hull City 3\u20132 in the 2014 FA Cup Final, winning his first piece of silverware with the club.[28]\n\n2014\u201315 season\n\nKoscielny and Kieran Gibbs playing for Arsenal in a match against Chelsea on 5 October 2014\n\nOn 16 August 2014, Koscielny opened his goal-scoring account for the season, scoring Arsenal\u2019s first goal in the 2014\u201315 Premier League. The goal was header from a free-kick in first half stoppage time against Crystal Palace at the Emirates Stadium.[29] After sustaining an achilles tendon injury during the October international break, Koscielny was absent from the Arsenal team for seven weeks.[30] On 29 November, he returned to Arsenal\u2019s starting line-up alongside Per Mertesacker in central defence, as the Gunners kept a clean sheet in a 1\u20130 victory against West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns.[31] In the team\u2019s following fixture at home to Southampton, Koscielny helped Arsenal to record a second consecutive clean sheet and 1\u20130 win.[32]\n\nOn 11 January 2015, Koscielny scored the first goal in a 3\u20130 win over Stoke City.[33] On 18 January, he started in central defence as Arsenal shut out defending champions Manchester City to win 2\u20130 at the City of Manchester Stadium.[34] On 10 February, he scored the opening goal as Arsenal defeated Leicester City 2\u20131.[35] On 30 May 2015, Koscielny was selected to start in the 2015 FA Cup Final, playing the full 90 minutes in a 4\u20130 defeat of Aston Villa at Wembley Stadium.[36]\n\n2015\u201316 season\n\nKoscielny started every game in the first month of the season, excluding a 0\u20130 draw with rivals Liverpool at Emirates Stadium,[37] due to an injury. Koscielny played a vital part as Arsenal won 5 games out of six in October to go second in the Premier League, with Koscielny scoring in successive Premier League wins against Everton and Swansea.[38][39] With manager Arsene Wenger opting to play Gabriel Paulista ahead of vice-captain Per Mertesacker, Koscielny began appearing as captain in February, due to injuries to other captains Santi Cazorla & Mikel Arteta. This ended after a 3\u20132 defeat to Manchester United, when Koscielny missed four games through injury, including a North London derby at White Hart Lane.[40] He returned in a 3\u20131 away defeat to Barcelona in the Champions League, as Arsenal exited the competition at the round of 16 for the sixth season running.[41] Koscielny scored his fourth of the season in a 3\u20133 draw with West Ham.[42]\n\n2016\u201317 season\n\nKoscielny started his first game of the season in a goalless draw against Leicester City. On 10 September, he was given the role of captain and scored a fine overhead kick to equalize for the Gunners in a game which they then won 2\u20131 against Southampton making him Arsenal\u2019s highest goal scoring defender in EPL history, with the landmark achieved on his 31st birthday.[43] Koscielny was involved in a controversial incident at the end of Arsenal\u2019s 1\u20130 win over Burnley, in which Koscielny and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain were involved in a goal which appeared to be scored from an offside position after hitting Koscielny\u2019s arm. Neither the perceived deliberate handball or offside offenses were deemed to be infringements and the goal was later correctly credited to Koscielny.[44][45][46] On 12 January 2017, Koscielny, alongside teammates Francis Coquelin and Olivier Giroud signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal.[47] Two days later, he made his 200th appearance for Arsenal in the Premier League on a 4\u20130 away victory against Swansea City.[48][49]\n\nOn the last day of the 2016\u201317 season he received red card for a tackle on Enner Valencia of Everton. Arsenal lost an appeal and Koscielny was banned for three games, meaning he would miss FA Cup final.[50]\n\nAlthough he was absent from the FA Cup final and the Community Shield, Koscielny lifted both trophies alongside Per Mertesacker.\n\nKoscielny was called up to the French national team on 3 February 2011. Before his call up for France, Koscielny was also eligible to play for Poland and initially considered applying for Polish citizenship.[6] In August 2010, it was reported that he had not submitted an application and cancelled a meeting with Poland national team coach Franciszek Smuda in Warsaw on 7 August. Koscielny later declared that his priority was to play for France.[53]\n\nKoscielny was called up to the French team for the first time on 3 February 2011, for the team\u2019s friendly versus Brazil on 9 February.[54][55] Koscielny made his first appearance for les Bleus in a friendly match against the United States on 11 November, playing the entire match in a 1\u20130 win.\n\nHe made his first appearance in a major tournament during UEFA Euro 2012, when he played the entire match in a 2\u20130 defeat to Spain in the quarter-finals but was voted Man of the Match by the French media. On 15 November 2013, he was sent off in a 2014 World Cup qualifying play-off against Ukraine.\n\nOn 13 May 2014, Koscielny was named in Didier Deschamps\u2019 squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.[56] He made his FIFA World Cup debut as a substitute for the injured Mamadou Sakho in a 5\u20132 defeat of Switzerland in the team\u2019s second group match.[57] He was then named in the starting line-up for the next match against Ecuador, helping the team to a clean sheet in a 0\u20130 draw.[58] On 4 June 2016, Koscielny scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland."}, {"url": "https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/0265-1160b7e1bca5-2395e11c09bc-1000--men-s-team-of-the-year-stats/", "page_content": "The UEFA.com fans' Men's Team of the Year 2020 has been revealed, with almost 6 million votes cast over the course of more than a month.\n\nTeam of the Year 2020\n\n\n\nAll users who submitted a team will now be entered into a prize draw to win a VIP trip to both the men's and the women's UEFA Champions League finals.

He looked uncomfortable on occasion in the first half - twice appearing to struggle back to his feet after falling in a 50-50 challenge.\n\nHe was replaced in the 83rd minute, having created the goal and three other good chances. His four key passes were more than any Arsenal player has created in a single Europa League game.\n\nLacazette was perhaps the more surprising selection - given he has played a regular and prominent role for Emery in the Premier League so far this season.\n\nHis goal, taken with five smart touches and a zipping low finish, was the game's only true moment of quality, as Arsenal soon after assumed full control of an already sedate fixture now removed of any real jeopardy.\n\nOne of very few points of interest was the impact of the side's youth players, and perhaps the brightest showing came from Saka, who came alive in the second half especially.\n\nAside from Lacazette, he was the only player among both sides to have a shot on target, and it was his excellent cross that found Nketiah for the disallowed goal.\n\nMan of the match - (Bukayo Saka)\n\nSaka had a total of three shots on target and also made one key pass\n\n'His personality is important for us'\n\nArsenal manager Unai Emery: \"We have the responsibility to give every young player chances, first to train with us and to be demanding with their performances.\n\n\"Saka played with a good performance, with a very big personality, his personality is very important for us to continue trying to go 1v1 and break lines with his quality.\n\n\"He played with a very big personality and sometimes with a very good performance.

Koscielny is the vice-captain of Arsenal. He has been described as a clever, agile and ball-playing defender.\n\nKoscielny was born in the city of Tulle and began his football career playing for a host of amateur and youth clubs such as Brive, Tulle Corr\u00e8ze and Limoges. In 2003, he moved to Guingamp, where he made his professional debut the following year. Koscielny joined Tours for an undisclosed fee to play in the third tier of the French league in 2007 and enjoyed promotion with his new side before being named in the Ligue 2 Team of the Season the following campaign. In 2009, newly promoted Ligue 1 side Lorient signed Koscielny for around \u20ac1.7 million, and his performances caught the eye of Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who signed him in 2010. Since then, he is regarded as one of the best players in his position in the Premier League.\n\nKoscielny was first called up to the French national team on 4 February 2011 and has since represented the country at UEFA Euro 2012, UEFA Euro 2016, and at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Prior to his call-up for France, he was also eligible to play for Poland, as a result of his family roots.\n\nClub career\n\nEarly career\n\nKoscielny was born in Tulle, Corr\u00e8ze. His career began in 2004 with Guingamp, a team that had produced such talents as Didier Drogba and Florent Malouda. Three years later, Koscielny was forced to take stock and drop down to the French third tier. He made 47 appearances for Guingamp, between 2004 and 2007, mostly as a right fullback.\n\nIn 2007, Koscielny joined Tours FC, deciding that he wanted a chance at centre back. He showed remarkable improvement in aerial ability and positional awareness that limited him to just three yellow cards. During the 2008\u201309 season, Koscielny made 34 Ligue 2 appearances, scoring 5 goals from defence, and was named in the division's best XI at the end of the season.\n\nLorient\n\nOn 16 June 2009, newly promoted Ligue 1 side FC Lorient signed Koscielny on a four-year contract for around \u20ac1.7 million. He established himself as a starter and played in his preferred centre-back position. Over one season at the club, he scored 3 goals in 35 appearances. On 7 March 2010 Koscielny tapped in his first Ligue 1 goal against Olympique Marseille at Stade V\u00e9lodrome in the 65th minute in a 1\u20131 draw. Koscielny became a fan favourite when he scored his second goal with a header deep in injury time against Montpellier in a 2\u20132 draw after a cross from Olivier Monterrubio.\n\nHe scored another against Bordeaux after 11 minutes. However, he received a red card 15 minutes later for a foul in the penalty area against his future Arsenal teammate Marouane Chamakh. Koscielny helped Lorient to finish the campaign in 7th place; its best finish in Ligue 1. An impressive season culminated in reports from French daily Ouest-France that the defender was training with the Arsenal reserves ahead of an official announcement. On 6 July 2010, Koscielny agreed personal terms with Arsenal. Arsenal's initial offer for Koscielny was believed to be in the region of \u00a34 million, while they were then prepared to do a deal that would also involve youngster Francis Coquelin moving on loan in the opposite direction, which Lorient rejected. During the summer transfer window of 2010 reports began to emerge in late June that a deal had been reached to bring Koscielny to Arsenal for a reported sum of \u00a38.45 million.\n\nArsenal\n\n2010\u201311 season\n\n\"I don't believe any French player would have refused to come and play for Arsenal. It took me four years to go from the bench of Ligue 2 to Arsenal so it is a great achievement. I have been on the crest of a wave for the last few years. But it is just the beginning; I haven't proved anything yet. Arsenal is a reference for football.\" Laurent Koscielny\n\nArsenal confirmed the signing on 7 July 2010 and Koscielny was handed the club's number 6 shirt, previously worn by Philippe Senderos, who had moved to Fulham earlier in the summer. Wenger explained he bought Koscielny due to the fact he added height to the team and Arsenal were low on centre backs. Koscielny made his debut against Barnet in a pre-season friendly in July 2010. One month later in his competitive debut against Liverpool at Anfield, he was sent off in the 94th minute for a second bookable offence. Both of his yellow cards were shown beyond 90 minutes. The game ended in a 1\u20131 draw with both teams having debut players sent off. He scored his first goal for Arsenal on 11 September 2010, in a 4\u20131 win against Bolton Wanderers.\n\nKoscielny made his debut in European competition on 15 September 2010, when he partnered S\u00e9bastien Squillaci in a 6\u20130 win over Braga at the Emirates Stadium. Koscielny was praised for performances against Sunderland and made a brilliant tackle against Tottenham Hotspur to stop Aaron Lennon from scoring during their Football League Cup tie. On 27 October, he blocked a shot off the line and provided an assist to Theo Walcott against Newcastle United in the fourth round of the League Cup, where Arsenal went on to win the match 4\u20130 at St James' Park. Koscielny was given a straight red card in Arsenal's 0\u20131 loss at home against Newcastle United on 7 November 2010. This was his second sending off of the season.\n\nKoscielny playing for Arsenal on 10 September 2011 against Swansea City.\n\nOn 25 January 2011, Koscielny scored the second goal in the 3\u20130 win over Ipswich Town in the League Cup semi-final second leg win at the Emirates Stadium. Throughout January 2011, Koscielny and Johan Djourou were a part of a defence that did not concede a goal in the Premier League. On 1 February, he scored his third goal of the season, which proved to be the winner in a 2\u20131 turn around victory over Everton. Koscielny had arguably his best performance to date for Arsenal in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16 match against Barcelona. The match ended in a 2\u20131 home win for Arsenal. Koscielny's performances were applauded and praised in many media reports of the game. Former Arsenal defender, Martin Keown, said his performance was \"impressive\" and \"magnificent throughout\". On 27 February, in the last minute of the 2011 Football League Cup Final, Koscielny was involved in a mix-up with his goalkeeper Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny, which resulted in Birmingham City striker Obafemi Martins scoring the winning goal.\n\n2011\u201312 season\n\nKoscielny and Fernando Torres in a Premier League match on 21 April 2012.\n\nKoscielny started the 2011\u201312 season alongside Thomas Vermaelen in central defence. Koscielny was injured and taken off the pitch 10 minutes into a 2\u20130 home loss to Liverpool on 20 August 2011. However, he returned to the starting line-up Arsenal's biggest ever Premier League defeat, losing 8\u20132 to Manchester United at Old Trafford. On 17 September, Koscielny scored an own goal as Arsenal lost 4\u20133 to Blackburn Rovers in the Premier League. He went on to be named man of the match away at Olympique Marseille in the Champions League, where Arsenal won 1\u20130 at the Stade V\u00e9lodrome, keeping their first clean sheet in a Champions League away game since 18 August 2009 against Celtic, where the Gunners had won 2\u20130.\n\nOn 29 October, Koscielny received praise for his solid performance in Arsenal's 5\u20133 away win against Chelsea. He scored his first goal of the season on 2 January 2012 in a 2\u20131 away defeat against Fulham. He scored his first Champions League goal against A.C. Milan in a 3\u20130 victory in the round of 16 second leg. On 13 May 2012, he scored the winning goal in a 3\u20132 victory against West Bromwich Albion to ensure that Arsenal finished third in the Premier League. He was voted as the team's fourth most important player by the fans in Arsenal's Player of the Season poll for his performances throughout the 2011\u201312 season.\n\n2012\u201313 season\n\nOn 24 July 2012, Koscielny signed a new long term contract with Arsenal.

However, his partnership with Per Mertesacker saw the Gunners achieve the joint-best defensive record in the Premier League at the halfway point of the season, as the team topped the table.\n\nOn 22 February 2014, Koscielny scored his first goal of the season in a 4\u20131 defeat of Sunderland.

The goal was header from a free-kick in first half stoppage time against Crystal Palace at the Emirates Stadium. After sustaining an achilles tendon injury during the October international break, Koscielny was absent from the Arsenal team for seven weeks. On 29 November, he returned to Arsenal's starting line-up alongside Per Mertesacker in central defence, as the Gunners kept a clean sheet in a 1\u20130 victory against West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns.

When one country has a problem with another they should not give the final to that country.\n\n\u201cFor us it is difficult because we want to have Micki with us. He is an important player for us.\u201d"}]}
