{"Steven Threet was the starting quarterback for the Wolverines in 2007.": [{"url": "https://www.michigandaily.com/uncategorized/michigan-quarterback-threet-will-transfer/", "page_content": "Redshirt freshman quarterback Steven Threet will transfer from Michigan, according to a statement released early this morning.\n\n\u201cI have decided to transfer from the University of Michigan,\u201d Threet wrote in the statement. \u201cI have requested and received my release. I do not yet know where I will continue my collegiate career, and have no further comment until that decision is made.\u201d\n\nCalls to Steven Threet\u2019s cell phone last night from The Michigan Daily were not returned. When contacted last night by the Daily, Threet\u2019s father, Jewel Threet, said his son would release a statement today and declined further comment.\n\nAn Athletic Department spokesperson also declined to comment about the statement.\n\nThe Wolverines\u2019 starter in 8 of 12 games last year, Threet transferred from Georgia Tech prior to the 2007 season. He finished last season 102-of-200 for 1,105 yards, nine touchdowns and seven interceptions.\n\nMichigan signed two quarterbacks, Tate Forcier and Denard Robinson, on National Signing Day on Feb. 5. Forcier, a four-star recruit according to rivals.com, enrolled early in January and will practice with the team this spring.\n\nRedshirt sophomores Nick Sheridan and David Cone are the only returning quarterbacks on Michigan\u2019s roster. Sheridan started four games last season. Freshman Justin Feagin, who began last season at quarterback and moved to slot receiver, will also return.\n\nPhil Jacobs, Threet\u2019s coach at Adrian High School, said yesterday he didn\u2019t know about Threet\u2019s plan to transfer.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s pretty much kept it to himself and his family,\u201d Jacobs said yesterday before the quarterback announced his intention to leave the Wolverines. \u201cHe\u2019s going to do what\u2019s best and do the right thing. I\u2019m supportive of the kid.\u201d\n\nThreet enrolled at Georgia Tech in January 2007 but transferred after spring practice. He cited the departure of Yellow Jacket offensive coordinator Patrick Nix, who primarily recruited Threet, as the main reason for the transfer.\n\nAlthough Michigan had five-star quarterback Ryan Mallett, Threet told Jacobs he wasn\u2019t intimidated. Threet thought he outplayed Mallett at Michigan\u2019s quarterback camp after his junior year of high school, Jacobs told The Michigan Daily in September 2008.\n\nWhen Threet decided to transfer to Michigan, Jacobs said the quarterback called him with a simple message.\n\n\u201d \u2018Coach, I\u2019m going to go back to Michigan, and I\u2019m going to beat Mallett out for that starting job,\u2019 \u201d Jacobs said Threet told him.\n\nThreet sat out the 2007 season because of NCAA transfer rules, and Mallett transferred to Arkansas after that season.\n\nThreet competed with Sheridan, a former walk-on, during spring and fall practices for the starting job. Sheridan started in the season opener, but Threet got the starting nod in the next game against Miami (Ohio).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating not to hit the passes to help the team win more than anything,\u201d Threet said after the Miami game, in which he went 6-of-13 for 63 yards, including one 50-yard screen pass. \u201cSome passes, some plays, I\u2019d like to have back. But that\u2019s the situation, so you just keep on working, and try and come back next week and make the plays.\u201d\n\nThreet\u2019s breakout start came against Notre Dame on Sept. 13. In South Bend, he went 16-of-23 for 175 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions.\n\nHe started seven more games but missed two of Michigan\u2019s final three games with a shoulder injury. He didn\u2019t play at Minnesota and didn\u2019t make the trip to Ohio State.\n\nThreet said early last season that being Michigan\u2019s quarterback wouldn\u2019t affect his laid-back personality.\n\n\u201cI feel that I can be focused, but be myself at the same time,\u201d Threet said. \u201cMe as a person, I can\u2019t be uptight. I don\u2019t like that feeling, so that\u2019s not how I\u2019m going to approach a game.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Nate Sandals and Joe Stapleton contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nThink the loss of Steven Threet is a setback for the Wolverines?

He addressed that and much more this week in a wide-ranging Q&A with 247Sports this week on campus, with Sanders and Colorado providing behind-the-scenes access to one of its summer football camps.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This interview has been edited for clarity.\n\n247Sports: What have you seen so far from your new team?\n\nSanders: \"Want, determination, effort, camaraderie. It is a collection of men \u2014 some wanting a second chance. And some of them are just trying to get to the next level. But all of them share a desperate want to get where they want to go as quickly as possible.\"\n\n247Sports: What do you say to people like Pat Narduzzi who have been critical of your roster overhaul?\n\nSanders: \"What was his situation when he came to Pitt? He had a different situation than me. He is not mad at me, he is mad at the situation in football now that allowed his best player to leave a year ago. He\u2019s not mad at me, he\u2019s using me to shoot bullets at another coach who he has an issue with. I don\u2019t know who he is; if he walked in here right now I wouldn\u2019t know him.\"\n\n247Sports: There was a lot of smoke surrounding Travis Hunter when he entered the portal: Would he follow you to Colorado or land somewhere else? He obviously enrolled at Colorado. What are your expectations for him this season?\n\nSanders: \"People offered Travis Hunter a bag. About $1.5 million to try to lure him and buy him out of the transfer portal. But Travis is not the kind of guy that can be bought. He isn't built like that. Travis is a relational young man that is built on relationships and stability. And that\u2019s what he wanted and desired. That is why he decided to ride and stay with us. I cannot wait until they see what he is capable of doing in these next couple of years. Because he will be a top-5 or top-3 pick after his junior year. But the sky's the limit, he is going to play both ways and he is a vital part of the offense and the defense, and he wants that.\n\n247Sports: How do you manage him playing both ways?\n\nSanders: \"We don\u2019t have to manage that. His game is his game. It\u2019s nothing that we manage. Travis is bored when he is not on the field, Travis is not intertwined with things when he is not on the field. Travis likes to be in the action, that\u2019s who he is.\"\n\n247Sports: As I watched the workouts this week, one of the things that has stood out to me is the vocal leadership of Shedeur Sanders. You\u2019ve been coaching him from youth, to high school and now college football. How has Shedeur grown as a leader this spring in the transition to Colorado?\n\nSanders: \"It\u2019s funny telling you this because his brother is sitting here filming this, but [Shedeur\u2019s] nickname is \u201cGrown.\u201d Because he has always been truly mature for his age at different stages of his life that he has encountered and different obstacles he has overcome. He is rock-steady. Grown doesn't get flustered. He is not a 'ra-ra' guy. He's not a 'I\u2019m gonna talk about what he\u2019s going to do\u201d [type of person]. It\u2019s not too many things in life that will get him up or get him down. He is like a baseball player. Baseball players are rock-steady. Football players are up because they have to practice for six days and play one. Baseball players have to do it every day. That is his character. And I love the expectation that he has placed on himself. My expectation of him is far less than his expectations he places on himself. Because not only does he have tremendous expectations, but he is a Sanders. And he knows what that means.\"\n\nGet offseason and recruiting information on your favorite college team for $1 for first month\n\n247Sports: A lot of roster changes have been made.\n\nSanders: \"Necessary changes. Say: 'Necessary.'\n\n247Sports: How do you like your team going into the fall as opposed to what you had in the spring?\n\nSanders: \"Apples and Oranges. You can\u2019t compare the two. You are talking about a situation in which we inherited a team that was 1-11. And everyone knows there are going to be some changes. I don\u2019t understand how you would think that the coaching staff is the only thing that deserved a change. Now when you rid yourself of the entire coaching staff, you think you are going to keep all the kids? That doesn\u2019t make sense to me. And that just doesn\u2019t make sense whatsoever when the previous staff was responsible for securing those kids. That\u2019s not the way that this game is played with us.\"\n\n247Sports: From a recruiting standpoint, if a young man wants to play for Colorado, what does he need to have?\n\nSanders: \"First he needs to have his grades correct and needs to be eligible through our compliance department. Then, he needs to be tough, smart, fast, disciplined and with character. And he has to understand that this coaching staff is old school. Not old fools, but old school. A lot of our principles and the way we attack the game comes from way back when. And we are still that way because that way is the way and it has not failed us yet. So it\u2019s a tremendous expectation, but we go hard and we play fast. And you have to love this thing. We don\u2019t want you to be 'in like' with it. We want you to be 'in love' with it.\"\n\nRELATED: 5 things Carl Reed learned from Colorado's spring game"}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Steven_Threet", "page_content": "What we do. Every page goes through several hundred of perfecting techniques; in live mode. Quite the same Wikipedia. Just better.\n\nAmerican football player (born 1989)\n\nSteven Charles Threet (born January 2, 1989) is a former American football quarterback who played for both Michigan and Arizona State. He was the starting quarterback for the Arizona State Sun Devils. During the 2010 season Threet completed 208 of 336 passes for 2,553 yards, 18 touchdowns and 16 interceptions. He passed for a career-high 391 yards and three touchdowns against Northern Arizona in September 2010.\n\nHe threw for 4,824 yards and 49 touchdowns as a high school player in Adrian, Michigan, and was ranked by Rivals.com as the No. 9 quarterback prospect in the nation in the Class of 2006. Threet committed to Georgia Tech and enrolled early there in January 2007.\n\nAfter the coaches who had recruited him left the program, Threet announced in July 2007 that he was transferring to the University of Michigan under head coach Lloyd Carr. Carr was replaced before the 2008 season by Rich Rodriguez. After sitting out the 2007 season under NCAA transfer rules, the redshirt freshman Threet would go on to start at quarterback in eight of Michigan's 12 games.\n\nLater that same year, Threet transferred to Arizona State University, citing the incompatibility of his playing style as a traditional pro style dropback passer with the spread offense of Rodriguez. After sitting out the 2009 season, Threet had two years of eligibility remaining with Arizona State. On August 30, 2010, Arizona State head coach, Dennis Erickson, announced that Threet would be the starting quarterback for the coming season.\n\nEarly years\n\nThreet was born in Adrian, Michigan, and graduated from Adrian High School. During his senior year in high school, he accumulated 1,896 passing yards and threw 20 touchdown passes. He also had had 1,528 passing yards and 19 touchdowns as a junior. In all, he threw for 4,824 yards and 49 touchdowns in three seasons at Adrian High School.[1]\n\nAs a high school senior, Threet was four-star prospect and the No. 9 quarterback prospect nationally according to Rivals.com.[2] He was also named to The Detroit News Division II All-State first team. In August 2006, Detroit Free Press sports writer Chris Silva wrote that Threet \"has the brains of a Steven Q. Urkel and an arm of a young Peyton Manning. He can audible at the line of scrimmage, like NFL star Peyton Manning, and absorb a playbook faster than Urkel could memorize physics formulas. Threet had Ivy League schools such as Harvard and Princeton clamoring over his smarts and skills.\"[1]\n\nThreet had offers from several major schools, including Wisconsin, Stanford, Illinois, North Carolina State, Indiana, Cincinnati and Georgia Tech.[1][3]\n\nGeorgia Tech\n\nThreet committed to Georgia Tech in July 2006 and enrolled early in January 2007.[4][5] His high school coach recalled, \"He fell in love with the recruiters and the position coaches at Georgia Tech.\"[3] Soon after Threet arrived at Georgia Tech, both of the coaches who had recruited him took jobs elsewhere.[3] During spring practice in April 2007, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that \"Threet appeared to take the lead over Calvin Booker for the No. 2 quarterback spot,\" completing 7 of 11 passes for 51 yards and a touchdown while working with the No. 1 offense.[6]\n\nUniversity of Michigan\n\nIn July 2007 Threet announced he would transfer to the University of Michigan.[7][8] While Lloyd Carr was still head coach at Michigan, he had also recruited five-star quarterback Ryan Mallett. Threet called his former high school coach and left a message saying, \"Coach, I'm going to go back to Michigan, and I'm going to beat [Ryan] Mallett out for that starting job.\"[3] In a July 2007 interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Threet explained his decision: \"The biggest thing is that the two coaches that recruited me took jobs at other schools, and that happened after I got there. People have been asking if it was homesickness, or classes were too hard, or if it was all the competition at Tech. It was not any of those at all. I had a 3.76 grade-point my first semester, and the competition (at Michigan) is as good or better.\"[1][9][10]\n\nThreet had been ineligible after his transfer from Georgia Tech. During the 2007 season, the majority of the snaps were taken by senior Chad Henne. However, Henne was sidelined by injury enough that Mallett received a considerable amount of playing time, appearing in 11 games (to Henne's 10) and attempting 141 passes (to Henne's 278). Carr, who had recruited both Mallett, and a year later, Threet, was set to retire as head coach, and Rodriguez was brought in to begin as head coach for the 2008 season. Mallett believed Rodriguez's offense to be unsuitable for a pocket passer, and therefore transferred to Arkansas.[11] That made Michigan's quarterback job was up for grabs. Threet would battle to become the team's starting quarterback along with former walk-on redshirt sophomore, Nick Sheridan, and redshirt sophomore, David Cone. First-year Michigan head coach, Rich Rodriguez, tabbed Sheridan the Michigan starting quarterback to begin the 2008 season. Threet, although, saw action in Michigan's season opener against Utah, entering the game as a substitute and closing the 25\u201310 deficit before eventually losing, 25\u201323. He recorded 132 yards on 14-32 passing along with one touchdown and zero interceptions.[12] Threet was slated for his first career start at Michigan in the following game against Miami (Ohio), although Sheridan would also see playing time. On the first offensive play for Michigan, Threet completed a screen pass to Martavious Odoms that was good for 50 yards. On the fifth play, Threet faked a handoff to Sam McGuffie and ran nine yards for a touchdown.[13] Threet finished with six completions on 13 attempts for 63 yards and no touchdowns, although Michigan evened its season record at 1-1. Threet also started in a 35\u201317 loss against Notre Dame in the third week of the season.[14] According to The Michigan Daily, \"Threet's breakout start\" came on the road against Notre Dame when he went 16-of-23 for 175 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions.[15] In its game coverage, the paper reported, \"Redshirt freshman quarterback Steven Threet played with poise, leading the Wolverines to 330 total yards.\"[16]\n\nAfter a bye week before the team's fourth game, Threet was named the starter again and would lead Michigan to their second biggest comeback in school history and the team's biggest win of the season. Michigan trailed #9 Wisconsin 19\u20130 with three minutes left in the third quarter and then scored 27 unanswered points in 13 minutes to take a 27\u201319 lead.[17] After a poor performance in the first half, Threet led the team to 247 yards of total offense and 27 points in the second half. In the third quarter, he led the Wolverines on an 80-yard, 14-play drive ending with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Kevin Koger. Not known for his mobility, Threet's most impressive play was a 58-yard run in the fourth quarter that set up Michigan's game-winning touchdown. After the game, Rodriguez said Threet's run \"surprised a lot of people, maybe even himself.\"[18] Quarterback coach Rod Smith said of Threet's second-half performance, \"He's a competitor. He's got some heart. He'll fight you, which is what I want. That's a start, you know what I mean? We'll keep working on the rest.\"[18]\n\nIn the sixth game of the season, Threet started against Toledo, but he was injured and sat out the second half of the game, which Michigan lost 13\u201310.\n\nStarting in a 35\u201321 loss Michigan State, Threet completed 13 of 27 passes for 168 yards and a touchdown pass to go along with a career-high three interceptions.\n\nIn a start against Purdue later in the season, Threet threw two touchdown passes for the second time, including a 51-yard touchdown pass to Darryl Stonum. Michigan scored a season-high 42 points against Purdue, but the defense gave up 48 points in the game.\n\nThreet missed two of the last three games of the season due to a shoulder injury. He did not make the trip to play against Ohio State.[15] However, by the end of the season, The Michigan Daily wrote that \"Threet has stepped up as a capable signal-caller ... And now, fans can take a measure of relief \u2014 Michigan has a quarterback.\"[3]\n\nOne of the low points of the 2008 season for Threet came after the loss to Michigan State when Michigan's offensive coordinator Calvin Magee publicly criticized Threet's performance as \"inconsistent, like it always is.\"[2] Asked later about Magee's comments, Threet said:\n\n\"I guess I feel like that's a difference of philosophy from the previous staff. Granted, coaches do different things to get the most out of their players. Some people close to me were upset that a coach would call me out in front of the media, but you know, in the end it didn't really matter to me. And to be honest, my play in the Michigan State game was inconsistent. Is it right to say that at the press conference after the game? I mean, we had just lost a big rivalry game, so I would chalk most of that up to emotions after a big game like that.\"[19]\n\nThe Michigan Daily's sports editor, Dan Feldman, later questioned the wisdom of Magee's public criticism of the team's starting quarterback.[2] Feldman opined that Threet had been impressive and concluded, \"Whatever happens from here, credit Threet for handling a difficult season with class.\"[2]\n\nThreet would start a total of eight games, four more than Sheridan's season total. The team recorded its worst season ever after posting a 3\u20139 record and stopping the country's longest streak of consecutive bowl appearances at 33. He ended the season with 102 completions on 200 attempts for 1,105 yards and nine touchdowns.[4] He also threw seven interceptions.[20] In the off season, Rodriguez would sign quarterbacks Tate Forcier and Denard Robinson on National Signing Day. In February 2009, Threet released a statement saying, \"I have decided to transfer from the University of Michigan. I have requested and received my release. I do not yet know where I will continue my collegiate career, and have no further comment until that decision is made.\"[15]\n\nAs a 6-foot, 6-inch traditional pocket passer, Threet had not fit into the Michigan offensive scheme under first-year head coach Rodriguez, whose spread offense emphasizes mobile quarterbacks. On announcing his transfer to Arizona State, Threet said:\n\n\"I like the pro-style offense and the coaching staff at Arizona State. My career has been filled with ups and downs and coaching changes aren't easy. I was at Georgia Tech for two weeks when they changed coaches. Michigan had the same coaches for like 30 years and then they change. When Coach [Lloyd] Carr retired I wanted to transfer, but I took Coach [Rich] Rodriguez at his word about the offense. I tried to stick it out. I tried to help Michigan win. But in the end the offense didn't fit me. They have a run first offense at every position. What they want is Pat White and that's not me.\"[20]\n\nArizona State University\n\nTransfer to ASU\n\nIn April 2009 Threet announced his decision to transfer to Arizona State University.[20][21][22] Interviewed by The Michigan Daily, Threet explained his choice of Arizona State over Oregon State: \"The first thing I looked at for any school I was going to go to was the offense they run and the coaching staff. Arizona State, I feel it fits me offensively with the type of offense they run, it's a pro-style offense. I get along very well with the coaching staff, I feel like they will be able to help me get better every day in practice and throughout the season and help me develop.\"[19]\n\nUnder transfer rules Threet was required to sit out the 2009 season, but had two years of eligibility remaining.[20]\n\nIn March 2010 Threet started for the first unit in Arizona State's spring game, though head coach, Dennis Erickson, said that that was only because Threet won a coin flip. At the time, Threet said, \"I'm very excited, but I'm just a competitive person. Anytime I go out to practice, I'm trying to compete with whoever I'm playing against whether its last year on the scout team or this year trying to win the starting job.\"[23]\n\nThroughout August 2010 Threet was in close competition with Brock Osweiler for the starting quarterback position.[24] In an interview with The Arizona Republic, head coach Dennis Erickson also praised Threet's progression: \"Every quarterback I've been around it just takes awhile to get used to what you're hanging your hat on and what we're doing offensively. He's got a quick release, and he has a hell of an arm. He just needs to continue to get more accurate.\"\n\nOn August 30, 2010, Erickson announced that Threet would be the starting quarterback in the Sun Devils opening game against Portland State. In a short statement, Erickson said that Threet \"was the most consistent throughout fall camp.\"[25]\n\n2010 season\n\nIn the season opener for Arizona State, Threet led the team to a 54\u20139 win over Portland State. Threet completed 14 of 21 passes for 239 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran with the ball three times for 24 yards and garnered a passer rating of 184.17. His 239 passing yards were the most ever in a debut performance by an Arizona State quarterback.[26]\n\nIn the second game of the 2010 season, Threet led the team to a 41\u201320 win over Northern Arizona. Threet set career highs with 33 completions and 391 passing yards in the game. He also threw three touchdown passes and two interceptions and completed passes to eight different receivers.[27]\n\nThrough the first two games of the 2010 season, Threet completed 47 of 70 passes for a 67% completion rate and five touchdowns.\n\nThe next few games had their ups and downs for Threet, a very close 20\u201319 loss at Camp Randall Stadium in Madison, started a downward spiral for the Sun Devils in 2010. In this game Threet went 21 of 33 for 211 yards with 0 TD and 0 INT. Many believed that the Sun Devils outplayed Wisconsin, Threet played well in the game but it started a trend of what-ifs for the Sun Devils season.\n\nThreet finished the 2010 season with 2,553 passing yards, 18 touchdowns and 16 interceptions.\n\nOn February 23, 2011, Threet announced his retirement from football due to repeated concussions.[28] After finishing his playing career he became a Student Assistant on the Arizona State football team's staff.[29]\n\nReferences"}, {"url": "https://www.mlive.com/wolverines/football/2008/09/university_of_michigans_steven.html", "page_content": "After giving his quarterback duo substantial playing time in the season's first game, it looks like University of Michigan football coach Rich Rodriguez will try that tactic again in Week 2.\n\nOnly this time, it could be redshirt freshman Steven Threet getting the start, and redshirt sophomore Nick Sheridan coming off the bench.\n\nBoth quarterbacks attempted 19 passes in the loss to Utah, and although Threet completed a lower percentage (42.1 to 57.9) of his throws, he didn't commit a turnover (Sheridan had a hand in two) and had a slight advantage in performance.\"Steve probably came out of that game grading a little bit higher,\" Rodriguez said. \"Took the edge a little bit there.\n\n\"We'll see how they execute this week in practice.\"\n\nThe coach said he's pleased that both quarterbacks can recognize their mistakes instantly, but added that the next step is not repeating them. Threet and Sheridan will get an opportunity to show improvement in Saturday's home game against Miami of Ohio, which dropped its season opener to Vanderbilt.\n\n\"In this offense, the quarterback makes a lot of decisions, not just in the passing game, so there were some negatives and things they need to work on,\" Rodriguez said.\n\n\"The disappointing part is the things we thought we had corrected in practice, that again they reverted back to in the game.\n\n\"You should expect that at some point that if we're coaching 'em the right way, they become creatures of habit and the good habits override the bad habits.\"\n\nNew QB commitment, and more recruitment\n\nIf neither Threet nor Sheridan turns out to be the long-term answer at quarterback for the Wolverines, the team will have two new QBs to put to the test in 2009: Shavodrick Beaver, who committed to the Wolverines in April, and now, Tate Forcier. A younger brother of former Michigan quarterback Jason Forcier, Tate gave a verbal commitment Sunday after spending the weekend in Ann Arbor, according to TheWolverine.com.

But the thing is, there is no clear vision of who will get the starting job after a very close, below-par, competition during the spring game in April.\n\nThe 2009 season did more than just upset fans. Head coach Dennis Erickson had named Danny Sullivan as starting quarterback, feeding the public with high expectations for the senior player. Let's just say that these expectations were far from being met.\n\nSullivan was not all to blame for the Sun Devils' offensive struggles, as the o-line was torn apart due to injuries. Add to the fact that his backups were a true freshman and an injury prone sophomore, Erickson was left with no great options for the starting quarterback position. The Sun Devils just did not have the star QB they wanted, and needed.\n\nNeedless to say, a high emphasis has been placed on the quarterback duel at Arizona State heading into the regular season. The offense, under the direction of newly appointed offensive coordinator Noel Mazzone, is likely to bring a more fast-paced style to the field in order to bring more success to whomever lands the starting gig.\n\nDennis Erickson decided that the decision for starting quarterback will have to wait until fall camp, as the two candidates are too close in competition to decide solely on their spring performances.\n\nSun Devil fans will be waiting anxiously to hear who will be leading the 2010 offense in hopes of bringing a winning season to Tempe, and their first bowl berth since 2007.\n\nLet's take a look at the top two candidates for the starting quarterback position.\n\nSteven Threet\n\nThreet transferred from Michigan following the 2008 season to Arizona State, sitting out the 2009 season per NCAA rules. ASU is Threet's third school, playing for Georgia Tech in 2007.\n\nHe undoubtedly has the most experience, playing in 11 games and starting eight of them for Michigan. After capping off the 2008 season with 1,105 yards for nine touchdowns and seven interceptions, he lead the Wolverines in total offense.\n\nThe 6'5\", 237-pound quarterback looked extremely consistent in spring scrimmages, although a lackluster performance shadowed everything else.\n\nThe fact is, Steven Threet came to ASU for one reason: to be the starting quarterback.\n\nIf the past has shown anything, it is that Dennis Erickson favors experience, and Threet has that. Having starting experience in some of most hostile stadiums in the Big-Ten will likely give Threet the extra push for the position.\n\nBrock Osweiler\n\nThe chant \"We want Brock\" could be heard echoing off the stadium walls during the 2009 season. The highly touted six-foot-eight quarterback from Montana has gained a lot of attention in Tempe.\n\nOsweiler, who played six games as a true freshman backup in 2009, made one career start at Oregon. Being thrown into the starting position in one of the most hostile stadiums in the country, he only completed five of ten passes with one interception and sack before sustaining an injury that sidelined him.\n\nHis time to shine came during a game against the visiting USC Trojans last November. After replacing Danny Sullivan halfway through the game, Osweiler brought an intensity to the field that had not been seen, bringing the Sun Devils back into contention. Completing 11 of 27 passes for 153 yards and the only ASU touchdown in the game, he showed great promise for the future of the program.\n\nBrock's size gives him a slight edge, showing that he can rush and break tackles in last year's USC game.\n\nOverall, Osweiler threw for 249 yards and two touchdowns under very limited playing time."}, {"url": "https://m.espn.com/ncf/story?storyId=6152158", "page_content": "Steven Threet, Arizona State's starting quarterback for most of the 2010 season, says he will not play football anymore.\n\nThreet, who will be a senior in 2011, has suffered four concussions, two of which occurred last season.

Brad Ohrman, who was one of Threet\u2019s main targets at Adrian, is a redshirt freshman defensive end at Eastern Michigan. This year\u2019s Adrian football team has five players who could potentially land Division I scholarships, including one of the state\u2019s top-rated defensive ends \u2014 Dylan Farrington.\n\nWhile the number of Division I prospects is growing, Threet has the most unique opportunity of the group. The 6-foot-5, 228-pound redshirt freshman could be the starting quarterback for the winningest program in college football history.\n\n\u201cThis is huge,\u201d Adrian High School football coach Phil Jacobs said. \u201cWhen you think about Michigan and the starting quarterbacks it has had over the last 25 years, they\u2019ve produced some great quarterbacks.\n\n\u201cHeck, look at Tom Brady. He is one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL. I\u2019m not saying Steve is going to be the next Tom Brady, but to be the starting quarterback at Michigan is one of the most prestigious positions. The community as a whole is excited about it.\u201d\n\nThreet is battling sophomore Nick Sheridan, sophomore David Cone and true freshman Justin Feagin for the job of running first-year Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez\u2019s spread-option offense. Rodriguez, who coached at West Virginia last season, implemented the offense after replacing Lloyd Carr as Michigan\u2019s coach. Carr retired after the conclusion of last season.\n\nSheridan graduated from Saline and is the son of New York Giants assistant coach Bill Sheridan, while Feagin is considered the best dual-threat quarterback of the group.\n\n\u201cWe (quarterbacks) try to help each other with whatever we can,\u201d Threet said. \u201cWe\u2019re all new to the system and are trying to help Michigan win anyway we can.\u201d\n\nTypically Rodriguez has had dual-threat quarterbacks like Pat White running his spread-option offense. White threw for 1,724 yards and 14 touchdowns and rushed for 1,335 yards and 14 touchdowns while running the offense at West Virginia last year. While Threet isn\u2019t as mobile as White, Jacobs believes he is capable of running the option and excelling in Rodriguez\u2019s offense.\n\n\u201cHe is more elusive than people give him credit for,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cHe is not a slow kid by any means. In high school I believe he was a 4.7 40 (yard dash) kid.\u201d\n\nThreet, who is considered to have the strongest arm out of the competitors for the starting job, said the 15 spring practices were beneficial to understanding the new offense. It also helped that he ran a version of the spread while at Adrian. The version he ran as a senior had little option, but enough to keep opponents honest, Jacobs said.\n\n\u201cI was familiar with the system when we first started,\u201d said Threet, who threw for 4,824 yards and 49 touchdowns in three years as Adrian\u2019s starting quarterback. \u201cIt was more of a help at the beginning of the spring. It was definitely beneficial.\u201d\n\nMichigan, which went 9-4 last season and is ranked No. 24 in the preseason USA Today Coaches poll, kicked off practices for the upcoming season on Monday and things have been going well for Threet. While Rodriguez has acknowledged the battle for a starting quarterback could extend into the season, Threet is focused on improving and putting himself in the best position possible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a process and I\u2019m just trying to go out and correct the mistakes I made the day before,\u201d Threet said.\n\nHe also knows if he\u2019s not chosen the starter, any of the other candidates are capable of leading Michigan to another winning season."}, {"url": "http://www.infogalactic.com/info/Steven_Threet", "page_content": "From Infogalactic: the planetary knowledge core\n\nSteven Charles Threet (born January 2, 1989) is a former American football quarterback who played for both Michigan and Arizona State. After finishing his playing career he became a Student Assistant on the Arizona State football team's staff.[1] He was the starting quarterback for the Arizona State Sun Devils. During the 2010 season Threet completed 208 of 336 passes for 2,553 yards, 18 touchdowns and 16 interceptions. He passed for a career-high 391 yards and three touchdowns against Northern Arizona in September 2010.\n\nHe threw for 4,824 yards and 49 touchdowns as a high school player in Adrian, Michigan, and was ranked by Rivals.com as the No. 9 quarterback prospect in the nation in the Class of 2006. Threet committed to Georgia Tech and enrolled early there in January 2007.\n\nAfter the coaches who had recruited him left the program, Threet announced in July 2007 that he was transferring to the University of Michigan under head coach Lloyd Carr. Carr was replaced before the 2008 season by Rich Rodriguez. After sitting out the 2007 season under NCAA transfer rules, the redshirt freshman Threet would go on to start at quarterback in eight of Michigan's 12 games.\n\nLater that same year, Threet transferred to Arizona State University, citing the incompatibility of his playing style as a traditional pro style dropback passer with the spread offense of Rodriguez. After sitting out the 2009 season, Threet had two years of eligibility remaining with Arizona State. On August 30, 2010, Arizona State head coach, Dennis Erickson, announced that Threet would be the starting quarterback for the coming season.\n\nEarly years\n\nThreet was born in Adrian, Michigan, and graduated from Adrian High School. During his senior year in high school, he accumulated 1,896 passing yards and threw 20 touchdown passes. He also had had 1,528 passing yards and 19 touchdowns as a junior. In all, he threw for 4,824 yards and 49 touchdowns in three seasons at Adrian High School.[2]\n\nAs a high school senior, Threet was four-star prospect and the No. 9 quarterback prospect nationally according to Rivals.com.[3] He was also named to The Detroit News Division II All-State first team. In August 2006, Detroit Free Press sports writer Chris Silva wrote that Threet \"has the brains of a Steven Q. Urkel and an arm of a young Peyton Manning. He can audible at the line of scrimmage, like NFL star Peyton Manning, and absorb a playbook faster than Urkel could memorize physics formulas. Threet had Ivy League schools such as Harvard and Princeton clamoring over his smarts and skills.\"[2]\n\nThreet had offers from several major schools, including Wisconsin, Stanford, Illinois, North Carolina State, Indiana, Cincinnati and Georgia Tech.[2][4]\n\nGeorgia Tech\n\nThreet committed to Georgia Tech in July 2006 and enrolled early in January 2007.[5][6] His high school coach recalled, \"He fell in love with the recruiters and the position coaches at Georgia Tech.\"[4] Soon after Threet arrived at Georgia Tech, both of the coaches who had recruited him took jobs elsewhere.[4] During spring practice in April 2007, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that \"Threet appeared to take the lead over Calvin Booker for the No. 2 quarterback spot,\" completing 7 of 11 passes for 51 yards and a touchdown while working with the No. 1 offense.[7]\n\nUniversity of Michigan\n\nIn July 2007 Threet announced he would transfer to the University of Michigan.[8][9] While Lloyd Carr was still head coach at Michigan, he had also recruited five-star quarterback Ryan Mallett. Threet called his former high school coach and left a message saying, \"Coach, I'm going to go back to Michigan, and I'm going to beat [Ryan] Mallett out for that starting job.\"[4] In a July 2007 interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Threet explained his decision: \"The biggest thing is that the two coaches that recruited me took jobs at other schools, and that happened after I got there. People have been asking if it was homesickness, or classes were too hard, or if it was all the competition at Tech. It was not any of those at all. I had a 3.76 grade-point my first semester, and the competition (at Michigan) is as good or better.\"[2][10][11]\n\nThreet had been ineligible after his transfer from Georgia Tech. During the 2007 season, the majority of the snaps were taken by senior Chad Henne. However, Henne was sidelined by injury enough that Mallett received a considerable amount of playing time, appearing in 11 games (to Henne's 10) and attempting 141 passes (to Henne's 278). Carr, who had recruited both Mallett, and a year later, Threet, was set to retire as head coach, and Rodriguez was brought in to begin as head coach for the 2008 season. Mallett believed Rodriguez's offense to be unsuitable for a pocket passer, and therefore transferred to Arkansas.[12] That made Michigan's quarterback job was up for grabs. Threet would battle to become the team's starting quarterback along with former walk-on redshirt sophomore, Nick Sheridan, and redshirt sophomore, David Cone. First-year Michigan head coach, Rich Rodriguez, tabbed Sheridan the Michigan starting quarterback to begin the 2008 season. Threet, although, saw action in Michigan's season opener against Utah, entering the game as a substitute and closing the 25-10 deficit before eventually losing, 25-23. He recorded 132 yards on 14-32 passing along with one touchdown and zero interceptions.[13] Threet was slated for his first career start at Michigan in the following game against Miami (Ohio), although Sheridan would also see playing time. On the first offensive play for Michigan, Threet completed a screen pass to Martavious Odoms that was good for 50 yards. On the fifth play, Threet faked a handoff to Sam McGuffie and ran nine yards for a touchdown.[14] Threet finished with six completions on 13 attempts for 63 yards and no touchdowns, although Michigan evened its season record at 1-1. Threet also started in a 35\u201317 loss against Notre Dame in the third week of the season.[15] According to The Michigan Daily, \"Threet's breakout start\" came on the road against Notre Dame when he went 16-of-23 for 175 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions.[16] In its game coverage, the paper reported, \"Redshirt freshman quarterback Steven Threet played with poise, leading the Wolverines to 330 total yards.\"[17]\n\nAfter a bye week before the team's fourth game, Threet was named the starter again and would lead Michigan to their second biggest comeback in school history and the team's biggest win of the season. Michigan trailed #9 Wisconsin 19\u20130 with three minutes left in the third quarter and then scored 27 unanswered points in 13 minutes to take a 27\u201319 lead.[18] After a poor performance in the first half, Threet led the team to 247 yards of total offense and 27 points in the second half. In the third quarter, he led the Wolverines on an 80-yard, 14-play drive ending with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Kevin Koger. Not known for his mobility, Threet's most impressive play was a 58-yard run in the fourth quarter that set up Michigan's game-winning touchdown. After the game, Rodriguez said Threet's run \"surprised a lot of people, maybe even himself.\"[19] Quarterback coach Rod Smith said of Threet's second-half performance, \"He's a competitor. He's got some heart. He'll fight you, which is what I want. That's a start, you know what I mean? We'll keep working on the rest.\"[19]\n\nIn the sixth game of the season, Threet started against Toledo, but he was injured and sat out the second half of the game, which Michigan lost 13\u201310.\n\nStarting in a 35\u201321 loss Michigan State, Threet completed 13 of 27 passes for 168 yards and a touchdown pass to go along with a career-high three interceptions.\n\nIn a start against Purdue later in the season, Threet threw two touchdown passes for the second time, including a 51-yard touchdown pass to Darryl Stonum. Michigan scored a season-high 42 points against Purdue, but the defense gave up 48 points in the game.\n\nThreet missed two of the last three games of the season due to a shoulder injury. He did not make the trip to play against Ohio State.[16] However, by the end of the season, The Michigan Daily wrote that \"Threet has stepped up as a capable signal-caller ... And now, fans can take a measure of relief \u2014 Michigan has a quarterback.\"[4]\n\nOne of the low points of the 2008 season for Threet came after the loss to Michigan State when Michigan's offensive coordinator Calvin Magee publicly criticized Threet's performance as \"inconsistent, like it always is.\"[3] Asked later about Magee's comments, Threet said:\n\n\"I guess I feel like that's a difference of philosophy from the previous staff. Granted, coaches do different things to get the most out of their players. Some people close to me were upset that a coach would call me out in front of the media, but you know, in the end it didn't really matter to me. And to be honest, my play in the Michigan State game was inconsistent. Is it right to say that at the press conference after the game? I mean, we had just lost a big rivalry game, so I would chalk most of that up to emotions after a big game like that.\"[20]\n\nThe Michigan Daily's sports editor, Dan Feldman, later questioned the wisdom of Magee's public criticism of the team's starting quarterback.[3] Feldman opined that Threet had been impressive and concluded, \"Whatever happens from here, credit Threet for handling a difficult season with class.\"[3]\n\nThreet would start a total of eight games, four more than Sheridan's season total. The team recorded its worst season ever after posting a 3-9 record and stopping the country's longest streak of consecutive bowl appearances at 33. He ended the season with 102 completions on 200 attempts for 1,105 yards and nine touchdowns.[5] He also threw seven interceptions.[21] In the off season, Rodriguez would sign quarterbacks Tate Forcier and Denard Robinson on National Signing Day. In February 2009, Threet released a statement saying, \"I have decided to transfer from the University of Michigan. I have requested and received my release. I do not yet know where I will continue my collegiate career, and have no further comment until that decision is made.\"[16]\n\nAs a 6-foot, 6-inch traditional pocket passer, Threet had not fit into the Michigan offensive scheme under first-year head coach Rodriguez, whose spread offense emphasizes mobile quarterbacks. On announcing his transfer to Arizona State, Threet said:\n\n\"I like the pro-style offense and the coaching staff at Arizona State. My career has been filled with ups and downs and coaching changes aren't easy. I was at Georgia Tech for two weeks when they changed coaches. Michigan had the same coaches for like 30 years and then they change. When Coach [Lloyd] Carr retired I wanted to transfer, but I took Coach [Rich] Rodriguez at his word about the offense. I tried to stick it out. I tried to help Michigan win. But in the end the offense didn't fit me. They have a run first offense at every position. What they want is Pat White and that's not me.\"[21]\n\nArizona State University\n\nTransfer to ASU\n\nIn April 2009 Threet announced his decision to transfer to Arizona State University.[21][22][23] Interviewed by The Michigan Daily, Threet explained his choice of Arizona State over Oregon State: \"The first thing I looked at for any school I was going to go to was the offense they run and the coaching staff. Arizona State, I feel it fits me offensively with the type of offense they run, it's a pro-style offense. I get along very well with the coaching staff, I feel like they will be able to help me get better every day in practice and throughout the season and help me develop.\"[20]\n\nUnder transfer rules Threet was required to sit out the 2009 season, but had two years of eligibility remaining.[21]\n\nIn March 2010 Threet started for the first unit in Arizona State's spring game, though head coach, Dennis Erickson, said that that was only because Threet won a coin flip. At the time, Threet said, \"I'm very excited, but I'm just a competitive person. Anytime I go out to practice, I'm trying to compete with whoever I'm playing against whether its last year on the scout team or this year trying to win the starting job.\"[24]\n\nThroughout August 2010 Threet was in close competition with Brock Osweiler for the starting quarterback position.[25] In an interview with The Arizona Republic, head coach Dennis Erickson also praised Threet's progression: \"Every quarterback I've been around it just takes awhile to get used to what you're hanging your hat on and what we're doing offensively. He's got a quick release, and he has a hell of an arm. He just needs to continue to get more accurate.\"\n\nOn August 30, 2010, Erickson announced that Threet would be the starting quarterback in the Sun Devils opening game against Portland State. In a short statement, Erickson said that Threet \"was the most consistent throughout fall camp.\"[26]\n\n2010 season\n\nIn the season opener for Arizona State, Threet led the team to a 54-9 win over Portland State. Threet completed 14 of 21 passes for 239 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran with the ball three times for 24 yards and garnered a passer rating of 184.17. His 239 passing yards were the most ever in a debut performance by an Arizona State quarterback.[27]\n\nIn the second game of the 2010 season, Threet led the team to a 41-20 win over Northern Arizona. Threet set career highs with 33 completions and 391 passing yards in the game. He also threw three touchdown passes and two interceptions and completed passes to eight different receivers.[28]\n\nThrough the first two games of the 2010 season, Threet completed 47 of 70 passes for a 67% completion rate and five touchdowns.\n\nThe next few games had their ups and downs for Threet, a very close 20-19 loss at Camp Randall Stadium in Madison, started a downward spiral for the Sun Devils in 2010. In this game Threet went 21 of 33 for 211 yards with 0 TD and 0 INT. Many believed that the Sun Devils outplayed Wisconsin, Threet played well in the game but it started a trend of what-ifs for the Sun Devils season.\n\nThreet finished the 2010 season with 2,553 passing yards, 18 touchdowns and 16 interceptions.\n\nOn February 23, 2011, Threet announced his retirement from football due to repeated concussions.[29]\n\nReferences"}], "Steven Threet led the team to a 3\u20139 record in 2007.": [{"url": "https://247sports.com/Article/Ex-Michigan-QB-Steven-Threet-rips-Rich-Rodriguez-for-hiring-Rod-Smith-as-Jacksonville-State-footballs-OC-188710516/", "page_content": "BOULDER, Colo.\u2014 Who's been talked about more in college football than Deion Sanders?\n\nWhether it's getting the nation's top recruit Travis Hunter to flip on signing day to Jackson State, his decision to accept the Colorado job or the massive roster overhaul that has taken place since the spring game (51 scholarship players total, 44 alone after the spring game) Sanders has given sports media plenty to write about while raising eyebrows across college football.\n\n\"We'll see how it works out but that, to me, looks bad on college football coaches across the country,\" Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi told 247Sports' Brandon Marcello in May, a quote that went viral. \"The reflection is on one guy right now but when you look at it overall \u2014 those kids that have moms and dads and brothers and sisters and goals in life \u2014 I don't know how many of those 70 that left really wanted to leave or they were kicked in the butt to get out.\"\n\nSanders believes his true true goal behind his roster makeover has been lost in translation.

But all of them share a desperate want to get where they want to go as quickly as possible.\"\n\n247Sports: What do you say to people like Pat Narduzzi who have been critical of your roster overhaul?\n\nSanders: \"What was his situation when he came to Pitt? He had a different situation than me. He is not mad at me, he is mad at the situation in football now that allowed his best player to leave a year ago. He\u2019s not mad at me, he\u2019s using me to shoot bullets at another coach who he has an issue with. I don\u2019t know who he is; if he walked in here right now I wouldn\u2019t know him.\"\n\n247Sports: There was a lot of smoke surrounding Travis Hunter when he entered the portal: Would he follow you to Colorado or land somewhere else? He obviously enrolled at Colorado. What are your expectations for him this season?\n\nSanders: \"People offered Travis Hunter a bag. About $1.5 million to try to lure him and buy him out of the transfer portal. But Travis is not the kind of guy that can be bought. He isn't built like that. Travis is a relational young man that is built on relationships and stability. And that\u2019s what he wanted and desired. That is why he decided to ride and stay with us. I cannot wait until they see what he is capable of doing in these next couple of years. Because he will be a top-5 or top-3 pick after his junior year. But the sky's the limit, he is going to play both ways and he is a vital part of the offense and the defense, and he wants that.\n\n247Sports: How do you manage him playing both ways?\n\nSanders: \"We don\u2019t have to manage that. His game is his game. It\u2019s nothing that we manage. Travis is bored when he is not on the field, Travis is not intertwined with things when he is not on the field. Travis likes to be in the action, that\u2019s who he is.\"\n\n247Sports: As I watched the workouts this week, one of the things that has stood out to me is the vocal leadership of Shedeur Sanders. You\u2019ve been coaching him from youth, to high school and now college football. How has Shedeur grown as a leader this spring in the transition to Colorado?\n\nSanders: \"It\u2019s funny telling you this because his brother is sitting here filming this, but [Shedeur\u2019s] nickname is \u201cGrown.\u201d Because he has always been truly mature for his age at different stages of his life that he has encountered and different obstacles he has overcome. He is rock-steady. Grown doesn't get flustered. He is not a 'ra-ra' guy. He's not a 'I\u2019m gonna talk about what he\u2019s going to do\u201d [type of person]. It\u2019s not too many things in life that will get him up or get him down. He is like a baseball player. Baseball players are rock-steady. Football players are up because they have to practice for six days and play one. Baseball players have to do it every day. That is his character. And I love the expectation that he has placed on himself. My expectation of him is far less than his expectations he places on himself. Because not only does he have tremendous expectations, but he is a Sanders. And he knows what that means.\"\n\nGet offseason and recruiting information on your favorite college team for $1 for first month\n\n247Sports: A lot of roster changes have been made.\n\nSanders: \"Necessary changes. Say: 'Necessary.'\n\n247Sports: How do you like your team going into the fall as opposed to what you had in the spring?\n\nSanders: \"Apples and Oranges. You can\u2019t compare the two. You are talking about a situation in which we inherited a team that was 1-11. And everyone knows there are going to be some changes. I don\u2019t understand how you would think that the coaching staff is the only thing that deserved a change. Now when you rid yourself of the entire coaching staff, you think you are going to keep all the kids? That doesn\u2019t make sense to me. And that just doesn\u2019t make sense whatsoever when the previous staff was responsible for securing those kids. That\u2019s not the way that this game is played with us.\"\n\n247Sports: From a recruiting standpoint, if a young man wants to play for Colorado, what does he need to have?\n\nSanders: \"First he needs to have his grades correct and needs to be eligible through our compliance department. Then, he needs to be tough, smart, fast, disciplined and with character. And he has to understand that this coaching staff is old school. Not old fools, but old school. A lot of our principles and the way we attack the game comes from way back when. And we are still that way because that way is the way and it has not failed us yet. So it\u2019s a tremendous expectation, but we go hard and we play fast. And you have to love this thing. We don\u2019t want you to be 'in like' with it. We want you to be 'in love' with it.\"\n\nRELATED: 5 things Carl Reed learned from Colorado's spring game"}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/steven-threet", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nSteven Threet was born on 2 January, 1989 in Adrian, Michigan, United States, is an American football quarterback.

After finishing his playing career he became a Student Assistant on the Arizona State football team's staff.[1] He was the starting quarterback for the Arizona State Sun Devils. During the 2010 season Threet completed 208 of 336 passes for 2,553 yards, 18 touchdowns and 16 interceptions. He passed for a career-high 391 yards and three touchdowns against Northern Arizona in September 2010.\n\nHe threw for 4,824 yards and 49 touchdowns as a high school player in Adrian, Michigan, and was ranked by Rivals.com as the No. 9 quarterback prospect in the nation in the Class of 2006. Threet committed to Georgia Tech and enrolled early there in January 2007.\n\nAfter the coaches who had recruited him left the program, Threet announced in July 2007 that he was transferring to the University of Michigan under head coach Lloyd Carr. Carr was replaced before the 2008 season by Rich Rodriguez. After sitting out the 2007 season under NCAA transfer rules, the redshirt freshman Threet would go on to start at quarterback in eight of Michigan's 12 games.\n\nLater that same year, Threet transferred to Arizona State University, citing the incompatibility of his playing style as a traditional pro style dropback passer with the spread offense of Rodriguez. After sitting out the 2009 season, Threet had two years of eligibility remaining with Arizona State. On August 30, 2010, Arizona State head coach, Dennis Erickson, announced that Threet would be the starting quarterback for the coming season.\n\nEarly years\n\nThreet was born in Adrian, Michigan, and graduated from Adrian High School. During his senior year in high school, he accumulated 1,896 passing yards and threw 20 touchdown passes. He also had had 1,528 passing yards and 19 touchdowns as a junior. In all, he threw for 4,824 yards and 49 touchdowns in three seasons at Adrian High School.[2]\n\nAs a high school senior, Threet was four-star prospect and the No. 9 quarterback prospect nationally according to Rivals.com.[3] He was also named to The Detroit News Division II All-State first team. In August 2006, Detroit Free Press sports writer Chris Silva wrote that Threet \"has the brains of a Steven Q. Urkel and an arm of a young Peyton Manning. He can audible at the line of scrimmage, like NFL star Peyton Manning, and absorb a playbook faster than Urkel could memorize physics formulas. Threet had Ivy League schools such as Harvard and Princeton clamoring over his smarts and skills.\"[2]\n\nThreet had offers from several major schools, including Wisconsin, Stanford, Illinois, North Carolina State, Indiana, Cincinnati and Georgia Tech.[2][4]\n\nGeorgia Tech\n\nThreet committed to Georgia Tech in July 2006 and enrolled early in January 2007.[5][6] His high school coach recalled, \"He fell in love with the recruiters and the position coaches at Georgia Tech.\"[4] Soon after Threet arrived at Georgia Tech, both of the coaches who had recruited him took jobs elsewhere.[4] During spring practice in April 2007, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that \"Threet appeared to take the lead over Calvin Booker for the No. 2 quarterback spot,\" completing 7 of 11 passes for 51 yards and a touchdown while working with the No. 1 offense.[7]\n\nUniversity of Michigan\n\nIn July 2007 Threet announced he would transfer to the University of Michigan.[8][9] While Lloyd Carr was still head coach at Michigan, he had also recruited five-star quarterback Ryan Mallett. Threet called his former high school coach and left a message saying, \"Coach, I'm going to go back to Michigan, and I'm going to beat [Ryan] Mallett out for that starting job.\"[4] In a July 2007 interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Threet explained his decision: \"The biggest thing is that the two coaches that recruited me took jobs at other schools, and that happened after I got there. People have been asking if it was homesickness, or classes were too hard, or if it was all the competition at Tech. It was not any of those at all. I had a 3.76 grade-point my first semester, and the competition (at Michigan) is as good or better.\"[2][10][11]\n\nThreet had been ineligible after his transfer from Georgia Tech. During the 2007 season, the majority of the snaps were taken by senior Chad Henne. However, Henne was sidelined by injury enough that Mallett received a considerable amount of playing time, appearing in 11 games (to Henne's 10) and attempting 141 passes (to Henne's 278). Carr, who had recruited both Mallett, and a year later, Threet, was set to retire as head coach, and Rodriguez was brought in to begin as head coach for the 2008 season. Mallett believed Rodriguez's offense to be unsuitable for a pocket passer, and therefore transferred to Arkansas.[12] That made Michigan's quarterback job was up for grabs. Threet would battle to become the team's starting quarterback along with former walk-on redshirt sophomore, Nick Sheridan, and redshirt sophomore, David Cone. First-year Michigan head coach, Rich Rodriguez, tabbed Sheridan the Michigan starting quarterback to begin the 2008 season. Threet, although, saw action in Michigan's season opener against Utah, entering the game as a substitute and closing the 25-10 deficit before eventually losing, 25-23. He recorded 132 yards on 14-32 passing along with one touchdown and zero interceptions.[13] Threet was slated for his first career start at Michigan in the following game against Miami (Ohio), although Sheridan would also see playing time. On the first offensive play for Michigan, Threet completed a screen pass to Martavious Odoms that was good for 50 yards. On the fifth play, Threet faked a handoff to Sam McGuffie and ran nine yards for a touchdown.[14] Threet finished with six completions on 13 attempts for 63 yards and no touchdowns, although Michigan evened its season record at 1-1. Threet also started in a 35\u201317 loss against Notre Dame in the third week of the season.[15] According to The Michigan Daily, \"Threet's breakout start\" came on the road against Notre Dame when he went 16-of-23 for 175 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions.[16] In its game coverage, the paper reported, \"Redshirt freshman quarterback Steven Threet played with poise, leading the Wolverines to 330 total yards.\"[17]\n\nAfter a bye week before the team's fourth game, Threet was named the starter again and would lead Michigan to their second biggest comeback in school history and the team's biggest win of the season. Michigan trailed #9 Wisconsin 19\u20130 with three minutes left in the third quarter and then scored 27 unanswered points in 13 minutes to take a 27\u201319 lead.[18] After a poor performance in the first half, Threet led the team to 247 yards of total offense and 27 points in the second half. In the third quarter, he led the Wolverines on an 80-yard, 14-play drive ending with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Kevin Koger. Not known for his mobility, Threet's most impressive play was a 58-yard run in the fourth quarter that set up Michigan's game-winning touchdown. After the game, Rodriguez said Threet's run \"surprised a lot of people, maybe even himself.\"[19] Quarterback coach Rod Smith said of Threet's second-half performance, \"He's a competitor. He's got some heart. He'll fight you, which is what I want. That's a start, you know what I mean? We'll keep working on the rest.\"[19]\n\nIn the sixth game of the season, Threet started against Toledo, but he was injured and sat out the second half of the game, which Michigan lost 13\u201310.\n\nStarting in a 35\u201321 loss Michigan State, Threet completed 13 of 27 passes for 168 yards and a touchdown pass to go along with a career-high three interceptions.\n\nIn a start against Purdue later in the season, Threet threw two touchdown passes for the second time, including a 51-yard touchdown pass to Darryl Stonum. Michigan scored a season-high 42 points against Purdue, but the defense gave up 48 points in the game.\n\nThreet missed two of the last three games of the season due to a shoulder injury. He did not make the trip to play against Ohio State.[16] However, by the end of the season, The Michigan Daily wrote that \"Threet has stepped up as a capable signal-caller ... And now, fans can take a measure of relief \u2014 Michigan has a quarterback.\"[4]\n\nOne of the low points of the 2008 season for Threet came after the loss to Michigan State when Michigan's offensive coordinator Calvin Magee publicly criticized Threet's performance as \"inconsistent, like it always is.\"[3] Asked later about Magee's comments, Threet said:\n\n\"I guess I feel like that's a difference of philosophy from the previous staff. Granted, coaches do different things to get the most out of their players. Some people close to me were upset that a coach would call me out in front of the media, but you know, in the end it didn't really matter to me. And to be honest, my play in the Michigan State game was inconsistent. Is it right to say that at the press conference after the game? I mean, we had just lost a big rivalry game, so I would chalk most of that up to emotions after a big game like that.\"[20]\n\nThe Michigan Daily's sports editor, Dan Feldman, later questioned the wisdom of Magee's public criticism of the team's starting quarterback.[3] Feldman opined that Threet had been impressive and concluded, \"Whatever happens from here, credit Threet for handling a difficult season with class.\"[3]\n\nThreet would start a total of eight games, four more than Sheridan's season total. The team recorded its worst season ever after posting a 3-9 record and stopping the country's longest streak of consecutive bowl appearances at 33. He ended the season with 102 completions on 200 attempts for 1,105 yards and nine touchdowns.[5] He also threw seven interceptions.[21] In the off season, Rodriguez would sign quarterbacks Tate Forcier and Denard Robinson on National Signing Day. In February 2009, Threet released a statement saying, \"I have decided to transfer from the University of Michigan. I have requested and received my release. I do not yet know where I will continue my collegiate career, and have no further comment until that decision is made.\"[16]\n\nAs a 6-foot, 6-inch traditional pocket passer, Threet had not fit into the Michigan offensive scheme under first-year head coach Rodriguez, whose spread offense emphasizes mobile quarterbacks. On announcing his transfer to Arizona State, Threet said:\n\n\"I like the pro-style offense and the coaching staff at Arizona State. My career has been filled with ups and downs and coaching changes aren't easy. I was at Georgia Tech for two weeks when they changed coaches. Michigan had the same coaches for like 30 years and then they change. When Coach [Lloyd] Carr retired I wanted to transfer, but I took Coach [Rich] Rodriguez at his word about the offense. I tried to stick it out. I tried to help Michigan win. But in the end the offense didn't fit me. They have a run first offense at every position. What they want is Pat White and that's not me.\"[21]\n\nArizona State University\n\nTransfer to ASU\n\nIn April 2009 Threet announced his decision to transfer to Arizona State University.[21][22][23] Interviewed by The Michigan Daily, Threet explained his choice of Arizona State over Oregon State: \"The first thing I looked at for any school I was going to go to was the offense they run and the coaching staff. Arizona State, I feel it fits me offensively with the type of offense they run, it's a pro-style offense. I get along very well with the coaching staff, I feel like they will be able to help me get better every day in practice and throughout the season and help me develop.\"[20]\n\nUnder transfer rules Threet was required to sit out the 2009 season, but had two years of eligibility remaining.[21]\n\nIn March 2010 Threet started for the first unit in Arizona State's spring game, though head coach, Dennis Erickson, said that that was only because Threet won a coin flip. At the time, Threet said, \"I'm very excited, but I'm just a competitive person. Anytime I go out to practice, I'm trying to compete with whoever I'm playing against whether its last year on the scout team or this year trying to win the starting job.\"[24]\n\nThroughout August 2010 Threet was in close competition with Brock Osweiler for the starting quarterback position.[25] In an interview with The Arizona Republic, head coach Dennis Erickson also praised Threet's progression: \"Every quarterback I've been around it just takes awhile to get used to what you're hanging your hat on and what we're doing offensively. He's got a quick release, and he has a hell of an arm. He just needs to continue to get more accurate.\"\n\nOn August 30, 2010, Erickson announced that Threet would be the starting quarterback in the Sun Devils opening game against Portland State. In a short statement, Erickson said that Threet \"was the most consistent throughout fall camp.\"[26]\n\n2010 season\n\nIn the season opener for Arizona State, Threet led the team to a 54-9 win over Portland State. Threet completed 14 of 21 passes for 239 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran with the ball three times for 24 yards and garnered a passer rating of 184.17. His 239 passing yards were the most ever in a debut performance by an Arizona State quarterback.[27]\n\nIn the second game of the 2010 season, Threet led the team to a 41-20 win over Northern Arizona. Threet set career highs with 33 completions and 391 passing yards in the game. He also threw three touchdown passes and two interceptions and completed passes to eight different receivers.[28]\n\nThrough the first two games of the 2010 season, Threet completed 47 of 70 passes for a 67% completion rate and five touchdowns.\n\nThe next few games had their ups and downs for Threet, a very close 20-19 loss at Camp Randall Stadium in Madison, started a downward spiral for the Sun Devils in 2010. In this game Threet went 21 of 33 for 211 yards with 0 TD and 0 INT. Many believed that the Sun Devils outplayed Wisconsin, Threet played well in the game but it started a trend of what-ifs for the Sun Devils season.\n\nThreet finished the 2010 season with 2,553 passing yards, 18 touchdowns and 16 interceptions.\n\nOn February 23, 2011, Threet announced his retirement from football due to repeated concussions.[29]\n\nReferences"}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/steven-threet/", "page_content": "Steven Charles Threet (born January 2, 1989) is a former American football quarterback who played for both Michigan and Arizona State.

I mean, we had just lost a big rivalry game, so I would chalk most of that up to emotions after a big game like that.\"\n\nThe Michigan Daily's sports editor, Dan Feldman, later questioned the wisdom of Magee's public criticism of the team's starting quarterback. Feldman opined that Threet had been impressive and concluded, \"Whatever happens from here, credit Threet for handling a difficult season with class.\"\n\nThreet would start a total of eight games, four more than Sheridan's season total. The team recorded its worst season ever after posting a 3-9 record and stopping the country's longest streak of consecutive bowl appearances at 33. He ended the season with 102 completions on 200 attempts for 1,105 yards and nine touchdowns. He also threw seven interceptions. In the off season, Rodriguez would sign quarterbacks Tate Forcier and Denard Robinson on National Signing Day. In February 2009, Threet released a statement saying, \"I have decided to transfer from the University of Michigan. I have requested and received my release. I do not yet know where I will continue my collegiate career, and have no further comment until that decision is made.\"\n\nAs a 6-foot, 6-inch traditional pocket passer, Threet had not fit into the Michigan offensive scheme under first-year head coach Rodriguez, whose spread offense emphasizes mobile quarterbacks. On announcing his transfer to Arizona State, Threet said:\n\n\"I like the pro-style offense and the coaching staff at Arizona State. My career has been filled with ups and downs and coaching changes aren't easy. I was at Georgia Tech for two weeks when they changed coaches. Michigan had the same coaches for like 30 years and then they change. When Coach [Lloyd] Carr retired I wanted to transfer, but I took Coach [Rich] Rodriguez at his word about the offense. I tried to stick it out. I tried to help Michigan win. But in the end the offense didn't fit me. They have a run first offense at every position. What they want is Pat White and that's not me.\"\n\nArizona State University\n\nTransfer to ASU\n\nIn April 2009 Threet announced his decision to transfer to Arizona State University. Interviewed by The Michigan Daily, Threet explained his choice of Arizona State over Oregon State: \"The first thing I looked at for any school I was going to go to was the offense they run and the coaching staff. Arizona State, I feel it fits me offensively with the type of offense they run, it's a pro-style offense. I get along very well with the coaching staff, I feel like they will be able to help me get better every day in practice and throughout the season and help me develop.\"\n\nUnder transfer rules Threet was required to sit out the 2009 season, but had two years of eligibility remaining.\n\nIn March 2010 Threet started for the first unit in Arizona State's spring game, though head coach, Dennis Erickson, said that that was only because Threet won a coin flip. At the time, Threet said, \"I'm very excited, but I'm just a competitive person. Anytime I go out to practice, I'm trying to compete with whoever I'm playing against whether its last year on the scout team or this year trying to win the starting job.\"\n\nThroughout August 2010 Threet was in close competition with Brock Osweiler for the starting quarterback position. In an interview with The Arizona Republic, head coach Dennis Erickson also praised Threet's progression: \"Every quarterback I've been around it just takes awhile to get used to what you're hanging your hat on and what we're doing offensively. He's got a quick release, and he has a hell of an arm. He just needs to continue to get more accurate.\"\n\nOn August 30, 2010, Erickson announced that Threet would be the starting quarterback in the Sun Devils opening game against Portland State. In a short statement, Erickson said that Threet \"was the most consistent throughout fall camp.\"\n\n2010 season\n\nIn the season opener for Arizona State, Threet led the team to a 54-9 win over Portland State. Threet completed 14 of 21 passes for 239 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran with the ball three times for 24 yards and garnered a passer rating of 184.17. His 239 passing yards were the most ever in a debut performance by an Arizona State quarterback.\n\nIn the second game of the 2010 season, Threet led the team to a 41-20 win over Northern Arizona. Threet set career highs with 33 completions and 391 passing yards in the game. He also threw three touchdown passes and two interceptions and completed passes to eight different receivers.\n\nThrough the first two games of the 2010 season, Threet completed 47 of 70 passes for a 67% completion rate and five touchdowns.\n\nThe next few games had their ups and downs for Threet, a very close 20-19 loss at Camp Randall Stadium in Madison, started a downward spiral for the Sun Devils in 2010. In this game Threet went 21 of 33 for 211 yards with 0 TD and 0 INT. Many believed that the Sun Devils outplayed Wisconsin, Threet played well in the game but it started a trend of what-ifs for the Sun Devils season.\n\nThreet finished the 2010 season with 2,553 passing yards, 18 touchdowns and 16 interceptions.\n\nOn February 23, 2011, Threet announced his retirement from football due to repeated concussions. After finishing his playing career he became a Student Assistant on the Arizona State football team's staff."}, {"url": "https://www.mlive.com/wolverines/football/2008/10/michigan_quarterback_threet_th.html", "page_content": "University of Michigan quarterback Steven Threet can't stand silence.\n\nWhen he sleeps, two fans whir in the bedroom. When he and roommates Artis Chambers and Vince Helmuth study, \"it's no library environment,\" Helmuth says.Music frequently plays in the background of Threet's life; hip-hop, classic rock, even classical. During his weekday ritual of studying film alone in the Schembechler Hall team room - sometimes until midnight - Threet will sit in front of the big projector screen, remote in hand, wearing headphones.\n\nOn game days, such as today, when Michigan (2-2, 1-0 Big Ten) hosts Illinois (2-2, 0-1), Threet will begin his routine at Michigan Stadium by tossing a ball back and forth with a manager as fans trickle into the venue well before kickoff.\n\nWhile playing catch, Threet may listen to Bob Seger's \"Greatest Hits.\" Or it could be the sounds of a hip-hop artist such as Lil Wayne, T.I. or Jay-Z.\n\nRELATED CONTENT\n\n\u2022 Scouting report: Illinois at Michigan\n\n\u2022 Carty: With loss of civility, everyone loses\n\n\u2022 Q&A: Psych major Dutch has NFL dreams\n\n\u2022 Illinois quarterback Williams a proven playmaker\n\n\u2022 Huron High School receiver Jackson stays home, will play for Michigan\n\n\u2022 Lunch with Heuser: Limiting turnovers critical for U-M against Illinois\n\n\u2022 More Wolverines Football Coverage\n\nWhen the stadium's filled and fans are cheering, Threet \"definitely thrives off it,\" says Helmuth, a Michigan fullback.\n\nIt wasn't cheers, however, the Wolverines heard when they jogged off the field at halftime last Saturday against Wisconsin. Michigan trailed 19-0 and the team's offense had generated 21 total yards.\n\nAs for Threet, \"he had about the worst half I've ever seen a quarterback have,\" Michigan quarterbacks coach Rod Smith says bluntly. Threet completed 2 of 10 passes for minus-7 yards. He had also thrown two interceptions, lost a fumble, but remained unfazed by it all.\n\n\"He wasn't doing well in the first half, obviously,\" offensive tackle Stephen Schilling says. \"But he didn't get down on himself, and none of his teammates got down on him. We stuck with him, kept blocking for him. We knew eventually he'd make the right throws and the right reads and we'd turn it around.\"\n\nWhen Threet and the Wolverines were finished, they had reversed things completely, scoring 27 consecutive points and holding off the then-No. 9-ranked Badgers, 27-25. It was the largest comeback in the 500-game history of Michigan Stadium, and it was directed by a redshirt freshman quarterback who said he never doubted himself.\n\n\"He still fought and scratched and made some plays for us and led us to a victory,\" Smith says.\n\nAdds Gary Gray, a family friend and coach from Adrian, the town where Threet was raised: \"I was more proud of him in the first half than in the second. When things aren't going well, that's when you see what Bubba's really all about.\"\n\nWhiz at memorization\n\nTo family and childhood friends, Threet is better known as Stevie, or more often, Bubba. That nickname started out as Chubba Bubba, Threet says.\n\n\"I was a hefty boy,\" he says, laughing. \"I was a large child. When I slimmed down a little bit it was just Bubba.\"\n\nWhatever he was called, Threet was born into a sporting family on Jan. 2, 1989, the day Michigan beat Southern California in the Rose Bowl.\n\nHis father Jewel played baseball at Adrian College, and coached the Lookouts youth travel baseball team in Lenawee County. Threet's older brother Jay played college baseball, first at Purdue, then at Bowling Green. Sister Krissy was a softball pitcher at Eastern Michigan University.\n\nSteven Threet pitched as well, and played basketball and soccer as an elementary student. Threet always told his parents that football was his favorite sport, however, but he didn't have an opportunity to play until he switched to the Adrian public schools.\n\nIn eighth grade, Threet's middle school football coach asked each boy to list two positions they wanted to play. Jewel Threet joked with his son that they'd make him a lineman. Steven Threet wrote down tight end and quarterback.\n\nThreet tried out for the quarterback job, won it, and soon impressed his coach with his ability to learn the offense.\n\n\"I remember the coach telling me that he was able to know his assignment, everybody else's assignment,\" Jewel Threet says. \"He knew every play, every position. And this was in the eighth grade, and I go, 'That's not surprising.' \"\n\nSteven Threet was a whiz at memorization, easily retaining scriptures he learned at Lenawee Christian School, helping with driving directions years before he turned 16 and excelling in academics. What Threet needed was a better grasp of how to play the quarterback position.\n\n\"I had never played football,\" Jewel Threet says. \"So when Stevie wanted to get serious about it, I had to find someone who could teach him.\"\n\nJewel Threet had ferried Jay to the Detroit area and Krissy to Ann Arbor for pitching lessons. For his youngest son's quarterbacking tutorials, he turned to Ken Calhoun, then the offensive coordinator at Adrian College. He also enlisted Mike Howe, a local conditioning coach, and Gray, a physical therapist by trade who has treated professional athletes such as Mario Lemieux and Dan Marino.\n\nThreet worked on his quickness, agility, change of direction, acceleration, deceleration, the proper way to throw from an off-balance position and more. He trained throughout high school, sometimes working out two or three times a day in the summer.\n\n\"I've never seen a kid work so hard,\" Gray says. \"A lot of times, kids are willing to work on their strengths. But he was willing to work to turn his weaknesses into strengths.\"\n\nLong road to starter\n\nThreet's mom, Pam, had graduated from the University of Michigan, and the family began buying football season tickets in the early 1980s. Pam and Jewel joined the Victors Club, and Jewel traveled to the 1992 and '93 Final Fours to watch the Michigan men's basketball team.\n\nWhen Jay was being recruited by Big Ten baseball programs, he tried to schedule his official visits for fall weekends when the Michigan football team was in town. During Jay's visit to Purdue, Stevie tagged along, wearing his Drew Henson No. 7 jersey.\n\nWhen Jay went to Northwestern, Stevie watched the Wildcats win a wild 54-51 game in 2001.\n\n\"We would be sitting there in their recruiting section, and I would have my Michigan jersey on, cheering for Michigan while my brother was looking at the other school,\" Threet says.\n\nHis Henson jersey and the one with former Michigan tailback Anthony Thomas' No. 32, were tucked away at home when Threet - who grew to be 6-feet, 6-inches tall - began his college career, not in Ann Arbor, but at Georgia Tech. Though Michigan expressed some interest in Threet, the school never offered a scholarship, and signed one of the nation's best high school quarterbacks - Ryan Mallett - to succeed four-year starter Chad Henne.\n\nThreet graduated from high school early as class valedictorian, and enrolled at Georgia Tech in January, 2007. But offensive coordinator Patrick Nix - who had recruited Threet - left almost immediately for Miami. By summer, Threet, too, had decided to leave Atlanta.\n\nOne of those he spoke to about where to go next was Helmuth, a Saline High graduate who had known Threet since middle school.\n\n\"I said: 'Come over here,' \" says Helmuth, who had started classes at Michigan in January 2007, along with Chambers, a safety, and Mallett.\n\nBecause another Michigan quarterback, Jason Forcier, had transferred to Stanford, there was a scholarship available for Threet. He sat out the season per NCAA transfer rules, then saw coach Lloyd Carr retire following Michigan's bowl game.\n\nShortly after Rich Rodriguez took over the program, Mallett - who backed up Henne in 2007 - transferred to Arkansas. When Terrelle Pryor, the nation's No. 1 prep quarterback, picked Ohio State over Michigan earlier this year, Threet and redshirt sophomore Nick Sheridan became the top contenders for the starting job.\n\n\"My goal transferring here was, obviously, to compete for the starting position,\" Threet says. \"I didn't come to sit and watch, that's not the type of person I am. I love to compete.\"\n\nAn instant leader\n\nThreet ultimately won the competition with Sheridan in the season's third game, when he completed 16 of 23 passes for 175 yards at Notre Dame. Threet followed that performance with the outing against Wisconsin, in which he had a 58-yard run, but finished 12 of 31 passing for 96 yards.\n\nMechanically, he still needs some polish, as Threet and his quarterbacks coach readily acknowledge. Threet sometimes plants his feet too wide when he throws the ball, and he tends to lower his release point too much, which can be traced to his baseball-playing days.\n\n\"We've gotta keep getting him fundamentally sound in practice,\" Smith says. \"I don't want him thinking on the game field. I want him reacting. Through the week of practice, when he gets all those reps, that's when he's gotta focus on that and concentrate on his technique.\"\n\nThough Threet's overall numbers aren't pretty - he's not ranked in the top 100 nationally in passing efficiency - Smith is optimistic, noting that it's rare for a such a young player to quarterback a spread offense, which requires him to make multiple decisions quickly on each play.\n\n\"I love his mentality, I love his attitude,\" Smith says. \"The kid wants to work, the kid takes coaching and he doesn't ever question or make excuses for anything, which is why I love him. The second thing is, he showed us all on Saturday there's no quit in that dog right there.\"\n\nAmong an offensive cast that includes a single senior, and has several true freshmen in starting roles, Threet has become an instant leader. He never speaks poorly about anyone, right tackle Stephen Schilling says, noting that Threet's positive attitude and enthusiasm are infectious.\n\n\"The young guys, especially, all look up to him, you can tell,\" Helmuth adds. \"That may be hard to say since we're all big football players, but they ask him for help before they go to anyone else.\n\n\"For a guy that's a freshman to be put in such a big role, nothing has gone to his head. He's still the same Stevie I've known from way back.\"\n\nOr the same Bubba, who wears a Galapagos Island T-shirt given to him by his late grandfather under his uniform; the same fashion-conscious Steven who owns upward of 50 pairs of sneakers he keeps meticulously clean; the same person who possesses other, less tangible, things.\n\n\"He has integrity, he has tremendous passion and character,\" Gray says. \"That's why it's so fantastic to see such a neat kid out there, playing the game he loves. All the hard work has come together for him. Rarely is the world fair. In this case it is.\"\n\nJohn Heuser can be reached at jheuser@annarbornews.com or 734-994-6816."}, {"url": "https://www.lenconnect.com/story/sports/college/2010/09/07/steven-threet-makes-smashing-debut/64116830007/", "page_content": "Brian Calloway\n\nWhile the prospect of sitting out another season was difficult for Steven Threet to handle when he decided to leave the University of Michigan in 2009, the Adrian High School graduate knew it would be in his best interest.\n\nThreet showed just why Saturday and is pleased with the decision he made to transfer.\n\nThe junior quarterback had an impressive debut for the Arizona State football team as he helped the Sun Devils to a 54-9 season-opening win over Football Championship Series school Portland State. Threet completed 14 of 21 passes and threw for 239 yards and two scores in the win.\n\n\u201cAt the time, I thought (transferring) was in my best interest, personally, to become the best player I could,\u201d said Threet during a teleconference Monday. \u201cWhen I had the chance to come down here on my visit and see what was going on, it was just definitely something I wanted to be a part of. I\u2019m glad I made that decision.\u201d\n\nThreet\u2019s 239 passing yards was the highest total by a Sun Devil quarterback in his debut. It was the third-highest total of passing yards by an Arizona State quarterback in his first start since 1993.\n\nSaturday\u2019s contest marked Threet\u2019s first game action since Nov. 15, 2008, when he threw for 22 yards in Michigan\u2019s loss to Northwestern. It was his first start since Nov. 1, 2008 against Purdue.\n\n\u201cIt definitely was a lot of fun to get back out there,\u201d said Threet, who had to sit out last season due to NCAA transfer rules. \u201cI was antsy before the game, but it was a lot of fun to get back out there. Definitely to get the win is all we could ask for.\u201d\n\nThreet, who played just two and a half quarters, finished the contest 11 yards shy of his career-high total of 250 passing yards, which came in Michigan\u2019s loss to Illinois in 2008. He had touchdown passes of 28 and 62 yards to freshman running back Deantre Lewis \u2014 both coming on swing passes. Threet also carried the ball three times for 24 yards. The lone negative was an interception he threw in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to go out and execute the offense,\u201d Threet said. \u201cI knew we had the playmakers, the O-line, and the personnel to be successful. I just wanted to go out and distribute the ball to the guys and let them do the work.\u201d\n\nThreet, who was named Arizona State\u2019s starter by coach Dennis Erickson five days prior to the season opener, believes he has made major strides in the Sun Devils\u2019 offense since the start of spring camp and has transitioned well. He had his ups and downs throughout the spring and spent fall camp in a tight battle with junior Samson Szakacsy and sophomore Brock Osweiler for the starting job.\n\n\u201cI think I just had to stay with it,\u201d Threet said of his improvement. \u201cI had to realize the mistakes would get made. In spring practices, there were days that I didn\u2019t look great. I just had to keep working on it. I had to realize there would be bumps in the road, learn from the mistakes and try not to make them again.\u201d\n\nThreet has been able to develop a strong understanding of the Sun Devils\u2019 new up-tempo no-huddle offense, which was implemented by new coordinator Noel Mazzone upon his arrival in January.\n\n\u201cI focused on the offense and learning it and understanding it,\u201d said Threet. \u201cI\u2019ve had a bevy of offensive coordinators since I\u2019ve been in college and been in a bunch of offenses. To finally be able to sit and really learn one has helped me out a lot. I was able to improve a lot more quickly.\u201d\n\nThe offense was a huge success for the Sun Devils on Saturday. Arizona State finished with 553 yards of total offense, including 311 through the air, had 23 first downs and averaged 8.4 yards per play. The 553 yards was the most by the Sun Devils since Nov. 11, 2006, while the 54 points was the highest total since Sept. 1, 2005.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s nice to see (the offense) come full circle in a game, not just in practice and to see us perform well under the lights,\u201d Threet said. \u201cWe\u2019re happy that we won. By no means do we think the offense is there yet. We have a ways to go, and we have to get better every week.\u201d\n\nNOTES\n\n\u2014 Since 1993, Rudy Carpenter and Sam Keller are the only quarterbacks to throw for more yards than Threet did in their first ASU start.

If you missed those past articles, I will reiterate my stance on the topic:\n\n\n\nFootball is changing. It used to be that if you played high school, college, and maybe even made it to the NFL, you were aware you might be giving up a couple of knees, probably have back problems and maybe injure a shoulder or two. Now, however, it seems the injuries and penalties can be much worse\u2014even devastating.\n\n\n\nChronic Traumatic Encephalopathy\u2014commonly referred to as CTE\u2014is a degenerative brain disease that has been found in football players as young as 18 years old. In boxing, they commonly refer to this disease as being \"punch drunk\". CTE is now showing up in the premature deaths of many football players who struggle with depression. These individuals often experience a brain that is more like that of a 90 year old then a 50 year old.\n\nOne of the higher profile cases was the recent death of Cincinnati Bengals WR Chris Henry. Henry had CTE at the age of 26. There are also studies showing former football players and European soccer players are suffering a higher rate of Lou Gehrig's disease (also known as ALS). Why soccer players? They are taking head shots from a ball traveling at a rate of 80 mph.\n\n\n\nMany researchers linked CTE to concussions, which is accurate, but the more alarming trend is evidence of CTE in players that had no history of concussions; Chris Henry is an example of that theory. Henry reportedly never suffered a concussion. However, after his death from jumping onto a moving vehicle, it was clear he had CTE.\n\n\n\nThis week alone, there have been two alarming cases for football fans and football players, the first incident being the suicide of former Chicago Bears defensive back Dave Duerson. Moments before his death, Duerson sent a text to his family asking for his brain to be tested and the results sent to the NFL. Duerson was suffering from depression and was filing for bankruptcy.\n\n\n\nToday we learn of the apparent retirement of former Michigan QB Steven Threet who has one more year of eligibility left at Arizona State. Steven has suffered four concussions, two of them just last year (Oct. 23 at California and Nov. 26 against UCLA).\n\nThreet told the Arizona Republic on Wednesday that he's still experiencing symptoms\u2014headaches and trouble sleeping\u2014from the last concussion. A source told ESPN that \"Doctors have told him a fifth concussion could be debilitating [..] You don't want to be 35 years old and can't hold up a cup of coffee.\"\n\n\n\nIf you need more proof, read the story about the University of Pennsylvania offensive lineman Owen Thomas who also committed suicide in college. Thomas was the first college football player to have CTE. Here are his mother's chilling words: \u201cI knew there was a missing piece,\u201d says Thomas\u2019 mother, the Rev. Katherine Brearley, of Allentown, Pa. \u201cNo one has given me even a hint of an explanation why Owen, at the drop of a hat, would kill himself. It\u2019s out of all proportion and totally out of his character.\u201d\n\n\n\nBelow is an example of the damage on the brain from CTE:\n\n\n\nTop row: Brain sections showing dense tau protein deposition in multiple areas of frontal cortex (boxes).\n\nBottom row: Microscopic images showing large numbers of tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles (dark brown spots) in the areas of damage.\n\n(photo from BU.edu)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf things don't change, these types of head injuries will effect the long term viability of the sport we love, and the NFL is finally starting to take this seriously after years of not believing the evidence.\n\nIt's now clearly starting to effect high school and college football as well. Do you want someone you love playing football? Steven, you are making a great decision. Good luck to you outside of football."}, {"url": "https://www.mlive.com/wolverines_stories/2008/03/um_quarterbacks_paths_cross.html", "page_content": "Two and a half years ago, it seemed like the football careers of Steven Threet and Nick Sheridan were heading in opposite directions.\n\nBut through a confluence of events, the former Southeastern Conference rivals are competing once again, this time to become the first starting quarterback at the University of Michigan in the Rich Rodriguez era. Then a junior quarterback, Threet led Adrian High School to a 10-7 victory over Sheridan's Saline Hornets on Oct. 7, 2005, and was well on his way to becoming a celebrated prep quarterback and a blue-chip college recruit.\n\nSheridan, however, injured his shoulder in the game and sat out the remainder of his senior season.\n\nThe son of current New York Giants linebackers coach and former Michigan assistant Bill Sheridan, Nick received no scholarship offers after high school. Rather than compete at a Division III school, he accepted an offer from Lloyd Carr to walk on with the Wolverines.\n\nThreet, who finished his high school career in 2006 with 4,824 passing yards and 49 touchdowns, eventually committed to Georgia Tech.\n\nBut even after Threet transferred to Michigan after one semester in Atlanta, the presence of Ryan Mallett made it seem unlikely either player would start for the Wolverines anytime soon.\n\nBut with the retirement of Carr, the hiring of Rodriguez and Mallett's subsequent transfer to Arkansas, the likelihood that either Threet or Sheridan will open the 2008 season as the starting quarterback seems strong.\n\n\"It's definitely opened a window for me to compete to be a starter here at Michigan, but I was never rooting for Ryan to leave,'' Sheridan said. \"I want whatever's best for Ryan, and I wish him the best of luck.''\n\nWith instillation of Rodriguez's spread offense, the proverbial playing field for Wolverine quarterbacks was leveled and, to this point, Threet and Sheridan have risen to the top.\n\nAlthough Rodriguez says the competition is \"wide open,'' Threet and Sheridan have been splitting most of the snaps with the first team.\n\n\"I'm familiar with some of the schemes from high school, so that helped me a lot,'' Threet said. \"But it's different terminology. It's a faster game. We're on the ball quicker, we're snapping the ball quicker, so it's a lot of just getting reps and getting used to the tempo.''\n\nAnd while none of the top three contenders for the starter's spot are elite runners, Rodriguez emphasized after Saturday's 100-play scrimmage how far they have come in the two most important functions of the quarterback in his spread offense: Taking care of the football and running the system.\n\n\"I've always said you like the quarterback in our system to be like a point guard that can shoot the 3 and his assist-to-turnover ratio is way up high on the assist category,'' Rodriguez said. \"If you have some skills and can make some plays in the open field running, that's a good thing, but our guys have gotten better.\n\n\"I was pleased with their play (Saturday).''\n\nThreet said that after transferring, he was confident he could compete for the starting position, no matter who was on the roster, while Sheridan said his goal coming in as a walk-on was do whatever he could to help the team.\n\nWith the starting job in sight, both are still taking that approach.\n\n\"I just want whatever's best for Michigan,'' Sheridan said. \"If that means I'm the starting quarterback, I'm more than ready to do that.''\n\nSeth Gordon can be reached at sgordon@annarbornews.com or 734-994-6108."}, {"url": "https://www.mlive.com/wolverines/2008/04/threet_outperforms_sheridan_at.html", "page_content": "A chilling rain fell periodically, big plays came on occasion and the final spring scrimmage under new coach Rich Rodriguez offered nothing definitive about what the University of Michigan football team will look like come August.\n\n\"We're not even close to being ready to playing any football games,'' Rodriguez said afterward. Or deciding on a quarterback. Although redshirt freshman Steven Threet lined up with the first team and outperformed redshirt sophomore walk-on Nick Sheridan on Saturday, the players and their coach said the competition to succeed Chad Henne would continue.\n\n\"They haven't made a depth chart,'' the 6-foot-\n\n6-inch Threet said. \"It's just going out every day and not worrying about the depth chart. Just going out and playing.''\n\nDuring the scrimmage, which was held at Saline High School because of construction at Michigan Stadium, Threet led the first unit to a field goal and a touchdown on its first two possessions. The touchdown came courtesy of running back Brandon Minor, who cut into the end zone for the 12-yard score.\n\nMinor and fellow back Kevin Grady are vying for the spot vacated by Michigan's all-time leading rusher Mike Hart, one of eight offensive starters who need to be replaced. Both Minor and Grady - who have combined for 1,293 rushing yards in their Michigan careers - consistently drew praise from Rodriguez during the spring. And on the first play of the scrimmage, both lined up in the backfield.\n\n\"This system is never a number one, number two guy,'' Grady said. \"(Coach) tells us every day, there's always a guy on your back. Whatever it takes. If it takes us to share the load, me going in, him going in, whatever it takes for us to win football games, we're gonna do.''\n\nBut with a rebuilt offensive line that includes one returning starter - and fullback Mark Moundros, tight end Carson Butler and wide receiver Greg Mathews as the other experienced players back - the strength of the 2008 Michigan team may be its defense, which features seven returning starters.\n\n\"The defense is coming along,'' Rodriguez said. \"I expect that. We've got more experience on that side of the ball.''\n\nSo when the offense scored early on Saturday, the defenders started talking on the sideline.\n\n\"We were like, 'Oh, no, this ain't happening any more,'' said safety Stevie Brown, who had the only interception off Threet. Threet, who threw with accuracy on short and intermediate routes, was less precise when he passed deep.\n\nThe defense, which gained momentum as the scrimmage continued, intercepted Sheridan three times and third-stringer David Cone once. Sophomore cornerback Troy Woolfolk, who played with the second unit, returned one pick nearly the length of the field for a touchdown.\n\n\"That's (defensive coordinator Scott) Shafer's main thing,'' Brown said. \"He preaches turnovers ... He wants everybody hit, and he wants 'em hit hard and he wants 'em hit behind the line of scrimmage.''\n\nAlthough the coaches haven't said so, middle linebacker Obi Ezeh noted that the defense understands it will play a crucial role as the team's inexperienced offense adapts to Rodriguez's spread attack.\n\n\"Subconsciously we all pretty much know that if the offense isn't getting it going we have to be the rock,'' he said. \"Be solid until they get it going.''\n\nJohn Heuser can be reached\n\nat jheuser@annarbornews.com or 734-994-6816."}]}
