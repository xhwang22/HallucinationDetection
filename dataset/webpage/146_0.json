Some of these songs include \u201cSi La Vida Son Dos D\u00edas,\u201d \u201cSarandonga,\u201d and \u201cLo Voy A Dividir.\u201d\n\nIn 2002, she even won a Goya award for Best New Actress and wrote some songs on the soundtrack.\n\nHer daughter, Elena, carries on the tradition and is also a Spanish actress.\n\n11. Montserrat Caballe\n\nOf course, not everyone on this list is famous for being a Spanish pop star. Montserrat Caballe is one of the most famous female opera singers of all time, and her specialty was opera.\n\nCaballe was born in Barcelona and rose to fame as a Verdi performer. She was already a famous soprano when asked to perform the 1992 Olympic theme, \u201cBarcelona,\u201d with superstar Freddie Mercury.\n\nCaballe won multiple awards and Grammys throughout her career.

Monica Naranjo\n\nHaving one of the most powerful vocals in both Spain and Latin America, Monica Naranjo knew from a very early age that she loved music.\n\nShe was gifted with a voice recorder at age 14 and enrolled in music school.

It was a hit in Mexico, featuring songs that ranked on the charts such as \u201cFuego De Pasi\u00f3n,\u201d \u201cEl Amor Coloca,\u201d and \u201cSola.\u201d\n\nThis eventually enabled her to release more albums that met commercial success.

She wanted to focus on touring and promoting her album well before releasing a new one.\n\n15. Raquel del Rosario\n\nKnown as the lead singer for the Spanish band El Sue\u00f1o de Morfeo, Raquel del Rosario didn\u2019t get her start by knowing anyone famous.\n\nInstead, she was a self-taught musician, writing her songs by age 14. When she was 17, she met professional singer David Feito and joined his group. It was this move that vaulted Rosario into fame and made her a household name in Spain.\n\nAlthough Rosario had her start, she grew even more famous when she competed in several band competitions and reality singing competitions. She is still a member of the band El Sue\u00f1o de Morfeo as of this writing.\n\n16.

Aitana\n\nThe youngest singer on this list, Aitana Oca\u00f1a Morales came to fame through a television singing contest. More known simply as Aitana, she was the runner-up, but her song \u201cLo Malo\u201d became a number one hit in Spain for several weeks.\n\n\u201cLo Malo\u201d was not the only one of Aitana\u2019s songs to hit #1. Her next hit, \u201cTelefono\u201d broke many records and was the #1 song streamed in Spain in 2018.\n\nAitana continues to release music through her contract with Universal Music.

Her career has spanned movies, television, stage shows, dancing, and of course, singing. Sevilla has truly done it all in her long career.\n\nAlthough Sevilla is mostly famous for acting, she used her television and film career as a springboard for dancing and singing. The musical films she acted in were part of how Sevilla was able to release her records.\n\nThrough this fame, she released several records, toured, and performed on live television many times.\n\n19. Bad Gyal\n\nBorn Alba Farelo I Sol\u00e9, Bad Gyal has chosen a stage name that reflects her anti-establishment, pop-trap music style. She became famous after releasing a cover of Rihanna\u2019s \u201cWork\u201d in her native language of Catalan.\n\nSince then, Bad Gyal has become a fixture in the hip-hop, EDM, and dance hall scene. Her catchy tunes and danceable beats make her music popular in clubs and dance halls all over Spain.\n\nShe does more than write music and perform it; Bad Gyal is also an established DJ and model.\n\nFinal Thoughts On Our List Of Popular Spanish Female Singers\n\nFrom opera to hip-hop, these women have risen to fame because of their musical talent. The younger generation builds off the hard work and trailblazing of the older generation to create a lasting legacy of Spanish female musicians.\n\nIt\u2019s exciting to see what talent will emerge next!"}, {"url": "https://pantheon.world/profile/person/Sara_Montiel", "page_content": "Sara Montiel\n\nMar\u00eda Antonia Abad Fern\u00e1ndez MML (10 March 1928 \u2013 8 April 2013), known professionally as Sara Montiel, also Sarita Montiel, was a Spanish actress and singer.

Why Sara Montiel? Well, not because she died on April 8th -- the same day as Margaret Thatcher and Annette Funicello -- not because she was a great actress, a talented singer, a sex symbol -- a legend, basically in her native Spain and beyond -- but because she was a character.\n\nThis is no obituary. I'm not going to breakdown her life story \u00e0 la what-every-other-news-outlet did because, God, how tedious and boring would that be? Plus that's what Wikipedia is for. I'm just gonna detail my imaginary cocktail party because making up silly scenarios is how I deal with the loss of people I admire. (You should have seen my mother's face when she walked in on her full-grown son while he was \"hanging out with Chavela Vargas at a dirty cantina in Coyoacan, Mexico,\" AKA I was getting wasted in my parent's living room while hugging and talking to a floor lamp.)\n\nSeriously, if my dream cocktail party ever came true, I know Sarita would undoubtedly show up dressed in an ostentatious gown, sporting a marvelously coiffed hairdo, and she'd sing \"Fumando espero\" -- among various other hits from her extensive catalogue -- to myself and the rest of the adoring guests. Oh and speaking of guests, many of Montiel's \"co-workers\" should be sitting around the room, benevolently heckling her from a distance. Famous co-stars such as Arturo Cordoba (\"Furia Roja,\" 1951), Fernando Rey (\"Locura de amor,\" 1948), Katy Jurado (\"C\u00e1rcel de mujeres,\" 1951), Pedro Infante (\"Necesito dinero,\" 1952), Burt Lancaster, Gary Cooper (\"Vera Cruz,\" 1954), Vincent Price (\"Serenade,\" 1956), and -- why not? -- Charles Bronson! (\"Yuma,\" 1957).\n\nIn between songs \"Sarit\u00edsima\" as nickname given to her by Terenci Moix, would gladly entertain all her guests with salacious stories about hooking up with James Dean, cooking eggs for Marlon Brando, and smoking Cuban cigars with Ernest-fucking-Hemingway. Other quips about the men in her life -- such as Hollywood director Anthony Mann, her first husband, and Cuban cameraman Tony Hern\u00e1ndez, her fifth and last husband who was her 38 years her junior and gave the press lots to gossip about -- would also come about.\n\nOf course, Sara Montiel didn't need to name drop in order to prove she's no lighweight; taking a look at any thorough internet data base will show Montiel participated in more than 40 films -- in Spain, Mexico, and Hollywood -- and sang various styles of music in over 20 records (Hello, Fangoria!).\n\nAh, but being incredibly talented, beautiful, and successful doesn't make you impervious to one unforgettable flaw: taking yourself too seriously. One of Sara's most overlooked qualities, especially as she got older is that she was never afraid to be irrelevant or to poke fun at herself. Acting out weird MTV spots or laughing off false news reports of her death (\"Worried [people] have been calling my house and I'm like 'Hey, it's the dead one. What's up?\") proved she could take a joke. That gives me another reason to make her the host of my dreamed-up soiree.\n\nThroughout the night, I'd stick to Sarita's side like a leech because I wouldn't forgive myself if I missed any of her remarks. She's already blessed us with many gems of phrases (\"I sleep with my ass up in the air, naked, and in silk bed sheets\" and what became household in Spain \"What's going on?! What treachery is this?!\") but, considering she always gave hilarious interviews, I know she would be on fire.\n\nAt the end of the cocktail party, once we've all mingled, Montiel would retake the stage and, before signing off for the night, she'd kick off \"La violetera,\" her iconic song about a pretty girl who sells violets (\"La violetera,\" 1958) Sara will be holding a basket full of flowers -- and I'll buy out her stock -- but, before the song is over, before the curtain closes in front of her, I'll gift them all back."}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/sara-montiel", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nSara Montiel (Mar\u00eda Antonia Abad Fern\u00e1ndez) was born on 10 March, 1928 in Campo de Criptana, Ciudad Real, Castilla-La Mancha, Spain, is an Actress, Soundtrack, Producer.

She worked in Europe, Latin America and United States. Her films The Last Torch Song and The Violet Seller netted the highest gross revenues ever recorded for films made in the Spanish-speaking movie industry during the 1950s/60s. Montiel's film Variety was banned in Beijing in 1973. She played the role of Antonia, the niece of Don Quixote, in the 1947 Spanish film version of Cervantes's great novel.\n\nShe was portrayed in the Pedro Almod\u00f3var film Bad Education by a male actor in drag (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) as the cross-dressing character Zahara, and a film clip from one of her movies was used, as well.\n\nActing career Montiel started in movies at 15 in her native Spain where she filmed her first movie playing an Islamic princess in the 1948 film Madness for Love, released in the U.S. as The Mad Queen. Later worked in Mexico, starring in a dozen films in less than five years. Hollywood came calling afterwards, and she was introduced to United States moviegoers in the film Vera Cruz (1954) co-starring Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster, and directed by Robert Aldrich. She was offered the standard seven-year contract at Columbia Pictures, which she refused, afraid of Hollywood's typecasting policies for Hispanics. Instead she freelanced at Warner Bros. with Mario Lanza and Joan Fontaine in Serenade (1956), directed by Anthony Mann, and at RKO in Samuel Fuller's Run of the Arrow (1957), opposite Rod Steiger and Charles Bronson.\n\nFrom The Last Torch Song (1957) on she combined filming, recording songs in five languages and performing live.

They recorded the title track \"Absolutamente\" as a duet. The music video for the song was released in early 2010. She had no plans to retire, and, in May 2011, after almost 40 years without making a movie, she accepted to perform in a feature film directed by \u00d3scar Parra de Carrizosa.

She began her career in the 1940s and became the most internationally popular and highest paid star of Spanish cinema in the 1960s. She appeared in nearly fifty films and recorded around 500 songs in five different languages.\n\nMontiel was born in Campo de Criptana in the region of La Mancha in 1928. She began her acting career in Spain starring in films such as Don Quixote (1947) and Madness for Love (1948). She moved to Mexico where she starred in films such as Women's Prison (1951) and Red Fury (1951). She then moved to the United States and worked in three Hollywood English-language films Vera Cruz (1954), Serenade (1956) and Run of the Arrow (1957). She returned to Spain to star in the musical films The Last Torch Song (1957) and The Violet Seller (1958). These two films netted the highest gross revenues ever recorded internationally for films made in the Spanish-speaking movie industry during the 1950s/60s and made her immensely popular. She then established herself also as a singer thanks to the songs she performed in her films and combined filming new musical films, recording songs and performing live.\n\nThroughout her career, Montiel's personal life was the subject of constant media attention in the Spanish-speaking world. She was married four times and adopted two children.\n\nCareer\n\nMontiel started in movies at sixteen in her native Spain, where she appeared in a secondary role in her first movie, Te quiero para m\u00ed (I want you for myself) in 1944, immediately followed by a leading role in Empez\u00f3 en boda (It Began with a Wedding) also in 1944. They were followed by roles in films such as Mariona Rebull (1946), Don Quixote (1947) and Madness for Love (1948). In April 1950, accompanied by her mother, she moved to Mexico and starred in a dozen films there in less than five years, including Women's Prison (1951), Red Fury (1951) and Cinnamon Skin (1953).\n\nSara Montiel attending the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Week in 1956.\n\nHollywood came calling afterwards, and she was introduced to United States moviegoers in the film Vera Cruz (1954), directed by Robert Aldrich. She was offered the standard seven-year contract at Columbia Pictures, which she refused, afraid of Hollywood's typecasting policies for Hispanics. Instead she freelanced at Warner Bros. in Serenade (1956), directed by Anthony Mann, whom she married in 1957, and at RKO in Samuel Fuller's Run of the Arrow (1957).\n\nBetween November 1956 and January 1957, before filming Run of the Arrow, she filmed in Barcelona the musical film The Last Torch Song during a vacation in Spain and as a deference to its director Juan de Ordu\u00f1a. The film, that was filmed with a very low budget, became unexpectedly a worldwide megahit. Initially, the songs in the film were going to be sung by a professional singer who would dub Montiel, but due to the low budget, she eventually sang the songs herself. The film soundtrack album also became a hit.\n\nFollowing this success, in June 1957 she signed with producer Benito Perojo a lavish contract to make four films in three years, being the first of them The Violet Seller, a 1958 large-budget international co-production musical film. The economic agreement was ten million pesetas (US$240,000 as of 1957) for four films, which means that she was to receive 2.5 million pesetas (US$60,000) per film, making her the highest-paid Spanish star at a time when the highest-paid stars were netting one million pesetas (US$24,000) per film. The success of The Violet Seller surp*ed that of The Last Torch Song, and in a contractual dispute for the next film, A Girl Against Napoleon (1959), the agreement was improved by securing for her the twenty per cent of the producer's net revenue. She also signed a contract with Hispavox to record and release the soundtrack albums of her films for which she netted the ten per cent of the records sale as royalties. The Violet Seller soundtrack album, the first with them, topped sales in Spain and in Latin America and, in July 1959, Hispavox served a Golden Disk award to her for the number of records sold there.\n\nAll this made her a film and singing international superstar. Almost all of her next films earned high box office results and she combined filming, recording songs and performing live. She was the highest paid star of Spanish cinema, and many years later, she began to say that she had been paid more than US$1 million for each of these films, something that the press widely reported as the actual figure. Among the next films during the 1960s and early 1970s were My Last Tango (1960), Pecado de amor (1961), The Lovely Lola (a 1962 version of La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias), Casablanca, Nest of Spies (1963), Samba (1964), The Lost Woman (1966), Tuset Street (1967), Esa Mujer (1969) and Variety (1971). The film Variety was banned in Beijing in 1973.\n\nIn 1974, she announced her retirement from movies, as she become dissatisfied with the movie industry and the overt nudity in films, but continued performing live, recording and starring on her own variety television shows in Spain. In 2002 she was the advertising image of the MTV Europe Music Awards held in Barcelona.\n\nIn November 2009, singer Alaska who forms the Spanish pop group Fangoria with Nacho Canut, invited Montiel to record a track sharing vocals with her for the re-release of the band's album Absolutamente. They recorded the *le track \"Absolutamente\" as a duet. The music video for the song was released on 18 December 2009. Well into her eighties, she had no plans to retire, and continued working in various projects. In May 2011, after almost forty years without making a movie, she performed in a feature film directed by \u00d3scar Parra de Carrizosa. The film *le is Abr\u00e1zame and was shot on location in La Mancha.\n\nShe is considered \"one of the most important actresses in the history of Spain\", and has been described by Spain's press as a \"myth of Spanish cinema.\" She has also been characterized as \"the most beautiful woman of twentieth century Spain.\" She has also been called a \"sexual, feminist, and gay icon for Francoist Spain.\"\n\nPersonal information\n\nMonument to Montiel in Campo de Criptana.\n\nMontiel, whose complete name was Mar\u00eda Antonia Alejandra Vicenta Elpidia Isidora Abad Fern\u00e1ndez, was born in 1928 in Campo de Criptana (Ciudad Real), Spain. She entered films after winning a talent contest at age fifteen. In her first movie, she was credited as \"Mar\u00eda Alejandra\" a shortened version of her real name. For her next film, she changed her name to Sara, after her grandmother, and Montiel after the Montiel fields in La Mancha region of her birth. It was in Mexico where she first learned how to read and write, taught by the poet Le\u00f3n Felipe, and in 1951 she acquired Mexican dual nationality.

She also claimed a long-term affair in the 1940s with playwright Miguel Mihura and mentioned that science wizard Severo Ochoa, a Nobel Prize winner, was the true love of her life.\n\nIn her later years, she became an iconic figure to the gay community, and noted \"Cuando voy a actuar a alguna ciudad de EE UU all\u00ed est\u00e1n todos los gays de la ciudad\" (Whenever I perform in any city in the US, all the gays from that city show up).

An acknowledged beauty with an almost husky singing voice, Montiel starred in more than 50 films, many of which were musicals.\n\nShe married Anthony Mann, an American actor and film director, in 1957. But press reports, which Montiel never denied, claimed she had turbulent affairs with author Ernest Hemingway and actor James Dean.\n\nShe became known for smoking Havana cigars on stage while singing, something that was at the time associated mostly with men. Montiel said it was Hemingway who taught her to smoke.\n\nAfter limited success in Spain, her career took off in Mexico in the late 1940s where she featured in successful Spanish language films such as \u201cCarcel de Mujeres\u201d (Women\u2019s Prison).\n\nFrom there she made the leap to Hollywood, where she soon attracted the attention of actors and directors.

The artist, who started acting at age 16, appeared in about fifty films and recorded nearly 500 songs.\n\n\"Sara was a woman who did what she wanted. Nobody could with beat her: neither Mexico, nor the United States nor the Franco regime [in Spain],\" says Israel Rol\u00f3n-Barada, a Spanish professor at Drexel University and a friend of Montiel during her last years of life.\n\nRol\u00f3n-Barada refers to the indomitable character of the Iberian superstar. To fully understand and value Montiel\u2019s legacy,he says, her career must be viewed in terms of its four key stages.\n\nThe first was as a novice actress in the Spain of the 1940s, an impoverished country that had taken a step back in women\u2019s civil rights under the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco.\n\nAccording to Rol\u00f3n-Barada, Montiel was ahead of her time, a post-war woman who had to fight to be a protagonist in a society that had relegated her to play the role the Catholic Church commanded: a good mother, a good wife, a good housewife.\n\nMontiel managed to make 14 films in Spain before age 21, barely knowing how to read and write. To professor Rol\u00f3n-Barada, \"the lack of academic training can explain why Sara didn\u2019t have an automatic success during that first phase. She was very young and very weak facing seasoned actresses like Imperio Argentina or Amparo Rivelles.\u201d\n\nThe second moment of her career began in 1950, when the actress and her mother moved to Mexico in search of better opportunities. Mexico was the mecca of the Latin American film industry and was in the middle of its golden age.\n\nThere, Montiel got in touch with a circle of exiled Spanish intellectuals and improved her literacy skills with the help of poet Le\u00f3n Felipe.\n\nRol\u00f3n-Barada affirms that it is in Mexico where Sara's innate talent fused with her good luck \u2014 \u201can incredible luck because there she gets to work directly with Pedro Infante, who is at the peak of his career, and with Agust\u00edn Lara, the number one composer of Latin American music.\"\n\nNext to Infante, Montiel starred in films like Necesito Dinero, Ah\u00ed viene Mart\u00edn Corona (Little Love of my Life), and El Enamorado (all in 1952). \"She represented a challenge \u2014 she was the woman who broke the molds of that time and challenged her husband, a challenge to the Mexican \u201cmacho\u201d and the Hispanic male,\" says the professor.\n\nIn Mexico, she learned and evolved until she starred in Piel Canela (1953), a role that was made for her and film made to fit her and that leveraged Sara towards what would be, according to Rol\u00f3n-Barada, the third stage of her career: Hollywood.\n\n\"She does not go to Hollywood to look for a job or to knock on doors, but Hollywood comes to her to offer her contracts,\" he affirmed.\n\nMontiel debuted without knowing English in American film industry in 1954, playing the role of Nina in Vera Cruz, a western starring Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster. The film was followed by blockbusters such as Serenade (1956) and Run of the Arrow (1957).\n\nIt was in the mecca of American film industry \u2013and consolidated as a world star\u2013 when Montiel's career began to stagnate.\n\n\"She fell into the same problem that many others experienced: she had two possibilities, she was being offered roles as Mexican or as American Indian,\" says Rol\u00f3n-Barada. \u201cBecause that stereotype existed, once they labeled her that way, they continued to see her as only that.\"\n\nSeven years after having left her mother country, Montiel returned to Spain and it was at that time \u2014the fourth stage in her career \u2014that the artist established herself as one of the most important actresses in the history of Spain.\n\nThere, she starred in El \u00daltimo Cupl\u00e9 (The Last Torch Song, 1957), a film that according to Rol\u00f3n-Barada \"changed her life because[with it] she achieves total success with a minimal budget and [also] brings back the musical, a genre from the 1920s.\u201d\n\nEl \u00daltimo Cupl\u00e9 was followed by blockbusters like La Violetera (1958), Mi \u00daltimo Tango (1960), La Bella Lola (1962), White House Nights (1963) and La Mujer Perdida (1966).\n\nA life to discover\n\nSara Montiel died in Madrid on April 8, 2013, at 85 years of age and with a public life known A to Z by her followers and the media.\n\nHowever, three years ago a biography that promises to \"reveal the hardest and difficult aspects of life that she had to face in order to become Sara Montiel,\" began to be \u201ccooked over a slow fire\u201d in Philadelphia, where Dr. Israel Rol\u00f3n-Barada lives and teaches. Rol\u00f3n-Barada was an admirer of Sara during his adolescence, a friend of the superstar during her last years of life, and has now become her biographer.\n\nThe goal of the book, with a preliminary title of \"The Cost of Being Sara Montiel,\u201d is in the author\u2019s words \"to explain her real life trajectory: we all know how beautiful she was, the immense volume of her cinematographic and musical legacy, but we don\u2019t know the difficulties and very hard things that this woman had to go through to achieve her goal of being a professional actress.\"\n\nRol\u00f3n-Barada recalls that his interest in Sara began very early in his life during his teenage years in San Juan, Puerto Rico. There, every day after school, he went with almost religious discipline to the daily appointment he had with Hispanic cinema at his house.\n\nThe TV show was called \u201cCine de la tarde con Pilar Arenas,\u201d broadcasted on Channel 2.\n\n\"We used to watch the movies and then the next day we commented and sang the songs. That's how my admiration for Sara Montiel began,\" Rol\u00f3n-Barada remembers.\n\nIn 2001, while doing a Ph.D. in M\u00e1laga, Spain, he met her in person during a presentation and signing of her autobiography, Memorias, Vivir es un Placer.\n\nIn 2011, the Modern Language Association of America organized its annual conference in Seattle, which included- a panel called \u201cFrom Conchita Piquer to Isabel Pantoja: Divas and the Spanish Cultural Imaginary.\u201d\n\nBefore the panel, Rol\u00f3n-Barada managed a two-day interview with Sara Montiel on the island of Tabarca, a situation that, according to the professor, amused the diva because it came only 48 hours after their first talk on the phone, after which Rol\u00f3n-Barada flew from Philadelphia to Spain to meet her in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nRol\u00f3n-Barada says that this biography differs from others that have come out about Montiel because his approach to documenting her life is as an academic and cultural historian, resulting in a tone and content distinct from the commercial or sensationalist elements of other publications.\n\nFor now, the professor needs to work on a couple of details and conduct a few additional interviews in Mexico and Spain before finishing his version of Montiel's life, which he expects to publish at the beginning of next spring."}, {"url": "https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/sarita_montiel", "page_content": "Highest Rated: 81% Vera Cruz (1954)\n\nLowest Rated: 81% Vera Cruz (1954)\n\nBirthday: Mar 10, 1928\n\nBirthplace: Campo de Criptana, Spain\n\nSarita Montiel was an actress who had a successful Hollywood career.

Later she conquered Mexico starring in a dozen films in less than five years. Hollywood came calling after and she was introduced to US moviegoers in the film 'Vera Cruz' (1954) co-starring with Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster and directed by Robert Aldrich. She was offered the standard seven-year contract at Columbia Pictures which she quickly refused, afraid of Hollywood's typecasting policies for Hispanics. Instead she free-lanced at Warner Bros. with Mario Lanza and Joan Fontaine in 'Serenade' (1956) directed by Anthony Mann and at RKO in Samuel Fuller's 'Run of the arrow' (1957), opposite Rod Steiger and Charles Bronson.\n\nThat same year she married Anthony Mann but returned briefly to Spain to star in a low budget film musical 'El ultimo cupl\u00e9' as a favor to producer-director Juan de Ordu\u00f1a who had helped her career in the early days. In the movie she was the first woman to display a low cleavage openly in Spanish cinema at a time when even a low cut dress was not acceptable. The cover for the album of the same title was censored. This film made her unexpectedly the number one actress-singer of that year in Europe and Latin America and she accepted a multi-million dollar offer for more films and recordings in Europe. Fifteen films followed her Cupl\u00e9 success, including 'La violetera' (1958), 'Mi ultimo tango' (1960), 'Noches de Casablanca' (a 1963 tribute to Hollywood's 'Casablanca'), 'Esa mujer' (1969) and 'Variet\u00e9s' (1971). Her films 'El ultimo cuple' and 'La violetera' netted the highest gross revenues ever recorded for films made in the Spanish speaking movie industry during the 50s and 60s.\n\nMost of the movies were accompanied by a soundtrack album which also pushed her career as a singer. During these years she recorded over 30 albums and appeared on stage and television all over the world. In 1974 Montiel announced her retirement from movies and continued non-stop performing live, recording and starring on her own variety television shows in Spain. She continued at that pace well into the 1990s. In 2000 she released her autobiography Memories: 'To live is a pleasure' followed by a second book called 'Sara and sex', which highlighted her love life. In 2005 Montiel was portrayed in the Pedro Almod\u00f3var film 'La mala educaci\u00f3n' by actor Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal as the character Zahara. In 2006 Montiel temporarily put aside her career in order to help her adopted son Zeus with his first recordings. Sarita died at the age of 85 on april 8, 2013.\n\nOn the web:\n\n- http://infomontiel.tripod.com/id17.htm\n\n- http://www.visitingsaramontiel.com\n\nIf you like this, you probably like... / european counterparts:\n\n\n\nWhat do we think:\n\nPR: Sarita Montiel is more actress than singer. But with an oeuvre of more than 30 albums since the late fifties, she is definitely one of Spain's most popular musical artists of the 20th century. And - whatever you may think of her - she still succeeds in claiming a spot in the limelights with her writings. Her material is mostly very traditional Hollywood-with-Spanish-lyrics and her singing is not tremendous. On the other hand, she sung a few beautiful songs that became international classics ('La violetra'). Her latest releases (eigthies & nineties) are over-the-top synthesiser disco albums, probably recorded for the gay-disco's and her die-hard fans.\n\nDB: Everyone who has seen Almodov\u00e1r's 'La mala educaci\u00f3n' will remember transvestite Sahara miming a warmblooded song in the microphone. Well, i do, and it was my first encounter with the music of Sarita, the singer Sahara is impersonating. While in Barcelona I tried to find as much of her orginal material i could lay my hands on including an autographed copy of Ulitmo Cuple (no, not the one with the revealing cover). Sarita made some great music but maybe suffers from some over confidence.

She began her career in the 1940s and became the most internationally popular and highest paid star of Spanish cinema in the 1960s. She appeared in nearly fifty films and recorded around 500 songs in five different languages.\n\nMontiel was born in Campo de Criptana in the region of La Mancha in 1928. She began her acting career in Spain starring in films such as Don Quixote (1947) and Madness for Love (1948). She moved to Mexico where she starred in films such as Women's Prison (1951) and Red Fury (1951). She then moved to the United States and worked in three Hollywood English-language films Vera Cruz (1954), Serenade (1956) and Run of the Arrow (1957). She returned to Spain to star in the musical films The Last Torch Song (1957) and The Violet Seller (1958). These two films netted the highest gross revenues ever recorded internationally for films made in the Spanish-speaking movie industry during the 1950s/60s and made her immensely popular. She then established herself also as a singer thanks to the songs she performed in her films and combined filming new musical films, recording songs and performing live.\n\nThroughout her career, Montiel's personal life was the subject of constant media attention in the Spanish-speaking world. She was married four times and adopted two children.\n\nCareer\n\nMontiel started in movies at sixteen in her native Spain, where she appeared in a secondary role in her first movie, Te quiero para m\u00ed (I want you for myself) in 1944, immediately followed by a leading role in Empez\u00f3 en boda (It Began with a Wedding) also in 1944. They were followed by roles in films such as Mariona Rebull (1946), Don Quixote (1947) and Madness for Love (1948). In April 1950, accompanied by her mother, she moved to Mexico and starred in a dozen films there in less than five years, including Women's Prison (1951), Red Fury (1951) and Cinnamon Skin (1953).\n\nSara Montiel attending the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Week in 1956.\n\nHollywood came calling afterwards, and she was introduced to United States moviegoers in the film Vera Cruz (1954), directed by Robert Aldrich. She was offered the standard seven-year contract at Columbia Pictures, which she refused, afraid of Hollywood's typecasting policies for Hispanics. Instead she freelanced at Warner Bros. in Serenade (1956), directed by Anthony Mann, whom she married in 1957, and at RKO in Samuel Fuller's Run of the Arrow (1957).\n\nBetween November 1956 and January 1957, before filming Run of the Arrow, she filmed in Barcelona the musical film The Last Torch Song during a vacation in Spain and as a deference to its director Juan de Ordu\u00f1a. The film, that was filmed with a very low budget, became unexpectedly a worldwide megahit. Initially, the songs in the film were going to be sung by a professional singer who would dub Montiel, but due to the low budget, she eventually sang the songs herself. The film soundtrack album also became a hit.\n\nFollowing this success, in June 1957 she signed with producer Benito Perojo a lavish contract to make four films in three years, being the first of them The Violet Seller, a 1958 large-budget international co-production musical film. The economic agreement was ten million pesetas (US$240,000 as of 1957) for four films, which means that she was to receive 2.5 million pesetas (US$60,000) per film, making her the highest-paid Spanish star at a time when the highest-paid stars were netting one million pesetas (US$24,000) per film. The success of The Violet Seller surp*ed that of The Last Torch Song, and in a contractual dispute for the next film, A Girl Against Napoleon (1959), the agreement was improved by securing for her the twenty per cent of the producer's net revenue. She also signed a contract with Hispavox to record and release the soundtrack albums of her films for which she netted the ten per cent of the records sale as royalties. The Violet Seller soundtrack album, the first with them, topped sales in Spain and in Latin America and, in July 1959, Hispavox served a Golden Disk award to her for the number of records sold there.\n\nAll this made her a film and singing international superstar. Almost all of her next films earned high box office results and she combined filming, recording songs and performing live. She was the highest paid star of Spanish cinema, and many years later, she began to say that she had been paid more than US$1 million for each of these films, something that the press widely reported as the actual figure. Among the next films during the 1960s and early 1970s were My Last Tango (1960), Pecado de amor (1961), The Lovely Lola (a 1962 version of La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias), Casablanca, Nest of Spies (1963), Samba (1964), The Lost Woman (1966), Tuset Street (1967), Esa Mujer (1969) and Variety (1971). The film Variety was banned in Beijing in 1973.\n\nIn 1974, she announced her retirement from movies, as she become dissatisfied with the movie industry and the overt nudity in films, but continued performing live, recording and starring on her own variety television shows in Spain. In 2002 she was the advertising image of the MTV Europe Music Awards held in Barcelona.\n\nIn November 2009, singer Alaska who forms the Spanish pop group Fangoria with Nacho Canut, invited Montiel to record a track sharing vocals with her for the re-release of the band's album Absolutamente. They recorded the *le track \"Absolutamente\" as a duet. The music video for the song was released on 18 December 2009. Well into her eighties, she had no plans to retire, and continued working in various projects. In May 2011, after almost forty years without making a movie, she performed in a feature film directed by \u00d3scar Parra de Carrizosa. The film *le is Abr\u00e1zame and was shot on location in La Mancha.\n\nShe is considered \"one of the most important actresses in the history of Spain\", and has been described by Spain's press as a \"myth of Spanish cinema.\" She has also been characterized as \"the most beautiful woman of twentieth century Spain.\" She has also been called a \"sexual, feminist, and gay icon for Francoist Spain.\"\n\nPersonal information\n\nMonument to Montiel in Campo de Criptana.\n\nMontiel, whose complete name was Mar\u00eda Antonia Alejandra Vicenta Elpidia Isidora Abad Fern\u00e1ndez, was born in 1928 in Campo de Criptana (Ciudad Real), Spain. She entered films after winning a talent contest at age fifteen. In her first movie, she was credited as \"Mar\u00eda Alejandra\" a shortened version of her real name. For her next film, she changed her name to Sara, after her grandmother, and Montiel after the Montiel fields in La Mancha region of her birth. It was in Mexico where she first learned how to read and write, taught by the poet Le\u00f3n Felipe, and in 1951 she acquired Mexican dual nationality. She was married four times, and was ex-communicated by the Catholic Church in Spain for the civil-wedding ceremony of her first marriage:\n\nAnthony Mann (American actor, film director); 1957\u201363 (divorced)\n\nJos\u00e9 Vicente Ram\u00edrez Olalla (attorney); 1964\u201370 (divorced)\n\nJos\u00e9 Tous Barber\u00e1n (attorney, journalist); 1979\u201392 (Tous's death); this union produced two adopted children: Thais (born 1979) and Jos\u00e9 Zeus (born 1983)\n\nAntonio Hern\u00e1ndez (Cuban videotape operator); 2002\u201305 (divorced)\n\nIn 2000, Montiel published her autobiography Memories: To Live Is a Pleasure, an instant best seller with ten editions to date. A sequel Sara and Sex followed in 2003. In these books, she revealed other relationships in her past, including one-night stands with writer Ernest Hemingway as well as actor James Dean. She also claimed a long-term affair in the 1940s with playwright Miguel Mihura and mentioned that science wizard Severo Ochoa, a Nobel Prize winner, was the true love of her life.\n\nIn her later years, she became an iconic figure to the gay community, and noted \"Cuando voy a actuar a alguna ciudad de EE UU all\u00ed est\u00e1n todos los gays de la ciudad\" (Whenever I perform in any city in the US, all the gays from that city show up). Montiel died in 2013 at her home in Madrid at the age of eighty-five from congestive heart failure, and was buried in the San Justo Cemetery in Madrid.\n\nFilmography\n\nDiscography\n\nSara Montiel en Mexico\n\nCanciones de la Pel\u00edcula \"El \u00daltimo Cuple\" - Spain: Columbia.

Sarita Montiel a.k.a. Saritisima, one of the Spanish-speaking world\u2019s biggest film and recording stars, died yesterday, April 8. Montiel, who was found dead by paramedics called to her house in Madrid\u2019s district of Salamanca, was 85. Earlier today, a funeral procession through the streets of Madrid was witnessed (and applauded) by thousands of fans.\n\nSara Montiel was born \u2013 if online sources are to be believed \u2013 Mar\u00eda Antonia Alejandra Vicenta Elpidia Isadora Abad Fern\u00e1ndez to a small farmer and a beauty products saleswoman on March 10, 1928. She left behind her poverty-stricken childhood, during which she spent her days dreaming of film star Imperio Argentina, after moving to post-Civil War Madrid in her mid-teens.\n\nFollowing diction and singing lessons, her film career took off after she landed roles in two 1944 releases: a supporting turn \u2013 billed as Maria Alejandra \u2013 in Ladislao Vajda\u2019s Te quiero para m\u00ed (\u201cI Want You for Me\u201d) and, as Sara Montiel, the young female lead in Raffaello Matarazzo\u2019s comedy about in-laws vs. marriage bliss, Empez\u00f3 en boda (\u201cIt Started at the Wedding\u201d).\n\nEarly Spanish career and her Mexican films\n\nBy the early \u201950s, Sara Montiel had become a well-known name in Spanish-language cinema. In Spain, her roles included those of Don Quixote\u2019s daughter Antonia in Rafael Gil\u2019s Don Quijote de la Mancha (1947), with Rafael Rivelles in the title role and future Luis Bu\u00f1uel collaborator Fernando Rey as Sans\u00f3n Carrasco; and the scheming Muslim princess Aldara in Juan de Ordu\u00f1a\u2019s nationalistic historical melodrama Locura de amor / The Mad Queen (1948), supporting Aurora Bautista as the Spanish queen \u201cJuana la Loca\u201d and Fernando Rey as her husband Felipe.\n\nFollowing a move across the Atlantic, Sara Montiel would star in about a dozen features for the booming Mexican film industry, most notably Miguel M. Delgado\u2019s (possibly Caged-inspired) women-behind-bars melodrama C\u00e1rcel de mujeres (\u201cWomen\u2019s Prison,\u201d 1951), opposite two other Mexican cinema icons, Miroslava and Katy Jurado \u2013 Miroslava and Montiel are enemy inmates in the film, with the former as a widow accused of having murdered her husband, whose lover was the vengeful Montiel; Miguel Morayta\u2019s Ella, Lucifer y yo (\u201cShe, Lucifer and Me,\u201d 1953), in which Abel Salazar makes a pact with the devil (Carlos L\u00f3pez Moctezuma) so luscious singer Montiel will fall in love with him; and Miguel Zacar\u00edas\u2019 Necesito dinero (\u201cI Need Money\u201d), co-starring superstar Pedro Infante as another man doing whatever it takes to gain Montiel\u2019s affection.\n\nSarita Montiel in Hollywood\n\nFor Hollywood studios, Sara Montiel, billed as Sarita Montiel, was featured in what amounted to a supporting role in Robert Aldrich\u2019s successful Mexican-set Western Vera Cruz (1954), starring Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster (and with Denise Darcel as the female lead); Anthony Mann\u2019s poorly received romantic melodrama Serenade (1956), in which singer Mario Lanza is torn between American society dame Joan Fontaine and Mexican wife Montiel; and Samuel Fuller\u2019s post-Civil War Western Run of the Arrow (1957), as a Sioux Indian named Yellow Moccasin (and reportedly voiced by Angie Dickinson) who ends up as U.S. soldier Rod Steiger\u2019s wife.\n\nAccording to online sources, at that time Columbia\u2019s Harry Cohn offered Montiel a seven-year contract, which the actress turned down because she didn\u2019t want to be typecast as Mexican spitfires and Yellow Moccasins in Hollywood movies. Be that as it may, Montiel did accept another kind of Hollywood offer: She and her Serenade director Anthony Mann were married in 1957.\n\nAlso in the \u201950s, Sara Montiel acquired Mexican citizenship. \u201cMexico is my home away from home,\u201d she would remark in a 2007 interview in Miami. \u201cWhen I arrived in Mexico in 1950 all doors were soon thrown open to me, I have great memories from those years.\u201d\n\nOn its home page, the Mexican Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences features an official announcement mourning Sara Montiel\u2019s passing.\n\nSuperstardom\n\n\u201cHollywood was not very kind to me, may be out of envy \u2026 I was an intruder in that world,\u201d Sara Montiel would later say.\n\nFollowing her brief Hollywood stint, Montiel could have resumed her career in Mexico, but at that time she received a good offer from her native country.\n\nSara Montiel became an international superstar following the unexpected success of Juan de Ordu\u00f1a\u2019s El \u00faltimo cupl\u00e9 / The Last Torch Song (1957), co-written by Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda de Arozamena (who would write many of Montiel\u2019s biggest movie hits) and Antonio Mas Guindal.\n\nSharing elements in common with Joseph L. Mankiewicz\u2019s The Barefoot Contessa (1954), the low-budget The Last Torch Song stars Montiel as cabaret singer Mar\u00eda Luj\u00e1n, who finds professional success as a singing star but whose private life is burdened by tragedy.\n\n\u201cAlmost no one had any confidence in that project,\u201d Montiel would recall about The Last Torch Song, which, much like the Mexican melodramas of the period, was a throwback to Hollywood fare of the \u201920s and \u201930s, with Montiel bringing back to life characters played decades earlier by Kay Francis, Corinne Griffith, Ann Harding, Ruth Chatterton, Irene Dunne, Gloria Swanson, and Barbara Stanwyck.\n\n\u201cWhen El \u00faltimo cupl\u00e9 premiered,\u201d Montiel would later recall, \u201cI got to know what success really meant. It was what I wanted, to move the audiences, the masses.\u201d The Last Torch Song reportedly became one of Spain\u2019s biggest blockbusters in history.\n\nSara Montiel movies: La Violetera Sara Montiel movies: La Violetera\n\nNext in line for the sultry, husky-voice actress was another tear-jerking blockbuster: Luis C\u00e9sar Amadori\u2019s La Violetera (\u201cThe Violet Peddler,\u201d 1958), for which Montiel reportedly (if somewhat dubiously) earned US$1 million. In this romantic musical melodrama, Montiel plays Soledad Moreno, a flower seller in turn-of-the-century Madrid who falls in love with an aristocrat (Raf Vallone). Inevitably, class issues arise. The heartbroken Soledad flees Spain for France, where she becomes (once again) a singing sensation. Tears, tantrums, the sinking of the Titanic, psychological trauma, and eternal love ensue. (Image: The sensual Sara Montiel strikes a Gina Lollobrigida-like pose.)\n\n\u201cLa violetera was even bigger than El \u00faltimo cupl\u00e9,\u201d Montiel affirmed. \u201cThat\u2019s when I became fully aware that I was born to become a movie star.\u201d And a recording star as well, as \u201cLa Violetera\u201d was a major seller worldwide, eventually becoming her trademark song.\n\nAmong Sara Montiel\u2019s other personal successes of the late \u201950s and \u201960s were Tulio Demicheli\u2019s Carmen la de Ronda / A Girl Against Napoleon (1959), based on Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e\u2019s novel and co-starring Jorge Mistral and Maurice Ronet; Mi \u00faltimo tango (\u201cMy Last Tango,\u201d 1960), about a maid who inadvertently becomes a tango-singing sensation in Argentina, also co-starring Ronet and directed by La Violetera\u2018s Luis C\u00e9sar Amadori; and Amadori\u2019s Pecado de amor (\u201cSin of Love,\u201d 1961), as a former singing star (Magda Beltr\u00e1n) who becomes a nun (Sister Bel\u00e9n) to atone for her past sins.\n\nHanding \u2018El Cid\u2019 to Sophia Loren\n\nSara Montiel claimed to have turned down the female lead role in husband Anthony Mann\u2019s Spanish-set historical epic El Cid (1961), starring Charlton Heston, recommending the Italian Sophia Loren in her place. El Cid turned out to be a major international hit.\n\nInstead of El Cid, Montiel, whose marriage to Mann would end in divorce in 1963, was seen in Alfonso Balc\u00e1zar\u2019s La bella Lola (1962), a version of Camille co-starring Antonio Cifariello and Franck Villard (in place of Montiel\u2019s original choice, Roger Moore); Rafael Gil\u2019s World War I-set espionage melodrama La reina del Chantecler (\u201cThe Queen of the Chantecler,\u201d 1962), in which Montiel falls for no-good journalist and spy Alberto de Mendoza (among whose spying buddies is Greta Chi\u2019s Mata Hari); and Henri Decoin\u2019s Casablanca, Nest of Spies / Noches de Casablanca (1963), featuring another set of spies, Maurice Ronet, and Fabio Fabrizi. (This film\u2019s French-language title inspired the title, though not necessarily the plot, of the Michel Hazanavicius / Jean Dujardin spoof OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies.)\n\nIn Rafael Gil\u2019s Samba (1965), Sara Montiel plays no less than two (Spanish-speaking) Brazilians: an actress who gets bumped off by her lover and her dead-ringer slum dweller, who, during the course of the film, finds love, intrigue, (rumba-sounding) samba singing, Carnival dancing, and the smuggling of precious stones.\n\n\u2018Esa Mujer\u2019: Pedro Almod\u00f3var inspiration\n\nMario Camus directed Esa mujer (\u201cThis Woman,\u201d 1969), a sort of The Nun\u2019s Story meets Madame X meets Sarah and Son (a 1930 mother love melodrama that earned Ruth Chatterton a Best Actress Academy Award nomination). In Esa mujer, Montiel plays Soledad Romero Fuentes, a missionary nun who gets raped, becomes pregnant, abandons her convent, becomes a singing sensation, falls in love with a man who turns out to be her (long-thought-dead) daughter\u2019s lover, and is ultimately accused of murder. And that\u2019s only part of the plot.\n\nFast-forward to 1983 and inveterate Sara Montiel fan Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s unusual look at life in a convent, Dark Habits / Entre tinieblas, and to 1999 and Almod\u00f3var\u2019s Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award winner All About My Mother, which features Pen\u00e9lope Cruz as a pregnant nun whose \u201cfather of the child\u201d is a transvestite named Lola who also happens to be dying of AIDS.\n\nFive years after All About My Mother, Almod\u00f3var paid direct homage to his idol in the brilliant Bad Education (2004). For starters, Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal sings \u201cQuiz\u00e1s, quiz\u00e1s, quiz\u00e1s\u201d by mimicking Montiel in Casablanca, Nest of Spies. Additionally, Bad Education features its two schoolboy-lovers masturbating one another while watching Montiel in Esa mujer on the big screen.\n\nSara Montiel: Last movies, stage, and television work Sara Montiel: Last movies, stage, and television work\n\nSara Montiel\u2019s last prestigious star vehicle was Juan Antonio Bardem\u2019s Variet\u00e9s (1971), in which she plays an aging actress who still dreams of becoming a star. The middle-aged hopeful eventually gets her chance, but success turns out to be ephemeral.\n\nBy that time, after one formulaic musical melodrama after another, Sara Montiel\u2019s movie-star appeal had been drastically reduced. Refusing to take part in Spain\u2019s then-burgeoning cine del destape \u2013 post-Franco softcore comedies \u2013 Montiel left films following the release of Pedro Lazaga\u2019s comedy Cinco almohadas para una noche (\u201cFive Cushions for One Night,\u201d 1974) \u2013 though she would also be seen the following year in Eduardo Manzanos Brochero\u2019s That\u2019s Entertainment-like compilation feature Canciones de nuestra vida (\u201cSongs of Our Lives\u201d).\n\nThirty-six years later, Montiel would return to the big screen one last time, playing (a parody of) herself in Oscar Parra de Carrizosa\u2019s Abr\u00e1zame (\u201cHug Me,\u201d 2011).\n\nMontiel would later lament that she (unlike Pola Negri, Bette Davis, Elisabeth Bergner, Jeanne Moreau, Marlene Dietrich, Viveca Lindfors, and Tallulah Bankhead) never got to play Catherine the Great. And even though she retired from films right when the fascistic government of Francisco Franco was in its death throes, Montiel also bemoaned the fact that she didn\u2019t have the chance to work with top-quality screenwriters unhindered by Franco\u2019s reactionary right-wing censors.\n\nAs her film career came to a halt, Montiel began focusing on her stage and concert shows. According to online sources, among her live successes, at times smoking a cigar between numbers, were Saritisima \u2013 though Montiel claimed she liked neither the nickname \u201cSaritisima\u201d nor \u201cSarita\u201d \u2013 and Increible Sara (obviously in reference to \u201cThe Incredible Sarah [Bernhardt]\u201d). Her trademark songs included the perennial \u201cLa violetera,\u201d in addition to \u201cB\u00e9same mucho,\u201d \u201cFumando Espero\u201d (\u201cSmoking, I Wait [for the man I love\u2026]\u201d), and the Spanish-language version of \u201cAmado m\u00edo\u201d (performed by Rita Hayworth, with Anita Ellis\u2019 voice, in Charles Vidor\u2019s Gilda). [Please scroll down to listen to Sara Montiel\u2019s husky rendition of \u201cAmado m\u00edo.\u201d]\n\nOn television, Sara Montiel was the star of the miniseries Sara y Punto (1990) and the variety show Ven al Paralelo (1992). She continued recording songs and appearing on several TV shows until the 2000s, most recently in Entrevista a la carta in 2012.\n\nCuriously, Montiel never received an Honorary Goya from the Spanish Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. She did, however, win two Best Actress awards from Spain\u2019s Cinema Writers Circle: for The Last Torch Song and La Violetera.\n\nHusbands and lovers\n\nFollowing her divorce from Anthony Mann, Sara Montiel would marry three more times, including a de facto two-month union with businessman Jos\u00e9 Vicente Ram\u00edrez Olalla in 1964. The marriage would be officially annulled in 1978.\n\nMontiel\u2019s last husband was Cuban video technician Antonio Hern\u00e1ndez, 36 years her junior, with whom she tied the knot in late 2002. As further proof of the dangers of heterosexual unions, that marriage reportedly lasted 10 days, though divorce would be finalized only in early 2005. \u201cMy one big mistake was marrying Antonio Hern\u00e1ndez,\u201d Montiel later admitted. \u201cIt was a catastrophe. I really regret it.\u201d\n\nMontiel had a longer union with businessman and journalist Pepe Tous: from 1979 to his death in 1992. Along the way, the couple adopted two children.\n\nSupposed Sara Montiel lovers \u2013 she drops names in her autobiographies \u2013 ranged from frequent co-star Maurice Ronet and James Dean (whom she met while he was starring in George Stevens\u2019 Giant) to Ernest Hemingway and Nobel Prize in Medicine winner Severo Ochoa, in addition to Esa mujer director Mario Camus, poet Le\u00f3n Felipe, and playwright and screenwriter Miguel Mihura (Welcome Mr. Marshall!). Well-publicized romances included those with co-star Giancarlo del Duca (La mujer perdida, The Woman from Beirut) and La bella Lola cinematographer Mario Montuori.\n\nMontiel\u2019s first autobiographical tome, A Whole Life, was published in 2000. A sequel, Living Is a Pleasure, came out three years later. (Note: According to a handful of sources, Montiel\u2019s first autobiography was called Memories: To Live Is a Pleasure, followed by Sara and Sex in 2003.)\n\nRegarding today\u2019s movie celebrities, Montiel told El Mundo in 2009: \u201cThe stars are gone. In the past, they were surrounded by mystery, they weren\u2019t as exposed as they are today. Fifty years have passed, and I\u2019m still waiting for the appearance of someone else like me.\u201d\n\nSara Montiel death follows those of Jes\u00fas Franco and Bigas Luna\n\nThe death of Sara Montiel \u2013 11 years to the day of the death of another Spanish-speaking film legend, the Mexican Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix \u2013 follows those of two other renowned Spanish cinema figures: filmmakers Jes\u00fas Franco and Bigas Luna, both of whom passed away in the last week.\n\nMontiel\u2019s death was also accompanied by the passings of two other international female celebrities: Beach Party movies\u2019 actress Annette Funicello and right-wing British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, played by Meryl Streep in Phyllida Lloyd\u2019s The Iron Lady \u2013 a performance that earned Streep her third Academy Award.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, Sara Montiel\u2019s quotes via the Buenos Aires Herald.\n\nListen to Sara Montiel singing \u201cAmado m\u00edo\u201d below."}], "Sara Montiel was a Spanish singer": [{"url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/04/08/176592042/la-gran-diva-remembering-sara-montiel", "page_content": "\"Her eyes are still the kind of dark chocolate that cannot be refused.\n\nThey have melted for a legion of leading men.

Initially, the songs in the film were going to be sung by a professional singer who would dub Montiel, but due to the low budget, she eventually sang the songs herself. The film soundtrack album also became a hit.\n\nFollowing this success, in June 1957 she signed with producer Benito Perojo a lavish contract to make four films in three years, being the first of them The Violet Seller, a 1958 large-budget international co-production musical film. The economic agreement was ten million pesetas (US$240,000 as of 1957) for four films, which means that she was to receive 2.5 million pesetas (US$60,000) per film, making her the highest-paid Spanish star at a time when the highest-paid stars were netting one million pesetas (US$24,000) per film. The success of The Violet Seller surp*ed that of The Last Torch Song, and in a contractual dispute for the next film, A Girl Against Napoleon (1959), the agreement was improved by securing for her the twenty per cent of the producer's net revenue. She also signed a contract with Hispavox to record and release the soundtrack albums of her films for which she netted the ten per cent of the records sale as royalties. The Violet Seller soundtrack album, the first with them, topped sales in Spain and in Latin America and, in July 1959, Hispavox served a Golden Disk award to her for the number of records sold there.\n\nAll this made her a film and singing international superstar. Almost all of her next films earned high box office results and she combined filming, recording songs and performing live. She was the highest paid star of Spanish cinema, and many years later, she began to say that she had been paid more than US$1 million for each of these films, something that the press widely reported as the actual figure. Among the next films during the 1960s and early 1970s were My Last Tango (1960), Pecado de amor (1961), The Lovely Lola (a 1962 version of La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias), Casablanca, Nest of Spies (1963), Samba (1964), The Lost Woman (1966), Tuset Street (1967), Esa Mujer (1969) and Variety (1971). The film Variety was banned in Beijing in 1973.\n\nIn 1974, she announced her retirement from movies, as she become dissatisfied with the movie industry and the overt nudity in films, but continued performing live, recording and starring on her own variety television shows in Spain. In 2002 she was the advertising image of the MTV Europe Music Awards held in Barcelona.\n\nIn November 2009, singer Alaska who forms the Spanish pop group Fangoria with Nacho Canut, invited Montiel to record a track sharing vocals with her for the re-release of the band's album Absolutamente. They recorded the *le track \"Absolutamente\" as a duet. The music video for the song was released on 18 December 2009. Well into her eighties, she had no plans to retire, and continued working in various projects. In May 2011, after almost forty years without making a movie, she performed in a feature film directed by \u00d3scar Parra de Carrizosa. The film *le is Abr\u00e1zame and was shot on location in La Mancha.\n\nShe is considered \"one of the most important actresses in the history of Spain\", and has been described by Spain's press as a \"myth of Spanish cinema.\" She has also been characterized as \"the most beautiful woman of twentieth century Spain.\" She has also been called a \"sexual, feminist, and gay icon for Francoist Spain.\"\n\nPersonal information\n\nMonument to Montiel in Campo de Criptana.\n\nMontiel, whose complete name was Mar\u00eda Antonia Alejandra Vicenta Elpidia Isidora Abad Fern\u00e1ndez, was born in 1928 in Campo de Criptana (Ciudad Real), Spain. She entered films after winning a talent contest at age fifteen. In her first movie, she was credited as \"Mar\u00eda Alejandra\" a shortened version of her real name. For her next film, she changed her name to Sara, after her grandmother, and Montiel after the Montiel fields in La Mancha region of her birth. It was in Mexico where she first learned how to read and write, taught by the poet Le\u00f3n Felipe, and in 1951 she acquired Mexican dual nationality.

A sequel Sara and Sex followed in 2003. In these books, she revealed other relationships in her past, including one-night stands with writer Ernest Hemingway as well as actor James Dean. She also claimed a long-term affair in the 1940s with playwright Miguel Mihura and mentioned that science wizard Severo Ochoa, a Nobel Prize winner, was the true love of her life.\n\nIn her later years, she became an iconic figure to the gay community, and noted \"Cuando voy a actuar a alguna ciudad de EE UU all\u00ed est\u00e1n todos los gays de la ciudad\" (Whenever I perform in any city in the US, all the gays from that city show up). Montiel died in 2013 at her home in Madrid at the age of eighty-five from congestive heart failure, and was buried in the San Justo Cemetery in Madrid.\n\nFilmography\n\nDiscography\n\nSara Montiel en Mexico\n\nCanciones de la Pel\u00edcula \"El \u00daltimo Cuple\" - Spain: Columbia.

She was 85.\n\nHer biographer, Peter Villora, said Montiel died at her home in Madrid after passing out. \u201cShe was both an actress and singer, but mainly an actress, fulfilling the dream of her life,\u201d Villora said.\n\nMontiel was born Maria Antonia Abad in Campo de Criptana in the central region of La Mancha. An acknowledged beauty with an almost husky singing voice, Montiel starred in more than 50 films, many of which were musicals.\n\nShe married Anthony Mann, an American actor and film director, in 1957. But press reports, which Montiel never denied, claimed she had turbulent affairs with author Ernest Hemingway and actor James Dean.\n\nShe became known for smoking Havana cigars on stage while singing, something that was at the time associated mostly with men. Montiel said it was Hemingway who taught her to smoke.\n\nAfter limited success in Spain, her career took off in Mexico in the late 1940s where she featured in successful Spanish language films such as \u201cCarcel de Mujeres\u201d (Women\u2019s Prison).\n\nFrom there she made the leap to Hollywood, where she soon attracted the attention of actors and directors. She played a supporting role in the legendary 1955 western \u201cVera Cruz\u201d alongside actors Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster.\n\nHer second U.S. film was the musical \u201cSerenade,\u201d with tenor Mario Lanza and Joan Fontaine and Vincent Price as stars.\n\n\u201cShe was the Spanish star with the greatest international impact until the arrival of Javier (Bardem) and Penelope (Cruz),\u201d Spanish actor Jose Sacristan said.\n\nHaving found success in Mexico and the U.S., Montiel then earned star status in her native Spain with 1957\u2032s \u201cEl Ultimo Cuple\u201d (The Last Couplet), which became one of the highest grossing movies in Spanish cinema history.\n\nThe fee for her next film, \u201cLa Violetera\u201d (The Violet Seller) netted Montiel more than $1 million, something unheard of for a Spanish star in those days.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Montiel gave up film work and dedicated herself to live musicals on stage and television.\n\nMontiel is survived by her daughter Thais and son Zeus.\n\n___\n\nJorge Sainz in Madrid contributed to this obituary."}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/sara-montiel/", "page_content": "Sara Montiel (also Sarita Montiel or Sarit\u00edsima; 10 March 1928 \u2013 8 April 2013) was a Spanish singer and actress.

Hollywood came calling afterwards, and she was introduced to United States moviegoers in the film Vera Cruz (1954) co-starring with Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster, and directed by Robert Aldrich. She was offered the standard seven-year contract at Columbia Pictures, which she refused, afraid of Hollywood's typecasting policies for Hispanics.
