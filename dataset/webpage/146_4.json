Soon after , she debuts at Bolero saloon , where finds him again and Soledad and Fernando fall in love but their social backgrounds , -he's higher class , she's lower class- , threatens the relationship . Fernando is under usual pressure from his older brother Alfonso (Tom\u00e1s Blanco) who reminds him of his duties as a diplomatic , including his marriage engagement to a countess (Ana Mariscal) . But then , there takes place a tragedy , in which Fernando, feeling devastated and guilty breaks their loving relationship . Later on , she meets Henri Barnard (Frank Villard) promoter who offers her a successful career as a famous singer . The passionate , impulsive Soledad flees from Spain and triumphs as a popular singer in Paris and other European countries . Soledad's peculiar character becomes her the victim and protagonist of a fatalistic chain of extraordinary deeds and turbulent loves .\n\n\n\nEnjoyable but simple melodrama in which we are destined to be the witnesses of a story of passion , jealousy and a twisted love story between two different characters who carry out their plans disregarding all social conventions and scandalizing high society . Agreeable update film based on a story by Manuel Villegas L\u00f3pez with script by Jes\u00fas Maria Arozamena , adding the typical Spanish clich\u00e9s , romances and a lot of popular songs (15) sung by Saritisima . The story is extremely melodramatic and plenty of songs , musical spectacle and colorful scenarios . Luis Cesar Amadori brilliantly casts one of the best Spanish actress of the epoch , Sara Montiel , to play Soledad in the kind of steamy role she revels in , and with one of the most known actors in Latino Cinema , Raf Vallone , as an aristocrat who decides to put an end to their loving affair .\n\n\n\nSara Montiel is frankly well as one very highly sensual young as well as heartbreaking singer , making lavish utilization of her considerable physical assets , attractive countenance , charms and whatever acting ability was necessary , Sara made her Soledad Moreno the most gorgeous , heartless and hot-blooded screen heroine of the Spanish cinema .

Here the craftsman Luis Cesar Amadori blends dramatic events along with popular songs . Amadori was an Italian-born former journalist and music critic who became a leading stage producer and dramatist , and , subsequently, writer-director of motion pictures in Argentina . Luis was manager in 150 theatrical spectacles . He debuts in \u00a8Puerto Nuevo\u00a8(1936) co-directed by Mario Soffici .

Sarita Montiel a.k.a. Saritisima, one of the Spanish-speaking world\u2019s biggest film and recording stars, died yesterday, April 8. Montiel, who was found dead by paramedics called to her house in Madrid\u2019s district of Salamanca, was 85. Earlier today, a funeral procession through the streets of Madrid was witnessed (and applauded) by thousands of fans.\n\nSara Montiel was born \u2013 if online sources are to be believed \u2013 Mar\u00eda Antonia Alejandra Vicenta Elpidia Isadora Abad Fern\u00e1ndez to a small farmer and a beauty products saleswoman on March 10, 1928. She left behind her poverty-stricken childhood, during which she spent her days dreaming of film star Imperio Argentina, after moving to post-Civil War Madrid in her mid-teens.\n\nFollowing diction and singing lessons, her film career took off after she landed roles in two 1944 releases: a supporting turn \u2013 billed as Maria Alejandra \u2013 in Ladislao Vajda\u2019s Te quiero para m\u00ed (\u201cI Want You for Me\u201d) and, as Sara Montiel, the young female lead in Raffaello Matarazzo\u2019s comedy about in-laws vs. marriage bliss, Empez\u00f3 en boda (\u201cIt Started at the Wedding\u201d).\n\nEarly Spanish career and her Mexican films\n\nBy the early \u201950s, Sara Montiel had become a well-known name in Spanish-language cinema. In Spain, her roles included those of Don Quixote\u2019s daughter Antonia in Rafael Gil\u2019s Don Quijote de la Mancha (1947), with Rafael Rivelles in the title role and future Luis Bu\u00f1uel collaborator Fernando Rey as Sans\u00f3n Carrasco; and the scheming Muslim princess Aldara in Juan de Ordu\u00f1a\u2019s nationalistic historical melodrama Locura de amor / The Mad Queen (1948), supporting Aurora Bautista as the Spanish queen \u201cJuana la Loca\u201d and Fernando Rey as her husband Felipe.\n\nFollowing a move across the Atlantic, Sara Montiel would star in about a dozen features for the booming Mexican film industry, most notably Miguel M. Delgado\u2019s (possibly Caged-inspired) women-behind-bars melodrama C\u00e1rcel de mujeres (\u201cWomen\u2019s Prison,\u201d 1951), opposite two other Mexican cinema icons, Miroslava and Katy Jurado \u2013 Miroslava and Montiel are enemy inmates in the film, with the former as a widow accused of having murdered her husband, whose lover was the vengeful Montiel; Miguel Morayta\u2019s Ella, Lucifer y yo (\u201cShe, Lucifer and Me,\u201d 1953), in which Abel Salazar makes a pact with the devil (Carlos L\u00f3pez Moctezuma) so luscious singer Montiel will fall in love with him; and Miguel Zacar\u00edas\u2019 Necesito dinero (\u201cI Need Money\u201d), co-starring superstar Pedro Infante as another man doing whatever it takes to gain Montiel\u2019s affection.\n\nSarita Montiel in Hollywood\n\nFor Hollywood studios, Sara Montiel, billed as Sarita Montiel, was featured in what amounted to a supporting role in Robert Aldrich\u2019s successful Mexican-set Western Vera Cruz (1954), starring Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster (and with Denise Darcel as the female lead); Anthony Mann\u2019s poorly received romantic melodrama Serenade (1956), in which singer Mario Lanza is torn between American society dame Joan Fontaine and Mexican wife Montiel; and Samuel Fuller\u2019s post-Civil War Western Run of the Arrow (1957), as a Sioux Indian named Yellow Moccasin (and reportedly voiced by Angie Dickinson) who ends up as U.S. soldier Rod Steiger\u2019s wife.\n\nAccording to online sources, at that time Columbia\u2019s Harry Cohn offered Montiel a seven-year contract, which the actress turned down because she didn\u2019t want to be typecast as Mexican spitfires and Yellow Moccasins in Hollywood movies. Be that as it may, Montiel did accept another kind of Hollywood offer: She and her Serenade director Anthony Mann were married in 1957.\n\nAlso in the \u201950s, Sara Montiel acquired Mexican citizenship. \u201cMexico is my home away from home,\u201d she would remark in a 2007 interview in Miami. \u201cWhen I arrived in Mexico in 1950 all doors were soon thrown open to me, I have great memories from those years.\u201d\n\nOn its home page, the Mexican Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences features an official announcement mourning Sara Montiel\u2019s passing.\n\nSuperstardom\n\n\u201cHollywood was not very kind to me, may be out of envy \u2026 I was an intruder in that world,\u201d Sara Montiel would later say.\n\nFollowing her brief Hollywood stint, Montiel could have resumed her career in Mexico, but at that time she received a good offer from her native country.\n\nSara Montiel became an international superstar following the unexpected success of Juan de Ordu\u00f1a\u2019s El \u00faltimo cupl\u00e9 / The Last Torch Song (1957), co-written by Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda de Arozamena (who would write many of Montiel\u2019s biggest movie hits) and Antonio Mas Guindal.\n\nSharing elements in common with Joseph L. Mankiewicz\u2019s The Barefoot Contessa (1954), the low-budget The Last Torch Song stars Montiel as cabaret singer Mar\u00eda Luj\u00e1n, who finds professional success as a singing star but whose private life is burdened by tragedy.\n\n\u201cAlmost no one had any confidence in that project,\u201d Montiel would recall about The Last Torch Song, which, much like the Mexican melodramas of the period, was a throwback to Hollywood fare of the \u201920s and \u201930s, with Montiel bringing back to life characters played decades earlier by Kay Francis, Corinne Griffith, Ann Harding, Ruth Chatterton, Irene Dunne, Gloria Swanson, and Barbara Stanwyck.\n\n\u201cWhen El \u00faltimo cupl\u00e9 premiered,\u201d Montiel would later recall, \u201cI got to know what success really meant. It was what I wanted, to move the audiences, the masses.\u201d The Last Torch Song reportedly became one of Spain\u2019s biggest blockbusters in history.\n\nSara Montiel movies: La Violetera Sara Montiel movies: La Violetera\n\nNext in line for the sultry, husky-voice actress was another tear-jerking blockbuster: Luis C\u00e9sar Amadori\u2019s La Violetera (\u201cThe Violet Peddler,\u201d 1958), for which Montiel reportedly (if somewhat dubiously) earned US$1 million. In this romantic musical melodrama, Montiel plays Soledad Moreno, a flower seller in turn-of-the-century Madrid who falls in love with an aristocrat (Raf Vallone). Inevitably, class issues arise. The heartbroken Soledad flees Spain for France, where she becomes (once again) a singing sensation. Tears, tantrums, the sinking of the Titanic, psychological trauma, and eternal love ensue. (Image: The sensual Sara Montiel strikes a Gina Lollobrigida-like pose.)\n\n\u201cLa violetera was even bigger than El \u00faltimo cupl\u00e9,\u201d Montiel affirmed. \u201cThat\u2019s when I became fully aware that I was born to become a movie star.\u201d And a recording star as well, as \u201cLa Violetera\u201d was a major seller worldwide, eventually becoming her trademark song.\n\nAmong Sara Montiel\u2019s other personal successes of the late \u201950s and \u201960s were Tulio Demicheli\u2019s Carmen la de Ronda / A Girl Against Napoleon (1959), based on Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e\u2019s novel and co-starring Jorge Mistral and Maurice Ronet; Mi \u00faltimo tango (\u201cMy Last Tango,\u201d 1960), about a maid who inadvertently becomes a tango-singing sensation in Argentina, also co-starring Ronet and directed by La Violetera\u2018s Luis C\u00e9sar Amadori; and Amadori\u2019s Pecado de amor (\u201cSin of Love,\u201d 1961), as a former singing star (Magda Beltr\u00e1n) who becomes a nun (Sister Bel\u00e9n) to atone for her past sins.\n\nHanding \u2018El Cid\u2019 to Sophia Loren\n\nSara Montiel claimed to have turned down the female lead role in husband Anthony Mann\u2019s Spanish-set historical epic El Cid (1961), starring Charlton Heston, recommending the Italian Sophia Loren in her place. El Cid turned out to be a major international hit.\n\nInstead of El Cid, Montiel, whose marriage to Mann would end in divorce in 1963, was seen in Alfonso Balc\u00e1zar\u2019s La bella Lola (1962), a version of Camille co-starring Antonio Cifariello and Franck Villard (in place of Montiel\u2019s original choice, Roger Moore); Rafael Gil\u2019s World War I-set espionage melodrama La reina del Chantecler (\u201cThe Queen of the Chantecler,\u201d 1962), in which Montiel falls for no-good journalist and spy Alberto de Mendoza (among whose spying buddies is Greta Chi\u2019s Mata Hari); and Henri Decoin\u2019s Casablanca, Nest of Spies / Noches de Casablanca (1963), featuring another set of spies, Maurice Ronet, and Fabio Fabrizi. (This film\u2019s French-language title inspired the title, though not necessarily the plot, of the Michel Hazanavicius / Jean Dujardin spoof OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies.)\n\nIn Rafael Gil\u2019s Samba (1965), Sara Montiel plays no less than two (Spanish-speaking) Brazilians: an actress who gets bumped off by her lover and her dead-ringer slum dweller, who, during the course of the film, finds love, intrigue, (rumba-sounding) samba singing, Carnival dancing, and the smuggling of precious stones.\n\n\u2018Esa Mujer\u2019: Pedro Almod\u00f3var inspiration\n\nMario Camus directed Esa mujer (\u201cThis Woman,\u201d 1969), a sort of The Nun\u2019s Story meets Madame X meets Sarah and Son (a 1930 mother love melodrama that earned Ruth Chatterton a Best Actress Academy Award nomination). In Esa mujer, Montiel plays Soledad Romero Fuentes, a missionary nun who gets raped, becomes pregnant, abandons her convent, becomes a singing sensation, falls in love with a man who turns out to be her (long-thought-dead) daughter\u2019s lover, and is ultimately accused of murder. And that\u2019s only part of the plot.\n\nFast-forward to 1983 and inveterate Sara Montiel fan Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s unusual look at life in a convent, Dark Habits / Entre tinieblas, and to 1999 and Almod\u00f3var\u2019s Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award winner All About My Mother, which features Pen\u00e9lope Cruz as a pregnant nun whose \u201cfather of the child\u201d is a transvestite named Lola who also happens to be dying of AIDS.\n\nFive years after All About My Mother, Almod\u00f3var paid direct homage to his idol in the brilliant Bad Education (2004). For starters, Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal sings \u201cQuiz\u00e1s, quiz\u00e1s, quiz\u00e1s\u201d by mimicking Montiel in Casablanca, Nest of Spies. Additionally, Bad Education features its two schoolboy-lovers masturbating one another while watching Montiel in Esa mujer on the big screen.\n\nSara Montiel: Last movies, stage, and television work Sara Montiel: Last movies, stage, and television work\n\nSara Montiel\u2019s last prestigious star vehicle was Juan Antonio Bardem\u2019s Variet\u00e9s (1971), in which she plays an aging actress who still dreams of becoming a star. The middle-aged hopeful eventually gets her chance, but success turns out to be ephemeral.\n\nBy that time, after one formulaic musical melodrama after another, Sara Montiel\u2019s movie-star appeal had been drastically reduced. Refusing to take part in Spain\u2019s then-burgeoning cine del destape \u2013 post-Franco softcore comedies \u2013 Montiel left films following the release of Pedro Lazaga\u2019s comedy Cinco almohadas para una noche (\u201cFive Cushions for One Night,\u201d 1974) \u2013 though she would also be seen the following year in Eduardo Manzanos Brochero\u2019s That\u2019s Entertainment-like compilation feature Canciones de nuestra vida (\u201cSongs of Our Lives\u201d).\n\nThirty-six years later, Montiel would return to the big screen one last time, playing (a parody of) herself in Oscar Parra de Carrizosa\u2019s Abr\u00e1zame (\u201cHug Me,\u201d 2011).\n\nMontiel would later lament that she (unlike Pola Negri, Bette Davis, Elisabeth Bergner, Jeanne Moreau, Marlene Dietrich, Viveca Lindfors, and Tallulah Bankhead) never got to play Catherine the Great. And even though she retired from films right when the fascistic government of Francisco Franco was in its death throes, Montiel also bemoaned the fact that she didn\u2019t have the chance to work with top-quality screenwriters unhindered by Franco\u2019s reactionary right-wing censors.\n\nAs her film career came to a halt, Montiel began focusing on her stage and concert shows. According to online sources, among her live successes, at times smoking a cigar between numbers, were Saritisima \u2013 though Montiel claimed she liked neither the nickname \u201cSaritisima\u201d nor \u201cSarita\u201d \u2013 and Increible Sara (obviously in reference to \u201cThe Incredible Sarah [Bernhardt]\u201d). Her trademark songs included the perennial \u201cLa violetera,\u201d in addition to \u201cB\u00e9same mucho,\u201d \u201cFumando Espero\u201d (\u201cSmoking, I Wait [for the man I love\u2026]\u201d), and the Spanish-language version of \u201cAmado m\u00edo\u201d (performed by Rita Hayworth, with Anita Ellis\u2019 voice, in Charles Vidor\u2019s Gilda). [Please scroll down to listen to Sara Montiel\u2019s husky rendition of \u201cAmado m\u00edo.\u201d]\n\nOn television, Sara Montiel was the star of the miniseries Sara y Punto (1990) and the variety show Ven al Paralelo (1992). She continued recording songs and appearing on several TV shows until the 2000s, most recently in Entrevista a la carta in 2012.\n\nCuriously, Montiel never received an Honorary Goya from the Spanish Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. She did, however, win two Best Actress awards from Spain\u2019s Cinema Writers Circle: for The Last Torch Song and La Violetera.\n\nHusbands and lovers\n\nFollowing her divorce from Anthony Mann, Sara Montiel would marry three more times, including a de facto two-month union with businessman Jos\u00e9 Vicente Ram\u00edrez Olalla in 1964. The marriage would be officially annulled in 1978.\n\nMontiel\u2019s last husband was Cuban video technician Antonio Hern\u00e1ndez, 36 years her junior, with whom she tied the knot in late 2002. As further proof of the dangers of heterosexual unions, that marriage reportedly lasted 10 days, though divorce would be finalized only in early 2005. \u201cMy one big mistake was marrying Antonio Hern\u00e1ndez,\u201d Montiel later admitted. \u201cIt was a catastrophe. I really regret it.\u201d\n\nMontiel had a longer union with businessman and journalist Pepe Tous: from 1979 to his death in 1992. Along the way, the couple adopted two children.\n\nSupposed Sara Montiel lovers \u2013 she drops names in her autobiographies \u2013 ranged from frequent co-star Maurice Ronet and James Dean (whom she met while he was starring in George Stevens\u2019 Giant) to Ernest Hemingway and Nobel Prize in Medicine winner Severo Ochoa, in addition to Esa mujer director Mario Camus, poet Le\u00f3n Felipe, and playwright and screenwriter Miguel Mihura (Welcome Mr. Marshall!). Well-publicized romances included those with co-star Giancarlo del Duca (La mujer perdida, The Woman from Beirut) and La bella Lola cinematographer Mario Montuori.\n\nMontiel\u2019s first autobiographical tome, A Whole Life, was published in 2000. A sequel, Living Is a Pleasure, came out three years later.

She is still a much-loved and internationally known name in the Spanish-speaking movie and music industries.\n\nMontiel was born in Campo de Criptana in the region of Castile\u2013La Mancha in 1928 as Mar\u00eda Antonia Abad (complete name Mar\u00eda Antonia Alejandra Vicenta Elpidia Isidora Abad Fern\u00e1ndez). After her unprecedented international hit in Juan de Ordu\u00f1a's El \u00daltimo Cupl\u00e9 in 1957, Montiel achieved the status of mega-star in Europe and Latin America. She was the first woman to distill sex openly in Spanish cinema at a time when even a low cut dress was not acceptable.\n\nMontiel was the most commercially successful Spanish actress during the mid-20th century in much of the world. Miss Montiel's film Varietes was banned in Beijing in 1973. Her films El \u00daltimo Cuple and La Violetera netted the highest gross revenues ever recorded for films made in the Spanish speaking movie industry during the 1950s and 1960s. She also played the role of Antonia, the niece of Don Quixote, in the 1947 Spanish film version of Cervantes's great novel.\n\nShe was portrayed in the Pedro Almod\u00f3var film Bad Education by a male actor in drag (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) as the transsexual character Zahara, and a film clip from one of her movies was used as well.\n\nActing career\n\nMontiel started in movies at 16 in her native Spain where she filmed her first international success playing an Islamic princess in the 1948 film Locura de Amor, released in the US as The Mad Queen. Later she conquered Mexico, starring in a dozen films in less than five years. Hollywood came calling afterwards, and she was introduced to United States moviegoers in the film Vera Cruz (1954) co-starring with Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster, and directed by Robert Aldrich. She was offered the standard seven-year contract at Columbia Pictures, which she quickly refused, afraid of Hollywood's typecasting policies for Hispanics. Instead she free-lanced at Warner Bros. with Mario Lanza and Joan Fontaine in Serenade (1956), directed by Anthony Mann, and at RKO in Samuel Fuller's Run of the Arrow (1957), opposite Rod Steiger and Charles Bronson.\n\nThe unexpected success of El Ultimo Cuple (1957) turned her into an overnight sensation both as an actor and a singer. From then on she combined filming highly successful vehicles, recording songs in five languages and performing live all over the world. Among the films that kept her immensely popular during the 1960s and early 1970s were La Violetera (1958), Carmen, la de Ronda (1959), Mi Ultimo Tango (1960), Pecado de Amor (1961), La Bella Lola (a 1962 version of Camille), Casablanca, Nid d'espions(1963), Samba (1964), La Femme Perdue (1966), Tuset Street (1967), Esa Mujer (1969), Varietes (1971) and others. By then she had become a legend to her millions of fans but became dissatisfied with the movie industry when producers started offering her roles in soft core porno films. In 1974 Montiel announced her retirement from movies but continued performing live, recording and starring on her own variety television shows in Spain. Currently she remains one of the highest paid celebrities in Spain's TV talk and reality shows.\n\nIn November 2009, Alaska from the pop group Fangoria invited Montiel to record a track sharing vocals with her for the re-release of the band's album Absolutamente. They recorded the title track \"Absolutamente\" as a duet and when the single was released it became an instant Top 10 hit. The music video for the song was also highly successful when released in early 2010. Sara has no retirement plans and in May 2011, after almost 40 years without making a movie, she accepted to appear in a feature film directed by \u00d3scar Parra de Carrizosa. The film title is Abr\u00e1zame and it was shot on location in Montiel's birthplace in La Mancha. According to the star, in this film she dares to do \"a parody of her old screen image, just for fun.\"\n\nPersonal information\n\nMontiel was born Maria Antonia Alejandra Abad Fern\u00e1ndez (March 10, 1928 - April 8, 2013) in Campo de Criptana in the province of Ciudad Real, Spain. She entered films after winning a beauty and talent contest at age 15. In her first movie she was credited as \"Maria Alejandra\" a shortened version of her real name. For her next film she changed her name to Sara, after her grandmother, and Montiel after the Montiel fields in the Castile\u2013La Mancha region of her birth. She has been married four times:\n\nAnthony Mann (American, Actor & Film Director) In Beverly Hills, California 1957-1963 (divorced)\n\nJos\u00e9 Vicente Ram\u00edrez Olalla (Industrial Attorney) Rome, Italy 1964-1978 (annulled)\n\nJos\u00e9 Tous Barber\u00e1n (Attorney-Journalist) Palma de Mallorca, Spain 1979-1992 (Tous's death)\n\nAntonio Hern\u00e1ndez (Cuban Videotape Operator) Madrid, Spain 2002-2005 (divorced)\n\nThis marriage produced two adopted children: Thais (born 1979) Zeus (born 1982)\n\nDuring the Francisco Franco dictatorship, Spanish stars were forbidden to behave in any way that could be perceived at odds with Christian principles and morality, consequently they kept their private lives very private. Montiel was no exception. Pre-marital or out of wedlock relationships were never mentioned and her civil marriage to Anthony Mann was underplayed along with the divorce.\n\nHer 1964 Catholic wedding in Rome was granted great publicity but no one was informed that the marriage only lasted a couple of months. By 1965, the couple had separated and Montiel had started a very secret love affair with Italian actor Giancarlo del Duca (aka Giancarlo Viola) It was all kept under wraps since divorce was illegal in both Italy and Spain.\n\nIn 1970, Sara broke up with Giancarlo and started a long-term relationship with Jos\u00e9 Tous. By the mid 1970s, censorship in Spain was abolished and the truth began coming out. Montiel requested an annulment of her second marriage and the Catholic Church granted it in 1978. The following year, she married Tous in a civil ceremony and the marriage lasted until his death of cancer in 1992.\n\nBy 1993, Sara was involved again with Giancarlo Viola. In 2002, the couple parted, and Montiel married a much younger man who resided in Cuba, a union that was doomed from the start and ended in divorce in 2004. Soon after, Viola was back in Montiel's life, and they seem committed to each other in spite of the fact that Montiel lives in Madrid and her partner remains in Italy.\n\nIn 2000, Montiel published her autobiography \"Memories: To Live Is A Pleasure\", an instant best seller with ten editions to date. A sequel \"Sara and Sex\" followed in 2003. In these books Montiel revealed other relationships in her past including one-night stands with writer Ernest Hemingway as well as actor James Dean. She also claimed a long term affair in the 1940s with playwright Miguel Mihura and mentioned that science wizard Severo Ochoa, a Nobel Prize winner, was the true love of her life.\n\nFilmography\n\nTe Quiero para Mi \u2013 1944 (credited as \"Maria Alejandra\")\n\n\u2013 1944 (credited as \"Maria Alejandra\") Empez\u00f3 en Boda \u2013 1944\n\n\u2013 1944 Bambu \u2013 1945\n\n\u2013 1945 Se Le Fue el Novio \u2013 1945\n\n\u2013 1945 El Misterioso Viajero del Clipper \u2013 1946\n\n\u2013 1946 Por El Gran premio \u2013 1946\n\n\u2013 1946 Vidas Confusas \u2013 1947\n\n\u2013 1947 Confidencia \u2013 1947\n\n\u2013 1947 Mariona Rebull \u2013 1947\n\n\u2013 1947 Don Quijote de la Mancha ( Don Quixote in the U.S.) \u2013 1947 (released in the US in 1949)\n\n( in the U.S.) \u2013 1947 (released in the US in 1949) Alhucemas \u2013 1948\n\n\u2013 1948 Locura de amor ( The Mad Queen in the U.S.) \u2013 1949\n\n( in the U.S.) \u2013 1949 La Mies es Mucha \u2013 1949\n\n\u2013 1949 Peque\u00f1eces \u2013 1950\n\n\u2013 1950 That Man from Tangier \u2013 1950 (released in the US 1953)\n\n\u2013 1950 (released in the US 1953) Furia Roja \u2013 1950 (English version: Stronghold with Veronica Lake in the Montiel part)\n\n\u2013 1950 (English version: with Veronica Lake in the Montiel part) C\u00e1rcel de mujeres \u2013 1951\n\n\u2013 1951 Ah\u00ed viene Mart\u00edn Corona \u2013 1951\n\n\u2013 1951 El Enamorado \u2013 1951\n\n\u2013 1951 Ella, Lucifer y Yo \u2013 1952\n\n\u2013 1952 Yo Soy Gallo Dondequiera \u2013 1952\n\n\u2013 1952 Piel Canela \u2013 1953\n\n\u2013 1953 Porque Ya No Me Quieres \u2013 1953\n\n\u2013 1953 Se Solicitan Modelos \u2013 1954\n\n\u2013 1954 Frente Al Pecado De Ayer \u2013 1954\n\n\u2013 1954 Yo No Creo en Los Hombres \u2013 1954\n\n\u2013 1954 Vera Cruz \u2013 1954\n\n\u2013 1954 Donde el c\u00edrculo termina \u2013 1955 ( Circle of Death in the U.S.)\n\n\u2013 1955 ( in the U.S.) Serenade \u2013 1956\n\n\u2013 1956 Run of the Arrow \u2013 1957\n\n\u2013 1957 El \u00faltimo cupl\u00e9 \u2013 1957\n\n\u2013 1957 La Violetera \u2013 1958\n\n\u2013 1958 Carmen la de Ronda ( The Devil Made a Woman in the US and UK.) \u2013 1958\n\n( in the US and UK.) \u2013 1958 Mi \u00daltimo Tango \u2013 1960\n\n\u2013 1960 Pecado de Amor \u2013 1961\n\n\u2013 1961 La Reina Del Chantecler \u2013 1962\n\nLa Bella Lola \u2013 1962\n\n\u2013 1962 Noches De Casablanca \u2013 1963\n\n\u2013 1963 Samba \u2013 1964\n\n\u2013 1964 La Dama de Beirut \u2013 1965\n\n\u2013 1965 La Mujer Perdida \u2013 1966\n\n\u2013 1966 Tuset Street \u2013 1967\n\n\u2013 1967 Esa Mujer \u2013 1969\n\n\u2013 1969 Variet\u00e9s \u2013 1971\n\n\u2013 1971 Cinco Almohadas para una Noche \u2013 1973\n\n\u2013 1973 Asaltar los Cielos (documental \u2013 1996) As herself.\n\n(documental \u2013 1996) As herself.

In the movie she was the first woman to display a low cleavage openly in Spanish cinema at a time when even a low cut dress was not acceptable. The cover for the album of the same title was censored. This film made her unexpectedly the number one actress-singer of that year in Europe and Latin America and she accepted a multi-million dollar offer for more films and recordings in Europe. Fifteen films followed her Cupl\u00e9 success, including 'La violetera' (1958), 'Mi ultimo tango' (1960), 'Noches de Casablanca' (a 1963 tribute to Hollywood's 'Casablanca'), 'Esa mujer' (1969) and 'Variet\u00e9s' (1971). Her films 'El ultimo cuple' and 'La violetera' netted the highest gross revenues ever recorded for films made in the Spanish speaking movie industry during the 50s and 60s.\n\nMost of the movies were accompanied by a soundtrack album which also pushed her career as a singer. During these years she recorded over 30 albums and appeared on stage and television all over the world. In 1974 Montiel announced her retirement from movies and continued non-stop performing live, recording and starring on her own variety television shows in Spain. She continued at that pace well into the 1990s. In 2000 she released her autobiography Memories: 'To live is a pleasure' followed by a second book called 'Sara and sex', which highlighted her love life. In 2005 Montiel was portrayed in the Pedro Almod\u00f3var film 'La mala educaci\u00f3n' by actor Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal as the character Zahara. In 2006 Montiel temporarily put aside her career in order to help her adopted son Zeus with his first recordings. Sarita died at the age of 85 on april 8, 2013.\n\nOn the web:\n\n- http://infomontiel.tripod.com/id17.htm\n\n- http://www.visitingsaramontiel.com\n\nIf you like this, you probably like... / european counterparts:\n\n\n\nWhat do we think:\n\nPR: Sarita Montiel is more actress than singer. But with an oeuvre of more than 30 albums since the late fifties, she is definitely one of Spain's most popular musical artists of the 20th century. And - whatever you may think of her - she still succeeds in claiming a spot in the limelights with her writings. Her material is mostly very traditional Hollywood-with-Spanish-lyrics and her singing is not tremendous. On the other hand, she sung a few beautiful songs that became international classics ('La violetra'). Her latest releases (eigthies & nineties) are over-the-top synthesiser disco albums, probably recorded for the gay-disco's and her die-hard fans.\n\nDB: Everyone who has seen Almodov\u00e1r's 'La mala educaci\u00f3n' will remember transvestite Sahara miming a warmblooded song in the microphone. Well, i do, and it was my first encounter with the music of Sarita, the singer Sahara is impersonating. While in Barcelona I tried to find as much of her orginal material i could lay my hands on including an autographed copy of Ulitmo Cuple (no, not the one with the revealing cover). Sarita made some great music but maybe suffers from some over confidence.

The artist, who started acting at age 16, appeared in about fifty films and recorded nearly 500 songs.\n\n\"Sara was a woman who did what she wanted. Nobody could with beat her: neither Mexico, nor the United States nor the Franco regime [in Spain],\" says Israel Rol\u00f3n-Barada, a Spanish professor at Drexel University and a friend of Montiel during her last years of life.\n\nRol\u00f3n-Barada refers to the indomitable character of the Iberian superstar. To fully understand and value Montiel\u2019s legacy,he says, her career must be viewed in terms of its four key stages.\n\nThe first was as a novice actress in the Spain of the 1940s, an impoverished country that had taken a step back in women\u2019s civil rights under the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco.\n\nAccording to Rol\u00f3n-Barada, Montiel was ahead of her time, a post-war woman who had to fight to be a protagonist in a society that had relegated her to play the role the Catholic Church commanded: a good mother, a good wife, a good housewife.\n\nMontiel managed to make 14 films in Spain before age 21, barely knowing how to read and write. To professor Rol\u00f3n-Barada, \"the lack of academic training can explain why Sara didn\u2019t have an automatic success during that first phase. She was very young and very weak facing seasoned actresses like Imperio Argentina or Amparo Rivelles.\u201d\n\nThe second moment of her career began in 1950, when the actress and her mother moved to Mexico in search of better opportunities. Mexico was the mecca of the Latin American film industry and was in the middle of its golden age.\n\nThere, Montiel got in touch with a circle of exiled Spanish intellectuals and improved her literacy skills with the help of poet Le\u00f3n Felipe.\n\nRol\u00f3n-Barada affirms that it is in Mexico where Sara's innate talent fused with her good luck \u2014 \u201can incredible luck because there she gets to work directly with Pedro Infante, who is at the peak of his career, and with Agust\u00edn Lara, the number one composer of Latin American music.\"\n\nNext to Infante, Montiel starred in films like Necesito Dinero, Ah\u00ed viene Mart\u00edn Corona (Little Love of my Life), and El Enamorado (all in 1952). \"She represented a challenge \u2014 she was the woman who broke the molds of that time and challenged her husband, a challenge to the Mexican \u201cmacho\u201d and the Hispanic male,\" says the professor.\n\nIn Mexico, she learned and evolved until she starred in Piel Canela (1953), a role that was made for her and film made to fit her and that leveraged Sara towards what would be, according to Rol\u00f3n-Barada, the third stage of her career: Hollywood.\n\n\"She does not go to Hollywood to look for a job or to knock on doors, but Hollywood comes to her to offer her contracts,\" he affirmed.\n\nMontiel debuted without knowing English in American film industry in 1954, playing the role of Nina in Vera Cruz, a western starring Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster. The film was followed by blockbusters such as Serenade (1956) and Run of the Arrow (1957).\n\nIt was in the mecca of American film industry \u2013and consolidated as a world star\u2013 when Montiel's career began to stagnate.\n\n\"She fell into the same problem that many others experienced: she had two possibilities, she was being offered roles as Mexican or as American Indian,\" says Rol\u00f3n-Barada. \u201cBecause that stereotype existed, once they labeled her that way, they continued to see her as only that.\"\n\nSeven years after having left her mother country, Montiel returned to Spain and it was at that time \u2014the fourth stage in her career \u2014that the artist established herself as one of the most important actresses in the history of Spain.\n\nThere, she starred in El \u00daltimo Cupl\u00e9 (The Last Torch Song, 1957), a film that according to Rol\u00f3n-Barada \"changed her life because[with it] she achieves total success with a minimal budget and [also] brings back the musical, a genre from the 1920s.\u201d\n\nEl \u00daltimo Cupl\u00e9 was followed by blockbusters like La Violetera (1958), Mi \u00daltimo Tango (1960), La Bella Lola (1962), White House Nights (1963) and La Mujer Perdida (1966).\n\nA life to discover\n\nSara Montiel died in Madrid on April 8, 2013, at 85 years of age and with a public life known A to Z by her followers and the media.\n\nHowever, three years ago a biography that promises to \"reveal the hardest and difficult aspects of life that she had to face in order to become Sara Montiel,\" began to be \u201ccooked over a slow fire\u201d in Philadelphia, where Dr. Israel Rol\u00f3n-Barada lives and teaches. Rol\u00f3n-Barada was an admirer of Sara during his adolescence, a friend of the superstar during her last years of life, and has now become her biographer.\n\nThe goal of the book, with a preliminary title of \"The Cost of Being Sara Montiel,\u201d is in the author\u2019s words \"to explain her real life trajectory: we all know how beautiful she was, the immense volume of her cinematographic and musical legacy, but we don\u2019t know the difficulties and very hard things that this woman had to go through to achieve her goal of being a professional actress.\"\n\nRol\u00f3n-Barada recalls that his interest in Sara began very early in his life during his teenage years in San Juan, Puerto Rico. There, every day after school, he went with almost religious discipline to the daily appointment he had with Hispanic cinema at his house.\n\nThe TV show was called \u201cCine de la tarde con Pilar Arenas,\u201d broadcasted on Channel 2.\n\n\"We used to watch the movies and then the next day we commented and sang the songs. That's how my admiration for Sara Montiel began,\" Rol\u00f3n-Barada remembers.\n\nIn 2001, while doing a Ph.D. in M\u00e1laga, Spain, he met her in person during a presentation and signing of her autobiography, Memorias, Vivir es un Placer.\n\nIn 2011, the Modern Language Association of America organized its annual conference in Seattle, which included- a panel called \u201cFrom Conchita Piquer to Isabel Pantoja: Divas and the Spanish Cultural Imaginary.\u201d\n\nBefore the panel, Rol\u00f3n-Barada managed a two-day interview with Sara Montiel on the island of Tabarca, a situation that, according to the professor, amused the diva because it came only 48 hours after their first talk on the phone, after which Rol\u00f3n-Barada flew from Philadelphia to Spain to meet her in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nRol\u00f3n-Barada says that this biography differs from others that have come out about Montiel because his approach to documenting her life is as an academic and cultural historian, resulting in a tone and content distinct from the commercial or sensationalist elements of other publications.\n\nFor now, the professor needs to work on a couple of details and conduct a few additional interviews in Mexico and Spain before finishing his version of Montiel's life, which he expects to publish at the beginning of next spring."}]}
