He was married to Valentine Gross. From the 1920s he turned towards religion, and in 1929 he retreated to Mas de Fourques, near Lunel. He became particularly known for his stagings of Victor Hugo\u2019s dramas. He had a romantic temperament, and was most at home with gouache, quicker to dry than oil, and thus more apt for capturing fleeting inspiration, and a more substantial medium than watercolour. He was able to adapt medieval and romantic sources to a more contemporary treatment. It was by means of this somewhat Baroque side of his imagination that he often brushed with Surrealism, as is evidenced in his humorous, strange costume and set designs which he conceived in 1921 for Wedding on the Eiffel Tower ( Mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel) by Jean Cocteau. The latter was a production of the Swedish Ballet, for which he developed a whole comical series of \u20181900\u2019 characters, such as cyclists and bathers. He also designed for the ballet-pantomime Romeo and Juliet, mounted in 1924, by the company, Paris Evenings ( Soir\u00e9es de Paris). Both productions were conceived by Jean Cocteau. Hugo then withdrew to the Midi region, where he painted still-lifes, and gouache landscapes in lively tones of the Languedoc, England, Paris and Russia. He was also an imaginative illustrator, some of his compositions including Cheeks on Fire ( Les Joues en feu) by Raymond Radiguet; Wedding on the Eiffel Tower ( Les Mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel) by Jean Cocteau and Climates ( Climats) by Andr\u00e9 Maurois, one of his strangest illustrative works. He also illustrated many other works, such as those of Max Jacob, P\u00e9guy, Ren\u00e9 Char and Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Beno\u00eet.\n\nIn 1994, a collection of his works was shown at the Mus\u00e9e-biblioth\u00e8que Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Beno\u00eet in Al\u00e8s. In 1995, the Mus\u00e9e National de la Coop\u00e9ration Franco-Am\u00e9ricaine organised an exhibition at the Ch\u00e2teau de Bl\u00e9rancourt in Chauny of drawings executed at the front during World War I. A retrospective of his work was shown at the Maison de Victor Hugo in Paris in 1995, and another was presented at the Mus\u00e9e Fabre de Montpellier in the same year.\n\nMuseum and Gallery Holdings\n\nMontpellier (Mus.

His grandfather, Charles Hugo was a journalist, pioneer of early photographic techniques and a campaigner against the death penalty, and his father Georges Hugo was a published author and a recognised painter.\n\nHis mother, Pauline M\u00e9nard-Dorian, was the daughter of Paul-Fran\u00e7ois M\u00e9nard, conseiller g\u00e9n\u00e9ral and d\u00e9put\u00e9 of the H\u00e9rault department during the 1870s\u201380s, by his wife Aline Dorian, daughter of Pierre Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dorian, minister of works during the siege of Paris.\n\nJean Hugo was married twice, first in 1919 to Valentine Hugo (n\u00e9e Valentine Gross, no children from this marriage) and then in 1949 to Lauretta Hope-Nicholson, daughter of Hedley Hope-Nicholson. Jean Hugo and Lauretta had seven children, several of whom have gone on to establish successful careers in the arts.\n\nJean Hugo's half-brother Fran\u00e7ois Hugo designed limited-edition jewellery interpretations for Pablo Picasso, Jean Cocteau, Max Ernst and Coco Chanel during the '20s Modern period.\n\nPierre Hugo \u2013 son of Fran\u00e7ois Hugo \u2013 is also a jewellery designer and has written a book about the artistic legacy of the Hugo family, Les Hugo \u2013 Un Temoignage (Rocher, France, 2007).\n\nPaintings\n\nHugo is predominantly known for his sketches and oil or gouache paintings, which are often executed in small formats. He also illustrated books, designed theatre sets and costumes and produced ceramics, murals, textile designs and stained glass windows. Hugo designed the sets and costumes for Carl Theodor Dreyer's film The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928). His paintings can be viewed at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia, and are also present in collections in London, Tokyo, Toronto, Paris, Marseille, and at the Musee Fabre in Montpellier, France \u2013 where there is room dedicated to his paintings.\n\nMaison en ruine \u00e0 la targette , 1915\n\nInt\u00e9rieur d'un bar , 1917\n\nPanneaux de signalisation de chemin de fer (aquarelle, page de carnet), 1918\n\nJean Hugo's painting is unique in the artistic panorama of the first half of the 20th century and maintains an authentic originality while evoking certain avant-garde themes of magical realism or metaphysical painting. At the start of the 1930s, in between na\u00efve and happy scenes and various theatrical projects \u2013 such as Jean Cocteau's Les mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel \u2013 he produced a series of masterful works in brooding, unsettling, tones (Solitude, 1933).\n\nHe showed an interest in forest scenes (L'Ermite de Meudon, 1933) and religious themes (La C\u00e8ne, 1933). L'Imposteur (1931) and La Baie des Tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s (1932) were produced in the same period. His painting were based on the sketchbooks that he had with him at all times. He used to say that \"Inspiration comes naturally but one has to arrange regular meetings with it\".\n\nL'Imposteur (1931) concludes Hugo's first artistic period, which coincides with his move from Paris to the family property at the Mas de Fourques, Lunel, France, following the death of his grandmother. This imposing painting is a masterful assembly of the most important insights he had acquired thus far: the lessons of the Italian primitives, of Henri Rousseau, of Poussin and Picasso, sources of inspiration on which he is constantly drawing. The subject of the painting evokes the discomfort of the catechumen in the midst of the faithful, prevented from taking communion during Christmas mass at the Church of Saint-Fran\u00e7ois in Montpellier. The painting is set in the countryside around Lunel, with its vineyards and low scrubland (garrigue). The tense and complex composition of the work is extremely well executed. No element, line, motif, nuance of colour or object is secondary. Each element contributes to the pictorial vision. The delicate volumes are bathed in an intense luminosity and stand out from the background. The figures are fixed in the space by superimposed connections, in the Florentine manner.\n\nIn the middle of the 1930s, he began using oil paints to create his larger compositions while continuing to paint with tempera. Le Mangeur au chandail ray\u00e9 (autoportrait) (1940) shows the artist in his home at the Mas de Fourques. The motif of the stripes contrasts with the neat contours of the table, the chimney and the wall. In this homely setting, the figure seems surrounded by mystery and casualness. Although Hugo does not draw greatly on De Chirico, this work evokes the feeling of isolation and mystery that characterises the production of the latter.\n\nJean Hugo's work bears witness to his intention to work outside of current trends and fashionable theories. He never felt the need to participate in the artistic debates of his time and paid the price for it by never achieving wide recognition of his work by the general public.\n\nHis auction record is $US308,200, for Les Plaisirs et les Jours, set at Fran\u00e7ois de Ricql\u00e8s' auction, Paris, on 26 November 1999.\n\nSelected Exhibitions\n\nHugo's work has been widely exhibited, with solo retrospectives taking place in France, England, Japan, Canada and the USA.\n\nJean Hugo and Max Jacob , Claridge Gallery, London, 1929\n\n, Claridge Gallery, London, 1929 The Art of Jean Hugo , Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, 1973\n\n, Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, 1973 Jean Hugo , Mus\u00e9e Paul Val\u00e9ry, S\u00e8te, 1974\n\n, Mus\u00e9e Paul Val\u00e9ry, S\u00e8te, 1974 Jean Hugo '77 , Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, 1977\n\n, Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, 1977 Jean Hugo , Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, 1977-78\n\n, Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, 1977-78 Paintings and Drawings by Jean Hugo and Jean Cocteau , Sotheby's, London, 1981\n\n, Sotheby's, London, 1981 Jean Hugo: Costumes pour \"l'Homme qui rit\" , Maison de Victor Hugo, Paris, 1984\n\n, Maison de Victor Hugo, Paris, 1984 Jean Hugo: 1894-1984 , Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, B\u00e9ziers, 1985\n\n, Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, B\u00e9ziers, 1985 Jean Hugo: palettes et souvenirs , Mus\u00e9e Victor Hugo, Paris, 1994-5\n\n, Mus\u00e9e Victor Hugo, Paris, 1994-5 Jean Hugo: Dessins des ann\u00e9es de guerre (1915\u20131919) , Ch\u00e2teau de Bl\u00e9rancourt Mus\u00e9e de la coop\u00e9ration franco-am\u00e9ricaine, 1994-5\n\n, Ch\u00e2teau de Bl\u00e9rancourt Mus\u00e9e de la coop\u00e9ration franco-am\u00e9ricaine, 1994-5 Jean Hugo: Une R\u00e9trospective , Pavillon du Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, 1995\n\n, Pavillon du Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, 1995 Jean Hugo: a Retrospective , Julian Barran Gallery, London, 1996\n\n, Julian Barran Gallery, London, 1996 Jean Hugo et la Sc\u00e8ne , Biblioth\u00e8que-mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra, Paris, 2001\n\n, Biblioth\u00e8que-mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra, Paris, 2001 Jean Hugo, le manuscrit enlumin\u00e9 , Mus\u00e9e M\u00e9dard, Lunel, 2014\n\n, Mus\u00e9e M\u00e9dard, Lunel, 2014 Jean Hugo: l'Enlumineur du Quotidien, Mus\u00e9e Pierre Andr\u00e9 Benoit, Al\u00e8s, 2014\n\nPublished work\n\nLe Retour de l'Enfant Terrible: Lettres 1923\u20131966 by Jean Bourgoint, Jean Hugo, Jean Mouton (Descl\u00e9e de Brouwer, 1975)\n\nAvant d'Oublier (Before I Forget), autobiography (Fayard, 1976), was a humorous memoir of his family and a first-hand account of the 1920s French Surrealist movement.\n\nLe Regard de la M\u00e9moire (Actes Sud, 1983) \u2013 Jean Hugo's memoirs of the period from 1914 to 1945.

They are based on the detailed diaries Hugo kept up to his death in 1984. The entries are unedited and instinctive, as found in the original notebooks, with an elegant, ironic writing style. Through his diary entries Jean Hugo reveals the alchemy of his artistic work, and the eye he brought to bear on people and landscapes. The book conveys the philosophy of his later years, sometimes disenchanted and often delectable. \"My illness\", wrote Jean Hugo on the last page of his diary, \"is called art\u00e9rite p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique, like the new boulevard around Paris.\" The book includes drawings and colour reproductions of Jean Hugo's paintings\n\nDessins des ann\u00e9es de guerre (1915\u20131919) \u2013 Drawings of the war (Actes Sud, 1994)\n\nBooks illustrated by Jean Hugo\n\nHugo's first published illustration appeared in 1918, a monogramme for La Sir\u00e8ne publishing house.\n\nRaymond Radiguet: Les Joues en Feu , Bernouard, 1920.\n\n, Bernouard, 1920.

He was, and remains the very image of that perfect humility of the illuminators, for whom daily truths trumpted decorative graces. His powerful hand, his big jupiterian eye, his olypism in a way, did not use thunder but little watercolours so vast that it seemed as if their size was the result of a phenomenon of perspective. Indeed, he seems to view the sea in Brittany from a distance, and the garrigue by the big end of the telescope, which does not prevent him from evoking around us the mysterious odour of seaweed and wild herbs. Jean Hugo, subtle peasant, medieval monk, chasses the angel from the bizarre through knowing all its tricks by heart.\"\n\nGustave Thibon: \"I knew him intimately. He was a strange being, admirable, a mystic, a lover, a great artist, who no doubt sinned by excess of modesty. He had been a little tired of fame by his name, which was extremely heavy. [...] Jean Hugo spent his youth in that golden world of the big families of the Third Republic, the Berthelot, the Favre, the Renan, the Daudet, a world that he moved away from for a more isolated life in Lunel. His work is far better known, and valued, in America than in France, where he still suffers a little of being eclipsed by his name. I consider him a great painter, and a great painter that is relatively unknown. If he hadn't found others to look after publicising him, he would never have sold a single painting. Picasso, who was a good friend of his, used to say to him \"you do nothing for your fame\". And indeed he did nothing for it \u2013 others did it to him. Once again, he was a pure being. If the word innocence could be applied to anyone it was him. He was very handsome, and of prodigious vitality \u2013 dare I say Hugolian. He was detached enough not to install himself in his own name \u2013 while still showing unconditional admiration for the work of his great ancestor, that he knew in detail.\" Entretiens avec Gustave Thibon by Philippe Barthelet (\u00c9ditions du Rocher, Monaco, 2001)\n\nMaurice Sachs: \"Jean Hugo was calm, kind and generous. Life flowed calmly before him and we knew of no enemies of his. He carried the heavy burden of his family name with elegance. Like his father Georges Hugo he was a man of the world, a man of great distinction in heart and spirit, a kind friend, a man you would want to have in your life.\" La D\u00e9cade de l'illusion (Paris, Gallimard, 1950 p. 14\u201316)\n\nPaul Morand: \"Jean Hugo's artistic temperament holds its own outside of all fashions. His work reminds us of the marvels that the relaxation of some prince of ancient times might have produced, as can be found in the tales of a thousand and one nights.\""}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Jean-Hugo", "page_content": "Jean Hugo (19 November 1894 \u2013 21 June 1984) was a painter, illustrator, theatre designer and author.

He was part of a number of artistic circles that included Jean Cocteau, Raymond Radiguet, Pablo Picasso, Georges Auric, Erik Satie, Blaise Cendrars, Marie-Laure de Noailles, Paul Eluard, Francis Poulenc, Charles Dullin, Louis Jouvet, Colette, Marcel Proust, Jacques Maritain, Max Jacob, Carl Theodor Dreyer, Marie Bell, Louise de Vilmorin, Cecil Beaton and many others.\n\nHugo family\n\nJean Hugo was the great-grandson of the poet, playwright, novelist, essayist, visual artist, statesman, human rights activist and exponent of the Romantic movement in France, Victor Hugo. His grandfather, Charles Hugo was a journalist, pioneer of early photographic techniques and a campaigner against the death penalty, and his father Georges Hugo was a published author and a recognised painter.\n\nHis mother, Pauline M\u00e9nard-Dorian, was the daughter of Paul-Fran\u00e7ois M\u00e9nard, conseiller g\u00e9n\u00e9ral and d\u00e9put\u00e9 of the H\u00e9rault department during the 1870s\u201380s, by his wife Aline Dorian, daughter of Pierre Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dorian, minister of works during the siege of Paris.\n\nJean Hugo was married twice, first in 1919 to Valentine Hugo (n\u00e9e Valentine Gross, no children from this marriage) and then in 1949 to Lauretta Hope-Nicholson, daughter of Hedley Hope-Nicholson. Jean Hugo and Lauretta had seven children, several of whom have gone on to establish successful careers in the arts.\n\nJean Hugo's half-brother Fran\u00e7ois Hugo designed limited-edition jewellery interpretations for Pablo Picasso, Jean Cocteau, Max Ernst and Coco Chanel during the '20s Modern period.\n\nPierre Hugo \u2013 son of Fran\u00e7ois Hugo \u2013 is also a jewellery designer and has written a book about the artistic legacy of the Hugo family, Les Hugo \u2013 Un Temoignage (Rocher, France, 2007).\n\nPaintings\n\nHugo is predominantly known for his sketches and oil or gouache paintings, which are often executed in small formats. He also illustrated books, designed theatre sets and costumes and produced ceramics, murals, textile designs and stained glass windows. Hugo designed the sets and costumes for Carl Theodor Dreyer's film The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928). His paintings can be viewed at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia, and are also present in collections in London, Tokyo, Toronto, Paris, Marseille, and at the Musee Fabre in Montpellier, France \u2013 where there is room dedicated to his paintings.\n\nJean Hugo's painting is unique in the artistic panorama of the first half of the 20th century and maintains an authentic originality while evoking certain avant-garde themes of magical realism or metaphysical painting. At the start of the 1930s, in between na\u00efve and happy scenes and various theatrical projects \u2013 such as Jean Cocteau's Les mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel \u2013 he produced a series of masterful works in brooding, unsettling, tones (Solitude, 1933).\n\nHe showed an interest in forest scenes (L'Ermite de Meudon, 1933) and religious themes (La C\u00e8ne, 1933). L'Imposteur (1931) and La Baie des Tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s (1932) were produced in the same period. His painting were based on the sketchbooks that he had with him at all times. He used to say that \"Inspiration comes naturally but one has to arrange regular meetings with it\".\n\nL'Imposteur (1931) concludes Hugo's first artistic period, which coincides with his move from Paris to the family property at the Mas de Fourques, Lunel, France, following the death of his grandmother. This imposing painting is a masterful assembly of the most important insights he had acquired thus far: the lessons of the Italian primitives, of Henri Rousseau, of Poussin and Picasso, sources of inspiration on which he is constantly drawing. The subject of the painting evokes the discomfort of the catechumen in the midst of the faithful, prevented from taking communion during Christmas mass at the Church of Saint-Fran\u00e7ois in Montpellier. The painting is set in the countryside around Lunel, with its vineyards and low scrubland (garrigue). The tense and complex composition of the work is extremely well executed. No element, line, motif, nuance of colour or object is secondary. Each element contributes to the pictorial vision. The delicate volumes are bathed in an intense luminosity and stand out from the background. The figures are fixed in the space by superimposed connections, in the Florentine manner.\n\nIn the middle of the 1930s, he began using oil paints to create his larger compositions while continuing to paint with tempera. Le Mangeur au chandail ray\u00e9 (autoportrait) (1940) shows the artist in his home at the Mas de Fourques. The motif of the stripes contrasts with the neat contours of the table, the chimney and the wall. In this homely setting, the figure seems surrounded by mystery and casualness. Although Hugo does not draw greatly on De Chirico, this work evokes the feeling of isolation and mystery that characterises the production of the latter.\n\nJean Hugo's work bears witness to his intention to work outside of current trends and fashionable theories. He never felt the need to participate in the artistic debates of his time and paid the price for it by never achieving wide recognition of his work by the general public.\n\nHis auction record is $US308,200, for Les Plaisirs et les Jours, set at Fran\u00e7ois de Ricql\u00e8s' auction, Paris, on 26 November 1999.\n\nSelected Exhibitions\n\nHugo's work has been widely exhibited, with solo retrospectives taking place in France, England, Japan, Canada and the USA.\n\nJean Hugo and Max Jacob, Claridge Gallery, London, 1929\n\nThe Art of Jean Hugo, Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, 1973\n\nJean Hugo, Mus\u00e9e Paul Val\u00e9ry, S\u00e8te, 1974\n\nJean Hugo '77, Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, 1977\n\nJean Hugo, Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, 1977-78\n\nPaintings and Drawings by Jean Hugo and Jean Cocteau, Sotheby's, London, 1981\n\nJean Hugo: Costumes pour \"l'Homme qui rit\", Maison de Victor Hugo, Paris, 1984\n\nJean Hugo: 1894-1984, Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, B\u00e9ziers, 1985\n\nJean Hugo: palettes et souvenirs, Mus\u00e9e Victor Hugo, Paris, 1994-5\n\nJean Hugo: Dessins des ann\u00e9es de guerre (1915\u20131919), Ch\u00e2teau de Bl\u00e9rancourt Mus\u00e9e de la coop\u00e9ration franco-am\u00e9ricaine, 1994-5\n\nJean Hugo: Une R\u00e9trospective, Pavillon du Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, 1995\n\nJean Hugo: a Retrospective, Julian Barran Gallery, London, 1996\n\nJean Hugo et la Sc\u00e8ne, Biblioth\u00e8que-mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra, Paris, 2001\n\nJean Hugo, le manuscrit enlumin\u00e9, Mus\u00e9e M\u00e9dard, Lunel, 2014\n\nJean Hugo: l'Enlumineur du Quotidien, Mus\u00e9e Pierre Andr\u00e9 Benoit, Al\u00e8s, 2014\n\nPublished work\n\nLe Retour de l'Enfant Terrible: Lettres 1923\u20131966 by Jean Bourgoint, Jean Hugo, Jean Mouton (Descl\u00e9e de Brouwer, 1975)\n\nAvant d'Oublier (Before I Forget), autobiography (Fayard, 1976), was a humorous memoir of his family and a first-hand account of the 1920s French Surrealist movement.\n\nLe Regard de la M\u00e9moire (Actes Sud, 1983) \u2013 Jean Hugo's memoirs of the period from 1914 to 1945.

He was, and remains the very image of that perfect humility of the illuminators, for whom daily truths trumpted decorative graces. His powerful hand, his big jupiterian eye, his olypism in a way, did not use thunder but little watercolours so vast that it seemed as if their size was the result of a phenomenon of perspective. Indeed, he seems to view the sea in Brittany from a distance, and the garrigue by the big end of the telescope, which does not prevent him from evoking around us the mysterious odour of seaweed and wild herbs. Jean Hugo, subtle peasant, medieval monk, chasses the angel from the bizarre through knowing all its tricks by heart.\"\n\nGustave Thibon: \"I knew him intimately. He was a strange being, admirable, a mystic, a lover, a great artist, who no doubt sinned by excess of modesty. He had been a little tired of fame by his name, which was extremely heavy. [...] Jean Hugo spent his youth in that golden world of the big families of the Third Republic, the Berthelot, the Favre, the Renan, the Daudet, a world that he moved away from for a more isolated life in Lunel. His work is far better known, and valued, in America than in France, where he still suffers a little of being eclipsed by his name. I consider him a great painter, and a great painter that is relatively unknown. If he hadn't found others to look after publicising him, he would never have sold a single painting. Picasso, who was a good friend of his, used to say to him \"you do nothing for your fame\". And indeed he did nothing for it \u2013 others did it to him. Once again, he was a pure being. If the word innocence could be applied to anyone it was him. He was very handsome, and of prodigious vitality \u2013 dare I say Hugolian. He was detached enough not to install himself in his own name \u2013 while still showing unconditional admiration for the work of his great ancestor, that he knew in detail.\" Entretiens avec Gustave Thibon by Philippe Barthelet (\u00c9ditions du Rocher, Monaco, 2001)\n\nMaurice Sachs: \"Jean Hugo was calm, kind and generous. Life flowed calmly before him and we knew of no enemies of his. He carried the heavy burden of his family name with elegance. Like his father Georges Hugo he was a man of the world, a man of great distinction in heart and spirit, a kind friend, a man you would want to have in your life.\" La D\u00e9cade de l'illusion (Paris, Gallimard, 1950 p. 14\u201316)\n\nPaul Morand: \"Jean Hugo's artistic temperament holds its own outside of all fashions. His work reminds us of the marvels that the relaxation of some prince of ancient times might have produced, as can be found in the tales of a thousand and one nights.\""}, {"url": "https://deadorkicking.com/jean-hugo-dead-or-alive/", "page_content": "Jean Hugo Death\n\nJean passed away on June 21, 1984 at the age of 89 in Lunel, Languedoc-Roussillon, France.\n\nJean Hugo death quick facts: When did Jean Hugo die?

Yet, it was quickly decided that this major invention of the period would have its place in the future Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay.\n\nHowever, a choice had to be made between creating a permanent collection or merely organizing temporary exhibitions of photographs belonging to other institutions or private collectors. Several factors worked in favor of the first solution. It gave the museum the means to contribute to the enrichment of French heritage, ensure a certain autonomy in the organization of exhibitions in its rooms and, finally, avoid the creation of a \"dead\" section, since it was deprived of its own collections.\n\nL\u00e9on Riesener\n\nPortrait d'Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix de face, en buste, en 1842\n\nMus\u00e9e d'Orsay\n\nAcquis en vente publique par les Mus\u00e9es nationaux gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'aide de la Commission nationale de la photographie, 1995\n\n\u00a9 Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Dist. RMN-Grand Palais / Patrice Schmidt\n\nSee the notice of the artwork\n\nThe decision to create a photographic collection at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay was therefore taken in 1978. This collection had to be built up from scratch, since, unlike painting and sculpture, there were no collections of this technique that had been assembled over the years by the former Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg or the Louvre.\n\nThe Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay's program gradually took shape. It would no longer be a museum covering the whole of the 19th century, but a more reduced period from 1848 to 1914.\n\nBut it was illogical to force the photography collections to comply strictly with these time limits. On the one hand, the invention of this technique was officially proclaimed on August 19, 1839 by the astronomer and physicist Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Arago, during a session at the Academy of Sciences in Paris, and on the other hand, 1918 corresponds, from an aesthetic point of view, to the emergence of modern photography. Indeed, it was after the First World War that the Pictorialist movement petered out and that experimental photography was born in Germany and Eastern Europe, definitively overturning 19th-century patterns."}, {"url": "https://www.leightonfineart.co.uk/artist/jean-hugo/", "page_content": "Biography\n\nJean Hugo was the great-grandson of Victor Hugo. He was self-taught, and studied literature before devoting himself to painting. He related his experiences in World War I in The Perspective of Memory ( Le Regard de la m\u00e9moire). After the war he associated himself with Cocteau, Radiguet, the composers known as Group of Six ( Groupe des Six), as well as Satie, Max Jacob, Picasso, Diaghilev and Stravinsky. He was married to Valentine Gross. From the 1920s he turned towards religion, and in 1929 he retreated to Mas de Fourques, near Lunel. He became particularly known for his stagings of Victor Hugo\u2019s dramas. He had a romantic temperament, and was most at home with gouache, quicker to dry than oil, and thus more apt for capturing fleeting inspiration, and a more substantial medium than watercolour. He was able to adapt medieval and romantic sources to a more contemporary treatment. It was by means of this somewhat Baroque side of his imagination that he often brushed with Surrealism, as is evidenced in his humorous, strange costume and set designs which he conceived in 1921 for Wedding on the Eiffel Tower ( Mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel) by Jean Cocteau. The latter was a production of the Swedish Ballet, for which he developed a whole comical series of \u20181900\u2019 characters, such as cyclists and bathers. He also designed for the ballet-pantomime Romeo and Juliet, mounted in 1924, by the company, Paris Evenings ( Soir\u00e9es de Paris). Both productions were conceived by Jean Cocteau. Hugo then withdrew to the Midi region, where he painted still-lifes, and gouache landscapes in lively tones of the Languedoc, England, Paris and Russia. He was also an imaginative illustrator, some of his compositions including Cheeks on Fire ( Les Joues en feu) by Raymond Radiguet; Wedding on the Eiffel Tower ( Les Mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel) by Jean Cocteau and Climates ( Climats) by Andr\u00e9 Maurois, one of his strangest illustrative works. He also illustrated many other works, such as those of Max Jacob, P\u00e9guy, Ren\u00e9 Char and Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Beno\u00eet.\n\nIn 1994, a collection of his works was shown at the Mus\u00e9e-biblioth\u00e8que Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Beno\u00eet in Al\u00e8s. In 1995, the Mus\u00e9e National de la Coop\u00e9ration Franco-Am\u00e9ricaine organised an exhibition at the Ch\u00e2teau de Bl\u00e9rancourt in Chauny of drawings executed at the front during World War I.

In 1912 he began training as an engraver with his uncle in Belgrade. He moved in 1914 to Germany where he lived for a time with his sister in Barmen, (now part of Wuppertal). There he studied at the college of arts and crafts with professor Gustav Wieth\u00fccher.\n\n\n\nFrom 1918 to 1919 he went back to \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, where he was joint founder of \"Jung Jidysz\", a group of avant-garde artists. In 1920 he returned briefly to Berlin; in 1921 he returned to Barmen, and in 1922 he moved to D\u00fcsseldorf. There he joined Franz Seiwert and Otto Freundlich in an artists group known as the Cologne Progressives. He became a teacher at the Academy of Arts, and became acquainted with Paul Klee, who influenced his work. A painting by Adler received a gold medal at the exhibition \"German art D\u00fcsseldorf\" in 1928.\n\n\n\nIn 1929 and 1930 he went on study trips in Mallorca and other places in Spain. During the election campaign of July 1932 he published with a group of leftist artists and intellectuals an urgent appeal against the policy of the National Socialists and for communism. As a modern artist, and especially as a Jew, he faced persecution under Hitler's regime which took power in 1933. In that year, two of his pictures were displayed by the Nazis at the Mannheimer Arts Center as examples of degenerate art, and Adler left Germany, staying in Paris where he regarded his exile consciously as political resistance against the fascist regime in Germany. In the years that followed, he made numerous journeys to Poland, Italy, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Romania and the Soviet Union. In 1937, twenty-five of his works were seized from public collections by the Nazis and four were shown in the Entartete Kunst (Degenerate Art) exhibition in Munich.\n\n\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II in 1939, he volunteered for the Polish army that had been reconstituted in France; in 1941 he was discharged for health reasons and lived thereafter in Kirkcudbright in Scotland. In 1943 he moved to London. Died in Whitley Cottage in Aldbourne on 25 April 1949 at the age of 53 years and with the bitter knowledge that none of his nine brothers and sisters had survived the Holocaust.\n\n\n\nAdler was strongly influenced by Picasso and L\u00e9ger. He enjoyed experimenting with materials, for example sand admixtures. He often painted Jewish subjects, and painted some few abstract compositions.\n\nThis is a part of the Wikipedia article used under the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 3.0 Unported License (CC-BY-SA).

He was born in Paris and died in his home at the Mas de Fourques, near Lunel, France. Brought up in a lively artistic environment, he began teaching himself drawing and painting and wrote essays and poetry from a very early age. His artistic career spans the 20th century, from his early sketches of the First World War, through the creative ferment of the Parisian interwar years, and up to his death in 1984. He was part of a number of artistic circles that included Jean Cocteau, Raymond Radiguet, Pablo Picasso, Georges Auric, Erik Satie, Blaise Cendrars, Marie-Laure de Noailles, Paul Eluard, Francis Poulenc, Charles Dullin, Louis Jouvet, Colette, Marcel Proust, Jacques Maritain, Max Jacob, Carl Theodor Dreyer, Marie Bell, Louise de Vilmorin, Cecil Beaton and many others.\n\nHugo family\n\nJean Hugo was the great-grandson of the poet, playwright, novelist, essayist, visual artist, statesman, human rights activist and exponent of the Romantic movement in France, Victor Hugo. His grandfather, Charles Hugo was a journalist, pioneer of early photographic techniques and a campaigner against the death penalty, and his father Georges Hugo was a published author and a recognised painter.\n\nHis mother, Pauline M\u00e9nard-Dorian, was the daughter of Paul-Fran\u00e7ois M\u00e9nard, conseiller g\u00e9n\u00e9ral and d\u00e9put\u00e9 of the H\u00e9rault department during the 1870s\u201380s, by his wife Aline Dorian, daughter of Pierre Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dorian, minister of works during the siege of Paris.\n\nJean Hugo was married twice, first in 1919 to Valentine Hugo (n\u00e9e Valentine Gross, no children from this marriage) and then in 1949 to Lauretta Hope-Nicholson, daughter of Hedley Hope-Nicholson. Jean Hugo and Lauretta had seven children, several of whom have gone on to establish successful careers in the arts.\n\nJean Hugo's half-brother Fran\u00e7ois Hugo designed limited-edition jewellery interpretations for Pablo Picasso, Jean Cocteau, Max Ernst and Coco Chanel during the '20s Modern period.\n\nPierre Hugo \u2013 son of Fran\u00e7ois Hugo \u2013 is also a jewellery designer and has written a book about the artistic legacy of the Hugo family, Les Hugo \u2013 Un Temoignage (Rocher, France, 2007).\n\nPaintings\n\nHugo is predominantly known for his sketches and oil or gouache paintings, which are often executed in small formats. He also illustrated books, designed theatre sets and costumes and produced ceramics, murals, textile designs and stained glass windows. Hugo designed the sets and costumes for Carl Theodor Dreyer's film The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928). His paintings can be viewed at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia, and are also present in collections in London, Tokyo, Toronto, Paris, Marseille, and at the Musee Fabre in Montpellier, France \u2013 where there is room dedicated to his paintings.\n\nJean Hugo's painting is unique in the artistic panorama of the first half of the 20th century and maintains an authentic originality while evoking certain avant-garde themes of magical realism or metaphysical painting. At the start of the 1930s, in between na\u00efve and happy scenes and various theatrical projects \u2013 such as Jean Cocteau's Les mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel \u2013 he produced a series of masterful works in brooding, unsettling, tones (Solitude, 1933).\n\nHe showed an interest in forest scenes (L'Ermite de Meudon, 1933) and religious themes (La C\u00e8ne, 1933). L'Imposteur (1931) and La Baie des Tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s (1932) were produced in the same period. His painting were based on the sketchbooks that he had with him at all times. He used to say that \"Inspiration comes naturally but one has to arrange regular meetings with it\".\n\nL'Imposteur (1931) concludes Hugo's first artistic period, which coincides with his move from Paris to the family property at the Mas de Fourques, Lunel, France, following the death of his grandmother. This imposing painting is a masterful assembly of the most important insights he had acquired thus far: the lessons of the Italian primitives, of Henri Rousseau, of Poussin and Picasso, sources of inspiration on which he is constantly drawing. The subject of the painting evokes the discomfort of the catechumen in the midst of the faithful, prevented from taking communion during Christmas mass at the Church of Saint-Fran\u00e7ois in Montpellier. The painting is set in the countryside around Lunel, with its vineyards and low scrubland (garrigue). The tense and complex composition of the work is extremely well executed. No element, line, motif, nuance of colour or object is secondary. Each element contributes to the pictorial vision. The delicate volumes are bathed in an intense luminosity and stand out from the background. The figures are fixed in the space by superimposed connections, in the Florentine manner.\n\nIn the middle of the 1930s, he began using oil paints to create his larger compositions while continuing to paint with tempera. Le Mangeur au chandail ray\u00e9 (autoportrait) (1940) shows the artist in his home at the Mas de Fourques. The motif of the stripes contrasts with the neat contours of the table, the chimney and the wall. In this homely setting, the figure seems surrounded by mystery and casualness. Although Hugo does not draw greatly on De Chirico, this work evokes the feeling of isolation and mystery that characterises the production of the latter.\n\nJean Hugo's work bears witness to his intention to work outside of current trends and fashionable theories. He never felt the need to participate in the artistic debates of his time and paid the price for it by never achieving wide recognition of his work by the general public.\n\nHis auction record is $US308,200, for Les Plaisirs et les Jours, set at Fran\u00e7ois de Ricql\u00e8s' auction, Paris, on 26 November 1999.\n\nSelected Exhibitions\n\nHugo's work has been widely exhibited, with solo retrospectives taking place in France, England, Japan, Canada and the USA.\n\nJean Hugo and Max Jacob, Claridge Gallery, London, 1929\n\nThe Art of Jean Hugo, Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, 1973\n\nJean Hugo, Mus\u00e9e Paul Val\u00e9ry, S\u00e8te, 1974\n\nJean Hugo '77, Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, 1977\n\nJean Hugo, Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, 1977-78\n\nPaintings and Drawings by Jean Hugo and Jean Cocteau, Sotheby's, London, 1981\n\nJean Hugo: Costumes pour \"l'Homme qui rit\", Maison de Victor Hugo, Paris, 1984\n\nJean Hugo: 1894-1984, Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, B\u00e9ziers, 1985\n\nJean Hugo: palettes et souvenirs, Mus\u00e9e Victor Hugo, Paris, 1994-5\n\nJean Hugo: Dessins des ann\u00e9es de guerre (1915\u20131919), Ch\u00e2teau de Bl\u00e9rancourt Mus\u00e9e de la coop\u00e9ration franco-am\u00e9ricaine, 1994-5\n\nJean Hugo: Une R\u00e9trospective, Pavillon du Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, 1995\n\nJean Hugo: a Retrospective, Julian Barran Gallery, London, 1996\n\nJean Hugo et la Sc\u00e8ne, Biblioth\u00e8que-mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra, Paris, 2001\n\nJean Hugo, le manuscrit enlumin\u00e9, Mus\u00e9e M\u00e9dard, Lunel, 2014\n\nJean Hugo: l'Enlumineur du Quotidien, Mus\u00e9e Pierre Andr\u00e9 Benoit, Al\u00e8s, 2014\n\nPublished work\n\nLe Retour de l'Enfant Terrible: Lettres 1923\u20131966 by Jean Bourgoint, Jean Hugo, Jean Mouton (Descl\u00e9e de Brouwer, 1975)\n\nAvant d'Oublier (Before I Forget), autobiography (Fayard, 1976), was a humorous memoir of his family and a first-hand account of the 1920s French Surrealist movement.\n\nLe Regard de la M\u00e9moire (Actes Sud, 1983) \u2013 Jean Hugo's memoirs of the period from 1914 to 1945.

He was, and remains the very image of that perfect humility of the illuminators, for whom daily truths trumpted decorative graces. His powerful hand, his big jupiterian eye, his olypism in a way, did not use thunder but little watercolours so vast that it seemed as if their size was the result of a phenomenon of perspective. Indeed, he seems to view the sea in Brittany from a distance, and the garrigue by the big end of the telescope, which does not prevent him from evoking around us the mysterious odour of seaweed and wild herbs. Jean Hugo, subtle peasant, medieval monk, chasses the angel from the bizarre through knowing all its tricks by heart.\"\n\nGustave Thibon: \"I knew him intimately. He was a strange being, admirable, a mystic, a lover, a great artist, who no doubt sinned by excess of modesty. He had been a little tired of fame by his name, which was extremely heavy. [...] Jean Hugo spent his youth in that golden world of the big families of the Third Republic, the Berthelot, the Favre, the Renan, the Daudet, a world that he moved away from for a more isolated life in Lunel. His work is far better known, and valued, in America than in France, where he still suffers a little of being eclipsed by his name. I consider him a great painter, and a great painter that is relatively unknown. If he hadn't found others to look after publicising him, he would never have sold a single painting. Picasso, who was a good friend of his, used to say to him \"you do nothing for your fame\". And indeed he did nothing for it \u2013 others did it to him. Once again, he was a pure being. If the word innocence could be applied to anyone it was him. He was very handsome, and of prodigious vitality \u2013 dare I say Hugolian. He was detached enough not to install himself in his own name \u2013 while still showing unconditional admiration for the work of his great ancestor, that he knew in detail.\" Entretiens avec Gustave Thibon by Philippe Barthelet (\u00c9ditions du Rocher, Monaco, 2001)\n\nMaurice Sachs: \"Jean Hugo was calm, kind and generous. Life flowed calmly before him and we knew of no enemies of his. He carried the heavy burden of his family name with elegance.

He was the most important printmaker north of the Alps before Albrecht D\u00fcrer.\n\n\n\nSchongauer was born in about 1440 in Colmar, Alsace, probably the third of the four sons of Caspar Schongauer, a goldsmith from Augsburg who taught his son the art of engraving. Colmar is now in France but was then part of the Holy Roman Empire. He may well have been trained by Master E. S. The art historian A. Hyatt Mayor saw both their individual styles in different parts of a single engraving, and all the works with Schongauer's M\u2020S monogram show a fully developed style. Schongauer established at Colmar a very important school of engraving, out of which grew the \"Little Masters\" of the succeeding generation, and a large group of Nuremberg artists.\n\n\n\nAs a painter, Schongauer was a follower, through the teachings of his probable master Caspar Isenmann, of the Flemish artist Rogier van der Weyden, and his rare existing pictures closely resemble, both in splendour of color and exquisite minuteness of execution, the best works of his contemporaries in Flanders.\n\n\n\nOnly a few of his paintings survive, the most notable of them being the Madonna in the Rose Garden, painted for St Martin's Church, Colmar. The Mus\u00e9e d\u00b4Unterlinden in Colmar possesses eleven panels by him or his workshop, and a small panel of David with Goliath's Head in Munich is attributed to him. The miniature painting of the Death of the Virgin in the National Gallery, London is probably the work of a pupil.\n\n\n\nThe main work of Schongauer's life was the production of a large number of beautiful engravings, which were largely sold, not only in Germany, but also in Italy and even in England and Spain. Vasari says that Michelangelo copied one of his engravings, in the Trial of Saint Anthony. His style shows no trace of Italian influence, but a very clear and organised Gothic.\n\n\n\nHis subjects are mainly religious, but include comic scenes of ordinary life such as the Peasant family going to market or the Two apprentices fighting. One hundred and sixteen engravings are generally recognised as by his hand, and since several are only known from a single impression, there were probably others that are now lost. Many of his pupils' plates as well as his own are signed, M\u2020S, as are many copies probably by artists with no connection to him.\n\n\n\nAmong the most renowned of Schongauer's engravings are the series of the Passion and the Death and Coronation of the Virgin, and the series of the Wise and Foolish Virgins. All are remarkable for their miniature-like treatment, their brilliant touch, and their chromatic force. Some, such as the Death of the Virgin and the Adoration of the Magi are richly-filled compositions of many figures, treated with much largeness of style in spite of their minute scale.\n\nThis is a part of the Wikipedia article used under the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 3.0 Unported License (CC-BY-SA).

He also created illustrations for books, designed theatre sets, and costumes as well as produced ceramics, murals, textile designs and stained glass windows. Hugo's first published illustration appeared in 1918. It was a monogram for La Sir\u00e8ne publishing house. Then he also illustrated Les Joues en Feu by Raymond Radiguet, Bernouard, in 1920; Pommes d'Anis by Francis Jammes, Emile-Paul, 1923; Les Mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel by Jean Cocteau, NRF, and Les Amis Nouvel by Paul Morand, Au Sans Pareil, both in 1924; Rom\u00e9o et Juliette by Shakespeare, Au Sans Pareil, in 1926, among others. Jean Hugo\u2019s paintings were unique in the artistic world of the 20th century. They maintained an authentic originality while recalling certain avant-garde themes of metaphysical painting or magical realism. At the start of the 1930s, in between various theatrical projects, including Jean Cocteau\u2019s Les mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel, he produced a series of masterful artworks, such as Solitude (1933). He was interested in forest scenes (L'Ermite de Meudon, 1933) and religious themes (La C\u00e8ne, 1933). L'Imposteur (1931) and La Baie des Tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s (1932) were produced in the same period. Many of his paintings were based on the sketches that he created all the time. He used to say that \"inspiration comes naturally but one has to arrange regular meetings with it.\" L'Imposteur (1931) was a conclusion of Jean Hugo's first artistic period. Around this time he moved from Paris to the family property at the Mas de Fourques, Lunel, France, after the death of his grandmother. His painting of that period was a masterful assembly of the most important insights he had acquired so far. The lessons of the Italian primitives, of Poussin, of Henri Rousseau, and Picasso, were among the sources of inspiration on which he was constantly drawing. In the middle of the 1930s, Jean Hugo started to use oil paints to create his larger compositions while continuing to paint with tempera. The artist's work witnessed his intention to work outside of present-day currents and fashionable theories. He never took part in the artistic debates and paid the price for it by never achieving wide recognition of his work by the general public. The artist illustrated many limited edition books published between 1948 and 1984 by Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Benoit (PAB), collaborating with such writers as Ren\u00e9 Char, Marcel Jouhandeau, Tristan Tzara and Ren\u00e9 Crevel. Jean Hugo's artworks were widely exhibited, with solo retrospectives taking place in France, England, Japan, Canada and the United States. Among the most prominent of them were: Jean Hugo and Max Jacob at the Claridge Gallery, London, 1929; Jean Hugo '77 at the Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, 1977; Paintings and Drawings by Jean Hugo and Jean Cocteau at Sotheby's, London, 1981; Jean Hugo: 1894-1984 at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, B\u00e9ziers, 1985; Jean Hugo: a Retrospective at the Julian Barran Gallery, London, 1996; Jean Hugo et la Sc\u00e8ne at the Biblioth\u00e8que-mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra, Paris, 2001; Jean Hugo: l'Enlumineur du Quotidien at the Mus\u00e9e Pierre Andr\u00e9 Benoit, Al\u00e8s, 2014, etc."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-hugo", "page_content": "The great-grandson of Victor Hugo, Jean Hugo was a French painter, illustrator, theatre designer and author.

A new mood of occultism, influenced by Freud and the early Surrealists, was in the air. And raising the dead was in Jean\u2019s blood: while his great-grandfather, Victor Hugo, was in exile in the 1850s, he presided over frequent \u201ctable-rapping\u201d sessions on the Channel Islands. As Victor Hugo recorded in four red notebooks, his \u201ctalking table\u201d conducted conversations with such eager spirits as Jesus, Moses, Dante, and Shakespeare\u2014the last of whom, obligingly, concurred with Hugo\u2019s assessment of himself as the greatest writer of all time. Jean and Valentine\u2019s gatherings, however, elicited messages so chilling that the group, spooked, abandoned the practice after only a few tries. It wasn\u2019t an overreaction; before the year\u2019s end, the omens they\u2019d received in their s\u00e9ances were borne out.\n\nIn a pink velvet-lined anteroom, the Hugos and their friends, including the artistic polymath Jean Cocteau and the avant-garde composer Georges Auric, encircled a wooden pedestal with a tripod base and tilting round top, a type of table reputed to encourage spiritual communion. Placing their hands on its surface, which was lacquered black and painted with flowers, they asked questions. The table tapped out answers on the floor (one tap meaning the letter a, and so on), which Jean Hugo wrote down. Over the course of these sittings, the clearest messages were intended for the youngest guest: the nineteen-year-old Raymond Radiguet, Cocteau\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and lover, who had just published his scandalous debut novel, Le Diable au corps (The Devil in the Flesh). \u201cUneasiness will grow with genius,\u201d claimed the \u201cspirit.\u201d Radiguet, the spirit said, \u201cshould love me for he loves nothing.\u201d It warned: \u201cFame does not replace love even in death and I am death.\u201d The following week came death\u2019s final declaration: \u201cI want his youth.\u201d\n\nRadiguet\u2019s publisher, Bernard Grasset, had also wanted the writer\u2019s youth. Eighteen months earlier, Cocteau had taken his young friend to Grasset\u2019s office in the rue des Saints-P\u00e8res. (\u00c9ditions Grasset still occupies the same building, number 61.) Radiguet sat silently as Cocteau read aloud from the manuscript of his novel. Grasset, then a forty-year-old seasoned editor, thought Radiguet looked \u201clike a schoolboy at his first interview with the headmaster.\u201d Among other career triumphs, Grasset had published the first volume of Proust\u2019s \u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu after a competitor rejected it. He genuinely admired Le Diable au corps, but he prized the boy\u2019s precociousness as much as his talent, at least when it came to publicity. While Radiguet revised his novel and rewrote the ending, Grasset paid him a monthly salary of fifteen hundred francs (the equivalent of over three thousand dollars today) and planned the most aggressive book-marketing campaign France had ever seen.\n\nPosters, flyers, and bookstore displays\u2014even cinema newsreels of Radiguet signing his contract and accepting an advance check for a hundred thousand francs\u2014all emphasized the astounding youth of this new literary sensation. The media responded with exasperation at such blatant and unseemly hype. \u201cI don\u2019t care whether the author is seventeen or a hundred and seven,\u201d wrote one reviewer. \u201cIt is the book we have to judge, not the birth certificate.\u201d But the tactics worked. In its first month, Le Diable au corps sold forty-six thousand copies, ushering in a new era where the \u201cno such thing as bad publicity\u201d axiom applied even to the rarefied endeavour of literature. In the words of Cocteau:\n\nBefore Radiguet, publicity was a very discreet affair, with the author pretending to be totally unaware of it. Radiguet was the first author courageous enough to take a long chance by launching a campaign that might have alienated immediate buyers, but thanks to which, within two weeks his book was in the hands of buyers who formerly might not have known about it for years.\n\nJudged on merit rather than manufactured hoopla, Radiguet\u2019s daring plot and spare, controlled prose only served to magnify the shock value of his age. He had written, argued an impressed critic, the most immoral novel since Les Liaisons dangereuses. The gay poet and painter Max Jacob, one of Radiguet\u2019s friends, told him he hoped his second novel would be \u201cless cruel and more chaste.\u201d But the novelist Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac, who reviewed Le Diable au corps on the front page of Les Nouvelles litt\u00e9raires, saw no point in \u201cfulminating\u201d against the tale\u2019s transgressive nature. Instead he praised Radiguet\u2019s restrained and original technique, which seemed to him, remarkably, to betray no literary influences whatsoever.\n\n\u201cI am sure to incur a good deal of reproach,\u201d goes the dynamite first line of the book. \u201cBut what I am to do?\u201d The unnamed narrator, looking back on his years as a clever, stealthily rebellious adolescent, recounts an illicit wartime romance with Marthe, a local girl a few years his senior. With Marthe\u2019s soldier husband off fighting in the trenches, she succumbs to a passionate affair with the boy, who is only sixteen but, in Radiguet\u2019s finely shaded and convincing portrayal, years ahead of her in guile. After their first kiss, Marthe weeps and tries to send him away, saying she is too old for him. For our fledgling sadist hero, this marks a pinnacle of joy. Nothing, he reflects, \u201ccould be quite like the delightful feeling at seeing a nineteen-year-old girl cry because she thinks she\u2019s too old.\u201d\n\nWhen Marthe gets pregnant, the narrator\u2019s childish amazement that his actions might have consequences mingle with pride, horror, and resentment at the prospect of pleasure curtailed. \u201cI wanted to have as much as I could of Marthe before motherhood spoiled her.\u201d Later, he berates himself for sullying a cherished possession. \u201cWhen I thought how I had spoiled Marthe\u2019s graceful beauty and how her belly was swelling, I regarded myself as nothing better than a vandal.\u201d Worse is yet to come. Caught in the freezing rain one night in Paris, after her nervous lover balked at getting them the hotel he\u2019d promised, Marthe catches a bad cold. She dies soon after giving birth. The narrator\u2019s reaction epitomizes the novel\u2019s singular style: aphoristic and brazen, at once astute and artless.\n\nMy jealousy pursued her to the grave and I hoped that there was nothing after death. In the same way we cannot bear the person we love to go without us to some gathering where there will be a lot of people. My heart was at an age where one does not yet think of the future. Yes, what I wished for Marthe was oblivion, rather than a new world where one day I might join her.\n\nMarthe\u2019s premature death, the predictable fate for a fictional scarlet woman, was a literary flourish introduced after Grasset requested a less open-ended denouement. Otherwise, the story is drawn from Radiguet\u2019s own teenage affair with a married woman, a teacher named Alice. (Decades later, Alice\u2019s husband claimed that the book had ruined his life and accused Radiguet of plundering Alice\u2019s diary. A string of salacious headlines ensued.) Radiguet, by nature elusive and inscrutable, publicly stated that he hadn\u2019t written a confessional, but a \u201cfalse autobiography.\u201d Nevertheless, many readers conflated him with his protagonist, castigating the author as a petit voyou\u2014a little thug\u2014for seducing a woman whose husband was off risking his life for France. When Radiguet won the Prix du Nouveau Monde, a short-lived but lucrative literary award (with Cocteau on the jury), the Association of War Veteran Writers protested, saying that the work had \u201cdeeply wounded the feelings of all war veterans.\u201d\n\nNone of this mattered in the slightest to Radiguet. \u201cHe was hard; it took a diamond to scratch his heart,\u201d Cocteau would later reminisce. At just nineteen, Monsieur B\u00e9b\u00e9, as people called him, was rich, famous, and feted by the Parisian avant-garde. Picasso and Coco Chanel were among his doting friends. He moved into the upscale H\u00f4tel Foyot by the Luxembourg Gardens, spent freely on expensive clothes and lavish meals, drank heavily, and smoked opium. He also dallied with various women; his conquests included Picasso\u2019s on-off mistress, Ir\u00e8ne Lagut, and the eccentric poet and one-time Modigliani muse Beatrice Hastings. \u201cB\u00e9b\u00e9 est vicieuse,\u201d a jealous Cocteau supposedly remarked to Hemingway. \u201cIl aime les femmes.\u201d (In French, \u201cvicieuse\u201d\u2014Cocteau employed the feminine form for added bitchiness\u2014carries more of the original meaning of vicious in English: depraved, perverted.)\n\nFor his part, Radiguet chafed at Cocteau\u2019s possessiveness. Eleven years his senior, Cocteau was both ardent paramour and godfather-mentor. To avoid ending up, as Radiguet put it, as \u201ca forty-year-old man called Madame Cocteau,\u201d he contemplated marriage to seventeen-year-old Bronia Perlmutter, a strikingly beautiful Eastern European model who lived with him at the H\u00f4tel Foyot. According to Radiguet\u2019s biographer, Monique Nemer, Cocteau threatened to have Bronia deported along with her sister, Tylia, whom Radiguet had also bedded.\n\nYet Cocteau and his young tormenter, whose creative genius he nurtured and revered maybe even more than his own, had an emotional and intellectual codependency that withstood all the rancor. They wore matching rings, a triple band of white, yellow, and rose gold that Cocteau commissioned from Louis Cartier to represent the three rings of Saturn. (The trinity ring, one of Cartier\u2019s most successful creations ever, is to this day a traditional wedding ring in France.) And they spent the summer of 1923\u2014Radiguet\u2019s last\u2014together at the unspoiled coastal village of Piqu\u00eby, their regular retreat from the hectic pressures of Paris. In the company of the Hugos and other visiting friends, Radiguet worked on his eagerly awaited second novel, Le Bal du Compte d\u2019Orgel (Count D\u2019Orgel\u2019s Ball), and, to some degree, put aside his habitual debauchery. He slept more, drank less, swam in the sea, and sat in the sun. Sometimes, in the evenings, he and Cocteau had story-writing competitions.\n\nMortal danger intruded into this calm in the unlikely form of a batch of oysters, which, as far as anyone could tell, infected Radiguet and Valentine Hugo with typhoid. Though at first their symptoms were fairly mild, in December Valentine developed severe abdominal pain and was rushed to the hospital for peritonitis surgery. Luckily, she made a full recovery. At around the same time, Radiguet became wracked with chills. Initially, he was misdiagnosed as suffering from pneumonia, then another doctor recognized the symptoms of typhoid fever and he was taken to a clinic.\n\nAs Cocteau mentioned in his 1964 Art of Fiction interview with The Paris Review, he sat at Radiguet\u2019s sickbed while the delirious patient forecast his own demise. \u201cListen,\u201d he implored, \u201clisten to a terrible thing. In three days I shall be shot by the soldiers of God.\u201d\n\nCocteau, fighting back tears, protested that the doctors were optimistic.\n\n\u201cYour information is not so good as mine,\u201d Radiguet replied. \u201cThe order has been given. I heard the order.\u201d\n\nThree days later, in the early hours of December 12, 1923, Radiguet had a heart attack and died. He was twenty years old. The voice of death, as channeled by the Hugos\u2019 talking table barely eight months earlier, had made good on its claim. Cocteau took to his bed with an incapacitating grief, leaving Chanel to take care of the funeral arrangements and medical expenses. All of artistic and literary France turned out for the funeral: Picasso and his wife, Olga; the pioneering sculptor Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u015fi, who was once Radiguet\u2019s lover; and \u201cso many celebrated people,\u201d the painter Nina Hamnett later recalled. \u201cRadiguet\u2019s death was a terrible shock to everyone.\u201d Since he had died so young, the coffin, flowers, hearse, and parade horses were all white, as for a child\u2019s funeral. On a wet and foggy morning, a procession of mourners followed the wreath-laden carriage from the church of Saint Honor\u00e9 d\u2019Eylau to P\u00e8re-Lachaise Cemetery, where Radiguet was laid to rest alongside Moli\u00e8re, Balzac, Oscar Wilde, and Proust.\n\nShortly before he got sick, Radiguet had, with the help of one of his brothers, organized his messy papers and manuscripts. This decision, in conjunction with his relative virtuousness that final summer, casts an eerie slant on a passage toward the end of Le Diable au corps:\n\nA disorderly man who is about to die, and does not know it, suddenly begins to put everything around him in order. His life changes. He files his papers. He rises early and retires early to bed. He gives up his vices. His friends are pleased with the change that has come over him. As a result, his sudden death seems all the more unjust. He was going to have a happy life.\n\nIn lieu of a happy life, Radiguet\u2019s fate was the fixed-in-amber glamour and notoriety of the young dead celebrity. A permanent wunderkind who never had the chance to fall out of literary vogue, Radiguet is still published, read, studied, and gossiped about. He looked forward to being old, apparently, so writerly immortality may have struck him as a dubious exchange. But he\u2019d surely be thrilled that his trademark hard-edged amorality\u2014the \u201cfiendish precision\u201d of his observations, as Andr\u00e9 Aciman once put it\u2014has lost little of its power to shock in a world grown, over the course of a century, all but unshockable.\n\nEmma Garman has written about books and culture for Lapham\u2019s Quarterly Roundtable, Longreads, Newsweek, the Daily Beast, Salon, The Awl, Words Without Borders, and other publications."}, {"url": "https://en.geneastar.org/genealogy/hugojean/jean-hugo", "page_content": "Jean Hugo (19 November 1894 \u2013 21 June 1984) was a painter, illustrator, theatre designer and author.

Jean Hugo and Lauretta had seven children: Charles Hugo (farmer), Marie Hugo (artist), Jean-Baptiste Hugo (artist), Ad\u00e8le Hugo (artist), Jeanne Hugo-Chabrol (teacher), Sophie Hugo-Lafont (librarian), L\u00e9opoldine Hugo (artist).Jean Hugo's half-brother Fran\u00e7ois Hugo designed limited-edition jewellery interpretations for Pablo Picasso, Jean Cocteau, Max Ernst and Coco Chanel during the '20s Modern period. Pierre Hugo \u2013 son of Fran\u00e7ois Hugo \u2013 is also a jewellery designer and has written a book about the artistic legacy of the Hugo family, Les Hugo \u2013 Un t\u00e9moignage (Rocher, France, 2007).PaintingsHugo is predominantly known for his sketches and oil or gouache paintings, which are often executed in small formats. He also illustrated books, designed theatre sets and costumes and produced ceramics, murals, textile designs and stained glass windows. Hugo designed the sets and costumes for Carl Theodor Dreyer's film The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928). His paintings can be viewed at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia, and are also present in collections in London, Tokyo, Toronto, Paris, Marseille, and at the Musee Fabre in Montpellier, France \u2013 where there is a room dedicated to his paintings.Jean Hugo's painting is unique in the artistic panorama of the first half of the 20th century and maintains originality while evoking avant-garde themes of magical realism or metaphysical painting. At the start of the 1930s, in between na\u00efve and happy scenes and various theatrical projects \u2013 such as Jean Cocteau's Les mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel \u2013 he produced a series of works in brooding, unsettling, tones (Solitude, 1933).He showed an interest in forest scenes (L'Ermite de Meudon, 1933) and religious themes (La C\u00e8ne, 1933). L'Imposteur (1931) and La Baie des Tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s (1932) were produced in the same period. His painting were based on the sketchbooks that he had with him at all times. He used to say that \"Inspiration comes naturally but one has to arrange regular meetings with it\".L'Imposteur (1931) concludes Hugo's first artistic period, which coincides with his move from Paris to the family property at the Mas de Fourques, Lunel, France, following the death of his grandmother. This imposing painting is an assembly of the most important insights he had acquired thus far: the lessons of the Italian primitives, of Henri Rousseau, of Poussin and Picasso, sources of inspiration on which he is constantly drawing. The subject of the painting evokes the discomfort of the catechumen in the midst of the faithful, prevented from taking communion during Christmas mass at the Church of Saint-Fran\u00e7ois in Montpellier. The painting is set in the countryside around Lunel, with its vineyards and low scrubland (garrigue). The tense and complex composition of the work is extremely well executed. No element, line, motif, nuance of colour or object is secondary. Each element contributes to the pictorial vision. The delicate volumes are bathed in luminosity and stand out from the background. The figures are fixed in the space by superimposed connections, in the Florentine manner.In the middle of the 1930s, he began using oil paints to create his larger compositions while continuing to paint with tempera. Le Mangeur au chandail ray\u00e9 (autoportrait) (1940) shows the artist in his home at the Mas de Fourques. The motif of the stripes contrasts with the neat contours of the table, the chimney and the wall. In this homely setting, the figure seems surrounded by mystery and casualness. Although Hugo does not draw greatly on De Chirico, this work evokes the feeling of isolation and mystery that characterises the production of the latter.Jean Hugo's work bears witness to his intention to work outside of current trends and fashionable theories. He never felt the need to participate in the artistic debates of his time and paid the price for it by never achieving wide recognition of his work by the general public.His auction record is $US308,200, for Les Plaisirs et les Jours, set at Fran\u00e7ois de Ricql\u00e8s' auction, Paris, on 26 November 1999.Selected exhibitionsHugo's work has been widely exhibited, with solo retrospectives taking place in France, England, Japan, Canada and the USA.Jean Hugo and Max Jacob, Claridge Gallery, London, 1929The Art of Jean Hugo, Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, 1973Jean Hugo, Mus\u00e9e Paul Val\u00e9ry, S\u00e8te, 1974Jean Hugo '77, Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, 1977Jean Hugo, Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, 1977\u201378Paintings and Drawings by Jean Hugo and Jean Cocteau, Sotheby's, London, 1981Jean Hugo: Costumes pour \"l'Homme qui rit\", Maison de Victor Hugo, Paris, 1984Jean Hugo: 1894\u20131984, Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, B\u00e9ziers, 1985Jean Hugo: palettes et souvenirs, Mus\u00e9e Victor Hugo, Paris, 1994\u201395Jean Hugo: Dessins des ann\u00e9es de guerre (1915\u20131919), Ch\u00e2teau de Bl\u00e9rancourt Mus\u00e9e de la coop\u00e9ration franco-am\u00e9ricaine, 1994\u201395Jean Hugo: Une R\u00e9trospective, Pavillon du Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, 1995Jean Hugo: a Retrospective, Julian Barran Gallery, London, 1996Jean Hugo et la Sc\u00e8ne, Biblioth\u00e8que-mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra, Paris, 2001Jean Hugo, le manuscrit enlumin\u00e9, Mus\u00e9e M\u00e9dard, Lunel, 2014Jean Hugo: l'Enlumineur du Quotidien, Mus\u00e9e Pierre Andr\u00e9 Benoit, Al\u00e8s, 2014Published workLe Retour de l'enfant terrible: Lettres 1923\u20131966 by Jean Bourgoint, Jean Hugo, Jean Mouton (Descl\u00e9e de Brouwer, 1975)Avant d'oublier (Before I Forget), autobiography (Fayard, 1976), was a humorous memoir of his family and a first-hand account of the 1920s French Surrealist movement.Le Regard de la m\u00e9moire (Actes Sud, 1983) \u2013 Jean Hugo's memoirs of the period from 1914 to 1945.

He was, and remains the very image of that perfect humility of the illuminators, for whom daily truths trumpeted decorative graces. His powerful hand, his big Jupiterian eye, his olympism in a way, did not use thunder but little watercolours so vast that it seemed as if their size was the result of a phenomenon of perspective. Indeed, he seems to view the sea in Brittany from a distance, and the garrigue by the big end of the telescope, which does not prevent him from evoking around us the mysterious odour of seaweed and wild herbs. Jean Hugo, subtle peasant, medieval monk, chases the angel from the bizarre through knowing all its tricks by heart.\"Gustave Thibon: \"I knew him intimately. He was a strange being, admirable, a mystic, a lover, a great artist, who no doubt sinned by excess of modesty. He had been a little tired of fame by his name, which was extremely heavy. [...]Jean Hugo spent his youth in that golden world of the big families of the Third Republic, the Berthelot, the Favre, the Renan, the Daudet, a world that he moved away from for a more isolated life in Lunel. His work is far better known, and valued, in America than in France, where he still suffers a little of being eclipsed by his name. I consider him a great painter, and a great painter that is relatively unknown. If he hadn't found others to look after publicising him, he would never have sold a single painting. Picasso, who was a good friend of his, used to say to him \"you do nothing for your fame\". And indeed he did nothing for it \u2013 others did it to him.Once again, he was a pure being. If the word innocence could be applied to anyone it was him. He was very handsome, and of prodigious vitality \u2013 dare I say Hugolian. He was detached enough not to install himself in his own name \u2013 while still showing unconditional admiration for the work of his great ancestor, that he knew in detail.\" Entretiens avec Gustave Thibon by Philippe Barthelet (\u00c9ditions du Rocher, Monaco, 2001)Maurice Sachs: \"Jean Hugo was calm, kind and generous. Life flowed calmly before him and we knew of no enemies of his. He carried the heavy burden of his family name with elegance. Like his father Georges Hugo he was a man of the world, a man of great distinction in heart and spirit, a kind friend, a man you would want to have in your life.\" La D\u00e9cade de l'illusion (Paris, Gallimard, 1950 pp. 14\u201316)Paul Morand: \"Jean Hugo's artistic temperament holds its own outside of all fashions. His work reminds us of the marvels that the relaxation of some prince of ancient times might have produced, as can be found in the tales of a thousand and one nights.\"ReferencesExternal linksNew York Times Obituary \u2013 June 23, 1984 \"Jean Hugo, Artist, Dies at 89\"Presentation of the Jean Hugo room at the Musee Fabre, Montpellier (in French) Archived 21 September 2014 at the Wayback MachineJean Hugo paintings on WikiArtJean Hugo collection at the Barnes Foundationwebsite of Jean Hugo's home, the Mas de FourquesPast auction results for Jean Hugo at Christie's\n\n\n\nBiography from Wikipedia (see original) under licence CC BY-SA 3.0"}, {"url": "https://www.wikiart.org/en/giambologna", "page_content": "Giambologna (1529 \u2013 13 August 1608) \u2014 (known also as Jean de Boulogne) \u2014 was a Flemish sculptor based in Italy, celebrated for his marble and bronze statuary in a late Renaissance or Mannerist style.\n\n\n\n\n\nJean de Boulogne was born in Douai, Flanders (now in France), in 1529. After youthful studies in Antwerp with the architect-sculptor Jacques du Broeucq, he moved to Italy in 1550 and studied in Rome, making a detailed study of the sculpture of classical antiquity. He was also much influenced by Michelangelo, but developed his own Mannerist style, with perhaps less emphasis on emotion and more emphasis on refined surfaces, cool elegance, and beauty. Pope Pius IV gave Giambologna his first major commission, the colossal bronze Neptune and subsidiary figures for the Fountain of Neptune (the base designed by Tommaso Laureti, 1566) in Bologna. Giambologna spent his most productive years in Florence, where he had settled in 1553. In 1563 he was named a member (Accademico) of the prestigious Accademia delle Arti del Disegno, just founded by the Duke Cosimo I de' Medici, on 13 January 1563, under the influence of the painter-architect Giorgio Vasari, becoming also one of the Medicis' most important court sculptors. He died in Florence at the age of 79; the Medici had never allowed him to leave Florence, as they rightly feared that either the Austrian or Spanish Habsburgs would entice him into permanent employment. He was interred in a chapel he designed himself in the Santissima Annunziata.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiambologna became well known for a fine sense of action and movement, and a refined, differentiated surface finish. Among his most famous works are the Mercury (of which he did four versions), poised on one foot, supported by a zephyr. The god raises one arm to point heavenwards in a gesture borrowed from the repertory of classical rhetoric that is characteristic of Giambologna's maniera.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis other most famous work is the Rape of the Sabine Women (1574\u201382) a marble sculpture which is featured prominently in the Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence's Piazza della Signoria. This impressive sculpture which includes three full figures was carved from a single piece of marble. Giambologna carved it without a subject in mind, and the name Rape of the Sabine Women was given after it was in place in the Loggia. The sculpture was produced for Francesco Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Another of his marbles, Hercules Slaying a Centaur was also placed in the Loggia dei Lanzi in 1599.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiambologna's several depictions of Venus established a canon of proportions, and set models for the goddess' representation that were influential for two generations of sculptors in Italy and in the North. He created allegories strongly promoting Medicean political propaganda, such as Florence Defeating Pisa and, less overtly, Samson Slaying a Philistine, for Francesco de' Medici (1562).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe equestrian statue of Cosimo I de' Medici also in Florence, was completed by his studio assistant Pietro Tacca.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiambologna provided as well as many sculptures for garden grottos and fountains in the Boboli Gardens of Florence and at Pratolino, and the bronze doors of the cathedral of Pisa. He created the bronze sea-horses and some other sculptures for Bartolomeo Ammannati's Fountain of Neptune, Florence.\n\n\n\nThis is a part of the Wikipedia article used under the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 3.0 Unported License (CC-BY-SA).

Brought up in a lively artistic environment, he began teaching himself drawing and painting and wrote essays and poetry from a very early age. His artistic career spans the 20th century, from his early sketches of the First World War, through the creative ferment of the Parisian interwar years, and up to his death in 1984.

He never felt the need to participate in the artistic debates of his time and paid the price for it by never achieving wide recognition of his work by the general public.\n\nHis auction record is $US308,200, for Les Plaisirs et les Jours, set at Fran\u00e7ois de Ricql\u00e8s' auction, Paris, on 26 November 1999.\n\nSelected Exhibitions\n\nHugo's work has been widely exhibited, with solo retrospectives taking place in France, England, Japan, Canada and the USA.\n\nJean Hugo and Max Jacob, Claridge Gallery, London, 1929\n\nThe Art of Jean Hugo, Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, 1973\n\nJean Hugo, Mus\u00e9e Paul Val\u00e9ry, S\u00e8te, 1974\n\nJean Hugo '77, Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, 1977\n\nJean Hugo, Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, 1977-78\n\nPaintings and Drawings by Jean Hugo and Jean Cocteau, Sotheby's, London, 1981\n\nJean Hugo: Costumes pour \"l'Homme qui rit\", Maison de Victor Hugo, Paris, 1984\n\nJean Hugo: 1894-1984, Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, B\u00e9ziers, 1985\n\nJean Hugo: palettes et souvenirs, Mus\u00e9e Victor Hugo, Paris, 1994-5\n\nJean Hugo: Dessins des ann\u00e9es de guerre (1915\u20131919), Ch\u00e2teau de Bl\u00e9rancourt Mus\u00e9e de la coop\u00e9ration franco-am\u00e9ricaine, 1994-5\n\nJean Hugo: Une R\u00e9trospective, Pavillon du Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, 1995\n\nJean Hugo: a Retrospective, Julian Barran Gallery, London, 1996\n\nJean Hugo et la Sc\u00e8ne, Biblioth\u00e8que-mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra, Paris, 2001\n\nJean Hugo, le manuscrit enlumin\u00e9, Mus\u00e9e M\u00e9dard, Lunel, 2014\n\nJean Hugo: l'Enlumineur du Quotidien, Mus\u00e9e Pierre Andr\u00e9 Benoit, Al\u00e8s, 2014\n\nPublished work\n\nLe Retour de l'Enfant Terrible: Lettres 1923\u20131966 by Jean Bourgoint, Jean Hugo, Jean Mouton (Descl\u00e9e de Brouwer, 1975)\n\nAvant d'Oublier (Before I Forget), autobiography (Fayard, 1976), was a humorous memoir of his family and a first-hand account of the 1920s French Surrealist movement.\n\nLe Regard de la M\u00e9moire (Actes Sud, 1983) \u2013 Jean Hugo's memoirs of the period from 1914 to 1945.

He was, and remains the very image of that perfect humility of the illuminators, for whom daily truths trumpted decorative graces. His powerful hand, his big jupiterian eye, his olypism in a way, did not use thunder but little watercolours so vast that it seemed as if their size was the result of a phenomenon of perspective. Indeed, he seems to view the sea in Brittany from a distance, and the garrigue by the big end of the telescope, which does not prevent him from evoking around us the mysterious odour of seaweed and wild herbs. Jean Hugo, subtle peasant, medieval monk, chasses the angel from the bizarre through knowing all its tricks by heart.\"\n\nGustave Thibon: \"I knew him intimately. He was a strange being, admirable, a mystic, a lover, a great artist, who no doubt sinned by excess of modesty. He had been a little tired of fame by his name, which was extremely heavy. [...] Jean Hugo spent his youth in that golden world of the big families of the Third Republic, the Berthelot, the Favre, the Renan, the Daudet, a world that he moved away from for a more isolated life in Lunel. His work is far better known, and valued, in America than in France, where he still suffers a little of being eclipsed by his name. I consider him a great painter, and a great painter that is relatively unknown. If he hadn't found others to look after publicising him, he would never have sold a single painting. Picasso, who was a good friend of his, used to say to him \"you do nothing for your fame\". And indeed he did nothing for it \u2013 others did it to him. Once again, he was a pure being. If the word innocence could be applied to anyone it was him. He was very handsome, and of prodigious vitality \u2013 dare I say Hugolian. He was detached enough not to install himself in his own name \u2013 while still showing unconditional admiration for the work of his great ancestor, that he knew in detail.\" Entretiens avec Gustave Thibon by Philippe Barthelet (\u00c9ditions du Rocher, Monaco, 2001)\n\nMaurice Sachs: \"Jean Hugo was calm, kind and generous. Life flowed calmly before him and we knew of no enemies of his. He carried the heavy burden of his family name with elegance. Like his father Georges Hugo he was a man of the world, a man of great distinction in heart and spirit, a kind friend, a man you would want to have in your life.\" La D\u00e9cade de l'illusion (Paris, Gallimard, 1950 p. 14\u201316)\n\nPaul Morand: \"Jean Hugo's artistic temperament holds its own outside of all fashions.

This is his syntax and it has imprinted itself on our minds by its modified repetition and underlying permanence.\"\n\n\"[A] man of accomplished spirituality might see in each of Arp's sculptures a translation of the highest activities of the spirit, the very soul of the Prajna Paramita of the Hindus. And is not a leaf as authentic an image of the supreme wisdom as the imaginary face of the Buddha? What is a form if not the expression of a force that animates it, of a spirit that inhabits it? To let this force, this spirit, speak freely is the aim that Arp undertakes to achieve without going beyond it. Now it is especially difficult not to go beyond it (through the richness of the imagination, in particular), for this language must be as simple as the song of a bird, as calm as the beating of the heart, as humble as water.\"\n\n\"Arp was concerned with purity, with being free, being independent of everything unpleasant and limiting, and with the active, constant emission of positive energy as well as its perception.\"\n\nSummary of Hans Arp\n\nSomething of a one-man movement, Jean Arp could (and did) make anything into art. Best-known for his biomorphic sculptures, and one of the most versatile creative minds of the early-20th century, he fashioned sculptures out of plaster, stone and bronze, and also expressed himself in paintings, drawings, collages, and poems. His approach to form, often referred to as organic abstraction, was remarkably consistent: his wavy lines suggested plants, body parts and other natural motifs, while remaining entirely abstract. Like an extraterrestrial on earth for the very first time, Arp's genius was in presenting visual information as if he is first seeing it. Transformation, growth, fecundity, and metamorphosis are among the dominant themes in his work.\n\nAccomplishments\n\nArp's work is non-representational, yet firmly rooted in nature. His most abstract compositions suggest organic forms. This keeps the viewer curious, and provides a consistent framework for satisfying the eye.\n\nOne of the first artists to make randomness and chance part of the work, Arp saw chance as a collaborator in his process. This was a game-changer in the visual arts. Until then, Western artists had striven for a skilled level of control.\n\nRather than beginning with a subject (as artists had done for years), Arp generated the form first, and titled his works after they were completed. In this way, he sought to minimize the intervention of the conscious mind.\n\nArp is a transitional figure. As one of the founders of Dada, and subsequently an active participant in Surrealism, his work forms a link between these two major movements of the early-20th century.\n\nImportant Art by Hans Arp\n\nProgression of Art\n\nArtwork Images 1916-17 Collage with Squares Arranged According to the Laws of Chance One of Arp's earliest \"chance collages,\" this composition demonstrates his signature technique of tearing paper into rough shapes and dropping them onto a larger sheet, and then pasting them where they happened to fall. However, if we look carefully at this composition, what are the \"chances\" that pieces of paper would fall this way? They are relatively evenly spaced and aligned with the frame, gently guided by the artist into an unfussy, yet harmonious composition. Even if Arp was not entirely willing to relinquish control over the process, this idea was incredibly radical for the period. One of the first attempts to engage the element of chance in a work of art, it demonstrates Arp's commitment to the ideal of chaos, a hallmark of Dada. Torn-and-pasted paper on blue-gray paper - The Museum of Modern Art, New York Artwork Images 1922 Shirt Front and Fork One of a series of wooden relief sculptures made by Arp in the 1920s, Shirt Front and Fork depicts a recognizable form in an unrecognizable context. Rendered in black, grey and white, the work has an overt graphic quality that allows the viewer to quickly identify the shape of a fork on the right side. The object to the left, which resembles an enlarged tooth, is less easy to identify, and remains mysterious, evoking a host of associations that are ultimately unresolved for the viewer. Completed only a few years after Arp joined the Z\u00fcrich Dada group and shortly before he participated in landmark Surrealist exhibitions, this work marks the transition from one movement to another. It is rooted in a stream of unconsciousness that foreshadows the core ambition of the Surrealists to resolve the contradictions between dream and reality. Throughout his career, Arp favored a restricted palette and, as he put it in 1955, \"especially...black, white and grey\" because, he explained, \"There is a certain need in me for communication with human beings. Black and white is writing.\" Painted wood - National Gallery of Art Artwork Images 1930 Configuration with Two Dangerous Points This painted-wood relief belongs to a group of related works that Arp completed in Paris in the 1930s. Animated through the seemingly random placement of the assembled elements, but in fact the product of a careful series of aesthetic choices, Configuration with Two Dangerous Points reveals Arp's strong focus on achieving a perfect structural balance without a loss of movement. Composed of four white and two black elements, this work exhibits an overt sense of play. This quality is further enhanced by its title, which is partially descriptive, but also humorous. In a work that essentially consists of floating blobs with gentle curves, where are these so-called dangerous points? Wood - The Philadelphia Museum of Art Artwork Images 1932 Sculpture to be Lost in the Forest Arp usually created his sculptures in plaster, sanding away until he found the satisfying shape, and thought up the titles only when the work was complete. This sculpture, a bronze cast of an earlier plaster form, resembles a configuration of heavy objects: boulders, sacks, or figures on a bed. Rooted in Arp's lifelong fascination with the physiological processes of growth and death, the work's title strongly suggests some sort of landscape, but evokes multiple associations that shift as one looks at the work. This is exactly how the artist wanted it. Like Duchamp and others in the Dada circle, Arp believed that the viewer completes the work of art. Sculpture to be Lost in the Forest is a prime example of Arp's ability to balance abstraction with allusion. His forms are constantly in flux and morphing, sometimes toward and sometimes beyond recognition. Bronze - Collection of the Tate, United Kingdom Artwork Images 1935 Metamorphosis (Shell Swan) Here as in Sculpture to be Lost in the Forest, Arp began with the form, and titled the work after it was completed.\n\n\n\nWhile it is essentially a sturdy triangle, this apparently simple shape gathers complexity as one looks at it. Its vertical curves suggest fluidity and transience. A firm believer in purely abstract art, Arp was interested in alluding to forms in nature without actually depicting them. While Metamorphosis (Shell Swan) employs the same visual information we find in the world around us, and even resembles the smooth white forms listed in its title, its unique shape seems otherworldly. Plaster, paint - The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York Artwork Images 1953 Ptolemy Arp was keenly interested in opposites. In this particular sculpture the contrast between material and emptiness is showcased by the smooth limestone surface, with its elegant line twisted form embracing two gaping voids. Named after the Greco-Egyptian mathematician, astronomer, geographer, and astrologer Claudius Ptolemy (who was also interested in opposites) this work is about being and nothingness, and the complex relationship between nature and humanity, which were inseparable for Arp. Carola Giedion-Welcker described Arp's conception of nature as \"an immense vital process, both extraordinarily simple and complex, a cycle evolving between birth and death, constantly changing and growing, and hence to be grasped only dynamically, never statically in the field of art... We detect in Arp the profound experience of life, which conceives of creation as an eternal process, as permanent transformation and growth... This is why Arp's initial forms strike us as being so ready to be transmuted, so filled with inner organic tension.\" Limestone - The Museum of Modern Art, New York Artwork Images 1953 Cloud Shepherd Cloud Shepherd was the first monumental sculpture completed by Arp, and one of a number of bronzes generated by the artist in the 1950s. It is a triumphant, late-career statement of Arp's life-long ambition to create art that alludes to forms in nature while steadfastly avoiding representation. Its abstract, but organic, bulging forms suggest figures (a shepherd with his crook, one of the animals in his flock, or both) animated by a mysterious interior life. It is symbolic, for the infinite cycle of life is played out as it is in nature on a microscopic and macroscopic level. There is also a delightful contrast here, between the permanence of a material like bronze, and a form as transient as a cloud. Bronze - Collection of Central University of Venezuela, Caracas\n\nBiography of Hans Arp\n\nChildhood and Education\n\nA restless thinker and a nomad, Arp was born into circumstances of uncertainty that shaped his path as an artist. Neither fully French nor fully German, the artist referred to himself as \"Jean\" when speaking French, and \"Hans\" when speaking German. Born Hans Peter Wilhelm Arp in 1886 in Alsace (still part of Germany at the time), he began studying art in his home town of Strasbourg, transferred to Weimar, completed his schooling in Paris and by 1911, had co-founded the first modern art alliance in Switzerland, Der Moderne Bund. With Der Moderne Bund, he worked for a brief period with Wassily Kandinsky and Der Blaue Reiter group in Munich, but soon returned to Paris where he hobnobbed with Amedeo Modigliani, Pablo Picasso, Sonia and Robert Delaunay, as well as Guillaume Apollinaire and Max Jacob.\n\nEarly Period\n\nFleeing the horrors of World War I, Arp moved to Z\u00fcrich, where he helped found the Dada movement at the international and independent art space founded by two poets (Sally Hemmings and Hugo Ball) whose stated aim was to create chaos. It was here, among the broad-minded international audience that best suited his temperament, that he found his niche. Like Arp himself, Dada was international and interdisciplinary. Inspired by the general mood of chaos, randomness and nonsense, he began making \"chance collages\" --scraps of paper dropped at random onto a larger sheet and pasted where they fell. He was tremendously productive during these years, focusing on creating collages and tapestries, often in collaboration with Sophie Taeuber, and crafted wooden reliefs with layered biomorphic forms. As an ambassador of the Dada movement, in 1918 Arp recruited a like-minded circle of artists in Berlin -- Hannah H\u00f6ch, Raoul Hausmann and Kurt Schwitters, to join the Dada movement. At the dawn of the 1920s, he became a published writer in a variety of magazines, including Merz, M\u00e9cano, De Stijl, and La R\u00e9volution Surr\u00e9aliste. In 1922 he married his friend, soul mate and collaborator Tauber, who from then on went by Tauber-Arp. The two continued to collaborate until her early and tragic death.\n\nIn 1925 Arp was among the co-founders of another major movement: Surrealism. His work appeared alongside that of Giorgio de Chirico, Max Ernst, Paul Klee, Man Ray, Andr\u00e9 Masson, and Joan Mir\u00f3 in the first Surrealist exhibition at the Galerie Pierre in Paris. At this time, Arp began to enjoy significant commercial success. In 1926 he received a major commission to redesign the interior of the Aubette, a historic dance hall, a project he completed with Tauber-Arp and Theo van Doesburg and which, when reopened in 2006, was hailed by a reviewer in as the \"Sistine Chapel of abstract art\". By the end of the 1920s, fully immersed in French Surrealist circles, Arp had had his first solo exhibition at the Galerie Surr\u00e9aliste in Paris, become a French citizen, and settled in Clamart, a town outside of Paris.\n\nMature Period\n\nThe 1930s were an extraordinarily prolific period for Arp, who was at the height of his creative powers during this decade. \"By the middle and later 1930s,\" James Thrall Soby noted, \"Arp had reached his full stature as a sculptor in the round.\" In 1937 his sculptures were included in two major exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art in New York: Cubism and Abstract Art and Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism. Arp continued his work in other mediums, however, including torn paper pieces (Papiers dechir\u00e9s), and published his poems even more frequently in French Surrealist journals such as Minotaure and Le Surr\u00e9alisme au Service de la Revolution. A staunch supporter not only of Surrealism, but also abstraction, he helped found two international organizations in support of abstract art (Cercle et Carr\u00e9 and Abstraction Cr\u00e9ation) and joined a third in Switzerland, Allianz. In 1940 he once again fled the German occupation, this time to Grasse, in the South of France. At the end of 1942, tragedy struck: Taeuber-Arp died tragically of accidental carbon monoxide poisoning, due to a malfunctioning stove at a friend's house in Z\u00fcrich, where the couple was staying. The death of his wife and collaborator plunged Arp into a deep depression from which he did not emerge until the end of the decade. He withdrew from the public and focused primarily on poetry and a catalogue raisonne of Tauber-Arp's oeuvre. When World War II ended, he returned to Clamart and began making sculpture again, and by the late 1940s, a new woman had entered his life: Marguerite Hagenbach, a collector and friend who had been taking care of his correspondence and other administrative obligations, accompanied him on his first trip to the U.S. on the occasion of the artist's solo exhibition in New York in 1949. She stayed at the Hotel Chelsea, while he stayed with the Austrian artist and architect Frederick Kiesler, but it is clear that the two were already a couple, though they would not marry for another decade. Arp's growing reputation in the U.S. sparked the interest of architects, including Walter Gropius, who arranged for Arp to receive the commission to create a large-scale relief sculpture for the Harvard Graduate Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. A year later, in 1953, Arp executed his first monumental sculpture, Cloud Shepherd, for the University of Caracas in Venezuela.\n\nLate Period\n\nArp continued to work with almost superhuman energy throughout the last decade of his life. By the mid-1950s, his fame was international. He received the prestigious Grand Prize for Sculpture at La Biennale di Venezia in 1956. Not one to rest on his laurels, the artist kept moving, always thinking bigger and organizing major solo exhibitions and public works. Among the triumphs of his final decade were two major retrospectives (at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and at the Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne in Paris in 1958 and1962, respectively), and three large-scale reliefs (for the Paris branch of UNESCO, for the University of Caracas, and for the University of Applied Sciences in Braunschweig). Failing health prevented him from traveling after 1958, and in 1959 he finally married Marguerite Hagenbach, his longtime companion. Together they bought a property, Ronco dei Fiori in Locarno, Switzerland, which is still owned by the Arp foundation. Arp suffered a heart attack in Basel on June 7, 1966 and passed away shortly afterward, leaving behind him a legacy that continues to shape the history of art.\n\nThe Legacy of Hans Arp\n\nArp made his imprint on a staggering array of disciplines, from sculpture and architecture to literature and mid-century modern furniture. As a co-founder of the Dada movement, his organically-inspired sculptures in the first Surrealist exhibition in 1925, played an integral role in linking the two movements, and shaping the future of Surrealism. His poetry (in particular, his random word play) inspired both Dada and Surrealist poets, most notably Tristan Tzara and Guillaume Apollinaire. He also inspired a diverse range of visual artists within the Dada and Surrealist circle, first and foremost among them Sophie Taeuber-Arp, who became his most valued collaborator. Reverberations of his biomorphic sculpture are visible in designs for tables and chairs by Charles Eames and Eero Saarinen, two highly influential architects.\n\nMore broadly, it was not simply Arp's biomorphism (abstract references to nature) that made him a major player on the 20th-century stage. He was a pioneer in randomizing the results of art. This is perhaps his greatest contribution, inspiring numerous movements, including Dada (in which chance generated an aesthetic of chaos) Surrealism (in which chance was a means for exploring the unconscious) and Abstract Expressionism (in which chance became a mode of gestural expression).\n\nInfluences and Connections\n\nUseful Resources on Hans Arp\n\nSimilar Art"}, {"url": "https://www.theartstory.org/artist/tinguely-jean/", "page_content": "Summary of Jean Tinguely\n\nJean Tinguely first began creating assemblages composed of found-objects, but soon thereafter, intrigued by the current debate regarding the effect of mechanization and industrial innovation on modern society, he completely altered these static works by putting them into motion. Tinguely was intrigued by the effect of these moving constructions on the spectator and devoted the rest of his career to its exploration. The resultant oeuvre, on both a small and large scale, in works that generated corollary works of art and those that self-destructed, instigated spectator reaction and forever challenged the concept of a static experience of viewing art.\n\nAccomplishments\n\nTinguely updated the Dada practice of creating sculptural assemblage composed of found-objects, most often scrap metal that might easily have been considered junk, by actually mechanizing them. The revolutionary step of putting a work of art into motion would become known as Kinetic Art.\n\nAlso following the lead of Dada artists, who used various means to make fun of society, Tinguely's mechanized creations were intended to mock the \"improvements\" of the industrial revolution and modern reliance on technology.\n\nTinguely challenged the assumption of the artist's monopoly on creation with his metamatics , mechanized assemblages fitted with a drawing stylus chosen by any given spectator. The works of art that resulted were given significance on their own, separate to that of the original construction.\n\n, mechanized assemblages fitted with a drawing stylus chosen by any given spectator. The works of art that resulted were given significance on their own, separate to that of the original construction. The self-destructing assemblages took the concepts explored in his earlier mechanized sculptures to a new level. Providing an actual spectacle for the viewers, a one-off experience with a defined beginning and end intended not only to be seen but in addition, to evoke their reaction, these assemblages illustrate Tinguely branching out into more interactive art whose effect simulates a performance.\n\nThe Life of Jean Tinguely\n\nDeclaring, \"The only stable thing is movement,\" Jean Tinguely pioneered Kinetic Art. He was also a leader of many other artistic directions in his powerfully prolific, creative life. Read full biography Read artistic legacy\n\nImportant Art by Jean Tinguely\n\nProgression of Art\n\nArtwork Images 1954 Metamechanical Sculpture with Tripod Tinguely used the term \"Metamechanics\" to describe how he set his assemblage sculptures into motion with some form of motor or system of mechanics. The artist's development of this field, otherwise known as Kinetic art, is exemplified by Metamechanical Sculpture with Tripod. In this early example the artist assembles simple, found objects of the type elevated to artistic status by the Dada artists by whom he was influenced earlier. Wire wheels, to which are connected organically-shaped flat cardboard pieces, painted white on one side and black on the other, are strategically intertwined with stick-straight elements in an interlocking system. The assemblage is balanced above an iron tripod, whose legs echo the linearity of the straight elements assembled above, and the whole fragile assemblage is set into motion. The piece stands nearly 7 feet tall, making its effect quite impressive.\n\n\n\nThe idea to put assemblages such as this into movement was significant as it evoked an interactive relationship between the spectator and the object. No longer looking at a static collection from a fixed point but instead, moving around in order to get a better look at which parts of the construction were moving, the spectator's experience was actually integrated into the overall effect of the work itself.\n\n\n\nInterestingly enough, although the work seems to laud the overall effect of mechanization, by expanding its effect on the spectator, there is some suggestion that instead, it exhibits Dada skepticism regarding the potential of technology to improve human life. By taking on human aspects, simulating limbs that move, for example, the mechanized assemblage itself challenges the concept that machines are necessarily superior to human beings, questioning whether mechanization is actually progress. Steel, plastic, cardboard, mechanical motor - Collection of the Tate, United Kingdom Artwork Images 1959 Metamatic, no. 17 Metamatic, no. 17 was created especially for the 1959 Paris Biennale. It is a sculptural work composed of a number of differently-shaped found objects, primarily black metal wires, wheels, belts, cogs and crank-shafts - all driven by a small engine. When mechanized, the elements - irregular in nature - rotate in different directions and at varying speeds; their movement is bumpy and jagged.\n\n\n\nThis work is an excellent example of Tinguely's Kinetic artwork and pushes even further his interest in involving the spectator. The viewer is invited to choose a drawing tool (color, charcoal, or pencil) and place it in the special holder mounted on the assemblage. Paper can be seen cascading down the side of the structure, suspended from above an elevated section of the work. When put into motion, the turning wheels would activate the chosen drawing tool, moving it along a piece of paper. The result would be a work of art in itself. The artwork created was of a necessarily unforeseen nature, differing each and every time, and directly affected by the random movement of the asymmetrical mechanical device.\n\n\n\nTinguely's Metamatic, no. 17 altered the already challenging nature of his earlier metamechanical works by introducing a product directly affected by the spectator. No longer just watching a process, the viewer, by choosing an artistic instrument, plays a role in the creation of an entirely new work of art. In effect, the artist's work challenged the centuries-old tradition of artistic creation: taking part of the art-making out of the hands of the artist and placing it in those of the spectator. Beyond blurring the line of the role of the artist/viewer, here we see the beginnings of interactive art, a practice that is now highlighted by dozens of artists and takes center stage at many museums. De Lairesse, Amsterdam Artwork Images 1960 Homage to New York On March 18, 1960, Tinguely unveiled what would later be considered his most famous work in the sculpture garden of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. A number of artists and engineers collaborated on the project, including Robert Rauschenberg. The massive sculpture stood twenty-seven feet tall, was twenty-three feet wide, and was painted primarily white. Built out of various pieces of metal, bicycle parts, self-operating motors, a go-cart, a bathtub, a piano, all jutting out into space at odd angles and creating an absolute tangle of abstract forms. The original idea was to set the mechanized elements into motion, allow the audience to watch and figure out its changing path of movement, and then set off an explosion that would destroy it. The work was to be a masterpiece of self-destructing Kinetic art. However, 27 minutes into the premiere, one of the processes within the moving parts misfired and sparked a flame that engulfed the entire machine in a blazing fire. The spectacle to which this esteemed audience (including the Governor of New York) was subjected became as much a part of the artistic experience as the original work itself.\n\n\n\nThe launch of this intricate, self-destructing sculpture changed the nature of Tinguely's art. Although he had already harnessed active viewer interaction in his Metamatics, this work's significance was to be even further enhanced by the experience of being present as it self-destructed. In total, the work was to assume an alternative symbolism, suggesting, for example the organic nature of New York City - known for both destruction and reconstruction, exhaustion and renewal.\n\n\n\nA \"fragment\" of the original sculpture exists in the permanent collection of the MOMA. Found objects, motorized elements - The Museum of Modern Art, New York Artwork Images 1966 Santana Bascule In Tinguely's Santana Bascule a thick, flat black wooden wheel attached at a point to a thin semi-circular metal piece take center stage. This sculpture is balanced by a special pedestal made of a compilation of concave metal strips that rocks from side-to-side while hurling around the central elements in an unpredictable fashion. This work differs from the artist's earlier assemblages by abandoning the more colorful found-objects, previously seen in works by Dada artists and restricting itself to an entirely black palette. The result is a far more austere, minimalistic work. The resultant movement is also more focused in nature, limited to the pivot beneath and the spinning wheel above. Like his other mechanized assemblages this one again serves as commentary on the debate regarding the effects of mechanization on modern society. Metal, wood, mechanical motor - Bechtler Museum of Modern Art, Charlotte, NC Artwork Images 1983 Stravinsky Fountain The artistic cooperation between Jean Tinguely and Niki de Saint Phalle resulted in some of the most intriguing artworks of the modernist movement. Stravinsky Fountain is an example of their successful collaboration. Located directly above the archive of Igor Stravinsky's compositions, housed in the IRCAM offices (Research Center for Contemporary Music) underground beneath the fountain, the work necessitated a specifically lightweight construction. Devoted to the composer's musical compositions, this fountain praises the achievements of creativity outside of mechanization. Completed in 1983, it features sixteen sculptural works erected above a shallow basin. Tinguely's mechanized black iron elements, many squirting water, are placed alongside, under and between Saint Phalle's more light-hearted, brightly painted, organic elements in a manner that supports but never overwhelms. They work together to create a contrapuntal rhythm, like that found in musical compositions.\n\n\n\nTinguely intended for the multiple elements to stick up above the surface of the water and \"perform\" like figures in a circus. Throughout his later years, Tinguely continued to design assemblages that specifically interacted with sources of water. Saint Phalle's use of extremely bold colors and a charismatic sense of levity on inflated anatomical elements and animal motifs characterizes her mature works. Metal, fiberglass and various mechanical elements - Public work in Place Stravinsky, Paris, France Artwork Images 1991 Cascade Cascade is a massive 40-foot mixed media sculpture, suspended above an inlaid fountain in the main lobby of the Carillon office tower in Charlotte, NC. This motorized mobile is obviously influenced by those made famous earlier by Alexander Calder. Tinguely encountered his work first in Paris and was delighted to exhibit alongside him at the Galerie Denise Rene in 1955. Calder provided inspiration for a generation of sculptors interested in Kinetic art.\n\n\n\nCascade features an array of found objects that slowly rotate around one another. Included are antlers, a car hood, various light bulbs, planks of wood and metal pieces. The variety, color, and haphazard nature of the collected objects suggest a return to the artist's original interest in the Dada aesthetic. Here he abandons the more subdued and minimalistic assemblage which characterized his works mid-career.\n\n\n\nThe use of numerous, interlaid mechanisms creates a busy experience for the viewer. Affecting both those who've come specifically to view the project or those walking through the corporate office building on their way to work, the assemblage reaches different strata of society. This work was commissioned by Tinguely's loyal patron, the Bechtler family, and was the last created before his death in 1991. Various found objects, metal, wood and mechanical motors - Carillon Office Tower, Charlotte, NC Artwork Images 1969-94 Le Cyclop Tinguely began construction on Le Cyclop in 1969 at the Milly-la-For\u00eat (Milly Forest) in France. Although it's nominally a one-eyed cyclop of the kind found in Greek mythology, it's actually composed of multiple whimsical elements which negate any lingering feeling of the horror associated with its name. Included are staircases, mezzanines, and passageways; its tongue is a sliding board (almost a children's slide), which ends in a pool of water.\n\n\n\nIn the beginning, the idea was that there would be no architect or blueprint for the work other than a small model Tinguely had created in 1970. The completed structure, which eventually stood 74 feet high and weighed 350 tons, was to be an example of aesthetic collaboration by a number of artists. Like other of Tinguely's projects, its realization stretched out over the course of years, 25 to be precise, and combined the creative genius of more than ten of artists, including Arman, Cesar, Daniel Spoerri, Bernhard Luginbuhl, and Niki de Saint Phalle. Their contributions, enhancing and altering quite significantly Tinguely's original idea, include a mirrored mosaic by Saint Phalle, a huge flipper (whose activation demands two spectators) by Bernhard Luginbuhl, and a sculptural work devoted to the subject of the deportation by XXX.\n\n\n\nLe Cyclop invites viewers to experience its numerous nooks and crannies, whether visiting the theater where the brain of the cyclop's head should be, exploring the machinery of scrap iron gears or simply making their way through the maze-like interior. The experience of the viewer is not limited to an assessment of the parts assembled but instead, includes his journey through, around and inside of the large sculpture as a whole. Concrete, iron and a mirrored mosaic facade - Public work in Milly-la-For\u00eat, France\n\nBiography of Jean Tinguely\n\nChildhood and Education\n\nTinguely was born on May 22, 1925 in Fribourg, Switzerland but his family moved to Basel shortly thereafter. Being the only child of two working class parents, Tinguely spent a considerable amount of time in solitude, exploring his bucolic surroundings. In 1940, at age fifteen, he began designing storefront window displays as an apprentice. The following year he began his studies at the Kunstgewerbeschule (Arts and Crafts School), where he stayed until 1945.\n\nTinguely was initially influenced by artists such as Kurt Schwitters and Marcel Duchamp. In particular, he was attracted to their use of \"found objects\" (or objet trouves), a key component of the Dada movement. He was intrigued by the tendency to rebel against societal structures and formalities that had long existed in the art world and society at-large. Tinguely combined found- objects, of the type noted in Dada works, with the new emphasis on installation then developed within the Bauhaus Design School by artists such as Paul Klee, creating his own personal aesthetic.\n\nEarly Period\n\nIn 1951, having recently married Swiss painter and sculptor Eva Aeppli and intent on forwarding his career, Tinguely moved to Paris. He enjoyed great success there with his first solo exhibition in 1954 at the Galerie Arnaux. During this period he also participated in a number of exhibitions organized around cutting edge groups. The first was in 1951 when he showed with International Happenings. Soon thereafter he began to exhibit with a group known as ZERO that was founded by Otto Piene in Germany and aesthetically favored the notion of Minimalism. ZERO artists sought to distance themselves from the events of WWII and instead to find a context for their art based on modern society. During this period Tinguely also exhibited with Nouveaux Realisme, a group formed by Pierre Restany and Yves Klein that included works of other modern artists such as Christo, Raymond Haines, Martial Raysse and Niki de Saint Phalle.\n\nMature Period\n\nGradually Tinguely began incorporating self-operating and self-destructing elements into his work, making it a type of performance art. One example of this was a machine that mass-produced abstract paintings that debuted at the 1959 Biennale of Paris. Based on their autonomous functionality, these machines were known as \"Metamatic.\" Tinguely's goal was to reflect the tension that existed within industrialized society regarding creativity and human expression. Critics and contemporary abstract expressionists considered these works sardonic.\n\nInfluenced by his passion for motorcar racing, Tinguely began to incorporate the idea of high risk, unpredictability into his works. Homage to New York, premiering on March 18, 1960 at the Museum of Modern Art, is the most prominent example of this interest. This set the stage for other self-destructing works like Study for an End of the World (1962) and La Vittoria (1970). Although they were composed of seemingly random found objects, oddly configured mechanisms and cacophonous sound effects, these works exhibited a sense of humor and irony. The artist viewed each piece as a living, breathing entity - speaking and moving of its own accord. Tinguely took pride in knowing that viewers could be amused by the forthright humor and playful elements he used to mask his dark commentary on mass production and the greater industrialization of society.\n\nIn keeping with his playful antics and spirit of rebellion, Tinguely participated in the Kuttlebutzer, a collective of artists that acted as the unofficial creative committee for the largest annual \"Fasnacht\" carnival in Basel, Switzerland. This committee of artists, known for being anti-establishment, took it upon themselves to solidify the creative direction of the festivities. Tinguely's participation, first in 1974, lasted almost twenty years.\n\nThe wit and charm of his personality manifested in his artwork helped him foster significant relationships with dignitaries and socialites that led to generous commissions and patronage opportunities. A lasting example of this is his friendship with the Bechtler family, a wealthy Swiss family whose vast art collection is on display at the Bechtler Museum of Modern Art in Charlotte, North Carolina. Many of the found objects that later appeared in his works, including a set of antlers, were originally seen on display at the Bechtler home.\n\nTinguely initially met Niki de Saint Phalle through common artistic circles. At the time they were both married to different people. Despite the significant generational gap between them and differences in social background, he was from a working-class background and she a French aristocratic family, their friendship eventually developed and led to marriage. Comparable to other artist couples of the era, they each had a strong sense of individuality, which came through on the occasions they collaborated. This was quite different from the male dominated collaborations among most of the artist couples at the time such as Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, Christo and Jean-Claude, Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner. They are known as the \"Bonnie and Clyde\" of modern art.\n\nThe foundation of their relationship, rooted in their shared interest in creating art, inspired many collaborative works over their decades together. One of the first major collaborations, exhibited at the Moderna Museet, consisted of a massive reclining figure of a woman - one of the several works of the theme known as 'Nanas' that Saint Phalle produced - with legs splayed enough to allow the entry of visitors. Inside the figure was a kinetic sculpture designed by Tinguely which he described as the \"orgasm machine.\" The couple also collaborated on several other monumental sculpture installations such as the Stravinsky Fountain in Paris and Le Paradis Fantastique in Stockholm. When they weren't collaborating, the two artists helped one another with the production and installation of their respective works.\n\nLater Period\n\nIn the 1970s, Tinguely moved back to Switzerland alone while Saint Phalle stayed in France. They would get together at her house in France when working on a collaborative project. During this period, and up until his death in 1991, he continued to produce self-destructing works as well as large public projects. In 1970, Tinguely built a gigantic phallus which he exploded outside of Milan Cathedral. Among these later works are a number of collaborations with Saint Phalle and others. As he and his wife had supported one another throughout their respective careers, it was no surprise that the same held true after his death. Niki de Saint Phalle oversaw the completion of his Le Cyclops, a massive collaborative work whose construction spanned twenty-five years, and was also responsible for donating several of his works to major museums and collections, continuing the legacy of one of the most revolutionary sculpture artists of the modern art movement.\n\nThe Legacy of Jean Tinguely\n\nJean Tinguely's work was part of the movement of New Realism that emerged in the 1960s and sought an alternative expression of the new world order. They tended to take bits and pieces from life and combine them in new ways in order to infuse art with new significance. They stood in opposition of figurative art and abstraction and influenced the Fluxus movement noted for synthesizing a number of media in new, innovative, and consistently energized, ways.\n\nTinguely's mechanization of found objects greatly influenced the British artist Arthur Ganson. Ganson's oeuvre, primarily machines created from parts put into motion, provoke viewer participation of the type noted in Tinguely's earlier works. British artist Michael Landy has taken Tinguely's self-destructing works one step further. His Break Down (2001), in which he destroyed all of his possessions, was the ultimate reflection of what Tinguely had begun to explore in his self-destructing works. Both of these artists' works embody the interaction of the viewer which Tinguely's works insisted upon, taking performance art of the nature explored by the Swiss artist to another plane.\n\nMuseum Tinguely, located in Basel, Switzerland, commemorates his legacy.\n\nInfluences and Connections\n\nUseful Resources on Jean Tinguely\n\nSimilar Art"}]}
